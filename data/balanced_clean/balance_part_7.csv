rating,review
2.0,The glasses seemed to be of very low quality. I was also disappointed  at the high mirror look of the lenses… overkill for fishing. They are also very loose fitting so be careful if you buy them…
2.0,"Outfit would of been adorable but... Order 9 months for my small 4 month old. Pants don't even fit now, elastic band wouldn't fit a 2 month old and are super long, not stretchy at all. The shirt has a super wide neck that won't even fit a 3 year old, long arms and the width of the shirt fits him now. Sizing is so weird. I just wouldn't recommend this outfit"
2.0,This bra was just a lot of bra and not that comfortable.  It felt that I was wearing body armor and going to war.  Also gave me torpedo boobs
2.0,"The product does not look like the photos. For one, it’s snug-i ordered based on the size chart and it’s too form fitting. It’s also very, very thin...perfect for mild temps, but again, not like that photo.  And because it’s thin, it’s also light/color distorted at the seams."
2.0,I love them but there's no tummy control. The big elastic band on the top makes my mama belly pop out.
2.0,"Bought these for my wife.  She loved them.  The earrings are attractive and she loves the style.  The issue I have is that the posts are very soft and the back is a very tight fit.  To get them on, I had to help so the post would not bend.  However, the 3rd time she wore them, the post broke.  A better back would help."
2.0,"This tank top fits LARGE. Like 3 sizes too large. And it flares, so needless to say It was not at all flattering on my petite frame. It does not shrink after washing, but does maintain its shape well and I appreciate that the white is not sheer. If the sizing were more accurate and/or adjustable, this would be better. As it were, I would not recommend this shirt for a small-framed person."
2.0,Too small & came in an ungiftable crap box. The picture showed blush color; mine is colorless & blah.<br />Amazon makes delivery & returns difficult in my area so will just give to an organization. Not gifting it & don’t want it.
2.0,"i bought this for a cute date night dress.  the fabric is too casual for me to wear at night - its either cotton or like cotton to the touch. But, the cut is too dressy to wear around in the summer day too.  i would not call this a cocktail party dress because of the fabric.  The cut is good and seems true to size though."
2.0,"for the price very cute. feels rather cheaply made as if it came from dollar store or cheap drug store glasses, not very comfortable either on my nose."
2.0,nicely made...but very thin..returned:-(
2.0,Even though ut a xl it fit like a large.. Arms like a med.. So tech u want to wear a med of xl... Sending ut bavk cause i cant fit. Sad
2.0,The T-shirt has stretch. I sized up two sizes and ran small I can usually wear a large or XL. I ordered a xxl as Amazon tshirts usually run small. And it fits like a large. Also I thought the the lightening bolt was sequins and it’s not.
2.0,These have faded with the first wear at the knees.  They were recently delivered this month.
2.0,"The material was very basic, but the look was unattractive on me. Could work in darker colors for a basic plain dress if you want to weare a winter vest over it or something else to jazz it up a bit.  I returned it, and as standing in line in the shop noticed a small nick in the fabric on the front near the shoulder seam. It's visible, and would show more as washed."
2.0,Just opened the package that was supposed to contain 3 pairs of earrings. It only contained one pair.
2.0,The color and style was good but the quality of the shoe wasn’t what I was expecting. The customer support responded in an appropriate manner.
2.0,I had high Hope's for these boots but really not a fan. The tail on the backside looks like a bunny tail and they and short boots like almost ankle boots. Had I paid the full amount I would be sending them back. Really not cute!!
2.0,It did not look like a describe
2.0,"I was excited when I found this dress for a good price on Amazon. The dress is surprisingly great quality​ but is VERY short. I ordered a medium, and the wrap portion in the front came up to my crotch area and I'm only 5'3. This dress would be cute for someone 5'0 and under."
2.0,"It doesnt look like the picture at all. The gold tip is very light , barely noticeable. Also I've yet to be able to get the second ball off to even put it in..."
2.0,"Soft pajamas, love the soft pink color, but not very flattering on me. The material is also sheer enough that you need to have a matching color bra or the color will show right through. Will only wear this in front of my bf."
2.0,"Looks nice and fit is good, but strap frayed immediately on both sides. Also the mask kept slipping down my wife's face on trying it on, so we had to return it."
2.0,Very see thru good for bathing suit cover up the slip makes the dress ugly
2.0,Returned because color was not as appeared in photo.
2.0,Material has stretch but very sheer and tighter than expected from pictures. Save your money
2.0,Does not stay on the ear. It bends very easy. Would not buy again.
2.0,Keep coming apart and have to put back in loop to wear.
2.0,"This is a real review from someone who paid full price for the item - I got the XL. I normally wear a size 14 or 16. Their size chart does not offer a waist size. I went by their size chart and determined that the dress should fit me, given the bust size. The waist is so incredibly tiny.. I'm measuring it around 22in!! My attached photo shows this dress alongside another XL dress that fits me comfortably.. you can see the incredible difference in the waist sizes. The dress is stretchy, I can get it on and it's very comfortable... But it makes me look like a bloated whale and because of how much the fabric and elastic have to stretch, it lightens the fabric around my stomach because it's stretched so thin. When I pulled the dress out of the package, I could immediately tell it was going to be way too small. The bust and sleeves fit fine, but from the chest down the dress looks and fits no bigger than a medium. I would only recommend this to someone half my size with a flat stomach. It's extremely unflattering."
2.0,"It is a beautiful ring! I just love honeybees; however, this ring gets caught on absolutely everything! Mine is only a week old and is so bent out of shape its unwearable. I wish it was a full ring instead of the adjustable. Save your money for something else"
2.0,"I'll preface my review by saying that this top is very cute and seemed like good quality.  I ordered my usual size, XL.  The issue is, the body of the shirt was way way too tight .....but ....the arms were way too big.  I have normal sized arms and the arms were very very loose and the strange part is that they were 8 inches too long for my normal size arms.  It could have just been a mistake with the one that I received .....but it has to be returned."
2.0,I ordered this in a XL in May and just now received it In August. I order these for myself I wear a 42 C after opening the package I knew right away they would not fit. They fit my daughter who is a 36B perfect.
2.0,"Although the fabric and style is nice, the sizing chart on the description is completely wrong. This skirt was huge! Best bet, if you want to order, is to order one in every size and keep the one that fits. I would not order this again, because the sizing and measurements are totally off. The seller needs to get a correct sizing chart so customers can order their size. It wasn't one size too big, but like 4 sizes too big."
2.0,"I really wish I liked this purse.  Is it what I ordered?  Yes.  Did it have a strong fake leather/plastic smell when I opened the box? No, at least not to my poor sense of smell.<br /><br />So why have I given it such a low rating?  It seems cheap, even for the low price.  It came with a dent at the bottom, which I assumed would just go away with time but hasn't yet (although I haven't filled the purse, so that's probably my fault).  Both the short handles and the long crossbody strap had stray threads when I received the bag, which doesn't really bother me but indicates quality (or lack thereof).  The purse has a very plastic-y feel, and while the zipper at the bottom is a nice decoration, there is not a compartment there and this is a disappointment to me.  The inside of the purse is very roomy, and the zippered pouch inside is nice to put things that easily get lost at the bottom of purses, however, I am nowhere near filling this purse up, and it is a little too big for my taste.  What frustrates me most is that it is very difficult to use this purse hands free.  The shorter straps are a little too short to wear it as a shoulder bag, and the size of the bag is a little too big to wear it as a crossbody bag without feeling incredibly awkward.  For this reason alone, I started looking for a new purse after the first couple of weeks of using it.  I don't mind carrying it around with one hand for short periods of time, but it is way too bulky to do this while grocery shopping, going for a walk, etc.  Additionally, in the first week of use, I somehow managed to get a few pen marks on the bag which do not want to come off (clearly my fault for using a pen in the vicinity of the purse, but still frustrating nonetheless and I've not had this problem with other bags).<br /><br />Overall, I feel like the quality is not great and I am disappointed with this purse.  I do not recommend this to anyone looking for a purse that can be slung over a shoulder or worn as a crossbody bag for hands free functionality."
2.0,"This shirt runs very large. Size down if you don't want it to drown you. The base color looks cream in the pic, but it is actually pink. It is not the same as picture."
2.0,Humm
2.0,The dress has a poofy fit due to the awkward stitching and material.
2.0,"This shirt looks like it would be loose and comfortable especially in the arm area. IT's tight, so be careful!"
2.0,"Was very cute but sized really skimpily.  I am normally a 6 and the S could not even be pulled up, also VERY short in length."
2.0,"I dont know how to make it look like it does in the picture with he crossed part. Also when i got it, it came broken so i had to superglue part of the fabric back together but it feels like its gonna break everytime i wear it"
2.0,"I Wore the pants twice and washed them once. When I put them on for the third time, there were 2 holes in the crotch seam of the pants.  It’s a shame because they are very soft and buttery feeling!"
2.0,I thought they were slip resistant but they're not and the sole wear down fast
2.0,"I like the style of this cardigan, but for the price, the fabric is quite cheap. I don’t know how long this will actually hold up.<br /><br />If you really want good coverage and draping, then I suggest you go up one size; however, the sleeves could be too long for you. For me, I wanted it to fit like in the picture, and it does."
2.0,"It's an ok looking watch box that feels substantial and has a well padded cushion for the watch (I wish the logo wasn't on the front). Unfortunately it stopped working after about 10 months of use, which is a recurring theme in these reviews. While it worked, it was usually quiet, but would occasionally squeak/grind. I would look elsewhere."
2.0,"Original 5 stars review: Tried it once and was very pleased. A great alternative to goggles costing three times as much.<br /><br />Updated review is 2 stars. The glasses are clear and comfortable, but the fastener does not hold which makes strap loose. Glasses leak now. I will try to repair the strap by mending ends of it."
2.0,1/2 of the jewels had fallen out by the time I received the labrets! Imagine what would happen to the other half if I steriled them or got them wet in any way.
2.0,Glue released after 10 miles
2.0,Super comfy but there were holes worn in them the first time I used them. Huge bummer. You get what you pay for. Super comfy lounge around the house pants.
2.0,"Product was a tad too small and if you're a more plus size woman, you may find this bra to be flimsy."
2.0,NOT AS NICE LOOKING AS THE PICTURE.
2.0,My daughter is a 10/12 and I ordered a 12 and it for more like a 7/8
2.0,The top was too long and the shape wasn't flattering. I returned it.
2.0,Did not like the support. Cheaply made and boobs fall over and out of the bra.i hate these bras. I love the quantity but quality not good for big heavy boobs. No support. Cheap construction. I should have returned them.
2.0,Not worth it. I had to use some glue to keep it together. The tails get always in the way.
2.0,"Too heavy. I couldn't even claim the product because, considering the weight, the shipping costs all the way to my country were humongously high! Double the price of the shoe. So I lost my money buying this shoe."
2.0,Lining falls apart after 4 months
2.0,"Very warm but large sizes are only for tall women, nothing to do with weight. Shoulders and waist are for slim women."
2.0,"I ordered a size larger than my usual and it was skin tight. They (the seller or Amazon?) credited me the cost of the item, though, hence the 2 stars."
2.0,"This dress was cute in theory, but the seam is in the front weird, there are no pockets which the picture implies there are and worst of all it was about 5&#34; too short, I am only 5'8&#34;"
2.0,"Returning this item. It is both too small and very thin. It can be seen through on any part that is white. Not a quality fabric at all. Also, the pockets lay weird which aggravates the fact that it runs small. Very unflattering."
2.0,Received in a bag. I paid over $100 for a pair of shoes I want a box. They were dented.
2.0,"For the Medium that I returned, they made me pay $16 in postage, when it was their sizing that is WAY OFF!.  I wear a Small, even the Large was too tight in the arms!"
2.0,My son has worn this coat for just a few weeks and the zipper is already broken.  I ordered early so that we had all our snow stuff ready for the winter and now have missed the return winter.  Very disappointing that I am out $65 dollars and now need to buy a new coat.
2.0,not worth $40 feels like a $5-$10 shirt. its thin as well so i dont know how much lint can be take off before it tears a hole in it
2.0,Marginal product
2.0,[[VIDEOID:ef84107921246244565452f863e65539]] These would’ve been great if they didn’t come ripped. I was planning on using them to keep my dogs from scratching. I can’t do that now that they are already ripped
2.0,The fabric reminded me of drapery fabric for curtains
2.0,"I was hoping the shirt would look like the one in the picture, but it doesn't. I liked how the material was very light for summer. I ended up just wearing it for a barn shirt considering it wasn't as cute as the one in the picture- my husband calls it my clown outfit because of the way the shirt fits :("
2.0,This shirt was way over sized for an adult
2.0,"Did not fit like expected at all, more like longer tshirt, super fitted in chest, arms and under breasts before flairing out. I ordered the size appropriate based off sizing chart and I feel like I should have sized up two sizes. Have lost more weight, and still very tight in chest and arms. Not a dress. I'm 5'8"" and 160 and hits right at upper thighs, rump area."
2.0,"I Like this, should not have those things between the nose though, they tend to leave an imprint on your nose."
2.0,Too small for US sizes.
2.0,"I dislike the fact that they are SUPER see through. I purchased two pairs, the black pair had a hole in them when I opened them. It was in the seams, guess it wasn't stitched together very well.<br /><br />On the bright side, they're comfortable but not acceptable to wear anywhere but the house."
2.0,"According to the product description, this was supposed to be red.  Well, it isn’t.  It’s blue.  I suppose there is some kind of prize for getting the image color correct, though it would be nice to have the description and image match.<br /><br />One thing that is not revealed on the image or description is that there is a large (non-US) brand name emblazoned across the front top flap of this holder.  I don’t care what company it is or if it’s US or non-US, I HATE brand names showing on products.  If the company wants me to advertise for them, they should pay me.  I have covered up the name with gaffer tape, but obviously that’s not optimal.<br /><br />Aside from that, the holder is OK.  It can hold a large iPhone in the sleeve under the flap and a passport in the zippered pouch.  There is space for ID on the front and you could also fit in a VERY small/thin wallet.<br /><br />There is a carabiner if you want to hang this from a belt loop or a backpack.  Alternatively, there is an adjustable-length nylon strap you can attach so that you can hang it around your neck or crossbody.  The strap is pretty flimsy; obviously not slice proof, but I wasn’t expecting that.<br /><br />If logos/product names emblazoned on products doesn’t offend you, this is an OK small holder.  I cannot attest to whether the RFID blocker actually works."
2.0,It's ok but it's definitely a tight fit for adults. It also doesn't look exactly like the mask on the picture and the material will make you hot. It's just not what I expected.
2.0,"Overall, this zip hoodie has good potential but it is made a bit ""off"". At first I thought maybe I'd selected a 3/4 length sleeve or something because it fit a little like that but not quite. Which makes for a slightly odd fit.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful!"
2.0,"I have purchased these Boss  gloves many times at local stores. The 12 pack of gloves I ordered on line and received bear the same name, number, size and description on the attached product description as the ones I bought at local stores, but are made with thinner material and do not have near the amount of thermal protection."
2.0,Color / pattern not as pictured.  I returned.
2.0,They were very tight compared to.ither brands
2.0,Poorly glued.
2.0,It’s an ok piece for the price for costume jewelry but it looks flimsy and doesn’t feel comfortable wearing it - like it’s going to break
2.0,"These are lightweight and have nice tread. However, the molding lines around the toe area weren't trimmed, and won't be comfortable unless I can fix it. I don't think I should have to be repairing a new shoe. Also, the label appears to be adhered with rubber cement because it pulls right off, showing the great care that went into making these fine shoes. Half price might be reasonable. Very disappointed!"
2.0,The chain is too short!
2.0,Too small and she didn't like it.
2.0,I ordered the shirt in a 3x and it came in as a large marked 3x cool graphics though
2.0,Inserts that were supposed to come with this shoe did not and it was much too wide. I  Expected a better shoe for the money
2.0,"I'm a smedium. This top is much bigger than actual size. Seems to be good quality, I should have returned but now use as a house shirt."
2.0,"These pants look shiny, plastic, and cheap.  You only want these pants for yoga or exercise.  Do not spend this much to buy cheap looking exercise pants. If you want pants like this find some that cost less.  One star means I hate them and I do because I didn't buy them for exercise but I gave them two stars because I do plan to keep them for exercise. I would send them back but it's too much hassle.  Do not buy these pants for this price."
2.0,"Don't work for me. I had such high hopes. I was so hoping these would help and make mask more comfortable to wear on a 12 hr shift let alone 8 hours but didn't do it.  Difficult to get attached to mask doesn't stay connected my glasses still fogged up, actually made my mask slid off my nose more than usual"
2.0,This bag is SMALL! It seems very nicely built. It is nowhere near 45L. My pre-schooler will be using this bag it is so small.
2.0,we is my refund
2.0,Cute stuff but really flimsy  and kinda cheaply made.
2.0,Really pretty and comfortable but breaks easily on the clamp part
2.0,Didn't receive what I expected
2.0,"Short is cute , but it runs smaller than actual size. You will need to go up one or two sizes up. Depending how you like to wear your shirts !!"
2.0,This dress didn’t sit well anywhere on my body. Made me look frumpy and not flattering as all.
2.0,Only red lights work on one of the shoes.
2.0,The gold part faded and turned a very hard copper/brownish color in a day or two. The bottom piece also keeps rotating.
2.0,Fabric was a little to cheap and the print wasn't as vibrant as it looked in the picture.
2.0,"The pearls are flat, not round like they look on the photo. Look cheap and poorly made."
2.0,"Im an average sized 23 year old male. I'm not big, but not really small. This bracelet is too small for me and there is no option for a bigger size. The bracelet is designed very nicely, but because I can't get one big enough, I won't give it 5 stars. It barely fits my fiance who is a very small woman."
2.0,"The kit did not come with a wand. It did come with the scarf, necklace, tattoo and glasses"
2.0,The quality is extremely cheap. Dont waste your time or money buying this. Literally threw it out.
2.0,It seamed cheep
2.0,Made my ears turn green
2.0,"Material feels very cheap, thin and not structured at all. Will return them"
2.0,The quality is a little less than expected. Very thin and not soft. Will try extra downy softener.
2.0,"These earrings came on time<br />But they were very cheaply constructed and when I first got them and I had to use a tool to help put back in the stone that fell out. Even after that, there was rattling I could hear because the stones were loose. Never again fr this seller. Also the latching was crap"
2.0,I thought these were going to be silver but they have a gold/brass tone.  The hooks are extremely thick and I can't put in my ear holes without pain and burning.  Very pretty but I wouldn't advise unless you're used to wearing heavy earrings and your ear holes are stretched.
2.0,"I liked the look of these when I put them on, but as I always do, when checking for transparency I found these about as opaque as a pair of medium denier pantyhose.  I did not even have to bend to tell I was nude under them.  Not good.  Also, the back seam is weak."
2.0,Nice looking belt but leather started to wear out after 6 months of just wearing this to work. Expected it to last longer.
2.0,Was surprised how Small they are! Don't know if I will ever wear Them😨😰
2.0,I expected this to be bigger and have a handle as pictures suggested.
2.0,"but not for any type of workout. I ordered the light gray & the color is exactly as shown. It actually fit just fine until I moved. There is absolutely no support whatsoever. I see lots of comments and pics showing and saying that it has good support, however women like myself who have sagginess in the breast due to age & having kids, need support. It appears to be made for ladies with small &/or perky breasts. The material is great, no see through and very soft.  Great idea but poor execution."
2.0,Not good as expected and shown on line pic
2.0,I gave points for the colors and the fact that they do work.  Unfortunately the clips broke on every single one within a week of attaching to my dogs collar.
2.0,"I wish the dress was longer. I get it's a mini dress, but the hem barely covers my booty when standing still and when I walk around... its s show. I read the reviews and ordered a large. Honestly do not think an XL would have helped. I am 5'4""  and a size 8. I gave 2 starts because the dress is comfortable. I however, will not be wearing it."
2.0,These sure didn't look like they did in the ad. Fit was odd.
2.0,Fits too tight around even a small 3 year old head.
2.0,Hard to keep on.
2.0,"For the price, I didn't expect exceptional quality, but I was highly disappointed at how &#34;cheap&#34; the material felt."
2.0,"I bought these for my son because his sports glasses kept falling off.  The rubber pieces on these straps don't hold on to his glasses, they just slide right off.  I had to remove them and use the metal clips to attach to his glass to keep them on."
2.0,It feels like I’m wearing long Johns no softness
2.0,The watch is very cheap for what it cost and I was expecting much better quality.  I thought I was buying a Swatch watch but in fact it was not.  The Rind stones do not line up with the numbers so it is very difficult to set the correct time.  In general the watch is really not worth the money and I was buying a watch and did not need a towel.  I would not recommend this item
2.0,Don't have butt support like it said in description.  They are comfortable and fit well.... just didn't do no more for me than the good Lord gave me!! Would not have bought them if I could had tried them on 1st. But you live and learn.
2.0,just wasn't what I expected
2.0,"The elastic/drawstring on the darker shorts in the photos is dark grey or black.  What I got had white elastic and drawstring, which looks terrible.  What you see is not what you get."
2.0,Very thin.  Won't know how much my husband will like it until this summer when we take it on vacation.
2.0,"I think this would be a homerun, if there were a way for someone with an upper body to put it on!  With no zipper, there was no way for me to get it over my arms.  It is really cute and would have been a great summer piece, just be aware when ordering."
2.0,"The item was well priced and arrived in perfect condition with installation pins, and in a timely fashion, however: This is not (nor was it advertised as) an original Swatch brand band. The plastic has a different softer (to me 'slimier') feel to it. But, the real problem is that although it fit the swatch perfectly, it is shorter than the original band. It barely gets around my wrist, and there's not enough band to tuck under the loop. Not comfortable to wear. Keeping it only because I'm not willing to pay the shipping price to return it."
2.0,I dont like this
2.0,Material is cheap and looks really weird on. probably wont wear again except around the house.
2.0,"Two stars for cute colors/designs.  They were a bit big.  I got two pairs and returned this one, keeping the other one for a few months till my daughter grows into them.  She really like the strawberries design on the pair that we kept.  However, they look very delicate and like they'd be difficult to clean.  For $45 to $50 a pair of toddler shoes, I would expect to be able to clean them easily and have them hold up under cleanings.  I'm guessing these won't."
2.0,They feel loose and the backs barely fir
2.0,product used and came dirty
2.0,"I'm not above wearing a cheap piece of clothing once in a while, but the thin, limp, somewhat misrepresented character of this tunic blouse on top of a $27 price tag is just wrong. The rolled-up sleeves and tab NEVER work together and never look like the photo. I tried seven times. Anyone know what a schmatteh is? It's New Yorkese for ""rag."" How do you say ""rag"" in Chinese?"
2.0,Ended up not using them because they looked like they would get stuck and rip luggage in an airport.  They would be good however for identifying equipment or carry on luggage.
2.0,"Very flimsy and cheaply made, but you get what you pay for. One of the arms broke on the second day. :("
2.0,Not put together as well as I would have liked.  Runs really small.  Beautiful material. Took care of me as far as return
2.0,"I ordered a size large (I typically run between a med/large or size 12) and it was way too small. Especially in the hips. My husband tried it on (he’s 5’11”, med build 175lbs and it was too small on him too. It’s also really short. Lastly, it’s polyester so like a track suit, definitely not like pjs. But overall if the sizing was right the quality isn’t bad."
2.0,The hem is off changes the whole look of the dress.
2.0,"Fogs up in glasses and sunglasses, pointless. Upscured vision bad"
2.0,Very flimsy plastic but the metal is sturdy. A lot of the plastic pieces broke in half while trying to screw them onto the metal.
2.0,Only one sided and constantly flips over to the cheap looking side
2.0,They were beautiful. But it was too thick to fit through my nose piercing
2.0,I wanted to give more stars but the nose came broken. The fit is not bad.
2.0,Did not fit as expected.  Larger than what I was looking for.
2.0,My sweatshirt was damaged
2.0,"The owl and tassel looked for cheap and flimsy. The wallet was cute and so was the bracelet. However the metal on the bracelet was a rose gold and the metal on the wallet is silver. It was my misunderstanding on this. Overall, I wasn’t happy with my purchase so I returned the item."
2.0,I returned this product because I didn't like how it looked on. The dress was a little big for what I thought a large would be. I would've kept if it was just a little bit smaller.
2.0,Too small nit as soft as other pj I have. Not very good color either.
2.0,i need a return label as the sidlinx glass leashes donot fix
2.0,"It is beautiful, but mine was broken in one spot and missing a rhinestone in another. May buy again and hope for one that isn’t damaged.<br /><br />Update: the second one came, and it was broken too. :("
2.0,Made for a child. Was way too small for adults.
2.0,Didn't like how it looked on me. It was very itchy too.
2.0,Was expecting these to be larger they are tiny
2.0,I bought these for my son he wore them while we were in Texas on vacation. They fit great how ever they frayed and one ended up with a hole in them so we had to throw them away before our vacation was over.
2.0,The bottoms were more cheeky than I would like and the top was very small. I ordered a small like I always do and wear in swim suits and across the board it was just too small. Sent it back.
2.0,Size smaller then normal and quality not the brst
2.0,"The chest area was too short I wish longer, my boob is able to pop out of the bottom. Really cute though"
2.0,Looked nice and is as discribed but way too tight for my head so can't use it. I don't think I have a head that would be considered big so it might only fit people with those of smaller than average heads.
2.0,"The bottoms fit great, the top was a little snug and after wearing them one time the top has a huge hole in it. So the quality apparently isn't that great"
2.0,For.the.price it's.what you pay for.the so.called leather strap is.only.leather form the pendant up.about one inch the rest of it is a sturdy plastic you get what you pay for.the metal is Pewter and is for the most.part ok but not.a.show piece
2.0,"This dress is so cute in the picture and looks good on some of the reviewers but it was 100 different kinds of wrong for me. 5'3, 124 lbs, 34C and I ordered the small. The dress itself fit more or less but it was not flattering. It was just a box basically that the tie was supposed to give some shape. I am petite but pretty curvy and the tie just wasn't enough to draw in the waist and the fabric just bubbled in really unflattering ways. I also hate the fabric itself, it is rough and thick and horrible. Even though the dress itself fit, the elastic in the arms was really tight and made my arms, which are pretty average/thin, bulge out over the elastic. I was so uncomfortable and awkward, this dress is definitely going back. There is a tiny chance that maybe a medium would fit the arms better, but I feel like the rest of the dress would be too big. Not for me, but might work for taller girls or less curvy body types."
2.0,It rides up and bunches around my waist.
2.0,Like it and all but I also got one with those marks
2.0,Runs very small. Poor quality fabric.
2.0,Dislike for my granddaughter. The fit was not good. She has narrow feet and ankles.<br />The leather was good.
2.0,"Very cute, my daugther LOVES them however the velcro is coming off the side of the shoe.. and they dont stay velcroed.. hopefully they will last a while, but not very happy with the produce wont order from them again!"
2.0,The hat and graphic are not high quality. It functions as a hat. Fits ok.
2.0,"Got this for my daughter's 16th birthday. She loved it! The only problem was the band broke at the bottom. We had to pay a jeweler to solder it. When i tried to contact to seller they told me they did sell that ring any more and couldnt replace it. Beware!<br /><br />It is cheap costume jewelry, so I guess you get what you pay for but you would hope it would hold up s bit better than a gum ball machine ring."
2.0,I am not sure what is under the fabric is some magnet or is just a rubber band wrapped in fabric. I did not feel any difference when I wears it
2.0,"the lenses are too dark.  the frame and style is cool and i would say it's worth the price but still, cant see not worth it"
2.0,Wasn't too happy about it. My son has chunky fit and Velcro wouldn't stay closed. Also his toes would slide out in the front due to a big opening. Very easy to trip and fall. Wouldn't buy it again. He ended up wearing them only a couple of times. Quality of the product is good.
2.0,It fit as tho 2 sizes smaller.
2.0,"These are soft for sure and have the potential of being comfy. But only if your feet are on the slim to narrow side. I am a 9M size and length and widthwise these fit well except, the straps were too short.  If I wanted to wear them comfortably, I would have had a 1.5-2 in strip of Velcro around the ankle strap still visible. No thank you. These get 2⭐ from me because the sole is as soft and comfortable as my Keen Whisper sandals. The design however, leaves a lot to be desired."
2.0,"THE SIDE POCKETS ARE SEWED SHUT!!! The have the internal part of the pocket, but are sewed completely shut!!!! Put them on for a run this. Morning at 0430 and had no place  to put my keys or my phone!!!!! 🤬🤬🤬"
2.0,They're pretty they're just much smaller than I thought they would be. They should be listed as children's.
2.0,"I bought 2 of these (thanks prime day) one in red and white the other in navy. The red and white fits nice and the material is just ok. the navy, even though the exact same size is way too small..  too tight.... too short and the material is stiffer and has zero stretch. Very disappointed  as I was looking forward to having the navy to wear to the office."
2.0,Love the dress!  Runs too small. Buy up 1 or 2 sizes.  Very cute though.
2.0,"I ended up returning this product...really liked the design and fit of the body of the suit, but sleeves were way way too loose."
2.0,not like the top in the picture.  I received a plain tube top.  Where are the sleeves
2.0,Not comfortable for me. Plugs are long so they kinda sit in your ears funny. I replaced mine and gave these to the trash. These will only work if you have thick earlobes
2.0,The fabric is too thin. The dress does not have a full swing.
2.0,"This jogger run big, I’m 5,3 and 115pounds order small, they came baggy, had to return them. Color and dye tie came cute."
2.0,"For the most part, I could really like these, but they have a design flaw in that when folded closed, the temple ends hit the inside of the lens, scratching them. I'm going to put molefoam on the ends that rest behind the ear in an attempt to reduce further damage to the lenses."
2.0,"May be a harsh 2 stars.  I would be happy to change this to a five star but the app is terrible and the pairing works only after 10 minutes of troubleshooting every night.  If the software improves, I will update my review.  Otherwise great concept just wish the app was better."
2.0,The elastic on the legs is tight. Too tight. They are made too small to fit comfortably. Disappointed.
2.0,This tie pretty much fell apart after one wear. I would never order this type of tie again. It was needed for a Christmas program at my sons school and it wasn't put together properly.
2.0,Nice ring. Too bad the stones tend to fall out.
2.0,These are made of cheap nylon and the fit is weird. They're basically just thin fabric and stitching is ripping already.
2.0,"After a couple of days, the silicone started to split and they became unusable."
2.0,The zipper and handle unfortunately fell apart in no time
2.0,Too thick and short
2.0,"Is now unwearable, the first wear it was super cute, but after one wash on cold it is totally unwearable and too short"
2.0,This was a gift for my daughter and I was so disappointed that the round Elvis pendent hangs to low in the moon and you can’t move it up so that you can see Elvis.  So very disappointed!
2.0,very bummed it said it wouldn't turn finger green and it totally did ;( i loved this ring.
2.0,It is very beautiful and I really loved it. But only after one week of very minimum use the beads have already started falling off.
2.0,"Thought I would be able to wear it outdoors, so I did! Turns out, no supportive material on the bottom so a hole went straight through! Like seriouslly!?"
2.0,Opened then up and took them out. Looked good for the price you pay. Stretched them a little with my hands and the one part snapped. It is simply glued together....So yeah no.
2.0,So long and so thin
2.0,Has dragons on it wearing it as a dressing gown
2.0,The material is not of real denim. It looks cheap and is very tight. Not for &#34;curvy&#34; bodies or those with large chests. I would suggest going up a size or two.
2.0,The top piece of this bikini is horrible.  You cannot adjust and it was not sewn properly.  Not worth the money
2.0,"It's an OK fabric but the shirt is 2 in shorter than what the description says.  I ordered Medium and it was supposed to be 28"" long and the shirt is not even 26.5"".  The fit is not flattering at all either. The font is also bigger than on the pictures."
2.0,The design is exactly what I was looking for but the finish was flawed.
2.0,"They are nice and soft....but you can see through them. I suppose for one who wants yoga pants for at home wear, these would be great. That, however, was not my intention when I purchased these. Size chart/s in the photos are very inconsistent, and so I ordered what this color's size said would fit. They fit well enough since I am losing weight, knowing I would be able to wear as inches are lost, but were just a bit too small for me currently. But I shouldn't be able to see through my yoga pants. So I am returning them. Won't be buying again."
2.0,"Someone wrote a review calling this a “sweater” for his girlfriend. 🤦‍♀️  It’s a very light weight, thin shirt you could wear in even warm weather.  It is probably $5 worth of material.  Nice arm length and covers my butt. Cheap stitching that I’m not expecting to hold up.  I’m tall, 5,8 180lbs.  The fit is ok.  It would make for a nice fall shirt under a flannel shirt or whatnot."
2.0,"My grand children was to receive a pair of glasses each. Unfortunately, only one pair was sent. This is why I only gave two stars. They work daily on a chrome book and now I must  reorder or let it go. I am making up my mind. I normally do not have this type  of problem. I keep checking my order to see if I made a mistake. Yet, I was charged for two and only got one."
2.0,Sure doesn't look like the pic
2.0,The look is cute but it is already tearing apart which takes away from the look immensely.
2.0,it was delivered on time but the sleeves were way too tight and after one washing and I made the mistake of putting it in the dryer..i could even squeeze my wrist through the sleeve after that.
2.0,"These 2 hats are quite different. The black hat is a weathered material & feels like it has been processed in some sort of chemical. It’s very small as well, even with the adjustable back. The camo hat is bigger & seems to be made of a nylon type, lightweight material. It’s comfortable. I’ll wear that one but get rid of the black."
2.0,"Be sure & read their size chart and add 1 size up.  I wear a large (12-14), ordered xlarge and it was much too small. So disappointed, will not order this brand again."
2.0,"Ordered these during a sale. They took a long time to arrive which I was OK with. They look good right out of the package. The fur and leather are as described and seem like decent quality. The sole of the shoe is the problem. It is so stiff that you can't walk normally in them. They ""clomp"" - make a slapping noise - every time you step. And the fur covering the sole feels very thin with no padding. It is like walking with wooden boards hanging off your feet. I will probably throw these in the trash or possibly return them."
2.0,Too much coverage.
2.0,"Doesn't fit diameter of backing properly, can see glue around edges. Can see edges of backing plate isn't completely batched up properly with stone. Still pretty though, quality is lacking in the workmanship."
2.0,pinchy pinchy
2.0,I thought this would be what it appears to be. Seems more suitable for skinny teen boys then men. Not a bad product just not suited for what we wanted.
2.0,shiny.  The seams don't stretch with the pants.  On the thin side.
2.0,Okay so the product wasn't that bad. Actually the product was good. But unfortunately I didn't get the one I wanted (bottom right in picture). All because California has once again made their 9 millionth law which bands the company from making credit card inserts anymore. So the seller is selling off the last of the stock and items are limited. Thanks California!
2.0,[[VIDEOID:3999bc831cd8358e6ed9b38e45e72768]] I wore this to a wedding . I ABSOLUTELY love the design of the pants but I’m gave them 2 stars only because the pants did not make it through the day . The inner thigh area is completely destroyed. I wish I could’ve been able to get more than one wear of the pants but sadly I have to throw them in the trash . The pants is not see through so you don’t have to worry about that . These pants are for some one who has a gap between their legs .
2.0,It didn’t fit right. Much cuter on the model:(
2.0,Lights up and looks really cool BUT it’s made of very thin plastic and can’t cracked
2.0,"Sleeves are much too tight on the jacket, and the pants have an unusual cut that don't fit that well."
2.0,They are cool. Very bright but one of the fingers quit working within the first 30 min of play time. 7 yr old and 4 year old.
2.0,"Very cheaply made and looks cheap as well. Pendant is ok, necklace is dollar store quality."
2.0,Product doesn’t really look like the images.
2.0,The lock is a magnet that easily opens. Beware. Lost mine.
2.0,By the look of their image the bandanas don’t look like your typical standard bandana. The blue one especially looks as if there are different shades of blue. The colors look more muted overall. That is why I purchased them. Nope. They’re your standard bandanas. There is nothing interesting about them.
2.0,Two stars because arrived with dirt on the sleeve
2.0,I had to return because the material was too thin.
2.0,Low quality and barely fit. I went a Medium even though I'm originally small and it still fit way too tight.
2.0,Does not catch the clippings well.
2.0,Got 5 of the avocado 🥑 pin and multiples of others. Not worth it for a couple of the same pins.
2.0,Very low quality. Donated it
2.0,Me agrada el producto pero en 2 ocasiones lo pido y me mandan tallas inferiores a las que pido
2.0,"Very tiny, not like the picture"
2.0,These were a miss for me. The sole are very hard plastic/rubber with no give. The strap that holds your foot in place is thin flexible plastic with lots of give... so the shoes felt extra wobbly and unstable.  My foot would not stay in. They also run a little small.  I am a true size 8 and these were too small for me by a half size.
2.0,Nice looking but two of the rings tarnished quickly and turned my finger green.
2.0,"Fine bag, but I didn't personally like the style when I saw it in person, so I returned it for a full refund."
2.0,Did not fit as expected. Returned!
2.0,"Cute idea but cut is weird.  The neckline is supposed to point in toward the collar bone, but it lays awkward."
2.0,The wallet is sleek but there is a  major for low in its design. You will easily drops cards from its outside pocket and finally added a Velcro to prevent its happening.
2.0,"Although the product was of good quality, 3 stars were deducted because I was sent a used product despite being advertised as new. All the tags were removed and there were awful deodorant stains."
2.0,Too tight around the bust. Returned it.
2.0,"The fit is horrible. I ordered xl and had to give the shirt to my 12 year old it was so small,  these sizes are not for average sized people order already 2 sizes larger"
2.0,"As previous reviewers have stated, these look pretty cheap.  The lines between colors are more pronounced...NOT the rich solid appearance that is shown in the pictures. They might be worth the $11.00 I paid, but not the final cost of over $16.00 paid after shipping & handling.<br /><br />Note: Another thing that bothers me, but which I did not deduct points for, if they show the original price to be $49.99, now priced at $11.99 = 77% discount.  That is complete BS... these in no way are worth anywhere near $49.99."
2.0,The red bead wasn't very red. It looked pretty cheap.  The fish looked a little cheap too.  The rest I liked.
2.0,Was not an off the shoulder top. It was clearly a vneck
2.0,Very heavy and cheap looking. Wanted to return but I lost it before I could. This is NOT for ladies even though it showed up in women's search.
2.0,"The initial disappointment with this product came with the discovery that the chain portion in the front is attached in such a way that it cannot be moved or adjusted. In the pictures, it seemed to indicate that it could be used as a partial choke chain (yes, we’re that kind of people, and no, it wasn’t bought for a dog). Aesthetically, it’s fine, but after only a few hours’ wear, the material on the back caused my wife’s neck to itch and break out. We’ve since replaced it with something more suitable, but this is really only good for a short time, maybe for night-clubbing, not for daily wear or any activity that would bring it in contact with sweat or outside moisture."
2.0,The screw that holds the pin threw the ear came out trash
2.0,they did not fit right not as large as I wanted arm broke and was not pleased at all won't buy again
2.0,"Very cute, fits perfectly, any kind of silver that it used to be is gone now and it is copper color.  Too bad really liked this ring."
2.0,The material is that of a rash guard .. We ordered a small it is kinda long so my daughter tied it up in the front it looked cute .We washed it once and no peeling yet . She said she wasn't going to wear it again and wishes it was cotton.
2.0,Kind of cheap looking. But there ok
2.0,"Fits fine, just very very thing material. I’m 5’1 and about 100lbs. Bought small"
2.0,The skirt don’t look like that at all it’s long and lose the shirt does fit as expected tho
2.0,Broke off on first day wearing it
2.0,"Was way to big and very long, also the cheapest material ever…."
2.0,"I guess u get what u pay for here....  Hubby thought these would be a nice replacement for our last set...  Boy was he wrong!!!!  Cheap feel, cheap look, even cheap metal... All around pretty much crap. Probably a good gift for a pre-teen... Also one thing the seller doesn't point out, the watches are made and ordered from CHINA!!!  The instructions are in Chinese!!!!  AND there's no residing because it's so cheap. My jeweler even laughed at me when I asked if the metal was even stainless steal like described!!!!  What a joke!"
2.0,Cheap slippery fabric
2.0,These are just a narrow strip of fabric that slides up your head when wet.  Waste of money
2.0,Very well made but the waist is HUGE! I love the look but I have to pleat the waist to get the belt on. I would only recommend these if you have a 40” waist or larger.
2.0,"It's a nice chain, but made me break out in a rash. I don't think the white gold overlay is as thick as they say"
2.0,Very cheap looking and flimsy.
2.0,They are cute but I thought the bow would be larger
2.0,"I love the pants for the price, BUT!!!!! The vendor of the product apparently is consistently sending out the wrong size. I ordered an XL and received a 3XL.<br /><br />I am returning the wrong sized ones in hopes of getting the XL ones. For the price it seems still worth it. It’s a medium quality but awesome comfy set of pants with just the right amount of stretch"
2.0,Very beautiful indeed but 1 week after i received them the ball broke off when I was taking them out bummer
2.0,"I was so excited to find truffle oil without aroma or synthetic flavor, unlike most truffle oil on the market these days. But alas, it had expired in 2016. Maybe no retailer makes real truffle oil anymore?"
2.0,"This is a very wide glass case. It looks nice, but my glasses are lost in the case. I will say that they probably would be good for sunglasses."
2.0,"White skirt was see through, had to return. The fit/style was so cute though."
2.0,"These are gorgeous, but the reason I gave this item a &#34;2&#34; is because my lobster clasp was welded closed. Luckily, I make jewelry sometimes and had the tools to cut the bad clasp off and have a good quality one on hand and attach it. Otherwise, really pretty."
2.0,"I’m 5’9 with 44” hips and a 32” waist.  I bought a large but a medium would most likely have been better.  The skirt is definitely long enough.  I have washed it once and still rolled the waistband so it hits my ankles (I have a 34” inseam).<br /><br />My problem with the skirt is that after sitting for an hour, the front is stretched at the knees.  It looks like baggy sweats when I stand up.  There are finger stretch marks poking out from where I held it to put it on.<br /><br />I like the idea of cotton and fair trade, but the fabric needs something to allow it to keep its shape."
2.0,"Nice material, nice hoodie. The medium fits like an xsmall though. Very dissatisfied I can't wear it."
2.0,Fits kinda weird. Back of my head is usually left cold.
2.0,It's too cheap looking to wear.
2.0,Beautiful shoe. My son loved them. Unfortunately the front rubber separated off the shoe after only one month. We only use these as school shoes so not a lot of heavy sports play. Disappointing quality.
2.0,The swimsuit was cute but as soon as it got wet it became loose and stretched. I had to throw away the top but kept the top.
2.0,Looked cheap. The stones are kind of ugly.
2.0,"If you do not have a nickel allergy, this is fine is and is a lovely bracelet.  However, if you have the allergy, it is a good idea to avoid it."
2.0,"Odd, tight fit. Not as expected. No stretch."
2.0,"I loved these rings at first all though they were very small, but after a while they started to turn my fingers green and the diamonds started falling out!! Very sad!!"
2.0,"These are described wrong! I bought the ones for 4-5 year old and they’re more like from 2-3 year old!<br />Also they make it impossible to return especially if you don’t drive!<br />Most the items I’ve ever had to send back they make it easy for UPS to pickup with a ready made label, but I’d have to pay $6 for that to happen which is ridiculous if you see the price of the socks!"
2.0,"I gave this two stars because the body blouse was awful and I was sent a worn body blouse top the crouch on the top had someone's dried secretion in it, it grossed me out.  I cut the crouch part out and above it because the top matches the pants I will wear a sleeveless velvet blouse over the top to show the sleeves on the blouse that matches the pants.  This should have never been sent out to anyone, do not know how this could have happened.  But very disgusting, nasty, and nauseating.  Please, do not let this happen again to anyone.  Just typing this make me want to throw up.  The pants was very nice, fitted good, I am 5'10, 155 pounds and the pants was long enough.  I would have given a four star because I loved the pants."
2.0,Did not like the size of it.
2.0,The bathing suit is nice but it is not push up if you wear A cup
2.0,"The material of this dress wasn’t comfortable or flattering. The top squished my chest down and the bottom was very full. Also, hard to wear a bra with the thin strap that’s across the back."
2.0,I read the reviews about this bathing suit before I bought it and understood that it ran small. I am 5'10 and 120lbs. I ordered their &#34;medium&#34; which is apparently between sizes (12-14). It was most definitely not. I should've ordered the large and who knows if that would even fit me. Don't buy less than a medium unless you are a child...
2.0,I was under the impression that these were gonna be black
2.0,"Really cute, but its cut super SMALL."
2.0,Bedroom slippers mainly…not fit for outdoor use.
2.0,No shape like the picture shows and fabric has no stretch.
2.0,"I am hoping to lose enough weight to fit into it, but for now can't zip it up. Needs to be sized by waist not bust size."
2.0,"I was expecting it to be real silver but it’s stainless steel and the chain is metal too, it’s getting kind of rusty looking."
2.0,Arrived with several of the larger rhinestones loose in the bag.  Thankfully my wrist is quite small or it wouldn't fit.<br />Not happy with the quality.
2.0,"This belt looks nice enough, but it is way too stretchy. I have to stretch it an absurd amount extra and loop the loose end all the way around through an extra belt loop just to get it tight enough. And it is not that it is too large of a belt, even a shorter one would require some crazy stretching to get any tightness."
2.0,Loved the way it shone and glittered but should have been made out of real metal not aluminium or whatever that material is.
2.0,I loved them until they faded the first day.
2.0,I'm so disappointed and upset! I am 5'11 and I ordered this dress according to the measurements described for this dress and it is still was too small.  The length described is way off from the dress I just received.  I waited for a good while excited to wear this dress.  The material is ok but the measurements are definitely off!  I must return it!
2.0,Difficult to get cotton gloves. Needed for my split fingers from Tennis in cold weather. Use then during sleep with lotion.
2.0,Fit like a necklace not a chocker.
2.0,Cheap knit.  Ok for lounging around house but far different then what was expected.
2.0,I wanted to use this as a gift but I am not confident they will hold up. They were delivered in pieces inside the box. Backs not on the earrings. Earring and hooks separated. Disappointing. Price is too good to be true
2.0,"I got these to wear at my wedding and found out when they arrived, they are really unattractive when you wear them.  They were not as comfortable as I was hoping either."
2.0,"the print was very nice and the material was good quality , BUT the top part was made way too short so the darts were completely above the bust line so you can’t even just wear the waist high like an empire waist line!"
2.0,Pants have strings getting undone at the bottom and runs way too small. My daughter usually wears a 6x so i got her a 7 and they look like high waters on her and the sleeves come above her wrist.  If it fit her i would actually love it. Even with the strings coming lose.
2.0,I only had this ring for a few weeks until the gem popped out and I had to throw it away.
2.0,Ordered 2 sizes up and fit is okay still a bit small. It would be a very good swimsuit if the cheapo logo that is glued on didn't come off after the first wearing. And of course left a big glue stain. I don't recommend these. Nice suit if you leave off the crappy logo.
2.0,I appreciate the idea of this jacket but it’s poorly executed. My zipper broken after wearing one time. It’s not durable for work out. Don’t waste your money.
2.0,its not like picture
2.0,"Very small, so i gave it to my teenage daughter"
2.0,I like that the pants look cute but they don’t fit correctly.
2.0,The product came in broken
2.0,too short wanted a longer cuff
2.0,They are not easy to get on. Husband did not like them.
2.0,The material was very thin.  Ended up returning.
2.0,Fits but is missing buttons and they weren’t B in the package it came in .. meaning I was sent this cute outfit with no buttons.
2.0,Sizing at least two sizes difference. Very cheaply made. Quite disappointed with this purchase.
2.0,I was excited to get these masks however when I received them and tried one on it rolled down showing the white inside of it.  I guess thats the bad part of it being seamless.  But to me it looks like all I would have to do is find a pretty design on a shirt sleeve and cut it out and I would be about the same quality.
2.0,"this is really cheap quality, If I could return it I would but its quite sheer and if it gets wet or you are in a humid environment its hard to get off. The picture looks better than the product"
2.0,I normally wear a large to extra-large I ordered this in a 2X it was too small decided to keep and give to my teenage daughter. Bought a second one and a 5X and it is still tight I would not recommend this product
2.0,"Not a sweatshirt, thin material. Fits tighter than expected- I order and XL thinking it would be bigger and baggy and it is NOT. It’s almost an uncomfortable fit. Color was way off, it’s a mustard, not tan. Not even close to tan."
2.0,Didn’t like the buckles because they were expensive to replace and seemed weak.  On first ride kick starter slipped off of my foot and ripped a BIG hole in side of boot!!
2.0,I had purchased these because I loved the lenses.  I keep them in the case it came with at all times when not wearing them.  I have to dots right where my eyes are.  They smudged and loom horrible now.  I would like a refund but the time for that is over.
2.0,This sweater was much shorter than the picture shows and the color is almost pale yellow instead of off white. I'm so very disappointed in this garment.
2.0,Flattering design.  Cheaply made.  Clung in back due to limited material used. Runs slightly small.  Black material is not the same as the top material.  Should have been about 1” longer
2.0,El encaje de la espalda no queda como se espera. Demasiado suelto
2.0,Way shorter than the picture
2.0,"Didn't like the material,looks cheep,and too long...Wrong size....."
2.0,Photo on the model is deceiving. Most definitely not shown is the white stitching which sticks out like a sore thumb against a green/brown fabric. This also cuts about mid thigh on me. No where near the knee. Going back.
2.0,look pretty on. but I CAN'T get one of them off!!! I think i'm going to have to resort to wire cutters...not happy about that.
2.0,It's cute but breaks super easily since the chain is so little. I ended up buying a new chain to replace the existing one and really just used the charm.
2.0,"It’s not very comfortable to wear.  It feels cheap.  It’s like it was made from spun plastic.  I gave it away. I believe it’s made from polyester entirely. Although, it is pretty."
2.0,"Cute watch, but it doesn't work. The second hand wasn't moving."
2.0,This dress fits very small. The wrap didn't cover my lower waist or legs and you will definitely need a slip or undershirt because it doesn't cover the breast area either.
2.0,Only printed on one side. And way over priced. Buyer beware.
2.0,What can I say.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Ordered in March 2020.  School closed like a month later.  Zipper blows out in second week of new school year. Backpack was by no means overfilled.  Spend another 20 bucks and get something better
2.0,"I'm usually a size 6 or 8 in pants depending on the fit, so I got a size medium in the Yissang pants.  There was no size chart when I ordered the pants, and I am usually a medium.  These pants run very small...so small that I could not pull them up all the way.  In the seller's pictures the pants look like they would have a straight leg, but the material is very fluid and swishes back and forth.  There was also no price listed when I ordered these pants so I cannot comment on the value for your money."
2.0,"Bought two pairs, the gold and the silver. The pens shape is nice and seems durable. The coating is not great. The silver lens has started fading and easily gets scratched."
2.0,"Fit was weird, maybe if I would have gone another size up it would have been better. But it fit fine around the waist and back side but the front right below the waist area was too tight and didn’t hang right. Also very thin."
2.0,"I purchased the cherub sweatshirt. I had previously purchased the black sun, moon, stars sweatshirt, and I liked it very much. The sizing was good on that one, but I do agree with other reviewers that these are basically just long sleeve tshirts that look like a sweatshirt. The two were supposed to be the same size. This cherub one is gigantic!!! I put the black one on top of it and it’s got 4 extra inches of fabric in each arm, and 8 extra inches around the middle. The arms are also short on the cherub one. So if you want a GIANT tshirt—this is the one for you. I fully recommend the black sun, moon, stars one as long as you know it’s a very light layer, like a long sleeve tshirt."
2.0,"The shoes fit perfect abd they are really very comfortable BUT, the soles are so soft the heels part already, un a month, are with a hole and that is walking on a laminated wood floor inside my home. What a pity! I wish they we’re built much resistan to use."
2.0,"Nice, but too sharp at ends"
2.0,"Fabric is very cheap looking, the buckles for the sleeves are cheap looking, and the side seams began to curve out dramatically in a an awkward way near the bottom hem, making it lay funny when on."
2.0,"Beautiful leather, but REALLY bulky"
2.0,Dress is too long...I am 5'6 and it drags on the floor
2.0,Its a nice bracelet but the one of the charms has fallen off
2.0,Nice design but the ribbon does stain the white fabric when I handwashed it.
2.0,The design is great but I have a jewelers ring sizer and ordered a size 11 and the one I received was definitely a size 10. Order one size up. Shame they are sold out of 12s which would really be 11s.
2.0,"Sizing: I’m 5’8” and 160 lbs (up 10 lbs from the quarantine unfortunately) hourglass  shape. I ordered the small. It fits my bust (32 FF) but is very baggy through the waist. It hits mid thigh.<br /><br />Quality: I bought this to be a cute-ish, comfortable option while I’m WFH. It’s definitely comfortable. But, the quality is quite poor. It’s essentially t shirt material fashioned into a dress with subpar construction. Very much disposable after a couple of wears and washes.<br /><br />Style: Pretty awful. I bought the red tie die. The color is bright and cheerful but, honestly,  this looks like I’m wearing a rag. Ok, I guess for being stuck home... til I find a better option... and I’m definitely looking. Then, it’s going straight into the trash. I wouldn’t be caught dead in this in public unless it was a midnight WalMart run for chips. LOL!<br /><br />I don’t know how this has gotten such good reviews. And I don’t know how people are okay with wearing something this cheap looking in public. If you are looking for some cheap, comfy loungewear to break up the monotony of leggings and PJ’s, go for it. If, however, you care about your appearance and you are looking for something to wear in public...RUN AWAY. Spend a few more dollars and get something presentable."
2.0,"I intended on purchasing a small little handbag, that I could use with a wristlet or as a crossbody... Mostly for cellphone & a few touch up items. Product was nice, but not what I expected. Too large to be deemed “clutch.” Its the size of a purse, but skinny. Would not reccomend if you’re looking for a small handbag"
2.0,When I received I left it on my patio for 2 days to ease the smell. Even with that it smells so bad my toddler refused to put it on so I had to return it. Its super cute though.
2.0,"So cute, but as I wore it throughout the day, tassels were falling out everywhere I walked. Then one wash and it was done, even on gentle. Wish they had put the tassels on better, because it would be so cute"
2.0,The size was VERY VERY small
2.0,"The quality is average,  but the 5xl is about the size of an American large. Please reevaluate your sizes."
2.0,I can only wear in summer as pull over and it’s a small looks and feels like a dress
2.0,"The color of this dress is great, and it fits true to size (ordered a small, 5’0”, 126lb, it’s just a touch long to wear flat shoes which I expected). My complaints are that I’ve washed it once and it’s already showing small pilling throughout. Additionally, the stitching along the top is somewhat uneven, and the elastic is not strong enough to keep the dress from sliding down somewhat. I don’t regret the purchase but I wouldn’t buy another from this particular brand."
2.0,Very cheap material but adorable print
2.0,I love the idea. Sadly I lost one of the earrings because the magnets came apart.
2.0,"They looks nice, but it's  not easy to open and close.<br />So basically not practical product."
2.0,It was way to small but it was super cute I’ll be ordering a bigger size
2.0,Much thinner and bigger than the others I have purchased.Didn't meet my expectations.
2.0,"Very nice material, great style but runs way small. I ordered an XL, description reads 31.5&#34; waist....not true, has a 27-28&#34; waist. So figure the xl would be the average medium size."
2.0,Is comeble and to bad is not really fit in right with my body type
2.0,"Disappointed!! Love Laundry coats boought 2 this winter. So weird! These coats literally shrink in the cold starting with the length. The sleeves on this coat shrunk above my wrist bone, once indoors it slowly returns to its shape. I walk out with a perfectly sized coat only to return home with a coat that looks a size or even 2, too small!"
2.0,Too big but my chief frustration is that I just can't get the wrinkle out when I opened the mailer pack?<br />Helpful suggestions welcome
2.0,The zipper catches
2.0,Low Quality. i did not liked it. but giving 2 starts only because of the Covid 19 time. it does protect some. also the packing was very cheap
2.0,My husband didn't get much use out of them about 2 months worth.  The soles detached from the upper part of the boot.
2.0,Buttons are already falling off or coming loose.  Color is bright and cheerful.
2.0,This top is POORLY/cheaply made.  The fabric is as thin as tissue and transparent.  Don't waste your money on this craps.
2.0,These are skin tight even ordering up a size for my daughter. They are also see through. Not worth anything.
2.0,I wear I size 8 normally I ordered a size up it was still way to small. Quality of fabric feels cheap. Like a costume.
2.0,"Really do not feel they reflect the price they were. Look and feel ""Cheap"" and would not purchase again!"
2.0,These were my second pair that the nose piece fell off of :( They ar basically useless now.
2.0,This is not slim fit at all!!!
2.0,Cute dress. Measurements aren’t accurate at all.
2.0,Lo compré 2 size más grande y aún no me sirvió.
2.0,"This product is meant to go with the Fitbit Blaze, but the frame is too large so the fitbit wiggles when inserted and the buttons don't line up well, so they are useless when using this band.  I love the look, but the function is terrible."
2.0,"The boots aren't good to work, they are very fragile and scratches occur very easily and the leather is very thin.<br />I returned immediately"
2.0,Material feels itchy so I never wear it.
2.0,"I LOVED this bracelet so very much. Sadly, after about three weeks of my wearing it every day, it fell apart."
2.0,"Great message, less than exceptional design and the material is a poor cousin of pig iron. Buy it at your own risk; a fine present for your naive hippie friends. I had to return mine with a heart far less heavier than this pendant's weight; praise be amazon's return policy."
2.0,It is absolutely is see thru!! It also fits some what small
2.0,These sure look like a good idea.  Problem is they ride up and leave your ears exposed.  They might be OK on an upright seated posture or recumbent bike but not on a road bike.
2.0,Before I put on the sweater the Garland fell off. Usually when it's unisex I take the medium. The medium was to big the sleeves were very long which I had to roll/turn up. There were threads unraveling from one sleeve.
2.0,"I really, really like this watch. The first two weeka I wore it, I got a ton of compliments, too. However, after just two weeks, one of the metal pieces holding it together fell out. I was really disappointed because otherwise,  I would wear this watch nonstop."
2.0,came without the hinge that connects to watch. had to return it
2.0,The color is cool - it is pretty subtle until its in the light but I really like it. It was a gift otherwise I would've returned it and gotten another one. There were some scratches in the coating.
2.0,See through. Cheap. Small. Cuts into my daughter after an hour or so of wearing
2.0,I bought this in a xl and doesn’t fit. It looks like a medium not even a large.
2.0,Shirt is much shorter and boxier-looking than in the pictures... Would not recommend.
2.0,"It would've been nice but it came in stained, right on the front too. I don't know what the stain is but it didn't come out for anything. It ships from China, so no returns available."
2.0,Wore it for one day and the earring hooks kept falling off.
2.0,"It’s kind of see though and I wouldn’t have cared that much but it just fits weird. The bottom part sits in the middle of my boobs so it looks short or something. I don’t know, just very strange fit"
2.0,"Incredibly disappointed with this purchase especially based on reviews!!! I bought a Medium and a Small, just in case the small wasn't as true to size as expected. The small was sewn incorrectly in MULTIPLE places, such that the lace was torn, gaping, or not attached. It looked terrible on the body as the unfinished edges were popping  either up or sticking directly out/ sagging down  in a very unattractive way. I would have thought maybe this was the style somehow if I had not also purchased the medium, which was sewn far better in regard to the lace finishings, however it arrive broken!! The strap wasn't even attached right out of the package. They arrived today and will be packaged for return today as well. Still, if you're still going to buy this, the color was beautiful and it fit well, and it was stretchy where you needed it to be but for $40 I could have gone to a local, cheaper store and gotten higher quality., I've even bought similar dresses on amazon, for less money at MUCH higher quality, in regard to construction and the quality of the lace! Incredibly disappointed!"
2.0,"This romper is not what I was expecting. It looks way cuter and better made in the pictures than it is in reality. It just looks to be very poorly made. The sizing is off as well. I bought it a little bigger because my child is really tall for his age. Lengthwise, it fit him perfectly. So if you are to pick your child's actual size, the legs of it may be too short. It fit my son's length, but it was way loose and roomy. If I saw this in a store, I would not have given it another thought. I am not very happy with it. I would not recommend this romper to anyone.<br /><br />I received this Big elephant Baby Boys' One Piece Romper at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  This review is based completely upon my own personal opinions and experiences with this product."
2.0,"Less than a year and a half after purchase, the watch already malfunctioned (date would not advance).  Had to ship to Casio for repair at my own expense and the customer service there has been sub-par thus far. Unacceptable for a watch at this price point and moreover for a brand that is meant to convey durability as a core value proposition.  Looks great though, got many compliments wearing it."
2.0,"I really wish they made these kind of slippers in single whole sizes, because the next lower size would have been too small, and these are too big for my feet."
2.0,Poorly made. Shoulder strap broke after a week.
2.0,"Cheap metal, will cause itching if you are allergic to fake gold. But I only needed it for one night, then I tossed it. So I guess useful for a night."
2.0,"My size , but this is much to small. The zipper doesn't open either, I had to put it on over my head to get it on ????"
2.0,"You get what you pay for and this is no exception, while it it is a cute little owl it broke the same day and the batteries were dead when it got here. Will not be buying again."
2.0,DID NOT FIT .... BUST TOO SMALL WAIST TOO LARGE.... FABRIC NOT AS EXPECTED
2.0,"This is too large/it does not look as I expected it to. I was going to return it, but it cost $10 to mail it back, which is about what I paid for it, so it was not at all worth it."
2.0,"The stone fell out, kind of defeats the purpose."
2.0,It keeps my pants from falling but every time I take a step the top of the buckle taps against the bottom piece making an annoying tapping noise and one of the corners came sharp so every time I would bend or lean forward it would poke me. It’s a cool looking belt but it’s very uncomfortable.
2.0,"Cute and adorable but returning it because there was a hole in the sleeve and the Sherpa material is only in the torso and hood part, the inner sleeves are lined with plastic. Very weird."
2.0,these socks were great until I washed them. They've shrunk all the way to unusable.
2.0,"The print job on this shirt is very poor quality. It has started coming off after one wash, and that's washing it inside out and not using the dryer. Looks like it's gonna become a yard shirt pretty soon. Shame, too, because this is one of my favorite music groups."
2.0,This sweater is so cute but the pacmans fell off. I ended up gluing them back on.
2.0,Too long and uncomfortable
2.0,I ordered a large and it was WAY too small - sent it back! Nice looking shirt but sizes are way off - don't really want my stomach showing.
2.0,Cute but wore one time and sole is worn away at front of shoes.  Spend more money for a good pair next time.  Lesson learned
2.0,"Like the colors & materials, but doesn't fit around my wrist, I'm guessing it's made in China"
2.0,legs too large and way too long on the 3x
2.0,"I ordered two babydolls from two different vendors on the same day. The other one fit great. This one ran small. There is a pretty black lace section in the front of the middle. When I put it on, it tore down the middle. :("
2.0,Fell off the second time I wore it
2.0,"Boy Reebok, you have a great design in terms of style and color for this hat, but the way it fits is a problem for those of us with really short hair.  Recently I had a discussion with two major mall stores over the adjustable interior band and they told me that it was all Reebok was offering due to licensing.  So thanks Reebok for having to put me through the trouble of finding an adjustable band hat so that I can keep it from moving onto my ears when I put it on."
2.0,Nice tie-dye job but it fits a little tighter and shorter than most other Enjoi shirts. All my Enjoi t-shirts are XL. They fit perfectly and and I’m 6’2” and 215 lbs. Order one size up if you want this.
2.0,It's really small and hard to breath through
2.0,The hood was cool but the design in the shirt was poor quality. Not worth the price spent
2.0,"This dress is paper thin.  This is thin polyester lining that they used to make a dress. The fabric is thin enough for the inside of a purse but not to be worn outside unless it's 90+ degrees outside.  The waist is tight but everything else fits. If this dress was made of a good quality polka- dot poly or satin or crepe back satin then it would be worth the time it took in shipping or the price.  I folded it up and put it in the drawer looking for hot hot hot day which might be never or next summer. It's not worth putting in the closet on a hanger. I might just donate it. We'll see next summer (ugh, I was looking for a fall dress, this is not it)  This dress is a concept based on a movie but the fabric quality is a joke."
2.0,"This watch band is pretty heavy. It adds a lot of weight to your watch. It's extremely difficult to get the pins in since it doesn't have the standard quick release. The tool is helpful, but it took two people who got pretty frustrated with it. Once it is on, it's not as easy to change the fit as some of the other bands are. I found it was either too tight or too loose most of the time. The worst part is that the clasp gave out about a month after using it daily. It wouldn't stay latched and it fell off repeatedly. My watch face now has several scratches on the front from falling off and landing on things. The final straw was when it fell face first on the tile floor of our kitchen. The screen did not shatter, but I saw that a few other buyers posted here that their watch screen DID shatter. I stopped wearing my watch until I could replace the band. Very sad about the quality."
2.0,The brow looks way different from the picture
2.0,"Amazon [[ASIN:B01F51K468 MINICAT Touch Screen Design Mini Leather Crossbody Cell Phone Wallet Purse Bag With Make Up Mirror(Black)]] This bag is not well designed. It does hold an iPhone, but the slots for the credit cards are impossible to use, as they are tucked down in the inner compartment. I could have gotten a less bulky and less expensive one if all I wanted it for was to carry my iPhone. I would have returned it, but I had to open the package to view its inside compartment, and you apparently cannot return opened items to Amazon. This will go into the Goodwill box, and I won't be ordering anything else on hat I haven't seen before.👎😕"
2.0,The Velcro to hold the mittens open came off after the first wear
2.0,Way too long for my son even with adjustments.
2.0,"Returned it, came with bow ripped off, poorly made."
2.0,"Runs a size small, returned it got a bigger size, it ran too big. No happy medium. Its an okay dress, It just didn't really fit my body that well."
2.0,"I like the softness of these pajamas but there are some parts that seem cheap such as the hem at the bottom of the pants that has already started to unravel and I’ve worn them twice.  Otherwise, they are very comfortable."
2.0,"Everything about this product is good about this product EXCEPT IT HAS ONE MAJOR FLAW.  You have to unplug it to turn it off.  It should work on a timer ( this could be adjustable from 1 hour or 12 hours).  Most shoes just need  &#34;freshening&#34; and occasionally some need to dry out overnight.  At the very least, it should have an on-off switch.  Most people will forget to unplug it and this is a waste of electricity"
2.0,"The glasses look and feel great, but they never get dark enough to hide your eyes."
2.0,"too small, doesn seem to be the size specified on details"
2.0,"These have screw-on backs, very difficult to put on."
2.0,These break very easy
2.0,"not 6 inches as described, more like 11-12 inches."
2.0,This product didn't do anything for me.
2.0,"I loved the sweatshirt, but the adult XXXLG fit my 11 year old son who wears a size 12-14 in kids.  I usually wear a XLG, but I heard it runs small.  My daughter who wears a size 4 couldn't hardly squeeze into it.  If the sizing was right, I'd order it again right away.  Sending it back!"
2.0,Although they are super soft on the inside they are NOT true to size. Way too small.
2.0,Broke the 2nd time I wore it
2.0,"The quality is great, and they are definitely genuine amethyst, however, my piercings are 2g, so naturally that is what I ordered.  Unfortunately they flares are so big compared to the actual sizing of the middle that I couldn't even get them into my ears.  Disappointed since they're very beautiful, but I have to return them.  I don't know if ordering one size smaller than you usually wear would help the problem, since I believe the middle is the correct diameter.  Too bad they don't make single flare options."
2.0,Birds are bigger than I expected and looked a little like something my mother would buy. It is going back.
2.0,"These shirts I bought to put under my uniform for work. They worked out perfectly for that, but I would recommend buying one size up. I did just that and they fit me to a T.  I also had a problem with one of my shirts seams coming undone in the laundry just after the first washing! The other two have held up perfectly fine so far."
2.0,"I generally really like the quality of this brand, but the arm/side seam ripped during the first wash. Super disappointed because the print is beautiful and it is lightweight, perfect for spring and summer."
2.0,I gave this as a secret Santa and they loved it but informed me after having it for a few days the pendant broke off! I am very disappointed to see that.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:d6c627662638194e9a7050bd72665f65]] Little dents were all over the shoes as soon as I opened them I noticed it, so I plan to return them, there super cute just disappointed since they were apart of a gift."
2.0,Thought they were cartiers
2.0,"Like the belt and the color of the buckle.  Unfortunately, the paint has gradually chipped off the buckle showing the silver color underneath."
2.0,BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY BOYFRIEND I WILL BE SENDING IT BACK. IT LOOKS WORN IM SURE ITS THE STYLE BUT I DIDNT LIKE IT. THE KOI AND THE GRAFFITI WRITING IS COOL AND IT HAS LITTLE BUD LEAVES INSIDE THE HOOD I WAS JUST THROWN OFF BY THE WASH...IF IT LOOKED LIKE A NEW SWEATER IT COULD HAVE BEEN COOL.
2.0,"1st one arrived broken, the 2nd one broke 1st time wearing it"
2.0,Really cheap material. It looks like the “rope” is made of yarn and feels like it too. The anchor is also plastic unlike the metal I thought it would be.
2.0,The legs on the base are too short. The wheels are very sturdy
2.0,"Thankful for free returns. This dress was not what I expected. The color did not match what was shown online. It did fit correctly, but the quality seemed very low."
2.0,"I purchased the L and I couldn’t even get it over my hips. This is more of a straight-legged pant. Also in spite of the elastic, the waist is tiny. I’m gonna assume these are Asian sizes. I’m not a big girl."
2.0,Material is not very wearable...very stiff and boxy
2.0,Looks great but zipper opened when it shouldn’t.  Rubber tip kept coming off.  When opened it felt clumsy.
2.0,The way the straps did not touch the top of my husband’s foot
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:99ba626aa8995120475aff948ad53326]] This wallet is actually really cool and works great but unfortunately I left it in my car on a hot day and found out that the outside is just a sticker, anyways it started peeling off of the wallet and looks pretty bad now."
2.0,Legs are too tight
2.0,"I'm not quite sure why they wanted a photo of the product before they would issue an RMA. Surely they know what one of their products looks like?<br /><br />That being said, one of the internal springs failed, so they don't clip on and hold."
2.0,"This sweater is beautiful but the ink from the pink color is stained on the sleeve and in the back. Can’t wear it, because it looks like a hot mess! Very Disappointed!"
2.0,The mask is too small for an adult. It might fit a child or very small adult. Air flow is good but only at high speed. Straps are very cumbersome and awkward to put on. Extremely uncomfortable and not a good seal.<br />Recommend not purchasing.
2.0,"I loved how they looked, however they broke the day I wore them. One earring I had a hard time taking off as well."
2.0,"I so wanted to love this dress.  Unfortunately, there is nothing &#34;midi&#34; about it. It does come to about my mid-thigh, and since I am 5' 5&#34;, I don't consider myself particularly tall. After washing and carefully removing it before putting other clothing in the dryer (a nuisance) the hem is uneven and the bodice is shrunken.  I am not happy!"
2.0,"small, good for a lady , not men"
2.0,This dress runs very small. I’m normally a medium and i ordered a large. I could not get the dress on. The middle of the dress does not stretch at all. The sizing measurements are not accurate.
2.0,"Returning, way too small for all my stuff and too hard to open and close. Was almost impossible to get the strap through the metal buckle. Not happy with the quality of the leather. Sorry, I like to give good reviews, but couldn’t with this one!"
2.0,"These leggings were smaller than expected. They are extremely stretchy, though. In other leggings brands I fit into the &#34;one size&#34; category, so I was expecting these to be the same. I could get these leggings on, but they felt extremely tight and the crotch was a little weird. I am a size 8, so if you're smaller than that, these leggings should work great.<br /><br />I do have to say that the inside felt so soft!! I would have given these leggings a great rating if I could actually fit comfortably in them."
2.0,Metal square on top separated from the plastic in less than three weeks.
2.0,"I am going to return this product, the shoe is too small.  I wear an 11.5 and have this size in several other shoe brands.  I would need to get a size 12 in this shoe.  Most shoes now have a fairly standard grade Orthotic in their shoe, however this shoe has absolutely no arch support.  It would require a new orthotic and that again would take additional shoe space.  therefore I doubt that I will reorder a larger size."
2.0,Hurts to put in and not large enough to close
2.0,The dress was really nice but I was super unhappy with the fact that it arrived smelling of perfume. The tags weren’t attached and it had pulls in the fabric all down the side and a few across the front like it had been worn then returned. It clearly hadn’t been checked before being repackaged and sent out.<br />If the dress had arrived brand new then I would have kept it. It’s a pretty dress and I was impressed with the quality for the price.
2.0,"I like the material. It's not too thin. But the sizing is off by a size. I wear a medium everything, but these I should have ordered a large. They are comfy bit too small. I will be exchanging these."
2.0,"Cute leotard, my daughter really liked the design. However, it runs extremely small in size so we had to return it. I checked the measurements before ordering. My daughter is 9 and typically wears a size 8. According to the measurements I needed to order a size XL (8-10). It did not fit at all! My daughter couldn’t even get it all the way on. We returned it, but due to the size and measurements being so off we decided to not reorder another one."
2.0,"The color is cute and the fabric is comfortable. However, as all athletic apparel it runs small. It is also described as a brief and it fits as a bikini. Most importantly for me, the padding is not sufficient for long rides."
2.0,The shirt is thin and very short. Fast delivery and return though!
2.0,Very ill fitting . I Am very unimpressed with this dress . It looked so great in the pictures ! But it was huuuuge .. there was so much extra fabric at the back of the waist I could make a second dress .. I am 5'5 130.
2.0,"The frames look pretty good, although they're a little flimsy.  Magnification is fine, however they don't work, at all, as transition lenses.  Even in the brightest sunshine we saw no change.  I wouldn't recommend these as transition lenses."
2.0,"I wear a size 4 in dresses, pants, jeans (27) and small in tops. I my bra size is a 34 B or C and in sports bras I wear a small or 34. I read the reviews and decided to go with medium instead of small in the bathing suits (I normally size up anyway)…. well mistake. the tops were more like a large. The bottoms fit; in fact, I think the small would have been to small. Also, the bottoms are only lined in the front and you can see EVERYTHING in the back. I will not be able to wear the green bottoms. These are NOT well made in my opinion. This is more along the line of a bathing suit you would purchase at Walmart. I am not saying there is anything wrong with that; in fact, one of my favorite bathing suits I got from Walmart. I also ordered this in another pattern with the blue bottoms and because of the dark color, I will be able to wear those bottoms. I am currently trying to shrink the tops in the dryer."
2.0,Not a bad dress but the ribbon that comes across the stomach area need to be a little looser because it goes above the middle seam. And where the stitching end the was left outside the front of the dress not inside.
2.0,"I own a charm bracelet exactly like this that has a shiny finish and since it has the same charms, I thought it was the same one. If you try to magnify the photo, you will see that it is extremely pixelated. You cannot get a good look at this object. When you get this, it looks very cheap, with a dull finish. Buy this for a little girl, but don't expect this to be good enough for an adult to wear. It is a fun toy.<br /><br />Here on Amazon, they have the bracelet I thought this one was. It is over $100. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016P0161K?keywords=wedding%20charm%20bracelet%20rhodium%20finish&qid=1447340822&ref_=sr_1_11&sr=8-11<br />Don't be confused that this is the same bracelet. It is not. However, it looks exactly like it in the photo!"
2.0,Terrible quality control.  One arm is longer than the other making it sit weird and uneven on my face.  I knew the price I paid was too good to be true.
2.0,"This belt was to small, and had no stretch to it. Was going to send it back but the postage cost twice as much as the belt! It's cute but for a size 3"
2.0,"if you're short and somewhat tiny, they don't fit. just looked awkward. The material is great though. Just have to order a small or extra small (I'm 5/3 and 140 pounds and was way too big)..."
2.0,"When I first got these shoes, I was going to rate them 5 stars! They are super comfortable, the shifter pad feels great, the extra Velcro keeps the laces tight. However! after not even 500 miles on the road with these shoes, the material between the shifter pad and the white cross strap of the shoe has separated, and now I have a gaping hole in the left shoe. You would think they would take extra care to make that area extra strong, being how it constantly tugs at that gear peg, but it was the first thing to break. I'm extremely disappointed, because I was looking forward to having these shoes for a long time due to all the great qualities I mentioned above. This is not the type of foot ventilation I expected. Booooo!"
2.0,I did not care for this wallet. Way too small to hold my phone or anything else really. Didn't seem as durable as I would have liked either. I returned it.
2.0,"It had a broken spot on one of the shoes. 😕 My son likes them. He wore has other pair out, he wore them so much."
2.0,Missing the double stacked ring 😔
2.0,"After one day of wearing these, I already know they will go in the trash.  Overall they fit well, I like the wide waist band, and the material is soft.  Unfortunately, the legs roll up as soon as I sit down.  I have worn these half a day and I can hardly wait to get home to take them off!  I am up and down all day long and beyond frustrated with having to tug the legs down every time I stand up!"
2.0,"Beautiful garment...but the description needs to say order two sizes up. I ordered a Large, but should have gotten the XL."
2.0,"Not what i was expecting, poor quality.."
2.0,"While these shoes are very well made, the heel is more like a wedge, which does not afford you much stability when walking. When it comes to platform shoes this high, they really need to consider a chunkier heel. I was terrified of spraining my ankle just walking across carpeting. I had to send them back, the risks of injury outweighed the cuteness of the shoe."
2.0,The shirts is too small but the pants were the right fit.
2.0,"The glasses were beautiful and stable when first opened, but once I put them on they immediately broke within a couple of hours. I don't recommend them if you intend on wearing them daily, unless you take very, very good care of them."
2.0,Very thick and the white print show on low cut shoe. Skinny legs had hard time keeping them up
2.0,not original and made n china
2.0,Wasn't what I expected.  The bustier is all out of proportion with the bodice and skirt
2.0,"Nice shirt...but sizes are off by one! I ordered XL, it's the size of a tight cut large. So...if you order this...order one size bigger then normal.<br />Me...my smaller friend recieved a nice $35.00 shirt!"
2.0,"looks nice the minute i washed it, i could fit my cat in it. shrunk like crazy."
2.0,"The tassels on tassel pair is super cute. The other pair came in the mail broken. I guess you get what you paid for, but the one pair is super cute on."
2.0,"These goggles seem well-made, but the sharp-edged nose-piece will stab your nose if you have any sort of a bridge, and the straps will barely fit around your head if your hat size is L or XL.  Since I have a normal/large nose and a large adult head, I could not wear these goggles at all.  The hard sharp plastic edges of the eyeframes dug into my nose so hard I thought I was cut.  My 12-year old son said they were too tight on his head, too, and asked me to loosen them... but the straps are extended to the last notch.  They don't quite pinch his nose bridge yet, so he's going to try wearing them for a while, otherwise they would be an immediate return."
2.0,The pleats are not flattering if you have big chest.
2.0,Sent back because it doesn't have the countdown timer. Why? No idea.
2.0,I loved this but because it wouldnt stay screwed in tightly I only got to wear it for a day before I lost it. Super bummer!
2.0,I liked it but it was sized too small.
2.0,Decent looking pant. Horrible size accommodation. I couldn't even guess the right for if there even were one.
2.0,Pretty swim suit. But I ordered the XL and I am 5'3&#34; 145 pounds. And it was way too small. I ended up giving it to my friend who is 5'7&#34; and about 135 pounds and it fit her perfect.
2.0,Purchased for a mermaid costume. It’s a cute purse but I paid too much for this. The metal chain broke off in first minutes of use. I expected better quality for the price.
2.0,I loved the shoes but there were no nonskid on bottom of shoes I tried to wear them but they were slippy on all floors I could not afford to take a fall for shoes
2.0,"Horrible chemical smell. I had to wash immediately. Runs big. I’m 5’4 / 120 small boobs, and I barely fill the xs. It’s almost too large but it is comfy. It fit better after drying. I think wouldn’t recommend it overall for the price though."
2.0,"The quality of the leggings and texture are great, but the color is not as pictured. I ordered the serene blue color, which was pictured as a heathered royal blue. These arrived and they are not heathered, and they are periwinkle. The color is not variegated and they are not a deep blue, they're a pastel. If you don't mind a lighter shade, these leggings are nice!"
2.0,"I hate that these are so cute! They're so so cute, but they broke so fast. I've bought them twice and both times they broke in about 2 days to a week."
2.0,"In the picture, it looks the headbands are delicate.. But they are made of thick elastic material... It hurts babies heads.<br />Maybe they can work with bigger girls but they are not at all as I expected!"
2.0,This has the quality of a Halloween costume pretty shape and color but terrible quality
2.0,"The lining of the bra is black and completely ruins the look of it because it pops out constantly. I wanted a yellow bra, not a yellow and black bra. I wish I had returned it."
2.0,"The, I guess, silver foil is peeling off the ring."
2.0,I ordered XL. This fit more like between a medium and large. The stripe on the pockets are much more pronounced than the picture and looks kind of weird.
2.0,"It's to hard to connect  the back part to other side.  Would had return them granddaughters have more patience, I am person slip earring in my ear and go not these at all"
2.0,Bought this in November and saved it for my 5yro until Christmas. He was very excited about the shoe's. Same colors as his Seahawks. Here it is January 8th and the Velcro straps are already coming apart. Not great quality. Can't even find a way to contact seller.
2.0,The color is much different than what is shown in the photo. The blue is different and so is the fit.
2.0,They came really quickly so that was cool. When we first tried them they were amazing but the goggles were only fog resistant for a short time (there is an oil inside them that keeps it ‘fog resistant’) and every time they touched the ground or the side of the pool they would scratch. We were not rough on these either.<br />After a week we couldn’t barely see out of them.
2.0,It came without the nut holding the screw
2.0,"Definitely fit as expected, stitching perfectly fine, but the problem is the material itself. Plastic feeling--100% polyester and the seams feel very cheap. Just trying it on made me feel hot--does not breathe well at all. Color stripes don't align properly. Overall just does not feel/look right."
2.0,"Recieved my package in the mail yesterday. Instantly went to clean them with dial soap and water. Instantly I saw the piercings begin to break apart. Thankfully there are all metal piercings within the bundle and also some did ""survive"" but a good portion were broken or are on the verge if doing so. I went to put one on and  it instantly shattered."
2.0,I must have been sent one sewed wrong because i cant do the more covered up styles due to smaller straps.
2.0,I did not realize just how incredibly tiny these would be. The two open rings would fit in my septum piercing but remain completely inside my nose and unnoticeable from the outside. The two prettier clickers- the rhinestone one has a flaw where there is sort of an extra little metal bump under one of the stone on on side and it throws off the symmetry of the design. The opal one is so tiny that if I were to wear it in my septum it is impossible to close without it pinching my nose and just looking like a pretty chunk of sparkly snot. Super bummed these didn’t work out because the price for four was cool.
2.0,"Poorest quality! Shorts came with a hole and the jersey was undone in one of the armhole-cross. I didn't open it when it arrived. My son really want to have this jersey  so, when he opened it, I couldn't return it. Save your money!"
2.0,Awkward fit... Small on the bottom but the top and stomach part are bigger and the extra fabric that hangs is way too much... I should know own better than ordering online but sometimes price looks good....
2.0,not  925  silver  the  Tibet  silver  needs  cleaning
2.0,"Just ug. Think fabric, not comfy. Bottom was just odd. Not at all what I expected. I am 5'4&#34; 130 lbs 34B. Got a small and was bulky. Sent it back."
2.0,They sent me a 16g instead of 14 and it didn’t fit
2.0,"I loved the belly ring I ordered until it broke. I tried fixing it myself, but it broke again. Very disappointing because I loved it and now it’s too late to return or exchange. I can’t find a way to contact the seeker directly, which is a problem when your product breaks."
2.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): This necklace is just okay.  It looks really cheap and flat.  I searched for ""scales of justice necklace"" in the Amazon search bar and found that you can pay a few extra dollars and get something nicer and more detailed."
2.0,"Sending back.  Love the shirts, materials.  But this is not the pink in the picture . Very disappointing"
2.0,"Product is durable and combat, however one thing I’m not satisfied about it  is that the mouthpiece doesn’t have a protective covering.  If I would had noticed this before ordering I certainly wouldn’t had purchased this model.  I don’t use it has much because of this missing feature."
2.0,"These shirts really shrunk more than I expected.  They fit great until they were washed.  They are particularly short in the torso. When I wear them under a dress shirt, they become untucked with a couple hours. I like the relatively light texture of the shirt, but if it is too short then it is not good.  Can someone suggest a different brand or type.  I am 6 ft. tall 180 pounds.  I really don't think I would fit into an XL. I bought Large thinking it would work. But, did not."
2.0,"Material is nice, fit is nice... however, all it takes is a medium tug (just the pressure of adjusting it on your wrist is enough), and the connection to the watch pops free.  Definitely doesn't fit the watch very securely. Which is disappointing.<br />Considering a secure connection is far more important than wrist fit and finish, I can't give this a high score.... it makes the band useless and risky if it pops off while exercising, or gets lost just bumping into something even.  Someone could still it off your wrist without you even noticing. It's just too loose of a connection point."
2.0,Bought wife likes but has black lines that run up the sides of the socks cause by the leaks in screen when was printed.
2.0,"The material on this light pink one and the light blue have been more sheer and flimsy than the darker colors I have purchased in Red, Navy, Black and yellow. I do not like that it is not the same material, but the description is the same. It should explain fabric is different."
2.0,Strap was cute but didn’t like the fit after wearing it. The beads on the side was annoying and made it a challenge to use my buttons on the side.
2.0,These run really small!
2.0,"These sunglasses fit over my glasses and dim the suns rays. Those are the 2 things you want from a pr of sunglasses. BUT, they look ridiculous!! Even though they are the same size, the arms of my glasses sit lower than these. So I have one set of arms from my glasses in the normal place and another set of arms (from these sunglasses) that sits above them. It just looks silly and I end up looking like the crazy person who put sunglasses over her glasses and thought no one would notice. Well, there's no way NOT to notice. They get 2 stars because of the reasons in my first sentence. Other than that, EPIC fail!!"
2.0,"Arrived broken and missing parts, box looked like it had been opened previously then sold as new."
2.0,"Most of the pockets are very tight fitting for drivers license cards, etc.  The drivers license pocket ripped at the seam trying to get it back out."
2.0,Zipper came off the track after only a month of wearing them. I really like this shoe but the zipper evidently is not high-quality.
2.0,Havent had them.2 months and this what happens holes in the soles
2.0,"I should have looked harder at the photos in the reviews. Most of these reviews are for another product, the bras with the racer back style. The bras with the crossed straps in the back are not adjustable and the bra as a whole is very flimsy and nonsupportive. I don’t think they were meant to be functional whatsoever."
2.0,I DONT LIKE IT WAS TO SMALL
2.0,Stretched out in 2 days. Sad.
2.0,"This is a really cute dress! Unfortunately, it is way too sheer and I was really hoping to wear it for work :("
2.0,Está bonito de color y tela pero sus costuras muy sencilla
2.0,"This outfit does not run true to size.  It's very nice & sexy so I am going to now order a 2XL even though I am 170 lbs. , 5'5 this should fit perfect."
2.0,Elastic cuts in a bit.  Runs small as well.
2.0,"the frame is good, the problem is that it covers half of the word &#34;Texas&#34; on the top portion. To some bored cops roaming the streets, they occasionally stop you just for covering up your state even slightly. the major problem is the vinyl that the words are printed on. firstly; the vinyl was placed on the plate very haphazardly. it was bubbly and askew. I had to peel the whole thing off and set it right myself. that leads to problem number 2; it was very easy to peel. I have washed it three times and have to be quite careful around the edges as to not peel it off. I worry that the adhesive will loose its stickiness after a dozen more washes but only time will tell, I guess it depends on how gently you wash the plate. power washing will peel the whole thing off. and problem letter C; the words &#34;My other car is a chocobo&#34; are hard to read. they are dotted and spaced close together. if I were I passerby in a parking lot, a quick glance would only give me a blurry white line."
2.0,"The dress itself is really nice and comfortable, made from a cool cotton material, but the embroidery started to come out (and that’s coming out completely - basically pieces of the pattern completely gone) after the first wear and wash (which was a hand wash!)"
2.0,"Color isn’t a true rose gold it’s a very light almost silver shade of pink. Super bulky and super thick, not what I was expecting. I will not be wearing this."
2.0,Not really a good fit for wide hips
2.0,Bright saturated yellow with glaring purple flowers.. not a nice pale yellow like the photo. Material seems ok.. cheap flannel which is what I wanted.. but the colors will have to be bleached so I can live with them.
2.0,"Fits good, it's cute, and is lightweight but doesn't zip more than 3 inches. I didn't want to wear it open"
2.0,Waist band is comfy and fit is good- however the elastic in the leg bands stretch out with just a few hours of wear and become too loose- not keeping all the male parts in place.  Hence the 2 star rating.
2.0,The dress was very pretty but i have to say i was very disappointed that the zipper broke before i could even put on the dress. :(
2.0,Terribly boxy through waist and hips.  Has no feminine shape whatsoever.
2.0,The inside of the bag has a bad smell that a week of airing could not eliminate.  Had to return it.
2.0,Items came broken and the magnetic parts were poorly made
2.0,"This skirt looks gorgeous, but the material is very thin, and it looks quite different than the picture. I ordered the biggest size and it still didnt fit me. I believe this is asian size you guys. Be warned, im returing it."
2.0,I won't order these again.  The covered wasteband does not stretch well.  These are nice and soft though.  Go back to normal wasteband and you'll have a customer for life.
2.0,"I bought this and quickly returned it. I am 5'1"" and 111 pounds and this was not floor length and it barely covered my shoulders. This looks nothing like it does in the photo."
2.0,"If the term ""Polo"" only implies a collar and three-button placket, then this shirt loosely qualifies. However, in all other respects, it's a polyester base layer. Take a close look at the cuffs on the sleeves and you'll see what I mean. Construction quality is sloppy at best with lots of dangling threads. The blue/white pattern isn't too bad, but the one that's supposed to be a mixture of grays has pink and green tones that makes it pretty nauseating. These shirts might be worth $10, but certainly not the >$30 they're charging so I'll be returning them."
2.0,The product began to fall apart on the first washing. Nearly all of the edges were frayed. Very poor manufacturing. Will not buy again
2.0,"This sunglasses are huge!! I have a pretty big head, lol, and they fall off."
2.0,"There's something wrong with the things that hold the earrings in the ear, or the stems. Too lose, easy to lose, hard to not lose.  I like the earrings which is the reason they got 2 stars. Maybe I can find a way to keep them on"
2.0,Bought it for an adult. It's rather cheap looking & very hard to read. Maybe ok for a child.
2.0,They fell apart not even a whole 2 days in your mouth. Waste of money!!!
2.0,Very short. Leggings dint even come to my ankles
2.0,"I bought 2 different strengths believing I could return whichever pair of these reading glasses that didn't work for me.  After all, the product description says you can return for any reason.  Not true!  Glasses cannot be returned for any reason.  Returns are not accepted.  Better to try different pairs of reading at Walmart and just buy a pair that is the right strength and size while you're at the store."
2.0,They look good until you put them on then they look pretty stretched out. Couldn’t wear them.
2.0,"I love the color and the fabric, but the fit is very awkward. It's way too tight in the shoulders and chest, but very loose in the arms and belly area. Overall, not a flattering look for me--although it might be fine on someone who is tiny and petite. I would have returned it, but I got distracted and missed the window."
2.0,"Great to have, but the safety system to keep it close(2 robber bands) does not work. They keep coming off. It is a little rough around your forehead so you may need to add a bit of cushion. Otherwise it does cover your entire face, can be worn with your glasses and the mask is clear enough"
2.0,Lot less than expected!
2.0,"I ordered this same pair of gloves in 2013 (older version on the right) and this is the newer version on the left. I only re bought these gloves because I lost one of them. And I gotta say, I am not too impressed with the 'new and improved' 2015 version. The leather does feel nicer, but they got the sizes all wrong now. They were both size 7s and the older version fit perfectly, even after breaking it in, and these newer ones are really quite too roomy in the fingers. And the design isn't the same and it is in fact worse aesthetically. If you want the older version of this glove, I recommend 'The Drive' by Gaspar Gloves. They are more expensive but if you want the same design and look, go for that. Overall, I am a little let down."
2.0,"I loved the idea of the shirt, but the bust line needed to be lower"
2.0,"I love the style of these glasses, especially for the price! They came quickly in the mail (via prime), and the color is true to the images. I was disappointed that the pair I received had a noticeable chip in the gold framing. It was also missing an entire nose piece, causing the glasses to sit skewed on my face. I purchased these specifically to wear to a music festival, and unfortunately there was not time to replace them."
2.0,I will like it we I received it
2.0,"It is not the color that I thought, it is not what they show, and the fabric is very simple ..."
2.0,"The first time i ordered them, i loved them. Second time, not really. They were scratched and they were covered with a sticker. They landed in the trash. I was disapointed bc i loved these glasses the first time i ordered them. Hopefully next time i get a better quality."
2.0,I got this for my preschooler and it fit my husband who wears adult mask size XL. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because my husband loves them.
2.0,Did not like the fit on this and returned it.
2.0,"Normally I wear a medium sports bra, but this medium size is so small.  The cup size is a B or A and too tight and uncomfortable.<br /><br />The price is $13 and you'd be better off paying extra for one that fits better.  The material is rough and could be smoother. It's a good sports bra for a preteen who hasn't gone though puberty yet."
2.0,Nice but very small
2.0,"Ordered my size but this was extremely small so I promptly returned it. The jacket was real nice and I really liked the style, but there is no way it fit. Couldn't even zip it up! If you consider ordering I would recommend at least one size larger, maybe even two if you don't like your jackets tight!"
2.0,"For the size, this robe was too short"
2.0,She doesn’t wear it.
2.0,"This product worked ok, but I have used Polishing Cloths that clean better then this one. I guess it does a good enough job. Although I don't think I would buy this particular cloth again."
2.0,"It has blemishes on the paint.  Snags on clothing, blankets, and bedding.  Magnet is strong though."
2.0,"Not what I expected,smaller than regular medium more like for my younger daughter....."
2.0,"Actually loved the necklace but the chain clasp really sucks. I fumbled with it every time and finally ended up dropping it on the bathroom floor and it broke open, so the dried clover turned to dust."
2.0,Looks pretty BUT it is so delicate that the threads pull even with careful handling.  I have not even worn it yet.  The vee needed reinforcement immediately....it was pulling away.  Don't expect that I will be able to use it more than a few times before it looks really shoddy.
2.0,Grossely undersized.  My niece wears a size 7 and that is what I ordered for her. Suit wouldn't go up over her rear end!  I would suggest sizing up at least two sizes.
2.0,"It was to small! It was to long, I am short!"
2.0,The dress fit well but it was not a midi length dress as described. This dress came to my knees.
2.0,Waist is very tight and kind of hurts because of it. It is elastic but just fits really tight. I typically wear a 0 or 1 so being a small should be just fine. Also they are incredibly long. So for someone crazy skinny and tall they probably would work out great.
2.0,Webbing is really good quality but one of the keepers was crushed rendering it useless.<br /><br />Update: used a screwdriver to open the keeper so now it works but looks wonky.
2.0,The arms were too snug.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:aa80b7067e44b83e0094c253197bfa4b]] Eh a bit pricey @ $57 for a polo with obvious  poor stitching. More like $20 polo at best, for that I will be returning it."
2.0,Unfortunately the description doesn’t include that the character isn’t included. This is only the purple backpack.
2.0,UNCOMFORTABLE TO WEAR
2.0,"I'm a 32D so I got the size that says for D cups, but it didn't really do anything.  My boobs aren't saggy, but I have a natural gap between them so I just wanted to push them together for cleavage.  The D cup bra sat too high up/covered too much boob in my opinion.  I will try a smaller size.  Also the box was crushed (the bra appeared to be was fine) and there were no instructions with it.  It kind of is common sense though and I've seen celebrities and an infomercial on it so I was informed, however, that could be a problem for somebody else.  The bra is held in place by a sticky gel.  There's no gel where your nipples go.  Removal is easy & painless.  I recommend holding your boobs as your peel it off so you don't stretch your skin too much.<br /><br />***Update***<br />I returned the D cup and got a C cup.  This time it fit better, however, it looked horrible under my tank top cut sundress.  My boyfriend immediately asked what was wrong with my boobs and said they looked weird.  I told him I was wearing this underneath and he said my boobs look way better w/o it LOL I have to agree though.  The shape of the bra is weird and unnatural looking underneath clothes. It did the job of bringing the girls together so my gap was less and I had cleavage.  If you need support, you won't get any from this bra."
2.0,"I like the length but the sleeves are very thin. Also, you can’t tell which is front or back and that bugs me. Wouldn’t purchase it again but not worth the cost to return."
2.0,Very pretty but VERY thin. Not thick and cozy like in the pic.
2.0,"Does not look like the picture, firstly the shirt was extremely short and it did not fit as expected"
2.0,"Wore them once out on date night and LOVED them.  The waist is a little tighter than expected and not as comfortable as I would have hoped it to be considering ""pajama"" jeans, I wouldn't want to order next size up because the leg and length fit perfectly.  Thick material but not heavy or denim feeling. Didn't feel like I was wearing thin leggings or heavy jeans, right in the middle. Haven't washed them yet so am unsure how they will hold up through a cycle or two. Nice dark ""jean"" color, I asked my husband if he liked my jeans and he said yes and couldn't tell they were actually jeans but it is so common to just wear jeggings these days I don't think people really think anything of them.  Overall I am in the middle, like them and they looked nice but not comfortable enough that I get excited to wear them instead of normal jeans and for the price..meh.  I probably would not buy them again."
2.0,Not very flattering….fabric is not soft
2.0,"shirts was nice looking design wise, but runs small and thin material"
2.0,I was very disappointed when I received these slippers. They are flimsy and have no support whatsoever. The soles are thin and it is hard to distinguish what is the left or right shoe as they don't have any shape. Forget the fuzzy lining; it bunches up in the toes. Looks like these slippers are headed for the trash can.
2.0,Cute but the horn broke almost instantly. They tangled really bad. But my daughter loves it.
2.0,Just cheap made would not recommend or would not buy again
2.0,Straps r way to wide
2.0,"These look really cool. Colors are bright and hold even after washing. Wearing them is difficult though. They stretch out and don't hold on your face. They don't breathe well, every time you take a breathe it sucks into your face."
2.0,"Fit was perfect, only bad thing was the material faded horribly, right away.  I only got to wear the dress a few times."
2.0,"I like the style, it just ended up being smaller than I thought and smaller than I wanted"
2.0,Product came with broken button so not usable.
2.0,Would look so nice on my ear but it is too small...should be sold to small children only.  It is very pretty.
2.0,"I like the look but it is really tight.  Too tight for my liking.  I'm usually a size Medium, but this was more like a small."
2.0,I ordered a M as I do with everything and it do not fit me in the front or butt -(baggy) it fits my legs just fine the top is perfect
2.0,Run small.<br />Size up.
2.0,"I bought this set as a Father's day gift. He was so excited to wear and match his little buddy, but after one wash the print was peeling off as you can see in the photo. It is his first Father's day, and I was hoping this set would last at least a little bit."
2.0,I normally wear a 6-8 or a medium and after reading the reviews I ordered a large. It was small enough for a child...
2.0,Very thin/see through.
2.0,"I had high hopes for this top, but it feels like a costume. The green material is itchy on the inside and shiny on the outside. The bow tie material is very cheap grosgrain (like what children’s hair bows are made of) - very, very shiny and was already frayed at the ends upon arrival. The collar doesn’t lay flat in the back. The shape is not very flattering. It’s very loose and boxy through the torso but the sleeves are very fitted, so my body looks wide and out of proportion to my arms wearing it. The only redeeming part of this shirt is the color. The forest green is very pretty, and looks as I expected it to from the photos. It definitely would work as a costume shirt but it feels too cheap for much else."
2.0,"The clasp and band broke after a few uses but, the charm it great."
2.0,"Too small, had to return. I'm 5'10&#34; and about 155 lbs. I typically wear size medium or size 6-8 in bottoms. Husband ordered a medium for me and while I was able to put them on, they were simply too small and too tight to be comfortable. Awesome lime green color though."
2.0,size runs very small
2.0,I wanted something a little thicker. This fabric was rather thin.
2.0,"Although these are suuper cute. The sole is plastic. Not rubber for anti slipping. But good old click-clack all over the place plastic. 16 month old slides all over our wooden floors, no traction whatsoever. :("
2.0,"This item was purchased as a gift for my fiance, who is a huge fan of the show. The quality of this item is so sub par that I am unsure I will give it to him. The button is held on my two threads and feels like it will fall off easily. The fabric feels like cheap polyester; the fabric is rough and you can easily see through it. The insignia on the back is already starting to fall off. That being said, it is a nice fit and is accurate to the show. The hood is a nice touch and the color is a beautiful, bright green. The price is very low, so you get the quality that you pay for."
2.0,Ordered up and was still way too small. If you are broad shouldered or larger chested good luck fitting in this shirt.
2.0,"See through, very cheap thin material. Looks like a $10 dress.  Would not recommend."
2.0,The green tree portion of the necklace popped out. Had to repair. Not that great of quality.
2.0,Rubbed a blister on the top of my toes
2.0,It didn't lay right on my face and the eye holes didn't quite line up. Returned
2.0,Buy a size bigger than you normally would. Very tight in the arms!
2.0,too small and made cheaply.
2.0,"Not a fan favorite.<br />This 18k gold necklace is actually 18k gold filled/plated 316 high quality titanium steel. Not sure what all that really means. Bottom line, it looks cheap. The gold color is too dark and looks like fake costume jewelry. I posted a pic of just the chain and of it next to another necklace I have, that is gold plated. You can see the color difference.<br />The description also says it will not change color and is tarnish resistant. I'm skeptical about this. After wearing it half a day, my neck was darkened around where the chain was sitting. It was not green though and did wash right off. Plus, this chain gives off a strong metallic smell.<br />Lastly, the description says: ""When it comes to layered necklaces, you can choose to wear them separately or in layers!"". However, you cannot separate these chains. Maybe they meant layered with other necklaces???"
2.0,Horrible stitching.
2.0,They're mostly the color green. Not what the picture protrait it to be
2.0,Order in Asian sizes - cut much smaller than expected
2.0,My daughter loved these but they didn't last. Very cheaply made.
2.0,"These tops are cute but fit super loose, and the strapless side tends to fall. Ordered them in small and won't be wearing them probably."
2.0,Elastic stretched out in no time.  Don’t buy.
2.0,The color is not as dark as advertised and the pin is not long enough to go through the tie and the shirt.
2.0,"The strap on this item broke after only a week of use. I noticed there are two tiny screws which hold it in on the clip and unscrewed them as to fix it and do so effectively.<br /><br />However, after a couple of days later it ripped all the way through so it cannot be repaired.<br /><br />On a positive note, the packaging that it came in was very nice and professional."
2.0,I returned this. From the picture I thought it would be a fun dress for a cocktail party. When it came it just looked really cheap. The sizing was fine but the material and construction were a disappointment.
2.0,"These were the perfect size as a purse sized pair of cheater readers while on the go. The case was almost impossible to get open though, and if you can't get the case open when you need them they are of little use. A small magnetic closure would solve the problem."
2.0,Much darker than other sunglasses...like described.<br />However these are not size medium. I had another pair that were medium and fit snuggly. These are huge on me and almost fall off if I move too much. Only using while driving instead of all the time because of the larger size.
2.0,"Definitely NOT one size fits all!!!  My 15 year old daughter barely fits into this.  You have to be very petite and skinny for this to look good on.  The top part is very thin material, It definitely needs a well padded bra and a cami to provide adequate coverage!"
2.0,"The description said &#34;run big&#34; so if you are in between sizes, order size smaller!!  Not the case, neither Large or XL fit.  Sooooooooooo tight.  I wear either a L or XL, depending."
2.0,"My daughter absolutely loved these but for that price they should have lasted longer. My daughter only wears them around the house and isn't rough with them but with in 2 weeks all the beads, ribbons, flowers etc. started falling off. It's very annoying considering how expensive they were."
2.0,"lots of pockets .flimsy,cheap"
2.0,"This product could be wonderful if the material were not so cheap. Also the fake leather trim pieces look so cheap. It's a cute cut, although it does run small, but the main problem is that it's junk."
2.0,"One of the pockets has a hole in it, right out of the bag.<br />Other than that, they fit great, look great and I like the weight and material used."
2.0,I wore these to the beach in Aruba for a few days - scratched badly all over lens. I would not recommend. Two stars because the design is very cute.
2.0,"I have no problems with this shirt, except that they shipped the wrong size (or their sizes are way off). I ordered a 3T, and the bag is labeled as such, but it is much larger than any 3T I've ever seen, and the tag only says &#34;3.&#34; I've included photos with on of my daughter's current 3T shirts for comparison. The shirt was only $6 (with shipping), so I am not going to bother returning it, especially all the way to China. I guess she'll just have to grow into it."
2.0,"Graphic was too large for T-shirt. Also, it was slightly short for the size and wide. Concerned about shrinking after wash so I returned."
2.0,Hard to open but just as described
2.0,"I've been re-watching Parks and Rec during quarantine and decided to treat myself.  Shirt description said it was a slim fit so I sized up. Didn't have to as it doesn't seem to be a slim fit. Unfortunately, there is a bleached spot on the front/back. Less noticeable on the front than the back where you can't miss it. Further, the screen print isn't level at all. I have ordered Ripple Junction t-shirts for years and have never had a quality issue. If we weren't in this current situation, I would definitely return it for a refund. However, under the current situation, I'll just keep it as a quarantine shirt. Definitely recommend checking your shirt upon receipt."
2.0,I ordered this for my twins and I...2 sizes bigger. It was still way too small. Not for tall individuals at all.
2.0,These are not 100% cotton socks unlike the description said.<br />I'm giving two stars because they are still cute.<br />But I'm not sure if im going to keep these because of the materials.
2.0,At the end of the day the were crunched up at my ankles
2.0,the cups are too hard formed they don't work with my top size and makes it odd fitting
2.0,Shirt was even smaller than expected and fit somewhat oddly. It almost looked like I was wearing a women's shirt. I have returned it.
2.0,"The romper is super cute, and I purchased it for my son so he could wear it for his first birthday party. I was so disappointed when it came because it barely fit my 11 month old son. It was incredibly tight and unflattering... I thought they were supposed to be a harem pants fit, but they were super tight around his diaper region. Granted, my son is on the taller side, but he's not as tall as a 3 or 4 year old (the size I purchased). I knew these would be a bit small since they're coming from Asia, but c'monnnnn... it should have at least fit my 11 month old."
2.0,Great length if you're tall - hit at my knees. True to size. Ordered a medium - 32D-26-35 5'8.5 and 145lb.<br /><br />2 stars because I purchased two skirts and both were stained.
2.0,"Thes3e dress shoes to make my grandbaby feel special. They did, but would not stay on properly. She would be walking and they would twist or something."
2.0,It's nice and all but it just looks a lot thicker and bigger than it Actually is.
2.0,"I returned immediately because these shoes were cheaply made. For that kind of money I expected better quality. After reading the story of the Tate family's shoe business on their website I expected much more from them. Also, the buckle was dis-formed & rubbed against my ankle weird. However, very cute sandal."
2.0,"I was so excited to get this! They are very cute, I got them for vacation. I wanted some thing my daughter could were in the water and with her outfit too. I am very upset about the sizing! She wears a toddler 7 all that was available was a 7.5 so I though she had room to grow! Boy was it off!! Either I was sent the wrong size or the size chart needs to be looked into! I could not get them on her foot at all! I do not have time to send them back!! I do not see the size of the shoe any where on the shoe!"
2.0,It was two months before this shirt was delivered and it was not the quality expected but return window was closed
2.0,Not very confterable.
2.0,"For one, it was supposed to have a hood and it did not. Second, it is almost too small and I bought a large, when I normally wear a medium. Tight across the shoulders. If I would have known this, I would have bought an extra large."
2.0,"love the suit, but it faded too quickly!"
2.0,Material not good quality. Sent back for refund.
2.0,The hole where you insert the key is too large. My key moves around too much
2.0,"The image shows a beautiful one of a kind skirt! When it arrived, the size was odd, the material was weird, the waistband of the XL i ordered was more like an XS. It feels like a plastic bag!"
2.0,"I thought, ""Oh, boy! 17 (or 30) pockets!"" Well, they were a pain in the neck (literally) Some are velcro and not deep enough for a phone; some are buttoned and inaccessible; some are inside, some outside, and it's truly hard to remember where I put the lens hood, filters, aspirin, lens cleaner; clip on sun glasses etc. I'm not kidding. It's too much. What I should have looked for was a lightweight vest (this isn't!!!) with four or five pockets. It's like the old joke: A man with one watch always knows what time it is; a man with two watches is never sure. In the two days I used this vest, I wasn't sure where anything was and, again, four pockets with Velcro were not only hard to open with one hand, but only 3"" deep if that, and the edges of the pock were very uncomfortable. Last, while I may wear a large shirt, this vest seemed to be an extra large. And, ""light weight"" was a joke. I was sweating after half an hour at 78°. I return this for a credit after just two days, and I have not even tried to replace it. It certainly is not a ""photographer's vest."""
2.0,Not as thick and luxurious as expected
2.0,"Cheap material, thin, not as expected"
2.0,"This Bracelet smells, waiting for the smell to go away before I wear it! Plus the snaps won't stay snapped! Haven't wore it yet, hoping that the smell goes away & it will stay snapped!"
2.0,Bought these to put in my safety glasses....would not stay in place.....very disappointed
2.0,"Cute gloves; but they arrived with a hole in them.<br />Update, I was promptly send a replacement pair with no holes."
2.0,"I would have given this product 5 stars based off of my first purchase, but my second purchase of an additional 6-pack of underwear but in grey are way too tight! I ordered the same exact size (M), and the black ones fit perfectly, I mean perfect. They are the most comfortable underwear I’ve ever owned, so why not get another set but in a different color, right? Sadly, as you can see by the photo, the change in color seems to have changed the sizing by a LOT. They are smaller by about 2 inches. Try your luck, if you get the right size, these are amazing and worth the money, but be aware that the sizing is inconsistent among various packs."
2.0,Too small and the product looks MUCH different in the picture.
2.0,"The shirt was SUPER small, definitely not a Medium. Unable to wear and did not return in time to get a refund. The quality seemed decent, but the sizing is awful."
2.0,"I wear 3X - bought the 4X just to make sure.<br />And it didn't fit.  It's says made in China on it, so I just assume Asian people don't know fat people too well."
2.0,"Adorable outfits, but they shrunk significantly in the wash. Fortunately, I was able to hand these down to my younger daughter."
2.0,It runs about two  sizes too small in the XXL size.  Because it was tight it shows any curve and is very sheer.  I would not recommend the White.
2.0,"The quality is very nice, but the white leotard came with a black stain on it. I had to order another one, which has yet to arrive. Very disappointing."
2.0,Great looking boot...it’s pretty loose fit in the foot...the calves are SO tight you’d have to be a 14yr old teenager to have them fit. They’re straight up and if you stretched em I’m sure it’d mess with the integrity of the boot. Disappointed for sure!
2.0,The toe box was tight on my big toe. It was a no go
2.0,"Bought in the winter when on sale.  Lasted till yesterday when the strap detached from the base.  So guessing 2-3 months of use.  For a $50 flip flop, I'd expect a longer lifespan."
2.0,"It hurts around my big toes, i have to wear a thick socks for some comfort."
2.0,In less than 24 hours an arm broke off; and in less than 48 hours both were busted. You'll find better glasses at the dollar store 😤😡
2.0,"I do like the print of this dress, and the material isn't pitifully cheap, but not great either.<br />My main issue with it (and most empire waist dresses) is having a large bust, the dress rides up too high, not having enough material to cover anything other than my breasts.<br />This dress has the same issue, but worse than others. The elastic falls along my bottom bra line. I'm short, so if you're tall and large chested I can't even imagine the time you'll have with coverage."
2.0,A little disappointed that it wasn't exactly as the photo...but considering the woes I have had with the whole wedding dress process I will just keep it and have it altered to my liking. You get what you pay for.
2.0,These are horrible! They literally show every lump and bump especially for us larger ladies that have cellulite!  they are not flattering!!
2.0,Ordered these for groomsman and they were entirely too small some even ripped as they were put on.
2.0,"Nice job, guys."
2.0,These earrings are of very poor quality. I didn't even try them on because they looked so bad:(
2.0,It hangs funny. Color is really not great in person (brown). Not a fan.
2.0,Too small. Definitely size up. Not very comfy- but it does look cute.
2.0,Just receive and just returned.  Items were way too small.  Will be reordering in larger size as the items looked good for summer wear.
2.0,"I need a 2x in women’s size.  Pretty dress , would have bee perfect for my grandsons wedding. Guess I got to keep looking."
2.0,The sizing and shape was awkward the waste was a little small and then they were too long and wide around the legs
2.0,Cannot get front closed
2.0,"Not well made and seams are not made well.  It was too sheer for the. Type of dress it is suppose to be, and it runs small."
2.0,These are absolutely adorable however a very heavy charm and the chain dosen't hook. Made me kinda itchy where it lay took it off and seen it didnt even latch.
2.0,Very average quality. Center seem on hat crooked. Front car stitching crooked and one side where brim and side come together is buckled. I’d return but recovering from surgery and don’t need the hassle.
2.0,Shorter than I expected and not nice fabric
2.0,"Smaller than we expected, so we sent them back"
2.0,After a couple of weeks the pin separated from design. Now it must be glued back on. Not a keeper.
2.0,Very pretty however the elasticity is horrible. My wife really wanted these and they don't even stay up an hour
2.0,"Nice shirts.<br />Good quality.<br />Absolutely the worst sizing I’ve ever experienced. 85%?of my shirts are XL,  fit a bit loose.<br />So I ordered XL.<br />Opened up the bag looking forward to wearing.<br />DAMN!!! Har to fight it on.<br />Long story short.... the XL I received are smedium’s.<br />I’d go as far as smalls. My skinny 17 yr old just got some shirts<br />Order 3X maybe 4x if your large or XL.<br />NICE SHIRTS THOUGH!!!<br />Sizing sucks!!"
2.0,"Maybe my nose is just huge and I do not understand ring sizing (both very possible), but the end of the ring doesn't go back into my nose. This means that the end of the hoop is resting right on the cuff of my nostril, and the end of the hoop is visible. I would much rather have the end disappear in my nostril, like it should. Again, this is most likely my inability to judge sizes correctly, but, honestly, how are you supposed to measure your nose?"
2.0,"Ordered to go with new red leather jacket.  Don’t be fooled by look.....the outside makes it appear to have a nice arch support.....not so, almost flat inside."
2.0,I thought it was prettier
2.0,This too is cheap looking.  I returned it
2.0,"This watch by Audemars Piguet is quite ugly. But at least it's reasonably priced, unliked some other ones out there. I don't feel as if I was robbed out of all my savings to buy this watch at all. And most importantly, shipping is free which is a nice perk. I give it two stars."
2.0,Wore this for about2 weeks before it made my finger super itchy. Took it off and it went away pretty much immediately. I have worn Qalo before with no problems.
2.0,"Its nice & big( I wear a 22 in womens). My main problems were, it took longer to get here than I was expecting & the other big thing is that on both sides, there  are 4 ugly crease/ white lines going down the front. They are super noticeable. I'm sure its done on purpose because they are spaced evenly on each side. It just draws your attention to the bright lines when wearing it wrapped around your neck. I'm keeping it  for a few day's to see if I can get passed it but knowing me, not likely. Other than that it is nice but if you have O.C.D like me this might bother you too much, well atleast they are spaced evenly."
2.0,My husband wears 3 xl pants and 4xl shirts. I read these run small so I got him a 5xl and they fit nice with some comfort room. But they fell apart most had a hole in the pocket at arrival and by the first wear the bottme were detaching at the seam.
2.0,"This made me look like a polygamist. I'm not trying to become someone's 11th wife, I just wanted a cute, comfortable dress for work."
2.0,"I only wear this watch when I'm active and don't want my phone but need to know the time, and last week I realized the time was wrong, I reset it and again time is wrong so I'm guessing battery is dying already, after only a couple of months."
2.0,Dislike the two magnets.
2.0,The goat head snapoed off while I was putting it in.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:97434fca5b61d1c4fcdbb93b0af684bd]] This product fit as expected but I was not happy with the quality. I noticed there were two holes in the fabric and one leg cuff was stretched out.  (see video) I also ordered a gray pair that arrived in good condition however the thigh area felt tight when sitting down. Both colors were the same size and the black pair did not have the issue in the thigh. For comparison I ordered both in a medium and usually wear a size small. I wanted a baggy feel to the pants.
2.0,"This might be a great dress for some people but as a curvy girl, it was not for me.  I am not particularly blessed in the chestal area but somehow, the bottom of the cups were riding up and I had to pull it down constantly.  Could be that I needed a bigger size but it fit well everywhere else.<br /><br />Ok, I lied. I did not like the back.  It's a straight back with no curves given for the butt.  So it kinda... looked frumpy on me.  I really wanted to like it too."
2.0,I guess It’s true. You get what you pay for. Broke after one wear. Another one arrived broken.
2.0,"This ring is pretty flimsy.  The bushed silver look isn't attractive.  I actually thought it was coming with a smooth finish so I was disappointed.  I got it for my cat loving 12 year old for Christmas, she has yet to take a second look at it much less wear it."
2.0,"Metal clips keep opening and garters keep detaching from my stockings.  Looks great, great material, but does not serve its function for me at all."
2.0,Holds the cards. A bit flimsy
2.0,"I expected these to fit in my normal pierced ears, but they were too big. I wiggled them into the holes any how and finally got them to fit. They looked really cool, but they were painful. After I took them out I couldn't wear normal earrings again for a couple of weeks because my ears had to heal."
2.0,"I like the product but I lost it the same day I got it. The chain wasn’t good, I will recommend to buy your own chain. I almost made my Uber driver to go back to look for it. The flower was so cute 😭"
2.0,"Too heavy, too wide."
2.0,"I need more time to try to stretch them out but they seemed just as tight as the size small. I have both, as a matter of fact these might even be a little tighter."
2.0,No calienta y es bien caro
2.0,"I am 6’ 180 44” chest, 33” waist so the  XL fit like a blanket.  Should of ordered a large.  Could not wear the pants without looking like a clown. The sleeves were to long.  Wearing was a little frustrating needless to say. Ended up cutting the belt and straps about 6” down and pinning it. Threw away the pants, out of time to return.  Otherwise quality was about average. No pockets."
2.0,Runs too small...and the material is a bit see through.
2.0,Not the quality I was expecting. Thin and feels kind of wool like-not as silky as I needed it to be.
2.0,this was a disappointment. I will make a gift to a small child. Cheaply made.
2.0,The waist is high which I love but they sag in the crotch and don’t look flattering as you wear them.
2.0,The product wasn't what it looked like in the photo.
2.0,"Like the style, but the medium was quite big and there was no return option.  I failed to realize this when I purchased it. Love the style, though"
2.0,Really liked the screen protector and the bracelet looked amazing for the price. But after about two weeks of wearing the bracelet the coating is coming off and the bracelet is turning from more of a silver to a rose gold color in places. Disappointed.. :(
2.0,Nice...but way to small to read.  It's like a watch for a child...not a grown man
2.0,Very comfortable and fit just right and the shoes
2.0,These are so big- ridiculous on my 12 year old daughter.  I would love to get a smaller pair.  She received them as a gift.
2.0,nose pads were missing from glasses. They werent even in box. cannot wear comfortably threw them out immediately
2.0,Cute but too small. Size for a teenager.
2.0,All underwear already have a hole on right side seam...
2.0,A bit cheap looking. The metal isn't real strong.
2.0,I should have paid closer attention to the size of this product. It's way to small for me
2.0,"Just hit a hard workout at the gym and was disappointed to get off of the treadmill and look like I pissed myself. Could be cute for non-sweat activities like lounging, but do not break a sweat."
2.0,Bad quality material. But I kinda expected that from the cost.
2.0,Have to replace the product on a regular basis.  Don’t recommend this item if you have to use them daily.
2.0,This necklace probably would been better if chain was longer (kinda short) but you can tell it is definitely cheap once you see it in person..
2.0,The headband was far to small and broke right away.
2.0,Worked indoors. useless going from indoors to outdoors.
2.0,"Leaked, fogged up quickly. Disappointed. Quick delivery though!"
2.0,"I purchased these for my daughter's birthday, she's an Aries and an artist. They arrived on the 30th (which was early, I was pleased about that) she opened them on the 31st and one of the horns is now hanging off, it's April 1st. Very disappointing."
2.0,Cute glasses but my son popped out the lenses easily within the first 2 minutes.
2.0,"Wanted to love these from the moment I saw the photo but, either that beautiful young lady wearing these pants has been hand fit and given the appropriate size- bc, that sizing cannot happen using the Sizing chart reference provided!!<br /><br />I followed all the steps and measurements and even erred on the side too of big vs. small! Well… I’m here to tell you the data given is not realistic or compatible to these pants- Ordered sz. L and for reference I was trying to fit 5’5”, 155, 30” waist.. with a rolled cuff if length was too long- these didn’t fit through the waist- AT ALL!! Not if anyone wanted to breathe and wear them! The cut through the hips with adequate did not present or appear in any way like the photograph… And what is so frustrating, we have been on a hunt for a parent just like this!! Who knew it would prove so difficult..Not if anyone wanted to breathe and wear them! The cut through the hips with adequate did not present or appear in any way like the photograph… And what is so frustrating, we have been on a hunt for a parent just like this!! Who knew it would prove so difficult..<br /><br />Material used is lighter in weight but, not airy like I had hoped or, as photographed. It feels to be a mix between a casual cotton and a synthetic athletic substance- which doesn’t allow for the comfort or pant to hang right or give the desired look.<br /><br />I gave this to start for the construction of the pant itself. It seems to be made of solid construction- I also think it may fit the most obscure of sizes.. and therefore gave a second star for the possibility that it could look good on some- it just clearly missed the mark for us. The only way for this parent to be more successful is a better size/fit chart that actually matches the specific item.. along with, photographs that better depict actual appearance of the pants when worn. I hope this information can help your decision… Feel free to let me know"
2.0,The bracelet has beautiful work but it was missing the closing clamp.
2.0,Super cute but I'm not  too happy unfortunately since this luggage was not cheap. We traveled to Italy and I held my breath on the way back because the wheels were just about to break on me. We made it home but obviously I expected more than one trip out of this luggage. I have another trip to Europe coming up in couple of months and I definitely can't trust those wheels to make it :( Expected better quality for the price.
2.0,Too tight sent back. Buy at least two sizes above your current fit
2.0,"The ring is not the same as the picture, close, but not the same. It has less diamonds in the halo and the center diamond is smaller than in the picture. I wore this ring for about 24 hours. Already the silver metal is coming off & it looks orange on the prongs."
2.0,The guitar fell off.
2.0,they fit like capris and dont cover my  belly unless i use supenders to hold them up. lame.
2.0,"small, asian fit"
2.0,"Poor quality, I do not recommend a purchase."
2.0,"Loved these when I first got them. Fit like a glove and kept their shape. I bought more to have in my drawer and they were made differently all of a sudden. They no longer had the 2 seams going down the backside and worst of all, they all started separating from the band after a few washes."
2.0,I was expecting the fleece lining to be a bit thicker than what these are...I have purchased better leggings that cost even less than these!
2.0,"These shorts fit me fine when I tried them on.<br /><br />The Nylon/spandex fabric is too warm, however.  I felt warmer just trying them on at home.<br />I will consider these for winter, but they are not going to work for my warm weather riding.<br />I did pull too energetically the first time I put them on, and the pad did not go in the right place.  To put them on correctly, I had to do as little stretching of the short as possible (like installing pantyhose without tearing them).<br /><br />The inseam on me was roughly 6 inches (did not find that information)."
2.0,Broke really easy maybe I have a larger head but  were tight.
2.0,"Sized up for my hubby, they were still VERY small/short. Loose threads all around the pockets. Overall not good quality."
2.0,Disappointed in the quality of this &#34;scarf&#34;. Looks cheaply made. Bought this for my DIL and was so sad to see the lack of workmanship in this piece.
2.0,they are made for people with skinny fingers
2.0,"Read the other posts as i should have before i bought it. Hangs crooked looks silly, cant expect much for that price. Like something you would get at a dollar store."
2.0,smaller than i expected
2.0,They were cute but run small so I gave them to someone else and
2.0,My daughter ordered a 3<br />Pack and went through 2 pairs in one night of classes because they ripped very quickly.
2.0,Too much fussy material
2.0,This top runs small. The sleeves are not as long as I would like. That might be because the tunic is a size smaller than I had hoped.
2.0,Fit was ok just did not like the strings popping and falling apart.
2.0,"I am 5’4” and 118lbs, ordered a small and shorts were more like an XS. The material is not at all soft like appears in the photo. It feels more like straight up plain cotton t-shirt material (and I don’t mean the soft, ring spun type). Not impressed."
2.0,not to good of a glove for cold weather
2.0,"Pro: Fit as expected, got print001 very pretty.<br />Con:  I thought the bottom area was a bit too big in terms of length.  But the biggest con:<br /><br />IT STUNK!  And, it smelled like  a very strong petroleum, I was scared it was cancerous!!!"
2.0,"I liked the style, but I had to return it because  the cup was way too big.  It was big between the breast area and upper side of each breast."
2.0,"Probably fine for a smaller person, I happen to wear an XL hat and this is way too small."
2.0,Pretty flimsy. I bought a couple of these and they  never lasted more than a few months
2.0,Cheaply made and the zippers on every tie have broken within a just few weeks. You get what you pay for.
2.0,"these were fine, but the embossing was more barely and indent with some color added. I ordered three as gifts and one was ""printed "" well off center  - i contacted the seller and never got a reply."
2.0,The necklace was nice ... but the stones were to small
2.0,Nice quality fabric but much shorter than I expected
2.0,decorations on bar are nice.  the bar is too thick to fit in my piercing.
2.0,I would rate these as dollar store item or lower-end flea market glasses with a registered name.  The arms will break or disconnect easily.
2.0,"Sizing is off, size 38 was closer to a size 32."
2.0,"The zipper is all jacked up, like the pattern got cut crooked, it does not run straight down. Or maybe it dried this way after it was washed. Either way, it’s weird."
2.0,Glasses are tilted to one side which make’s difficult to wear one pair totally. Other pair is little better. I need  them urgently so I had no time to return. Feels like I paid for only 1 pair not 2 as the second one is useless(damaged).
2.0,The color is good. The emblem is good but the material is cheap and thin. I was very disappointed
2.0,This dress is so beautiful but when I put it on it was so uneven! At first I thought maybe it’s supposed to be? I really don’t think it is. It’s too off. 🥺
2.0,A bit different than picture.
2.0,Small & skimpy.
2.0,I ordered the black stainless steel watch band and case combo for my 42mm Apple Watch. The build quality was excellent and the magnet on the band was extremely strong. Unfortunately it did not fit my Apple Watch as the description said it would. It was almost a perfect fit but the watch is not able to snap into place so it constantly pops out. The watch band is currently unusable to me.
2.0,Looks good but feels cheaply made
2.0,Looked like a rag.
2.0,tarnished and turned my ears green
2.0,Only wore for a couple hours then the front middle broke!
2.0,Material not good.
2.0,"The wig doesn't fit too nicely on average head, but it'll do the trick on Halloween, overall average wig for halloween"
2.0,"Nice, but I notice that it was missing a stone.  So I returned it, it should have been checked before it was shipped to me."
2.0,Wore it less than 3 months and the finish of the rose started to come off.
2.0,This skirt was just ok....it looked very plain on me and didn't have that wow factor I was going for. I ended up returning and getting a pair of leather booty shorts instead that looked much sexier.
2.0,"Set was fun while it lasted. Zipper on the hoodie broke after 1 use and i was unable to repair it, or get a replacement from the seller."
2.0,I loved the style of the earings. But they do not hook properly. They are pretty bad quality. I can not wear them due to their inability to hook.
2.0,"I'm not a fan of the fabric, feels and looks cheap...."
2.0,They are very wide and have no arch support.
2.0,They are cute and seemed sturdy until I went to put them on for the 3rd time and the screw came out and was lost
2.0,The pearls were shaped like hamburgers.... grooved on the outside and pull shaped.  I guess for the money they are fine and from a distance they are acceptable but up close.... not
2.0,"Came in looking great, but when I went to put it on the zipper completely broke. The material seemed nice but never actually got to wear it. I was able to return it for a full refund and the customer service was great about it."
2.0,The hood was too small for the size of the cloak. The trim was also fraying out of the box. And the quality is just too poor.
2.0,The ruffles are only in the front and don’t go all the way around like I was hoping for. I am 5’3” and it was super short on me. It was a little see through on the top for me as well
2.0,Sent item back<br />Too big
2.0,Did not come in colors shown but I'm not picky but this is still false advertising
2.0,Horrifically awkward fit.
2.0,The ears I couldve made myself..not impressed. Waste of my money
2.0,Much bigger than the photo. There is no sizing so I thought they were going to look totally different. Going to return them
2.0,"I am a D cup. The support is &lt; than medium. The cup itself i poor quality not strong. I guess I got what I paid for, 2 for the price of one. I gave the 2nd one away."
2.0,Not what I expected will send this back
2.0,Medium was. Little too short in length for me. I’m 5’ 9” so boob cups didn’t line up<br />Right
2.0,Just received my package about 5 mins ago. Opened the package and out comes the main attraction; broken. My heart was broken with it. I was definitely looking forward to wearing this.
2.0,"I really liked the style of this, but it's thin plastic. Straight plastic. It didn't look bad, but I knew it would rip pretty quickly so I returned it."
2.0,It's a nice looking bag but within 2 weeks of use the strap detached. The durability just isn't there.<br />I received an email from the company asking if I was satisfied with the product. The email requested that if there was a problem to please give them a chance to make it right before leaving negative feedback. So I responded that the strap detached. Their reply was to let Amazon handle it. So I did. I got a refund and went elsewhere for a new backpack. Why the offer to make it right?
2.0,Nice umbrella but can't stand on its own.
2.0,"one of the stones.. I’ve bought a lot of jewelry from your store, so far, Ok.. except this one time.."
2.0,Me gusta pero pequeño
2.0,"I wanted to like this Jacket, but the bottom half (high-waist down) flares out and is way too baggy.<br /><br />I was looking for a slim cut, and wasn't expecting what I got. I don't really know what shape this would be good for as the shoulders are appropriate for the small, just not the lower 3rd."
2.0,I expected a cotton material.
2.0,"I bought this brand some time last year and they lasted just as long as other major brands like Adidas and Nike. I ordered a new pair and they lasted just 2.5 months. Even out of the box, the quality was not the same."
2.0,the material isn't great
2.0,very disappointed.  Was supposed to me multiple color but came as one color with the same saving.
2.0,Got a large and it fits more like an XXL
2.0,This is a great looking product but it took a long time to come and when I got it just two days past and then it broke. And I take very good care of my things.
2.0,"More for a child.. I bought it expecting it to have some weight to the watch, it was made of a light plastic material. Like I said more for a child."
2.0,Was not the color I was thinking. Was more of a copper than orange. Style was also not what I was thinking. Will be returning. Material felt nice though.
2.0,They do not keep sweat from getting in your eyes. More of a fashion accessory than function.
2.0,This was smaller than expected and too short for this tall girl.
2.0,I was very disappointed with this dress. The color is more of a dusty rose opposed to the blush pink I ordered and it is very long. I am 5'5 and even with 4in heels it was on the ground. The zipper was awful. It. Did not want to go up and I had to have help zipping it even though I had plenty of room in the dress. The dress did have good support. I am a DD and after the corset was tightened felt very supported and comfortable. The dress was pretty but the cons outweigh the pros and I will be returning.
2.0,"Arrived dirty!!!! Halter top is more narrow than shown. Too narrow for wearing any bra without exposing most of the bra Fabric shows every line underneath. (Even when wearing smoothing shapewear, even that sticks out like a sore thumb.)"
2.0,Not great fabric - WAY to small - I ordered my usual size (large)and it is skin tight<br />It shrunk even more when washed - would not recommend
2.0,Doesn't feel secure when it is snapped on.
2.0,A bit on the cheap side as far as quality. But for the price it's probably fair. I do like the retro style and they said well.
2.0,It looks beautiful however it was broken when I received it
2.0,Waaaaay too big. Even following sizing charts!
2.0,sooo...the picture beautiful - clearly this is a stock image from fashion closet that I realized only after I purchased. One thing I wish Amazon could do better is to filter 'imitations' or at least make these sellers unable to use stock images.  These are clearly 'hand-sewn' - there is no tag and the material is not that great.  But I have them taken in - they will work for a weekend stroll.  Ask questions before you buy - too many imitators - the joys of buying online.
2.0,This is the second time you've asked for a review on this product.  I thought it looked cheap so sent it back for return.
2.0,Not the color the picture says it is.
2.0,"The chains are just ok.  As usual,  the photo is deceptive,  this necklace is something one would wear poolside,  chlorine and all."
2.0,It was too small and really short so I gave it to my boyfriend's little sister who is about 7 years younger than me.
2.0,It doesn't look like the standard camo . It has black bug looking things on it. Quality is ok.
2.0,"The color was beautiful, but started to come off at the slightest ding. Also, the clasp doesn't stay closed, so it was a waste of money in my opinion. It sits in my drawer not getting used because I refuse to use something that could cause me to lose my $100 piece of equipment because it doesn't stay clasped."
2.0,This runs really big.  My taller 4 year old usually takes a 5t and this was really big on her.
2.0,Total waste of money they shrunk half their size after washing and are paper thin
2.0,The top is more for REALLY bigger chested women. It look nice on the tummy part but tight on the thigh part. I'm a 36 D and size 10-12 pants weight about 185 and 5'3 my thighs are on the thicker side but not crazy big but these cut off my circulation to my thighs. Top of this flatten my boobs down and did not have any support.
2.0,these are not even close to dry fit material.  do not recommend.
2.0,This pumpkin graphic is big and crunchy. It feels heavy when wearing and pulls on the front of the shirt down. Definitely get what you pay for on this one.  I couldn’t resist when I saw the price but now that I have it I’m not sure I’ll ever wear it. It’s very uncomfortable and cheap looking.
2.0,This dress is very difficult to put on based on the placing of the zipper. I returned it
2.0,Tooooo small. Not a shirt I would have purchase if I had seen it first. Cheap material. And poor quality. Thin fabric. The only thing cool about it is the logo...
2.0,"Item was crammed into a small plastic bag and wrinkled to the hilt.  Not at all what was advertised.  Material is thinner than it should be and fits awkward.  It fits at the waist area, but the bosom area is much too gappy and big.  I returned for a refund and ordered a different style dress that works beautifully.  This quality does not seem like a cocktail or evening dress, so use your own judgement if you order for a formal event like I did."
2.0,"Super cute at first glance... they looked just like some earrings I purchased at Loft.  However, after one wear on 3 different pairs, the tassels are pulling out of the earring.  Don’t waste the money.  You will be disappointed."
2.0,I got 2 neutral prints and the rest were girlie. They do soak through to her pants and anything else. I add in a washable pad and it holds. Fit my 2 year old she's around 21 pounds
2.0,I don’t like the material. It’s thick and not very comfy.
2.0,It's OK but not at all as described.
2.0,I loved it on the Today show and they said it would work for any body type. I am 5’2” and 135lb. I looked like the good year blimp. It would be adorable on anybody thin.
2.0,"While I like the look, unfortunately, the black chain broke within a week. Thankfully, there are three in the pack but I am now anticipating the need to buy more and will be looking at other options."
2.0,fit rather tight on my 12 month old
2.0,"poor quality product, much thicker than described"
2.0,Smaller than previous pairs I've purchased
2.0,"Not the best quality dress, it should be half the cost. Ordered a medium and the chest area was just odd. And the line in the center of the dress made the entire dress unflattering. Unfortunately sending back."
2.0,"I bought the set of 4, and only one somewhat fits. The other 3 are so small they don’t fit. Very disappointing. Cute fabrics though"
2.0,"With footprint and fly, it takes way too much time to set up and tear down. Too many lines means too many lines that can break.  Stakes must be used. Condensation was great. Air temp in tent was cooler than outside. Returning. Lightweight but the set up and take down was too time consuming."
2.0,Order a bigger size than what you currently wear.
2.0,Not true to size poor quality
2.0,Not a fan of the material. It is cheap and inflexible. Not quite as pictured.
2.0,"Se rompió el cierre en la segunda puesta, pero el color es similar al oro"
2.0,It was beautiful when it arrived but wouldn't stay on my feet and broke instantly after wearing for 10 mins. Very disappointed that I paid 10 dollars for something to just break.
2.0,"Ok fit, but the color was very dingy to be white. Perhaps the other colors are not faded.."
2.0,Have worn it for a couple of months & 3 of the stones have fallen out!
2.0,A hole ripped in them only after a few hours of wearing them.
2.0,Lens not that clear. But for the price I'll be ok
2.0,I wanted to like these but they came smelling like wet dog and completely dirty on the bottoms.
2.0,"if you are tall, this fits like a mini dress"
2.0,"The level of comfort these were was 4/5 stars. I really enjoyed how you can adjust them to your face type. My downsides is that I first cleaned them with hospital grade sani-wipes and it left residue streaks that you can’t even get off with soap and water. It got worse as the days passed that I literally had to toss them. It probably didn’t last me a week either. I’m kind of bummed about that. So NOTE TO SELF AND OTHERS when purchasing this, wash with soap and water!"
2.0,"They're pretty good sunglasses, they do their job, but after a week or so of use the plastic frame broke on me. So overall I wouldn't really recommend them, unless you be super careful with them."
2.0,They are poorly made and one pair is made with a hot glue gun and fell apart just from opening the pack
2.0,"Not really what I was hoping for, sleeves are short, pockets are awkward, not super long on me and I'm only 5'2. Was hoping I could bundle up in this thing but that's not the case."
2.0,"Fit was awkward, very small and confining in the torso for a medium. Wish it fit, love the look."
2.0,Tarnished/faded
2.0,"They are very sheer, not quite what I was expecting."
2.0,"Really cute, however they turn skin green after a week or so."
2.0,They are too wide.
2.0,"I'm a solid medium in dress casual shirts, ordered a medium here, the shirt was awfully wide with abnormally long sleeves. Returned the shirt"
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:f43161a0116bd3fb943546242e053d92]] True to size, but not what I was expecting.  This shirt is so thin and the hood doesn't match the plaid.  Doesn’t feel like a quality shirt!  Maybe, their other color options look better…<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)"
2.0,Order larger size.
2.0,No support and no good for big boobs. But good for around house bra
2.0,"Sending back. I got a pair of crawlers on Etsy a couple years ago and it was perfect. Had no issues with them falling or looking crooked. Unfortunately, this pair I just received won't hold in place. Feels flimsy too."
2.0,Prints look nice but feel like hard oil cloth. The t-shirt with full front print feels like armor. Disappointed...
2.0,Lateral way too thin. Will be returning
2.0,"I'd take a picture, but I'd get banned for indecent exposure. This is great for someone with no breasts. I got the extra large. The bottoms fit fine. But the top is... Well...I guess I can use it as a belt."
2.0,"After going back to the listing I see in small writing it says you get only 1 out of the 5 advertised and at random but this is a complete joke. Sure it is cute, looks just like the picture. But for the price? Advertising is BS."
2.0,"This bra is not very good. The pads made the bra worse. If you get thinner pads for it, the bra is ok. I really had to work at getting it adjusted to fit ok. I decided order from Motherhood. They have a way better one in this same style. It cost a bit more, but worth it. You can use this style of bra whether you are pregnant or not."
2.0,It's just a plastic sword. If it were under $5 I would rate it 4 stars but it's way over priced.
2.0,"I'm wearing the ring right now, but the metal is flimsy. It easily becomes misshapen and warped. Once, I got it caught under the lid to a toy box, and it bent flat enough to get stuck on my finger."
2.0,Zipper
2.0,"This bag is really cute, but it isn't functional. Within a month of using it, it has broken over 4 times. The straps disconnect from the purse, the metal clasps that held it together just fell apart, the zipper broke, and the pouch in the back's lining is falling apart. I'm very disappointed that it in no way is holding up at all, especially because it's so cute."
2.0,"item is same as on the pic but upon arrival you can tell right off it's not a coin -or even metal, the gold face and edging is gold plastic and 'extremely' light weight. the lettering, eagle and numbers are flat, unlike a real coin.  Even more odd because they include a original price tag with in the box as costing $269 dollars, I'd be really _ __if I paid that amount for it. It says Swiss movement and could be but hey, what do I know?"
2.0,Lace ripped first time I wore them
2.0,"Fit was inconsistent. Color was winter winter white, not white."
2.0,Not what I expected! It also does not fit unless you have the body just like the model
2.0,Definitely a nice cool material. It actually runs a little short. Perfect for petite women but not tall.
2.0,The teal floral print was not the same dress compared to others i had previously ordered. HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT. the dress was shorter and it didn't have the extra flap to not show your bra. This style was a cheaper knock-off version. Order any other style or print.
2.0,They don't look much like the picture tho
2.0,Feels thin.. I ordered another jacket because I wasn't sure that my daughter would be warm
2.0,"The necklace is pretty, but the charm fell off as soon as I removed it from the bag. The loop holding the moon on the necklace also looked like it wouldn't hold for long."
2.0,"This is the first case I have ever had of &#34;buyer's remorse&#34;, but I should have know by the attractive price of one cent, plus $6.00 shipping.  I thought it might be a close-out item, and the seller would be making a bit of profit from the exorbitant shipping cost for an item that weighed &#34;nothing&#34;; so, I take part of the blame."
2.0,"Pants are great thin cotton, exactly like another drawstring pair I have. Perfect for summer or casual wear. I love them, but sadlly, they need to produce these in more than 3 sizes. I am a male with a 32&#34; waist. The &#34;Small&#34; ones are made to fit 24&#34; to 36&#34; — but that is too large of gap in sizing. With the Small there is too much waist for me and they don't really stay up well despite the drawstring, which was another deal breaker. If small was broken down into extra small (24&#34; to 30&#34;) and small (31 to 36&#34;) then they might be a better fit. I don't mind the baggy legs, but the waist size needs to be more incremental than just the 3 sizes offered. Six size groups would be much better. So sad that I have to return these. They could have been five stars for sure, and I would have bought more of them as well."
2.0,This shirt is not for me.  It looks very sloppy and I am not thrilled with the material. I even tried reversing it to maybe wear it a s a pajama shirt but the inside is so shiny and  it nice looking on the outside.
2.0,"cut outs are tight, the lace trim does not match side to side... poor workmanship"
2.0,"Acceptable. They are a good fit but the fabric is very cheap, thin and polyester-ish. I don’t see these lasting very long after a few washings."
2.0,This band was too big and not adjustable. I had to return it. I dont even have a small wrist.
2.0,"Ordered this for a bridesmaids robe at the last minute. Was planning on embroidering a name on the robe. It arrived in a WalMart brand zip lock bag with no tags. After taking it out, there were stains on the tube and obviously worn. There was a greasy stain on the back neck line and the tie had makeup on it. You didn’t have time to get a new robe so I washed it but had to wait for it to dry so there wasn’t time to embroidery it. Very disappointed I had to gift someone a used and dirty robe with no tag."
2.0,I think you should order a larger size. It runs small. The fabric is creepy feeling. Too much cheap polyester.
2.0,Very cheaply made and not even close to the image used 🙁
2.0,Fit very very small.
2.0,"No good quality, too samol"
2.0,Unable to figure out how to use this behind my head as shown
2.0,"I returned this top as it is not as pictured. The top is straight up and down and not roomy from the waist down. The material is thin and while I liked the color pattern on it, the rest of the blouse was not for me."
2.0,"It had an awkward fit. I am only 5'4&#34; tall and the item was ordered according to the sizing chart but it was too short to be a swimsuit cover-up. Pretty, but I returned it."
2.0,"Would have kept these, but I was worried the material of the shoe would take one scuff and just scrape right off. It felt very cheap and it looked cheap. I hate to say that because these actually were comfortable when I tried them on and they are pretty close to the style I've been looking for."
2.0,The lobster came off of the keychain two days in.
2.0,No me mandaron el que compre
2.0,Product is cheaply constructed. Handles ripped from bag during first use with very little weight in bag.
2.0,"Too small, weird nylon sleeves, very much a disappointment."
2.0,"face and layout is what I expected<br />weight and feel is good/what I expected<br />price is excellent, colorways excellent<br />clasp- NOT SO GREAT- its fallen off more than once, luckily into my bag, but will expect I wont be in possession of this for soo long"
2.0,Conversstion piece becasuse its different
2.0,What I received was not what I ordered. Received gloves and long pearl necklace. No bracelet or cigarette holder. Made due with what I had. No time for exchange or refund. Still had a great time at the Great Gatesby birthday party though.
2.0,"Only tight in the bust! Boat neck terrible for sunscreen! Does not wick! Probably flattering for c-cup and below women, but being buxom, I ordered by bust size as recommended, and that is the only place the shirt compresses anything! Even the sleeves are floppy, & I have muscular arms. The heathered shirt snags on everything and catches on velcro like a beast!!! The shirts have no spandex, so even if they were 2 sizes too small they would not stretch where they need to. If you are looking for a shirt to wear as a regular stretch shirt and are smaller than a D cup, and moderately fit, it will look cute. I purchased for under uniform, and it is far too loose and floppy in the sleeves and waist."
2.0,"I was expecting really tiny rings so I decided to go with these even though a lot of people were saying they were very small, the only problem I have is the metal, whatever made the black hoops black chipped off of the hoops and made my peircing infected after only wearing them for like 2 days, I guess if you don't like the black hoops then I would get these because they are good quality, but the black ones chip off super easy so just be aware."
2.0,"Arrived broken, and easy fix, but still annoyed. Also the necklace itself looks kind of cheap and the eyes are very plasticky with glitter. Not the worst, not the best."
2.0,Not impressed. Doesnt feel like a wide width. Feet could be a little swollen from the day but that’s the reason I buy wides so my feet can make long days. Heel is thinner than most of my current shoes so I have decided to return and order the next pair. Love amazon prime!
2.0,"Its so cute but so awful. It made my fingers turn green, much to my dismay. I was starting to love it so much too."
2.0,Returned.  I’m 5’7” and it didn’t reach my ankles.  It also looked a bit fartsy on me.
2.0,Made rather cheaply but serves the purpose.
2.0,"Unfortunately, I sent this back.  I am giving it 2 stars because it got to me quick, it was very pretty.  But....It was almost impossible to get a hair elastic on the bracelent and even harder to keep it there!  I hate it didn't work out."
2.0,I love the flexable material but they're way to big in length
2.0,Cute but Broke easily
2.0,The front length was just a few inches below my crotch. The front top didn't close like in the picture and too low to wear a bra. The material is very thin and see through.  I may wear with nipple shields and boy shorts or something.  Was too late in getting it returned.  I'm 5'8 38D. Long torso.
2.0,"They were decent as far as looks, but the seams holding the pants together were all coming apart. I washed them once and immediately had to toss them cause the thread was coming undone."
2.0,I love this band! Its been so cute. In less than a month the design is starting to rub off. I expected it to rub off but not in 3 weeks.
2.0,I tried using this cloth on my palladium wedding band to buff out of small scratches. It got the scratches out but it also covered my highly polished ring with very tiny scuffs all over. It's a lot less shiney than when I bought it now. Don't use on palladium or if your ring is highly polished.
2.0,"Received the product today and I am not happy about the looks of it, it looks very old and faded. Packing is good and taken good care of."
2.0,The front part is cut way higher than shown in the picture
2.0,These gauges would've gotten a 5 star review if the correct size would've been sent.  They are gorgeous and good quality however the size is off by at least a gauge. I ordered a 6g a d they fit like an 8g. So I would order down a size.
2.0,"gloves don't fit at all! fingers are for an infant at 12 months old, not a toddler!! helmet thing is like wearing a pillowcase in aluminum foil! cheap china made garbage resold to rip off Americans by greedy sellers!!! stay away!!!"
2.0,Very cheaply made. Arm holes have elastic that is way too tight
2.0,"The shorts on this pajama are cut small and although they fit, they are a very skimpy medium and not comfortable for sleeping.  This is in contrast to the top which is sized as expected.  The material is OK but not of the quality that I had hoped for."
2.0,"Was really good for not fogging up my glasses and was comfortable. Strap broke after a week. I wasn't stretching it more than it should have been by i don't like too much pressure on my ears. If they replace the straps, I would get these again."
2.0,"NOT what is pictured at all, but they're still cute."
2.0,I loved the pattern and that it had pockets but the fit was awful! It did not seem cut in the same ways the one in the picture was or it's not meant for bigger girls.  Very sad
2.0,Broke immediately but it was really cute
2.0,"Watch band fits, however watch face covering is too small for my Series 5, 44mm watch"
2.0,Comes apart in a month or two from just wearing it to a desk job and not doing anything stressful
2.0,Cfff
2.0,"the box is the nicest thing about this , wallet is cheap ."
2.0,Not for every face.
2.0,Runs 3 sz too small
2.0,"it is Very thin -- you could see my shirt thru the weave of the sweater. I expect Irish Wool sweaters to be thick and warm. This sweater was more of an ornament than something I'd count on to keep me warm in the fields, or even the city.<br />I returned it."
2.0,"I purchased this because of the overwhelming good reviews, the fair price point and the fact that it had pockets. I am a small woman, I usually wear a 2 or 4 and I purchased the size small based on reviews. I also read that it was supposed to have an elastic top so the small would have been perfect; it does not and is not. It does not have an eye and hook closure so it makes it very difficult to close, and when I do get it closed I can barely breathe (27inch waist).<br /><br />Somebody said that is extremely wrinkly and yes, YES it is. If you would like to spend most of your time ironing before you wear a garment, then this skirt is for you. I would much recommend to just buy from a different retailer, even if it costs more. I'm glad I took the plunge and I tried it but I definitely will not again.<br /><br />Pros: Reasonably priced, the pockets are well done.<br /><br />Cons: the sizing is way off, no eye and hook closure on the zipper, feels cheap made, almost costumy."
2.0,"I love the light blue but was so very disappointed by the VERY CHEAP vinyl type strap.  Honestly, I was embarrassed by it.  It made this leather bag look SO CHEAP.  I had another tan purse strap (from another pocketbook)… so I threw out the cheap one and put on my beautiful leather one.  NOW it looks like a nice leather purse.  So very disappointed."
2.0,Needs to be bigger in width. It slips off when I wear it.
2.0,"Runs on the bigger size I ordered a size down and it's still too big and yes I measured myself first. As far as the structure it's bendy so it's not good at all for for waist training maybe a cincher for under clothes to make you look smaller. Was expecting more but for the price I can't complain. I got what I paid for, and it's pretty much pointless to me."
2.0,Cute but much smaller than described - returned
2.0,"it,s okay"
2.0,I love and hate this scarf. It’s so soft and pretty but it is unraveling! Today is the first day I have worn it and strand after strand is coming loose. Absolutely ridiculous! What a waste of money.
2.0,"So, the sweater looks like it's loose and stuff in the presented image. However, I got an extra large. BUT the sleeves are tight! Like skin tight! So, you cannot even were a short sleeved shirt under it. Only a tank top. Also, it does not look like the picture. It looks like they ran out of fabric and used whichever one they could find and pieced it together. I am not saying it looks THAT bad but it doesn't actually look like the picture. It looks more like the other ones but in original colors. And it is not as long either. Nor did I get a wash bag. It came in a plastic bag for shipping too. BOOOOOOO. I am only keeping it because it still looks OK to wear outside."
2.0,Thought it would be like a book bag but is more like a large purse
2.0,"Cute style, but I wasn't a fan of the fabric. The fit was quite big on me."
2.0,"Super cute when it arrived. Do not swim or shower with my watch on, so just from regularly daily wear the print rubbed off."
2.0,"I was excited for this hoop and I read that the beads were glued on, so it was perfect!  I got it, followed the instructions on how to put it in. Then one of the outer silver beads came loose. Still thought it was ok. Less than 5 mins later I looked in the mirror and the bead is gone…somewhere. Sad."
2.0,Downsize. I would have returned it but I tried it too late.
2.0,"Very thin lightweight material....I couldn't wear it as a skirt but opted to keep it to wear as a swimsuit cover up. A month or so later I finally had the opportunity to wear it and within a few hours I noticed the stitching was coming apart where the waist band (portion with tie ends) was coming apart from the skirt portion. By the time I got home, about 6 inches had come completely undone and I was having to sort of tuck and roll the separated skirt portion under the waist band."
2.0,"I initially purchased this hat for my nearly 6 month old daughter to wear this summer - the product description claims this hat will fit children ages 1-4.  However, up on receiving it, it was apparent that it was FAR too big for an infant's head.  I then tried it on my seven year old daughter and although it fit her better, I still felt that it was too big for her as well.<br /><br />I ordered the hat in &#34;white,&#34; but what I received was anything but - much more of an ivory or eggshell color - and the underside/inside of the hat is a quite obnoxious sea life/fish/starfish pattern.  I really love brimmed hats and bonnets like this on my girls, but this one would definitely not be suited as a dressy accessory, but more for a day at the beach.<br /><br />Although it may be the perfect accessory for some, I didn't much care for the hat and will likely be returning it.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
2.0,"Very, very small compared to similar products and the blue is not indigo or dark blue but a bright almost tacky royal blue."
2.0,"very thin, light weight.  and not particularly well made"
2.0,I sent it back because it wasn't true to size. It was super big.
2.0,Do NOT purchase this item.  They run large and you have to pay for the return shipping!! The UPS clerk said it would cost OVER $100 to return the shorts!!!
2.0,The girlfriend is way too small to see...was disappointed.
2.0,I ordered a 2Xl that was all they had  they sent me 5Xl and it was the size of an extra large the suit itself was of good material and if it would have been the right size I probably would have kept it but seeing how I needed it for this week not gonna happen they were good about returning the package though
2.0,I’m 5”3 and the dress was too short and size was smaller that expected
2.0,"This sock is not for plus size. I am 5-9 height and 200lb .gave to my little sister 5-9 and 149lb perfect fit for her,"
2.0,IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE IF IT WERE STERLING.BUT IT DOES WHAT IT ADVER.<br />IT S COOL.
2.0,"From the picture it looked as if it were more fitted/ tailored. It was very shapeless, lots of underarm fabric. Ended up returning."
2.0,"It's not cloth, it's more like plastic and stiff."
2.0,"This is advertised as a 4 pack but only 3 came in the package. Unfortunately, the package was missing the blue color which is the more universally liked color in my house. My son and daughter fought over who should get the teal or the pink whereas this should have been a non issue. Not majorly happy. Otherwise, they are cute and functional. Not super durable - one of the clasps broke on day 1"
2.0,I did not realize that the music blasts out of the beanie. I thought there were small speakers that went over your ears. This was a bust
2.0,"Fabric is nice, but gives you a mad camel-toe"
2.0,"Very pretty nighty and robe.  I would recommend it.  However, the color was not what I had ordered.  Can anyone help me with this issue?"
2.0,You can’t really see that in description but they made of shiny/glossy fabric which points on all your leg imperfections (cellulite)
2.0,They are nice looking leg warmers but they are not very warm.  The shearling top is soft but the rest of the material isn't very soft or fitted.
2.0,Was not able to send back.was not able to wear.  Gave it to my maid.
2.0,Shrunk two sizes after one wash. Don’t buy.
2.0,"The first set I bought fit well (perfect size for my face, under chin, etc.), but the ear loops were messed up and not adjustable. So I exchanged for a new set. On this set the ear loops work, but the actual masks are about half the size! I swear they are child-size -- I have a fairly small adult face and they are too small for me. Now I get why people were complaining about them being small, which was not the case for my first pair. They just must really vary in productions or something. I'm returning the second set and not risking buying a third."
2.0,These are way to short if youre a tall lady! Im only 5’8” and they are easily capris on me :(
2.0,"Kinda lengthy review, but really feel it'll help for those considering this blouse. I'll also add photos when I have time.<br /><br />I have to say, the style itself of the shirt is really nice! I got many compliments on it from coworkers and customers at work. The cloth was a bit thin, but I wasn't too worried about it at first.<br /><br />I just took the blouse off from wearing it to work today and found THREE areas already coming apart in the stitching! The first one I noticed was on the side at the end of the shirt. I was bummed initially, but figured I could just stitch it right back up before wearing it out again. Then I happen to lift the sleeves to find holes in BOTH underarms of the shirt! Stitches in multiple parts of a brand new blouse SHOULD NOT be coming apart after wearing it only ONE TIME! I honestly see no point in fixing the holes just to have them mess right back up in the same or new areas. It may not even be able to handle repeated fixes over time anyway due to the material already being thin enough as it is.<br /><br />I usually wear XL in tops and that's the size I purchased. I'm not the thinnest person, and I had to get the shirt over my boobs (bra size being 36DD), but the fit was actually awesome once I got it on. The fact that it fit me so well and I got so many compliments on it is why it disappoints me so much more that these holes could form so easily. MAYBE this wouldn't have been the case if it came in an XXL, but I doubt it. I won't say don't buy it; you may not have the same problem if you're roughly my size or thinner. I'll just say, had I known the blouse would mess up that easily after only one day of wearing it, I would have used my money elsewhere.<br /><br />Measurements:<br />Height: 5'3&#34;<br />Weight: 210-215lbs.<br />Hourglass/Pear-shaped build<br />Bust: 44&#34;<br />Waist: 35&#34;<br />Hips: 48&#34;<br />Bra Size: 36DD<br /><br />Update: I've finally added the pictures. The third picture of the stitching is the worst of the three since this one goes through both the front AND back of the shirt, with only a couple stitches holding it together."
2.0,"very small in size, it is cute, could have had better description on it even though the dimensions where listed  i should have measured the size out. i will watch what i order now by getting a tape measure out and looking at the size before ordering again. much better for a child or very young adult i hope it will hold what i need it too. disappointed in the product"
2.0,"It was beautiful, but too too small"
2.0,Too small and fits oddly. But it's so pretty!
2.0,The sleeves are too long. Disappointing
2.0,"This is one very solid tool.  However, I bought it to remove the back of a very slim men's dress watch, and it's blade is clumsily thick.  No chance of it working on fine men's or small lady's watches.  Will have to keep looking.  If you want to remove easily removed covers, this, or a screwdriver would work well.  Not for thin watches."
2.0,It looked really pretty for about two weeks then it became tarnished and an ugly brown copper color.
2.0,The scarf is different and adds character to any plan top. The fabric is very thin and the ends come apart easily. This scarf is not meant to be worn often. More for an decorative accessory than for warmth.
2.0,Band size ok.<br />Cup is huge and not comfetable
2.0,"It was way too low, according to their size chart. I also don't like how it rolls up to my crotch area, way too uncoverable to wear while riding. Next time to get two sizes up. However, the padding is very comfy."
2.0,Love the style bit xl is still very short.
2.0,The romper was definitely soft and felt warm but it looked like a bunny costume with teeth instead of stitch.
2.0,Comfortable leggings but they started falling apart at the seam within a couple of wears.
2.0,I'm only giving it 1 star since it's cute. But the fit is off..if you have bigger arms it won't fit and the whole clasp broke a day after wearing it. It was good for the night but even costume jewelry should last at least a few hours.
2.0,Love the print on these leggings however one pair busted open along the seam in the crouch the first time my daughter wore them.
2.0,"Just received the watch strap. It is extremely stiff, almost impossible to get on the wrist, makes the watch stick out. I might send it back, I like the color, though"
2.0,Nice but these run small so beware when ordering.
2.0,WAY too short. I bought a small and I’m 5’7
2.0,"The sweater is the same color, but it is definitely not oversized at all it fits like a normal cardigan you can buy from Walmart.  Not worth the money either. Go to old navy instead."
2.0,Doesn't look how I thought it would.
2.0,not as pre..tty as I thought.. and too small
2.0,"I ordered and received a large. The picture makes it look like it will fall just at your hips to show just a bit of stomach, which is the style I was aiming for. When I opened it and held it up to myself, it barely went over my chest. The sleeves were decent sized and the colors were as the picture but it is waaaay too short for my own preference. If you’re looking for a very cropped sweatshirt this is for you. Returning this."
2.0,"Like ...but be aware they are very warm, thick almost like a fleece lined pant,  will work out well for my fall outdoor activities."
2.0,Unfortunately was nowhere near true to size. I could fit the tight elastic around one thigh. :-(
2.0,"Cute if you like long, full coverage, frumpy nightgowns. There's a lot of material that bunches up."
2.0,Not for working out!
2.0,These fit my 8 year old super tight on thighs I'm a size 10-12
2.0,"It's okay, but nothing special at all.  I actually returned it because I wanted softer material."
2.0,"Dull, lifeless, nothing like photo other than form.  Misleading to say sterling... Nothing sterling about it."
2.0,"Super cute but super tiny, I thought the locket was bigger"
2.0,"Wanted to like it, but it was unflattering"
2.0,"The jacket is a large as specified but way too short and nothing like the picture. I was looking for a nice barn coat, but this is a waste length jacket. This jacket is very light as well and I thought it would be a bit heavier. I cannot send my girl to the barn in that, it doesn't cover her assets if you will."
2.0,"I was excited to get this sweatshirt, but it runs very small."
2.0,While I really like this product it's not the same design on both sides of the headband. One has a medallion the other does not it's plain.
2.0,The quality of this material is not as expected. The silver dress is a bit see through. Fabric easily gets caught to things. The slit it too high and should probably be sewn together at the top unless you want your under garmet to show.
2.0,"I am disappointed that it doesn't fit... but on the other hand, it's great incentive to loose weight. Thanx for the blow to my already waning self esteem. most other tops I buy in this size not only fit, but are as flattering as possible."
2.0,Memory wire.. is a rubber band ..you pull to hard..it breaks ripped off is what they are<br />All of them are bummer they are adorable.
2.0,Came in with white stains. Hopefully it’s good and not his else. Washed it with hot water. Fits well a tall 9 years old boy.
2.0,"I received this order in a timely manner and the suspenders looked good. However, the bow tie came as a silky material, which is fine, except it is all shredded looking. There’s snags and loose string hanging off of it all over. This was for my ring bearer to wear for my wedding but now we have to go out and purchase a different bow tie that isn’t completely snagged. If it wasn’t for the snags this would be a great purchase, but unfortunately it’s not."
2.0,poor quality，super thin fabric and the white color looks a bit grey⋯⋯
2.0,Not very Practical
2.0,"I loved my first scarf so much I bought one in Navy, and received it stuffed into a plastic bag, a wadded up, disheveled mess. Not at all packaged nicely like the first scarf so I believe this one was a returned item. I will sanitize it, and I like it, but I expected a new item, not a returned, handled by others item!<br />Not cool!!<br />I don’t need anymore germs in my life!"
2.0,Soooo pretty bit arrives tarnished with black spots on it
2.0,"I ordered these socks because of the stadium pictures. I received socks with just the Oriole bird on them. They were also marked MSRP $14--$4 less than the price listed.  I thought maybe it was just a mistake, but then I saw the other comments and realized that the information does not match the item"
2.0,Not the true size much smaller.
2.0,"Not what I was expecting.  It's a lot bigger than I thought.  It lights up uncontrollably.  Quality is poor.  Reminded me of something you would get out of a gumball machine.  Not trying to be grouchy,  was just disappointed.  I put it back in the box and stuck it in a drawer.  😕"
2.0,"I was looking forward to receiving this purse and really wanted to like it. But no. Just no. The front and back of the purse are made mostly of see-through plastic—a material very similar to the large zippered bag that a bed comforter comes in. The see-through plastic is surrounded by a 5/8” border of alligator-patterned black PU leather that looks and feels like plastic or vinyl. The purse has a strap closure with a buckle. When the strap is buckled, the top of the purse is still open and the contents will spill if you dropped the purse. The see-through plastic collects fingerprints easily and quickly took on the look of a smudged mirror.<br /><br />As a grown woman, I just can’t imagine using a purse made this material. The word “cheesy” comes to mind. For those who prefer not to use leather, there are a lot of nice man-made materials generally available that don’t look so plastic like this purse. Perhaps if it was a bright color, a little girl might use it — but it’s probably too large for a little girl. And the style is too mature for a little girl.<br /><br />The purse is 9.5” long, 6.5” high, and 3.75” deep (thick). The sides, bottom and strap are also made of the black PU leather (plastic). The strap is attached with 5 1/4 inches of gold tone metal chain at both ends. The crossbody strap is adjustable in length with a clasp type buckle.<br /><br />It came with a small black toiletry bag that is made of a material like straw, has a black-zippered top closure with a gold zipper pull, and the inside is lined in black fabric. It measures 6.75” wide, 5.5” high, and 1.75” deep (thick)."
2.0,it just didn't fit me. too small at the bottom of the ribcage.
2.0,"I just received this and the product description is misleading. The dimensions provided are that of the PACKAGING the necklace comes in, not of the pendant itself, like I had assumed. It seems pretty pointless to give packaging dims.<br />Its frustrating because I bought this for a costume and was looking for something much larger, but other than that I suppose it will do. Photo added so that you can see the scale."
2.0,"The top was wayyyy too big, fits more like a 2XL. The bottoms fit to size though."
2.0,"A big disappointment.  Spend the money to get a better quality bag,"
2.0,You can't see in the pictures but the straps around the arms connect to the side of the cup which pushes the cup backward. The bottoms also fit so badly something is bound to slip out.
2.0,Product was not great as the picture shows what looks like a completely metal piece and when it came in the top half was fabric that didn't match the gold claims on the bottom half ☹️
2.0,"These shorts are NOT as shown in the photo. They are a hideous yellowish mustard color. The fabric is thick & after drying, shorts are horribly wrinkled."
2.0,"Runs really small. I ordered a M, but will have to do a XL"
2.0,The straps are uneven with the buckles cuz cloth is way shorter on one strap. The patterns are great.
2.0,Was great to start but the zippers started failing rather quickly.  Was very disappointed as I really liked the bag.
2.0,Great little dress for your man ...not to wear out in everyday life .....
2.0,"The material was a bit stiff and the length was short....I felt like I was wearing a pajama shirt, but not a comfortable one."
2.0,"the material is pretty thin, sticks to itself"
2.0,"I received these shoes at the end of March of this year. My son was very excited and loved them! However, it’s been less than 2 months, and they’re completely worn out. He only wore them as “play shoes” after school and on weekends."
2.0,I wish they would put measurements on product.  To large to wear. Hurrs him to wear because it spreads his fingers apart.
2.0,"For an ex-large, this blouse look like it was a size 3.  Not sized according to American standard. Be careful."
2.0,After washing this shirt it shrunk in length. I never put it in the dryer either. Would not recommend. Very disappointed especially after paying what I did.
2.0,"I bought the tan color blazer. The first close up picture shows a textured/ grainy look to the blazer but the blazer is smooth and basically the jacket part of a suit. Not at all what was pictured. I was looking for something to go w jeans, not half a suit. Super disappointed."
2.0,Cute just ran small
2.0,"After only 3, maybe 4, times wearing it, holes started forming EVERYWHERE and it is now too ruined to wear anymore."
2.0,No support might as well go barefooted. Probably better for the beach and not a water park. I didn't order from the link my daughter sent me and hers were so much better
2.0,Super cheap. They fell off within a week because they just weren't made with enough purchase.
2.0,"size is not marked buy a size S, but the spare is large sleeves is a size M, the seller should correct this.<br />The quality no complaints so far, we will see in time"
2.0,Fit fine but not sturdy at all
2.0,"So disappointed! I run from an xl to a 2x depending on cut, brand,etc. When I shop online I always order 1 or 2 sizes bigger in case they run small or hubby does laundry and shrinks it. Too big can be fixed with higb heat or alterations. But if its too small.....<br />I ordered a 4XL, as soon as I held it up I knew I had just wasted money. Not worth dealing with the distributor, so, I gave it to my friend who wears med/large and it fit her perfectly.  It is so nice and soft, I was heartbroken."
2.0,Stitching is very uneven. Doesn’t look like the photo.
2.0,Wore out quickly.
2.0,Not a lot of support which is a must in the gym.
2.0,"Who makes workout gear hand wash in cold and lay flat to dry? I mean, really? The only reason I can think you might do this is if you're afraid your product is going to fall apart in the wash. SMH"
2.0,Cheap synthetic material. I bought these for my mom after she had a stroke for recovery purposes. They make your feet sweat
2.0,"I ordered this top in medium and large. Both fit the exact same in the crop area, the only difference was the large had longer sleeves. I didn’t like either."
2.0,"It works well and fit perfectly at first, but the clip broke off the second week I used it."
2.0,I gave it two stars because I think it's very important the the image being shown is the same product being shipped. I bought this wig because of the beads on the end of the braid. What I received was not the same as in the image.
2.0,"While they are cute, there is no form. They stick to your face. I had to cut a slit in the back and put a filter in them to keep from eating them every time I said a word."
2.0,They don't glow in the dark!! I bought them big so he can grow into them.
2.0,"Item supposed to be a deep purple, actual color is a lighter purple more blue then purple.  I kept it anyway because I wanted a purple shirt."
2.0,"These seem sturdy, however as stated above they are not true to size.  I have 16g glass retainers that I wanted to use these for, and I order 16g and 18g just to try to find the right size.  I had a few left over from a purchase elsewhere so I know they are 16g.  Even the 18g was sliding right off the piece it was too large.  I’ll hold onto them though as the packaging was well done and they shipped quickly."
2.0,Cheap. Returned
2.0,"I liked the look of the pant but it did not fit well. I am short with boxed hips and thicker thighs. Pants were tighter in hips but saggy in groin area and too long. Cute pants, just doesn't fit a shorter person."
2.0,"I don't know. Maybe I should have ordered a small. The medium is too loose in all the wrong places. I have not worn this dress out yet, and it somewhat feels like I won't. I'll probably just give it away to someone a little bigger."
2.0,"I was so excited about this dress. Loved the color, loved the pattern. Wasn't super jazzed about the material, I think I was hoping for something heavier, but I could have dealt with that. I think I'm just too short to wear it. I'm 5'1&#34;, 106 lbs. And it just made me look like I was dressing up in my mom's clothes, even after donning heels. It hit me almost mid-calf. I was breastfeeding at the time, and wanted to find a good wrap dress for a wedding. This wasn't that dress, sadly. But. I bet if you're taller than I am, you'd love it. It just wasn't a good fit for me."
2.0,They are very cute. You almost don't want to take them out. But after awhile they become heavy &your nipples start to hurt. I haven't put them in since. They're cute to wear for a couple hours.
2.0,"These are very uncomfortable bras. I bought two of them, because I've purchased Fruit of the Loom bras from Walmart before, and they've always been fine. But I've been unable to find the kind I like at Walmart anymore, so I took a chance with these.<br /><br />I guess the design changed, because, though I ordered the size I always get, the band was too tight (even on the first hooks), but the cups were huge. When I first took it out of the package, I thought they'd sent a wrong cup size (D instead of C). But no, they were what I ordered, 38C. The huge cups gap under my arms while the band feels too tight, and it's just an unpleasant feeling. Also, they don't provide any lift, even when I tightened the straps. My chest is just kind of flattened, and it's not a very flattering look. Definitely don't recommend."
2.0,They worked for 1 round of doing my hair and they were almost burnt through
2.0,Didn't know that these were safety glasses. NOT what I wanted
2.0,"This is literally the cutest swimsuit I’ve ever tried on. However, I’m normally a medium, but have gained just enough weight lately that I’m between a medium and large. I ordered the large to be safe, and it wasn’t even close. I would need an XL or 2XL to fit comfortably. I would absolutely buy the next size up if it was available.<br /><br />I have purchased this brand before and always fit very comfortably in a medium."
2.0,The top is way too open and the dress it cut too tight. Size up one or two sizes. I sized up but still does fit right.
2.0,The product is good but not as expected. It’s loo long.
2.0,I love the teardrops with the orange middle stone and bought just for this pair. Replacing some starting to wear. I get so many compliments with those. The rest look like they are for cat ladies or Cher on a bad day.
2.0,"Suit fit great! Very comfortable and flattering. Medium. 5 ft 6/134.<br />Wore for 1 month, now there is a dime size hole in the bottoms.would reorder, maybe defect in item? Tried to return, 2 days past amazon allowable return. Disappointing."
2.0,"When it was new, the band was stiff in a way that held it at a weird angle against my wrist, decreasing the accuracy of monitoring. Over several days, the band become more pliable and sat on my wrist correctly, but then the “leather” began to crack and it’s only a matter of time now until the tip breaks off. Won’t be repurchasing."
2.0,"Gave it away, it was made small and the fabric was too thin to wear without a camisole."
2.0,Bought as a gift for a coworker. The stone fell out during a meeting the first day she wore it.
2.0,Ok. These are really cute in real life but a lot bigger than I expected. I did have to return them though because the posts attached to the earring were really loose and were about to fall off. I’m disappointed in the quality.
2.0,they look nice but tend to not stay on well. The latch doesn't stop the wristband from getting larger and loose
2.0,To thin.
2.0,"Had this for just a bit more than 2 years, one of the winder stopped working after a year right as the warranty expired, and a second one failed a week ago, so at this moment, it's pretty much waiting for the rest to fail."
2.0,I've used this for just over a week and it's already messed up... save your money and get something else.
2.0,"Love the price, 5 tanks for $10. Nice material and stitching. Comfortable but way too loose for size Small, so it's unflattering. I'm 5'1"", 112 lbs., and I look pregnant in these. The tanks aren't sized the same either. The blue and black are wider and longer than the others. I missed the return window, so I just donated them."
2.0,This shirt is not tshirt material.  It does not look like the picture.  It's much shorter than what is pictured
2.0,"Not in love with this. Sized up based on the reviews but it was kind of frumpy and the sleeves were too short. Even in a smaller size, the front ruffles hung funny."
2.0,Fabric is flimsy and rough. Has a ridiculous amount of static
2.0,"The threads are loosely woven, so theyare not as warm or comfortable as hoped. I would not purchase them, if I were<br />Choosing items in store. Frankly they poms are useless."
2.0,They hit between calf and ankle with a weird fit.
2.0,Great price and fast shipping they fit my glasses perfectly but I dropped them once and a big part of the polarization rubbed/scratched off them versus my Oakley branded lens that I dropped hundreds of times and they had scratch marks but no loss of polarization material
2.0,"I am displeased with this item. I think that it's misleading that the front is actually a compass when in reality, it is not. The description should state that it is not a functioning compass. It also has some glue or something that wasn't wiped off during assembly. There are also some scratches on the bottle opener part.<br /><br />I also tried to contact the seller via an email address they provide on their website. My email was kicked back to me because their mailbox is full."
2.0,What I got was not what was pictured. Kinda bummed I’ve always loved Chuvora I’ve bought lots of rings from this brand
2.0,Some gems came out
2.0,"Waaaay too small, I should have believed the other reviews"
2.0,"Hate these. Don't buy them. I'm 5'9"" and these hit me at mid calf when it says they're ankle length. The material is not stretchy and it feels like a saggy, stretched out old swimsuit material. They're too big but too short. The pockets are small and slanted so it's hard to put anything in them.<br /><br />They seem to be sewn well so if the things described above don't bother you, these might last a while without getting a hole. I'm not keeping them though."
2.0,"To start with, these glasses are highly functional. Why the 2 star rating? Well, the lenses kept falling off. One day, the left lens fell off when i was biking off road and got pretty scratched up"
2.0,The pattern was cute but the arm holes were too big.
2.0,Looks nice however it broke after the third time wearing it.
2.0,Didn't wear it
2.0,Thought the eye was much bigger thought the necklace was longer other than that decent
2.0,"very dissatisfied. though the fabric was very good quality. Thank You, Although that was only my opinion, they could or would fit better on another individual. We are all different shape and sizes. As the old saying goes""WHAT WORKS FOR ONE,MAY NOT WORK FOR THE OTHER."
2.0,I gave the dress to a special person and they love it. The dress was too tight across my hips so the  zipper was a problem.
2.0,Did not receive bamboo piece or the leggings. Which my daughter was very excited for. Disappointed.
2.0,Not add big as I expected
2.0,Broke when I took it out of the box. Also bracelet part was discolored. Beautiful pearls
2.0,"I gave it a two star rating because I did get my full refund. The dress does not come as seen on Amazon. It has all this mesh material around the top and picture also shows it comes slightly off the shoulders (it doesn't).  It did take awhile to get, even paying for shipping it arrived much later than stated. If need be I can post a pic of it."
2.0,No breast support
2.0,Too loose doesn’t stay on my wrist.
2.0,the gold is a little bright
2.0,"Shipping was quick, they look great, but they smelled like cat pee. Can't get the smell out, makes me sad because I really do like them."
2.0,I ordered the dark blue color but clearly received a light blue color. The fit and feel of the jacket are fine.
2.0,"I’m not sure about sizes, since I never even tried this on. As soon as I pulled it out of the bag, it was clear that the entire backside of the jumpsuit was not printed, and was in fact white. I could see my hand through it. I was really disappointed. I was really looking forward to receiving this. I gave it a couple stars because the print is gorgeous and really cute. I’m sorry I didn’t take a picture, but I gave it away almost immediately."
2.0,It's very cute and very well made. However I ordered a xl and it fits like a big medium. I had to squeeze it on and could barely breathe. I cant return it because my packaging was thrown out and so I am going to have to try and find someone to give it to.
2.0,Very boxy. Not flattering and shaped strange. Do not waste your money.
2.0,I thought thy were bigger
2.0,The watch is really small.
2.0,"These were HUGE on my four-year-old--there was so much material that they wouldn't fit under his clothing. So the size 4-6 is much closer to a 6 than a 4, if you're trying to figure out how big they actually are, but there might be too much material even for a size 6. The waistband was the right size, there was just WAY too much material. We returned these and are still on the hunt for boxers that will actually fit a four-year-old. There were also lots of loose threads and the material seemed quite thin, so not sure how long they'd last."
2.0,Runs huge needs to be tailored for short women
2.0,My kids like these goggle. They come in their own case which they loved too<br />Update: we have had the goggles for awhile now but can no longer use them. The pink tightening clasp has broken and cannot be fixed making the goggles worthless. My daughter loved these goggles but I’m scared to buy another since I have seen several reviews that say the same thing about their clasp.  I may try to contact customer service.
2.0,Sweater was not a womens L (12- 14). It was the size of a child's L.
2.0,"I should have listened to the one reviewer that complained about the back lip. She was right. There is no functionality provided by the back. It's too low. I have no idea why it's even there. It doesn't hold the shoe on, only being something that I step ON with each step, reminding me about how annoying it is. I don't get it. The shoe is too long. I can't wear slip flops and this is the same concept, but with an extra piece that you feel each step. Been meaning to return them and hopefully it's not too late."
2.0,"Love these pants. Unfortunately have to return because I found a hole! For those interested, I brought a size 14 and fits good. I’m around 200 pounds and curvy."
2.0,I bought these and dresses for all my grand daughters. 2 out of 5 tore completely apart the very first time we used them...just shredded apart.
2.0,Pretty but breaks easy.  Mine broke the second day.  Cheap plastic.  My replacement came broke in half.  My 3rd broke the next day.  I gave up on this!
2.0,Too large for me. I mean it says oversized but on a busty girl it just looks boxy. And the fabric isn’t comfortable. Too much like knitted wool. And you can see through the holes in the knit.
2.0,The crotch area is too big. As if these jeans were made for men.
2.0,My last wallet lasted fifteen years. The stitching on this started to go after one year. Credit cards kept falling out.
2.0,The colors are very dull.  Doesn't look like the ad.  Material seems cheap.
2.0,"The little smiley face on the pant leg is cute, but definitely buy a size or two larger than usual."
2.0,way to small!
2.0,"I loved these, I bought 2 for my Tragus. I was so glad they came with diff length bars, but they didn’t screw in properly I noticed. They were super loose.<br />I’ve already lost the top of one.<br /><br />It came apart once before but I caught it when it fell. Not this time. Cant find it anywhere.<br /><br />UPDATE: bought a second pair because these are lovely and I could have just gotten a faulty one, I’ve bought several pairs. Once again the threading felt a little off. I’ve already lost the top to this one too. Different pair.<br /><br />That’s 2 earring I’ve gotten with faulty threading."
2.0,"This was a thick, stiff material.  Lays weird on waist/bottom and I do not have a big butt.  Was a lot heavier than I expected.  Would not buy again."
2.0,Falls apart easy
2.0,"fit was too small, gave it to a friend"
2.0,I had to give it away. I wear a true 3xl. It came and fits my daughter who is a true xl. So tired of Amazon using these vendors out of the country. We can use WISH for that.
2.0,This item was too short and came in with no tags on. Returned with no problems. I’m short torso and breast size 36 B-C
2.0,Water gets trapped under band and smells
2.0,"I liked the idea of this sports bra because I'm large chested and need a high impact sports bra (that's actually high impact) for working out. I ordered the size recommended to me/written on the tag of the bra itself, as well as the one people my size had said they ordered and fit them in the reviews, and was very excited when I pulled it out and saw how comfy it looked/felt. Unfortunately, I couldn't even get it on it was so small. The tag does say L is the right size for my regular bra size, and the cups felt like they might have been right but the band didn't even go completely around my torso it was so small. Not sure what happened here but it's a very unproportional bra from what I've seen."
2.0,Product seems to be made for size 10-12 feet.
2.0,It's cute however there is no easy way to actually put a picture in it :/ kinda a waste of money. Bought it for my little girl so it's basically a cute charm
2.0,The line is curled and I can't get it to stay straight
2.0,"I bought these in medium which, according to the size chart, should fit 7.5 - 8.5 in women's. I wear a 7.5 in wide shoes, and an 8 in medium.  I can tell you right now that there is no way anyone wearing an 8.5 would get their feet in these shoes.  I have a pair of L-Runs that I purchased a few months ago and their size chart went by the actual measurement of your feet.  My old L-Runs are at least a 1/2 inch longer than these and fit perfectly.<br />I don't think these will last longer than a month of daily use for indoor exercise before my toes pop out the front.  Granted, they're only 7.99, but what good are they at any price if they don't fit?"
2.0,"I actually loved these pants. The fit was great, they were long enough (I'm 5'9) and they were super comfy. I'd give 5 stars, but I only washed them twice and the stitching started to come out and there was a hole because the stitching came undone. I've only owned them a month. I might consider buying a new pair because they're so comfortable, but I don't want to be throwing away my money."
2.0,"This bag did fit in the locker, but other than that, I was disappointed.  I'll go back to my $30 Adidas bag.  I found the Glo Bag did not stand on its on.  Also, the interior separating partitions for the interior compartments were flimsy.  The interior zipper broke the 2nd time I used it.  I didn't think it was worth the money, so I returned it."
2.0,The zipper on the back of the sandals splits in the middle while walking.  I have to zip it back down and zip it back up again.  Very frustrating.
2.0,"Strings ripped this first time I wore it... It's a cute shirt, and it fits perfect.. But when I washed it the strings ripped,"
2.0,Runs really big.  Not good for small wrist.
2.0,"Purchased in 8/15, the SilberDream Glitter earrings are small, and the stems are too fragile (bend very easily).  Earrings are more for a child.  I purchased a similar Zin-Zang earrings on Overstock.com  2 years ago, and they were tapered at the edges (not flat as these) and appeared of better quality.  However, they also were too fragile and eventually one stem broke-off.  I expect the same result with these earrings."
2.0,Broke easily<br />But it was very cute while it lasted
2.0,These are cheap looking. They have a great concept with the ear holes to listen to sound. If you have a small head these will look like Mickey mouse ears.
2.0,"Beautifull but too fragile to two of the three I bought, they damaged the minute. very expensive for the quality."
2.0,It didn't fit well at all.  The bottom does gape open and if you decide to keep it you might want to invest in a snap button or two to keep it closed.  But pretty dress and pretty material.
2.0,"Bright lights, cute shoes and true to size. Bought one pair for my daughter and she wanted to get the same for her friend's bday. Both pair had lights that went out within the first three wears. So we have shoes that half light up."
2.0,Was excited to get this for a trip that's coming up but once I tried it I was disappointed. The fit was really weird. Really loose at the top.
2.0,"Cute enough, but material was cheap and fit was a little boxy.  I returned."
2.0,"The colors were way off. Luckily I planed but such a thing. This turned out to be more toward the green-blue family for the majority color, however some people. Which is fine now that I have something to wear it with but was disappointed I didn’t get to wear for my headshots."
2.0,"Update below.<br /><br />Just received it today. Watch is great. World time function isn't the most intuitive. The compass, altimeter, barometer and thermometer functions appear to work great. Oy complaint is that there isn't a watch band that's a stainless steel option. I found a 24mm stainless steel band in blue here on Amazon that works perfectly with the watch and totally makes me delighted with the final result. Definitely not a small profile watch  but I'm a big guy and I really like the size and additional functionality. Watch was already sync'd up to atomic time signal and I just had to adjust my city. I love that it's solar powered so this thing should never have any issues! If anything changes and it breaks or whatever I'll update my review but so far, I'm delighted.<br /><br />I replaced a titanium Tissot T-Touch which was actually my second watch from them in the last decade. Those retail for $800-1200 a piece and require batteries. The internal motors kept busting down after 3-5 years so the hands didn't point to the same time as indicated on the digital piece. After multiple servicing send-ins, I got fed up.<br /><br />This watch has all the same functionality and even with the added $20 cost of replacing the band, still at half cost. The cons are the added weightof stainless steel vs titanium (no big deal) and lack of touch screen. The pros are the light up function, and Casio's strong reputation and warranty. Wash: I went with blue vs ""silver"" so it does add a touch of flair and may not match with all clothing/outfits.<br /><br />Update:<br />March 2022 the watch simply broke. The actual watch face where the band goes to attach to it snapped. I’ve attached some photos. Pretty sad it broke. Bands are not even replaceable because a new band has nowhere to snap in."
2.0,description says they are anti fog and that isn't true i can barely see out of them at times
2.0,They're pretty and you a lot for the money but when I got them I could automatically see that the hoops were going to be too small for my nose. I compared them to other nose rings I had which were also to small and there would end up being a big gap using the ones with the jewels and the hoop. Hopefully I can return them.
2.0,"XL fits like size 8. Received it with an ink mark on it from manufacturing. I want to return it, but the cost of return is more than the purchase price of the item because it is from China. Not happy."
2.0,"The outfit looks like the picture, but is cheaply made and isn’t actually for swimming. It’s not a swimsuit material."
2.0,"Later I bought this as a joke, because it was for drag on Halloween, and I personally did not see a woman in pantehose when weather permiting,with a mini shirt over top of it since before Christmas the calander year of 2012 and the current calender year 2023 in the State of Maryland, The  United States of America"
2.0,The shirt has blue and yellow plaid with a black hood not what I was expecting
2.0,"Had to return, too small around the booty area...."
2.0,Looks and feels like a robe.  Material is robe material.  YUCK
2.0,No actual tummy control... just moves around and makes you look more lumpy.
2.0,"I typically do great ordering on Amazon. I'm bummed. If you're not a detailed person, maybe you wouldn't care. Top is missing all the straps that makes it sexy. I didn't bother trying on the bottom. Returning tomorrow."
2.0,"To start, I got the socks shown in picture #3, ""Cameo Gray"" (Thank goodness) they are NOT a ""novelty"" pattern. I am content with the appearance & fit. While not as soft as many socks, I quickly got used to the feel & they're fine. They do seem to be a little dryer on my feet than average (a good thing). They are the tallest pair of socks I own (neutral issue for me)<br /><br />My 1 issue is $11 for one pair of socks. If they'd been $2 or $3, I would have likely gone 5 stars. At 10, it was hard not to go 1 star."
2.0,I am a sucker for consistancy and the beads were not in order. I had to take it apart and fix it.
2.0,Comfortable sleeping pants but they’re too long for me at 5’ 10” tall. Wouldn’t get these again because they drag on the ground when I walk.
2.0,Maybe it would fit a preteen...def not for a woman.
2.0,"I bought these because they look like the kind of laces that are round, spongy, and stay tied.  Some (not all) Skechers have laces like that and that's what I wanted.  These look like those laces, but they don't stay tied.  I'm continually having to bend over and re-tie the laces.  Other than that, they do the job so I'm giving them two stars instead of one."
2.0,Sleepwear should be flame retardant
2.0,The shoe itself is pretty but not comfortable. my daughter couldn’t wear it for to long. Started to cut into the back of her heel.
2.0,"They look great, but I can't say the insole improves my foot comfort. The insole is so thick the shoes barely stay on my feet as well."
2.0,"Para empezar no es blanca es beige.es demasiado pequeña para las medidas que tienen ahí,yo pedí large pero queda como  talla pequeña,es bonita la blusa,pero no para lo que costó."
2.0,the item split as soon as we used it. Luckily my sissy knows his crafts and improvised
2.0,"I really wanted to love this dress… I got the maroon color and the color is beautiful and the scallops are beautiful, but it wrinkles SO easily!!  I have two boys, one I have to carry around often in this dress is a definite no go. At least until they are a little bit older, but even then if I sit in the car it wrinkles around my hips and looks very untidy with the whole classy cut of the dress."
2.0,Lenses are poor quality and frames are so so.. Not much else to say about these really. Can't really tell that they are polarized.
2.0,"These were too small to cover my prescription glasses, but I had no trouble returning them and then bought the Lo Oval ones that worked well."
2.0,Very tight order bigger
2.0,"The necklace shipped fast and the material felt like a good quality.  Unfortunately, the lettering had a circle in the middle of it, where it wasn't cut out.  I didn't get to return because it was a gift. Just wish the quality of the item was checked before shipping."
2.0,"Not true to size, very cheaply made (no lining/thin). Returned."
2.0,It doesn't have anything that holds it on the top of your ear so I had a problem wearing it
2.0,Returned because the quality of the coat was not thick and worth the cost. Though it said it was light in the description I didn't expect it to be so thin of material.
2.0,I would have liked this more if it had fit as expected.
2.0,Short socks. Thin. Not long lasting.
2.0,"Comfy, but the fold over waistline slides up frequently. I ordered a large for postpartum needs. They are very comfortable, but the waistline and fold down waist just don’t seem to want to work."
2.0,Yellow color is very see through. Fabric is too thin
2.0,"The dress pattern/style and fit were great..... however, instead of a light dusty pink it was more a peachy/salmon color... not even close to the photo advertised. So, for this reason I'm giving it a 2/5.  It's usually the color of a piece that you get it for.... and in this case we needed it for a specific reason (a wedding) and it was WAY off."
2.0,The fabric is a very light weight knit and looks very cheap. The armholes do not hug the body and creates a gap. You get what you pay for.
2.0,"These are comfortable but offer no real support. The material is incredibly thin, such that the padding/cups are too visible."
2.0,The product was like a kids small not a womens small. I needed it for an event at work.
2.0,"Cute patterns. Fuzzy fibers get stuck on the nose. Material is thick, but doesn’t shape well to face. Nose wire migrates around. Ear straps are shedding."
2.0,"Snug fit. Tank part is super thin and slim fit. Returned. Love their bras- was hopeful for this product, but not the same."
2.0,These are okay. They haven’t tarnished but my rose gold pair (which is why I bought the set in the first place) turned gold after only about 4 or 5 days. I probably could’ve bought these from AliExpress for about $15 cheaper and same quality.
2.0,Ordered a size 5 in kids and is super big. What's odd is I ordered a size 2 also and it fit the other boy almost perfect.
2.0,I am 5’8 150 lb. The medium fit through the top and waist very well but the length was VERY short (like barely covered my bottom) so unfortunately had to return.
2.0,Runs really small .
2.0,"Not what I expected, looks cheap, looks used the post where almost black. Post would be to big for a child. Do not recommend."
2.0,"Buckle is installed backwards requiring the end user to waste time reinstalling. Without the belt correctly inserted the extra bit tgat should be held by belt loops is on the INSIDE where it puts pressure on the body and is impossible to adjust correctly. This is so ridiculous.<br />The belt itself (we know the buckle is plastic, cheap enough looking) is sparkly. Yes, it sparkles like 1980s tights. If I wanted a Walmart belt I woukd  have gone to the dollar store and gotten three fir seven bucks. This is overpriced. Can’t wear this anywhere / I’m not all that vain, but I do not want to wear junk in public. This is disappointing and very overpriced. Ugly and sparkly."
2.0,"For the price I should have expected that there would be something wrong or that they would feel cheap, however these actually are completely crooked.  I do not recommend this brand."
2.0,Fit snug. It flattering. Wish I never bought it.
2.0,I specifically ordered the blue dress because of the scrunched butt they show in the picture. Got my dress today and there is no scrunch butt.
2.0,"These are pretty inexpensive so value i guess is okay, but I am disappointed in the material.  They seem to be made of pretty cheap vinyl and they have a heavy odor.  The vinyl also seems heavier than other materials out there.  I purchased 4 sets at once, I wish I did not.  The issue with ordering online is you don't get to feel prior to purchasing so you just do it off the reviews and these seem really high, not sure why.  I wonder how much more these weigh than high end products per cubic foot. I purchased mine directly from the Bagail."
2.0,The bungy chord type strap/shoelace that weaves in and out of the shoe broke. My son has only worn the shoes a couple times when it broke. Thankfully it doesn’t seem to make the show loose or anything. Or make a difference too much on wearing the shoe. But now there is something to constantly tie or worry about him tripping on.
2.0,To big look smaller
2.0,Did not fit like the picture. Very short. Need an undershirt
2.0,"These didn't stick, so they had no chance of working. I live where it is very humid, but I ended up going braless because I couldn't make these work. They do seem like they'd be comfortable if they had any adhesion."
2.0,The dress itself is beautiful but the sizing is definitely off.
2.0,A little over one month and they're broken. The little bow came off. So annoying. Cheap but very bad quality
2.0,"I had ordered this for my wedding dress hoping it would have enough structure to shape me and provide some support. Although it is very cute, the material reminds me of the cheap lingerie you come across at stores like DD's Discount and Fallas, the flimsy plastic boning buckles and warps giving you unflattering protrusions( if you are a curvy woman like I am, this will stick to any rolls you have and the boning will bow out to highlight them rather than tuck them in and smoothen them) and the cup size is designed for a small bust as the dreaded side boob bulge is not very sexy to look at. Granted if I was smaller and slimmer it would have been adorable but alas, this wasn't for me."
2.0,"Fit is great, but the first time I wore the pink version of this it snagged and is pilled on the side. Never had this happen to a workout top before and I have 2 more on the way because I love the fit. But if this black and white one pills I will return the other 2"
2.0,Not for small hand or fingers.
2.0,The top is cute but felt backwards. Turned it around and it felt just the same. Maybe is intended for someone with a more athletic (flatter chest) build.
2.0,"too small for a 3x, more like a 2x. wore it twice and the sleeves are already fraying"
2.0,"Absolutely loved this bathing suit, but I originally ordered a medium and the bottoms were slightly too small so I ordered another one in a large. It was cheap enough to get two. When the large came in the bottoms were even smaller than the medium. Not sure how that works?? 2 stars because the top fit perfectly."
2.0,The material is very thin and the product is on the smaller size.
2.0,"Not as described, stars are too small compared to pictures of models."
2.0,Yuk!!! Only works when you are facing the sun! No good
2.0,The stud itself is fine. But there should be more length sizes. It's the only one I can find that's threadless and theres only two size options.
2.0,This is such a cute little outfit but the shirt began to tear my grandbaby could not wear this outfit but one time what a shame.
2.0,Looked more gold than rose gold in person. Which was disappointing.
2.0,Item wasn’t very detailed. I was hoping to get the little sister but ended up with the big sister. I was able to give it as a gift to my sister whom is expecting her 2nd.
2.0,Bought this for a 2t and it would fit a newborn
2.0,"Normally I’d post model pictures with leggings, but, while the design of these is so cute and fun, the fit is awful. I’m 5’6, 28 waist, 35 hips. I normally wear a size small in leggings. Pant size 6. I looked at the reviews and they said to size up, so I ordered a medium. Super tight on my thighs, so tight my thigh fat poofs out over the seam where the mesh hits the leopard. The scrunch butt is not done well. There’s too much scrunch and it looks silly. It’s big through the waist and hip. What a bummer. Maybe if I can get down to my pre-covid size 4 they will fit me in the thighs, but there’s still that waist and hip issue. Company needs to fix their measurements and redesign these."
2.0,They all come in two sizes which are much too large to wear on your knuckles. One made a good pinky ring. Rest are too large.
2.0,Not true to size.  Way to small.  Almost unrealistic size measurements
2.0,Had to return. Even though I ordered a XL it fit like a L.
2.0,The shiva shell inlay on these earrings is too small to be noticeable.
2.0,"I ordered these Large/Extra Large for my size13 ,They fit My wife who is a size 5.5 ,They should be at least Half price"
2.0,"The size it`s ok, fit as expected. But the color and the effect of shiny it`s totally different from the photo, it looks a normal purple spandex legging, not so shiny and gorgeous as pictured.<br />The legging is thin, so watch out ladies with cellulitis or with few more pounds, this legging it`s going to show everything."
2.0,The swimsuit was a beautiful color and soft but the top was a bit small (34DD) and it came missing the bottoms. Returned.
2.0,I would like my refund back to my debit card not a gift card
2.0,the quality is poor. material is very thin
2.0,"Music from the headphones works fine, however the velcro which attaches them inside the cap is very poor quality, it came right off.  I probably can just get my own new velcro adhesive tab to replace it.  However very disappointing that upon receiving the new item that it fell right off immediately."
2.0,Quality assurance needs some work. This is the fourth sunglass that is unusable out of the 12pack.
2.0,"Don’t go by the size chart. XL is not sized as shown in Size chart in picture, it’s so wrong Wayyyyyy off. XL is more like a medium. I am so disappointed 😔 the jacket looks cute. I based my purchase on others reviews. If you are normally XL you need to order 2x."
2.0,It slides on and off the apple watch easy enough. The strap stay sometimes doesn't do it's job and let's the end of the strap free which could be a problem in allowing the watch to become unfastened.
2.0,Top was way to small. Great color and design. Just wish it would have fit!
2.0,"My previous watch winder was silent but something died and I was looking for a replacement. Beautiful box. Well crafted. After running for about 10 minutes, a small grinding noise occurred. Not loud but aggravating in a quiet bedroom. I tried multiple &#34;fixes&#34; on my own but could not get a fix. I had already discarded the box etc so didn't feel I could return for a refund. This may not be the item to but online if the silent operation is as important to you as it was for me."
2.0,The price was good for a pack of multiple sizes. However one broke on first use and the edges are a bit sharp. Updating the review as more are breaking upon first use.
2.0,"Too large, RETURNED."
2.0,"This dress is beautiful,but it runs very small.  I returned it, but wish they offer a larger size."
2.0,"I love the colors, but too silky."
2.0,I like the design and color of the suit. But I ordered a large and the bottoms were so small. That’s really annoying. If I weren’t going on a cruise in a couple days and had time to return them for a larger suit I would. But it’s ridiculous how small it is.
2.0,"This is a nice dress overall BUT it arrived already coming apart at the waist. Didn’t notice until I put it on. And it wasn’t me busting out of it since it was a bit big on me. That knocks down the stars given. It runs larger, would be best to size down."
2.0,"Not as advertised. The sweater appears to have a faded look to it on Amazon, but it does not. It also was listed as cotton. It is not cotton. It is heavy. I would not recommend."
2.0,"I ordered this for my son for his 5th birthday. When he opened it, it said it was size 5, for 4 and 5 year olds. My son is average height but very skinny, and it barely fits him"
2.0,"My hat size is 8 3/4&#34; and the large was too big for me, which is unusual. Also very stiff, and too much 'rise' meaning too high off my head."
2.0,"I love the style, but unfortunately I have only been able to even open the black ring and it was a bit rough on the edges but once I played with it and wore it down a bit it fit nicely in my septum. I am really bummed I cannot get the other two rings open though, I don't want to use crafting tools as I don't want to damage the rings. Not Happy."
2.0,"It is beautiful, but it is small, it says adult men women, it is not. Very disappointed."
2.0,Very pretty top but the one I got has a cut on it. Would appreciate some feedback from the vendor. Refund or send me a good one.
2.0,Way too small to be considered an XL. I bought it for my husband but had to give it to my young nephew instead.
2.0,"After just 3 days, they got a huge kink in them and I didn't even do anything to cause it. Disappointed."
2.0,crazy small and very difficult to close once opened.
2.0,not easy to use
2.0,"It was too large and too small at the same time. Or else just not made well. Other Chantelle bras have been very good. The gore on this didn't tack at all, yet the hooks were on the last ones and it was still loose. The way the cups are cut, it makes for a slight east/west look."
2.0,I’m not really satisfied with this but I hate returning things. It is fairly heavyweight but it is scratched up. It looks used. It was packed well so it wasn’t the shipping.  I don’t recommend buying this item.
2.0,Didn’t fit my smart watch.
2.0,"This top was cute with the criss cross straps and fit OK in the Bust area,  however the material was very silky & clingy in the torso /mid section and showed every bump or lump!! The length is also much longer than expected?  I would not recommend this top unless  you are a tall gal with a flat tummy and can show off your curvy girly figure!! (I am a bit older... 5'7"", 144lbs , 36C bust and have my imperfections), so didn't work for me).... Returned the same day!"
2.0,"UPDATE: I've been wearing this belt for a while now and now I know what its missing. It needs a better way to hold the end of the belt (the part you pull to make the belt tighter)the way it is now, is pulls right back through, right after tightening it.<br />this has been a really great belt so far. I compared it to one of my other elastic stretch belts and this one was a lot longer because it doesn't need to stretch as much to provide the right fit. Other belts provide less tightness so you have to cinch them down so much that they look like they belong to a much smaller person. I have my belt almost all the way loose (set for 40 inches) so now I can tighten the belt as it loosens or I lose weight ;)"
2.0,large length
2.0,It is beautiful. Just a little small. Thought it was bigger thats all.
2.0,"Indeed the arm is very flimsy So eventually its going to get out of shape, from the illustration picture everything looks good until you receive the glasses. not trying to destroy anyone's business  . Just a quality customer"
2.0,It wasn’t flattering on me. I ordered a medium and it was too big. I think a smaller size would look good.
2.0,Without design makes dress dull
2.0,"When they say relaxed fit, they aren't kidding. My husband could have camped in this shirt! Returned to order a different size and fit."
2.0,Barely inflated. Save your dollars.
2.0,"I opened the bag the belt was in, and it smelled musty. I figured I would air it out. I hung the belt with my others for a few days.  Every time I walked into my bedroom I caught a whiff of must. It did dissipate a bit. I wore it to work, and I smelled faintly musty. A coworker said &#34;You smell like pipes&#34; which,  in my opinion,  was kind. I am hoping it will go away with time."
2.0,Alright product but won't stay tight
2.0,"They are very thin and cheap, and not supportive. One of the three pairs has a hole in the waist. Disappointed but they are just cheap thin leggings."
2.0,im only giving it a 2 because the fabric is in shape and it's still in one piece but i ordered it in a small and got a large!
2.0,"These are poorly made. They don't adjust to widen up enough so that they can use tension to hold the boot on. I can't hang them up, because the boot slips right off the holder. I will keep them so that I can at least use them to keep the shape of the boots, but it's a shame that I can't hang them, as intended."
2.0,"I don't love this bra but I don't hate it either.  I am very picky about bras and have honestly never found any that I love.  The best thing about this bra is the straps.  You adjust them from the front and not the back so you don't have to fool with taking your bra off to fix the straps or try reaching behind you to get them adjusted right. This bra is wide if that is what you are looking for.  I feel I'm either too fat for it cause its so wide or my torso isn't long enough. Update I bought on January 25th, wires come out of it last night May 15th."
2.0,"Like the other reviewers, the item I received does not look like the photo in the listing. It is one strand with multiple colored pearls.  It isn't horrible, but it is not what I wanted and not worth price (even the deal of the day price). Will be returning this necklace."
2.0,"The dress was a little bit small on the top portion, and way to long.  I tried to give this a 1 star but they would not let me.  The material was very thin and the smell was horrible.  I returned my dress.  Looks great in the picture those."
2.0,It is hard to breathe when you are wearing this item
2.0,"Not worth spending what i paid for, cheap material and transparent."
2.0,"Looks great, it's more uncomfortable than wearing a commode for a scarf. Definitely made for tiny people. If you're more than a handful, just don't, unless you like pain."
2.0,Wore it for about two hours and the ball fell off.
2.0,"Does not look like the photo on. It looks like a 50's maid on, and NOT in a cute way. Seriously I looked like I was going to a renaissance fair. I would not purchase this for anywhere but a fair, Halloween or possibly work.The fabric is OK, but does not give much stretch."
2.0,Broke after a couple months :(
2.0,"Cheaply made, too big, and uncomfortable"
2.0,"While the white pearl looking band is pretty, my watch won't count the steps with this band on.  Switched back to the original silicone band, and will be returning this."
2.0,"Too small, and there is nothing to help hold them up.  They begin to roll down immediately."
2.0,Cheaply made. Not dark enough for the sun.
2.0,"A pretty bracelet and lightweight, but there was a kink in it right out of the box and part of the stamped design was missing. It wasn't as flexible as I like."
2.0,"This ran true to size but if you want it oversized and off the shoulder, it's too small.<br />Mine also had a very small hole in front.<br />I'm 5'2 and weigh 145. I wear between a medium and a large. I ordered a large and felt it was too small.<br />Super easy return though!"
2.0,"These are made in Pakistan.  The quality is very mediocre.  Very disappointing for Nike.  The fit is loose (large size).  Also, they are more towards the 1/2 than the 1/4 size."
2.0,They are VERY CUTE!!!  BUT....they make things too bright.  I bought for my 15 yr old but she hated them!
2.0,There’s a part missing and am not happy with that 😡
2.0,"I purchased this as a gift, and it did not come packaged with the cute little verse as shown. Necklace was as shown."
2.0,"The dress was pretty and it fit well.  My daughter was excited about it online, until she tried it on and it was see through! Needless to say, it was returned back to Amazon."
2.0,I love the sweater and it has a button but no button hole for the other side to go in is it supposed to be like that?
2.0,"This necklace puts on easy; however, it doesn't stay flat on the neck, it wraps around itself and your hair gets easily caught in it."
2.0,"While I like the socks, the sizing was incredibly inconsistent within the 5 pairs that were ordered; two fit just fine, but three of the pair I couldn't even get around my heel.  I gave them to my wife, &#34;little foot&#34;.  I wouldn't buy again."
2.0,heel strap pushed foot against toe post.  foot not stable.  no arch support.
2.0,"Wow, i was so excited to get this. Dissapoonted, too large for my head, insert does nothing, looking through the eye holes is difficult. Im not adding inserts on my own after paying $300.00, my $38.00 mask from ogawa is just fine, really wanted to love this mask,"
2.0,"Fabric looks very cheap, also the neck fabric is so unexpectedly long; I also thought the green color looked different in person, I returned it"
2.0,I loved the orifinal purchase of the red dress in this same style because the fabric was thick enough to wear alone but when I purchased the blue colored dress of what I thought was the same product it turned out to be fabric that was much thinner in its consistency. Kept it and like it but not as much as the thicker version in red color.
2.0,"I purchased this with medium confidence after reading reviews. It does fit and that's a bonus. I would even say it's loose. The length is what I wanted. However the neck is tight and I have small shoulders so I'm not used to my clothes choking me. It's definitely cheaply made, which I expected. There is a seam that runs down the entire back of the dress, which is a bit unsightly. By seeing other reviews, I am convinced there's very little quality control on sizing and construction. If you're up for a little risk taking, give it a go."
2.0,It does not fit tight around abdomen area. Does not form the body nice. I returned the dress.
2.0,Barely fit
2.0,"The shirt I ordered was a XXL, I expected it to fit oversized like said in description. It fit like a normal t-shirt not long enough at all to be oversized. I was confused because the bag it came in said “size M” so makes sense why it was small. But I was expecting it to be a regular XXL. Cute design and if it was the right size would be a decent shirt. Cheap material tho almost see-thru."
2.0,This item size chart is extremely off. I purchased this for my 3 year old and these are way to big. The item description needs to be updated.
2.0,Got a little wet and the thing came apart. Would not recommend.
2.0,The heart on these earrings stick out (actually to the back) as if they were a second thought. It seems to me there was something else there originally and the heart was just a fill-in. They look very odd.
2.0,"the first time i ordered they sent me a large. i returned and got my small not even 3 days later. great shipping. but the small was too big. so this cover up runs big period, not small. i am going to return again. and order from someone else."
2.0,So far I have not had my shoes stretched signicantly.
2.0,"The quality of the shirt is not great, especially for price.  The fabric felt & looked cheap and was a little itchy.  Maybe it would be better after washing but I returned it.  Also, the racerback of the shirt seemed to be sewn poorly/uneven; I noticed it as soon as I tried it on.  For this much money, there are plenty of nicer quality and name brand golf shirts.  The price should be half of what it is and even then don't think I would have kept it.  I do think it runs true to size; at 5'1""/112 lbs the XS fit fine.  And be careful, not all colors and sizes can be returned for free so watch for that when ordering."
2.0,Shoe did not seem true to size. Charged fine. Wouldn't buy these again. Had to return both pairs because other pair would not charge
2.0,"Not for swimming or wet, sweaty clothing.  No venting or circulation as advertised"
2.0,Size chart N O T  accurate whatsoever. I even ordered up 3 sizes and this shirt arrived and fits a 10 yr old girl N O T  made for an adult!! Material is nice. It’s sheer. I had to give this to our granddaughter who is 10yrs old..  We had to buy a camisole to wear under this shirt. I personally would not recommend purchasing this particular shirt.
2.0,When my product arrived it was broken. I returned the merchandise for a refund. The necklace is gorgeous though.
2.0,"Nice looking watch and coin, nice weight and feel. Packaging is very cheap in look and feel. Appropriate for a $20 watch. Now the big problem is the winding mechanism and pull stem for setting the time has the feel and action of a extremely cheap watch, one that you expect to get from a five dollar toy. Totally a cheap timepiece inside this case!!!!!"
2.0,I sent it back because it was very itchy and tight in the chest area.
2.0,"Arrived on time, looks good, but - useless as a watch has lost several hours over a few weeks. Sometimes regular, but generally not."
2.0,"I’m an athletic/slim built guy. I have moderately wide shoulders and a slim waist. I need a medium for my shoulders but slim fit for my chest and waist. However, when I buy a SLIM FIT shirt I expect it to have a slimmer taper around the chest and abdomen. I was excited about this shirt but it seems to do the opposite!! It tapers wider than any other shirt that I’ve bought, even shirts not labeled as slim fit. The only parts I like are the length, and arms."
2.0,Item was not a good quality cotton and/or print. Tshirts are a hard buy through shipping. It's rare that I get a good quality shirt or print. China's sizes are much smaller too.
2.0,"Very small, it's more of a child's play wallet. My Drivers license wouldn't even fit into the slot for it"
2.0,"i ordered a L because everyone says order up but i think the zippers made the sweater look hippy, only because i ordered the wrong size. I'm a M and i think i should have ordered a medium. Returned because the collar of the sweater is lacking and made the whole thing look drab."
2.0,"It was made out of cheap material, sort of like a halloween costume. The belt was very short. It fit and I will be able to wear it, just not as flattering as I had hoped because of the material it is made of.  It also had a strange perfume smell. Like they tried to freshen up the outfit before it was shipped, or it had been worn before. It smelled terrible. Overall I wasn’t happy with the product."
2.0,"The product is nice, looks like what is pictured. Unfortunately,  mine came without the adhesive and I attempted to glue the items In and it failed completely and I cant use it. Please verify that you have all pieces needed to make this work. I'm pretty sure it would have been perfect if the adhesive was included as it should have been."
2.0,"I like the fit.  For me, it fits perfect.  However, there are several issues.<br />1) The loops for the tie are right under the armpits. If using the loops, the belt ties just under my nipples.  The loops need to be at waist level.<br />2) There is nothing luxurious about 'Luxurious Turkish Cotton'.  It is not plush.  It made me feel as though I were wearing drapes.<br />3) It does not keep me warm. I live in a cooler climate and when wearing the robe I actually get a chill.<br /><br />I do like the Waffle Diamond Pattern."
2.0,The cross is nice but the rope broke the first day.
2.0,"I like the color, the material, and the style. I normally wear a large to achieve the loose look and I ordered xxl just to be sure since orders in the past have run small for me. It was skin tight. Will need to return."
2.0,"Not quite what I ordered.. The white is not really white, it’s actually grey."
2.0,Very very thin afraid to put a pendant on it.
2.0,Should say more about how really small these are.
2.0,Eh it’s ok. Does not dry that quickly. Adjuster does not really stay that tight . Biggest issue is that the connector to the Apple Watch itself does not have the best fit .
2.0,I wish the description at the time had been more clear about the metallic threads in this. Not really the cozy look I thought I was getting.
2.0,Slot for glasses arm too small/
2.0,Given to my wife as a gift. They fit length wise but are very narrow. If you have a wide foot at all then pass this by.
2.0,"Looks really pretty out of the bag but once it’s on it’s 1. See through and 2. I’m not sure how the slip on the inside is supposed to cover up anyone’s private parts as it’s SO SO SO SHORT, way shorter than the dress itself. Yikes."
2.0,Very cute but rhinestone fell out after wearing first couple of hours.
2.0,Looks like the picture and the quality is good. The downside for me was the width and length. More so the width... They're way too wide. I have what I'd call a regular / medium size width feet.  I couldn't take two steps without my feet sliding out the front.
2.0,"This dress has an odd fit, it very form fitting in the torso but the bust is huge - I wear a D cup and could not fill the bust.  I purchased it for a 20's party but I am returning and will try another dress."
2.0,"They are cute, but that is the only thing they have in their favor. Paper-thin, awful smell, and on the smaller side."
2.0,"I ordered this with the expectation that it would be curve hugging, like a body con dress. It did not fit like that. My measurements are 37-27-39. I ordered a small. While it hugged my bust and butt/hips appropriately, it was more loose and almost baggy around the waist than I had anticipated. Luckily, I was able to return it."
2.0,The top and bottom are as pictured but the skirt does not cover all the way around. I bought a size S and it barely even covers 50% and the rest is just a bow... does not offer complete coverage and looks a little silly.
2.0,It’s so cheap. You can literally see the glue all over it
2.0,"They’re as pictured but the sizing is off. I’m always a medium in workout bottoms — 5’7”, 125 pounds, athletic build. Tried the medium shorts on and I had to roll them because the waistband it too loose, I even tied the drawstring as tight as I could and they were still loose, but that’s not a huge issue. The spandex compression shorts are pretty loose on my thighs, that’s the worst part, they’re uncomfortably loose. I was really excited for these to arrive, haven’t even tried running in them because I know I’ll be pulling at the compression shorts the whole time, probably going to give them to a friend because I don’t see them working out for me.<br />Sizing chart is incorrect.....too big."
2.0,The film comes off the plastic
2.0,Robe did not come with the waste belt as shown in photo. Returning for a replacement. Otherwise good product.
2.0,"The quality is not that great, I think the most I would pay for this bag would be about $12. It is not an exaggeration when I say it is TINY! Definitely not for any kids older than 4."
2.0,"These are very cute, nice CZ stone but they are significantly smaller than the picture shows they are probably only a half an inch long but still really cute."
2.0,Incredibly thin material which makes the shirt very sheer. I ordered the black with dragon and it looks so faded due to the stretching of the very thin material. It’s so sheer and cheap looking. It is very comfy and maybe a different pattern wouldn’t look so cheap. I will most likely be returning it.
2.0,"Given the price I didn’t expect it to be great, but it was cute to wear a few times.<br />The gold turned after a few wears."
2.0,"Good fit, decent fabric, poor construction. The seams bunch, especially at the hips."
2.0,Got it for a Kimber raptor and it way too  soft for my pistol. For other things it maybe a good belt.
2.0,"Sleeves are much shorter then picture, so maybe measure before selecting size, also print is not what's shown which was the most disappointing"
2.0,"Even a large was too tight, especially in the sleeve.  Lovely fabric, flowy and all, but just not cut correctly."
2.0,These are made out of some kind of flimsy material with barely any sole. They don’t stay on well; it’s kind of like having flip-flops on. Not wearable outside and not especially comfortable indoors either.
2.0,Shirt was nice thick material but was not as shown. It was more of a fitted stretchy material. Very disappointed as I was looking for a more loosely fitted but cute shirt.
2.0,I'm an XL.  I read that it was running small so I got the XXL and it fits really well.  I like that it's roomie and tunic fit.  Feels well made. It didn’t make it through the wash. Suggest hand wash and hang dry.
2.0,"I have gotten a couple sets of these. They don't last too long, but great fit and don't leave lines. After a couple of months they shred though. However, I just got the ""J pack"" and it's much smaller than the others and the material is a lot stiffer. Constantly kept rolling down, too, when the other packs don't. Not sure why this one is bad quality, just avoid the J pack."
2.0,It broke 3 days after having it
2.0,"This top had a terrible sleeveless cut. It was very unflatering and not worth the money. The top was a very similiar cut to what my conservative grandma in her 80s would wear (minus the cutout in the front). For size reference- I bought the Large and it was too big, I am DD, 160lbs."
2.0,It's a crazy item
2.0,Super flimsy frame and almost transparent lenses. Just go with Gunnar brand glasses.
2.0,Does not look like picture. Its white and looks cheap. Definitely not the rustic look like yippy see in the picture
2.0,Top is cute with ties .. bottoms are very high wasted more than normal .. will be keeping for top but not worth price
2.0,"I love the fit and style of this dress. However, I ordered it in white for my beach vow renewal. It was delivered clearly pre-worn. It was dirty and smelled (not the usual packaging smell, but food smell). The bottom of the dress looked as though it had been dragged through the dirt and there appeared to be food spots on it elsewhere. Just gross. I will try again to reorder, hoping to not have the same outcome. I would have given 5 stars had it been received in new condition."
2.0,Underwear runs on the smaller side and holes started popping up after 2 washes. Tried contacting the seller but to no avail. Don't recommend this underwear.
2.0,"This poncho is beautiful, soft but sheds too much Fluffs!"
2.0,Wouldn't wear to the gym
2.0,"The package showed up and the metal part didn't have any plastic sealing on it so it looked pretty scratched. I'm surprised the purse wasn't sealed or wrapped in any sort of packaging. The purse is super cute but also very small and gives off a strong plastic odor. The metal clasp works to keep the purse shut, but it still feels like stuff could leak out the top if it was tumped over."
2.0,Elastic band around waist too snug to be comfortable. The material was soft though.
2.0,"Great concept.<br /><br />Pros: Love the style, the fabric soft, stretchy, breathable.<br />Cons: Various Multi-color chains were hanging upon arrival and careful removal from packaging (I read the reviews before purchasing).  A US XL is usually big for me, and took the advice of the reviewers and ordered 2 sizes up.  Was still too small.<br /><br />I requested a refund since I truly believe a XXL will still run small. Beware if you have modest curves."
2.0,"This item should be listed as a shirt, not a dress. It would ok with leggings, but that’s not the look I was going for. Way too short."
2.0,I ordered the shirt for my mom for Christmas. It doesn’t fit right at all. And the return window has long passed . Now I’m stuck with a shirt that doesn’t fit mom or me or anyone else I know. For the price you’d think they could get the size correct. My mom was disappointed Christmas morning and so am I.
2.0,Didn't really latch onto my GearFit very well so I can't use it.
2.0,A lot thinner than expected and roll down quote a bit.
2.0,"i was expecting a much smaller leaf on a shorter chain.  the chain is probably 20"" (?) and the leaf is quite large. i was hoping for something more 'dainty' looking"
2.0,Absolutely not sized properly.  Order one size larger just to be safe.  It looks good and feels good though.
2.0,Cute but one of the loops were un-sawed I pay extra because I needed right away and now I can't wear it :(
2.0,"I like the color but It’s not as soft as I would expect and there’s no label on the scarf about the scarf - fabrics details,  washing method etc."
2.0,"I have larger breast and this dont work well for me at all. They push the together but make them look squished, lopsided, and flat from a side few. Also didnt stick well after first use."
2.0,"I finally wore the shoes and I am sorry to say that they are very uncomfortable. They are heavy and they slip up and down on my feet. They look good but when it comes to walking, it's a no  no. My only regret is that I bought 2 pair  in different colors. If you're looking for looks and not comfort, this is the shoe for you."
2.0,Chep feel plus turns color
2.0,i'm a size 2 petite so this was drowning me.
2.0,Shirt was soft however the blue sections of the shirt washed away in the first wash. The blue sections are now see through white.  Very disappointing quality.
2.0,this is a jacket and not a pullover and really kind of sad.
2.0,"My daughter has owned these for 3 months now. They were really cool and she got lots of compliments on them.  As directed, she didn't wear them thru puddles or run in them.  She charged them last week and only one would light up.  After she unplugged them, the one that wouldn't light up while charging would only light up in three of the colors.  The other shoe had all the colors and settings but wouldn't turn off. Then they started blinking only and wouldn't turn off.  They got so hot that she called me concerned.  She put them in the fireplace in case they started on fire because they were so hot!  After blinking for a full 24hrs and not turning off, they battery finally died. This is now a pair of shoes for the garbage!  Not worth the money for 3 months of use."
2.0,"does not meet expectation, the material is not as expected. Zippers are too big for the cloth that was use, bidding can be better."
2.0,Nones lo q yo esperaba la textura no es algodón. Para el clima de mi país es. Calurosa
2.0,It runs on the small side for an XL.
2.0,Plan to return these.
2.0,"Bought these May 23, but didn't start wearing them much until later in June.  By July 19, the flower had fallen off one sandal and the main strap had torn off one of them (we hot-glued it back on).  I know these are inexpensive & that things definitely aren't made like they used to be, but honestly, I would have hoped for more than 1 month on these!"
2.0,Way smaller than anticipated.
2.0,probably not real .. they don't feel like the quality of my other coach glasses but they are ok and a good back up pair of glasses. Don't expect store coach heaviness and quality though.
2.0,Very cheap quality. Ordered up a size like some reviews said and ended up too big.
2.0,"Husband wears this watch 24 hours a day, he is very active.  Watch does not keep accurate time."
2.0,"I believe this is child size, or I have a huge head lol there was about 1.5 inches from the top of my ear to the bottom of the hat. If not for the small size it would have been perfect, its a cute hat."
2.0,"The vest itself is comfortable and heats nicely however, the zipper is cheap and fell apart after just a few weeks.  The zipper quality is extremely low."
2.0,I was disappointed in the quality of the this bag.  Especially considering how much it cost.  I would not purchase this bag again; it is not worth the money they are charging for it.
2.0,"Sized way small, & stretch to being see threw very easily."
2.0,"its not a real bandana, its only one sided and is feminine looking to me. Picture didnt represent the product very well in my opinion"
2.0,Graphics beautiful but the shirt was super small and not stiff it was new but it looked worn
2.0,I felt these were too big and bulky. Not really what I expected.
2.0,Shipped quickly and I like the colors. I can't give a higher star since they are cheaply made.  One had already broken. I'm sure the other's aren't to far behind.
2.0,Rubber tips fall off
2.0,"bottom fit fine but top was so short and tight, not true to size at all"
2.0,Cheaply made and very unflattering.
2.0,"I'm normally a large and I ordered a Large, did not fit me what so ever. It's as if it was a small.... Other that, it was pretty but didn't fit."
2.0,I bought this slipper for my daughter June 22 and it’s already torn. The material isn’t durable. Disappointed.
2.0,"I received the incorrect size.<br />I expected small and instead I received xxl.<br />However I see where small might have been a problem since the<br />hip fit was a little loose but more or less ok.<br />Also, instead of 3/4 sleeves, I got one with long sleeves."
2.0,"These would be cute if they're weren't so small in the butt area! Couldn't even pull them all the way up in the back, but they fit in the front and legs. Ridiculous. For reference, I wear a size 18 US."
2.0,"I was pretty disappointed in this dress. Overall it was just a really weird fit, some places were too big, some were too small, making it impossible to order in a different size for optimum fit. Had to return."
2.0,I returned it as the bracelet was too small and couldn’t put it on
2.0,SO small! Im a 38D. It was ridiculously tight front & back. Good quality though.
2.0,One of the four bracelets had the wording “ default happens” instead of the correct wording Device Implant/ No MRI. I purchased these for patients who cannot have an MRI due to implanted devices such as pacemakers.
2.0,It's okay but it's a NECKLACE  not a  BRACELET.  Dissapointed in that.
2.0,"I normally wear a medium top, but I ordered a large in this in hopes that it would fit like the picture. In order to get it to look like the picture, I should have ordered two sizes bigger. The sleeves were a little short. The material was itchy. It was more of a hassle to return it online then it was for me to sell locally."
2.0,I have size 9 shoes and the straps are not long enough to wrap all the way around. Cant get hook in the 1st hole 🙄🙄
2.0,Large breasted women will not be able to wear this dress.
2.0,The bottom of the leg is somewhat loose .
2.0,Picture shows bigger lens; actual product is slim and narrow.
2.0,The black socks don't look like the picture. instead they are feminine type crew socks with grey and white stripes at the top. They're way too expensive to be made in Asia.
2.0,Did not really like the stitching but fits well
2.0,"Cheap, thin, and very short. I'm 5'8 and it barely covered half my bum."
2.0,"Very thin and if you have cellulite you will see it. Also the dress looks mauve, but it’s actually plum."
2.0,Not happy with it fitting my big head.
2.0,"The leather smells funny, like an old goat!! and the lashings fell off the end.  Its cheap so what do I expect. It did arrived quickly good work amazon!!!"
2.0,i wear a large and this was very small
2.0,Poor Setting up instructions! Unless I'm doing it wrong but I have tried to follow the instructions and nothing is working. I'm returning it
2.0,I got a size XL because that's what size I normally wear for sports bras. The bra isn't true to size the XL fits more like a medium. The fabric is soft and the breast pads have a push-up bra kind of padding.
2.0,Very thin. Looks as if it has already been washed several times. Will definitely not use as present
2.0,Loved the front view but very revealing from the side (side boob) & back (too cheeky for me). Had to return
2.0,Extremely difficult to get on due to extra small fit.
2.0,Sound quality is very poor and volume does not go high enough for walking around in any sort of higher traffic areas.
2.0,Love the print but it doesn't fit at all like the picture. It fits like a snug short blazer. Length hits about top of jeans.
2.0,"In a way I hate to leave this review because this dress is beautiful however, I do want women to know if you typically wear a size 2XL this 2X will not fit you. It is more of a large perhaps. It is a fantastically lovely dress and if I could fit it. I would wear it often.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. I do not under any circumstances give false reviews for items I received at a discount because I want people to understand and know if the product is really going to work for them. Please keep in mind, I do not give false reviews and I always provide an honest reaction to the product. Please keep that in mind when you are when you are reading my review. If you find my review helpful please click on the link below."
2.0,They look great but not as clear as my Bolle sunglasses.
2.0,"Cute, but some fell apart very fast, had some unhappy students quickly"
2.0,very thin fabric - not great quality
2.0,"I wear a 32 inch waist. I have to loop this belt literally halfway around me in order for it to fit, making it a pain to put on. It doesn’t hold up my pants any better than any other belt I’ve tried. And I know this is subjective, but it’s really ugly once you get it on. Hard pass."
2.0,I received the necklace and the color is non-existent and the chain is poor quality.  I was very disappointed because it was to be a gift.  If the color had matched the picture she would have loved it.  This looks like window glass even when set against something white. I had also ordered earrings and will return those as well.
2.0,Way to small. The size is off I think. I ordered 29 like always but this brand was extra small.
2.0,Lo que dise contra las arrugas es lo que más TIENE no me gusta este producto
2.0,Print was cute. Didn't quite lay on me the way I thought it was going to / the way it looks online but it was cute I got lots of compliments. The romper material was so thin and was already fraying. I don't think it would have lasted through the wash.
2.0,The watch itself looks nice. Though the wrist started to worn out after the first day wearing it... Now after a Week its by definition worn out. I wonder how its going to look in a month from now...
2.0,I ignored the reviews about the buttons when I bought this and I shouldn’t have.<br /><br />The very middle button on this was missing the two tension wires inside of the button to actually make it snap closed.<br /><br />This jacket is also hideous in person. It looks WAY better in the photos than in real-life. It’s basically getting catfished but by a jacket.
2.0,It is very very sheer. The pads fit awkwardly in the top & because it is sheer it is obvious. It would be great if the lining was better and it wasn't so sheer. So wanted to like it.
2.0,Typical Diluth sleeves are full and come down to the crook of the elbow.  This version comes up short.
2.0,"I love the feel of it, the color is great, but It fit really big, and of course the buttons just fell off after a few days."
2.0,"So floppy it was in my eyes.  Not a good choice at all unless the intent is to cover your face.  It certainly didn't hold out in a circle as shown, it was drooping all over the place."
2.0,"I typically wear size M in Nike shorts, so I ordered size M (too small), then size L (still too small). The size L bunched up the pockets and pulled on my legs as I walked, so I returned them and upgraded to Nike Flex Stride shorts (size L) at the same price."
2.0,"I fell in love with this because I love all things cat! It just arrived today and I'm sad it's not quite the big, comfy sweatshirt I was looking for! I am normally an 18 and wear a 1x/2x in us plus sizes. I ordered this in a 3x cause I wanted it to be BIG and comfy! Well, it barely fits. It's NOT a 3x!!!!<br />Be careful when buying!!<br />It is adorable and soft so if you do buy it there's that to look forward to!"
2.0,"Yep.  You will need something under it.  Even if you don't wear a bra, you can definitely see nipples.  And if you wear underwear you can see that....and if you don't....well you can see that too!  Maybe that's your game, no judging if it is, but for the rest of us, you will need a full slip or half slip and spaghetti strap undershirt, or something. So add the extra layer of clothing and its not a cute summer dress anymore."
2.0,"I ordered a size 1 in the boots. When the boots arrived, they were size 13/1.  Not the same size as 1.  The information on size was not given correctly."
2.0,Size small was huge. I'm waiting for either a refund or an extra small. The swimsuit is really cute and decently made.
2.0,"They are advertised as white, but they are actually an off white/cream color."
2.0,"Overall, this is a good bag.  I would probably give it a 4 star rating except for the fact that the hook strap came out of its stitching the second time I used the bag.  I wasn't even hanging the bag at the time.  Just went to pull the strap out to hang it up and it just came free with virtually no pressure.  The bag wasn't even close to being full the first time I used it, so there really is no reason for it to come loose.  The only other minor issue is that sometimes the zippers on the side pockets get stuck sometimes and don't want to open.<br /><br />There is plenty of room in here for a razor, shaving cream, deodorant, toothpaste, toothbrush, and whatever odds and ends you might want to throw in.  I have everything I need in this bag and have room for more without stretching the limits of its capacity.  Just wish the hook was useable."
2.0,"The hourglass looking one, portrays the message ""looks like their time was up"". LET ME GET ENGRAVED ""BYEEEEE!"". The tree relays the message of ""that branch of the tree broke off and died."" The angel's wings look unrealistic; actually the whole angel is all out of wack. Unfortunately, the heart-shaped pendant lookes like the upper portion or the buttocks of a female. Kind of sexy, but not sure if it's appropriate."
2.0,I ordered orange. It is more red than orange. I returned it.
2.0,"Boots were very cute but my heel kept slipping out the back when I would walk.  Unfortunately, I had to return them."
2.0,Sorry but5 you asked me for this review. This frame made this old man look on the feminine side so that is the reason for the rating. My wife did not like how I looked in the readers so I returned them. Now I know what fashion means and looking at the pictures is sometimes not the whole story.
2.0,I lost it the 4th day because of some malfunction of the locking system. I recommend users to twist it strongly so that the lock stays put. Quality of metal work is not very good. Washhs out quickly
2.0,"I love the look, but not the fit!!!"
2.0,"the top fits nicely, but the bottom is very oddly shaped. the material is not soft and feels cheap"
2.0,"Cute robe, bad planning. I could tell that the red would bleed in the wash so I washed it separately. Good thing I did it bleed into the white arms and bunny ears. Now they are pink."
2.0,Not long enough shorts should have been 10 to 11 inches more looser and deeper in the crouch  if they were I will purchase more so will a lot of my friends we Plays lots of sports .......
2.0,"I am 5'10&#34;, I normally wear a size 6 dress, but ordered the next size up just to be safe.  You can imagine how upset I was when I put the costume on for the first time and the bottom of my butt was showing.  I looked at the package again to check the size, and to my surprise, the size chart had a height section of 5'7-5'9.  Had the website stated that, I wouldn't have wasted my money."
2.0,"These sunglasses arrived well packaged. If you like big and heavy sunglasses, this is the pair for you. I found them to be very uncomfortable, and my family didn't like them on me. The solid black frame with the gold ear pieces were just plain, not pretty."
2.0,sweatshirt is a very nice fabric. The reason I gave it two stars is the tree was brown instead of green making it look like a dead tree. If I had time I would return it. Very disappointed
2.0,"I needed some winter slippers that I could easily slip my feet into while traveling. The slippers are of  quality  and fluffy, but even though I ordered one size larger than I normally wear, they were small. I would not order these again. They should have said to order a size or size an half larger. Nothing was said that they might ran small."
2.0,"They are very flimsy and they don't stay on my face, they always slide down do I don't use them anymore. It is cheaply made and it makes sense because of the price. I wouldn't bother buying this product and buy a different pair that will actually work."
2.0,"I liked the design, but fit was very small."
2.0,I like how I can wear dresses with cleavage showing BUT I was only able to use it 3x when the sticky gel that makes it attach to skin start coming off. Also the strap like on the sides changes position as you move which makes the pads move around as well. I wish it didn't have the side straps
2.0,"The material was very thin and after an apparent small knick,  the fabric could easily be torn in either direction.  Do not go commando in these."
2.0,This product should be lower priced. Otherwise fun for the kids.
2.0,"socks are rather thin. also, the blue spots seen are actually tiny bumps on the inside of socks and will bother you if you have sensitive feet.ok for summer, but toes will get cold in winter."
2.0,The pants were definitely not the material I was expecting; my daughter wears the top as it’s cute and comfy but we have tossed the pants
2.0,"Not only was this costum a lot bigger than expected. It is also very cheap looking. The hat is smushed and has no shape, and there are little threads coming off of it everywhere."
2.0,These outfits n 0-3 months fit like a 6-9 months
2.0,Puesto se doblan de las puntas
2.0,"I looked like a fat farmer in this,  not the sexy look the model has going."
2.0,"The fabric is slick and shiny and nasty like nylon or another synthetic. Something with as much cotton as advertised should not feel like this.<br /><br />The fit is OK, but there's a it too much extra fabric in the crotch area as though not to fit a woman. I didn't like the waistband which is very hard and bulky and unstretchy, so even though the pants fit, the waistband seemed too tight.<br /><br />I sent these back"
2.0,Looks weird. I don't understand the why the visor folds. It makes no sense and looks bad.
2.0,I like the ties but I've had these for about 3 weeks and the strip that is in the back of the black tie has already come off. I cycled thru all the colors so I have eb ever used it much.
2.0,Not a fan. I've used several of these vinyl sayings and this was by far the most difficult to align. I put a lot of work into trying to put it even and am still not satisfied.
2.0,These are NOT demons. They are inspired from Dean's protection amulet that is rumoured to burn hot in the presence of God.
2.0,These are not the docs of old. The leather feels fake and is extremely stiff. The soles slide all over any remotely slick surface. Not happy at with this purchase.
2.0,"A beautiful set.... they shipped with the necklace rolled into a ball with the rest of the pieces in a small cloth bag.  The necklace was broken in two places.  Not useable, very sad"
2.0,Gift.  Should either be bent or a knob on the end of it like in picture.
2.0,"This is an astonishingly poor-quality product.  The fabric is cheap, coarsely-woven cotton, reminds me of the garage shopcloths I buy for a few bucks a stack.  They're not suitable even for casual wear, and not worth even half the price they're charging.  Returned immediately."
2.0,Dress is great for a couple of wears. The fabric then starts peeling after only 2 washes (gentle cycle). Not wearable. Such a shame!
2.0,Way smaller than expected. Short in size.
2.0,"When the description said &#34;plush,&#34; I understood this to mean that the wings were either flocked or made of a fuzzy fabric... Not so! They seem to be rather thick, heavy, and stuffed with some cushioning substance... Not at all the ephemeral transparent or translucent wings one associates with butterflies...! In addition, the wingspan (where the end handles are to hold on to) is way too long for a three year old boy. When he hits four, he'll likely no longer wish to flit around as a butterfly!<br />It was a Birthday gift, and was only returned to me a week or so ago... way past the allowable return window! So, what now? Maybe I can turn it into a butterfly wings pillow by opening up the wings and adding some substantial stuffing to them. Sounds like a good summer project."
2.0,"Super cheap right at a super cheap price.  I was optimistic but it didn't work out, oh well.  Solid construction and fits well but but turned my finger a blue/green kinda color after wearing it for only a few hours."
2.0,"Much tinier than I had expected. These won't last long, very thin material. Bought them for my young nieces."
2.0,"Too large in the waist for me, and much shorter than in the photo - actually comes up halfway between knee and waist, not down to knees.  (It is about the length of the black under-skirt shown in the photo)  I ordered the &#34;Large&#34; and it is more a size 14-16, not 12-14.  The quality is pretty good though, for the price."
2.0,Way to big no compression at all. The sizing chart is wrong.
2.0,"Mostly needed compression in my feet, but there is ZERO compression in the foot area but very tight as soon as it hits the upper ankle/calves..<br />very breathable & cool. Didn’t help circulation at all."
2.0,"While it does look pretty for a few days, I think this ring contains nickel, which turns your skin green, the ring changed into a coppery colour within a few days"
2.0,Was super pretty unfortunately as I went to put the bigger one in the Pearl fell right off as I was pushing it into my ear😭😭
2.0,Too short and too small to size guide.
2.0,The top arrived damaged.  It was also smaller than advertised.
2.0,I'm not impressed. This is polyester and is not the same as the picture. In the picture it looks like her knee is out the dress but that's not how the dress is made. There are no high side splits. This is a definite return. It's not horrible but just not what I wanted.
2.0,"This set starts falling apart after first was, hems have started running and they are not holding up after a few wears/washes."
2.0,"Dress design is nice and it fits well.<br />Material is terrible.  Not soft, rough and hard to iron. Not good to touch"
2.0,Zipper is on wrong side for US and is super cheap and stops working almost after first use.<br />Do not buy!!
2.0,Ran small I'm 5'5 139 and I ordered a large. Also the material is like a hot cheap jersey with very little stretch
2.0,"Cheap cheap cheap. It's super thin cheap material, no lining, loose fitting because it's so cheap it doesn't have much of a shape. Do not waste your time on this."
2.0,Thin fabric with zero compression. Might have other good qualities but I was looking for compression and there isn’t any.
2.0,The fabric was thick and chunky rather than slinky or flowy.  Definitely have to return as the material doesn't even look like the photo. Maxi dresses are often flattering for curvy girls... this one was not and clung around the mid-section. It's also too long.
2.0,The interior material is kind of gross and itchy
2.0,it does not seem like the fabric like the picture
2.0,"The dress could have been ideal for my purpose, however, the waistline was in between empire and natural. I did not like the look or feel of the waist. I returned the dress."
2.0,I ordered an XL for a friend and its hardly a medium… disappointed..
2.0,these were sheer and the product description didn't indicate that. ended up donating to goodwill as i had no use for them and the hassle of returning and paying shipping wasn't worth my time.
2.0,"If youre a spiritualist, this had bad energy. The company I worked for laid off and closed all 9 of us in the import department a week after got this necklace. It felt weird when I opened it. I would not recommend, I think it's stolen stone and it's karma will bite you."
2.0,The burgundy color sweater isn't this color.
2.0,Sides have lots of extra material. It’s an odd cut. There is too much extra material in the side near the chest area. Doesn’t fit well.
2.0,"These gloves are very cute, they won’t don’t my infant but I’ll keep them and he can grow into them. I hope. They are pretty big"
2.0,"I recieved the phone case for my Incredible 2, promptly, (within the 2 days I selected for shipping). The phone case fits perfectly and easily snaps together. The case feels like rubber covered in a harder plastic. I don't know how much protection it will give the phone if it is dropped, but it will definately protect from scratchs, dents, etc. For the price, it's worth it. It's no ""otterbox"", but it didn't cost me more than five dollars either. (The free shipping was nice too)!<br />(This was my original review from Jan. 2012)<br /><br />Now April 2012, I want to retract my review. I have had this case for less than four months, and it is now useless. You would expect normal wear and tear on case, but it has fallen apart so much, I am back on Amazon looking for a new case. I guess you get what you pay for. the color has scratched off, and looks super dirty and dingy. I have tried to clean it, but it doesn't do anything. If you have to take the case off more than once, (to take out battery), expect to not be able to use it again. The top part of the case won't stay on/connected to the bottom. I wish I would've spent more on a better quality case in the first place."
2.0,cheap material. returned
2.0,"Update: after a month of using this bag the inside lining is coming apart and is a mess. Very disappointed. Love this bag, using it as a gym bag for now, came with a little shoe bag that keeps my clothes from smelling or getting dirt on it."
2.0,"So first of all the size chart of this jacket is WAY OFF! I'm 5'11"" and 160lb, with a 39"" measured chest. I usually wear a 38R jacket size (slim fit). Based on the size chart, I'm squarely a Medium and ordered that size accordingly. When it arrived, it was GIGANTIC. I'd say at least a size 42. The shoulder pads were way beyond my shoulders and the chest was huge on me. I returned the medium and ordered a small (which was it's own hassle that I won't belabor). The small fit me very well in the shoulders and chest. In short, size down one full size from what you would otherwise order.<br /><br />Having gotten the correct size, I like the jacket. The construction feels pretty good, and I like the feel of the fabric.  Don't expect to be awed at this price point, but it's a decent piece. That being said, the item description is not very accurate. It says 50/50 wool/polyester for the fabric content, but the garment tag says it is only 30% wool, so that was disappointing. In addition, the description says this is a ""slim fit"", which I would say is an exaggeration. Even once I got the right size in the chest and shoulders, the waist is definitely looser on me than other slim fit jackets I have from reputable department store brands. It isn't super boxy, but it's not as slim as I'd expect for a ""slim fit""."
2.0,I loved this purse when I received it but it did rip on the side and a strap broke within six months..
2.0,Coool but not that great
2.0,Pretty fabric  but transparent aside from built in slip on lower half.  The dress we got was either poorly constructed or poorly designed as one shoulder was too big the other side too tight.  Size ran small overall<br /><br />Wanted to like this dress but it was not usable
2.0,These were very cute however the charms fell off the chain the day my best friend and I wore them.. I was able to hook it back on but then the whole clamp fell off so I was left with a chain… the same thing happened to my bestfriends except she found hers and i didnt definitely not worth the price
2.0,"Even though the picture shows they are black, mine are pink/nude with the black face.  Very disappointed."
2.0,"cheap quality, the silver has a yellowish tinge to it, and the studs are way to big in my opinion."
2.0,Didn’t like the look
2.0,Runs small order a size up. Print on shirt is fuzzy.
2.0,"Not very supportive, especially after wash"
2.0,"This Dale cardigan is beautiful and well made; however, it’s very heavy.  I own several Dale sweaters so I can attest to their quality.  This sweater feels different.  If I didn’t know better, I’d think it’s made from cotton yarn, rather than 100% wool.  It’s just too heavy to wear.  I returned it."
2.0,"Yeah, it was great and created cleavage for about twenty minutes, then came unstuck."
2.0,Is'nt rugged outback a payless brand?
2.0,"It's advertised as a thong, but it isn't a thong. It's just a pouch and no string. The quality of the material is nice, but I'm pretty sure my junk is gonna fall out if I move around too much. I like to wear thongs to the gym so unfortunately, I won't be wearing it often."
2.0,Looks like a smock
2.0,Very cheap but you get what you pay for
2.0,I was disappointed. They are all knock offs. for the price they are ok but really expected more
2.0,they large is a medium
2.0,Basically like leggings.
2.0,Loved this when I got it. Washed it a few times and half the right sleeve ripped off! Sad because I loved this shirt
2.0,"I followed their sizing chart and my shirt is HUGE on me!! I could've went 2 sizes down. Otherwise, I love the shirt and design."
2.0,Great material. Too small. I normally am between a medium and large. I ordered a large and I couldn't button it up at all and my arms looked like they were poured into the sleeves.
2.0,"Nice, but my sleeve is poorly sewn and is twisted. Can’t send it back. You get what you pay for"
2.0,I did not like this shirt at all. Just not my style and definitely runs small
2.0,I just received them I like them but they are missing stone I front. I just contacted seller.
2.0,Not my fave. Cup<br />Seems small
2.0,"Nice fabric and pretty colors, but the shirt runs small. I typically wear an XL, but ordered a 2XL for an oversized night time shirt. This shirt ,doesn’t fit loosely."
2.0,"I'm 5'4&#34;, 125 lbs. and a medium was way too big and baggy. I'm returning it."
2.0,the watch is very nice looking but when the ups delivered the watch it was pouring rain and the package was soaking wet when I got it out the box it worked good and looked good but 2 day in it would work the stop then work then stop then I noticed the silver notches that represent the numbers started to fall of and stick to the inside face of the watch. wanted to send back but you can only send back by ups and the are pretty far from where I live so it isn't worth sending back. so I guess I will just keep it.
2.0,"Not seamless, and too see thru for me"
2.0,This apron is very thin. Flimsy. I was hoping for a sturdier material given that this is for chores but this will not cover well and hanging items on it will put stress on already flimsy material.
2.0,It's a really cool idea my friends laughed a lot and it definitely provided smiles however it came with a tear and there his eye was hanging down. After a little tape it was not a big deal but still kind of pricey for that type of quality
2.0,The pockets are in the way—too big and is not sewn in properly. You have to iron them flat.  The waist is too bulky.  I would buy a pair without pockets.<br />The company is good and shipment was fast.
2.0,Great idea but it doesn't stay cool for very long (20 minutes tops)
2.0,"Nope! Totally awkward fit, doesn’t look like the picture. Way more brown than golden; too long, too big, too is completely different. Definitely return"
2.0,"Band is comfortable, but after just 6 weeks, the tab that holds the band closed came out, *and* the band came detached from the clip that holds it to the watch face."
2.0,"I had ordered these leg warmers in January, and by the time they arrived (March) it was a little too late to wear them.  Nonetheless I was excited, only to find out they shipped the wrong color! I had ordered medium-dark grey and recieved a dark chocolate brown/black.  The product was not too bad, although it was much too loose on my legs and would stretch easily.  All in all, if you are unwilling to take a gamble on this, I would not recommend for you to order this particular product."
2.0,Already tossed one pair out just too small.  My bad on that order.  Should have gone two more sizes so it was a waste of my money.
2.0,Corre muy pequeña la talla.
2.0,"So thin, the top blows back off your forehead, while riding.  Wore it once, threw it out."
2.0,I ordered this sweater and was hoping to be able to wear It this holiday.  Not a chance-- way small. Good thing my daughter is much smaller than me!
2.0,Love the design and great shipping however the sizing is very small.  I normally wear an xl in women's but when I put this xl on it was like medium size.  I am buying the men's version so I can enjoy it.
2.0,This shirt runs short. I would suggest size up if you don’t like a short shirt
2.0,It's cute and covers well but the zipper broke immediately.
2.0,"The top and bottom fit differently, but the design is pretty.  The top could have used better support and an adjustable design."
2.0,"My main issue is that this key cover is impossible to attach to a key ring, key chain, key fob, whatever.<br /><br />The little bead chain it comes with is cheap and doesn’t stay closed, so my key always fell off my key ring in my bag. And the actual key cover is too thick for me to put a regular key ring through the opening, so I stopped using this. Which was a disappointment because the tiger is so fun! It just didn’t really work for me."
2.0,I think the models were size 0. Nice gift for the lean lady.
2.0,"This is a really great dress, but the cut was so bizarre! I received a Small...I'm 5'4"" and 117 lbs. and wear a C bra. The dress fit great from the waist down, but was WAY too big up top. The front chest part, under the arms and the back...way too much fabric for the size of the dress.<br /><br />As soon as I took it out of the bag I knew it wasn't going to fit. It's a very large size Small. I though about taking it to my tailor and having her fix it for me, but I don't love the dress enough to pay for that, so off to Goodwill it goes. I imagine this would fit a smaller VERY large chested woman quite well."
2.0,"I opened this & immediately returned it without trying it on - it seemed to be good quality, thick material but I ordered the coffee color & the sweater I received was orange & tan stripes! It was not what I expected & I did not like the color in person at all. Seemed like it would be a comfy chunky sweater but it's not right for me!"
2.0,Beautiful but small and uncomfortable fit! The sizing is incorrect.
2.0,"Did not fit properly. Slightly too large. Lenses bow out, even after heating and cooling frames with lenses."
2.0,Socks were much thinner than expected.
2.0,Beads fell off after 2 days
2.0,I went by their size chart and actually ordered a size up and it was still too small
2.0,had to return it color is kind of yellowish..not elegant at all
2.0,Turned black very soon.
2.0,It's a very cool buckle the only issue I have is the belt itself the material is unforgiving if it rubs against the skin but other than that for the price it's a good belt
2.0,"These masks are advertised for kids, but wouldn’t stay in my 4 year old.<br />Also, the fabric seems like nylon and my oldest complained that it got really sweaty inside his mask."
2.0,Wasn't exactly what I hoped for. The picture is so light it's hard to see and it doesn't take up the entire dog tag like the one shown in the product picture. Also I thought the writing would be black like the picture but it's not and it's not very readable
2.0,Small and thinner than I thought it would be
2.0,"They look close to them, but aren't identical to Walter White's sunglasses, so be warned!"
2.0,"The style is what 1st caught my eyes online. I like classy clothing. The quality is cheap, but I expected it to be cheap due to the low price. It is as pictured & arrived very quickly via prime. I washed it & hung dried it 1st & then I wore it 2 days after receiving it. It held up in the wash & looked good with my black & white skirt. It's an easy top to just throw on & wear in the middle of the work week."
2.0,I am disappointed with the size. Everything I buy from Amazon is always same size and everything does fit but this one is too big. Not happy.
2.0,"I love the look and feel of these but both pairs broke within less than 3 weeks of wear, really wish they were more durable, I was not hard on them the arms just are very fragile (cheap)"
2.0,"Not for short, curvy women."
2.0,"I sent these back as they were too short in the ""rise"" (didn't come up far enough on the behind), as well as being too short in the legs.  They ""rode up"" from the ankles.  I am plus-sized, but these fit everywhere like they should and slipped on easily. Nice fabric thickness too, so I was disappointed to have to send them back.  Would love to find some GREAT leggings with pockets."
2.0,Disappointed. Thought it was an Alex and Anni
2.0,Photos shown do NOT accurately reflect the colors and patterning of the scarf. Also the fabric is extremely thin. going to be returning
2.0,"Item arrived on time, I supposed to receive 2 earrings , but there was only one in the package.<br />The earring I did receive was a lot small than what was advertised."
2.0,The nose bridge was too tight...I think it would have given me a headache after 1/2 hour of swimming.
2.0,"They were enlarged in the picture to show detail?  Or so you could SEE them?  They are cute but tiny.  May be good for your second up piercing, with a larger earring set as first and primary."
2.0,"Hmmm. Not for me. Although the style is lovely, the fit is not, nor is the fabric."
2.0,I may need to think of stitching it but still thinking if i should keep or not 😞
2.0,This skirt did not look anything like the one on the picture. It had a thick almost balloon type deal around the waste that's puffy and sticks out. Stitching is bunched up all around the waist and the slip underneath was ripped. It is not one size fits all.
2.0,Material was thin enough to see thru without a slip.  Largest size was several sizes too small.
2.0,Real cute but strap is cheep looking
2.0,These coins are very small so I returned it wasn't that cool
2.0,"i'm 5'6, 128 lbs 34/25/ 36. Size 6 fits my body really well and looks really nice! However, the neck is hella tight that it literally was choking me. My face turned red just trying it on. What a bummer! Returning it."
2.0,"The shirt is fine unless you are doing yoga or pilates... it opens up very easily, completely exposing you with any movement."
2.0,Well I love this bag however I must say I am extremely disappointed that there is a red stain of some sort in the inside. For as much as I paid for this bag it really is unacceptable
2.0,After washing the socks I've noticed the rubber non skid design on the bottom is coming off. This has happened while I was on my mat doing yoga. Do you think it could be because the mat is rubberized and it's rubber on rubber? An answer would be appreciated. Thank you.
2.0,Not what I expected .. lenses were smaller than I thought and not comfortable to wear.
2.0,"The fabric is very firm which is good in some respects , buyers should go at least one size up."
2.0,I had to send these back these socks was so tight they cut off my circulation so I am a female woman and I purchased men socks I found myself tugging and trying to stretch to be comfortable I didn’t like the fit so I sent back terrible fit
2.0,The colored are very dull compared to the pictures online
2.0,These slippers are very cute but NOT worth the money. Within the first month they started to fall apart and the seems started ripping. Overall do not recommend. The insides weren’t even fluffy which what I mostly wanted. Not worth the hype.
2.0,"I ordered the XL and this fit like it was a small so I returned it. Too bad because I loved the stripping and the button down front, the style was really nice but the fit was not."
2.0,I loved how this looked in picture but in person it looked different not as cute. I also think it was a little big but it was a while ago.
2.0,"Beautiful, but fit smaller than expected. Very disappointing."
2.0,They are supposed to be clip on earrings... they are just bendable. No grip! I am scared to wear them due to I know they will fall off. I will lose them. I didn't return due to the effort. Do not buy!
2.0,"I love a lot about this jacket. I work in an ice rink and it keeps me warm, the zipper pocket is great and it’s a really relaxed fit with the more batwing sleeve style, but it sheds the stuffing. For 80 bucks it doesn’t seem like it should do this and I spend tons of time pulling off the little white filling pieces because it makes it look cheap. I am super disappointed because it is such a warm, cute jacket."
2.0,"I would love this if it wasnt so small. I ordered a triple x, and feel like it is a medium..."
2.0,Material is really thin and see-though.
2.0,Read all the reviews which indicated shirt ran small so I ordered a large.  It is huge.  Gave it away.
2.0,I'm going to ve returning these because the size is way way too small and the material is feels cheap.
2.0,"It's really too small in every day use. You can only fit a tiny device and the absolute bare essential accessories--a charger, cable, and a mouse. Anything else and you need a larger accessories organizer."
2.0,Poor quality. Zipper shows which detracts from the look. Maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if the zipper seam is the same color as the hat. It's not and it just look tacky.
2.0,I would've really liked this dress if it didn't ride up my legs with every step.  I feel like I would have had to contantly be pulling it down.
2.0,Too short and flimsy material.
2.0,"I ordered XL, felt like medium."
2.0,"I really liked the design of the watch. Unfortunately the dial broke off 24.5 months after I purchased it. It came with a two year warranty, and the new owners of the company would not give any flexibilty on the warranty. Took it to a repair shop and the estimated cost was $400.<br /><br />I know these things can happen, I just wish the company stood behind their product."
2.0,"While technically a mouse pad, I believe the image in the preview is the same image the manufacturer sent to the printer—meaning that this product is incredibly blurry and pixelated."
2.0,SAVE YOUR MONEY. I am 5'7 and 140 lbs. I usually wear a small or medium. I ordered a medium in these. They are so small I had to give them to my 12 yr old 76lb daughter. The shirt was close to being a belly shirt in length. The material was a very plastic feeling almost like a cheap halloween costume. I order these type of pajamas all the time through Amazon and I have never received a pair this poorly made. The stripes don't even look like the same design. This is such a sad knockoff.
2.0,I returned this item - the material is very scratch and looks very inexpensive.
2.0,"Took a long time to arrive and fits oddly. Eyes aren't where I expected them to be...if that makes sense? Hard to see out of too... not sure what I expected, but it wasn't much less opaque than the rest of it. Decided just to use face paint for my Spider-Gwen outfit this Halloween"
2.0,"Meh, it’s ok. It’s definitely not going to protect you from any airborne pathogens or droplets. Very very thin"
2.0,I returned the first one I ordered and ordered the next size. It’s still more snug than I like.
2.0,"I have small hands for a man; I couldn't pick up a football one-handed if I tried. These ""large"" gloves are small on me. The stitching gives after a short time, often when being pulled on, and even the fabric itself just rips open. I wouldn't waste my time trying to wash these; I have often used two or even three pair during one day. Pay a little more."
2.0,"Fit as expected , but disappointed that material was very thin."
2.0,"Fit well and would be comfy, but VERY thin and reveals everything. Not great in a shared house. Also, who wants to sleep with useless buttons pressed into their chest? Returned it."
2.0,Overall I’m disappointed with these leg warmers. They’re too short and they don’t stay in place at all.
2.0,Looked nice but rots ears.
2.0,"I usually wear small, but ordered medium after reading the reviews. Still the elastic is too tight. The color and overall look is nice, but I was hoping to wear it at home and really wanted it to be 100% cotton as the website states. But on the tag says 95% polyester. Of course you wouldn't expect better quality for the price."
2.0,Bottons came off by the second week of usage!
2.0,funny but came so flat a creased we sent it back
2.0,"cheap, big, and gaudy.  If you can pull this off you're already awesome and don't need this.  Gave it to a weird buddy of mine and he rocked it somehow but this guy wears speedos (and he doesn't swim laps)."
2.0,"Not a fan of the material, looks and feels like a cheap Halloween costume like texture. The color was off as well."
2.0,"Was way to long, I  trip everytime when wearing it. The material is not quite soft or thick enough as I would expect."
2.0,i bought an xlg and it fits like a medium.
2.0,"The thumb of it broke off first attempt to put it on, got them for Halloween, put the second braclet on and the pinky snapped right off too, there really uncomfortable and scratch you’re knuckles my hands looked like a kitten scratched the crap out of them, the only good thing was the price for two"
2.0,"Its okay, it is a bit long for me since I am 5""0, I should have read the size a little better.  The strap around the neck doesn't stay, and in the cheats area it is way to long. The picture of the  butterfly is just as described. The blue butterfly is so pretty but sadly I’ll have to return cause it just doesn’t fit me correctly."
2.0,Had to return watch. The movement stops even when the watch is wound. The hands are not correctly aligned either. Disappointed because the watch was purchased as a gift.
2.0,"watch is nice, problem is has very large band."
2.0,No son tan fuertes se rompen rapido
2.0,I don't see how anyone could wear it.
2.0,"Do not buy this shirt. The two I got delivered this this are not the same quality as the ones before. They are NOT wrinkle free and do NoT have a top Snap like all the previous orders. This not the same shirt. I will not but them again, Too Bad I have been ordering these shirts for several years."
2.0,While the price was cheap so was the product.
2.0,"Hard to get on little toe, and elastic dug into my skin causing pain and deep red marks.  Not as thick a cushion as appears on web-site.  Had to cut edge of elastic to fit, and tape it.  Not worth the money or effort, caused more discomfort than solved."
2.0,Does not flow like the pictures
2.0,"I returned this item. It was too small and would not slide on the glasses. However, the order was refunded in a timely manner."
2.0,"Might work for 1 or 2 special events, but they are very very cheap, they will not hold up well for a long period of time at all"
2.0,Loved it til the crank handle fell off two weeks later. Looked and felt like great build but handle fell off. Bummer.
2.0,"I probably would have kept it if it fit, but was size large and very large. Didn't really like the hood either."
2.0,"Not what I thought.  Bought as a gift and was very disappointed.  Also, the ring that holds the charms was bent!"
2.0,"It's a size small but a little smaller would have been nice.  I'm 4'10"" and small boned so I kind of look lost in it but I will try to altar it."
2.0,Ill fitting and had chemical smell that persisted after airing outside for 48 hours. Sent them back.
2.0,The shirt says medium but love no and fits like a large and the pants are a medium and fits like a small don't like them wouldn't order again
2.0,"This necklace was a miss and a shouldn’t have. It is very light weight so it lacks substance. Though I don’t like heavy necklaces, this is just too light. In person, it looks like something kids make during crafts. Pass on this."
2.0,"Ordered a small, recieved a medium.. Too big."
2.0,Didn’t know that I’d be wearing a very tacky looking logo on the hat brim. Trying to decide how I can remove or cover it.
2.0,did not function properly.
2.0,It was pretty but came in broken so i didn't get to wear it. I had to get a refund.
2.0,Didn’t hold my umbrella
2.0,"The duppata is slim, not like a normal duppata but otherwishe the outfit is nice. A bit tight, I suggest sizing up."
2.0,"Wasn’t what I expected, had to return."
2.0,"This item was bought to replace one my daughter had that broke. Picture looks like a nice ""heavy"" looking anchor that would look nice around her neck...picture is very much ""enlarged to show detail!"" This was much, much smaller than I anticipated, especially for the price. Will probably return due to this! I think I can find a nicer one out there! Thanks anyway."
2.0,"Cute and warm, but if you have big calves don’t buy these. I wore once and they ripped at the very top."
2.0,Way smaller than I thought it would be!
2.0,it was  so so ...i got it tight and returned
2.0,I like everything but the orange buttons on the string. I haven't figured out how to remove it without damaging it yet
2.0,Nothing like picture. Some off brand Underwear but still comfy.
2.0,When I washed this item in a load of laundry the dye ran and stained all the other items.
2.0,Discolor so soon.
2.0,"This seemed like a cute wrap, but I would not feel comfortable wearing it as a skirt. It is a flimsy shiny material, so it is cheaply made for a skirt. It would be cute over a swimsuit, but I bought it with the hopes of wearing it to a HOT outdoor wedding over the summer and I ended up wearing something else. Wind would probably open it wide up, so it just didn't appropriate.  I might use it in the summer at the beach though."
2.0,Like several other reviewer‘s I bought these at Costco but they aren’t no longer available the small fit me perfect from Cosco. This pair is much larger more like a medium in sure ze
2.0,"I didn't expect perfection considering the price, but I did expect a little more. Being pretty tall, the length was a little short making it slightly uncomfortable and the top portion of the outfit was baggy, which made me think the neither going up or down a size would produce my desired fit."
2.0,Ordered an XL and was so small I had to return it.
2.0,"This shirt is cute, but it's very tight in the stomach area. If you don't have a gut, it will work, but don't even bother buying if you're plus size. It's not flattering."
2.0,Smaller than expected and irritated my skin
2.0,"I was so trilled with the first purchase of this dress that I have ordered in different color. My first dress is green more olive green color and I love it, even if it is long for my height 5’4”. Ordered size S. But  This turquoise dress came with two stains on it and other small fabric issue on the back. Soooo disappointing. Definitely sending this dress back!!"
2.0,Baggy up top. Too much fabric made it look unflattering. Pattern was super cheap looking because of the repetition. Returned.
2.0,Cheap fabric you can see thru and a button fell off when I tried it on. Button obviously not a big deal but be prepared to wear a slip.
2.0,"Can't put over large watches, or big wrist bands and buckles.. watches hit plastic and jams.."
2.0,"This piece I received looked good, but after first use, and even before its first wash, back side had lost color and threads came out, may be due to little twisting I did to let the pool water released. Disappointed."
2.0,Too Expensive over expctimg!<br />Can not wear it because it opening all the time! Sine I bought it I never wear it cause it can not wear!
2.0,The fabric is see through and scratchy. Fit as expected but but returned due to low quality fabric.
2.0,"I just had a good laugh for the day...Tried this on, couldn't get it off!  It is wonderful, soft material, good quality, just runs VERY small.<br />The inserts in the shelf bra were wrinkled and could not be straightened. Not flattering to wear.<br />Would not recommend for anyone bigger than a toddler."
2.0,I love the shoe but most of the heels on here run very very small and narrow so I had to return mines.
2.0,Low quality fabric...
2.0,Cute but very cheaply made.  The arm details were ripping out within an hour.
2.0,"Super Cute dress, poorly made, even for a semi cheap dress it kinda felt like I was wear a half made dress out of worn out rain coats? theres a flap of cloth on the inside of the breast that I cant keep down. Will have to sew and try and fix to actually wear."
2.0,"The bottoms fit fine but the top was way to small.  If you have a larger chest, this is not the suit for you."
2.0,"Not the best, they seem like good quality but under not very much tension the top clips did not stay closed"
2.0,They really hurt my eyes
2.0,"I got this for my boyfriend and it looked great for the price! After a week or two of wearing it you could see where he had been resting his wrist because the paint had been rubbed off. Also the face was scratched. For the price it's pretty good, just don't be expecting something high quality lol"
2.0,"There's no such thing as one size, but I thought it might work.  It did not, so I returned it."
2.0,I have ordered directly from rosegal and I can say their customer service is horriable and the quality of their clothes are not good at all.<br /><br />This dress is Asian size so keep that in mind. It was vet flowy around the waist and hips but very short. Does not cover my bottom barely. And the arms were strangely tight which I’ve bever experienced before I’m not k own for having large arms. I am a size 18 and they size the 4x is a US 20. Right arms and if your busty or chesty prepare for it to be snug there. If your tall wear leggings if you plan to wear it out.<br /><br />The dress also came with a defect. The sleeve of the arm has a hole you can see wear they did not stitch it to the arm (wrist area).<br /><br />Very disappointed. Maybe worth $10 but not what they are asking for it. Amazon STOP allowing the crappy products.<br /><br />I added a photo.<br />2 stars because the material is ok. Also note the belt is not a belt it is a part of the dress so you can’t removw it and the buckle is too large and twists. You can’t remove the belt and it does not go around to the back.
2.0,This mask looks fine and and I found that it fits well.  BUT I absolutely couldn't wait to get it off because it was so very hard to breathe in even without any filter in the filter pocket.  I've worn many N95s and KN95s that weren't nearly as difficult to wear for two hours.  I also have several copper and copper infused masks which are much more comfortable.
2.0,For $15 it seemed it was very cheaply made. The seam line also went right down the front of the shirt.
2.0,Really blocks out your eyes due to the thickness of the frame. The design on he sides is amazing but the front is way too thick.
2.0,Fabric is thinner and stiffer and color is not all what I expected and I have 20/20 vision
2.0,These are actually pretty cute and shipped in a somewhat decent time so they get two stars. The XXL is NO BIGGER than a size 10/12 and I don't know if they're returnable so I'll probably end up giving them to one of my teeny tiny friends. They're stretchy and look like they'd be pretty cute ....just order up like 3 sizes and you should be ok.
2.0,"Two stars instead of one because the material looks nice and it (barely) fit. I measured my wrist before ordering and got the correct size but it was quite snug. The fit is actually irrelevant since I have to return it...<br /><br />The outer layer of strap has excess material, causing a big gap between the 2 layers - it would certainly catch on things!"
2.0,Not what I expected.  Looks much nicer in photos.  This is a $50 watch made in China.  I seriously doubt any of the wood in the watch is from a German beer barrel.  It looks like cardboard.  The faux wood box it comes in is cardboard as well.<br /><br />I wish that I didn't waste $365 on this watch.
2.0,"top was way to big, got a small and I'm a 32 b-c. Bottoms fit nice but very cheeky. Very cute, disappointed it didn't fit."
2.0,"As a watch enthusiast and collector, I'll own up to spending far more time than might be sensible scrolling and searching Amazon for bargains or interesting time pieces. It seems regardless of the focus of my searches, brands like OLEVS and OUPINKE (or OPK, TDO, JSDun and Deselon) tend to pop up in all the time with any number of representations of their ""luxurious attributes."" I decided to pick up a few samples from the aforementioned brands - which appear to be mushroom varieties from the same manufacturer -  to see for myself how well they hold up to the promotional come-ons.<br /><br />The accompanying photo reflects two watches from this manufacturer's stable: the blue sunburst dial styled OLEVS and a similarly styled OUPINKE model. While the two minimalist watches have modest differences in dial markers, hand styles and different disappointing stainless steel bracelets, in terms of overall look and functionality, they're essentially consecutive slices of white bread. In each instance here, the hands and dotted markers are lumed although the longevity of illumination is less than sufficient. I did feel the OLEVS model (86g total weight) that is the focus of this product page had one of the loudest movements I've encountered in quite some time. If anything, the lighter weight OPK (69g) with the beads of rice plated band might be the least adequate of the six or so watches I acquired from this company for comparison purposes. For reasons that can only be speculated, the watch highlighted on this product page (as well as associated models from this concern) are shipped without crown retainers so it's a toss up  whether they'll be received with dead batteries or minimally, batteries that will have an inordinately reduced life span. All the these watches have snap off/on pressure closure stainless steel back case covers that is basically a consistent indicator of low end yet from the half full glass perspective, not much of an issue to replace if you have the appropriate cover replacement gadget.<br /><br />From a cursory glance many of these inexpensive models from each label seem relatively attractive and in numerable instances the only pertinent differences are the logos on the packaging and watch dials. On closer examination - let alone under magnification - most simply fail to pass muster even with consideration of the relatively low price point.  A few do not seem to be horrible and a waste of money at any price point and some potential purchasers may even consider these generally modest overall quality watches a good value.<br /><br />While all of them seem to employ arguably accurate lower end Japanese quartz movements which I suppose is the primary objective, nearly all of the quartz movement models I've acquired with a day/date complication are mired with misalignment issues in the date window. That said, I tend to believe these watches are of comparable quality to a host of popular designer branded watches employing effectively the same quality of materials but carrying substantially inflated retail prices. I cannot speak to how prevalent that deficiency is with the automatics or any of the models with the faux jewel dials and bezels because they are simply too gaudy for me to even have in my possession.<br /><br />Generally, there doesn't seem to be a major amount of differentiation between the OLEVS, OUPINKE, TDO or JSDun watches. No matter which branding you decide on it's probably a good idea just to avoid any of the purported stainless steel bracelets and opt for the arguably decent quality leather bands. While top surfaces of the links on the silver stainless steel bracelets are shiny and glimmering, I haven't found a single instance where the underside was commensurably finished. With the majority, the link end caps look dull not in the manner of a brushed finish but rather as though they were not buffed at all.  However, if you do decide to be the intrepid explorer with the stainless steel, the ion plated or coated models seem to be of higher aesthetic quality the polished stainless steel. At least the coating tends to obviate some of the rattling...excluding the beads of rice models. Just don't go there at all. Similarly the black or antiqued gold tone cases are a less off-putting choice than the yellow gold tone or the silver cases which tend to appear plated substitutions for the actual metals or minerals.  The stainless steel cases might be a tolerable choice so long as it is not paired with one of the mediocre polished stainless steel bracelets where the end result is a watch that just shimmers CHEAP."
2.0,"The necklace is very pretty, the quality of the projection is very disappointing though. I chose a black and white of two dogs and it may as well have been a blob. I ordered a different necklace from another seller and the photo (which was kinda blurry to begin with) was clear so I can only assume the quality is lacking in production here. We tried lighting it different ways, holding the necklace at different angles, projecting on to light and dark walls, and projecting from various lengths and were never successful at achieving a viewable image. Besides that, the “I love you” in a hundred languages is illegible so I can’t blame the quality of the photo. I gave 2 stars because the necklace is pretty and has a nice weight to it. Otherwise, don’t bother."
2.0,These fell apart right away. The dragon fell of right away.
2.0,FYI— The logo is an iron on transfer like what you'd find peeling off of cheap tee-shirts.  The hat itself had to be trimmed of the many loose thread hanging off of it.
2.0,"Pros:<br />- The band is comfortable, if a bit thick.<br />- The tool for replacing the pins is almost worth the price on its own.<br />- It looks really nice.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The sizing is hard to adjust.<br />- By the time you have it adjusted, you may have worn out the flimsy clasp so that it does not stay locked very well. Any attempts to bend the locking mechanism into a tighter position only make it worse. I will be getting another band."
2.0,"Not like the pic. Sloppy looking pj, not an outfit."
2.0,Handle comes undone every time  I use it.  Disappointed
2.0,Very sensitive. Broke after second time wearing..
2.0,"These are good looking items;however,they feel like they are going to break when I touch them. I am so upset that I spent the money on these. I thought for the price they'd be decent. I was definitely wrong. The packaging looked more expensive than the cuff links or tie tack."
2.0,It runs big and is see through.
2.0,I really liked the glasses at at first.  I have bell's palsy and needed glasses that prevented wind from drying out my eye.  They worked very well for this and the lens seemed good quality.  I just took them off my head to put them bag in the bag and one of the arms broke clean off.  I am very careful with my glasses and treated them well.  It was disappointing to have them only last a little over a month.
2.0,"Ok, I originally reviewed this watch last year.  it's now February 2016 and now the watch is starting to malfunction.  The numbers on the screen are disappearing.  I'm disappointed because they say, in the booklet, the watch should last (I think I read) six years.  I don't remember what month I bought the watch last year, but it's lasted about a year.  Not bad for $5.99, but I can no longer give it five stars.  I used it a lot at the gym and until it started to fail recently, it was pretty good.  I even showered with it."
2.0,"Fit well. Did snag on the bottom of the pool, on first use."
2.0,The costume was nice but it didn’t come with the belt and I haven’t gotten a response from the shop yet….
2.0,"I tried using this mask a few times during singing rehearsals, and every time I would start getting dizzy and lightheaded after a few minutes. I even cut out one of the layers of fabric to see if that would help, and it did not. The synthetic material just does not breathe well enough to be useful for long rehearsals, or for tasks that require a lot of breath, like singing or public speaking."
2.0,My husband loved these shirts......at first. After washing they shrank and ended up too short for him to wear! I guess the solution would be to buy a larger size and wash them right away?
2.0,"Quality was good, fit fine, but slit was too high.  Halfway up my panty line."
2.0,I figured it would be shorter.
2.0,"I purchased these shorts for a summer camp job, needed some comfy roomy shorts to beat the heat. I am a chubby girl and wanted something that wouldnt push on me no matter how I was positioned and these seemed like they would be loose and stretchy and light.<br /><br />They are instead thick denim, I would order a size up if you want the baggy roomy look that these show, because they barely reach my belly button and I dont have much of a gut. The denim belt is stupid, and I just use a bandana or scarf as a belt instead with these.  The pockets are nice, and overall I wear them twice a week but I won't suggest this item because of the lack of info it provides and the lack of picture/reality quality."
2.0,I wore these once to disney. My ears were flopping in the wind. They're very flimsy. Cute but not great quality. I ended up buying the ones at disney. The quality is no comparison.
2.0,Not too happy about the fabric. Felt thick and cheap. Also didn't realize the sleeves have slits so this would not be an appropriate work blouse.
2.0,"I wanted to like this coat, but it just didn't look right.  The chest made you look somehow concave, not convex.  The waist was long, as you can see in the photo.  An odd fit overall, unattractive, but at least it WAS very warm."
2.0,Cute dress just not sewn well.  Under the arms was super large. I ordered the size S
2.0,"This shirt could look cute. It's really thin material, but not horrible quality. The sleeves are way too short on me to look cute. With bell sleeves, it's hard to push them up into 3/4 length without it looking like a clown shirt. I have unusually long arms. Size LG, 5'8"" 155lbs 34DDD broader shoulders for a female."
2.0,Not great quality. You get what you pay for.  The mirror is distorted.  Uncomfortable
2.0,The color was not what i expected
2.0,"I should have looked harder and read more reviews, these earrings are cute for a 7 year old.<br />I thought they were metallic, very disappointed!"
2.0,They were really nice when I first got them now the color is fading &amp; they make my neck itch/ I caught a rash. BUY WITH CAUTION!!!
2.0,Bought these as a gift for a kid whom loves the Flash superhero.<br /><br />The backs would slide off easily and the paint came off even easier. Lasted for about three months. These were the better ones I could find at the time on Amazon.
2.0,Based on the photo these earrings are much smaller than I was expecting. The seem to open them is also more noticeable than the photo. If you like small they will be great.
2.0,"I wasn't aware the calves had a ""second sleeve"" inside, i orginally thought maybe to have the option of the rips on the legs black or skin. Unfortunately it didnr work with my calves. I ended up making shorts with them."
2.0,"I sent them back. They fit to size and were comfortable to stand on, but they rubbed in the front of ankle.  They were a little harder to get on then I had anticipated-the pull strap is made for a child's finger."
2.0,The style is gorgeous but the material is awful. It feels like what is used for rain jackets. Had to return :(
2.0,This shoe is too stiff and uncomfortable.
2.0,I had to look at the picture again and I realized that they showed a close up of the material so I could not blame them as they were honest and it was only $7.20 so what did I expect. The dress is very thin and it was shorter than pictured but I also have a full backside so maybe that is why the dress is actually to the middle of my thigh and not down to my knee. I cant really wear this dress because I wasn't going for short and sexy but professional classy and with the thin material and shortness in length it totally missed the mark.
2.0,"The glasses work ok as far as eye protection is concerned, but I've had an issue with the tiny rubber tips on the ends of the clip-ons. They fell off.  As a result the metal part of the clip-on rides directly on the lens of my eyeglasses. The glass is being scratched."
2.0,"Like a lot of other reviews, the band works fine when it is attached. The problem is one side of the band unhooks itself from the gear fit at least once a week. I haven't lost the gear fit yet, but it is pretty much a given it is going to happen eventually. It has fallen on concrete a few times, and with that the face is now cracked from the fall today, which made me finally leave a review about it. Don't buy it. There has to be a better option out there. I don't know what that option is, but this band isn't it!"
2.0,"It took me a minute to notice the spelling error on these socks. When I did finally see it I thought maybe it was some new slang word that I just wasn't familiar with. It's not. Now I see why the company didn't put accurate photos online.<br />Obviously the socks are supposed to say ""I just wanna hang with my dog"" but someone messed up big time and printed ""hany"" instead of hang.<br />It would be kind of funny if it wasn't so obvious that the company is trying to deceive buyers. These are referred to as ""funny meme socks"" but if you flip through the photos on Amazon you'll notice that they conveniently leave out the graphics and words. Most likely because if they were to show the actual product no one would buy it.<br />Other than that huge issue, the socks are decent. I wear a women's size 9 shoe and these fit me fine. The colors are bright and vibrant and I like the color scheme.<br />Unfortunately, I can only rate these 2 stars because of the spelling error and the way this company purposely deceives people."
2.0,Went to add sand to it and it fell threw where it shuts.
2.0,One stem was broke upon arrival and another broke within 2 weeks.
2.0,Being a bargan shopper I purchased this thinking that I was getting a great deal. However I found that I was really only getting junk. I mean I didn't pay a whole lot for it but still. I had it on for the first time and with in a couple of hours it had already fallen appart. The part that holds the pearls into place are not connected very well and they don't stay together well at all
2.0,Was a Veterans Day gift that was late coming after the event. Picture had brown look when received was a grey and then it was no longer available to reorder. Had to replace it through a different company
2.0,"This looks really nice in the picture and was exactly as shown when it arrived.  I was quickly disappointed , however, when the entire silver color turned grey after wearing it 2 days. I get that it is pewter but I didn't think it would look like an old pewter plate so fast.  Once it changed color the rainbow was barely visible.  It went into a junk box in my drawer after that.  Maybe its my body chemistry but I would not buy anything else make with this material."
2.0,I dislike the extremely tight elastic waist and having the actual fit of everything else way too big.
2.0,Pink color and fabrick good. Much too tight for my 5’2” 120 lb frame. Wish I had the medium.
2.0,add said 3X it was more like a small in women's so be careful of the size otherwise it is a good quality. That's why I gave it a 2 star.
2.0,Looks like material on a shiny waterproof coat.  Sloppy looking.  Returned it.
2.0,"Very disappointed in the color. In the picture, it appears black with multi color vibrant highlights. I thought that would work well with anything black teamed with other color tops. The actual earring are much lighter, more like a greenish gray core color so the highlights lose their pizazz. Not happy."
2.0,"The chains look nothing like what they do in the photos. I wish I had something like the chains on the mannequin.  Also one of the chains was broken. I luckily have pliers so I could fix it, but it's really hard trying to figure out how to put it on. Once I finally figured out how to, thanks to one of the pictures a customer posted, it didn't fit me. The only thing I can do now is try and buy some extra gold chain to connect it in the back to make it fit. I wouldn't recommend buying this product. It's cheaply made and you can find them in stores like Rue 21 or other places."
2.0,"The snazzy metallic waistbands on these panties may look good, but they don't feel good. They aren't soft and comfortable like other waistbands and I don't enjoy wearing these at all.  They bind.<br /><br />The panties themselves run a little small, but they do wash and dry just fine. However, I'm saving these for the day I completely run out of clean laundry. That's the only time I'd wear them."
2.0,"Got this outfit for our daughter, but the size of the shirt and pants seem to be a mismatch. The shirt was the right size for my 2yo daughter, but the pants were big enough for a 5 yo!  We liked the shirt enough to keep the outfit and didn't want to deal with the returns process. But the pants are going to waste, at least for 3 years or so..."
2.0,"These WiliW Sheer Pantyhose don’t seem that durable. More like the stockings you wear once or twice than throw out. Good thing there’s three in the set then. Snag very easily on almost anything and one had several random horizontal snag lines all over. The “control top” is very thin and really just a slightly thicker fabric than the legs. So if you’re looking for that type of support you won’t find it on these.<br />I’m 5’7”, 115lbs, 27”Waist and 35”Hip, usually Small but have the Medium and they fit well. The “control top” isn’t tight or supportive, but, due to my body type, I don’t really need that.<br /><br />I’ll try to wear these, as long as they don’t run while I’m putting them on, as the first pair did. Do not recommend. It is a fair deal for three pairs but you can find better, actual control tops, with higher quality for even cheaper."
2.0,"The inner layer is not attached anywhere but at the head and shoulders so trying to get this thing on is a real challenge. The inner layer just keeps sliding all over the place. Also, once you do get it on, the sleeves, at least for me, feel a bit tight, and there is a bump in the rear due to the mismatch of the inner layer with the lace."
2.0,"These were cute but way too small. I’m normally a 12-14, which they indicate is a size large. I worried they’d be too small but these were like size 6-8. I’d have to get like an XXXL to fit a size 12-14.<br />These were returned."
2.0,I’ve ordered black and pink earrings off same link.  Very disappointed the black earrings are half the size.  For as much as they are that needs to be noted so people know what they’re going to receive versus purchase.
2.0,"I have a different pair of MM jeans, but that cut is no longer offered. So I tried this one. Although the price was higher than I prefer to pay, I thought I'd try them in hopes that they fit well (which might make the price worth it). I have an average waist and curvy hips. These jeans were huge in the waist and went up super high (WELL above the belly button and practically to the bottom of my ribs). At the same time, they were tight in the thighs. If you are pear shaped like me, this might not be the cut for you. For those who are shaped differently than myself, one pro is that the material appears durable."
2.0,Was shipped in a ziplock bag. The boots look a little cheap.
2.0,"Several issues to address with this item.first off the size it is simply too slim even for some one like me who is fit and athletic. second of all the seller lies in the description as these pair of pants are not cotton. The third item is the authenticity of the product, these pants seems to be authentic LB. As to the customer service I emailed the seller about several issues I had with the a return and the worn out aspect of some of the items that I had ordered and it resulted and nothing being done. So be aware."
2.0,little to tight for me. Does not as expected when u put it on
2.0,"Yeah, I hoped to find a reasonably priced slip-on boot that would be comfortable to walk in. These had all the quality fit of a 1865 Civil War boot!! Horrible. The sole was just a big slab of rubber. Worst, though, was the huge heel area. My heels slid up and down a full inch on every step. I even returned the first pair for a smaller pair and, though the front of my foot was snug, the heel area was just too large and I'd have had blisters within a mile. Granted, I have a narrow foot, so maybe if you have broad feet and a wide heel... yeah, these might work out for you. Not for me though."
2.0,These sunglasses are pretty flimsy. Not worth the price. Better off going to Walmart and buying some better made $5 sunglasses
2.0,Very cute but it broke after wearing it for only a week
2.0,"Only fits Barbie wrists apparently, had to make my own holes in it to fit, very small strap."
2.0,"The picture makes the shirt look darker, so it's really a pale pink or really light pink haven't really decided which color it is."
2.0,Super cute but these run way small. Only reason it sort of fits is because the bottom of the shoe is flimsy.
2.0,Make sure to order a size up. Made small.
2.0,I like the style but the color changes
2.0,Tie fell apart after 2nd wear. Cheap mechanics.
2.0,"Unfortunately, my strap also fell apart the day I installed it."
2.0,"These disappointments are small, dull, and unimaginative, DO NOT resemble picture. I FEEL SAD, DUPED, and WHAT AN WASTE OF TIME DURING SO MUCH CHRISTMAS TASKS! Mr.GemKing, I wish you all the best sir."
2.0,Cute at first but ive had this jacket since August. Have worn it maybe a couple handful of times. Havent washed it. And its falling apart.
2.0,"I purchased these for my husband a he is a fisherman and always looking for a good pair or sunglasses. Saw that these were lightweight and float so i was super pumped! They came in nice packaging but when i opened them and held them for the first time, they felt so cheaply made and very easily breakable, that i put them back in the packaging and shipped them back. For $50, its not worth it. They would break at the slightest bend the wrong way, if they got dropped on the ground, or got sat on. It would be like burning a $50 bill. Meh. Found a better pair elsewhere."
2.0,"The skirt itself was very pretty! But, if you have a butt and hips this isn’t for you!! I wear a size 14 and even the 16-18 XXL didn’t fit me. Super disappointing."
2.0,okay for the proce wanted something larger
2.0,I have a 36 chest size so I ordered an XL. It hangs on me well BUT the sleeves were not done right. They were soo  tight I couldn't raise my arms and they just looked wrong. The arm holes are the right size but I measured the sleeves and the widest part was about 11 inches. I like the print and the color so I kept it and just removed the sleeves..
2.0,Cute but 7/8 was way too small to fit my size toddler that usually wears a 7
2.0,"There is a raw edge of the plastic window on the side closest to your face. Both of my children complain that the edge pokes them and scratches them, and they will not wear these masks. We have another brand where the edge is sewn inside of a liner and is more comfortable, so look for something like that instead."
2.0,"Be careful, do not dry, they shrink beyond belief."
2.0,"I bough this for around the house when I didn’t feel like wearing a bra. No can do. This think is not supportive nor does it keep anything to the imagination. It’s tight and not very stretchy, so it’s uncomfortable."
2.0,The dress is ok but the sleeves keeps falling off and it's to short I got it in a small and my daughter is a medium and it fits her for the most part but it's not going to work for her.
2.0,"I ordered this dress to add to my summer wardrobe. I live in Arizona, so I needed something light, airy, and comfortable. All the reviews pointed to this being a potential winner. When this came in, though, how wrong I was. I am a bustier lady at 36 D, and this dress didn't stretch very well over the gals. In addition, the slits that look so sexy on the model, don't look like that in real life. It honestly looked like I was wearing a half finished baby bib between my legs. It was so bad, when I stepped out to show my kids the dress and ask what they thought, they couldn't stop laughing. So, thanks for giving my kids ammo to mock their momma, Walant, but this dress is a no for me!"
2.0,Nice size but ripped first time I used it. I guess you get what you pay for!!
2.0,Very nice but it’s not white.  It’s more of a yellow cream.
2.0,They are not opaque.  The quality is low.  The material appears splotchy.<br />Fit is fine and service quick but not a quality product
2.0,"Cheap quality fabric, and the super was sewn on in an odd way that made it poke out. Returned."
2.0,"Broke after 3 weeks, I bought it thinking it would last but it's just disappointing."
2.0,"The case is fine.  I think that there was a piece of plastic embedded in the cloth that I scratched my glasses with, so be careful to check the cloth thoroughly.  Also, I am not able to get my glasses as clean with this cloth as I have been with others."
2.0,"The tight legs were a bit too much, he needed them so he kept them skin tight 😥"
2.0,The material it is made of was not as expected. Too lightweight.
2.0,Runs small I order couple pairs and wash 2 before wearing they really shrunk. Grandkids happy.
2.0,"The top fit well and I'm assuming the bottoms were meant to be super low rise. The quality left a little to be desired. When I tied the sides, the threading popped and the material came loose."
2.0,"They were very comfy, but were pretty loose around the waist. I am a curvy person in my legs, so its hard to find good fitting bottoms. Would not buy again."
2.0,I didn't like that it was a short cardigan. It was very soft and had a beautiful design which I liked alot. The color was also very beautiful.
2.0,Didn’t work for my costuming project. Wouldn’t stick to face. Get spirit gum & it may help
2.0,"small in size very cheat looking not worth the price,sent them back."
2.0,Slips off my belt every time I sit. I tried several different locations on my belt. Cheaply made.  Amazon  should not be selling such a cheaply made product. Really false advertising.
2.0,"As mentioned in many other reviews, they run very very small.  They are odd shaped.  On our third try we found a shirt that fit the Mrs., mostly.  Tight in armpit area and on shoulders but very loose in waste area.  We won't be purchasing another one."
2.0,"I ordered 2 of the same size (24 months) One Piece Fleece for my grand daughter.  When I put it on her the grey one was way too big and the<br />pink one was right, even though that both are 24 months, same brand and same cut."
2.0,"The Kermit logo is larger than desire for a dad hat, also is just a stamp. Looks a bit cheap, like they say you get what you pay for. Also slow shipping."
2.0,I sized up a size because the size chart made it look like they run small. They are so tight and so short. I ended up giving them to my 10 year old. Who they fit fine.
2.0,Works but difficult to get used to can see the straps of you wears fitted dress pants
2.0,Cute dress but small across the chest. I am 5'2&#34; and weigh 125 lbs. The size small was too tight in the chest and arms.
2.0,"Even though the company did a great job correcting a shipping issue for me...the item itself DID NOT hold up as expected.  I got only 1 use out of it, in which I had to throw it away after an hour. The bra started slipping. I do not blame the seller..for  this quality issue at all."
2.0,"I know this is supposed to be big and oversized, but def order a size or 2 down and it will still be oversized.  Mine is so big I don't even want to wear. So basically a waste of money."
2.0,Ordered an XL and it fit more like a medium or Large. I would definitely go up a size or 2 from what you would normally get depending on what type of fit you want. Other than that the fabric was soft and seemed pretty comfortable. Can’t say anything beyond that though.
2.0,"I ordered a small and they sent a medium and they were more like a large. The fabric was nothing like I expected, it was more like thin yoga material."
2.0,"This could be a five-star dress but mine was made backwards. I put it on with the tag in the back.. The seem was in the front, and the pockets backwards. Easy fix, turn it around right?! The adjustment straps are in the front now along with the tag... Okay, I'll cut the tag out and cover the straps with a jacket but it is a $40 inconvenience."
2.0,Gets tangled really easily
2.0,"cheap materials, very disappointed"
2.0,It took to long after ordered.. don't like the shiny finish on it?
2.0,"Way longer than any ear lobe, sticks out pretty far in the back. If that doesn’t matter then the rest is great."
2.0,I am very disappointed in this sweater. It's very thin/poor quality and super small! They offered a refund but it definitely wouldn't be worth the return shipping!
2.0,"Too thin to do much, no really what I was looking for. Thanks"
2.0,The lines are crooked. It’s not like advertised. It’s too long. I didn’t like how it doesn’t fit a advertised but the price was cheap.
2.0,"Very disappointed, the belt has failed in less than a year, 9 months to be exact. The teeth no longer grip the belt, it just keeps letting go. I tried trimming the belt numerous times, doesn't help, tried putting duct tape around the leather to make it thicker so it would grip, didn't help. I would not recommend it if you are looking for a long lasting belt."
2.0,"Great looking watch but, when I received it it was a little big for my wrist. So I took it to a jeweler and they said they can't take the links out of that style of band. So the other option was to spend another $40 on a band that would fit. Even then they said it wouldn't look right. Disappointed in the fact that the company didn't specify that you cannot take links out to custom fit."
2.0,Too small for skinny adult and the cape doesn’t stand up like umbrellas shape like the picture does.
2.0,"Very cute shoe, would love it if it would fit.  I  usually wear a size 6 and after reading the reviews I decided to order a size 5 1/2 and it was still too big. A size 5 might have fit."
2.0,"Cute but too short. 5’10, size 2x"
2.0,Shrunk on cold wash. Made it to small.
2.0,"I buy this to practice installing on my watch. You get what you pay for. I don't have a lot of experience during the purchase of these straps. Next time, I will buy one with double push release buttons for better security. These straps need a fold over clasp because one end of the clasp is stick out like a major sore thumb."
2.0,After the first use the edges of the white inner cloth started to rip. Its a very poor quality fabric. I wont buy this product again
2.0,Doesn’t fit according to the size chart
2.0,"No matter how much I tried to angle this up, the brim awkwardly points downward, and it looks like you're wearing one of the bonnet/hoods from The Handmaid's Tale. It's also super misshapen, so even if I wanted that look, it was wavy and schlumpy looking in addition to the unfortunate fit."
2.0,The product is outstanding however  the chain broke after three days of  use.  Five stars for the outstanding look of this  dog  tag
2.0,"Super cute but they didn’t fit and it wasn’t worth sending them back. Again, super cute."
2.0,"Small and shrunk. Disappointed in the size, as well as the neckline wasn’t right."
2.0,There were straps coming and going. Too open and too hard to get into.
2.0,This product is cheaply made (what costume isn’t?) but it serves the purpose. Looks good for a one time wear. Seams were coming apart.
2.0,Too bad but the swimsuit was absolutely too low in the back
2.0,"Honestly, my own glue and water concoction worked better, and this DID affect color."
2.0,These pants run small. Size up 1-2 sizes.
2.0,"Size small/med was too small, got the extra large, it was still too small, not a lot of difference hardly at all in the 2 sizes.  No return shipping paid, would have cost as much to send back. so had to keep.  Now I have 2 helmets that are too small to use.  IF the return shipping would be paid I would recommend, otherwise better hope it fits..."
2.0,ear cuffs way too big for my ears. and the metal too hard to adjust . They keep falling off and hurt.
2.0,It has a terrible odor.  I'm still trying to air it out before use.
2.0,Dress fits well on the upper body but too small and very short. Its way above my knees and does not fit the lower body. NOT FOR A BIG GAL:-( like me.  It's looks nice and all but unfortunately I have to return it.
2.0,"If you have nice big lobes, GET EM'<br /><br />If yours are on the smaller side, like me... skip these. Only 2 of the 4 pairs can really be bent to adjust, and even doing that, they kinda poke and prod at you.<br /><br />REALLY WISH THEY MADE THESE A SIZE SMALLER B/C VERY CUTE & UNIQUE"
2.0,nice hat got plenty compliments but it has a small fit
2.0,Layering with plaid flannel jacket
2.0,"Flimsy, slides.brole one the first noghtJust rather pay the few dollars on an old fashioned"
2.0,"fits my 7 year olds face, unfortunately purchased for me. i got a big ol’ head but this isn’t even close"
2.0,"Too fragile while you work with it, it will break it will rip apart"
2.0,The dress was too big and smelled like glue. Returned it immediately.
2.0,Got what I paif for :(
2.0,I didn’t feel the quality was up to par.  Good for around the house .
2.0,"Odd sizes, runs very large, fits all the way down not on knuckle, doesn't appear super cheap."
2.0,The fabric wasn't the greatest feeling. Also I couldn't get my arms in the holes. I returned it.
2.0,The color pink is very dull... more like a grayish pink... lol not sure if that made sense... seem durable... perfect size for a child under 5...
2.0,"Looks good and fits comfortably for the first 5 or 6 wears, then the plastic ribbing starts to bend and stab you in the sides. I have several bruises on my waist from a night out where it started assaulting my skin. Invest in a metal ribbed corset instead."
2.0,Pretty for about a week but then looks real fake
2.0,It is not as pictured at all the ears are way smaller than pictured. Other than that the product is good
2.0,Too flimsy. The whole thing felt like plastic.
2.0,these were short and kept slipping off feet and bottom with grippers kept turning to top
2.0,Color was what I wanted.<br />I wear a size 10.<br />Wasn't a good fit at all<br />Didn't cover my heel completely.<br />Returned without issue!
2.0,This dress is thin. The white is very see through. I was expecting something a little thicker
2.0,"I don't like the material at all. Feels kind of cheap, like a costume. If I didn't feel big before I put this on, I definitely felt it when wearing this. It hugs my body in all the wrong places."
2.0,"Nice looking hat, good fabric, but none of it matters because elastic is shot after only a few months. Can’t wear it at all now."
2.0,this is a high quality product in terms of material and looks and the interchangeable magnets is a great idea....the big problem with this product is the placement of the magnet...it's placed to high to attach to a shirt pocket...if the interior magnet could be placed lower so that it was near the fabric of the pocket so the holder won't fall out it would have gotten 5 plus stars from my dad.  If you looking for a handsome eyeglass holder with an attractive American Flag or Doggie Paws magnet to make it unique (without expecting it to attach your shirt pocket) then you have come to the right place.
2.0,Doesn't look like the photo really at all says sfa but not really fits up to a max size 14 woman ripped while putting on which bmed me out I've had a lot of these lately and rarely are they so cheaply made that they tear while trying on
2.0,"Glass's were bent,when delivered,tried to fix it but broke."
2.0,"Way too small, wasn't worth it at all. Very disappointed"
2.0,The little stone was on crooked.
2.0,"This hat is super long, but really narrow. I bought a men's hat because I wanted a slightly looser fit, but this is tighter than all of the women's hats I have. I can't figure out how to style it without looking dumb. The extra length gives it a bit of a condom tip effect. The material is nice though, so it gets 2 stars. I'm just not going to be able to wear it....<br /><br />Update 2/8/2019: Since I left this review, Livingston has sent me three emails, and have offered me a full refund. An email of this nature would have been nice, but after receiving the third one titled ""let's hear from you"" I'm honestly kind of annoyed. You already did hear from me. I left the review I did because the hat was not good. A refund will not make me change my mind/review about how tight and lumpy this hat is. I didn't leave a review to malign the company that makes the hat -- just to warn other consumers that it doesn't fit well or look good, so I haven't been able to wear it. I honestly don't care about the money -- that is not the point of a review. So, here's the updated review I assume this company is trying to get out of me: be aware that if you leave a negative review on this item, you're probably going to be emailed about it repeatedly. I wish they'd spend the time and effort improving their hats instead of emailing me about it. I'm honestly tempted to remove another star for the annoyance, but again: product reviews aren't about the company, they're about telling other customers what to expect from the product."
2.0,It's a Ser thru. and it's  very small and I order a large.
2.0,I’ve been using small round earrings with this same closure since the 90’s. I had such a hard time getting these closed. I’m also HIGHLY allergic to base metals. The only metals I’m not allergic to (as they contain no nickle) is Sterling Silver and titanium. Within a few hours of wearing these earrings my pierced holes were getting infected. This leads me to believe they may be silver plated.
2.0,Good looking belt; but buckle broke on the 1st day. I see this happening to others. How come they can't get the buckle right...too bad.
2.0,I was really excited for this to come in the mail but really disappointed when I got it. The print is absolutely beautiful and sizing was spot on but the romper looked as if it was made uneven. The string on the top of the romper that you can tie into a bow was sewn off center so when I put it on the strings were farther to the left side of my body rather than in the center. I tried simply just twisting the top part of the romper once I was wearing it but then the left arm sleeve becomes a bit too tight and it eventually twists back. Material is horrible but isn't the best. Sadly I will be returning
2.0,Zipper broke very easily.
2.0,"These bras fit awkwardly all around and looked less than attractive.<br /><br />1. The sides are shaped in such a way that they dig into the armpit<br />2. The cups are quite oddly shaped and do not conform to the breast shape - they are also very visible through the material<br />3. The support is definitely not there<br />4. If you have a long torso, the bottom band will probably hit you right in the dreaded roll-up spot and cause the bottom up the bra to bunch and roll up on you."
2.0,"Very poorly made. Seams are crooked, materials are cheap, the plastic smells bad and has no venting like a cloth or paper mask. Within seconds, the plastic fogged up.  fogging face mask with fogging glasses equals no comfort."
2.0,"Update: the eatch stopped after 6 days. Ain't nobody got time for that. I am sad. The design was so great.<br />Originsl: the slim-made one handed watch is very unique. The white on black numbers mage the time easy to read. The watch is very thin and light, but seems strong. The leather watch band is soft and stylish. I really like this watch and am happy I tried a one handed watch."
2.0,They where nice but I take a XL and these were suppose to be L/XL. Good for L but not for XL.
2.0,"These are cute, but I expected them to come up higher on the leg than they do. They only go up to mid calf on my (very tall) 8 year old."
2.0,These would be fine if you're looking for tights but they should not be marketed as leggings.  Leggings are completely opaque and can be worn with a tunic length top.  Tights are not completely opaque and require a shirt/shorts over top.
2.0,The belt is too small.
2.0,very fragile.
2.0,Magnet is weak. Doesn’t hold but about two bills.
2.0,The handles on this bag began to come apart and lose a bold which is on for decoration purposes.  Definitely not quality made for the money spent.
2.0,"To thin, cheap"
2.0,Very disappointed.  Way too small
2.0,My daughter loves the show and she loves the necklace. But it's very cheap and the locket doesn't latch properly. It is NOT worth $50.  I would not purchase again.
2.0,The strap broke as soon as they were put on
2.0,"After rewarding reviews it said it didn’t fog and it was easy to breathe. However, my mask kept fogging up and it didn’t fit my face right."
2.0,I ordered this for my son for Christmas because this is his favorite character unfortunately the large is not true to size Large its more like a medium. I am very disappointed seeing how there is not enough time to order him a larger size and receive it before Christmas.
2.0,Hang to dry otherwise it’s so sticky and hard to fold
2.0,I was not happy with the quality of this dress --- it was returned
2.0,"So bought this approximately 4 months ago.  The keeper band just broke yesterday. (The original lasted almost 2 years)  I can't say that I'm all that disappointed as I'm hoping the whole band breaks to give me a reason to replace it.  The band itself is softer and more supple than the original.  I thought I would like this, but I found that the grippyness ended up grabbing my skin more and  kept the moisture close to my skin after swimming or even washing my hands.  I missed the original more plasticy band that was original with it, as it did neither of these things.<br /><br />Also because the band is softer material, it shows wear marks the metal clasp locks into the band.  This won't be a deal breaker for some folks, but I tighten and loosen the band based on my activity.  Also while I usually prefer it more snug for activities, with the extra moisture accumulation under the band, I found myself adjusting this band larger and smaller more often."
2.0,Would not purchase again. Quality was lower than expected.
2.0,"I have requested to mail a return label to my address, I do not have access to a printer.  The purse is lovely but too large.  Please mail the return label to me.  thank you."
2.0,"Low waisted, runs small, and the waistband is not wide as pictured. Extremely unflattering to anyone without washboard abs- the waistband accentuates and actually *creates* a muffin top if you don't already have one."
2.0,I had to return it.  Fit was too small and lots of spandex
2.0,No straps were found. I double checked the package. The fabric is stiff and not flowy like i thought by looking at the picture
2.0,"Cute color and phrase, but smaller than expected - stretchy material so it was form fitting. Hugged curves in the wrong places."
2.0,The leggings were see through<br />And very cheap quality
2.0,This hat doesn't fit me.it's not very nice
2.0,Take a look at the pictures I took.  You can clearly see the strips don't line up.  This was the first sign of poor craftsmanship or should I say machinesmanship.  Also came in with two snags.
2.0,Nice colors the band is just to thin
2.0,Didnt like the material. Was like a halloween costume. Sizing was correct. Cheaply made.
2.0,"Didnt seem anything like the picture,I laughed and threw it away...money wasted again.."
2.0,"This looked ideal in the photos, so I was really looking forward to receiving it. I love the color - I got ""army,"" which is sort of a cross between khaki and moss. Really pretty; reminiscent of a garden.<br /><br />I'm a petite medium, and I knew the fit would be a bit large - but I like loose tops. I figured if the top was too long, I could tuck it in, or wear it with snug jeans or stretch pants. So I ordered a medium.<br /><br />When it arrived, the color was lovely. But I had some issues with the construction. It doesn't show in the Amazon site photos, but the sleeves actually puff up at the shoulders, like the old Leg-o-Mutton sleeves. It's probably a small thing, but that's not a look I like, at all, on me.  Especially when I'm also wrestling with a hem that goes eight inches below my waist.<br /><br />The lace is nice enough - and it looks nice - but it does snag easily, so it requires careful management. The body is lined in a matching color, but the liner is a clinging net, which in the right atmosphere rides up, so it too requires careful management.<br /><br />All in all, just not quite the top I was hoping for. Not bad, by any means, and I'm sure quite lovely for many. Just not what I thought I was ordering for me."
2.0,More than half of these socks are to small or to thin to be called socks. They immediately became toys for the kiddos. Their was no way to use them for actual socks!! The wording on some of the socks made no sense.
2.0,"Rough and scratchy, not at all as described in that way. It was cute, butI had to return due to how rough the material was."
2.0,"Really nice color but low quality hard wear and straps,liner it works for my needs"
2.0,Cute dress but fabric is very flimsy.
2.0,"I loved this dress, however,  the breast area was definitely designed for smaller breasts. I am a 36D and had major side boob and little coverage with a size medium."
2.0,"Too Big in an XL, sloppy look & not sheer enough."
2.0,I washed it and shrunk a size down. :( Now it's really tight. It's that really soft T shirt material.
2.0,"I sized up, and it sticks out like an a-line skirt from under your armpits. It isn't fitted at all. Will give to a friend"
2.0,It’s just a pair of cheap sunglasses with an Iowa sticker slapped on the arm 😆 I had brought a nicer yet cheaper pair back home with me from the campus bookstore but the lens cracked in my suitcase so I got these to replace that pair. Not horrible but it’s kind of funny they just have a sticker on them.
2.0,"The frames were way too small for the face, I thought they would be a little bit over sized but they were not sadly."
2.0,"I am about 5’7 and dress was definitely too short, didn’t even hit my ankles. Material is nice and stretchy but definitely looks like it will shrink quite a bit. I also returned this 10 days ago and I am STILL waiting for my refund"
2.0,"Waist was a little larger than expected. Material is very thin. Pockets are very shallow. And the included belt was a joke. I've  never seen a design like it and could not figure out how to adjust the length, which I'm assuming can be done since it could fit around me twice!"
2.0,"When I saw this dress online I absolutely fell in love with it. And when you are familiar with Chinese sizes, you know to order 1-2 sizes larger. However, I was very disappointed when I received the dress: The picture online is most likely copied from a quality designer dress, thus the print you get is different from what you would expect and the fabric is cheap and off color, i.e. the collar and shoulder straps are ivory but the printed part starts in white and then continues in a very brownish dirty printed floral design. Looks ugly and not &#34;in tune&#34;! Too bad, it will be returned ASAP :("
2.0,They aren't as the pic shows. Not made of cloth really but some stretchy very thin material.
2.0,Fabric thin and cut was one inch longer on right side compared to left
2.0,"I'm looking for a dress to wear to a family wedding, and this one looked like it had potential. The color is nice, and it seems true to size, but it's not very flattering at all. The torso is short, and the material is rather clingy. Those two factors make it very unflattering on me. Maybe it would work for someone with a slimmer figure, but it was a no-go for me."
2.0,I liked how the shirt fit and how it laid. What I don't like and can't stand is thin fabric. It's see through material. If the fabric was more substantial I could recommend it.
2.0,"I loved this purse,  I get a lot of compliments but it is already falling apart.  I will use it until it's not useable because I do like the looks of it.  The small purse that comes with makes a nice cross body and it is holding up well.  I use it every day"
2.0,Do not order this a size larger. It’s huge. Order the smallest one possible. Even the smallest one is too large.<br /><br />Also it won’t stay secured. Even when tied secure it just won’t stay put.<br /><br />I would not reorder this robe.<br /><br />I’m fact I returned two already bc I kept getting the size wrong due to the review suggestions but now I’m on my third one and exhausted from all the returns so guess I’m stuck with it.
2.0,"So pretty, but the rose gold started to erode really fast where it was through the piercing. I paid that much for it thinking the rose gold would prevent this but now it's turning my nose green. Bummed cuz it's so cute!"
2.0,Owned for 2 weeks. Barley worn.<br />Somehow the charging port got bent off. And the lights were way too bright. The strob mode hurts the eyes. I don't recommend these. I wish I would of spent my money more wisely.
2.0,Not quite the measurement they have listed. Were much too small
2.0,The net is smaller and shorted than I hoped. Whatever you catch can fly out easily.
2.0,This material was not stretchy at all compared to other prints
2.0,It’s not light gray and white like the picture. It’s camo but all light blue.
2.0,"as I was checking out the item, several links fell off. they weren't closed off in tight circles and they kept on breaking apart. Have to return, can't wear otherwise it will fall apart"
2.0,"The tie dye was a pattern, not actual tie dye. It looked terrible. I was trying to match my daughter's dress, but it was like looking at 2 different camoflauges."
2.0,"Pretty suit, disappointed! Think it was a &#34;second&#34; cups not smooth, very small at the chest, and seams not right!"
2.0,Will do for one or trips to the pool.  Not well made at all.  Looks good at first but is cheaply made so depending what your needs are this could do the trick if you like a new suit for each season.
2.0,"Ridiculous sizing on these. I wear and ordered medium and it was Tight. I returned medium and order large, is extreme"
2.0,"I have a small head, and it was slightly bigger, but manageable. However, after washing it, it did not go back to size, it expanded, and list its elasticity. I will not purchase another."
2.0,Es de mala calidad ...se puso negro desde la primera vez
2.0,"I’ve been wearing these slippers for years and they were the absolute best for people with plantar fasciitis.  However, just purchased my fourth pair and they changed the foot beds to a much cheaper feeling support.  Plantar fasciitis foot pain came right back and am going to send these back. So disappointed as the original models were life altering."
2.0,The print is beautiful and that's the best thing about the dress. The material is terrible. Inn 5'6&#34; and it was way too short. I ordered a large and it was too tight around the hips and to big on the bust. Not s good dress for pear shapes.
2.0,"Pretty earrings, extremely difficult to unclasp- at least the first time.  Hope this can be fixed because otherwise I may have ordered more."
2.0,Very cute but way too small a lot smaller than what I thought it would be
2.0,All the earrings were jammed into a tiny tiny Mylar bag which caused them to all smash into each other. All posts were bent and some of the backs crushed. Otherwise the earrings would’ve been cute.
2.0,"It was great while they lasted. Before the end of first use, 2 fingers popped off."
2.0,"First pair fit, but one wouldn't charge. My son really liked these, and begged us to try again.<br />Again, one wouldn't charge. My girl happened to turn the bad odne upside down and the sole and battery module fell out of the bottom of the shoe! Turns out, one was unplugged, but the shoes don't fit him, so we sent them back. Check under the insole and make sure everything's plugged in if yours doesn't charge at first. I have a feeling that the first one had the same problem..."
2.0,Don’t buy! The back of the magnetic part snags fabric. I’ve worn it every day for about a week and it’s snagged multiple times a day on all kinds of fabric. Don’t like compared to models I use to have. Don’t buy!
2.0,I like the style but the top runs smaller than I thought it would
2.0,The straps do not adjust their very short makes it hard to carry over the shoulder so you can use your two hands. Not as sturdy as I had hoped for either I would have sent it back but it did not have free returns
2.0,"The description says chips, the picture photo is of rocks. You will be very disappointed if you go by the misleading photo. The price is fine for what you are receiving. The stones are tiny and thin. Should compare stones to the size of a dime or nickel at best.  Color is very nice. If you are looking for CHUNKS, this is not the purchase for you. I gave this a 2 only because the seller is using a misleading photo to sell these stones."
2.0,This sweater looks nice but it is way too small for a 2X. I normally wear XL and ordered larger to make sure it would fit. Ordered two sizes larger and still too small. A shame since I like the color and the thinness which is perfect for the warmer climates.
2.0,"I was looking for a mechanical watch since I only wear a watch occasionally. This watch was supposed to be mechanical with ""automatic"" feature of you wore it frequently. It does not keep running while you are wearing it, it does not run for more than 3 or 4 hours when you wind it. Cute but not functional, I'm sending it back and will not be ordering from this brand again."
2.0,Scratch way too easily. Was just wiping them with a cotton t shirt and they were all scratched up after.
2.0,It somewhat sturdy.
2.0,They’re too hard to get on I’m going to return them
2.0,I’m 5’3 115lbs ordered small way too big
2.0,"Nice looking socks but if you can't get your hand in them how are you supposed to get your foot in them ? I received the socks on  Sunday opened on Monday . Could not get my hand in them to turn them inside out, Maybe me , wife couldn't either. Contacted 800 number 4 days in a row. No customer service so much for 100% guarantee of satisfaction by GO2. Thank you Amazon for taking them back."
2.0,Es hermoso pero transparente
2.0,"This is a nice shirt, but the bottom has already started coming undone. This is before the first wash. A little disappointed."
2.0,"I thought it was supposed to look like a cupcake as shown in the advertisement, a little disappointing. As far as the thickness it’s a gift so I didn’t  open the package"
2.0,Looks too cheap. Too light. Overall bad quality.
2.0,It seems nice but with the wire it is really impractical.
2.0,Very cheap quality. Back of the shoe keeps falling off my heel. Will just donate them.
2.0,"I have ordered Yexipo tank top before. Love the color!  The first one has a breast pocket and ran a bit big. The new one has different cut across the top and no breast pocket, it ran small. Both are LARGE. I am 5’3” and 135lbs. I took a side by side to show the difference in sizing on both of these LARGE shirts. Both shirts are soft, well stitched, pretty color, and thin breathable fabric.<br />Just be advised the sizes run a little weird."
2.0,"If this is what watches used to be like, I am glad we advanced to where we are now."
2.0,elastic is shot too fast in the legs
2.0,"The shirt looked great, and I liked the thin material (cooler in the hot sun), but unfortunately it was too short.  Some people have six pack abs....I have more of a case...or 1/4 keg.  I am not what I would call &#34;fat&#34;, but I do have a little bit of a beer belly.  I am 5'10&#34; @ 215lb and ordered a 2X.  It was fine girth-wise, with plenty of room to spare, but it was a bit on the short side.  If I reached my hands above my head, my belly and sides would be somewhat exposed.  This might be fine for any of the ladies watching me (LOL) but it felt a bit drafty.  They should designed this shirt 3-4 inches longer.  I order 2X in another brand and it was definitely a bit longer."
2.0,Too large- Fit not as expected
2.0,Some strands were broken but wearable
2.0,"Misleading and ok, nothing special"
2.0,Save your money... Total sham.
2.0,"Nice looking watch. Could not adjust the band to fit my wrist. Tried to follow the instructions, but it did not work."
2.0,Fabric is thinner that gauze type. Ok. Have had it a while and never wore it...
2.0,Have some marking.
2.0,This bag is VERY small. It's no bigger than my hand. It IS very well made. (I have another of Eco-City's bags and I love it). There weren't any dimensions listed when I ordered it so I thought I was getting a bag big enough to at least carry my iPad mini. It sticks out an inch and I can't close the zipper. It's too small for anything except maybe a pack of cigarettes and your phone. It's like one of those ridiculously small handbags girls take to the clubs that look like it belongs on a doll.
2.0,The dress didn't run true to size and it looks better in the picture than in person.
2.0,"They feel very cheap. The arms are very thin. They're not wide at all, arms kinda cut into the sides of my face. The arms are not really plyable, so bending them to fit doesn't work either. Not recommended for bigger heads, def would not buy again."
2.0,"I have metatarsalgia in my right foot.  So after reading reviews a decided to try these sandals.  I wore them for a walk in my neighborhood and initially thought them supportive, but after a bit I got the same pain in my foot I always get,  so unfortunately they weren't helpful at all. When I returned home and took them off I also found that they gave me a huge blister under the heel strap. For the price I was less than impressed. They've been returned."
2.0,Nice socks colorful warm but too short
2.0,"They dont hug the foot & the size was much bigger than I need. But, they are very cute. Would order a size smaller if I order again. Dont havebthe receipt to return them unfortunately."
2.0,Dress was great quality but the color a was not as described
2.0,First time wore and washed one sock looked like it was years old. Some material had vanished and appeared like gauze.
2.0,The image makes it look like you get many stones.  I swear the description of this product was changed AFTER I purchased it.  You only get 2 or 3 stones.  Not worth the price at all.  Be warned.
2.0,Very cheap and very bright yellow
2.0,"Extremely cheap. Plastic extra pouch came broken and all zippers look like they will break soon. Work but barely, should've been half the cost."
2.0,"I purchased these for searching while on patrol. As many others in law enforcement an accidental needle stick is terrifying, however; while wearing the gloves i have almost no sense of feel."
2.0,"Hilariously long. I like the oversized look, so the fit of the body of the dress was actually good. But for a girl who is 5'4&#34; there was literally like an extra foot of fabric dragging on the ground. My husband had a good laugh."
2.0,"Nice ""little"" bag, like seriously it's little. Love the color, but the bag is starting to rip now. I've had it for about maybe a month."
2.0,I ordered the Large and they were too small. Returned and just got regular knee socks that worked better.
2.0,"This top looked nice, and I oredered it to be oversized (2XL) but when it arrived, it was at best a size Large, and that is being generous.  Do not order your regular size, go up at least two sizes - three if you don't want it to be form fitting -  sad thing for me was 2XL was the biggest size they even had.<br /><br />Best thing about this purchase was the extremely easy way that Amazon dealt with the return.  Could not have been a better experience."
2.0,"Ordered the dark grey one and it came as a light grey, and ordered a medium and fits like a large"
2.0,"It's good quality but way too bulky even for man hands.  That being said, if you are into the biker look, it's perfect and it actually has a very unique clasp."
2.0,"These pants are very comfortable and a pretty blue color; however, they are 100% polyester and made me break out in hives around the waist band. I’ve never had this happen before. If you can handle all polyester these may work for you. The pants are more of a harem pant with the waist snug and the legs very full. I’m only 5’3” and these came just to my ankle."
2.0,"I liked the squish, but I get weird about my wrist laying on the desk while I’m typing and the squish was too much. It was ok, but ultimately it felt funny on my wrist so I returned it."
2.0,Thin and not good quality. The buckle fell off within a week and some skulls look blurry. Will not buy again.
2.0,Looks great but ripped after one wear
2.0,Did not work well.  would not stay fastened to the buckle.
2.0,"The sleeves are not as long as they appear to be in the picture and the quality of the seam work is not as nice as I expected; there is a place right under the arm where the thread is messed up.  Other than that, the dress looks okay."
2.0,"The material is thick. It's not what I hoped for, for a 14$ single mask. It's fnf design is runny and bleeds into itself."
2.0,Cheaply made and folds outward with light wind. Not as good as the same one I bought at the store.
2.0,"I wear a size 6 to 6 1/2. I ordered size 6-7. It was too big. I returned it. I would have ordered the smaller size, however the smaller size was for 4.5 - 5.5. Did not want to take the chance that it would be too small. The sizing on these swim shoes is too much of a range. Needs to be narrowed down to each individualized size. Nice swim shoe though."
2.0,"I received this dress today and was very impressed with the quality, however, when I unzipped to try the dress on, it had obviously either been worn or tried on and returned as it is covered with make-up and deodorant on the inside.... I have never had this happen when ordering.  Super disappointed as it was purchased to wear to an event this weekend and have no time to receive a replacement."
2.0,"The dress is pretty but it does not work as it's intended to. The straps are placed in a way that you cannot actually close the dress, a wrap dress should be able to wrap around your body and close properly. That wasn't the case with this dress, I stood in front of the mirror for about 10 minutes trying to figure it out. Maybe I got a defective dress but sadly it has to be returned, I was really looking forward to bringing this dress on vacation."
2.0,"Love these, but wish they made bigger sizes and/or had a reinforced toe.  My toes split the seam on almost all of them after 2 wears."
2.0,Cheap shades. The brand has lost it's luster from the prime years in the 80's. The quality just isn't there anymore.
2.0,"The color is nice but the lace and the tongue of the boot have different mindsets. The tongue is difficult to straighten under the shoe string, and as you walk, it slides to the side."
2.0,It was not as thick as I was expecting. There was a weird fabric line across the chest also that was obvious. I returned it.
2.0,"I wanted a bright yellow product, but what I got is more of a gold colored product.  I'm highly disappointed.  I haven't opened the package because frankly, it's not what I wanted."
2.0,"The material was very thin, and when I opened the package, the material was pilling on the inside of the shirt.  I returned it."
2.0,the color was a pee yellow. not like the other Columbia shirts I bought.. but the under armor shirts are more  true to their color
2.0,Loved the design but I didn’t care for the fit. It won’t stay up for more than a few minutes of running or workout. It’s extremely agitating to having to always pull your pants/leggings up.
2.0,"It's a nice size for a crossbody styled purse, and it comes with a storage bag but those are the only things I like about it. I dont care for the design or the materials this purse is made out of. It, to me, looks very cheap, the chain and the zipper especially. I hate to give reviews this bad but I just don't like it."
2.0,Let me start off by saying that the color pattern and material is very nice. Now for the bad. If you have any type of muscle in your arms the shirt is way too tight. Also down at the bottom of the sleeves it is ultra tight. The button spacing is pretty awkward and my opinion. For the price I will not return but also would not purchase again.
2.0,"These are just ok, not great. The coconut buttons click together every time you take a step, so I took one button off each side so there is nothing for the other button to click on. They're fairly soft but I personally think the padding in the bottom is too thick. Overall I would not buy them again."
2.0,The color and feel are great but Sadly these bands didn't fit my silver frame.  I tried for hours to clip them to on but the ends were too thick to fit the into the edge of the frame.  I couldn't use them at all.
2.0,The padding made the C cup fit like a J cup! Ive lost a little fat and the girls didnt like the fit.
2.0,"I am a very solid size Medium at Gap, Loft, Francesca's, etc. however this was awkwardly small. The length of the arms and the length of the body made me look like I was trying to wear a size XS top."
2.0,Great product looks good. But they kept falling of the car everytime i get out the car. Also the slightest opening of the window both flew off lost them without an hour use. I don’t recommend this product poor clips. But the quality isnt bad just the clips
2.0,Won’t stay up on nose.  And the readers are to high
2.0,These appear as though they are high quality and the strap and frame and lens are nice but they leak between the plastic and silicone.
2.0,"The cut is cute and the stretch is flattering, it's just so thin and see-through because it's white. I'm 5'9""/36B/145lbs athletic build and a medium fit perfectly."
2.0,No support. Do not purchase for exercise.
2.0,These looked cool but just a few days after wearing each one the designs which wear painted or sticked on chipped off almost whole design from these... I wouldn't recommend buying these.
2.0,"My daughter loved it, but the lights had fallen out and we did NOT receive the beanie hat."
2.0,"This just looked bad.  Too baggy,  like the child of an oversized tshirt and a blouse."
2.0,"I returned this bag because the chain, which came in a separate bag inside the watermelon clutch, had no way to attach to the clutch. The clasps that were supposed to open around the small hooks on the bag weren't actually made to open, so I couldn't use it at a crossbody bag. The bag is too cumbersome and the plastic is too cheap to be used effectively as a clutch, so I returned it and got a refund."
2.0,"It came smelling really plastic, almost rubbery smelling. I liked the option of the handles or the shoulder option. It's very roomy which I like but the material is DEFINATELY not durable."
2.0,Sprayer does not work very well
2.0,To small...<br />Didn't fit at all...
2.0,Cheap material & cut way too small.
2.0,Fits big on wrist and looks cheap
2.0,"Fits very tight on my lip, can't use."
2.0,It fits to tight
2.0,The swimsuit was too tight. It was very hard to put on but it's a very lovely print!
2.0,"This dress (tunic in my opinion) is sized incorrectly as well as the color was wrong. I’m short and this was definitely not a dress on me. Also, I ordered burgundy and got candy apple red. Huge difference in color."
2.0,Don't waste your time with this cheap knock off!
2.0,"The product runs extremely small.  I wear a medium comfortably.  I ordered a large sure to the reviews.  It is still uncomfortable.  Shortly after purchasing, one of the buttons has fallen off.  Very disappointing."
2.0,"I ordered well above my size, the top fit but the shorts are way too small"
2.0,Ordered 2 pairs of men's XXL . Tags said XXL but pants fit my daughter who wears a woman's size 7-8/ med. I can not even imagine what size a medium truly would fit; a small child maybe?
2.0,"These slippers run small.  The first pair I ordered for my husband were too small so we exchanged them (at our expense) for a larger size.  The larger size fit but had a tear along the seam where they weren't sewn correctly.  For the price, we expected better quality.  We returned them (again at our expense) and promptly received a refund for the purchase price.  It's a shame-he was looking forward to using them after working outside in the cold all day."
2.0,"I have bought a few Nike Element 1/4 Zips from Nike directly and they fit perfect, this one however fits larger than others as well as the material seems to be thinner than other element 1/4 zips as well."
2.0,"Super cute, but broke instantly"
2.0,"[WIFE] These rings are really cute. They are a bit difficult to take off, as when they click together, they're REALLY secure. If you have a nickel allergy, DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT buy these. They are not steel like advertised. I found this out this morning...now my nose is red, bumpy, and raw. I'm pretty disappointed."
2.0,"It’s cute but I purchased it expecting a sweatshirt. It’s thin, like a long sleeve T-shirt."
2.0,"This ""dress"" is too short to be a dress and too long to be a tunic for leggings.  The shoulder seems are a bit uncomfortable as well - and I'm not sure why.  I tried to like this dress but it just didn't work.  It needs to either be several inches longer to be a really fun swing dress or several inches shorter to work as a tunic with leggings."
2.0,"I usually wear large, but since I knew it came from china I order 2 sizes up and still did not fit."
2.0,I did not like the pattern
2.0,Blurs images
2.0,"Do slike the material, too clingy."
2.0,Had to replace the jumper on both pieces becasue the puzzle pieces fall off all the time. The engraving is like 3/4 on one piece and 1/4 on the other. Needs to be centered more.
2.0,"I really wanted to love these. They are so very soft and so affordable. Unfortunately they did not work. I am 5'3&#34; and they are so long I had to pull them up to my rib cage. It almost felt like maternity wear. The waistband then cuts into you and is very uncomfortable. When I took them off later in the day I realized the seams had ripped out in the crotch area. I'd worn them once. I'd done nothing extraneous. Apparently sipping coffee on the couch and watching tv can cause these to rip.<br /><br />Maybe these work for tall, skinny people. They were not an option for me as a shorty. Back to LLR."
2.0,"I am so disappointed with this nose ring. It will not stay closed for anything. It snags on my washcloth, clothes, shirt cuffs, everything. I love the look of it but it doesn't stay together."
2.0,"Very thin material, narrow at the top, small hoodie, but wide at the bottom.<br />I'm '5'5 and 112 lbs and ordered extra large.<br />It was still barely fitting at the top.<br />If you want a warm sweatshirt, don't buy this."
2.0,Not true to color. Feels very cheap.
2.0,"I love the style, however the straps need to be changed on these. The elastic straps hurt the back of my ears so badly, I cannot wear them for more than 30 mins. It is a shame too because they are so cute. I am going to cut them off and try sewing on some other straps myself, as I do not want the masks to go to waste. Please consider changing the straps."
2.0,Not crazy about these.  Almost feels like you're wearing plastic pants. I purchased a xl
2.0,I do like the earring but it is only one earring not a pair ! Very disappointed.
2.0,Not same size inside package. Every second one is smaller with a full size. From 5 pc are 3pc real size-2pc small size. And the quality is very cheap. knitted very lazy thread which gibes you large holes when socks are worn.
2.0,"Like other reviewers experienced, the veil isn't anywhere near long enough on the one I received. It doesn't even reach my eyebrows. What is even the point then?? The lace is pretty, but the raggedy seams are visible on the backside of the ears. But since it's black, it's not too noticeable. I mean, I wasn't expecting superior quality for under ten bucks, so I'll let that slide. However, the shortness of the veil is a huge letdown."
2.0,"Turned my skin green. I at least expected it to be sensitive solution. It's cute I guess, I just wish I could actually wear it"
2.0,Turned her finger green. Nope
2.0,Too large for a woman
2.0,Look just like the picture but the XL is way to short for me and I am 5'4. They are not cute as a mid calf capri but would fit a child!!!
2.0,far too small
2.0,The button fell off right before I even took it out of the packaging... it's really pretty but I can't even bend over without it &#34;showing too much&#34;
2.0,Very disappointed.  Many of the finger lights did not work.  Will look for another provider next time.
2.0,This dress very thin. Not what I expected.
2.0,"The picture is so inviting.  I bought them several months ago and was so disappointed.  They are very small, appropriate for a child. Also, the stone is pale.  I kept them buy only wore them once.  I saw them again when doing my wish list for Christmas, and bought them with gift card money.  When they arrived I couldn't believe I had been fooled twice by the same beautiful picture!  I sent them back this time."
2.0,It's shown ingraved in black but it arrives in tan engraved.  Not that happy about it. Thinking about returning it possibly.
2.0,Battery died within a couple of months.
2.0,I knew these were thin from other review but I didn't read that they were short.  I am 5'8 so average sized for a woman but these are high waters on me. I was expecting the length that is shown in the photos. Thank goodness I am just going to wear them around the house but I will not be walking about the door.
2.0,The clarity was good but I have to return because they don' fit over my Rx glasses
2.0,"I order this 2 sizes larger than i wear, and it's almost to small."
2.0,Quality is really poor.  Very thin fabric
2.0,I ordered a pack of 12. Only got a pack of 6...and they look super thin
2.0,"The robe is soft, amazing and cozy, but the embroidered Sith portion was poorly done. Oh well, nice robe, poor stitching, like bad."
2.0,Dose not stay close will open
2.0,changed colour after one wear
2.0,I thought I could do sublimation on the..but they can not withstand the heat at all.
2.0,I want to return
2.0,"Delivery was as expected,  the leggings are as describe but sorry to say, they are not to my liking. Size is fine but they are unattractive,  they tendcto sliding down as if they are made low-rise instead of high waisted.  I wear them at home, that's about all I can do."
2.0,Dont like it coz u can even tell that there is an eagle. But good seller refunded me.
2.0,"Very cute dress, but I was very disappointed when it fit everywhere but my arms! I couldn’t get the arm part of the armpit to go under my armpits. It fit everywhere else but my upper arms. I am going to return it for an XL and hopefully it is bigger in the arms and not everywhere else!"
2.0,Dress is nice. The only disappointment is that the sleeves are way too tight. The body fits perfectly.  I ordered the 2x but should have gone with 3x and then adjust down. No space in sleeves for adjusting.
2.0,"Used it for 2 months now, the zip is not working"
2.0,"The pendant is good quality, but the lace it is on is just cheap shoe lace. Not an nice leather lace like all the other bolos have have purchased on amazon. Real shame they didn't put good quality lace on this product."
2.0,Pretty ring stone was a nice size however I'm going to have to return it and exchange of for a size 6 because the 7  Is about a 1/2 size bigger the only options for this ring are size 6 or 7 so if you are size 6 I feel this ring would not be the right size for you and would fall off your finger like it did mine disappointed cause it's a beautiful piece of jewelry
2.0,the dress was beautiful but didn't fit as expected I bought a larger size  in hopes if needed alteration I would have time to do so. Wanted to wear Christmas day but I said BAHUMBUI hope this post helps the Hourglass shape ladies. I didn't send back taken it as a lesson learned.
2.0,way too tight and no stretch
2.0,Yes it was cheap but the silver changes color when wet and the strings get hard to pull
2.0,"These socks are cute and fit well. I will be returning them however, because the inside of the socks look and feel like the patterns had been darned into the fabric! The threads are exposed which created an incredibly uncomfortable feel against my foot and ankle. I have never seen socks manufactured like this before. Very disappointed!"
2.0,Ugly tree had 4 tiny small trunks barely Thicker in the lead of a pencil... all the trees in the photos look good
2.0,"They were all adorable, but unfortunately I was allergic to them even though they said hypoallergenic. They also fit adult ears, so not just for kids!"
2.0,So dissapointed. The button hole was so tiny compared to the big pearl button!
2.0,"if you are bottom heavy. turn the other way now. i wear a 36 b bra and a size 12 pants with a small waist. i ordered a large. the top was perfect, but that skirt is a no go. but it looks exactly like the picture which is good. kind of cheap quality though."
2.0,These shoes are so cute and I got many compliments on them.  I ordered them despite other reviewers mentioning the loss of spikes.  I thought maybe they were rough on them or careless.  The first time I wore these shoes I lost 2 spikes on the bottom row.  The second and third times I wore them I lost even more.  I was so disappointed
2.0,Itchy material. Not easy for diaper changes.
2.0,Muy delgado y sencillo. Existen mejores opciones
2.0,"VERY limited style uses, won't apply to most sunglasses because they curve."
2.0,"pretty cheap, something you wouldn't care if you lost."
2.0,They were sent to my 22yr old grandson...he said they seem to be ones for a female...he didn't like they....however his girlfriend she liked one of them..he will give the other ones away.......
2.0,The little hearts were stainless steel but the chains were base metal with very poor base metal lobster clasps unfortunately
2.0,Had to make adjustments to make it fit
2.0,The fabric does not breathe.  Will not wear in hot weather or got strenuous exercise.
2.0,I went with the sizing chart and ordered several sizes up but it still doesn't fit right.
2.0,"Cute dress, but poor quality. I was really excited to get this dress, but I was so disappointed when I opened it. There was a button missing and the buttons that were on the dress were off."
2.0,"I'm returning this hat - the hat is cute but once it sits on your head it loses all appeal. The brim is too wide and floppy, it's hard to see unless you're looking down at something."
2.0,I have very very sensitive skin to different things including metals. My skin is ok with authentic precious metals but these made my ears swell after wearing them for not even 30 minutes. They are cute though but should probably be avoided if you have sensitive skin.
2.0,"I got an XL in these jeans thinking they would fit like my other jeans and they are too small. But that's ok because I am trying to lose weight, then they will fit."
2.0,I got these in my son’s favorite color to use as a mask but they are too tight on him (he’s 11) to wear comfortably for very long. They are stretchy but cling tight to the face and squish your nose. They are also very thin and your breath goes right through. I am keeping For me to use as a headband or whatever but not useful for a mask.
2.0,Crack line in the glasses I will return it back for refund.
2.0,Nice mask. However 30 minutes of wearing it the strap disconnected from mask and could not be worn until fixed.
2.0,I’m 5’1 and 112lbs and ordered a medium. the torso part of the body suit was extremely long and created a sagging front and back. I could go smaller because i was only barely able to get the body suit over my not-so-big hips. Had to contact the supplier for a refund.
2.0,The slippers seemed too small initially but after a few days of wear they were uncomfortably large. It seems the memory foam remembers to compress but does not remember to expand. Walking up and down stairs can be treacherous without deliberate toe-clenching and a cautious shuffle  is needed even on floors. Wouldn't get these again.
2.0,"I'm super bummed. I have been waiting on these necklaces. I bought two, one gold an one silver. The gold does not look the same color as my real gold jewelry. It's too yellow, and I don't like how crazy shiny it is because it looks fake.  The pendant is too big too. I should have read better about the size. ☹️ Many people wouldn't have a real diamond that big on their chain, so that makes it look fake too. The silver one has the same issues. A funny, too shiny color and the pendant is too big. I'm so disappointed. I do like how the chain is adjustable though."
2.0,I almost lost my watch a few time cuz they disconnected n fell off!
2.0,"Cute, but doesn’t hold it’s shape, bends really easy. Also it runs  really big, even on my middle finger, which is a size 8. Can’t adjust it any smaller without making it work really weird."
2.0,The shirt claims to be a cotton blend. If there is any cotton in this shirt it is like 1%. Not airy or breathable. Fabric feels like Lycra or spandex. Feels nothing like cotton. I’ll still wear it but I’m super disappointed.
2.0,Color was not what expected.  Not light pink
2.0,I'm 5'4 and you can see my butt in this skirt! I love the style but it just doesn't work out. I'm not even that long. I can't return it so I just wear shorts under it.  The straps aren't very long either so it comes up right under my bust with no room to spare.
2.0,"This bracelet was pretty, if a little big for my tiny wrist. Not so big that it would fall off, but I wish it had more adjustment options. The reason for the two stars is that after a day of wear (and I didn't do anything to account for this), it was gone... vanished. That sucks because, unlike so many other reviewers, I DIDN'T get mine for free and one day of wear certainly wasn't worth $20. Bye, bracelet. Very disappointing."
2.0,I am 5'10 and I have a medium sized head or slightly above medium for some hats but anyway the medium was always to fit regardless. But i can't even get this hat to come fully down on my head. It's way to small for an average man. My guess is this is mainly for woman or small children.
2.0,"Cute, but tore after a few wears."
2.0,Was smaller on arrival than size ordered.
2.0,This dress had a design I love but it was rough and hurt my skin. Felt like a potato sack.
2.0,"This shirt falls apart. While I was wearing it , it was pulling. Definitely stinks because it’s actually a super cute shirt that’s light weight . Fit was super cute. Bummed 😭"
2.0,"I didn't like how the pattern looked. At all. It seemed more, i don't know, subtle in the picture. The flowers in the pictures don't appear as bright and giant as they do on the actual skirt.<br /><br />And how did I use it this review asks. As I waited too long to return it, the skirt is just sitting in the amazon packaging taunting me about wasting money again with prime, because it has made it too easy to order things."
2.0,In the picture it shows it to be a bright yellow. It is more of a mustard colored sock. Disappointed I needed a bright yellow for a costume. One good thing is it arrived earlier than expected.
2.0,"So, the seams are clearly visible from the pictures online. What I failed to consider was how, with a product that is designed to fit tight, the seams would dig into my skin. The product looks pretty durable, and didn't ride up during the short time I'd worn them, but I couldn't wear them beyond a couple hours. I will never order any ""seamed"" undies again. There are so many other seamless options available."
2.0,The large wasn't big enough for a size 11.5 foot. So not working for me.
2.0,it just smells very bad like chemical plastic. Ive purchased other masks before and this one smells 20x stronger like it was in a warehouse for years or something. I had to open all the windows and spray febreeze ans put the mask in a diff room it still smells strong
2.0,"Very pretty, but quality is not very good.  After first wear, beads started falling off and sequin cane unseen."
2.0,it uraveled.
2.0,Looks a little greenish
2.0,Bought a small and Im usually a S/M and definitely needed and XS or XXS. The graffics were tackier than you could tell in the photo. Its cheap but they wouldn't offer a return/exchange so they refunded me a couple dollars and let me keep the suit... I gifted it to someone in need.
2.0,The color is different from the one posted.
2.0,It's pretty but extremely sheer!
2.0,I wasn’t impressed with this.  Didn’t work well.  I’m not large busted.  I wanted to try these and didn’t stay in place. Disappointed
2.0,"I had high hopes for this cute suit. But, I am 5'1&#34; and this suit was much too short for my torso. The sizing is very odd. Quality was good for the price but unfortunately I had to return it."
2.0,i ordered these earring and was disappointed with them.  It was my fault as they had the dimensions listed.  Not my style at all.
2.0,"3 out of the 5 masks had the metal piece that goes across your nose at the bottom of the mask, by the chin. I ordered these masks because of the cool graphics and also for the metal nose piece. I can't wear those 3 masks with my glasses. Disappointing"
2.0,I have had these for less than a year and the threading is coming undone.
2.0,"The shoes were very cute, and they fit well. However, after three days the paint started flaking off. Not good when you have a one year old putting everything in his mouth! Spend a little more money for higher quality shoes."
2.0,Casual wear.  It doesn’t look good on me.  Too large.
2.0,Did not like the fabric.
2.0,"This watch came within a few days.  I was a beautiful watch, but within a month, the abalone stated to fall off and the back of the watch came off. Dissapointing."
2.0,"Should have listened. I wanted these as &#34;place holder&#34; earrings.<br />Yes these are shorter posts than normal (see pic foe comparison), so why aren't they listed as children size?<br />Unless you like the ball embedded in your flesh look, the included backs don't cut it (fell off 2x), plus shaped to make them extra difficult to put on the stumpy posts.<br />Finally got replacement silicon backs which were way easier to put on and earring haven't come off once in weeks."
2.0,"These lenses are advertised as being replacement lenses for the Revo Guide S. From a shape perspective, they seem to fit the bill. However, the product picture on Amazon (pic of lenses side by side against white background) shows them as having the uniform light blue/ice blue color that the original Revo lenses have. In reality, the lenses have a blue-green reflection with purple reflection around the edges, and don't really look much like the originals. I have bought them strictly because in the ad pics they looked like the originals. I attached pics of the actual Revo glasses and these lenses next to each-other. The lenses also have a very different look while looking through them. The original Revo lenses have a more neutral tone to them, while these have a very heavy yellow tint to them, completely altering the color spectrum and making everything look very yellow. For look-through pics, original Revo lenses are on the bottom, this product on top. The difference is rather stark. So if you're hoping to get lenses that look the same as the originals both from the outside and while looking through them, look elsewhere."
2.0,"I saw some reviews about how people wear them ice fishing or during their construction jobs. I figured that theyd be perfect for me. Those people would make great actors cause they had me believing it. Or maybe their version of ""construction"" and ""ice fishing is different from mine. No way this thin piece of junk is water proof or durable. They'll only be good for wearing under bibs or lounging around the house"
2.0,"These socks look like crew socks in the photo, but they are much shorter. They are even smaller after washing. I thought I was getting a thin sock for boots, but they are NOT boot socks. They don't squeeze or anything, but I'm very disappointed nonetheless."
2.0,When the items came I was expecting a little bit more than plastic jewelry. But it served its purpose.
2.0,Pearls are timeless and you can't go wrong for the office or a night out.  These freshwater cultured pearl earrings are a great bargain. My only complaint is that the posts are thicker than other dangly earrings and they are a bit uncomfortable and I worry they may stretch out my piercing with repeated use.  I have never seen other earrings with posts like these.  If you are in the market for pearl earrings I recommend shopping around to make sure you won't mess up your piercing with the larger post.
2.0,Bought for the gym but the fabric is hot even though it’s thin. For the price it’s not bad but I bought this shirt bc of how it fit the model and went up a size (M) based on reviews. The model wears this crop as a loose slight boxy fit. This shirt is actually skin tight and semi sheer if that’s what you’re looking for but I wasn’t. I’m 5’7” 125lb and 32dd for reference. I bought a medium but I’m usually a small. Will be returning.
2.0,"Comfortable. Fits. Looks good.<br /><br />But after wearing it one time, however, I noticed a number of loose threads and fray points, especially around the buttonholes and in the collar.  It's possible I just got a dud, so I'm considering ordering another if I can get this return to go through."
2.0,Shrunk ALOT when washed
2.0,It only looks good from the pic but it actually looks cheap
2.0,"Very hot, not comfortable like the old style."
2.0,"Bought this as a Christmas gift and am too embarrassed to actually give it to the person I bought it for. The &#34;chain&#34; is made of super cheap plastic and the pendant looks just as cheap though it is metal. The tiny bead does glow in the dark and looks neat which is the only reason this didn't get a one star rating. Also, I was ripped off because I paid 6.99 for this on Cyber Monday and it's now 3 dollars. I don't recommend buying this even at $3."
2.0,"I love this sweater, but I'm extremely disappointed. I thought it was odd that it had no tags but at first glance it looked ok. I got to work this morning and my co worker pointed out two large grease stains just below the collar. I look sloppy and I'm stuck in it all day. Since I'm wearing it I dont believe I can return it. I will try to get the stains out, but I shouldn't have to pay full price for a damaged item that I have to fix. Amazon did not inspect this item closely when the last person returned it, obviously worn."
2.0,make sure parents you order 1 sz up these coco pjs runs small and tight my tot is 4 yrs and the 5t was too small sz up to a 6t instead or 7t
2.0,Basic quality. Elastic waist band; no draw string or button. I bought XL; have a 38” waist. Found the bottoms too tight.
2.0,The band's are almost impossible to remove without pliers
2.0,"After seeing so many good reviews, I was really disappointed by the quality. One of the ankle seams was totally unfinished (they didn't sew all the way around) and the inner leg seams were unraveling.  It's too bad, because I really liked the color (it's more of a &#34;wine&#34; than &#34;raisin&#34;) and the fit."
2.0,"Very disappointed with my purchase of this Hotouch dress. I have bought this brand and style for many years in many different colors, and absolutely loved the heavier fabric that was not see-through or cheap looking. Though the fabric was a heavier weight, it still draped well and seemed like a much higher quality dress than the price would indicate. Evidently Hotouch has now changed the fabric now to that of a cheap t-shirt, and made the cut skimpier.  It’s maybe OK in the black/darker colors, and the style is still lovely, which is why I’m giving two stars.  I tried the lilac and misty rose, and both were very thin and cheap looking, and cut much more skimpily, showing everything underneath.  I’m sad that Hotouch decided to change what was a really great dress, hope they will reconsider and start making this great style again in a better fabric."
2.0,"Infant onesie material, very thin material, fine ribbed. Ok if that's what you want, but it will stretch out on my daughter. I posted a pic of I side by side with a fruit of the loom XS sz 4. Fruit of the loom on left, this shirt on right"
2.0,I figured after a few washes these pants (which are made and shaped fine) would become softer and stop having a distinct gasoline smell. No dice. They are being returned.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:94240f507bcc87da0943bfc89231368a]] I bought these to bling out a pair of black Crocs. They are kinda big but oh well.
2.0,shoddy workmanship.  even the XL is somewhat small for a USA M/L.
2.0,I ordered my size. It's best for petite ladies not average or slim ladies
2.0,"Not good quality, but the price says it all"
2.0,Just too brittle. I've had other cheap glasses that lasted years! This one only months. The frame broke on top other the lens for no reason. Very low quality. Would not recommend.
2.0,"Really love the design, but the tabs that attach the band to the fitbit are too small and even the slightest pressure pulls them right off.  Can't wear it, so I will be unfortunately returning."
2.0,Is not what I was expected
2.0,The glasses fit over fine but they are not high quality and could be purchased at the local miscellaneous store for less $ and no shipping.
2.0,"I didn't like the material , it's very rough!  Too Small  I ordered a 3XL  looks like a 1XL  couldn't even get it on !! Return postage not paid!"
2.0,"The description states Gold this dress is more Pink maybe rose gold definitely not Gold, pretty but I need a Gold Dress"
2.0,"My son still wears these, as they're soft and comfy, but the ""Batman"" writing on them washed off in the first few washes after we bought them."
2.0,"I purchased this case in hopes of salvaging or prolonging the life of my cracked screen.  I put it on and the side buttons would not press... i even had my boyfriend try to confirm that i wasn't being a sissy. They wouldn't press for him either.  So in the VERY DIFFICULT process of getting the case off of my phone my cracked screen was completely finished off. Not a good day. The case itself is ok, the film that covers the screen does not fit snug so there's a void between i also didn't care for."
2.0,sizing way off buy at least 2 sizes bigger
2.0,"Looked at the size guide and Amazon recommendations and it was still too small. Now that I have to return it the vendor is having me jump through HOOPS to get my money back. No free returns, I have to write on the package the return number and all this extra stuff and the answer is still maybe I will get a full refund. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. NOT WORTH IT!"
2.0,Our daughter loved this but it fell out of her ear very quickly. Can not recommend
2.0,Worn only once. Went out for the night and realized an hour after i got there that the bottom oval had come off.
2.0,Hoodie is thin polyester or something. The picture on the hoodie and pants look and feel like the cheap iron on ones you can do at home. I expect it will crack and fall off after the first couple washes. Super generic.
2.0,Not true to the size listed. I was very disappointed!<br />I had to give it away.
2.0,"[Update] After a few washes (four?) they are falling apart. Very poor quality.<br /><br />The Large size and I expected these to be a &#34;snug large&#34; so this fits as *I* expected. These are nice breathable material which is great in the hot high humidity climate I live in. The 36-38&#34; waist fits as a 34&#34;-36&#34; which is what I expected based on the product description and an educated guess. I expected bargain gym clothes fit and features.  For this fit, I would usually have to choose &#34;premium gym clothes&#34; and spend twice as much but would also expect more durability.<br /><br />On fit:<br />I have 25&#34; thighs with a 34&#34;-35&#34; waist meaning I usually have to compromise on fit with off the rack clothes. If you have some of these same problems these shorts are a good choice for a fit you can't usually find in stores.<br /><br />Materials:<br />These shorts are an odd mix and smell of ammonia until washed the first time. The three pockets have a faux leather (feels like a plastic) band at their tops. The waist band is cotton. The rest is breathable &#34;gym clothes&#34; Polyester/Cotton blends of different patterns. The metal aglets are also an odd choice, they clack together noisily. I've decided to wash these in cold and line-dry since I'm concerned over durability due to this odd combination of materials.<br /><br />NOTE:<br />Oddly, the rear pocket was sewn shut like an expensive suit's pocket is. I had to remove the extra stitch holding it closed. The pocket works fine for holding my cellphone or wallet when running errands before the gym.<br /><br />I also ordered the 36-38&#34; (aka US Large) as I usually don't expect to comfortably wear a 32-34&#34; (aka US Medium) in the gym when performing full range of motion exercises. I may order the Medium to compare fit since these are quite flexible and very comfortable and I am overall pleased with the purchase at the lower price point."
2.0,"Nice dress but the arm holes are too small, you can barely move your arms without them being squeezed. I am a size S in everything and this was toooo small!"
2.0,I loved it and so did my daughter but it was damaged in the shipment.
2.0,It does look cheaper than the image shown.
2.0,Bought these as I love to wear camisoles and tanks under clothes. These came and they definitely were thin and larger than I expected. From other comments I expected this to run small but in fact it ran a bit bigger in my case. I'm rather tall as well and have a long torso so they could have been a bit longer as well.
2.0,"So, I ordered black and got red. And there’s some sharp edges that I sanded down, but other than that, I think it fit fine. I was actually rather surprised, though I suppose I have a narrow face. Word to the wise, you’ll want to cushion the nose piece for comfort. I’m not worried about the color, a few layers of spray paint and it’ll be fine. That being said, overall I liked it. Plus, painting it gives me an excuse to be a bit more creative with the final look anyway"
2.0,"Its great material. However the bottom, supposedly a medium is very very big.."
2.0,"I do love the fit and style of this pant, and the material would be cool for summer, however, the quality is lacking. after wearing them once and washing them, I got them out today to wear them for only the second time to find there is a 2 inch hole along the inner seam where the seam has separated or one side has pulled away because it wasn’t sewn right. Because I’m outside my 30 day window, it seems I can’t return or exchange.  That’s a real disappointment to only get to wear a pant once before it fell apart. I have this pant in a larger size and I’ve worn them 4-5 time without issue, so maybe it’s not an issue with all pants."
2.0,The hat was nice just a very small fit more for toddler than youth especially if they have a lot of hair!! Had to return was to small for my granddaughter only 6 years old!!
2.0,The packaging costs more than the belt.
2.0,"I have only had the bag since May 22, 3018. I looked a at lot of bags before my purschase. All I wanted was something that looked good and could hold my laptop and other things for work. Within the first two weeks the shoulder strap broke and the zipper is very cheap, it will barely zip up, not sturdy at all. Disappointed with my $70.00 purchase."
2.0,Not what I expected.  Looks and feels cheap.
2.0,fast ship but shape of glasses looks terrible on the face and also the bi-focals not accurate at all too weak.
2.0,Eh doesn't fit very well. Might just be my teeth though.
2.0,to small in the top and to big in the bottom
2.0,"Very loose in the front but tight in the arm/shoulder area when you try to lift your arms.  If I had to go out for a short time and not move much it might be ok but definitely not something I could wear for very long.  My bra shows in the front with any movement and I cannot lift my arms more than half way, not very practical."
2.0,"Not sojos, the mirror is very cheap plastic that you can see right through."
2.0,"Item was not black, as pictured, but gray."
2.0,Feel like I'm going to break it every time I move it too hard.
2.0,"Does not look like the picture, dissapointed"
2.0,It's built cheap but you get what you pay for
2.0,"I really like these yoga pants and have them in several colors. However, after only a month, there is a hole in the crotch area."
2.0,"Beautiful earrings, they look like solid gold and are priced lower than many pieces of costume jewelry.<br />The stones are clear and perfectly matched.<br /><br />UPDATE January 5 2018 :<br /> Initially I had given these earrings 5 stars, I really really liked them and as you see by the review I was impressed by the quality.I stored the in their original pouch in a jewelry box.<br />When I open the pouch to wear them I was surprised to find the earring badly tarnished in fact black.I<br /> This earring state that they are gold plated, in my ignorance I didn't realized that this is not guarantee about tarnish. All the same a pair of new never wore earrings should not get this color,I have pieces of custom gold that look better than this.<br /> Cleaning it has not gave good results, and I try all recommended methods for gold plated Jewelry.<br />Sadly I will never wear these,"
2.0,"I like the integrated D-ring and the quick release buckle. But I would have preferred a heavier duty webbing. I'm not even using it as a gun belt, but if I squat down the back middle part of the belt folds almost all the way over going through the belt loop. I can live with that though at the price. The much more obvious flaw is that the coating started chipping off after only a few weeks, and it is not just scratches, but actually chips of black coming loose. I am not hard on it at all (I am an engineering student, so not much of a rugged life) There is a chance that mine was just defective and others do not chip as badly as mine did, but as it stands I would not recommend buying this if you don't want an extremely chipped buckle in a few months."
2.0,Great colors but didn't fit right!
2.0,"Okay boot , after a while they wrinkled at the ankle which hurt kids ankles .  the liner pulls out and irritates son . Will not purchase again ."
2.0,"I ordered a size up from what I normally wear.<br />They are small, very cheaply made. ""It is not so much they are too small the shape of them is not right the butt is lower then the front and you can't pull them up.<br />I wear them around the house or on quick errands or my behind gets revealed lol.<br />I did not send it back because it would have cost me more then it was worth.<br />These are definitely not plus size.<br />Probably made in China where they enjoy the benefit of not being plus size.<br />Be careful ordering from here regarding the size.<br />My stars are for the seller they are good product not so much.<br />Price was good shipping was perfect."
2.0,"I am a newly wed and my fiancé bought this ring for me before we were married. I wore this ring for about 2 days after we got married. In those two days it got scratched up, it was a work of art but now not so much. In comparison I bought another Ti ring (one with beveled edges). Not only has it not scratched but it is also way more comfortable."
2.0,The hinge broke after 4 and 6 weeks for the two pair I purchased. I loved the fit and style though when they were not broken.  They found the garbage can way too fast.
2.0,"After everyone saying they were &#34;way too big&#34; I got excited as I thought this was exactly what I needed. Was looking for those comically oversized glasses people always seem to have at mardi gras/parties. I'm a grown adult and was planning on wearing these over a horsehead mask to be a hipster horse (long story.) Anyway, not only would these not fit over the mask, these wouldn't even fit on my face! They really need a model wearing these to give you an accurate portrayal of size.<br /><br />It's so tight its excruciating. If you're a tiny babby child then these are probably perfect for you, but as an adult, they're like small reading glasses clamped onto the side of your head with a vice.<br /><br />NOT great for a halloween costume. Very upset but it was only 4 dollars so it's not even worth returning honestly."
2.0,awkward fit - couldn't tell where the pockets should go - :(
2.0,Not same colour as pictured<br />Brighter<br />Not a very good quality
2.0,Broke after first try
2.0,4 months in and the watch is broken.
2.0,"The fit on the breasts was good (I'm a 38DD) and the bras passed the jumping-jacks test, but I think I completed my cardio activity and stretching for the day just trying to get it on and clasped correctly! I'm returning in favor of a sports bra that is easier to get on and off. I don't need any additional resistance to getting my sweat on!"
2.0,Not what I wanted I was looking for cotton racerback tanks.
2.0,Very pretty when comes out of the box ..but 2 weeks later its completely tarnished.not worth the price
2.0,"Very thin chain, it kinks easily, and my hair gets caught in the clasp all the time."
2.0,To big/bulky for me. The outer plastic it's very flimsy and extremely difficult to remove once put on. It's a nice case just not for me.
2.0,This dress runs so small it is like a doll's dress.  I actually ordered up TWO SIZES based on earlier reviews.  Really cute but I had to return
2.0,"My poor review is re: quality assurance. I tried the outfit on and was satisfied with the fit and length UNTIL I tried to button the sleeves. Someone sewed the buttons on the right cuff on the wrong side and I can't button the sleeve And obviously, no one cared or caught it before  shipping.  The buttons are not the kinds that I can remove and sew on myself (nor should I have to find matching thread and time to correct what should have been corrected before shipping.) This is for our Luau party in three days so return and replacement will be too late.  See the attached pics showing both sleeve to see that one sleeve has buttons on the wrong side."
2.0,"Not cute in person.  Very low quality with four seams.  It doesn’t matter what way you wore it cause there was a seam on the sides and one in the front and back vertically.  The top fabric was very cheap.  The bottom slip was also very cheap.  Created lots of static.  If you’re curvy, this just makes you look wider.  I returned mine unfortunately."
2.0,Poor size correlation
2.0,"See the slight opportunity for exposed side boob on the model? It's real. The incut was way too large and too low for me, my boobs kept trying to escape sideways, and side boob pretending to be back fat is not a good look in my opinion. Shame because I like the rest of the style, and the color is just *swoon*"
2.0,"didn't like the fabric or the cut.  too short, nothing flowy about it, really.  would have returned it but shipping wasn't free."
2.0,It's beautiful but not true to size! 😫😫
2.0,The materials and fitting are perfect however I m very disappointed that the vortex logo is not centered. It s a bit off to left.
2.0,"The description says ""unisex"", but the shirt is too short for a man. It also says the length measures 30"" for an XL, but mine only measures 27"". otherwise, it is a nice shirt. I bought this for my son, but I will keep this for myself."
2.0,It was weird fit . One side of leg was loose and other side was super tight . Not at all a proper stitch
2.0,"This is the best and worst bra. It fits beautifully, feels great, but the padding shifts as you wear it. Not good. I would buy again because of the comfort, but it's poorly engineered."
2.0,THE SIZE WAS NOT TRUE TO SIZE
2.0,They would be great if they were a Tad bit thicker because a lot of the pairs I've worn get a hole in the big toe area where the little plastic thing that holds them all together was.
2.0,"This is a backpack just for one day or one trip, after a hiking trail trip the backpack it gets a hole, And several strips were released.<br /><br />is good for the price, the quality is ok, but I don't like it. I would buy another one from a different brand or type."
2.0,It looked like a warmer hat from the pictures but it is a good size fall hat.
2.0,DId not fit as expected and wasn't well made
2.0,.Holes in fingertips and thumbs after one month and I have very short finger nails.
2.0,"Texture and color are fine, but not super durable. This one lasted maybe a month of regular use. The band broke around the pin too easily.  It's not super pricey, but also not really built to hold up."
2.0,"You need to provide a sizing process in order to ensure a more accurate size.  I ordered the large size and it was way too small.  I game the gloves to my sister-n-law and they fit her.  I am debating whether to order the extra large size.  I am guessing it will be OK but again, the sizing is a real issue.  Maybe their hand model had small hands..."
2.0,"Flimsy material and loose stitching.  Hard to tighten if your head is smaller than the bonnets set size.  Pretty pattern and material.  Not super usable.  And don’t think it will last long.  If it lasts longer than 5 months, I’ll update."
2.0,"No tiene push up! No tire aro. No sujeta el busto, lo hace ver aplastado. Es para personas mayores que no tienen interés  en verse bien. Sólo  le quedaría bien a las personas que tienen  hecho  el busto,como la modelo."
2.0,They didn't fit.
2.0,The chain broke off several of them.
2.0,Doesn't stsy on ear.
2.0,White second layer of cloth is white and gets dirty fast.  Two cloths makes it hard to breath.  Also there is a smell to cloth when you first open it up.
2.0,Too small and arrived to late.
2.0,"This skirt was much shorter than expected, but otherwise just fine. I returned it because I don't wear my skirts this short."
2.0,"Pros: nice, soft material. Very comfortable feel. Dress made really well/good quality. Dress was returned and refunded no issues.<br /><br />Cons: based on measurements I should be a medium, however it was way too tight, and too small (length given was not accurate to actually length). Got a large and it was much too baggy, even though the measurements listed are supposedly only a tiny bit bigger than the medium. The “flare” shape of the dress is too much, I don’t know why they didn’t just make it a typical loose sheath/T-shirt style dress. And probably the saddest con, the colors are way off. I got the “Blue gray Pink” color and in actuality it’s a dark lake blue with dark TEAL stripes and orange red stripes. No gray or pink to be found like in the picture. It made for an overall dull and ugly dress. Really disappointed with this :(("
2.0,Ordered for a Christmas gift it was too small I had to return the item.  When it arrived it did not have tags and looked in used condition for the price was not impressed.
2.0,The fit was too small in the bust and arm area.  It will need to be returned.
2.0,Let me start off by saying I love this dress it’s beautiful the fabric high quality And I was very excited when I receive this dress But unfortunately when I tried the dress on I noticed it wasn’t quite fitting right and that’s because the straps are two different sizes which was very disappointing I have a wedding coming up this weekend that I planned on wearing this to but unfortunately I won’t be able to get my refund in time to re-order this dress.<br />I would definitely recommend buying this dress Just make sure you have plenty of time to exchange if need be.<br />Also I got a large and I’m 5’5” 168lb and other than the straps it fit perfect:)
2.0,Beautiful  bras but didn't  fit.
2.0,"Returning. I don't need saggy plastic pants.<br />The faux leather is not convincing. The fabric looks like a cross between spandex and plastic. Nobody will be mistaking this for leather unless they have serious vision problems. LOL. Material felt itchy, especially along the inner seams.<br />The Medium sags on my 5'4&#34; 145lb body which normally needs medium or large bottoms. Not baggy, but saggy. Not too loose for regular pants, but not tight enough for tights and not snug enough to be form fitting. I would need to constantly yank these up if I kept them.<br />I would've tried to reorder in Small, but those itchy, prickly seams can only feel worse if they pressed closer."
2.0,This is the second pair I have tried from aoxjox. And im very disappointed. I'm 5'5 145 . I ordered a medium. The waist.come up to my boobs. And they're still extra fabric in the legs. The inner thighs had pulling in the stitching before I even tried them on<br /> And they're sheer. I keep seeing great reviews for these. And I LOVE AOXJOX shorts. But  Are awful. Way too ling sheer. And damaged upon arrival. Can't wear.
2.0,The description said they are infused with copper... that was a lie
2.0,Product looked as expected. It was perfect for a long weekend of travel. The only issue is that one of the zippers broke on the first day. At least it was a double zipper so I can still use it but disappointed it broke so quickly. Fearful of using again because I am sure the other zipper will break
2.0,"The picture is miss leading. It's a crop top in the font, not long like the back. Disappointing"
2.0,"The skirt smells of fish, I’m airing it out to see if the smell fades. The skirt is gigantic. I do wear a medium in juniors, express, banana republic size 3/4-5/6<br />I have skin around my stomach from kids so my pant size generally will fluctuate<br />I do have a curvy body and am 5’2” 125lbs<br />The skirt band runs too high as well but can be tucked in but it does not conform at all. I should have gotten an xs....... i would say four inches from the band needs to be taken in two inches from the hip area  and the lower portion needs to be pulled in by 6 inches only on the back lower portion of the skirt and two inches off the top<br />This is if you normally wear a fitted medium top normally ie target plain black long sleeve t or t shirt and missing slacks 3/4  Macy’s cube dresses at a medium"
2.0,"Very small braclet, too tight gave to grand-daughter."
2.0,"works great, but the seams are not elastic at all.....i can feel them pop everytime i use them"
2.0,You get what you pay for...an I didnt pay much so they came with stones missing
2.0,"Very narrow glasses , not at all oversized as the product states.  Sadley dissatisfied"
2.0,"I was confused when I purchased this, because of the picture I thought I was ordering the long cap. I didn't realize there were different sizes.<br />The cap I did receive was just way to small and tight for me"
2.0,"The tie clip showed up a day after the wedding I was going to and it was of poor quality. Has some weird looking marks, almost like it is oxidized or something. Not going to return it because it was only $7, but buyer beware. Cheap stuff. Spend the extra few bucks and buy a better one."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress. I'm a true size 4 and I usually run between a women's small and a medium. After reading the reviews, I down sized to an extra small and it was still 2 sizes too big. I also wish it had belt loops so that you could maybe salvage it and give your waist some shape. Unfortunately, I had to return it."
2.0,This mask are so thin and itchy is unbelievable. They are huge on the face. A plus is you get a lot of masks for the value but i def wouldn't buy them again or recommended them. They left my face super itchy (even after washing) and it felt like it was burning at times.
2.0,I am 5’8 and it was way too short. When I put it on I either have it buttoned and then the boob area is pulled down or unbuttoned and it doesn’t fit my boobs right. I always have a hard time with body suits because I have a longer torso and I was very disappointed with this one. It has potential but if you’re taller save yourself money.
2.0,It was massive .. and not right enough in my wrist
2.0,Received promptly. Same as site pic. However; was received defective-either dead battery or other. Returned same day as received.
2.0,Very very small more like for a doll or pictures.  Granddaughter uses it for her dolls.
2.0,So itchy! The bag is large. And cute. But thin material and so rough... A little disappointed that none of the other reviews coved this!
2.0,"So first of all it took forever to get here! Then when i finally did got it, i saw it and it looked nothing like the one on the picture. The one on the picture looks thick and the one i got is super THIN. oh well.."
2.0,Fell apart the first time I wore it. I was giving a presentation at a conference for my college work and then I noticed that my pants were ripped and the inside of the sleeve of the jacket was ripped as well. I don't know if it was just a bad one or all the suits are like this but for it to rip within hours of my wearing it at a conference is disappointing.
2.0,This dress is really beautiful !  The problem I had with this dress is that the opening on the leg is way to high  to the point my underwear was showing.
2.0,the necklace was very pretty except for the missing stones. missing stones were not in the package.
2.0,Jewel popped off first time it was worn. Will try reattaching when I can get some craft  glue. We'll see.
2.0,"I ordered a 3x, my usual size, & was way too small. My daughter is  MT at ON & if fit her like a large."
2.0,"FRAME TO SMALL, HOWEVER WILL BE OK AS A SPARE"
2.0,The magnet was way to powerful. It hurt to keep in more then 10min.
2.0,Super cute! It's really long though but it's durable and looks really fashionable!<br /><br />Update: broke after couple of days.
2.0,Cute on but very cheaply made!
2.0,The print is really good. The inside of the mask is so loose the it goes inside your mouth too easily. Very aggravating fit
2.0,"I was really hoping that this would work out... nope. I am petite, 5'3, 115 lbs. I ordered the medium and it was WAY to small still. Not for longer torsos, that's for sure. I returned and was going to reorder but decided against it because I wasn't sure if the rest of the outfit would fit correctly."
2.0,The smell is so strong I only used it once.
2.0,looks pretty in the picture but the hat is too big. does not fit well..
2.0,"I really wanted to love this product, it fit so nicely. The material was thick and it runs small but the medium fit me well (5'2"", 117lb, 32C) However, when I received the item, the stitching was ripped where the mesh met the other fabric on the back. I tried to contact the seller to see if they could replace the item, but I received no response.<br />I liked the shirt enough to return the old one and reorder, and I will hope the new product I receive is in better condition. Beware of the poor customer service, but if you have Amazon Prime the return and rebuy is easy enough."
2.0,Large.<br />Runs small<br />Will order a 2x nexts time.<br />Had to make a hole for my button to go in.
2.0,So very small. It would be perfect for my pre-teen granddaughters. Very unhappy.
2.0,They hurt my nose and they were very thick but for the price It was okay.
2.0,I found that the sizing ran very large. I was unable to wear the dress for this reason.
2.0,"We did not like the quality of the material, was thin and cheaply made. The threads were visible at all seams. I would not recommend"
2.0,It's cute but cheaply made. Not good quality. I was very disappointed.
2.0,Super cute but didn't work for me
2.0,They weren't as pretty as I expected
2.0,Was good for one week the. The shoe twisted and hurts my feet out of no where
2.0,I ordered a large but should have ordered an X-L because the top part was super tight. The top material is very stiff & not soft at all. I also don’t think the shade of pink in the top went well with the colors in the flower material. The pockets were my favorite feature. I’ll be returning for a refund.
2.0,"These are really small to be L/XL. Truly disappointed in the graphics... When they stretch out on you leg, they get distorted.  I'm so disappointed.  I was really looking forward to wearing these!"
2.0,Zipper is screwed up after two weeks of wear and very annoying. Won't order from this company again.
2.0,"It was nice. It was flexible, light, felt good. I liked the guitar. But the clasp is junk. It fell off me a few days ago. I pinched the clasp to make it hold better. But, I just noticed I don't have it on anymore, so I'm going to say I don't recommend this to others.<br />Delivered on March 26th - fell off somewhere April 2nd. Lasted 7 days."
2.0,They looked awesome when we got them but after 1 wash they are now faded and look several washes old. Disappointed
2.0,"Shoe is really a dark gold. I use for lounging around house, but the shoe is a bit heavy and not breathable."
2.0,Ehh not the cutest ever I guess. Kinda of reminds me of a turban style. Prob better for 2-6months
2.0,Ball stripped fell off very pretty but disappointed
2.0,Ordered a 3X thinking it was probably going to run small (I wear an XL) and it was too small even after ordering it twice my normal size. It fits perfectly on my friend who is a medium.
2.0,"Very cute but not great quality. Very thin fabric, small calf."
2.0,I love this look and am very disappointed that it was too small. :(
2.0,The shirt fit is fine. But the blue is lighter than pictured and the graphic is larger than it looks In The picture. So it looks stretched and weird looking ( especially if your chest is a bit larger)<br />I not a big fan of this shirt but will keep it because it is soft and fits.
2.0,"Awesome gloves but normally you get a left AND a right...since I got these for Halloween and I was a creepy clown, I just turned the extra left inside out."
2.0,I really wanted to love this dress.  The print is beautiful and the fit isn't actually that bad.  The material has no give to it.  It doesn't stretch at all so it was uncomfortable.  Raising my arms causes the whole dress to go up.  I have to send it back.
2.0,Poorly made.  Returned for refund.
2.0,Wore 1 time at a Pastor's Anniversary...  Stem broke easy..  They was beautiful
2.0,"these leggings are shiny looking and are very see-through and felt cheap. they are also very scratchy, ​not soft at all."
2.0,"These are too heavy and big too use on shoelaces.  Also, in the picture they look shiny, but they are very dull.  They hang like weights on the shoelaces.  I didn't even care to return them.  I threw them away and bought another product."
2.0,Is not the right size
2.0,Don't fit proper. Feel nice. Work for casual but not for athletic movement
2.0,"cheap material, it was cute the first time i wore it after that it shrank and the color is more like purple"
2.0,Unfortunately while these are super cute they DO NOT last.  My daughter has had her pair for exactly 6 days and the bow on one boot has come unstitched and is now dangling.  I would not recommend these for a toddler/preschooler.
2.0,"Very bulky, terrible quality in the zipper."
2.0,My husband used this belt twice before a little screw popped out and the entire belt came apart. Great concept but not durable.
2.0,It looks a bit ridiculous ... I'm probably returning it. If it were half the size it would be a pretty ring. I could never wear this on a daily basis.
2.0,Nice on skin but I couldn't even breathe in this mask.
2.0,"I have purchased several pairs of Saucony running shoes, each pair a Cohesion version. This time I ordered the Phantom and realized I made a mistake. They were too narrow for my feet, especially in the front areas. I returned them. From now on I will stick to the Cohesion shoes. I have 6,7,8 and 9 and am delighted with every pair."
2.0,"I love the style of this cardigan it’s super cute, but I wish it was a little better made. It feels cheap, and after a couple washes I have a feeling it’s not gonna look great. Also snags really easy. I want to give this one a great review,  but I really can’t."
2.0,Con el primer lavado se descosturo
2.0,Colors not as pictured.
2.0,Not impressed with this hoodie at all. I thought it would have been a little thicker but in all my son liked it. It is way larger than I expected and my son is 5’7”
2.0,The worst fabric ever stiff. Washed and used fabric softener did not work
2.0,"Bought two colours of these straps; white & rose gold. Thought they were a good buy compared to the Fitbit straps. Well, the old saying is true; you get what you pay for!<br />This strap is not silicone or even a soft plastic. It’s hard, non pliable & the white  colour shows dirt terribly that I cannot get off no matter what cleaning solution I try. It’s also even more difficult than the Fitbit bands to insert into the watch.<br />Very unhappy & would not recommend!  The seller solicited a review ~ well, here it is!"
2.0,"Though it is pretty, had comfortable material inside and came at the time period expected, it was thicker than expected, which I didn't mind at first but then I had to struggle to get my hands through it I realize that the gap between the fingers were still a half inch away from my own. I don't have thick hands, they are quite small and my fingers are short. Though it was thick, my hands were still cold like I didn't have gloves on (I work in an office with AC Unit and it's quite cold all day, I needed something to warm my fingers and hands). I couldn't write in it neither could I type. Heck I couldn't even pick up the pen when it fell to the floor and it takes effort to make a fist in. Eventually I just had to give up and stuff it in my drawer. They felt more like really tight mittens than actual gloves. In my opinion, this requires very small hands. Please see attachment."
2.0,"The snapper to keep closed broke after the first use. I had given it as a gift so of course I only get the news that my gift had broke and wasn’t given the key tag holder back so I could return it...,"
2.0,"Pros:<br />Contrary to what other reviewers say, I can see out of this just fine. If you can't see through this fabric (which is roughly equivalent to pulling a stocking over your head) it's probably not stretched tight enough and you should buy a size down. If you're complaining because it's not seran-wrap-transparent then it's your expectations, not the product, which need adjustment.<br /><br />Cons:<br />All the above said, the neck on this is quite short, it's a stretch to get it to reach the shoulders. Also, it smells like someone has already put it on and smoked about a carton of cigarettes THROUGH THE MASK. It absolutely reeks and it's going to have to be laundered and febreezed before I can even wear it long enough to give it a proper review."
2.0,"I ordered this for a yacht rock event. It arrived quickly, but just didn’t work for me. The fabric was polyester and felt weird to me. I love stars, but It ended up looking like I was wearing an American flag. It just wasn’t cute on me."
2.0,The fabric was essentially spandex and the dress was way too tight. The top of the dress fit like a small and the bottom like an xxs. I ordered a medium.
2.0,Italian charms are extremely difficult to remove and change and this help a little. It was better than nothing but I did use it.
2.0,Way too small - returning
2.0,"Stitching on the velcro straps was already separating when I received the item. Shoulder straps could use more padding. Overall it works, but there are better options for a little more money."
2.0,"If you're 5'10&#34; tall, you would do better to get the plus size. They also snag easily."
2.0,It did not fit if you have a big butt don’t buy this
2.0,It is really good for a small cut. But it is very sticky and hard to use. I tried to use it on a slash in my neck and it doesn't work well
2.0,"Looks pretty, sparkles beautifully but 2 weeks wearing it and dismantled which is not hard to fix but did that once more time before the month passed and it broke on the sparkles part, you can still wear the chain which at this moment I have to fix it again because it came out of the ring but this is just a jewelry that you wear only if you have a dress and sandals because it will get stuck everywhere. Plus for the price if it does doesn’t really hit you hard if it was expensive."
2.0,These are a very nice material. It is soft and comfortable feeling. I found the sizing to be much too small even sizing up one size from my normal size.
2.0,Not that good looking
2.0,Great material. But i ordered a bigger size and they gave me a much smaller size. Now im out the money and dont have the right size! Very unprofessional.
2.0,"This shirts runs very, very small.  I purchased a 2x and it is more like a large."
2.0,Item was okay but very cheaply packaged. Advertising all over : (
2.0,"Womens sizing is so all over the place.  I ordered a small in this and it was to small, i ordered a small in a different dress and it was way to big. oh the struggles of online clothes shopping.. I sent this back."
2.0,Basically ankle socks
2.0,Too hard to stretch and don't really fit.  Don't work for me because I am not strong enough to get them on any shoes or boots.
2.0,Product was almost too small and cheaply made.
2.0,"Coat is built like a Halloween costume. Cheaply made, poor quality."
2.0,Cheap and uncomfortable. Good for costumes.
2.0,They're sized way too small.
2.0,The suit is still too big.  I didn't realize that US size and European sizes are different.  This do not work for me.  I tried twice.
2.0,"Not the must comfortable sandals. Very cute, used once and that it."
2.0,"These are absolutely nothing like what I thought they'd be. They look almost like cotton in the photo. They are not. They are a thick, scratchy material and they don't fit like the photo either. They look like old woman work pants. Ya know, the ones that are bunched at the top.<br /><br />Not what I was looking for at all."
2.0,"This is a really cute boot and the side zipper is a really nice feature .  I normally wear a size 8 and that is what I ordered, these boots were like a size 9 . There was absolutely no support in the foot bed and they were somewhat narrow.  If they would have fit and had a little more support I would have kept them however; they ended up being returned."
2.0,Previous reviews stating that you should order up are incorrect. Also size chart is completely off so it is near impossible to order the right size polo.  5'4/120lbs/28in waist and I basically floated down the Delaware in my polo shirt according to the size chart. If you have my dimensions stick with size Small do not order Medium or Large. Item is thick but looks like it would lose all form and stretch after one use even if you followed all care instructions.
2.0,Very hard to adjust the size of this band. Included tool doesn't work
2.0,"very thin and cheap material, elastic is twisted inside band, doesn't fit as described. do better :/"
2.0,Not wool. Microfiber.
2.0,fit my dad like it was for a child<br />adult lg fits younger children.
2.0,Way too big. Size 4-6 fit my adult sizes (7.5 women's) foot. Had to return.
2.0,the top was a small but the shorts were medium.  shorts were to big.
2.0,Item was not as I expected.
2.0,"I did not like the fabric, came with white mark ( maybe someone deodorant), and needed a sticky comb to clean it also.<br />Product will be return to sender."
2.0,Pants too short. I even ordered a size bigger.
2.0,Looks better on pic
2.0,"I rarely wear this bra because I hadn't realized how uncomfortable an underwire is, especially during pregnancy and this bra seems to have an underwire that is even more uncomfortable than other bras. Before pregnancy, underwire bras are the only kind of bras I wore, except a bralette for sleeping. This bra is definitely not for sleeping. In order for a nursing bra to be a good one for me, it has to be comfortable for day wear and sleep. This one did not make the cut. Also, I feel like my boobs look saggy and very sad in this bra. The only nice thing is the color is pretty and the material is soft. But as for comfort and appearance of breast form, this bra sucks. I do not recommend it.<br />Update: I pulled out the underwire and now I can actually wear it comfortably, but it still does nothing good for the shape and form. Also, the material is very thin."
2.0,"I didn't like the fabric too much, seem too &#34;weak&#34;"
2.0,"The style is cute but the material is NOT sweatshirt material. It's not soft. It is not cotton, even though the picture looks cotton. Now the description does say the correct material so READ the description. I'm convinced the pictures shown are NOT of the actual shirt you receive but a stock photo or mockup."
2.0,Very disappointed in the fitment. According to the chart with my 19 inch calf the 2x-3x should be perfect. Unfortunately I couldn’t even get them on. Had to return.
2.0,"I ordered this watch in February didn't wear it till March, cause I had to get some links taking out and now its foggy and water logged the watch still works but you cant see it. I do not recoment this watch."
2.0,"I love these shoes and got many compliments , but after wearing them less than a year and only during the summer months, the side of the sandal came unglued and fell apart."
2.0,I purchased these glasses for my daughter for Easter. They look nothing like the picture in person. The floral print is actually see through and shiny. More embedded in the glasses then printed on top. I was disappointed. The quality of the actual product seems decent. But the image is deceiving.
2.0,"These items are not flattering to wear. I tried it on once and they stay on well thanks to the elastic at the end of the each piece, but the material is loose-fitting and has a chunky look. The heel area hardly has a shape to it and the fingers look chunky. I bought these items for a burlesque costume, but they definitely do not look sexy."
2.0,These pajamas have ZERO cotton in them completely synthetic. Would have NEVER bought them if the description was ACCURATE.
2.0,"Runs extremely small I purchased an XL & it fits like a medium, too tight in the arms, waste of money & I did not read the reviews ahead of time which I should have"
2.0,"These socks are huge. They definitely show in ballet flats. They would be OK under shoes with a high vamp, though. They have very silky matetial, which is weird. Socks should have some friction to prevent slipping. these are an OK product, but they don't with for my purposes."
2.0,"would have been a cute shoe, but these ran almost an entire size too small.  Very disappointing!"
2.0,I like the big face so I can see time better. But the watch band is really Big to me it's more of a Man's watch than a ladies watch. I would recommend for a man but not for a woman.
2.0,stone fell out in a few months I took it off I bought a cheaper Pandora and it still looks good I wont buy from this seller again
2.0,"this dress is comfy and the pattern is cute, but on me (6’ tall with a larger chest), the elastic waist barely hits below my bust. I have to keep tugging it down for it to sit like an empire waist. I’m keeping it as a casual, around the house type of dress because it does actually hit at my knees, but won’t be wearing it out much of at all."
2.0,Material is very similar to lounge wear/pajamas. Returning!
2.0,"Sadly I am returning this dress. It's a beautiful dress but it's definitely made for somebody who is petite. I am 5' 8&#34; , 40DD and have a long torso and the dress hits at my rib cage not my waist. :-(  I can zip and snap the waist of the dress if it's at my waist but then I can't put the top part on. If I put the top part on I can't zip the waste because it hits at my rib cage."
2.0,The design is entirely in the front. The entire back is just hot pink.
2.0,Sooooooooooo much smaller than I thought.
2.0,"I'm not sure if these are 100% stainless steel because my ears were extremely irritated after wearing them. Might try coating posts with clear nail polish, but disappointed that I'm getting an allergic reaction to these."
2.0,Color is way off from online pic.. I wanna expecting more of a saddle leather brown and received a reddish brown pair.
2.0,"This is a cute necklace but doesn't lay straight like others reviewed and won't return once it is opened, and you can't see how it lays on you until you do so. Kind of frustrating."
2.0,"Not that soft, doesn't wash well, and when it arrived it had a really pungent smell to it."
2.0,Cute but short and not  true to<br />Size
2.0,"Most whistles are not that loud. Poor construction. Poor molding.<br />Two of the blades were used and have very obvious burn marks.<br />When closed, the blade sticks out a bit on a few buckles.<br /><br />Low quality execution, there are better options out there."
2.0,"Really cute, but way to small... super short!!! Would be great it your short and a size 0-2."
2.0,"It fit well everywhere except right in front, across the chest. It had an odd ""flappiness"" near the armpit area. I sent it back."
2.0,Not what I was expecting. Very tight around the legs and not as soft.
2.0,Nice bright red color and served its one use purpose. Huge negative was this arrived with a hole along the seam in the back. The material itself is also super thin and poor quality. I needed it for a pirate themed event so I just stapled it together since I didn't have time to return it and find something else.
2.0,There was no boxing it came in a yellow envelope poor quality not real
2.0,I bought this to wear under my helmet but it was too thin for the cold but was great quality.
2.0,I was told it had a fastener in the back like a regular bra. It does not. There is nothing to keep this in place. I will probably end up returning it. It is also discribed as being capped sleeves. That is not what a capped sleeve is.
2.0,"Way too small, way too narrow.  No way I can get these on.  Gave them to my wife who wears a US-6 medium shoe.  She likes them."
2.0,did not match any of the specifications nor photo<br />What is most important to me is that the item that I requested and ordered fits and matches all of the descriptions stated and that it looks like the photo. I was expecting a large oversized knitted long cardigan the cardigan was not even close to my knees and it was really snug. I waited more than a month to get the delivery. The color was okay but the style was not even close to the picture. The knitted design and yarn used was not the one used as the picture either. It seems that the vendor uses photos to attract for selling purposes.
2.0,"As other reviewers mentioned, these are not easy on.  They come off easily enough, but very hard to get on.  They are comfortable once on, but the claims aren't accurate."
2.0,Too large for my ears (female). Fall off allowing water to get in. Replacing with a different type.
2.0,Cheap quality.  Didn't fit well. Too small
2.0,I expected a long compression socks from the photo. Very short. Mid calf. Not what I expected
2.0,Not as beautiful as described
2.0,I don t like the fact that the sides of the glasses pull my hair so much.
2.0,"Freakishly small, ordered an XL, gave to a friend who is an XS and it fit her perfectly.  Cheaply made but was cute on her."
2.0,LARGE IS TOO SMALL
2.0,"The hot pink color is a dark purple, nothing like the picture."
2.0,I've only had the ring a few days but I wore it and quickly realized the Bat Symbol will run off quickly. Not an everyday ring.
2.0,These are large. They look so fake and gaudy. Definitely disappointed.
2.0,I thought my glasses were broke and they have a small scratch. The box was squashed. Their smaller than i thought. Look a little cheap.... Their going to my daughter...
2.0,"I bought these for my daughter, she wore them only one day and they already have a hole in the seam of the crouch of them. Not sewn very well. They look cute on her and lift as they are suppose too. But they are not sewn very well at all."
2.0,I bought this for the top. It was okay the 2 times I wore it before the hook snapped while out with friends. Wouldn't recommend.
2.0,"The 2 stars is because their customer service replies promptly … I ordered a 5/8th inch strap and decideded I wanted the 1 inch and they honored my exchange with  free shipping… but the product itself is cheaply made and I’m taking it off my purse and chalking up my loss … it’s been on my purse for 3 months and it looks like it’s been on it for 3 yrs… it’s creased, buckled ( because it’s very stiff ) and skuffed … not to mention it looks very plastic … the color is a match for my purse but that’s about it"
2.0,Not the same design as pictured (black and beige) it’s mostly black and a little white. Doesn’t hang on ear as I imagined either. The back has gold on it not the full design so that’s what you see looking forward
2.0,"I ordered these trying to find a cheaper alternative to mack weldon's, well, they are cheaper (quality and price) and not an alternative. Seems like they are good for being disposable. Giving them to thrift shop unworn, will not re-order. Shipping took a long time as they took almost 2 weeks before they even entered the US from China."
2.0,"The bag is roomy and fits all of my gym things and has a shoe compartment.<br />However one of the cloth handles on the smaller side came off without warning within 2 months,<br />and I use it very lightly.<br />It raises questions about the sturdiness of the product"
2.0,My daughter usually wore an 11 so I bought a 12 and it was too small. I also didn’t like that you have to put it together. The wires just call me in the box and I had to try to connect them to the shoe.
2.0,Nose studs. They were a lot larger in actuality than the picture
2.0,"To tight in the arms, ill fitting.  Cute but your movement is restricted."
2.0,"I was pretty disappointed with this item. The package says it fits up to an xxx large but I would say it's a large at best, my girlfriend is 5 foot 5 and she weighs about a hundred and forty pounds and she could barely get it on. It's also not as sheer as I had hoped it's probably about a 40 denier not very see-through at all. Considering how much this cost I would say there's a lot better options out there I am going to have to keep shopping."
2.0,Elastic to wear wings is VERY short. Does not fit child.
2.0,The buckle is perfect and looks appropriate for Santa. The belt leatherette is to thin and cheap. If you are going to wear it more than a couple of times the eyelets will pull through. Wearing it over fat pad for Santa shouldn’t have stressed it that much. Still it’s worth purchasing for buckle alone and attaching it to another belt.
2.0,Did not fit.  Runs too small.
2.0,chin pocket is not deep as in photo. Mask if fitted high on the nose for those of us who wear glasses so they don't fog  makes the chin pocket above the chin.  Mask very small Go with the real Tommie Copper for a better fit
2.0,"This product was not as pictured. It was actually orange/red leopard instead of beige leopard as pictured. It was helpful to air out for a time to displace the odor from the material. Otherwise it serves its purpose. I just didn't care for the color or the misrepresentation of the color. Had it been true to color, it would have worked out great."
2.0,Was a bit too large. It’s nice when it arrives but quickly wears after a couple washes.
2.0,why are women sizes so small?
2.0,Would make a nice nightgown.  Much too flimsy to wear as a dress.  I returned it.
2.0,"This is a very good brand with quality product at a reasonable price. My last peppers' sunglasses just got damaged to no repair after 10 years of harsh use in professional work at the ocean, and expeditions of all sort. If I could I would buy just the same ones. However, they are discontinued. Now these are fine and feel light but:<br />1) the nose cannot be adjusted. So you get them where they sit.<br />2) the dark corner looks weird.I wonder why they added that. Just a single color frame would have made this more natural.<br />3) the glasses do not feel as sharp as my old sunglasses. Perhaps the materials changed. I recall they were made in the USA by then but now the case had a sticker &#34;made in China&#34;, perhaps this may have something to do with the quality of the glasses.<br />4) the polarized feature works but it is way more darker than my original Peppers also PL.<br /><br />I could bare with all this but there is one more flaw that made me send them back. The top center of the frame has a very deep V shape that is so extreme that you can see over the frame. To close &#34;the hole&#34; I had to wear them closer but then I had my eyelashes against the glasses and the frame did not sit there for long neither since the nose cannot be adjusted. It makes no sense to have extended sides to prevent unwanted light, if you can see over the frame itself. Light can access your eyes producing reflections as well as having no protection at all.<br /><br />Now I am disappointed at Peppers, since their quality seems to have decreased, the frame design at least for this model is flaw and the seller made me pay for the shipping back to them.<br /><br />This transaction has been a waste of money and time."
2.0,I only got 8 glasses.
2.0,"I purchase this thinking it was going to be work well with my strapless outfits and it was a big mistake. This product doesn't work as well as the images. It is hot, tacky, and you can see it under your clothes. I do not recommend purchasing this item at all."
2.0,Great feel and look of wallet had every compartment I wanted then after two months started falling apart too expensive to last for only that long to bad.
2.0,"Very poor quality, stitching, etc. - coming apart right out of the package. And the sewn-in tag says 65% polyester 35% cotton - I bought this because the seller description clearly says &#34;100% cotton.&#34;"
2.0,Super cute but wayyyy to small
2.0,"The pants are ok with one big exception - they give you an illusion of having a massive camel toe! The back is fully black and front is gray and the way they're sewn in the crotch the black fabric makes a long thin triangle towards the front. You can actually sort of see it in the pictures on the product page. So yeah, no thank you, returning them."
2.0,"The one that I bought did not last too long 3 months to be exact. The glue that holds the two sides [tones] of the belt together is not very good and soon I had a split in my belt. The materials used felt like vinyl like the one that goes on the floor and the belt kept its curled shape that it was shipped with, made it difficult and inflexible to be worn on both sides. [Belt did not straighten out - so I ended up only using the brown side] . Its an ok belt for the price."
2.0,"I was so excited to get these. UA are by far my favorite shoe. Love the shoe design. However, they run 1/2size too small. I have several UA pairs of shoes. All are a size 6. I purchased these in a 6 and they're at least half a size too small. Probably closer to a full size. Disappointingly, I'm stuck with them. I wasn't able to trade them out because I paid $40 for them but the 6.5 and 7's were priced at $90. I wasn't going to pay $50 more for a size problem. Maybe they were marked wrong and that's why they were cheaper. If so, seller should've made note on the item description."
2.0,"The lock broke on my second day of vacation in a country where I couldn't easily buy another one, so it was basically useless. It is a nice-sized sturdy bag though, so I will buy a better lock and use it in the future."
2.0,Loved the color and the length. But WAY to small across the chest. Buttons were busting open. I ordered a medium. A large would have been way to big everywhere else unfortunately I am returning.
2.0,Poor quality.  Didn’t get to wear it because buttons fell off when buttoning. Will be returning.
2.0,"I went by your sizing chart, and boy was it way off.  Am giving them to someone much smaller."
2.0,"Looks as expected.  But the stitching is rough on the outside of foot and small toe.  A sock doesn't solve it, it requires foam as protection."
2.0,"Fabric looks and feels cheap. It is cheap, so what else to expect?"
2.0,"I'm no model, but this doesn't look anything like the picture."
2.0,"The ear sections are huge, and that's coming from a tall guy. The whole thing also has a very bad system for staying on your head. Maybe the band is too smaller? Moving your neck a few times will cause it to fall off pretty frequently. Only thing I do like is that the material is nice, and the price would have been good if not for the major usability issue."
2.0,"16 months after I purchased this wallet I am getting ready to toss it in the trash. Typical use has resulted in the cheap leather peeling off and ugly discoloration a. The wallet simply sits in my purse, pulled out periodically to retrieve a gift card. Please don't waste a whopping $22.50 on this cheap item."
2.0,Not as good as I thought it would be.to much air comes through them when ridding.
2.0,Very disappointed.  All it did for me was change the tint of everything to yellow.  The halo's and glare are just as bad as not wearing any glasses.  They did look cute.  Returned them.
2.0,Sizing was really inconsistent. One fit and one was too big.
2.0,"These are very cute but run extremely small in size. I ordered XL for me, XXL for my mom, and my daughter XXXL. Have to wear the XXXL because XL and XXL don’t fit me. My normal clothing size is XL, size 8 panties, and women’s  size 16 or junior size 17."
2.0,I didn’t get it.
2.0,Bad quality. First time order from Amazon sports bra. Two washed already looks like It is worn 100 times. Well.... back to Lululemon or real sports shop brand.
2.0,Heavy hot material
2.0,"Well I received my dress in time , unfortunately it’s looks cheap and was too tidy I returned it , my return was easy thumps up , return policy is 5 ⭐️"
2.0,This was supposed to be an XXXL. Even my friend's daughter in high school could not get it on. I ended up giving it away.
2.0,Pretty but broke in 4 min.
2.0,They weren't as tall as they appeared in the picture and their 'olive green' is really Teal. Not very pleased.
2.0,Beautiful but came undone by 2nd wear. I had to use Gorilla glue to put it back together
2.0,I love this nose ring but unfortunately it was tight around my nostril wish it was a little bigger in the hoop area
2.0,"Teeth are very small, but the worst part is that they have a VERY weird center tooth. It is large and in the middle of the mouth. It looks unnatural."
2.0,The material is crap. Only got to work it twice and the zip stopped working. Was very disappointed with this buy
2.0,The design is great but i received the product either damaged or flawed. Also it is a little loose and for the style of case i was expecting a snug fit
2.0,"Not my favorite shirt of Patty’s. The part that goes around the neck is not as symmetrical as it looks, and it’s not a matter of mine being made wrong. Just how the whole thing works makes it not symmetrical. This is one of the 2 shirts I have gotten from Patty that I feel is very misrepresented in the photo. The first one has since been changed because of many complaints. Love Patty, do not love this one."
2.0,Very thin fabric and its not soft.  has no give.  it felt more like a men's &#34;wife beater&#34; under shirt then a womens tank.
2.0,Thin definitely not high quality get what you pay for
2.0,"Assuming this is specifically for a mad hatter costume, and you wish the costume to have a quality appearance...definitely recommend not using this item.  Instead, buy 24 wooden threaded spools (or empty spools and thread your own, if you want that extra effort) and a spool of metal chain findings (plus attaching rings) and make your own.  I did not expect a really &quot;solid&quot; bandolier for the cost of what this is selling for, and only purchased to get an idea for sizing of the spools and general look on the costume.  In hindsight, I wish I would have saved the cost altogether, and just initially started from scratch and worked up my own."
2.0,It’s sad to say that this product did not meet its expectation. It looks cheep and used. The lock is tilted and the glass is dirty with smudges and finger prints on it. It’s not even worth the hassle of returning it.
2.0,"I love the look and size of the bag, but after 10 days of use abroad, the Velcro no longer works and I will not noble able to use it anymore.  Really disappointing."
2.0,"Material is thin, a little see through."
2.0,Returned shawl.  Too bulky for me.
2.0,It’s a very cute dress but I noticed the bust area was crippling. I am a DD and the XL zipped up! But.. like i said the breast area looked horrible and the build in shorts was going up my crotch area. I am 5’1 and was really surprised that I had this issue.
2.0,"the watch part keeps falling off, they were cheap and they were made very cheap, but they are cute on."
2.0,I returned this jacket.  It was too large and did not look like I expected it to look.
2.0,"They are made from cheap fabric.  They were very soft, which was the only good thing, but from fabric that won't last. Uncomfortable at the thigh stitches, very tight compared to the rest of the pants. I will be returning."
2.0,It’s like a shiny swimsuit material and all the stitches are frayed looking. Idk I think there are better versions of these pants elsewhere. Fit okay tho. I guess the legs are a little short.
2.0,We have to have clear bags for work. I loved it while it lasted but it has already broken!! The strap came loose and the side of the bag ripped. Not going to order another because I need to get more than a months use out of a bag.
2.0,"Was not expecting much given the price of this ring....however, it has weird, lopsided white eyes."
2.0,Used the size chart and tried to get for my boyfriend but it was waaaaay to big.
2.0,"Below average quality, a lot of sloppy glue. Daughter won't wear them because they are scratchy."
2.0,Material is different than expected.  Doesn't clean my glasses as expected.
2.0,"Definitely not for apple body shapes. Tight in the waist and loose in the bust (and that's saying something, as I'm not lacking in the bust department). Cute print, soft fabric."
2.0,Cool watch but the band constantly pops off. Not the usual Swiss Army quality.
2.0,but for $.58 what did I expect? I paid more for the shipping than I would have wanted though...I don't recommend purchasing!
2.0,I was very pleased with these initially but after the first wear they started to pill all over. By the 4th wear they had worn so thin that they started getting holes. Nope
2.0,"I was hoping it would stay rose gold for at least a little longer than a month and half, but here we are. It discolored really quickly. I’m at least thankful my nose itself wasn’t discolored and didn’t get infected, so I’ll give it that."
2.0,I must have read the description wrong because this was for an 8 year old and was way too big.
2.0,The watch is beautiful however the first time my husband wore it the pin fell out. I paid to have it engraved on the back for our anniversary. Made me sick.. we tried to fix it but can not get the pin to go back in. Quality is not good
2.0,Compre este articulo en talla XL y uno me vino en talla M lo quiero devolver
2.0,"Shirt is a very vibrant gold that I didn't care for.  Fabric seems nice and cool however, the shirt had a strange unpleasant odor."
2.0,Bought the size we always do and they slip right out. Rubber backs don’t stay on
2.0,Not happy with this purchase. Shipping took over a month. The quality of the dress was cheap. Runs small. Colors were pretty but just not a good dress. I ordered another dress similar to this one and received it in less than a week. The quality was way better.
2.0,"I bought what I thought was my size but it wasn't. They don't stretch like they said they do ,so now I'm stuck with leggings that don't fit and can't wear them"
2.0,Love the style and color but I hand washed it and air dryed it and it shrunk
2.0,Couldn't even fit onto my daughter's foot (she wears a 10.5-11). Very disappointing on Christmas morning!
2.0,"Cute, soft pants, however the size chart is incorrect. I ordered a medium for my 10 year old son because the chart indicated medium was sizes 10-12. Buyer beware, a medium is a size 8.  I'm sad to have to return these right before Christmas."
2.0,It ripped within two weeks of me owning it
2.0,"Love the light weight and flow of the dress but the stitching was very poor, frayed ends and little tear in the plunged neck line at the front!"
2.0,Wasnt patterned quite as the pic showed. And the fabric wasnt that great. I returned it.
2.0,It has a weird fit in the mid section. Not very forgiving . Sent mine back.
2.0,"I ordered a large in the ""green"" print and not even my size 1 teenage daughter could fit into this comfortably. It fits perfectly though... around my right upper thigh. I do like the fabric blend and pattern colors but if you're waist is anything bigger than a size 1 (their size ""large"") I'd save the hassle on having to repackaging, labeling and driving to return it. I should've took caution at all the other reviews that wrote that it was waaaaay to small. Notice for the company: resize the inner elastic, pretty please. Apparently, we all WANT to wear this skirt because we love the quality and style- we just can't FIT into it."
2.0,The quality was nice but these earrings were HUGE I’m talking twice the size of normal tassel earrings. Ended up sending them back.
2.0,So I have this jacket in 3 different colors... in blue and gray this jacket gets 5 stars. The black is not the same material and fits different. Silky-ish? And tighter.
2.0,I'm still suffering lots of fog.
2.0,"I ordered this dress in an XL and received a small. I exchanged it for the correct size and again received a small. 2 stars instead of 1 because it seemed to be made well. I still really want this in a size that will actually fit, but I'm certainly not going to order it again, just to be disappointed."
2.0,the ruffle along the sides of the bust does not flatter
2.0,"T shirt has no shape, is cheaply made, as is to be expected for the price."
2.0,"Flimsy, very light material.  Fold it in half and you almost have a half decent neck scarf.<br />Es Walnut Creek Ca"
2.0,Didn't work...
2.0,The size for this shoe are really off. Ordered a 9 - was too tight and then ordered a 10- was huge.I think I will be just returning it again !
2.0,Material is very thin and NOT at all as the pictures.  It is not good quality at all.  returned.
2.0,The sizing is way too big
2.0,Lenses are very yellow. I got the clear ones and they look like safety glasses.<br />You can see the yellow while you are wearing them. The lenses also have a reflective product on it that makes it look even more like safety glasses.<br />Good thing they were cheap.
2.0,"The white t shirt dress was completely sheer<br />Needs a full slip underneath<br />No shape to it, very unflattering,<br />Would be better used  as a nightshirt I’m my opinion"
2.0,Pants received were NOT petite.  I'm going to have to shorten by at least 5 inches.  Very disappointed.
2.0,Sole too thin to support feet. Not very warm.
2.0,Did not like the stones in the earrings I received - returned them
2.0,It's ok.  Nothing really to praise about.  It does it's job. 9/20/18 broke at what I thought was a solid piece but it was slightly hollow.  Not sure why that was but not worth it in the end. I was super hopeful.
2.0,Cute earrings but all of them broke within a few weeks of daily wear.
2.0,That’s were not at all what I expected. In the pictures they look like soft sweatpants. This is not at all what they are. What I received was more of a nylon pant and I am very disappointed
2.0,"Everything fit great and looked great... Until I used the middle strap. It's extremely smaller than the others and not in a way that allows your body to look tapered. It also isn't very adjustable. I'm going to try to just take the belt off, because the rest is great."
2.0,The product arrived quickly however it was too small. Return was easy
2.0,leather was not the quality I expected.
2.0,the back is a not to sturdy safety pin glasses may be too heavy
2.0,Love the band - but band continues to pop out of frame.
2.0,Way too small all over. Bummed cause its a cute top. Returning
2.0,They look cool but you really have a hard time seeing out of them. I really strained my eyes when I wore them
2.0,Not great. The top was too small but the skirt is wearable with a different top. Very thin and not quality material. For the cost it’s not worth it. You could find something similar else where for better quality/price point
2.0,Scratch easily and way too wide. I thought these would be cool and they look great when you get them but they scratch easily and they were gigantic on my face. My soccer team called me alien when I wore them which is always fun.
2.0,I bought size 8. I received 2 size 8 shirts and a size 6 shirt. All of the shirts were super super tiny-like 3/4 T tiny. The quality is not great. We returned them.
2.0,"Battery died after about a month of use. So factor that into your budget if planning to buy this. Heck, I'm just assuming it's the battery! It could be the watch just stopped working. Either way😕"
2.0,Horrible running pants.you can see everything and they are see thru. These are the worst leggings I have ever bought. I expected better from Spanx.
2.0,"Pretty large for the style of top, I’m normally an XS/S and it was very loose."
2.0,"I was disappointed.  It wasn't as shown, it was shorter and ran smaller.  The quality wasn't worth the price."
2.0,"This swim suit was made wrong, the two pieces of fabric that were used for the bottoms were different sizes so no matter how I wore it it looked super bunched up. Also the bottoms were slightly big and the top runs really small. (I ordered a size small and am a size 2 pants and 34A)"
2.0,These earrings are crazy huge.
2.0,LOVE the print but in the end I returned this. There was a horizontal seam under the plunge and it hit my body at the exact wrong place.
2.0,"I’m always a small or extra small for tops and a size 0 or 2 pants size, but these smalls were super tight. So tight that they were way too uncomfortable to lounge or sleep in. The top is kind of baggy around the shoulders, but tapers more at the waist, resulting in a weird fit. The print is okay, and the fabric is soft, but the fit just won’t work for me."
2.0,"I had high hopes because the cut/design were so cute. However, the underwire was a little twisted when I opened it for the first time. I thought I could just untwist it or cover it up. And then after washing it, oh gawd! That made it worse! It was a tornado and unusable! There’s no way I can salvage this! What a waste of money!"
2.0,"cute but too thin..many inside threads,,tight...made in China which I did not realize until I saw the label all in Chinese...I donated them..."
2.0,The loupe field of view was to small for my needs and bought a larger unit.
2.0,It was good just wish to material were a little bit more thicker it looks kind of cheap
2.0,"Let me start out by saying that if you’re gonna wear this once or twice, indoors, for a photoshoot or something, go ahead and get it. It’ll be fine.<br /><br />If you plan on wearing it outside or for longer than 1 hour, don’t buy. Don’t get me wrong, these things look COOL. However, they didn’t breathe in the slightest, caused me to have heat exhaustion after two hours at a ren faire, they’re tighter on the legs than they are at the waist so they ride down a lot, and you have to pull them up constantly. After pulling them up maybe twice, and GENTLY I might add, the hem on the waist started tearing. These are not made well at all. They sure look cool though!"
2.0,I wear a size 13 and the XL is too small. I will order a XXL and see if that fits.
2.0,Too big.  Which is hard to believe because almost all sunglasses I buy are way too small.  They fit my head well and have a wide bridge for my nose.  The lenses are just ridiculous.  They'd be great for a rave or any other occasion that calls for hiding your eyeballs.
2.0,They are not as detailed as the picture. Pretty disappointing.
2.0,"The dress came in a very so small bag, which caused it to be very wrinkle when I first took it out of the bag. The dress had multiple pieces of stray threads that needed to be cut! The neck line of the dress would not lay flat. The belt one the front of the dress had to be stitched to make it secure. The dress I received is a much cheaper looking dress than the one in the picture. The dress did arrive at the expected time, and the color of it was pretty. All in all it came together, however know what I know I wouldn’t purchase this dress again."
2.0,Don't buy large unless your 600lbs. Looks sweet though. Medium 👌
2.0,The fabric is super thin and the shorts are not all that shapely.
2.0,They're very cute but they don't last. I snapped 2 of them in just 3 days. All it takes is a little pull for them to break.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress for casual wear but the material is very thin. Plus, you can see through it. If you have any bulge anywhere, good luck wearing this dress."
2.0,So I thought this was going to be made of like cotton from the product photo and be somewhat loose. It's made more of a spandex material and order size up. If you like tight half shirts this is for you.
2.0,Shirt and bottoms don't match the pink stars on the shirt are totally different than the pink on the bottoms after first wash the bottoms lost their shape and you can't iron it because of the details on the bottoms not satisfied with this purchase.
2.0,"Nice dress and colors are as pictured. Dress fits well, I am 5'4 and 138lbs and ordered a Medium, but it is a little shorter than I wanted for office wear. Can't walk 10 steps without it rising up and strings were hanging from the bottom hem."
2.0,Unless you are a small woman you should not order this..I went by the description of bust size etc and thought it would be perfect. Beautiful cover up but not for curvy women.
2.0,"Would've been great, but ran SO SMALL, particularly in hip area, like it was made for a boy. Had to return."
2.0,"Dismal quality - fabric is thin and not durable. It pilled after 1 wearing. Too bad because the fit and design was what I was looking for as well as the color but the fabric and finishing is horrible. You get what you pay for, I guess."
2.0,Every single one I wore the magnet fell out so I asked for a new package and it happened AGAIN.
2.0,Too small and not my style sent it back.
2.0,"Cheap, cheap, cheap.  Do not recommend these.  Very poorly made in my opinion & just really look cheap.  They look like something you would buy at Cato."
2.0,Nice but crooked... really bummed
2.0,OK tie but not near as wide as they said. Three inches wide at the most and the color is much lighter than the picture. I will not buy anything from them again.
2.0,Was much thinner than expected. Sizes run small. Late arrival.
2.0,"It's ok if you are looking for a child hat, but I had bought it for and adult birthday gift."
2.0,"Dress was proper size, fit, but the material is thin and see through in the white color. I ordered the dress in white with flowers and sent it back. In indoor lighting and outdoors I can be easily seen through. Do not recommend getting it in white."
2.0,"It fit as expected, but was already fraying/had loose threads when I received it. For the price, you can expect it, but you can find similarly priced clothes at actual retail shops that won't fall apart like this,"
2.0,"Such a cute top! Absolutely fell in love with this design and was super excited to wear it. Unfortunately I have to return it. It runs EXTREMELY small. I ordered a medium but it looks like an extra small ! Side note, the fabric is ehhh not my favorite."
2.0,The xl fits more like a Women's medium . I would definitely size up. I understand this product is supposed to fit tight but I wish they had a size bigger I recommend sizing up
2.0,Lace needle end smaller than anticipated. Would be troublesome threading better quality leather laces.<br />Any recommendation for an exchange?<br />Thank you.
2.0,Touch didn't work on my phone.
2.0,"Not as expected.  Fabric cheap and not worth the money, returned this item"
2.0,"A stretchy belt seemed like a good idea, but adjusting this belt is not easy. Once wearing it, that's where it will stay, so no tightening or loosening as with belts with holes. A bit overpriced for a fabric belt."
2.0,"Thought it was 8 caps, but it was 4 sets of 2 pieces. Were not breathable, but they did look like real bald heads from a far."
2.0,I love these. They are super cute and girly!  Unfortunately ill have to give them away though... my daughter is very little. She is 1 year old and has tiny feet. She is also walking. These dont work well for walking babies. This is the only reason I gave a 2 star. The second she steps off the carpet onto hard surface they are like ice skates.  She kept trying to stand up and couldnt because they were so slippery. Its actually very dangerous. There is no grip on the bottom. Im very sad. I wish there was a way for me to add a rubber sole. They really are beautiful shoes though and look cute. Would work great for non walkers!
2.0,Wasn't a fan of the overall construction and feel.  They felt cheap and flimsy and too tight around the strap that comes down on the foot.
2.0,"This fit and looked nice at first but we are returning due to excessive piling after minimal wear, the acrylic material is cheap."
2.0,"I bought a size 7/8 for my 6 year old. It seems to be about the right size, it's just the bottom part was poorly made so that  you'd need a larger size to prevent the issues multiple reviewers have cited(and then you'd be dealing with leg holes so large that you'd have other issues.)<br /><br />My daughter is in gymnastics 5 hours a week and spent all of class picking her leo because the cut is so high that if she actually does anything while wearing it she has it riding up in the front and back. I even put shorts on her for it because with the high cut it had way too little coverage.<br /><br />Overall she'll have to wear shorts with it and since she keeps having to mess with it in class I'll probably end up taking apart the bottom and altering it to somehow work since the return window has passed. Not something I want to do or should have to do."
2.0,Doesn't fit well
2.0,"The buckle and snap very cheaply made.  The buckle keeps falling off, not as it appears on the picture."
2.0,No lleno las expexmctativas
2.0,"Ugh. This skirt is very cute, but it does run VERY small. I'm usually a US 2/4, so I sized up to a medium. I probably should've gotten a large, because it was still pretty tight and very very very short. I was willing to look past the fit (because it was still cute, just a little more scandalous than I originally intended) until the zipper broke on me! I had worn it MAYBE twice before. Honestly, you can get something better from H&M or Zara. Don't bother with this."
2.0,It looks different on the site
2.0,"A little small, not the quality I expected."
2.0,"I use XL in other brands, this XL is really a medium. Very disappointed."
2.0,super small and i ordered big. Boo
2.0,too see thru
2.0,Beautiful bracelet but sizing is not true. I had to pay return shipping - not satisfied at all.
2.0,"These are perfectly fine goggles if your head is the size of a childs' head. The sellers' listing ad says these are for adults and children.<br /><br />I ended up giving them to someone, since they won't fit on me. I'm a regular (3 x week) lap swimmer and would have enjoyed using these. Too bad they skimped on strap length to save money. Other goggles provide adequate length of straps.<br /><br />Can't recommend and would not buy again."
2.0,"This is too sharp and jabs you if you don’t have a flat stomach. Very pretty, but uncomfortable."
2.0,These shorts are adorable and comfy. I ordered two pairs. Red and black. My little girl loves wearing the red pair. I never received the black pair. But all in all even though I never received the other pair I ordered. The red pair is a great addition to her closet
2.0,It arrived flat as a pancake. These types of hats don't look great at all once they are smashed. It now was a glaring crease in the front and the overall shape of the hat looks as you would expect once it is smashed and then uncrinkled.<br />The logo on the front is a print not embroidery. I bought this thinking it was embroidered by the hat title. Kinda bummed overall. It is still wearable but I won't be wearing it.
2.0,"The set unfortunately came with some scratches and blemishes and had a chemical smell to it. The outside compartments especially for the carry on is a good idea, but it takes the needed room away from the inside. So you have to compromise. Had to send it back."
2.0,Too bulky and heavy
2.0,Thread kept coming off
2.0,Soft lightly printed design. Would be great to wear to the beach
2.0,This is NOT the colors pictured. 2 shows navy and purple. This is green and red. I'm very disappointed.
2.0,So I only had them on for maybe an hour and I look at my hand and there are black rings around my fingers and wrist. The product looks great and perfect for photos and pulling the outfit together but..........my hand.
2.0,Material of poor quality
2.0,Had to return this one...looked cheap...just my opinion
2.0,Too TIGHT. Too Wrinkled.
2.0,"T-shirt like material, not really a sweatshirt"
2.0,Bought this for my daughters speech class. It runs small and sticks to the mouth as it steams up when she speaks so can’t see her mouth movement. We don’t even use it as is hanging on a hook all sad and neglected.
2.0,I'll fitting especially around the nose area.  Couldn't be bothered to return them so I wear them over a surgical mask.
2.0,The fit is a little irregular. Very fitted from the chest and very loose from the hips.
2.0,I received the earrings and they were small in size. They look like they were made for a child.
2.0,"The style and color were great, but the elastic waist band was too tight and dug into my waist. So bad I never wore it, and just donated it."
2.0,Mine broke to fast.  Make sure you get an 8 gauge line or lose beads
2.0,Not as pictured...off white in color...as usual im hvn trouble returning!!!
2.0,"Very cute,  but the chain extender and clasp weigh more than the mountain charm, so it won't stop riding up awkwardly, because it's too weighted in the back.  I finally gave up and took it off. Very disappointing."
2.0,Not the color pictured nor do they technically match but for the price they're still cute just really wanted what was pictured :(
2.0,To big should have done my homework
2.0,This is really pretty and honestly seems like good quality but the clip completely broke in less than one week of using.  Pretty disappointed.
2.0,If the sticky tape would stick to my chest these will be amazing. The tape will not stick .
2.0,"This dress runs terribly small. I’m 5’4” tall, weigh 148 pounds and ordered a size 8. I was not able to begin to fit into this dress. Buyer beware, if you need a different size or need to return the dress you have to pay to send the dress back to China. I now know if their is additional shipping charges, it usually means the dress is made and shipped outside of the US."
2.0,Not seamless. Seam is quite scratchy.
2.0,My wife bought this wallet and did not like it.  It was rather cheap looking and she thought the inside might easily tear.  We returned it.
2.0,"This is supposed to be a sweater, so I didn't expect to see through it when I tried it on. Fabric very thin. I ordered beige, however it was cream. To the seller, do not label this a beige, it's no where near beige! Fabric is flimsy, looks like, even with hand washing it will come apart."
2.0,(Reviewed by my wife):<br /><br />What I liked about this set:<br />*The crystals are very colorful and sparkly.<br />*The necklace pendant is a good size and stands out.<br />*The jewelry seems to be made well overall.<br /><br />What I don't like about this set:<br />*The earrings posts are WAY too thick to get into my earring holes.  I cannot wear them at all.
2.0,Very thin material. Didn't feel or appear to be a flannel shirt. Was looking for a more femine fit.
2.0,"I bought these for my elderly father-in-law after he lost his go-to rosary beads. After reading these nice reviews, I was surprised after opening the plastic packaging and seeing how cheaply these are made. The cross is very crude and has a gaff where the wood is broken off along one edge, and gobs of dried glue are all over one side where the Jesus figurine is mounted. After having these beads for less than a day, Jesus fell off the cross and I had to re-glue Him back on. It isn't worth sending them back, and my 80 year old father-in-law doesn't want to be without rosary beads, so we'll keep them, but I am quite disappointed. Buyer beware!"
2.0,the hat is not put together well at all.
2.0,Poorly made but I made it work!
2.0,"The material was average. Good stretch to it. But the shoulder pads in it made my shoulders feel very broad. It might be a good fit if you have narrow shoulders, but if your broader, would not recommend."
2.0,The item fits as expected. The material is rough. Only buy if you're sure. It was double the price of the item to ship back. Wouldn't recommend.
2.0,Could of worked nicely but came creased and was very visible under even a thick top
2.0,"Shirt was nice, but did not Arrive in the right color. Took so long to get here that i just kept the one that arrived. So I was disappointed that i now have a White and red shirt instead of a white and black one to match my car."
2.0,Fabric seemed sticky and clingy. Black dye all over me hands... painful. Washed thinking would be better but gave to my 14 y/o niece.
2.0,"These look cute and I like the bamboo. I also like the soft bag/case they came in. I hated how the lenses were flat, so light would reflect off of the side of the glasses from behind me and into my eyes. The lenses fall out easily even when I am just wiping them off. The bridge of the nose seemed very fragile and I could imagine it breaking the glasses in half one day. Returned."
2.0,"Nice belt, but I have had this for one week and already one of the grommets has worked it's way lose."
2.0,"Order one size up than your normal size.  If you want a Motley Crue shirt, this is a nice under-stated design.  However, for the price, the fabric is very thin and cheap.  The price-to-quality ratio is not very attractive."
2.0,Was hoping it was more turquoise
2.0,"Fit well, 28w normally.<br />Made cheaply and already appeared to be pulling at seams. It was very flattering though.<br />Returned."
2.0,Ok I brought the wrong and wanted to return them but it was cheaper to keep them.
2.0,"Lost it's shape after a month, toe area too close to the toes. if I ordered it any larger, they would have been too big."
2.0,"I bought these sunglasses a while ago and loved them a lot! they were big, sturdy, great quality for the price, and sat well on my low asian nose bridge which was a huge plus. Unfortunately i misplaced them somewhere and decided to order a new pair. The new one looked terrible, the paint job was sloppy. Thought i got a bad one so i returned and reordered another, but the next one was even worse! crappy paint job and they didn't even sit nicely on my nose anymore!! The only good part is Amazon's free shipping and return! Extremely disappointed!"
2.0,Too smal and weak stitching makes them unwearable
2.0,Nice watch but it DOES NOT have a date window AS ADVERTISED!<br />I would have purchased a different one as that was one of the things I was looking for!
2.0,"These are so thin - sheer - they are more like hose than socks. I'm sure some demographic would go wild over these, but not the 60-something me."
2.0,Very disappointed in the material . Feels more like a Halloween costume then an actual dress.
2.0,This product did not meet my expectations. It left a film on my lenses that defeated its purpose. I do not recommend it.
2.0,"If you're too tall -or if the tops of your socks are too low- these won't hold. The clips come undone for me constantly. This is on all kinds of dress shirts. They stay clipped on the socks very well, but they aren't long enough to stay clipped on the shirt. So then I'm constantly going to the restroom to fix my shirt stays. I might as well just keep tucking my shirt in. You need a certain amount of tension to keep the shirt down, but not so much that it keeps yanking the clips off of the shirt."
2.0,"I've tried steam, water, sun, everything, but still cannot get the fold lines out of the hat. Cannot wear it."
2.0,I like the style but I don’t like the way it’s made. Very poorly made
2.0,Larger around the waist than expected for my skinny girl
2.0,Very blunt and thick. Make the holes look bigger than they are
2.0,"Changed color very quick! After a few days, the dangle fell apart three time and the last time, I couldn’t find the piece. I mean I guess you get what you pay for but damn that was quick!"
2.0,"I've purchased one of these necklaces before (albeit from another seller on Amazon), and this one didn't quite compare.<br /><br />I received the package in a timely manner and it was packaged well. At first glance, the necklace looked fine. It is a cheap, costume item, so I wasn't expecting much. However, it still managed to disappoint. As mentioned, I've ordered this exact necklace before, and it was beautiful. Unfortunately, this one looks sloppily put together. Taking a close look, I noticed that many of the &#34;stones&#34; are shoddily glued in. They aren't even in place. There's a clear setting where the stone should be, and most of them are glued halfway out. And obviously so. Furthermore, some of the finer metal details on the upper attachment (above the moon) are broken. I'm very disappointed in this purchase. It's always a gamble ordering this cheap stuff, and this time it didn't pay off. It looks nice at a distance, but you don't have to get too close to see the mistakes."
2.0,These are just a sports tank top that is snug. There is no compression like quality to it
2.0,Not what I expected.. claps too big when close around the neck.
2.0,"These were really ill fitting. The length was way too long and unflattering, and they were too tight in the butt area. Just not a very good style. Material felt nice, though."
2.0,I believe I can print the same design in a sheet of paper and place it inside the pendant if it weren’t sealed shut. The pendant is pretty neat but the decal is low resolution.
2.0,"I love the style, the ruching is perfect for camouflaging the fupa.  My greatest regret is that the material is THIN and a slinky type of material and I wasnt expecting that. It says 95% polyester and 5% elastin. Guess I should have known there wouldn't be much to the material of the dress. So the white dress is DEFINITELY see-through. I intended to wear if with a smoother and I'll keep it knowing that a nude body slimmer is a MUST and because of the support of the ruching which helps a bit in adding some coverage."
2.0,"Very flimsy, silky material, like a nightgown, super short, more like a tunic, cheap looking"
2.0,"I was so disappointed with these pants. Although the fit was good except for being a bit short, they wrinkle terribly.  I have tried all types of cycles on wash and dry but nothing takes out the wrinkles. For the price I expected better.  You can iron or dry clean but neither is a good solution."
2.0,Runs very small. Bought a medium and it feels like an xsmall
2.0,"Longer than expected and the stripes line up very oddly, so its not very flattering."
2.0,product good but i ordered a larger size so they would be able to grow into them and they were still very tight.  my child is size 10 and i ordered 13/16
2.0,Bottom fits perfect the top is way to big.
2.0,Beautiful green color. Ordered XXL. I’m 225 and 5’5”. Fit good through shoulders and chest but arm length and overall shirt length was ridiculous. This was basically a dress. It went back. Very disappointed because it was a beautiful shade of green and fit well otherwise. I just needed a shirt not a dress
2.0,This ran at least two sizes small.
2.0,"Loved the plush color but this fit like a thermal shirt, wouldn’t even go off my shoulders"
2.0,The quality was poor and they were uncomfortable to wear. My daughter refused to wear them
2.0,Material is very thick and the print looks cheap
2.0,Soft material. Read reviews and size charts prior to ordering but too large.
2.0,The fit is good but it fades out blotchy when washed.
2.0,I really wanted to love this shirt but the material felt like a weird spandex.
2.0,The sizing for this company is not accurate at all. Had to return the item - way too big.
2.0,"Unless you are some kind of exhibitionist, don't wear these shorts without underwear.  I thought I was getting the thicker version of the Polo shorts.  Disappointed the description didn't include the word ""sheer""."
2.0,Too big!  You get what you pay for.  Cheap looking. What can I say?
2.0,"If you plan on hanging this on a belt loop, you'll find it's a mite too small and opt for one slightly larger."
2.0,"Pros: The band that came with the Fitbit Charge 2 irritated my wrist (which was odd - the original Charge didn't); this one looks good, didn't bother my wrist, and held reasonably well with the magnetic clasp, which I prefer to the closing of the original band.<br /><br />Cons: The links in the band began to come a little lose, and after two months the band started snagging on half my clothes.  After three months, one of the screws holding the connection points together fell out and, upon examination, the other looked to be coming loose.  These are tiny enough that I would need to take it to a jeweler to get it repaired - even my precision driver set for computer building won't do the trick.<br /><br />Overall, the price is good, but I'm significantly disappointed in the quality of the merchandise."
2.0,"Color was great but material is better served for Fall/winter months.  Gold zipper at back is a bit too ""obvious"".  Did plan to cover with a lace shrug but just too heavy a material for an August wedding.  Will require a return."
2.0,See thru....very thin
2.0,"The fit is good, but it began to fall apart almost immediately. Had to use clear tape to keep it together."
2.0,Beautiful design! Very shiny! Unfortunately after 6 months it started rusting in the back!  Now it seems this may soon happen in the front. Very disappointed at that!! I showered  with it for about a week and never went to sea or a pool with it ! The chain it came with turned green in no time!<br />Note to the seller- this was a gift to myself so I am really disappointed.  It says sterling silver but I have never had sterling silver do this before....
2.0,"Got this for my daughter's 6th bday. All she wanted was a "" leather jacket "". I searched and read all reviews and decided on this one. She loved it ! Fit really well, looked great and cool. Sadly , the collar snap button broke in only a few days !! She was so crushed. It is being returned no problem but it is disappointing to have this happen. The button was snapped and somehow slipped right thru the button hole , as it wasn't a correct fit or size or just poorly made ? Bummer , cause it was a cute little motorcycle style jacket ."
2.0,"I thought the kids would like this one because it had a cute design and they could wear it around their neck and just pull it up when needed.  But I was wrong, none of my three liked it.  I ordered a size small.  I tried it on the 5-year old and 7-year old, it was pretty tight on both of them.  It was not loose hanging around their necks, it was more like a winter scarf wrapped tightly around their necks and it was hard getting them over their heads.  It did appear well made, no loose strings or open seems.  The material is super soft and silky."
2.0,"Liked the idea of this band, but it was way too tight when put on, wished was a little longer and had more available holes."
2.0,I wear an 8/10 typically and ordered a size 10 based on reviews. I can't even get it past my thighs! Super annoyed because this skirt is GORGEOUS in person and surprisingly great quality but there's no way I can wear it.
2.0,"came damaged...did not have button in the back at the top, cute dress but very short"
2.0,"These are plastic lenses, just not the best/cleanest sight through.<br />I am going to use the &#34;clip on&#34; part with some high quality lenses from one of my pairs of sun glasses."
2.0,"Was very cute for the first few hours I wore this but then the backing fell off and I nearly lost an earring. I managed to get it and I changed out the earring backs- still was falling off my ears, not sure why but I suspect it's because the disc at top is just really heavy."
2.0,"They're breezy and the fit is fairly nice but I don't expect them to last long.  When i opened the package one of them already had a seam that was falling apart with a physical hole in it.  I can also see where the seam is going on a second pair, worn once.  They are comfortable but I don't foresee buying them again because of quality concerns."
2.0,Very small clasp .  Hard to maneuver.
2.0,Nine out of the 40 didn't work.  You get what you pay for!  Look elsewhere.
2.0,The balls both broke into a bunch of little pieces
2.0,"Threads stick out from the fabric, the color is good, but the quality of the fabric is not good"
2.0,Zipper broke first week of school. Cheaply made.
2.0,"These look very nice, but broke within a month.  I kept them in a protective case and only wore them at the computer yet the center bridge came off the lens.."
2.0,"Not as soft as I thought it would be, does not stretch, looks smaller than an extra large should luck. Overall it will be OK  for my 10-year-old granddaughter. My advice is the please read what the material is made out of closer than I did"
2.0,Cloth is not as expected. Appears flimsy. Style is nice but material quality doesn’t nt seem durable. I am 4’ 11 ‘’ . This dress comes below my knees.
2.0,The material is very cheap and see-through. It's also just a printed design. I expected a nicer product.
2.0,The feel of the material was not desirable.  It didn't feel like the soft cotton I was hoping for.
2.0,I ordered a 2T and received 18-24 months. Way to small.
2.0,The clasp already broke and it was only worn once
2.0,Got these for my 6 year old that chewed on his shirt. He actually chewed through it in a few hours. Threw the rest away. Would not recommend these at all.
2.0,"This is a cute bracelet, but keeps coming unbuckled."
2.0,"I love all the compartments, but very cheaply made. The metal on the zippers are very noisy. Sounds like jingle bells as you walk."
2.0,"The clips started to get loose in about a 3 weeks of usage, and would pop off of my shirt.<br />My waist size is 32/33."
2.0,"It fit, but the crotch area sagged. Sent it back"
2.0,Worn once and decal already falling off. Missed buying this at actual concert so was looking for an alternative.
2.0,Runs Small!
2.0,"Cute but the rose gold finish came worn off in places. Other reviewers mentioned it and I should've listened. Spend a bit more for a nicer watch. Missed the return window; otherwise, this would be going back."
2.0,these run a bout a half size small
2.0,"Necklace is fine, but felt cheated on the ear studs which are not as shown, they are way smaller!"
2.0,"Smaller and thinner than I expected.  Wrongly thought the clip came with it.  I suppose you get what you pay for, but all in all somewhat of a disappointment."
2.0,T shirt seems good quality and good fit but coloration is off cactus is brown not green.
2.0,"While putting skirt on for the second time ever, I noticed the stitching on the seam in the front was separating. Not great quality."
2.0,They look great but even in black my butt crack shows when I squat
2.0,It was not a thin watch body.
2.0,"I bought this for my son who loves star wars. The shirt definitely came small. I washed it, and hung it to dry so it wouldn't shrink. However, it no longer fits. He wore it three or four times. We're quite disappointed. Other shirts I've ordered in the same size are a bit big or fit him well. This one is not true to size. Nice shirt, but order much larger than you need."
2.0,I should have read reviews. These boot were way off on size atleast a full size amallwr than.a 9''and a is what I always wear. Cute though.unfortunately I will not be able ro wear them
2.0,"I bought this because I didn't want to spend $50 on the ModCloth version. I should have just paid more money rather than buying this shirt.<br /><br />The sleeves are too short and sheer, the shoulders have a poor seam design that causes it to pucker, there are threads hanging all over, and the neck tie is very narrow and difficult to style.<br /><br />You get what you pay for."
2.0,It's a cute LITTLE bag. It's cheaply made. It will be ok to use on a nite out but certainly wouldn't hold up for every day use. I wouldn't purchase another one.
2.0,"Much shorter than appears in picture. Couldn’t do third loop at all. Otherwise cute and sort of works for what I needed, but definitely not what I hoped for."
2.0,"Took a chance with this shirt as there were no reviews. I ordered the size Small which is more like a M/L. For reference I’m 100lbs, 5’2” 32C. It’s not soft, the fabric thicker and boxy feeling as well as looking as it doesn’t cling obviously as you can see. Length is nice, longer than usual. If this was 2 sizes smaller it may be an option but the fabric isn’t comfy so I probably wouldn’t buy even if size was better."
2.0,The top fit just fine but the shorts were so small they could even be buttoned.
2.0,Very nice packaging.  Fabric is nice and didn't feel cheap.  Would say it isn't firm but is very comfortable and could be worn comfortably on a daily basis.<br />Update. It keeps rolling up and is NOT to tight. :(
2.0,This item is not compatible for above average sized feet. Very poorly made.
2.0,Is to heavy the back is to loose I lost two times
2.0,Way too big.  The sizing chart was way off!!!
2.0,Seam on the hood already had a hole when received. Look elsewhere!
2.0,"Too small, I ordered an XL and I am a size 6-8 usually in US size. The sleeves were like 3/4 sleeves on me."
2.0,The size was bigger than my usual. I will definitely go smaller next time. The bottom part of the bra underneath my breast was a little itchy as well as the straps. My next order would not include any frills just plain material.
2.0,"The frames are nice but the lenses are NOT anti reflective. If you're purchasing to put in other lenses, then these are fine. Was disappointed that the info said they are anti-reflective."
2.0,"The reason for 2 stars is the actual area of magnification is so tiny. If you can see in the photo, it’s on the bottom inner corners only. Almost impossible to position my eyes like this for reading."
2.0,Small for tote bags
2.0,"The fit is very small and the skull is glued on and there is not enough glue, it sticks up and will probably fall off."
2.0,Super cheap material. Didn't feel right at all
2.0,"I bought this for my mom for Christmas and it stopped working about a week later.<br />Possibly batteries, but disappointed especially since it was a gift."
2.0,"I have ordered this LONG sleeve dress 2 times now and have been sent the tank top one each time.. I am giving some stars because it is super cute, but I am so disappointed as my daughters 3 yr birthday is next week and now I will have to return them and find something else.. not sure why they sent it to me 3 times even though I only ordered twice, but it is the incorrect dress."
2.0,Not easy to use and look weird on any bracelet with other charms
2.0,"Came apart when I was trying to get it out of the bag... The glue holding on the central plastic gem just didn't cut it. Some hot-glue later and it was fine but for costume stuff like this you'd hope you could get at least a single wearing of it...<br /><br />That being said, after the fix it was all as expected. Earns back a star."
2.0,It’s beautiful but fades FAST. Very disappointing.
2.0,"Love the design and price. The size is quite large for my face, but I put the croakies on and keep working"
2.0,Very cute but 1 pair broke after a single drop (and onto grass too). Very disappointed
2.0,"Beautiful pin but, be warned... the backing does not stay on. I swapped the backing out to the rubber ones and Jaws still falls off :("
2.0,On the back of the bracelet it has hard glue and it itches when I wear it. I took it off.
2.0,"Order next size up as they run small, and zipper won’t stay closed"
2.0,"Love the knit patterns, however, the beret are too small for me"
2.0,Buckle broke in less than five months of normal use. Very disappointed. Leather material was fine.... but of little matter if the buckle isn’t.
2.0,Not my style of long sleeve it’s more designed for woman but that’s my opinion. I would not buy another due to the elasticity of the shirt and how it looks on me as a man.
2.0,"Bought this for my goddaughters birthday theme party its shown in picture is longsleeve rashguard and what I received was a sleeveless suit. Too small for her just about to turn 1 yr old this month, just good for 1 time use"
2.0,It’s warm and fuzzy.
2.0,Small<br />I
2.0,Very cute and work well for my daughter but they broke when she put them in her poket.
2.0,"These glasses are fine. WAY too wide for my face, and my face fits most average sized glasses pretty well. The tint is strange and doesn't protect from the sun very much. Cute design and frames though, although my lenses scratched almost immediately."
2.0,"This purchase was a last ditch effort for a costume I had to put together last minute and its the only thing that would have arrived on time. The quality is subpar, its pretty much felt. I gave it two stars because at the very least you can streeeetch the shoe cover enough to get your shoe in IF you cut the bottom.. The hat would only accommodate to a smaller head and the necklace was about the only decent part. The necklace itself and the bulbs are like huge! But the amount of different light settings was kind of cool. I kept the necklace and tossed the rest."
2.0,They don't fit very well. Since I have an average size of face I think  the glasses won't fit most of people.
2.0,"Just okay, felt like I was wearing a track uniform shirt"
2.0,"First time I wore it, chain broke.  Had it fixed and it broke the next time I wore it.  Fixed again now, so will see if it holds up"
2.0,"The overall quality of the cap is very good. However, the silkscreened logo on the front is applied so lopsided that the right side is almost one half inch lower than the left side. It would cost me half the price of the hat to return it so I guess I'll wear it and just tilt my head to the left wherever I go. I don't think AMR would like my hat to much."
2.0,Very poor quality. Beautiful dress. Got what we paid for.
2.0,Too small in shoulders. Doesn’t close all the way. Very thin material.
2.0,"The shape was a little off, and had a strong plastic smell. My glasses kept fogging up while wearing this mask."
2.0,The fabric was odd to the touch and not flattering at all.
2.0,"Bought these for my lady for her birthday. They look great around the waist, but the straps are just way too short and run across the middle of her ass cheeks, digging in quite deeply as though they're also somewhat &#34;misplaced&#34;. Beautiful lace, but bottom line (no pun intended), she's not going to be able to wear them. :("
2.0,Received a stained dress. Looks like someone left deodorant mark... and it’s just not one spot..
2.0,Fits weird. Crotch is low. Flaps in front sick out. SEE THROUGH!
2.0,The only way you could wear this dress is if you had no chest at all I ordered a larger size and still didn't fit
2.0,"I like the design/pattern. Very bright and colorful.  BUT they dont fit. They clearly state Men/Women size but are very tiny, and they dont stretch. I struggled to get it over my head and nearly pulled my ear studs out trying. Then it was way too tight around the neck. More like a choker than a gaiter.  When I attempted to pull the gaiter up over my nose it was much too tight for comfort and mashed my nose against my face.  And then again I could barely get it off.  I almost  took a pair of scissors to it instead of fighting with it. It may fit a very young child.  If I find one to give the gaiters to then I will do so.  I cannot wear the two that I ordered & paid for."
2.0,the print came way to small i wouldn’t get this
2.0,"Thin, too small and see through"
2.0,I folded the t-shirt vertical down the center and it was cut terribly. Definitely not the quality I had expected for the price!
2.0,"I loved the look of it, but I should have trusted the previous reviews that said that the torso was longer than usual. I am 5'3 and about 130 lbs and got a medium size 4-6, but the breast pads were way too high up from where they should have been, about 3-4 inches above where mine were. I tried pulling the neck straps down a little, but then the stomach area would look all bunched up. This bathing suit is meant for someone taller or with a long torso (or for some a 17 years old with perky breasts)."
2.0,"This product had a lot of hype around it. The material is comfortable but isnt meant for tall girls. I am 5’7 and it does not go down to my ankles nor does it even touch them, which may be okay for the summer but not so much the winter. I also ordered the light blue pair and it’s a great color just shoes a lot of imperfections aka your cellulite. I’d also be cautious of sweating in the blue and showing sweat marks thru the fabric. Hoping if I order the black that won’t be a problem"
2.0,It so tiny you can barely recognize the engraved letter on it.
2.0,"Runs small, elastic does not stay in place in the bottoms. Cute but cheaply made."
2.0,Is wide and doesn't fit near as well as it looks. :(
2.0,Material very thin and cheap quality
2.0,"I received my watch band fairly quickly, it went together very  easily. After a week of wearing it pieces of the band stated braking and coming off. Want be buying this product again 😟"
2.0,"I wore through the heel (in multiple socks) in less than six months. For socks at this price point, I expected better quality."
2.0,"It's smaller than the picture implies. Instead of hanging past the hips, it stops just short of the waist line. I'm about 5'7. I'm tall but not that tall. It's cute just misleading. Great buy for shorter girls."
2.0,Dress was tight in the waist area and overall did not look good on me. Material is very clingy with a lot of static electricity. Color and print were very pretty. Had to return.
2.0,"Wouldn't buy again. Doesn't wash well, handwash/cold cycle, still shrank and gets fluffy."
2.0,This is a beautiful bikini however the bottom fits way too small. I’m 5’3 120 pounds and I ordered a small. The top fits perfectly however the front part of the bikini is way too small for my comfort level. The bottom of the small feels like an xxsmall.<br /> Wish I could substitute the bottom for a medium.
2.0,"Bottom just a little big and top way too big.  For $12, thought it was worth a try."
2.0,The title Premium is very misleading. This shirt is basically a summer shirt. I returned it without taking it out of the bag. I can't comment on the fit. I was looking for a winter flannel and this is not the one.
2.0,"dress received was completely different from what I ordered.  the hem line was not high lo, it was handkerchief bottom and had a complete lace overlay."
2.0,Top is cute and looks like the pic but was way too small. This is a top for a small teen. I'll just give it to a friend instead of returning.
2.0,the clasp broke when I put it on the very first time. I would have paid more for better quality.
2.0,"Very pretty ring! Love the design- BUT Even before taking the ring out of the box, I noticed one of the small stones was missing. It is not noticeable upon glance, so I will keep the ring and wear it anyway. Just a notice.<br /><br />Received days after ordering with &#34;free 5-8 business days&#34; amazon shipping<br /><br />**UPDATE** One of the large stones fell out last night. I've only had the ring for a few days. (reducing stars to reflect)"
2.0,"The  leggings were way to small, I normally were a small in leggings but these were tiny. I would say that a large would fit better."
2.0,"Looks good, one size only is not very good for my girl friend who I bought it for. if the hat gets wet the finish starts to come off.  This hat is for looks only, nothing else."
2.0,"I thought I ordered this before but I was wrong.  First, they are thick and warm leggings.  I ordered a large and hope it fit me. But when I first tried this one, it was tight on my thighs and the crotch was so low. I tried to pull up as much as I could but it just didn't fit right over my booty. Since there is no tag on the back you can't tell what should be the front and what should be the back.  It definitely didn't feel right when I first tried them on and then I would turn them and try it that way but still not right. :(  I'm thinking of returning these."
2.0,They were veryloose and broke after three days
2.0,Not comfortable too Itchy
2.0,I am a small person and still have problems getting it fastened around the next.
2.0,Just a little to small to hold a dollar bill.
2.0,"The fit overs sit a little awkwardly over my glasses and apply pressure to the side of my nose, and the solid arms cause blind spots where my perriferal vision should be.<br /><br />The lens is great for cutting the high country glare."
2.0,Nice but really small
2.0,"Good quality but this dress is for large people, I had to pin it, in 7 different places so it didn’t look like a hospital gown. Everyone’s review said it runs small, but I think they are probably xxxxxxl."
2.0,"Cute top, but too small."
2.0,Top was too baggy and pants were see through and short from the abdomin
2.0,Quality is not good for me.
2.0,"I don't think this package is worth the price，especially the strap of the bag,it looks very bad,I don't really like it！"
2.0,I had to throw it out after two uses. The pattern rubbed off and the material started to disintegrate.
2.0,It’s now what I expected. The material is disappointing and the way it hangs.
2.0,"Very square and boxy more than the standard boyfriend jeans style. Very unflattering style. Waist not even fitted as photo advertised and the pant legs were like TENTS😂<br />I have these style Jeans already, not the same thing.<br />Full refund Return was quick and I didn’t have to pay to send it back is the only reason I have an extra star lol"
2.0,THis was supposed to be cotton - it was polyester! I specifically ordered it because I only sleep in cotton. THis was false advertising
2.0,It's a pretty top but the neck line did not fit me properly. The strap at the back was too long and loose.
2.0,Did not fit like other colors. Red and white both fit true to size.
2.0,Anchor feels plastic and looks CHEAP!
2.0,Too Small!
2.0,"I'm returning to update this review. After about three months the watch stopped working altogether. We always took good care of it and yet it just stopped. Very disappointed in the quality. Originally review: &#34;I gave this to my husband as a wedding gift, and thus far it has worked beautifully! It's even more gorgeous than the photos and it's time keeping is  very accurate! Just remember to wind, we keep forgetting!&#34;"
2.0,"This dress is not offered in petite.  It is below the knee on me and very loose through the waist and hips even though by the measurements I am a little larger than a medium which I ordered.  Also the dress looks shiny and sexy in the photo but is actually a matt finish and cheap looking cloth like a gray black dish towel, in fact.  It is fully lined and heavy to wear in the humid heat of New York City so it doesn't really function as a sun dress.  Oh well.  I'll wear it in winter with a jacket and coat covering it up."
2.0,Does not fit in the ear very well.  Uncomfortable
2.0,"These replacement lenses fit pretty good, are definitely not the same gauge as the originals. They are thinner and have more movement, maybe due to flexibility plus the thinness, and yes, I have them firmly snapped in place. They look good and the thinner lens makes these glasses lighter, a positive side effect. I think they are a decent replacement for the price. I hope they are as durable as the company purports them to be. If they are, I would love to try other colors.<br /><br />**Update from my August 2018 rating of 4 stars - I am dropping to 2 stars as the finish on one of the lenses rubbed off after just 3 months of typical use. I have messaged the company and hope they will replace them. Fortunately the original Costa lenses popped right back in, but I sure like the color of these Revant lenses."
2.0,"As other reviews have stated, this A-line &#34;dress&#34; is NOT a dress.  Nor does it fit well.  It's clearly Asian sizing, so for this woman, it didn't fit.  For an XL, it fits quite snug along my torso and barely covers my behind.  If you're petite, this would more than likely work well for you.  If you want the fit of the pictured product, look further.  I was hoping for better.  I'm sure I will find a use for this shirt, probably under a winter vest or sweater.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a reduced cost in exchange for my honest review."
2.0,It's my fault.  Should have ordered smaller size.  I gave them away.
2.0,fits weird in the front and is very sheer
2.0,The first pair fell apart. The replacement was made the same as the first.  These house slippers are not quality products.
2.0,So I love the color and look of this watch but the battery randomly stops working and the watch gets stuck on a time.This happens several times in a 12 hour period. It is very annoying and not worth the purchase IMHO.
2.0,"The pictures show letters printed onto the hat, but it’s actually embroidered. Not necessary a problem… except that the embroidery isn’t done well. Letters on the hat seam are misshaped and their sizing is off from the other letters. The embroidery also isn’t consistent or tight, so there are gaps inside the letters in a few places. All in all, I wish I’d paid less for the hat or bought a different one all together."
2.0,Way too small for an average size woman. No stretch at all.
2.0,I thought there would be more than 2 from the picture looks like lots of colors
2.0,"These gloves are sold as a set which would be fine if they were all the same size. But they are not. The ""set"" consists of three rubber gloves in two different sizes. Only one of the three are small enough for me to be able to use and even thiose are not a small. My glove size is 6.5 or 7. The seller refers to this set as a family product. For this to be usable to me I'd have to be married to Bigfoot. Not happy."
2.0,It was very large. It went over my top lip oddly. Good quality though!
2.0,[[VIDEOID:d076824099227fc068eb1fe03515d6b5]] Some dirty spots I cannot clean - I won’t go through the hazel to return it ! If only the spots not there... it’s cute :/
2.0,The strap broke off the pink one after first use 😔
2.0,"Unfortunately runs too big and too lose, wish I had returned it. I can’t even wear it"
2.0,Arrived with 4inch part of hem not attached to waist area. But pattern of dress is pretty.
2.0,Product also looked like it was not new.
2.0,They look very nice however my daughter wore it to her school dance and the string to tye it with broke after half hour of wearing it.
2.0,"SO HARD TO GET ON  , WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN,"
2.0,"Had to return as it was much too small, regardless of the measurements listed being fine for me.<br />The color is a bit lighter in person and a bit more coppery than brown. It’s pretty. It also came with a g-string (which I was unaware of)."
2.0,"I was terribly disappointed when I tried this on. The material it’s made of, reminded me of those plastic orange bags that you buy oranges at the store in. Very scratchy and definitely not cozy.  The color was off as well and it’s not as long as in the picture. I returned it."
2.0,Very bad quality and huge fit for a small (I have a size 1 in jeans)
2.0,Bad imitation of AF ones in 67
2.0,"Ordered for my sister in her usual size, however the shorts are super small and don't fit. The material isn't very stretchy either so it's not very forgiving. Order at least 2 sizes up or just pick something else"
2.0,Does not fit below my hips as product is pictured. I have a long torso and this just wasn't how I imagined the look to be.
2.0,"My handle came off before using the umbrella....too much of a hasle to return since I disposed the box. Other than that, the fabric is beautiful."
2.0,Everone said that theirs was a little tight. I must have a super small head cause i was swimming in this. Measuring from my chin to the top of my head and around im 22 inches. I was really looking forward to this but it was not what i expected at all.
2.0,Fit too small. Couldn't raise my arms. Too tight. Order the next size up and hope they send you the size you ordered.
2.0,Awkward fit and sheer. Not at all what’s pictured.
2.0,I bought these as I thought they looked warm and comfy and was looking forward to the memory foam. There is no memory foam in the slippers. I have had them 1 week and a half and the material inside the shoe is ripping up. Junk.
2.0,Nice at first but broke quickly
2.0,"Too big for kids, too dumb and cheap for adults. Low quality plastic and giant bugeyes. Not purple lenses"
2.0,It looks cheaper than the one in the preview picture and I had to glue it back together because when it arrived it was falling apart.
2.0,"I bought this because it was a cheap christmas gift and its pretty close to the image. It basically has no stabilizer though so its very flat and it smells very bad. The fur is kinda gross feeling and its not sewed to the rubber on the inside. Also It's kinda hard to see through the nose. But in the end, it was $14 and after a few touchups it was ok."
2.0,"These are not the same as the other goggles in the post.  I thought they were just a different color but if you look closely, or accidentally buy them, you will see that the &#34;Blue/Pink&#34; strap doesn't have the rubber edges that stick out to hold it at a certain tightness, so it gets loose easier.  Also the plastic eye suctions are flimsy and annoying for my daughter compared to the other options listed for the HiCool Swim Goggles.  I also have the blue goggles, yellow goggles, and pink goggles.  Those are much better quality.  I have 4 kids, so I was just trying to differentiate colors for each kid, not get a completely different goggle."
2.0,Is nice but too small is ok thanks
2.0,"This is actually the second time I’ve ordered this skirt, the first being in May 2018. I lost the first one, and reordered here in March 2021. The quality is not what it was last time. The fabric is very cheap feeling, not the deep red it used to be, and I tried to lightly iron out a wrinkle and it MELTED. The fit is beautiful, and the sewing well done. There’s elastic on the back which is great. Pretty disappointed."
2.0,I bought this shirt in both the green and the purple but was unable to wear them because the upper arm area is too tight. I love the design but wish the sizes were true to fit. I typically wear size 14 but purchased the large based on the size chart. I wish I had not waited to long to send them back so now I'm stuck with ill fitting shirts.
2.0,Bought for my boyfriend too small but I like it.
2.0,The dress was very pretty and I really<br />Loved the colors and material but the waist was very tight! I couldn’t breathe.
2.0,"I received the wrong color and the top looks very cheap, so i didn’t wear it. Pants were comfortable though,"
2.0,States USA however they are made in China also ear elastic breaks easily
2.0,I had this connector for less than 2 months when the Ford ring on top broke when I was disconnecting my keys from my back pack.
2.0,I have a big head. I can’t find a hat that fits properly. This one comes close but still squeezes a little. The rim is much shorter than shown in the pictures also.
2.0,Way to big kept sliding off my nose
2.0,"The soccer ball had black discoloring on both sides. It looks damaged or dirty and can't be given as a gift. Unfortunately it's not worth the trouble or cost to return such a small price item, so I will just deal with the loss."
2.0,Does not fits right.
2.0,"I ordered this dress expecting one material and received a velvet dress instead (I hate the feel of velvet clothing). Nowhere in any of the material selections or Q&As did the word “velvet” come up. It’s a very good thing that it’s still cold and velvet will work in this weather, which is the only reason I’m keeping it. I’d return it, but the dress will work for the time being...or it could make a great gift.<br /><br />All in all, the dress is nice...it’s just in a material that wasn’t mentioned in the description and one that I’d never purchase for myself."
2.0,"It was better than expected because of the price. I wore it to work. When I raised my hand, someone told me there was a hole under the arm pits. Disappointed. Can’t wear again."
2.0,"The costume was okay. It shed a lot and it was way too short. I'm only 5'6"" and it fit like capris. The bottom of the pant legs were unfinished so it just looked really messy."
2.0,See above I really like it but didn't stand up to wearing
2.0,"This was a disappointment to me.  It runs small, I believe it's made in China and their sizing is smaller than ours.  So when I ordered the X Large I thought it would fit...not so much. It fits like a medium maybe even a small.  I had to give mine to a friend who wears a x-small to a small and she could fit (it was slightly bigger).  The material is ""slippery"" I think that's the word for it so it would have to either fit just right or fit to big in order for it to stay up (it that makes sense).  Not very happy with the product."
2.0,"While it fit as expected, it was not at all flattering.  Granted, at 5'3 and 150#, I'm not the most svelte of creatures, but I didn't expect it to make me look like a two-ton whale!  Full skirts are not flattering for gals with hips and butts!"
2.0,It was not long enough and the cut and style was way off...did not go off the shoulder at all! Gave it away.
2.0,"This product is cute but the pouch is too wide for chapstick to stay in tightly. If you're using it on a lanyard that will hang from your neck and the pouch will be upright, it should be fine, but as soon as it goes into a purse or bag, the chapstick will likely fall out. If you plan to use in on a keychain, I doubt the chapstick will stay in the pouch."
2.0,the stone in these earring are nice but the wire used to make the product is way to thin and does not hold shape very unhappy with purchase
2.0,"The chart it's wrong , they fit but very tied and I know for sure M it's always fine if not loose on me."
2.0,I like the hate but it was packaged with no padding or protection. The top of the hat was dented in. I returned it because of this.
2.0,"I recommend sizing up if you wish for it to fit nicely and prevent it from giving you a wedgie. The belt died same day i received it, and a hole at the zipper formed after 2 uses."
2.0,Collars are big. Like a strong wind might take you airborne big.
2.0,The material is not to the expectations it's very thin . As for the size it's good.
2.0,I ordered this blouse in two different colors coral and royal blue but when I received them I found that they are not short sleeved they are sleeveless therefore should be described as such. I bought these blouses with the intentions of wearing them to work now I am unable to do so without wearing a sweater. Buyers beware.
2.0,The seems came apart in the waist where the draw string should be encapsulated by the fabric.
2.0,"I previously ordered the pants and loved them so much I wanted capris too. Unfortunately, the Capri material was scratchy and uncomfortable and I already have a ran hole in the crotch seam that I don't have in the pants and I have worn the pants much more. Disappointed in this purchase!"
2.0,too large am<br />nd BIG!!!!!
2.0,"The earrings are way bigger than pictured. They are as big as my ear lobe, nothing like as advertised in the pictures.  I only ordered them because I thought they were very tiny and that's the look I was going for. I give two stars for the quick shipping and nice packaging."
2.0,Different fabric. Didnt like. Fits small.
2.0,Item is short
2.0,This is a very cute short dress and it would be great for me if it was made out of a lighter material like cotton. I returned it for just that reason. Living in the middle of the state of Florida pretty much makes impossible for me to wear anything heavy.
2.0,"Good concept, but the spandex section of the wallet separated from the metal that was supposed to keep the wallet together.  I still use the wallet, but have to ensure all my belongings are covered by stretching the spandex section of the wallet over the contents."
2.0,Picture color doesn't match actual color.
2.0,It looks really pretty
2.0,"Cute but runs extremely short, don't think nightgown think night shirt"
2.0,This suit was super cute but it was way too tight on my thighs and the cups for the breasts were way too small. I was very disappointed!
2.0,This ring is teeny weeny.  I'm giving it a friend's little girl.
2.0,The seam that is indicated by the point of the knife in the picture is right at your bottom and it wants to creep up. Enough said.
2.0,It’s great but the necklace came in broke
2.0,"very cheap made,fell apart...didn't even last through the night! the feathers kept falling off of the boa,and shedding all over."
2.0,This jacket is clearly designed for a man and not a woman with curves. Did not fit correctly at all. The description said it was a 3 in 1 jacket so I assumed that the inner layer could be detached. It could not. It appeared to be a very warm coat but for skiing I wanted to be able to adjust as needed for weather and I could not. It is being returned.
2.0,"It’s okay, not something I’d wear around were I live lol but I will wear it to Mexico  in October , the seen is definitely noticeable and it feels like polyester fabric"
2.0,"This shirt is cute, but fits weird. Does Not like on model."
2.0,"This top is very cute! I like the style and the fabric is nice and soft. I also like the wrinkly look of it, it feels very cozy. The reason I only gave it two stars is because of the fit, it is terrible! The shirt is very wide and short, I know that it is a loose style but it is so short, I would say go up 2 sizes to be able to wear it. We will have to pass it on to a younger girl as it is very short and looks awkward."
2.0,This bra fit perfectly but after washing the padding moves ALOT. It’s a hassle to straighten out and it’s flimsy and ripped after second or third time wearing and adjusting the padding.
2.0,"I am 5'4""  135 lbs.  The dress was way to long as I would have to wear heels.  I squeezed in but the arm rings were to small.  I'm sure it will look great on some other body type.  I could order a large but I dont want to hem it. Good luck!"
2.0,I bought this back in October and it was working great. Recently it will die quickly after a night or 2 and I have to have sit plugged in for a while day and it will barley charge. Tonight I took it off the charger and it was at 36%(after having it charge over 12 hours) and it's already dropped to 27%. If course I'm just outside the window to do a return/replace so there goes the money I spent on this.
2.0,Too big for the tagged size
2.0,I'm not satisfied with the products
2.0,One of the wings that holds the locket closed fell off after only wearing it a couple times.
2.0,They fit and are comfortable but are extremely thin and see through.
2.0,Great look to them but one came broken.
2.0,Runs very small. Didn’t fit my 9 year old who is a below average size.
2.0,Cute but there is thick stitching on the inside that was very uncomfortable for my child and the lining sheds. We returned it.
2.0,The print was different from the picture. Not what I expected at all
2.0,did not look good on me
2.0,"These are ok......not warm at all very sheer. A bit thicker than panty hose. They are supposed to be plus sized and if you have thicker thighs, save your money, because all they do is roll down your legs. Company sent them out quickly, but I will not buy them again!"
2.0,Very beautiful but the Beats all out within a week should have been a better way that the bead was held in
2.0,"These are excellent sunglasses but suffer from very fragile temples.  The manufacturer does not sell repair parts so breaking the very thin temple wastes the whole pair of sunglasses.  With available replacement temples, I would have rated them five stars, but three pairs needing a temple have frustrated me -- at least I have replacement lenses if I break a lens!"
2.0,Waistband is garbage it turned and it ripped at the seams
2.0,"Just received my cover up and I'm disappointed. It's ripped in several places and I can't believe they didn't see it before they package it! I leave for Dominican Republic in a few days and this sucks. However,  It does fit nicely,  but I'm returning. Btw it's not exactly white."
2.0,Brackets came and some were defective. The string was on the outside of the bead.
2.0,"These earrings are HUGE and HEAVY. Very uncomfortable to wear, will have to repurpose as necklace."
2.0,You said two pack...I bought two expecting to receive 4 tank tops....aaaaand I got 2
2.0,Too small. Contacted company inquiring about larger size . No response
2.0,DO NOT BUY. This is NOT a sweatshirt. It’s the cheapest polyester on the planet and shiny. My boyfriend asked if I was going fishing soon… What a rip off.  Also it wouldn’t let me give this one star for some reason that’s why I did two.
2.0,"the mask is soft. I joked and said it felt like half a bra cup lol. In any case, My design came out dull, and not like the preview I was shown, I attached a side by side of what the preview looks like versus what I received. It seems to b e a nice quality mask, I just wish my logo looked like it was supposed to."
2.0,This should not be considered a sweatshirt. It’s super thin. The design is ok. Definitely not what I expected. Bad purchase. You should ask the seller if the sweatshirt is thick or light before you but.
2.0,"I don't know,, that buckle doesn't come undone so easily, know what I mean? So if you gotta go badly be prepared! I wont use it"
2.0,"Ordered my reg size and wouldn't have been able to fit the bra area if I'd tried.  Gave away to a lady who was much smaller , she likes it."
2.0,Diamonds maybe. Gold tone over silver looks like cheap brass.
2.0,"This is a pretty good shirt, seems well made, fits OK, but the color is not as pictured.  It has more of a muted, muddy look. Doubt I will wear it out except to run errands."
2.0,Material was very thin.  I've washed them 3 times and the seam is already pulling apart.
2.0,I did not like the fabric. I returned the item.
2.0,"It would fit fine if it weren't for my breasts. I'm a 36H size XL/14, which is what I bought and it did not fit my chest at all! Otherwise really cute, just beware if you have larger breasts."
2.0,Got to different plugs one is opal the other is very clear and milky
2.0,Really cute and well made but too small.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:6cc3a1a70d65ccb3ce242e35358e639b]] I was so excited about this shirt. It is a Christmas gift. When I started to pull the parch paper off it was stuck to the letter. Once I pulled it all off there was still some left on the letters.
2.0,"These masks are great, for my 8 year old (slightly taller than average size, and not chunky at all). It is so frustrating trying to find a good cotton mask that actually fits the way it is supposed to. These are not marked as children's masks, but they should be, and that is a huge disappointment.<br />The star rating is purely because I bought these for myself and can't wear them, but they do seem well made."
2.0,"Would have fit my rear if it fit over my thighs. Sizing chart is way off. Too bad, would've been nice to properly test."
2.0,They were packaged so right that when I received them one of the lenses were cracked and another pair had the lense popped out....1 out of 3 is ok I guess but not what was expected
2.0,Cute earrings but my daughter wore a pair twice and the sparkly part fell off the metal backing already
2.0,I ordered this shirt twice based off of the size chart..i am 5 foot 8..147lbs..i usually wear small to medium shirts. I ordered the medium first and then a large..they are both too tight.
2.0,"Way too small for an adult face (and this is coming from someone who has such a small head that she sometimes wears childrens hats/glasses). It fit ok when I initially put it on but as soon as I opened my mouth to talk the whole thing shifted down my face and off my nose. It performed a bit better when worn upside down, but then didn'y fully cover my chin which isn't ideal."
2.0,"Recirvev this today, I honestly believe that the strap would be in the same material as the bag, the bag looks cheap."
2.0,I ordered size small and it was too big. I'm 132 lbs 5'4&#34;
2.0,Much shorter around the belly than the picture describes. Was very disappointed and ended up returning it.
2.0,So first off the outfit was 0 to 6 months and could literally fit my 3 year old.. secondly the bowtie is bright red and the pants are deep burgendy.. it looks tacky and is waaaaay too big. I'm going to try and get my money back wish me luck... I'll update on how the seller deals with this...<br /><br />Update... even though the product was not what I wanted the seller responded in less than 24 hours and offered a 70% refund along with me keeping the outfit for when he gets bigger... I'm happy with this because maybe I can use different pants with it
2.0,"Fits half a size to small. The material is 100% polyester, with that plastic like feel, not for  me, it's not as soft as a cotton blend material would be."
2.0,It's pretty tiny and the bill is incredibly weird at least it was when it arrived also you have to sign for this product for whatever reason it is an incredible Hassle and be prepared for that
2.0,"I can't complain too much. For $35 I can't expect the quality of my other well designed watches. Although first appearance it seems like a solid watch...Since all the abbreviations for each month didn't fit they are printed at an angle and different size font to cram it in, It looks ridiculous. And the dial on the left-hand side doesn't move.  And I don't care what items I purchase I like some kind of directions when it comes to the function of any product regardless of how simple and self explanatory it may be.  Search for naked watch if you want a watch worth buying."
2.0,Returned.  Too large and heavy for me
2.0,"This suit was nicely made, but too big and not supportive at all. I sent it back."
2.0,much smaller than it appears.
2.0,If you have a small head it will not fit well. Speakers are very uncomfortable. Like old school walkman speakers. Sound quality is ok.
2.0,Too long and too deep for v cut
2.0,Way too small for me! Going to try 2 sizes up
2.0,Nice colors but it looked cheap. I don't even wear it.
2.0,Cute but not very sturdy. I don’t think it will be able to carry a lot and that’s disappointing.
2.0,this product no had a good quality
2.0,Material was cheap. And it was huge. I ordered a medium and it was more like XL. I gave it to a friend.
2.0,It would be cute if they had not put some sequin flakes on top of Pearls.
2.0,"cheaply made, came unraveled at the top ofthe mitten cover. the Piece that holds the mitten part back brake off as well, which left it just flapping around."
2.0,Cute print. Poor quality and fit. He wasn't even finished
2.0,The fabric is so thin and very polyester like similar to the ones used in plastic kite feel. The print is beautiful though. But it would not absorb sweat at all.
2.0,"I ordered the 22mm,and the watch stap I recieved was supposed to be the 22mm. This watch stap has a 24mm quick release lug and will not fit any 22mm watch."
2.0,"I'm not a fan. From the top of my legs down there great. From there up. Not so much. There is not any support, the waist band twisted before I got them all the way on. If the band was attached to the fabric and matched the size it would be a huge improvement. If I could return them I would."
2.0,I was in the library and the zipper popped right open under my shirt. This happened with all of them more than once. Fabric itched a lot. Two stars because I liked the colors.
2.0,"Clingy material,  runs a bit small, and shorter than the picture suggest"
2.0,"I ordered a small, but it is still too loose for my wrist"
2.0,"I was disappointed to find this bra was too tight over the shoulders and the cups were poorly sized for a larger breast (DD). I was fully expecting a snug, supportive fit, but this was just the wrong size all around. That being said, don't lose faith - I ordered a different style bra (medium impact full figure) from the same manufacturer and it was an excellent fit! It may just be that this style needs some re-engineering."
2.0,"I was so excited to receive this bracelet.  It is very cute, but only wore it twice and it has completely turned and is no longer wearable."
2.0,not stretchy
2.0,When I took the protector plastic off it took some of the paint off. Not very happy considering the price I paid for it.  Also the hooks are pretty cheap and flimsy.
2.0,"It's cheap material, frumpy and the strap is awful. I thought it may look cute, but it is just the cheapest of nylon straps, same as the cheap belt.<br /><br />The zipper is cheap, but fine teeth  so it binds up, no hook at the top of the zipper makes it harderb to zip up. The pleats are weak.<br /><br />I wouldn't get this again. I paid about 20 but i wouldn't have paid more than 5 at a thrift store for this in person."
2.0,It was expected to fit much better than it did.
2.0,Meant for really skinny fingers
2.0,"I have using it less than a mont and it has a hole in the water bottle pocket and I had to sew one of suspenders, it never had more that at least 2 lt and it is break ... In the pictures I put a little bottle so you can see the big hole it has just to put a water bottler there, one picture of the part that I had to sew and another one so you can see that is the same backpack, not resistant at all."
2.0,Product is ok for the price but quality control is poor. I ordered 2 and both had scratches and blemishes that are manufacturing defects on the lenses.
2.0,"Okay for the price, the gold buttons and strap off the front came off within hours. But still usable."
2.0,Too big for me! nicely packaged and good finish though.
2.0,"Very strange fit around arms. Size was fine, it just came in from armpits really far."
2.0,They were ok for the price but 2 of them were missing one of the jewels on each but for the price they will work
2.0,I love the outfit in general but when I girls mine the belt loops were broken
2.0,It advertises 2-pack but only one came. I returned it.
2.0,Although very cute this is not going to hold up with much wear.  Even though the price was low I did not expect such a low quality item.
2.0,Good heavy material.  Pockets for radial arms are too deep on tight fitting top making it difficult to install umbrella canopy. The diameter of canopy was too small for our 9 foot diameter frame. As a result one arm was broken trying to fit the canopy on. having the big deep pockets for the arms added to the difficulty and caused the one arm to be broken.
2.0,It was too stiff and doesn't fit well. It was very pretty other than that.
2.0,It’s not the cotton material it looks like in the photo it’s wearable but it’s more of a silk looking material which makes it look more dressy than casual my opinion I wouldn’t Order again but I was able to make it work for that day
2.0,Product is not as advertised. Flares are so wide I could barely get them in or out. Would not recommend this.
2.0,"Cheap material. You can see through it, which I didn’t like and doesn’t seem like it will last long. Fit was as expected and the colors were as expected. I wished I had saved my money and bought something different."
2.0,"Maybe put the actual size in numbers instead of small, medium, large and extra large."
2.0,Nice hat but not what I ordered! Deceiving!
2.0,"The gloves itself is not very warm. Even with the power on, your fingers still get cold due to lack of insulation in the fingers.  Nice big batteries, nice temperature color controls.  Both gloves ran out of battery power when the indicator showed 50%."
2.0,"Was looking for a cheap substitute for an otterbox so I rolled the dice on this. Overall was too bulky for my tastes, the plugs for the ports needed some serious persuasion to go in."
2.0,Product is a little small. Don't think it is true to sizing. Took forever to get them. Not worth returning.
2.0,I love the style of the jacket but it fits too tight (and I went up one size). I also had issues with the sticking on one of the sleeves.
2.0,Its not the color I expected
2.0,Long story short tried them out as soon as I got them and was not impressed.  They jave a little give in them so they stretch when going on but once on they are hard to adjust snug with one hand.
2.0,"It is a lovely watch band. Unfortunately, one side simply would not connect to my Gear S2. I managed to attach the other side and reattach the original band multiple times, so I don't think it was user error.  As I was giving up and putting it back in the box, the buckle broke."
2.0,"I used it for stand one umbrella with base ...it started leaking from outlet lids as soon as I fill even half the capacity. Another issue is , it takes kind of round edged shape when filled completely with water.. it would then tilt to one side if umbrella is moving due to wind. Yes um rella would never fall because this base becomes really heavy after filling to top but umbrella would tilt to one side"
2.0,"After being promised 110 pieces of jewelry I only recieved 80 and tried to contact the seller to let them know the mistake with my order. They never emailed me back even after multiple tries. Very comfortable jewelry, just not very durrable. I have had all of the dice balls on my eyebrow piercing break within a week of me wearing it. The simple metal rings are amazing for more fancy occasions and i love the different patterns. But i sadly  would not recomend this to my friends due to the lack of communication."
2.0,This dress is super sexy... but you can see every lump and bump on your body in it.  Maybe a different color would have been better since I ordered it in white.
2.0,Way too smaller
2.0,It’s very thine
2.0,"They fit fine and feel fine but the material is questionable, it makes noise when you walk...I was hoping for a dressier quality.. they look the part, but don't expect to feel like you would in a nice pair of slacks"
2.0,It looks and feels like slick plastic! It is somewhat bulky and so far has not began to shape. I have been considering throwing it the washing machine for a couple of cycle to see if I can get the it to act like leather instead of plastic.
2.0,"I bought Black&stripe, 3 Pairs . Poor quality. Not good enough for winter."
2.0,"It’s super cute, however, the ruffles didn’t lay straight. They kept flipping up."
2.0,Does not work as a strapless bra. Without the straps the cups hang off of you.
2.0,the speakers are attached with Velcro and a very weak glue so the speakers came loose and would not stay in place. The place where you plug in the charger is poor quality. I can no longer charge the unit because the charger cord will not connect. Waste of money
2.0,I've only had it for a few days. It keeps good time and the looks work well for dress casual.<br /><br />EDIT: Stopped working after less than a week.
2.0,The color makes a kid happy. This product is thin and cannot be used outside of summer. Also not very durable after two washes its torn.
2.0,"This cap should come in small, medium & large. Maybe even extra large."
2.0,Had to return it.  Looked really weird
2.0,zippers don't work very well
2.0,"As soon as I put this on, I noticed the nylon feel to it. It is NOT a comfortable feel. I also noticed it may be a 4XL in length, it's very snug around the waist so I guess ""classic fit"" (even in a big & tall shirt) to Haggar means narrow. I COULD wear this shirt, but won't unless I lose some weight and even then, the material isn't very comfortable."
2.0,"Good gloves for the price.  The grip enhancing weave on the palm / fingers however frayed and wore off on day 1 of actually using these gloves.  They're still warm though.  Whatever your normal glove size is, I would recommend ordering 1 size smaller for these.  They're very bulky which makes dextrous work like grabbing screws and using a drill very difficult.  But they are warm, and that makes them better than doing that same work with frozen fingers.  In hind sight, I would have kept shopping around for a better pair of gloves to use for working outside in the winter, but I'm not completely disappointed with them.  Like I said, they are good for their price point."
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress, but it's faulty. The zipper doesn't go all the way to the top and then the sewing doesnt reach the zipper! There's a random hole in the lace on my back so it's being returned.<br /><br />If you're very handy with a sewing machine, take a chance on it, because it is really cute."
2.0,Ordered gold tone got the silver instead
2.0,Rough edges
2.0,"They're not waterproof...I had leakage after 2 days during bluebird conditions.<br /><br />Very nice build quality but why would you make a ski glove that is not waterproof.  Get the Seth Morrison version if you can afford it, otherwise look elsewhere."
2.0,"I'm 5'2, 125lbs and ordered a Medium. It fit but sleeves are too short. I guess thats the way its supposed to be but now that I'm a mom, I felt like a clown in this.  Now that I'm older (34), I'm all about fewer items in real good quality and to me it looks and feels cheap. Not for me but I can see how it would be perfect for a 20something year old."
2.0,I was really disappointed in this dress. It's BRIGHT red (nothing like the photo) and it was really large compared to the size guide and did not fit well.
2.0,Things are barely visible with these glasses on
2.0,I can only wear 2 of the 4 chokers. I had to give the other 2 away as they were very very small for my neck.<br /><br />I did have to use a straight iron to straighten out the bow tie choker so it would lay nicely and not all kinked up.
2.0,"I bought and extra large and it's a small or medium at best. There are really cute styles on Amazon right now but the sizes are crazy. If they were sized like American sizes, I bet they would sell like crazy.  I am sad because this top is so cute, it's just 3 sizes smaller than what it says."
2.0,Runs small!! And short!! Not what I was expecting
2.0,Muy mala calidad de la tela y la costura .<br />No lo recomiendo para nada .
2.0,It fits the materials are rough and cut into you skin.
2.0,The price was close to the same but the quality was not the same as the last order I had of Polar Extreme socks .  They are nice but disappointing.
2.0,poor quality but great for one time use in a costume
2.0,"Cute bathing suit. I'm 5'5, 115lbs, 32 C, small bottom with some hips. The top fit. The bottoms would have fit but the fabric is loose and baggy due to the making them reversible. The front side of the fabric isn't connected to the back reversible side. The seams around the waist and legs is not  stiched like a normal bathing suit and billowy. It allows the fabric to be loose at the edges and lay on the body oddly. The fabric everywhere else is baggy and loose because each side isn't connected to the other side.  Wish they didn't have reversible bottoms and Or made them connected like it was made on one piece of  fabric."
2.0,Colorful but much to stretchy.
2.0,Child/Asian sizing. Gave the XL to my young daughter.
2.0,"I've had these pajamas now for about two months was absolutely in love with them they fit perfect they're made well they're warm! And then it started hundreds of little balls all over the fabric everything sticks to them hairs, feathers, lint stuff.  The only way to get the fuzzies (pills) off of the fabric is to either shave the fabric or get some really sticky tape. Each time I wash them they get worse."
2.0,This was really cute but runs really small
2.0,"It is nice to have a regular band again, however one piece of the band will not clip into the device properly. This has caused me to almost loose my watch on multiple occasions. I ended up having to order a new one and once again stop wearing my watch in the mean time. Save yourself the time and order a decent band."
2.0,"Cute & good fit, but super itchy. Could barely keep it on for a few minutes."
2.0,Had his for a month and I've already lost a zipper ... will try to repair this myself and will update this review if the bag continues to deteriorate
2.0,These don’t stay up
2.0,"The original listed price shows $116.00.  Sorry to say, it should be $6.00.  The ring looks very cheap. It looks suited for young girls/teens."
2.0,Beautiful style! But they lack in quality...If it was not such a hassel I would request a refund..My boots actually looked worn and tattered near the zipper.
2.0,"a little dissappointed, thin material and  one arm is stretched out."
2.0,"Very nice earrings. However, they are very delicate and they break easy. When applying,the back piece broke and I can't use them no longer. The metal is too soft."
2.0,"I wear a Med in all other leggings. I ordered a Large thinking it would run small based on where they were coming from. These were so small that I could not get them up much passed my mid thigh. I question if they would have fit if I ordered an XL. The company was good about crediting me back, hence the second star."
2.0,"The color and size was nice, but both earrings came cracked."
2.0,"This dress definitely runs small in the chest, and I don't feel it's made that well.  I use it around the house so I kept it for just that.  I couldn't wear this out in public anywhere."
2.0,"Isn't the point of a zip-up style boot like this that you dont have to tie the dang things everytime you put them on? You tie them once to your comfort, then zip them the rest of their life? Well you can't do that with these. You still have to loosen the laces in order to get them on your dang feet, even with the zipper down. Maybe if you like your boots super loose you'd be able to leave them tied, but that defeats the purpose of a high top boot if you ask me.<br />  They seem fine as far as boots in this price range go, if you pretend there's no zipper. I've worn them to work for a week. Seems to be some kind of faux leather, probably won't last very long. I havent got any blisters of foot pains, so that's good.<br />Edit: zipper burst on the 3rd day. Returned them."
2.0,"This is hyped up alot. I got it and the L/XL Was way too big so I called and they were nice enough to send a Small/med. Which fit nicely but it doesn't stay on very well while sleeping. Yes, it lays down your waves but messes up the sides of your head above the ears my waves were all jacked up. I just went back to my original du-rag and unrolled the tie strings so they laid flat across my forehead. I'll probably just give the tsurag to my daughter's who rock braids cuz it'd not cool for me. Mind you...I put it in above my ears and over my ears to see if it would make a difference."
2.0,Perry dress but very fitted. Not good for anyone with curves or a tummy.
2.0,Was too small all around.  Fit like a belly shirt
2.0,"The frame is STIFF and has very little if any flexibility, the glare reduction is top shelf , they will be staying in the boat, time will tell how long they can be worn,  comfortably.  *** Update , I have owned them just a few weeks and the right lens has cracked already, right next to where it attaches to the frame, I know I didn't sit on them since I kept them on my dash in my car.  They were NOT very comfortable anyway (way too stiff, no flex at all, also a bit too heavy) so I would have probably just given them away. You get what you pay for, applies here. ***"
2.0,Too big. Don’t really like how huge They look on my ears but I’m too lazy to return them.
2.0,The circle was too big and the bar wasn't gold it was silver.
2.0,Did not know that the bottoms where a little cheeky. the cups on the top were a little big but manageable. And what appeared to me as a coral is more orance and what appeared to be grey on the bottoms is navy blue. not what i expected. but i can deal with it.
2.0,"I bought these in XXX-Large hoping they would in some way be sufficient at providing a slight amount of coverage and support for my 38G chest. While I am a bit on the flubby side, I normally wear shirts & tank tops a few sizes smaller than a XXXL. I was really looking for a padded tank top for sleeping in that was kinda long, would keep the girls wrangled in, & wouldn't roll up my stomach to my chest while I slept. The positive reviews on these tank tops made me hopeful I had found what I was looking for, but when they arrived, I was horribly disappointed!! The sizing didn't seem to indicate that I was actually ordering a child's size XXXL, but that's about how big these tank tops are... they are so unbelievably small!! The padded cups cover about 1/3 of a breast each, are just sorta there and provide absolutely zero support. Other than that, these tank tops are pretty tight & super short.<br />Thank goodness I just wear these tank tops under my pajamas, but even then they're incredibly irritating because they do exactly what I didn't want my pajama tank tops to do! I had really hoped for something looser & longer with just a tiny bit more coverage & support."
2.0,Words are cut off. Very disappointed.
2.0,My daughter is 6 years old. She’s 4’1” tall.<br />I purchased size L (which is 3’9”-4’2”) and it turns out very loose; especially neck.<br />I guess it was designed for fat kids.
2.0,"The ring was very pretty,however I did return it because I wore the ring for 3 days and it turned my finger green and the silver wore off, it does NOT state that it is plated .... I could have went to Walmart and got this ring for 10$ if I wanted my finger to turn green in 3 days."
2.0,Really couldn't smell the candle was dissapointed
2.0,Did not receive the size ordered. Would have been great for my daughter but sadly they will not fit her as they fit my adult feet.
2.0,They fit as expected and where comfy. I just wouldn't wear them in public because they give me a camel toe. The front is sewed weirdly that it does that. Comfy but not a go out in public or gym shorts.
2.0,"The graphic looks good, but it's a thin, cheap material - and weirdly stiff."
2.0,"This is NOT leather. The &#34;leather&#34; edge on the handles peeled off, it is rubber!. I like the color but I paid for LEATHER"
2.0,"They even ""sound"" cheap when you take them out of the package and open them up. Cheap plastic, great lenses. Spend less on the huge zippered case and invest more in a better frame. I like the look and yes the lenses are clear and work wonderfully,  I can just tell by the plastic these wont last long. Would not recommend.  No real value for the $$$."
2.0,"I've bought many of these in the past, and all the old ones had collars that were made of a sturdier material than the shirt so they could retain shape. The new ones are weak and flap around wildly, almost feels like the exact material the rest of the shirt was made with.  If you want to sit still and look alright, this will work. If you go outside, move at all, think about moving, the collar is going to flap around."
2.0,It will lose itself. Just gets lose in places you ain't want.
2.0,Very sharp and uncomfortable posts.
2.0,"They run large! Be aware that when you need to exchange or return YOU are responsible for the charge of sending them back. Amazon will not back you up on this one. I’m so disappointed in the whole process; I’ve ordered many HUE leggans and these were a big mistake! They are not that good looking for the money and the hassle, beware."
2.0,Maybe I'm stupid but I can't keep it on for more than an hour or two
2.0,"I did not expect the material to be so slinky. It shows up all my curves so much that I decided not to wear it out as I'd originally planned. Plus, the straps are like nightie or bra straps, so it gives a nightgown feel."
2.0,took three weeks to get it and its realy cheeply made and cheep looking
2.0,The fabric is very soft and love the pockets... I’m 5’6 and it is a very weird legth on me.  It hits about 2 inches below my knee.  Not sure if I’ll keep it or not.
2.0,I ordered these to wear to an upcoming party. I got the white pants...... and they were so thin I could see my skin and everything I had on through them which means everybody else can as well. I love the fit and the shape but I have to return them.
2.0,To small but ok
2.0,"This product was not what I expected; although, to be clear, I'm not sure what I wanted either.  However, this product is not practical if you are going to carry more than just a few cards and don't plan on having to take them out very often."
2.0,Bummed this bracelet doesn’t stay on. Clasp slides apart. Thankfully I’ve caught it when it falls.
2.0,"Has weird smell, also seems cheaply made"
2.0,Too small and material not what I expected
2.0,"Color is terrible. Didn't look like in the picture at all. Comfy, but will only wear it around the house..."
2.0,Weird fit. The top band is way too tight and the bottom part is loose. Would not recommend to anyone with any sort of belly.
2.0,Couldn't see through the glasses so had to wear them on low on my nose and basically look over them while in costume. They were prettt sturdy though.
2.0,"I normally wear a women’s large, I bought a women’s 2xl wanting it to be loose and it barley fits at all :("
2.0,Bought Medium for my son.  Shirt was way too small - like a Youth Medium...  and not great quality.  Shirt was returned.
2.0,"2/5/2023 Update:  I have one pair left of the six pairs that I have purchased. I really wanted to like them, because they're breathable and comfortable until they break. But in every case, the heel separates and a hole is born. Even the one remaining pair is showing signs that it won't be with me much longer. It's only the heel--the rest of the sock is like new--but it's uncomfortable to wear socks with your heel sticking out.<br />- - -<br />I really love these socks, except for the weak point, as can be seen in the photo. The heel separates in the lengthwise ribbed pattern, causing a hole in the heel. I wear them with a variety of shoes, so the shoe is not to blame. If the manufacturer could design the heel a little differently or reinforce it somehow so this didn't happen, I'd give the product a 5-star rating, but as it is, I feel that I'm being very generous with the 4 stars!  The socks are breathable and cool, and comfortable and soft. Please beef up that heel somehow, or include patching instructions!"
2.0,I used to wear size 6. I ordered size 8 too tide for chest and arms can’t zip up. My wedding is very close no time to alter it. That’s the only reason to return it. Not bad quality.
2.0,"It's a great looking hat, and seems to be very well made. However, I was sent the wrong size (7 1/2 instead of 7 5/8), hence the score. So I cannot attest to the fitment, however I would say that for a 7 1/2, it looks like it was made for a child. Other reviewers are probably correct in their assessment of these hats running small."
2.0,Thai item was a different color than what is displayed. They had a grey band and grey stripes down the side.
2.0,"I ordered my size according to their sizing chart, but the fit was still a little small.  No washing instructions on the tag, so I washed it as I normally do any new clothing item.....it shrunk.  Really cute shirt, but they should include washing instructions and the size chart should be adjusted."
2.0,"Didn't stay on my wrist correctly, messed up the heart beat and footsteps"
2.0,"It had a broken spot on one of the shoes. 😕 My son likes them. He wore has other pair out, he wore them so much."
2.0,Color of belt is nowhere close to the picture. The metal loop insert color doesn’t match the main belt or the belt buckle in color.
2.0,Kind of disappointed with the size
2.0,The XL was like an Xsmall.  These pants run very small
2.0,"the back was really scratched up, its as light as a feather, and the material feels very cheap. hardly worth $10."
2.0,"I wish they would've put a picture of what It actually looked like, or maybe mine is just defective? It has a black background in between the images which is quite ugly and makes it look cheap. Not happy with it"
2.0,"I did absolutely love the style of this band, I received so many compliments on it. But the band didn’t stay together long, the screws on the side holding the Fitbit in the cage kept unscrewing, there were a few times I almost lost my brand new Fitbit. Eventually after a few months it broke and I couldn’t find one of the screws, if they fixed that part then I would buy another one."
2.0,The flimsy wire over thenose break and poke you
2.0,I ordered this dress in a 4 (according to the measurements provided). It should have been slightly big but easy enough to fix. I received the dress and it was SO TIGHT. I looked at the label and they had accidentally sent a 2. Replacement came very fast. I checked the new dress and the label said it was correct. No way! It was EVEN smaller than the first dress. No way these dresses are consistent in their sizing. Returning again. Hate it because the dress is really lovely.
2.0,"Updated with picture of only 4 days of wearing<br /><br />Thought I would hear from someone but nothing.<br /><br />The package arrived as expected and at first glance,  these bands appear sturdy and classy. Very heavy, so you think lasting.  I got these last week, had my hubby put the all rose gold band on Sunday, and here it is Thursday and the band rise gold color is already rubbing off. I don't wear all day and I sit at a desk, doing nothing strenuous nor do I wear working out or get it wet. This band is 4 days old on my wrist and it is already showing rub off. It's not alot but enough to know it's happening and will only get worse. Now I know scuffs happen and eventually rub off will occur, but 4 days of wear and its already showing?<br /><br />I loved that the bands came so easy to use and with all I needed to put onto watch face. Easy, very explanatory and loved it came with the screen protector. Just disappointed in the rub off. I can't say I would recommend this to someone.  I realize it's very great price, but I still expected more longevity before I saw this happen."
2.0,I ordered a large and it looked like a small
2.0,Not bad. Fits ok and fine just to hang out in. Dont love it.
2.0,Looks great and received a lot of compliments however they provide no arch support. I work in an office and sit most of the day. My feet were killing me by day 3 of wearing these into the office. I would also be afraid of wearing these in the winter or any wet pavement as the bottom has zero tread.
2.0,"I usually wear a medium or a large in shirts.  I am 5'4"" and 142 pounds with a 36D bra.  If I think something will be tight, I order up.  I was worried that this might be, so I ordered a large.  I wanted it to look like the model, loose and a bit  long. When I got it, I almost laughed.  It was sooo wide and short.  I put it on, and I could pull about four inches on both sides of my waist.  It sat on my hips too.  I threw it away. Do not size up, and even then, I think this might just be an unflattering shirt.  I am not sure the medium would have looked good either."
2.0,"Too big sent it back, seemed ok otherwise was as described."
2.0,The sweater was too small - gave it to a granddaughter. She was thrilled!
2.0,"I am very sad.I love the look and feel of the bracelet, however, the clasp is difficult to open and I am afraid that I will break it if i force it  So I have to say they need to work on that. I bought it for a gift for my aunt who has lupus.  Purple is the color for lupus and i wanted to present it to her as a support piece of jewelry. It came really fast which is great, but i dont think i can give it to her since i cant open it, i know she will have a hard time with her arthritis."
2.0,I have problems with my right foot/ankle. These are okay for summer when it is too hot to wear knee socks. They feel too tight on the right ankle.
2.0,There’s no silver stamp on the ring and it’s very big real upset after what i was so excited to wear it 😏😒
2.0,Size of hat was perfect BUT the bill was TOO long
2.0,"This is not the officially licensed pin, so the dimensions will be off. This pin is more narrow from the front than the officially licensed one, and it is noticeably different.<br /><br />The officially licensed one is 11.99 at the time of this review, and this one is the same price.<br /><br />Spend the same money and get one that looks more polished/correct."
2.0,size too small; not clear from the Amazon write-up
2.0,A rustic pewter looking charm. Not as shinny as picture. Hard to tell the shape of a dragon and the two tone color. Look like boat anker.
2.0,"Upon taking it out the wrapping, I was sad to see a small hole in my otherwise perfect pink athleisure jacket. I was hopeful that it was just a small snag of the fabric that I could simply cut off, but alas, it is an actual hole. Hopefully I can exchange it because it really is a cute and flattering jacket."
2.0,Is okay very thin and see thru. You will have to wear something under it. It took longer than expected to arrive didn’t get to wear for the day I wanted to
2.0,"It is an off-white color pinkish hue, and not in the way you would want. When I received it, my first thought was this color reminds me of when I wash a white shirt with red shirt, where some of the dye rubs onto the white shirt. It is also really see-through and ran on the larger side for me. I ordered a medium when I’m usually a small and it felt like a large.<br /><br />The best part of this shirt is that it’s quite comfortable. However, I think I will be returning this since it wasn’t as expected."
2.0,"Took one of them on a recent trip to Europe. Bag arrived in Europe with belt - all good. On the way home, had to pick up our bag during a layover. Belt was undone but still wrapped around luggage. Readjusted belt to make sure it fit well and snug before the flight home. Bag arrived home without the belt.<br /><br />Bottom line: worked well for 1/3 flights. Lost it on the last of 3 flights."
2.0,"It’s so short, I’m 5’9”. This barely covered my bottom.  Soft and fitting otherwise, would have loved it if it was longer."
2.0,All corners of case are cracked. Rectangular panel on top of case is split entirely on one side.
2.0,Does not really work
2.0,Sizes are way off! I had to return them right after I got them. I got a 0g but it was way bigger than my gauge size.
2.0,"Overall I like the fit of the bra, but after wearing it only a few times it looks terrible. It's fuzzy and catches fuzz. The seam around the bottom is also coming undone. After every wear I find strings hanging I have to cut off. It's definitely just a t-shirt stay at home bra now."
2.0,Broke shortly after purchasing. I wore it once and it was cute while it lasted.
2.0,"I don't like these glasses but not because they are badly constructed.  In fact, they seem very well constructed and come with a case and soft cloth to clean them with.  My problem is that they are just freaking ugly.  I put them on and my husband says I look like some alien insect from outer space.  And after looking in the mirror I had to agree with him.  All that said, they felt very comfortable on my face and I just wish they weren't so big and freaky looking."
2.0,It is a cool shirt but I did not realize how different the sizes were and that it was shipping from china.
2.0,They were flimsy and not good quality at all. Mine were sort of bent when I got them also.
2.0,"This Bathing suit fit way too small. Got a size Medium. I'm 5'4, 120 lbs. wear size 2 dress and 26 pants. usually wear size small in everything. It's a super cute bathing suit though! does not come with boob padding. I think if I got a XLarge it would have fit me perfectly. Size Up.. Gave to my gf, she's my size, was small on her also."
2.0,"GREAT QUALITY. However, there is a reason the models in the pictures of all colors hide the waist. Its has a very awkward fit around the waist. Buy only if you plan to wear it with a belt like in the black picture. So sad!"
2.0,"The pattern on the fabric is pretty, that’s the best thing about it. It also had a nice length to wear with leggings where it can cover the front and the back nicely. However, the fabric feels like packing material that you would wrap glassware in. The quality of construction also seemed subpar. I suspect that these were made with the low quality fabric and mass-produced and or as practice for those who were making the same blouse in a better fabric of better quality. It also did not fit around the armpits And because the fabric is unforgiving it does not drape well it would not have worked out to try to wear it so I simply returned it after trying it on. It was disappointing because the pattern is very nice but unfortunately the shirt is unusable"
2.0,The bracelet is too small no where to indicate a larger size. Do not have info so I can return it. I just stuck with it
2.0,Item looks as expected but snags easily. I have lots of little strings coming out of it in the middle. But works well and like the design just wish it was more durable.
2.0,Not true to size and it also very thin that it see through.
2.0,Dislike sizing and material.
2.0,It is nothing like the picture. The color isn't even close and it doesn't fit like you think it would.
2.0,"I like it but it was way too big, wish it came in a xxs! My measurements are 32, 25, 36 and the size small was gigantic on me"
2.0,Material too slick. I miss the old leotards and the material they were made of.
2.0,I bought these to use outside under my covered patio. It only took a couple of weeks before one of the lens go a crack in it. They were not dropped so I am not sure what caused it to crack. The frame is not made very well either but the price ir right.
2.0,"The boots look good and were really comfortable.  There wasn't even a break-in period, adding to the comfort. After less than 3 months one of the boots ripped at the deal by the inside sole. Really disappointed to have gotten such a good deal, handsome boots and comfy fit, only to have to buy another pair elsewhere."
2.0,The lights on the shoe for the right foot did not work.
2.0,Acrylic tips are very poor quality and break very easy
2.0,I need three x .
2.0,Nice color but runs very small
2.0,"I normally wear a small but reading the reviews I decided to get a medium. It fit fine because I'm pretty busty so it was a little loose but still looked okay. It fit how a medium would. However, in the pic it doesn't look as long as it actually is. It is so long. I'm not that short(about 5'3"") so I wasn't expecting it to be this long."
2.0,Looks nothing like the picture. But still cute... Shipping takes a while.
2.0,Fits weirdly and just does not stay on.. not sure I would want it if it did though because it looks so awkward... very disappointing.
2.0,Half of them did not work. Like one in each pkg worked
2.0,"I guess this is called a nightgown for a reason! I was hoping it would be a cute dress like they show, but alas, it’s a giant, weirdly cut gown. The sides flare out and the fabric is thick and not drapey, and I look huge in it. You can see I ordered a large and I usually wear a large, and it is enormous. Not flattering at all. If I need to resort to mumu wearing, I guess I can wear this. But I’d find something else to buy. This isn’t cute.<br /><br />Positives, though: it’s softer than I thought, and the top half fits kind of true to size, and the blue color is really pretty!"
2.0,almost too tight to get through sleeve holes.
2.0,bothers my eyes if I wear too long
2.0,"this could be pretty but it just fits all wrong. tight on top big on bottom. of a size up it would not be flattering, need to have perfect figure and small up top for this., photo makes it look far better than reality"
2.0,the long post causes the earrings to snag on things and I developed piercing bump because of it. Only if the stone is bigger and if the stopper is larger would've solve the problem. Unfortunately these didn't work out
2.0,I liked it but the Diamond fell out of it the first day<br />:(
2.0,Too narrow.  I wear 10.5 and ordered size 11.  Still too narrow.  Gave to Goodwill
2.0,Way too short and too small
2.0,The threading is coming out something is wrong with the material cheap material.
2.0,Cheap material. You could see right through. The picture looks way better than the actual product.
2.0,Looks like a tunic rather than a shirt.
2.0,Love the glasses but they had a noticeable scratch on them
2.0,"You pay what you get for , cheap cheap cheap , the pocket fell off already !! Lol the material is very light almost like an under armor tshirt and the sizing is very small , incredibly small"
2.0,"I love the concept of this.  Cushion the ball of my feet in style is what I am looking for.  Sadly, tho, these are small...tight."
2.0,These came unstuck the second time I pulled my prescription glasses out of the glasses case.  I thought I'd try them because they were cheap but I wont buy again.
2.0,"very nice slippers, very good quality for the price. But i put only 2 stars because i had ordered a size 11 and i received a size 10 with a size 11 put over the embedded 10 on the bottom of the shoe. they do not fit my daughter. they are too tight. luckily i have a younger daughter that they fit."
2.0,Material is really bad and cheapy.
2.0,"Maybe I shouldve read the description, but I didnt know it was only one earring!! They are also incredibly uncomfortable and dont stay on straight."
2.0,Gave it to my daughter who didn’t get one day of wear before it broke.
2.0,"These slides are not as long, nor as wide.<br />I will give them a way."
2.0,"Really loved it at first, but it came apart rather quickly, Also, the strings on either end are too short to fit around your body and tie together. You will need an extra bit of line to get it to stay on you as desired."
2.0,Why is it so THICK?<br />Thought this would be thin material but it's so thick. I'll have to wear it during fall/autumn.
2.0,The whole left seam on the right side of the robe wasn’t even sewed. Very poor packaging like it had been returned and thrown in a plastic bag and wrapped with tape. I definitely WOULDN’T purchase again. I fixed it ( because I have a serger ) because they were Christmas presents for our Granddaughters
2.0,I searched for warm winter socks with grips. The only mark it hit was the grips. They are slightly tight at the ankle part and not very stretchy. The material feels cheap and they are NOT warm and thick.<br />I don’t Recommend
2.0,"Absolutely beautiful, fell so in love with it. Turned finger green though and had to take it off"
2.0,This bag is cute but smells HORRIBLE. I could never give this to my niece. It smells like dirty rotten clothes that have been buried in dirt. I planned to but a cute robe in it but I’m afraid the robe will stink too.
2.0,Lightweight and the colors are very drab.  I got what I paid for with this item.
2.0,So all the padding on the insole inside the shoe backfired it makes them super tight almost too small! 🤷🏻‍♀️Also the description states leather however it's man made material not leather! 👎🏽🐄 I recommend ordering a half size up and waiting for a low price because they're not worth it 😤
2.0,"These shoes feel like fake plastic toy shoes. They do look cute, but they weigh nothing."
2.0,"Really cute and pretty much true to size. My daughter has slender feet and the sandals are narrow so it works. Kinda smells like the Mini Melissa's. Our issue so far is that the top of the character's hair hits the top part of my daughter's foot when she walks so it was painful by the end of the day. I guess I could put a band-aid there but overall, it's a bad design."
2.0,"First, the style with the pockets, thank you. But, they aren’t the same fit as all the others without the pockets. I have multiple other pairs, these fit much tighter."
2.0,"I ordered it once and it was so pretty, but there was black paint all over the back of it. So I returned that one and the next one that came was a different red/wine color and it was huge!"
2.0,"The middle thong for the sandal is very hard and, for me at least, is uncomfortable and hurts to walk in."
2.0,soon as I opened the pack the links fell off...it's pretty but not a good quality
2.0,Cute...does not go all the way around my toe so it pinches under my toe. Doesnt look at dainty either. Still functional but for the price I was hoping for  something more comfortable that looks good.
2.0,Not water resistant or made of rip stop material.
2.0,"Product looks great, but the leather frays by the plastic window and the money clip is hard to get cash in and out of."
2.0,Cute but the bottom bead was glued on poorly and I lost it.
2.0,"the picture makes this look like it's high quality but it's really just a picture pasted on a pendent with a dome glued over it.  I would have made this myself had I know what it really was.  Glad it was so inexpensive, but still don't waste your money."
2.0,Could of been made of better material. Cheap and break easy.
2.0,"My first review was good but, since I have had this product my review had changed. Apparently the battery in the watch is close to dead. The time on the watch is right two times a day that is all. I am so unhappy with this I guess I should have just purchased another wal mart special for $10.00 again."
2.0,built for people with feet like skis
2.0,Nice but not a large as stated.
2.0,Material was weird
2.0,I was excited for this so I can make some gifts and so dissatisfied and disappointed. They just break easily
2.0,"The ratchet belt is a HUGE leap forward in comfort and ease of use.<br />Just slide the belt into the buckle and the ratchet will catch.  Just slide to tighten.  Lift the buckle latch to loosen.<br />No more adding holes to a belt or dealing with holes that dont match your measurement.<br />If youve read this far, do yourself a favor and get one of these.<br /><br />**Update** 5 months into ownership the belt portion snapped in half.  The ratchet system is awesome, but the materials that are used for the belt portion are of poor quality.  I am dropping the review from 5 to 2 stars.<br />Look around for one with a real leather belt."
2.0,Suit is fine -  crucial hat sized for a toddler.
2.0,"First of all, this is not an official Star Wars brand. It is a knock-off  no-brand item which I wish I would have noticed prior to purchase. Secondly, the BB-8 decal looks like it was silk screened on at the local beach boardwalk t-shirt shop. I would return it if it was Prime. I will give this to my kids to wear if they want it. My advice would be to only purchase Star Wars brand ties. They are excellent quality."
2.0,"Bought this for a catwoman costume. The ears are WAY too big and look  more like mouse ears. Also can't return this item, so I lost $35 which was a shame. Went straight into the garbage. Also the plastic was stinky."
2.0,Adhesive that keeps sections separate started coming up after the first weeks. Cards would become stuck.
2.0,"I bought this dress for a wedding Im in. This dress is really cute, but it is cheaply made, which I expected for the price. I will return it because the zipper kept sticking (even when I wasnt in it). The zipper is a nightmare."
2.0,Took us several orders to get some that worked.  Had to pay return shipping for a product that dids not work right out of the box.  Would not recommend this.
2.0,"I loved everything about this top with one exception...after about an hour wear, the zipper would not stay up and then it split apart from the bottom and didn't leave much to the imagination. It took myself and 2 other people to get the zipper undone so the top could be removed."
2.0,"These fit way too tight after 5 minutes of wearing them around the house my daughter had terrible marks on her feet, she crawled for a few minutes on the floor and the fabric started ripping so I didn’t even bother returning them<br />Not worth the money in my opinion<br />Much better options out there<br />I dont Recommend this product at all"
2.0,got this flowers did not stay to be seen- bottom part of necklace fell off
2.0,2 stars because one of the clamps is not holding and the adjustment keeps getting loose. Other than that shirt stay in
2.0,"The purse fell apart, I threw it away after one month."
2.0,"Wrinkles easy, too thin but has a generous fit and looks good"
2.0,Clasp is difficult to do on your own.  Poor color match to the pink gold active 2 watch.
2.0,"UPDATE: 6 days later the gold came off. I think the actual lenses are way too big, and ugly. I got some to zero compliments on this purchase. would not buy it again.<br /><br />wearing these now. glasses are free from scratches. legs have a metallic gold finish  the only thing I'm not happy about is that the frame is pretty too thick. overall I'm very pleased with my purchase  I would recommend this if you are a rapper or just want to have bling for readers. I would rate this 4.5 stars out 5!!!-"
2.0,Really see through and much too small ): I even sized up
2.0,Way too small.  I even check the chart but was deceeved.  Probably my fault
2.0,Not really what I expected.  Need to lose a little weight to wear these comfortably.
2.0,Was represented as silver and blue and is gold
2.0,"I will say that these earrings are very pretty.<br /><br />What I don't like is that they claim to be hypoallergenic, but they're not. Despite having the 925 marking they are actually just plated brass. My ears started itching within seconds of putting these on."
2.0,"I loved them when i got them. However, the seams ripped easily and when you are standing in the right light they are 100% see threw."
2.0,I don't know what happened to the quality but these already have holes around the back pocket VERY DISAPPOINTED !
2.0,One pair of the shorts the right leg is not hemmed. I bought 9 pairs of these shorts only one was defective.
2.0,"This jacket looks really nice in the picture and it's pretty much the same in person. My problem the fabric,  it's really thin. The collar couldn't keep its shape because if how thin and flimsy the fabric is. I like jackets that hold their structure and don't loom cheap. I've order Allegra before and had great luck so I believe in the brand, but this is really thin lace so I'll have to return it."
2.0,One of the short handles broke off.
2.0,"i mean the design is wrong, side boob is to be expected so if you arent ok with that then dont purchase. but otherwise, its not entirely disappointing"
2.0,It was much larger than I expected and it doesn't look as nice as the picture.
2.0,El vestido me quedo pequeño  y lo tu ve que regresar y no me gusto quw desia que era gratis para regresar lo y pague $4.75<br />No se porque  ups me cobro para  la estiqueta
2.0,I don't like it. The jumper looks nothing like the photo. The color and material is MUCH darker. It reminds me of some 1960s jumper Pam Grier would have worn in Foxy Brown. Nothing tribal about this thing. It's loud and tacky looking. Save your money.
2.0,This shirt is NOT a tunic. Barely fits lower than waist. I was willing to to live with that so I took the tags off and washed it. I hung it to dry and then noticed an ink spot on the lower back. Needless to say I won't be ordering from this company again.
2.0,"Very cute top, with sweet ruffle details and neck tie, but too sheer."
2.0,"The “wrap” of the dress is very shallow. So as you walk forward at a normal pace, it flys open for a full frontal. In the image, it shows it opening to about the knee. In actually, it open at mid thigh and flys open higher in movement. It’s unwearable without bike shorts or a mini skirt underneath."
2.0,Fit fine just looked different on<br />I would recommend looking at reviews pics before buying.
2.0,"One size fits all only because it has Dolman sleeves.  The Dolman sleeves fit like regular sleeves on a larger woman but I can at least get my arms into it unlike other Asian made cover ups.  Will not close over a chest larger than 40&#34;.  As you might expect it is not Chiffon made from cotton or silk, it is from rayon/polyester and very thin and less drapey than other chiffons.  Serged along the outer seams it will not do for much other than the pool.  If you don't mind cheap looking and not really covering up it will be fine for you.  I am keeping it only because it is cool-ish and comfortable in the summer heat."
2.0,Not as cute as the picture. The actual ball has a noticeable seam in it where it was glued.
2.0,They were alitte bit..could of ordered a size smaller...it's the waist that did fit well...different jeans don't always fit the size they say..
2.0,I would have given more stars if the product was as pictured. The lenses are not the nice dark blue i was expecting. I would return them but i don't want to be charged $6.00 for it. I would not have bought these had i known the lenses were going to be black. I won't be buying anything else from this seller.
2.0,It is looks cheap
2.0,A boxy fitting shirt with kind of rough fabric. Doesn’t look that great compared to most other graphic Tees.
2.0,"These are pretty but don't stay in my baby's hair-she has typical fine baby hair. Barrettes are so slippery, I can't imagine they would stay put in other hair types either."
2.0,Cute enough for the price. Unfortunately I paid for rose gold but got sterling silver. Waited 2 weeks and 2 days to get the wrong item. Not a happy camper.
2.0,"Cheap magnifiers. Not good for your eyes. Worse than $1 store. Pretty colors though, and cute cases. Caused immediate eye strain."
2.0,Wasn't the right size for it to be a 2x it fit like a middle so wasn't happy at all
2.0,These did not fit as shown. They were not tapered at all. The crotch was at mid thigh. I had to alter them to get the right fit.
2.0,NOT ELEGANT OR STUNNING - VERY SMALL - SOMETHING A CHILD WOULD WEAR
2.0,"They were not the size I expected.  I had purchased Wigwam socks before, XL, and they were much larger.  I returned the ""UNISEX"" X60 socks and ordered directly from Wigwam.  The ""direct from Wigwam socks"" were what I wanted.  They were men's not unisex.  I ordered men's from you.  Also, one bag was torn open and the socks were stuffed in loose.  No other issues"
2.0,Way too big and the colors were not bright
2.0,"The price was reasonable, but I only got about a month of use from the band before it broke.  Because the &#34;clip&#34; that locks the band to the Charge 2 is held in place by plastic, this is the weak link.  I was taking the Fitbit off, and a small piece of plastic shot out and the band fell off. The seller was very responsive to my issue and sent a replacement which has held up better so far."
2.0,I know this item is low cost so is it not going to be the most awesome item compared to more expensive things...but the clasp does not keep the item on at all. The one little locking wing just flops around....is doesn't even lock in place before you put the two side locks on...and now the 2nd little locking wing doesn't want to secure it. It is basically unwearable.
2.0,Big enough for an XL but find that upper arms and back are pretty tight for this size.
2.0,"The material is soft & the colors are true; however, it's boxy, in cut, & the fabric pills almost immediately. Additionally, it was slightly soiled around the collar upon receipt. Returned!"
2.0,"I love free people brand. However, the top part of the dress looks odd on me. Possibly because I have large breasts? It does lay right.<br /><br />Other than that it is a beautiful material, soft, and fits as expected."
2.0,Material and fabrication seemed OK but mask was to small to properly and functionally fit a mans' face.  Refund was handled promptly but application of a restocking charge was inappropriate in view of the fact that the product did not fit properly.
2.0,"The band was beautiful. However after just a few times of taking the watch on and off the clasps lost the tightness needed to stay closed so it started to fall off repeatedly. After wearing consistently the metal bar that attaches the band to the magnetic clasp that attaches directly to the watch bent, so it is no longer usable."
2.0,"I wanted to like this garment but the fabric feels &quot;foamy&quot;, and the fit was too short, and didn't look at all like the model.  Not to mention, the return process was painful and expensive."
2.0,"The string that connects the bracelet is not good, it undid itself in a week."
2.0,I was so excited to find a pair of pants that are actually long but the size was way to small and I had to return them.
2.0,This shirt was sized for a toddler
2.0,It ripped after using it for few hours:(...
2.0,"The fit was as expected. I’m 5’8, 128 lbs. Small fit well!<br />However, the exterior fabric was as if it was Velcro. I tried these on with jeans, casual pants and even leather joggers. They all stuck to these leggings like Velcro. Even baggy leather joggers!<br />Sure, They make your clothes fit better; But there’s no disguising you’re wearing an under garment. Your clothes will stick to these in an awkward way...<br />That’s not the look I’m going for 🙃"
2.0,"This semi-fancy sleeveless shirt is not fit to the size indicated. If you are bottom heavy, you may want to get a size or two bigger, but then you might be floating on to in this shirt. The price is lower than normal, which may seem like a good deal but the overall fit has much to be desired.<br /><br />Katiebabs"
2.0,"Didn't ft/wasn't adjustable with my watch because the inside strap is too short.  The leather feels like plastic and looks like it.  In addition, I was frustrated by the restocking fee I had to pay to return the strap when it didn't first with my watch.<br /><br />Overall, it just looks and feels cheap."
2.0,Not very good quality material.  Neck hole large and Disney figures are felt like material.
2.0,"Think I was sent the wrong color maybe??It just doesn’t look dark green to me. More blue, but not dark blue like the actually ‘dark blue’ shown either. I’ll probably return it anyway because the buckle is plastic and feels pretty flimsy. The band itself fits nicely tho."
2.0,"I saw a top similar on Free People. Hunted and found this, I thought it would be perfect so in a haste, I ordered white and black. I was so bummed :( I ordered a L, I'm 36C and it pulled across, making it unflattering. Then I saw the collar...a very obvious seam line goes across the neckline. For me, this ruined the entire look of the top and made it not Free People dupe worthy. Not only was it too small, but I just couldn't with the obvious seam line. If it flowed like other mesh/lace tops I've found on Amazon, that'd be a different story. Unfortunately, have to return."
2.0,"I bought this knowing I'd be walking around in the woods for my wedding photos, my feet still sunk and then the plastic heel protectors would slide off and get stuck in the mud so my heels still ended up getting dirty. Idea seemed great but it's really not worth it."
2.0,Not 100% cotton. I would say rayon poly blend of some sort. Fit was small! I’m a medium and I ordered a medium. I can barely get the material to overlap at the top. To get the look in the pic I should have ordered xl. It will be a cute swimsuit bottom coverup. Not the skirt I was hoping.
2.0,"Revised...<br />I had to revise my original review and reduce to 2 stars.  These so called boxer briefs should be re-classified as butter shorts. A 1/3 of my butt checks are hanging out the bottom.  Yes I got the right size ( 180 with 33"" waist) If I lecture my daughter for wearing clothes with her butt checks playing peek-a-boo, then I would have to lecture myself.  Everything else about these are great. Nice fit in the waist band, Material is very comfortable. I just can not get past the extreme short length. Almost feel like I'm up next to pole dance on stage.  Wish I could return them. Win some loose some.<br />Just received these and they seem to be of good quality.  The material is nice and comfortable. The only thing is the length of the legs is very short. More to the brief side than boxer.  The picture on the package even shows the legs to be a bit more defined.  Will just have to try them out and see how it goes. If you are expecting a boxer style, you  will probably be disappointed."
2.0,This shirt fits too tightly so need to order up a size
2.0,I sent it back - very odd fit in my opinion...
2.0,It broke very easily after a few days
2.0,"It looks great before you buy it.  But the sizing is way off.  I knew that I needed to buy one a few sizes bigger based on the reviews, and I did, but was still snug.  The front panel is extremely sheer and you can see through it.  The reason I get a suit that is not a bikini is because I don't like to show my stomach, which this suit does."
2.0,This dress is cute but is way too small. My right boob was also falling out the top.
2.0,"I chose this rating for a few reasons.<br />1) I had a psychic friend of mine check this out and let me know what he felt from it (Along with a few other pieces that I recently purchased to tell if any of them were &#34;working&#34;) He didn't have a good response to it at all and I basically deemed this as bunk.<br /><br />I had my psychic friend look at 3 things; a palm stone of selenite, a Scalar, negative ion charged necklace, and this orgone necklace. Of the two necklaces he was able to clearly tell me the attributes of the Scalar necklace in great detail without prior knowledge of what it was. It was also able to read the energy signature of the selenite, which was expected. But this orgone pendant, he received little to nothing on this item. Almost completely dismissing it.<br /><br />2) The price of the item does not fit how cheaply it is made. It is supposed to have some form of metallic forms involved in it, but there is no trace of any magnetism when placed near a very powerful magnet. The only part that has any metallic luster is the hook in the back of the necklace that is used to clip it together. The product comes off as being utterly bunk, cheap, children's-play-toy plastic.<br /><br />Personally I don't like the product at all. The price is too high for the product that you receive and I would recommend sticking to crystals if doing any psychic/metaphysical work. A great substitute for things with &#34;energy&#34; is the Japanese Scalar Necklace Pendant found on this site (if one is searching for functional, yet subtle and stylish EMF protection). I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
2.0,"Battery was dead and the hands that point at the time falls to the bottom because they are loose, so you have to constantly reset the time."
2.0,"I didn’t really like this dress. It was more suitable as a night gown. The positioning of the pockets did not flatter my figure at all. The color was nice, a soft mint color."
2.0,"Although my child was really excited to have this costume for Halloween because he's obsessed with Sonic, I don't recommend unless you have no other choice like we did. It didn't fit my short and stubby 6-year-old in the fabric was incredibly uncomfortable for him. I think it was made out of microfiber which is the worst! However, it did its job... Definitely wouldn't recommend if you're looking for something of higher quality!"
2.0,"Tldr; Comes very small! Arms are very tight!<br />The shirt is defined for someone with no curves.<br /><br />I have a sweatshirt style top made out of this material, so I thought I knew what I was getting into, but this is cut poorly. I can't even raise my arms above chest height without the sleeve seams digging in and feeling like I will ""Hulk out"" of it.<br /><br />As someone with a protruding chest, and wide hips, the shirt had NO give.<br /> There were no darts to allow for different sized chests. There was no stretch for bending at the hips; I thought I was going to pop every button."
2.0,I prefer more of a stretchier type material in a t-shirt like most that are made today. I found this shirt to be uncomfortable and it didn’t fit me like most shirts do.
2.0,"The clip was light and would have covered both lenses only if the central part wasn't defective. One side was covering the lens and other side was floating in the air. Therefore, at least 1/3 of right lens wasn't covered. It could be a defective product. Overall, if you put the clip over the glasses, then it would feel as if you were wearing the real sunglasses."
2.0,The chain links kept pinching my skin and it broke already. It’s hasn’t been a week of having it.
2.0,They're really cute but they rip so easily<br />The moment I tried one on it ripped
2.0,"The material is thin and ill fitting. If you have any extra anything this shirt will accentuate it (not in a good way).<br />I expected more of a knit type fabric but this is a polyester thing, slick kind of fabric.<br />The neckline is not a scoop but, rather, a boat neck so expect your bra straps to show. Overall, very disappointed."
2.0,Completely off in sizing! I_was_swimming_in_it! :(
2.0,Working in the snow hands felt cold very quickly
2.0,broke after 1 day.
2.0,These look alright and the quality is okay too but the size is way off.  I wear a 5.5 or 6 and ordered a 5.5.  They are AT LEAST a full size too big and they are wide in the arch area.  When I pulled them out of the box I thought it was a joke and kept looking at the size label. Going back right now.
2.0,"This shirt runs very small. It is also a little short throughout the torso. I’m small 5’, 103 lbs and it’s snug on me. The material isn’t comfortable and made me feel slightly itchy. I’m not sure why that is. I’m keeping it because it’s not worth returning it, but I’m a tad disappointed because it is a really cute top."
2.0,"They slip down all the time, everytime I move. They are comfortable but annoying."
2.0,My 11 month old is in the 97th percentile for height. His feet are in shoe size 6 & these 12-24 month socks are enormous.  They go up to his knees and the heel is above his ankle. We are using them with sock holders or he'd walk right out of them.
2.0,I don’t like that you have to twist it to make it small enough for a bracelet. It gets tangled easily.
2.0,The material is nice: it's a really warm hat. But the elastic is just too tight and gave me a headache after wearing it for five minutes. And I have a small head.
2.0,it looks very cheap compared to other purse I got on here! very disappointed but keeping it until I get another!
2.0,"I loved this dress, super cute, flattering, but the first day I wore it the seams on both side fell apart. They completely unraveled. I was at work when it happened too so I quickly safety pinned what I could and I had to duck out of work and run to the near by target to get a new dress to finish the work day!! So embarrassing."
2.0,"After wearing this cap, I need to add that the buttons on it are worthless. I can't imagine any mask staying on the buttons where they are located. I really wanted to love these. They are large and puffy so if you have thick hair they'd be great.  It protects my hair when I put on a face shield without pulling my hair. The elastic around the back  is adjustable.  These are well made, and are washable. The material does not get hot to wear."
2.0,To small seam like petite or child not women sizes need to return :(
2.0,Was not the dark color or texture I expected.
2.0,"Looked really small but it fit, cute though."
2.0,"Good quiality, just like the picture, buy an M but it is a lot bigger"
2.0,"I wanted to love this once I had it on. It looked great on my body except it gave me an awful camel toe!! Everything fit except the length. Too short in the body yet still really long in the legs. Proportions were way off. Fabric was really stretchy and kind of shiny like Halloween costumes. Despite the fabric, I could have totally classed this up for a wedding I'm going to, but I can't do anything about the bad fit in the crotch. I'm 5'2, 110 lbs and got the small."
2.0,It says for big kids. They are smaller than the children's mask I ordered from a different company.
2.0,"If I could fit correctly into this shaper I bet I would love it.  I went by the size chart and it seriously hurt to get it over my hips and it took me a good 15 minutes to get it on.  I mean shapers should be snug but this was a bit much.  So if you are  considering buying size up.  The fabric was nice, the straps once on held the top portion of the shaper in place very well and it felt comfortable once I was able to put it on.  It flattened out my tummy and sides well and gave the butty a nice lift.  Unfortunately, the hassle and pain to put it on will make me return it. I will consider ordering a bigger size and see if that goes better for me."
2.0,My husband got me these for Christmas and although they are cute they are to big to fit even on the last notch and just slouch on my neck. I was so disappointed.
2.0,"Thickness of the chain was great, Color of chain does not match the diamond pendant the chain was bought for,"
2.0,The dress was too tight and it was going to be used for my Sister's wedding. I wish that you all sold this in xxxlg or 20 X in women size and It would have worked. Can you make this happen for me because I really love this dress.
2.0,to be honest it didn’t last more a month
2.0,The photo gives this dress much more credit than it really is. The dress is just straight with no form. Material is not of quality either.
2.0,"I got a size XXL, but there is no way I would even try to get them over my butt. I gave them to my 9 year old cousin, they fit her perfectly."
2.0,"It hung forward too much, and I didn't like the way it stuck out. It was too big in general I think"
2.0,Sent them back. Smaller than expected and very little stretch to them.
2.0,"the gloves are as described, just hate being price gouged. these gloves would never sell for more than $5.00 pack pre corona. I will find somewhere else next time, hate being ripped off"
2.0,Cute but several cup holders will not hold air
2.0,"When they came in the mail, I was pleased with their appearance. They look exactly like the pics and are very beautiful, however, when I went to put them in, the part that goes through my ear was too large to fit my piercing. All of my pearcings are fully healed and I tried the earrings on all piercing locations and they didn’t fit any of them, so I am returning the product."
2.0,Skirt was cut odd- fabric was 'as expected' but the cut was off- had to return-disappointed
2.0,"Don't know if it's my pair that is defected, but frame is crooked.. can't fix it 👎"
2.0,Looked almost like the pic but something was a little off about the dress. It did not flow like the pic showed.  Will be returning
2.0,Not sure how I feel about these socks yet!  Wore one pair yesterday and my toe popped  through. Had another pair on today and all is good so far😣
2.0,Really cute dresses but doesn’t fit to size at all.
2.0,Cheesy. Poor quality even though on sale.
2.0,"Too heavy for summer pj,s"
2.0,Cheaply constructed does not look like picture in person.
2.0,Did not expect a dress after even paying 15 to ship fast.
2.0,Material was shiny polyester not cotton. Cut is very straight and neckline too high.
2.0,Breaks easily had purchased both and they both broke
2.0,too small for size
2.0,"Really rough material - not comfortable even for a brief try-on. Also, beware of return fees. When did that become a thing? I had to pay for the label and box myself instead of the usual Amazon process. Not happy about that especially because the quality of the product was so poor."
2.0,These are TINY!! Only two of them even fit on my wife's smallest toes. The others just hang out in the jewelry box. The only reason that this is two stars instead of one is that she likes the two that she can fit on her toes.
2.0,"I purchased in three colors. Way too small and I usually wear a small. Fabric is very thin. Buttons are those snap kind, and tore the fabric. Also the buttons are not actually buttons, but some cheap looking plastic crystals. So I Can't even sew on real buttons. In all honesty, I feel this shirt is over priced."
2.0,Was nice at first.  Comfortable and light.  Was my favorite band for my watch until it broke...<br />Only had it for about 2 weeks before it broke.<br />Wish it was better secured then it would be 5 stars but 2 stars because it was not durable at all.  Broke off my wrist while out shopping.  Could fix it with glue though... I suppose
2.0,"I have very few good things to say about this hat! First off, it arrived in a plastic bag, all smashed and flattened. When I took it out of the clear light plastic bag I also discovered the brim was bent and misshapen. Because the hat was folded in two, the top of it now sticks up, and will not level out or become flat as advertised. I can positively state the hat was pretty WHITE as promised and the black band was securely attached."
2.0,no way any part is sterling so false advertising to state it..i have the acid to test it...should of stated &#34;sterling look&#34; even so..not a sterling look
2.0,One foot longer than the other for both pairs. Huge disappointment.
2.0,This is more like cheap costume jewelry than actual jewelry. It’s very bulky and heavy and looks like the paint would chip off pretty quickly. I returned it as soon as I opened it.
2.0,"This purse was lovely and seemed well-made. But, the banana-yellow of the zipper did not match the mustard yellow of the purse. I liked it enough that had I been able to order another one with the same color zipper, I would have done so. The seller was nice and polite, and I received a full refund without any trouble. Maybe another color would be a better choice."
2.0,"It is so cheaply made, that the shoulder strap came off immediately. Ikept only because I was leaving the next day and wanted that color."
2.0,Wish I had better things to say. Got smelly real quick. I cleaned it every day but this fabric just really liked to hold the smell. I would have rose gold left on my arm sometimes because it gets hot where I live y’all & that’s on science.
2.0,"The pajamas fit perfectly until I washed and dried them. They shrunk so much I discarded them. So, nice pajamas if you hang dry only."
2.0,Looks much higher quality in the pics than it actually is.  The seams are wavy and thick and don't lay right when I'm wearing it.  It's my lounge around the house sweater now.
2.0,I rarely write negative reviews but I regret this purchase. The fit is nice but the material is cheap. It takes two ironings to remove the wrinkles and they return within an hour of use. The overpricing made the poor quality that much more upsetting.
2.0,"This may fit a 44” bust, but it doesn’t fit the shoulders of the person with the 44” bust. It’s also quite short — and I’m short-waisted.<br /><br />Obviously was designed based on Asian sizes. Sigh. Back it goes."
2.0,Very small and difficult to use.
2.0,I think the title pretty much sum it all up :(
2.0,"Very Small!  Loved it think it's super cute!! I'm pretty fit 5'8&#34; 152 ibs, and it was way way to small. If you have anything larger than a b sized chest it'll be WAY to small. I am a larger sided D. I have a squat booty too and it was way to small felt almost like a thong it was so small. Seems pretty good quality though. Not bad for the price. Sad to see it not fit. Loved it in the photos. Returning."
2.0,"Very pretty, but much, much smaller than I thought it would be.  I am not a large woman, but it was too small for any of my toes or pinky fingers.  I will give it to a young niece."
2.0,Not exactly what I expected. I was thinking all beads and bling. The colors are beautiful...
2.0,"These were so cute, and I couldn't wait to wear them. They won't fit. They're too small. Bummer."
2.0,Very comfortable and stays on but shortly after the bright blue color I ordered turned black and I am unable to get it clean
2.0,I returned this product because the stitching on the sleeves did not match the sweater.
2.0,"I find that I should not have ordered 'King size', as length was much too long, and had to be shortened quite a bit.  Husband not happy with material, but does wear them around the house.  Lesson learned."
2.0,I am a medium and the top doesn't close.  I am 5'4 and it is shorter than I hope.  Won't wear as a bathing suit cover since it is to small to cover my front at all
2.0,"As a medium these pants fit like a small, possibly even an extra small. It was actually very disappointing I was looking forward to adding them to my closet."
2.0,"I ordered American size Large and got a shirt that at best is American small. It shrink further after the wash in soft soap and cold water gentle cycle!<br />Very poor material, badly stitched and there are only six buttons in the front, leaving six inches to the first button after the one on the neck Do not recommend buying this at any price, cheap or even for free!"
2.0,good but very cheap. Ha it less then a week when it started to peel.
2.0,Not stretchy or shaped as pictured. Kind of sac-like.
2.0,Not a great quality product. The leather is not real and the band is very stiff.
2.0,Mother could not wear them because she was allergic to the material.
2.0,Logo pealing off within 3 months after purchase
2.0,Not worth the money. Hard to walk in and the elastic to connect the back of sandals are useless. Save your money - better off buying plastic sandals for your costume
2.0,This robe is for petite skinny slim thick women Do not buy if you have a belly ended up gifting mine to my sister
2.0,"It's a bit to thick, which makes it a little warm/ hot at times.<br />The good thing is it blocks out any light & allows your eyes to blink and move.<br />Katrina"
2.0,"This keychain was very cute and the actual shark part seemed sturdy. However, after less than a week, the shark detached from the ring and was lost. I think the chain could be made of stronger material, so it wouldn’t break."
2.0,The girls shirt was too small and they were so thin that I could see right through them...
2.0,"They do run a little on the short side.  My husband works outside all winter, and he wore his new Christmas long johns for the first time yesterday.  It was only in the 20's, (gets a lot colder here sometimes) and he was not warm enough.  He said they would be ok for spring wear maybe.  Also, for those of you who do not shave your legs, the hair gets caught in the fiber, and causes the legs to itch and be irritated."
2.0,First medium wind the pole bent
2.0,"Admittedly, there two things these bras have going for them: the clasp for adjustable band sizing and the mesh on the front and back. But other than that, they run small and are certainly NOT &#34;high impact&#34;. High impact for walking, maybe? But a run would have the girls bouncing all over the place. As for fit, I wear a 36 DD/DDD and according to all the other posts here decided to order the XL. I was falling out the side. This bra was a major disappointment and I am sending them back a.s.a.p."
2.0,"I was looking for something that was suitable to wear around my grandchildren.  The top appeared to me as being a little more modest covering the chest.  I'm not sure if it was that the top was too large, but it definitely hang low showing plenty of cleavage.  The return process was easy."
2.0,Poor Quality Broken in one day
2.0,Was excited for this dress was cheap feeling and didn’t fit right.  Had it send back
2.0,"I purchased these glasses to go with my husband's Santa suit and they are way too small...they don't even come close to fitting behind his ears. These should be advertised as childrens' glasses! My husband is, by no means, a big guy either. Very disappointed, but I need them for pictures this weekend, so we will have to try to make them work."
2.0,Sleeves to long and blouse too short
2.0,"Fits as measured but fabric has shine to it since it’s actually not cotton as claimed (inside tag says 85% polyester, remaining is spandex)."
2.0,"Potato sack.  Gonna change the neck line, add something and wear it at home."
2.0,Good fabric But the pants are really short! About an 2-3 inches above the ankle. $60 house pants smh.
2.0,Fit was great but shirt pilled after only a couple of washes
2.0,"I, too, purchased these after searching for Limited exact stretch pants. After washing them the first time, I can see a lot of puckering in the fabric, especially above the pockets where the fabric attaches to the waist piece - the kind you see when the spandex in a pair of cotton pants gets dodgy. Very weird. The pants fit ok but the waist is slightly too large on me which is also weird because I always seem to have the opposite problem in other pants. I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,"too small, also the wasteband is practically rigid, super uncomfortable."
2.0,Real big.
2.0,"I wanted to love this bra but the material felt cheap, it was uncomfortable and way too small."
2.0,"Beautiful bracelet - the Amethysts are well matched and good color.  It got here quickly but the chain broke the day before its “allowed” to be returned, so it looks like I’m stuck now having to fork over money to a jeweler for repairs.  Not real happy"
2.0,I should have ordered an XL but there wasn’t an option. The 1x is big enough to layer under. The unfortunate product issue I have is the lining is so delicate it tore instantly when I tried it on. Returning it.
2.0,Love the color but they feel kinda flimsy
2.0,My 11yr old son is a 6.5. And unless I read the size chart wrong…they could fit my 3 year old.
2.0,I had high hopes for this band.  I have a small wrist and needed to remove more than four links.  The first four came out fine and the tool that comes with the band is simple to use.  The problem was the rest of the pins were plated over with the chrome and could not be removed with the tool.  This one goes back.
2.0,Ok  but half of the contents are debris or sand with broken points
2.0,Cute  but very cheap cotton almost transparent. I will not purchase again.
2.0,"It's cute, but it arrived with a pretty big hole in it. Unfortunately, it's not worth paying for the shipping to return it (an obvious downside of ordering from Amazon)."
2.0,"Cheapest ""compression"" shorts ever."
2.0,I wasn't inmpressed with the claims that were made compared to the actual fit.
2.0,Pretty color and lace material but it runs really small
2.0,"I loved this purse when I got it in, fun color, great size, was a last minute need before trip to Europe for 10 days... but it only lasted 7!!!!  There were some minor frays, on edges upon arrival, and buttons sometimes clicked into place, and it felt nice, but after a few days of constant use but abuse, the seems started unraveling near top, to where my phone was about to fall out on day 7!!  It would not have lasted the entire 10 day trip, so I’m giving 2 stars, because it is an ok price, and fun crossbody purse that’s a great medium/large size, but it’s not made to last!  This will be great for occasional use!  I hope they do return it 😅"
2.0,One of the claps broke the second time I wore it. I am prior military so I know how to wear them. It was either poorly made or cheaply made.
2.0,The idea is good but the silicone is too flimsy and folds over on itself.
2.0,"I liked this a lot, but it was basically a one time wear dress. Very thin lace, and the side zipper got caught on my sleeve lace every time i put my arms down."
2.0,"You get what you pay for. I cleaned the rings/studs/balls with rubbing alcohol and a lot of the plastic spikes and balls just disintegrated. But for the price it's good, I would just recommend only using in healed piercings."
2.0,The ballerinas are cute. That's all.  It's made of hard plastic which makes them very slippery.  My daughter (3 yo) used them the first day and I was waiting for an accident to happen.  She has never used them again because are not comfortable and are really slippery.
2.0,My daughter wasn’t sure these were authentic Stance socks when I gave them to her. They were thin and did look different then her other stance socks. Now after a month and a half they have a hole in them at the toe. Very disappointed. That has never happened with any of her other stance socks purchased directly from Stance.
2.0,"The chain itself looks nice, very bright sterling silver. The clasp however is too small and very cheaply made causing trouble putting the chain on and not closing properly."
2.0,Described as women's socks. I'm 5'2&#34; and about 110lbs and these are too small. I could barely get them over my knee and they were extremely tight and uncomfortable. Seem to be made for kids/pre-teens. Will be returning
2.0,Very pretty but unfortunately one of the dangling beads fell off.
2.0,"The sizing chart is WAY off. I normally wear a 14-16 and ordered the XL. I could barely get it on. The sleeves were way too tight and the fabric doesn't have much stretch so I couldn't get my arms all the way in. It's short - I'm 5'6 and it barely covered my butt - I'd call this a tunic. If you are short, thin person (petite), it would probably work as a dress with leggings. If you are more athletic or rounder build, this isn't for you. I'm hoping this XL will fit my daughter who wears size 4-6 as a tunic."
2.0,"This belt arrived packaged well with its own drawstring storage bag. The description states it is leather. I was suspicious because of the price point. Sure enough this is reconstituted leather. This fact should be disclosed. It’s not stated in the description or title.<br /><br />If you’re looking for a wearable product, this will do in a pinch but it doesn’t hold up long with daily use. I wouldn’t repurchase. Save your money and get a real leather belt."
2.0,"These aren't performance underwear like I expected. I found they did not hold their form and lacked a bit of compression, so they provided insufficient support. Donated them so hopefully they are what someone else's prefers."
2.0,"It's a pretty necklace, but the heart rhythm on it is malignant. That is the heart beat of someone who is probably going to die soon. It's a nice piece for someone who doesn't mind wearing some poor sod's death rattle around their neck."
2.0,These sandals are very hard under your feet… not enough cushion and the straps are very thin and feel like they may dig in to the skin if worn for any length of time…or come apart.
2.0,"Well I thought these earrings were gold plated but there not and they make my ears itchy, I’m disappointed on my purchase going to warn my buddies not to buy these"
2.0,This should be sold separately. I love this swim suit but in order for the bottoms to fit the top is too large. I'm 5'3 and weigh 125lb. I wear a 34 D I ordered a large the top was way too big but the bottoms fit perfect.
2.0,"I bought these for a silicone doll. They are not the quality I buy for my dolls. The edge of the sleeves were unraveling when I opened them. They would never hold up for a real newborn. I will just repair what is needed and keep them. If you want quality, these are not."
2.0,"Love the ring, very pretty but the after about 15 days of wearing it the ends of some of the wires came apart from the rest of the ring.  The ends kept snagging my clothes etc.  I am sad to have to return it but LOVE the look."
2.0,Beautiful top! But the the size fit way to big! I did order another in a different color and it fit perfect!
2.0,I purchased a shirt from this particular brand and LOVED it so that’s why I came back to order more however this shirt and the third one I ordered is not the same material as described and not as good in quality. Not sure I’ll keep it because it’s just not up to the quality of the first order. As far as the colors and pattern I really like again it’s just the quality and the material is just not the quality as the first shirt I ordered from them.
2.0,"Plese I need some help.<br /><br />The clock didn't work, just few time of use and stop.<br /><br />Thanks"
2.0,These are cute but weigh a lot and too much for my daughter's head and hair.
2.0,"I’m all for trying to find a deal, but these sunglasses are — unwearable — as far as I’m concerned.  It’s not like an earpiece is bent (one was, btw, I just bent it back the correct way), the problems are with the bridge and lenses.  Problems that are on Main Street for all to see.  It took a good bit to get a picture that wasn’t full of glare, but if you can’t tell, the lens on the right is not installed correctly and the smaller piece of the bridge is lopsided.  If you have the nerve to call something “Tony Stark” and “Iron Man” sunglasses, you better bring your A-game.  These do not."
2.0,That you couldn’t tell the charm was ballet shoes!
2.0,"This was oversized, but the fabric was thin and see through, and just didn't look very much like the photo. I got it in XL and I am 5'8'' and 17lbs. In tops like this usually the larger I go the bigger I  look, and that was the case here. I also just wasn't crazy about the quality or the style of it, and the sleeves were kind of odd in person. I returned."
2.0,It ran too small the stitching between the arms was so tight I couldn’t move my arms up. I had to order a size that is so much bigger than mine just to hope it will fit well.
2.0,Kinda cheap looking.....
2.0,I bought this bag 2 months ago. I’ve only carried it about 4 weeks of that time and already the lining is completely ripped and one of the zippers is broken. I may have just gotten a lemon but now my return window is closed and I’m stuck with a pile of fake leather.
2.0,This pajama set is cute enough but the fabric is not a cool fabric. It is NOT a nice cotton knit. It’s the typical polyester swimsuit type fabric that is like most clothing that comes from China. These are going back.
2.0,This is way too fancy and  bulky.  A double layer of very THICK & stiff ornate white lace.  Looks ridiculous.  Plus it runs big.  Need one of these potentially useful garments made with chiffon.  Forget the lace!
2.0,The sleeves are about 6 inches too long and about 6&#34; too wide. I can fit a whole other arm up in the sleeve and still have room. It's very odd. The rest fit nice and would be very comfortable if not for the weird sleeves.
2.0,"The purse itself is great, love the room and different compartments. The only color I would buy is black though. The rest of the colors look cheap. I bought a bunch of these in different colors for my kids teachers for Christmas. They didn't come on time and only the black ones were something I would use. So I use the black one I bought and I love it."
2.0,This dress was not what I expected. The material was thin and cheap cotton. Wasn’t cute on me it looked like an old lady dress.
2.0,"Nothing like picture shows, not very supportive other than top waist band. Does nothing for butt lift at all."
2.0,"I didn't realize that these socks actually have plastic strips on the inside of the sock touching the back of the heel, which I don't care for. They're fairly thin and small, but they do stretch when I put them on. The pack contains eight pairs in four different colors: white, grayish white, beige and black. The grayish white is my least favorite color, it has kind of a dirty look to it. I don't think I'll be wearing these socks."
2.0,"Meh don’t love them, wish I could return but I took the tags off. They run extremely big - I’m an average female and they fit my male friend with an above average sized head. If you’re a female I don’t recommend"
2.0,I do not recommend this item for your consideration.  It is not constructed well and won't hold up for lots of wear.<br />The seams are not well done and the fabric is thin and flimsy.  Also the sizing is not accurate.<br />Just pass on this one.
2.0,THEse are really comfy but they run small I'm a medium in women's I'm 150 and the large was a little snug not loose at all&iacute; wantexitto wear with leggings but couldn't because the picture looks longer and in person not longer at all not bad for someone who likes a tight fit but my hoodies I like loose so not good in my book only 2 stars because they run two sizes smaller
2.0,These barely stretched a quarter of an inch and the clips didn't have much grip
2.0,"This mask is for a huge face! It covered my eyes to under my chin. It is also very stiff, especially with the filters, and the straps are a course material. I couldn't wear it long before I swapped to the standard disposable surgical mask."
2.0,"I got this for my mom and if it was for me, I would have returned it. The color was much more red than the purple that was advertised. And instead of the pattern being slanted it was straight up and down. Would not purchase again unless I was sent a new sweater that looks like the picture I thought I was purchasing to begin with."
2.0,The quality seems poor and the lace is sticking to itself. Very thin fabric. Not impressed. I bought a size up just to be on the safe side and the product appears to be size Large instead of a Medium.
2.0,"I ordered an XXXL. The arms are too small.<br />38DD, 5'6&#34; 169lbs. The material and fit is perfect every place EXCEPT the arms"
2.0,"Thin, and doesn't hold the cold, well you get what youg paid for."
2.0,"Got one in black first in medium, and loved it.  Soft, cozy, and quite oversized.  Just got a second one in green, also medium, and it was like a different sweater!  It was MUCH smaller and not as soft.  Returning it..."
2.0,"I loved this ring, despite it's sharp edges until the heart stone fell out a few weeks later. Not going to repurchase!"
2.0,This necklace was not what I thought it was picture to small to see more.<br />Did arrive as stated I did not see the word Italian anywhere on it.<br />But the service and packaging was fine.<br />If the picture were better it would help. This does not mean you wount like the products. This is just my oppinion.<br />Thank you
2.0,The set is cute but the fabric is so cheap. It does not looks like the picture.
2.0,"I was very disappointed in this sweater. While The sweater itself is cute, it is very flimsy. It is definitely for fashion not for warmth. In addition, the color was not as depicted. The color is called Rust and in the photo  it looks like it’s a pale rust.  However, the color I received  was a bright orange. For sizing it is true to size.  If you wear a small buy a small.  I went up a size and the sweater is too large for me.  However I will keep it and just wear it over a layering piece.  Also, I wanted to mention that there are no washing instructions. This is unusual; I was under the impression that clothes sold in the US had to include washing instructions.  However,  in reading through the questions and answers I see that it has to be washed in cold water and dried flat.  Just passing this on."
2.0,"Within the first day of wearing one pair, it lost both nose cushions and the lenses popped out several times.  Order accordingly -- good for emergency use only."
2.0,It still slid off my head. I don't think there was enough rubbery stuff on the inside of the headband to prevent slippage.
2.0,Caller was good
2.0,"Unfortunately, these are child size. The picture shows them compared to adult size. I have the adult size and wanted a replacement, but this is too small. Retuned."
2.0,"Very tight leggings!<br />Purple are not as tight,  so I could put them on, but the black ones will be ok for my 5 year old girl. I'm 140 lbs and 5'10"" - those leggings are way too small and tight!"
2.0,"The style is exactly what I was looking for, which is why I gave 2 stars, but I definitely got what I paid for as far as quality. If I were to ever buy leggings at the $1 store, I’m sure they would be similar to these. Not workout quality, they have zero stretch or support. The waistband has a one inch band of elastic. Don’t waste your money."
2.0,This dress is very pretty all around. But if you are taller than 5'6 don't get it. It hits above my ankle.<br /><br />5'6 130lb 34b small fit great except it was too short.
2.0,Much smaller than I needed.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:d76d86c01bab79d82894d74dd949f8d9]] I don’t like how the material is coming loosely and I just cannot wear them too embarrassing the way they looks
2.0,It was a wellmade products. However I did not like the hood design. The fit was exact and the quality was nice. However I returned it because I didn't like how it looked on me. But that is a subjective thing. Therefore should not be mark against this company.
2.0,"The leg holes on the bottoms are disproportionationately big. I kept them because my daughters loved the tops, but I am so disappointed in the bottoms. Now I have to buy another suit."
2.0,"Too small, should have expected that from a one size fits all.  Came in a pkg that seems comes from China, etc.  Probably 100 to a box.  Returned.  Didn't like color of fake fur.  Was looking more for a winter white."
2.0,much smaller than I expected
2.0,"The Truity Men's Sports Jacket Hooded Lightweight Windbreaker Water Resistant Shell is a nice looking jacket and seems to be perfect for athletic activity with a light, water resistant shell, venting in the back, and a double zipper so that you can create your own venting in the front without completely opening up the jacket.  It also has a small hood for days when you get caught in real rain.  I received two of the ""XL"" jackets (more on this below).  I liked the side zip up pockets and that you could condense it down for hiking or camping.<br /><br />That being said, there are many issues with the jacket:<br />1) The zipper is on the wrong side.  I thought this was a ""girl thing"", like buttons, but was told by the females in my house that this was not how zippers worked.  I've received MANY Chinese-made products and never seen this.<br />2) It is grossly undersized.  The first ""XL"" that I got was at most a medium and comically small.  I put it on, could barely get the zipper up (and I am not fat in the least) and looked like I was wearing children's clothes with how short the arms were.  After sending a message to Vine Voice, I received a second ""XL"" which was only slightly larger.  Still had about 8"" of my forearms sticking out of the sleeves.  Both jackets were marked ""XL"" both on the removable tag and on the jacket itself.<br />3) It is NOT water proof.  My wife poured a glass of water on the sleeve and at least part of it soaked right in.<br /><br />Overall, the Truity Men's Sports Jacket Hooded Lightweight Windbreaker Water Resistant Shell is a pretty terrible jacket.  Even if you rolled the dice and got one that fit you, the fact that it is poorly constructed and not water proof pretty much removes any usefulness other than to wear it outside on a sunny day.  Not worth it at any price."
2.0,It turned green
2.0,They were cute with good material/style for the price but way too small. I'm 5'5&#34; and I feel like they were barely long enough to cover my body. They're made in China and probably more close to those sizes...aka...way to small to compare to American sizes. I'll have to return them.
2.0,"This dress is sooo much cuter in the photos. It’s very cheaply made and I did not feel pretty in this lol. Don’t waste your time, go try something on at your local boutique :)"
2.0,"It's NOT leather. It is a very good faux leather but its not real leather. Thus it will not age like leather. I bought this because the 2 for $12 was decent and I thought of the nylon one as a bonus, but that's not my first choice. I'm disappointed and will be returning it because I was buying primarily for the leather."
2.0,"Based on reviews I ordered a medium. I am 5&#34;5&#34; and 115lbs. I really wanted to love these, but they ended up leaving a horrible c*mel toe and where they sat on my hips just accentuated the slight bit of extra fluff I have there. I feel if the side straps weren't so wide, they could have worked but it was just too much material there. Back they go."
2.0,To small for my wrist
2.0,Cheap material and small
2.0,My POV: The default image is not at all what this dress will look like on you. (I was sure hoping) The dress is like material of a halloween costume. Not material you'd wear to a wedding or the title Evening Cocktail party. I got this dress for an upcoming wedding unfortunately will be returning. The default image looks like it is a bodycon dress. I have the type of figure as the default image shows but it did not since to my waist as shown.
2.0,Love this shirt but the stitching lacks. One strap broke after the 3rd use and now it looks awkward if I do not get it fixed.
2.0,These were bigger than I thought they were going to be.  Not for me.
2.0,My autistic daughter was in love with this watch! It got splashed while either washing hands or brushing teeth then started glitching. It no longer worked and she was heart broken.
2.0,it faded after the first wash.
2.0,"Really cheap.  One of the lenses fell out when I was cleaning them off.  The nose bridge is also not placed correctly in the design, so they ride high on the nose.  For a dollar or two these would have been fine, but they are way over priced."
2.0,I am returning this suit. I ordered an XL because I was worried about it running small. The breast area was very big with no support and I don’t think a LG would be good because it would be shorter in length. I prefer a longer top because I have a long torso. I struggle with that with a lot of suits unfortunately. The top most definitely would open up and expose my stomach with wind and swimming and I didn’t care for that. I did like the bottoms! They are higher waisted than most suits and the ties are cute IMO. Good bottom coverage.
2.0,"I’m a shoe snob but thought I’d try these. Very cheap and bigger than I ordered, fitting was loose and I have a wide foot"
2.0,This material is cheap and hot
2.0,"No thank you. It's sturdy enough, but there's no shape."
2.0,"The gloves seem warm and well made. Unfortunately, the inner liner must have been sewn to the outer layer incorrectly because we can't get our fingers in them anymore. They only slide on about half way."
2.0,The suit was nice the cut was to small the  skirt was like a size 10 I am a 14 the buttons fell off cheap
2.0,Extra large women's size but fit like a child's size.
2.0,Color was good. Material was cheap and shirt was short in tail length.
2.0,Fit lime a large instead of a 2x
2.0,"They work well, but the printed part (tie-dye, paw prints, etc) is wearing off. We're on our 2nd one as they both have torn."
2.0,"It started wearing off very quickly. It's a cheap ring. I wanted a big, obnoxious ring and it did that job, but it started wearing off pretty quickly."
2.0,Cheap. Definitely not worth $134. When I looked at the seller page the product wasn't on there. Only the back of the watch is stainless steel. The band is very much light flimsy aluminum. The clasp is a bit cheap. They sent me the wrong color
2.0,"I normally fit just fine into the size I ordered, but this was nowhere near my size."
2.0,"The photo is misleading. It’s more of a salmon color, and not the tan color in the photo"
2.0,"These are very cute but they were extremely small, even though they claim to run true to size.  She wears a 9 toddler size and her 9T shoes (New Balance, Stride Rite, Carters and Cherokee brands) are a little big on her but she couldn't even get her foot all the way down into these.  On top of being small they are very narrow so I don't think even ordering the next size up would work.  Maybe 2-3 sizes bigger would fit. Didn't return these as shipping costs to return are half of what I paid."
2.0,"The top of the side bends out, almost as if I bought it from Ross or something.  Anyhow still a pretty purse to look at when it’s not bending"
2.0,My daughter is 5 and wanted unicorn socks to wear for soccer practice but these are either too long and the black part is supposed to be the heel or these are defective. There was a lot of extra fabric in the toe area so I am thinking these are meant for taller kids. The black part still seems a bit odd though and out of place on these pastel colored socks. Shes pretty bummed that we will have to be returning these.
2.0,"They ride up, the short legs and pinch. THere is no rubber grip tape to keep them in place."
2.0,I have a small head and it still didn't fit
2.0,"Better large then small I always say but, the logo doesn't look like the picture... the logo looks very faded & cheaply done afraid to wash it."
2.0,Seemed cute but didn't fit me right
2.0,"This is really large!  I might be able to bunch it up and wear it still, but not sure."
2.0,"I love the look of these swim shoes. They look like real sneakers. I wear them in the pool with my kids. However, I only wore them 3 times before hoes developed at the toes. I am disappointed."
2.0,Very see through and cheap material
2.0,"I got a size bigger than she is now, thinking my daughter would have room to kick and dance, but they strained and don't give equal coverage throughout. Almost immediately noticeable."
2.0,the color is great the fabric OK but very cropped. just covers my chest
2.0,"I can't even describe what color it is...  maroonish mud?  neckline uneven, so I can't wear it because I can't hide that in a summer dress.  Went in the trash immediately."
2.0,I wore a pair in my nose less then a week and I got huge rash and just bad reaction to it but seller refunded me pretty quick and was good help
2.0,I love this suit but make sure you order a much larger one than you think you need. I am a bigger lady and ordered per their size chart and the bottoms fit great but the top not so much fits like 2 sizes to small. If you are a bigger woman then make sure you order much larger than your normal size per their chart. I did have many emails with company and they are trying to help but not much bigger size for the top will make bottoms to big and I waited almost 2 months for the suits to come into begin with.
2.0,I ordered a size up and it was still two sizes too small. Very disappointed :(
2.0,"Runs extremely small. Fits your head tight, not snug, and would fit a toddler comfortably. I have an average size head. The Pom Pom is about half the size of what the picture depicts."
2.0,These fit very small. Almost like they are for kids...or an adult with a tiny face.
2.0,"Bought it back in January 2020 didn’t last a year, the bottom part of the shoes is coming off(flapping)."
2.0,Had to return it ////// quit working
2.0,"If you have a cheap watch, great get this. If not, go to a shop and get it done. This thing is cheap"
2.0,Cheap cotton material not what I expected.It does not really look like the material and the photo at all and its large on the bottom
2.0,"This product claims to be cotton, but it feels synthetic. The ear loops are so small that the mask is pulled up to your eyes, looking more like a ninja than a socially responsible person. Fully worn and stretched around my neck, with ear loops attached, looks and feels like I’m reliving my own birth."
2.0,"The dress is cute but smaller than expected. Still fits ok but I constantly have to tug it down. And one of the straps broke the second time I went to put the dress on. Honestly I don’t know why I keep buying dresses from Amazon, they are always so cheaply made."
2.0,These run very large. I ordered the small/medium and there's almost an extra inch of fabric on the fingers! The inside fleece layer isn't that large but the outside fabric layer is so big it makes them awkward. I can't imagine skiing with these on so I will be returning them. If they had a smaller size I would be willing to give it a go..
2.0,these shoes would be great if they were a little lower  so tall to hard to walk in
2.0,I ordered it in what I thought to be 2 sizes large than what I wear and it was still too small.
2.0,"Love the purse, but NOT THE COLOR! Would like to exchange for CAMEL COLOR!"
2.0,The hole to pull your ponytail through is very small and inflexible...it tore the first time I tried to pull my hair through. I returned it.
2.0,"If the price is too good to be true, it probably is. The stone is very obviously fake and feels plastic. As other reviews have said it is not sterling silver either.<br /><br />Only buy if you are looking for a piece of costume jewelry, it looks pretty but everything about it is fake.<br /><br />If this review was informative please mark it as helpful."
2.0,Terrible. Material doesn't expand a bit. Nylon isn't best material for a backpack where you need to &#34;pack&#34; items.<br /><br />Too many zippers. Too many pockets that are not large enough. Cheap.
2.0,"Color was pretty and fit well except for the sleeves. The sleeves were tight around my upper arm. I actually bought two one for me and one for my daughter. Mine came with the belt missing. And my daughter's came so wrinkled it looked like it had been slept in. So I washed it and it shrunk like 5 inches. Sent them both back. Would not buy this brand again. Two stats because the color was spot on, but sadly the material is garbage."
2.0,The half &#34;pearl&#34; popped right out so easily. U had to super glue it. Wasn't that hard. Other than that its cute
2.0,"These bras are comfortable to a point and then they just are awful, at least for me. First of all they give me a uni-boob which looks awful and then as time goes by they squish you until you start to swell around your ribs and it huts. I would recommend sizing up one size at least especially if you are a 36D or more."
2.0,"I ordered Gray and received black. Very disappointed, but not worth the cost to return."
2.0,"Unfortunately, this only lasted like a day. One of the ears doesnt go up anymore. :("
2.0,The headband was so tight
2.0,The blue wore off seriously after about 2 weeks
2.0,"I bought the Beige one, and the color was completely off from what is shown. The picture shows almost a cream color, and the sweater that arrived was a very yellow, mustardy color. It was also itchy."
2.0,"It was cute at first. Its a soft, thin material, lasted two months. Its falling apart already! Wore only a few times. Cant believe its coach!"
2.0,The material was silky.. the colors didn't stand out as expected but eh I give it a 5
2.0,I do not like it at all...
2.0,Nice looking shirt but the decal starts to lifts off the shirt as soon as you take off the protective paper.
2.0,"This sweatshirt doesn't have any give and it shrinks.  I am 5'5"", 125 lbs and ordered a medium.  It's too small now and the head hole is really hard to stretch over my head (which is not freakishly large)."
2.0,I bought the coral & its not coral. Its not even peach. Its pink. I didn't bother trying it on because it's not what I wanted. Returning.
2.0,I was very happy when I bought this item I had high hopes for it. When it arrived it fit perfectly it was very flattering however after a couple of washes by hand I may add it has completely lost its form it's now too large and stretched out. I am very disappointed because I wanted to buy a couple more but I'm afraid the same thing would happen.
2.0,"If your kid is like mine and wants flippy sequins, be forewarned: the sequins don't flip as described"
2.0,"The white inside liner wants to always come out,  while your wearing it.  And when it always does,  it is not cool."
2.0,Shirt is darker in person and I didnt realize it had black stitching that I honestly dont care for. Shirt also was alittle big but still wouldve kept it if not for the stitching.
2.0,"I loved the looks of the watch.  The price was unusually low.  BUT it came to me broken and when I contacted the seller and<br />Amazon, they wanted me to send it back with me paying shipping, which was more than the watch to begin with."
2.0,Color is NOT champagne. To me it's more of a peach color and the detachable bow is slightly off from the dress itself. I took pics of the dress next to my wedding dress which is champagne/ivory and my bridesmaids dress which is pink. The dress is cute but not champagne in color and the skirt has green glitter.
2.0,Glasses came with scratches on lenses.
2.0,"The material in the shorts do not match the top. So I will have to pair each with something else. I was excited about getting this but disappointed with what I received. However, the material for the top is nice and soft but the shorts is way too big."
2.0,looked off whire..
2.0,It would have been exactly what I needed but it was way too small and I ordered it a size too big to begin with
2.0,Dislike the flashing red light not orange glow
2.0,"Snagged out of the package, shiny an not quite opaque. But grab a long sweater and wear them the a holiday party or maybe two. For the price they will do."
2.0,"So these were comfy shoes that I rarely used because we have been living in warm climes. But when I was in winter cold, I would wear them. It’s been perhaps 30 times in 10 years. For my foot, they are comfy.<br /><br />However, 1) the Velcro doesn’t hold. Don’t get the design of Velcro on one side when the other has an adjustable mechanism. 2) it is advertised for plantar fasciitis but the insert is barely appropriate. And 3) the worst part…the sole completely split in two parts and heel part fell off! Fortunately I was only one block from the house. Unfortunately I cannot recommend. Yes, they look clumsy and big but they were comfortable except for the silly Velcro part and the less than good quality of materials used. As you can see, the shoes are barely used. And they weren’t cheap."
2.0,"Thin, what fleece lining? I've got leggings thicker than these. Anyway I had bought these for my husband who's 6ft, 175lbs. Got a large. They were very short and very wide. Returned, no other size would work clearly."
2.0,"The point of buying this shirt was to have some support without seeing my bra like most of my white tank tops. This shirt, however, still showed the padding. The padding also was too high and felt awkward. Did not fit like workout shirts with built in padding."
2.0,"I LOVED the top of this outfit. I ordered a L and I'm 5'6"" about 175 lbs. The top fit amazing, 38 C, but the bottoms are so small they are unwearable. I don't think I could size up for the bottoms and still have the top fit okay."
2.0,"I really liked the color of the dress but the quality was cheap looking. Also, when I first opened the package there was a funky smell coming from the dress."
2.0,Cheaply and sloppily made. Not impressed.
2.0,These are children’s hats!<br />There is no depth.<br />So small.<br />Only two stars because they are cute and look exactly how pictured. I’m just so upset that these barely fit. And I do not have a large head. If you have a super slender flat top head shape—-these are for you!!
2.0,Look nice but they are way too big and I’ll never wear them. Really wasted money
2.0,Rips were shorter than pictured and shorts were cut small!
2.0,The styling was not quite what is shown.  The material was poor quality.  The total effect is cheap.
2.0,Not Worth It.
2.0,Product came ripped
2.0,"I didn't like the length of the sleeve, they were too short and they were big. The material that this robe is made out of reminded me of a dish rag."
2.0,"I bought a silver one. Very Pretty. However, the decorative brass hardware falls off easily. Used only twice."
2.0,"Small fits like a child’s size 10. Fit fine for a size 4 in the bottom half, but couldn’t fit over a 34c chest size in the top. The sleeves were oddly tight and short as well. The color and fabric was cute, but there was no way to make it work. As a size 2/4, I’d probably need a large in this dress. For reference, I’m 5’3” and 120lbs."
2.0,"This is a good looking watch but it's light in weight and feels cheap, plus mine came broken, my date/day window liner was detached. I was expecting more for $33."
2.0,"Quality not as expected. Edges rough, catches on blouse.<br /><br />Necklace does not lay flat."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:3346144107fc2cb1639876f2e839128e]] This is the second one of these I bought. On the first one, the zipper broke. Then after less than a month, the pocket on this one tore."
2.0,Is toooooo large for me. I decided acording to the table chart but it is not real.
2.0,Both pairs of earrings were broken when they arrived.  I was able to repair the roses but not the green ones.  Disappointing gift.
2.0,Smaller than it should be
2.0,After the first wash the stud In the middle came off and the blue started to come apart from the black. I sewed it fixed and the next wash i lost an underwire. Would not buy again.
2.0,Tubes of elastic that roll themselves up the thigh while riding defeating the purpose of keeping thighs from rubbing.
2.0,"This went great with my family's costumes.  I was Cruella deVille.  Only problem, I left a trail of feathers!"
2.0,Polyester material. Not cotton as description.
2.0,Love the color and the length. Hate that the end up looking like stretched out socks by the end of the night.
2.0,"Definitely not what I was expecting. Smaller than it is pictured, very thin. Dissapointed with this purchase, was supposed to be a Christmas gift."
2.0,Loose in the under arm area.
2.0,"I read all the reviews and thought I’d take a chance. The top of the dress was very stiff and not comfortable, also runs very small. I was going to send it back but it was going to be a minimum of $50 to return. I ended up donating it!"
2.0,"I got these as a replacement for another pair of Duduma sunglasses I purchased.  They are very durable sunglasses, but the plastic coating on them is very cheap.  It has nearly completely peeled off the sunglasses.  Overall I am satisfied with the purchase, just would expect a longer life than 8 months on sunglasses.  Ive bought sunglasses from Walmart that have lasted me years.  Guess I know what I will be buying next time."
2.0,"As soon as I opened the plastic bag the necklace & earrings were in, one of the strands on the necklace was broken & beads went everywhere.  I do not feel comfortable wearing it, afraid the strands are too fragile & will break at any time.  Have not worn it at all.  Will donate to Goodwill."
2.0,I was dissatisfied with the size and shape of the tunnels because they were not 1/2 inch gauges nor were they fully round. However the little red bag they came in is proving to be useful. So it's half half good/bad
2.0,cheap quality.  Holes starting to develop
2.0,Not as big as it looks in the picture
2.0,"cheap quality; inside zipper arrived broken. sending it back for fund, do not want a replacement."
2.0,"Bonita falda pero no era como se esperaba, la tela es muy transparente. Por lo tanto la devolví."
2.0,love tshirt dresses normally wear a large for shape or xl for comfort. Gpt this in large and it runs really small. Large was more like a size 6ish arms wear tight and my boobs were restricted. Sending back may try larger size
2.0,Where the are held rest on the top of the connection point to the watch. With both pieces being metal you might scuff your watch. It also makes you watch rest funny because of how high up the connection point is. Maybe I got a bad band.
2.0,"Haven’t even used the product, I’m sure it’s good and all like the reviews. But the bottle came in broken and half of it was empty within the case"
2.0,"Unfortunately, it fits like a boat. lol Not very flattering"
2.0,Nothing to dress…. No lining. Cut fabric and no structure.
2.0,Would have liked it if there was a closure on top.
2.0,Only 4 out of 6 pieces fit. I can only wear 3 though because the most ornate one cake with missing stones. I do really like the jeweled hanging ring. The retainer is comfortable but I will fall down if I have to blow my nose. Working during allergy season can be a problem.
2.0,Ordered two sizes just in case. Both were too small. Much shorter than picture shown. Very thin material. Colors were different.
2.0,Not meant for septums way to small
2.0,terrible very uncomfortable
2.0,Was too small and not adjustable
2.0,These are cheap even for the low price.
2.0,these are thin and way too small. No use whatsoever for swollen feet.
2.0,At first my husband loved these flip flops. After 2 weeks of daily wear the piece between his toes broke so in the trash they went.☹️
2.0,"Cuter in the picture than when it arrives.  It appears online to be too nice of a product for the low price.  However, in reality, the quality is similar to that offered by a local (albeit specialty) dollar store in my town, but for (obviously) way more than a dollar.  Comes with a cute a little pouch.  Packaged nicely and securely.  Just a very low quality product (even understanding you're not trying to buy a high quality of jewelry...)"
2.0,Looks too cheap for the price
2.0,The insert is very stiff and bulky feeling
2.0,Returned glasses. Larger and heavier than I wanted.
2.0,"I have ordered this bra twice. The first one was perfect but it good damaged. The second one sticks so hard, it hurts to take it off. Also my breasts have purple marks from removing it. The package was different every time. I wish I received the same one i ordered the first time."
2.0,"This item was a major disappointment in that i was looking for a slim light weight watch to replace my Casio dive watch for everyday use.<br />Its too big too clunky almost the same weight (.02 oz diff) as my multi-function dive watch The latch is almost impossible to do with 2 hands As always it was too big around and needed to be downsized,but still the center stuck up and snagged on shirt ,sweater and jacket cuffs I did not get anywhere near water so &#34;water proof&#34; claim was untested<br />Neat Idea ,but must fall under useless GIZMO title<br />The only good thing that got it a 2 star was it was inexpensive"
2.0,Size 7 was more like size 5 -way to small and the picture of the shoe looked better than the real shoe
2.0,These handkerchiefs are rough on your noise.  Hard to go from kleenex to these.
2.0,Sweatshirt sucks. Waste of $60. Sleeves are tight fits way to long
2.0,"Runs small, and tall. Seams fell apart quickly."
2.0,Size up two sizes it runs really all
2.0,"I ordered a ""medium"" by the size chart and it's too big. I'd recommend ordering smaller than your size if you order. Also, the colour is a lot darker than it is on the image, and the material isn't very comfortable."
2.0,The item received was not as expected or described.
2.0,"This is for..I have no idea. I guess for a person who wants to wear this around the home?  It's not very well made. There was a snag on the material when I received it and it didn't help.  The top has such minimal support that I can't imagine a woman with larger breasts wearing this comfortably.  The bottom is not well made, either. The minimal cloth feeling doesn't feel that good, the polyester material is not cotton and feels like it.  This feels cheap.  It looks cheap.  If you are a larger woman and this fits you tightly, you will see that it is not very supportive. Is that what is meant by ""sexy""? Not sure.  Two stars."
2.0,Strap broke.  The plastic piece first time I wore it.  Other than that I loved it.
2.0,The charms tarnish
2.0,"This necklace  is very tiny and hard to read, was way to pricey for such a small item."
2.0,"Not quite what I expected for $20.  It had the cheap, papery feel of a Halloween hat, and had been crushed to fit in the box, leaving wrinkles in the papery material."
2.0,This item was listed at $40 or at least the buyer I bought it from. I returned it because it was overpriced. The color is not as bright as it is shown in the picture. I bought a pair from Nordstrom and like it.
2.0,"sleeves are too tight and long!  otherwise it flows nicely, doesn't stick to your slacks."
2.0,It’s pretty enough. It looks better in the picture. Very loose.
2.0,"I REALLY wanted to like these but I just can’t love them. They are scratchy, too short for my 5’11” frame and VERY see through (see pics). They also have the WORST elastic band that manufacturers sometimes put in athletic pants (see pic). The waistband of these pants is a simple traditional elastic band inside a folded piece of athletic pant material so it tends to cut into you while wearing. They come up VERY high (and I have a long torso) but since they are not made of a thicker material, they do not “hold you in” like most compression-type athletic pants do. The pockets on the sides are nice and one of the main reasons I ordered them but unfortunately don’t overpower the faults."
2.0,This product broke easily. I accidently dropped it on the floor and it broke.
2.0,"Just a small tip of what the picture looks like. But I didn't expect much anyways. The good stuff is sold in stores, and at events."
2.0,"There's not much to expect for a set of this quantity at the price, but I'm still a bit disappointed. The earrings arrived a bit tarnished and the gold coating wasn't smooth, shiny, or authentic looking. The necklaces were better quality, but still not great. As some other reviewers have said, it's very much ""costume jewelry"" and not good enough quality for any nicer occasion or daily use."
2.0,"I wasn't a big fan was too big and didn't look like the picture, wasn't stylish at all."
2.0,"It doesn't fit as much as the advertisement says it does! Pretty cheaply made, too."
2.0,The 2X fit like a regular size 14. The size was misrepresented and does not fit a plus-size woman.
2.0,"This dress is very cheap. The lining is thin and see through, the lace stitching is unraveling in some parts, it just feels cheap. I bought this for a costume, so I'm going to try to make it work, but if you have a really nice affair and are considering this dress, I would keep looking. I've gotten less expensive dresses with better quality, so while this wasn't an arm and a leg, I still had hopes for a better overall dress."
2.0,"The key ring comes apart way to easy, almost lost my key. I will not use it anymore. If anyone wants it, they can have it for free."
2.0,"Run small, we did not return in time"
2.0,The pieces fell off after one week of wearing it
2.0,Material wasn't what I expected.  Not comfy like my other dresses similar to this.
2.0,"Didn't work for my large chest.  The print on the bottom doesn't line up with the print on the top.  Nice material, though."
2.0,"Like others have said they are absolutely beautiful, but unfortunately my experience is not very good. I ordered a size 6 and size 12, and my 12 fits very well but unfortunately they sent a size 5 instead of size 6 and it's way too small. I emailed them to see what they could but they have ignored me. I was going to just order the 6mm band by itself in a size 6 but it's not unavailable and so I'm stuck with a ring that is way too small for my partner."
2.0,I've used merino wool on many other occasions and this balaclava doesn't seem to have the same properties as my other apparels. It started to stink up pretty fast.
2.0,They look nice looking at it without it on. It just didn't look nice on me like I expected it to.
2.0,"Extremely see through , I’m a size 38 DD and yea not very good quality material"
2.0,I liked the way it looked on the model. I got the Medium which is what I always wear.  When I tried it the neck was very large like a woman’s cut.  The shirt itself was also too big for it being a US Medium.  If you want to give this tank a try go 1 size smaller.  It would be useful for the seller to post the model’s weight and height  plus size he is wearing to gauge how big these run.  I am not as buff as the model but I do have a slim athletic build.<br /><br />I ended up giving it to my wife and it looks better on her due to that ridiculously large neck.  I posted pictures of me wearing this tank.  I am 165lbs 6ft tall.<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to read my review and photos of this product.  I hope it has been helpful in providing you with more information.
2.0,"My niece received the order she loves them unfortunately the lights are broken, but she didn’t want to return them cuz she needs them for her school Xmas program . Just disappointed."
2.0,"To be fair, this pattern on this dress is SOO CUUUTE, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Other than that, disappointing: it was sewn lopsidedly, so that one side of the collar was 1-2&#34; longer than the other side, which made the longer side stick out 1-2&#34; from my chest in a VERY noticeable way with large gaping.<br />Also be warned the fabric is very sheer - even with nude underwear you would probably need a slip. (Which to me defeats the purpose of having a summer dress since adding a slip would mean it would no longer be good in the heat)<br />Very disappointing because minus the defect it would have been flattering, but even then with how sheer it is I would have had to send it back. Sadness!<br />Also to note: the seller sent me the wrong size the first time I ordered this (XL instead of Small) and wasn't able to fix it or send me a new one - they just told me to contact Amazon. So I had to return it and re-order."
2.0,"Didn't work when purchased, battery was dead & not positioned properly. Very cheap!"
2.0,It's flat on one side.
2.0,"This jacket is not what I expected. In the photo, it looks like a soft, flannel shirt. Instead, it is stiff, big, and bulky."
2.0,"Pretty colors, but described as a women's tunic. This is clearly a large man's shirt. I am returning this shirt."
2.0,The material is very lose knit and kind of sloppy. Pretty color violet
2.0,I had purchase one a few  years ago that the quantity was much better than this once.
2.0,"Very cute, but it worn out in two days material not the best"
2.0,Thin material. Not what I thought that I was getting.
2.0,Fit as described however very cling like to your body clings to every “roll” not really made for your average plus size girl if you get my drift
2.0,The size is accurate but very boxy fit that is not flattering.
2.0,"Absolutely loved this top....till I looked at myself in the mirror at the back... the part on the back that's ""frayed"" down the middle of the back mage me look like a camel or a horse hahaha in the lighter beige color at least... thought about cutting it close to the material but then if I didn't like it still wouldn't be able to return.. so I just returned it instead!! Might try the black one.. doesn't seem as obvious on the black... wish they had it without that on it because i really did love the sweater!!!"
2.0,Too big for any face.
2.0,the stone fell out
2.0,Super hard material
2.0,Very wrong color. Brick red turns out to be bright orange.
2.0,"The large was insanely small. I usually wear an 8/10, and this was no where close to fitting. Disappointed!"
2.0,"They shrunk, even in cold water. No use to me now."
2.0,Very thin. Skin tight.
2.0,"They look good and fit well, but they are advertised as ""super dark"", which is what got me to buy them as i have an eye condition that makes me light sensitive. They are only average, and certainly not ""SUPER dark"". It also arrived in an envelope--- not even a thin cloth sack like the others I have bought.This is important, as even tiny scratches render these types of glasses unpleasant to use. If you need something even a little darker than average, don't buy these."
2.0,"I just don't know why someone would scent clothing you're going to sell to other people, or maybe it was where it was stored.... But this sweater smells TERRIBLE! Like old lady perfume was spilled on it! I have asthma and there's just no way I could wear this!"
2.0,Had to send back as it did not keep time and when I tried to set it the stem came out immediately all the way.
2.0,Does not stand up to an individual who is in a wheelchair on oak floors
2.0,Material catches on everything and had snags in the cloth on the first wearing.
2.0,Too small for my needs and difficult to get into.
2.0,"The material is see through, must wear some garnet underneath it for this dress to be wearable."
2.0,"The dress arrived fast but appeared to be a green color, after taking it out the bag I realized it was inside out and the lining is green.<br />The fit was too tight and I couldn't zip it up all the way, but I was happy with the look, so I took the dress to get altered and hemmed. But seamstress said the reason it wouldn't zip up was because the zipper was sewn in at an angle. Basically to put in a new zipper, repair the angle problem, and the additional hemming would cost me MORE than I paid for this dress. Sadly, I am returning this dress."
2.0,The sizing was way bigger than your average size 2! I wear a size 5 in women's which is about a 3 in girls but this shoe was over an inch too big for even me!
2.0,"I like the design and it feels fairly sturdy, but I've only had it for a few weeks and the clasp has already worn down. It will often fall off of my wrist randomly during the day."
2.0,"Purchased for pain.  Bracelet is very large, fits half way up my arm.  Not sure about pain reduction, haven't noticed much difference, probably just me."
2.0,"Yes, they are lightweight. Yes, the toe is really strong. But.... there is no discernable tread. One might as well be ice skating. These would be of no use, and may even be forbidden in most worksites. They also need a bit more support. If they had had decent slip-resistant tread, I would have considered putting in after-market arch supports. The only other question would be how to go about cleaning them. The sweater-like material is lightweight and comfortable, but a good hosing is about all one could do to clean them. These are not really a work boot. Cute and fashionable, but definitely unrealistic and unsafe for any real work."
2.0,"Shipping went fine, price was good. RIP BELT 5/19/2017 - 7/2/2017 (Broke in two pieces)"
2.0,"I really love this blouse very nice , and fit great but I would have to say I'm rating it a 2 because the blouse smelled very horrible , I am disappointed in that."
2.0,cute but was too big ... this is for men wrists
2.0,Mirror coating flaked off in the first week. I loved these when they arrived and wore them daily. The first time they got wet they were ruined! Now they look terrible
2.0,Poorly made....not worth the money
2.0,"Turned my nieces finger green , wondering if it’s real silver"
2.0,"Returned, looked cheap and the keyhole fit weird and was unflattering."
2.0,hurt my eyes giving me a headache very disappointed
2.0,I was playing wearing his jersey during soccer game and sweat little bit and  made my white shorts all read very bad quality 😱
2.0,"Dress was actually orange not red and was shorter than the first dress I ordered in the same size. Overall, length is tolerable with flats but color way off and had loose threads and a patch of threads sticking out from the seam in the stomach area. I took a picture next to an actual red dress I own for proof of contrast.<br /><br />Comfort wise, it's extremely soft and malleable but so was the blue dress which fit more true to size."
2.0,We bought this watch the first time and it lasted 3-4 years this was the second time<br />We bought the watch- first one the band broke. But my son 15 loved it - this watch we bought was supposed to be exactly the same - I re-ordered. It was a dud! Lasted a week water got inside ;( always have to be careful -stinks!
2.0,Very poor quality belt. It broke immediately upon trying on before event. Quite disappointed. The skirt itself is fine but we can't find a belt anywhere to match it and now can't use it.
2.0,"While the shoes are cute, within the first week the sole was separating from the shoe.  My daughter did wear them to school every day though so if your looking for more of a sometimes shoe, these would be cute.  I may have just gotten a dud pair, not sure."
2.0,"This septum ring is beautiful, except after two days of wearing it two of the bigger gems fell out. So sad! Because other than that it was perfect! Adorably dainty, with just the perfect amount of pizzazz! 😿😿😿"
2.0,It looks like my 3 yr old painted it. It’s thick plastic. It doesn’t have any quality to it.
2.0,Pretty but the post broke off one when I attempted to wear them for only the 2nd time. Very disappointing.
2.0,"Prior to my wedding, I was looking into different silicone ring options as I frequently spend time backpacking and wanted a ring that I could abuse and potentially lose while backcountry without much repercussion. I found Qalo pretty easily, as they advertise pretty much everywhere (google adwords, amazon ads, etc.). I ordered from Qalo thinking they must be the real deal, after seeing all the positive reviews.<br /><br />Well, after trying the ring, I can safely say you should skip it. If you don't want to skip this particular ring style, just order any of the 5-10 dollar competitor rings, they are identical. My biggest gripe is that as others have mentioned, the rings catch moisture in them. The letters etched into the bottom of the ring, along with the flat surface of the interior of the ring trap moisture in and keep it there unless you take off the ring, flip it inside out and dry it off. This is an incredible hassle after you wash your hands, or do just about anything involving moisture (working out, washing dishes, taking a shower, etc.). Also just a note: I was taking the ring off at night as recommended.<br /><br />The design of the ring is overly-simple and it doesn't do anything to address using the ring in the way they advertise it most frequently: active life. I'll be returning this ring and trying a &#34;Groove Life&#34; ring, which you can google. They seem to have addressed all of my concerns with this particular ring, including making the ring breathable."
2.0,"My son was super excited to buy this, he really liked it but the first time he wore it the spikes started falling off and got lost. Also the red light for the eyes are so bright in your eyes you can’t even see. Way too much money for this junk."
2.0,"Runs huge, will have to return as I have no clue when this will fit my baby.."
2.0,Order a size larger a little snug near the mid waist..like the shirt though.
2.0,Too rough/distressed looking buckle for my taste but might be good enough for some people.
2.0,I love the glasses but the frame was all scratched😏 when i got them.  Not cool 👎🏼
2.0,"Bought this for my son-in-law thinking he would LOVE it. But, either he's got a big head or the hat is too small, but he could barely fit into it and ended up donating it. Kind of an expensive mistake. If you have a little head, this is a cute hat."
2.0,"Fits great, but the length hit mid calf. It was more a midi than a maxi. If the length were correct it would have been perfect!"
2.0,It does NOT protect you from the rain.
2.0,Back piece that comes off to replace battery broke on 2nd day. Looks great but very cheaply made
2.0,It works for one or two nights. Probably all you need.
2.0,"These were ... ok. They are very soft and stretchy but feminine items do NOT stick, which is a problem. So I will be returning these."
2.0,This item watch missing a bracelet . ( it suppose to have exactly what I ordered )
2.0,No where near XL. I'll stick to Jockey and Evolv.
2.0,"I ordered two of these, one large and one XL, just to make sure I had one that fit. I also received two Christmas versions from a friend, same seller (nagoo).<br /><br />Firstly, what you see in the picture is not what you will receive. There are numerous shared images and you can plainly see it has some weird gathered waist and doesn't have an a-line.<br /><br />I guess the seller doesn't give any effs about properly representing their products. The material is soft, the prints were nice and stitching seemed fine...they just don't have the same style or measurements as advertised. The large was too long and wonky. I suspect the pattern was actually for maternity, as it fits just like a maternity dress I own. (hugs the butt, poofs at the belly)"
2.0,"I ordered a 10.5 and it appears that I received a 11 or 11.5,  so the fitting was a little larger than expected. I normally where 10 but I ordered a 1/2 size bigger. There's no indication on the sandals of its size to enable me to confirm. There is a number (2026-46) written on the inside upper - don't know what it means. I can work with the size though but the BIGGEST issue I have is that I received the wrong colour. I ordered the (light brown) khaki colour listed but I received a light green colour. That is like ordering a scarlet red Ferrari and receiving one of a cyan colour - DISAPPOINTING!!"
2.0,They ripped when I put them on and balled my fist up to get the feel for them. I am sad that they are not the right size.
2.0,These are cute but unlike the picture mine both face the same direction. They are very small which is ok but my long nails make them really hard to handle. I wanted them for my second piercing and they are fine if I can get them on.
2.0,"Soooo cute. But way way too small. Even bought a large and it was too small. Unfortunate, bc I love the design."
2.0,I was very disappointed when I received this mouse pad. It was printed on a black background and the black background completely dulled out the beautiful picture that was printed on it. As far as mine is concerned it is not a lovely bright picture that is shown. It is much darker and the pretty pink barely comes through. I tossed it aside and I doubt that I will ever use it.
2.0,Smudged really easily as well as easily scratched. Smudges are really tough to remove
2.0,"I just received this purse and I am sending it back. It smells and has a creepy, oily feel to it. The description says it's leather but there's no tag in the purse listing the materials. If you're sensitive to chemicals and odors you'll be bothered by the smell it emits."
2.0,"The size chart says the XL fit a 36&#34; chest and after waiting for MONTHS, I finally received the t-shirt and it is too big!! It actually fit my 210lb husband!!! This is ridiculous! Please provide accurate information for your buyers! I gave the extra one star for the quality. I felt like its of pretty decent quality for the price.. but its USELESS if the size chart is WRONG!"
2.0,"This shirt is a cute design, but cheaply made with rabbit skin brand which is notorious for having wide, but short shirts. Nobody wants their little boy running around with a half- shirt, totally unappealing! Disappointed, especially with the price!"
2.0,The style was cute description size was inaccurate
2.0,"While the product was expected to be costume jewelry, the earrings came jumbled & we're missing a few. Not pairs, single earrings...so we have one earring of several pairs that would have been complete if all matches were there. We got a total of 28 earrings (should be 32), but only 12 were actual pairs (4 earrings with no matches). We didn't find this out until it was well past the return date as they were purchased for a gift & events had to be postponed. Also, the backings used to add comfort by cushion are not attached, they came in a separate bag....which would have been fine if they actually had a way of attaching to the earrings. They fall right out of the loops that should hold them. We had to resort to hot gluing them on as otherwise they are uncomfortable. Disappointed to say the least."
2.0,It doesnt have the clips that undo for breast feeding it's just a very wide v so your breast just topple out which is not very comfy also it runs small so order a size up
2.0,Cute but synthetic feel
2.0,The sizes are way to big and the dresses don't look as pictured. I ordered 2 different dresses.  Adjusted the size down and it was still to big.  NOt ordering from this vendor again.
2.0,I’m 5’2 115lbs and size small was too big
2.0,Couldn’t wear them because the material is too thin and see through. You could totally see my under ware and the pants pockets. Too bad cause they’re really cute.
2.0,Everyone who saw these loved then and I was placing to buy other colors until the bear came off the hook within the first day of me wearing them.  But they were only 1.78 so I guess you get what you pay for!
2.0,"I couldn't adjust the time. It came in a timely manner. It looked nice, but wasn't functional."
2.0,I’m sorry but the shirt really isn’t what I expected
2.0,Fell apart before I wore them out of the house.
2.0,The hat had a strong chemical smell. The plastic piece that is used to synch the elastic band to adjust size would not hold.
2.0,"Daughter was so excited to receive these and she loves them, but out of the 3 pair, two have stones that have fallen out."
2.0,"I've heard great things about Lands End Ponte sheaths, so I had high hopes. I was very disappointed with this purchase. The dress was tight, and the panel at the stomach left weird, lumpy lines."
2.0,Wide so your feet will slide straight through
2.0,"This Nine West peep toe pump runs very small. I wear a size 7.5 in all dress shoes, including other Nine West shoes, and other patent peep toe shoes. However, these ran so small I couldn't get them on. While I know that most shoes do stretch out, I knew these wouldn't stretch because of the synthetic material. A size 8 might have fit but I ended up selecting a higher quality show at Nordstom."
2.0,I got this for my daughter.  It arrived on time.  She wanted to paint KISS faces on her brothers.  She did not like it and said it was hard to work with.  I just bought it because it was cheap.  Will not purchase again.  I swear they sell it for $2 at Wal-Mart during Halloween.
2.0,"I really, really wanted to like this dress. The print was super cute and fun, but the material was so thin and cheap it was like wearing a hospital gown."
2.0,"The quality seems fine, but the mask absolutely hangs off of my five-year-old's face. They are not adjustable. They fit me fine."
2.0,Lace is itchy. I’m returning them.
2.0,These don’t look anything like the picture. They are maternity pants and have a full belly-covering panel. They also run really small. They are soft and seem like a decent material at least. I am returning them.
2.0,Well these gloves look great but do not protect your fingers at all! I walk about 5 miles daily our Husky. I gave away a pair of heavy lined gloves  and switched to lite-weight &#34;Thinsulate&#34; ones that are better in 0 degree/ -20 windchill weather. These are not as good protecting fingers from getting cold as either of them. Protection to -30F? Not for me. Returned....
2.0,Other than a swimsuit cover I'm not sure what this can be used for. It does come it a detachable belt that matches the trim. It's cute just not something that could be worn in public :(
2.0,returned too long
2.0,"The second time i wore one pair, the straps on the top of the foot snapped. Bottom grips have started falling off 2 weeks in."
2.0,Easy on but slide down as day goes on
2.0,"Cheap, tacky."
2.0,"These look nice and are comfortable, but they become loose and start to fall off your nose over time.  So their usefulness is limited."
2.0,I don't like it very much...
2.0,"I wanted a few elastic belts, and these are fine for the price. I don't think they will hold up well over time, but I wanted several to keep them with different outfits.<br />Update: elastic wears out quickly."
2.0,"Dress was really cute and comfortable when I put it on, but it seems to be cheaply made.  It looks like they ran out of material or something when making it and just stuck a strip of fabric on the top front of the dress that doesn’t match up with the rest of the pattern on the dress.  It’s very noticeable when I put on the dress.  Very disappointed and will be sending back."
2.0,Seemed okay at first but then realized they are a little blurred on the sides
2.0,Looks good but size is smaller than advertised.
2.0,"It looks nothing like the picture and is made out of a weird, shiny, cheap,spandex material. Don't waste your money."
2.0,Too small around the head. More for a child's head.
2.0,Very comfortable. But the left speaker stopped working after the first few uses. Nothing I do makes it work again. And it feels weird having only one side working. Will likely return it.
2.0,"Not what I was expecting. Poor quality on the stitching and heam lines, one side different than the other. Would not but again."
2.0,Would only work as nightgown or beach cover up
2.0,It’s cute but doesn’t lay on neck very comfortably.
2.0,"Product took SO long to arrive! Too long!<br />Also, I went with the Medium indicated that the size was medium but came with a ""L"" tag...it is too big. More like a true L size😔 disappointing.<br />Maybe there's time to send it back and exchange it and possibly have it arrive by next Halloween."
2.0,I love the style of the dress. However the quality and material are cheap. It reminds you of a nightgown.
2.0,Poor quality  you get what you pay for.
2.0,Uggh not true to size chart
2.0,"Not sure if I got a defective one or if it's just the way they all are, but the Eastern Hemisphere looks like one big blob of silver with very little blue around it.  The Western Hemisphere looks great, but without the other one looking as good, I may have to return these.  The Earth is 70% water, so I would think there should be some more blue on the cufflink representing the Eastern Hemisphere.  Looks defective to me."
2.0,"The underwire is small and the support minimizing wire/plastic tab on the sides poke right through, push-up padding is way to large, seams are rough(pokey) but I like the colors. I would recommend if you are small in size ans just needed a wee bit of a push up."
2.0,Ordered a 8-9 year old and was sent a size 10 which was way too big.
2.0,"The top is far to small for an XLG, pretty thought."
2.0,For the price...no way. This is a $10 - 15 cuff at best.
2.0,The top two leaves looked stuck together.  Very disappointed.
2.0,"Large, uncomfortable, and cheaply made. The fabric is stiff except for a crease by the nose. The mask won't fully bend around the sides of your face so light gets in. The fabric is already fraying and I only used it for one night. The mask its self is fairly large making it very uncomfortable to wear."
2.0,I’m giving it two stars cause of the indigo feature. Timex is a well respected brand in my opinion but to engage the indigo one must push down on the crown. Eventually and in my case the crown stopped engaging the indiglow. No one should have to push a watch crown in to engage a light feature. Poor design. I suggest someone getting a watch that has Lume applied to the indices & hands.
2.0,I really wanted to like this purse.<br /><br />But the way you have to put the phone in make you have flip the phone upside down to be able to use it.<br /><br />That plus the touchscreen area had to many air bubbles. The air bubbles prevent direct touch. So you have to punch a few times or jab at it harder to get it to work. You will probably miss a couple calls. And faster texting will be a challenge. I have a galaxy s9 phone.<br /><br />The purse has great amounts of storage for cards and such. The crossbody strap was functional. It was just to frustrating to use. I gave it away after warning about the frustrations that I encountered. Good luck!
2.0,"This would be a nice bracelet except for 2 things.  First, it is not as pictured.  In the picture it looks green and gold and it is actually green and ORANGE, which will not match with most of my things.  Second, it is a very tight fit.  I have medium hands but I can just barely get this on.  I am fearful of wearing it because if my hands were to swell even a little, I don't think it would come off without a struggle.  Will be returning."
2.0,"Pretty color, looks underwhelming in person (shapeless). Didn't fit well, had trouble getting it past my ample bottom. Doesn't drape like depicted, fabric not forgiving & accentuate flaws"
2.0,"El acabado no es como las fotos, deberían agregar fotos reales"
2.0,The material and color and design is BEAUTIFUL but if you’re a broad shoulder girl like me then I’m sorry hon but it does not look good and fits very tight on the top.
2.0,"Not the best. Is it silk, I dunno. I think we’re to the point in this ridiculousness that we have to find decent masks and this isn’t it."
2.0,"I bought this back pack to reolace my swiss gear that was 6 years old. The good thing about this backpack is that it has lots of storage space. However, the material feels cheap and frail. The zipper is really thin and feels like it could stop working at any given time. The padding to the straps is rather thin which makes it uncomfortable for a heavier load. For a 50 dollar bag, I expected better quality. I am returning the item and sticking with swiss gear."
2.0,The length of this jacket is not as pictured. Sits at the hip. Sleeves are just as bad...fridge is pathetic. Horribly disappointed!! And its NOT CASHMERE<br />! Do not buy!
2.0,"It does not look as nice as the picture . The inside lining is not the same , it's not as nice. And the buttons are not the same , their not as nice and don't appear to be the same quality . If dry cleaning it and military pressing it doesn't help , I'm sending it back."
2.0,Nice but small and returned
2.0,"Looks nice, except for the cheap buckles on the side, but will still work, thanks!"
2.0,the sleeves are wayyyyy too long but the rest of the shirt fits ok. color isn't what I expected. thought I was getting gray but looks green.
2.0,"These hoodies are paper thin.  Great for summertime, but if your looking for a warm hoodie this is far from warm."
2.0,"The American flag gaiter was not as expected. The design is not what is advertised, it says 4 July on it with stripes it doesn’t look like the description."
2.0,They feel insanely cheap for the price I paid for them
2.0,Color is really bright and the material is shiny.
2.0,The bands looked awesome when I first got them but the black one looks horrible now. It's only been a few days since I've put it on. I spend most of my day at a desk on a computer. The black has completely rubbed off onto my desk. Not cool.
2.0,"A lot of the beads are broken. If we took each bracelet apart and made new ones with unbroken beads, we might get 4 new bracelets out of it.<br />It’s very disappointing."
2.0,Two small. Buy two sizes up
2.0,The pendant is tiny and very light weight. I need to replace it with something more substantial. It's toooo small.
2.0,I got the Small size but it was way too large and long.<br />Material was ok but not the best.
2.0,I was super excited for this and it let me down. Looks like it’s just a printed paper of the book under some plastic lol
2.0,The Zipper ripped in the first two hours of traveling with it.
2.0,"So this shirt was cute as hell when I put it on. Loved the fit, the feel, everything... Then after wearing it for less than 2 hours, doing nothing more than driving to a friend's house and to our destination, the elastic in one sleeve had snapped... Luckily, it didn't look awful, but the over all quality was lacking. I hadn't even started moving and actually dancing yet. Bummer."
2.0,The nose ring is too big and it is not bendable so it fits too lose on the nose it falls off.
2.0,Ran too small - too late to return or exchange :(
2.0,Pretty and that's the best I can say.  Way too small to fit a scarf through so I simply will wear as a pretty brooch pin on a sweater.  Disappointed when it comes to being able to use as a scarf ring.  On the bright side it did arrive in very timely manner and was well packaged.
2.0,These were much smaller than advertised. They barely fit.
2.0,"Purchased, seams were puckered, couldn’t fix! Very disappointed! Do not recommend."
2.0,"This is a cute pattern, color and style, but the fabric itself is SO sticky and clingy that it doesn't hang right over jeans, slacks or leggings--sticks to them like GLUE, so it's VERY unflattering and annoying.  Unfortunate.  Had to send it back :("
2.0,"Fit size was smaller than expected, definitely order a size up from what you expect.  Would probably look good from far away, but up close the print was very poor quality (almost pixelly)."
2.0,the pom pom on top ripe off with no force on the second day
2.0,Handsome!  But very short.
2.0,"Couldn't figure out how to return, so reordered.  Hopefully this time will fit. Got second order.  2 sizes up.  Exactly the same size as the first one. (I measured). Still way to small. Very disappointed."
2.0,Way to small. I ordered a large and fit like a small. Price was alright.
2.0,"Very thin cotton material. I like the color, and style, and it is Comfortable to wear as pajamas. Top is not supportive to wear for working out or without wearing a bra underneath."
2.0,"I loved the print, but I washed it twice and the elastic ear loops came out. I would stitch it back, but it should have lasted longer than 2 washes."
2.0,Had to watch less than a week and already missing two stones
2.0,"They are cute and original, i dont like big jewelry so the size is perfect for me but They keep falling off my ears, don't close tight that makes me very sad cause I can't wear them."
2.0,"Overall disappointing and overt priced  in my opinion. Very comfy at first but the fuzzy inside turned scratchy after laundering, and the exterior fabric pills and soils easily.  Another review said it ran small. Huh?  It definitely runs LARGE.  I am a size 8-10, got a large cuz I like my jammies to fit loose not bind under the arms etc.  But I am drowning in this garment. I kept the large but if I had it to do over again, I would not have kept it."
2.0,Ordered these in a Medium because the sizing was correct for me turns out these run big. Needed to order small. Let alone not getting the colors I asked for.
2.0,They’re really cute but definitely not worth the price. Super flimsy. I probably could have made these myself LOL
2.0,"Bought this for an intricate tarnished silver bracelet. I expected to have to scrub it with a toothbrush or something to get the polish into all the crevices, so I wasn't looking for miracles. I was, however, looking for something other than putting the bracelet in for a good soak and bringing it out tarnished. Kind of defeats the purpose of a silver polish, no? Dug out the silver polish I bought earlier and soaked and scrubbed and soaked it with both products, and finally got the bracelet kind of half-way shiny. At least not still tarnished. This stuff did nothing for me but cost me money. Hope other buyers had better luck. The jar just got cloudy and funky-looking and I tossed it out."
2.0,Color coating pealed. Pretty but didn’t last very long. Won’t purchase anything like it again.
2.0,Poor quality and not as pictured. Sending it back.
2.0,"Very cheap quality material and very weird sizing. Broad in the shoulders and tight around the arms. You get what you pay for, I guess."
2.0,Color is way off. I ordered the vest in brown and the model is wearing a dark brown puffer I received a weird off color brown. Had to return.
2.0,Too small. Buyer beware.
2.0,"I ordered this dress in two colors. The one that was supposed to be green is actually brown and I see they changed the description to brown even when I click on my purchase of said 'green' dress. That's not so much a big deal. The dress is cute n comfy, material is soft, runs a bit big because it is flowy. The black one I ordered the stitching was apart at the shoulder seam and also the underarm seam, disappointing. But since I purchased these last minute and packed them in a suitcase as soon as I got them, I didn't notice and didn't feel right returning it once I got home. I just wear it around the house."
2.0,"Cute watch, but the number &#34;6&#34; fell off within the watch face within the first few days.  Now I have a shinny, shimmering &#34;6&#34; floating loose."
2.0,Smiller thank expected i was disappointed
2.0,"LOVE THE LOOK, BUTTTTT, they don't fit any of the temples on my three pair of glasses! Pretty pricey for them not to work! 😎"
2.0,Color is Carolina Blue and not a true Blue as shown in the Picture.
2.0,It’s a very cute dress but the material was very staticky and see-through. I still wore the dress for my graduation but I had a shirt and tights on underneath so people wouldn’t see my underwear.
2.0,My son on swim team and said these were not good at all
2.0,i'm 5'4 and size 16. I ordered the XL and found that it was too high in the crotch....not at all flattering. It was also very weird to put on and take off.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:72768d07c37debc61414e48c5df69234]] It just tangles super easily and I don’t have time to untangle it every time it happens.
2.0,I returned the first one because the battery quit working after 2 uses. The second one is okay but the best heats up and lasts about an hour. I need a few hours of heat each day. When it’s on and working it’s great but too short lived.
2.0,"These gloves claims to be 1-4 years old... my son is 2-1/2 years old and the gloves doesn't fit.  He is a thin average kid and definitely this gloves are too short for the fingers, they stretch and he can put his hand inside, but his fingers are halfway inside the glove fingers"
2.0,Clasp broke after short time.
2.0,To short and didn't get the muster shirt
2.0,This bag is smaller than expected abs the waterproof pocket is tiny.  Great for storing shoes in bigger pocket or dirty gym clothes but you’ll also need a plastic bag to out them in first.  Front zipper pocket ripped within a few weeks.
2.0,"I replaced my non-polarized G15 lenses that were scratched with these lenses. Going with the most expensive polarized option, I thought it was going to be a big improvement in glare reduction. Unfortunately, when compared back-to-back with my non-polarized Persol G15 lenses, the glare reduction is basically non-existent. I had to check if these were indeed polarized and they are. I am just completely unable to see any reduction in glare whatsoever compared to a non-polarized G15 lens so needless to say I am a bit disappointed."
2.0,"Disappointed, wore once to work. Turned my neck green and tarnish from gold to silver within a few hours! Very upset"
2.0,"This delicate necklace was shipped in a bag with surrounding protection. The chain was crushed, leaving the thick, permanent jump ring, that attaches the pendant, markedly bent. The clasp to close the necklace is so damaged that it does not close. The chain is completely unusable."
2.0,"I like that these aren't too massive on my smaller face, but something about them makes my eyes hurt whenever I wear them. I thought perhaps they weren't UV-protected (the advertising says they are) or that they're polarized (the page says they're not), but they just feel a little weird/off. I had my son try them on and he said the same thing--that they cause a little bit of eyestrain like when you put on glasses with the wrong prescription<br /><br />Sooo they're cute enough, but hurt my eyes. Not recommended"
2.0,It's not a slim fit cut as shown in the pic. The trunk of the shirt is straight.
2.0,Not true to size at all. Ordered my size and it's more like a girls size not an adult size. 🙄
2.0,[[VIDEOID:4dddee14d4518d411c7d57552c52ad2d]] ..the one on the left is smaller than the tag size says....the one on the the right is the correct size stated on the tag
2.0,If you want to wear a shapeless see through potato sack this dress is a good option.
2.0,"I thought it was strung on silver wire, but it is not. Fishing line."
2.0,"The material is polyester, itchy and  hot. Also, because of the material, it doesn't lay nicely."
2.0,"This shirt is cute but way too small. I ordered an XXL, but it looks like a small."
2.0,Cool but Sizes are small make sure you order 1-2 sizes bigger than your bra size
2.0,"Served their purpose but I definitely had to stretch them and bend them to fit my kids heads, said they weren’t comfortable how they sat on the nose and their ears. It was a one day use for hundreds day, so they were great with the costume."
2.0,Discoloration of fabric runs very small
2.0,I loved the look of this but it is made very cheap
2.0,"I was looking for a quality leather watch band, this has a hair thin plastic film over the leather, and on the first day the plastic wore off, its Junk, save your money"
2.0,"Did not like the clasp, it was broken, it didn’t fasten correctly."
2.0,Ordered small was way bigger sized
2.0,This is NOT a wristlet - it is more like a makeup bag.  Oversized and can't use.
2.0,It’s so tiny.
2.0,"Yes, be prepared, these jeans have plastic pockets so, get'cha sweat on-- all around your pocket area.  I am sewing mine up for sure!"
2.0,Should have gotten a size larger
2.0,"Beautiful coat. Not as advertised. Not at all waterproof, soaks right through. Also large is way huge. Normally I wear large but this is like XL"
2.0,Now I remember why I don't buy ties online. Way too short and the tie is very skinny. Maybe I am missing the fashion move towards skinny ties. I'm old school and prefer the wider ties...just wish I had know before I bought mine.
2.0,Fabric looks cheap and cut is not flattering
2.0,"Not bad for what I paid, but the underneath fabric was way to short."
2.0,"Purchased this item hoping it would fit, it zipped up and I could wear it, just too expensive for me to not be in love with it, it was also tight on the arms, I returned this item, had to pay $6.10 to return it, and bought a better one at Forever21."
2.0,Used it once and one of the zippers broke
2.0,"The material of this suit is very nice.  The jacket fit my son well, but the pants are definitely not a 32"".  I've tried to get a response from the seller in order to do an exchange, but get no response."
2.0,"I initially like the bangle.  However, I was wearing the bangle and went to the bathroom washed my hands and some water splashed on the bangle and black spots and grayish coloring began to take place.  I would NOT buy this item again and I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND purchasing this item....EVER!!!!"
2.0,"It looks beautiful and works well with the first charm, but I used it once and when I changed the first charm out, the snap that allows your to change out came completely off the rest of the jewelry. It seems to have just been glued in, and not very well glued at that. Very disappointing because I was quite excited about this piece. I am a manager at a nice restaurant and we have to have cards to open our sale system. I needed something that would go nicely with my dressier outfits but gave me ease of access to my card."
2.0,"It is a bit deceiving. I thought the rhinestones would be on the entire tower, but they are only on one side. The chain for the keychain is cheap and it actually broke right away and needed to be fixed. I bought it as a gift and so that only added to my disappointment. I will not purchase another one, that's for sure. :("
2.0,I ordered a 2xl in this and it was tiny. I gave it to my daughter who is a 5'10 and a size 9 and it was even too small for her. I can't even imagine what a size large would look like.
2.0,Seems cheaply made and does not fit like pic
2.0,At first glance they are cute and comfy. After 2 days of wearing them all the tread on the bottom started coming off all over my floor. It’s just annoying because they were so cute. I would only recommend this if you don’t mind the tread coming off.
2.0,El pantalón de muy mala calidad
2.0,Look nice but not the right shape for radar lock glasses
2.0,"I wear a large, but this was REALLY small! Had to give it away on the 4th to my sister in law"
2.0,Dress came clearly used. Had makeup all over the neckline and glitter all over it. I didn’t want to try it but it was a cute dress
2.0,Dislike.  It was very heavy. Not sized in shoulders nor good very well
2.0,I just returned it today. The Greek letters were wrong.
2.0,I am 6'0 and a solid 197 lbs. I like the tank but had to give it to my 180 lb. son who wears a men's medium. This tank is made is sized for smaller men. I wish the had XXL.
2.0,"We ordered these reusable bags to package meals for families at our school. We didn't load them overly full, and they weren't very heavy at all. 3/5 bags instantly broke with any sort of weight in them. Super disappointed in the quality."
2.0,Wish to have medium size and longer
2.0,"The material is soft and the length is great. My issue is with where the pockets fall. It his right at the hips and ends up making them look wider. The material is on the thinner side, so the pockets bunch a little and it is not flattering. Returning."
2.0,"Shabby construction, cheap material.. They were cheap, but free is too much for junk"
2.0,Too small and really tough to put on child's food.
2.0,Arrived in bout 5 days. Scarf on pic is much prettier color is much deeper. I really wanted this Christmas scarf for the up coming holiday of 2016. I will still wear but it won't have the pop I was expecting.
2.0,Se me callo y se abrió todo y se me daño la pantalla
2.0,I ordered a small. Quality is decent but it is at least a foot longer than small would normally be. I would say a small in this belt would fit a person with a 40-in waist.
2.0,Fit my busy but was too long length wise and too loose everywhere else
2.0,ok shirt but it took over a month to deliever kidda cheap looking
2.0,I like how long it is and the waist but the material is terrible.  It feels like velvet on the outside and papery on the inside. I dont even want to try working out in it. Just not for me.
2.0,These were loose did not fit tightly. I was not able to use them.
2.0,Ordered a 3x based on other reviews. Im normally a 1x...these pants run extra small. Extremely tight!!!
2.0,Very silky but also very thin and slightly transparent when squating
2.0,My wife found this sweatshirt to be an uncomfortable fit.  The shoulders came down 3 inches from her shoulder and the sleeves were too long.  The body of the sweatshirt fit her because it was smaller than the rest of the sweatshirt.  She has decided not to wear it.  I tried it on and it was an uncomfortable fit.
2.0,The material is not soft at all.  In fact it feels like an acrylic poly blend and not cotton.  I am very disappointed!
2.0,Was a misshapen day mess without the chin strap advertised
2.0,Even when used properly the hinges will breaks
2.0,Socks where advertised as althletid to means chignon calf of leg. Is more like crew sock.Nt enough elastic in sock
2.0,"IT SHEDS SO MUCH!!! As I took it out of the package the thing shed and got tangled so fast. Also I've done everything I can to make it nice but it's so hard because there IS SO LITTLE HAIR!!<br />The netting shows through and you have to part it very carefully so it doesn't show through but that's almost impossible to do!! If it had a little more hair I wouldn't mind it's a nice wig but you wouldn't want your weft showing through when you Cosplay!<br />Really disappointing maybe I just got a bad one. I would have given it one star but the wig hair and style is nice. If it had a bit more thickness so the netting didn't show through it might be a tolerable wig.<br /><br />I've had friends who've bought $5 wigs that are far better quality than this so the price isn't much of an excuse.<br /><br />Lastly, when I was washing it out black chunks came out of it?? I tried not think about what that could be too much......."
2.0,"I’ve been buying more adidas products recently and have been overall happy. This hat isn’t it though, odd fit and not stylish."
2.0,"I think this dress is adorable. And the quality was good. But the material stretches not at all, so unless I have zero intentions of ever lifting my arms, I couldn’t ever wear it. And I’m not so sure a larger size would have changed that fact. Unfortunately, I had to return this one."
2.0,"I ordered a medium based on the measurements in their description and could not get them on. I will be returning them and ordering an XL, as I like the look and feel and anticipate that they will be very comfortable."
2.0,Bag is leather and matches the dimensions listed but the buckles for instance seem be on upside down.  Why would you thread a strap down through a buckle but have its loop and pin pointed up meaning they will fall down and stick out from the bag?<br /><br />It's a light weight leather and not terrible stitching but the value was not good.  This is not a cheap bag but the design is flawed.  It will get used but these bits sticking out will snag on things and end up bent.
2.0,"Arrived and was very simple and a great accessory for any outfit. However, I'm upset that I purchased this for a gift and then it broke after wearing it for three days. Not the best quality, wouldn't really recommend."
2.0,didn't like the shirt at all
2.0,"So bummed this didn’t fit me appropriately! One wrong move and BAM my whole butt would be out.. if you’re a taller gal this isn’t for you. I ordered the largest size hoping for more luck in the length department but no such luck, however the quality and material is great AND such a cute dress!"
2.0,Nice jacket. Zipper broke in less than a week. :-(
2.0,It’s ok. Quality is on the cheap side for what they charge.
2.0,"The picture made the necklace look beautiful. In reality, it was very bulky."
2.0,"The jacket is warm and cute, but I've been wearing the jacket for about two weeks now and the sleeves are already pilling and the fabric looks frayed and old. I haven't worn it doing anything other than walking, so I'm disappointed that the jacket isn't holding up."
2.0,"Shows a vintage rose gold color in picture. It’s not, it’s the generic rose gold you probably already have 30 of!!!"
2.0,When these pants came in I was so upset because they were too small!!
2.0,Small problem with these undies....no fly!! Men don't like to drop their drawers at the urinal. Husband thought them to be very comfortable until he went to the bathroom and found the problem. Need to fix this guys
2.0,I ordered a large and it is about a size 0
2.0,"I bought these based on the great reviews. No one mentioned the very strong chemical smell or the fact that they came in a plastic bag instead of a shoe box. They fit okay, I'm size 9.5. The tongue of the shoe is irritating on the inside. You can clearly see the sewn edges on the top of the tongue and then about halfway down,  it is jagged and not neatly sewn. That is what irritated and scratched my leg. I guess don't wear ankle socks.... I don't think they would be very comfortable to wear all day, maybe just a few hours. I sent them back regardless. Total disappointment."
2.0,The dress is completely see through and you can’t wear much under to fix cause it’s tight
2.0,"The band only has the print on one side(the top) and white on the inside but you can see the white from the sides, which makes it look really cheap quality."
2.0,"Not a good quality product, stitches weren't straight, the strap was thinner than original.  It fit but wouldn’t buy it again"
2.0,"Ths skirt itself is cute, but the pink color was NOT as pictured and the design of the stars is like another one of the options that I didn’t pick!! I’m so disappointed that this is going to be my daughter’s first birthday outfit because there aren’t many skirts out there like this."
2.0,"I like to wash all my new packages/shopping spree items and unfortunately both pairs of these pants I got came out with holes at the top by the waist which weren’t there when I got them. Sewed it but then noticed string pieces coming off, avoid removing because it just creates more holes. Sad cause they were super cute."
2.0,I ended up sending my item back.  The straps in the back that criss crossed made it really hard to get on and the material was just thin and felt like it wouldn't of lasted very long.
2.0,"only washed this shirt 2 inside out and the decal is coming up in a few areas, if that wouldn't of happened i would of gave it a 5 star"
2.0,"I was very disappointed in this product. First off it didn't come with the paw print, the keyring and chain set up wasn't like the picture. It was a cheaper version and I had to put the cat on the chain. The Chi figure wasn't put together very well either. It looks like they didn't bother to line the front and back up before gluing it together so it has overlap on one side. Not to mention they didn't bother to trim the excess plastic. This product isn't worth the money I paid for it. It looks very cheap."
2.0,"I knew as a big girl not to go into this with too high of hopes but I was thinking if these shorts weren’t the most flattering then I could just wear them under an oversized shirt. Well. I liked the stretchiness of the under layer and waistband which made it possible to be worn, but the cut and material of the shorts is just so awkward and unflattering and thin enough that you can see every panty line."
2.0,These are very awkward. I'm a size 4/6 with a small waist and have somewhat of a booty. These were too tight all over and the elastic cut into my hips and rear. I imagined the V-fit would be flattering but unfortunately it was not! Surprisingly better quality material and stitching than I thought it would be but the fit just did not work for me.
2.0,"The shipping time was extremely long, the dress smelled of chemicals, the fit is very small around the waist &amp; full in the breast cups, the color is not exactly the color in the picture, which is very disappointing because I bought this for my daughter to wear in my wedding now I’m going to have to either try to dye it the right color, suck it up and deal with it or find something else 😡 the only positive is that the dress design is very pretty."
2.0,These have absolutley no stretch to them at all. Runs small
2.0,"I wanted to keep these boots--the style is perfect--but the quality just wasn't near the $120 price tag.<br /><br />The box these boots come in has graphics matching the boot, which is a nice touch. Upon inspecting the boots, I was relieved the material does seem like leather, unlike the claims of another product reviewer here saying they were, ""man made material."" If the leather is some type of synthetic leather, it's indistinguishable from the real thing--at least in looks, if not durability.<br /><br />The design on the front of the ankle is not printed on, but engraved into the leather, which is a bonus. However, the leather under the engraving looks slightly porous, so that might be what the other reviewer is referencing.<br /><br />The studs throughout the boot looks sturdy enough. If even one fell out, though, it would significantly detect from the overall look.<br /><br />The buckle is purely aesthetic, non functional, although it's the only element of these boots that looks better in person--everything else looks and feels like a lesser version of the great pictures here on Amazon.<br /><br />The zipper is a little small and frail feeling, and the left boot zipper kept getting caught. I had to wiggle it a lot to get it to become unstuck.. I imagine this issue would become worse.<br /><br />The size feels true lengthwise, but I usually wear wide, so these felt slightly narrow.<br /><br />The sole has a complete lack of traction on rough tile, although it was acceptable on hardwood floor, oddly enough. It was difficult walking to get a feel for the fit and comfort as these boots kept sliding around like sneakers on an ice rink. I'm not sure if this would improve as the sole gets scuffed, but winter is coming, so I wasn't  too thrilled about finding out. The smooth, hard texture suggests the slip problem would continue.<br /><br />The straps that run in front of the ankle, attached to the buckle, were the deal-breaker. The left boot was perfect--snug, not tight, and served it's aesthetic purpose. The right boot strap, however, was sewed in a quarter inch too long, so the strap sags and is loose. If you tighten the strap by moving the buckle one hole, the strap becomes too tight, not to mention asymmetrical.<br /><br />The style of this boot is fantastic. I would gladly pay more for a higher quality product, but with the craftsmanship of these boots varying so much between the pair, I just couldn't justify keeping them, regardless of how much I love the style (minus the sagging strap). Quality control does not existent for these boots--just a quick glance would tell you the two don't match. Due to this, I didn't have confidence the durability would last more than a couple weeks before it noticeably fell apart. This might be acceptable at $20-$30 (if it weren't for that sagging strap!) but the quality is not $140.<br /><br />In the end, I returned these boots. Be careful, because you might get mine!<br /><br />Summary: I wanted to keep these boots--the style is perfect--but the quality just wasn't near the $120 price tag."
2.0,Disappointed. Hoped for a better fit. Not flattering on my petite frame. Returned.
2.0,the front is very stiff hope it softens with washing
2.0,"Too small and not center-posted, making them look less attractive when worn than they should."
2.0,"better than the other hat I ordered at the same time, but not by much. bummer."
2.0,Save your money this is junk and gaudy
2.0,"Super cheap made, look very cheap too. I bought them as stocking stuffers. Wouldn't buy again."
2.0,It was VERY see through despite a “liner”. I did not know this until I wore it to my engagement photo shoot. Needs a more substantial liner to prevent fashion faux-pas
2.0,"I'm a size 9 and these fit true to size, but the top part of the boot just isn't cut wide enough to warrant keeping them. I do not have large legs by any means, but these squeezed my calves and the buckle on the side is purely cosmetic so it wasn't any help.<br /><br />Side note, the pink color is gorgeous in person- very bright and exactly what I hoped for."
2.0,Not sure If it is me or the sock but the fit was not comfortable. They also wore out quickly or got out of shape is probably a better description. Just threw out the last pair yesterday and I have only had them less then 6 months.
2.0,"The case came not closed properly as if it has an overbite. After fixing it, that side is still not flush in the back. The inner liner was also coming off the top part of the case. I pushed it back into place, but I'm not expecting that to last long at all. The pattern is cute at least?"
2.0,one use only
2.0,"The size, although marked XXL, was more of a L/Xl."
2.0,"Nice, heavy and very short.  Best described as ankle socks and not what I would consider to be for winter.  I returned them."
2.0,The cup area is very small even on a large. Would not recommend
2.0,I really wanted to like this but it was way too small. They should have half sizes. I wear a 9 in everything else so this is disappointing
2.0,The fit feels comfortable however the bottom portion (closest to the knee) is completely loose. They have a worn out look and feel. I'm somewhat disappointed with the purchase.
2.0,"Not what I expected, the lenses were not as blue as pictured.....fit was goid, but sending back"
2.0,"I was so looking forward to loving this product. Yet, it really disappointed me. I took it out today for the first time and the “reinforced fiberglass ribs” did not hold up in very mild wind and very minimal rain. I plan on returning."
2.0,"See through , cheaply made , belt is just hanging there nothing to hold it place and very short anyway. I had to make a bow with it and attach it to the front of the pants with pins."
2.0,"Very cheap, flimsy material."
2.0,"Its blank green, its not camo color... its ugly...."
2.0,"I like the feel of fabric , the color, length is good & the size small fits perfectly in the waist but it looks like they are just so big on me in the butt and legs!<br />So wide that they look terrible. I was looking for something loose but these go way beyond. Will return."
2.0,"Not super thrilled with these. You definitely get what you pay for with these. The colors were good, but the metal was cheap, used once and the attachments are breaking"
2.0,"seem to be cheaper quality, I can see through it when I hold up to light.  The filters are just torn in the package, doesn't seem very sanitary compared to some others that I've ordered this year."
2.0,I bought 2 sets of these dresses for easy dressing after giving birth to my first baby. I ordered a 2x due to my bust size and I was very disappointed when I received the dresses. The bust fits more like medium and larger everywhere else. I decided to return the dresses and still waiting on my refund...it’s been a month.
2.0,"Really cool sunglasses, but scratched super easly. Broke after a week"
2.0,Super thin. I returned it.
2.0,"No place to put coins, everything falls out all the time, and the strap broke within a week."
2.0,"I gave them a 2 star because their size does not consider large boned individuals. I don't like the feeling that a band barely fits my wrist.<br /><br />I upgraded from a Fitbit charge 3 to a Fitbit Versa which came with two different sizes (Small & Large). The Large fitbit band fit my wrist perfectly (buckle side measures 3-3/4 inches and the notched side measures 5-1/4 inches.) (Note: I am a large boned female with a wrist size of 7-1/2 inches.) Unfortunately, I cannot wear Fitbit bands that are made from elastomer, because it does NOT allow my wrist to breath and gets worse when exercising. Over a few weeks their elastomer band caused a very ugly large (3 inch) burn like mark on my wrist. I was worried it would scar, but it didn't. They claim the elastomer material does not contain latex, but I am not aware of any latex allergies. It took a while to heal.<br /><br />I tried buying a leather band from another amazon seller, however it was way too small! It appears that most third party bands advertised on amazon run small and do not consider larger boned females.<br /><br />WFEAGL posted that their leather bands fits wrist size:fits 5.3""-7.8"". It barely fits (see the picture showing it is on the second to last hole on the band). This cannot be a large male band, because this would not fit my father's or brothers' wrist that are much larger than mine!!<br /><br />As you see in the photos that I have provided, WFEAGL makes their bands smaller than Fitbit's large band by a 1/4 -inch on each side. Are there any amazon third party leather bands that match fitbit's large sized bands? This band will do for now, but I will continue to look for a large band that is sized like Fitbit's large."
2.0,"I got these for the &#34;normal&#34; sized holes in my ears.  The ones you get done at places like Claire's. Anyway, these are too big to fit in them."
2.0,My ears we’re actually too small for these. Definitely need glue
2.0,No so great
2.0,"Yes, the price is great, and they look good.  But the build is flimsy, and the fit is a bit loose- they don't feel secure on your head.  Also, they are VERY dark in terms of the amount of light they let through, which could be taken as a positive or negative."
2.0,This short is as cute as it looks but it’s super long. It’s more of a tshirt dress.
2.0,"Really liked this boot but size 6 was too large for me. I re-ordered them in size 5 and was sent the same exact shoe size so now I am returning both. I don't see why size 5 was offered is ""size 36"" is the lowest that is offered. The two pairs of shoes also came in completely different boxes which is questionable."
2.0,"I was one of the unlucky ones who got a short dress. I’m 5’5” and about 130 lbs, and the hem falls about 8” off of the floor when I’m barefoot. I ordered it because I loved how the dress appears to sweep the floor. It’s still cute, just not as romantic looking as I had hoped. I got it for $17 though and saw enough reviews reporting this issue that I knew it might be a possibility. I suppose I’ll keep it, but still only giving 2 stars because it isn’t what I was hoping for, and isn’t what the seller is actually advertising."
2.0,"I got a bigger size so that it would be oversized, but it’s not. Also this is kind of itchy. But it looks super cute."
2.0,Ordered the correct size and they were very tight.
2.0,The gloves are really thin and rip very easily with any amount of friction or stretching. Would not buy again.
2.0,Very comfortable if they had not been so small...
2.0,"Did it work? yes but, after a week it broke. I guess that is what I should have expected and I was able to return it pretty easily. I was looking for a cool watch at the time that did not rely on a phone, but this was not that great. Everything about the device is cheap, the band, the screen (resistive touch btw.), the dac. I guess the only good thing I would have to say about this watch is the initial quality was surprising and then broke after a week."
2.0,"So, for the price, these are great, but the lenses are not optically correct, so if you’re used to Oakley “I can look out of the corner of the lense and see clearly” these distort. It’s distracting to the point that I’m unlikely to wear them and am considering buying genuine replacements.<br /><br />Now, if you are just looking for some cheap lenses to make your frog skins functional again, for the price you can’t beat it."
2.0,"Worked OK, but not worth the money. Buying Rx googles."
2.0,"Zipper itself very sharp and expected operation too difficult. Catched on itself, not reasonably smooth"
2.0,"I bought this recently because it was cheap and looked simple and cute enough for the money. That said, I wouldn't wear this dress in public on its own, even as dressed up and accessorized as possible. The bust was tight, and I don't have a lot going on up there, and the rest of the fit just kinda hangs there. It is longer than expected and isn't flattering. I tried it on and didn't feel like changing to go pickup dinner, so a denim jacket over top looked ok enough, but otherwise I don't think I'd wear this alone. I'm still debating returning it since the fabric isn't quite comfortable enough to sleep in."
2.0,The slit for the knot comes up too high. Thought it’d be more at waistline.
2.0,"The dress is super cute. After reading the reviews on size I though getting the biggest size will give me a little play, dress was a little more snug than I’d like. & there’s NO belt. Dress has belt loops with NO belt. The bottom of the dress is more see thru than I’d like. You have to wear a slip"
2.0,"The reason is the hoops don't stay closed..they keep opening up..sad..because the set is very pretty, but not worth it..I bought because of the hoops and can't wear them."
2.0,I thought the socks would be thicker because of them being labeled boot socks. They feel more like knee highs.
2.0,"The material is of no good quality because after the first wash, it cant be worn on the road again just in the home."
2.0,My son loves star wars and this is a toy he's been wanting. There are not too many version of this. The quality is really poor.
2.0,Got suckered into Lightning deal. I thought the frame was partially metal. It is fully plastic. The Aviators are large-type sunglasses as expected and will make thinner faces look wider. I will keep it and re-gift it to someone less fortunate. Packaging is very nice though and makes it seem like the glasses are high-end but unfortunately they feel very cheap. Make sure you pay less than twenty bucks.
2.0,Received product yesterday after almost a month.<br />The lining have loose and bad stitching including incorporation of foreign fabric in one area and opened seam in another.<br />Logo has spelling that is either meant as a joke or they don't know English spelling.<br />Don't waste your money.<br />See photos.
2.0,The size. They are to small for large or heavy brooches. I liked the grey ones much better and and bigger. But if that’s all you got it’s what we have to use
2.0,"It is sooo long , unless you are 5&#34;7 or taller I'll fit you well. Not for short people"
2.0,"This is a really cute dress - but if you are large busted don't buy it.  It would be nice for someone petite and small chested.  Also, if you are tall this dress won't look good on you because of the waist area (made for petites)."
2.0,"Too tight. Would have returned it, till I found out it's from England and would cost $34!!! Never would have bought it if I knew that."
2.0,"Very pretty, came with a bent part, tried to straighten a little---broke immediately. Super cheap metal. Never got to wear. Too bad, very nice to look at."
2.0,It was small for my upper helix and I had to use pliers to open
2.0,The sizing is crazy. I ordered a large and it fit like a small.
2.0,It saya it's L size but in the small tag inside it says extra small!!! And it didn't fit at all!! So bad!! It's such a nice top!!
2.0,Very delicate. It broke while I was putting it on.
2.0,"This thing fits a fat neck like a choker, and I'm pretty sure I got the largest size on Vine.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor if you live in a big body: measure your neck and spend your money on a piece that will look great on you. Cause this isn't it."
2.0,You get what you pay for. It broke. I was able to fix the clasp though. Better for a young teen.
2.0,This shirt is short and boxy and very large. I'm 5'2'' and it was short and boxy on me.
2.0,"Same day I got it, the zipper up top broke."
2.0,Faded after &lt;10 washes
2.0,"Looks nice and different than the norm, but not very sturdy. Heavy too. Had to return it"
2.0,These aren’t as cropped as I would like and they also dig up my armpits. Was hoping I could wear these to work out in but I can’t get past the discomfort of them digging up my armpits
2.0,Its not even navy. Its a royal blue. I was going to wear this to a Marine Ball with my husband to try and match his dress blues.
2.0,"The face fits very loosely.  Also, the strap is designed so that is is backwards for someone to wear the watch on their left arm.  Not happy with the purchase."
2.0,"Not a real nice T-shirt material, kinda scratchy, not nice and soft as the black one! True to size, nice color pink"
2.0,Print not that great. Hat came in a bag basically smashed. Like the hat thought it was a down hat. Little disappointed.
2.0,"I real like these boots as they are comfortable and I like the look.  I have bought 3 or 4 pairs so far. However, this last pair that I bought now squeaks on the left foot every step I take.  I buy these boots for work, so I keep them clean, but really disappointed with this pair. When I'm in the office, everyone knows I'm coming due to the squeaking on every step.<br /><br />I wish I could exchange them."
2.0,"I love these type of bracelet, but this one was not very well made. The crystals were not lined up well and the cuts were not very straight."
2.0,"Fun but makes for a terrible,  effective mask. Have to wear additional mask beneath it. Had trouble keeping it on my face but am petite"
2.0,Ordered a medium. It was too small and snug. It was not what I expected. The pictures are deceiving.
2.0,The top fit me (34B) but the bottom/skirt is too short. I'm 5' 3'' and it was about 2'' above my ankles. I usually wear a 2/small and I ordered a small. I returned the dress bc it was too short for my liking.
2.0,Wear down in a week. Fuzzies all over house
2.0,The first time I wore it it stuck pretty nice didn’t have a problem with it falling . The second time I put it on it just came off right away I was definitely disappointed that I only got to wear it once.
2.0,"My mom always told me you get what you pay for...I will concede that the dress was probably good value for the money spent.  However, we received the dress and prior to even slipping it on we noticed that the zipper was broke/split and there were white deodorant stains on the bodice so clearly someone else didn't want it! I ordered a size 8 for my 17y/o daughter who normally wears a 6/7.  Had the zipper actually worked it would have been a slightly snug fit. The bodice of the dress was nicely made but the skirt does not appear to be as full as the stock photo and the ombre gradient was not as nice IMO. If you bought this for the similarity to the Elie Saab dress worn by Lily Collins, you are getting a decent knock off, but it certainly doesn't convey the ethereal feel of the original.  All in all, it was a nice enough dress for the money. Too bad the one we received arrived in such damaged condition. Daughter said she would have kept it if the zipper had not been broken.  She had purchased it as a possible Prom dress, I would say it wasn't &#34;nice&#34; enough for Prom but certainly would have been fine for a Homecoming if the kids in your area wear long dresses."
2.0,"We placed this order and did not receive the skirt as stated in the description.  The sizing is off by a size or two. We ordered a child large and it was snug.  Looked like a small/medium.  To find the right size, we would have need to order a XL."
2.0,Not for you if your skinny and if your boobs are big. It is really loose.
2.0,These were very tight on my face pretty colors and everything but I could never wear them I returned it
2.0,"It is a beautiful band. However, I will be returning it.<br />It is unlike any band I have ever seen.  It requires a screwdriver to adjust it! Plus it cannot be done while you are wearing it.  Not what I want to deal with!"
2.0,Definitely was cute just didn’t fit as expected
2.0,"Very nice design but wow, it is just not meant to be put on. It has taken at least an hour out of my day for me to try to clasp this thing. It is incredibly frustrating. Not sure if mine is just defective or what. Considering returning it."
2.0,its super cute but it is cheap cheap cheap. don't waste your time cuz all you'll do is return it.
2.0,If you thought you couldn't see before... Try these on. The progressive lenses seemed so convoluted it was like you were looking through a kaleidoscope.
2.0,"I purchased the maroon one with flowers. The colors and pattern were beautiful and it fit through the back and arms but the fabric did not even begin to come around and cover my chest in the front. I purchased an extra large, which is what I usually wear. Had to return it."
2.0,the front is way shorter than the back and it looks sort of silly in my opinion
2.0,"Comfortable fabric and solid construction, but I am still getting sweat in my eyes during hot yoga, which doesn't happen with my Halo 2. Would be much better if used in an environment where there is some evaporation, and for an activity without inversions."
2.0,Suit is extremely... Short? I don't have a long torso by any means yet the body of this suit was extremely short and ill fitting.
2.0,The image made it bigger and the measurements were off.
2.0,"Very nice looking glasses with a nice fit but they scratch way too easy!  This is my 2nd pair in less than 6wks and both pairs are full of scratches and peels.  Once some guacamole smeared on the lense and dried a little and when I wiped it, the polarizes coloring came off.  These are cute and function for a week at best."
2.0,Unreliable<br />Doesn't always show cards in away that makes them easily accessible<br />And also comes apart occasionally
2.0,"Comfortable to wear, but after only one wearing, it pills (fuzzes) up like a cheap a sweater."
2.0,"The XL is in no way cut true to size. Also, very thin and sheer. Picture does not give fair estimate."
2.0,"i was really dissappointed in this , basically it was a scarg with 2 arm holes in it poor quality and if i had given a lot for it i would have sent it back. i received this as a discount to try out"
2.0,Originally I would have given this a 4 but it is getting a 2 because my reviews keep getting denied.<br /><br />It received a 4 because the top is too small and the bottom is too big. I receive lots of compliments on this but I was constantly worried about my top moving around. I don't recommend if you are busty. To give you an idea I'm 5&#34;3 and 125. A small bottom and large top would've probably fit me perfectly.
2.0,I ordered both the pink and black version of this. The material was very thin and see through. It was too small. Looks very cheap.
2.0,Did not like this cotton T shirt like material. Very flimsy
2.0,Felt cheaply made.  Really had to force the zipper to get it up and down.  Didn't love the design of the tope in person.
2.0,Looks great but scratches easily like many titanium rings. I returned it.
2.0,Didn't fit as I would like.
2.0,The dress fit perfectly . The colors were not as pictured and looked faded and not bright like in the picture. So I was very disappointed by that. It would of been a great dress if it looked like pictured.
2.0,Got someone 3x smaller than me.  Certainly not the size advertised!!!
2.0,"the picture looks better than product, this necklace doesn't show very well in real life, it isn't very well made, the way it goes on it takes a lot of adjusting to get the Avant guard look like the picture, I will say its okay, but it looks cheap to me.<br />the proximity of the stand up part of the necklace is awkward, and you really have to keep arranging. if you don't mind that, go for it, but like me I want to put on and go."
2.0,"The feathers on this are really pointy. Wasn't soft like a boa should be  ,colors are right on. Really sad"
2.0,"I am writing a new review of the above nose studs. They are really pretty and dainty. They last about 2 weeks before you have to change them for a new one. It is a good thing the box brings 20 of them so it is worth the money. I had mine on for 2 weeks and it never moved or fell out. But, I did have to change it to another one from the pack because the stem had tarnished. It is not real sterling silver as the seller states. But, they are worth the money. You get 20 of them. In 2-3 months you buy another pack. That is the way I look at it. The only downfall is that I do not like is when a seller lies in the description."
2.0,It is what it is. I guess I got what I paid for. The pink with the yellow gold looks almost like a gumball ring.
2.0,"Super thin material, basically see through, flimsy. Runs on the small side and a large wouldn fit at all. Would not recommend."
2.0,Not as I espected sleves are big I thougt and not as slim as it is on the picture
2.0,Cute shoes however they run large and do not stay velcrowed very well
2.0,Looks ridiculous on me.
2.0,Material feels very cheap.
2.0,In the first week the clasp broke twice.
2.0,"I ordered these for my very petite 8 year old and they were far too small. I got the 4-8 year old ones because she is shorter for her age and very thin but they don't even come up to her knee. I should have gotten the larger ones, so I would size up."
2.0,"I ordered these after seeing numerous advertisements through Facebook. I was excited about the idea of comort, with added support. First, this brqnd recommended ordering a size up, due to the fit. My bras feel loose, and I get NO added support from the cross straps. Yes, the material is soft, but between the ill fit and soft, super flexible material, I get the same support as I get from a dollar store, spaghetti strapped brallet. Would not purchase again."
2.0,"The earring inlay did not look like those pictured at all. Mine was a solid brown, with little shine to it. The metal is okay although I can't personally tell the quality of it. Box was expected, earrings quite different.<br />Overall disappointed and I'm unsure if they'll ever be worn more than once.<br />Edit: They look almost wooden / coral, and I have come to enjoy them, however they are still not at all like the picture."
2.0,I'm sorry but I don't agree with the previous reviewers.  I've had my Stephanie for over a year.  It is wearing on the both ends of the opening and around the metal rings.  I take very good care of it and don't use it all the time.  I'm very disappointed in it.
2.0,"I ordered a medium, as that it what I usually wear according to the measurements. The top was definitely too small. Would fit someone who wears size small, maybe. Bottoms fit ok. Not too too small. Very disappointed because I loved the look of this suit. Totally cute :-(  I returned it.  Disclosure:  I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest review."
2.0,I washed these pajamas before giving them to my daughter. After just one wash they were extremely faded and discolored. I washed them in cold water and dried them on low heat. Disappointed in the quality of these.
2.0,My child is under the 10 percentile for her age so i ordered bigger for next year since theres only about 3 months left of this year  wears a 4 now so i ordered a 5/6 so they would more so fit for next year -awww not the case they will fit for the next 3 months  and tbats it -definetly run small
2.0,Wayyy too small...
2.0,"I love the color and feel. Problem with this is that the snap button does not stay together when full of cards and cash. Also my galaxy s 7 edge is too big for the phone, card, misc. Holding area. Would love this if if was fully functional and fit my phone. I will have to deal I guess. Very sad :("
2.0,Just didn’t fit the way I expected it to  It seemed to be just a bunch of material cut poorly that most definitely didn’t accentuate my curves like in the picture. Oh well live and learn and get a refund
2.0,"Too small for adult head, too big for a hair bun."
2.0,Size was good. Stitches are good. One sleeve had sparkles and one did not. There were only 7 purple “tentacles” and left a big gap in the back. Seller did address those issues satisfactorily.
2.0,"The shirt is nice, but definitely doesn’t fit to U.S. size. Unfortunately I just tried it on and it’s too late to return or exchange sizes. Too small, even after ordering up a size."
2.0,"Every time I wear these shoes I develop extreme pain in ball of my right foot. I can be working on my office at my desk job and it hurt so bad I can hardly walk. This do ant happen wearing Sketchers. Also, the right has a broken seem. I these shoes May."
2.0,I thought these were for kids but...they are way too big for a child to wear. I need &#34;Small&#34; earrings for little lobes.
2.0,Too small and my hair isn't even thick.
2.0,Doesn't stay in place. Doesn't cover the length of ear as pictured. Very unhappy with this but would cost more to send back.
2.0,It was a lovely ring. I say was bc it's not very forgiving. I only got a couple of wears out of it before it snapped in half.
2.0,The fit is okay (a little short in the crotch) and not happy with the material they are made of.
2.0,This was a cute bracelet.  It felt heavy but broke within two days.  The heart just fell off.
2.0,"While it's not a bad belt, I've bought better-quality belts with softer leather for less money. For $65, I'd rather they put the money into providing a more supple leather rather than a fancy box and branded tissue paper. Unfortunately, I missed the 30-day window to be able to return it, and am now stuck with it. Be aware that the width may also be slightly wider than what you might currently wear, as it is an eighth inch wider than what I'm used to."
2.0,Too large in the toe area
2.0,Very uncomfortable good thing they are cheap.
2.0,"Began to fall apart after 2nd use. I bought these for my son to wear in the pool and water park play twice a week during summer camps. The sole was loose in one of them after the first use, and it fell out completely after the second use. I gave it 2 stars because of the cute design, and it was easy for my son to put on by himself. However, I regret purchasing this."
2.0,"The style is very cute, however, the zipper was extremely har to zip and unzip. Also, shoes run small. My little daughter loves them but when she wore them she didn’t want them anymore. It was very hard for her to unzip and zip."
2.0,"The color is a very muddy olive green, which I do not like. It looks much muddier and darker in person. The fit runs small, I would say a small is a size 4 in most other brands. The sleeves are short and I don't think my arms are longer than average. It hits me just above my hips and is a snug fit when zipped. I am 5'6 and a size 6 in most brands."
2.0,"I was really excited about this shirt, but it was totally different fabric than expected. It was cheap, stiff fabric and it wouldn't fit off my shoulders. The sizing is big and it felt like I was wearing a parasuit."
2.0,"I loved this to begin with, but after one wash, the stitching is coming undone.  It looks nice, but it is just poor quality."
2.0,I bought a bigger size than usual and it is made small !!!! I wear a large. And I bought XL. Still too small
2.0,I loved the shirt until I raised my arms slightly. It’s not long enough to cover my belly.
2.0,"Etched letter &#34;P&#34; and &#34;TL&#34; are on the top corners on the inside of the lens, very strange."
2.0,"What i received is not what the pictures display. The lanyard is a cheap cloth, bot the same faux leather strap, the card holder is cheap and only has 1 card holder on the back and not 2 pockets like displayed.<br />A little disappointing,  but overall better than the cheap plastic covers work gives you."
2.0,Please be careful when you walk or knock against something. The prongs are loose and the gems pop out! I have lost 4 already and am upset about it because they are odd shapes that can’t be found just anywhere. The rest are very sturdy. Take the gems out and glue them to keep them.
2.0,Didn't fit in the breast area!
2.0,"The sizing on this item is correct and it fits as I expected based of sellers sizing. I wear an 8/10, 5’6”, 160lbs, and have a small waist and thicker thighs. The pants were a little tight in the stomach area and pulled on the pleats of the  silhouette.<br /><br />My main issue is the length and the reason I’m returning it. These ended at about a 7/8 length. The model in the picture must be shorter than me, cause I was expecting to be able to wear heels. I wouldn’t even wear these pants with flats. The material wasn’t great either, kind of like crate paper."
2.0,It broke on the first day just from normal wear. HOWEVER the piece itself is beautiful and I  did love it
2.0,The skirt portion pattern and pockets were not centered properly when attatched to the top portion so pockets and pattern were off. Material was a little cheaper feeling then I expected.
2.0,"Cute looking bag, however over priced for faux Coach.  This is not the quality of any Coach I own and I have been a Coach fan/owner for 35+ years."
2.0,"They are what they say, however you have to cut the extra stitching to gain access to the pockets."
2.0,"Aloha, Quality was subpar at best. Sadly I didn't like the quality. The color was GREAT! Mahalo!"
2.0,Product does not match the picture.  I want one that looks like the picture.  A silver bracelet style like the picture.
2.0,"Not sure if it's supposed to be this way, but the pants has 2 different pockets.  Front right pocket is a zip, front left is standard non zip pocket.  Looking into getting another pair sent."
2.0,Came stained and it did not come off. Plus it runs big
2.0,These are quite adorable shoes... however I guess I didn't realize that the bow and top band are made out of satin... I'm not sure where my 3 year old granddaughter would wear these except indoors...
2.0,Had 2 of them brake in the week
2.0,I think they missed the mark on the decade. Cute glasses though
2.0,"A great value and very pretty - if you are pregnant!  The skirt on this dress is super wide.  I'm a slender person, and this dress looked awful on me."
2.0,You can barely - and I mean barely read the word love on the earring. The earrings are super small
2.0,"I returned this watch because after receiving it I decided that it just looked too cheap. I wish it didn't have the brand name on the face of the watch because I feel it downgrades the overall appearance. I know, its $15 so I got what I paid for. I guess I should have known."
2.0,The removable pads are too thick. They do not sit right and make things look lumpy. If you take them out then the bra is too thin to wear without anything. I suppose it's an okay product for the price. I would not purchase again. Definitely not enough support to wear during working out. These will be a 'lounge around' under a hoodie kind of bra for me.
2.0,"Material in between notches tore in multiple places, rendering those notches unusable. Very cheap material and rips easily. Bad quality."
2.0,"Really sparkly, more girly.  My son is super patriotic, a real Mr. America but this was not as patriotic and American and cool as girly and pretty."
2.0,Fit is okay but my problem is the color is not the same - black undertones make the blue not as vibrant.  Really<br />did turn out to what I needed
2.0,Tore as soon as I put it on...wasn’t tight...just the band that is attached to it wasn’t sewn properly.
2.0,The cap is too big!!! Material is not soft
2.0,I bought this shirt because from the photos the lightning bolt appeared to be glittering and made from either sequins or glitter. Imagine my disappointment I opened the package and realized it was nothing more than screenprinted black with white blotches. I had bought it hoping it could be used as a dressier t shirt for a weekend work trip. Guess I'll have to find a way to make it glitter myself. Very disappointing.
2.0,Doesn't fit well on my 4 year old.
2.0,Poor quality on everything
2.0,This hat shrunk badly after I used it while it was raining. I was so upset. Shrunk more after washing it.
2.0,Ordered the same size as this before<br /> Those fit very well. This new part is way too narrow and unwearable
2.0,had to return it it was a bit narrow. the size was way off.
2.0,It really doesn’t work for me
2.0,The color is peeling off :(
2.0,"I purchased this band as a Christmas gift for my husband. It is virtually impossible to adjust the size of the band without a jeweler. There isn't a jeweler within two hours of our home, so needless to say, it has been sitting for months unused."
2.0,"If you want a very thick mask, this is the one.  The ear loops are adjustable and comfortable, but the overall comfort is compromised by the thickness of the mask.  This will not prevent your glasses from fogging up."
2.0,Color faded drastically after 1 or 2 washes.
2.0,regret I have purchased it...looks like glass beads...<br />and beads are very small !
2.0,"The wallet measures 10.3 x 7.1 cm. It is a little wider than a standard credit card (see the attached picture). Empty, the wallet itself is very slim and when full the materials do not add much to its total size.<br /><br />However, I cannot recommend this product because the quality of materials and durability is poor. This is the second wallet I purchase from Dash Co and both have suffered from the same problem - they do not last very long, ultimately falling apart. Many reviews praise these wallets as great with little other details. Beware of reviews that are not verified purchases!<br /><br />About a month after using the Havok ID wallet one of the sealed edges came undone. This revealed the materials underneath - paper. I don't care if the wallet is made from paper as long as it is functional and durable, and unfortunately this wallet is not. It does look good though. If you want a wallet that is slim, this one is, but if you want it to last for more than a month, keep looking."
2.0,"I ordered a few different dresses from Amazon to try on.  This one was my least favorite and was returned.  The material was cheap, and it fit a little weird. I wear a size 4, ordered a small.  The weird part was the knit part of the top went straight down from my boobs (32D) more like a slightly loose t-shirt rather than how the picture shows it as fitted. There are dresses on this site with a similar look, the lace band across the waist, that have a much better fit and nicer material."
2.0,"The scarf has nice colors and is quite pretty, but it is made in China."
2.0,It's a little short for my wrist. I wish it was a little bit longer.
2.0,"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED! These took over TWO MONTHS to receive. Very cheap looking, poor quality ."
2.0,"Sizing is somewhat tricky along with the quality of this item. The Large in this is poor quality whilst the XL is a better quality but fits looser. Was disappointed with my purchase, i went with the Large and should've stuck with the original XL that i first ordered. Wasn't able to get the XL in the end which was quite disappointing because i loved this dress so much."
2.0,"AMENDED REVIEW:<br />Below is what I said before I actually handled the bracelet, never even got to wear mine, I moved it twice in my jelewry box and the next time I touched it, was to wear it and it broke! I have no idea how it happened, just fell apart in my hands.<br /><br />I ordered eight, I received eight, took about two weeks to get. I bought them for wedding party gifts.<br /><br />When I opened the package and held the bracelet it felt like more plastic then fabric.<br /><br />You definitely get what you pay for."
2.0,Quality is good but the size is bigger than I expected.
2.0,RUNS SMALL and TIGHT<br />Order 1 size up
2.0,My son liked the style but they were enormous. The sizing was off.
2.0,"Excellent belt but I ordered a medium, supposedly for a 32&#34; - 34&#34; waist and got a belt that could fit a 42&#34; - 44&#34; waist!  I gave it to the fat guy next door for his golf shorts and he was ecstatic because it fit him like a glove!"
2.0,"Too big for a ""minimalist"" wallet. And I don't remember which color i ordered but it certainly wouldn't have been pictured this light beige color.. I thought I'd be getting a darker more dark brown hue. Construction seems okay."
2.0,Not woven. Very satiny/shiny which was not what I expected from a “woven” tie.
2.0,Returned this solid color dress. Did not fit me correctly.
2.0,"The quality of the material is too thin meaning you can see right through the pant. It is so thin, you can see the lining of the pockets. The size is not true size; I normally wear a large however, I ordered XXL to be on the safe size and it fit like a large. The material is bright and soft."
2.0,Quality is good but runs very small.
2.0,"They seem to have separated these products into the ripped ones and the plain ones. When I originally purchased this, they were all under the same listing. I purchased #5, Coffee Ripped, and #1, Black and grey striped. I love the black and grey striped. Really cute and comfy. This one, while looking cute, is not as good. The material is thicker, and there is almost this felt type lining on the inside of the Ripped style hats. Because of that, the hat appears bulkier, and also makes it warmer to wear. The ripped hats are not as good all around as the plain and striped hats from this same company. LOVED THE STRIPED ONES. And will be buying more of those. But I will not buy any more of the ripped ones. Has nothing to do with quality. The quality of the ripped style hats is great. Just the thickness and material used in comparison to their other style hats is not the same."
2.0,"It's a pretty earring but it is way too large to fit my cartilage. I thought it would be lighter and smaller, but it is large and heavy. I don't recommend buying this, the price isn't worth the disappointment."
2.0,"Product is great.  I rarely have anything negative to comment about regarding Amazon but this time I feel I need to offer my opinion - packaging and delivery are top notch 95% of the time.  This delivery came without any outside packaging - in other words, it was delivered in a clear plastic bag for all to see from my front steps.  Granted, the delivery was only a set of big boys PJs but it would have counted if it was taken and I had to go out to a department store to replace it.  Thank you."
2.0,They looked really goofy
2.0,"i knew i wa purchasing ""fashion"" jewelry and the quality would not be great but i struck out on this one bad. The stone is very dull"
2.0,Poor quality bag
2.0,"I only had this item for less than a month, and the strap has already ripped out, and the attachable strap has broken as well. On the metal part. So no, this purse did not work for me."
2.0,Top was big bottom was a bit smaller than expected for the size....
2.0,I was excited to order this hoodie having seen it online many times.  At 5'1 and busty not a good fit.  It was tight in the chest and really long on the arms.  The pockets on the front is only for looks. My small hands won't even fit in them.
2.0,Runs slightly small. Highly suggest half size or one size up. Super comfy shoes and very easy to get on and off.  Ours arrived defective and heel kept slipping out
2.0,I guess the creator didn’t think of the waist to thigh ratio. I ordered a 2XL/3xl and it does not fit my legs. I’ve tried to lower it closer to the knee and still doesn’t fit my thigh
2.0,"My friend loved the material and design of this and a couple dresses, but it didn't quite fit correctly in all the right places. Returns on clothing on Amazon are a must when shopping, and it came in handy. She was sad to send it back."
2.0,"Described as a warm winter coat. I grew up in northern Canada where winter temps regularly reach -30F.  As soon as I pulled it out of the package and tried it on I knew this would never hold up against those temps and would be unsuitable for the trip home. It would work fine in Alabama winter's where the temperature only drops to 18F. Also the sizing chart put me as a medium, I could easily have worn a small."
2.0,They were very pretty but one came out my ear and I lost it the same day that's why I gave them two stars.
2.0,Runs two sizes too big. Top of the dress is gorgeous and very flattering. Skirt has a very stiff lining inside that has a mind of its own Returned it.
2.0,Did not fit well I return them
2.0,Cheap! That's all I have to say. I would  never buy this product again. I wore it once and have it to goodwill.
2.0,I have bought quite a few of the Allegra K dresses. They are a great price for cute clothes for work. My one complaint is that they are meant for shorter women. I am 5’7” and the elastic waists are often a bit too high. I usually fix it with a wider belt. This one is so high that there’s no way I can hide it. I even ordered an XL. This is probably reallly cute if you are 5’5” or shorter. Also probably not great for large chests because that pulls the waistband up too.
2.0,"I ordered the denim blue, and it looks nothing like what is in the picture. Much more acid washed (not as good looking imo)<br /><br />I'm guessing they used the same picture for both models, and is actually showing the dark blue."
2.0,"So disappointed!  This is nothing like expected except for the fit... which is the only reason I gave two stars. This is thin, the fur is cheap, and the quality is terrible with messy stitching and strings hanging!  The worst part is one pocket was completely sewn shut...and had an inspection sticker attached to that mistake!  Looks like they knew but just didn’t care!  This took almost two months to arrive and I bought it as a gift for my daughter. I am embarrassed to give her this obvious cheap knock-off that ended up looking nothing like the photos. The color was good but outer material was thin and wrinkled with no way to straighten it out. You could see the blue color through the faux fur and workmanship left a lot to be desired. I could almost deal with the thinness since we live in a warmer climate, but the missing picket is a deal-breaker. I’m sending it back."
2.0,"Smells horrible, let it air out for weeks and still smells horrible. Wasn't able to use it on my trip for fear of it contaminating my clothes. It literally smells like it was dropped in a chemical bath before it was shipped out. For the record the bag looks absolutely fantastic, just hoping it finally stops stinking so i can use it one day."
2.0,I’ve had other polarized glasses before which were expensive but unfortunately have been lost.  This pair didn’t live up to my expectation unfortunately.  I have had polarized glasses that were clearer and crisper when you look through them.  Guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,It's cute but the top is made out of really cheap material.
2.0,The material is cheap and flimpsy. Its subliminated printed after its not part of the material. Its like a spandexy but not stretchy material. Its weird nothing like the picture implies. Sad because i was ready to buy more colors if i liked it. This is just cheap garbage
2.0,Poor quality and see through when wet
2.0,"Very pretty, but too big for my wrist"
2.0,It gave me allergies. Turns color to quick.
2.0,Meh - beads are ok - I've seen better.
2.0,They were way to big for me. I returned them. I have tried other glasses from Amazon that were to small so I thought these would work and I was wrong. I have a large head but these were huge.
2.0,Definitely not for sneakers.  These are more for lace up work boots.  Very long strings!
2.0,It looked better in the pictures. When it arrived I was disappointed.
2.0,I bought this after watching the tiktok video and thought it would be cool. How ever the item came very bright not easy to match unless you have a Hollywood make up person.
2.0,"thought I could get away with going with a cheap pair of glasses, since I like to ding mine. these, quite honestly, have a terrible chemical plastic smell that hasn't gone away. to be fair, I'll come back and change the rating if they ever air out enough to be worn. for now, no good even at the low price"
2.0,Has was a bit to small than expected.
2.0,"I ordered a size up, but apparently I needed two sizes up. it is really cute, just wish it would have fit :("
2.0,"ehh, these earings feel flimsy and cheap....which i cant complain too much about because they ARE cheap. maybe i was expecting something different and a little thicker and more noticeable."
2.0,One of the inside zippers broke the 3rd day I had the bag. The shoulder strap is too easily detachable from the bag as it comes off repeatedly.
2.0,My daughter is a thin taller build. She’s 9 and normally wears a size 10/12. I got the size listed as age 14 in the plain navy blue to be on the safe side and it barley fit. Runs very small. If it wasn’t for the elastic stretched out all the way she wouldn’t have been able to get it on. It was very snug but I didn’t feel like going through the hassle to return it. She wore it to school and came home the same day with a button missing… waste of money
2.0,"Last time I am going to order on line, the material is scratchy and gross. Thick, does not lay on skin the right way."
2.0,"Quality was okay, not great, ordered my regular size, should have ordered down. Returned mine"
2.0,The lace at the sides were not fastened down. The material is thin and see through. It was very tight at the chest
2.0,The color was bright but it arrived and it was way too long and wide. more like a plus size fit- I didn't try it on because it was clear that it would swallow me completely... and im 25 weeks pregnant.
2.0,"She wore one time, flowers were cheaply glued on and when washed came off and made a nasty mess. Went right to the trash"
2.0,The cinching of the waist is literally right underneath the breast.  Not a great fit
2.0,This was advertised as a women’s medium but was clearly a men’s medium. Too much trouble to return.
2.0,"I thought these were going to be shorter, but they dragged on the floor (I'm 5'6 and had them well above my belly button for a high rise fit). They also were weirdly large in the waist and too tight in the thigh/crotch. Pretty pant in person, but just a very wonky fit."
2.0,"I ordered in accordance to the comments for my 8 year-old daughter, who normally wears a 7/8, buying her a 14/16, as the length needed to be at or below the knee and not be too fitted, so as to not sexualize my young child, as most little girls clothes do these days.<br /><br />I actually bought 2 different 2-pack designs and she absolutely loves them all! Great fit!<br /><br />Update: Machine washed in cold water, like dried and they shrunk  a full size. Returning!"
2.0,very cheap broke day 1
2.0,Could be cute but be very clear about what color your thi k your ordering and what color your actually ordering
2.0,"Not flexible, top part is very rigid"
2.0,"Absolutely beautiful, but scratched after only a couple of days & hardly anything touched it."
2.0,Cute suit but runs small. Had to return.
2.0,I was expecting this hat to be a felt/suede like material but it’s not. It also is very big—it looks like a trucker hat on me. Definitely a grandpa hat.
2.0,Bought the shoes end of Sept. 2018 and they were as advertised until the insides began to cut into my feet after 4 months  of daily use. I had to buy Dr. Scholl's plantar fasciitis inserts to wear them again.
2.0,Returned to seller. Too big; sleeves too long
2.0,"I have large calves and sadly these aren't made for that. Overall the quality of these compression socks are really nice, which makes me doubly sad they don't fit.<br /><br />The fabric is thick, soft and not at all scratchy. I love the pop of color on black. These are nice enough to wear with cropped pants or a dress. Unfortunately, I can not wear them because  I ordered the L/XL (size 10 shoe) but was sent XS/SM. Because these are made for someone with a much smaller foot, there is no way I could even get it on my foot.<br /><br />If you have normal size calves and are looking for compression socks for running or traveling, then these are fun and fashionable compression socks. If you are plus size or have wide calves, sadly these will not work well for you."
2.0,Ordered again large and it came as XXL. Before Ordered XL got a XXXL
2.0,The hat is big the inner part is very small and only sit on top of my head. The button on the top of it is Sub par at best. Plus the tighten button on the strap that helps keep the hat on your head is broke when I got it today. Like it was dry rotted or just mad or just made out of the cheapest material I ever seen.
2.0,very small not like my other ones
2.0,"Too small and not high rise.<br /><br />Pros<br />Good material<br />Not see through<br />Pocket<br />Gray color is true to picture<br /><br />Cons<br />Mid-rise. Top came halfway to belly button. At 5' 2"" it doesn't take a lot of material to be high waist on me yet this was mid rise at best.<br /><br />Too snug. At 140lbs I'm a solid medium in everything except clothes from Asia. Should have ordered large."
2.0,Much larger than expected but pretty
2.0,When I ordered these gloves I thought yes this winter I’d be able to use my electronic devices without the need of removing my gloves. Well the joke was on me because my first time using this gloves was a disappointment. So I wouldn’t recommend these gloves to anyone. The only reason I gave wrong stars is because I think the gloves are cute.
2.0,The colors were nice and the fabric was soft which is why I gave it 2 Stars. The construction was terrible and the fabric did not hold its shape properly and was extremely thin meaning that I would have to wear a shirt underneath. I returned them
2.0,"These are very thin, cheap headbands. I suppose for the price, not bad but by the time you pay for shipping, not worth it."
2.0,"The belt looks nice and solid, but with a little over a month of use the end of the tooth popped off and now the belt will not stay clasped shut. The front is also scuffed and showing wear"
2.0,"The sizing is way off I ordered it & it was too big, set it back & ordered 2 sizes smaller & it was bigger than b4! However the ring is nice & they did just tell me to keep the ring & gave me a refund."
2.0,Beware! The color is way different in person then advertised here. I bought it Because of the color advertised but what i received is a dark green color not the light color stone i wanted. Had ive know i wouldnt waste my time here.
2.0,"It looked nice, but the retractable part broke after a few weeks."
2.0,"The cat pendant is cute, but the chain catches on EVERYTHING and snags a lot of my sweaters.  I got three of these so my daughter, her aunt, and I would all have matching ones, but I don't wear mine because the chain snags and she actually broke her chain (she IS only 6....so I don't think that's entirely a fault in the chain).  On the bright side, the cat is darling and sturdy, so I can restring the necklaces on less scratchy chains!"
2.0,I GAVE THESE COMPRESSION PANTS A 2 STAR BECAUSE THEY WETE NOTHING WHAT I EXPECTED!! THEY ARE NOT TIGHT ON MY LEGS AT ALL LIKE COMPRESSION SHORTS SHOULD BE LIKE AND WHEN IM EXCERSIZING THEY RIDE UP MY LEGS I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED!!
2.0,One time use only
2.0,Very bulky and hard to slide the glasses on and off your face. The plastic becomes bulky. Tried changing the position of the plastic. Still not comfortable
2.0,Expected it to be cotton but was a spandex. The flower print looked stretched and distorted
2.0,Size and being all plastic.
2.0,"Bought this watch for my son.  Looks good but the directions are horrible and don't help at all. Now it keeps alerting at every hour and we cant shut it off. So he can't wear it to school,  which is why I bought it."
2.0,Poor compression and too small to stay up for a plus size female. They were around my ankles within the first hour of my shift.
2.0,The waist band was not like advertised. My biggest complaint is you can’t pick your own colors or styles. I can never find my size 7 in the low rise. Stock more and let us pick the colors and designs. And get some up to date prints. Pretty expensive to for going straight to the company.
2.0,"I'm happy with the color of the product, but the picture is deceiving. The plugs are much longer front to back than shown in the picture which makes them look huge in your ears. Also, I've been wearing a 00 for years now and I have never had as much trouble putting in plugs as I have with these. I own other natural stone plugs that are much truer to size. The saddle isn't very prominent and I think the only thing holding them in is how huge they are. I still wear them cause I like the colour, but I had hoped they'd be my every day plugs, instead I only wear them once every few weeks."
2.0,Came with a cute on the go bag.
2.0,didn't like the almost see thru
2.0,I should have listened to one of the comments made in the reviews of these leggings but I thought if I ordered a somewhat darker color I wouldnt have a problem.....which is......somehow the fit of these leggings exposes the crotch area in a &#34;revealing&#34; way...to put it mildly. I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing these leggings worrying about whether my shirt is long enough to conceal &#34;things&#34;.
2.0,"Very flimsy pair of white gloves, but it got us through Halloween night!"
2.0,"I suppose it’s my fault for not checking this specific size chart. But I have bought several shapers before and have always worn a small. I assumed it was an ADULT small. My 4 year old could fit the waist on this. Check the size chart. Now I couldn’t say for sure because I couldn’t try it on, but the fabric seemed pretty thin and flimsy."
2.0,Purchased for my mom- says the clasps are awkward and placement is not comfortable.
2.0,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and when I received it, the emblem on it wasn’t aligned properly."
2.0,"It was a neat idea, but it just fit weird...the bust was too small and oddly shaped."
2.0,"Novel idea but if you're actually plus size these look and feel just like wearing men's swim trunks in a size too small. The material doesn't bother me, as I got them to wear during the hot sticky summer for work but the fit is terrible. Very odd/tight through the crotch which is weird when something appears to be high waisted or intended for such... and then it's baggy in the knee. I'd only recommend for people that have a very tiny waist maybe? IDK... it doesn't seem cut well for people plus size. It would have to be very very blousy and flowy to channel this look and it just isn't working especially with the material."
2.0,Not useable..
2.0,"Meh, they worked for a skit we had planned, but the quality really isn't great at all. Not sure I would purchase the same ones again."
2.0,"The little black clips that suppose to keep the mask attached doesn't work. The strings are constantly coming off the mask & leaving the black plastic clip attached to the mask with no string. Mainly because the black clips dont completely close. They stay open just enough for the string to slip through. I kept re-connecting them then just gave up, threw them away & ordered another much better, durable brand."
2.0,The dress was great and I was all set to wear it for my event two days after it arrived... until I saw it had a stain.  Items should not arrive messed up!
2.0,"Size wise, it didn't work. Returned it."
2.0,Cute but my favorite broke before I got to wear it
2.0,does not fit confrontable
2.0,"The necklace I received looked nothing like the picture unfortunately. The beads I received did not loop around twice, and were plain white.  Pretty sure it was not the necklace in the picture."
2.0,"Pretty, though far to small for 13 year old granddaughter let alone a grown woman.<br />Might work for petite women.<br />Very pretty, had to go back though."
2.0,"The comfort is okay and they do a decent job for arch support, but they are really hot. Sitting at a computer in the office my feet excessively sweat, even more than in my cowboy boots. I've had them for a week and they already smell like they're 3 months old."
2.0,I disliked paying for the return!!  It was to small. I wanted to exchange for a larger size but I wont do that now.
2.0,Cute shirt but runs small and fits awkward. I am small chested (32A) and the small was tight on me and too short to even wear comfortably as a crop top tucked into some high waisted shorts. I’m returning.
2.0,"I absolutely adored the look of this suit and the quality seemed really nice, but I'm 5'8&#34; and it was not even close to being long enough. I have a long torso but this was so short that I couldn't even imagine how short I would have to be to fit into it."
2.0,Too long in the crotch. Gets hung on the nose of my seat often. Front pockets are shallow and useless.
2.0,The shirt I ordered was to be xxl but the shirt was still to tight.  I had no idea I was so fat.
2.0,The socks are comfortable.  Unfortunately I didn't look at the wool content.  These are 80% acrylic and only 16% wool.  Not very warm.
2.0,"SURPRISED- our pkg of 4 arrived with 3 LT-( lg tall) shirts and 1 shirt that is about 2 1/2 inches shorter. All labeled LT- but clearly a big difference. Not going to return all of them because it is so hard to get talls these days, but it is annoying. Quality of shirts seems fine, tho not anything special. Kind of disappointed..."
2.0,These glasses look great but have no glare protection whatsoever. Might as well not have any sunglasses on at all.
2.0,"Super cute shades, got the black ones was going to order more. HOWEVER, the lens unscrew from the frames, and the glasses come apart VERY easily. I've had them for about 3 weeks, and they've already broken. Im sick of trying to keep them screwed together.  Absolute design/materials flaw."
2.0,Head did not fit in. There was no opening; it was a ridiculous design
2.0,"It's a clean-looking bag, and it holds stuff, but there aren't enough pockets and the front hand loop separated from the bag's seam not long after purchase. The zipper is one of the kind that feels toothy against your skin, like it will scratch up your hands and eat them.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this bag if you are actually taking it to the gym."
2.0,It's HUGE like for adult male not female 5ft2 (Which it was intended for) sizer doesn't lock so it comes loose &falls off
2.0,These pants were missized. My friend has the same pants and she tries the ones i purchased and they were way too small.
2.0,I was only able to use one nylon pair in this package. The others reamed very quickly
2.0,They run very big. Not flattering at all.
2.0,I was so excited to get this for my mother I bought them in May and brought them to her today in the middle of June and they are dead already .  I’m going to go buy new batteries to see what happens next I should’ve read the reviews it doesn’t sound like I’m alone .
2.0,I use this for my job at a factory so my clothes don't get messy and the pocket is already ripping off
2.0,This shirt was too short abd I have a short torso. The material is shiny nylon. Not a fan.
2.0,These sandals are cute but too big. Ask for 1/2 to 1 so down.<br />2 stars? Because they should have been made of leather and the straps are too loose and it’s hard to walk with them as your wants to slide out. They arrived quickly but I’m returning them as quickly.
2.0,I'm frustrated because the bag does not have the side pocket like advertised. Will be returning. Not worth $80.
2.0,"Deceitful!  This is not the product I had ordered.  Material and color are completely different.  With that being said, I will be keeping the item since I do like it, I just do not like the dishonesty."
2.0,"Sleek and durable in the reviews? Well, maybe in some opinions. Mine is that it is cheap plastic (logo clip). I am also dubious about the genuine leather as well."
2.0,Got these as a gift - to me the material is very stiff - images are cute but fabric very cheap.
2.0,Nice image but way to big for my child’s face.<br />I am going to get it refitted and sewn for a child’s face but likely will lose some Pokémon in the process.
2.0,Nice gloves but have chemical on inside - hard to remove from hands even after washing several times.  Still debating if worth the effort to return.  Would not recommend unless your hands are already grimy with junk from your work environment....
2.0,"I ordered one of these blouses several years ago.  I ordered a large and it fits okay, but not comfortable.  I decided to order one as a gift on an XL and it was absolutely massive.  The difference between the large and x large was unreal.  Returned.  Overall not happy with the first one ordered several years ago either because it’s definitely snug for a large."
2.0,It is somewhat small .
2.0,I love the glasses I just wish the material on the sides was real leather!
2.0,Very nice but didn’t last long. Doesn’t hold a lot of keys.
2.0,"The mask seems to be good quality. However, the size is way too small for adults.  Luckily my two boys (both still under 5’5”) need masks too.  Even at that, the mask barely fits my son who is 5’4.5”."
2.0,I used this gor my 2 year old daughter for my sons wedding. It was too big and hung off her shoulders and was way too big around and made the ruffles hang weird.
2.0,"Ran small, very tight and I'm little.  I returned it...."
2.0,"I ordered the Black& deep Red boat neck Tee like in the picture.  I was sent a navy and bright red tee that has a crinkled material and looks and feels cheap.  Description on website says Black and Red and picture is of a quality tee.  I washed it in cold water and line-dried and the crinkle material shrinked to a small in width, like an accordian.  Can't wear again.  The blue and white I ordered was nice and like the picture and description.  I wore the one I got because I needed a top to wear to a casual outing and it came the night before going early the next morning.  No time to return, so I went with it."
2.0,Medium to large doesn’t fit me. May need to exchange for a small-medium. Even on the tightest it is very loose.
2.0,New review bad stitching after a few weeks wallet is torn will not recommend as durable sad because it looks great but poor stitch you get what you pay for.
2.0,Its ok but not liking the tone of it. And it will only fit small necks. And it is not as thick as the picture
2.0,"I ordered a size up so it fits fine. However, it is wayyyy shorter than pictured. I am wearing a tank top underneath and you can see the bottom of the tank"
2.0,"I really wanted to like these.  But I couldn't.<br />On the plus side, they are surprisingly good quality considering the price per pair.  They fit well, they're solid, and I even liked the colors.<br />On the minus...<br />First, they're dark.  When I say dark, I don't mean &#34;slightly-overcast-today&#34; kind of dark, I mean &#34;Holy-crap-where-did-the-sun-go?&#34; kind of dark.  That's not really the issue, though.  You know, for that price, I'm willing to live with that.<br />The real problem was that the lenses were blurry.  There was nothing on them.  Something in the lenses themselves made it difficult to see through them clearly.  That presents two problems.  One, it's a safety issue.  I wear shades when I'm driving or riding, and that's it.  I can't afford not to see.<br />Two, the view through them was so bad that my eyes actually strained to see through them, similar to wearing someone else's prescription glasses.  I'm not about to ruin my eyes over a cheap pair of shades.<br />Maybe I got a bad batch, maybe my eyes are overly sensitive.  They're several good reviews for these.  All I'm saying is, use at your own risk."
2.0,The images are deceptive. The pendant is so small you can barely tell what it is. The quality in the pictures is not the quality of product you receive.
2.0,"As for the looks, this shirt is nice. Everything else, not so much. I pulled this out of the bag and instantly could tell the fabric is cheap, it's very thin and the material looks softer than it actually is. Several threads on the seams near the buttons are frayed and sticking out. I put the shirt on and the arm/wrist holes are two different sizes! What in the world?! I had to squeeze my left hand through one, and my right hand came out through the sleeve very easily. I'd also like to add that the images here are slightly deceptive, I imagined this shirt would allow for easy rolling-up of the sleeves but this is not the case. Very disappointing."
2.0,Half of the rings have sharp edges that irritated my ears. Since I didn't need all of them they will get me by until I get better constructed ones. Although they are great sizes.
2.0,"Bought this synthetic alternative so that would have a waterproof band, overall it is thin and looks fairly nice but has a soft inside lining that absorbs water like a sponge. Also began splitting at edges after weeks of use."
2.0,"This was an ok item, the sizing was just definitely off. Fit about 2 sizes smaller… If you’re a large buy a size or two larger."
2.0,It was tarnished. I’m returning it free of charge for a replacement.
2.0,Bad material quality
2.0,"Bought these for a trip to Miami. They were very pretty, but one of them broke as the quality is cheap."
2.0,This is a beautiful band but is not worth the price.  It is made of a thin material.  After 2 weeks of wearing it the holes started ripping.  There are dozens of floral bands for your Versa that are 1/2 the price.
2.0,It was too big and I am having a difficult time getting it sized to fit.  I have not been able to wear it yet.
2.0,"I ordered a size XL and it was definitely like a size small. I'd like a replacement, but don'twant the hassle of returning."
2.0,"It's OK,  not made great... Strings are sticking out and I'll  eat my shoe if this is leather.  I paid for leather but got some other material.  I thought it would be brown but it's  more like a cinnamon reddish color.  This hat is also bigger and would be better for a man.  It's  not really feminine and my head is of an average size."
2.0,"These are really light weight and cheaply made.  They are not like the picture. The picture shows the leg going almost to the knee, which is what I was looking for, these barely are 3 inches below the crotch.  It runs extremely small."
2.0,"These glasses are cute be cheaply made, even for the price. I returned this item."
2.0,This one like the brown one dies not fit me I'm 170 lbs and I'm not and it doesn't quite go around there's a 3 inch gap between fitting.
2.0,It's a nice shirt... I really like it. But it is a size and a half small
2.0,The stitching unraveled and it looks really old and disheveled after only one wear. The piece is full of lint. Very disappointed!
2.0,I love the way it looks. It so cute. Unfortunately it doesn’t run true to size.  I ordered it for my son to wear at his graduation in two days.  I’m very disappointed I dot. Have enough time to get him another in time and also unfortunately they don’t make a bigger size. I’m auper bummed....
2.0,I got the Medium for my 10-year-old son who is relatively small for his age. The fit is as expected and that's about the only thing right about this.<br /><br />The fabric is 100% polyester and it feels plasticky.<br /><br />Sewing/stitching work is horrendous. Tapering around each leg is inconsistent poorly executed as I tried to capture in my photos.<br /><br />I would stay away from it
2.0,time is way off still works
2.0,Runs small and very cheaply made.
2.0,strange fit at least for me but the fabric seemed nice.
2.0,Not what I was expecting. It’s not a scarf that wraps around your neck. It’s a mask with a giant folded hankie sewn to the bottom of it. I will probably just cut the bottom off and use it as a regular mask.
2.0,It is a cheap shoe.  And it did not last very long for an active boy.
2.0,Thin. Definitely looks better in the picture.
2.0,"really flimsy and bendable.  Not of quality but still cute.  If you want expensive looking jewelry look elsewhere.  But if you do not mind dollar store  jewelry you can get it.  I actually wore it on a date and it wasnt that bad looking, really sleek and eye catching."
2.0,"Only thing about this one is that it did not have a zipper on the inside. The stiching for the zipper was there but not the zipper itself, so it can not open. I will be shipping it back for an exchange."
2.0,"Didn't like thevway it fit, hard to charge with this"
2.0,"Sadly, Grid-it performed far worse than I expected. When loaded and places in my bag things regularly fall out. I bought 8&#34; and 10&#34;, both didn't work for me. I gave both away and don't intend to use it anymore."
2.0,second try for slippers second fail.
2.0,Don’t waste your money on this. Most of the pages ripped as my son was trying to place his cards in it.
2.0,"I did not notice a difference between using these glasses or not.  I also did the different tests to see if it was blocking blue light and they did not appear to work.  I get regular migraines and struggle wearing glasses for long periods of time, and these were no different.  I could not wear them for long without them causing a migraine.  I'm bummed.  I was really hoping they would work."
2.0,"I really wanted to like these. They fit well and are cute, but itchy. :( I don't understand how other reviewers say they're soft! Maybe I'm extra sensitive."
2.0,"I got the red, black , and blue. The blue turned out to be a bright blue versus the periwinkle color that I wanted. I was very upset."
2.0,"These barely qualify as t shirts.  Terrible quality.  I have always liked Hanes, these are different.  Incredibly thin."
2.0,"I could barely get this turtle neck over my head, I heard the stitches rip when I put it over my head and could barely put it on. I usually wear a large and I ordered a size up and it still barely fit over my head. It is form fitting, ribbed, and the sleeves are long which I like. The material is thinner but it is not see through. I do like the fit once you get it on, but the sizes run very small. It also hides bulges like stomach rolls or bra straps."
2.0,Faded with first wash
2.0,"These belts are ridiculous.  The buckle won't fit thru standard belt loops so you have to run the belt thru the loops, then try to get the buckle onto the belt strap AND adjust it to fit.  The strap is thick and the strap loop is tight.  Once you connect the buckle, there is no adjusting it.  You have to unbuckle it, then try to correct the adjustment.  Good luck if you have anything other than 6-pack abs.  The strap is one length (49"") so unless you have a 44"" waist, you're going to have a lot of extra strap and there is only a cheap stretchy loop to hold it in place.  That said, the belt and buckle are rock-solid.  For $16, it will make a nice replacement for the old Army pistol belt I've been using for a tool belt for the last 30 years."
2.0,I had to exchange this.  The tank seems to run a little large so I had to exchange it!  Not crazy about the fabric but the company was very nice to deal with.
2.0,"These earrings are gorgeous, I love the looks of them but when I opened the package one was already broken and a piece of the chain on the other is nearly broken too.<br /><br />I’m rather disappointed in the fact I paid only to have a broken product sent to me when they shouldn’t even be that fragile to begin with."
2.0,the bottom is good but the top is useless. Top is more for people who don't have large breasts.
2.0,"This watch came in the mail in a small leather box. Taking it out, it is as light as plastic and the materials of the band and watch feel cheap. The sundial does not stand up well. When it arrived, one of the bearings of the compass inside was loose, rolling around inside the watch. This made the compass wobble and basically not work well at all. There are four typos on the back of the watch, meaning it was never proof read. I would not recommend this watch for it's current price."
2.0,"The quality is poor and the design isn’t cute. I returned and didn’t get my full refund. Overall, I’m sad I bought them in the first place. I found better deals and designs at Walmart and old navy"
2.0,The lenses scratch very easily. Quality is poor.
2.0,Cross is huge and rather tacky looking.  The large flower is much smaller than you would think from looking at the photo.  We returned this and just used a plain white bow instead.
2.0,Pendant too large for chain
2.0,"The quality of this dress is awful, fabric is very cheap."
2.0,Design was great but size was so huge like 3 sizes too big. And very long
2.0,"Not nearly as vibrant in color as the pictures, very washed out in color, not as elastic as most of these type of gaiters. Overall I am disappointed"
2.0,Really loved this bag for work. Straps broke at the airport on my first trip within two months of purchase.
2.0,Fell apart and fit small
2.0,"I like this brand but these were a fail. Fabric was thin and shear and not compressing at all, could see underwear and dimples in upper thighs. They were a little looser than a small typically would be, so they definitely weren't sheer based on being too tight. Mine came with a loose thred through the crotch that looked like it would unravel at any time and yet amazon is requiring a mail them back for a refund. Annoying. I would recommend the full length though, I was happy with those. The only good thing about these is comfort and price."
2.0,Very hard to get on and the second time I used one pair it ripped in the crotch area.
2.0,Poor quality and wrong size. Two stars for the color.
2.0,Super cute but the chain gave my neck a rash.
2.0,cute but very small and cheaply made. would recommend going 2-3 sizes up
2.0,Cheap material. See thru. Looks like a cheap slip.
2.0,Face of watch is deceiving looks lighter in color than what it truly is.  I will keep it since I wa looki for a inexpensive one for work. I'm near sighted an like a larger face on my watches
2.0,"These are pretty, the earring hook is clearly sterling silver and stamped 925 but the actual earrings look like steel not sterling. There is a huge difference in color between the hook and earring. It is why I even noticed the difference. I won't use this seller again"
2.0,I tried similar sizes in store and this one runs about 1 or more size to small
2.0,It doesn't latch well. I tried to wear this during a session and it kept popping off and it's because the clasps are cheaply made
2.0,"They barely work. A slight reduction of glare from car headlights coming towards me. To me, the SOXICK Night Driving Glasses Anti Glare Polarized HD Night Vision Safe Glasses were a waste of money."
2.0,"This dress was too big and very cheap looking.  No tassels on the back which made it look worse as far as cost is concerned.  I know it is a costume but relly bad looking in person.  Looked better online, where it should stay."
2.0,"No me agradó el material de la tela. Es un modelo bonito, pero mal material."
2.0,I hated the fabric they used. It was very large. It does look like the image.
2.0,My son refuses to wear them. He says the mesh is scratchy.
2.0,These are way too big. In leggings I generally wear an XL but these are huge. Like the reversible concept but these are too thick
2.0,"This looks great, but it breaks at every section. I'm very disappointed in this bracelet."
2.0,Stitching was a bit weird with the front other than that looks great
2.0,"These leggings are so soft! They were too big behind the knees. HOWEVER, when I got home after the first wear, I found holes on the butt but the middle seam. I did not do anything extra today, just walking around work. I am very disappointed, and wish they were better quality."
2.0,I guess the sizing wasn't accurate ! Are we n Asian standards or US?needed to size up like 3x's!
2.0,Size states: Men’s XXL...but the actual size is Men’s Medium or Kids XXL. For reference I’m 6’5 w/. 40in waist and these couldn’t even be pulled up over my thighs. Quality seemed to be good. Soft material.
2.0,They seem to be more BROWN then Black.
2.0,Need two order size bigger.
2.0,"This look is super cute, but the straps were painful and there's about a foot of fabric that isn't necessary."
2.0,"I ordered these for my great nephew who just turned 4 a couple of weeks ago. He LOVES excavators and construction equipment so I am always trying to find him something with excavators or cranes on them. I realize that he is taller than most 4 year old boys and packed full of muscle so I ordered them for older boys since the size came in age. They did not fit him at all, but they do fit his little sister who will turn 2 next month."
2.0,"Awesome shoe, just the sizes are a little off. I bought these for my wife, and one of the shoes is too tight to wear."
2.0,Masks were very very small for adults.
2.0,"These cases are not durable at all they are very flimsy and cheap looking 👀.  I’m very upset that I bought these and know that returning them would be more of a trouble than it’s worth. I would recommend not to buy these , spend more money for quality.  😟"
2.0,These masks don’t do anything except satisfy the mask rules.  They really don’t provide much protection.
2.0,"Mala calidad …. No se ajusta al cuerpo, lo tirantes sé rompieron, nunca lo volvería a comprar"
2.0,Loved the color but it took me forever to try and even get them up over my butt. I could barely move after putting them on because fabric was not very flexible. Last picture I posted is a size medium amazon seamless leggings next to the Jed’s medium and they are much smaller. They contour definitely didn’t fit my butt either. For reference I am 6 foot 155lbs wear a medium leggings 6/8 pants. If you do risk it size up one or two sizes.
2.0,Not as described.  Did not have the craftsmanship of BFF shirt I bought and did not live up to the description.
2.0,"The shape of the glasses are nice, but the quality is awful. The metal piece keeping both end together is askew and it makes your face look lopsided. Probably will not wear them--a waste of money."
2.0,Was really pretty but broke after only a few weeks. 😔
2.0,"I was shocked to discover this was made with hot glue and pipe cleaners. It was cute and my son still loved it but he was so sad when he saw it upon arrival.  I had to use my own glue gun to reattach the pipe cleaner ""spring"" to the headband before he could wear it.  I also had to recoil the wimpy pipe cleaners to make the bats stand up."
2.0,"Nice watch but too small,an the bracelet is hollow not very heavy at all"
2.0,It feels really cheap. It tangles easily.<br />I like that it looks vintage.<br />Not satisfied with the bracelet.the chains were coming loose.
2.0,Too small inside for foot.
2.0,This was not Sherpa. It was a weird curly acrylic that was not pleasant. Returned immediately.
2.0,Buyer beware. It's not as advertised. I received no chain and only one tiny jump ring for the other side of the pendant. I now have to buy a chain and try to get this together in a rush. The pendant itself though does look decent.
2.0,The hoop is larger then the charm. Not proportional.
2.0,"Looks good, impossible to adjust! You have to take it to a jeweler unless you buy a special tool"
2.0,"Update: This morning after attempting to latch the band around my wrist, one of the connector pieces broke.  So now the band is useless to me.  I only wore the band maybe 5 times before it broke.<br /><br />Looks great, and I'm happy very happy with the aesthetics. My only complaint with the band is figuring out how to wear it, without the band getting under the watch. Most days I have no problem, but occasionally I need to keep unlocking my watch because the band has gotten underneath the face, and the watch thinks it has been removed."
2.0,"You get what you pay for. Cheap, thin, poor fitting, but what do you expect when you order the cheapest option. 2 stars only because I quickly received what I ordered, and the berets are as described. I would recommend purchasing better quality next time....I know that's what I'm going to do."
2.0,"I bought this Women's Summer Long Sleeve Blouse Chiffon Crop over the weekend & unfortunately the sleeve on the left hand side just slid down. It was NOT stitched as securely tight as the right side. :( Not happy about that wardrobe malfunction, but thanks anyway."
2.0,"Not a fan. It is no where as cute as it is in the photo.  It makes you look frumpy as h e l l.  It took me about 10 minutes to figure out how to tie the top. Unhappy with it, but not sending back because i have to pay $4.99 shipping to return. I'll just donate it."
2.0,Chain broke first time my wife wore it and unfortunately lost it.
2.0,"Within 1 week of wearing while working as a nurse the coloring on the ring started to peel off and fade. Not worth the money. Comfortable, but not durable."
2.0,Fit was not as expected.  Collar is badly sewn and doesn't lay well.
2.0,Looked kinda cheap. Not a big fan.
2.0,"I have used similar polishing cloths for many years.  This is the first time I have had to work really hard to get any effect at all on the tarnish.  I am going to return the unused cloth.  Can I send back the used-without-satisfactory -improvement  one, too?<br />This is a waste of money.<br />Sherrill"
2.0,It was great... until the zipper stopped working after only after a few months.
2.0,The quality of the material is very poor
2.0,Broke within a day not very durable at all
2.0,Cheap material. Looks nothing like pictures
2.0,I disliked the fact that the tshirt is not a relaxed fit as shown in the photograph. It is not a comfortable shirt for me to wear because it's too stretchy and thus fits to close.
2.0,Solo llegaron 7 de los 12 añillos.
2.0,"At the time I purchased this shirt I bought four others.  They were all in the same size range 2x-3x.  This shirt fits like a pup-tent.  Honestly, it looks like a dress.  I was so disappointed because I really liked the graphic nature of the design.  Earlier in the day I bought a bathing suit, and totally forgot to buy a cover-up.  So, there is a silver lining to the story since I now get to wear this as a mu mu.  If anyone is thinking about buying this, go at least one to two sizes under your normal."
2.0,Went with the largest size and they were still to small I had sized up 2 sizes based off the comments
2.0,It's a nice bag not a bad price but it came with scratches all over the front of it.
2.0,"It feels like mumu. Not cute, the model in the pic makes it seem so cute, but it's not."
2.0,"Cute too thick material and the pocket detail is nice, it just runs big!"
2.0,"I liked the hat, but it arrived rolled up and smashed. I am still trying to get creases out."
2.0,Looks cheesy!
2.0,"Due to a growing pregnant body, I wanted a looser fit and I didn’t want to keep trying different sizes. Unfortunately the medium and large size was too tight for my comfort. The bra was comfortable, but hard to gauge the fit since pregnant breasts fluctuate in size. I had to return the product since I’m in my second trimester and tight clothing is not comfortable for me."
2.0,Very tight at the waist and ridiculously big on the legs. They look like parachute pants from the 80s! They do NOT fit like the picture at all!
2.0,"Too big for me!  Lenses are bigger than I thought, otherwise they look nice but not on me.  Would have liked them.  Not worth returning."
2.0,"The material is very disappointing.  It's like paper.  It's very thin and it makes noise when you open it up.  After I opened up a bag, permanent wrinkles set in to the paper, making the bag look old."
2.0,Look great at first and are very soft. A little bit big but still wearable. I’m 5’7” and usually wear a small but the pants were oddly long. But the pajamas completely fell apart after two washes. The buttons don’t stay together and the seams are all fraying. I would save your money!
2.0,I went up in size but still didn't fit right in the arms so ended up returning.
2.0,"The dress is not true to size, it was slightly too tight on the part around the waste. The zipper was zipped up on time when she tried it on and when she went to try it on again the day before the wedding the zipper stopped working all together. Seems to be cheaply made. Lucky she is crafty and was able to sew buttons on it and used lace to create a zigzag design on the back."
2.0,Top is tight. You can not move your arms. Material is stiff and not comfortable.
2.0,I absolutely love this print ! I was disappointment a bit . Despite washing it in fabric softener its still very stiff . Doesn't hug onto your body at all . Its not comfortable to wear . The waist strap is the only thing that will help keep it closed however its short and tough to make a knot. There's also two small strings attached to each side but they were so thin one ripped off .  very disappointed in the material and fit !
2.0,"Good color, very cute, but no shaping support at all. I can’t wear them."
2.0,"I really wanted to love these socks. I loved all the color options. Unfortunately,  as I now see many others have had the same problem, I wore them all day expecting them to feel tight around my calf & ankles. What I wasn't expecting was the very distinct bruising caused by the top of the sock being SO tight. I bought 2 pair, wore both 1 full day each hoping the discomfort would fade with use (tightness at top of socks would stretch out a bit with wear). Both pair left their own bruises at the top of the sock. Needless to say, I am unable to wear them. If the top had been more elastic (stretchy) they would have been perfect."
2.0,It arrived with a hole on the side of the romper. Other than that it was cute.
2.0,"I bought these as a back-up pair for when I didn't want to risk losing my expensive sunglasses. Consequently during the year and a half that I had them I only wore them about four or five times. They seemed pretty good until the last time I took them out to wear them the one earpiece didn't work right - flopped back-and-forth. Then when I took them off and folded them to put back in my case, it just fell off (broken - not repairable). I hadn't sat on them or abused them in any way. I hope mine were just defective. Because otherwise they are just poorly made."
2.0,"Not 8mm, definitly not for man"
2.0,"The lenses are not identical to the original lenses, they are darked. They also distort your view when looking at different angles causing headaches."
2.0,"I feel like it should have been more specific about not coming with two earrings. In the title it says EARRINGS, so I assumed that it was more than one!  Now I have to order another one and I also have to pay 8 dollars for shipping, which on the last one I got free shipping because I ordered more stuff! Not cool!!!"
2.0,"Awful, as bad as the Trump one we purchased.  Looks scary on."
2.0,"Much darker than expected, these clip ons were needed for driving but made reading the instrument panel & GPS screen too difficult. They would be OK if worn outdoors."
2.0,"Nice fabric, but turtle neck part is way too wide and droops (and not in an attractive way).  Returning."
2.0,the stone was not in place when I received it!!
2.0,Didn’t really look like the picture and I don’t like the way it fits the pants are ok but the top not long enough as shown in the picture and I ordered a size up
2.0,Underwires make it hard to buy this online. Fabric is thin almost see through and not fully lined. I’m thinking of returning it.
2.0,Wallet seems stylish tough to get credit cards out and came with a defective screwdriver with no Phillips tip just a smooth point .
2.0,Blouse is very sheer; not to my liking
2.0,Loved the distressed look and how the legs fit but the waist was too large.
2.0,You get what you pay for. Took a gamble and the arm strap that's started coming apart within a couple weeks.
2.0,not really what it looks like in the picture still kinda cute for a little kid but not really
2.0,This is not really a jacket/blazer.  It's made of shirt material and fits really small.  I ordered an x-large and it fits like a tight medium or a small.
2.0,Too small. Especially armpit holes. NOT cotton in any way shape or form. Seems to feel like a spandex polyester blend. Too warm.
2.0,Uncomfortable. Just an odd pair of underwear. I would not buy again.
2.0,I ordered these shoes four years ago for my daughter and absolutely loved them.  I ordered three pairs again last week for her and my younger daughter and the buckle is absurd on all three pairs.  How can a company sell shoes with buckles that don't physically close?  I think the good reviews here are from people who were lucky enough to get the correct buckle.  The rest of us must be getting a defect and the company doesn't care enough to fix them.  They are all going back.  I recommend avoiding this product.
2.0,Not if you have girls up top.
2.0,My son likes these but the lens are not clear as advertised in the description (although the photos do show the blue lens like the ones that I received)
2.0,"""wrap around"" skirts were quite the thing years ago and I loved the way they draped.  This skirt is very generous in length and would be be a significant tripping hazard for anyone shorter than 5'8"".  The material is bright,  medium weight and has a strange smell.  There is no elastic band and despite my best efforts cannot figure out how to thread the ties so that it fits...likely because it is too generous in terms of width.  Maybe I am just too dumb to manage the tying process but I think that it is made for someone with a larger waist than mine.  All in all, of no use to me."
2.0,It made my neck itchy and it turned black. Very cheap material. You get what you pay for. But it is cute.
2.0,"The pattern, color, fit, and length is all different from the image listed by the seller."
2.0,"Way too full of a skirt, not flattering."
2.0,"Cute colors but for as expensive as these are I guess I was expecting leather at least...waterproof/resistant..something to keep little feet  warm in the colder months, not canvas/cotton shoes. Returned."
2.0,"The necklace got to me fast, but broke before I could ever wear it. Kinda cheap material. Although it is cute."
2.0,It's cute but cheaply made and cut very small...Rainbow style.
2.0,"The positive: This top is made with a good feeling fabric.<br /><br />The negative: This top is sewn terrible. Bought the black and white stripe top and the lines are not matched up especially on the v of the neck, so off looking that I can’t wear it cause it looks so cheap. FAIL!"
2.0,Didn't like anything about them.
2.0,"These glasses were super cute and stylish. After about a month of wear, I noticed the “gold” on the nose pad come off. I have sensitive skin and had a reaction to the metal on the nose pad that lasted for over a week. I had to throw the glasses away."
2.0,"So, I was looking for something to give a sleeveless jumper a little structure so I could wear it to work. Was excited to get this in but... thank goodness for Prime! So, first of all, it was wadded up in the packaging which meant it was SUPER wrinkled. I tried to iron it, but the material didn't seem to care. Could no get the wrinkles out.  That actually turned out to be a good thing because it let me know I really didn't want to keep it. But here's the low down: super thin material - guessing polyester blend. The weird thing was the way it was sewn. The lines in the front sort of puckered out. Couldn't get them smooth and it was really unflattering. Also, it does run small. Keep that in mind if you make the mistake of ordering it."
2.0,I give this a two because it's so bulky
2.0,The shorts under the skirt are very wide.
2.0,"The fabric is synthetic, but it FEELS synthetic. It did not feel nice on my skin. Kind of scratchy. And it is LOW CUT. If you are going for dramatic cleavage—like”is my belly-button going to show because this plunged so low” cleavage—then this is for you. But also plan to buy some wardrobe tape then, because you may have a serious malfunction without it. I personally did not feel comfortable wearing it, as I felt it was more revealing than any of the bikinis I own. The only nice thing I can say for it is the red & white polka dot print is cute & cheerful. Cutest, cheerfulest way to have your boobs accidentally pop out in public."
2.0,This shirt is so short it should be labeled a crop top. The photo of the top is very misleading.  I'm 5'4 and 108 pounds and ordered the small.
2.0,"Beautiful colors and design. However, the material feels like old plastic tablecloths with that cotton lining. Also sizing runs small."
2.0,"These came with hair bows.......... But are labeled as a boy shirt.......  Two stars because they did fit, but I think my son might be wearing girl tank tops. Shhh."
2.0,not for us women with extra to love- definitely gr8 choice for skinny girls. but material is stiff and uncomfy
2.0,Blue pink orange and red. Not brown
2.0,Typically wear a medium but got a large because of reviews and it was huge. Exchanged for medium and still too big. Adjusted straps so looked great from front but then back was bulky and awkward.
2.0,It is comfy and fits well. Only thing is the black print on the shirt is not good can hardly if at all see Tom McDonald in the picture. That's the whole reason shirt was purchased
2.0,"Way to long, slip out of bra. If you cut them off make sure you stitch or they will ravel. Would not recommend."
2.0,Not really what I thought
2.0,"Love the style and price, but really run small. Don't like something is tight across my chest ."
2.0,The slit goes right up the front and the slip underneath barely is long enough to cover the butt. Returned. It don't buy however the teal dress they market is actually a wrap dress and much more flattering . This was not the same style at all.
2.0,"I bought this for my 12 year old daughter. She has worn it 2 days and the zipper is broken. She lives the fit, the comfort, etc…. Hoping it was just a defective zipper on this particular robe. Will be exchanging and will update if the second one lasts longer."
2.0,Too heavy and too stiff.
2.0,"Very nice looking purse but like all of the comments, it smells horrible and it gave me headache.  I kept it 5 days hoping for it to &#34;air out&#34; as others suggestd but no luck.  I sent it back."
2.0,"Item took forever to arrive, (I think maybe about a month).  It looks half decent, but it does have a ""pleather"" look to it, which can be a bit tacky. The size is not true to size. I ordered a small and it fits too large, and I'm not a super skinny person. I wear between a size 4-6.  It almost seems like the wrong size was definitely sent, and there is no size indicator anywhere on the skirt to even validate the size, or even to tell which side is the front or back. I tried to return under these circumstances & the company wants to make me pay return shipping even though there is no way to tell if the right size was even sent to me."
2.0,Product was short. Did not touch the floor. Overall happy with it besides the fact it is to short
2.0,Quality seemed okay but the sizing looked like children sizing. Could not even get it on
2.0,The little &#34;leather&#34; zipper strings broke on the first day. Cheap look and feel. And it's a tiny bag.
2.0,"They're ""okay,"" ....nothing more.  This set of socks are a step down from the previous purchases."
2.0,The pin itself is ok. Not really great quality but wearable. The issue is that there isn't a safety lock on the pin. Every single pin I have will lock when you put it on so you don't lose it. Not this one. The clasp is loose and turns easily. I won't be able to wear it without losing it.
2.0,"I usually really like Baleaf products but this was a very strange fit. The legs were fine but the waist was huge. I'm 5ft 4in, 117lbs, 32-26-38. I have to send it back."
2.0,It's a bit see through and pretty loose. It kinda feels like I have to wear a shirt underneath it or a sweater on top of it when I work out.
2.0,"I've worn compression socks for years to deal with vein issues in my legs & feet. I was looking for something a bit more colorful than my usual black socks so I went with the argyle pattern. I wear a size 13-14 shoe so ordered the XL size. I can't even get them over my heel so there's no way I could wear them. They also seem to be pretty bulky overall and the leg part has heavy texture on the inside that I think would be very uncomfortable, if I could get them on. I'm returning them and ordering my usual socks from a different vendor."
2.0,Not as cute as pictured.  Disappointed
2.0,It's how it is in the pic but the size is so off it was supposed to be a XL but fit like a medium
2.0,For the price of this purse the quality is not so great. It’s more of a $5 purse. It was a gift(and she didn’t want to return it) or else I would have returned it. The dear already fell off and the straps look ridiculous. I wanted to like this purse but it was just a waste of money.
2.0,"The large size is huge, neck, sleeves..."
2.0,Product doesn't stay on ears
2.0,Not what i expected chain is super thin and breaks very easily not happy with this product i order
2.0,"At around $2/pair, these are not exactly high quality socks.I do not anticipate them lasting a very long time, as they feel cheap. And they tend to gradually slip down my leg and bunch up. In hindsight, I probably should've saved my money and invested in a higher quality brand. Cool design but again the quality isn't there."
2.0,"Not at all like the pictures, the diamonds are sooooo tiny you need a magnifying glass to see them.  A waste of money!"
2.0,Top is a little to narrow and thinner than expected.
2.0,"I love how they look and feel, but there’s a strange wavy distortion especially when looking at the phone."
2.0,"very big - I was looking for a small, dainty one and this one was way bigger than I expected."
2.0,"Probably my own fault for potentially not ordering the right size, but this corset is just Too. Damn. Small. The purple is a good bit darker in person than the image leads you to believe which was a disappointment. Returned."
2.0,"I bought a similar designed top from another vendor here on Amazon in a different color and pattern.  This top cost way less, so I thought I was getting a bargain.  Not at all.  The fabric is so much thinner and cheaper, and the top is shorter.  It's just not at all cute, so I returned it.  It was worth spending more money from the other company."
2.0,These are very heavy and fall out
2.0,"Stone fell off one of the cuffs after one day of wearing. Looks nice, but cheap quality."
2.0,"Beautiful, too small"
2.0,This dress is cute however it had been previously worn by someone else before it was shipped to me🙄 makeup was all over the neck line
2.0,My measurements fit within the 2XL range but it's way too tight. The legs are super slender and the inseam is too short for me. I wish it would have fit because I like it otherwise.
2.0,I usually wear a L-XL. I decided to order a 2X but it’s still barely wearable. A 2X is more like a medium to large. I’m going to wash it and hopefully it doesn’t shrink.
2.0,I so wanted to like this product. I am SO disappointed. I bought the black & brown. Color is nothing like the picture. There is no white in the product. Its a black and brown blob. More white would have delineated the colors .  It's  going back
2.0,"Not breathable, fogs, and holds condensation/droplets."
2.0,I'm not sure if these are larger than normal or if my nose is just small but the portion of the retainer that sits in the septum piercing is much larger than it needs to be and is uncomfortable. The retainer doesn't stay upright in the nose so it will shift downward and show. I use my retainer for work purposes so it showing is a problem for me. All in all this retainer is too large and uncomfortable for me.
2.0,"Nice looking watch, does what it’s supposed to do, but you get what you pay for. After three months one of the buttons disappeared. No idea what happened to it; one day I looked down and it was just gone. I’ve never had that happen before on any watch I’ve owned. Obviously, this compromises its functionality and water resistance. Very disappointing."
2.0,"I had high hopes for this but it looks like a puffy blazer!!!. With plastic white buttons now granted they do not show but its cheap.. The way it feels is nice but that's all I got ant XL and it was short on the arms I usually wear a size 14 jeans bust width is 44inch and I wasn't comfortable wearing this,<br />taking this back"
2.0,length was shorter then expected....but fit...
2.0,"Material is so cheap and thin, feels like wearing a paper bag. Arms on the top are so tight, as if designed for children."
2.0,The front of the dress is about an inch or so longer than the back. What were they thinking? It's supposed to be the other way around. Now my butt is going to be hanging out everywhere I go. It'll work as a house dress or something.
2.0,Ordered the largest size but still a full size too small for size 9.5 ft
2.0,purchased for my daughter and have been trying to get her to return them...she loves the look so is trying to have them stretched out...I don't think that is going to work. I would say they run a whole size smaller than stated.
2.0,Her toes are already at the end and ai bought the next size up for her. The next soze isn't available and she loves them. I don't have the heart to return them.
2.0,Tiny and cheap
2.0,I bought a medium after checking the sizing chart. It was way too large and made for a larger chest size.
2.0,cool looking----so cheaply made they lasted only two weeks.
2.0,"The kit looks beautiful, but after the 2nd ride 1 of the horns broke off. ...."
2.0,"I have this Pielino crossbody wallet in black and it is perfect - I love it.  I finally decided to order it in camel and was extremely disappointed.  They have changed the design so it does not look like the picture.  It is narrower. My phone is snug in the camel design. Also, the quality is not the same. The zipper is not smooth and the interior card slots were sewn in sloppily causing the zipper to catch on it in one corner.  I sadly returned it."
2.0,"Very small (only comes down to about my belly button) and very cheap. You can see right through it.  I bought it as a cheap tank to wear over my swim suit. It is good for that purpose, but never with a bra."
2.0,"The gems are cloudy and not faceted.  The necklace is pretty, but seems cheaper than it could, simply because of that."
2.0,I disliked the delivery method. It was balled up in a small bag and is now very wrinkled. My husband loves it even though it's a little tight in the arms. I will reorder and hopefully they will package it better.
2.0,Definitely not flattering at all on busty girls.
2.0,I ordered the right size but it fits smaller. I can't wear it
2.0,Lots of loose strings/thread. Trimmed them up because they are being gifted. Really hope they don't fall apart.
2.0,"It feels nice, but the L size that I bought is way too small."
2.0,Really cute but fell apart very easily.
2.0,Material too slick. I miss the old leotards and the material they were made of.
2.0,Fit size is way off.
2.0,These run small and are kind of short. Order a larger size if you want a good fit.
2.0,cap unraveled after first wash.  Followed washing directions :(
2.0,"The watch was very nice, my wife love it. The problem we got was that at the fourth time she wear it, the butterfly felt off, of course we don't know when and where with no chance to recover it."
2.0,I am 5'7 130 lbs and fit. The sweater it self is great. The sleeve are made for children. WAY TOO TIGHT!
2.0,Exactly how pictured. Not sure if the sizes actually match the correct size. They seem off quite a bit.
2.0,"The chain was too thin, it broke after having it for a couple weeks"
2.0,Needed to order two sizes up...
2.0,"Not great quality, but I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,"Too small. Go a size up, if you can."
2.0,"They’re ridiculous. Like your foot is wearing a whole car. My foot fits in the footbed, they’re just a stupid design and terribly made. Almost twice as big as other sandals. There is a lot of ‘bumper’ around your foot and a big gap in the upper. I’ll keep them for pool/ river shoes but you’re not going to make a fashion statement, I promise."
2.0,"I gave this as a gift to my daughter in law, and within 2 weeks it had snapped in half.  Needless to say I am very disappointed."
2.0,Mine stopped working  out after a few weeks :(
2.0,Cheaply made the buttons are coming off  and the adjustable waist things broke off. This was 1st wear of the outfit🖓down on this one.
2.0,"These do not fit as expected, way too big.  They also have no support whatsoever."
2.0,Not even remotely the color shown. It almost looks dirty instead of pink
2.0,The shipping was fast and the hat was well packaged.  The hat is sturdy and decently made for the price although when I took the hat out of the box it had a big wrinkle down the front  and the ribbon was crooked and wrinkly. If I hadn’t needed it right away I would have returned it.
2.0,looks more substantial in the picture
2.0,"While the fabric and camisoles do not necessarily disappoint, they came oddly packaged with all the tags cut out."
2.0,"Not impressed, for the following reasons: 1) I wear 11 or 11.5.  I bought these in 11, and they feel like I'm stepping into a rowboat.  At least a size too big, and way too wide.  If I were to order them again, I'd go with a full size smaller.  But I won't, because 2) they feel hard and unpleasant inside.  I was looking for something that might replace my Merrell clogs, but with a higher profile to keep deeper snow out.  These just don't fit that bill."
2.0,Large is half the size.
2.0,Too big.. 2 size at least
2.0,Cheap-feeling and not well made. As soon as I put them on the leather felt like it was stretching; now my little toe sticks out the side. These are worth about $10.
2.0,Pretty. Had to give away because of being to large
2.0,"Granted, there weren't many reviews when I bought this. But my 10 yo daughter needed a black short-sleeved leotard for a play that she'll probably never wear again and I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a better brand. But. If I were buying this for regular wear to dance class, I'd be incredibly disappointed. The tag says 88% brushed cotton. I assure you, there is not even 1 scant percent cotton. It is pure, cheap spandex. And the sizing description was so weird and made absolutely no sense, so I decided to take a gamble and get the XXL for my daughter who wears a 10-12. Glad I did, because it fits. Oddly, bit it fits. But back to the fabric. This is cheap swimsuit material with puckered edge seams. Thankfully, the front is lined with a nicer, softer material, because it's thin enough to be see-through. And the puckered edges make everything bag oddly, especially the crotch and necklines. So, it'll be okay for my needs. Still a waste of money, but it would have been regardless for me. If you want something for more regular wear spend an extra $5-10 for the real brands."
2.0,"Picture shows jacket is fitted at waist, but it is not.  fITS VERY BOXY"
2.0,"Too flimsy, just a big ol' bunch of chiffon with no shape to it."
2.0,Pretty shirt but sadly I'll never wear it as. Bought a 3x fits like a large.
2.0,"Looks nice and well made, but way too big and wide for my taste. Read all the details first especially the sizes before buying."
2.0,"These guys have the right idea, but the execution is poor. XL was way too small, and the 1X was comically too large. The XL at least seemed to be sewn correctly- the 1X had a weirdly bunched-up crotch, and just did not sit right- the front of the skirt hung very low, and the back of the skirt hung above the shorts. At least the material was much nicer than the other version of this skirt/short combo that I also tried (and sent back). I did very much like the waistband on this one, much better than the other version I tried. I'd be very excited to have something like this for the gauzier, more see-through dresses that are ubiquitous these days, but I guess I'll have to wait until someone can do it right."
2.0,"These aren't terribly expensive and  they are pretty,  so they 1 star for each of those qualities.  The ear loops are very awkwardly placed, tiny scraps of elastic that are WAY too small for an adult.  The fabric is polyester and barely breathable, so when you breath in it sticks to your nose/mouth and makes you feel like you're going to suffocate."
2.0,nice look but way too small. If you want it then order 2 sizes above what you think
2.0,"These earrings are just as pretty when they arrive, however the posts are sooo much bigger then your pierced ear hole to the point they are extremely uncomfortable, even painful, to wear - to the point that they cannot be worn.  Such as shame, maybe the company could shave down or create thinner posts to be worn . . . ."
2.0,"I’m 5’5”, 145 pounds. The medium fit perfectly before washing. Afterwards it’s unwearable. Will have to give it away."
2.0,A lot of white spots on it.
2.0,Not flexible and i only got 12! They fit tight which is good but I could only get 3 on! They turn quick it hasn't been 2hrs since I put one in and it turned. You can smell the material when it turns. The others are in my ears.
2.0,It was way too small. Maybe when I loose a bit of weight I could fit into it. I forgot I ordered it because it too a while to get to me but that ok.
2.0,"First impression:  these cord necklaces are very nice.  On closer look, you will see jump rings that are not closed neatly (see picture).  They are not easy to fix because the metal is very stiff."
2.0,This product is cheap and flimsy.
2.0,They are really cute but extremely small. The 1st picture is inside of a regular sized water bottle cap. Good size for eyebrow piercings.
2.0,The mask is ok - the elastic is too short for me.  I will fix it but recommend you pick a different mask
2.0,"Jacket was very nice, but material was really thin. Not what I was looking for."
2.0,"Ok! Small, fitted more than loose tee."
2.0,"Great looking shoes, but that's about it.  They are uncomfortably tight, not on the toe area, but where you lace them up.  Had to return them."
2.0,"After you take the lenses off to change, they never stay on when replaced."
2.0,"I tried something out of my comfort zone and it was a fail.  Do not buy this if you are large chested. uniboob was in full effect. Not only that, I have a moderately muscular build... if you have a dainty body, this would work.<br />I felt like I looked like a man in a dress."
2.0,The ears are too close together. I had to remove them and move them apart. The tail has no real way to be attached to the pants other than a loop.
2.0,"way too small, but its pretty!"
2.0,These look like they're made out of rubber and give me a scary camel toe.
2.0,"The amulet is what  I expected. It is very nice. What I did find disappointing was that the bar code sticker was over the meaning of the amulet. In trying to remove ,this was to be a gift, some of the lettering came off with the sticker. The back of the card is empty, maybe you can put it there. will be looking for one where the meaning can be read."
2.0,About a half size smaller than expected.  I’m 5’5 and 140
2.0,"Such a cute print, and I love the pattern! I wear a 16, and have average breasts, but the triangles didnt provide ample coverage, even if i could have comfortably fit the strap around. I,  seriously, was spilling out the middle and sharing an abundant amount of side boob! I bought the 16-18 and sadly have had to return it for a refund. It might have been a 12 in reality, with A size cups.  Really wish vendors would realize how their incorrect sizing affects women emotionally!"
2.0,"I don't like the material at all. I followed the size chart precisely, ordered a size up, and it was still tight across my bosom. I don't recommend."
2.0,"Definitely not the cognac color like in the picture. It's taupe so if you're looking for a deeper tan color this is not as advertised. Design is nice, shipping was fast and quality seems good. I need to return it though because it's not the color I wanted."
2.0,Gemstone was cracked. Not really pleased with item.
2.0,"I did not hate this boot. I just did not like it at all. I am fit. Muscular. My legs are nice. At 110 lbs these boots would not stay up on my legs, so lets just say that if you have some meat on your bones...go for this boot. If you have strong muscular lets in any way DO NOT expect these boots to just stay up there. I was too embarrassed to take a photo in these droopy socks. Gave them to my co-worker."
2.0,Tears easily. This was my 3rd attempt trying to put a glove on and they kept ripping. Poor quality. I paid extra for these because of the picture of them standing up to sharp objects. When I did a puncture test w a pen it easily went thru with little pressure. Im very dissatisfied.
2.0,The fabric bleed all over in the wash.
2.0,Adorable but the polka dots don’t line up at all making the dress look cheap. However I reversed the dress and put a lite jacket on. The back of the dress is seamless.
2.0,warning product is so thin you can see right through it. made for show not for warmth.  not what i wanted
2.0,After 1 day the pendant detached from the necklace - very disappointing
2.0,Very cute and as pictured but more silky than woven texture. Also biggest issue is that the arms are very tight and feels like I’d rip them if I reach. I’m typically a medium and even smaller bc I had a double masectomy. So thought I’d be great w a medium but the arms are just sewn so tight and seem out of proportion. Will try a size up bc it’s cute but how the overall frame won’t be so big and like a tent.
2.0,"The cactus color is just lovely, it was easy to install and fit well and I have a small wrist.  I didn’t wear the band until about 2 weeks after I purchased it and after a few days my wrist broke out in a rash where the metal part touches.  I waited a week after the rash was completely gone and thought if I covered the metal piece I could wear it.  NOPE!!  The same rash popped up after only one day.  I do not have sensitive skin, wasn’t wearing any lotions and I have purchased other (off brand) bands at other retailers and have not had this problem.  Unfortunately, I missed the window to return otherwise I would have sent it back."
2.0,Skiet seemed like good material but was absolutely tiny. I order the small for my  5 year old it didn't even fit my two year old.
2.0,"The matte texture of the frame material feels very uncomfortable against the skin. The frames overall seem chintzy and not of the quality I have come to expect from Smith Optics and other Safilo products.<br />The mirrored lenses were nice but photos do not accurately display how highly reflective the mirror polish on these lenses are. If you touch your face frequently or do any tasks that splatter or splash while wearing your sunglasses, these are probably not right for you."
2.0,"I bought these based on several reviews. By no means am I a big person - I'm slender and my calves are unremarkable. I bought the size I would normally buy for compression stockings. Sadly, these are soooo tight especially around the top, that I am unable to wear them. They cut into my skin. Buyer beware!"
2.0,"It was pretty, when it arrived.  It changed colors quickly."
2.0,Design and printing was too notch. Fits much more like an XL than XXXL
2.0,"Fabric felt ok. Sizing was very small for what is listed. Sent it back. If you're a bigger guy, don't go with these short trunks. I'm 6'1&#34; and have pretty thick thighs, these were very cutting on my legs."
2.0,The lettering is to small.  Looks larger on the website and can hardly read the words.  It was not worth sending the item back.
2.0,Way too tight. I got my normal size (as suggested by the reviews) and they don’t fit. Extremely disappointed especially for how long I waited to receive these.
2.0,"Not what I expected. It was more like a boat neck sweater, not off the shoulder.  I ordered the apricot and I'm not sure if I mistakenly received beige, or if the apricot is more like a beige.  Returned it."
2.0,Low quality. I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,"Washed on gentle,cold cycle  before my kids need wear them for school school.  Threading ripped out of seam before they had opportunity to wear. Really bummed"
2.0,Cut for a skinny body🥺
2.0,I was super excited about receiving these shades. The ones I received still are not terrible quality but definitely not what I payed for.
2.0,"Cute but one of the earrings is missing the hook for your ear rendering this set TOTALLY USELESS. Luckily I have a jewelry fix it kit so I should be able to salvage it (hence the 2 stars). But unless you have a repair kit sitting around, I wouldn’t suggest this."
2.0,"I didn't even open the package, because while the label on the scarf I received said &#34;beige,&#34; and the website says &#34;beige,&#34; the picture of the beige scarf is not accurate. It looked grey on the website. I just figured it was the wrong label name but that the scarf I received would be the actual color of the picture of the scarf that I purchased, regardless of whoever thought that the &#34;greige&#34; was more &#34;beige.&#34; The color of scarf I received was actually camel. Way off. I returned."
2.0,"It says US size XS. When I got them the tag says US XS 27. 27 is medium, xsmall is 23 or 24. I need 23 or 24."
2.0,Not excerise quality
2.0,"I kind of knew that I was taking a gamble going into this order. I have an XL Diesel watch that doesn't fit the normal watch repair kit equipment sold on here. Thought I'd give this a try and sure enough, it did not work."
2.0,Terrible material for face. It’s burlap. Thick and scratchy.  :/
2.0,These run really small and shrink more on washing.  Also always haveng to pull them up.
2.0,Hangs strange. Bulky.
2.0,It's advertised for cartilage but honestly they are way too big and looked ridiculous. I sent them back.
2.0,Was way too big for a child.  I would classify it as an adult sized watch. The watch band broke on first day of normal use.
2.0,The shirt itself is pretty. I wear a 3x in everything so I bought a 3x as it says it’s true to size.  The tag says 3x but I couldn’t even begin to put it on. Definitely not true to size at all. I suggest sizing up.
2.0,They are very small but very comfortable if the are biger will be great.
2.0,I think it would be comfy but it was extremely too small. I'm a 22/24 and I ordered 3xl it was maybe a large.
2.0,"way too small, buy like three sizes up"
2.0,Tear apart after 2-3 months of wearing. Cheap buckle.
2.0,White lettering was lighter than image.
2.0,"I bought this to match the necklace and earrings, but it is NOT the same gold? its much lighter. Looks NOTHING like the gold in the photo."
2.0,Love the design - but clasp broke on first day of wearing!
2.0,"This dress would be adorable BUT the bust line started BELOW my chest! If I pull it up over my chest, even leaving quite a bit of cleavage (and I am small busted), the back sags a good 5 inches from my body, hanging down. Everywhere else, the dress is gorgeous and fits perfectly! So disappointed bc I'd love to wear it. But it's just not possible. It's like 5 inches of fabric was left off the front."
2.0,If you are bigger busted this may not be for you. The empire waist line on this hits me about mid-boob. The cut is also not very flattering. I look like I'm wearing an old lady nightgown.
2.0,"I ordered a 2xl when I typically wear an xl in pants. They were still too fitted and I felt that I would rip through them. They are stretchy, but the material feels a bit like the material of a tent. Unless the waist of the pants is much too large for you, it will not look like the image. I did decide to return them"
2.0,The color of frames was not as pictured....looks more like a tan color.
2.0,The sizes are not correct
2.0,I purchased 120 pairs of hats and gloves to donate to an local elementary school.  These gloves are toddler sized and of very poor quality.  The stitching was loose and unraveling.  The gloves were already piling.  There were strings of other colors woven in the gloves.  I was embarrassed by the quality.  I do NOT recommend.
2.0,"Rough seams, very thin, droopy accents. I should have known better"
2.0,"I ordered up (XL) & they wouldn’t even go past my waist. Bummer, they were super cute style and cute!"
2.0,"Not painted well, dots not complete"
2.0,"I got both a black and a brown pair of these because it looked like a great deal, and I ended up returning them. They must run small - I'm usually an 11 and that's what I ordered, but these fit more like a narrow 10. The part that runs up the leg I found to be very narrow/tight, so if you have athletic/large calves, they might not work for you. And they aren't super high quality, more on the flimsy side. They might last a season if you're careful, but you're definitely only getting what you pay for."
2.0,"Overall it’s not a “bad” watch, per say. I always wanted a watch with the sun/moon phase, but unfortunately that function broke immediately after it’s first wind! Mine in particular, ran about 75 seconds fast a day. However I do have some experience with these, and after a small tweak, I have it running more like 10 seconds slow a day. Not the worst considering the price point, just wish it would be fully functioning. I may end up returning it."
2.0,It was smaller than expected. Stretchy but the more give the less flattering.
2.0,Bought this is size Large which is my usual dress size . Turns out it was too small . Had to buy XXL to get a good fit.  Dress also came with soils as if it was already worn .
2.0,"They're ok for walking around use, but with the filter installed they don't wrap around the nose. Also the filters are a little larger than the pocket so they don't fit flat. But even without the filter, they won't stay around the face skiing on a 10 year old girl while skiing. I just don't know why manufacturers are making these things as large as they are. They're very stretchy and could be a couple inches smaller for a snug fit. As it is they stretch out and are basically loose."
2.0,"Love the color. I like that it can be a wristlet or a cross body bag. The tassels are kinda goofy for my taste, but some might like it. Other than the pretty color, none of this is enough to make me want to use it, not even for temporary use due to the reasons I will mention next.  (I have another bag from this company and it is worlds apart in looks, quality, and functionality-- so maybe this is just a dud, for me.)<br /><br />Now as for the aspect of it that makes me refrain from using it further is of real concern. See, the main  area which is the spot for cash, credit cards, ID, etc is really not secure. That area is open on three sides! There is a snap closure- that's it. Gravity may help keep things in place, but that doesn't make me comfortable using it. The other storage area is one that could be used for anything, but I assume most people would want to use for their phone so I will refer to it as such. I do not benefit from using the this pocket since my Google Pixel 3XL doesn't come anywhere close to fitting it. Even if it did, the snap closure doesn't feel too secure. You have to really press on it for it to snap. I wouldn't want to put that much pressure against my phone screen. The third and final storage spot is useful but almost too small. Maybe ok for a few bills or coins. Not much beyond that.<br /><br />So because I pretty much can't actually use it, I deem this is a pass for me"
2.0,"Worn twice, washed and dried. Pulling in the front."
2.0,"It's not nearly large enough to stay in place. The strong elastic ensures that the band continuously compresses together. On smooth Asian hair like mine, the band makes the hair in the back flip upwards, eventually leaving me looking like a troll. Wish I could return them but I've used 5 for workouts already."
2.0,Very small<br />Good for toddlers.
2.0,"I've had it about a week or so, as stated in previous reviews my fitbit has popped out of it. I don't wear it anymore, I'm afraid to lose my fitbit. It's too bad because I really liked the band maybe they will somehow fix that problem."
2.0,"I loved it at first, and it seemed to be able to hold up to daily wearing.  However, after only a week of wearing it the pin that holds the band on fell out.  So, not awesome."
2.0,"First off, one of the cases was broken, inside the packaging.<br />Not a fan of the reflection, looks like a fireworks show, if a lot of traffic! Wouldn’t buy again or recommend, I going to try to return!"
2.0,Didn’t like the material. Cotten is best for small Children. The polyester snags easy .
2.0,Zipper broke after only a couple uses
2.0,It’s not as thick as the ultra bands.. I wouldn’t buy again.
2.0,"The dress was a little large for my petite 3yrs old.  After a couple of wash, the seams holding the orange skirt to the black tank started to come out. We did get a lot of good comments on the dress at the Apple orchard."
2.0,"I was very disappointed in the size. I ordered the size I always wear but to my surprise, the skort was way too tight. It was so tight, I checked to see if there was a mixup with the size I ordered. No mixup. I would say the size was at least 2 sizes too small. I returned it."
2.0,Too small. Not big enough to really see features
2.0,Definitely not meant for women who are C cup. Super tight in boob area which makes the dress uncomfortable.
2.0,I don't like the riviets in the belt they popped out in a matter of days.
2.0,"this is a good sturdy chain and holds my pendants well. UPDATE: 2 stars because it lost it's shine. ?  it looks terrible now.  ... :(  ... the rhodium is wearing off quicker than i had hoped. it looks cheap and ugly now, ... fast shipping. the chain is sturdy, that's it. I'm really unhappy now."
2.0,When I received it it had a lot more wrinkles than I could get out of it because of the way it was packaged the neck wrap was too small and it had been a better time when I would’ve sent it back not worth the money
2.0,Item i received broken.<br />:(
2.0,I loved this dress. I have it in 3 colors. It is so comfy and flattering. But I washed this one once and there is a huge hole in it. Makes me sad.
2.0,Fit was very short and I’m short 5’1. It would look nice in winter with boots or leggings but just not my cup of tea for a dress
2.0,"I have ordered  dresses that look and are described exactly the same from another company.  They fit fine.<br />I have large hips and thighs is why I only order dresses or skirts or coats that are described as ""swing"".<br />I ordered this dress from this company as my husband likes poke-a-dots.  This is so tight that it would not even go over my body if it were not stretchy.  However, even with the so-called ""swing skirt"" it is terribly tight around my bottom and thighs.  I am having to return this dress."
2.0,Sadly these pants did not work well for my husband. He is 5’6 and the size 30 pants were way too long for him. The thigh portion of the pants was also very loose and baggy. We’ll be sending them back and would not recommend for smaller men.
2.0,"Not flattering, at all. I returned."
2.0,it just wasn't what I expected. Too think and the butterflies on the sides are too large and look cheap.
2.0,"They came. There were to correct amount and color. The price is right, BUT... they keep sliding OFF the arms. Even if you tighten them almost to the point of snapping the rubber circle off/splitting the rubber circle in half.  They keep loosening back up and then the glasses fall right out of them.<br />The search continues."
2.0,Band last for less than 6 mos. Band is not shipped with new pins. Pins must be purchased separately if needed.<br />I would not purchase this band except that it is the only band that I have found availabe for the Casio sgw-100 watch.
2.0,THE OUTFIT LOOKED OK BUT IT DIDN'T COMPLIMENT ME. .
2.0,This dress was not what it looked like online.  IT was not flattering at all.
2.0,I wonder if I even received the same item. It looks so different than what’s pictured on the model. Mine looks more like a regular cardigan. I returned it.
2.0,"The leather material from the pin side tore when placing this inside the watch. This was not a nice experience to utilize and I took it off because I noticed the pin metal bent a little more after placing this in. I was more concerned that it will fall off and crack the unit if I walked around with it.<br /><br />I loved the look of the material, however, this cannot be taken into consideration to use due to how easy it was fragile."
2.0,They must run small! A little short for my big foot!!!
2.0,the pieces don’t fit to work together<br /><br />So enjoy the images but I am still requesting a refund…………<br /><br />Refund granted so in the end satisfied
2.0,"Too small, by like 2 sizes. I went by their size guide and ordered up. I’m a ladies medium so I ordered a large. Not happening. It was well above my waist and the sleeves were high water too. Unfortunate, really because I like open back shirts and this design. Oh well."
2.0,Nice but gets lint balls easily and can not be worn with light colors it leaves red threads all over
2.0,Was cute way to small though
2.0,Super thin fabric. Seen through...shows all the body imperfections.
2.0,Looks nothing like picture; too large!<br />Extremely warm although sleeveless!
2.0,thought it came with wallet and it’s just the land yard. it’s cute as hell tho
2.0,"I received the case yesterday. it did come very quickly, however it is just so large. You could probably fit a windshield in the case. Okay I am joking, but you could fit at least four pairs of glasses in the case. The case is well made, no funky smell and it has a nice feel to it. I will probably keep it just because returning it will cost me more money than to just keep it. One other thing I didn't like was the case was not wrapped in any way to protect it. It came in a mail pouch with just the label on it. I think the seller could have at least put a layer of bubble wrap around it."
2.0,Only water resistant. Once they are wet for a few minutes water begins to come through.  Definitely wouldn't want them for a whole day of skiing or playing in the snow.
2.0,The quality is much less than I expected. This are more like fuzzy socks rather than house slippers.  There isn't a sturdy sole.
2.0,"Way too large, returned it."
2.0,Not as shown in photo . Simple t shirt boxy. Color not as shown. Clings. Returning.
2.0,These looked nice when they arrived but expect tears from your daughter when pendants fall off the chain and are lost on the first day (and the second one 1 week later).  Now we have 2 cheap chains without any pendants.  This should be an easy fix if the company put better bracket loops on them.
2.0,Too wide for her average sized face and very transparent.
2.0,The center of the bridge is the weakest point on these glasses. I loved the colour of the frames and the tint of the lenses but the quality is just too poor to advice buying this.
2.0,"Cute, but very poor quality, made cheap."
2.0,Runs very small. My daughter wears 8's. Most 8's are still big on her. I purchased the 8-10. The shirt is really short. I'm returning. Sad because they're cute.
2.0,Material very thin a mens size to small very simple shirts.
2.0,The white stripes feel like painted plastic. I washed the shirt once and there is a hole in the fabric already.
2.0,Too big..could fit two of me into a medium
2.0,Way over priced for the quality of this mask - used white thread on blank material ? Would not recommend - sadly it was a gift now I need to re-order - I can get better home crafted mask for $6
2.0,"Buyers beware!  If your looking for a &#34;pink&#34; coral this is not the tie for you and definitely not the color pictured.  This tie is a very &#34;orange&#34; coral, more of a tangerine."
2.0,I did try this on and I loved how it looked the material is thin and a wide belt would have set the look off but it runs too small across the shoulder area and although I did order a size larger than I normally would wear it still happened so I sent it right back within just minutes of receiving it. (5'7/135/34C)
2.0,Posts came bent and the quality is not the best.
2.0,"Quality bad.  The silver clip is bad, cheap material.  The flower is not translucent, not blink at all."
2.0,"Giving it a 2 because the broken top zipper prevents the entire bag, otherwise well-made, from being used. Very disappointed. Going to have to retire it and look for another."
2.0,Much smaller as it is shown on the picture.
2.0,It will not keep the time you have to change it every day a little annoyed with it
2.0,There were 2 holes.  1 in the pocket and 1 in a seam near the shoulder.  I like the dress itself but was poorly made.
2.0,Looks nothing like the picture... you can barely read the words on either necklace
2.0,I received the product within a timely manner.  However product runs smaller then actual size.  I have worn the shirt only a few time ( washing in cold water hanging to dry).  After washing it a few times the lettering began pealing off the shirt.  I am very disappointed in the quality of the shirt.
2.0,"Again, way too large. You could tell that some of these jeans had been tailored somehow so these skinny models would actually look like they were wearing jeans that fit but it only emphasized how big the jeans were. Obviously, these jeans weren't for me!"
2.0,"I bought this shirt for my wife in the 'XX-Large' size.  It proved to be MUCH smaller than other women's tops in her wardrobe which were size '2XL'.  We were both disappointed, as this was an otherwise acceptable shirt, which is the only reason that I am giving it two stars instead of just one."
2.0,I would love to give a good review but I can’t even put them on the chemical smell is so strong. I have washed them at least five times and the smell even rubs off on my other clothes! Ugh 😑
2.0,It's a nice watch but after a couple times of wearing it the rubber started to tear
2.0,"I was searching for a silk mask. This said 100% silk in the description. So I ordered it.<br />It arrived and while it is soft and silky, it doesn’t feel like silk, and has way more stretch than I would expect for 100% silk.<br />The mask doesn’t have a label in it but did come with an insert listing fabric content and instructions.<br />It lists the material as:<br />Main material: exterior-96%polyester, 4%spandex. Lining: 100-%cotton.<br />I pulled up the item on amazon to make sure that I hadn’t made a mistake, but the product description says 100% silk.<br />I started scrolling through the photos though and saw where it says 100% double mercerized cotton on one of the photos.<br />This mask is not made of silk. It is not made of cotton.<br />I can’t tell if there’s a cotton lining inside or not without taking it apart. Both the front and back side of the mask seem to be the same stretchy material.<br />Overall, it seems a decent mask. Construction is okay, except for the loose string that seems to be coming from a seam inside. But pulling the string doesn’t pull the mask apart.<br /><br />Overall.....<br />I will keep it. Returns are such a hassle. I may use it as a cover for one of those disposable masks, or keep it in my car for emergencies. Or even sew some beads and trim on it and use it as a decorative cover for my other masks."
2.0,This color is not cream or off white. It is a yellowish color that really doesn’t go with anything. The material is polyester and the sleeves are wide at the wrist. This is not the first clothing item I have gotten from Amazon with this issue so I don’t know if it is a new fashion trend or what. The fit of this was just not flattering.
2.0,Cute but wanted in lined bifocal did not arrive that way disappointed
2.0,I ordered these for my grandmother but the 2XL looked more like a large or XL.
2.0,"Rated a 5 for quality & appearance; however, fit runs small. I usually wear a 2XL. After reading the reviews I ordered a 2XLT. I almost can't button it & it hangs just below my waist. Next time I would order a 4XLT if it was available.<br /><br />20 Sep 15: Ordered & received a 3XLT. This shirt is even smaller than the 2XLT that I just returned!  Very inconsistent manufacturing.  Changing my grade to 2 stars."
2.0,"I thought this was a cool idea - and better than throwing all my cords/chargers in an old bag.  However, I find it somewhat awkward to stuff things in and don't always guess the right size band to fit around a specific charger, taking more time packing than I like to take.  think I'm going back to the old system!"
2.0,"Marks skin if wear for prolonged hrs. It looks like you have celulites 😅<br />Delivered as described. If you wear size small, order medium, they run x-small"
2.0,too large and the material was too heavy
2.0,I wouldn’t call these compression.
2.0,"This shoe for being a Coach and for  the price. It was a  very disappointing for a Coach product. The quality and fit was not there. And, the shoe seem to had been wore."
2.0,Not made for bigger girls
2.0,This material was just weird...it felt like cheesecloth! But it *looked* fine. I did order my normal size and it was waay too small...another donation to my tiniest sister and she loves it (except the strange feel!).
2.0,Might as well be a t-shirt... not very thick
2.0,"Should have looked at the charms more closely when purchasing. Some of them like Leo, Taurus, and Sagittarius  are either misspelled, or in a different language. The rest are super cute, but I’m kind of bummed because I was especially looking for the Taurus and Leo charms."
2.0,"Cute top, but the white was completely see through. I returned."
2.0,"Received the shirt and I would return, but not worth the time. The cotton material is stiff and sort of itchy. The skull face is huge!  Wish it was a little smaller. It almost looks like a gawdy Ed Hardy shirt.  The color is a lighter gray than I expected. I will not wear this out, just inside the house. Will keep looking for a good Misfits shirt. I do not recommend buying this shirt."
2.0,"Looks good on the model in the photo. On me, not so much. You should probably have boobs for this to look flattering on you."
2.0,"Bought this for a graduation. Disappointed as this dress was big. Everywhere. I am 4,11 and 115 lbs. measure 36, 25, 39 and the arm holes showed my strapless bra (too big), it did not sit on my hips (slightly below). I suppose this is meant for taller gals or someone bigger than me, but I bought a small and this was the smallest available."
2.0,"This was the second set I purchased because the first fell apart. The second set lasted an hour before my son was able to pull the bow tie apart. It was very cute, but poor quality."
2.0,I love the animal printI and the two piece design because the masks with other types of ear loops are either too small or the loops hurt the backs of my ears. I am an average size woman with an average size head and this mask is way too big. The material is not the type that will shrink. I already washed it so I can’t return it.
2.0,"Boy, ad was right when it said for tall women, pay attention to that comment.  I also purchased one size smaller than I wear since the ad said that also, but should have purchased two sizes smaller.  It fits like a loose sack on me.  Of course it doesn't look near as nice as it does on the skinny model in the picture.  I weight 130 and am 5'7&#34;  and bought a large for your reference."
2.0,"The stone is a really pretty shade of green but I pretty much trashed the whole thing when I tried to rebend the post to make it shorter.<br />Then I had to cut the post end, twice, to make it halfway workable. However, after cutting, it was sharp and I had a tough time getting it in my nose.  But I did and I’m sure not going to take it out for a long time.  I made it fit right, but what a pain in the butt."
2.0,Turned and tarnished
2.0,"These shoes seemed great, my 4 year old loved them. 1 month later the lights malfunctioned, and I had to cut some of the wires so they would not be on all the time... one month after that... two months total... they have completely fallen apart, have holes in the toe area and the velcro straps are almost worn through. So I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,Idk why these have such good reviews?! They’re literally curved so much that the cuter top part just hangs downward. Hard to explain… but pretty disappointing. Would not recommend to anyoneeeeeee
2.0,"I purchased this ahead of Christmas so my wife could give it to me for a Christmas present. I didn't start using it until last month (February). As soon as I started using it, I found the main flap buckle wouldn't stay fastened and it comes lose all the time. I've already passed the return date so there isn't much I can do except sew the buckle closed perhaps, but then it makes it a bit challenging to put larger things inside the main pockets. I like the quality and design of the product, the zipper pockets are great and the main open pocket is useful. However, the main flap needs to stay closed to make sure nothing falls out of the main open pocket and it keeps coming lose with a minor touch."
2.0,Xxl fit more like a large
2.0,Pattern is not like photo.
2.0,"This is a very pretty earring, however, you can't see the opal on mine at all. And it's supposed to be an OPAL flower. Opal being a pretty important part. I'll add pictures shortly. Check the reviews, I didn't before I bought it, but you can see that this company clearly changed sizes of earrings but don't represent that in their pictures."
2.0,If you are human and male get XL. I got the large and it wouldn’t fit my 12 yr old kid.
2.0,I purchased this dress after I purchased another color and loved it. This army green color is a completely different fabric than the other one. This one has no stretch and very flimsy. It doesn’t suck you in like the other dress. I wish this color was made in the other fabric coz that one was fabulous!
2.0,Love this watch BUT it tarnished so bad I can't wear it anymore. Lasted about a year.
2.0,"This is a cute dress, but unfortunately it is NOT red!  It is more of a dark orange color."
2.0,"I feel a little guilty complaining about this dress since it’s so inexpensive (less than $10), but the quality matches the cheap price.  It’s literally an extra long tank top.  Thin cheap material with no structure or definition.  It also runs really small, or they sent me the wrong size... I ordered the large.  Even at less than $10 I had to return it."
2.0,Cheap material. Shrunk 50% in length after first wash. I don't recommend.
2.0,"For the price, I thought they were fine.  Not sure how well made these shoes are.  On both shoes the insoles were a bit folded at the ball of the foot, so it created a bit of a bump.  My son did not complain, but I doubt I would buy this brand again."
2.0,"Not stitched. Nice patterns, but had to stitch together myself. 2/5 because I don't have a sewing machine and had to stitch by hand."
2.0,"Very small. Fits my 8 year old. Great quality, very warm and comfy feeling."
2.0,I liked the leggings well enough but two odd the pair arrived with a large whole in the leg seam.
2.0,Will be returning. Runs small!
2.0,The earrings are a bit large for the earlobe
2.0,Runs small and it’s not warm enough to be used as a winter coat. Returning.
2.0,"Muy diferente a la foto donde muestra un ajuste y diseño pegado al cuerpo contrario a lo que me llegó una falda amplia, con un diseño diferente."
2.0,Material is crappy i got what i paid for
2.0,Can be reinforced by super glue
2.0,These mask were beautiful but on the wrong material and the material was too tight against my face. I have them to my younger daughter and she said they were hard to breathe through.
2.0,"I really liked the styling and material of this vest, unfortunately after having it for a couple months with light use, the mic loop is falling off on both sides, the stitching on the reflective stripes is coming off in multiple areas. I’d definitely go with a different vest if you want it to last."
2.0,"I bought this dress to wear for a wedding rehearsal dinner.  I am 5’6 and 125lbs.  I ordered a medium and it was really loose and baggy in the mid section.  Also the sleeves were too short.  There was also a hole in one of the sleeves.  I would have returned it and worn something else, but I was out of town and needed it that day.  So, I sewed up the hole and wore it."
2.0,"They were too big in the chest and legs, yet REALLY snug across my hips...not my style. I tried adjusting but no help. The material is great. Just not made for apple or pear shaped person"
2.0,small face. would be good for a girl. not a manly man watch
2.0,"Bought this as a gift but was unable to give it because of the message on the packaging. It is a cute bracelet but I'm disappointed due to the message, which was not described. Would not recommend this if purchasing for a gift."
2.0,"I was so excited to get this as a means of having some eye protection when outside. The hat seems well made, it has a line of velcro stitched into the brim to attach the shield to. If you have a bigger head or thicker hair/afro, it will likely fit small or snug on you. I have a small head and had my hair in flat-twists, but the hat was still a bit small/uncomfortable. The shield itself attaches fairly easily to the hat. It looks nice, however, because the plastic  bends slightly /isn't stiff (I've attached a picture so hopefully it helps for you to see what I mean), looking through the plastic is like looking through  a pair of prescription glasses that aren't your prescription. The bends cause something like a wave in vision. I bought this specifically for the shield-hat combo and while it's a nice concept and aesthetically doesn't look half bad, I wouldn't recommend it for long walks. Firstly, you may get a headache, secondly you may end up having an accident. Also, a hat plus a shield plus a mask will get hot quickly."
2.0,"The bottoms were not leggings as they appeared to be in the photos. They were so cheaply made I could not  risk wearing them. The shirt and headband was all I could wear from this costume. Paired with jeans, did the job."
2.0,"The colour is much more purple than burgundy and after only two days of wear, the battery is already dead."
2.0,Smells and super thin. They collapse when you breathe.
2.0,"I was so disappointed. The ad did not state size, and you need a magnifying glass to see the details on this."
2.0,Off center; one letter down might work. Very attractive and well made.
2.0,"I've loved other bras by this brand, but this is definately too small. I've ordered 36DD in the other styles so I did the same. I'll bevreturning this one,  unfortunately."
2.0,"Smaller cut and fit I’m a large but ordered an extra large because it looked a little bit like a junior size.<br /><br />Also, top has a stain."
2.0,"The shirt itself was cute, but I can't wear it due to the arms being too tight. I can barely bend my arm, it's extremely uncomfortable. The rest of the shirt fit true to size, the arms were just way tight and awkward. It's definitely not oversized when it comes to the sleeves."
2.0,"The watch band runs small, bought it for a gift for someone.  The band needs tp be at least another inch to be comfortable."
2.0,Way too big and dry clean only...<br />Cute and soft tho.
2.0,"I love the material and the fit but they are kinda short, barely touch my ankle and I'm only 5'5"
2.0,Description of item is not correct
2.0,"NIce shirt, love that it has a pocket but way to small for an extra large, cant even wear it."
2.0,I am large chested 34DD and it just didn't look good.  Nice material though
2.0,Photo shows what they look like after 1 day.
2.0,Not dark enough. I still find myself squinting a lot
2.0,Very poor quality and did not last long.
2.0,No shape at all. Runs small
2.0,"Product arrived in a timely fashion however 1 of the 5 buckles was defected, the whistle does not work due to a missing piece. The lack of attention to detail and quality assurance ensured I will not purchase this again, the price and fact that I got 4 buckles that will work for just over $2 a piece is the reason this is 2 stars instead of 1. Attaching a picture of the defective buckle next to a working one so you can see what I am talking about."
2.0,"They look pretty, but fits very small. Would fit a teen more than adult"
2.0,"I loved this lanyard and it looked great, but after 2 months of normal wear it broke."
2.0,Did not like how it hung on my shoulders. Lots of static too. Returned .
2.0,Not happy. I'm a size 8 but bought a size 9 and it was still small.
2.0,They didn't feel true and i could not zip them. They were too small around the ankle. So I just givin them away to a sibling. Instead of going through the return process.
2.0,Very small I bought ex large  and could get it on .
2.0,"The material was thicker than expected, plus it didn't fit right. I am returning it. Thank you."
2.0,"The bandanas were the perfect size, but the weight is a bit poor.  But, I guess this is my fault.  I use the bananas for work, I'm in a high heat and I sweat a lot."
2.0,The fit a bit smaller than what I had in mind.
2.0,There are huge holes on the back that are too high. There is no stretch.
2.0,"The material is cool and comfortable, and it feels great. I normally wear a medium but decided to order a small based on other reviews and it fit perfectly. However the placement of the pockets make my hips and thighs look abnormally large so I will be returning this. I am 5' 2&#34; and the dress comes to about 3 inches above my knee."
2.0,The quality is bad and the shorts fit awkward. I’m 5’5 with an athletic-curvy build and I usually fit mediums but will often size up to large (and randomly sometimes small is the best fit). I ordered the large opting for a looser fit. You have to wear the shorts low rise or else the look awkward- so if you’re hoping for the high waist crop top look this isn’t it. Also for $25 the quality is terrible...feels more like $10...should’ve spent the $25 at Target for better quality but they’ve been so low stock :/
2.0,The metal is cheap and bends super easy. They feel funny on my wrist but that could just be my wrist. I only ended up wearing 1 and getting rid of the others.
2.0,"I loved this until all the fringe started coming out.  Threads are not secured, only threaded through fabric and every time you sit down or move it sheds.  This is only true with the black one"
2.0,"I love everything about the sock, from the design to its comfort.<br />It isn't too tight, feels very comfortable and it looks really nice too BUT AND I MEAN A BIGGG BUT<br /><br />The sock leaves residue behind. After a workday, I take my socks off to take a shower, and all I see are sock lint stuck to my feet. At first, I thought it was because it is new, but even after a couple of washes, the lint still persists. It's not even like a small amount. Enough to feel bothered by it. With these socks, I have to immediately  wash my feet after I take them off, otherwise, it gets all over the carpet"
2.0,Very wierd material. Cute. But will never wear. Its boxy and just weird
2.0,THE STRAPS BROKE ON ALL FOUR OF THEM. SHITTY QUALITY DO NOT BUY.
2.0,Don't know how long this will last since the material is really cheap & flimsy
2.0,Pretty but runs very big! Size down!
2.0,"It says one size fits all and in the back it read from 90 lbs - 160 lbs...I'm a little more than that waist down and these were too tight on my stomach even though they're stretchy. To the seller, PLEASE INCLUDE HOW MANY POUNDS IT'LL FIT! I wear dresses in size 8/10 and this pantyhose didn't fit sadly."
2.0,The buttons are sewn on. You cannot unbutton them.  They are decorative and not functional.  One shirt fit well.  The other shirt did nit fit well - the top shoulder seam did nit sit flat but stuck up and the right arm hole was larger than the left.  I am returning them.  Sloppy craftsmanship.  Not recommended.
2.0,"Just kind of a strange fitting suit, not so flattering on me personally (5'4&#34;, 120lbs, DD cup)"
2.0,Fits a size and half smaller
2.0,Everything is all wrong with this dress the only thing on it that looks like the picture is the sleeved the zipper gets stuck not impressed
2.0,The picture online wasn’t accurate.  The shirt says “It’s a Hallmark Channel and not chocolate kind of day” and depicted the Hallmark crown.
2.0,"The design of the sloth came out a lot more orange than the picture shows. Disappointed but still wearing it. It’s a cute top. Just wish the design would have come out better. I usually wear large - xlarge. I went with a large here. Fits accurately but if you want a more roomy fit, I suggest going a size up."
2.0,"I do not care for this scarf. It is very thin and also itchy. The edging is sloppy looking and the angled cut at the end is very unattractive to me. It works well as a scarf but had I seen this in person in a store before ordering, I would never have ordered this."
2.0,The gloves are not touch screen friendly and the hat is tight and not comfortable.
2.0,Its a cheap cloak. After the one day it started to come undone. Worked for the day I needed it.
2.0,Not impressed with the material of this dress will be sending back. Is too thin. The top part of the dress neckline if not a good lining stitching it me.But others may like it. It's just not for me .
2.0,I really liked the design but the strap on the bracelet broke in about a month.
2.0,This bathing suit is poorly made with scratchy material. The top is way too small while the bottoms were too large. I gave it two stars because the color is beautiful. Would NOT recommend
2.0,"The short is very small and uncomfortable, the top is fine,"
2.0,Torn just after 2 washes in washing machine
2.0,It needs to be a size or two larger. I have not worn it and would like to return for a larger size.
2.0,These do not keep my hands warm at all. Very disappointed
2.0,"The size was good, however, very uncomfortable. The lace along the bottom starts to rise as if they’re a thong style underwear. You could see panty line through clothes. My go to style of underwear is boy shorts and they’re so comfortable. These were not. I wouldn’t purchase them again."
2.0,"I have a pair of Clarks Desert Mali boots that I have worn for the better part of a decade. I love them so I decided to get another pair. I ordered the same size boots as the ones I currently have, and the ones that just arrived are WAY too small. They are at least a size and a half smaller than my original pair.  Both sets of boots are marked the same size so there is something squirrely with the sizing.  This company makes you pay return shipping to get a refund. Keep that in mind."
2.0,Fur lining is only at the top.
2.0,Super cute fabric I ordered a size up and it was too small so order 2 sizes up maybe it will fit<br />The arms were super tight tighter then they should have been
2.0,"Brand new, this watch is losing about 5 minutes a week. How does that even happen with a quartz watch these days? Also, even with it's rubber band, it weighs as much as my all-stainless Omega Seamaster. It feels like they added weight just for the point of being heavy."
2.0,Very nice for the price. Beautiful.  I just hope it don't change as it do not have the 925 stamp on it. I'll just enjoy w it.<br />Two weeks later it changed.
2.0,They look like good quality but the zipper doesn't work and I failed to send them back a long time ago. I wonder if I'm still able to ?
2.0,Looks nice but runs small 😐 I'm 110 and small ALWAYS fits me
2.0,This necklace doesn’t stay flat. I would not recommend this style.
2.0,Did not line feel of fabric
2.0,Quality not the same. Fit differently from the ones purchase in store
2.0,My wife was expecting a little different design then what it came.
2.0,Im so sad because these jeans would’ve been so cute but they fit huge!! i ordered a medium and they fit like a large or an x-large
2.0,The fabric is very poor quality
2.0,"While this is a very nice looking bag, the smell is horrendous - still lingering many weeks after purchase - and the quality leaves a lot to be desired. The very first time I carried this bag, one of the decorative studs fell off and was lost. Leaving THREE holes in the bag. Scarleton customer service was quick to reply but could not provide a replacement stud and offered no exchange. Amazon customer service, refunded my purchase (thankfully) but I will not buy this brand again."
2.0,Little bit disappointed
2.0,The fabric was a little scratchy and the fit wasn't the most flattering on my rectangular torso.
2.0,"I admit I was expecting a lot more for a purse costing more than $50.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  First off, the main zipper is too large for the purse and sticks out about 4 inches on each end.  There is no way to completely close the purse with this zipper without breaking it.  Secondly, it has only two pockets.  One large zipped pocket in the middle (it does not keep items put on the outside from shifting to the other side so you really can't consider the sides to be separate pockets.  Items will just slip under the center large pocket.)  The second zipped pocket is very, very small.<br /><br />Definitely a disappointment for the price.  This is, at best, a $20 purse."
2.0,If you’re not in Asia the day is off. I couldn’t set it to match the date with the correct day!
2.0,The material is bad  ot for the gym at all!! Not worth the money
2.0,"I ordered mine back in April and just got it. Was lost in the mail and they resent it. Ordered a small which was almost the right size. I'm 5'4&#34; 32D about 27 inch waist and it was slightly small across the abdomen. The material is not soft and flowy, feels like spandex to me. It's going back. Only plus is customer service has been pretty good."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:be410dd0c31b78011c1bbad61acc3501]] I just had breast reduction surgery. Went from a 46i to a d. And this bra is so soft, fits amazing, zips easily, i just put it on today so far im completely happy. The elastic kinda hurts a little under the boobs but my surgery was only 2 weeks ago and the wounds are fresh so im sure its not the bras fault!  *Revise i had to change my review bc i went to wear the black one and it is not made the same . The zipper would not go up and ita waaay smaller than the white one. It hurt i had to take it off after 3 minutes i will be sending it back. And the others i ordered if they are defective as well!"
2.0,Product was very poor quality. would not purchase again.
2.0,To small in the arms and shoulders. The Untuckit shirts seem to be more of a fitted shirt vs a loose fit.<br />I love the look.<br />Very disappointed that their shirts run small.
2.0,The dress was pretty but found it fit too clingy to the body.
2.0,"I was very excited upon ordering this shirt, but little did I know, they were going to send me a youth large rather than a men large.<br />The shirt is of great quality and I intend on giving it to a friend, but I wish they would have put in the description that it is a Youth shirt and not an actual men’s shirt."
2.0,Meh.. if you want better quality and fit try 90 degree yoga pants. Best ones and other reviewers seem to agree
2.0,bought an XL - fits like a medium for my teen - giving it to her
2.0,Made cheaply and skimpily.
2.0,I sent this item back - it is very pretty but didn't hold up even for 1 use.
2.0,"I bought two of these for my daughter, who does aerial arts.  The tan colored one is completely see-through.  Though I purchased two in the same size, they did not fit the same.  One was too small, the other fit loosely in certain places."
2.0,"My chain appeared to be broken when it arrived.! I have a small head and it was too short to fit around my head .! I had to sit it on top on my head and prayed it didn't fall off., if I didn't need it right away I would've exchanged it for a brand new one"
2.0,Strange musty odor and needed airing before using.
2.0,"We used these for a veterans day luncheon. They weren't the best, all were flattened and squished and many had to be glued back together. I checked and was able to fix them up in plenty of time, but had they been a last minute purchase, they would have been useless. Not worth the price for what they needed to look decent."
2.0,"Pretty, but definitely fake. The beads are “polished” but are totally plastic and not baltic amber. You can tell by the beads if you look at them there is no  pitch or resin in them like genuine amber beads. Also they are weightless and float.  Very bummed."
2.0,Ordered a women's 2x got a small
2.0,"This shirt is much smaller than XXLs.  Whatever your size, you should probably order a size larger.  Also it feels like you won't get a lot of wears from it as it will probably rip or get a hole pretty quickly.  That's my assumption but it doesn't feel as strong as a regular T shirt / undershirt."
2.0,"I bought to monogram for my son and the color is not a bright white, they have a red tint to them. I also found them to be super thin and wide. I would not purchase again"
2.0,"Really thin material, the band around the stomach rolls up really easily and there is no volume. Overall, it was not what I was looking for for a formal event"
2.0,"I noticed immediately that it is not seamless. Both shoulders have seams. And all the edging has zigzag stitching and still frayed easily and with these threads coming through, my daughter would start picking and pulling them."
2.0,Nice style nice look but timer unable to exceed one half hour
2.0,"The title says it all, each spike on this thing is literally held on by a singular tiny thread, I'm surprised some weren't already fallen off in the package .. lucky for me tho cause I prefer the hat with just the horn and no spikes so it was daily easy to remove the bead spikes. Looks better when you don't have a head covered in spikes, looking like your a human katamari that just rolled out of hot topic"
2.0,If you have big wrists then this isn't the band for you . Or if you sensitive skin I'd try to find something else.
2.0,The owl fell off/broke after three days of wearing.
2.0,These were not good quality. At least a quarter of them didn't work.
2.0,These are too small for my husband's face.
2.0,Me gustaron los colores y como se ven en el reloj pero la cinta es muy grande y el reloj está en movimiento en la mano y hasta se cae
2.0,I like it but one of the links broke and now it is just 2 necklaces in one.
2.0,They don't fit snuggly at the wrist so they can fall off.  I measured and they were still too big.
2.0,Half of the horns the string had come off. They are not as large as pictures.  Very cheap.
2.0,"I love the product but mine was received with the pink feather broken on one earring and on the other the red feather was completely gone.  I thought it might have broken off in packaging but went through everything.  I think it was broken off getting ready to ship.  I had no intention of going through the anguish of sending these back, therefore, the two star rating.  I simply re-glued the pink feather on and then took the red feather off the other earring and split it then re-glued the split red feather to both earrings.  Looks good.  As long as the glue holds up I am happy.  Earrings like this should be shipped in little jewelry boxes instead of a plastic bag."
2.0,The extender wasn't as elastic and fitted as I would have liked.  It seemed like I was adjusting constantly.  Would have been better to have more stretch.
2.0,"I ordered a 2XL, my normal size in items. The only way to get this on is to fit your whole body through the neck, and it's not stretchy. And my hips are much too big for that.<br />It's 100% Polyester and just feels gross."
2.0,Socks unfortunately fall apart after 3 times wearing them and washing.
2.0,bad fitting
2.0,Just go to pac sun and buy your sweaters . This is a shame . Way to small and cheaply made . Don’t bother .
2.0,The compression short part is not fitted at all. It’s very loose —not a compression short as advertised. There is very little spandex/elasticity.  And I do not have skinny legs.<br /><br />The actual short part is good.
2.0,"I bought this pretty phone purse for my vacation, but the front part of the purse the magnet pops open when you put your phone inside. Was very disappointed and would not recommend this product for purchase."
2.0,"band too small, Great Quality, Very fast shipping"
2.0,These bracelets are so cheap that I haven't even taken them out of the pkg. What a waste of $10!
2.0,"Not item pictured, I am has insignia, I am has insignia, item picture does not, we'll keep because it still close to what I want but false advertising. Also color more brown than yellow."
2.0,"I f not like this robe at all. It looks very cheap, the thread is unraveling at several places, and it fits very awkwardly. I have gotten cheaper robes with better quality. I am highly disappointed. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because it is truly opaque and serves its purpose."
2.0,I didn't le how the quote was virtually unreadable how it was stamped on
2.0,Not the usual quality Koali is known for.
2.0,"This looks nothing like the item ordered.  In the advertisement photos you get what looks like a long chain with an infinity clasp and a decent size pendent in blue.<br /><br />What I got was a choker chain, and it is really to small for me, that is so delicate it will break if pulling to tightly to put on (twice links broke while trying to put this on).  The stone, while pretty is smaller in width then my pinky nail, but I am pretty sure that is the size that was advertised.<br /><br />The presentation package is 5+ star.  This comes in a leather , zip close, pouch with a hard plastic (like a credit card size) care instructions.  It like more effort was put into the presentation then the actual item.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this just because the chain is so beyond cheap and short its worthless."
2.0,"I ordered this dress in a size small in red. I'm 5'3&#34;, 110lb, 32C. The dress was overall too large and too long, even with 4 inch heels. The dress was very heavy too. I have a similarly styled dress that I much prefer because it's better quality and fits better. The cutout in the back is very low and you can't wear a regular bra with it. It may have been because it was too big, but the dress didn't do much for my shape and it really would need a belt."
2.0,Too small. Order two sizes up
2.0,"I read the other reviews on this jacket ,so I ordered a 2xl ...it's more like an XL the sleeves hang down past my finger tips ..but the thing nobody seemed to mention was that the zipper is on the left side of the jacket ,I grew up thinking this as a woman's jacket ?? It's not a deal breaker but sure is awkward to try and zip ....."
2.0,The distressing on the skirt was to high and revealing in inappropriate areas of the body also the zipper was defective. I was very disappointed after waiting so long for item to be delivered.
2.0,"The shoes were a size or two too small. I didn't return them because they are a great deal, so I passed them to a friend who could wear them and they looked great on her."
2.0,"They don't stay lit.  They are hard to turn on.  They don't go on your figers very well.  I guess as a party gag they are OK, but don't buy them if you are depending on them to light anything."
2.0,"Looks cheap, is very stiff, and doesn't hold glasses very well. Am returning. Perhaps I would keep if it cost $5, but not for $20. I expected better."
2.0,I bought this for my 25 yr old but of course tooooo small so I will give it to his 13yr old brother. The material is nice just to small
2.0,I usually wear a M/L and sized down after reading reviews that this sweater runs large. Even the small was huge! In addition it's a loose weave and a boxy shape. Needless to say it's going back.
2.0,Had a small hole in it when it arrived
2.0,"Had no issues putting the protector on my earring (standard post for lobe), but couldn't fit the earring through my piercing hole anymore. Way too thick. Wish the item description gave some indication about size or the gauge. Also the backing end of the post does not get completely covered, so my ear ended up getting irritated anyway while trying to force the post through the hole. Overall pretty cheap. Next time, I'll just make sure my earrings are hypoallergenic before I buy them instead of trying a cheap fix."
2.0,The material felt way nicer than I anticipated and even though I'm 5'5 and 140lbs (within the suggested height & weight parameters) the nightie was really shirt length.
2.0,The stone was really cheap and cloudy looking.
2.0,"This was not what I expected.  The length was much shorter than I gathered from the info and other reviews.  It looks better in pictures, very fake/cheap in person.  Chain is not good quality, turned my neck green!  You get what you pay for though.  Just wasn't for me."
2.0,It's a much lighter grey than what the picture depicts.
2.0,Colors ran the first day I used it.
2.0,Cheap polyester fabric. Sturdy wire inside allows you to form a twist or a rose. Good for a kid but not me.
2.0,This would be perfect for you if weigh 500 pounds and your head is the size of a grapefruit.  otherwise it's useless.
2.0,There are differing pictures on this product. I saw an actual necklace sized sheikah slate with a leather strap and after I ordered it a couple days later the image shown in my order was a circular dogtag with the shiekah eye symbol.<br />The product I got was good quality but definitely not what I thought I ordered.
2.0,Had holes in it when I first opened it. Looks smaller than what it should be for its size. Looks cheap.
2.0,The item is stated to fit 8.5&#34; wrist and i have and 8&#34; wrist and i can not close the clasp. Update your description or fix the product. I am returning mine to Amazon. I did receive the item on time.
2.0,"Weirdest pair of jeans I have ever tried on! They do not have a skinny bottom like the picture shown, and they are also about 3 inches too short (I’m 5’6”). I sized up based on other reviews which made them a little too large. Very cheap looking. Do not buy!"
2.0,Thinner than expected. Size as expected. Strings very long_ they reach the pocket.
2.0,"I wear a men's size 10 shoe and these are pretty small after washing them. I have to stretch them to make them fit, at which point the material is pulled so tight they're almost see through and non-absorbing for any foot moisture. Although I love the rubber on the heel that helps them stay on, I wouldn't buy them again."
2.0,Size is too small Ordered xxl and it’s actually xs.
2.0,"One of the clips came already broken. The other feels flimsy. Not for thick or curly hair, it could not stand up to it."
2.0,"This jacket had big, full, floppy sleeves which makes a petite person look terrible.  Had to also roll the sleeves.  The fabric was not very thick and it was just not what I was hoping for.  Sent back."
2.0,"I liked the fit of the dress, however, it was pretty see through even with two layers and it was missing the button to hook at the top in the back."
2.0,"This was different from what I had expected. From the product description photo, I was expecting something more dark brown and cream, but the scarf I got is actually black and brown, with a heavy gold specks all over. Most of all, though, the material is heavier and scratchier than what I was expecting. Looking at the customer photos, I was expecting something lighter with more of a linen feel to it. Mine definitely feels like polyester and in fact reminds me of that kind of stretchy polyester material that seemed common in the 70s. It is also long/big and so along with the heaviness of the material this is too bulky for me. I won't be using this unfortunately."
2.0,"tight on the waist line . not very high quality ,disappointed"
2.0,I hate the material.  But I bought it as a joke anyways so the colors were perfect.
2.0,"This was the first kind of liver-of-sulfur I tried to oxidize my jewelry. It (was smelly but) worked for a few months. But to my surprise it expired and no longer oxidized my jeweler to the dark color I was hoping to achieve.<br /><br />I replaced it with the gel. A small container of gel lasts much longer than this chunky stuff, and works much better.<br /><br />I recommend buying [[ASIN:B00341129U Extended Life Liver of Sulfur Patina Oxidation Gel 4 ounces 45022]] over this product."
2.0,the chain is much Thinner then the picture. I brought it based on the picture for my grand daughter birthday had I ordered it earlier I would have sent it back.
2.0,the backings are really hard to get on.  I will not be using these.
2.0,"Not exactly the color I wanted but I was forced to take it anyway first time I've ever had problems like this, too tight."
2.0,"I'm so bummed. I bought TWO bracelets from Zenergy Gems. One came beautifully sealed with a sticker on the outside of the plastic, a tag on the bracelet, inside a clean box. THIS BRACELET was thrown into a plastic bag, a sticker slapped on the bottom of the box, no tag on the bracelet and the inside of the box was stained. The bracelet itself is beautiful, which is why I gave two stars. But it is unsuitable as a gift. Would have been perfect if it was new or in good condition."
2.0,"Thin, just SS wore, sharp ends"
2.0,"It's really big and really heavy. The black paint doesn't cover the entire link in the wristband and makes it look bad when it bends. Also I'm not entirely sure if the wristband is adjustable because that was massive on my hand too. It's not very clear in the pictures, but the glass is NOT embedded into the dial, its on the surface so it will scratch very easily. On the bright side I did get a full refund for it so the company is bro in my book but this product was not for me. The design looked beautiful though, the dial especially. Readeel let me know when you have a thinner, lighter version of this and I'll gladly be your first purchase."
2.0,Its cute for the price but when I got it in the mail it was missing the clip on the chain. Luckly I know how to fix it. Wasn't to happy about that. But like I said.. For the price its cute
2.0,The fabric feels cheap and although it's a spandex type of material it's not form fitting. I normally wear a M or L. I purchased it a M and the fit was not what I expected. If I would have gotten a smaller size then the sleeve and neck would have been too tight. I returned my dress.
2.0,"I'm 5'10&#34; and have a pretty average build. I can fit into size L junior shirts with ease usually. I order the large expecting the same. It fits more a small! Order minimum 2 sizes up unless buying for a child. It is very soft and would be comfortable, if it fit."
2.0,One of my charms was damaged when I received my item. Two of the other charms were not attached to the bangle so i had to reattached it on. Overall I was not impressed.
2.0,"It looks pretty in the picture, but the fabric is very rough on the skin. and it did not hang well on my body at all. very ill-filling."
2.0,Quality of clothes it’s awful
2.0,"I  love the size, but they started to tarnish after a week"
2.0,"After a month of having this, part of the edges started to peel away and now I have metal poking my wrist. Not worth the money"
2.0,It looks cute and petite but thecenter ring constantly flips up so it’s not flat on your arm/wrist- it stands up like a big ol magnet is pulling it away from your wrist. I can’t wear mine for that reason- it looks goofy.
2.0,"Cute ring that I was initially happy with. After less than 3 weeks however, the silver finish has already come off in spots showing a coppery base. The ring now looks cheap and will not be worn again. Disappointed and feel like I've wasted money."
2.0,"leather. grey. looks great in the box. includes the two spring pins and a tool to help insert. the sleeve that holds the tail of the band keeps slipping off, too big. i inserted the tail thru the adjustment clip and the leather wrinkles. no high quality for the money. i wont but this one, again."
2.0,The white background is not white. It's more of  greenish color. I would have kept it but I usually buy Xl so I ordered an XXL but it's too small. I'm thinking about reordering it in XXXL. I hope it isn't too big.
2.0,"UPDATE: So... here's an update on these socks. The socks fit my 8 year old great around his leg. However, as an adult trying to put on these socks...it was ridiculous. The tops of the socks are so so narrow trying to pull them up a few inches past my ankle just isn't going to happen! The foot part fits great, but as far as around the calf...it's not so great, at all. I have been putting on the socks and then folding them so that I can wear them. It works for me since I wear them with long pants, but if you are an adult and want to wear them as knee high socks. it's not going to happen for most of us. These socks are so much fun! I was actually looking for bright colored or neon knee high socks for my son to wear on the field during his football games (Kids wearing bright socks on the field are MUCH easier to spot. This way I can make sure I'm taking pictures of my kid and not the neighbors!). It worked out perfect, he wears the solid color orange and yellow socks, and his sister and I share the other multicolored socks. The color and pattern are great. However, the socks are quite thin. The socks don't have any type of padding or double layers on the bottom, just the one this layer throughout the whole sock. I really like these socks, but I'm not sure how long they will last because they are so thin. Thankfully, they are available for a great price so I can order more when I need to."
2.0,I ordered a 2xl and couldn't fit them. I gave it to my daughter
2.0,"While they are decent tank tops they are definitely not compression tank tops... They &#34;compress&#34; about as much as a cotton wife beater... I ordered  extra small based on another reviewer saying to go down a size... Even if I went down 3 sizes (which couldn't be done xs is the smallest option) they still wouldn't work as a compression top... They are pretty thin... They aren't a total loss though... The material didn't feel too bad. I chose the black, white, and grey option so I do have a variety to match with other clothing. The fit isn't horrible when you first put them on... However they don't fit the same after hours of wearing them... I couldn't imagine using them at the gym... If you sweat they're really gonna stretch out... And if you are looking to contain any kind of jiggle... Forget it... I gave two stars because they aren't the worst thing I've ever purchased... I like the T shaped back... It makes your back/shoulders look pretty badass... But the price wasn't that great for regular tank tops... For compression tank tops it would've been a phenomenal price... But as I've already said they're definitely not compression tank tops..."
2.0,"The top ball doesn't screw tight , lost it after only 2 days of wearing it."
2.0,Horrible color combination in person. Stick with the other tried-and-true patterns
2.0,"Feels like good quality and exactly type of wallet I want, only thing is it looks nothing like the picture... I bought it for the design shown in picture and I'm now contemplating returning it."
2.0,"I got these for when weather turns warmer for my chemo-bald head, and I'm disappointed in them.  They look very cheaply made.  The ties are only whip-stitched around the edges, and that looks like no one cares enough to do a real hem.  There is quite a bit of room in them if you are bald, but it's hard to get them properly tied so the big hole doesn't show as you are active and the scarf shifts around a bit.  The hot weather isn't here yet, so I have time to find a better cool substitute, but I seriously doubt I'll be wearing these this summer, just not a good choice for me."
2.0,"Do not fit true to size, delivery slow."
2.0,I was very disappointed in the sizing of this product . It runs extremely small. I would not buy it again until they correct the sizing information.
2.0,Beautiful  shirt too small
2.0,Kinda disappointed because all of the colors are totally different from the ones pictured and the ones I received which is why I ordered them. A lot of them are duplicates all in pastel colors.
2.0,"I'm 5'10"", 200 lbs., so I bought the extra large.  It is tiny - much too small for me.  I gave it to my wife, who is 5'5"", 145 lbs."
2.0,I have bought same size before but this time they’re a totally different fit.
2.0,The feel of the dress was as expected. The sleeves are too tight for a big girl that has oversized arms. It doesn’t fit like a 4x. I sized up as I thought that might be the case. The cost was so small I wondered how it could be sold for that amount.
2.0,They are not bad but it wasn’t the feeling against my skin that I’d hoped.
2.0,I liked the material and design. The Vera Bradley name on the front looks fake. The wristlet strap already broke off. I’m disappointed.
2.0,"Purchased on November 1st 2020.  Pictures taken on January 18th 2021.  Not holding up well at all.  Was hoping to get at least 6 months out of these.  But they didn't even last 3 months.  Won't be buying again.  Will say the fit was good and they seemed to be warm enough.<br />Update, the vendor gave me a refund for the boots.  I appreciate that they were able to do that for me."
2.0,"The leggings are very soft, comfy, and stretchy. That said I wore them once and they was a hole (not in a seam, but in the fabric itself). They do not breathe at all, so they are very hot, bif working out in the-be warned."
2.0,terrible. i ordered a 2xl and it fit like a medium. im a size 8-10 us so i figured a 2xl would be plenty big enough but nope. its also cut more like a bodycon dress than a t shirt dress as pictured. the only reason im not giving it one star is because im going to cut off the neck detail and use it on another shirt
2.0,The shirt was tailored at the bottom
2.0,"Got this watch while on the Black Friday sale, and I'd be pissed if I paid the full price. It looks great, but the watch is stuck on a single date that I can't change and won't rotate past a certain time manually, leading me to believe the pin to set the time/date is messed up on the inside.<br /><br />Gets 2 stars on the idea that if it wasn't upwards of 90% off, I'd be MUCH angrier than I am now. I'd still suggesting staying away from this."
2.0,"Bought the grey one with the Aztec arms. Expected from reviews that the fabric was tshirt material, but didn't anticipate the weird fabric on the arms. Very stiff and not comfortable. My daughter just said it felt awkward and she didn't like it. We returned."
2.0,"Beautiful dress and my daughter loved it when she tried it on. Too bad it had some sort of grease or ink stain on the back of it under the tulle, which had to be there before the tulle was attached.  Sending it back!"
2.0,Wanted a spare so I didn't have to wear my gold watch on picnics and such...Way too cheap...broke in less than 3 weeks.
2.0,"Unfortunately, this suit looks more like camouflage instead of the Vecna character from Stranger Things."
2.0,"Looks nice but elastic coming apart after only a couple of wears. Also, bottom seam coming apart. Not well made."
2.0,The fabric started getting pills after a couple uses. I figured whatever still useable. I kept adjusting the straps thinking they were getting loose. The bottom of the bathing suit started sagging well below a level you could ignore. She likes Elsa but I'm not replacing this hoping I got a defect the first time
2.0,"I had high expectations for this bag, it looked like a perfect cheaply priced gym bag. TLDR: it shows signs of low build quality and cheap materials, but will work alright for light use.<br /><br />The Good:<br />Style: This bag is fairly good looking in my opinion. It has a classic &#34;gym bag&#34; look and nice navy coloring. The shoulder strap is fairly comfortable to wear for medium length walks.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Durablity: The seam of the interior pocket tore open within 2 days of use. This isn't a huge loss, and I was able to sew it together. Not a good sign. After about a month or semi-frequent use, the zipper gets stuck constantly and sometimes will come open after being closed.<br /><br />Should you buy it?<br />Probably not. In my opinion, you can probably find a much nicer  bag for a few more dollars, and it'll make a better long term investment."
2.0,Waste of my money.  Horrible material
2.0,Really poor quality - like cardboard
2.0,There was too much fabric to the point it would not fit on the watch.
2.0,"These pants are really bad, the medium size is very large so there’s no way you can’t fit on it"
2.0,No matter where I place them on my head or with what hairstyle they always slide off
2.0,The fabric makes this dress almost look like night wear. I was not happy upon receipt.
2.0,"I love the material, color, and look of the band but the pins that hold it to the watch body are not durable and after a week of using it, the pins would pop out and the watch would fall off.  This happened after replacing the pins with the spares that came with the band.  Same thing.  Too bad, back to the original band."
2.0,Runs narrow.  Ordered 9.5 which is my normal size length and width off had to return.  Not sure if sizing up will help so I probably won't reorder.
2.0,"The wallet arrived open with damage to the box. The wallet itself is alright, but I don’t like that there are so few compartments to store my cards."
2.0,Poorly made and even at it's farthest notch it only barely fits. And the front of the cap where the logo is has this unicorn hump that won't go away.
2.0,The necklace itself is very pretty but it took over a month to arrive.
2.0,The Way It’s On The Picture is not actually what they mail out to you it only has one strap to cover the stomach . It doesn’t cover that much of your stomach at all. It literally only covers mid and if you pull it too high it fits wrong on the thighs. So you can’t put it low like as pictured
2.0,broke after a couple of weeks.
2.0,"Although this dress is pretty and looks just like the picture, it isn't quality. The hem and stitching is all off and frayed and the material is like a wind breaker.  It also runs very small and has no give at the lace mid-waist.  Maybe it's made more for juniors."
2.0,"Cheap price, cheap quality delivery was regular envelope.  Result  product is dented"
2.0,"I've used these a few times, and unfortunately, the tops fold out. This allow you to see the bra under any shirt. I did carefully follow the wash instructions, but it made no difference. They're cute and fit well, but for that reason, I wouldn't recommend."
2.0,This magestically tacky watch cost less than $5.00 plus shipping. It is exactly what I paid for. I just had to see a $5.00 watch. As noted it is very tacky but on the plus side it has kept pretty good time for almost a week. That old saying that you get what you pay for holds true.
2.0,Order arrived on time but did not have two designs. I received two of the same item.
2.0,"Super soft fabric, but the top rolls down while working out. I’m 5’ 5”, 190lbs. I bought an XL. I have a bigger belly due to Diastis Recti (mommy tummy). They rolled down anytime I bent over to pick something up. Very frustrating as I bought these because the description was anti roll. Might as well stick to maternity leggings until I lose weight and work on my mommy tummy."
2.0,"Open cell, by definition, do not have the inside lining. This one does. Returning."
2.0,"8 pairs: 2 in Blue, 2 in Black, 2 in White and 2 in Black-n-Gray.<br />Ordered on August 4th, 2019.  Got socks on Friday, August 9th.<br /><br />Pro's: sturdy, durable fabric.  If you wanna know, it's 80% Nylon and 20% Spandex/Lycra/Elastane (all mean the same thing, chemically speaking; it's just different countries and manufacturers use different names for the same $#!+).  These socks are not going to tear or rip easily.  I did my homework and read various articles and external reviews.  And SB's were at or near the top - especially for maintaining their structure and compression over longer periods of time [a money saver].<br /><br />Con's:  A) 8 boxes.  8 pairs of socks.  Not one label or tag to tell you what the fabric is made of, or how to wash them.  Note: SB Sox is not alone in this: for whatever reason, many compression sock companies fail to disclose this on their Amazon page or include this information in what they ship.  FYI: Fabric is important.  The more cotton you have the more moisture retention you'll get.  More Nylon means more breathability and maintaining compression - - - but too much nylon can sometimes mean more delicate and shorter lifespan if it's sheer/thin-gauge weave or nylon.  I always thought ""ingredients"" had to be attached on a garment - or at least on the packaging.  Maybe the Chinese textile mill doesn't have to abide by that.<br /><br />And now for . . .<br /><br />Con B) The Biggie.<br /> The actual ""fit"" doesn't match their sizing chart.<br />Me: 10.5 US shoe size and 16-inch calf.  Well within their L/XL ""uni-size.""<br />Actual fit: much smaller, tighter.  I agree with other reviews that said the REAL fit runs on the much smaller side of the scale.  My 16-inch calf barely fits.  Don't know how an 18 or 19-inch person could even get them on.  How tight: lots of muscle to pull 'em on, and lines-n-logos left imprinted on my skin.  The foot part also runs small and narrow.  How small?  For starters my pinky toe didn't even fit in their cramped toe box; it stuck out like a sore pinky toe.<br />Secondly, the foot part was so tight that their ""SB Sox Lite"" logo was imprinted onto the inside step of my foot skin within an hour of wearing them.  I can't imagine many men having narrow enough feet to fit comfortably in these.  Maybe better for women.  And before you say, ""Well, they ARE compression socks, and they're supposed to squeeze you"" - - - keep in mind that there is compression and then there is Boa Constrictor constriction.  Sizing matters with compression socks: a wrong fit either renders the product useless at best and harmful at worst [they're intended to aid vein bloodflow back up - - - NOT reduce arterial bloodflow down].  In fact, people aren't supposed to be wearing compression socks unless they have an ABI (Ankle-Brachial Index) greater than 1. [I squeaked by with a 1.1].<br /><br />I do understand why SB and other companies have gone with a ""2-sizes fits all"" approach: it cuts costs and thereby increases profits.  The textile mill in China only needs to run 2 looms, not several for various sizes.<br />But in an attempt to save money, companies can also lose money by losing customers.<br />Bad fit means I'm either getting nothing, or getting high blood pressure and a heart-attack one day.<br />I'm going to look for a Company that offers more size gradations to better match ankle girth, calf girth and calf length.<br /><br />I can't return them, because I foolishly tore open every box and threw them out, before even trying a single sock on [one of many drawbacks to being a 'neat-freak.']<br />So I've already cut the feet off and turned them into compression ""sleeves"" - - - and will wear Nylon ""anklets"" on my feet for the breathability.  Who knows . . . I may eventually have to make a cut near the top of the calf just to relieve the pressure there.<br /><br />But if you've got super slender feet and tiny toes and a calf less than 16-inches around . . . these SB Sox should last you."
2.0,"I was extremely upset with this purchase. My daughter needed a shirt for a theme day at school for July 2nd (4th of July theme/Patriotic) so I ordered her this top because she has the same style in different designs and those are her favorites. She was not happy with this top and neither was I. It is very short in the front, like it barely goes to her waist and she’s short not tall, then it hangs a lot lower in the back. I understand it’s a high/low style but the “high” part is extremely “high”. Also it is supposed to be a polyester and spandex material which is usually buttery soft and this isn’t it feels like a regular cotton top which my daughter doesn’t like because they other is light and airy and considering it’s 105°+ where we live right now this is a heavier material. Overall I’m so not happy with this top."
2.0,Not as cute as other silicone rings. Looks like a rubber band. Not a fan.
2.0,WAY too small. gets tangled way too easily. Fits my 4 year old niece better than an adult.
2.0,Didn't care for the fabric or the fit.
2.0,Stupid silver stripe why ?
2.0,Latch breaks within 5min
2.0,u would need to go a size up
2.0,"Very large for its card capacity. Cheap build quality. The rubber border that seals the edges started peeling away after a couple months of carrying it every day. Bought it with the mindset of &#34;Why do I need an expensive wallet&#34;, answer, you don't but this one falls below the bar. Spend an extra $5-10 and get something better.<br /><br />The seller is now trying to bribe me to remove this review."
2.0,"I got this for my daughter for school. She has her chromebook, binder, headphones and pencil pouch. That's her daily load. All her books are electronic so she carries minimal amount of things. School started Aug 10th and here we are a month later and the straps are already tearing off. It's a nice looking bag but NOT at all durable. It is ok for occasional use but not daily use. I wanted to return it once we first recieved it because I had a feeling the quality was poor but she loved the design and wanted to keep it. There's no inside pockets. It's just one layer of synthetic fabric and that's it. It's not worth it. Buy something else."
2.0,"It's more of a pastel lime green than yellow, if that makes sense. Definitely size up. I bought a 3x"
2.0,"I really like this badge holder. It is heavier than ordinary ones but that is to be expected as the extender is wire and not string and the extra weight of the screw cap for the diffuser pad. I have thoroughly enjoyed this holder for about 3 months now. My work requires fob access to all secure areas so the retractable part is used frequently. I also love the alligator clip so I can place it anywhere. It is strong and holds without issue. I have about 6 small keys attached to my badge and have not had any issues. Without a doubt I would buy again and I recommend to all who inquire about it.<br />Also, I do add essential oils daily and have had zero issues with staining/rusting/discoloration.<br />I pair with my favorite Plant Therapy EO. Currently my obsessions from PT are Luckiest and Toy Soldier."
2.0,"Although this pendant has nice detail and is beautiful, the seller describes the weight of this item as .6 ounces, which is equal to just over 18 grams.  This pendant is only 5.9 grams.  Was expecting a heavy piece and received a lightweight piece."
2.0,They are very uncomfortable because the piece that goes into the pierced hole is too short.
2.0,Hangs like a sheetm
2.0,Didn’t realize the styling of the item
2.0,"I really liked this shirt, but i noticed a small hole where it wasn't fully sewn together on one side of the top line."
2.0,Great for looks but absolutely worthless for keeping time.... POS<br />Don't get me wrong...I really do love the look of it but if a clock doesn't work then it a worthless piece of crap!<br />I didn't purchase this just for looks. This was a waste of money.
2.0,Fell apart.  Beautiful at first tho
2.0,"These slippers are cute and comfy but they do not fit to size. I am a size 6 and I could have used a size 5. As I walked, they kept slipping off my feet."
2.0,It was fun for like 2 days. It broke after a week. I don't drop my keys or anything. The center pin fell out and not it doesn't spin.
2.0,The elastic is very stiff and won't accommodate a person who wears a 2xl shirt. I'm very disappointed.
2.0,"Really cute pattern and dress. However it was way too short to be wearable. I’m 5’6” and this barely covered my behind. Unfortunate, it’s going back."
2.0,Very difficult for my 7 year old to wear (and keep on without falling off) he liked the design but the quality is just not there.
2.0,"Pretty cheap, typical copy of military gear. If you know real equipment, this is a poor imitation that looks pretty cool but probably wouldn't pass trials. About what I expected for twenty bucks."
2.0,"Very cheap looking ,not good quality!"
2.0,The eye holes were too close. I could only see out of one side at a time. I had to cut the holes bigger.
2.0,fit was somewhat awkward - tight in waist loose elsewhere
2.0,"I liked this band a lot. It took a few days to wear in, and after 3 months of nearly constant wear it’s still in good condition - it looks great. It’s a little stiff, which makes it difficult to get on and off, but that wasn’t such a big deal to me. A bigger inconvenience was that I couldn’t get the band as snug as I prefer without having the buckle dig into my wrist due to the shape.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the connection to the Fitbit is not as good as the band itself. It’s generally looser than the OEM band, and at first that wasn’t a problem. If I caught the Fitbit just right, the connection would come loose and the watch would fall off. It happened two or three times in 3 months. However, in the last few weeks I’ve had my Fitbit fall off at least once a day. It’s generally been the same side failing, but not always. It might be because of the cold, or it may just be how the connection has worn over time."
2.0,"I was looking forward to this dress because it looks so sleek and classy. I usually wear a size Medium (5'8&#34;, 150lb) but I ordered a large because I prefer pencil skirts that don't hug my legs all the way down. Well, unless you have no curves, this dress will stick to every inch of you! Very unflattering - doesn't hide a thing. I ended up returning it. The quality was fine, but the fabric was thin and showed every nuance - despite having ordered a size larger."
2.0,This fit to my waist but don't fit to my butt..<br />It is larger than! 😂
2.0,"It has a sharp edge, where it goes to the smaller ."
2.0,These are adorable - by snapped 2 weeks after I bought them for my toddler. He wore them everyday and loved them :(
2.0,"Too small,  breaks easily"
2.0,"For Christmas this year, I was on the hunt for “Wizard of Oz” gifts for my boss. She is a huge fan and last year she celebrated her 40th birthday as Dorthy and went around the building picking up gifts along the yellow brick road.<br /><br />I was thrilled when I came across this mask. However, once the mask arrived to my home, I noticed that the mask is not the same as pictured here on Amazon. Instead, the mask has been folded long ways and stitched across 3 rows. I dislike that style of mask."
2.0,Kinda disappointed in it. I wear a medium on most things and probably needed an xtra small.
2.0,"Very cute, fits perfectly, but sweat right through it with very little perspiration."
2.0,"Dull, dark color disappointing. Nothing like the brilliant blue depicted in the picture online. I didn't every bother to try it on, as the main reason I bought the dress in the first place was the gorgeous, bin blue color.<br />So, back it goes, and the vendor goes with it -- off my list of favorite merchants into oblivion."
2.0,"Cute dress, pretty see-through, so I returned. I’m 5’1” and it was just a tiny bit long with tall wedges on."
2.0,"Comfortable gloves, but after only a handfull of rides the strap separated from the velcro, and stitching began to fray a bit at the fingers. A bit disappointed as they seemed to hold up pretty well at first. But for $10 I guess I can't complain all that much."
2.0,"I gave it away to my little brother.<br />Size suffers from China syndrome. Ordered a medium, received a napkin."
2.0,These are beautiful. But....<br />One clasp is defective. The one earring that doesn't have a defective clasp is lovely. Perfect size. Perfect shine. Perfect stones. Just imperfect clasp. So so so sad.<br />I'm returning them. :-(
2.0,If your busty this is not the shirt for you.  Unless you’re going to wear it open.
2.0,Way too small. Returning to get different size.
2.0,cute but not what i thought it would be. it looks fuller in the picture or more ruffled but it's not like that. but it is soft and what not so i can't complain too too much.
2.0,"I wanted to like this sweater so much, but it just drooped on me. I believe it was the cut and not the sizing because I ordered a small. The shoulders were huge and saggy. Not flattering. I returned."
2.0,The description says mirror lenses or glasses and it is NOT. VERY DISAPPOINTED
2.0,"It’s $13.<br /><br />Don’t forget that when it doesn’t fit.<br /><br />Don’t forget that when it stops working in two weeks.<br /><br />Don’t forget that when you attempt to wash it without taking time to think “what am I doing”<br /><br />Please don’t forget that when it starts making those buzzing noises that you can only shut out but for so long.<br /><br />And certainly, CERTAINLY, don’t forget that when the charging port isn’t working and the charge it holds only lasts you an hour and a half at best.<br /><br />I won’t. Now you won’t either."
2.0,Give it two stars because material was nice but size too big.. I’m a medium and it fits like a large
2.0,"Have to admit I am disappointed! I was so excited to get these since there was an assortment of sizes on the hoops and wasn't sure exactly what size I would need, but all of the hoops were either much too large or too small for my nose. The screws were adorable, some looked like marble, which I loved. The others were very dainty and cute colored stones, but the post is much too large for a 20 gauge piercing. I couldn't even get it to go through after several minutes of trying, the l shaped ones were ok. The balls were a bit large for my taste, but again the post was too large. The description says 20 gauge and these are definitely not."
2.0,Pictures looks good but not really in person
2.0,"Good quality fabric but the fit is very strange.  I ordered a size up and could hardly get it past my hips but the bust was too large, not a flattering fit and had no support.  Probably would have made it work if the halter tied in the back but its just a clip so you can't adjust the top."
2.0,Average quality for the price. Not what I expected in the material.
2.0,Very stiff material.  I thought I would get a soft sweatshirt type material.  Would NOT buy again.  I will try washing it a few times to see if I can get it any softer.
2.0,"These leggings are comfortable; however I purchased the neon lime color and they are completely see through. Impossible to wear unless under a tunic. Also I ordered this color to go with a Halloween costume but the color presents as completely yellow rather than a lime green, so they won't even work for that. I'm giving 2 stars only because they are comfortable and maybe a darker color would be fine in terms of not being able to see through the fabric."
2.0,This is very ugly on - a small is not at all flattering on my 5'5&#34; 115 lb frame.  The sleeves are also ridiculously tight.
2.0,the size was wrong and so was the color.
2.0,Buy a larger size. Clothes from China fit tight.
2.0,"The quality is good and what you would expect from the picture, but they make it look longer in the model photo. This sat right at my jean waistband. It looks shrunken. Can’t reach up or bend over without skin showing. It would be perfect if it was longer."
2.0,"Dress is comfy, but I wanted the purple color as pictured. Fit is good. No Way to wear a bra or panties too body hugging. I ordered it for an upcoming Prince event, wont be wearing,since its more of a wine color. I am 5'9 38D-33-45 and got a medium I will keep it anyway."
2.0,"Same glasses as purchased from a different ""manufacturer"". Barely tinted and very large lenses."
2.0,Looked pretty but definitely not true to size
2.0,"pretty tight for a med/large.  Probably won't be able to wear comfortably.  Should have gotten xl.  For reference, I usually wear a med in shirts"
2.0,I'd order at least 2 sizes larger than you usually wear!
2.0,Worked fine for a few months and then they started to lose suction so water kept getting in them.
2.0,"This runs smaller than they claim. The beads are on a cheap plastic thread that has little to no stretch. It's cute, but I can't wear it."
2.0,Be careful of unfinished edges that can damage your watch case and make fitting the bracelet difficult. I had to grind off a small tab of metal that wouldn’t allow the pin to line up with its respective hole and this tab scratched my watch case. You get what you pay for on this one. Cheap price results in lack of attention to detail and drop in quality.
2.0,"These socks are reasonably well made, the fabric seems soft and comfortable, and the design is clever--- but what you don't see in the pic is that you're getting TWO RIGHT SOCKS. They didn't do a left and right sock, and the design is on the SIDE. So the pics and phrase that you see in the photo is on the OUTSIDE of your right leg, and the INSIDE of your left. I don't think it's an artistic statement, I think it's just plain cheaper not to have two different knit patterns. Disappointed."
2.0,"Not the manufactuers fault, but my boobs will not fit in this. Not just kinda sexy, full cups but just NO"
2.0,Stones falling out and can't be fixed when I took it to a jeweler. With the amount of money paid for this item I was expecting at least some quality but it's flimsy and can't believe the lose stones!
2.0,Loops were tight
2.0,The medium fits like an XL. Cute style and decent quality if it only ran true to size.
2.0,"I wear an american L and I got a 2XL hoping it would be over sized. It barely zips. Aside from it being a small fit, it's exactly what I would have wanted."
2.0,fit ok but they were not flattering at all. Showed every lump and bump on my thighs and were baggy at the knee. They just weren't attrative on me so I returned them.
2.0,Not a good glass. Design started peeling off within a couple of days of use
2.0,I am disappointed. 1 part off the band fit perfectly. The other part would not fit.  The company sent a new one and it did not fit.  I had to use the old band on one end and the new band on the other end.  I had other people try to get it on and they could not.
2.0,"These fit awesome straight out of the package. After only only one wash, the upper portion of the tank shrank and the lower portion stretched out to approximately twice the size that it was before. Too bad because the price was right and I was ready to buy more."
2.0,"I received my package in a timely manner, but when I opened it up and tried it on, one of the straps around the chest were sewed together incorrectly! One side is twisted, while the other side is completely okay! I was disappointed! The shirt was cute!"
2.0,"Comfortable but boring, fresh produce blue and periwinkle  colors fade even with (very) careful washing(cold, hand wash, rack dry)."
2.0,missing a rhinestone on the necklace..
2.0,"the fabric is beautiful but this is a child's size, not for real american women."
2.0,",Sobre el color es el mismo  ,pero la altura era muy corta y eso que yo soy pequeña mido 1.60 m , y de ancho era muy ancha , no me gusto el ajuste , el corte Ni el corte de la bata ,y No me agrado como se veía  puesto por eso decidí devolver e intentar con otra marca ."
2.0,"This did not fit my Gear fit2, I could not get the bands to snap in place. I tried each band on each side and it just wouldn't snap into place.<br />I gave two stars because it was a nice band and I like the color, they just wouldn't fit the device. I read other reviews where people were having the same issue, so I know it wasn't me. I also ordered another band along with this one, from a different company, and it fit nicely. It's definetly a defective product."
2.0,I ordered my size and they fit very tight. The return process was easy but be aware that they fit SMALL!!
2.0,They don't sit properly or comfortably on my face.
2.0,"Quality of material is cheap. Such a cute print though, too bad. I bought the raincoat with the same print and it was adorable. Much better fabric. I'm sending it back."
2.0,I WORRY IF THEY BREAK WHILE IM WEARING THEM THAT THERE WOULD B DAMAGE TO MY EYES
2.0,"I wanted to love this, but the pattern was not as shown and there were some pulls in the fabric that would have become holes very quickly. It didn’t look nice when it was on because the pattern was strange. I was disappointed because it looked so cute in the pictures but I had to return it"
2.0,It broke the 1st week
2.0,Nothing physically  wrong with the piece except it is way too big for any of the medium sized cuffs in my collection. Had to return it because it is really too large. Not sure what they had in mind.
2.0,"I ordered these thinking they would be a high waisted legging and they are not! They're not comfortable at all and don't control the tummy a bit. The material feels nice and they're not see through at all though. I feel like these might be sized for children. Im not tall and these didn't even go to my bellybutton. I ordered the medium and I usually wear a small and sometimes medium, depending on the brand. I assumed these would fit according to the size chart but they do not. They also seem to fit lower in the backside so when I squat down my rear end comes out substantially. I do not recommend these, nor will I be buying anymore in the future."
2.0,Clunky and a bit too wide for some pants.
2.0,"After a few days of use, the ring attaching the strap to purse broke."
2.0,Necklace arrived with 2 broken loops in the chain.  Got a replacement sent which is intact (so far)
2.0,"Purchased for my father and he said he couldn't see out of them, so we returned them!"
2.0,My husband doesn’t like these socks. It’s  uncomfortable for his feet and his feet stink after wearing these socks.
2.0,I got the colored part but I did not get the white part of the dress I don’t usually like giving bad reviews but I paid $40 for only part of the dress. I don’t recommend if you have to have the dress as soon as it can come like me. I was going to wear this to renaissance fest but I can’t now. Don’t really recommend.
2.0,"I was got fooled by believing it's a darker shade of pink. Towards magenta, l presume. But reality was bad. It's pop pink...real baby pink. You cannot walk that highlighted on streets. The only good feature is that the material is good. I'm gonna pair the top with a blue denims while the lower bright pink pants are reserved for lounging strictly."
2.0,We thought we ordered a 3pack but apparently once you change the size the packaging type changes. Ended up with only 1 tank top for the same price as 3 in a different size. The shirt itself is fine. Seemed to help out child sleep through the night.
2.0,"hated the fit, did not like the material. wasn't any give in material and the colors and design fade as it stretches a little bit and looked aweful"
2.0,I got the blue camo color and they are NOT squat proof because they're made of a THIN material compared to other brands that I have recently bought off here.  They are not that slimming either due to the thin material. These are not for me.
2.0,"I really liked this watch band but it stopped staying connected to the watch in only a couple months. Other watchbands I've had lasted years+. I think the new design of the connection to the watch is part of the problem, the plastic lip on this band is just too thin and bound to break over time. I guess for the price and for a short period of time it's still worth it. But I wouldn't buy again."
2.0,Thumbs keep freezing! Nothing to cover them - poor design.
2.0,"Grand daughter loved these shoes but some of the ""jewels"" came off right away. Not the best quality."
2.0,"This is a really cute shirt and fits me well.  I am busty - usually wear an XL but a L fits great.  Problem is 1) I wore it one day and the entire bottom hem has unraveled already (haven't even washed it yet) and 2) the color is NOTHING like the picture.  It's sort of a muted olive green.  It's not a bad color but nowhere near as bold and ""green"" as in the picture.  Based on fit, I would definitely order more but quality is poor."
2.0,"This is so form fitting that if you have an lumps or bumps at all, they will show"
2.0,"They don’t fit very tight. They way they were packaged, I ended up cutting the side of one of the gloves."
2.0,The image shows a gold tone earing and this was silver.  Disappointed that it isn't gold.  Still a nice earing but not as advertised
2.0,The glasses were darker colored than expected. They leave dark marks on the sides of my nose as if the black color on inside of glasses rubs off.
2.0,"Elastic pull tie doesn’t hold its place, the mask falls unless you’ve got it anchored to your face with glasses"
2.0,"Pretty for an extra short wide waist person, wide and short length skims jean waistband not as pictured"
2.0,way to big for me.  Had to send them back
2.0,"Am tall, these were too short"
2.0,"Love the dress but it runs large, buyer beware of size as they order. Allow for more in hips and bust than normal."
2.0,I purchase this band in May and by July the band  keeps falling apart. I stop wearing my Gear fit for fear of losing it. I cannot send it back because the deadline for returns was in June.
2.0,Too large and blousy. Returned item.
2.0,"I just got it. The chain is a little short fo my taste, but the real problem is that it is not rotable. Feel kind of cheated."
2.0,I usually wear a US 12 or large so I ordered a large based on the reviews. However this dress was way too tight. The shoulder also lay funny. I liked the scallop bottom. Returned but there is no size XL.
2.0,This dress looked terrible on me!  Sent it back
2.0,Way too big for any child in ankle area. Like they're stretched out.
2.0,It essentially rubbed off the tarnish from my jewelry onto my hands.  Once used there doesn't seem to be a way to reuse the same areas. Can't get into the nooks of some of my more detailed jewelry and actually left a piece of cloth wedged in my Tiffany mesh bracelet :-(  The liquids seem to work better.
2.0,Bad Material!
2.0,It is too short and the side slits go up too far. I will wear tanks or camisole under it.
2.0,To small and made strangely
2.0,"Cute idea but runs very small,  I bought the XL (I'm a size 10) and after being washed it fit my daughter perfectly,  she's a size 2.  That should tell you just how small this runs!"
2.0,just okay is not really okay
2.0,Not as fancy looking in the photos. Doesn’t hang off the shoulders and really is just a cotton pajamas style jumpsuit.
2.0,It would have been nice if they included pins so I could actually wear the damn band! So dissatisfied and disappointed 😞
2.0,"Product fits nicely but adhesive from protective liner is permanently adhered to the crotch and despite washing, can not be removed. Super bummed as this was a nice item otherwise."
2.0,This fit my body ok witch I'm 140 pounds and I'm 5'2 it was a little long also but the sleeves don't look like that . like they don't fold nicely down draping off your shoulder the way they do in the pic they lift up and it looks stupid. I do have thick arms but either way no girl! Plus p.s u cannot weir this without a belt it would look dumb!
2.0,"size is not exaxtly as informed, it is little smaller. and as you have to use this very stretch if you have this smaller is not confortable."
2.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this bag. But the body strap snapped roughly two weeks in. I only had a book and a wallet in it. Very sad.
2.0,"I'm currently working out and decided to buy a tank top for the workout.  First thing first, I was getting a Large one but it barely fits me.  The colors don't look the same as the pictures shown. They are not that bright more light. More importantly, it pills up quite often.  There is an obvious chemical odor from them."
2.0,"fabric very pretty ....but once it is washed -- even in cold water and hung on the line to dry --shrunk width wise and lengthwise.  It is now at least inches shorter than it was, and the entire thing shrunk at least 2 sizes....don't buy"
2.0,"Beautiful, but this mask will not protect you  from Covid 19... The material is to thin and loose.  Disappointed because if I wear this I would need to wear another mask for protection."
2.0,"These would be cute, but they are not wide-legged enough for my body style. I'm 5'9"", size 14, and teeter between 190-210 lbs. I've never had skinny legs, but apparently my thighs are too thick for these. They are tight on the hem and cut into my skin."
2.0,"The winter glove fitted a little small, but It didn’t matter. The zipper came right off! Poor workmanship!"
2.0,I bought this 3 sizes bigger then what I wear. The pants were fine but I felt like the stay puft marshmallow in the top! The color is blah.
2.0,"The fabric is so thin, that the first time I wore them they ripped!"
2.0,I was so excited when I got this and it looked so good.. within 2 weeks it peeled apart.. bummer.
2.0,"I ended up returning this because it did not match anything that my wife has. But overall, it is a beautiful wallet, she just couldn't use it."
2.0,"They should put some material on it so it will stay up by your bicep , they keep falling down."
2.0,"I ordered this 0 gage and by the time it arrived I had advanced to 00 gage, I don't use it.<br />I'll probably give it away to someone at that level"
2.0,Bought a size 2t honestly looks like it would fit a 9 month old. Very cute if it fit.
2.0,"I thought I would love this one, I love the color, and the style, but it looks better on the hanger than on me. The fabric is to clingy. and to thin, it shows EVERY SIN. LOL"
2.0,"Looks great, but it's really small for the computer."
2.0,Cant put together
2.0,"The design is very cute and it fit my wife well and looks good. However, it is very, very cheaply made. When it arrived it included a bunch of extra &#34;thread&#34; bunched up in the hole area and a couple of the coles were not punched all the way through. We will keep it as it looks good, but we don't expect it to last very long."
2.0,"I really liked these shorts.  I got the blue and the beige.  I wore the blue once without issue, but the first time I wore the beige, I squatted to pick something up from the floor and heard a ripping/popping sound.  The crotch had some rips in the seam.  So disappointing.  I really liked these, but obviously can't keep the blue ones either if not durable.  I guess thin and lightweight comes with price."
2.0,"I've had these shoes for a month and the stitching has come loose and the fabric already looks shabby.  They were very cute and comfortable, at first. After wearing them about 15 times, they arent in great shape. Not worth the cost."
2.0,The collar/neck of this fits weird. It feels as if they sewed it wrong. It isn't comfortable to wear.
2.0,"Runs big. I’m 205, 5’4” and XL was too big"
2.0,These are tiny and very cheaply made.
2.0,disappointed that it was already tarnished when I received it!
2.0,"Buena calidad, pero la talla es demasiado pequeña, no coincide con otras camisetas de  la misma talla"
2.0,Entirely too small for a 32D. Either my nipple isn't covered or the bottom half of my breast is not uncovered.
2.0,"These are fine quality, but I don't like them.  The elastic is too rough (it rubbed my skin raw and caused me to bleed) and too wide (they are highly visible through pants).  The clasps are strong, but very large and may be visible through pants.  The length adjustors are large nylon plastic pieces that would be more at home on a backpack than shirt garters."
2.0,"The shirt fits well in the body, but the sleeves are way too big! Does not fit right."
2.0,Leaf earrings not as nice in person. Got them a lot faster than expected BUT Gold & stones are dull compared to picture!
2.0,Way too small and thin but pretty pattern
2.0,Way smaller than expected and I ordered a size larger
2.0,I ordered a Med. I would size up if You want this.  I would’ve traded it for a size bigger but I didn’t like that it was form fitting as well
2.0,Earring missing a stone. Also earrings didn't close properly also won't stay on
2.0,"very disappointed... one earring was missing the clutch to keep it in my ear, so I cannabilized other earrings to wear them."
2.0,"bottom was the right size, the pot too big!"
2.0,Gloves ripped on the first day.  Not as thick/warm as wanted.
2.0,These are soft and fit good but really short and uncomfortable when they start to ride up
2.0,"Cheap all around, my son wanted it. Clasp doesnt stay shut"
2.0,"Look great at first, but print quickly rubs off and thin plastic covering rips. Also, 90% girlish prints."
2.0,I really did not like this dress. It may have just been because of the cut but it looked like I put a bed sheet on :/
2.0,Earrings are very thin and do not stay on my ears
2.0,No.  Just NO!  They fit VERY small and they are the material like Leotards.  NO.
2.0,Even if it’s a good price I would not recommend. Weird fit and doesn’t feel like a real cashmere sweater...
2.0,Bought these for our grandson who is not quite a year old. They fit him so tightly that he is afraid of them. There is no way to adjust the fit. I believe they would be great if they were adjustable for wear.
2.0,"Nice looking, but really dollar store qualified."
2.0,Well not long enough. I'm 5'9 128lbs very bad fit in length.
2.0,"Meh. Dress is okay, you should probably order a size up, it is body con for sure. If you order the light pink it is see through. I put it on and you could see my nipples (i am super fair skinned, my nipples are not dark)."
2.0,I bought this for my sister who is larger in the chest then I am but it was so small and tight that she couldn't use it. It is not good for large women
2.0,"Small, bad quality"
2.0,"I recommend getting a size up. I wish I could return them, but I missed the cutoff date. Overall very disappointed."
2.0,For starters this ring is really pretty and something that I wanted to love as I anticipated it’s arrival. The size is perfect and so attractive on.<br /><br />Now the cons. For starters the ring is incredibly thin and something that I don’t think would hold up over time. It will bend I’m sure with more use and it was also really light. Now I’ve attached a photo of the ring of the backing. It was not made in the U.S. also it looks like they tried to attempt to stamp it with .925 however it was done poorly and doesn’t seem authentic. I expected more for the price paid. This ring could be worth $15 at best! Not $34
2.0,"This purse was much much smaller than it looks on the picture. The color was more orange than brown, but for the most part the color was okay.  I was very disappointed in the size. The reason I bought it was because it looked so big.  The inside has a very crunchy sound. Not sure why.  Overall, if I saw this in the store I would have not bought it."
2.0,Ordered in a 5x (I wear a 22/24 at the bottom and an 18/20 on top) and it did not fit in a flattering way at all. I bought several variations of this item and I had to return them all.
2.0,Did not hang well. Clingy! Material to thin.
2.0,this bag is just ridiculously huge-for a &#34;purse&#34; shapeless like a gym bag.... perfect for a gym bag though! i sent it back
2.0,Way too big!!!  It fits as if it was a large and It swallows me.  Im using it as a night gown now.
2.0,Doesn't work well unless you wet it. Not worth returning but I wouldn't order again. I've had other silver cleaning clothes that worked much better dry than this works wet.
2.0,"Buckles both broke off. Cheap , poor design. Also weak elastic belt won't hold up heavy pants or if you carry anything on your belt like a multitool"
2.0,"Picture isn’t good quality. I expected this necklace to look a bit more rustic. The hole punched in the coin in rough and the chain links aren’t welded together. Shipping took a long time. I like the idea, but it wasn’t executed well."
2.0,"It may be a very nice watch, but it came without any instructions for setting the time or using any of its other functions and there are no instructions or manuals available online (Adidas' site is particularly unhelpful)."
2.0,"This is a well-made item, although I'm not sure how long the elasticized section would last.  They don't fit Glamorize No-Bounce Bras, as the hooks of the extender are set a fraction of an inch too far apart.  I had what could have been an embarrassing &#34;garment malfunction,&#34; with only one hook left in place.after a very short time of wearing it.  I tried twice more before I decided they simply weren't going to work.  If they fit your bra, fine.  They don't fit the Glamorize No-Bounce Bras."
2.0,Fit really weird and was somewhat large. Returned.
2.0,"I am a man with wrist measurement 7.0&#34; and this band is almost impossible to put on or take off. Furthermore it came with absolutely zero instructions and it took me 30 minutes to figure out how to work the clasp. I am writing this review now because I can't get it off to sync it (or charge it). I don't have any mama to put it on for me. On the other hand it looks really, really nice! I don't know if I will be able to keep it because the fit is so snug if my wrist ever swells I won't be able to fit it on. It fits so tight that I could wear it with the clasp open with no problem (except looks). I feel that the write-up stating it fits &#34;almost all wrists&#34; and that the maximum wrist size given as 7.2&#34; is incorrect. For the record I used a sewing type measuring tape to measure my wrist before purchase. It was exactly 7 inches. At least I won't have to worry about removing links. It seems like it might be fairly simple but again there were no instructions included in my product. Give serious thought regarding ordering this product if your wrist size is anywhere near maximum. Just noting, most men have larger wrists than mine. It looks great, the seller should be ashamed in providing no instructions with it, and be careful if your wrist size is anywhere near 7 inches."
2.0,"I have other Vionic shoes that I love, not these.  Shoes were very uncomfortable even with adjusting straps multiple times. Donated, hope someone can wear them."
2.0,"I was not very happy with this product.  It didn't even come in a normal costume bag.  It was VERY cheaply made and I was not impressed at all.<br />I guess I know next time that saving a couple dollars this is  what you would get.  I liked the cape, but that is the only thing.  It didn't fit very nice<br />and it was very cheaply made.  Of course, it is just a Halloween costume, so I guess I shouldn't be too harsh.  But if I could do it again, I would have paid a little higher to get better quality."
2.0,I gave this to my friend for Christmas and she sent me this picture a day after wearing it. She’s really upset. :( She loved it.
2.0,Unfortunately although Unisex they are too small for my fiance face.  Had to return them.
2.0,"First thing, the picture On Amazon makes the metal look gold, but what I received looks more rose gold. I’ve provided pictures, comparing my gold bracelet to the sunglasses. Now with that said, these are really beautiful sunglasses. They look very expensive, truly. They also feel high quality, the metal and lenses are on par with my $70 sunglasses. I’m not put off by the slight rose gold tint, they aren’t like cheap rose gold that looks very pink. The color kind of fools you a bit, like it looks rose gold but then in some light it doesn’t. I’m very happy with them, they are way better than another pair of aviator’s I bought on amazon and I want the silver ones now.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Sadly after only a few days one of the rivers which makes the design of these sunglasses has fallen off. Photo shows the issue."
2.0,A little tight at the toe
2.0,"I ordered a royal one, which based on all pictures is green colored, royal pine being blue again according to the pictures, but it seems that nope, the shirt I got was blue. So which one is which? I'm shipping internationally so these are costly mistakes for me!"
2.0,Just FYI... Seriously sent this as a gift and didn't see white on the Sweatshirt AND pants. Looks like a Santa Suit and it's now in another country so no returns.
2.0,It's a flimsy plastic lens that hurt my eyes! Other than that they look cool!
2.0,"Crazy soft which was amazing, but the neck was so stiff.  I returned it.  The only way to wear it was all the way buttoned up.  When unbuttoned it kept it's tight around the neck shape and didn't fold down nicely like in the picture.  If you still decide to try it I suggest sizing up...maybe even two sizes if you want a nice, loose fit."
2.0,Product is bigger then what i expected for Medium its long and it doesn't have a tag and looks like someone made this at home.<br />Have not worn it yet.
2.0,"Positive: As an Air Force family we love the design, especially the bold colors, on these pants. I bought a pair for my daughter and another for my son. They both love how comfortable and breathable they are. Negative: the 2nd time my son wore his we noticed a spot that seemed to be coming apart in the leg. We chalked it up to he is 10 and must have done something to cause the defective. But it wasn't long after that my 20 year old started noticing the same thing with hers. So despite the positives we opted not to buy more for ourselves. Disappointed  because we look for every opportunity to boldy support our Airman."
2.0,"I bought these socks because my feet are always cold, wore a pair all day and feet were cold ALL day. Waste of money!!!!"
2.0,"This is a thin, cheap material that is comfortable for sleeping in but it is no way a compression garment."
2.0,"The men's style is better than the women's, but they look cheap. I won't wear them. Oh well; at least they weren't expensive!"
2.0,The purse was very well made just not what I thought
2.0,"The colors and patterns are nice, my son was super excited but the loops don’t stay around his ears. Each one, falls off constantly! Poor design, no way to tighten ear loops"
2.0,"Perfect watch for my father, light weight, can see the dials, and can hear the time when he needs, no batteries to worry about, and he doesn’t have to set the time….which is the problem.  Arizona does not observe Daylight Savings time, but I knew this before buying this watch.  The instructions showed how to manually set the zone. I figured I could set that for him twice a year, but that too changes automatically every night in the early morning.  Company has not e-mailed me back to tell if there is an option to turn the automatic time zone off.  So my father has a nice watch that has the correct time 6 months out of the year."
2.0,Had to give them away.
2.0,"Very thin material, not sure how they will hold up.  I have several other pair of threads and these are the flimsiest ones I have ordered."
2.0,Item arrived damaged.  The weld on one side of the nose cross member had broken off.  Glasses are not usable.  Not sure if this is a product durability or a shipping/handling issue (or a combination of both).
2.0,"These are quite pretty, but the chains are not the same length."
2.0,"The fabric was nice enough, but the removable pads were terrible.  They were small and oddly shaped.  I can’t imagine what body shape would wear these.  They had to go back."
2.0,"So, size for a small person is perfect. I am active and it stays in place. The problem with this is the mesh edge catches on everything. I ripped two sleeves in the first 2 days. Other than that, it was good."
2.0,"I have another set from Soly Hux exactly like these just different colors. I got an XL and XXL, the XL fit better, so when I ordered these I got an XL and I literally can’t pull them over my knee thighs they are TINY. So disappointed not sure what the difference in the sizing is when they are the exact same product just different colors"
2.0,"These look different from images,  especially white howlite plugs that are totally bright white with no dark veins like what is seen in images. One of my green plus has jagged edges and a split on the front, and it's not usable. They were cheap enough that I'm not going to return them, but i would caution other buyers"
2.0,"These earrings are very nice, but the size of them were very deceiving.  These earrings are so tiny that you can barely see the black & white diamonds.  I was truly disappointed when I received them.  I am debating whether or not to return them."
2.0,"Bought the rose gold, didn’t understand how to take the links out but that’s ok, I thought the rose gold looked very shiny and cheap."
2.0,"The &#34;Golden&#34; color is very fake looking in real life.  They did not stretch to a 3x size for me but would fit smaller sizes I suppose.  However, the latch is a fairly flimsy non-locking (just fits and rests there) clasp so I think it's got a good chance of popping off with any bending over or considerable movement."
2.0,"This product is terrible. Doesn't have the words on it like the picture. The panties look the same in the front and the back so you can't even tell which way they are supposed to go on! The bra ripped as soon as I took it out the package. The panties are ridiculously small and the bra is too big. I will be contacting the seller and if I get a response I will update review<br /><br />5/18: seller did return my request and sent me a replacement, which was slightly better but still a sub par product"
2.0,"My baby has had this coat one month as it was a gift for Christmas. Already the hem holding the right sleeve to the coat ripped as it looks like a result of poor stitching. Also, inside on the fleece around that same area the white fleece came apart at the hem. Also poor stitching."
2.0,"Very pretty and the right size for what I needed, but I wore them once and had to glue the flower back onto the post."
2.0,I though it was long. But no it’s short
2.0,Liked them but when I cleaned them all the paint came off the white ones.
2.0,The umpire waist hit right in the middle of my chest not below. It was extremely tight through the chest as well. fit like a small or medium. I had ordered a large. Very long which if that were the only problem would be fixable.
2.0,"Although this product claims to be 4 ounces, my bottle says 2 ounces."
2.0,"Unwearable. I usually buy ONeill wetsuits, but tried this for cost. Cost is good, appearance is nice, but the chemical stench is unbearable.<br /><br />Also, I would order a size up."
2.0,This will work for a headband but it is not thick enough even doubled for a mask. I can easily blow a lighter flame out through the mask doubled and tripled. Was hoping these would work.
2.0,"The product I received does not seem to have the same cut as the product pictured--it's closer to granny panty than boyish. More importantly, I did not receive a variety of colors and prints as the picture depicts. I got four sets of the same three pairs."
2.0,A little too small and not meant for people with boobs. The cups were definitely too little. I returned it
2.0,"The color of the bag was okay, but within a few weeks the inside lining started fraying and falling apart."
2.0,Did not turn dark in sunlight.
2.0,The design is the same as the photo. Very soft fabric. the size M I get big
2.0,They snagged and ran the first time I wore them. Comfy but really thin material
2.0,I bought magnetic lashes and have had a difficult time trying to use them so I tried this. This eyeliner made the lashes even harder to apply and it was really a struggle trying to remove.
2.0,"Band was too large for my wrist, stones were dull, some missing, metal was cheap and caused my wrist to become red & irritated. Not worth the money or worth wearing. So disappointed."
2.0,"The belt would be so cute but unfortunately, the pictures advertise GOLD buckle and i received a SILVER buckle. I contracted the seller and they told me the buckle is “Gold with a Silver finish” who has ever heard of that?? They continued to tell me that the pictures i sent are Gold which clearly are not. Very disappointed on that part."
2.0,Cute but they sent me an XL when I ordered a Medium .
2.0,Runs a little bit small. Would be really cute if it wasn’t totally see through ...
2.0,Confortable but where bent
2.0,Love everything about this umbrella except for the handle which is so uncomfortable I had to return the device. Holding the handle for more than 30 seconds is painful. The shape is 100% not ergonomic. I recommend one of their other offerings as the company truly makes great umbrellas.
2.0,"It isn't the way I expected.zipper if you are super gentle or moving slow, right away will brake apart."
2.0,"The product that was sent to me did not match the picture. The short were way to large, and they were made of low quality denim."
2.0,Took forever to get to me but I really enjoy the watch.
2.0,"Poor quality, but cute pattern. Really thin, no-stretch material, and it’s cut super weird. It’s like you’re not meant to sit in them if you have a butt at all. It pulls on the front of my thighs which may not bother everyone, but it definitely bothers me. I wouldn’t recommend or reorder, but it’s not worth the time sending back imo."
2.0,Was disappointed because the necklace came in broken with numerous pearls broken off.  It also came from China which I was not expecting and no information inside the package to return the item.  The necklace itself did look exactly like one on TV I just wish it had not been broken.
2.0,"I ordered a two pack. The case with the composite look, has an Unbearable Odor and is Not usable! The size and look of the other case is great."
2.0,I am a slim size 4 and the arms were still tight.
2.0,I ordered this in Blue01 (speckled blue) and received it in Blue02 which was not at all as cute as the photo in the listing. Unfortunately I wanted to wear this on an island and didn’t even bring it with.
2.0,Liked the bracelets but fell apart within 2 months .. the leather braid came unattached from the catch.
2.0,"I ordered this item last night. I received it today. I also ordered it in purple color. When comparing both colors, the first difference is the thickness of this item compared to the item in purple. The purple item is thick and seem to be 100% leather. This item in black is thin and does not have the appearance and texture of leather. The second difference is the word &#34;passport&#34; in front. The purple item has that word on the front. While this item does not. I know its just a word but it definitely is not accurate with the image that I saw last night while I was ordering it. I dont have time to return it. I am against time so I dont think this item is worth its price compared to the purple item."
2.0,They hurt between my toes. Definitely couldn’t be worn for any actual walking around. Thankfully I just needed these as gym sandals for the locker room.
2.0,"Bought these to replace the ugly flowered ones that came in the pack... However, the product that these bands are suppose to carry\retain fell out and was lost. Was a waste of $50-60 dollars, and a large disappointment."
2.0,"Had initially rated this higher but had to return to revise the rating and comment. Started off well... could see clear as day with the goggles under water. After about 2 weeks of use every other day, they are now constantly fogging up. Can't even go 25 yards with no fog. The ear plugs are completely useless. Don't even get me started on the nose clip... slides off easier than it slides on. Smh! Disappointing. 2 star rating for delivery time, packaging, and UV protection."
2.0,"Altho pretty, when I gave it as a Christmas gift, when trying to put it on, it broke.  Is a refund possible?"
2.0,"Feels like I'm wearing a tent, doesn't hang well, not flattering."
2.0,"Looks great when it arrived, just as pictured. It seems like the part that holds keys was spray painted black as it was painted stuck together, so in order for my husband to get his keys to go on it he had to run a knife along it to separate it. The little o-ring/chain piece that squirtle is attached with is really bad and causes him to fall off constantly. My husband finally lost squirtle today while running errands.... So.... He lasted roughly 3 weeks...."
2.0,"Very small. I have average, if not slightly small hands and these RIP at the 'seams' when my hand is anything but flat open."
2.0,Not satisfied. Before you buy this product please make sure that there are many other brands where you get better product with this price.
2.0,I prefer a x large the pants are to big and the shirt was too small. Will never buy again. Waste of my money. It looks way better On the internet.
2.0,This items seems to run big. I ordered my normal legging size and these ones are loose fitting
2.0,For someone who is long torso this will never work for you.  The fit was not good.
2.0,"I am so disappointed in this purchase.  Ten months after purchasing a bag that I don't even carry every day, the leather is so worn that it looks like it was bought at a thrift shop. I don't mean the kind of wear that makes it look &#34;vintage&#34;; I mean the kind of wear that makes it look cheap. The leather - or whatever material - along the bottom of the bag is peeling off. I can't believe that for the price, the bag won't even be usable for a year.  I've bought Hobo bags before and was really pleased, but I am sorry I bought this one."
2.0,"Looked real good on But, Was not very comfortable at all I sent them back to Amazon and got a refund"
2.0,"Got dirty fast, had to take it out cause my ear got super sensitive"
2.0,The bag this came in is nicer than the product.
2.0,"Not the color in the picture. Looks like a dark blue, almost navy. However it’s much brighter; like a Cobalt or royal blue. Bought shoes that ended up not matching. Otherwise, it’s cute. More of a sweater dress for casual play or going out than dressing up."
2.0,Comfortable but small and squeaky.
2.0,Dress came in after three months of waiting wrinkled with a small stain on the front and they are deducting the cost of the shipping label from my return. I never even tried it on to see if it fit. The fabric had a decent feel.
2.0,"The material is crunchy. Cute spring dress, but I have bought better. It was a gift for my daughter."
2.0,The rhinstones folling apart.
2.0,Sole too thin. No foot support.
2.0,Size small shipped in a xxl bag. Seeing it in person just made me want it more. Hopefully after my return i can order and receive the right size
2.0,"I purchased 3 compression socks from this seller. There isn't a size listed so I assumed it comes in standard woman shoe size which is 7-8. Extremely disappointed that all 3 socks are size 9-11. This should be listed in the product description! What a scam. I wear a size 7, but am supposed to wear a fat person sock. This explains the reviews of socks falling down. If they aren't tight enough to stay in place then they are NOT a compression sock."
2.0,No era la calidad esperada y venía sin remate (Ruedo) en la parte inferior
2.0,"I was very happy with the jersey initially, but after 4-5 washes the letters on the front are beginning to lift."
2.0,It was too small based on the measurements.
2.0,Looks great and protects the foot. Fabric on top very disappointing and immediately started to wear and pill on the top after one trip in a pool. Serious color fade too. The rainbow is my son’s fav and he loves them so I kept them. They may make it a few more uses. Poor quality.
2.0,The rubber part that holds them on your fingers either break or fall off the light. Constantly. Buy the more expensive ones. I gave them a 2 instead of 1 because the lights work well.
2.0,I wear a size 7 ring got my ring size at a jewelry store. When I received the ring it was way too small. I thought maybe I was just swollen so I had my mother try it cause she is also a size 7 per the jewelry stores. Didn't fit her either. Sending back. Really liked the look and design of the ring too which makes me sad.<br /><br />Update: seller contacted me about the size #7 being misleading. A new batch  is being made and I'm going to try again. Just waiting on the new ones to be done. Will update my review again once I get the new one.<br /><br />2nd update: 😑 ring is still too small. So done with it. They tried so I'll leave my review final review at 2 stars. If you get this ring be sure to order at LEAST 1 size up
2.0,I ordered a 3x but the jacket is mor like a 2x pants are fine
2.0,"I SO wanted these boots to be right-- I need them badly! And they looked, in the picture, just right. But the fabric is too cheap. It's like house slippers. It's flimsy and soft, not at all like boots should be, unless they're just to wear around the house. I was very disappointed in these boots because of what they're made of. Otherwise, they fit well and the heel was good."
2.0,Fit to big and didn't like the material sent it back
2.0,Purchased as gift to friend who works in a medical lab. She said it was comfortable but I felt the fabric was a bit thin and wasn't really wash and wear to my standards anyways. Too me it needed to be ironed. They have held up over months in the wash so I guess they are okay.. I just thought they would be of better quality. Just not really impressed.
2.0,"Luckily I didn’t let my daughter wear this dress before Halloween because at first use, we had a quarter size hole in the waistband. Now that she is wearing for the 3rd time, that hole goes across her whole body. Such crap.. buy something sturdier."
2.0,The photos are showing a fully puffed cropped vest. Instead I received a vest inside a vacuumed sealed bag. I took the vest out and let it sit for 2 days thinking it would fully puff but nope. It's still flat.
2.0,One I probably shouldn’t have taken. Within the first three days two of the five earrings were broken. I also found some of the clasps to be difficult to open and close. Forgive me for my untechnical jargon but the small doodads going into small holes was not my cup of tea. I didn’t have issue with the flares and one of the pit had a screw-in back so if you have an issue with flares you can swap them out for the screw-in as most of these are interchangeable.<br /><br />On a side note my toddler would give the big hoops 5 stars as it makes the game of yanking on mommy’s ears even more fun!
2.0,I didn't like that it look cheap
2.0,This item broke after  2 weeks and have no sparkle
2.0,"It works... I ordered the glasses and contact travel kit. The glasses case works well with my glasses, and it came with a cloth to clean them. The contact case comes with a built in mirror, the lens holder, solution bottle, tweezers, and contact applicator thingy.<br /><br />The problems are that the solution bottle is very hard to fill, and I wound up wasting a lot of solution. Also my contact case came dirty and I can't seem to get the stain off."
2.0,The top part of the glasses is blurry like it is prescription and the reader part is not as strong as it should be.  We ordered a 2.5 and it is more like a 2.  Would not order again.  Hard to order products like this without trying them on first.
2.0,"It's a pretty product and if you had a wrist like a 2 year old, it'll fit without cutting into you. However, anyone that has a wrist larger than 5&#34; (which is the same category as the smallest Fitbit you can buy), it will cut into your wrist painfully. The elastic inside is only good if it doesn't separate the plates. This is not for teenagers or adults, so I'm not sure the target audience.<br /><br />Again, beautiful, wearable without serious modification, no."
2.0,Much smaller and shorter than expected.
2.0,She likes it but it don't look like a leggings outfit what she likes
2.0,I bought this believing that it would be amazing and lifting as well as reducing the extra skin bulge that happens below the bra in the back.  This bra goes on like a sports bra.  It is very pretty but I didnt think it lifted any better than my other bras or even my sports bras.  It also seemed to just push the back bulge down not necessarily lessen it.  I ordered a size up and could have ordered even one more size up.  It seemed a little small.  It wasnt worth the money and didnt do anything spectacular.
2.0,"This dress is cute. However, the dress is made from cheap thin fabric. I would not consider this as a semi formal dress but more as a party or date night dress. If you are looking for quality this is definitely not the dress you would want to purchase. However if you are looking for a fun inexpensive dress that you will only wear once in your life then this is the dress for you."
2.0,"Came completely wrinkled and was a small fit . Made out of thin t- shirt material, but not well made . It also shrank considerably even on delicate cycles."
2.0,"Used and washed for over 1 year now, the pants still come off with black dye, constantly stains other clothes."
2.0,"Too small, not like in description"
2.0,Tried to put them on and the backs bent. Not at all what I was expecting :(
2.0,Does not keep hand warm.
2.0,Not long after one trip through dryer too short
2.0,"I purchased this to save a little money over the Columbia brands.....also delivery estimate was better.  It is a nice packable jacket, but the down feathers continuously poke through the jacket.  It met the needs to fit under other clothing as a double layer, but don't expect it to last much longer."
2.0,"Broke instantly, but I got a gold tone jump ring and fixed it myself.  Kind of heavy, but pretty."
2.0,Had to return.  Cute suit but the top gives no support if you over a c cup and was too large.  The bottom fit fine
2.0,"I was looking for a lightweight, comfortable dress to weather the heat wave.  This was definitely not it.  I should have looked more closely at the fabric content (95% polyester, 5% spandex).  It felt uncomfortable the minute I put it on (well, like spandex).  The fit was about as expected, and cut was flattering.  Will have to send it back and keep searching for a cool breathable cotton blend to wear in the heat."
2.0,Awkwardly shaped and very see through. More of a bathing suit cover-up than a dress.
2.0,I had to glue one of the earrings back together because they were broken.
2.0,I usually wear large but I guess this time I should have ordered medium
2.0,Make sure you order this way above your size range.
2.0,"The color was the same and the material is thick, was just too small."
2.0,"For the money, quality was OK. Did not receive color ordered. Color received was a dismal, muddy brown."
2.0,soles are not rubber but hard plastic - ugh.
2.0,"When I ordered it the description said full grain leather, when it arrived it said top grain leather. Hope it lasts as long as real leather."
2.0,"I ordered this dress in the medium white.The dress looks as shown but has an odd fit, the bottom is massive and shapeless (think an oversized slip skirt) and the top is quite small. The material is stretchy which would help with this if the material didn't show just about everything. You could very clearly see the outline of my bra when I tried on this dress. The material is similar to what you'd find on a woman's costume, pretty typical of stuff from China. Again, doesn't look terrible if it fits with your body. For reference I'm 5'8&#34; about 145 lbs with a size 32FFF chest. There were also small flaws, such as one of my tassel was red, but the rest in that order was pink. Finally, the dress had a smudge stain, like if someone had dropped it on a dusty floor. I'd probably be able to wash it out, but won't even bother as I won't be keeping it."
2.0,"My daughter liked this dress, however, she complained that it was itchy. After washing the dress, a lot of the stars came off and on all the clothes in the load. I would not buy this again."
2.0,The shirt fits okay and the fabric is fine. The screen printing is blurry. The seller's photo shows crisp color and definition. The actual shirt has a lot of &#34;bleed&#34; in the ink. Oh well. Next time I'll buy my souvenirs while I'm still on the trip!
2.0,Good product  one I got was wrong size.
2.0,"I feel misled, but do hold myself accountable for not reading thoroughly. The item description is &#34;Unique Arrow Open Finger Adjustable Ring Anniversary Engagement Gift 925 Silver Rings&#34; but in reading more, the metal is actually alloy instead of Silver. It is a ring, it is adjustable, it is NOT 925 silver."
2.0,The sleeves are way too big and constantly just keep falling. I was having to tuck the fabric under my bra strap to stay up and they still kept falling. The neckline is very wide so I had to wear a strapless bra so it wouldn’t Show. The top is also very short and fit like a crop top and I’m only 5’1”.
2.0,Not big enough for an adult male
2.0,I got the white and navy blue one. Looks exactly  like the pictures it’s really cute. Unfortunately if have a bigger butt you might as well be wearing a thong. It rides so low that it didn’t even cover my butt crack. I ended up returning it
2.0,The shirt is small due to material. And the graphic is not even centered on the shirt. It's off to the side.
2.0,"These look cute in BUT the color runs BAD in my hot pink one. Got all over the white one in the dual package and on my white towel, then it wouldn’t come out"
2.0,"Cute top, however, sleeves connect to bodice in an awkward way making arm movement seem constricted.  Chest area is not loose enough for my liking.  Made from material that will not shrink but not suitable for average to large busted women.  Regretfully, must return."
2.0,"I am 5’1” at 115 pounds and the medium is really small.  Compares to most of my extra small clothes. Otherwise, overall construction seems fine.  I might order a large to compare the difference."
2.0,very hard to open and close; some I still have not been able to open yet
2.0,material is like a child's costume from Walmart
2.0,"one of the earrings came broken, they do not come with earring backs, and the metal is very flimsy. I also though they would be bigger.<br /><br />i will say they are very cute though just wish they were nicer"
2.0,I really like Jack Wolfskin but this one was to small for me. Had to return.
2.0,Do not hold up well to use and washing
2.0,"The charm is nice but it won’t fit on my chain. I thought it would be smooth inside, but it wasn’t and won’t let me slide the chain through the charm."
2.0,Doesn’t feel like wool. Not warm. More a dress sock.
2.0,"This shirt runs small, ended up giving to my daughter"
2.0,"If I bought this shirt without previously buying from another buyer I may have liked it. However, I bought this product after getting the exact same shirt from a different buyer for more money. This shirt is NOT the same when it came to fit and quality as the other."
2.0,Liked color style didn't like it looked cheap
2.0,I'm going to have to send them back. So sad....
2.0,They were too small 😔
2.0,"I don’t understand why people think that just because you’re a “plus size” your ankles are also large. This new wide leg pants trend is making those of us above a size 6 look like those train riding hobos from the Great Depression. My ankles are normal sized! No woman ever said “this bread is going to to right to my ankles”. Please just make tapered pants taper down to the same size for every sized person. With that being said, the material was alright"
2.0,Fit was off. The bottom of the leggings were very baggy. Transparency was definitely there so that’s a no go from the get go. I ordered a 3x according to size chart but maybe sizing down would’ve helped (if they weren’t so see through).
2.0,"broke after three days, we are going to send it back for our money. My wife has Alex and Ani ones and you can tell the quality difference."
2.0,"The bag itself is really cute!! I bought it to go with a festival outfit, but it's not meant for jumping around in, especially if you have a decent amount of stuff in. mine tore on the side and a lot of stuff i needed slipped out because of that which is a bummer. on the bright side, i looked super cute with it on!"
2.0,"runs very small, especially in the sleeves"
2.0,lenses seem out of focus for me. Not a good value for $30.00.
2.0,The material looks different than in the picture.  It's really this weird stretchy textured fabric and the red isn't a bright red but more of a dark red.
2.0,"It's definitely smaller than I'd expected. I remember seeing that I needed to size up. I'm 6 foot, so I know I'm tall, but I usually wear a medium. I got a large. The large was way too small. My arms looked like Pillsbury doughboy biscuits right when you try to open them from the canister and the tube pops. The shoulders were so tight, I could've (and should've) incredibly hulked out of. I guess order up two sizes? It's a thin material and breathable, which is great. That's why I gave it a 2 star instead of 1."
2.0,Out of two pairs one has wat looks like r<br />Left over super glue on the part that rests on your ear cord is two short
2.0,Haven't had a chance to try it out but not what I expected and cheaply made
2.0,"The necklace is very delicate and beautiful. My Mom loved it, but unfortunately after only wearing a few amount of times after Christmas 2017 until now, the clasp broke today on the chain. Very disappointing."
2.0,There’s no reflecting light o any other way to see the time with low light
2.0,"Quality-wise, this is a very cool little corset. It seems well put together, and doesn't look cheap at all. The problem is the size chart. It is WAY off. I ordered the exact recommended size for my waist measurement, and there is no way this thing is going to fit me. Even with the laces completely undone, it's not going to work. Unfortunately this means I can't wear it, and since it wasn't shipped from Amazon, returning it isn't really an option. Oh well. If you want to get this, size way up.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
2.0,"The hoodie itself is fine. Unfortunate, the pink color posted is not the pink I received."
2.0,Work well at first spray. But not as well on subsequent uses. Would not buy again.
2.0,"I like the necklace, but it turns green."
2.0,Unfortunately 80% Polyester- not mostly cotton as stated in the listing. I wish it was a nicer quality material because it would be cozy!
2.0,I really really loved this coat. However… I don’t know if the zipper itself was faulty or if this coat is not made for people who are short. But the zipper split the second time I wore it from the bottom up and continues to split every time I try to wear it.  Incredibly disappointing for an expensive coat. And because I ordered it earlier in the season I am not able to return it after I have now tried to wear it in the colder season. And I can find no where to contact the sellers.
2.0,"Bought this sweatshirt in this color because it was advertised as 100% Cotton. However, garment label says 50/50 cotton/poly. It fits husband well, so we will keep, since weather turned cold, we’re moving soon & all other warm clothing is packed. But I DETEST misrepresentation."
2.0,It's cute but it's not hardy.
2.0,Material not as expected & runs large. Had to return.
2.0,"From the reviews, I expected this to be closer to knee length, but it's pretty short (I'm 5'7""). I was hoping to wear it to work, but probably not without leggings. The material is more dressy than I expected, but I cute.  The neckline and fit is great, but the material tore after a few wears, not in a fixable way. I probably wore it a handful of times."
2.0,Hope it last
2.0,"This dress fabric is so cute, but not at all stretchy, and you will want to order a couple of sizes up.  Also, the sewn on bow on the top is not centered, so I would have had to take it off and resew it myself.  Sending this back, and buying two sizes up!"
2.0,"This took well over a month to arrive after placing an order (China). The quality is pretty poor. The color of the sleeves and cuffs is washed out, especially on the cuffs, so it's not even red. But the picture is so damn cute. Not worth the money or time, but cute."
2.0,"Love the shirt, but after ONE wash the lettering started to fade into a yellowish color and spots showed on the letters. The shirt is perfect if you dont plan on washing it :/"
2.0,"I am returning this skirt, it looks nice on picture but very thin cheaper looking material. Not what I saw or thought at all, sorry."
2.0,Too small! They are tight and also do not fit my long (and chubby) torso.
2.0,Wasn't a quality piece
2.0,"EDIT: Purchased in September. By January, the stone had fallen out. Thumbs down.<br /><br />Very cute. I'm happy with this purchase."
2.0,Slides up and down. Mostly down. Nice fabric but bad design  Should have small - medium - large for better fit.  I’m 5’4”. 130 lbs. they are too small and too short.  Would never make it to yoga
2.0,the shirt was cut small for a 2XL shirt. I usually buy XL
2.0,"The bag looks great; however, it is advertised for a 15&#34; laptop... a 15&#34; laptop will fit inside the bag but it will NOT fit inside the dedicated laptop slot within the bag..."
2.0,The jacket was very small. It was like a junior size. I usually wear a large order extra large.
2.0,"I got the green one & colors are beautiful! I wear a Large but ordered an XL after reading the reviews- well it's very Huggy! I think I should have gotten the 2X. I will say, it wasn't worth $25 to me, but maybe it was all the colors, just a bit cheaply made. You'd def need a gurtle or spanx because it shows it All! Order 2 sizes up!"
2.0,This bracelet fell apart a few weeks after my friend wore it and now I cannot appear to be able to exchange it.  The string shredded till it broke.  You said you would get back with me weeks ago. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I will never purchase from you again.  People if you want a poor quality product along with terrible customer service here it is.
2.0,"The watch is really pretty but the leather band is chipping after only 5 weeks of wearing it, and I had an office job that’s not strenuous."
2.0,"A small and large band was ordered to replace the bands my wife and I had since they were fraying shirt fabric in our clothes after only about 6 - 8 months of use.  My band is still doing great, and  I love the ease of the metal mesh band that fits my Fitbit.  However, my wife's band is already fraying on the sides and has started cutting the fabric in the wrists of her clothes within just a few days of purchase.  This is certainly next acceptable and will need to be returned."
2.0,No what I expected. The material is shiny.
2.0,Product runs small. My daughter was only able to wear it maybe a month
2.0,I had to exchange pins from another ba ND. The ones in this band were a hair short to stay in watch. They pulled out with barely a tug.
2.0,"While the pin is very pretty, it is presented as being much larger than it actually is.  It is only about an inch and a half.  The pictures of the women wearing the pin make it appear much larger.  Seems to be a camera trick."
2.0,Low quality wore it for maybe a month before it changed colors and broke both of them
2.0,"I wanted to like this dress.  But, the color is more of a pink & sort of looks grandma'ish.  Plus, the wrap around would be very difficult to wear w/o adding some safety pins!  Had to return."
2.0,It’s a beautiful dress. I ordered a medium and couldn’t even get it over my shoulders. Order at least 2 sizes bigger
2.0,"I ordered this hat in the blue color. I really liked the color on the picture BUT once I received it, it didn't look as pictured. I was expecting it to match some shoes I bought (pictured below) but instead the color is more of a dark blue almost black. It's pretty and fits well but it's not the same color as it is in the photo"
2.0,As pretty as the dress was i washed it one time and it stink so bad it's now just a regular dress. Ordered extra large....tried it on. Prefect until it was washed. Won't buy or order here again.
2.0,"I love the watch itself, but it doesn't work. I have tried every thing I can think of to get it to tick.  I know it was not a tremendous cost, but I have purchased watches for less that have worked for years. I am very disappointed."
2.0,"Will never wear, fit really weird"
2.0,The hatchet is a good idea but just didn't fit my head.
2.0,beautiful watch love the look but the quality of the watch is very poor I received the watch the latch that secures the watch continuously opens with out warning so if not paying attention you will loose the watch. Sense I purchased the watch from amazon the company has no record of me buying the watch so getting it repaired or replaced is next to impossible. It did say on the paperwork that comes with the watch there is a factory warranty but I feel like its a lost cause
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:1e2ad1f2da28968abffe3c3a92289010]] Top button came torn off, and the shirt is very large and baggy. Maybe if I had DD’s it would fit, but the front just gapes open on me. Wrinkles horribly in the back."
2.0,Eye openings are set way too far apart. You have to cock your head sideways to see where you're going.  This is a tripping/ falling hazard.  Express delivery (EMS) was a waste of money. Not a day faster than original delivery date and cost an extra $45. Could have been a good costume with a bit attention on the manufacturing side.
2.0,Bought this for my boyfriend and I don't even wanna give it to him. Very xrappy
2.0,"They’re cute, but almost immediately turned my skin green."
2.0,"This was WAY too big. Bought a small, fit like a large. Everything else was fine on it: decorations, fabric, all good. Disappointed in the sizing."
2.0,"When worn, only one arm of the glasses is in circle.  The other arm hangs out.  When you bend down, they fall out of the circle."
2.0,Pink color is not pink. More like a pale skin color which the 6 yr old girl does NOT like
2.0,Nice quality material but ridiculously small for an extra large. I would have guessed they were a small or medium but they were labeled extra large. Also knee area was wide. My daughter who is smaller wouldn't keep them because of wide/baggy knees.
2.0,"Not the watch from the picture which was disappointing, but still a very nice watch. Would really like to have the watch from the picture"
2.0,Delivered with stitching and inseam issues also had a hole dress looks like it could be nice with thicker material.
2.0,"I was so excited. They are exactly the perfect size for my second hole and I love the look.  However, I cannot keep them in all the time as I had anticipated because they make my whole earlobe red, hot, and itchy :("
2.0,"So I actually really loved these gloves when I received them! They are warm, functional, and not too bulky. But after wearing them for about a week, one of the leather bows came off and took the side stitching with it and now there’s a huge hole. This happened after just one week of normal wear, nothing crazy. I really loved these and with some reinforced stitching would recommend, but I have cold hands now. :("
2.0,I put these to the test and they fogged very badly putting me at risk actually. I get in the store I cannot see a thing and it was worse than with my ugly safety glasses. There is a huge open gap in the side of these glasses so there is not much safety on the side. These were even kind of blurry to wear to do normal tasks. I'm disappointed being left with the ugly glasses. These are not worth $20 when they don't really work.
2.0,Cheap and too small!! Do not buy these
2.0,Rose gold turned yellow pretty quick.
2.0,Color is perfect match to picture and the structure is nice too but it is so very very small with almost no give that I doubt I will ear it much.  Felt like a workout just getting it on.  I am a 34 and ordered a large :(
2.0,The short too small
2.0,Delivered one item even though advertised as a 2 pack. Product itself is fine. Only two stars for incorrect listing and waste of my time waiting for second order.
2.0,"I bought this dress in a M and  L. I normally wear size M but sometimes can wear L, so i bought both just to be safe.  Both the M and the L were too small. I couldnt even get the L zipped up. I returned both of them."
2.0,I bout 2 of these (1V and 1RM) as a Christmas present for my girls who are huge BTS fans. Very dissapointed in the product. The materual is very thin (the kind that sticks together during washes and creates static). Its not worth more than $12/each. Can get better material from Walmart and make it myself if I knew this was what I was getting.
2.0,"I wanted to love the dress but it was just too boxy. I bought it to wear during pregnancy, but it was not very flattering. It hung wide and I felt like I was wearing a tent. Maybe it’s just not a good cut for me and my growing belly, but I don’t think I would have like it regardless. I’m 5’6”, and weigh 140 pregnant."
2.0,Stopped working after a few days which wasn't all that bad because I saw it more as a bracelet then a time keeping piece. The minutes aren't the clearest to see and the skull design could probably stand out more as it kind of blends in. I don't wear it anymore but it's ok to keep as bracelet if it happens to match what I may be wearing.
2.0,The belt is WAY too small.  It's more like a &#34;thigh&#34; belt!  Made for someone with a 16&#34; waist!
2.0,I really wanted to like this wallet but it doesn't appear to block RFID and after using it for a little over a month it came apart. There is some sort of adhesive inside the wallet that made most of my cards sticky and I ended up throwing it out and going back to my Sharkk wallet.
2.0,Poorly made and an awkward size
2.0,"Nice concept, but needed a zipper or elastic in the shaft of the boot so she could get her feet into them."
2.0,The shower shoes are too narrow and tight fitting for easy donning. A shower shoe should be easy to fit on without reaching down with your hands or sitting down to fit them on with your hands. A person should be able to practically walk into them without reaching down to help them on. I have a normal size 10 foot. The shower shoes is manufactured too tight.
2.0,The earrings are not the same size
2.0,"I really wanted to love these rings, they are a beautiful rose gold tone and they fit with my minimalist style. The reason these are getting a 2 star rating is because they gave me an allergic reaction after the first time I put one of them on. I don't know if it's the metal they use or maybe some kind of protective coating but it was awful and I'm returning them for a refund."
2.0,Will keep.
2.0,"Pros:<br />Fit is good.<br />You can move well with it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Material very rough on the skin.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br />I used it to lift some weights and, on the treadmill, but it got my skin rough so I don't think I will keep using it for exercise. It is a shame, since it looks good."
2.0,"First off: the sleeves!  They are not batwing.  The are boxy, wide, and extremely loose.  There is no cuff of any sort, or even thinning of the sleeves, when they hit your wrist.  As a result, the sleeves just dangle. You can't push them up.  The only thing you might could do with them is roll them into wide stretched out rolls to get them up to your elbows.  The fit of the sweater is the same.  For once, not scrunchy and round, but instead just one big wide loose rectangle.  Super unflattering."
2.0,"Buy something else if you plan to put a valuable watch on these straps!<br /><br />I’ve waited for around 2 months to post this review to make triple sure how I felt.<br />These straps seem like a good idea but are not!!<br />Unless you have a cheap watch with little value.<br /><br />I put my $800 watch on these and nearly lost the watch 3 times bc the strap mechanism on the bottom is too easy to work!<br /><br />This is one of my prized possession, legacy watches and to think I almost lost it multiple times!<br /><br />Don’t buy this product.  The leather seems to shrink around the pins and comes loose easily and you WILL LOSE YOUR WATCH!"
2.0,"Shirt is cute, although different than it looks on picture, not as off the shoulder as it appears, narrow neck"
2.0,"This is a very nice purse but a month out of buying it, the loopy threads are coming out and the butterfly has fallen off the front---an important part of the design.<br />I like this purse but now need to try and fix it.<br />This shouldn't be, just a month after the return date, the purse starts falling apart."
2.0,"Love the shorts, but like other reviewers, mine developed. a rip."
2.0,"Very dark color, looks almost black looks more like black-gray rather than blue and dull luster."
2.0,If your a very thin person then this is perfect.
2.0,"The shirt is a great idea for people with limited mobility such as I had after rotator cuff surgery.<br />However, the material is cheap and started pilling after just one use. Pretty pathetic given the fact these are not cheap shirts.<br />Great concept, poor material."
2.0,The product started to come apart so
2.0,clips on these are junk.  one looked like it had been crushed.
2.0,Hooking it is very difficult to clasp and thought leather went all around
2.0,IT BROKE THE FIRST TIME I TRIED TO TAKE A LINK OUT!!
2.0,I am as really surprised at how heavy it is. Its too big for my wrist so tends to fall off.
2.0,The dress didn't fit right
2.0,"They look really cute however within a couple of days of using them, the moon broke off and fell somewhere, making the earrings unusable"
2.0,The glue or heat treat used to make the edges are rough and make this band so uncomfortable that I cannot wear them. All I feel are tiny scratches throughout the day. It is like death by a thousand scratches.
2.0,Top was black and bottom was dark blue. Love the way it fit but color doesnt look right.
2.0,"The description says ""Universal"" , fits any AA Chip. Not True , I was just given my 10 year chip which is slightly larger than the usual ones and it is too big for this case."
2.0,Poor quality. Pilled the first time it was washed.  It shrunk too.
2.0,"Looks very nice, but Inner material is very cheap and uncomfortable if you're not wearing anything underneath, i expected it to be a tight fit since the other reviews say to get a larger size because it runs small, but i wore it and it was too large, made me look chubby.<br /><br />The pockets are not properly sewed onto the inside of the hoodie so if you're planning on carrying a phone or an MP3 player or anything that has weight, its just gonna dangle and shake inside the pockets as you walk/jog.<br /><br />Im a medium, ordered a medium because i run medium and got what appears to be a large fit for me.<br /><br />Also, when i tried to ask for a refund, they told me the refund would be more expensive than the actual hoodie itself and that its because they ship from china (im in California by the way). They were kind and asked me if i wanted at least a 10% refund back (which was 5$ in my case)  and i keep the hoodie, so thats what i agreed to, but in the end i got no money back because the card i used to buy the hoodie was deactivated before i asked for the refund. but no kind of currency ever showed up on my amazon account not even amazon points. Or my other card thats on my account.<br /><br />In the end, i guess a refund wasnt possible to begin with, i at least tried to return it. It has potential, it looks nice but the quality could be better. i have shared my experience. i wouldn't buy it again."
2.0,"My son loved them but they didn't last, they wore out after using them twice to the pool."
2.0,The material is cheap looking and it didn’t look exactly like the pictures.
2.0,"I wear a 61cm hat, which is always an XL in hats, so I ordered the XL of this, but it is way too big to wear.  I may have to pin or stitch it in the back to make it snug enough to wear.  Otherwise, it seems of good quality."
2.0,"I understand that you get what you pay for, but this watch is more cheaply made than a $12 watch from Walmart."
2.0,Looks really cute on but feels like I’m wearing sandpaper
2.0,Not at pictured. You get what you pay for. Material is stretchy like swim suit material and very thin. It could work as a swimsuit cover up.
2.0,Not very comfortable. Didn't have a lot of give/didn't move well.
2.0,This maxi dress was really neat except that it was too big on me.  I returned that one and got one size smaller.  It was too tight.  I even tried changing colors to see if maybe the problem was in the fabric roll. Still the same fit problems and regrettably returned.  It seems it would be best on someone 5.8 or taller.
2.0,"The fringe is not the same color as the dress, so it looks very weird. This silhouette is actually structured for someone like the model in the photo, so it may be large in the hips and chest. Overall, not flattering and would be scratchy. Returning!"
2.0,"Skip these. I won't go so far as to say they look like they came out of a gumball machine, but we're in the ballpark. They just look cheap. Lots better options at this price point."
2.0,"Way too big, bigger than I ordered."
2.0,I was really excited to have these for my keys and so my daughter could put some in her backpack. But I was really disappointed that within the first week they started to pop open and burst. Disappointed.
2.0,"Work in construction, and I do beat my hats up, throw them to the ground. But they still would last 5/6 months. Thought the high price I assumed they were stronger material. The circular top piece is already to tear( after 3 weeks) for a gardening, beach hat, house work. This hat is perfect. Loose fitting, the straw material bends, flexible, not rigid and not the straw feel like a stuffed scare crow. To high price to buy again."
2.0,"There is nothing wrong with the shirt, but it does not match the photo. I purchased one of these shirts in green to see how they are, that one was great and matched the photo. When I ordered 2 additional, kacki, dork green, and bright blue, the Kacki and dark green took a while to deliver and look nothing like the pictures. It has been 4 months now and I have never received the bright blue shirt."
2.0,Appears to be too bulky on head. the first head band section is pretty thick.
2.0,This top didn’t fit. The company didn’t take returns
2.0,Ordered an XL and it fits my size 3 daughter....
2.0,Looked nice but was way too big.
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress, however the fabric is thin and clingy. You would need to wear a really good shapewear underneath it. I like the concept of the wrap style dress, just was not the best quality or fabric.<br />I would not recommend this dress. Dress runs small. Size up if ordering."
2.0,"Inconsistent in size, one size dosen't fit all.."
2.0,Not even close to what is in the picture
2.0,"It must  really be an antique because it had a strong nasty metal smell and I' scared to use it because it's probably needs to be disinfected. I want to disinfect it, but I think that might damage the already fading color."
2.0,I’m 5’2 and these pants only just hit my ankles. I’m usually an Xs/s depending on cut and I even ordered a M after reading reviews but still very petite. The strong waist support is only at the band so working out and doing yoga it can digin and this cotton fabric isn’t supportive for athletics. I do like how thick they are and are great for low impact or comfortable for lungeing around the house or even pjs. Color is true. My measurements are 32-24-36. Hope this helps
2.0,"I tried to use this and I really wanted to like it, but HOLY MOTHER OF... this got my necklaces way more tangled than they’ve ever been in my life. I spent DAYS untangling them. Maybe it’s only a certain type of necklace you can use? NOT MINE APPARENTLY. :( The photo is how they ended up when I finally gave up on it & had to wait for help so I didn’t break my jewelry."
2.0,"The seller's description is extremely misleading. Customer service is lacking and somewhat rude. Watch is not high quality, and wording indicates that the self winding mechanism works well. Instead the swing movement barely moves. Manually winding only lasts 10-12 hours. Watch is not water resistant in any sense of the word. It contains no gasket whatsoever. Buyer beware. it's a piece of crap to say the least and the Afflute company said oh well, what do you expect?"
2.0,"Ordered 2 sizes up and it was still too tight. Ordered the same size of a similar chiffon shirt from the same brand and those fit perfectly, so this is cut smaller than other shirts of the same brand. Bummer."
2.0,The black on the fabric looks faded (like washed many times). I did not like that. It is sad because everything else is fine. I use it to be at home.
2.0,"This is how I received my necklace. The jewelry came in the box so tangled. The way the pearls are set, they do not look good. Not even straight. So crooked. Not good for the value of money spent on this."
2.0,"These pajamas have a problem with the crotch being too short, making them unusable.  Bought them for my mother who inadvertently threw away the invoice and packaging so unable to return.  $30 down the drain!"
2.0,Cute style but fabric is way to thin. Still searching for a way to make is wearable.
2.0,I returned this dress. I wish it came in larger sizes as it was exactly what I wanted to wear to my nieces wedding.
2.0,"Cute dress, but very thin cheap material"
2.0,I had high hopes for this jacket. This jacket is flat compared to the picture.
2.0,I usually love these leggings. Made well. Good fabric. Unfortunately this color / fabric was sooo thin it was completely see-through. I will be returning. Loved the color so I’m really disappointed they won’t work.
2.0,It wouldn't fit over my boobs. I am 40ddd and it wouldn't close. I got the 2xl.
2.0,The dress is not to size. It was tight everywhere including the sleeves. I was expecting something flowy and breezy. This dress isn’t it.
2.0,"The pants themselves aren’t as loose and comfortable as I thought they’d be. The material feels cheap and they’re a bit restrictive, I can’t really bend down in them. They also sent the wrong color, I ordered the black and white ones but received the green ones."
2.0,"This is not an antique bronze/gold necklace, it is on the brighter gold side of jewelry. Also, it's all one color; gold, not gold and silver like itis decipted"
2.0,"While the keychain was very cute, it did not come with a paw print on the keychain as pictured. Also, my daughter had this keychain for exactly one day on her backpack before the chain fell apart and she lost Chi. The chain we received also did not match the pictures of the item, it was extremely flimsy."

2.0,Not true to size the size 11 fits like a 9 1/2 10. Return immediately
2.0,Broke on the first day. Looks good though...
2.0,runs small even though it is suppose to be fitted.  Also is very short.
2.0,"Such a cute top, and made well, but runs very small! I would suggest ordering at least 2 sizes bigger!"
2.0,Heavier with liner I was not expecting from a “lightweight” jacket
2.0,"The only reason that I do not &#34; hate it &#34; is, the designer plate on the front is barely visible. But the plate is upside down!!! Are you kidding me! I did not even bother to return! I think I will contact the seller! SHAMEFUL!!!"
2.0,The design looks like the picture but the material looks nothing like the pic.
2.0,"Great quality bracelet, however, the color is much lighter than shown in the picture. I wanted a dark green bracelet (as pictures) and was disappointed when I received a pale green one."
2.0,Love the beanie but cheaply made and pom pom fell off within 2 days.. You get what you pay for
2.0,"It looks and feels thick like a men's work flannel. The inside feels rough and itchy and it stinks! The smell is awful, It smells like a moldy, damp basement. I ordered this in either an xl or 2xl I can't remember, but the belt it came with fits a size medium. I don't recommend this shirt."
2.0,sizing was wayyy off
2.0,Used twice seams already tearing. Fits good washed once and air dried.
2.0,"Cheap looking material, not suitable for business or events, you will be mistaken for a waiter (I don't mean that as an insult).  If you are in fact in the service industry, this will be ok for work, but not for formal wear."
2.0,Way too short for someone 5'9
2.0,"I liked it, except that the outermost Velcro patch (most important one really) came loose (as in, it is not sticking to the band). It was otherwise nice enough for the price."
2.0,Segun es xL y esta demasiado pequeño ese es como una talla s
2.0,"I only wore it once. It was too big and not stretchy, instead it got saggier while I was wearing it."
2.0,"While the hoodie is exactly as pictured and was delivered on time, The materials used or manufacturing has left it in poor condition. Upon arrival(opening the package) there was already plenty of frayed threads and seams that are already coming apart. I don't feel this jacket will last me 3 months before I have to buy a new one. I would suggest you save you're money for a better quality jacket."
2.0,I always rely on the size chart before purchasing clothes online so I bought this in an XL since I usually wear a size 8. When the blouse arrived it was huge. I tried it on and it looks ridiculous. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Arrived on time, got what I paid for at 6 dollars...that being said, I found them difficult to put on and cumbersome... I will order the more expensive ones from my optometrist. Like I said no complaints... I got what I paid for."
2.0,"Very poor quality, not worth spending a penny for it."
2.0,The fabric felt cheap and scratchy. Color not anywhere as bold as the picture. Didn’t even bother to turn it on.
2.0,After one wash it changed shape. The collar curled up and is impossible to iron. Ito shrunk into a weird square shape. I only use cold water and gentle cleansers. I followed the care instructions.
2.0,Not the same sweater as picture 👎🏻👎🏻😩
2.0,"They fit perfect everywhere EXCEPT the Front Groin area, where they looked 3 sizes too baggy.. fitted in legs, Upper waist band, thighs, length.. so couldn’t size down.."
2.0,Returned due to arriving stained. Would have been a cute suit.
2.0,The quality is poor. I had high expectations
2.0,Returned upon delivery. No instructions.
2.0,"I order a couple of these for myself and my boyfriend for costumes. My boyfriend ordered a XXL and a XXXL (he is 5'10"" 230 lbs for reference), and the XXXL didn't even fit. Usually he is a XL - XXL in any clothing so we decided to get 2 sizes (sizing up for one) in case the reviews were right about them being small (only about half the reviews said small, everyone else said regular). We'll have to buy elsewhere for him since the 3X is the biggest they have here, I think these sizes must be European. For myself, I ordered a M and a L (I am 5'6"" 130 lbs for reference), the medium was a little baggy so I was going to return both of my sizes (along w his) and order a small for myself but now they're saying no returns (there was a few reviews saying returns are allowed) so now I too have to buy elsewhere bc I don't want to be stuck w/ now a 5th total suit that may or may not fit (and isn't returnable). Not the best overall."
2.0,"I bought these in a size large and was very happy with everything EXCEPT the index finger on the right hand was missing the magnet to hold the finger tip back when Texting!<br />I contacted Kellards about it, but never got a response back on how to remedy the problem, since it was the last pair of size Large!<br />So unhappily I am returning them to Amazon for a refund!"
2.0,Did not fit as expected. Ended up buying a large size. No use to me.
2.0,"I was more thrilled with the picture than the product. I feel that it's more sheer than I realize it would be, and the material is a little thicker than I thought it would be. The cuffs don't come together thin at the sleeves and are a bit looser, and the shirt has a homemade look to it."
2.0,"Ordered a small and could have ordered a medium. The shirt did not fit loose like the picture, didn't seem as well made, and the fabric didn't seem as nice. Color was consistent with picture. For reference I'm 5'6"", 130 lbs, 35"" chest. Needed an orange shirt and purchased two different ones so I am returning this one."
2.0,"Maybe the more expensive versions are better, but this cheaper one was ill-fitting in the fingers, especially the thumbs.  Leather was just okay.  Shipped quickly, and return was not a problem."
2.0,Expecting a variety when I purchased 2 at once.  Received 2 plain beige ones.
2.0,"Weird dress, not practical, more like a costume. Huge side slits cut all the way up, Cheap material."
2.0,"Second day of wearing it and it's turning green, worth it's price no not even but definitely is cute"
2.0,The top was too small and there was a strap that was too loose and the bottom was really big.<br />Item was returned
2.0,Overall ok.
2.0,Not what I expected for something higher prices than Walmart boxer briefs. Not nearly as comfortable as go old Haines!
2.0,It’s asymmetrical very low on the front that the material touch the ground and heist in the back. No matter how I adjust it it is the same sleeves are too tight for it to be a lot watch. I decided not to keep it is not for me. And the material is not terribly bad it’s not for me and the color should be pure white and it’s a dull white.
2.0,Very cute but one turtle detached soon after I received it.
2.0,I don’t believe this is a real jujube product. I have another bag by jujube and the quality is much better. Do not buy this product. I had it only one month and the bag is now ripping making it not useful at all. Terrible quality! Priced too high.
2.0,"and when I tried to use pliers to bend it smaller, the middle piece broke off. Also I got the feeling that if I had even been able to get it to fit, it would have been constantly getting tangled in my hair."
2.0,"I've tried a couple of times with these pants but the feel is just off for me, not comfy."
2.0,The case is cute but it not practical to carry around in your pocket. I end up leaving it at home. The clasp that locks it together is not very good either. A little bump to it and it opens up. Also...they mean it when they say not to put much in it. I will be looking for another wallet.
2.0,Felt like a garbage bag. I wear an XL and even the XXXL was tight and the arms and waist too short.
2.0,Very very cheap looking. I won't wear it.
2.0,Fits small. Hard to move arms.
2.0,"Color/pattern is not as pictured. Sleeves are super short. Very thin. I was hoping this was going to be a great find at a great price, but isnt even worth the $40. The color I was sent is not even close and is not even in the other choices. Sent back within minutes of opening."
2.0,"No me agradó que la tela no era elastizada. El diseño y color,muy lindos."
2.0,I loved this case at first but was disappointed when it started coming apart after only a few weeks.
2.0,This fit on this dress is terrible and the color is a lot more dull in real like (I got the red dress).
2.0,"These pants run small and the crotch doesn't sit half as low as in the photos, so they don't look purposely baggy but instead just awkwardly cut as if you bought regular sweatpants that are a size too big on you."
2.0,"So I bought two one for and friend and mine, I was only able to use it once which isn't the best sound quality, and now it won't even charge nor turn on, but my friends works"
2.0,Great if you like oversized sun glasses and a heavy metal but not my go to pair.
2.0,"Cute, came on time but when I wore it in the rain, only parts of the coat did the water bead up and run off.  Other parts let the water go right through.  It's ok as a windbreaker, but not as a raincoat."
2.0,"The dress has a high waist, so if you like a dress with a waist under your breast you will<br />like it. Not for me, but I love how Amazon returned it quit."
2.0,"Material has no stretch and is very thin. The elastic gives it good stretch, but the chest may look weird. I think the arm bands looked awkward and made my chest look broad. I wish I had straps instead, would be so pretty and secure. Skirt is light and flowy but am worried it will fly up at the slightest breeze."
2.0,This mask is an adult mask for sure. It does not fit a child like advertised. Maybe a teenager but not a child.
2.0,Can’t figure out how to wear it!
2.0,"Now that I have it, I wish the writing on the wallet was large enough to read."
2.0,Larger than I expected. Too thick for my nose.
2.0,I don’t like the “tie dye look” print. It’s different from the pictures as advertised and way too huge.
2.0,"Feel in love with this when I saw it, the color is way off (lighter) and the middle stich on the sleeves burst after the first wear."
2.0,you can tell it was only  a few dollars
2.0,"I have no doubt my Wednesday obsessed daughter will love this. But it smells disgusting, like a musty thrift shop that’s never opened a window or door ever.<br />It seems well made, but the fabric is obviously cheap and it’s very much “Halloween costume” vibes in the sense that I feel itchy just looking at it."
2.0,"Really beautiful bracelets but they are small! I thought I had purchased child bracelets for a second. They are not stretchy at all like I assumed they would be. You can barely roll them on over your hands. I have toby wrists, someone with big wrists might have problems!"
2.0,Got it January 9 2016 today is April 25 2016. It is literally falling apart.  Strap and zippers broke and it's coming un-stitched. It looked amazing when I got it but it's poorly made. Sad thing about it..it was part of my Christmas and I'm stuck with it. Very disappointed.
2.0,"It fit well around the waist and arms but it was really snug around my chest. If you have a larger bust, size up."
2.0,"Don't fall for the picture, this outfit DOES NOT come with the robe.  Don't be like me, read the description.  DUUUUUUUUUUUUMBBBBBBBBBB"
2.0,Three buttons were broken off already on receipt of the item
2.0,The costume is like the picture. The sizing is right on. However the edges of the skirt were unhemmed and frayed. :(
2.0,"I had to give these away because they were GIANT. SO SO Giant. My face is a heart/round shape, but they just made me look like a bug. My eyebrows didn't show like the models... Quality of the product was great in my opinion, they were a nice weight and sturdy. Came in a cute bag and box."
2.0,It's not really as cute in person as it looks online. It definitely smells like real leather but it still looks cheap. The strands are hard to untangle to put on your wrist and its kind of hard to fasten. I wouldn't buy again.
2.0,"I normally don’t purchase anything that has to be ironed. When my package arrived, I noticed they were somewhat wrinkled at the folds, so decided to wash them. Much to my disappointment, they came out of the dryer even more wrinkled. I never would have bought them if I’d known they must be pressed. I don’t even own an iron. However, if you don’t mind ironing, you’ll probably like these pants."
2.0,Didn't fit...
2.0,These are super soft and thin which feels nice until you actually use them a few times and they start falling apart. Mine are still new and already most of them are in the trash can. A shame.
2.0,Had to return them because I couldn’t get the sticker mark off one lenses and couldn’t get the lenses to truly clean.  It was like there were smudges “baked” in them.  Will try a different brand.  Fit was good so I’m giving them 2 stars.
2.0,"They smell of petroleum products! The hearts are only glued on and one had to be reglued. They are very cute so I will air them out, reglue the hearts and wear them."
2.0,"Some of the stones are fake , I like to wear only natural stones & crystals"
2.0,it broke after a few months. :-/
2.0,"I had a band like this for my Charge 2 HR that I really liked. I thought I would try out on the Charge 5. I immediately noticed that the band pieces connected loosely; not as tight as the original. The band stayed connected for a while but once I put a winter jacket and gloves on, the problems started.  The band would disconnect at random times while wearing winter clothes. This band might be fine for some but not recommended if you wear long sleeves."
2.0,Good quality<br />And looks great
2.0,"Quality seemed cheap, fabric seemed faded, lettering seemed faded, not bright white. Didn't think it was worth the money, I returned it."
2.0,"Honestly, it looked more like a costume than a nice dress for a formal occasion.  The blue chiffon sleeves were a different shade of blue than the material of the dress, and as others have said, there is a weird gap at the top of the shoulders which would show just about any bra strap. For the price, it would make a nice dress for a costume event."
2.0,Literally had to sew the strap back together upon opening this product. But I had already waited so long to exchange for a smaller size that I wasn’t going to bother sending back at that point.
2.0,"Amazingly cute dress; creates the perfect hourglass figure. My boyfriend couldn’t stop complimenting me on how great I looked. However I could only wear it once.  After one washing - it SHRUNK about half it’s size. That was with cold water, garment bag and air drying and it still SHRUNK!  So sad!  I recommend Ordering up a size if want to wear it more than once!  I would have ordered another one but it wasn’t a large available :("
2.0,Would not recommend even at this price !
2.0,I received this on 11/13.  It's really cute..the cover was too blingy for me so I got a different screen cover.  I really like the black and rose gold together in the band.  The black leather has already started to come apart (not even 2 weeks of having it).  Use your money to buy something that will last longer.
2.0,Too small. My daughter is 6 years old and she's so small that she keeps peeling off. So I returned it.
2.0,"Item is made of synthetic, smells horribly 'chemical' when package opened.  Material is not cotton nor linen, no care tag, likely to wrinkle badly.  A size L fit 5'-6"" size 14US woman - hit about 4"" ankle.  Nice design on fabric, colors are vibrant, no idea if it will fade or how to properly care."
2.0,"The shirt fit fine it'self, but the material felt sorta cheap and the decal is at an odd place in my opinion and not on the chest as shown."
2.0,I didn't like how the ball comes on and off. You just pop it out. My skin also had a reaction to the metal. But I do have sensitive skin.
2.0,V is way too deep!  Shows underwear.
2.0,"Short and wide I’m 6 foot tall about 180 pounds and this is short, thankfully I wear high waisted pants but even still it is so boxy There’s nothing feminine about this. It doesn’t look like a woman in charge it doesn’t look strong it just looks like a woman who has no taste of clothing. I only wore one of the three shirts that I ordered and when I washed it I didn’t even dry it and it shrunk and got even more square shorter and wider. I would never purchased from the sprint again ever. If you’re trying to look in anyway feminine or strong or authoritative you won’t look that way you’re going to look like you don’t know how to fair close and your dressing up for a job that you think you want but you don’t like qualify for"
2.0,"I got this mask to comply with local mandates requiring the wearing of face coverings to help prevent the spread of Covid-19.  I wanted a mask that was washable/reusable, 3-layer, fitted at the nose and under the chin and that was comfortable. This mask meets those requirements but it is sometimes so difficult to inhale that I can not recommend the mask.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The inner cotton layer remains comfortable for hours.  I can not speak to how effective (or not) the middle layer of polypropylene and outer layer of polyester are at blocking fine droplets that I exhale but the mask does meet the suggestion of the use of a three-layer face covering.<br />The adjustments for the ear loops is very clever and allows for a comfortable fit.<br />The ability to mold the upper portion to the top of my nose helps to minimize fogging of my glasses.<br />I also like the fact that the pattern on the mask makes it a bit different and fun.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The mask had a strong chemical smell initially and needed to be washed before use.  Once it was washed once, there was no more smell.<br />Once I had the nose piece properly adjusted I did find that there was resistance when I inhaled deeply.  I suppose that could be an indication that the mask is actually helping to filter in both directions but it is enough to be an issue.<br />The care instructions recommend that the mask be hand washed and air dried.  I would have preferred that it at least be machine washable and ideally machine dryable as well.  The care instructions also state ""Do not wash the filter. Replase [sic] at least once a week or unless necessary"" but I could not figure out how to remove the filter. Those two things resulted in deducting a star.<br /><br />*Update 09/10/20 - I reduced the rating to two stars as there have now been a number of times where I have almost had to remove the mask because it is so difficult to inhale.  Most of the time it is not an issue, but it has happened enough that due to this I no longer wear the mask and can therefore no longer recommend it."
2.0,"I ordered this as it was so similar to one I have ordered in the past in multiple colors. However, this one fit well in the bust (if a little snug) but the sleeves were barely to my wrists. The photo did not do the fit justice."
2.0,Do not even both buying this. Literally looks nothing like the photo and is so cheap looking
2.0,Only one earring.
2.0,"Part if bracelet , was broken before it came out of the package"
2.0,I am not a big fan of the material used. It's just to clingy. I was going to use this as a summer dress. Hich by the way would have worked well. But I just don't like the material.
2.0,This was beautiful when it first arrived but broke within the first few weeks. I’m also highly skeptical this is a real opal. Felt and handled more like plastic. Would not recommend.
2.0,"Doesn’t fit right, doesn’t look right."
2.0,Not style that advertised. Look elsewhere for that distressed look.
2.0,"The arms on these shirts are cartoonishly long.  I would say 4 inches longer than an ""X-long.""  I tend to by long-sized clothing and measured the arms of a shirt that fits me, and it is 5 inches shorter than this shirt, so that's why I say this shirt is probably 4 or more inches too long.  I suspect that there was a mistake in measuring the arms of these at the factory so these shirts were rejected by the purchaser/British government, and then the factory sold it to whatever resellers they could find.  Other than that, it is a quality shirt, so if you don't mind serious alterations or sewing, you might find a use for these."
2.0,"Not as pictured different design recieved, runs very small."
2.0,"At first I thought they were pretty ok and comfortable, but after only using 1 week to go to the beach they broke easily and simply while just walking. Not so good &#34;rubber/plastic&#34; quality."
2.0,"I disliked how big the mask was , gave it to a friend."
2.0,I didn't recieve a very good selection.
2.0,The material is cheap and see through. Jumpsuit was poorly made. Stitching coming apart when I pulled it out the package. Will be returning for a refund.
2.0,"I was worried when I originally ordered this that it might be too short on me but I was pleasantly surprised when I opened it at the length. I immediately tried it on and despite the description stating it would fit up to a size 26, it does not. I wear a size 20 and I couldn’t even get it up past my thighs. A real bummer because it was the perfect color to match my students’ costumes at our annual dance recital. But alas, the sizing is very misleading and I do not recommend ordering the plus size unless you’re more of a size 16."
2.0,"The fit was great. My daughter ordered small, she’s about 5’3” and 110 lbs. The bottoms were high waisted and didn’t ride up. The top fit her smaller frame without sagging when wet. Unfortunately the material pilled on the top and bottoms after just a few weeks of summer wear."
2.0,"So, it's not what I was expecting. It's covered in a teal sort of paint that rubs off on your fingers. I can see how it might eventually look like the picture, but only after it flakes or transfers. The ring itself is nice enough."
2.0,They are very blurry at the top distance range and they  are huge. I would not recommend. I kept telling myself it will just take time to adjust but that is not the case.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:e52009d849267402671decb33f9dd085]] I didn’t expect much, but even setting the bar low...I am still a tiny bit disappointed. I ordered a 9 (US) and it is more like an 11.<br />I like to come back to look at pics or reviews AFTER I receive something and it DOES look like the seller’s photos exactly. And the description details they provide is accurate. But.....as for the reviewers saying it’s more beautiful than they expected? Nah lol I call bs. It IS pretty in person from afar. My boyfriend complimented it from across the dimly lit room. But that was straight out of the box.The band feels like plastic and the gem is fine except you can sort of see the glue around the rim holding it in. I predict my future includes gold chipping and brass underneath turning my finger green as reviewers before me have claimed.<br />It was cheap (that’s why we bought it, right?) so take it for what it’s worth. I just was hoping it would be one of those situations where you’re pleasantly surprised. but hey, better luck next time lol<br /><br />Video note: the other ring is a rainbow moonstone ring (the mellow Apollo is the name I think) I got from moonmagic.com that is a US size 10. Just included to compare to something for perspective. Excuse the video. Kind of hard to use one hand and the iPhone focus up close is not something I have mastered LOL"
2.0,"One of the seams came apart on the first wash. Cute, but pretty low quality."
2.0,"The dress fits fine but whenever I move my arms, the top 3 buttons come undone. Unfortunately I won't be wearing it unless there's a pin holding the top closed."
2.0,These earrings arrived damaged. I returned for a refund.
2.0,I guess I was expecting a compression sock these socks are comfortable but I will not call them compression socks
2.0,Not what I expected from the description.  The inside shell is not a shell at all but a cheap t-shirt.  If I could I'd send it back!
2.0,Not the best quality but cute purse
2.0,"It has a wonderful feel. I had ordered one previously and it is beautiful, so I ordered this one. I received the wrong print. Very disappointed. I am apprehensive to try again from this vendor."
2.0,"With all the good reviews, I decided to buy these for work. However as soon as I put them on I realized I can’t wear them to work because they are incredibly see-through. I’m giving two stars because they are comfortable, but I honestly can only wear them with long LONG shirts."
2.0,they do not sit right on your face.
2.0,It's overall ok. But it is definitely not as pictured on the mannequins head. The hair feels of ok quality but not top tier quality. It tangles and sheds a lot too. I would definitely not recommend this wig to anyone.
2.0,Looks so cheaply made and feels flimsy; not sturdy or weighted well.  Could be awesome for Halloween trick or treat parades
2.0,"My daughter could only wear a few of these rings, the rest were too small (and frankly she didn’t like the ones with cheap plastic stones on the front. My bad for ordering the wrong kind)."
2.0,"Lovely set of PJ,s but I paid too much.  Go to Disney.com, where the prices are much better.  I was charged 2x what I should have paid for this product.  Learned my lesson the hard way."
2.0,"Mittens are great, hat fits like it isn't cut directional for the face"
2.0,Super cute but because the headband came deformed it would squeeze up and off my daughter's head.
2.0,"I ordered this for a costume party and this was about the only mustache Amazon offered, so I ordered it. It is NOT ADHESIVE and it does NOT COME WITH ADHESIVE. I had to use eyelash glue and because it was an outdoor party in the hot summer weather, the eyelash glue just did not hold up. Mustache itself was fine, but being adhesive would have been much better."
2.0,They arrived damaged. Plus one broke at the post. Was issued full refund. Wouldn't order them again... Too flimsy.
2.0,The strap is too short for a classical guitar.
2.0,"I ordered a large & it was too small, I also didn't like the sleeves, the asymmetrical cut isn't flattering."
2.0,Extremely thin.
2.0,Not as expected. Size and quality aren't worthy for the price. Never buy unknown brand online again.
2.0,No button. I am not happy about getting something brand new and the button is not even on them. Pants fit ok. The pockets are zippered with long metal tassels.
2.0,"Poor packaging, broken chain, all batteries but one dead"
2.0,It didnt work for me but It's not bad quality
2.0,Nice material but huge shirt. Ordered a size small and it looks like a large and is very very wide. Wish it could have fit.
2.0,Cute but too small. Needed 1 size up. I gave it to a friend
2.0,"It's cute, but the center is no bigger than a dime.  I had to use a magnifying glass to read the inscription.  Very disappointed."
2.0,The material is very thin and has a weird smell. I returned the sweatshirt.
2.0,The dress is more of a Fuchsia color.
2.0,"This is not a chrome license plate cover. I received a white one, and the only reason I kept it is because my car happens to be white"
2.0,"Product looks like picture.  However, in handling it, it feels very light.  I have several nice silver chains in various sizes.  This one just doesn't feel like silver . . . feels more like plastic.  Diasppointed and sending it back. Ordering another that is much less expensive and nearly double the gram weight.  Description of this one notes it is SOLID silver."
2.0,"Fabric is very thin and clingy.  Nice color, though."
2.0,Not jogger material and I sized up based on other reviews and sizing chart but it was still too small. It stopped at my hips and was very tight
2.0,"So small my petite seven year old couldn't wear them without uncomfortable squeezing her temples. Save your money.,.,"
2.0,"Not comfortable.  Have to cut them off after use if too stuck together.  Sometimes over hang the ring band.  Other people find these great, but I will just give up and have the ring sized."
2.0,Looks good and stays put but 1) loop isn’t long enough to slip hand through-you have to disconnect and connect each time and 2) it only lasted 9 months before it started pulling apart
2.0,"Although this necklace is very inexpensive, when I opened my package, I was very disappointed. It is very cheaply made.<br />It does look the price....<br />I don't recommend giving this as a gift."
2.0,Product is cute but was expecting two pj’s as it states couples.  Only received one.
2.0,"This is a medium weight bike jersey, not a softshell jacket. Totally porous to wind. I'm 6 feet, 190lbs. A large fits well (snug) and is long enough in the arms and body. Just fine as jerseys go, but the title is very misleading."
2.0,"The sizing was way off, and the picture mis-represented the actual &#34;sweatshirt.&#34; This is more of a sport/compression type shirt, and color was bright blue instead of green like the picture."
2.0,Love having the pocket on the side. Pattern is fun and exactly as pictured but the material is very see -through.
2.0,These are so bulky and uncomfortable
2.0,These are nice looking shorts but only lasted less than a year. You don't really wear shorts in winter so yeah pretty crappy. It's not like they were overly washed either. Would not buy again
2.0,"Not what I expected but really needed it at the time, so I said this bag will serve the purpose so I kept it. Only using it a few times not as an everyday bag I noticed the straps were loosening from the bag. I examined the bag and straps thoroughly, yes the stitching has loosened and eventually the strap will fall off"
2.0,This barely fits adult skates. I'm gonna buy a bigger bag as I can't really use this. Might work OK for kids skates though.
2.0,sorry had to return too small for a large
2.0,"It is OK, to big for my wrist."
2.0,"These could be good glasses straps, but the holes for the stems were too small for my glasses. Beware that if you have glasses with stems that are thicker at the end, they may not fit. Seem to be fine otherwise, even though I haven't gotten to use them."
2.0,"The necklace appears much larger, but when I received it, it was just too small."
2.0,It just wasn’t what the picture advised:/(please excuse my nails)
2.0,nice quality but runs too small. With a newborn baby on my hands I had no time to return the merchandise. The v neck is too deep and the slit is too high.
2.0,I ordered these for my cousin's and the colored ones were nice. Don't get the kind that is priced for 1.99 that is all black. It looks ulgy and the clasp was hard to open
2.0,"While this dress is comfortable and the fit looks nice, do not be deceived by the beautiful colors on the white dress. The dress that was delivered to our home looks like an Easter Egg. Luckily, it is still appropriate for the purpose... however it is not the elegant one shown."
2.0,"The shirt is not as long as it shows in the picture.  I usually wear a medium, but ordered a large because I was worried about it being too tight.  The large is too big and it looks boxy on me.  The fabric is also a little odd and has a sheen to it.  Overall, it’s not nearly as cute as the picture shows."
2.0,These are spray painted wire ties on a cheap gold headband. Flowers are foam and more orange than red. I took the flowers off and DIYed my own from a craft store. Go to the dollar store and save your $
2.0,"was a little small, recommend going a size up"
2.0,Terrible fit due to bad sewing
2.0,I'm is pretty but the letter broke off putting it on
2.0,Quality and fit weren't great so I returned mine.
2.0,Size ran small.  Asked for an Charge.
2.0,"Exactly what I expected, very stylish~will buy again even though this pair broke after only a few months of wear."
2.0,Xl fit like a sm-meduim
2.0,Very cheeky
2.0,"Item is almost exactly as shown and described., but in person it looks very costume / fake looking. Judging from the selling picture, expected this to look a little more real.  Not bad for the price I guess, you get what you pay for."
2.0,"Very,very, thin and see thru. Also runs big. Seems more like pajamas."
2.0,The top is super tight and the thumb hold are on the wrong side on my top :( looks awkward the leggings are alright I don’t think I’d trust them to squat
2.0,am very unhappy with this dress. to short for starters and the waist line is very long.. not anything like the picture. the only thing that was like the picture.. is the color.
2.0,It fit fine just a little shut but that was my bad.
2.0,"waist was way to big on me, had to return :("
2.0,I purchased this coat for my 12 year old. He has been wearing it since the last week of November and it is already destroyed. The coat is easily torn and I have had to sew the entire front panel back together. The pockets are ripped and so much more. He is not necessarily delicate but this is beyond normal damage to an item. I’ve never seen a piece of clothing rip so easily. Disappointed for sure!
2.0,"Updated: I re-ordered the bra and it arrived in good condition and is beautiful, and fits well. It was still shipped in a plastic bag, but it was intact.<br /><br />The bra appeared beautiful. I attempted to try it on, but something was off.  After removing the bra, I noticed that the clasp to adjust the shoulder strap, was folded in half, it was a sturdy metal clasp.  It was probably done during shipping as it was shipped in an envelope, and not a sturdy box or padded bag, I returned it I did not order another because I was afraid it would be shipped the same way ."
2.0,"Top fits me perfectly. The bottoms are very cheaply made, no stretch to them at all"
2.0,These are not touchscreen or waterproof.
2.0,"I realize it was inexpensive, Not very good quality. The hoops were huge"
2.0,"I had read the reviews so I was prepared for the small fit, but this is ridiculous. The straps are really cheap and thin so they have already worn down and have small tears in them. The cups are odd, they are hard as well and make my breasts look misshapen and it's not comfortable at all. I'm really disappointed and I don't know how this purchase worked out for other people but it did not work out for me. D:"
2.0,I didn't like the material and on me it came away too much from my belly.  Would've been a good maternity dress though.
2.0,Looks nothing like the picture. The shirt is a lot shorter and wider than expected.
2.0,Not as heavy as I wanted. Very light weight top.  Needed it to be a bit thicker of material.  Cane after Xmas<br />. Late for present.
2.0,Much prettier in pictures. its like a cotton boring dress. i had asked for purple and received blue!
2.0,way to small didn't fit as expected. returned.
2.0,After my son used them them 3 times they started leaking.
2.0,"I bought it thinking it is light weight and can carry it in my bag, but it's a bit too heavy for my liking, therefore, endedup returning it.  Return was very easy."
2.0,"I bought the hat specifically for Kayaking and sailing as I thought the extended brim would provide more protection from sun exposure. Unfortunately the extended brim made the hat too heavy and it kept sliding down my forehead.  I ended up taking the extended brims off. It is better but not perfect.  The product is supposed to be UPF 50+ but I have no way of actually proving it. That is one of the biggest issues of buying these off brand goods. If you really want to be sure, pay more money and purchased a sun hat from more reputeble stores.  I had a moment of weakness and purchased this cheap hat hoping it will provide UPF 50+ protection."
2.0,They tore after first use and not even after a complete day. Had to take them off
2.0,"I was looking for a nice, lightweight, blazer for spring and summer. This had the look that I wanted, so I decided to get it. However, upon opening and trying it on, the sleeves were too small/tight. The armhole opening was tight, and it felt as though it would cut off my circulation if I had worn it for an extended period of time. The fabric is soft, and the color is nice though. This could work for the right person."
2.0,"It looks heavier in the picture, however the material is quite thin. The fit is a tad bit on the small size, if you want baggy definitely order a size up. It honestly looks like a cheap, medium-sized dog throw blanket. Definitely overpriced."
2.0,"Compré esto para mi hija de 5 años,la verdad es que no le puedo poner aretes por qué el padre no quiere y me pareció buena idea usar estos pero me decepcioné al ver que a cada rato se caen."
2.0,with the elastic in front it rides up easily
2.0,Couldn't get my phone to disconnect on phone calls. Pushing the home button wouldn't work through the phone case.
2.0,it’s a nice bracelet but it doesn’t stay on . It’s fallen off several times
2.0,"These are great in so many ways: soft, comfortable waist and legs, they don't ride up, even when running...<br /><br />They could use quite a bit more... utility space, let's say. Good product, maybe, but not a good... fit."
2.0,"Pretty, too small"
2.0,Not as described. mine came with a middle zipper and no buttons like in the photo.
2.0,Too floppy. I wouldn't buy again
2.0,"The color is pretty but it's too short. Good if you're 5'6"" or shorter."
2.0,The hole in the attached ball is too big. It can pull out. Easy fix with a zip tie.
2.0,Material is good.  Pockets are good.  The biggest problem is that the belt buckle fits too tight inside the long tube that hides it.  Sometimes I have to spend minutes to get it out of its hiding tube.  A few minutes is a LONG time when you try to put on your pants.  They should modify their design!!
2.0,Fingers are narrow and touch pads for touch screen barely work. Also the pads are not located at tips and of fingers where you would want them
2.0,"The slippers are very cute, but they were HUGE.  So, not able to give to my daughter.  I figured that I could wear them, as I am an adult, but they are not comfortable."
2.0,"The watch looks cool, but the clasp is of poor design and after a few times taking on or off it’s loose to stay on the wrist and won’t stay buckled."
2.0,Sandals stretched badly.
2.0,"These are awesome, and I got them as a late birthday present for myself with birthday money from a friend. This particular set did not come in a box like the others; some need to be better enameled. There are bubbles/uncovered spaces/unfilled spaces, discoloration, and scratches to the polished metal from being loose in a bag. One is bent, for sure. There is also some ""glue,"" as I don't know what else to call it on some of them, that I have to clean off."
2.0,This was much smaller than anticipated and looked poorly made.
2.0,It felt like a nightgown. Not the most flattering but comfy. 🤷‍♀️
2.0,The band doesn't fit along the watch like the stock one. Leaves a big gap between band and wrist.
2.0,I used this Luggage 3 times and I have a broken wheel.  I would've thought this was a tougher product.
2.0,Love how they look but they're COMPLETELY see through so I can't even wear them :(
2.0,Believe the reviews about chincy quality. I'll keep it but generally disappointed.
2.0,Sheer part too itchy. Hard to get on.
2.0,Size L was way too big. More like Xlg
2.0,"super cheap looking/feeling, which probably should have been expected for the price :|"
2.0,"Considering that you can buy a brand new Casio Men's CA53W Calculator Watch here on Amazon for $15, this band is no bargain.  By the time the band on your old watch falls apart (almost 3 years for me), the face of the watch is usually pretty scratched up from punching the calculator buttons.  If you can buy a brand new watch, including band, for about a buck more, why would you want to mess around replacing the band on your old, scratched-up watch?"
2.0,Too small and too tight around my foot - bought my normal size I’ve used with other Nike products including sandals but these were way off.  Returned
2.0,I really liked this band. Was a tad on the bigger side but got use to wearing it. Then started wearing long sleeves and sweaters and it that’s when I disliked it. It snagged on everything. So will be a band to wear in warmer weather and short sleeved
2.0,"Much smaller than expected for size bought. I like the style,"
2.0,Absurdly small.  The designer seems to think that adult women are actually Barbies
2.0,"They are very pretty but sadly they are not true to size. I wish I would’ve dove deeper in reviews on this one, too small and they would in fact collect dust or be lost right away. The company clearly doesn’t know what true to size is on plugs. Unfortunately"
2.0,Falls down easily which is quite annoying
2.0,"Super disappointed. I'm giving 2 stars only because my husbands shirt held up better than mine. Initially they both looked adorable, but they didn't stay that way. My shirt was clearly but pre-shrunk. It is super short in length now and I can't wear it. Total bummer of a purchase."
2.0,It didn’t do a great job of cleaning the stains out they’re all pretty much still there. Save your money !
2.0,I am not impressed with these.  They are too tight and the fabric pulls so you see the white under the color
2.0,Way too tight on chest. For an XL would have expected better fit otherwise xxl is too large for me but may have to go up a size or have it altered.
2.0,I wear a medium and read the reviews so I bought a large and it was still waaaaay too small. Very tight around the arm and bust areas. If you purchase this shirt I would go two to three sizes up. My two stars are for the good quality material and timely arrival.
2.0,The graphic on the picture looks bright and vibrant. The graphic on the actual shirt was dark and dull.
2.0,Runs smaller than expected but it's a pretty dress
2.0,"Skechers anything are always my go-to when it comes to my feet. I've never been disappointed until now. These are darling sandals, and I do wear the size. I ordered, 8 to 8 1/2. However, the straps were tight from between the toes to around the heel and cut off circulation in my feet creating pain and discomfort. I can't walk in them at all beyond a few feet. 😄 Alas, I had to give them up for Lent instead (so sad) and now I am wandering homeless without any shoes--which are now relegated to someone with apparently shorter feet than I."
2.0,The product is cheaply made and the several nails were glued on to the wrong side of the glove.  Luckily since it was so cheap we easily popped them off and re-glued them.  We had to have them for a Halloween dance performance.  Every dancer had something wrong with theirs.
2.0,Very thin and the neck area to the back has a big gap
2.0,No good. Zipper broke almost immediately. Disappointed.
2.0,"I was originally happy to find sunglass straps that can be snug tightened on the sunglasses.  But after using these, I find that they do not retain their hold and my sunglasses have fallen off the strap several times with regular use.  They have not met my needs."
2.0,It came too small and darker than pictured. Disappointed.
2.0,It was really super cute... except for the horrible cut around the bust that just makes everything look super awkward. I returned it.
2.0,This material is the same as the first shirt I purchased. It was wrinkled but no where as bad. I was able to use my steamer on this one to get most of the wrinkles out.
2.0,This Top is very thin and see through. I bought the black and I am disappointed.
2.0,The color was totally wrong. I was expecting a plum color but instead I got bright red.
2.0,"This is not &#34;chemise,&#34; it feels like workout material - not really comfortable to sleep in.  It is really sexy, but I was hoping for &#34;sleepwear,&#34; which this is not."
2.0,"It was good till the cord broke. These cords just never last! I break them in about a month, they need something different than this cheap elastic string or go thicker on string."
2.0,This was a nice package but there were strings to tie together were awkward. Maybe I wasn't doing it right but it wasn't tying right.
2.0,Did not want to clamp. I almost lost my watch several times..
2.0,"I wanted to love this purse!  I LOVE the mustard yellow color. It’s kind of stiff inside and the compartments are super roomy. If you don’t carry much, the size is fine, BUT I took the long, boring job I put off for months searching for a purse I liked and also changing out my pure and wallet, Only to be walking out of the grocery store only, SIX whole days of using it,  and the shoulder strap broke and all of my stuff came tumbling out all over the parking lot."
2.0,Too small to thin
2.0,"It did not come with any instructions as far as winding, but it appears that it needs to be wind daily in order to keep time. My husband frequently has to find out the hard way that the watch is not at the right time and has to wind it."
2.0,Many studs are too small for even kids. Can be better.
2.0,"i ordered both clemson and tennessee each pair i received was very light in color, i would have liked them to be a little darker.true to the colors (dark orange)"
2.0,"I really wanted to love this bathing suit but it wasn't for me. The bathing suit itself is beautiful and the material is high quality. The material is not cheap or thin at all. However, the cut of the bathing suit was not flattering at all on my body. I usually wear a large/x-large with no issues. I have a booty and the bottom part of the bathing suit flattened my butt and squeezed my abdomen area without shaping my body. I felt the thigh area was too tight. The bottoms came up higher to my waist and the overall look wasn't for me. I feel if you have a shorter torso, this bathing suit will not be flattering."
2.0,The fact that the jeans run small wasn't even a big issue for me.. the thing that upset me the most is that they look NOTHING like the picture. I would have liked the jeans as shown!
2.0,Dislike the feel of this material. Feels rough to the touch
2.0,Sad to discover that it only floats for about 10 seconds and then it sinks. Don’t think that counts.
2.0,"I purchased these as part of a Christmas a gift for mom and the pants have no elasticity, or give in waist. They are too small and company will not allow return or give a refund. They are offering $5 as compensation but I am stuck with the pants! So not happy!"
2.0,"Had to send back, wrong color to match outfit."
2.0,"The slippers were great, but I was disappointed that after a year the insoles were completely ruined and the manufacturer wants to sell a replacement at 30% the cost of the entire slipper. Having only worn these at night (at most 3 hours/day) and in the house, I would expect an $80 slipper to last longer."
2.0,"On web page display no glitter on bangle set ,received lots of glitter on bangle set . glitter fly every wear on brides out fit. before mailing check your displayed item on web page."
2.0,Way to tight.  Return was fast and easy.
2.0,Like the glasses but sparkly details on the side fell off. Found 1st one and glued back on. Didn’t find 2nd one. Happened 4th time wearing.
2.0,Stop overcharging for less than the quality. Love the material but the rest c'mon why is it so hard to order a long pant and they be a suitable length? Instead I have to order them with a giant waist and they should be long enough based on their chart but they can't even get that right.
2.0,Cute shoes but broke almost immediately. Had to return. Only moderately comfy - the battery pack is inside the cuff against your ankle.
2.0,Sole came apart after first wear
2.0,The earrings are beautiful really the picture does not do justice. They look so cute on my 18 month old. However one of the earrings lost all the gold within a few months but the other one kept the gold color. It's really odd as if they were not the same quality.
2.0,"I wish these fit. I'm definitely an XL, and these were listed as an L, so I knew they might be too small. They might be juniors size, but even for junior size they're not an XL, though they might pass for a junior L.  Do not get them if you are a woman and you want them to be baggy and loose and cool looking like in the photo. Because I'm a woman and I'm an XL, and for these to fit I would need a triple XL. No joke. Also the  material is like dollar store material, I don't think it's going to wear out anytime soon because it'll probably last through a nuclear blast, as it is 1000% polyester, rayon, or some sort of weird blend, yet somehow it is still a little see-through. Other than that they are super cute and I wish they did fit, because I would still keep them, weird material not withstanding."
2.0,"This item constantly moved & caused my child to trip & fall. Put socks on underneath, and still same result. Don’t waste your money !"
2.0,"I am 5'6"" and 130 pounds. I ordered the small per other reviews and I should have gone up a size as the shirt does not fit like it does in the picture. I do have room to wear a tank underneath, but not much more and it doesn't come off of the shoulder as much as shown. It is thin and not great quality. I have not washed this shirt, yet, so I don't know how it will hold up size wise. I don't even think it looks dressy casual with jeans, even with a necklace as shown in the picture. I will probably wear this with yoga pants. I wasn't out much with this purchase, but was hoping for the look in the picture as it appears to be a really cute shirt."
2.0,Unfortunately it is not product that I can recommend. On the pictures it looks nice and thick. In reality it is the thinest material I have ever seen. Not worth even 5$
2.0,Great material but it sits right under rib cage very uncomfortable
2.0,The stripes were much thicker than pictured. It doesn’t look flattering
2.0,Ended up never wearing and donating. Fit big but fabric wasnt thin
2.0,"I typically look at the reviews with a grain of salt.  People either love something or they hate it.  I am using this as a replacement for a ""tech"" jacket I use when I travel.  First, I runs small, so order a size larger than you need if you intend to zip it up.  Speaking of zippers, they are crap.  The first time I used one of the big zippers on the front, it failed.  They are those cheap plastic ones that don't close properly and come undone behind the zipper.  You have to jerk it backwards to try to get it to go forward properly.  It hasn't broken yet, but I anticipate that it eventually will.  I would pay more for decent zippers.  Although it runs small, the arm hole is large and it is otherwise comfortable to wear.  I ordered some marine grade zipper lubricant to see if I can get the zippers to work better.  I like the jacket design, I just wish they would put decent zippers on it."
2.0,Didn't keep
2.0,I ordered a medium and this was long as my mid thighs. Also very thick. Hard to wear as an under shirt.
2.0,"order a size down, it was way too big and I had to return it"
2.0,Gave it to my friend. No size was originally listed.
2.0,I gave this hand bag  two stars because it’s  much bigger than I thought it was .
2.0,This jacket is not down as described.  It’s polyester fill.  There’s no way it will be warm for winter weather.  Nice looking but not functional
2.0,"Poor woorkmanship - I wanted it for the fuzzy material, I had a jacket from Macy's I got years ago that I needed to replace, the trim is some kind of general elastic band, the back rides up a LOT, like it keeps pulling my shirt up so it's really a hassle to wear this jacket even just lounging around. Also there's 2 inches of a clear plastic ribbon coming out of one of the seams (the type you usually see on dresses to hold them up on hangars) just random though.  I don't know exactly what the issue is with the hem on the back, maybe because I have boobs but they're just D cups, but maybe in China where this is probably made they assume you're the build of a 12 year old boy."
2.0,So happy 70th but only 6 rings. So I didn’t have the gift in time for my moms birthday. It’s really pretty but super bummed about that. Check your gift early.
2.0,"The watch is really beautiful. It looks elegant and very sophisticated. It would have received a higher rating if the 12 hadn't fallen off. I took it to the jeweler for a quick fix and re-sizing as the band was very large for my hubby. Other than that it was a bargain of a gift that is well loved.Update 11/17/17, When I go ally took it to the jeweler, he advised it would cost more as the arms fell off as well. Hubby only got to enjoy it for about 4 months before it started falling apart. You get what you pay for."
2.0,"Loved this when I first got it but the long strap broke after 3 weeks, cheap material."
2.0,I love the Cathy tops.  This was not Cathy.  I didn't like the material or the fit.
2.0,The shoes were so cute and my grandson was so happy about his first light up shoes. But after a couple of days one shoe wouldn’t stay charged more than 15-20 minutes.  This is disappointing.
2.0,"I thought maybe given how it looked on the model that this would be supportive enough for jogging, but no such luck. For some reason, manufacturers seem to think if you have a smaller than C cup chest you don't need any support which is just untrue. The primary benefit of having a small chest is that the girls will hopefully not sag as much down the road - but to avoid that I need them to not bounce all over the place when I'm running! The quest continues..."
2.0,"The fit of the jacket was the only thing I liked about this jacket. The material is cheap it's sewn cheap like it was sewn by hand no patern and both the side pockets were sewn together. I thought I was about to place my phone in my pockets, assumed they were mock pockets then realized they were sewn together."
2.0,These did not look good on. Lay acrosstoes weird.
2.0,This is super soft but is not attractive at all. It has huge seems and is not flattering.  Sending it back.
2.0,Not as expected I bought this so excited and got it and was disappointed it looks nothing like this it’s bright red not wine colored. It’s thin and it looks like it has sleeves in the picture it doesn’t. It doesn’t have the vshape at the bottom unless u wear it off center But if you do the sides don’t cover you fabric should have been cut wider
2.0,too thin  does not keep  your work clothes from getting oiled
2.0,"Though the description says these lenses are polarized after receiving them I can tell you that indeed they are not. Went ahead and changed them out on my straightjacket Ive had for almost 10 years. Dropped them too many times over the years and after a festival I scratched up the left lense pretty good. Didn't want to spend a $100 on replacement lenses from Oakley, might as well get new glasses at that price, so I thought replacing the lenses here would be a better deal. Unfortunately I was wrong. Replacing them was fine. Wore them to work on a semi cloudy day with no big deal. When I got off work however the sun was out and let me tell you these lenses did nothing to blockout the sun rays. I literally drove my whole way home with the visor down and my hand blocking out the sun. These say they are polarized but they do not work as advertised Are they dark? Yes. Polarized to keep the rays out as original lenses? Nope. I switched out 1 lense to my original Oakley lense and closing one eye on a bright day you could really tell the difference between the two. I thought I had found the perfect solution to my problem for about a third of the price. Unfortunately you get what you paid for with this brand."
2.0,"I got these for winter running so I wanted them to go down to my ankles as shown in the picture. Unfortunately when I tried them on they only came down to about mid-calf. Also size S fit, but I was afraid if they shrank at all they would be too small. I went by the size chart for S which states a length of 34. Maybe from the waist? The inseam is only 24. They were thick and soft and the pockets were big enough for my phone so they would have worked otherwise."
2.0,These were cool gift for my kids. 1 stopped working the 1st week and my sons head got burnt bc it was snowing and it got wet. the other lasted about a month then just stopped charging. To charge the bluetooth speaker you have to completely take out everything from the hat. They were soft and stretchy but when the speaker is in it pokes into the side of your head so not comfortable to wear. They are not meant to be worn when it is rainy or snowing. There is no protection for the electrical stuff inside and you will get burned. Very hard to sync to phone because there is just 1 button and a led light nothing more
2.0,"Material is faded  like like old dress after one wash, looks cheap, color in n  picture is beautiful but in real it’s totally different"
2.0,"The product images showed a design with the triforce symbol, however the actual ring I received only had a bit of Hylian text.<br /><br />The spinner function works well enough though, so it's fine as a fidget item."
2.0,"I ordered the blue & white dress with the leathery belt. I’m 5’2” and it almost hit my ankles. Yet, the top fit in a weird way. It wouldn’t be a dealbreaker if it wasn’t for the noisy fabric. Not great for wearing casually, but good as a costume piece."
2.0,They run small so bump up to the next size.
2.0,I am 175 pounds and I bought size small but is was big for me runs bigs  😬
2.0,"I suppose this mask may be suitable for these current times when some people are recommending ""double masking"".  It is much thicker and heavier than most paper and cloth masks.<br /><br />HOWEVER, the nose wire is not substantial enough to retain its shape and keep glasses from fogging.  The thickness of the mask causes it to ride up and break the nose seal whenever I move my head downward.<br /><br />To me, it's not worth the price."
2.0,It is not what it looks like in the picture!!
2.0,The way it was depicted in the picture was not what was actually. Item was much tighter and body hugging. I will keep and use under other items. Very sheer and not true to size. I am a medium/large.  I would have needed an xl for the fit portrayed in the picture.
2.0,Broke first time it was worn.
2.0,"I do like the prints, however these are huge!!<br /><br />I was hoping to be able to use them for my kids as well, but that’s a nope. They are even too big for me. Luckily I have a sewing machine and this is an easy fix.<br /><br />But disappointed I even have to fix them. If my girls hadn’t already fell in love with them then I would have sent back."
2.0,The small was too big and it rolls down! Waste of money!
2.0,"I really liked the shape and color of these, but was worried about the comments on sizing. I am a size 11 and ordered an 11, as they have nothing bigger. They were extremely small, almost impossible to fit my heel in. If you're an 11, I would say that these are unfortunately not worth the test, even though they are very cute."
2.0,"it was cute, but small"
2.0,Se pone feo muy rápido
2.0,Meh. Could’ve done better.
2.0,"4.5 year old kiddo, tall legs small waste, normally a size 4t.. The softness and look are great but the sizing is way to tall for a 4T. I had to pull them way up to her chest and wiggle the leggings all the way up to her crotch to take the excess out of the legs and as the few hours went by they slowly came down, though they did hug the legs well. VERY mixed feelings, great quality but they are trying to fit to many sizes at once.  I really wanted to give them a higher rating, and debating on returning them."
2.0,"It's cute, but a 3X didn't fit me quite correctly. And I'm an extra large. I knew I would have to go up a few sizes. This will have to be returned."
2.0,"Skin tight and no real stretch, gave it to a 12 year old"
2.0,"It's very cute, but umbrella is loose and gets to close to rain gauge.  Biggest problem is that base gauge fits into has hump in it that won't allow gauge to remain upright!"
2.0,Just got this today and I’ve been searching for a few lounge like tops for this fall. Tried it on and it’s super thin and see through. I got a large thinking it would just hang off my shoulders and it doesn’t fit like model in the photo. The sleeves are long though. Im usually a medium but I like some shirts a bit bigger and this one is a bit snug for me.
2.0,Used daily since I bought it in Feb 2021. Buckle stopped working today May 2022. Belt itself is comfortable and when it was working it was great. I just expected to last longer than a little over a year. Probably won't buy another can't have my pants falling in the middle of work.
2.0,"Happy they arrived before the specific date, but in the down side there was many duplicates, not glow in the dark. Ok product if looking for just some simple piercings"
2.0,cheap quality!
2.0,"I would of liked these but there is a big pocket on the side of these leggings, which was not showed in the picture"
2.0,"Completely different product - different leopard, different cut & bright white buttons. 2 stars for price"
2.0,See through and material was a little cheap
2.0,Too SMALL
2.0,"These are great to look at. Putting on, not so much. There's no way to keep them from rolling and your thigh must be no bigger than 19-20&#34; wide and for proper sitting placement have a height of 5'5&#34;. I'm 5'1 and went to the bottom of my bum, and with 26&#34; thighs up at the top, no possible way ever these were going to work for our wedding. Deeply saddened because these are the only ones I can find anywhere with this style."
2.0,The size is ok but the material nothing to do with they offer . They are selling Chiffon and the material is so poor 95%  polyester and 5% spandex<br />the only reason I keep it is because i need the color.
2.0,"I waited with excitement for many weeks for these super cute pants to arrive, and was sorely disappointed when they did.  They are made of a very thin, poor quality slippery material identical to what tights would be made out of.  Please note that I didn't even say leggings; I said tights.  They are see through. I can't imagine when these would be wearable except as part of a Halloween costume."
2.0,"These leggings are made of what I can best describe as shape wear material. Very stretchy and shiny, and very tight. I did not like the material, and I returned them."
2.0,"My shoes came in without a box and there was no remote either, I’m confused. I thought there was a remote and I’m really bummed they didn’t come in a box because these are supposed to be a Christmas gift. There is only 1 usb cable which means I can only charge one shoe at a time as well which makes no sense."
2.0,Really cheaply made with a hideous floral print.  Awful
2.0,Quality less than expected
2.0,Uncomfortable fit.
2.0,"This dress was shaped so oddly.  I had to pin it to look right, the fabric was so thin it ripped. Can wear this two nights max."
2.0,It fits very strange. Hits odd at the breast
2.0,Too long and was big
2.0,It looks very cheap .kinda like getting one out of a gumball machine. Wouldn't buy for anyone as a gift cause it's not good quality.
2.0,This fit larger than I was expecting it too and it was also very thin and see through.
2.0,"The fit was all wrong. Doesn’t match the photo at all. If you have larger boobs, forget about it!"
2.0,"5&#34;11&#34; bought a large (long torso) it didn't fit, was entirely to tight, cute but uncomfortable."
2.0,Smells strange and more of a casual scarf than I believed.
2.0,I normally wear an xl/1x and bought this in a 2x just to be safe. It is SO SMALL I couldn’t fit it over my chest.
2.0,Pretty uncomfortable to wear. Tight on my legs.
2.0,Do not recommend. Very cheap material
2.0,"It was great until it wasn't. Today the guide that sits beside the buckle simply broke in half. It appears to be glued in and I'm going to cut it off and see if using the second guide that slides on the band will suffice for now. That one is stitched and the stitches have loose ends, not promising.<br />Basically have to find a replacement."
2.0,these earring tarnish way to fast.
2.0,Feel and look like plastic.  Very small.
2.0,"Sunglasses with reader lenses built in sounds like a fantastic idea, especially if you're middle aged or so and trying to read the back of a label while outside. I generally get a big pair of decent lensed sunglasses to wear over my prescription glasses.<br /><br />These would be so much easier, but the placement of the reader lenses is too low for my face. Unless I hold them up off my nose, I can't read with them. So close. I've never had issues with glasses fitting, but the placement may work better for you."
2.0,"They are adorable! Downside, it was broken 😭!!!"
2.0,"Cheaply made, fit runs smaller than normal. Wouldnt buy again."
2.0,I was not impressed with the material.  It was pretty but it was polyester which I really don’t care for.
2.0,Very thin and small even for my 12 year okd
2.0,"Uncomfortable, felt cheap and itchy. The little pendant fell off the very first time I wore it."
2.0,"Lightweight fabric, color is a darker wine color then photo. There is a burned iron scorch right by the front neckline caused by a bad application job of a teeny, really unnecessary rhinestone. I paid $5 bucks for shipping and did not appreciate that. I gently removed the silly rhinestone and will wear this top for yoga and painting, otherwise I would send it back."
2.0,"Ordered a large when I am usually a medium. The bottoms didn't fit at all... I would've needed an xxl. The top was cute, but I don't think this would last through a season of water and summer fun. I will never know because I returned it."
2.0,"The band is great! It’s super stretchy and I barely notice it’s there. Of course, it took major trial and error to get to that point. The metal piece that holds the end of the strap started to rust against my skin. I thought that it might just be water, so I took it of when I washed my hands and when I did dishes. The problem wasn’t solved and I started to have complete breakouts on my skin. I finally realized that the metal was causing the problem when I looked on the side that was touching my skin. I cut that part off and haven’t had any issues since! I’m still healing, but hopefully I don’t scar."
2.0,"Well, I love the way the dress looks but haven't yet gotten to wear it. There are inconsistencies in the description and the delivery was delayed by three days. It is absolutely not true to size. I am thankful I sized up...twice. I am 5'6"" and weigh 147. I ordered 2x so it would be longer than pictured, and it fits. The dress is a pull-on or a step-into dress, not a wrap dress. When pulling it on, it's a bit tight over arms and chest even though I sized up.  It is made of a thin polyester, so some ladies would definitely want to wear a slip under it. Because it arrived three days later than the expected delivery date, it is going to sit in my closet until I find another occasion suitable for wearing it. After wearing it, it may go down another star. It only got two stars because I liked the way it looked."
2.0,Wanted them to match my tree of life necklace.  They did not properly ang. They kind of stuck out awkwardly. Not satisfied.
2.0,"This looked very interesting when I bought it, but didn't really expect too much.  It is OK, but just OK, because I would never wear them to an important event.  It is more like something you would wear to a county fair."
2.0,"I am 5'4 weighing 130 pounds and got the Medium size. My hopes instantly went down when I unpacked it. The color is dull compared to the picture online and on wearing it, the fit was bad..not a size issue but more misfitting at places. Material is also not for comfortable wear"
2.0,"Was smaller than expected. When received, two stones fell out."
2.0,These frayed and broke on my first trip using them
2.0,"I liked the material and the fit to the top around the neck was to wide or big. The pants were really to small to be a 2xl plus , because it didn't fit around the rear and the stomach arera at all.  Other wise it was a great outfit.. I wouldn't have sent it back..."
2.0,one stone fell out ;-( day one
2.0,Liked appearance but gray background made it difficult to read time.  Lost about 5 minutes weekly.
2.0,"Beautiful color but the fit is terrible. I’m 30,24,34 and the xs bra fits perfectly yet the belt is about 8 inches too large! It wraps around me past the Velcro. I contacted the seller to let them know the measurement on the belt presented is wrong because it’s too large and if I could return it. Not only did the seller scold me to say it’s my fault (somehow) that the xs they sent doesn’t fit me but it’s my responsibility to pay shipping out of my pocket to send him this back and they can examine the belt and if they agree they would refund. I’m not spending more money out of pocket to ship this internationally, come on!"
2.0,I like this bra (which I bought in both pink and blue) in every way except the straps are too short for me.
2.0,After washing they leave lint everywhere. You just can’t get it off so the pants are worthless
2.0,"Look cheap and feel cheap. , mine came scratched up"
2.0,"Too small, not really a 56"
2.0,I liked the look of the hat but it didn't fit my head well.  I felt like it didn't sit down low enough on my head.  It was too small.  I don't have a large head.  I've never had a issue wearing ball caps before.
2.0,"These are more like nylons and definitely not the &#34;stretch knit&#34; feel I expected.  Pretty scratchy too.  Back they go.  Other than that, they fit ok so if you're looking for a base layer under a skirt or something this would work ok."
2.0,"Soft material, but thin. The color was lovely. The under-boob seam had no stretch and was too small for my chest (40DD)."
2.0,to small not at all what it looks like comes as a silk screen cheap wouldnt wear
2.0,"This pendant is very tiny  and delicate. Though its not bad quality, I dont care for the super pink/coppery color of the ""rose-gold""."
2.0,This mask runs super small. Would've returned it if it hadn't ripped trying to put it on. Not worth the price
2.0,"Many of the paws were missing one or more rhinestones.  I got them to sell at a Bark in the Park festival, but only had enough complete ones for 2 earrings and one necklace.  I'm stuck with the rest until I can find small enough rhinestones to fix them."
2.0,The material is a lot warmer than I expected. Not good for the summer in a warm climate.
2.0,I ordered 9-12 month. Outfit is very large.
2.0,Looks as fake as bolivian tuna
2.0,Screen scratches easily band broke after 2 months
2.0,"This. Watch. Is. Crap.<br /><br />The watch band attachment pins easily ripped out of the mounting bracket on the frame of the watch. My young son didn't have it for a week before this happened... The band ripped out as he was taking his long-sleeve shirt off....<br /><br />Only $10, but.......still."
2.0,Cheaply made. Can feel the sunlight through it. Doesn't do what it promises. Got a Sunburn.
2.0,This will not stay on your face. Fabric slips right off. It’s not because my head is small either. I’ve got a big old melon<br />May work for someone that only wants to use it for your neck
2.0,Did not like them. looked way too much like Great Grandma's underwear
2.0,It was very itchy and not flattering at all like it is in the picture.
2.0,"This is the second order I have placed with this company. The first order- came a different brand, not “ambiance” as it is advertised. I returned them. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe it was a size issue so I ordered again and even waited as there was a back order.... received them and again NOT AMBIANCE!"
2.0,"Elastic inside a waistband not as wide, as it should be. What the point?!🤷🏻‍♀️"
2.0,Cute dress but poor quality. The hem at the bottom was already falling apart when I took it out of the bag.
2.0,"This didn’t come with the boots and mittens, just the snow suit."
2.0,"Not what i expected. Shirt and overalls were one piece, and material was cheap.  Frayed during first use.  Fit well."
2.0,Items received were not as shown. Five pack of assorted colors - not the colors shown in photo though.
2.0,Magnets fell off after only one day’s worth of wearing!
2.0,The dress is fine except the zipper doesn't work and I've contacted the seller and they are slow to get back to you. The dress took forever to get here (2 months) and now it's defective and I can't do anything before the wedding I am in. I am disappointed with the customer service of both the seller and amazon.
2.0,"When I first started using the purse I noticed it was a very cheaply made purse, but what can I expect it was $10. I noticed it was holding up in for what I used it for (everyday use) though the strap was quite short and didn't work as a cross body strap. I've had the purse for roughly 1.5 months and the strap broke last night, the hooks used for the strap wet probably the cheapest part of the purse, it just snapped for no reason."
2.0,"turns your wrist black, and catches on material..."
2.0,"The quality wasn't what I expected. The shirt fit, but the arms were too small and cut off my circulation. Very disappointing because it is a cute top."
2.0,Runs very small. This is not a Bella Canvas shirt. It’s a very tight 2x.
2.0,To snalk
2.0,Scratchy material and sleeves fall at a weird spot
2.0,These are more like leggings than they are gym pants. I'll rather wear them under something than on their own.
2.0,"I ordered several silky shorts, some were prime, some were not. The ""prime"" one were lined and had 3 belt loops. The non prime shorts were not lined, and only had 2 belt loops, plus the color was different. Instead of being gold, navy blue and white striped, it is orange, not gold, which I don't like. Disappointed."
2.0,"I have bought these shoes before. I got a dud I guess. The piece that you use to tighten, the toggle I guess you call it won't hold. My kiddos shoes are too big and falling off less than 15 minutes into playing."
2.0,It’s really nice.
2.0,"The concept is excellent and the quality is good, but the size is very small."
2.0,"I love it in theory, but beware. The fit of this garment is off. And the torso is very short. If you are looking for something to show off your midriff in the winter, this sweater is for you. I returned it."
2.0,"The material is soft and it fits fine, but the fabric is SO THIN AND CLINGY. yuck. I think I've worn it once."
2.0,Alot tighter than I thought
2.0,"To say this is a loose fit is an understatement. The xs fits like an xl. To their credit, I really should've read the measurements. Luckily I got it on flash sale and I gave it to a friend."
2.0,In the picture it looks much bigger but it actually is very small. It is very pretty thou if you need a SMALL necklace. If I knew it was that small I wouldn’t have bought it for the price I payed
2.0,"We could see light through the mask so plan on sewing additional fabric onto it if it bothers you.  Graphics wise, its a fun mask but I wouldn't recommend it if you want good coverage out of the box."
2.0,Quality is poor!
2.0,Looked extremely cheap and plastic like.
2.0,"This dress is super soft and fits like I expected, but it has a grey stain on the breast area. I am using it for pictures so I can have it photoshopped out, but very irritating."
2.0,good quality but super big
2.0,"Color sucks.<br />Nothing distressed about it... Might be able to put some warm water to it, beat it awhile and microwave it, and it MIGHT not suck so bad.<br />Not even worth the hassle.of returning it.<br />Going to give it away. Next time I'll shop at higher end mall"
2.0,Very small. I'm not a child so I will be returning unfortunately.
2.0,Very cheaply made. Definitely not worth the $29.99. I don't know what kind of pins this was made for but the pages are way too thick for putting pins in. The fabric is cheaply put together with the bag coming with loose threads all over. The page are put together with 3 uneven strips of velcro on the edges in order to fold them and I don't think anyone who made these has actually used this bag because it constantly scratches you and gets in the way.
2.0,"Arrived on time and was packaged nicely... I absolutely loved the necklace, perfect length, adorable, shiny, not too big, not too small... Unfortunately after only a few days of wearing it I had a huge green ring around my neck... Its a shame cause other then that it's really a cute necklace."
2.0,"The only way to describe this top is ""cheap"". It feels thin and is just cheaply made. I do appreciate the adjustable shoulder straps, but the material in the back is so thin and unforgiving, so it is being returned."
2.0,There are padded inserts within the bra.  They are not attached at all.  When you wash the bra they get all tangled up.  It takes quite a bit of work to get them realigned.  Not what I paid for.  I returned them.
2.0,The fabric is very thin and the seams started tearing after I wore it only twice.
2.0,"Only one out of five of the compasses worked. But other than that, they were ok."
2.0,Not even close to a US sizing on the chart..I wear a large or 12 and this was more like a small.
2.0,"Soooo, where do I start. The smell is HORRID! It's been outside since we received it and still no sign of the stench reducing. Not even a little. Ha! The handle is so long even at the very last loop, it hands down to my husband's knees but that's an easy fix. He plans to just add another hole to the strap to accommodate him. The bag looks NOTHING like the photo. It's doused in grease and it's pretty big. It's all dark due to the grease, does not look scuffed up like the Amazon photo shows. I want to return this bag but the hubbs is convinced it's gonna work out.... ugh! Not worth it!"
2.0,I just love it unfortunately The material is beading up on the front.
2.0,I don't recommend for the price this jacket is selling for.
2.0,It’s already fading and dirty looking. I bought the rose gold one and it’s been a month. Are we supposed to wash these things!? Some times it snags in clothes and scratches my son when I pick him up.
2.0,"Fits fine but the slit is way to high. Im 5'7... guess ill just wear it with shorts, its still really cute tho."
2.0,The pin fell out on one of the clasps the first week I used them which is why I ordered a different brand which works great. I had to use a paperclip to hold it together until I received the other item I ordered to replace this one.
2.0,"I loved these pants when I first put them on. So comfortable, wonderful fit and the material felt smooth and soft. Unfortunately after three washing they look like the picture, the piling is really ugly.  I can’t afford pants that don’t last any better than this.8"
2.0,"The fabric doesn’t seem good quality to me, and didn’t like how it fits. It’s too wide on the heaps and tide on the bottom, which makes a weird shape on me. I wanted a straight kind of length.<br />I wouldn’t buy again."
2.0,"I loved this glasses when they came in, but it didn’t last."
2.0,"The dress has a nice flow to it and fits true to size. However, the color was an ugly green nothing like the website, so I returned."
2.0,Does not fit the fitbit 2  pins keep falling out
2.0,Toucjscreen
2.0,Small is almost a large in women. I'm petite however most women's smalls fit and I was swimming in this hoodie...
2.0,No ZIPPER! Hard time getting into jumper. Thread came out and neck area loose. Plus lines dont line up on thighs. They are crooked.
2.0,Don’t like it very small I thought it was larger.
2.0,Too hard to put the straps on the glasses had to wait 3 days after I put the pens in. Like it said to do.
2.0,"Cheaply made, doesn’t look like the picture, cumbersome to put on"
2.0,"I ordered size 10 for my 7 yr gal, but still it ran too small for her. huge difference between the size chart and the original product.<br />its a waste for me."
2.0,"I am typically a women's medium, I sized up just to be safe. The product runs very small and was pretty tight, even for work-out gear."
2.0,The XL fits like a small.  Won't even close properly so the deep V is way way way too low and the wrap bottom meets at the top of my thigh.  Everything else I have gotten from this company fit as expected.  This really sucks because it is exactly what I wanted.  It has to go back.
2.0,My only issues is it's not ansi therefore I cant wear it.
2.0,Doesn't stay on wrist without a hair band.
2.0,"They are oversized, as stated, and heavy! They leave indents on my cheeks, so I don't wear them as often as I would like."
2.0,"If your face is tiny, and the bridge of your nose is almost non-existant, it is probably awesome.  The pic looks awesome, especially is you're going for the Michelle Pfeiffer look, But there was no real way to cut it and still make it work.  Unfortunately, I butchered it (so I cannot return it) because I really, really wanted it to work, but I couldn't make it work."
2.0,"It’s an Iron on patch. No glitter, no glitz. It is what it is and you get what you pay for. Amazon is selling more and more of this  CHEAP CHINESE crap that is below quality and not available for prime delivery. BE CAREFUL WHEN SHOPPING AMAZON anymore."
2.0,Looked great but broke the first time I wore it.
2.0,I bought these sneakers in the past and when my son went to put them in today we received two right sneakers.
2.0,Breast size shold be wide
2.0,The sweatshirt looks good!But I got a 6x and fits like a 2x.
2.0,"I did check to make sure that I got the correct size that I ordered, and I did. The waist is a little smaller than expected, but it fit. The legs are so tight that I can’t cross my legs while sitting. Big pockets, or I would give one star."
2.0,"11/3/21 - I have worn this daily for the past month, and although it is decently comfortable and non-irritating to my skin, the little metal clip thing came unglued or something.  I can pop it back in with a little finesse, but it pops out the next time I take the watch off and there goes that wasted time.<br /><br />Updated 11/6/2021<br />Got some gorilla super glue gel clear (I read that Loctite Ultra Gel Control also works for silicone), we’ll see how it holds up."
2.0,"The picture NEEDS to be updated.  I needed a silver sparkle shoe for my daughter.  When I received these they have a hologram type of sparkle to them (pink, blue, green).  They are not pure silver like the picture.  Very disappointed and returned them.  No idea of the fit or comfort due to sending them back."
2.0,"Excited about this purchase at first until it arrived. The outfit was super thin and see-through. If a shaper was under it, that too could be seen. Purchased this outfit for California, but had to return it."
2.0,The top was well stretched but the bottom didn’t stretch much. It just ruined the rest<br />Or maybe it’s designed for woman with a small butt.
2.0,"Print on this tshirt is very small...beware.  Same color and words as pictured but size of text is way off.  Nonetheless,  text is on a basic white cotton shirt.  Fits as expected."
2.0,I'm returning this scarf. It was half the size of what's shown in the picture.
2.0,"The suit and pattern look great and the material is good, but I have a 34DDD chest and have no idea how I’m going to wear this. There is no support in it at all and only small fabric cups inside. I’ve replaced them with larger ones in the slits but when I zip the suit up I still look like I have a rolling uniboob. I may have to find a thin underwire bra to wear inside it (which kind of defeats the purpose!)"
2.0,Not as bright as I thought it would be but my toddler still loves this.
2.0,after 7 months the plastic clip that holds the wallet to gather has broken!<br />I would not buy another!
2.0,Cute bra if it was anywhere near my size. I even sized up times two.
2.0,Super big even knowing is a small size
2.0,It looks like what i paid for it. Cheap!
2.0,"Even though these are fairly inexpensive these are dollar store quality and so the $10 price tag is definitely more than they’re worth. Nothing is sewn together, everything is attached with hot glue. So these won’t hold up long but they’ll work for our cat costume."
2.0,The men's bracelet is fine I love the woman's bracelet but I've only had it 2 weeks and the stones fell out of it already
2.0,"The purple color is lovely and I wore it once without washing it. It fit well, was a little long for me at 5' 2"". After I washed it and let it line dry I found pilling on the front and weird lines through out the fabric. Worn & washed once. Won't wear it again, donating it. Shame."
2.0,"Beware: The cap is great - But, a purchase multiple hats, TWICE, seller ONLY sends 1 hat with batteries and 2 without these batteries, which are not cheap!"
2.0,I should have gotten a larger size xL looked like it could fit a 10 year old girl
2.0,"I ordered the black in a large size. Immediately I was happy with the color and I was worried about the size but the large worked well for me. I didn't want it so loose that it would be shifting on my head and not so tight that it is too snug on my head. Again the leather will stretch out slightly. I feel like I may have received a defective hat. The hat is not symmetrical at all. A picture will be posted under customer photos showing the major imperfections of the hat. For 55 dollars I expected both good build quality and good material and I feel like the $55 price is not worth it for this hat. The string to hold the ear flaps down came unstitched on one ear within a few times of trying on the hat looking in the mirror to see how it looked in the different styles to wear it. The one good thing I have to say about the hat is that the rabbit fur is extremely soft and the color is great. Other than that other problems are the ear flaps sticking up (almost like bunny ears) when buckled above the head instead of laying along the surface of the top of the hat. One stretch of leather is clearly different than the other pieces of leather and looks very strange when compared closely. It also almost has a pleather feel compared to the other patches of soft leather. I will try to show this in a picture. The back cross stitching is not even close to being lined up which I will show in a picture as well. I wish I had good thigns to say because all of the other reviews were so high for this hat but my advise is stay away and either pay the price for a Wigens or go cheaper and don't expect a really nice hat like I was for $55. As always the prime shipping was great and arrived on time so if you are in a hurry for a hat, go for it and hope you get a better made hat than I did! I hope this helps you in your decision process."
2.0,"I thought I'd be able to use these to dance on hard wood floors and save my feet from getting blisters. They cover the right areas but the leather on the sole and toe is not a very good quality and doesn't provide enough friction to keep me feeling safe and balanced. It's like dancing in socks, which is much too slippery. I've never kept them on longer than a few seconds."
2.0,"These started out ok.... The adjustable strap around the ear contains plastic adjusters that can easily be taken off by kids. If that adjustable plastic piece is removed, the mask will dangle below kids’ noses. We tried tying them but the knot rubs behind kids’ ears making them uncomfortable. They are cute but unless your kid won’t mess with the plastic piece look for something else."
2.0,Poor quality. Paying $21+ is not worth it. This should only cost $5.00.
2.0,"Not 3D like it looks in the picture.  Still cute, but not what I thought."
2.0,It was delivered without the cuff links. Felt cheated. Have not even bothered to use it. Quality seems ok though. Did not come in any case. Tie and Square were just thrown into a package containing the shoes I also ordered.
2.0,"Keeping time very well. Have had it for about a week. Looks sleek, even though I was a bit worried about it not adjusting size due to a comment in the questions section, the band is like a normal time or Casio metal band and links can be removed in the same manner. I will try to remember and update about time keeping at a later date. Update: The watch still keeps time rather well, however after putting it in my backpack for a few hours the bezel popped off about a month and a half after purchase. It had to be glued back on. Color on band also fades quickly. Still looks good and works, but will be bumping down a star.<br />Update 2: One day after my last update, the watch decided to say goodbye. The winding knob broke off as I was turning it. Even for 25 bucks a watch should last longer than a month and a half. Bumping it down again."
2.0,This product runs small ...  if you wear a medium then you'll need a large
2.0,"I normally wear Large, 36” or 38” pants. I have somewhat thin legs. I ordered an XL and the size was OK, although it was a little snug even then, although not uncomfortable.<br /><br />The material underneath is good and feels great. The pocket is very protective of the phone, even something as large as an iPhone 12 Max Pro with case. The outer material for the shorts is very flimsy and looks terrible. It’s very light, so if that’s what you’re going for, it’s fine.<br /><br />I wasn’t satisfied when I received it, so I returned it. A better material for the outer shorts would have changed my mind."
2.0,The side arms aren’t tight enough to keep the glasses pressed against the head. One turn of the head from both my toddler and four year old sent the glasses falling to the ground.
2.0,"This dress was to large, I am 5'4 and weight around 115, the dress also took forever (like 1 month) to get here, I ended up returning today and shipping was $30 so before you buy just make sure you know that if it doesn't fit you or you're displease you will be the one to pay a return the return cost and can range around what I paid.<br /><br />The dress felt loose and I was dragging it on the floor when I walked. I used it for 5 minutes and decided to change because the dress just felt huge on me, I thought it would have a ""slimmer"" look :(<br /><br />2 stars for how nice the color was, -3 stars because of return cost, how long it was, and how big it felt"
2.0,"Was way to big,"
2.0,They wouldn't stay on my teeth.  Sucks. Wish I tried them on the night before the party or new they weren't going to stay on.<br />*Note: Google searching lead me to find out a lot of people use Polygrip to get their grills to say on.<br />So I'm giving these 2 stars because they still look cool and I can try them with Polygrip but -3 because it doesn't come with everything you need.<br />Also it ruined my tongs. I suggest using something disposable to pick them up with.
2.0,"Bought a bra the exact same size that fit perfectly and this one nearly choked me. It's pretty, but way too tight."
2.0,I won’t recommend.They are nice to look at but the stones are not sturdy . I won’t recommend to anyone.
2.0,"Doesn't work good every time I need to check, or ask some one for time and fix it , but.. Good style."
2.0,"I was surprised when I opened this. It’s not a cardigan, or fitted in any way. It’s a big rectangle with two quarter inch stitching under the arms to connect the front to back. It works, but it’s not at all what I expected."
2.0,"This shirt is cute and the colors are vibrant but it says inspike instead of ""inspire"" and mdtivate instead of ""motivate"" 🤣 🤦🏼‍♀️"
2.0,I like them but a pair last me about a week.  I am medium build and can brake a pair in half my just wrinkling my forehead.  Most of the time a lens will pop out because the frame brakes.  Make sure you buy super glue if you get these.
2.0,"The bottom of this is actually adorable, but WOW you can't wear this if you have any boobs. AT ALL.  I'm not really 100% sure how you're supposed to wear this without showing everyone everything.<br /><br />Might make a cute skirt."
2.0,"After I washed the three facemask I received, only one was wearable. The elastic broke on one and the other one shrank. I suppose one out of three is not so bad considering what I paid for them."
2.0,"They're okay. I like the cotton fabric. However, and this is not the fault of the sock, my feet are very big and wide. I wear a size 9, and these barely cover my toes. I bought them to keep my leather mules from getting funky and sweaty, and they do more or less work for that purpose, They're better than nothing. The strap on the back is too narrow and digs into my Achilles tendon a bit, so I pull it into the velcro strap on the back of my shoes and tuck it in so it's invisible and that helps. Also, the quality is all over the road, and a couple of them are just too tiny to wear at all.<br /><br />I actually had better luck buying a pair of low cut footies in a nude color and slitting the heel out of them. They're invisible, they fit better, and the back part of the footy doesn't dig in so badly.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, I guess if you don't have Sasquatch feet, they'll probably work out okay for you."
2.0,The zipper broke the 2nd week of having it!!!😤😵😤
2.0,"The sunglasses were cute, but didn't hold up very well. A couple broke right away. They all broke eventually."
2.0,Super big for a medium cheaply made!
2.0,These were not stretchy. They hugged my thighs which made the crotch area poof out. I have a butt and thighs so this was a terrible fit. It didn’t flow off my legs.
2.0,"This coverup barely hits my hip and is much more snug than the photo shows. I'm 5'4&#34; and busty with a 28&#34;. I measured this coverup and from the center front of the neck to the center bottom hemline it is only 20&#34;, from the center back if the neck to the center bottom hemline it is 26&#34;, from the shoulder seams to the bottom center hemline it is 28&#34;, from shoulder seam to side bottom hemline is 26&#34;, and at the waist is it only 16&#34; wide pretty much all of the way down, which would mean a max of a 32&#34; bust, waist, or hip and that would be snug. The model in the photo must be 4'10, and 80 lbs maximum! There are also loose threads all over. Too bad they don't make multiple sizes, it is really cute otherwise."
2.0,"Too small, couldn’t get germs in jacket"
2.0,"I do like this bag!  But just a heads up this is a lint and hair magnet ! I cannot keep lint off of this I washed it I sprayed it nothing works it's horrible !!I<br />I was going to return it right just trying so hard to get the lid off of the stupid thing I have to not wear clothes that will rub off on it and cause more lint ...  I have to carry a lint roller with me to use on this bag ! it's just a pain!<br />This is a nice big bag though ...  still trying to find a way to keep the lint off  it's got all kinds of compartments I can put my 25 ounce stainless steel water bottle in it... there is a slot just for that! Its great for camping or hunting, or taking a trip."
2.0,"Ordered this tie for my 5 year old son, but when it came it had small black spots (stains) on it. The length and color were great, but if its a new product it shouldn't arrive dirty. I'm returning it."
2.0,"I was so stoked to find fuzzy socks for my husband (guys like soft stuff too). Unfortunately, these will not fit man-sized man feet at all. Fit great on 7.5 woman feet though, score for me!"
2.0,"When using the light feature, it only lights up the hour. you can not see the minutes"
2.0,"I think these sunglasses are very pretty.  Problem is:  they don't fit over my regular glasses.  I would like to return them, but I am not sure how to go about it."
2.0,"The F91W is a great watch, but I'd recommend finding a different source than Amazon for them if you want the best F91 you can get. I went through 3 watches from amazon, every single one had varying degrees of noticeable bubbling in the crystal. My f91 purchased in a local watch store and one I purchased directly from Casio did not have these issues at all. The watches still function, they're authentic and keep good time. If you don't care about finish flaws and just need a functional watch, definitely snag one here for the cheap price."
2.0,Did not come with battery. Does not get that warm either.
2.0,So if you are looking for real nice Nike shorts i would keep looking because these aren't the real Nike leggings and that definitely ran large
2.0,This shirt is cute but came with several holes in the back.  Attempted to return but was not Prime and not worth the cost to return. I'm not happy that I have to pay to return a defective item.
2.0,Beautiful colored. Loved the feeling of the material but was too small. Material ended up being what I refer too as sucker( likes too suck in and stick to skin). Just wish it would have been more of a fit to size
2.0,The chest area is extremely small. Maybe as I keep losing weight it will fit better.
2.0,"looked as cheap as it cost, the links kept on coming loose. used it once and gave it away"
2.0,There are holes in each pocket of the dress and it’s extremely large in the waist area
2.0,Salió muy corto!
2.0,"I order  a 2x for my cousin that is oringaly a 1x . the 2x fit like a shirt , it was short and wayyy too small"
2.0,"I was super excited to get this in the mail, tried it on and it was some what large but I figured washing it would fix that but before I could even take it off I noticed the shoulder wouldn’t lay right, so I looked in the mirror and the shoulder is stitched onto the back of the shirt. Returning and maybe I’ll try ordering again. ):"
2.0,Epdate: main zipper completely fell off after a month.  Such crap!  Don't buy.<br />Worn 4 times and the zipper broke in all the pockets. Missed the return window by 2 weeks.  Crap!  No way to secure my kids gloves and no other pockets.  Not happy.
2.0,"Fit is good but the quality was inferior.  Good customer service, though."
2.0,"First off I sent it back, so there's that. I wanted a down beanie and didn't want to she'll out. Unfortunately this hat was as silly looking as it was uncomfortable. It seemed to be the right size but the elastic is very annoying. I ordered the aegismax down good to go with my EE 20 degree quilt and I couldn't be happier with it. It's crazy cheap for the quality and only six dollars more."
2.0,"The skirt material is VERY stiff, scratchy, and uncomfortable.  The top portion is soft but I will definitely be returning."
2.0,"While they seem to reduce the glare, the print seems to be blurry."
2.0,I didn't bother sending them back but they are very large.
2.0,Extremely small for size.
2.0,They look great on but they do pinch after about 30 minutes to where I have to take them off. Maybe over time it will feel better? They look great for a quick photo but it’s not some thing I would be able to wear out for a night on the town.
2.0,"Love the print a d the soft material. Unfortunately, as a mask, it has little structure...gets stuck in mouth and is frustrating to wear if one speaks at all."
2.0,"The material and cut are cute, but there's a problem with the sizing of the arms vs the torso.  The small fits me great everywhere except the shoulders.  There's not enough give in the armholes, so any time you want to move your arms up, the material pulls or restricts your movements.  Good for a costume, bad for real clothing."
2.0,"Didn't like the material, expected higher quality material."
2.0,"I honestly never post reviews or at least not very often but this experience really has been poor. I purchased this product and have only worn it a handful of times and never in the shower or in water. But as the attached photos show, the print is legitimately rubbing of or flaking ish off and making the band look very unattractive.  I only bought this about a month or so and it really let me down as a consumer to see it."
2.0,Nice watch but th actual watch is rather large they say unisex but can't see a woman wearing this
2.0,"Way big says one size fits but the sleeves are too long,  i'm 5'2 and it goes before my knees.  Wraps around me almost twice and in average build."
2.0,"The fit isn't good, I guess they assume that if you need a medium then that means you have huge boobs...the straps are too loose, so there isn't a very good fit. It also gives no support. This is very uncomfortable"
2.0,If you are in the medical field and are looking for a great lab coat this would be perfect!
2.0,I wore the clear one for a week and the heart broke off the top! So disappointed because I really like them!!
2.0,Definitely not 16g as advertised. They are very flexible though - so if you're looking for that then maybe go for these. I was looking for something a little more sturdy so these didn't work for me. I was mostly upset that they were clearly not 16g (size of most lip piercings) and more like 18g or even 20g (the size of usual ear piercings). That was a huge difference and the main reason I returned the product. I probably would have kept it if it was at least the right size.
2.0,For church one of the sock  had a run it
2.0,Too small for adults<br />Ok for children<br />A waste  I of I my I money
2.0,"Thought this would look good for a halloweed costume, but it was too tight and high in the back."
2.0,So poorly made and almost completely see thru. I don't think I would ever wear it in public even as a beach cover up.
2.0,"Ordinarily, soft leather would be plus for any product but for this one it isn't (how many times have you heard that?). It isn't structured enough to carry things that will clip in like a knife or flashlight nor will it hold things in place very well. Also, there are not two pockets -- just a slit in one pocket. The picture seems a bit deceiving. I'm not sure what the purpose of the slit is but as soon as I saw that and felt the leather, I knew I was returning it. I don't recommend this for its stated purpose. However, if you need something soft with one slot and a slit that seems to be relatively well made, this may be it."
2.0,Cute but way smaller than anticipated
2.0,This belt is very cheap and Flimsy looking. Luckily I bought two different belts because of the bad reviews. I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,Very pretty but really long. Wear leggings kinda shirt. Might need to order down a size
2.0,"Them China girls or smaller then US chics. And the clothes fits Lil teen girls like the picture but not grown women 🙄. So xl will reach your ribs if you thinking it's going to be long ""nope it's not"
2.0,it broke first time i tried to wear it :-(
2.0,Sweater is poorly constructed. Sleeves were not sewn into the shoulder properly so the shoulder length is extremely long. I wouldn't waste my $ on this.
2.0,They were tight and after the first wear i had a hole in each foot.
2.0,"Great price, it's very roomy with lots of pocket space. However, it fell apart at the top and side seams after one week of use."
2.0,"Fit small compared to others.  Very thin robe which i liked, but the white was almost see through.  Will exchange for a different size and color."
2.0,"Weird fabric and fit, would not recommend"
2.0,"I purchased this item to be able to wear my FitBit AltaHR sylishly instead of having to wear the plastic band that came with it.  I'm rating it as a 2 star simply because of the problems that I have had with it, I'll explain below:<br /><br />Pros:<br />It's stainless steel<br /><br />Has a nice weight to it<br /><br />Looks great<br /><br />Fits great<br /><br />Cons:<br />The clasp location I feel is in a bad place (I realize that I could have flipped it around, but the way that I had it set up was the clasp was on the outside of my wrist - left side of left wrist) because its right on the lateral edge immediately beside where the FitBit plugs into the bracelet.  If you set your wrist down the wrong way or bump the side of your wrist into something (such as pushing open a car door), pop.... it comes off.<br /><br />I've only had it for a short time and one of the pins has fallen out therefore making it unable to wear.  I put the pin back in, but it wouldn't stay and now the pin is gone.<br /><br />It is stainless steel, but it does ding easily with normal wear.  With only having worn it a short time, it already has a few scuff/scratch marks on the bottom (inside of your wrist where your tendons lay) of it.<br /><br />I really liked the product but with the craftsmanship, I can't help but to give it 2 stars."
2.0,Fit fine... but very cheaply made
2.0,"This is pretty, but the pendant fell off before I even really wore it even once."
2.0,I tried to give these a chance but the material looks nothing like the picture. They slide and ride up and do not stay in place. The material is a thin polyester feel to it. I regret buying these and am bummed out because it truly is hard to find decent fitting long razor back tank tops.<br />The two stars is for the quick shipping and packaging.
2.0,"Very ill fitting, go down a size"
2.0,I didn't expect the material to be so flimsy and form fitting.  It did not flow or drape like the picture.
2.0,"The seams started to fray about a week into having them, and the two front top pockets are very shallow, so everything will fall out when you sit down. The velcro around the pockets have start to break away."
2.0,Charms pop off shoe
2.0,One glove fit tighter than the other. I requested a refund but would have to pay for postage.
2.0,Does not stick together as well as other double side tape. Does not last long or hold a closure on blouses.
2.0,El producto no me gustó
2.0,Very beautiful and comfortable. But it lasted a month when the buckle in the watch broke and I lost my Apple Watch..thank god someone returned it
2.0,2 straps ripped after 2 wears & washes(cold water only) and Hang Dry
2.0,"Great socks, but they make impossible to get them loose without snagging 2 of the pairs.  They do not allow enough room to snip the plastic hooks, and they were wrapped up in the fabric of the socks"
2.0,"The material is extremely thin and see-through, even in Navy. You'd have to wear a slip under it. If you're ok with that, then otherwise it fits true to size, but maybe a little on the small side."
2.0,Cute oversized dress but I received it cut up.<br />No hem and it’s uneven from them cutting it 🤷🏻‍♀️ Think I’m going to send it back.
2.0,The material is spandex and looks like polyester. Not very flattering
2.0,"These have cute fabric, but are smaller than size indicated by at least one size."
2.0,I didn’t have this very long it’s already  broken I would suggest a keychain that is more sturdy and doesn’t come apart as this one did. I did think that it was a beautiful keychain though.
2.0,No llego el producto pero me regresaron el dinero
2.0,"Returning item. Light weight, soft material, cut weird - not flattering to my body."
2.0,Band is super thick and doesn't form well to wrist....
2.0,I love the Gaiam brand but found these leggings fell short of their normal quality. The leggings are very stiff and uncomfortable to practice a yoga flow class in.
2.0,"I put the pants on,  turned them on high and sat on the couch for about 15-20 minutes and felt very little heat."
2.0,"I purchased a couple of dez for my rap video I made last week.  For some reason dez joins just don't sparkle like I thought day would.  I was like, &#34;damn!, these joints don't got that sparkle&#34;. I was looking for something with dat fire i guess.  Anyway, I let the girls have them for being good sports."
2.0,"I paid for 3 packs of leggings, only received 1 pack.  On the only I received, as soon as I tried on, I noticed there are 2 holes on it. Returned item and received a full refund.  Overall an disappointed experience."
2.0,"I ordered this dress for a bridesmaid dress and it fit nice, but sadly plans had to change for the bride. I requested a return within less than a month and was denied. I would use caution - if this dress dosent fit, don't count on returning it!"
2.0,did not hold up well.  Velcro kept opening.
2.0,Shoulders fit ok but but not enough coverage for hips and thighs. I'm a bit heavy but not obese. I would hate to wear it sitting  down in company..
2.0,The watch lost color quick
2.0,"Necklace snapped almost immediately.  The charm was cute, but I’ll need to get a new chain."
2.0,"I washed my navy and gray nightgown with other items.  It faded onto some items and ruined them!  I hope that when I bleach the load when I re-wash the items, that the dye comes out completely!  I am very upset because I have other black and navy nightgowns and when I wash them altogether, they've never faded at all."
2.0,"The material was coarse and the straps just didnt make sense up or down, despite the reviews. Im just under 5'3"" and I ordered up but they were snug on my thick thighs and the straps were super long. Not recommend for shorties..."
2.0,"Cute but way too small! I ordered them big, but they were still to small."
2.0,It’s not easy to breath at all. The mask also has a  terrible smell that even after washing with some soapy water still does not go away.<br /> I actually had the taste of this mask in my mouth for about a day even tho I only had it on for about 30 seconds prior to washing it and again after washing it and then even rinsing it a few times . Don’t bother .
2.0,"After hours and hours of searching for an umbrella that was made well, would last and had good reviews, I purchased one. I was thrilled when it arrived, boxed nicely and seemed done real professionally. The holding sleeve is great and the umbrella is made very sturdy seeming. Well, I just had a chance to use it yesterday and it failed unfortunately! After 15 minutes a gust of wind blew and turned it inside out (It was not even very windy). I pushed the button like it said and nothing happened. I struggled with trying to get it turned right side in and of course it’s raining. After some time I got it down for it just to happen again. At this point I gave up and put up my jacket hood and hurried home. Really disappointed... it seemed like a fantastic solution to crummy umbrellas, but it just couldn’t hold up. Sorry!"
2.0,"I took a chance with it not being Prime. Well it’s too big, especially in the waist, and although the sleeves are cute, they make your arms look big. Now if I want to return it, I have to pay shipping back to China. Disappointing, lesson learned not to order something not on Prime if I’m not 100% sure I’ll like it."
2.0,These are a fun statement but they fall apart very easily. I have had to put the petals back on them many times each time I wear them. I wouldn’t purchase these.
2.0,"Very thin, a bit more blousy at the bottom then expected. No liner."
2.0,"Had to return them. There is an additional brown color in the pattern which met in the seam of the pants in the back. Needless to say, at my age I need no suspicious brown stains on the seat of my pants. The pattern is throughout the outfit. It is just not my style."
2.0,The Picture of the Mask appears to have Glitter on it but it does not.  How ever it is a good mask it has Adjustable Straps on each side and comes with (2) Mask Filters.  The main reason I ordered was for the Glitter but I am going to keep it.  It has other attributes.
2.0,"I was disappointed. First, the bracelet made it two days before charms started falling off. Specifically the potion bottle. Second, the book of fairy tales is a holy bible charm. Third, it made it about three weeks before rusting and turning my wrist green. I never wore it in the shower, or any other form of water. I was excited for it. Definitely NOT worth the price."
2.0,"I've been looking EVERYWHERE for a white organic cotton cardigan.  I was  hoping this would be it based on the product pictures.  However, the &#34;sand&#34; color is not even close to white.  It is much more of a khaki color.  Returned."
2.0,Returned. Much bigger than anticipated.
2.0,"The material is very thin, the top is very long. Like a dress, I might wear it as a nightshirt"
2.0,I need to wear nude underwear and a long shirt with wearing this. COMPLETELY SEE THROUGH!!!!
2.0,Got my size 6/7 child this and she won’t be able to wear it until she’s in a 12.
2.0,Order a couple sizes up if you have boobs
2.0,I so wanted to give it five stars. I ordered one size up I got a large it fit just like a medium I loved the material it was like a workout material it kept you cool. But after the second wash the seams came undone and is ruined I guess that’s what you get for buying a 4 dollars shirt.
2.0,"The back is beautiful but the tassels started falling off right away and the front makes you look like a nun. I’m afraid to try to wash it, I have worn it once and it is falling apart"
2.0,NOT WIDE ENOUGH AT THE TOES
2.0,Had to wrap necklace around pendant
2.0,"Cut and proportions of the dress seemed off; very high waisted, a lot of extra material in the skirt, no room in the chest area.  Pretty color brown though.  Wished it would have worked."
2.0,They are made of a brushed fabric so not good for winter time at all!
2.0,The color of the dress was more of a neon pink versus light pink. Just ok
2.0,"I needed this to wear a skeleton jumpsuit with all my girlfriends in New Orleans! Unfortunately, the product was way thin and I didn’t feel comfortable wearing it. It looked cool other than that!"
2.0,Doesn’t fit 3 gen right
2.0,"Poor quality, lens popped out and scratched really easy"
2.0,"I like them,I'm just not satisfied with the lightness of the glow tone in the dark."
2.0,nice design but very small and the fabric was not great.
2.0,"I think that the design is great! I wore them in my beard and my locs, unfortunately the beads tarnished within a day or two. I typically don’t mind if metal jewelry tarnishes but these beads turned white and green, and some of the material seems to be “flaking” off"
2.0,NOT USABLE VERY STRANGE FIT NOT FOR ME
2.0,"It's very, very large on my face, keeps sliding off. The frame isn't screwed together well, but what can you expect for the price. And the tint does next to nothing to block out the sun; I'm still squinting as I'm pushing the glasses up my nose to keep them on my face in an attempt to have it do its job. Only thing nice about it is the cute design, but there are other places on Amazon to buy heart-shaped sunglasses."
2.0,Thought I was ordering a pink shirt based on picture.  Got this not so pretty yellow.  Am returning.
2.0,Produce arrived with large hole and seams coming apart.
2.0,Way below expected and a very bad packaging by mudder .. I bought 3 all together and I found scratched on one of them.
2.0,"Love the shirt itself and colors are true to website. However, i normally wear med, but this is extremely tight!!"
2.0,[[VIDEOID:6f4524295e6d077c875d7a63b223e87f]] I’ve only worn this once and the stitching is already falling apart! Cute dress besides the stitching all coming undone
2.0,"Bought this for my wife. sweater is cute, bottoms are extremely awkward and uncomfortable for her - very large & thick waistband, lots of extra material, and the sweat pants are very long. She suggested it would likely look/fit better on a more curvy body."
2.0,Too short in the body of the briefs. Felt like I had perpetual&#34;plumbers crack&#34;. Not satisfied.
2.0,It was a little small for XL. It felt like a L.
2.0,There were several threads not cut properly. Very cheaply made.
2.0,The back becomes unattached quickly.
2.0,La tela  es muy delgada
2.0,Beaded up after first wash. Not worth the purchase. Not good quality.
2.0,"Slightly too large, and the fabric is weird to us. It is not like a dri-fit material."
2.0,Super cute for someone smaller. I’m 5ft5” & 175lbs with large chest. Made me look super fat & wide. Fit weird I’m the butt. I wanted to love this suit but oh well.
2.0,This item did not fit me well.
2.0,"I kept it only because it would be a hassle to retun it, but the material is very itchy, the fit is off, and though it does look like the picture for the most part, the definitely put a large size on someone small. I usually wear a smal ans ordered this in a large to get the over sized look and it was like ordering 1/2 a size bigger."
2.0,"Nice fit around the waist, but too short in the rear. If buying, plan on wearing shorts with it."
2.0,"Just know when you buy these that you will only get one season of use out of them. The construction wasn't that great and the felt separated from the rubber soles after only a few months. Eventually they ended up in the trash. I didn't think about taking pictures of them before I did it, but I would not buy these again, nor recommend to anyone I cared about. Only reason it's not one star is because they were very comfortable for the first few months."
2.0,Poorly made and you can't see writing as clearly as in picture.
2.0,I didn’t like it because the bottom of the jacket rode up. I wish it were longer.
2.0,Broke within month
2.0,"Looks very nice, hard to put on."
2.0,The dress was torn when it arrived.
2.0,"Ordered in wine red and the product came in gray/black. Was not as described/expected, but since I needed it for a gift that evening I couldn’t return and show empty handed."
2.0,Didn't wear
2.0,One of the fingers broke off on first wear. Cute but but not at all durable and very cheaply made
2.0,"What I received is nothing like the picture. It doesn't have the green and the straps are a leather brown. Very disappointed. I was going to use this on a cruise I was going on because it fit the beach theme, but it looks nothing like a pineapple in person."
2.0,Too thick when putting in my ear piercing. It really bothered my ears and I had to return. It’s a very cute set though
2.0,The straps  were not put on right.  Whoever  did the sewing didn't know what they  we're doing . And they straps are to long.  Thankfully it wasn't expensive. So I wouldn't waste my time shipping it back. Just throw it in the garbage
2.0,how the hell did i purchase a XL and it not fit me?! I wear a medium normal. Terrible
2.0,"I bought two of these the same size.  One purple, one pink.  This is the purple.  One fit a little loose and this one is too small.  I guess a QC problem?  So I’m not sure what to tell you except get it and see.  Other than that the quality is good and I like the material.  Got these to wear around the house after my operation."
2.0,"Looks nice but don't know what man can wear a bracelet that is only 2"" across.  So very tiny and no where is that described as being for a male toddler."
2.0,"This is what it is. The top is cheap so is a cheap material. The blue in this is shimmery/silky so definitely not a top to wear other than as loungewear/pjs. Also, I was surprised this ran bigger than I anticipated."
2.0,Nice made but only last 3 times and the league to support the glasses fell.<br />poor safety and too loose to hold glasses
2.0,"wouldnt have been a bad belt if it didnt crack and have the exterior material peeling and flaking off within a year of purchase.  looked good while it was still intact, but isnt worth buying again considering how long it lasts.  i bought a canvas military style belt instead for my next vegan belt....may not be as dressy but im sure it will last a lot longer"
2.0,"This dress does not look anything like the one pictured, but it is comfortable. I would probably never wear it out."
2.0,"Bought this for my grandmother. Wasn't to happy with it, looked different from the picture"
2.0,"Bought this for my niece. She wears a size 12...which based off of the chart a large. Played it safe and ordered an XL, which is a 14. Had my niece try on the jacket, nope it's small. The XL fits more like a 12. Returning jacket. Recomend sizing up one for your correct size."
2.0,"I bought the pink color.<br />At first, I like it very much, but I was sweating after the running, the pink color ran and my tank top became pink.<br />I am so sorry.<br />I try to wash it by hand many times but it still ran the pink color."
2.0,"I ordered an XL and based on the size measurements provided, it should have fit...but it fit more like a Medium instead. I suggest ordering up 1 or 2 sizes up."
2.0,Has bad smell. Is too small to be a loop scarf. Disappointed
2.0,Regular or too long and petite are too short. I'm sure they would be nice and comfortable but I am unable to answer him back
2.0,Material Hard.  Too small
2.0,True to size but awful material and made me feel very grumpy. Can’t even describe the material. Not quite t shirt?? Super cheap unfinished hems. Returning unfortunately.
2.0,This suit looks way cuter in the photo than it does in person. It's white on the inside and it was too small for my chest.
2.0,Did not come with the bow shown in the picture.
2.0,The fabric is not what is pictured. The neck is not V-neck it's scoop. It is not loose flitting and doesn't stretch at all.
2.0,"I'm a small person, usually between and xs and s. I ordered a small and it drowns me. The fit is awful and boxey. Fabric is super soft but somewhat see through. I love the pattern and style but it's just such an awkward fit."
2.0,"When I purchased it, I must've blacked out and not realized that I hadn't chosen the size, because when it arrived it was extra small. I don't wear anywhere near an extra small. So, if you want this item, it's extra small. Keep that in mind when you click &#34;purchase&#34;."
2.0,Nothing like picture... chipped and cracked and so small
2.0,"Cheep material,  did not fit properly"
2.0,"I’ll admit they look sick, but the product came in damaged around the toes, and also, do not buy these if you have big feet these at max size are extra small"
2.0,I wanted some jewelry to match a rose gold watch that I purchased.  This is barely pink.  Its not nearly as pretty and sparkly as the picture.
2.0,"Cardigan was beautiful, but EXTREMELY small.  I wear an XL for anything made and sold at Target or Macy's etc... but this was more like a Ladies M."
2.0,Love the glasses but one of the lenses was scratched.when I received them 😣
2.0,"These were too large even with a thick insert. In addition they threw my balence forward so that it was hard not to fall. Even with the platform they are really high but not more so than my others just not as easy to walk in. They're really beautiful but no padding for the ball of the foot, just standing in them hurt. Not at all what I expected. Disappointed."
2.0,"This jacket was the size for a 12 year old. It was supposed to be a 2X, but my 10 year old godson can fit.Very disappointed. The jacket is very lightweight and isn't appropriate for cold winters."
2.0,This dress was nice however the fit was a bit off on me. I found the top to be large. I have large breasts and still found the top portion of the dress to be to big. The dress came well over a week late. I tried to return it but the seller has ignored my request. over all I'm not happy. Buyer be warned....
2.0,Sizing ran small so had to return.
2.0,"Like the idea of it but it isn’t regular hoodie material. Size is WAY smaller than expected. If you wear XL, I would get the biggest one possible. The thin holes are jankie, one was big enough for my thumb & the other one was tiny."
2.0,I wear size large for everything. So I ordered the same size. It was too big for me.
2.0,"Cheap material, fits true size,  returned!"
2.0,Gloves are good but company is bad
2.0,"Waaaay too small, and I ordered 1 size larger than seller recommended."
2.0,I really wanted this to fit but it didn't fit. It was too large. I am 5'2 and weigh 95 pounds. I got the smallest size but I looked like I was swimming in it.
2.0,Cute to look at. Flimsy and poorly made.
2.0,Disappointed in the fixture connecting the pendant to the necklace. Came apart for my daughter on first wear and it was lost.
2.0,"Pretty disappointing. Small problems can easily be edited by your marketing. Descriptions VERY misleading. The bag does NOT charge your electronic devices. Only after, going back to scruitinize the photo (that can not be zoomed in on), I saw that the cord then plugs into a battery pack (not provided). Also the description box doesn't make grammatical or contextual sense...  next, there is one compartment for shoes OR dirty clothes, not compartments for shoes and dirty clothes.<br /><br />By the way did I mention that I just opened this bag and the cord doesn't even work.....<br />(Yes I have my own battery pack and it's charged and it works when I plug the phone directly to it.)<br /><br />Then I realize. What's the difference if I'm plugging my phone into my battery pack and whether or not the pack is in my bag thru and extra hole or thru the zipper....... or in my pocket like I normally do....."
2.0,Not a fan of the elastic waist..but it looks just like the picture.
2.0,It’s a good knock off. The C on the sides looks more like a G than anything. But it’s cute.
2.0,"I wear a size 9 shoe and these continually  slipp off  my feet. I'M  sure they would be okay for maybe up to size 8 , but NO larger 2!!"
2.0,"Umm… these aren’t cotton. No way.<br />I’m keeping them anyway, but be warned."
2.0,"This necklace is pretty but kind of looks cheap up close. And it is cheap, it broke the second time I wore it. I know you get what you pay for but I was hoping it would last a little longer."
2.0,The headband is not flexible.
2.0,"This is really small for XXL... not at all what I expected.  The same sized crew T-shirts by the same company fit comfortably, however."
2.0,I had to return the 2 packages because of size (kept the ones I'd worn).  Received notice that I would be credited for ONE PACKAGE.  What about<br />the other?  No more purchases until I get credit due me.
2.0,Size was too narrow had to return them.
2.0,"It was pretty while it lasted. Lasted just over a month before it stopped working. Sad because I got so many compliments on it. But, for the price, it's to be expected.<br /><br />Buy it for a trip and then don't expect it to last longer than that."
2.0,Had to give it away too big! Beautiful Color
2.0,Pretty disappointed....this is more like a hooded towel than a reaper costume! Not happy
2.0,They were nice until we went to put them on and the pins fell off both of them.
2.0,"I'm a pretty average size but I have thic thighs, and these tights were too tight"
2.0,TOO SMALL FOR ME TO WEAR
2.0,Don’t listen to reviews that say this runs small. I normally wear a small but ordered a medium due to other reviews. It is WAY to big. I could wear it as a sleep shirt. Order your regular size.
2.0,"Very cheap frames with the most basic plastic hinge (just a screw). The arms slick plastic on the arms allow them to slide around on your ears. If they get too close to your face, sweat and grease accumulate on the top of the lens. The mirrored lens looks cool but the purple to green color shift on mirrored lenses is also noticeable when looking through these glasses. Nice that it comes with a microfiber cleaning cloth as well as a bag as you're likely to need to both to keep them clean. Bulky (as I anticipated) but quality is lacking"
2.0,Jersey was nice when it arrived but after a few uses the numbers started to peel.. I tried my heat press to get it to stick again but didn’t last.  My son is sad.  Tough to find holland jersey that doesn’t say Virgil on it.
2.0,Fit was perfect. color was a dark blue just as the picture shows.The reason behind the 2 stars was that the  seams where the belt loops where stitched to the wast of the shorts had tiny holes. on the third time wearing them they ripped almost in half. the rip started right where the holes from the the belt loops stitching was all the way down to the bottom of the pocket that is on the leg.  its to bad because i really like the shorts.
2.0,"The watch itself I cannot comment about. But the watch band itself caused a rash which eventually was like a burn all the way around my wrist. The band also would come unattached easily. Customer service offered a refund with return of the watch, but the refund never came."
2.0,"This was a going to be for me, but not Long enough."
2.0,"Nice glasses, nice quality frame but glasses came all scratched."
2.0,Not happy with the quality of the picture. It's very squished to one side instead of using the whole space provided. The picture is a bit dark and blurry so it's kinda hard to make out some of the faces. Bought a different bag instead and will use this as a backup in case something happens to the other.
2.0,"Fit was off. It looked like a very shiny, satiny material in person. To the point that it looked very cheap in person. Maybe it just wasn’t flattering on me, but I looked like I took wrapping paper from the 80’s and covered my lower half sloppily. Wasn’t feeling it. But maybe you can rock it!"
2.0,Had to return due to poor craftsmanship. Straps were not placed correctly when sandals were made. Straps made foot slide to the inside of sandal which had me walking half on half off shoe
2.0,"I bought these for work in a lumber yard where we occasionally have to work in the rain. Unfortunately in being water tight, they also ventilate extremely poorly. So what you save in water getting through the gloves, just builds up in sweat. As a result they tend to smell REALLY bad, and it is a smell that is hard to wash away.<br /><br />Whatever chemicals they use to treat these gloves only seems to worsen the smell too, and washing the gloves damaged the waterproofing, so... it was unfortunately never a win for me.<br /><br />But, if you don’t wear these to sweat in, they should do the job if you can get past the factory smell. The treated parts are definitely water proofed well."
2.0,was sewed wrong
2.0,These don't really last well after a few wear and washes. They have shrunk and faded and have little to no stretch to them.  He won't be able to wear them for much longer.
2.0,The clutch is ROSE GOLD. Not gold. Very disappointed. And the chain doesn’t match because it is just gold not rose gold.
2.0,The magnet is too small for the shoe.  I will not use it as It-lets go of the material and the glasses fall.
2.0,I am an extra large and this slid on smooth for me. Buying another one! Very curvy 14.<br /><br />Wait... I broke out in hives around the upper edges of this dress after wearing it all day.
2.0,The model in the picture is obviously tiny because her sleeves look flowy.  The top that actually arrived does not have the same side ruffle detail as what is pictured.  Its a smaller cheaper looking ruffle with two large covered buttons that sortof look like the center of a flower or a bow.  The sleeves are just... weird.  And it's short in the waist.
2.0,Delivered fast but wrong size
2.0,"I ordered these socks because I needed no show socks that would stay on.  They do have a very small band of silicone in the back heel, but its pretty worthless.  I was fixing my socks all day long- the silicone didn't help much at all.  The fabric is also pretty thin and the quality of the socks isn't the best."
2.0,"The packaging wasn't very sturdy and while the necklace itself is cute, I won't be able to gift it after all.<br />The ""Fresh water pearls"" are acrylic beads and were peeling where the chain met the bead.<br />I'll be taking it apart, removing the fake beads and putting real fresh water pearls in their place and keeping it for myself.<br />Please do not misrepresent an item! It's disappointing and makes it hard to trust the actual seller.<br />Please change the description and put faux pearl in its place. Thank you!"
2.0,Don't buy this or the Unisex Melange (also called PREMIUM COTTON: NEUTRAL MULTI).  The nose clip is in the wrong spot and way too low.  The reversible (https://www.amazon.com/Kenneth-Cole-Reversible-Masks-Multicolored/dp/B08LLF8VMP) and the PREMIUM HEATHERED COTTON versions have the nose clip in the correct place at the top of the mask.
2.0,Made of crappy costume material. Not worth it.
2.0,This top looks cheap and runs small. I couldn't even bring myself to try it on - I wouldn't even have given it a second look if I had seen it in a store. Absolute no-go. I'm returning it.
2.0,"Arrived Tarnished.  It's cheap jewelry, and you get what you pay for..."
2.0,material poor quality
2.0,Loop that holds heart on chain is not good my heart fell Off I found it and replaced loop . Heart is a good size pretty accent necklace
2.0,"Material hermoso , pero no lo puedo usar, me queda como Polera, es extremadamente corto y eso que pedí una talla mas"
2.0,Material was very stiff and not flattering
2.0,Has a tie on the inside but the one on the outside isn't secure enough to keep it secured. Definitely need to wear clothes under it if you don't want to be reallllllyyyy exposed.
2.0,"It’s worth it, looks authentic however kinda fragile.. I would not wear everyday, may break...update: belt buckle had broken after the third wear. It’s a nice looking belt but not worth buying.. save your money"
2.0,Well the headphones stopped working after using them for 2 days. I do think the beanie is good quality and the headphones fit inside well. Maybe I just got a faulty set of headphones but I didn't love it enough to order a replacement.
2.0,"I wear a XL, this shirt fits great on the top however, if you have any size tummy, it's tight around the tummy."
2.0,Dislike material wrinkles all the time.
2.0,"I should have listened to the other reviewers about the difference in the color from the pictures to the actual fabric.  The dress fit fine, except for being too long ( which is not a manufacturing problem, I am just short"").  The fabric feels OK, but the colors in the dress are actually very subdued, not vibrant at all.  The dress turns out looking more brown than purple.  I have attached a photo of the actual dress next to the website image. Not what I was looking for.  Am going to return it."
2.0,"I got the light blue dress. I suppose I should have paid more attention to ALL of the pictures of available colors as it did not remotely resemble the actual cut of the other dresses.<br /><br />This fits more like a kimono. There is no flow or bounce.  The tie in the front is a separate sash. It came out extremely wrinkled and smelled heavily of plastic.<br /><br />The pattern of the fabric is spot on and very pretty, which is why I am giving this two stars instead of one."
2.0,"I purchased knowing these weren't the most expensive slippers out there, but after not even 2 months of wear they are falling apart already. I wear them daily, and there are holes tearing in the bottom and have stretched so they no longer stay on my feet. Disappointed"
2.0,"I was super excited to find this on Amazon, but was very dissapointed with it after receiving. It was just simply a lower quality than I was expecting."
2.0,"Looks great in pictures, put it on and the print looks stretched, I’m pretty thin so didn’t care for it or wear it for Halloween."
2.0,Ok so not the best buy I have ever bought. Fit as expected no issues there. Material is very shiny which is weird looking when wearing plus they snag easily. The padding for whatever reason didn't do a very good job. Bought a new bike rode with stock seat and I was sore after ride when my other pants I could ride and be fine on the stock seat so not sure what the difference was in these pants padding when it was very similar to  my other pairs.Love the look of the skirt to cover the padding :) Wouldn't recommend unless you like the shinier look and have a seat that is also padded.
2.0,To hard to open and close clasp
2.0,"The quality is OK, it looks thin on the arm. Also, it scratches easy, it got a few scratches already by wearing a day"
2.0,Cheap made in China
2.0,It shrunk after washing it the first time. It’s shorter and smaller. It’s great for a one time wear.
2.0,Bought in May and replaced in September. Good for a quick summer but not consecutive summers. Sticking with Keens
2.0,"Love the color, material is stiff for my liking.<br />Not enough stretch. I bought a XXL I like my shirts a bit bigger but this feels like a medium."
2.0,Very flexible but way too small!ordered a 4.5 and it's smaller than a size 3!?!fits without socks but um....I'm not doing that.
2.0,"I ordered the Size large (label size xl).  This should really be labeled as medium because it's rather snug.  After receiving them I wore each one time and found that after several hours they got uncomfortable due to chaffing and not having enough room in the front. If you're considering these, I would only recommend them if you normally wear medium or smaller."
2.0,Not.very nice
2.0,Almost impossible to install.
2.0,I simply don’t like the look on me nor the way they wash.
2.0,"Band was super cute, but the hinge broke the first time I put it on. Then I had a very difficult time getting it off."
2.0,Material is weird print instead of sewn into sock. Really tight on calf yet loose on foot somehow. Dogs are cute.
2.0,the watch is ok but battery is dead and the bracelet it came with don't even fit my wrist
2.0,"Since there is no size chart for these pants I read all the comments and ""Q&A""'s. They mostly agree that these pants come too small and to order 2 sizes larger than your normal pant size, this is not correct! I normally wear a small or medium so I ordered a medium and they were way too big. I've since returned them and ordered an XS instead, hopefully these will be a better fit!"
2.0,"It's much shinier than expected, kind of like satin. And ran small."
2.0,Great flip flop but had to get about 1 1/2 sizes bigger. My son is 9 Ave wears about a 5 with a little room in them with his sneakers and the Olukai flip flop size 5 was tiny on him.
2.0,The plastic seems like they will snap at any time.Very flimsy!
2.0,"I was so looking forward to getting this watch because I really liked the looks of it, but the BIG down side was you need some sort of tool to try and get the latch open, or else super stong finger nails! And then omce you do finally get it open, the side you are suppose to attach it to is really flimsy!"
2.0,"This item was somewhat of a disappointment. The picture looks really nice and it is priced very low. I expected the chain to be worthless but thought I could use this as an aromatherapy locket and place it on a higher quality chain. But I was wrong.<br /><br />Pendant looks much cheaper in person than in the picture. When it slides around on a chain it sounds clunky, like an aluminum can rattling around on your neck. Locket does not like to stay closed and will pop open with any movement. You get what you pay for, and this just wasn't worth it."
2.0,Very cute but it was more a kids size. Had to return.
2.0,"The white boots are not knee high, they come up to mid-calf at best.The description is incorrect, do not buy these if you need knee-high or over-the-knee boots."
2.0,The suspenders broke the second I clipped them on to his pants. The bow tie also fell apart but that was easy to put back together.
2.0,"I loved the belt, but when I recieved it I tried it on and it was way too small. If the band was bigger it would've been perfect. Beside that, the quality is decent."
2.0,Ordered two. And yet they couldn't give me two different ones. I think that's ridiculous and annoying. They're cute. Haven't used yet as it's for a gift. But not sure they're worth the cost. Especially considering I can't send her two of the freaking same
2.0,Loved the color.<br />Shape was nice.<br />Just sad the quality is so thin. I wear very skin hugging panties and they still show the line .<br />Will be returning .
2.0,The magnet came unglued in the first 5 minutes of wearing it.
2.0,"I received this coat and did not like it. The hood seems like it has stiff paper inside, and it has permanent folds and creases. I think I would have to stuff something in it to make it work. I found another Six coat on Amazon and it is SO much better. This one is also a weird green instead of yellow. I hate the hood and the color, basically."
2.0,It’s easily wrinkle and too thin to protect skin from the sun. Leave no room for sunglasses. But if you want something handy and lightweight it’s an okay product
2.0,This is not even close to water proof.
2.0,"You would think just the part that is considered over sized would be the lenses, but in fact, the entire frame is over sized. They do not snug my head, or behind my ears enough to where they will stay put. They slip right off my face. If you have a wide head, I suppose this may work for you."
2.0,"The quality of the fabric is terrible. It’s see through, very cheap."
2.0,I ordered this shoe for my daughters christening and it had such a foul smell that we couldnt use it at all. It was super cute so we decided to air it out and that worked wonders. Too bad she won't get to wear it since we dont go anywhere that would require a white shoes...
2.0,The top is not clear and I could not see.  The  2.5 magnification that I ordered is not that.
2.0,Wasn't a fan of the fabric and the way it felt. The fabric was thicker then I wanted. The seams were super thick.
2.0,"I know this is one size fits all, but it really is huge!"
2.0,Paint wore off after one wearing.  Gauge size was true tho.
2.0,"It was ok it was just the top was too small for the bust, but the back was too big, the metal piece I had no idea how to put it on, and the bottoms were slightly big"
2.0,Much too large for a normal sized face
2.0,"The skirt is essentially as described, however the pictures are a bit misleading. The photos show the lace layers lying nicely. The one I received, the layers are a little too short to lie flat. They kind of puff out a little more than I would like, making a different look than I want. The lace and waistband are soft and comfortable, though.<br />Also, of note, there were a few holes where the skirt is attached to the elastic waistband when I received it. Seems like a quality control issue (poor sewing).<br />Overall, I'll probably wear the skirt at some point. It's just not as cute as I think it should/could be if the laces would lay in flat layers."
2.0,Nose pad fell off after a couple days.
2.0,The sleeves are a bit small. The part where you insert your thumbs in are super small. The material isn't that great.
2.0,"Definitely not for the well endowed, the boobie part sits way up on your chest and the shoulder ruffles stick strait up. The floral print on cream fabric feels like umbrella material and has no give. Plus it’s see through"
2.0,I could barely leave it on cause it had a horrible smell of plastic chemical.
2.0,"These look cheap.  I love Lily & Laura bracelets and I was hoping to mix these in with my collection, but nope!  The quality doesn't blend. The colors were ... meh ... there were maybe 5 that I thought were cute."
2.0,My ears became inflamed and the center of one of the earrings came out
2.0,"Fabric head  great stretch and I love the color, but the zipper broke within the first few minutes  that I had it on. I'm just thankful that I hadn't left the house yet."
2.0,Pros: material feels very nice. Looks pretty sharp.<br /><br />Cons: elastic band rolls over on itself. After 2 washes there was a hole where the waist band meets the material.
2.0,"I LOVE this shirt - honestly, the material is comfy, the fit is loose, and the color is a bright plaid. What's not to love?<br /><br />I've bought this shirt TWICE. The first time, I wore it a couple of times and it ripped at the bottom panel. I took the risk of buying another one and the FIRST day I wore it, it ripped in the top panel (as in the top panel was disconnecting from the rest of the shirt). I love this shirt so I just tried to sew it back up. I wore it a couple of time and then when I went to wear it for the third time, it was ripping in another spot.<br /><br />Very, very poor quality. Breaks my heart."
2.0,The fake pears are toooooo fake. They're crushed in and changes color the first day I wore it.
2.0,It's cute but it's not enough to make 2 necklaces that wont choke you.
2.0,The pendant was much to large for my taste. It had a cheap looking appearance.
2.0,Beads are too much (big) and it's poorly made.
2.0,"When I got the necklace, it was chipped on one of the gems.  I still love it, but it is a bummer!"
2.0,"After about a month of wear, the two leather strips (held together by glue) has started to peel apart."
2.0,Based on reviews I ordered a size up... and they were way too large.  I returned them as they were also poor quality for the price
2.0,Had to have them sewed bc love the quality. A they were so comfortable so I ordered another set bc these were not stitch well around the neck and came apart when I washed them. They were adorable a gift so had to order another pair. Hopefully it is sewed well. Refund please.
2.0,"Basically all of them were impractical, too heavy, too cheap, or didn't even work. One had the cuff and earring part on the wrong ends. How?? Only one that looks cute was the dangly black one that hooks behind your ear."
2.0,"I received these sandals on February 24, 2020, and use them for indoor slippers in the morning and evening. After just two months, the soles or bottoms of the sandal started separating from the sandal itself and making a flopping sound when walking around the house. This also causing a safety issue with tripping against carpets etc.  I really do like the metatarsal footbed and the overall design, but the soles need a better glue.  sincerely, Dr. Bonnici"
2.0,I like the design but I don't like the fact that the shirt is an inked on design. After wearing it and washing it just once the inked on art started crumbling and cracking. Now it kinda looks like a shirt with a fading away design. That's not cool! If you could have made it with the full sewn on/rubber on/protective design I can wear it for longer. But now I'm afraid to wear it for fear I will loose the design and have to buy my own factory made more costly version.
2.0,IT BROKE ON THE FIRST NIGHT in two places. It's weird because I remember the first time I ordered from this seller it was a better product and lasted and lasted until I lost it.
2.0,pocket seams all blew out after a single wear. great short until the point they fell apart.
2.0,"The band around top edge hurts and the shoe is much to flat for my feet.  Much to my regret, had to give away. They were pretty however."
2.0,"Runs small, otherwise it’s a beautiful shirt"
2.0,These run quite small and once washed are worse. I am a size 9 so if your feet are smaller you would be ok.
2.0,So so fit and material but it was cheap to begin with
2.0,It's not bad but the silicone still makes your arm sweaty even though it's mostly holes. Fits the watch well though
2.0,I have a small wrist. Still it is too small. Too expensive.
2.0,Cute but NOT true to size. 0g usually is a right fit on me but these are falling out. :(
2.0,"Worth what I paid for it...around $12.  Very thin and flimsy.  I would recommend the Jonathan Paul Fitsover brand instead...I've had a pair of them for over a year and they've suffered some abuse, but no damage whatsoever.  Much thicker and sturdier and while considerably more expensive they're what I'll be purchasing in the future as well."
2.0,Nice quality work cutting out and stitching the pieces but there was nothing to keep it tight to your nose.  Your breath just blasts into your eyes.  If you use your fingers to close the gap it is very hard to breath through.
2.0,I had to take this and the other dress to my dress maker to alter for me. The material i dont like too much and in addition they are too short
2.0,Don't fit that great on me... You may have better luck. Hard to complain when they aren't a big name brand...
2.0,Beautiful dress. Ordered 1 size up as directed. 2-3 sizes too small. Attempted to return. Received shipping label to China. Postage was $150.00. Dress was $127.00. Will be selling it.
2.0,"the construction and material of this top is really low quality, but I guess you get what you pay for.  I would not recommend it"
2.0,"The had itself was fairly nice.  Downsides are it's really small, definitely made more for women or children.  Also returns cost $7 which I couldn't find when buying it.  But with caution, make sure you have a small head and definitely would never want to return."
2.0,Cheap looking in my opinion.
2.0,Not only did the shipping take three weeks longer then expected. THE WATCH DOES NOT WORK.
2.0,Toon big for my 8-year old daughter's ears.
2.0,Not a good quality.
2.0,"Pins break pretty fast - inexpensive, but you get what you pay for."
2.0,Product is somehow okay but packaging was very rough.
2.0,Runs big and material was thick and stiff p
2.0,"Way too tight. Looked cheap. I saw the 'too tight' reviews prior to purchasing as well, thinking I could wear the ring on a different finger or that I could deal with the bracelet being a bit tight - but after it arrived, I realized something: I don't think it's wise to risk losing a hand or a finger because I've chosen to reduce blood-flow so drastically just for the sake of just having gotten a good deal on some sparkly club jewelry. Recommended only for the types of girls and boys that I envy - the tiny ones."
2.0,"This is a pretty dress, and the fabric feels nice for the price point. However, its waist seam came apart completely when washing it before the first wear (in a delicate bag on a cold “soak only” cycle and hung to dry). Also, the snaps that are meant to hold the bust together were sewn on backwards on the one I received. Since I can simply stitch up the split seam and remove the faulty snaps myself, it will work fine for the one-day event I wanted to wear it for, but I don’t expect it will hold up past that."
2.0,You need to inquire about the size of this bracelet before you buy. It's super small and would likely only ever really fit a small child.
2.0,"Poor quality, not a rebuy"
2.0,Not as detailed as the sew on badges from AFEES.
2.0,too tight and bulky under shirt. was looking for something more discreet.
2.0,"The print is cheap, not like the print on other dress in the same series."
2.0,"I read a lot of reviews that stated they arrived broken however, there was many others that stated they were perfect and had no issues. I took the chance and ordered them the earrings are stunning but they did arrive broken. Seems like an easy fix but still makes me worry that they might fall apart on the big day."
2.0,I bought this specifically looking for a turquoise ring. It was dark blue (nearly navy blue). Very disappointed.
2.0,I expected nothing less from something that came five months late from china it is pretty to the eye but very cheap and not worth it
2.0,"It is impossible to put this garment on without help. If you have help; use what you already have save your money. $100 a shirt...HA!  I purchased in anticipation of shoulder surgery. Practiced with the shirts, realized they were over-priced and under-delivered. Returned them within 24 hours. Delivery of order was prompt and returns were easy."
2.0,"Seams were very noticeable. Wrinkles easily, especially in the back along the zipper. Nice thick fabric but the wrinkles and bunching (even though it was a little bit on me) were just too much. Returned."
2.0,"Right out of the package the silver ones were hard to put on.  Then I realized there was some metal flash left on the inside of the earrings and I had to remove it with a Exacto knife.  They were still difficult to put on but at least they wouldn’t cut my ear this time.  I did eventually get them on my ear but not completely, I tried bending them a bit but they won’t budge.  So I left them on part way and they felt secure.  However after wearing them for a while one popped off.  I then tried putting them in a different position on my ear but they were too big.  I gave them 1 star because I did get all three pairs, and one star because I did eventually get them on for a short time, but that’s being very generous.  They didn’t come with directions and I don’t know why they are described as magnetic.  They are one solid piece and from what I can tell they don’t have a magnet attached?  Still not too impressed with the fit or having to remove the flash so it didn’t cut my ear."
2.0,"I suppose it's fine, but damn if it doesn't pull out allll the arm hairs."
2.0,I was disappointed to find these aren't anymore comfortable than a cheap pair that costs half the price.
2.0,"Gave up and bought an old fashioned Time. Hard to see in the dark, wouldn't sync, difficult to change the time (had to change manually because it wouldn't sync)."
2.0,Definitely much cuter in the picture...everything is so small and you really can't see the bling at all.<br />Extremely overpriced.
2.0,"Beautiful necklace.  The pendant is nicely made.  It appears to be great quality but where the downfall is - the necklace.  The necklace part made my neck green after 5 days of wearing it.  Very, very disappointed!!"
2.0,"Quality of fabric it nice, but My orders were M and XL , they send my XXL both .<br /><br />Dont wast you money !"
2.0,"While I love the color of these glasses, they really do nothing to block the sun, and they make everything a bit blurry - and yes, the lenses are clean!"
2.0,This sweater was very small.  Tagged as XXlarge is fits like a large only  Very disappointed.
2.0,The colors aren’t as vibrant as the picture and aren’t loose fitting. They aren’t stretchy at all and the material is kind weird.
2.0,It fits and stretchy
2.0,Ordered this for a work event and got a L but it was way too tight and unflattering!
2.0,"The had an excellent fit, however, shortly after I started using the mask a crack formed down the face of the mask."
2.0,My item came cracked and it was for my son's birthday I don't think it was shipped that way I guess I have to buy it again
2.0,"Sunglasses are of poor quality,  while wiping them down just out of the box a lens popped out.  I was able to get it back in.  Will have to be very careful when taking them on and off. Disappointed even at this price."
2.0,Way to big at the to.
2.0,"[[ASIN:B01LSL2KWK Dokotoo Womens Cold Shoulder Loose Knitted Sweater Top Blouse Small White]]<br />The small was definitely too big.  It was loose knitted sweater but TO ME, it looked and felt kind of 'cheap' stuff.  The girl in the photo looks great it whereas, I did not.  Sending back and not trying again."
2.0,"I'm actually not sure how it fits (had to click an option to write review) .. i didn't need to open the package to see the color<br />ITS BROWN NOT YELLOW. I'm not too picky about my yellow.. light yellow, golden yellow, tan yellow, camel yellow ok... but this is literally brown. i have to wear for uniform so needs to be at least close to yellow ... returning.<br /> but its too bad because the fabric looks nice, well made and i like the buttons... wish it came in yellow......"
2.0,"I ordered one of these for my daughter a few months ago. It was very nice, longer sleeves that could be cuffed and nice weight etc. I liked it so much I ordered one in another color. It’s much lighter weight and the sleeves are shorter. Not nearly the quality. Inconsistent."
2.0,Shoes were a bit loose fitting especially on my right foot (the slightly shorter one - we all have one) Pretty loose there. Probably will end up not wearing them.
2.0,"This “dress” is very sheer and thin. It’s more like a swimsuit coverup. Not the best material. It is cute, but not worth $30"
2.0,"Could not have been more disappointed in this product. While it is a 'one size fits all' I didn't realize how big the size would be (which is absolutely gigantic on my medium-sized frame), but that's not the chief problem. The material is nice to the touch, comfortable. However, within the second time I wore it? It was ripping. The seams and material are too cheap to stand up to basic wearing of the garment as sleepwear. Totally disappointed. Only gave the second star as previous to it giving out, it is a nice enough night gown. However, don't waste your money."
2.0,"They are cute earrings, but the post is glued by hand onto the back. Not a big deal, except on the pair I received one of the posts is glued all the way to the side, while the other one is centered properly. I would return them, but I need them for a birthday gift tomorrow. I guess I'll have to break it off and re-glue it myself. Hopefully it works."
2.0,Had to return. Products material was not as expected
2.0,Cheap material for the price and the picture is fuzzy.
2.0,"This is a very thin fabric.  Cute hoodie, but not soft and the fabric is transparent.  I would not recommend."
2.0,The color is much lighter than pictured. The two layers of chiffon on the dress were still too thin that I would need a slip as it is see through. And the sizes run large apparently so the fit was not complementing on me. Will be returning for a refund.
2.0,I can't recommend these. The cabochons don't fit well and settings are not very deep. I have seen very inexpensive settings look pretty good and have weight; these don't on either count. They don't fill the bill for me.
2.0,I'm not so happy to this product because it faded so fast for only one time use. I kind of regret buying this.
2.0,Nice looking boot but made of cheap material. Fell apart in 2 weeks
2.0,The material is kind of scratchy and the arm length was very short
2.0,these might fit a 4 year old or some one with very skinny fingers....
2.0,Way too small! Fit like a small and I bought a large
2.0,to big for me and i have big hips
2.0,"To the trained eye you can see the pair I received have a rough, textured spot, the color can even be seen coming off. Between the two they feel cheap, but that was expected. I was looking for some colorful earrings to play with, that didn't break the bank...sadly I fear wearing them the color might wear off onto my ears."
2.0,I love the pattern but I ordered according to the size chart (and reviews) and it didn't even come close to fitting. I could not get the shirt over my chest. Since there is no give in the material at all I would recommend sizing up 1-2 sizes.
2.0,We returned the product as it didn’t fit well on my toddler. It was also too short to cover enough of the high chair table. The material is uncomfortable.
2.0,Poorly made and it fits behind your neck not on top of your head. Going to Iceland so wanted something that would keep my ears warm. We'll see how warm it keeps me!
2.0,"The outer surface is chipping off, revealing something synthetic underneath. This may be what is called split leather. I've never see leather wear like this before. Also had a lot of synthetic in the lining, making it less comfortable in the medium temperature late fall of Seattle."
2.0,"The print of this swimsuit is absolutely stunning. The cut, however, leaves much to be desired. While I don't have an exceptionally long torso, the part that you'd want to sit under the breasts was so low it was mid-way across my stomach. While that doesn't affect the deep-V style it looked absolutely foolish. The suit fit through the butt and everywhere else so I don't think sizing up would have done anything more than make it extra baggy and look worse. Pretty disappointed. I had ordered more than one color during a sale because I liked the style so much, but they all were sent back."
2.0,For the price and being everyday watch it’s fine but a little smaller than pictured
2.0,I BOUGHT THESE AS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT FOR A FRIEND WHO ALWAYS WEARS SUSPENDERS. HOWEVER THEY WERE TOO BIG. YOU CAN ADJUST THEM AS BIT IN THE BACK ABOUT 2 INCHES BUT THEY KEPT FALLING OFF HIS SHOULDERS. ARE THESE RETURNABLE?
2.0,It could have been just a little bit bigger they are cute but smaller then I expected
2.0,Very dull and thin. Cheaply made.<br />Spend more $ on a nicer gift for you son.
2.0,Zipper easily broken.
2.0,This costume is very cheaply made. The earrings broke immediately before trying on.
2.0,Thought they were way too big to be for a kids face.
2.0,I am attaching a photo. The quality of these pants are unacceptable.
2.0,The bottom of this suit was quite odd. The front was too long and bunchy and the back was riding up horribly. This was unwearable for me. I returned it. They gave me a prompt refund.
2.0,I bought this purse and matching coin bag for my wife as a Christmas present. We have a Scottie and my wife adores him so I thought this would be a perfect gift.  I was right. She loved the bags. The design and looks “absolutely beautiful”. (Her words). After a few days of use she realized the the zipper for the bag is poorly designed. Opening the zipper all the way causes to it to invert itself making it almost impossible to close. The zipper issue kills the rating for the purse.
2.0,"The earring broke after the first night wearing them. And all i did was go out to dinner. Disappointed, but they was very pretty, and arrive on time."
2.0,Cheap material especially the gold lettering.
2.0,This dress is a bit heavy and although is black and white it almost seems gray . The straps do not provide enough support for the heaviness of the dress. I wish i would've  gone a size or two down but then at the slightest stretch the dress looks gray and  cheap.
2.0,The material used for this shirt resembles costume material / polyester and is extremely thin. Poorly made and poor fit. I guess you get what you pay for!
2.0,Ordered a sz 3t and the shirt fits as expected but the shorts are about 3 sizes too big. My 8yo daughter could probably fit in them. They're still cute nonetheless so I will keep them til he's big enough for them. Just a little disappointing that he can't wear the whole outfit. I read a review that had the same issue so I won't bother buying from the seller again. Side note- the fabric is all good quality.
2.0,Odd fit.  Awkward looking.  Returned.
2.0,Shortened post trying to get the back off.  Need instructions next time
2.0,Low in quality and not at all what the pictures look like. Not worth buying
2.0,"I was really looking forward to these shorts to take on vacation...unfortunately these shorts felt like they are made to fit ""bbl/waist trainer"" bodies. I had to return these as I couldn't get them up my waist. These run extremely small with little to no stretch."
2.0,"Looked so fake, I did not even used it."
2.0,Wasn't like the picture. Not the material/look/feel that I expected. Wish it was would have been great.
2.0,"The leather is top quality.  The design is intuitive and easy to apply to boot/shoe.  However, it constantly slips over the shifter no matter how tight it is secured to the boot thus negating its protective purpose."
2.0,"You get what you pay for!  I bought these for my 11 yr old son for baseball.  He only wears them during games and they have already broken after 2 months.  Trust me, this is not due to his aggressive play!"
2.0,much bigger than I thought I am looking for a rapper to give it to
2.0,The pendant looks wonderful but it broke and fell off the chain after being worn once.
2.0,These shorts were super cute but are too small. Especially the black line that goes along the bottom. It is too tight and doesn’t stretch at all.
2.0,"I was looking for nice tank tops to work out in. These are a little too expensive for what it offers. First, there is absolutely no compression at all. They are form fitting but if you have a little bit of love handles like me, every curve will show -_- The fabric is soft so it's ok to sleep in. They're not worth it. I only kept them for sleeping but wouldn't buy again."
2.0,way darker then I thought they would be.  I was looking g for a yellow shooter type lens.
2.0,they do not stay in place at all when trying to use them for the intended purpose but great for just wearing around the house.
2.0,I found these nice to look at. Once on Not very comfortable.  Plastic material feels cheap. But you get what you pay for...
2.0,The fabric is coming with imperfection . The model  fit very good . I like it .
2.0,"Poor quality, very small, broke a clasp, i don't like"
2.0,Runs small and the length is too short.
2.0,"The description lists &#34;womens mens kids&#34;- and that would be false!  I have child-sized wrists, so I always have to purchase watches in the kids department.  While it can sort-of be adjusted to fit my wrists, though uncomfortably, my main complaint is that the width of the watch face itself is HUGE- more for a man-sized wrist than womens, and certainly not kids!  I ordered them as cheap watches to wear to work since I have a grimey job and ruin watches fairly regularly, but even with the band tightened enough, the face goes so far beyond my wrist that it was awkward, uncomfortable, and looked ridiculous!  Just be aware..."
2.0,My husband said so cheap looking he wouldn't wear it.
2.0,This material is not moisture wicking. It collects and holds onto all of your sweat.
2.0,Fits pretty awkwardly
2.0,"Out of 40 lights, 26 did NOT work! Disappointing!"
2.0,"Came pretty fast, fits nice and feels amazing but the zipper doesnt work."
2.0,Chest area was very big while waist area fit perfect. Had a funny smell to the dress when it arrived.
2.0,"Very cheap material, so thin you can see right through the canopy.<br />The operating mechanism is very choppy.<br />I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,"I ordered the a size large in the red, black, green, and blue pattern for my wife who is 5”10”.<br />-Pros: pants are comfortable and the fabric is decent and soft.<br />-Cons: pants were only black and red, no other colors like the description suggests. Pants were maybe 1-2 inches too short. My wife will only be wearing them around the house as pajamas."
2.0,The dress is nice if it actually showed the real deal in the photo.... it looks nothing like the pic. The sleeves are not tapered to your arm. It's a false wrap dress. And I'm he fabric is kinda weird. I wear it cause it's cute. But nothing like what the photo is
2.0,"Based on reviews saying this was more of a tunic, I ordered this bigger than my daughter’s size. Well the length was perfect but the width was way too wide so I’m returning this."
2.0,The watch itself is great. It was exactly what I was looking for but the band is horrible. Maybe I received a defective one but the pins that attach the clasp to the band popped out literally out of the box. I glued it back in and the next day another pin popped out. I may keep the watch if I can find an decent band to fit it otherwise it’s going into the trash.
2.0,The size was fine on mine. But I was amazed at the terrible stitching. The material is really thin and feels like it will tip before to long. I wasn't happy with the quality.
2.0,"As soon as I took this out of the package, I knew it wasn’t going to be good. The material is so rough and not comfortable at all. Also the stitching was already coming way loose around the area of the twisted knot. I returned it."
2.0,"Felt really baggy. Something you might wear lounging around your college dorm room. Definitely not a stylish top for going out or for work. The sleeves look like they'll balloon nicely from the photos, but in reality the hang drapey in a way that just looks like the shirt is too large rather than showing off the trendy bell shape."
2.0,"I’ve never had a reaction to earrrings in my 25 years of having pierced ears, but with these I did. I am not qualified to say whether it is the quality of the product. What I know is that they reacted poorly to my ears.<br /><br />The design is nice."
2.0,"Love the soft fabric and pink color, but right out of the bag the zipper was separating from the scarf, so I'm returning. I'd rather pay more for something nicer."
2.0,Much smaller than I expected & a poorer material than I would have liked. Return was simple and easy though!
2.0,"These were supposed to be XXL oversized sunglasses and they're not even close. As soon as I took them out of the package I could tell they were too small and would not fit properly. If you require extra large sunglasses like I do, don't waste your time on these."
2.0,Doesn't stay over the ears.  Cheaply made.
2.0,They are very pretty but extremely small. They are for little girls because they are to small for adults.
2.0,"they look like the quality you'd expect, not great, but ok.  Post bent after a few wearing. bummed they are made in china, given the ""italian"" name. Would not recommend"
2.0,It made me look huge. Material is very slinky and thin. Would look great on someone who is very tall and skinny but that's about it. Made and shipped from China so I didn't bother paying to return it
2.0,It is shorter than I expected and runs small.
2.0,"With the lens installed properly, the frame loses its original fit. If the glasses were too tight on your face to begin with you are probably fine.  Materials seem high quality so 2 stars but returning product."
2.0,Orderd a 2x it came innandnthe size said 5x  but fits true to an xl the print color wasnt the same as pictured came more of a midnight blue then the black thats pictured. Fear drying this due to the shrinkage thats bound to happen
2.0,I feel SO organized while traveling now. Except i have used them for 2 trips and the largest one is already coming apart. Love the idea but need better quality.
2.0,"Not sure if its the make or what. I ordered a 4XL and this thing is like a large..... I ordered a whole size up and its like 3x smaller. Its super short too, cant be tucked in at all"
2.0,"Unfortunately, I had to return this because it was extremely short. In the picture it appears to be tucked, but I ordered a medium and there was no way it was long enough to tuck. It *barely* came to the top of my high rise pants."
2.0,Way too tight for size ordered.  Not comfortable for all day wear.
2.0,Didn't like the material so I returned it.  I was looking for something that was softer/flowing.
2.0,it would be much better if it was cheaper. Is comfortable to wear but takes a little effort to get the right fit.
2.0,"We love harem pants over here. My daughter and I wear them all the time, so we have a good basis for comparison. And these - well, they didn't make the cut for a good pair of harem pants.<br /><br />They are long enough, which is good. The legs aren't tight, which is also good. The waist, however, is ridiculously tight. My daughter is tiny - only 125 pounds and these were even tight on her. And there really isn't any way to fix that.<br /><br />Also, I ordered brown and was sent black, so there's that."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress. It's a gorgeous color, the only one on this listing without a black top. But the fabric on the lower part is stiff and super wrinkly! The side zipper is probably necessary, since the lower fabric doesn't have any stretch, but it doesn’t lay flat, instead buckling up in the illusion of fat rolls, and the top edge of the pockets don't lay flat either. I was constantly tugging the dress down, trying to smooth the shape. The stiff fabric doesn’t drape well, and holds its shape out so that I felt like I was wearing a hoop skirt. The pockets, at least, were quite deep, so your phone isn't going to fall out when you sit down. The top part is quite comfortable, though the sleeve straps might be too long; the top of my bra was showing when the top stretched too much."
2.0,"I have bought several pairs of these leggings without problems, until the last pair I ordered. Although the tag states they are the same size the black pair are significantly smaller than the other 2 colors I bought (grey and rose)."
2.0,"The colors are very pretty and vibrant, but the fit is weird. It looks like a maternity top. It gets wide towards the bottom. I kept it, just because returning it  would have been difficult and they did give me a partial refund. I’ll try and make it work or it will hang in my closet for 2 years."
2.0,Ad states relaxed fit but when they arrived the tag said slim fit.  Didn't fit my daughter sent back.
2.0,"The ring looked great when I recieved it. Within less than a week, it was scratched and ruined!! Not very happy with my purchase."
2.0,"These jeans don't do anything for me. Not flattering at all. Rather looking flat and annoying. Also i think they are overpriced. The material is thick, so not for the carolina climates.Im 5'7, 135 lb, got the medium. Sizing is ok, but then again, they have so much stretch on them that unless your body is super small and super tight, they will not give you a pretty look. Returning them!"
2.0,Way XXL when I would normally wear an XL.  This suit I would need 4XL.
2.0,On the first wear in class the bottom no-grip decoration began to come off leaving a mess on my floor and my having to pull them off to go barefoot because pieces were hanging off. I typically buy ToeSox and after this experience I think i will stay with them. I actually gave the 2nd pair away! Very disappointed!
2.0,changed color on the second time worn
2.0,"These pjs are super cute and fit really well, but the printing on my top is upside-down, at the bottom of the shirt, and off-centered??? Hoping to get a refund."
2.0,Not the standard cartlidge size.
2.0,Too large so I sent back.  No exchange requested.
2.0,"I am not happy with this at all. The dress is stunning but it is a highlow- which is not what u paid for at all. I wanted a straight bottom dress that is a short cocktail dress, but I suppose I’ll just hav to return it and take my business elsewhere. Other than that it is a beautiful dress and fits perfectly"
2.0,The color and quality is different than what's shown in the picture
2.0,Great bathing suit for color and style but fit no bueno! I but I order an XL usually an 8-10 and my tiny cousin whom is a 4-6 still struggled to be comfortable in it!
2.0,Not durable at all.  I give two stars for the size.  I purchased as a 5th graders school backpack so I expected it to last at least the remainder of the school year (4 months). Didn't see venue last one month...
2.0,Too thin. Too elastic. Hard to believe they are made with that much cotton.
2.0,Pocket for filter is just a sleeve so filter does not stay in. Also the pattern is upside if you have the filter over your nose and mouth. Very cute though my 4 yo loves it
2.0,"It looked like the picture, but it was very weird looking. The bottoms looked a little bit like boy shorts but they also weren't long enough to be boy shorts. Weird fit."
2.0,"I ended up returning because even the size ‘S’ was HUGE. For size reference, I’m 5’3, 115 lbs. I did not like the fit and the pants honestly just looked awkward because they were so big. The fabric felt great though.. just wish they offered a size that would fit. Gave 2 stars based on the great stretch and feel of the material. Would recommend, if you can find a size that fits appropriately"
2.0,I wear size 8 1/2 so I went with a size 9. Many of the reviews said the shoes run large but mine were actually small. I will say I have wider feet than most so I thought going up a size would help but the shoe was too tight and not roomy. The quality of the shoe was very cute and was quite sturdy looking and feeling. Very sad they don't fit and I have to return them.
2.0,"The item arrivied quickly in a matter of four or five days. The quality of the cloth is suspect in that it appears stale and does not perform as I had hoped it would. I am still using a liquid product, BRASSO, and then polishing with the cloth. End cost of the cloth was $10.00 with shipping. A can of BRASSO is a buck and a half and old T shirts cost zero. Perhaps the cloths have out-lived their shelf lives."
2.0,"My daughter wears 18 month in all of her clothes and that is what ordered, but it was too big.  The 12 month would've been much better"
2.0,"These are really stiff stickers, so they do not contour on your baby's belly so they essentially don't stick and just look like they are a piece of card stock sitting on his/her belly.  The return policy was short so now i'm stuck with them too....really disappointing"
2.0,"make sure they send items and sizes for you. Mine was large, but large for Asians. It was medium for me in the US.<br />Did not fit and I ordered ""Large."""
2.0,"Much too big and I ordered a small.  Also, it came 7 weeks after I ordered it.  It arrived on the day the return period window closed, so no returning it. Cute enough, if it fit."
2.0,"Really cute, but the Velcro came unglued from the crown after having it together for a few minutes. Very disappointed as we didn’t even get to use it yet. I was just trying it on my daughter’s head."
2.0,it'scute. but really hard to get on by myself.  i wouldn't recommend this
2.0,"The top fits weird. Top is definitely for cup size A and B. Bottom runs small. Overall, this appears to be for someone with smaller hips and low cup size."
2.0,Idk if it’s just me but the pink ones look purple.
2.0,"The dress is fine, just not for me. I don't love the fabric, and the skirt is too full and too long to be flattering on my body type. I did like that the neckline was not too low-- the fit on the top was overall very nice. I just need something a little shorter and little less full."
2.0,"This product could have easily been a 5 star review if I had receive two 14 tapers but instead I received one 14 taper and three 12 tapers. I am glad I noticed before I put it in my ear. I'll hang out to them simply because I don't want to deal with the hassle and I can still get the job done. That being said, I'd probably use tapers from another seller if I was to buy again."
2.0,It's not one size fits all. It slips off at night while sleeping. And the snap button broke after day one.
2.0,"These lasted less than four month before the outer casing came loose from the inner cord, so I really can't recommend them."
2.0,Bought this as a gift for my 12 year old. Size med. The shirt looked like it had glitter on the Wallen but when we got it it didn't. I guess it's made to look like glitter by the white and teal spots. But not actual glitter.
2.0,cheesy
2.0,"I didn't expect thin, nylon bands with zero absorption. These are appropriate for hairstyling, no more."
2.0,"I didn't like that it rolled up. I wear a large, so i thought it was the correct size.<br /> I'm a Senior citizen and i was getting to help with my posture, trying to keep my shoulders back, and not bending."
2.0,These arrived and were so tiny I gave them to a little girl next door about 7 years old.
2.0,Bought it for a friend and it fit NO WHERE NEAR the size it should
2.0,The product was mostly good. Except for the flimsy belt that broke and the end of the sleeves didn’t come out to a point and sat werid on my hands.
2.0,I can't find light/medium weight vests for transition seasons!
2.0,"the bottoms fit fine, but the top didn't fit well, and as you can see in the photos there is a weird seam in the front where the patterns don't line up. i returned it."
2.0,Material very hard and cheap.
2.0,Super small. Returned and bought one of amazing quality and fit at American Eagle.
2.0,"I've only had the dress less than 4 months, but the straps in the back aren't really centered and go more outwards so the straps fall a lot! I packed this for a Vegas brunch outfit and the STRAP RIPPED MY WHOLE TITTY FELL OUT MY LEFT SIDE!!!!! Luckily we were only in the elevator and I had an extra outfit in the room. My big titty girls I would say it's a no! But for smaller chest it would be great for you!!!! I got an XL (usually US 12/14) & I wear a DDD in bra size for reference."
2.0,I paid for express shipping it still took almost 4 weeks to get here.... said from seller it runs small order a size up I did it’s ridiculously huge.... way to larger much larger than a size up. And the material is not worth the price
2.0,Is this 3 pair sold together. Because i only received pink pair. Misleading
2.0,It was a thin T-shirt material.not at all what I thought.
2.0,Very Sheer and very small.  I normally wear a XL  because I like shirts to fit a little big.  I ordered a XXL and my boobs are totally smushed. Too bad because it would have been a cute shirt.
2.0,I purchased white & it was COMPLETLEY see through! Returned immediately.
2.0,"Product description states bamboo case which was not provided. Glasses came slightly bent and felt weird on my face, but after adjustment they felt fine.<br /><br />They are polarized as stated."
2.0,Very small hard to read writing. Not worth buying
2.0,"I wanted this dress so badly.. It arrived and the quality looked good BUT THE SIZE is completely off!<br /><br />I ordered a size S and it is ENORMOUS! Since there is no size XS available, I can't even order another one :-(<br /><br />(I am 5'1 and 125 lbs (156cm/57kg))"
2.0,Glasses looked very nice! But unfortunately they broke the second day I had them!
2.0,Skirt way too large
2.0,Breasts pop out of the bra especially when you bend down
2.0,"I got these and immediately loved them, the polarization is great and works beautifully. Colors look vivid and clear and it makes driving much easier. Then, I unfolded them to put them on just like always and...the temple literally sheared in half (pictured) I was pretty stunned to see them break this way. Usually the hinge breaks off or the screw falls out, the temple completely just broke in half. Not sure I would buy again after this."
2.0,"Not a great replica of the scene, too digitized."
2.0,"Purchased the wallet in Amazon for $20!<br />I had the wallet for 2 weeks when I noticed the plastic locking latch & cracked & broken...<br /><br />Called Amazon & they couldn't repair or replace it, so they issued a refund.<br /><br />Then I emailed Sharkk (support@Sharkk.com) to see if they could repair or replace it... being that they are the manufacturer I was under the assumption that maybe they could do something more to stand behind their product!<br />Instead after about a week & a half customer service told me, &#34;...We cannot replace and refund your item. I hope you have a great day.&#34;  So, if I want a new wallet I have to pay $50... Why? Just so the cheap plastic piece can break again!<br /><br />I materials used to make this wallet could be better!  Beware if you buy this cheap plastic/aluminum box, & hopefully you don't have any issues!"
2.0,"The fit itself was perfect and was extremely cute, however I wore it for a total of two hours and the strap complete ripped. I didn’t pull it or anything the stitching was just not up to par. Extremely disappointed."
2.0,"The fabric seems rough, there are only 2 buttons, not 3, as pictured, the shirt itself is rather boxy.<br />The colors are fine"
2.0,"So I read some reviews that it might not fit if you have big boobs, and being very well endowed myself I was worried about it...but I had lost a little weight and the dress is pretty cheap so I decided to go for it.<br />First of all, it was waaaay too small, not in the breast area, but the collar wouldn't fit around my neck, and the sleeves were too small for my upper arms. Even the apron didn't fit properly the sleeves being too small between my waist and my shoulders. You'd have to be really young to fit into this outfit properly. (it ironically fit around my waist tho...)<br />The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one, is because I cut the bodice off and hemmed it, and now the pink skirt is the cutest thing in my closest. Nobody can even tell it used to be a dress. The fabric is shiny and soft and the accessories it came with were still super cute, so I still wear those too &#60;3 Anyway, if you're a curvy girl, or if you have arms bigger then a 10 year old, maybe skip this dress unless you want to re purpose it lol"
2.0,wasnt wide enough to fit the boots..
2.0,"Feels cheap, you get what you pay for I guess. I LOVE the print but the function of it isn't great. I used it one time and when I was sliding it into the magnet the band came off the pins :( I would rather have put the money into a better quality band."
2.0,"I really liked the style of these, but one fell out the 1st time I wore themand I still haven't found it. I saved the other 1 of course and where it mis matched with another earring. Too light weight."
2.0,Hard to tell what what it’s supposed to be.
2.0,Bought a large and dress fits like a small.
2.0,"I bought the case for my daughter who absolutely loves it. However, the casing has become distorted and only becomes worse trying to clean it."
2.0,only wear it one night already get a lot of pilling on the front.
2.0,Sorry but the one I received was defective. The top was grayish black. The seller was cordial in refunding my money
2.0,"The pants were too rough for me.  I usually wear these types of pants to travel, and I like light, comfortable pants.  Just my personal opinion."
2.0,The shoes was to small for a 12 and tight on the front toe area.  The rubber to the bottom of the shoe come off or unglued the second week. for the amount of money spent. The product should be made much better. since a good  shoes for man designer that is  can cost for 179 and above. The shoes  isn't name brand. Need to have make 13 or 14 and work.
2.0,It’s was printed upside down and it falls down my face.
2.0,"Cheaply made for the money. They look fine but feel like a cheap plush toy. Not much stretch to them, fit is a little tight."
2.0,It really confuses me when products fit in the bottoms (size L) and not the top. The bottoms were actually big on me and the bra cups couldn't fit anyone who was a B cup or above.<br /><br />I bought the black 2 piece set with the high waisted underwear. It looks like the larger the size the larger the band (without increasing cup size). As fat as the bottom goes they seem to be given extra waist height as well but the width stays the same. If you have an ounce of 🍑🍑 the bottoms will be a thong vs mesh panties.<br /><br />The proportions are all off.
2.0,I don’t like the concept of the blouse<br />And for a heavy bust the torso is small.  wears like a crop top.
2.0,The skirt is cute on it’s own but im missing the red chain. I bought it for a specific outfit for a music festival so it was very disappointing.
2.0,Fits and looks like pajamas
2.0,It is a beautiful wallet.  I bought it several months ago but just started using it 2 weeks ago.  My only problem is that the leather scuffs easily and it is flaking off at that site.
2.0,Cheap material.  Thin and easily fades
2.0,"It's frumpy, the material is too heavy, it hangs down too long, the pockets are placed weirdly and it kind of hangs off one shoulder. I don't like it, it's too big order a couple sizes down"
2.0,"This wallet is well-made but too thick for me. After using it for a day, I also realized that a clear ID window on the outside, which this lacks, is very useful. Given the high price of this wallet, I wanted something more suitable to my tastes and returned it."
2.0,I want to say I love this filter but unfortunately it has a very weird smell.
2.0,"The earrings I received do not look like these.  In the picture the enamel looks pearl like.  The ones I have are solid white.  Plus they are chunky and quite frankly, they're ugly.  I don't wear them.  They look so cheap.  I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,"I like the look of the brushed aluminum, but like all sunglasses I should have tried them on before buying. The lens frames are gigantic and dont sit well on the nose. The size of the frames sort of resembles that of novelty gigantic sunglasses that clowns wear."
2.0,"These look just like the cheap sandals you would find at a Chinese supermarket for $5. I mean, that’s probably precisely what they are and where they came from: China. Amazon sellers like to buy these cheap Chinese products at wholesale and sell them at a mark up on Amazon. The Chinese supermarket only sells at a minor markup therefore it’s only $5 there.  Well, you get these delivered to your door so there’s the convenience factor but these are not $15 sandals. They are $5 sandals. If you’re looking for cheaply made lightweight sandals that won’t trap too much water, this gets the job done but don’t expect quality or for them to last very long."
2.0,"I’m 5’6”, 150 lbs and normally wear a size 10. In tops that can be a medium or large. This top has a smaller chest/bust so the cute babydoll (empire waistline) rides up to the middle of my chest (and that looks super weird). My caveat; I have a large bust 38DD, so if you have a smaller measurement this might be ok. However there are two other oddities. The sleeves are oddly tight by the elbow and the side seams flare out at the bottom (and poke out). The fabric is nice and has stretch (I bought the blue floral). Sending mine back."
2.0,"The hat was very pretty, purchase it for my vacation. However it was to small. Gave it to my thirteen year old daughter."
2.0,I dislike this because my mask won’t stay up on my face. I liked the fact that it would hang around my neck for when i needed to take it down but the constant having to tighten it up got on my nerves.
2.0,"I loved this material and the dress, but it is very high-waisted for someone 5'7&#34; tall. The waistline hit me a little above the bottom of my rib cage. It just didn't look right. Wish it came in a tall size, though I'm only 'medium' tall - I usually don't have to order tall sizes. I would have loved it if it would fit right. I returned it."
2.0,The pants can apart at the waist the first time I wore them
2.0,I bought this specifically because it’s listed as high support. That’s a joke. This wouldn’t be high impact for an A Cup let alone anything larger. It’s definitelt cut but it’s super cheaply made and won’t last. Definitely returning.
2.0,Too short and didnt have pockets.
2.0,"The watch alone is amazing. If you need a watch, get it. Thought just a warning that, for me at least, it may cause a rash/many bumps or appear in the area you wear it. I’m not allergic to the material as I know of, i’ve only been allergic to dogs. So for this to happen, is very weird- Id say maybe it was because I was wearing it too tight, but I wasn’t."
2.0,"In less than a year, the top layer of black-dyed leather flaked off in several spots, exposing the underside of the material. I'll try using the buckle portion with another similar belt."
2.0,Broke as soon as I attempted to put it on!
2.0,Not true to size. X lge fits lke a medium.
2.0,Muy grande para ser small
2.0,"The advertized colors on web site shows the blue as teal blue/light blue. It is a darker shade of blue and doesn’t look as good as the lighter blue in the website photos.<br /><br />Also the belt ties weirdly under the breasts and doesn’t give a good fit.<br /><br />Plus the material is very very hot for summer, this can not be work in warmer weather at all."
2.0,I ordered a 4XL and it fits like an American sized Medium. Order way big...
2.0,They don't work very well.
2.0,"These are cute. Glad to have boy-short option for a girl. However, the material is quite fragile. The first time my kid wore these, the fabric showed wear (pilling), and she hardly sat on any surface or did much of anything to rub the fabric. We have not had this problem with previous swimming bottoms (for babies/toddlers) but perhaps that's because those were from a different company (and continent) and therefore were of better quality."
2.0,The ear cuff is too long for my ear.  I like the ear cuff but it is a little too much for me.
2.0,The clasp broke. As pretty as it is it's not an item that should be bought
2.0,2XL is not even close to an actual 2XL regardless of what the size chart says!
2.0,"it really works ok.  when it gets dark had it on halloween couple bad things though,it doesn’t look like there’s any light on during day time and the mouth hole isn’t big enough so the inside of the mask gets wet and gross. also at night the lights were the eyes were got really bright and i started getting dizzy and couldn’t see anything so i had to take the mask off"
2.0,Really small fit.
2.0,"If your head is the size of a basketball, they should fit great."
2.0,"Look, it’s elastically- so it fit, but it looked like hell and didn’t at all look like the picture. The material is basically spandex and I wasn’t expecting that, but a higher quality dress for the price"
2.0,"The ""spokes"" of these earrings are made of heavy gauge wire resulting in a very heavy earring. The weight causes my ear lobes to stretch and I will not be able to wear them. I gave two stars because I love the look of them. Someone with thicker lobes could probably wear them."
2.0,"It's clearly cheaply made, not like the originals."
2.0,One of the leather strands separated from the silver clamp the second time it was worn.
2.0,The chain is very cheap and was broken when I received it. The size of the charm was larger then expected and seemed like it should be on a man’s necklace. I sent this item back.
2.0,It will total hide ur curve...which is not a good thing for me. Chest line stiching is messed up. That's make this dress looks odd on you. Ok dress. Not a happ dress  .
2.0,"What is to wear to work and they were very snug In all the wrong places.  I know I am not a model, but they’ve made me look like I had a gigantic muffin top. Not happy at all so I returned for a refund"
2.0,LIKED IT!
2.0,Don't need it
2.0,and now its too short.
2.0,"I ordered a size up because of all of the reviews saying that the shirt ran small. The shirt I received did not run small. It’s huge on me since I ordered an XL and I usually wear a L. A size L would have been much better fitting. The shirt took 3 weeks to arrive. Which is a pretty long time to wait, but, THE RETURN PERIOD IS 4 WEEKS. So, while you are waiting for this shirt to ship from China, your return clock is ticking. By the time you get the shirt you can’t return because it’s been a month since you ordered it. I can’t return my ill fitting shirt because of this reason. Also, when the shirt did finally show up, the neckline was all stretched out. No amount of washing and drying will get it back in shape. It’s basically a “wear around the house” shirt now. At least I only paid $10 for it. But definitely disappointing. The positives? The screen printing seems to be decent quality and the shirt material is nice and thick. It’s a shame it’s not fit to wear in public."
2.0,I’m trying to send this back
2.0,Did not look anything like the picture. Seemed to be a polyester type material. I returned it right away.
2.0,"The top fit well, but the bottom was way too small"
2.0,"very strong bad odor, does not look or feel like leather"
2.0,"The socks are cute, but nothing like the picture. Wouldn't purchase again."
2.0,Quality isn't there but for the price what can you expect
2.0,I’m disappointed that the fabric is so thin and sheer. The length is good. I wish the fabric had more body to it. Probably won’t purchase again.
2.0,"The pattern is nice, but the dress looks like a costume. The material is all stretchy and flow and has a very cheap look."
2.0,"Reading the reviews, these glasses either work or they don't.  They seem to work best for people with the most limited color vision.  I definitely see colors and don't really realize how color blind I am until I take one of those tests with the multi-color dots and am a bit shocked with how few numbers I can make out.  I have red/green color blindness which I believe is the most common form of color blindness.  These glasses did very little for me.  Initially they did nothing.  After about 30 minutes, some colors, notably some oranges and some blues seemed more vibrant and saturated than they had without the glasses.  But the change wasn't dramatic enough to make these worthwhile.  I'm not saying they won't work for anyone, just not for my particular situation.  Given the expense and how little change they made, I'll be returning them, but it was interesting to try them."
2.0,broke the first night I wore it
2.0,"The material was really nice, color was just what I wanted, too.  I'll not return it but gift it or alter it somehow...maybe?"
2.0,My daughter keeps falling in these shoes... they are comfortable for her but the bulkyness makes it hard fire kids to play in
2.0,"Cheap. Breaks easily. I tried cleaning them. After i took them out of the cleaner, they all started to break and chip. Poor ! Definitely a waste of my money."
2.0,very poor product!
2.0,"2 stars just for the look. Very unreliable product, broke twice already and I wasn't pulling it or dragging it. My husband fixed it once, not even going to bother 2nd time, in the trash it goes... 😱"
2.0,I wear a small and that's what I bought but when I tried it on it was VERY wide. So wide that even with a belt it was way too much material
2.0,"Falls off my feet, may I have a different pair?"
2.0,Braclet came in broken. Super glue will fix that and the clasp holding the material together on the necklace came apart. All fixable just annoying
2.0,"The choker is ok for it’s price, BUT I used it once and the lock broke. Poor quality."
2.0,The earrings have already lost parts from them. I did get alot of compliments on them before they started falling apart.
2.0,"The only good thing about this was the return process. Once I receive the dress and tried it on there is absolutely no way to tighten this dress up and be able to get yourself dressed without somebody else's help. If you're in a situation like myself and can't imagine having your date coming to pick you up only to find out they have to help you get into your dress, don't buy this dress. However if you have plenty of people to help you simply put a dress on and tie up the back of it, good luck with that."
2.0,"This product came super late. I ordered it to be a secret santa gift. I contacted seller to cancel and get a refund and they said the package has arrived but it didnt. They woundnt give me a refund. Then when the package came and I looked at it. It was small. The material of the hoodie is nice. It doesnt have pockets. I gave the hoodie to my niece who is 12 and she loved it so I guess it all worked out in the end. I guess if you want to order it for adults, you can order a size up. Just dont expect a refund if its the wrong size."
2.0,"Although this is pretty it’s also pretty useless. It holds four credit cards (two on each side) like the ad says but the compartment inside which you must squeeze to make it open doesn’t work because the credit cards on the outside prevent you from doing so. The compartment was one of the reasons I ordered it, and now it is useless, but I must admit pretty."
2.0,It's okay but turns black after a few times of usage. Take multiple if you want to wear it often.
2.0,"It’s kinda ugly, but it’s comfy and has little thumb warmers 🤷🏻‍♀️"
2.0,"Dissapointed...😣nice dress, nice color, but too small and see trough"
2.0,They are not fluffy fleece but more of a french terry.
2.0,"I've broken two thus far and I've only had them since the end of February 2022. They broke where they connect to the actual Fitbit. Also the design wears off a bit on the edges if you wear them 24/7. I wanted to like them but it has been not even 5 months and two have broken so ... Cute and colors vibrant, they feel nice but broke too quick."
2.0,"Not thrilled w quality... Is OK !! Nothing to rave over , pic is nicer.."
2.0,I wear a small normally but ordered this in a medium. It's definitely a little smaller than it should be. The sleeves are too short and the sweatshirt liner doesn't exist. It's just material on zipper and sleeves. Doesn't run through entire jacket.
2.0,Material is really cheap feeling.  I will never wear this.
2.0,Hard and uncomfortable but they look so cute on!
2.0,So this skirt is very nice but has no stretch I can’t get over my butt (lol). This was definitely made for small girls nothing plus size about the it.<br /><br />If you a big girl that’s bottom heavy I would recommend this u would be able to get over ur butt n if u get over it will barely cover it since I tried to put it on from my head down and everything was hanging out
2.0,"I bought this as a replacement band for my UMIDIGI GT watch, which I bought last year. Since the silicone band that came with the watch basically fell apart after about a year, I decided to get a metal band this time. I ordered this band in black, which would be a perfect match. I had to take out one link to make the strap fit my wrist, which wasn't difficult to do. I thought that the strap looked really nice and was happy with the purchase; however, after about two weeks, I noticed that some of the black finish was wearing away. Apparently, the finish on this stainless steel strap was simply black paint, sprayed on, not baked on or powder coat. Not durable at all."
2.0,"Comes from China, so you know what you're getting.  Material is thin and somewhat see through, but the dress is extremely large on me, requiring me to tailor it to fit."
2.0,Finally found a light raincoat that fits but when you move it sounds like a crinkley plastic bag! Very cheap material. A bit disappointed in WW for this bad quality.
2.0,"I sized up and it was the cutest flowery dress that went to right above my knees, and I’m tall 5’10” after a wash and a hang dry it shrunk so bad it barely covers my butt. So sad about this, and it would cost me to send it back so I’m just going to give it to my neice. :/"
2.0,I’m 5’9” and this dress just doesn’t work for someone of my height. The top has a strange fit that smashes my boobs and the length hits below the knee one to two inches. It looked like I was wearing a pillowcase or that I should be churning butter. Not flattering at all
2.0,"I almost gave it three stars but had to rate it lower seeing all the high marks it got from others!  This is worth what it cost.  The design is pretty, and it seems fairly sturdy (won't fall apart in a day) but it is really cheap looking because of the materials. It is metal but manages to look like painted plastic. The large red stones especially are dull; the smaller red crystals pick up the light a smidge more. I thought, well I could wear it out and nobody would probably notice that it is so cheap, but nah.  I doubt I ever will. A pre-teen might love it though, except it would probably run too big."
2.0,The nose ring started getting brassy after about a week and a half of wearing it and it started to turn my nose green from the cheap metal.
2.0,"The color is not Red, however they do look like one of the pictures, which is different from all. They are a pink"
2.0,Super cute except its tiny it barely fits on my pinky! I normaly wear a size 7 1/2 on my wedding ring finger! Also feels very rough to the touch.
2.0,I don’t like the part- time clothes!
2.0,Cheap pair of glasses with a blur mark on the plastic lens.
2.0,"Very cute in the picture but you get what you pay for.  Very cheaply made and does not wear well or fit right.  The opening of the cold shoulder lays awkwardly and sleeves are quite long.  Thin, thin and cheap yarn that is not stitched well."
2.0,The picture was deceiving. This necklace is very large and gaudy looking and not flattering on me at all :(
2.0,This dress did not look like it shows.  It also didn't fit at all well.  The blue color is beautiful but to bad the rest of it was bad.
2.0,"Eh, thought I would use them to work out and results are completely trash.. they're extremely loose on the top and it doesn't hug well. definitely using them to wear around the house and to bed"
2.0,The size chart isn't right for these
2.0,"I wear a women's 22, which after wearing awhile gets a bit baggy.  But since I've had some prior experience with the GV brand, I thought I should up to a 24.  Not even CLOSE to buttoning the pants!!  There's no way they could have been a 24...maybe mismarked.  Actually somewhere between an 18-20."
2.0,A little snug and wrinkled easily.
2.0,The backs to these stud earrings were not attached in the shipment.  Now I know why. The holes were way to small for the earring posts.  Like the earrings.  used my own posts.  Will not ever buy from them again
2.0,Shirt too small never had time to return it. I love the shirt just can’t wear it.
2.0,Almost sleeveless and doesn’t cover everything we like to cover. Bottom is very wide. Doesn’t DT’s thing for the figure
2.0,"Nothing to do with the photo, very poor quality product"
2.0,"I like the material however the sizing is not accurate. They run very small in relation to the expected size. I wear a large or XL at most. The XXL had a stranglehold on my thighs.  I guess that is okay if that is what you are looking for. Love the light material, really wish they would fit."
2.0,"I really wanted to love this sweater but the colors are off; not as pictured. The fit was normal, not oversized or too tight."
2.0,Too small but cute design
2.0,Only came w/ one pair of glasses and I thought there were going to be two. Disappointed
2.0,L does not run large enough. XXL is too large. XL is apparently not available or in stock. Disappointed.
2.0,These were my favorite earrings until the silver starting wearing off. Now they’re turning orange. And Ive only had them for a month.
2.0,Disappointed that this is too small.
2.0,Not happy with this bathrobe. First of all the lint it gives off is ridiculous. Even after a thorough wash there's lint all over the place. The material isnt particularly thick or warm either. Expect to be cold and full of lint if using as a bathrobe..<br />The only reason it got 2 stars is it is pretty good looking and i can still use it as a robe around the house.
2.0,These tend to not be secure on all glasses.
2.0,"Love the apron design, but it did not hold up well in the washer. After only one wash, the apron lost a significant amount of color and is now medium gray (it was washed on a gentle cycle, in cold water without bleach). Also, one of the tie strings was poorly sewn on and fell off. I had to sew it back on."
2.0,"I ordered a M and it looks more like an L... Is not very warm (You would need to use some interior shirts and all with it. When I took it out of the bad it smelled bad... Like armpit bad!.. I can't explain it. It almost made me puke... So I decided to wash it, all the water turned completely red... Is very low quality"
2.0,Delivered folded. Very cheap material. Hard to bend back in shape.
2.0,Quality wasn't good enough
2.0,Returned. Was not what I expected.
2.0,Not what I expected and not ankle length
2.0,The green is not pretty color. The sweater is itchy. Not happy with product.
2.0,The wrinkles. I cannot re-iron this dress everytime I get up from sitting down.
2.0,do not like that they show your toes
2.0,Cheap and heavy
2.0,Material feels thin and cheap. It could work as a bathing suit coverup.
2.0,Broke just after the return window closed. 👎🏻
2.0,"Falls off of my face, and my son's. Way too big"
2.0,"I was very excited when I saw all the internal bags this bag had. It's spacy enough even if you have a 17&quot; laptop. It's comfortable and looks good. I can put all my stuff in the different places, which are very comfortable. Most people wouldn't think that it contains a laptop. HOWEVER, the pieces (zipper, &quot;arma&quot;)  started falling apart after 2 months of use. I asked for help from ebags but they never returned my questions. If i were you, I would buy a LLBean bag. THOSE one really last and have guarantee."
2.0,"I was really excited about these. The picture is deceiving, they are much much bigger with way more fabric than they appear online. It is not a really even that close to a bandana type thing, it is more like a lightweight balaclava that doesnt stay in position for long periods of time. They were also quite tight, I do have a large head - hat size 7 3/8-5/8, so ya."
2.0,The top is just too small to get your hand into or see what's in the bag. The proportions just aren't practical.
2.0,This robe is very thin (see thru). I returned it.
2.0,This dress is very cute in the picture and I'm sure it would be cute had it fit correctly. They asked for measurements and I sent them but the waste sits in an odd spot for me and the chest was too big. Overall the dress was a little too big but I'm still going to try and make it work. I had asked my lady who adjust clothes for me what she would do and she said she did not like the way it was put together and for her to adjust it at all she would have to take it completely apart and put it back together.
2.0,"not as warm as other wool blends,,,run small,,"
2.0,The pink ones see through like I tried it with all nude under wear and bra and you could still see the outline. I returned it for that reason. The dress is beautiful but I’d buy a different color
2.0,Was really tight right above the stomach looks weird we’re it was stitched.
2.0,"Doesn't fit right, the seam is very visible. Very disappointing."
2.0,There is zero compression in this top.  Zero.
2.0,These will not fit if you use a rechargeable battery pack. It is made out of Brittle plastic that will snap if your not careful.
2.0,It isn’t worth returning but i wouldn’t suggest it.<br /><br />The finish is chuncky
2.0,For a pack designed to be used in the backcountry I was very surprised to find that the zipper pull is made of plastic and very flimsy.  After two months of use (4-5 trips) The zipper broke. When I contacted customer support they asked that I pay to ship the pack back to them for free repair.<br /><br />As a owner of multiple Dakine packs and outerwear I will be avoiding of Dakine products moving forward.
2.0,"Unfortunately, these are way too short relative to other sweatpants."
2.0,Came Ripped.
2.0,Material is really cheap.
2.0,"I wish the bungee cords were longer, still fitting the tie-down bracket which only holds a 3/4 inch ball.  3 inch cords are strong, but need 6-9 inch bungee to secure tie-down fixture to either side of my patio walls.  Very disappointing that Collaroo doesn’t offer various cord lengths.  Also the plastic fixture would crack quickly exposed to HOT Arizona west facing patio in the afternoons and evenings."
2.0,Nice dress just not how I thought it would fit.
2.0,I am dissapointed.  The earrings where not to my expectations.  The leopard fabric did not cover rhe entire earrings.  Poor quality
2.0,Too small. I ordered a 3X which normally fits with extra room.  I prefer to have a shirt be too big than too tight. I managed to get it on but it was a struggle to get it off.  Instead of returning it I'm going to gift it to someone.
2.0,"Super cute suit and loved the fit. However, it tore along the seams within a few trips into the pool."
2.0,"These were cute but definitely a little tight, and the pleating felt very uncomfortable. It was really bumpy, not smooth, and very noticeable when wearing, walking, sitting, etc. I wore them once for about 3 hours, put them back in my drawer, and when I pulled them on the second time, there was a hole in the butt. This was not from overwear or from washing. It was definitely just weak material. I'd say search elsewhere as these were mostly a waste of money."
2.0,"I ordered these with low expectations. They came and I tried them on as soon as I opened them, just because my expectations were low. They fit nicely. So, I washed them. They continued to fit well after that first washing. But the second cycle of wearing them proved vexxing as they apparently stretched a great deal. The wedgies were so persistent one day that I actually went into the ladies room (while I was at school!) and just took them off. Going commando was far more agreeable to my poor tush than continuing to pull these underwear out of my pancreas every 2 minutes. If wedgies don't bother you, these will probably do fine for you. But if you're sensitive to any sort of clothing-caused irritation, don't bother with these. And what's even more irritating is the fact that these were much more expensive than the shoddy underwear you can get at Target or Walmart."
2.0,"The fit on this is as one would expect; it fits great. However, I am not sold on the actual buckle quality, and I am worried it might break after multiple uses. Then again, the price is totally reflective of this and you get what you pay for."
2.0,"I misread the description and thought that this was a 6-pack of panties. There was only 1 and the material was too bindy for my preference.  I won't reorder, but they may exactly what other ladies prefer."
2.0,A Very low quality dress.
2.0,The inserts of lace looking material is itchy so the top is uncomfortable to wear.  Looks okay but larger than the size chart indicated.  I had to take it in on the sides but now the itchy bit is keeping it on a hanger in the closest rather than on me.
2.0,"Unfortunately, I wore holes in these within two weeks - one just outside the rubber bottom and one in the toe somehow, so these just aren't very durable. Had to throw them away today when the hole in the toe went all the way through."
2.0,"I had a similar necklace to this one that I loved and lost it.  bought this as a replacement. Unfortunately, because of the backing of the triangle shaped charm, it doesn’t like flat which ruins the whole look of the necklace."
2.0,Very heavy and sits on the collarbone. However...super fun and love the style. Wore it to a studio 54 party
2.0,"looked good, but didn't hold on the watch and soon broke. I wouldn't buy another"
2.0,After just one week one of the stones/gems has fallen out also a piece of the filigree is missing on one side of the charm (see circled items)
2.0,"Not flattering unless your body is model thin,  skirt is longer than shown in image. Disappointed this didn’t work out since it’s lovely looking"
2.0,Doesn’t look like the photo at all
2.0,Looks good from outside. But close examination reveals poor or uneven stitching. The left and right pockets are stitched differently. The right side pocket appears to be attached to internal seam to reduce flopping. The left side does not have this attachment stitch and moves around freely. Definitely runs small. XXL fits like L.
2.0,"This is a nice looking piece, but I was looking for something I could wear at all times for religious reasons. After only a few days it broke, and I was able to fix it. Well, a few days later it broke again, and it discovered it's plated with pewter as well as I started to see a copper looking metal under the plating. The chain is also very uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. To add insult to injury I had to pay shipping to return it. If you're looking for something you don't wish to take off, and not have it break keep looking."
2.0,"Product looks very stylish but after 2 weeks, it ripped on the inside and it was not full.  It is very cheaply made."
2.0,"Such potential - that's why I'm giving it two stars instead of one. (Cute reversible sequins, great color!)<br />This bag split on the first day and I had to worry all day that things would fall out. Several other friends bought it with the same results. It's not OK to have to sew an item after its first use. Yes, you get what you pay for but this is not worth it. Seriously. Do not support throw away culture. Buy things that will last and that don't just wind up in a landfill after a couple of uses. This is heinous."
2.0,"I got this for my conch, it was bigger than I anticipated or wanted but since it was shorter than the jewelry I was pierced with I decided to keep it in. Stainless steel right so that shouldn't be a problem. After washing my hair I noticed it was all black around my ear from the jewelry. It washed off fine and there's no infection but that scared the crap out of me.<br />So not stainless steel. I wish people would just be honest about what the jewelry is made from."
2.0,"The quality of the dress is good and I loved it, but the chest part is way to small for me. I ordered my usual size and it did not fit as you see in the picture."
2.0,They broke within 24 hours.  At first just one of the chains broke off then the others...they did not snag or catch on anything just literally fell off.  The stones were bigger and a much lower quality than I was expecting for the price
2.0,"They fit great, but the way the tab is stitched in the back whether it is the way it is stitched or the thread I am not sure, but it itches and turns red by days end, so if wearing an undershirt you'd be ok if it is tucked in, if not, they are uncomfortable."
2.0,Didn't like that the top flap wasn't lined with suede.. Returned as there wasn't an option to wear the boots with the flap turned down.
2.0,"I bought this watch band for my wife and it has been in use at this point for maybe 5 days. The watch band looks nice, its soft on the skin and comfortable. Unfortunately the band has started to fail as it is seperating from the piece that connects to the watch"
2.0,This sweater was not how I thought it would look like the picture the deer looked sparkly in the picture but when I opened it wasn’t ... not happy
2.0,I ordered this because the strap on my old one broke. I didn’t look at it closely enough and got one I didn’t want. It’s listed as a men’s watch but it’s tiny. It would be great for a kid but I wouldn’t recommend it to an adult.
2.0,Much larger than I thought. Perhaps I missed dimensions. Sent it back. Great floral colors though.
2.0,"Very beautiful, color gorgeous but......unless you are 19 or have implants this bra has little appeal and does nothing for your figure. Virtually no support, cup are thin lace no lining no padding.  If you're looking for a boost this is not the bra to buy. Also sizes are 1 to 2 size smaller than expected. So if you wear a 38 order a 40 or 42."
2.0,Cute but not long enough for size 12. Broke first day of wear smh
2.0,This is a one day outfit. The pants bead up right after the first wash. It’s a shame because my son loves Toy story.
2.0,Clasp doesn't have a tight lock. I wore it for the first time yesterday and lost the lava stone.  Unfortunately I will be returning it.  The chain scratches my neck and snagged my shirt.
2.0,This I had to send back because stuffing was coming through seams under the right arm.  It was sub standard to me.
2.0,I like Casio Watches. I dislike their bands. This watch particularly. It's in the very last hole in the band. Every Cassio watch I have bought over the last 25 years was retired while still working perfectly was due to a broken band and a replacement band costing as much or more than the original watch. I believe they do this solely to sell watches.
2.0,I gave these a two star because they were exactly as described. Also shipping turn around was very fast. I did however return them.
2.0,Disappointed with the product overall. Does not adhere well to painted wall.
2.0,The dress is as pictured but very thin and the matter feels and looks very cheap.
2.0,The studs are much larger than you'd think. So if you want a large stud. This is for you!
2.0,"Mask was $13.99, not worth the cost. If it were $6-8.00 yea. It's discolored, so i had to use a marker to fix the hair area, and white nail polish to fix the eyes. A friend ordered one from the same seller and that one was too botched to fix."
2.0,Order 2 sizes up ladies...
2.0,"The image makes it seem like these are so cushy and soft, but in reality they are rough and have that cheap sock smell. Not for me."
2.0,strange fit. looks cheap in the front. Quick return
2.0,really don't like the color in person and it is a baggy item
2.0,They do the job but not worth it. I’d recommend looking elsewhere.
2.0,These sunglasses broke the second time they were worn.
2.0,I used the size chart and read other reviews and it is WAY too big. I can't even wear it.
2.0,These where not as wide as picture.
2.0,"This is an extremely cheap and poorly made item. Gloves are different sizes, one of the wrist-straps was broken upon opening the box, and one shooter doesn't shoot. Note that you have to hit the lever much harder than you'd expect to make anything shoot, so it is really hard to shoot it in the proper position (inside of wrist & hitting lever w/middle finger). Also the shooters are very big and clunky on a kid's wrists. Due to all of the above, it was only played with for about a day before kids lost interest."
2.0,"I wish I would have saved my money.  I bought these for 2 reason.  1st I wanted a pair of polarized safety glasses for my motorcycle.  2nd because I liked the idea of having the different lenses without having to carry around multiple frames.  The reason for the 2 stars.  First no instructions were given on how to remove then replace the lenses.  I figured it out, but I like to read proper instructions as to not damage my products.  There is also a huge gap at the bottom of the lenses when wearing them.  I would not advertise a product that exposes that much of your eye as being for safety purposes.  The only plus I will give them is for the case and organization of the lenses.  I would return them if it wasn't for having to pay return shipping."
2.0,"Nice but didn’t fit as expected , ordered a size 4x and fits as a size 2x"
2.0,thong/toe area very uncomfortable..  the platform itself is ok though.
2.0,Bands are little short for fase mask
2.0,"The product is very pretty but extremely large for a microdermal top (regardless of where it’s placed on your body). Unfortunately I have double dermals on my arm and the micro dermal top snagged on EVERYTHING causing my piercing to swell. It also do not sit flushed to you skin. Very pretty but I’d only use it for microdermal piercings located out of reach of anything (I.E. chest, collar bone)"
2.0,fit to tightly
2.0,"I bought these for my infant, they were advertised as Baby headbands but they were significantly too big.  I returned them."
2.0,Top was very loose and bottom was very small
2.0,Buttons came off when taking it off. Looks good but made with poor quality
2.0,"One earring mostly cream color, while other one mostly brown.<br />Would have preferred a closer match."
2.0,Poor quality and very thin and light material.  Rey bad poor stitching with broken shirt button in bag
2.0,"Given the price I didn't anticipate that this would be a super high quality product, but hoped to comfortably wear it over leggings in the wintertime. Although the fit is fine, the bottom few snaps come undone very easily. It's a cute style, but don't think I'll be able to wear it out of the house unless I sew the snapped area together."
2.0,"The shirt ran too small, so I need to send it back."
2.0,The shoes were cute but the strap was way too long and the size sticker was stuck on the shoes with no way to peel them off without damaging the shoe
2.0,"These are somewhat cute I guess but the fact that the band inside warps on the first wash and is nearly impossible to put back into place to lay flat on your hips makes it not worth the price. The pants I received also came with a huge hole in the crotch and thigh area so everyone can see which is just wonderful. A huge waste of $20, do not recommend at all. Shipping back is such a hassle I just threw them in the trash and will never order from this company again."
2.0,Material very cheap. Fit well but I gave it away before I wore it.
2.0,The material is not very stretchy. it could be that this one was defective because I do not have a lot of hair and it was taut in the middle - most beanies leave space to stretch. This one however was taut in a space that should be wide.  I loved the color though. I wanted to keep it but I could not wear it comfortably so I had to return it.
2.0,Could not get this one to clip on and stay.
2.0,Cups are a little too small and so this turned into a sort of push up minimizer hybrid
2.0,I'm very disappointed with the durability of the socks. 2 1/2 months doesn't seem to be long enough for the price. Otherwise they were OK.
2.0,Very thick fabric that does not go with the style of the dress. It is like waring upholstery.
2.0,"Got the purple set. It is missing multiple sets of sizes, plugs, tapers and more, some were also different mixed with sizes, wondering if this might have been previously used and returned..."
2.0,It is cute but the size is way off.  I gave it to my 14 year old granddaughter
2.0,"I returned it.  As a tall woman (5'9&#34;), I often expect waistlines to hit me a little higher than the average woman, but this dress was just not going to work.  The waitline is higher than it looked in the picture and it just wasn't flattering at all."
2.0,"Very cute on.  I only wore it once and when I put it in the washer and dried it, it now has holes in the front."
2.0,It’s made very strangely. Especially in the armpit area and if you have any thing more than an extra inch in the Daria area the dress gets jacked up in the back in the front stays normal so it looks weird sadly I’m going to have to return this material is just OK and the dress is not aligned at all
2.0,"Flops I rate a 5 star. Could not be happier with them. I refuse to give the seller any higher than a 2 star just for slipping in the 100% shipping fee. That practive should be banned. All it does is make the seller look bad. If you need 35 bucks to make a profit, price them at 35 bucks with free shipping and be done."
2.0,"Either I used them wrong or they just suck. Cloth fibers everywhere, EVERYWHERE I TELL YOU."
2.0,Cheap looking.  Returned.  The kind of thing they sell for $5 at outdoor farmer's markets.
2.0,"Not as pictured! Ordered for terminal family member whose feet stay cold and colors weren't even close to those pictured. Received pastels and picture shows dark. Color seems minute; however, she does not like pastel colors and I wanted her to have something in colors she really liked. No time to return these or I would have!!!"
2.0,"Washed and dried as normal after receiving them, these shrunk from an XL to about a medium. They looked like they were going to be decent otherwise, and seller accepted the return, so no big deal."
2.0,Unclasps easily and pins fall out
2.0,"You sit, the Velcro comes apart + you’re left with just the tie + zipper. Does not support you fupa🥹 the length is good but I have a big coco."
2.0,End up return it
2.0,"These looked nice enough on, but the gem fell out a couple weeks into wearing. I removed them every night before bed and was pretty disappointed overall."
2.0,Nice color.<br />Returned. Way too small even after ordering larger size
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress but it fits my curves in all the wrong ways.<br /><br />The material is really thin and prone to static so it sticks to you constantly. It’s just a hair too short and I’m 5’1.<br /><br />34C, 140 lbs and I normally wear 6-8 in dresses.<br /><br />There’s just not enough material on the dress. :/"
2.0,I’m surprised by the fit. It doesn’t lay as nicely on me as it does in the picture. It is super low cut. I guess I didn’t realize that. It’s a bummer bc I will never wear it. It is also big. I’m a small and it’s too big for me.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:6d2a393a398644d1a9bb356d21ef7941]] The image on the necklace charm is blurry… I didn’t think it would bother me much, but it just doesn’t look that good.. the silver medal started to turn into a pink/rose gold color not even fully there’s patches of it and there is still a lot of silver.. not a flattering color I love residence evil so I buy a lot of merchandise, but this was not a good find.."
2.0,Pro: durable metal<br />Con: *****NOT 7mm bar length.*****I normally wear a 6mm and it’s the same size as all my other piercing.
2.0,"Comfortable underwear, but the compression was disappointing.  I'm a medium.  In the past I had purchased another brand of compression underwear size medium and the compression was perfect.  These fit OK but not enough compression.  Order one size down.  I should have ordered a small."
2.0,Beautiful dress. Was disappointed it did not fit as the size chart indicated. Bought it to wear to a wedding and had to shop for something else at last minute.
2.0,"The scarf was soft and nice T-shirt type material, but the design I got wasn’t the one I order. Instead it was of 2 giraffes facing each other. Still cute, but not as much as the correct one."
2.0,Nice shirt but it was too short ????!!!!
2.0,The Bezel Plates come off easily. I sold 2 bracelets with glas Cabochons and both customers told me the tops feel off. I ordered a soldering gun to see if I can reinforce them. They should be attached better.
2.0,"I ordered a size up, but the fabric is too clingy.  The fabric is stretchy, so it fits and is not tight, it just shows every body flaw.  Very unflattering for anyone who is not extremely toned.  Perhaps another color might be better, but the white is just bad."
2.0,The under bands are way too loose while the rest of the top fits snug how it should. The design is just poor. Does not fit right.
2.0,The picture makes this look like it’s a dress. It’s not. It’s barely a long shirt. You WILL need leggings.
2.0,Didn’t like that only one of the headbands actually had the bandana print. Others looked like bean headbands... sad.
2.0,They seem to be ok if you want to make simple children bracelets because they look and feel really cheap
2.0,Too small for my face. I want to be able to have more room for my nose so Incan breath!
2.0,I am very satisfied with my purchase and it as shown!
2.0,"Cute, but the latch on one broke instantly. Very insubstantial."
2.0,"I got these for a Barre class. It had a hole on top of the sock after one class... So not even under, on top, I couldn't really understand how... I hadn't even washed it yet. I guess the price you pay is more for the inspirational phrase en on it than decent quality."
2.0,Clasp broke before I was able to wear it....no good
2.0,Great fit cheap fabric
2.0,I bought a size medium/large and it was too big. I wear a 34B in bras. I ordered another one in small/medium. I'm sure it will fit. It is very stylish.
2.0,"It's not really &#34;one size fits all&#34; just because the seller only has one size! It's actually an American small/medium. I can't imagine a person much bigger than me fitting into it. It was tricky to pull on, I was afraid my nails might damage it if I wasn't careful, it's like a second skin. It's kind of like the opposite of peeling off to get it on lol It wasn't as hard to get off, just peel it off. I'm 5'2&#34; and 135 lbs. I'm a bit overweight for my frame, especially in my stomach area (I had my fifth baby a year ago). It's snug. Though it does stretch. It rides up just walking. It's very short, booty is visible. Dancing in it or moving your body a lot you kind of just have to ignore the riding up, or be forever fixing it. Also, I was expecting a flat red. This is a metallic or wet red. I had to return it soley because of that. I got it to match the shoes, of course. In my opinion, the shoes are the centerpiece, the rest of your outfit are the supporting pieces. Otherwise, it's what I wanted. Sexy and promiscuous. Comfortable and flattering. It flattens pudgy areas, and holds up the breasts well. Mine are normally not bigger than a small B but since I'm nursing they are full C. I would have given it more stars if the color was described correctly and a true size was indicated. Accurate description is so important. We aren't shopping in a store where we can look closely and hold the material. Ya, sure free returns, but what a waste of resources. Just give the most accurate, detailed description to make it easier for online shoppers. It's common sense guys."
2.0,If you are a man with large feet...these do NOT fit like the white socks do.  They fit one size smaller.
2.0,It's really pretty but the quality is not good
2.0,Just bought the pants and the stitching is coming apart. For hiking pants I would hope it would be put together better!!!
2.0,"The fabric is nice and pretty BUT the fit is horrible, the symmetry is awful, defective."
2.0,"I ordered an XS, fits more like an XL... gave it to my sister as maternity wear though!! Fits her perfectly!!"
2.0,Run way small. Cute but disappointed
2.0,"had the grey, loved them. ordered the black, not the same pant at all. Doesn't wash up as well, wrinkles, and fit is not the same"
2.0,Not a brooch for a sweater.. dissatisfied .. cannot use for anything.  Do not recommend for purchase.  Not sure what Iwill do with it
2.0,Cute purse and nice size can fit my note books for work in it my main complaint which is important is that the inside of the bag smells terrible no matter what I sprayed in it the smell never left so I don't know what I am going to do with it. May be returning it!
2.0,Great slipper but... I wear a size 12 and ordered a 13 to give my feet breathing room. The 13 is like an 11.5! Very tight. Order larger size. I would return but don't want to bother. I wish I knew. Now you do.
2.0,snug
2.0,The style is beautiful.  Though is a problem it doesn't stay centered.  the middle part goes over to the right side of my chest.  Makes it uncomfortable to wear and part of  my right boob hangs out.
2.0,I found that there is no flexability with this item....too stiff
2.0,Fit looked funny at the back.
2.0,"It would have been very helpful to add a guide for which gem “stones” go to each month. I was able to match most of them from images off google, but not all of them. You do get 2 larger plastic gems glued to a pendant for each month. The other 48 gems come in the same size but glued to different shaped pendants."
2.0,"I returned this product without trying it on. I ordered a small (I am 5'5 and 125lbs and not busty) and it looked very small, not oversized as in pictures.  I was disappointed in the fabric as I was expecting a nice thicker material. It was a lot shorter than expected. This was just not what I wanted, but if you want a lighter weight sweater it may work for you."
2.0,Tiny!  Would be good for a little girl.
2.0,"Quite badly cut: while everything fits as it should, the chest is tight, the arms are tight, the neck is awkwardly loose—it's a muumuu with flair at best."
2.0,Glasses are comfortable and look great but I'm very disappointed in the rear visibility angle.. the mirror should be closer to the outer edge of the glasses. Can't be adjusted to see around my cheekbone..
2.0,"The dress is lovely, however the under dress is not long enough and easily rides up making the dress see through as the over dress layer is a mesh with the sequins and beads."
2.0,I wanted to love this dress but I actually sent it back. It came with a picked spot on the top front of the dress and looked as if someone had tried to sew it back. It was also a little smaller than expected.
2.0,Looks pretty but the cover did not fit 44 mm and that is the size I ordered!
2.0,"The white headband is simply perfection. The fabric feels super high quality, the print is cute, and it actually fits and stays in place on my small head. The black headband though...wow. The material is totally different. It feels and looks super cheap. It's also waaay larger than the white one and doesn't stay in place at all. It actually looked baggy when it put in on my head with my hair pulled back. I wish I could just buy the white one, but alas, they're going back."
2.0,Love the style of it and size however only used it for a little over a month now and the area where the straps connect is tearing the purse.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this jacket but it's simply too small. While the styling on this jacket is very attractive with good detailing in the color, hood, fastening, and zipper, the size is completely off. This jacket in a men’s medium could not even fit a small woman. In addition the fabric is stiff/rough and unpleasant to the touch. It feels as though it's unwaxed canvas that hasn't been washed or distressed at all to soften it. A pity that this garment that looks so attractive feels so stiff and rough and isn't sized right."
2.0,It runs two to three sizes small ifbyou want it draped like the picture shows.  Material is good for the price.  Mine was missing the pockets..... ☹️
2.0,The hair catcher is very flimsy. It doesn’t stay in that dome shape. It does catch most of my sons hair. Better than nothing.
2.0,Size is great but i received it with some metal that already changed color. I kept it since i hurt my sholuder so i cant carry totes anymore...but that should happen at least latter on after some wear not out of package!
2.0,"The waist band does not stretch at all and is designed to be quite tight. It is quite clear if I go for a bigger size, the neckline opening would be too big for me, unless I wear a tank underneath.<br /><br />I tried to return it, and the return was approved after a cryptic message from the seller.  The shipping cost was on me. Upon finding out how much it would cost to ship it back to China, I decided to keep it and maybe give it to charity or a friend as a gift.<br /><br />The design and colors of the dress are actually nice enough. The fabric looks and feels highly flammable. The zipper looks like it will fail pretty quick. Even for the first time, it got caught a few times just to carefully zip it open all the way.  I don't know how practical it is for daily wear.<br /><br />I notice that the product page listed a few occasions for the dress for the product title.  &#34;Prom Party Tunic Long Cocktail Beach Dress&#34;.<br /><br />I don't know what today's teens wear for the prom any more, but as far as I can tell from prom dresses on the web, my sense of prom dress seems to be still OK. Compared to what I think prom dresses should be (and the web seems to validate),  this dress doesn't look formal or special enough. The pattern print and the fabric are decidedly too casual and too cheap for prom dresses. Even if it's solid color, the fabric won't be good for prom.<br /><br />For a beach wear,  I'd think it will dry immediately if it gets wet at all. The dress might even repel sand (but not sure). BUT I wouldn't wear it for the beach because I wouldn't like the texture on my skin and the tight waist. I can however imagine young slim teens and twenty-somethings wearing it for vacations at the beach. But then wouldn't they want to be wearing nice swim suits and show off their body than hide it?<br /><br />As a cocktail dress: hmm, I can't wear it to meet business associates or for formal cocktail parties of any kind. I can imagine maybe wearing it for a very informal backyard gathering of old friends... except it's too tight for me around the waist so I'm not going to wear it."
2.0,"The plastic part isn’t stiff enough. It keeps touching my face. Plus the plastic isn’t very clear, so it’s hard to see out of. But I like the hat."
2.0,I love the way these look and feel like solid quality products but after only 90 days of owning them they have broken by the hinges on both sides (I super glued the first break). Super for the price but I don’t think I’ll be buying another pair.
2.0,Fits good but the colors are not accurate rose gold is pink
2.0,[[VIDEOID:c6f5c355af5253f65429142b3953dfc]] The color on the front is faded like I’ve had it for awhile. After wearing it twice the fabric is piling (little balls).<br />It’s super comfortable and fits great and was thinking of ordering another but the fabric is not holding up.
2.0,"These feel like good quality socks, but this pair arrived with a brown spot on one and a hole in the other. I haven’t opened the other pairs so I can return the whole set"
2.0,pants are smaller than what was described
2.0,Size runs small - very much like Asian sizes. Print size is much much smaller then advertised.
2.0,Too small I like big it wasnt a real 3x
2.0,We were unable to use this because it deflated before we got in the pool. We found a hole across the seam
2.0,"If you’re looking for a shirt that looks like a blazer, if you iron it really well and fold the sleeves, this is for you! It’s see through, doesn’t have any shoulder pads; honestly, it doesn’t have any structure at all. And on top of that it has the nerve to be buttonless too. I’m returning it but the 2 stars are for the pattern and the pockets."
2.0,Waaaaay to big more like adult mask!
2.0,"I was looking for an orange shirt for a specific occasion. The shirt arrived on time, ripped open the bag, the shirt was a sort of peach color....one friend said, ""salmon""....certainly no where near orange.<br />Very disappointed. Plus it was a bit tight."
2.0,Very disappointed it is so small. Looks cheap
2.0,"The strap itself is nice, but the cheap bright gold snap attachments (even on a gray strap which makes absolutely no sense) are just ugly. Makes it unusable."
2.0,This hat looks ok but I was thinking all the art work was stitched or sewed on. NOT. Everything you see on hat is printed. Nothing stitched except seams. It looks so so but it would look a lot better stitched. That’s all 🤷‍♂️
2.0,"Seams along zipper ripped open in under a week! Very cute, but poorly made."
2.0,Very pretty but it doesn’t sit in place at all.
2.0,Unfortunately my son misread the dimensions and it was too small for his intended use.
2.0,"Absolutely loved this bag’s size appearance. However, it had an awful odor. I tried everything to get rid of it. I had to return it."
2.0,"If you're 5&#34;4 like me, I suggest you find a little bit shorter earrings than these ones, they are a bit too long for me but may fit others."
2.0,I ordered 6 shrugs altogether all the same size but different colors. 3 fit and 3 were a little too big.
2.0,More like a 2X
2.0,fit well and looked great but one of the grommets on the front came loose the first time I wore the top - I only had it on for a few hours! disappointed in the quality
2.0,"Felt cheap. The bottoms are super tiny and the top is very large! Not adjustable, no padding or support."
2.0,No adhesive was included to attach the picture and the jewel! Very disappointed and now have to figure out something quickly as I needed this ASAP
2.0,The dress arrived with one of the sleeves detached. The arm strap popped within an hour of wearing it. Fortunately bc it fit well to my body I wasn’t worried about it falling off. The fabric has some stretch. It’s a cute but poorly constructed design.
2.0,I bought a few of these in different colors. Not consistent in the sizes.Not all fit the same.<br />The fabric is clingy
2.0,The size is great but the color is a lie. I shows a nice bright shinny gold but it looks very tarnished and very dirty looking. Not worth the money.
2.0,"Nice hat cheap logo it’s an iron on, would’ve been nice if it was embroidered."
2.0,The suit itself is barely acceptable for a single use event. It's thin and the belt is like paper.<br />The beard is COMICALLY and CRIMINALLY bad! It's a fish net abomination with too few hairs (that fall out easily) and the mustache is some sort of hair tube. You can make a more convincing beard yourself by gluing old man pubes to your face.<br />Returning this immediately. Don't waste your money on this cheap cash-grab suit. Be willing to spend more money on something better.
2.0,I ordered an XL because I wanted it to fit like the pic..too tight and short it fit like a med.. not happy
2.0,Not very strong
2.0,It's to small and material is not strechy
2.0,Product was late and torn
2.0,"Pretty, but entirely too small. I ordered a size up from my normal size and the bodice is so tight I can not get my arms thru."
2.0,It was broken almost immediately when I got it. Poor quality.
2.0,"Waistband was way too wide for my taste, looks funny when you try to pair it with a belt. Length was too long, too. The overall effect was more shapeless than I had hoped for - good if you're going for a frumpy-schoolmarm motif, but if you like having a silhouette, buyer beware with this one. Good color, though."
2.0,"If you jog or run, this is not the sports bra for you."
2.0,Not the quality expected
2.0,"I enjoyed this wallet for the first few weeks, until I began finding a sticky residue on all of my cards. It turns out, the material on the inside of the card slots is glued together and after a time of riding in my back pocket, the glue has warmed up and loosened, finding its way onto and destroying a few paper cards I have in my wallet, as well as plastering my driver's license. If you keep this somewhere cool, it's a good purchase. I for one will be switching back to my old wallet until I can find something else."
2.0,"Shirts were very long. I am 5'9"" with a 37/38 in chest. Chest was too large, fit well through the body (30.5"" waist), but the length was much longer than expected. Went well past my crotch, roughly at the top of my upper/mid thighs."
2.0,The product was too small.  I couldn't keep the buttons closed. Also I had to keep grabbing at it toake sure it did not show my vaginal unit if it busted open.  I can not wear as a dress. I would have to wear it as an overlay for an outfit.
2.0,The color is more  of a light (bright) orange than a yellow.  The dress is cute but way too big & is longer than it appears in the photo.  We ordered a small & this fit more like an XL.
2.0,"The good - is they look nice and appear to be made of metal, plus you get more for for your money than other retailers; however, there are more negatives.  This type of chain-strap-shorten-er is a bit flimsy.  There is no locking mechanism to secure in closed position; they open up.  I guess I was expecting a better quality of clip that remains secure.  A safety pin might secure better (haha).  So ladies, carry extra safety-pins in your handbag!  Hope this review was helpful to the ladies still determining to purchase it!"
2.0,"My wife bought this shirt as she loves Schitt's Creek. She was very excited to wear it, but immediately found out that it is men's cut and sizing. She ordered a small expecting it to be a women's small, but it is obviously a men's small. It is very baggy on her and hangs way past her hips. She is a small statured woman, so a men's small does not fit right.<br /><br />She still likes the ""Ew David!"" on it, just not the sizing."
2.0,It was not what I expected.  Wasn't happy with the fabric at all the dress is too pretty to look like t- shirt  fabric
2.0,"This could be a wonderful thing, but it was a disappointment. The artwork is glued on and when a couple of hairs got stuck and pulled, the lettering lifted in danger of breaking!  Cheaply made and I had to glue it all down. Then I noticed all the lettering had been placed crooked upon crafting."
2.0,kinda cheesy
2.0,"omg this was the worst product I have gotten The bag is not even close on how it looks in the pictures, this is horrible and the Kurumi necklace was green not black."
2.0,"They're a good concept, but about 10 didn't work, and of the 30 left, about 20 stopped working very soon after.  I guess it's to be expected with the price, but I was hoping they'd stick around to help my little readers a little bit longer!"
2.0,Not much support so if you're busty pass on this one!
2.0,"Quality is ok, item arrived stained"
2.0,"Eh, worked mediocre. I wouldn't recommend it esp for how long it took to arrive. Not worth the wait."
2.0,I was so optimistic and so very disappointed.  I did not find the glasses reduced glare or halo on clear dark nights nor did they reduce the added glare caused on a rainy dark night.  My biggest problem is the headlights of oncoming traffic.  These glasses did not help in the least.
2.0,"Nice but isn't true to size,  runs small. Ok"
2.0,"The fabric does not hold up well, I wore it once and the wear shoes, disappointed."
2.0,Either the advertising is incorrect or these are mis-marked. My father wears a size 10 shoe and these socks were literally impossible to get on his feet.
2.0,I wanted a more classic sweatshirt weight/material.  This hoodie was nearly see through.  It was closer to a t-shirt material than the expected plush/fleece.  I returned it because it didn’t match my needs.  It fit fine and the color was a nice royal blue.
2.0,The arms are tiny.... very oddly cut
2.0,"These sunglasses are much smaller and narrower than expected.  Additionally, they are extremely tight and press in hard on my temples.  I plan on returning as they hurt too much to actually wear."
2.0,To small and is a XXL😔
2.0,Boots are very nice but when I received them only 1 boot had the belt buckle was disappointed on that boots fit a little bigger.
2.0,"Shirt fits a little too small, quality of the material is not that great either. Color definitely looks better in the photos than the real item."
2.0,it was a great looking necklace but the metal was so soft that it bent and BROKE.
2.0,"BEWARE! Many colors shown are incorrectly labeled! So when your order arrives, you’ll get the wrong one! This happened  to me TWICE on this item. I received the wrong color, returned it & asked for a replacement & it showed up wrong  again! After all that, I didn’t even end up with a dress because they wouldn’t acknowledge the issue or try to resolve it. In looking at the ad again months later, I think almost all of the prints are listed incorrectly. So to guarantee that I get the print I want, I feel like I’d have to buy them all & then return all except the one I actually wanted. Super annoying & a real bummer-I really wanted it. Aside from all that, please note that it does seem to run a little big."
2.0,"When I ordered, the sizing options were based on waist size in inches, not sizes such as M, L, XL, etc. I ordered a size 36 waist, and received a 2 XL pair of trunks (I usually wear an L). Surprisingly, 2 XL wasn't as big as I thought it would be, but still a good bit too large and baggy, so I had to return them. I would have tried to replace them with the correct size, as I love the print and colors and the quality seemed OK, but the very strange branding on the pocket and left leg is huge, obnoxious, and just weird (""TAYLOR PAL LOVE"" ?!?!?). If the seller ever does away with this embarrassing branding, I would definitely reorder these trunks in the correct size and reconsider my rating."
2.0,"dress is okay, but it is a little shear. underwear can be seen.  Got a large as I am rather busty did not fit well. Every bump can be seen. looks nice with a long sweater or a jacket."
2.0,I should have looked to the chart carefully. Too tight!
2.0,Setting the alarm wasn't intuitive and we never did figure out how to do it. The watch face broke the first time my son wore it out hiking.
2.0,Did not like the style on me once I got it on.  The back is rather high and having the ties around the neck would be too irritating for me.<br /><br />Did not like the style once I tried it on.  The back is pretty high and straight across and the ties at the neck would be bothersome for me.  This in addition to the size chart being confusing.<br /><br />the
2.0,Not made for large chested women
2.0,Feels and looks very cheap. Get what you pay for I guess.
2.0,These shoes are significantly smaller than what you would expect.  I'm not sure why the manufacturer can't simply adjust the number to correct the discrepancy.  Either order these several sizes larger than what you need or save your money and look else where.
2.0,"WAAAAAYYYYY to big, I weigh 183 and 5'4 ordered a xl & it looks like im drowning, other than that good material and cute color"
2.0,"Do not like the cut of the top and just didn't like the overall fit around th skirt, it wasn't as pictured on-line. It looks as if hem should be scalloped, but it's not, it's just a straight edge. Not as pretty as in photos."
2.0,"Product is very small. The fabric is good velvet. But I ordered a 4-6 size and I’m 5’4 130lbs, and it was just too small. Also my bottoms butt checks are out. The top is too tight, I’m an a cub and it is still too tight. Wouldn’t recommend it if you can’t get the right size.. but the material is pretty."
2.0,"At first glance, the band is beautiful and very fashionable. However, it did not last long, as the outer straps that were tucked underneath the strings kept falling out. After retucking them every day, they eventually fell off permanently which left the band completely bare as seen in the photo. Additionally, the snaps are not well placed with the first snap being too tight and the second one too loose. An additional snap in between the two would be perfect. Would not purchase again."
2.0,"The dress is cute, but VERY see through. I cannot wear it without leggings. So it will be part of a cute fall outfit instead of a cool summer dress."
2.0,lasted approximately 10 days before the rubber split ?????
2.0,"They fit well and look cute.  They didn’t hurt around the elastic area.  But after the 1st wear through a stream the fabric began to wear and fray away at the toes.  After a few more wears, they look really well worn.  Nevertheless they did work well enough for a week of vacation and she’ll have grown out of them by next summer."
2.0,It’s cute but I don’t think it will last much. Feels like it may fall apart with each use.
2.0,i'd say 90% of my shoes are Jessica Simpson but these were just not right across the board. i bought them before fall so i had them put away and when i finally pulled them out to wear I realized how bad the fit was and it was too late to return
2.0,"this band will soak up water like a sponge and take forever to dry.  unless you have a hair drier or compress air, you will be wearing a soggy towel on your wrist for a few hours."
2.0,"The belt is ok, very nice, except one of the belt's hooks was not attached to the fabric.<br />I was going to return them, but I already used two of them.  To return, I have to return 3 of them since<br />It was set of 3.  So I decided to keep them., too bad."
2.0,"I probably should have seen the quality (or, lack thereof) before I bought them.  With all the pictures I've seen.  I am going to use some of these.  Just, not often.  One thing that I did not notice is the bags are labeled with what Cocoly originally meant for the bags.  I can't take these labels off either.  Anyway, because they are &#34;usable&#34;, and cheap, I left 2 stars."
2.0,worked great for costume
2.0,Seemed like it could possibly be a cute dress if it wasnt so big. I ordered an XL and it was huge. I'M 5'10&#34; and wear a size 12 and was drowning in this.
2.0,One of my ear rings were chipped but
2.0,Received as promised.  Much larger than anticipated.  Cheesy necklace.  Will wait 'til opened at Christmas.  May be returning this one.
2.0,The shirt is more of a tank top than an off the shoulder shirt. I was disappointed since I thought I was getting a completely different style. The material is a good quality. It is a thicker and nicer material than your traditional cotton. I ordered large. The shirt was more snug than most of the large size shirts I order from Amazon. I would recommend ordering a size up. Just know that this will not be an off the shoulder shirt.
2.0,Not a compression tank
2.0,I’m 5’4 - 150lbs ordered a medium. Too small. The arms are way too short. Length of sweater is too short. Fits more like a small. Color was NOT what I ordered. I ordered a sage green and it showed up GREY as grey can be. Fabric is not at all what I expected either. Wouldn’t waste my time on it.
2.0,"Although the dress looks beautiful in the pictures, in order to get the fullness of the skirt, you would need a petticoat underneath. I don’t know what happened with ours but I had to send them back because one of them was covered in fuzz that was very difficult to peel off the tulle. They also came in a very small package and in plastic bags, which caused both dresses to be severely wrinkled (and tulle is ridiculously hard to straighten). It was also a little big. Definitely not what I expected. You literally get what you pay for and a cheap price means cheap quality."
2.0,"If you're looking for a gift for someone under the age of 15 this would be a great gift, but having said that i still do not believe it is worth $28. The watch part of it is decent but the band was truly despicable, it was extremely weak and you actually had to use a bit of force to clip it closed. Unless I had horrible luck The product just wasn't up to par.<br />I personally wouldn't buy this for anyone I know."
2.0,This seemed like a nice bag but it's getting returned. I went to put the water bottle in the side the very first time I used it and the elastic cord on the side water bottle holder broke immediately.
2.0,These are too tight a fit and I need to go up a size. The raised bed makes the toe strap tighter
2.0,They are nice but the sizes arent accurate. They run smaller.
2.0,Not as expected and did not fit as usual La Plume sandals. Arch seems misaligned. Returned and requested refund.
2.0,Very pretty but the stones keep falling out.... N I'm not banging it or rough with it
2.0,Love these but this one was missing the ribbon that ties in the middle.
2.0,Color was not as expected had to return it. Actually dark grey.
2.0,"They r cute for an infant, but not really like a show more of a crib shoe. I had to return them"
2.0,"These are not not mid rise shorts which is what I wanted.  These come all the way up to the waist and then some.  Also, the zipper is very cheap & hard to zip up & down.  Too bad because they are really cute."
2.0,"This dress is huge!! I would highly recommend to size down when possible. The material is ok, it feels fresh for the summer. The materials are just like the price, cheap. It is not a fancy dress but it might look cute when properly combined with accessories."
2.0,"Disappointed! Cute top, but fabric wrinkles can't even iron out.  I washed it and used softener.  Lots of wrinkles that didnt even come out with ironing.  Should have returned it."
2.0,"Nice looking watch. Cant find a way to remove the pins to adjust the band however. There was a small pin that came with it, but it is apparently not strong enough to withstand the force to try removing one of the pins that hold the links.<br /><br />Edit: I was able to remove one link to shorten the band, it required far more effort than should be necessary and removed another due to unintentionally shattering it. The included tool broke under the force required and caused the breakage. Do not use the included pin removal tool. Find something stronger."
2.0,"Really small.<br /><br />If you have a big head, this will look tiny on you. It doesn’t even reach my ears fully."
2.0,"I bought these through Woot! and while the shirts feel and fit great, the build quality is horrible. I have been wearing these for 4 months and they are already falling apart. Wear is what I feel to be normal, no more than 1x a week and weekly washing on the gentle cycle. Yet still the hems and seams are coming apart. I have shirts I have worn for a decade that are holding up better. Definitely NOT worth the money."
2.0,"Not quality, they broke after a month of my husband wearing them (normal wear and tear)."
2.0,"super cheaply made, fits very small, even when using the size guides, go up a size or 2 for sure."
2.0,"This is a lovely watch--very masculine and substantial--but the packaging was scuffed and damaged--the cardboard is actually ripped. I bought it as a gift, and now I cannot give it. Back it goes! Too bad."
2.0,Loved the style  I wear a size 8.5-9 so I ordered the size 8-9 and it was too small. Ordered a different pair from their site in the larger size and that is now too big.
2.0,Extremely small not what I was expecting
2.0,"only gave this 2 stars because i was sent the wrong size. in the first picture the new hoop is on the left (5mm) and the old hoop i was using for my nostril piercing (6mm) is on the right. i ordered a 7mm, BUT, i do really like this jewelry. it’s comfortable and the hinges are smooth & dont knick the inside of your piercing like a cheap one would. if it wasn’t 16 gauge like i had ordered i would have asked for a refund."
2.0,"ordered this bc I needed a new one-it’s so disappointing. brim is way too low so anytime you move your head to see, it hits on the neck. but if you pull lower in the front, completely blocks your vision. I keep trying to position it but can’t seem to find a good place."
2.0,"The dress runs small! I am 5’3 177Lb, normally a size large, but ordered an XL because I didn’t want it to fit too tight and it fit like a Large. The fabric is thick and on the picture it looks thinner, so I will be returning it!  This is my opinion of how it fit me, everyone’s body is different."
2.0,"Ordered the purple, the fabric is rough not smooth like typical satin. I like satin so that you don't get stuck to the sheets, this fabric sticks to the sheets."
2.0,"The previous reviews lead me to believe that this was a good fit, but for someone who has a larger chest, it is not a good fit, it cuts awkwardly and is not flattering."
2.0,Super cute but the baby part fell off after a few weeks
2.0,"Be aware that the material is similar to that of a childrens blow up play pool and it smells just like it too. I had been looking for a summer bag for awhile and was looking forward to this one. I opened the package and smell wafted out of the box of a cheap play pool and felt the flimsy vinyl, I knew it wouldnt work. The price and quality do not correspond, if it were closer to $14.99.. maybe, but definitely not $57. I tried to like it, but back it goes, the &#34;material&#34; quality and price point are questionable."
2.0,"It's really thin and very short in the back. It looks and feels odd to wear. It is already in the give away pile, I will never wear it."
2.0,"2 stars since the neck is too deep. Ordered it for Easter but will not work for church. Also, due to pleats. Looks too fattening on waist and hips. Was little snug at chest"
2.0,It's a nice dress but it did not have a hidden zipper.  With that said order size larger...It helps when putting it on.  I would not order this dress again and it did not fit as expected.
2.0,Small and not the best quality. I would not re-order
2.0,These are TINY! Not for adults. Bummer.
2.0,Lace tears too easily. I hand washed and air dried it and it still tore.
2.0,I like the concept however it does not fit as desribed. There is no support at all and they fit larger than normal.size.
2.0,"I looked at reviews of this item before purchasing as I needed one for skiing - the many ways that this buff could be used is what it originally attracted me to it. When I received it in the mail, it wasn't quite like I expected. It was really small and edges were not hemmed. The fleece part was okay, but the patterned fabric was extremely thin. I tried making the different types of hats/face covers according to the pictures and diagram card that was sent with it, but the fabric was just too tight and did not sit flat against my head. Maybe the fabric would stretch out, but even just around my neck it was choking me. Unless you have small head and don't plan on being anywhere colder than 40 F, then maybe look elsewhere.<br /><br />I did return this item to the company at no cost to myself and they were prompt in their refund...so thumbs up to customer service."
2.0,"Costume feeling fabric..I wouldn’t wear this to bed. and bad sizing, too small."
2.0,Got these for Christmas. They were too small. In my opinion they were too masculine looking despite the glitter. I sent them back.
2.0,The purse was sent as a birthday present and it arrived with cosmetic flaws and one of the decorative rings was tearing off. Dissapointed.
2.0,"It is a nice looking shoe, but not very durable.  The sole came apart within a month of daily wear."
2.0,"It’s comfortable and cute, but it’s not “high impact” support by any means.  I would not be able to wear it for strenuous activity and expect my breasts to stay in place.  I wear a size 38 DDD and have tried just about every type of sports bra ever and have yet to find anything that performs even close to Sportjock.  They’re expensive, and I’ve wasted hundreds if not thousands of dollars in trying to not spend $75 on this one piece of tight elastic.  This one is no miracle, but at least it’s more comfortable than the ones with hooks, straps, and underwire that aren’t supportive either."
2.0,"Short, tight ankles.. linen/canvas-like material. Weird pockets. The waist is nice, but ultimately, had to return."
2.0,Cute dress but be careful it slides all the way up.
2.0,earrings DO NOT STAY IN PLACE!!!
2.0,"Super thin fabric, shows all the things. Cute style, and fit, but . . . all the things."
2.0,Battery life has been low
2.0,"This is an imitation of a famous Edith Head dress. The photo of the dress is nice. The actual fabric of the dress is dyed sloppily, it looks like I accidentally spilled a blue icey down the front of the dress. PLEASE try to actually dye the fabric the way it is portrayed in the photo. Thank you."
2.0,Caused a piercing that is over 2 years old to get infected. DO NOT BUY!
2.0,"I typically wear a size 16 or XL in stretchy pants. This is labeled a 18W (typically larger than regular 18 in stores) and fits much smaller than that. The bottoms cut into me and were not as high waisted as shown on the model. Definitely were not near where my waist goes in, rather, fit at the largest part of my &#34;belly area.&#34; The top was also too small in the cups, unfortunately. That was expected, and I would've kept the suit had the bottoms fit nonetheless. Sad, but to be expected as all swimwear fits differently."
2.0,Product description says “2-pack” but it’s really just a 1-pack. Don’t fall for their tricks. Quality is good and it fits great. But it’s not a 2-pack like the description indicates
2.0,one suitcase was use
2.0,I love the sweater but the neck opening is way to large 🙁
2.0,It’s didn’t come with anything but the cloth
2.0,Me quedo muy chico
2.0,"Ok, so first I will say I LOVE this bag, it's perfect, except that after carrying it for 2 weeks the stitching is coming out. I do not carry a lot of items so there is not extra weight, just very poor stitching.  Now it's just another bag in my closet. Sad."
2.0,Item is not what expected.  Tangles easily.  Looks cheap.
2.0,They’re pretty but flimsy. After putting them in and removing them (before bed) a handful of times they eventually break because they bend every time you move.
2.0,"I got these to wear under skirts, and the length is such that they look really stupid. Especially in the bright colors. It's a look that would do well in the early 90's, but not today. They are also much hotter than I expected. They are impractical, because any time that it's cold enough that these would be comfortable I'd just wear regular-length leggings. Not for me."
2.0,"Not wool! It arrived with the tag cut off, and it’s def acrylic! I’m a knitter and know my yarns, but for 8.99 I’ll keep it. Quality is just meh! Save your money!"
2.0,I’d get a size up so your crotch feels better bois otherwise if you don’t you’ll be having to pick a leg to hang down if ya catch my drift😂💯
2.0,"Loved the look of the necklace. But it turned color fast, and one broke shortly after receiving. :("
2.0,"Nice looking sunglasses, nice viewing through them. The lens popped out with minimal touching when I cleaned them though. Difficult to get the lens to go back in, but it will."
2.0,Disappointed....yes the material was soft but doesn't give enough support.  The worst complalnt would be that the hooks which are on the outside of the bra scratch the skin when it folds underneath my bra line.  Not what I hoped<br />...
2.0,"I was looking for light, house shorts, due to the hot weather. Do not attempt any squatting (pets?} or you'll split. Do not attempt anything other than walking. Horrible design. Nonreturnable. No movement allowed...."
2.0,"This is the second pair I’ve ordered. The first pair was too large, but came complete with arch support inserts. This pair, thought they fit better appear to be someone else’s returns. There was only one (left) spacer (green) and not the other spacer options.  They even smelled as if worn by someone else!<br />Very disappointed at your Quality control."
2.0,2 were broken upon arrival but still cute. They do turn colors after a while though.
2.0,I bought this shirt for my wife.  She wears a small to medium.  I purchased the medium and it is like a small or x-small.  Returned product.
2.0,"It is see through, fits very loosely<br />I don't like that<br />It looks very pretty that's why I'm adding another star"
2.0,"This set is lovely.  I had a set that lasted nearly a year, but since then, I have purchased two more sets in the span of about 6 months, because the small pave set stones fall out easily.  I probably won't purchase another set."
2.0,"I bought three of these. I bought black, green, and teal.<br /><br />First, order at least one size down. These dresses are huge.<br /><br />They're not spaghetti strap. They straps are actually incredibly thick and the v-neck sits up much higher than picture. The armpit area in all three dresses was cut uncomfortably high. It came close, but it was not the dress in the pictures. The green dress was much lighter than the picture.<br /><br />These dresses are super, super heavy and they stretch out throughout the day. I wore the black one once. By the end of the day, it had stretched about 12 inches longer than it had been originally."
2.0,these are the tiniest tounge rings I've ever seen. they looked much bigger in the picture. I wanted to order a 16g short bar tounge ring with normal balls on the ends. these can literally be tounge rings for a infants first tounge ring. I can't believe these costed as much as the regular ones. I'm so upset
2.0,Not right for me - inferior quality<br />I ordered and loved a KC crossover and it was 5*<br />Not this bad<br />Very disappointed - returned
2.0,"This was a birthday gift for my 9 year old who is really into lanky box. It came two days late (from the latest delivery date) which I’m usually not picky about, but it was a gift so that kind of sucked.<br />The quality is poor. It’s more of a polyester cheap material with blurry print lines. It definitely was not worth the $ in my opinion."
2.0,I've used the back maybe a half dozen times and one of the zipper tabs on the main compartment zipper assembly has broken off.  This makes zipping the bag far less convenient and keeps me from recommending it.
2.0,"I've bought this band many times over the years from various sellers. Usually when I try to reorder, the product/seller is no longer available so I just pick another seller. I love the look, but this one snags material."
2.0,Comfortable easy to install breaks Easy
2.0,Smells horrible out of package
2.0,"Zipper broke after only a few months, I like the size and organization other than that"
2.0,Size is to small compared with same size same brand
2.0,Just my opinion but i didnt like one thing about them. The sizing was completely off for me. And the material was just not for me. Very cute color but just not my style
2.0,"They are made of crinkly cotton. If that's what you want, they're fine. But I was looking for linen pants, which is how they were described."
2.0,The jacket is a nice material and color but it fits at least 2-3 sizes small. I am usually a size 10-12 and saw the reviews saying to size up so i ordered a 14 and it still was way too small.
2.0,"I buy a lot of stuff on Amazon and this is the worst purchase I have made yet! These are terrible! The feel of the fabric on your skin is chilling, not to mention the sound when you put them on. Like nails on a chalk board! The fabric reminds me of a neoprene sweatsuit. Also, when I went to try them on, they felt really loose and baggy in the legs, especially at the knees. They bunch strangely in the crotch. They are unnaturally shiny. The seem in the butt broke immediately when I pulled them up. Needless to say...they are going back. Don’t waste your money! Expected more for the price range."
2.0,"The ring in the picture that holds the guitar charm is missing, so the charm is attached right to the rope.  The result is that the charm does not lay down as it look in the picture.  No way to add my own because I would have to cut the bracelet to get the charm off.  Guess they saved the 3 cents it would have cost them to actually have that piece."
2.0,Wish they were smaller. Nice quality.
2.0,Didn't look right in person. Also felt slightly cheap.
2.0,"These were soft and pretty comfortable. I was excited at first, but within a day the first layer started rubbing off. Rub up against anything and these will be quickly destroyed. This happened especially around my ankles from my boots and on top of my thighs from my coat. They're fine for around the house, but useless to wear out."
2.0,Not worth $13 . easily scratches up. Son loves it because he's a fan but definitely would not buy this again
2.0,The description shows two pairs of earrings. Only includes 1 pair of gold. No option for silver.
2.0,Very small.  Xl fits like size small.
2.0,stitching came undone immediately at the bodice
2.0,"I really wanted to like this but the colors are way off, and I was expecting a cotton blend.  This is in a shiny negligee like fabric and the colors are much more vibrant/brighter/bold then the soft blues in their display photo. I ordered a small, I usually wear 4/6 and this was too short and fit more like a top then a dress.  The seller would not let me refund/return this item without providing a photo.  Well there's no option to attach a photo in the return/refund section that I could see. So, I guess it'll go in the donation pile.  I gave it two stars because the quality is nice, just wish it was in the right color hues."
2.0,These are just regular bandanas. I was expecting them to be stretchy like the others. I did put them to use as head scarves for some young people.
2.0,"After dry cleaned, no longer fits at top."
2.0,Broke after 3 weeks of wearing it off and on.
2.0,Wasn’t a fan of the material or the fit.
2.0,Too small make sure order 2 to 3 sizes up.
2.0,Color fading
2.0,They're cute but in the long run the color fades and it made the side of my face where my vertical tragus is swollen.
2.0,I know they were cheap...but these were really cheap and really sized for a child.
2.0,The sizing is not US sizes. Size chart had to be up dated.
2.0,I loved the look of this earring but it was way too small for a rook piercing and it was tight in my ear causing the tips of the flower to push up against my cartilage. It was cute for a couple of days but can’t wear it much longer than that.
2.0,"The comb on my veil came broke. It's a very flimsy, cheap comb. The seller gave me 50% credit back. It's a $12 veil, no high expectations!"
2.0,"Can't really ware a bra, straps are shown clearly."
2.0,I own another pair of boots by this same brand love them. So comfortable. These ones not so much. Very uncomfortable and did not fit. Sent them back.
2.0,Size chart and shoe not the same.
2.0,The crotch is weirdly placed. No give in the hip region.
2.0,"As I expected because of the price, this dress did not fit well. It's material clings to the body and does not give you a smooth shape. Even underwear showed through because it clung to the edges of it. The cut is also WAY too high. The picture does show this, but it is almost impossible to walk around in this dress without it automatically rising up and revealing your underwear.<br /><br />This would really only look good on certain body types."
2.0,These are light weight and while the style is nice they are flimsy.  Think gas station $5 beach glasses so definitely over priced for what you get.  I am very gentle with them as they feel like the lens is going to pop out continually.
2.0,"Normally a medium fits fine but I like my sweats baggy so I sized up.  This morning with nothing clean and having to get my dog to the vet, I reached for these. TIGHT!  I thought, oh well, it will have to work. Got in the car and realized a small tear on the outer part of the right leg. WTH?  While waiting for the vet I came to my app and hit return. Of course, by the time I got home I was covered in dog hair. So I won’t be returning them. I might as well have flushed the money down the toilet.  I’m really disappointed."
2.0,"Paper thin, went see through  after one wash. Dont waste your money."
2.0,Bows don't stay on to well
2.0,"The solid fabric and striped fabric are not the same material.  The two materials did not fit well together.  The shirt had an error as well pictured below. The stripes were not straight, again see picture."
2.0,Nice looking boot but they caused major blistering continually and tears in socks. Returning them so that my poor husband's feet can heal.
2.0,Not as pictured the arm pits are large and boxy and the rest is small. Not near as bright and colorful either. Material is not sweatshirt material
2.0,"I give this product 2 stars because it was just not what I expected. It fits a little bit big and while the shoe has a nice sturdy bottom like I wanted and thought it had, they lean to the outwards & inwards when my son walked in them. My son doesn't have bad feet but while training your toddlers feet in shoes this isn't the one. It's warm while fashionable for a boy it just isn't the right fit."
2.0,The material is cheap and the shirt is way too long. Disappointed.
2.0,"First day was awesome, but after I washed them they won't stay up. 😑"
2.0,Overall feel is good... until you walk in them. The strap that goes over the foot doesnt have enough room for toes and just rubbed my feet raw from walking. Im currently trying to stretch the opening but dont know if its working.
2.0,It was way to long....
2.0,"Does not move with your mouth. Fun concept, but it doesn’t work."
2.0,One shirt in package was size large that I ordered other shirt in package was a small.
2.0,Wrinkled and unraveling at the seams.
2.0,"I went by their size chart and these came in way too tight.  I suggest sizing up. Wouldve been cute, seems like a good material... but fit was uncomfortable and black sections stretched out to much."
2.0,The part that circles the thigh was too tight. Had to send back. Can’t tell if it was me or the underwear.
2.0,Very thin plastic that doesn't look like will hold up to baggage handlers.  I'm sure it would crack open if put in checked luggage.  Cheaply made.
2.0,"Words are too big, so no one can tell what it says and is too loose to wear as a gaiter (I am a 5'10"" woman, with a narrow face--medium sized masks usually fit me or are a little too short)"
2.0,Just an fyi the product looks nice but runs large I am 5 4 and 135 poundsand it fit like a moo moo.
2.0,"I bought these hoping to use as gym shorts, but they're kind of funny-looking and oddly-constructed. They're quite baggy in the crotch (which I now realize others have pointed out) and they have strange sideways pockets with clunky zippers. Quality seems pretty good for the price, but they're just not very comfortable or good-looking. They'll do for wearing around the house, but I probably wouldn't ever wear them in public."
2.0,"This is a bit too small, and tends to slide off your face. I'd recommend going for a solid head/neck cover instead."
2.0,The elastic waist was directly below my chest. Looked super odd.
2.0,"The sleeves are ridiculous too small compared to the rest of the shirt. I like the shirt, but I am going to have to return it. Thank you."
2.0,"I needed it, so I started wearing it.  I hope will shrink when it is washed. wish me good luck."
2.0,"Compass never worked, broken when I got it. The cover over the watch cracked the first time I leaned on it. Its on a belt loop though, its going to get leaned on."
2.0,"Seemed like nice little boots for going down to the garden, but bought an 11 and they were too small."
2.0,"Super small!! I read the reviews so I bought a Large when I'm usually a Medium. I would estimate I need an XL or a XXL!! I love it otherwise, but I feel like it isn't worth the hassle of ordering yet another. Bummed."
2.0,"These shoes are way too small.  They come in European size although that was not clear when ordering.  I ordered a 13 and it came listed as a 46, but it is more of a size 12 at best and more like an 11.5.  If the company is reading this comment and wants to send me a size 14 or 48 I suppose then I'll try them, but I was severely disappointed that I can't wear them.  I had hoped to use them for hiking and long walks including when it rained.  I gave it a second star since I sprayed them with water to test that claim and the inside remained dry."
2.0,Cheap material... Didn't really like it.
2.0,"After wearing these about 10 times, the string around the waist broke. I have another pair of scrubs with the exact same style but made by Dickies, and they are much better quality. I've had them for a year, wear them twice a week, and I've never had any issues."
2.0,"These seemed fine when I got them, kind of cute and the type of socks I was looking for.  When I washed them though I found that they shrunk a LOT.  I have small feet but, really, this is ridiculous!  I'm adding two pictures so you can see, the blue sock is the one I washed, the white one hasn't been worn yet, both from the same package."
2.0,I was under the assumption that these earrings were a tad bigger. A bit disappointing for 27.00 dollars!
2.0,Only 8 one inch clasps and one another size.
2.0,"This watch is attractive and I previously gave it a good review, but after wearing it twice I find that the clasp does not stay hooked. It just falls of the wrist. I will be returning this."
2.0,Pretty but turned my neck green lol
2.0,Cute earings but cheaply made. Fronts fall off posts.
2.0,I should have ordered the grey...
2.0,The quality is good and overall everything looks great but the lettering isn't in cursive...it's just plain block writing.
2.0,"Unfortunately the dress was very see-through. Could be used as a swimsuit cover-up, but not a dress."
2.0,"I ordered these because I tried to get the same ones I ordered last year and those were ""lost in the mail"" and never showed up. These are OK for costume dress-up teen or children, so, for my purposes, they are OK. I just caution you to not expect much more than that. A few of the bracelets are actually fairly small and would be too tight on many adult women."
2.0,Extremely light and flimsy feels almost like little kids starter scissors. I have them just for decoration now since the handle feels like it will break.
2.0,"Kind of sad to be giving a bad review but my letter necklace did not match the description. The letter is black which gives it a completely different style. I decided not to return because the other necklaces I like a lot, they all come as separate necklaces and they are really good quality, we will see how they age."
2.0,Material is skin tight and very thin. It wasn’t flattering at all.
2.0,Dress was very cheaply made and thin material. Will be returning.
2.0,"It looks alright, but it’s way too huge even on the smallest setting. It also comes with a bunch of creases in it, so it’s not really possible to wear it without looking strange."
2.0,The Collar was all messed up... otherwise this would have been a keeper...
2.0,Pros: This came in a massive nicely displayed box. It came in time also. For that it gets 2 stars. Now the cons: this was advertised as a CHOKER!!! See pic not anything close to a CHOKER! This necklace is massive and bulky not dainty and small as one would expect as again it's advertised as a choker! Sometimes less is really more! Gaudy not wearable art fair looking product! If my 9 year old doesn't want it will try to send back. Pic shows it worn with a dangle choker to show just how off this description is!
2.0,The color was brighter than pictured. It was also way smaller than I expected. I went up a size too.
2.0,This bag is very attractive on other people so I thought I'd try it.  It is very sloughy and does not hold it's shape.  It is a little small and I could not get comfortable with it.  It is a lightweight nylon which is nice.  For the price I wanted to love it and I didn't so I returned it.
2.0,I sized up following user recommendations but they were still too small. Consider sizing up even more. I had to pay for the return which I understand BUT THE COMPANY SHOULD CHANGE THEIR SIZING CHART on the feedback they've received about this issue.
2.0,"I bought the XL after reading the reviews. I don't know how anyone thinks the XL fits size 14 to 16. It barely fit across my shoulders. Granted, I'm athletic and I work out, but it doesn't even fit my arms and shoulders. Sure, the sleeves are loose, but at the armpit they are ridiculously tight. There is no gusseting or give where the sleeve attachment is. it flares out from the armpit but cuts off all the circulation at the armpit. It is 17 in across at the chest. Also from shoulder point to your armpit is 9 inches. The only thing that is XL on this dress is the skirt portion. It is going back today."
2.0,"I really liked this shirt except it was soooo big so I had to return it. I ordered a size medium and it fit like a large.  For reference, I'm 5'6"" and 150lbs and I could have definitely bought a small.<br /><br />Otherwise would have been a cute shirt. The colors were cute and the material is that stretchy soft material."
2.0,I bought this dress for work but it is more see-through than I would like to wear in a professional environment. I would size down because it is a little big. It's not as shape-fitting as it displays in the picture. Probably would not buy again.
2.0,Ball fell out not even a week after I put it in
2.0,These are horrible if your thighs touch in the middle because the fabric is so cheap that it makes the most ear cringing sound when walking. Reminds me early 90's wind suit sound.
2.0,the material is like ruber
2.0,Legs too big
2.0,"Was no where near what I was expecting. Cheaply made. Hinges on the top about broke when I tried to open the locket for the first time. Urn isn't even held in on the inside. The minute I opened it, the urn fell out. Not pleased at all."
2.0,Looked more like a night gown than a dress
2.0,"By somewhat large I mean the length. Its way too long for my 5'4&#34; frame. The material is thin and light weight. It feels like it will rip with too much movement. It has a nice amount of pockets, but the color is way brighter than pictured. Not a fan and I have only worn them once. More than likely will give them away."
2.0,Waistband is too soft and doesn’t hold up the pants- also on the short side- I’m 5.7 and it barely covers my ankles
2.0,"Not recommended! These are comfortable enough, but they arrived with a strange plasticky odor that persisted through many wash cycles over several months, before mostly fading."
2.0,"This ""t-shirt"" is actually an extremely thick jersey fabric, stiff as if it were ironed with starch.  The design is only on the front, and is just a cheap rubbery screen-print.  BUT, the weirdest thing of all, is that the cut of the t-shirt in the front dips down about a foot from the cut in the back.  I held it up and my husband couldn't stop laughing, saying it looked exactly like a baby onesie.  He was right!  There is no better way to describe it - a light blue starred baby onesie with space for your diaper to fit."
2.0,"I've had this for 2 months and it is NOT holding up well. I've gone on two trips in the past two months and wore this for about 2 whole days cumulatively. The side of the bigger pocket is completely ripped open. I mostly sat in cars/planes while wearing it, so this wasn't put through any grueling activity. It held my passport, money, and plane tickets. Seriously, it should be in near excellent condition right now."
2.0,"I scoured the Internet for the best value hiking backpack with the largest capacity and ended up narrowing it down to this product.  There are three major issues with this backpack.<br /><br />First, the size of water resistant fly that’s built into the top of the pack is inadequate.  Using the rain fly with the pack unfilled is the perfect size, however as soon as you add materials in the bag the rain fly will not reach the bottom of the pack.  Terrible construction planning.<br /><br />Second, this backpack is capped off with a flap and plastic buckle closures.  Underneath is a drawstring construction that closes the main compartment.  This pack does not include any strings to actually close it (or at least mine didn’t). I had to use my own paracord and fish it through the openings. There are two levels of drawstring piping built in, so I had to do this two times. Additionally, I had to stitch the openings of the built in piping to re-enforce it. The original stitching was visibly clearly not strong enough.<br /><br />Third, After putting materials inside the pack the exterior sides of the straps at the top of the shoulder pads needed to be reinforced as the stitching started to slightly become loose. I used heavy duty nylon thread. Easy fix and made it very strong.<br /><br /> I consider myself a handyman, so making these additional stitches and adding paracord was not a big deal for me, however I could see where this might be a dealbreaker for some.  As for the rain fly, I could still potentially use it for about 70% coverage for the top of the pack, however I will probably need to find an alternative material or buy a new size rain fly.<br /><br />Overall, aside from fixes, the durability of this pack and fabric is pretty good. Considering this bag is $90 for 100 L and contains several compartments, heavy nylon straps for add-ons and metal support frame ... it’s an okay deal. I emailed customer service to request a partial refund for materials not included and defectiveness. So far they responded with asking for photos and have not acted on my partial refund request. Update: Customer service stopped responding and have not reimbursed me for any portion of the cost!"
2.0,The pants fit really awkward. I love the style of the 2 piece and the mock neck. Maybe I just got a bad set.
2.0,"It fits true to size, but the dress I got does not look like the photo. It's light blue, but the floral is different and the fabric is shiny and stiff, not soft (the tag says 95% polyester 5% spandex). The bottom hem is also straight, not curved like in the photo. Will be returning."
2.0,"The strands are rather heavy and no very soft. Moreover, the fabric strands pulls very easily out of the plastic fittings, which they are not supposed to do. I won't buy these again."
2.0,"I bought this swimsuit set for my upcoming beach vacation. I am 5'10&#34;, 145 lbs, 34DDD and typically wear 4/6 size or size small to medium. I ordered this product in size large. The top, was popping out and doesn't fit right,  the bottoms that are just underwear style was slightly big and the skirt turned out to have shorts like for biking underneath. The skirt design was very cute but felt very uncomfortable.  I honestly can't imagine swimming in that nor walking around a beach. The design is cute with an exception to the shorts but the sizing is major off. I can't say I'd recommend this product to my friends. I wanted to return this item that is useless in my closet but it will cost me more to send it back internationally than getting my refund. Waste of money!<br /><br />I received this product with a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
2.0,"I ordered 3 of these and within less than 24hrs two out of the three broke off from the keychain. This item is cheaply made and not worth the amount sold for, which is a shame because if made better I would of liked it."
2.0,While the card pockets are adequately sized the insert leaf is very fragile and it detached from the main body within a week of use.
2.0,I've been enjoying polarized lenses for crisper images and adequate sun shading. These unfortunately were not as expected. Yes they're cute buuuuut the lenses are just a pale pink tint to it and doesn't do much for shading. I feel like the sun seems more intense with the rose color coming through than let's say a brown or gray tinted lens. Would not buy again unless they change their lenses.
2.0,It was too small for my hand. But I am on the larger side
2.0,"I ordered these pants earlier this week and when I went to order, according to the size chart, I really needed a small and all they had available in all of the inseams was XS, M, L, and XL. I wanted a pair of black studio pants and didn't want to pay the $118 price tag for lululemon so I ordered the Medium and hoped they would fit. They came in yesterday and the Medium is simply too big. To the point where they're not flattering. I'm going to have to return these. I did order the Small (which is available) directly from the yogipace website but they're about $3 more expensive and I'm having to pay an extra $8 in shipping just to get a size that fits. To Yogipace: Please update your Amazon inventory to include Smalls for others. Other than that I can tell I'm really going to like these pants!"
2.0,"Ugh...I am 5'2&#34; and weigh 220.  I normally wear a 1X in clothes, or a 22.  According to their size chart I am a 4X.  So I ordered them in size 4X...both me and my hubby could have fit into them, and they are SUPER long...like 12 inches too long.  But I can hem, so thought that was ok.  So I returned them and ordered 3X...still WAAAY too big!  Now I'd like to order my &#34;normal&#34; 1X, but they are out of stock.  :(  They seem like nice sweat pants though...good weight.  But the size charts are totally wrong."
2.0,too small - maybe good for a teen
2.0,Order large shirt says large but feels medium size too small for a largeorder xxl maybe fits large
2.0,These sizes are NOT accurate. I ordered large and it wasn't even close to big enough.  Maybe a large child?
2.0,"material on this is weird, would not recommend. print is also pixelated, dress looks cheap. returned."
2.0,It has this line in the front that gives u a camel toe!!!
2.0,These are super cute but not durable.  I<br />Don't like the inexpensive material they are made of.  There is no flexibility to them over my glasses and that makes for a not so great overall fit and level<br />Of comfort  I received these in a timely manor and they were shipped right away and packaged well
2.0,"Way small, and the skirt isn't as full as the picture. I'm 5'10&#34;, and a size 14 and purchased a 3x. It's really snug in the boob area."
2.0,Fits small and the fabric was super stuff and itchy
2.0,Not to bad but kinda cheep looking. Bought something else to give to my mom.
2.0,"Update after using. Super disappointed. Because the internal layer isn’t cotton it’s super hard to breathe. It gets hot and humid inside the mask. It’s so much thinner than my other masks, but they’re 100% cotton and valve makes a huge difference. The valve on my other masks are a lot closer to my nose and mouth. This one sits on my cheek and it didn’t feel like it was helping at all. Man what a bummer. It fits my face better but doesn’t work.<br /><br />Hmmm I’m torn on this one. I have other masks that look like these but they’re thicker and 100% cotton, which I like. These are not the same BUT they’re bigger, which I like because the ones I have fit but they feel small to me. However these are a lot thinner, they’re single layer cotton outside, with a second layer for the pocket that is not cotton. They do have the valve and fit the filters, but it concerns me that they’re thinner. I may double up on the filter. I’ll probably keep them for the fit. They also smell funny, even after washing. These will not fit a kids face, the other ones I have fit my son perfectly, he 11 but over 5ft."
2.0,I do not recommend. Silver foam and creams work MUCH better than this polishing cloth.
2.0,The socks fit fine however they are extremely itchy even after washing. Not sure if they should be broken in but I couldn't wear them longer then 10 minutes.
2.0,Loved this dress before I washed it. I hand washed in cold water and line dried and it shrunk quite a bit. The cute flutter sleeve even shrunk so not as cute anymore. Just be forewarned! I am so disapponted bc I LOVED the fit of this dress before it needed to be washed. Not worth the price for sure !
2.0,The sweater was not as pictured. It was not as large and the sleeves were not long at all.
2.0,Not so perfect. This wallets button rivet ruined my credit cards chip. Im hoping with a little tape on the inside over the rivet will keep from destroying any of my other credit cards chip. They need to fix this.<br /><br /> I should not have to worry on how i place my cards in this wallet especially how much this wallet cost me.
2.0,Fabric soft design horrible
2.0,"I liked the non-slip bottoms, but all the toes seemed to be about the same size.  For me, the two small toe sections were incredibly long.  That made them not fit as well as I would've liked."
2.0,Cheap... flimsy material.  Cute pattern on a poorly made suit.
2.0,I am tall so it was not long enough
2.0,These shoes run small. Best to go up a half size
2.0,The pro is that you get what you pay for.... The con is about the same. The different adornments are all made of very cheap plastic. So far I am 10 for 10 on the balls breaking in half the 2nd time I try to use them.
2.0,images are indistinct.  Overall a cheap piece of junk.
2.0,"Sent me the wrong color two times!! Not sure what to do at this point, afraid that they’ll send me another black set instead of the brick red I originally ordered (twice). Won’t even let me replace the item, only return for a refund. It looks nice and fits fine but this is ridiculous."
2.0,setting is very small and boring.
2.0,"If you are in the military i would advise against buying this, while it is a great jacket it does not comply with ar 670-1 as it has camogrom printed throughout the camo, not sure why that wasnt in the description just be warned dont waste your money on something you cant wear."
2.0,Returned it... looked like I was wearing a big bag.
2.0,They aren’t very durable for children. Poor quality.
2.0,"did not like the fit, sent the product back"
2.0,"Que no venia la coronó, cuando yo ise el pedido decía que con corona y a la hora de recibir  el producto solo viene el vestido."
2.0,Didn't like the material. Returned it.  Plus the fit was a bit tight.
2.0,"This stone is lavender, not purple, and the stone had abrasions on top. I sent it back."
2.0,"I’m 5’5, 120 lbs usually a size 0-2. The material doesn’t appear to be the same as advertised, the sewing of the front part of the shorts has the seam so long at the front of the crotch it looks ridiculous. The material was very heavy and kept falling off of me. I felt like I was wearing a hospital scrubs. Not cute jumper.  So disappointed and sad."
2.0,These were too small. A key is larger than the keychain. Will only hold one key. See pic.
2.0,"Meh 🤷 overall. Runs large, I'm 5'7 and 145lb and a medium hung on me. Returned it"
2.0,"Not even a month went by before the “jewel” fell out. It is genuine sterling silver, and my skin had no problems with them. They were also the perfect size for my extra holes in my ear."
2.0,"I love the feel and look of these jeans, and would not hesitate to purchase more had it not been for the issue of the stitching coming apart at the pockets, fly/zipper area and belt loops. The issue surfaced after about the third washing."
2.0,Cheap but cute scared to ever wash it because of how cheap it is
2.0,Tail was fine but ears had very little hair and really cheaply made. Ended up buying her other ears.
2.0,"Cute but feels cheap, the shorts are way too short…."
2.0,So bought  these as a gift. Broke not even an hr on. They are cool charms. If u need it for extra charms handle. But if u tryna buy it as a gift 1 piece. Then don't.
2.0,Not breathable at all
2.0,I gave this dress away to a friend because it runs very very small. It is pretty though.
2.0,"They were squished when arrived and just didn't fit right. Also not really ""fashionable "" for boys... my son (8yrs old) said ""these are ugly and squished"", ""I can't wear them except for play shoes, maybe ""."
2.0,"While I did love how small this scapular was, one of the felts came off the second time I wore it.  I'm not overly hard on jewelry; I think it was just not sturdy."
2.0,It is hard to put it on also not stable in the wrist of you hook a bit big watch
2.0,This is a child’s or women’s size watch.  Not a Men’s size.  The band is too small and the face is very small and I’m not a big guy. At all.
2.0,Will brake in minutes. Not worth it
2.0,"these are really cute, sole is comfortable, however the strap part is a bit snug<br />and I don't have a wide foot. they should consider putting a piece if elastic<br />at the bottom of the strap so it moves with you when walking, they should<br />consider doing that with other styles as well . I find their shoes tend to hurt<br />all due to lack of having a piece of elastic, so that when you walk the strap<br />moves with your foot, rather than not , and cutting it. I can wear to the store and back<br />cant wear for walking all over a mall. just cut the tops of my feet"
2.0,"High waisted, go up a size."
2.0,Disliked it because the stripes looked to big and it resembled jail/prison suit. From the top up.
2.0,"Not very impressed with the fabric, very thin and the size runs pretty small.  Actually, they are really ugly!"
2.0,not very good quality at all. broke the first time I wore it.
2.0,Cute set but runs small. Padded sports bra doesn't have openings to remove padding so it just looks awkward if you are full chested. Nice stretch on the set but sizing may be misrepresented.
2.0,"Cute picture, big enough to fit a horses muzzle. Wouldn't recommend unless you're  a good seamstress to fix the fit."
2.0,"I returned the pants as they were the wrong color, and the draw string did not match the pants (it was a white shoe string type).  Also I didn't like that they were so very long and the ankle cuff was so wide.  Just didn't look like the picture. But they were made of good quality material."
2.0,"I love the fit. I had same issue with a pair of red shorts too. Not sure why it pills so easy, but make the shorts look horrible."
2.0,Fits more like a xl instead of a 3x 😬
2.0,"The colour was more peachy than I could handle. I thought it would be more pink and less bridesmaid peach. It was also baggy in the sleeves and frumpy in the waist. I loved the length, being tall myself, but found that the fit was unflattering for my slim frame."
2.0,Too big for my bracelet.  Does not &#34;stop&#34; other charms
2.0,"This was a personal purchase, if it had been a gift I would return it."
2.0,The dress is very nice but too small compared to normal size. I can’t fit in! 😩
2.0,"Very cute and comfy, but they fell apart after wearing them only two times. The company was very receptive to my request to return them, and offered to send me a new pair for free, but I decided to try a different brand."
2.0,band had NO give or stretch great support
2.0,It's pretty when you first open it but the bigger jewel discolors after a bit.
2.0,"Too tight in the waist, too baggage in the leg."
2.0,Ordered XL and the tag in the shirt says XL. This thing would be tight on a doll. Took about a month to arrive. It appears they put an XL tag in a small shirt. Very disappointing. It will not fit the person I bought it for.
2.0,The piece that connects the band to the watch broke after only a few wearings.
2.0,Flimsy quality and broke on the third wear
2.0,I fixed it but cheaply made.
2.0,weak material not recommended
2.0,"I purchased these for my husband, and the size L was TINY. I ended up keeping them for myself...no matter what the listing says, they sure act like ladies leggings :)"
2.0,waistband is NOT as described
2.0,"It has a cell phone holder than didn't fit my Samsung Galaxy. Other than that, it seemed like a useful, compact carry-all. I returned it."
2.0,"They are cute, comfortable and easy to adjust.  The PROBLEM is that not only do they FOG, but my nose was sweating so much that water drops literally formed on the shield.  It was hot and humid.  Needs something to aerate the moisture from the inside of the mask.  I’m going to punch some holes in areas that I can use to create a filter and see how that goes."
2.0,"This item was much shorter than the description and pictures led me to believe. Also, it is certainly not &#34;one size fits all&#34;. Anyone bigger than a size 8, beware. I'm giving it two starts because I LOVED the colors and he item looked like the description beyond the size."
2.0,Material isn't bad but I went up a size and it fit awful. The thing on the shoulder is just a floppy bunch of fabric
2.0,I returned it.  I am a chubby girl and the arm band was loose and awkward.
2.0,"They were low quality, too long and they were not leggings, but more like a tent it was horrible"
2.0,The color is beautiful and the material being flexible has good feel to it - but you literally can’t press the buttons through the case ! you have to squeeze hard- and for gals with nails- forget it. Going to send back and get cheap rubber slip covers instead.
2.0,It’s hurt when you ware it for long time
2.0,"Not a fan. The cut outs are cute, but the weird material make them stick / somehow tangle together? They aren't hemmed, so the raw material clings to itself. It also has no structure to it and just hangs. I tried a petticoat underneath to give some form to it and it still didn't work. Now just hangs as a big weird hump of fabric in my closet until I get the motivation to donate or sell to someone else."
2.0,See-through. Course. Not comfortable.
2.0,"These fit me fine in a size large (I'm 5'2"" 132), however, the chamois is actually very well padded but TOO big.  It overflowed in the crotch area.  I tried these with my cycling shorts and they just don't work due to the size of the chamois."
2.0,It didn’t look as good as the picture and was made with a slightly itchy fabric.
2.0,One sock fit much tighter than the other. Ended up ripping it the 3rd time putting it on... Lots of loose seams on the inside of sock too
2.0,very cheap but look even cheaper...
2.0,Pretty see through... still debating on sending them back... definitely have to wear a shirt that covers your booty....
2.0,Attractive watch. Keeps absolutely horrible time. Gains five minutes per day ever since it arrived. I really wanted to like this watch but I won't tolerate a watch that fails at its primary task: keep accurate time.
2.0,Purchased this chain was nice at first then after a few months wearing it the chain has a twist to it where my cross hangs and will not straighten out so now my cross flips backwards because of the twist in the chain. How can I get a replacement?
2.0,For teens
2.0,"The band isn't all that bad. It's not leather, nor is it a solid unit. The leather like material is only on the outer portion and the other material in between is visible making the band look rather cheap. Functions well though."
2.0,Was so excited about this dress... I went directly off of the size chart/reference size and it is way too big. However it’s such a pretty and well made dress I so wish it fit.
2.0,this picture dipicts a much more sparkly top.  really just white paint
2.0,they are 4 sizes too big and my grandson is very disappointed
2.0,"The earrings have a straight spear and the earrings never stay up like the image shows.  They just hang,  which isn't horrible.  They are nice earrings, but I bought them to have a ear cuff.  I wish i would have bought a different brand/type."
2.0,I’m not sure how to describe plastic (I knew they’d be plastic) but it’s not what I thought. It’s one solid piece inflexible and if you are wearing makeup the white may get dirty (even with primer). Can’t clean the make up off either. Just … not what I expected
2.0,"Pay attention to the hair on the model and the hand placement... they cover a serious design flaw. I don’t know how else to put it, but it makes your boobs look stupid. The cut is jacked at the chest. It makes a really awkward triangle that I assume was supposed to resemble a halter top slip. I’m not a busty woman, but the line down the center is more of a zig zag, and I’m pretty sure I don’t have zig zag boobs. Any way you adjust it, squiggle tits. The lace is pretty, and my larger arms fit well in the sleeves, but I’m not wearing this, rather devoting it to my costume bin for future use."
2.0,Nice shirt but it does not look like how it does with the woman in the picture. Very disappointing.
2.0,"Pretty, but fabric is thin and it uns very small"
2.0,"These are very cute. They are small like other reviews mentioned. However, I preferred them to be small and dainty. I used the horseshoe ones for my helix and daith piercings, the barbell for my rook, and then the straight one for my tragus piercing. I think the horseshoe (8mm) ones are the right size for any of those piercings I just mentioned. The barbell (10mm) is a little long for my rook. It works but I’d probably go down a size or two. The straight bar (8mm) is also a bit long for my tragus. I kept them all in because the length isn’t too long to where it’s a big deal to me. However, what is a big deal to me is that the end pieces come off easily. They are hard to screw on, as the end piece has a short thread to screw into the bar/tube of the piercing. I did have my husband put all of them in, as they are small and difficult to screw in. I would not buy these again because I don’t like that the end pieces come off easily."
2.0,"The lifting is not noticeable, the waist rolls down and it creates an oddly high muffin top all the way around."
2.0,"It’s comfy buts fat sweater, meaning it adds pounds to you. Makes you look larger than you are but comfy for at home"
2.0,It's very thin and cheap
2.0,This is such a pretty key chain. My friend and I bought several for ourselves and for kids. Out of the seven we bought at least four have fallen apart. I keep mine in my pocket at work and maybe it's just not meant to be used so much.
2.0,Uncomfortable material and very small.
2.0,"They are so loose, not enough elastic/stretch, and just fall down."
2.0,"That colors aren't the same as in the photo.  Looks like it had a few shades of blue/light blue/lavender. This had nothing.  The lace is also caught different then shown in picture so it looks frumpy around the arms/elbow. Material nice, fit was fine for Large. But definitely model pics are  deceiving. Sending it back."
2.0,Poor quality and fit (too small). I ordered a medium which I normally wear but the package said small and the shirt had no tag in it.
2.0,"Cheaply sewn, size runs really small."
2.0,Didn't look bad but fairly thin and leaf gets caught on the hook. Paint isn't chipping or anything though. You get what you pay for here.
2.0,Pretty snug. Usually order 2x to be on the safe side for my chest and it's snug. A little uncomfortable in the armpits. Don't think I'd buy again.
2.0,Too wide & too short m<br />Returning item
2.0,"The bracelet is very pretty but unfortunately, the lock doesn't work very well. I almost lost it 3 times!!! Just keep falling off. Would enjoy it if it would stay on my arm but unfortunately I will return it for faulty lock."
2.0,disappointed in the shirt.  basically a cheap tshirt material with a decal ironed on.  stiff
2.0,I should have trusted the other reviews when they said to order 2 sizes up not just 1. The outfit fits to a degree but I'm sure as soon as I wash it I won't be able to wear it again.
2.0,Doesn't keep time.
2.0,Tight fit in the breast area
2.0,"I bought the 3/4 and these were huge on my 3.5 year old! Very cheap quality as well, but wouldn’t worked fine under her Halloween costume, as intended, if they weren’t so big. Definitely not a fitted/legging look like we thought from the pics and description."
2.0,"I expected more bling, rather plain"
2.0,Not very well made. Won't last many times of use.
2.0,"Nice looking and comfortable, however hole in the pocket 2nd day didn't make me too happy :("
2.0,Definitely not high waist hardly covers my butt crack.
2.0,"The solid colors are perfect but this material was not as thick or as good a quality as the solids. Also, it’s a little see through."
2.0,Style is so pretty but you can see EVERYTHING through this dress no matter what you put under…
2.0,Very THIN. I got an XL (I usually wear a large pant) and they are almost transparent.  Not very streachy.
2.0,"It’s really not “chunky” like advertised. Also, the sweater is shown as the oversized style. It’s not. I tried it in and it fit like a regular sweater even after sizing up to an XL. Sooooo lame!"
2.0,"These get one extra star for fitting true to size, but they are so stiff, crinkly, and cheap-feeling. If you’re expecting something that looks anything like the photo, then buy somewhere else, because these look nothing like those."
2.0,These are small as hell. Just looking at them I can tell they will not fit my 4 year old. It looks like my 6month old can fit this. Made like pajama material. Disappointed
2.0,nice jacket runs way small
2.0,The cup was too small. Giving to my teenage grand daughters.
2.0,Cute shoes but too small.  Measured my daughter's foot beforehand to make sure I got the right size but shoes were too tight.
2.0,"These did not stay on your feet when walking and the fuzz/fur on them fell off everywhere leaving a trail all over the house (clumps). The bottom of the slipper your foot will touch is faux suede yet in the two days I wore it , already dirty looking.<br />I returned these and got a more synthetic looking one , not as classy but stays on my feet and it’s a mess!"
2.0,"These laces only lasted for about a month of field work and hiking in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine this summer. I walked roughly 200 miles on my shoes with these laces before the laces were irreparable. One lace broke after only a couple weeks and was sewed back together, broke again a couple weeks later and was tied back together with a square knot, and then broke a third time too close to the knotted portion to really leave them useful. I would not recommend these for folks such as long-distance hikers, backpackers, and others that are going to not have reliable means of replacing broken shoelaces."
2.0,These are more like slippers and they just fall off my feet when I walk.
2.0,I got 12 pairs but 3 are broke
2.0,"Cute, but doesn't adjust to fit well. I have a similar shirt like this and it's adjustable."
2.0,I don't like it.  Would not recommend or order again.  just fits weird.
2.0,Just know when you purchase only one of the bands works . The company reached out after I notified them assuring me they would send a replacement for that band that didn't work . I accepted this and as of yet have not heard from them . No replacement band yet ! So just be advised  in advance .
2.0,Waste of money<br />The coating comes off and lenses are scarred
2.0,This dress was way too small
2.0,I was hoping for richer heavier pieces of jewelry. This set would be great fora pre-teen or new teen and in this instance the price is perfect.
2.0,This is just a stretchy tank top
2.0,The headband is adorable but the gems that are supposed to be on the flowers fall off.
2.0,When eye glasses are put away the cap can’t close completely. A gap of 1/32” can’t be removed.  I’m very unhappy 😥  LEF
2.0,Had to reassemble and it still is not quite right but can be worn
2.0,"I love all dresses from this company, but the red version of this one is see through"
2.0,These earrings are very small not worth the money
2.0,"Not at all happy getting ""used"" clothes sold as new.  No tags of any kind.  First time that has ever happened.<br />Guessing a third party got it and just folded the pants up and put them in a plain clear<br />plastic bag that said, ""ready to ship"".  Maybe they washed them.  Very disappointed."
2.0,"I loved this dress when I first put it on. It was very flattering and perfect length. I wore it to a dinner party but had to leave mid-way through as the seam in the back came apart about 2 inches in length, just above my butt. Luckily I was wearing a spanx underneath, otherwise dinner guests would have gotten an x-rated show. I purchased this dress in 3 different colors and am returning all butt (snicker, snicker) the one I wore. The dress was not too tight on me, just poorly made. Price is good, just don't plan on wearing more than once."
2.0,Cute but breaks easy
2.0,"Very poor quality. Should not be advertised as an item containing bells. There are no bells on this thing, just a dull clanking<br />sound. Very cheap production. Never again for a gift !"
2.0,"I ordered an extra large and I received an extra large dress and an extra Small pants. I could not fit it above my legs! I wanted to wear it for Thanksgiving and returning it and ordering something else cuts things time too short. The material felt nice and the dress fit, but not the pants. It’s a very wrinkling material, so you have to work on that iron to get the wrinkles out. I am returning it."
2.0,"They are lovely by themselves, but made for a large wrist. Could not keep the hair tie on the bracelet, so that was frustrating. It kept popping off. I felt like the bracelet track needed to be deeper."
2.0,Great pants. Not outdoor quality but reasonably durable. REALLY cheap zippers though and they tear right out with even moderate lateral pull.
2.0,I was disappointed when I received this bag because I don't remember any pictures of it having an inside zipper pocket; I thought it was open. I'm not a fan of bags with inside zipper pockets. Tried it for one day and put it in the closet for good.
2.0,"I love the color of this dress but it is way to small on top. I normally wear a woman's XL but, I wanted a little more flow so I ordered the XXL. I was shocked when I couldn't zip it all the way up! Well, I guess it just means I need to lose weight.  I'll update later."
2.0,The screw in in the wrong side
2.0,Not true to size. Dissapointing.
2.0,"Overall dress was okay for the price, negative was the fabric had some small areas of discoloration"
2.0,"It fit perfectly on the leg part, but the waist was waaay to big, I will have to sew it or something to make it fit as expected."
2.0,Was really nice only lasted two weeks in the house
2.0,I order these in all black. They came in all colors and the lightest color one even had a stain. They hug my face very weird.
2.0,Very comfortable but seam is already coming undone on left leg after wearing one time.
2.0,"I would not recommend this watch, notwithstanding the inexpensive cost.  The face is a bit bigger than I expected, but the main thing is the faux leather watchband is almost unusable: barely fits my small wrist and is very difficult to thread and buckle."
2.0,Ordered an xl and it looks more like a 3x. But the quality is actually good. Will be returning for the correct size.
2.0,I love these glasses. However they broke after 4 months! The plastic piece connecting the frame at the front and the side broke right off.
2.0,No flex at all.  It will stick 6&#34; off the back of your head
2.0,I ordered a large and I should have ordered an extra large.  It was small on the top and too long. I am not that large on the top.
2.0,"The shirt is nice, but I bought this for my husband but it runs small......"
2.0,The material doesn’t last that long
2.0,"They look and fit great, but they are so dark that I can't see through them. Like a welders mask. Returning."
2.0,I received a beige one as a gift size 3X.  It was to big so I thought 2X would fit perfect.  Excited as usual I rinse under garment especially if they’re a dark color before wearing.  Good quests they’re 1X now.
2.0,Does not fit like the picture
2.0,"This review is for the white one - all of the previous reviews are currently for the black kimono. The white is NOTHING like the picture, except for the tassels and sheer material. The stitching that attaches the tassel fringe to the kimono is black and it looks very garish and cheap. I originally bought the white kimono to go over and match a multicolor stripe seersucker bikini but it doesn't work with the black stitching. I'm returning the white to exchange for the black to match three different bikinis - a solid black, a bright orange, and a printed black and white bikini. Other than the stitching, I felt that it was well made for the price and I liked the style."
2.0,Overall poor quality.  The suit is an awkward fit and length.  The sizing and quality are way off.
2.0,"Fit is really weird. Tight in some parts, too loose in others. Hoods are way too small too."
2.0,They are real crystal but they are soooooooo tiny for $13 bucks.
2.0,Order at least one size above what you wear
2.0,runs big and the sleeves stick out too far. it makes my arms look huge.
2.0,The blue is actually purple. Like Vikings purple. Not happy with the color at all!
2.0,The fit is good. The style is passable. The material with sequins isn’t going to last after a few wearing<br />The sequins have been dropping off without noticing until I look down at floor.
2.0,"Fit well, good fabric, but strap broke after wearing it for 5 minutes."
2.0,"The color did not match the leather on my bag.  This was more honey colored and my bag is much lighter.  Also, the strap keeps slipping and even came apart.  I felt like I couldn’t return as I’ve worn it, and regret this purchase."
2.0,"Bought it as a maternity dress. Not what I thought, it wasn't flattering if you have hips & a butt & it's an itchy material."
2.0,"Quality just isn't there, broke after just a few months."
2.0,Smaller and more sheer than it looks in the picture.  Don't wear it for warmth.
2.0,"They often come off, and are uncomfortable."
2.0,Dress is too big according to the measuring chart.
2.0,But the skulls are too over sized for the subtle look I was going for and it feels sort of cheap.
2.0,"Even though they're clear, they are pretty stupid looking because they're totally noticeable on a good shoe. And they don't make walking in heels any better. I'll give two stars on the benefit of the doubt that maybe I just cant walk in heels."
2.0,This is an updated review. Yes the fit is perfect but not as durable. The stitches of the right armpit part are not as strong as I thought. It just ripped after some normal regular use of the jacket. I'm returning it for a refund.
2.0,Too small but easy to return
2.0,"Looks just like it is advertised and got here in a timely manner, but broke within a week of wearing it."
2.0,I liked the 3 different chain styles. I really wish it had fit better. The shortest chain was like a choker. I had to connect halfway into the extension chain to get it to be wearable. The section where the 3 chains meet is not well made so that the chains sort of angle away from each other. This causes the necklace to not lay flat against your neck. The chains twisted and tangled easily. It's very pretty but not easy to wear.
2.0,"These socks are made of soft material and look like the picture. My husband wears a size 10 and they fit his feet great. The design is as pictured and looks nice. The socks are on the thin side (they are dress socks).<br /><br />The issue is that the ring around the top is too tight and squeezes into his calf to the point of causing pain. At the end of the day you can see a serious indent. He's a smaller dude, too. I tried them one day and they did the same to me, and I'm a size 4.<br /><br />I received a discount on this item for review purposes. All review content is my own honest experience and opinions, and was not in any way influenced by the seller or discount received."
2.0,"Darn it, this is a really nice design that looked and felt good, except the white collar and arm bands aren't white like they are in the photo, they're a dingy cream color. It just doesn't look good :("
2.0,"Looked for orange chandelier earring that werent overtly orange and these seemed subtle. However, the ""stones"" in the center arent stones at all, they were plastic discs that were both loose in the bag when I received. Glued them back in with some crazy glue and then noticed two of the smaller ""stones"" along the bottom were entirely missing. These are tiny plastic dots, again glued on.  I will probably return."
2.0,"came with a hole in it. I don't have the money to return/exchange, nor the time!<br />True to fit otherwise and very comfortable"
2.0,They tarnish easily
2.0,I ordered a small by mistake it still lookedokay. . Love the dress. The fabric pulled very easily. I was going to buy to more but by the end of the night it looked like I had worn it ten times.
2.0,"I wear an 18 or extra large typically. The large/x-large size was had about five inches to go for it to close in the front. Much prettier than the picture on the box. The lacy area was a bit scratchy, but the rest of the material eas not too bad, reminiscent of cheap towl fabric or a hotel robe."
2.0,The bodice was shorter than expected while the nonadjustable straps were too long. I returned the item.
2.0,"This watch is ok if you don't give it punishment like sports or playing, we lost it o ce dueto breaking pins now one of the push knobs fell out."
2.0,"This red dress is lightweight and pretty. The seams were poor and unraveling in some places, and the zipper is cheap. The material is lightweight and thin, but absolutely gorgeous. I ordered it in blue as well, and the seams were better. I'll be sending this one back.<br /><br />I'm a US medium and purchased a medium and the sizing was normal."
2.0,This item was poorly made and broke more than once.  I attempted to fix it but it broke every time I tried to wear it.
2.0,I loved the shorts UNTIL I washed them for the first time and every turned purple (they were black).
2.0,I like them but they are too big for me so when I bend down they fall off
2.0,"This is a good quality &#34;shirt&#34;. The problem is, it's more like a crop top. I tried to contact the seller to return it, and it's been months but no reply."
2.0,It was super cute but it was too wide and super unflattering
2.0,this product is made very cheap. the american flag emblem is not actually on the hat and the elastic in the pony tail is horrible. it serves it purpose overall
2.0,Nice looking hat but runs way too small.
2.0,Didn't fit properly bad product
2.0,"Pretty, but there was thread hanging off the necklace."
2.0,"I normally wear a 10 to 12 and ordered this in a large and it was much too tight/small. I had hoped to wear it to show. It was also unusually long, which is good  as far as not coming untucked but didn’t work for my purposes. The material was nice and silky and comfortable. Sorry I have to return it because ran so small."
2.0,"I love this suit, but I couldn't get it over my chest!  So sad, it an adorable concept for a suit!  If you are small chested, this is for you!  The lace part is very flattering, even on a plus size, 7 month pregnant gal!"
2.0,"Very poor color quality.  Size/ fitment is fine, but the color lightens considerably when you wear them because they stretch.  And, they become a light, faded blue and DO NOT color match the Captain America shirt at all.  Looks terrible.<br /><br />I would return them, but the cost of shipping negates the effort.  For size reference, I’m 5’6” 150 lbs slim athletic built size 30/30 pants.<br /><br />Big thumbs down.  =("
2.0,Shoes constantly fall off my feet due to inadequate height of heel support.
2.0,I thought it was not cropped. I can’t wear that type of top.
2.0,"I purchased this for my son.  While I'm sure he will still like it, the quality isn't very good at all.  Looks like it is almost covered in plastic or something.  It is bubbling - they didn't get all of the air out of it.  Somewhat disappointed as this is a Christmas gift."
2.0,Difficult to put on earring.
2.0,I bought the XL for a 40 lb puppy. Should’ve fit and didn’t come close!  Return shipping cost made it not worth the return
2.0,"Doesnt fit at all flush with the watch, after 1 day the silicon is somehow peeling from the clasp that connects to the watch and def feels nothing like apples rubber. Guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,Already showing little pilling bumps after only 4 weeks. Disappointed in the quality of this product.
2.0,"Not oversized for a size 16. It fits perfectly around my waist. But, it does not have the loose appearance i was expecting. I purchased 2 items. I like them so i kept them."
2.0,I would have hoped this ring lasted. It split right across the top of the ring. I'm very heartbroken about this...
2.0,Sent from England to America for my daughter- in- law's 50th. was disappointed to learn that the crystals were not the lovely purple colour as advertised.. but pink! Will think twice about ordering anything else shown.
2.0,This blouse is a beautiful color but not to well sewn.
2.0,"Cute dress, but the entire “skirt” part of it is see through and there is no under skirt attached. Very disappointed.<br /><br />Update: the seller refunded without asking me to return this - said they were working on fixing the issue."
2.0,The description is wrong.  The socks are regular socks.  They are not fuzzy socks.
2.0,"The quality feels cheaply made. I didn't know it was made in China and that it needs to be dry cleaned.  I will toss the before paying a dry cleaning bill.  It's okay, but I wish I would have only bought one instead of 3.  Not worth money!"
2.0,Cute but ran small and not a lot of support
2.0,Bottoms are different from what is pictured.
2.0,It looked like a maternity smock on me. Returned.
2.0,"I purchased the Ukes strap to use with my Costa Broadbill sunglasses. Unfortunately, the opening of the Ukes band is way too narrow. I have an old pair of Costa aviator style glasses which work well with the Ukes."
2.0,These socks were bizarre.  All of the toes were too big for my foot with the exception of the pinkie toe which dug into my foot.  They did not fit tightly and had very little grip.  Would not be suitable for a barre class.
2.0,"Bought these in a size 16 and they are better suited as a bathing suit cover up. They fit fine at the waist but run very short in the back and even with the black color, it is see through. This may not be the case for smaller sizes, but for plus sized I would avoid these shorts for everyday wear"
2.0,Snaps unsnap quickly. Cheaply made
2.0,"The dress is somewhat cute, but it runs large and made me look bigger than I am. So not very flattering. The material is smooth and soft however, it looks cheap. The lace is the same but not all that soft."
2.0,Arms of the product are not properly sewed
2.0,Does not look like as pictured. Returning it. Not flattering either and too long. Pretty sure it’s see through too
2.0,love the look and feel- but broke in 2 weeks
2.0,It’s too expensive to pay this much for this bag. Doesn’t have zipper plus if you try to wear it on shoulder the belt is too long when I tried to wear on my shoulder the bag was like almost on my knee. Not worth it.
2.0,"On top of ghastly feeling fabric, this shirt is a very wide and SHORT fit. I'm only 5'4"" and it's very short on me."
2.0,"I could not wait to get home from work tj take this off.  The cups were not filling,  the sides were uncomfortable and I was not happy.  Not happy at all"
2.0,Fits fine but the Velcro isn’t strong and the edge of the back strap hits my sons ankles and rubs them raw no matter what I put on them. I’m probably throwing them away soon. (Harsh but true)
2.0,"Not made for men, maybe boys! 2XL more like medium. Returned item."
2.0,"Nice for.  Good price.  The snaps at the bottom fell apart ,,,,I don't want to but I have to return it.  If they can improve the snaps its gonna five stars...."
2.0,"This sweater is a halter style sweater, it barely covers my belly button. I will NOT be wearing this item."
2.0,Very uncomfortable. I had to run a lighter across it to burn off the strings and glue that was scratching me.
2.0,I don’t think my large was really a large and I already threw the packing away.  From all the review this should’ve fit me just fine.  Not impressed.  Would’ve been nice to receive correct sized dress from what the sizing guide told me to buy.  Would never buy again.
2.0,This “dress” is more like a tunic top! Incredibly short and would probably work for someone five feet and under! I’m 5’3” and the small just passed my butt! Pretty blue color tho!
2.0,Nice dress but too tight around the waist.
2.0,After two weeks it burned or left a burn mark/ wound on my husband. Might have something to do with the rack he has to wash and sanitize his hands alot. Works in a restaurant.
2.0,"It came with a small top and large shorts, I never tried to send them back so I can't review the customer service. The material was silky but kind of cheap looking and bc of the mismatched shorts I never wore it. It did arrive super quick and not expensive at all."
2.0,"I bought the black dress and it was thin see through material (not what I expected). I meant to return it but got distracted with life and never got around to it. I would NEVER wear this out as a dress, it is just too see through and the shape at the top can show too much if you are larger up top.<br />But since I missed the return deadline I have used it as a night gown since it is a really light material and it is one of my favorite nightgowns."
2.0,"thin, cheap not worth it"
2.0,I bought the smallest size and it was way to big for my wrist. I already chose the first hole and the strap is way too long. Leather is stiff. I bought this strap through youtuber Thao Huynh review and this sucks.
2.0,The pins I received were reversed.  Israeli flag was  on the right where the American flag should be.
2.0,Got a hole pretty quick
2.0,Really loved the sneakers.  Very comfortable.  Wore them twice and the one shoe stopped working.  Going to return and reorder.  Hoping it doesn't happen again as the same thing happened to my friend who ordered at the same time.
2.0,"First, the zipper is on the wrong side for American men. Second, the material is about half the thickness of a name-brand hoody.  (I have several Champion hoodies. This one isn't nearly as nice for me.)<br /><br />However, it's perfect for my 23 year old daugher. I gave it to her. She loves it.  But it's not for me."
2.0,I Should have read measurement chart better. Sending back 2 dresses so far.
2.0,"Overall I was fairly disappointed when I received this ring, it's very bulky and awkward."
2.0,Im dissapointed with the condition of the fabric. It seems worn!!. Fact is i bought it as a gift for my mother-in-law and i have no time to return / buy someting else since im taking it to her in a foreign country. Hopefully she forgives me / understands.
2.0,glasses function great but the nose bridge isnt designed very well and the adhesive used to mount it failed on one side and the nose support broke lasted 30 days but for use they work great close or far great help for diabetics where eye sight can change by the hour<br /><br />1/31/2017 update;  Contacted Adiens Adjustable Eye wear to Inquire about their products to see if they had larger frames any different nose bridges their response only have one style one frame and we don't sell retail. But check back after you go to another brand and we are researching new styles. I really liked these glasses but this kinda cutomer assistance can change  a opinion pretty quick
2.0,Starting off with the hat bc it was literally a silk screen on a seam. It was not usable. The dress was ok but on the thin side. The socks that I got looked like someone took them off. It wasn’t even folded nicely.  Skip this purchase.
2.0,I gave it two stars because they are warm.  No more stars because these don’t fit.  They won’t stay on.  The mechanism on the inside feels flimsy.  I would not buy these again.
2.0,When they arrived I was sent the wrong size instead of a man's large I got a XXXL and the woman's small shirt was paper thin and looked like it would fit a toddler . I did like the design
2.0,"This belt might be good for something, but as an actual BELT it is completely useless. The braided design gives you many options for belt holes, but the braiding is so loose that the belt constantly slips, to the point where it's pretty much hanging off. The first time it happened, I thought maybe I had forgotten to buckle it. But it kept happening, and it happens several times during the course of one work day.  I've quit wearing it and will give it to my cat to play with.  The two stars is because it *is* genuine leather and because my cat likes to play with it. Would've been one star but for that."
2.0,Ordered the Red one in small to go with my bike but got the gray one.<br />The armor isn't CE level armor it's more of just foam. Not sure how it would hold up to a crash. But that can be replaced.
2.0,Very skimpy.  Color not the same. Sent it back
2.0,My son is currently wearing size 4 shoes but was not quite ready for size 5.. I bought these in 4.5 hoping that they would fit. However they were too small.
2.0,"Not the measurements stated, I needed bigger ones for my shirt because the pair I have come out too easily, I measured mine and got these because they said they were 10 mm wide, when they are 8 mm wide, nice looking, but smaller than stated"
2.0,It is a soft material but it gaps open between buttons so I'm kind of scared to wear it.
2.0,These look cool but broke pretty fast.
2.0,Red is too bright shiny red. Doesn't give classy look. I don't think I am going to wear it. Unfortunately my return window is closed. Fit is good though.
2.0,"Low rise as in it comes up to the top of your pelvis! Does the job. Not too short. I'm wearing now now (28wks, twins, 158 weight) number 1 complaint is just it's very low rise. This may just be a me preference but being my 4th pregnancy, I was looking for something a bit more supportive or st least to cover my undies"
2.0,"This bag is so very beautiful on the outside. I loved all the sweet, colorful kitties. The bag was smaller than I had anticipated, but it was so pretty I decided I'd keep it anyway...until I unzipped the bag and saw the inside. The inside is cheap, cheap, cheap. The lining is so thin you can see the outside design on the bag through the lining. Also, the lining isn't sewn into the bag, so it slides, bunches, and moves. The insider zipper pocket is a joke because of the cheap, thin lining. The inside pocket truly wouldn't sustain anything with any weight to it, plus the zipper on the inside pocket was cheap and fragile, too. And the bottom of the bag on the inside beneath the liner? It had some sort of very cheap, very thin plastic between the bag and the lining that was supposed to provide a sturdy bottom. It didn't. It slid around as well. The only reason this bag got 2 stars from me is because 1 star is for how lovely it is on the outside. Otherwise, it would be a 1 star product. It's simply not a usable bag."
2.0,Only gave two stars because was supposed to receive 5 masks and was only THREE in package! What a rip off.<br />They are lightweight and comfy but did not get what I purchased!
2.0,Look cool up real close but the saddle on the back is too small they fall out a lot
2.0,"It arrived quickly but, as you can see, is extremely off centre. However, it is not flimsy. In fact, it is so thick and heavy I thought it might be glass (it is not).  The construction bears no resemblance to the one advertised, the edges are rough and sharp.  This company is in woeful need of quality control."
2.0,"Such a disappointment.  These pants, at least in this color, need to be made with a lining."
2.0,"i got the rainbow colored one but it is basically just yellow and orange. the edges aren't quite finished, so be careful as it may catch on things."
2.0,They don’t have rubber grippy stuff on the top and roll down. Tried on several different shapes and sizes and rolled on everyone
2.0,Is very nice but too small for me but i keep cause my mom like the dress.
2.0,"After a few months the swivel connector broke. No strenuous or abnormal use. Can't return it. The first one I bought didn't fit to specified size. Gave that one to my son. Bought a new one. That's the one that broke. Like it and was durable, but I guess the swivel rod is weak. Two stars because it broke. But it was also good belt and grommets. Just a weak part."
2.0,The structure is good and seems correct but the big part of this besides the design was the bronze color which did not match at all with what I got. The metal is a grey greenish so I’m returning it.
2.0,First big wind on the beach and it flew backwards and the handle to tighten it fell off.
2.0,nice necklace but hard to read .... and the lettering was a gold color not black as in the picture .... disappointed in the letter coloring i ordered black and should have gotten black
2.0,Size small is too large
2.0,way to short i need over the calf please.
2.0,I bought one of these a few years ago.  It had metal clasps and was very nice.  This one has plastic pieces.  And it doesn't come in the useful storage box (which made it so easy to find the strap in my purse or briefcase).  It just shipped in a little plastic bag.  :(
2.0,"I ordered three different pairs of these leggings in the same size, but I found that the sizing varied quite a bit from color to color. The charcoal grey marl pair in particular fit a lot tighter and shorter (more of a 7/8 length than a full length) compared to the other two I ordered. Otherwise I liked the style and colors of the leggings.<br /><br />Their packaging says to contact them if there are any issues with quality or sizing, and that they will 100% solve any problems. So I reached out to them about exchanging the leggings I received for a pair that was the correct size, but they just responded saying that the sizing differences were normal and that sizing will vary because the leggings are made at different times. They never got back to me about an exchange or replacement. I’ll probably be returning the leggings."
2.0,My kid wears an 11 so bought in 12. These are not a 12. Her toes are at the very top so she wont be able to wear for long. Color gold is pretty but look cheap.
2.0,Broke off after wearing a few times.
2.0,The pleats didn't lay right on the body where they hit. I'm 5'6 and 115lbs and I just looked lumpy in the dress.
2.0,"Soooo, I had higher hopes for this dress based on the pictures and description. Not only is it not the best quality of material, which is fine for the money, it was not what I expected based on the picture. The red is more orange than red, and the fit is more awkward than flowing.<br /><br />I decided it would be fine on the days I had to work at a remote data center location. You know it's bad when data center engineers tell you, ""it's not your most attractive frock."" I'll just leave it there.<br /><br />I still have the dress, and I do still wear it comfortably around the house so it wasn't a total loss."
2.0,"Runs very small, not true to size. I'll suggest 1 or 2 sizes up"
2.0,Sized up per seller size chart as Medium showed a 37 chest and I don't like it tight. The Large was way too big all over so would suggest ordering your regular US size. The material is thin with tiny subdued sparkles woven in. Ordered the Black which is not see through. The style may be more flattering to someone smaller chested. Slightly larger at hips.  The material did not feel like it would hold up even for  1 washing.  For $15 it's OK.
2.0,I don't like the style
2.0,The gems are so tiny and close together you can’t even tell what they are.
2.0,It is not true to size at all
2.0,"I received this as a birthday gift.  I was looking for a nice everyday type of necklace.  This looked like it would be perfect.  However, in less than 2 weeks of wearing my neck is turning green and a lot of the 'silver' has now worn off.<br />Something that showed so much promise really ended up disappointing."
2.0,"It came damaged and I could not use it, I thought it was folded halves, but it was not. Amazon was good to me and I got my money back and did not have to return it."
2.0,These are extremely cheap quality they're like the leggings from the sixties very poor
2.0,I have short toes so product left odd fabric hanging off my last 2 toes.
2.0,I ordered this necklace specifically for the Red Stone.<br />I just received it and its not red but a deep brown.
2.0,"Looks alright, but it Pops off watch easily. I lost it the first day."
2.0,They're cute and it's a good price but the balls literally fall apart! Not made very good at all
2.0,"A little too long for me. The stones are cute, though."
2.0,Around the chest area is really tight
2.0,Material was all bunched up and folds don’t come out. Is very rough and cheap looking. Fell apart after I hand washed it. Very disappointed. The color is nice however.
2.0,The white band is discoloring and becoming dingy.
2.0,"I am keeping and wearing with shirt-tale out, because I opened package."
2.0,not the best of quality. you get what you pay for.
2.0,Looks uglier than inbpictire
2.0,Pretty but not sterling silver.
2.0,The earrings are beautifully designed. However the pair that I received was assembled with the lever back facing the front. I had to return them.
2.0,"The depth of the case was advertised as 3 cm. It is 3 cm at the front and back, but the sides taper to a depth of less than 2 cm (see photo). Therefore, it was not large enough to enclose my prescription sunglasses."
2.0,I was excited to find a slim band for my Fitbit Versa 2 watch and really liked the design on this band; however the pin mechanism does not hold and the band keeps popping off.  Very disappointing!  Was wondering if I just got a dysfunctional band?
2.0,"They look really great, but fell out of my daughters crocs first time she wore them."
2.0,Looks good but did not come with a latch which is ridiculous
2.0,Dress was a pretty color but the sewing quality was lacking - Thankfully I was able to return
2.0,The straps are a different color than the body of the bag. One strap is not square where it is sewn on
2.0,WOW low cut my word. The top is a stretchy material very roomy. Too bad the rest isn't made of the same material. It would have been perfect. Soooooo disappointed :(. Bottom fits small. Sending it back.
2.0,I was excited to get these to use for work but they are way more marled than I understood from the photos and they also have a weirdly tight waistband compared to the tightness of the pant. I have a small waist so I expected it to fit fine but honestly it's wayyy too snug and looks unattractive leaving me with a stomach bulge over and under the waistband. I went on a whim buying these and they did not fit my expectations.
2.0,"This product was made from a weird material and made the dress shiny. It is form fitting but the material doesn't give it much &#34;give&#34; so it doesn't fit many body types well. It was also thicker then I expected making it rather hot to wear (not breathable material). Lastly, it was an xl by label but id say it was much closer to a large. I was very disappointed because it looks so pretty in the picture."
2.0,Couldn’t fit the mask over my head to get it on
2.0,"These look great but are poor quality. On the day of my wedding I gave a pair to my bridesmaid and when she picked it up to put on the pearl broke off the earring. My earrings cost $6 and were higher quality than these. I didn't expect perfection, just something to last 2 hours through a wedding and reception."
2.0,"Love the look, but way too heavy on the ear lobe. Returned item."
2.0,Very small for a man with muscles
2.0,"I love a good pair of dark sunglasses, but these are wayyyyy to dark. Even in the sun you can barely see through them. My search continues."
2.0,definitely did not cool. a little lighter than a mask but still fogged my glasses
2.0,It runs small. I'm normally a large and this fit like a medium. Not slouchy and not enough room to tie a not. Really disappointed.
2.0,Fit is fine but the material looks really cheap.  :(
2.0,It does fit the versa 2 well but its actually painful to wear. The band is very stiff and the extra loop to hold down watch band has sharp edges you can feel against you skin.
2.0,"Material feels like a costume cape. Not something worth over $20. Mine also came with a stitching mistake. Overall, the dress is okay, I personally just don’t think it’s worth how much I paid and will be returning"
2.0,Shrunk after one wash.
2.0,"Very stiff, and uncomfortable"
2.0,I ordered the 3-6month size. It was huge. Could easily have fit a 1 yr old. Will be returning.
2.0,The opening is way too big and hangs out of the nose funny
2.0,It is not a silk mask
2.0,Quickly fog.
2.0,After one wash the stitching on the cuff of the sleeve came undone.
2.0,Too much exposed boob .. the picture makes the breast area look well covered but it’s not .. I bought this for my teenage daughter who is an adult size 6/8 and it’s way more revealing than the pictures suggest
2.0,"Just received and put in the black one. Rubber gloves helped to get a good grip. Sadly, when I popped it out, the black paint chipped ever so slitghly, hopefully it's not toxic!  Cute but cheap!"
2.0,I like the color/pattern but the pattern is not mirror image as one might expect. The slits are superfluous as they do not show up with the pattern and would show up only if one's legs were really heavy and thus stretch the material. It will do to wear under slacks/jeans.
2.0,More like a legging fabric ...but rides up ALOT!!!!!<br />In less that 20 steps you would think it's a mini shirt
2.0,"I didn't realize this mask is a satiny-type material so it has a sheen to it (that I don't care for). It stays sucked in to my lips.  Due to the type of material, just as soon as I pull it away from my mouth, before speaking or moving my lips at all, it immediately reforms to my mouth. Otherwise, so far the mask is fine."
2.0,"Super cute!!!!! If only it actually fit.<br /><br />The large did not even come close! I have a fairly large &#34;dome&#34; (hat size 7 3/8&#34;) and this sun hat was barely 6&#34;. For anticipating a large and reading other decent reviews, I am now very disappointed.<br /><br />I also noticed the buttons of the smaller inner hat did not have enough to match up with the button holes of the larger brim attachment. I will be contacting the company to see if this was what caused the super teeny tiny sizing issue."
2.0,"The concept of this LONG SLEEVE shirt is fantastic.  I was very excited when I saw all the different and fun options for a longer sleeve, longer falling shirt (one to cover up the back when wearing leggings).  After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase the large.  When I received the shirt, the arm length was more like a 3/4"" sleeve.  Not what the description states at all.  The shirt also was not long as described for the bottom hemline.  The material is a very cheap cotton, if it's cotton at all.  All in all, I was disappointed with this purchase and returned it.  Unfortunately, I DO NOT recommend buying this product.  For reference, I am 5'6"", 148 lbs."
2.0,"It won't stay on, the holes barely keep it in."
2.0,"0 gauge- Two out of four didn’t spin at all, the two that did required blowing into from such a close distance that you couldn’t actually see them spin only feel a vibration in fingers. Did not wear at all. This is only relevant to 0g, larger size may work better."
2.0,"This dress is pretty cute and the color is also very nice, but since I'm very petite, it runs a little long and the upper body part is kind of lose, maybe it's for someone taller and with bigger chest."
2.0,"Inconsistent product delivery. Will not order from this company again. I ordered this item twice, once with the sun necklace, and once with the moon (though I got a sun both times). The purchase page picture shows a blue background for the sun's rays. The first order came with green, pretty, but doesn't go with any of the outfits I'd wear this set with. The second order gave me a blue sun, instead of a moon, and green earrings. So now I'm returning both and moving on with my life."
2.0,"Thin material, poor quality."
2.0,"I'm a size 16 and bought the XXL which should have been too big, but I could hardly get it on and off.  I literally had to have my boyfriend help peel it off of me.  The sizing on this product is ridiculous. At least for Americans.  And the sleeves were too long.  Now that I look closer at the display image, I see that the sleeves are upturned to look shorter.  And it's made of a thin, nylonish feeling material that isn't really the most desireable.  Too bad it wasn't just regular t-shirt material.  I was going to give this to someone skinny at work, but she tried it on, and it was way too tight for her, and she normally wears a medium.  So I have to hassle returning it.  Too bad, because I really like the graphics on this T."
2.0,Got the set it is very nice will give an update after I wear it .<br />Update ....Wore it once for a few hours and set has already change it went from Gold to bronze .Didn't appreciate that at all!
2.0,I bought these for my daughter and after the first time she wore them they started to slip down in her shoes and wouldn't stay up on her feet. For a person with sensitivity issues these are not very good and especially for the money you pay.
2.0,This band is very cute but it doesn't stay on it comes off very quickly
2.0,"The issue here is the hat is made for someone with really small hands and a small head...but mostly small hands. Like this person uses minature shampoo bottles all the time, needs a handle on all cups, and replaces a small steering wheel with the stock one in their smart car or mini cooper. probably a good idea to buy a little tooth brush at the local dollar store but they'll need a stepping stool to get to it."
2.0,Eh! Not what I expected. The L wasn’t centered. I ended up ordering my son a better quality cap from target.
2.0,Releases randomly on its own and screw snapped after 6 months
2.0,"My wife was excited to try this, but when it came she felt like she was wearing a costume more than an article of clothing. Not that the material is bad, the material is quite nice, but it didn't fit in a flattering way- the cut was all strange, even thought technically it WAS the correct size and it did fit on her.<br />Suffice to say, she didn't look or feel like Audrey Hepburn, despite claiming to be her style of dress. She felt more like someone trying to dress up for Halloween in an outfit that wasn't cut properly for an adult."
2.0,"The first time I wore these, a small hole developed in the base of one of the fingers.  I would expect the to last for more than a few wearings for the price I paid.  Maybe I just got a defective one.  I thought the stretch fabric was pretty good, maybe they had to stretch too much for my hands.  Maybe they would perform better for someone with smaller hands."
2.0,These are cute but they won't last.  They aren't durable enough for my 3 yr old.
2.0,I am  unhappy with the fabric and the fit.  For the retail price I expected a quality stretch material. Material is thin and provides very little support. I wear a size medium and that is what I ordered. Their medium is a size small.
2.0,"I'm 5'9"" 150 lbs, 36A-27-41. I have long arms and legs, short torso, and A-cup boobs. This fit me really strangely. The bodice was cut and sewn really awkwardly. the elastic in the sleeves was also too tight. Everything from the waist down was pretty, fits just like on the model. The top is just strange if you have smaller breasts. Also looks like it would be a weird fit on large breasted girls. So maybe just try to be perfect before ordering? lol :)"
2.0,Very tight compared to other size 13 sandals
2.0,They fell apart very fast.
2.0,"The watch itself is fine. I've even received compliments. The watchband is terrible. Very soon after I got the watch, the end of the band began to curl. I had to trim it with scissors to get it to slide under the two free loops. (Google &#34;parts of a watchband&#34; to know what a free loop is.) After owning this for only two months, one of the free loops fell off. Then, in the third month, the second free loop fell off. I replaced this with a zip tie. The curling worsened, but I could still finesse the end under the zip tie. However four months into owning the watch, the entire buckle fell off the watchband. I put the watch in a plastic bag. I'll need to buy an entire new watchband. I understand that Amazon offers the warranty on this, not the maker Affute. I have no idea whether Amazon will do anything about this. I'm willing to bet that most or all the watchbands have deteriorated like mine."
2.0,This belt isn't real red... it's more of an oranges red.  I had to go purchase another belt because I needed a RED belt.
2.0,The memory foam was very thin and I provided no comfort.  I am returning shoes after being worn for 30 minutes.  I felt like I was walking with no protection.
2.0,"The color is more of an orange pinky red, which is not what I wanted. The fabric was a cheap polyester satin material. Overall, I had to return it. It was not up to my expectations."
2.0,Terrible make up.  These are not typical lose fit pants.  They have a tight elastic at the top that just kills it ... would have been nice if it were mentioned.
2.0,"This bathing suit is made for someone with a long torso. I am 5' 2&#34; and it fit badly. The bra cups wanted to ride up my chest and gapped open. They are not made for women with smaller or larger breasts. Also, the skirt doesn't provide much coverage in the back if that's something you are looking for. The material and make was of less than average quality as well. It is not completely unwearable, but I wouldn't recommend this bathing suit."
2.0,"I love the dress, but I had to send it back because it was way too small.  I did reorder the dress in a larger size, and I'm waiting for it to arrive.  It's a lovely dress, but definitely order at least a size up from what you usually wear."
2.0,"very disappointed.  There is a plastic covering over the image.  The plastic is an amber color which takes away the contrast in the image and, frankly, if I didn't know the image was a stack of books, I'd have just thought the image was nothing more than subtle stripes..<br />If it weren't such a bother to return them, I would, but at this price, it's not worth the effort."
2.0,This ring bent & broke the minute I put it on . Cheap but poor quality had it 1 hr & had to throw it away. I don't think this was real sterling silver.
2.0,"Like other reviewers, I found the smell to be so bad the mask was unusable."
2.0,Very thin.  Not suitable for covid protection.  I am going to double them up and see if it helps.
2.0,"Ordered 2xl for a pajama top.  I thought would be bigger than, I needed.  My size is the normal large size  But, the 2xl is still to small.  It is a very nice t-shirt for smaller people.  Not worth sending back.  Maybe, I'll find someone who can use it."
2.0,Tubs really small.<br />Chart is not equal
2.0,"This is not black, it’s Navy. It’s also the wrong size."
2.0,Length is too small but the width is way to wide.  Very off on the sizing.
2.0,Nice product but I received a slightly different color than I ordered
2.0,"My kids were so excited for these, but one of them arrived with slits already. The plastic material is extremely thin and fragile. I am not sure they will hold up more than a couple uses with toddler handling.<br /><br />I was looking forward to the kids using them and being well protected with the bubble design and the clear material, but they will not last with thin plastic like this."
2.0,"Looked great, but the smalls were way too small. Had to give it to my son and buy a large instead. Check the size... it is based on slim Asian men, not your standard American more husky build type. So when ordering, go a size or two larger."
2.0,"The dress was pretty. Material was heavy, but quality is alright. I guess it makes sense due to the price. The reason I gave it 2 stars was because of the smell. The dress has this awful crayon smell on it. Perfume couldn’t cover it, so I had to hand wash it. Even after the wash, you can kind of smell that crayon smell."
2.0,"Should have read the fine print I guess. Wrongly assumed since the picture was 2 hats, I’d receive 2 hats."
2.0,The picture does not show that this a two-tone belt...two different shades of yellow.  Very disappointed.
2.0,It's a off white wasn't white enough for the event...looks dirty
2.0,"The bag was nice, but I did not receive the stickers referenced in the description. Only the bag."
2.0,"Ordered small and even after wash it's huge, the fabric is not flattering. Will not buy from them again"
2.0,"Doesn't look like the image shown when you buy it ,whole reason why I purchased it was for the picture an her name. Not good"
2.0,Flexible but confusing to put back together when taking the strap off because no picture instructions came with it on how to put it baxk together
2.0,Worn 4x. Both side pockets are ripping (alot of crawling/sliding). Fraying. For the price I suppose they  are good for 1 season of play.
2.0,"I like how simple and thin the ring is, but it's extremely hard to get in my nostril and also clasp shut. And if I rub my nose at all, it'll come unclasped. Kind of a shame. It's really cute, but it's almost not worth the trouble."
2.0,"I knew it ran small, ordered a size up. My biggest issue was the red color transferred to my bed sheets.  I threw this thing in the trash and reordered a light color because it is rather cute!"
2.0,That is a screen shot of one of my vids but this was a large because I always size up but even when. I size up it’s too small like when I bend my arms. There was also A LOT of strings hanging off and it came with black tights instead of black socks since I am kinda broke I am still gonna use it but when I can I am prob gonna get a new outfit follow my TikTok and insta to see my cosplays @scandal.cos_
2.0,Cute but not as cute as in the pic -
2.0,"I was very disappointed when I received this ring.  It did not shine, even after I cleaned it.  One of the stones was actually cloudy.  It wasn't worth sending back, I threw it away.  A waste of money completely."
2.0,Ordered a lg the top part fits but it's like the material was cut wrong bc the bottom half won't cover me. I can't wear it around my children.smh.
2.0,I liked the fit and the pattern. I'm 5ft2 and 170 lbs. I ordered an Xl. The quality is lacking though. Material feels kind of like a thin swimsuit. It also snagged the very first time I wore it.
2.0,"The shoe looked and fit fine.  I ordered these for severe heel pain.  I have used another brand in the past that helped tremendously with other foot pain (plantar fasciitis).  These look identical to the other brand in the picture, including the material and texture, and the description also uses a lot of the same language, saying they are ""recovery"" and ""post-exercise"" sandals.  They are $15 cheaper so I thought I'd try them.  However, they do NOT compare.  They are hard, not squishy like I was expecting, and they actually hurt my toe where the shoes slides between your toes.  They look the same, but they do not feel the same.  I had to send them back."
2.0,WAY TOO BIG FOR WOMEN
2.0,Returning because I got a large for oversized and it was more of a snug fits just right.
2.0,The color wasn't as pictured .
2.0,"seemed great at first, but were flimsy and broke in two weeks"
2.0,a liitle small for a medium
2.0,"I am a size 12, 5’4” and 185lbs. Tried XL and L sizes.<br /><br />The material is very cheap feeling and see through before I put it on. Not soft and absolutely no stretch to it. The large Fit around my hip/waist/thighs, but couldn’t even sit down or bend knees without feeling like upper thigh was going to bust out. XL wouldn’t even stay on my waist, would fall down to almost past my butt after taking a step. Very disappointed,these looked super cute in the pics. I feel like it would’ve been better if it was more of a legging material."
2.0,"hmmm. not really that impressed. I purchased the blush pink dress. The buttons are not as pictured, they are not pearls but cheaper looking plain peach buttons.  Also the color is not this beautiful soft blush pink, it is more of a peach. Also the material is very cheap and thin and should be lined for this price. Not impressed, but also not surprised. #brutalhonesty"
2.0,Waist was fine. Length great. But way too baggy on top.
2.0,Runs much smaller than expected. I was hoping for something loose-fitting and this was not it. Also the top elastic band folds in half and rolls down. I will be returning this item.
2.0,Too large and not as cute in real life
2.0,It is NOT GENUINE LEATHER. MOST of the shoe made of synthetic material. And only flowers made of leather.
2.0,Didn’t like the fit. Very cheap material but hey you get what you pay for.
2.0,Very tiny made for a little girl. very pretty though. I will give them to my granddaughter .
2.0,The collar doesnt work and the material of the entire piece is flimsy.
2.0,Cheap. Fits probably at biggest a large b cup.
2.0,"The material feels really cheap and is quite  hot.  The top ruffle rolls up and does not lay well.  The colors and design and sizing are exactly as described, it's just not very wearable."
2.0,Washed it once and it shrunk. No longer fits after one wear.
2.0,Received it damaged. The material was nothing like expected. Didn't fit.
2.0,"I'm pretty confused by the good reviews for these leggings. The material is thin, stiff, and itchy. The only good thing I can say about them is that they're cheap, but you definitely get what you paid for."
2.0,The boot is too small and tight/narrow
2.0,Did not mention it had glitter woven throughout.  Would have loved it if it was just rust color.  Ordered it because I have it in black but the glitter was scratchy and not cute.
2.0,Very itchy. Pretty color and style but it is boiled wool and itchy
2.0,I bought my size and went up one size extra according to the reviews and yet it was still small fitting. The colours are nice but the material feels very very inferior and cheap.
2.0,It came with detached tagging and labels.
2.0,"I love the design of this necklace, but it is a lot smaller than I expected and is not made very sturdy. It seems very fragile and I fully expect it to not hold up to everyday wear. Kind of disappointed."
2.0,Way too small but I think nearly all clothes you purchase directly from China is going to be too small for the average American person.
2.0,"Pretty lace but way too big, even being 21 weeks pregnant"
2.0,Extremely cheap looking and feeling
2.0,"Great style. However, they are not durable and not made to last. One of the arms came really loose within just a few weeks."
2.0,Would be great if the XL wasn’t the size of a small or medium.
2.0,"Doesn’t work and can’t get follow-up from manufacturer.  Watch does look fine for price, would need new band definitely, but what’s the point if it doesn’t work and can’t get assistance."
2.0,Detail was not as clear as the photo in web site/low quality jewelry it appears as something mass produce
2.0,"What I received did not look like the picture provided. I ordered the orange shirt with white Halloween pumkin face. The color is not a fall orange, it’s more of a very light/pastel orange. I usually wear a medium and this shirt was HUGE. I know it advertises as loose, but it is just huge.<br />Also, the material is feels like a light T-shirt - just in case u were hoping for something else.<br />It did ship for free, but took forever to arrive.<br />I gave it 2 stars because the material is soft and I can use it as a sleeping shirt..."
2.0,See through fabric. It feels good and washed well. My daughter should get a month or two out of the suit. So if your looking for something more substantial this is not the suit for you. I wouldbhave returned it if I hadn't washed it first.
2.0,"I would have liked it if the belt came with it like it's described and shown. Sadly, I had to return the jacket since they had no others in stock. The emerald green shade is deep and absolutely beautiful. This moto jacket is stylish and comfortable, but you need the belt and mine didn't come with one."
2.0,"Great concept, but the magnet is ‘too good’… it’s so strong, it starts to hurt after a few minutes."
2.0,"Don't cut down on night glare, they just turn the headlights yellow instead of white.  They are nice looking glasses and do help a cloudy day look brighter but if you want them to help with night driving, they don't."
2.0,Disappointed. I wear size 10 - Should have ordered an XLarge - The neck is VERY wide - it droops over the shoulder and shows bra straps and it's not as long as it looks on the model. I should return it but for the bother will probably just pass this one on to my smaller daughter in law;(
2.0,"Bright bright gold, not what I expected."
2.0,"I ordered a Medium based on the sizing description in the actual listing. I wear a 7.5...THese are huge! I feel like I am wearing Clown Shoes...=( I wanted to exchange them but when I checked my return window on Feb 28, I was 2 days too late... =("
2.0,Washed this once and it’s falling apart.
2.0,To tight around ankles
2.0,"The fabric is way too heavy...I was expecting something lighter and more flowing.  Very disappointed. The design is great though, have been looking for a nice swing type robe/house dress but the weight of the fabric makes it very uncomfortable to wear.....unless you are looking for something to keep you warm...but it has short sleeves so why would you choose this style to stay warm. I"
2.0,Dislile how they slide down while wearing them
2.0,"I was hoping for flowy, it’s skin tight. Very stretchy, but not flattering at all. Ordered a 3x, fits like a L/XL. Nice color, soft fabric, but can’t wear it."
2.0,Nice looking watch but I bought it for my mother in law who has macular degeneration so we thought she could just push the button and know the time. The button was hard to push and the voice was a British accent which was hard to understand. Also there was no way to make it louder. So sorry it didn't work out for her. I returned this watch.
2.0,"The metal bits looked really great, from an artistic viewpoint. But the &#34;leather&#34; cords are plaatic feeling and very little flex so they stand straight out. Relatively happy with it but would not buy again."
2.0,"Too thin, too narrow"
2.0,Only one glove works.
2.0,"Beware!! I ordered a size 6-9 month and only the size stretches, not the picture!!! The lil bows and some small applications are missing. It's still nice though, just not what I expected."
2.0,"Cute shirt, but way too small. I suggest buy 1-2 sizes up."
2.0,The color was more of a deep Navy and the pattern was way smaller than shown. It was also smaller than the size guide had shown.
2.0,"Love the look of the shoe. Only problem was they fit weird on near the pinky toe which made them tight, too right to wear comfortably,  for me at least so I will be returning them unfortunately"
2.0,Same bag that is posted over and over for 18-24 dollars. Unless you don’t mind the writing “ FOREVER  MINEYO Originally from Korea” printed on you bag. This one is in black so not so Noticeable. But the wine color is more purple than I care for. So I will be sending it back. P.s. If it wasn’t for the writing in the ad color the bag itself is pretty nice. And the iPhone 13 Pro Max does fit.
2.0,"They have a cute look to them and I like how warm and fuzzy they are for my daughter. However, after my daughter being outside playing in the snow, she went to take her wet gloves off and the fuzzy liner came out upon removing it from her hand. It’s impossible to get the fuzzy liner back into the glove!"
2.0,"I've not been able to make myself wear it, as it looks funny."
2.0,"I have get really bothered by night glare of oncoming traffic when i drive so i was really looking forward to these working but i was disappointed when they just made everything look wired and yellow , glare was reduced a drop but so was the overall vision so didnt really help much. But it did come in a nice case i may use for other sunglasses!"
2.0,"Fits as expected, soft material. Finally worn for the first time and noticed a hole at the neck once it was on."
2.0,"It is supposed to have a magnetic clasp. After only a few months, the magnetic aspect stopped working."
2.0,Lovely piece. Link that connects to lobster clip separated. She has never taken it off since she put it on. Not happy with this product at all. I would give it a 1 but because she loved the piece so much I'll give a two.
2.0,"Ran small in size, easily torn, horrible quality"
2.0,Very thin material.  Stitching came unraveled.
2.0,"Pendant is very pretty, but was attached to the chain with a piece of wire that has the strength of an ordinary staple. Pendant fell off after three days. Hoping I can find a jeweler who can reattach with something much more substantial."
2.0,I bought a size 6 & a size 6 was too big so I had to return them other than that I love the color and the ribbons that was on the back of it I'm totally going to get another pair of but a smaller size
2.0,"cheaply made, looks like dingy lingerie"
2.0,"Although it looks like it could handle a busty gal, forget it. Anyone C or above, avoid this one."
2.0,The fit and look was deceiving and not at all like the picture. Glad I only ordered the one. It’s wearable around the house but never outside. 👎
2.0,Usually wear a small.  Too small/short.  I had to wear a black bra under it b/c the it scooped to far under the arms (in front).  I wouldn't dare put it in the dryer.
2.0,Not very good quality.  I kept it to seT around the house.  Warm.
2.0,I ordered this because I love skulls and Halloween. The picture is way better than the product. The mask is not worth thr $16.00 more like it's a mask you find at the dollar store.
2.0,The button on the left always gets pushed while I am wearing it and then it changes the alarm times and other settings.
2.0,Plain ugly and arms too tight
2.0,Item to small
2.0,Too small  Size up. Poorly made.
2.0,"Weird silky material. Pictured as shown for image, but overall shirt is very cheap and not as expected for the price."
2.0,Already have holes in 2 pair in less than 2 weeks.
2.0,"The Zebra Wood Clubmaster Sunglasses are too small for an average adult size face. One will first notice sunlight enter the sides as soon as the glasses are donned. There is absolutely no further abduction in the arms once opened -- mine broke at the hinge, simply after removal from my head. Possibly these sunglasses is best suited for the face of a child?"
2.0,"Material is ok, although the top is over sized (I’m a DD)."
2.0,Don’t order the size Amazon recommends! It was TINY! I couldn’t get it over my head. So disappointed. The material feels weird and cheap. The polka dots are much larger than they appear in pics.
2.0,"Really cute, but :  Seam split after the first wash."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:9f9d81f14b4ee6aa5aecc5a85ca298c]] this looks a feels like a low quality polyester shirt and it Is yellow. The images on the shirt are juvenile and there is a lot of fabric folded over behind the button panels. It ran small in our household. it might be good for a young person for summer fun but I have a hard time knowing what anyone's taste would be. I think if it were white I would like it better but the light yellow background diminishes it.
2.0,"Returned.<br />Pink dress was  Not as vibrant…<br />Think material, not flows"
2.0,"It it a little bit too thick, so it makes my foot feel smooshed when I put my shoe on."
2.0,"The clasp was in front by the stone.  The stone had 2 or 3 little chips..<br />Not too happy, but was kindly refunded."
2.0,"I think the earings were adorable,  however I had almost an immediate reaction to them. My ear started itching. It became red & swollen. I gave them to my mother & she had no issues. I was disappointed because they were very cute."
2.0,"Seems like a beautiful dress but the size chart is completely wrong. I ordered a large and it did not fit like a large. I am 5'7'' weigh 164 lbs, I am a size 10-12 right now. The dress felt more like a medium or a small on me."
2.0,"I was very excited about this product. But when my son opened it up on Christmas Day, the axe, the fire extinguisher, and the whistle were broken. Very cheap, besides maybe the flashlight. I wouldn’t recommend."
2.0,"Items have pretty print, but cut too small.  When ordering, double up your size."
2.0,Liked this dress but didn't love it.
2.0,These bracelets are way smaller than expected. When you stretch them wider the just look weird and fit uncomfortably on your wrist.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:9a08ca80a99925941833856b4a272668]] I was so excited about this bracelet I couldn't wait for it to get here and now I'm disappointed. The color is beautiful but the bracelet is so small. The head of the lion is smaller than a dimes and is a stretchy bracelet. It's to easy to break this in my opinion. I really wanted to purchase the ZENGER 18kt Gold Plated Zircon Roundel Macrame Bracelet for 75.00 but after being disappointed with this purchase I think I might go to another company that's not on amazon because these guys have the best advertisement for bracelets on here.<br /><br />Beautiful Bracelet Just Small - Platinum PAT
2.0,"These shoes are GREAT shoes for little kids. Super great price point, and I love that they're slip ons. My kids can get them on and off by themselves with no issues. But the white is HORRIBLE. They're not even cleanable. Once they get even the smallest speck of dirt on them....FORGET ABOUT IT. My kids wore these once or twice and got a tiny spot on them. I tried to clean them like I always do any other white pair of shoes. And all it did was smear and totally turned the shoes into a nasty merky color. The kids use the white ones SOLELY for playing in the dirt now. They're used as junk shoes. Do NOT recommend getting the white."
2.0,Not leather at all
2.0,I bought a gray sweatshirt from you and the material is nothing alike eventhough it's listed as such. It's like thin t shirt quality.....<br /><br />Consistency is key to repeat business
2.0,"Poor quality, very cheap fabric.  I was leaving on a trip and did not have time to return.  Took it to local alterations shop to have mended at torn seams.  Wrinkles easily and very sheer to iron.  Would not recommend."
2.0,"I'm 5'6&#34; and weighs 145lbs (average), and this dress fits perfectly except for the fixed high waist band. There is a tight waist band and it's fixed with a zipper, which is really narrow. If you're a tall skinny girl, no problem I guess, but an average build lady like me cannot zip it up unfortunately."
2.0,"Cut stylish hat, but way too small for my husbands fairly normal sized head. It fits me snug. Will look for a better product next time. Shipping took FOREVER!"
2.0,"I went with what other reviewers said and ordered a size up.. I'm 5'4 and I normally wear an xs/s so I ordered a M, the length was too short and it was super wide. When it came in the packaging it had a horrible smell like gasoline and was wrinkled. I went to return and they have yet to process my return."
2.0,"Too thick. I’m a size 8 and the toe came up too far on my toes and showed with my pumps...NOT making them truly no show as described.  I’m sure they’re fine if you are wearing Converse or Toms. Sadly, I can’t return."
2.0,Wont stay up like it should
2.0,"Very ill fitting. I order my coats in 1 size larger typically to accommodate for larger pieces of clothing, i.e. winter sweaters. This was huge, had no shape. Pretty cheaply made. Got one at Costco for $10 less and significantly better quality and fit."
2.0,I ordered extra large to make sure it fit right  but still it's to small
2.0,They are cute but it's probably my fault and didn't look but they are tiny.
2.0,"These bibs are made from the roughest, cheap cotton fabric. Don’t waste your money."
2.0,"This is a very well made visor and 100% cotton, but I was disappointed because it was so heavy that it made a dent in my forehead when I wore it. I kept having to take it off because it hurt to wear it. It just didn't sit right on my head, despite being adjustable.<br /><br />I had tried two others, and the one I like best was perfect. [[ASIN:B01MXTW2N9 LAfashion101 Unisex Visor Lightweight & Comfortable - Ideal For Sports & Outdoor Activities - Available in Many Colors, BLK]] I have ordered two more of those and am returning this one."
2.0,My child is 2 and it’s really small. The bow tie broke immediately.
2.0,It broke within a day.
2.0,"They look good but the quality is very poor, it took only one use and they ripped already."
2.0,I little bit tight on a BBW's neck but still fits and is cute
2.0,very thin waste of money to me
2.0,No way! not even if I ironed it three times! it is way to stiff and a size large did not fit around the bust. I usually wear a size 6 or 8 US
2.0,Cheap fabric and very sheer. Had to return.
2.0,"Runs SUPER small. Order large for my 9 year old, hoping he'd be able to grow into it. IT barely covers his butt and he won't be able to wear it for very long. He loves the color and the hood."
2.0,Larger than I anticipated But nice
2.0,Ordered a medium based off the fact that I'm normally a xsmall bottom as suggested & they are still too small. Top is decent since adjustable & there aren't any issues even though I have a 30E bra size.
2.0,"This looks and feels like a swim suit top, not a bralette. The decorative straps cannot be adjusted, the ones closest my my armpit are not flush with my skin. The swim suit closure in the back, cheap pads, and minimal cup coverage dissapointed me greatly."
2.0,Too large. Too bulky. Not as soft as other reviewers led me to believe. I gave it away.
2.0,"Ordered an X-Large as I am more bustier, however, ordering larger did not help how this shirt fit. Manufacturer was way off when predicting sizing."
2.0,"The quality on these was okay but the fabric was extremely thin and sheer. You could probably wear it under a dress and be okay but by themselves. In the photo it looks like these have a wide elastic waist band but the actual elastic is about 1/2 wide at most which makes the band very uncomfortable. The fit was okay, a little on the snug side especially through the hips and thighs. The legs were not fitted from the knee down as pictured but were more of a boot cut."
2.0,"Fast delivery, just was a littled defected, threading was cut and left hanging."
2.0,Too bulky. The quality is not what you see in the picture.
2.0,Cheep material and awful sawing. Size is more like M than L. Small.
2.0,"LOVE this print so much!! Looks just like the picture, but completely see through, there is no lining in this dress."
2.0,I planned to give it as a gift to a teenager.  Was too small - later I gave it to a 3 year old.
2.0,"Looks nice on, fits well and feels nice. I was happy to see it had a tie on the inside but very disappointed it didn’t come with a belt. I’d return it but I need it for the weekend and I can likely find a ribbon in the house that will do the trick."
2.0,These are super cute I bought them for my girls but they are really small.... Small like a nickel or penny I  thought it would of been a little bigger
2.0,"Looks and feels cheap, material is flimsy and stitching is not uniform. Didn't like it at all"
2.0,It looked cheap. I wore it and it cheapened my luxurious outfit.
2.0,"It's a nice jacket, but even the XS is giant."
2.0,The dress was pretty but didn't fit my chest and arms correctly. It kind of wraps around your shoulder and then you stick your arm through. wouldve been really cute tho!
2.0,Very pretty but very tiny
2.0,Does not look like the pic at all. juat a regular black shirt.  I was hoping for a looser fit.
2.0,"This is a nice shirt I must admit, but things to know about it are that it is see through at the top, made from really cheap material and when you order it be advised to order it a size down from what you might usually order it in because it looks like a pancho on me."
2.0,Got the costume for Halloween it had great photos.  It feels fine when you where it but you won't be able to wear it multiple times unless you glue all the studs back on yourself. Upon delivery I'd say about 20% were off the costume in the bag. After taking it out and putting it on about another 10% fell off. After reattaching all of them and wearing it to a Halloween event another 10/15% fell off. If you recover and reattach most of them the outfit will still look fine. Otherwise you are going to just be wearing a black faux leather armor set. I wish I could give it a higher rating but spending 2 hours fixing a costume right out of the bag is unbelievable
2.0,"I haven't yet tried the charging ability, I am kind of scared to, the plastic clasps used to hold the solar panels closed are weak and flimsy, the clasps broke while I was attempting to open the unit, and the directions are pitifully confusing. I am very disappointed in this product."
2.0,"I was not overly impressed with the quality of this set. The wire strands came bent and misshapen. The earrings were cute, but the necklace looked like kids play jewelry, so that's what I ended up doing with it. I gave the set to my friends daughter to use as costume/play jewelry. If I had purchased this, I would absolutely have returned it."
2.0,"Sadly, these are too big for my face, which is bigger anyways. They’re so thin that I don’t trust them to work on their own but I am going to try wearing under my mask at work to see if they’ll help prevent breakouts from hospital surgical masks but otherwise pretty useless. They’re soooo thin that I don’t think they’d help protect me or others from me if I was sick or something. Can feel my breath through the mask without really even breathing heavily. Cheap, yes? Effective? Probably not."
2.0,Color is NOT EVEN close to the one shown in the picture. I order the peach-pink color and is ORANGE. it runs really big. I gave it to my sister.
2.0,"Product was of expected quality. However it was in its original packaging, labeled $10.00.<br />Since Amazon is selling it for more than double the price. Tacky!!!!"
2.0,It was. Broken when it arrived... It was very very cold out and the top is plastic.. I am working on getting it refunded.
2.0,The earrings really didn’t look like the picture. There was not as much stone as it appears and the colors were not as pretty. I returned them.
2.0,"The fit of this was very strange. It was right in the front, but very loose and floppy on the back. Also it doesn't breath at all, despite being pretty thin."
2.0,The bottoms fit fine but the top was not proportional at all
2.0,"Like how it completely surround my sense and the band cant come apart at the connection to the watch part. However, buckle came apart on one. Switched to second one. It has discolored to blotchy grey and has fallen off twice."
2.0,so the pants fit really good… And I go to button them and I realize there's no button hole🤷🏻‍♀️ I really don't know what I can do about this other than cut the pants and hope I don't screw them up
2.0,this ring was nice when we got it but after 3 or 4 days of wearing it all of the coating began coming off and onto my finger
2.0,"It’s stretchy but the XXL would probably comfortably fit someone who’s normally a size Large. The worst part is this romper isn’t biker short length, it’s very short. Like cheeks hanging out short... I am returning."
2.0,Broke within a day of me wearing it
2.0,They are cute but not put together very well. The LEGO came off the post. I had to glue it back on.
2.0,"They are made of a nice material but are to small and tight even with the adjustments for a man's face .. Gave them to my daughter and she loves them .. Should have different sizes for men and women, definitely be more productive that way"
2.0,Chevrolet is spelt “chevdrlet” everything is else fine just the misspell.
2.0,Would be great if you could order one color
2.0,Seems cheap for the price. Would have felt better if it was cheaper.  Runs a little large
2.0,So low quality.
2.0,The dress did not fit as was advertised and the material felt cheap. I returned this product.
2.0,If you have any short of stomach it shows every curve! Material is very thin.
2.0,They looked really pretty in the package but got pilly after only one wear and worse after the first washing. They have some kind of fibers in them that poke my feet. I do not recommend.
2.0,"The waist down fit perfect, but the top was very large. Had to return."
2.0,The quality was good but this bracelet is very small - for a child not an adult.  I was disappointed.  Now must find a little 5 or six year old to give it to.
2.0,I ordered my regular size but they didn’t fit as well as my DAWG. Z sandals.  I ended up giving them to a friend because they were too short for me. Also the height of the sandal was higher than the dAWG Z sandals and it was not a comfortable fit. I won’t buy the Telic brand again.
2.0,The seams are sideways different material than I thought did not like them too lazy to return
2.0,The material is very thin and doesn't give at all. They ties for the neck are also way too long for my liking.
2.0,orderes xl fot lime large<br />medium
2.0,"No matter how hard I try, I can't stretch it enough to fit<br />a medium size helmet (Z1R).  They just made the Halo band too small.<br />Stuck with an unusable product, so to speak."
2.0,this purse is not YELLOW........
2.0,These are very tight and kind of hard to put on. They are also very uncomfortable and the padding keeps bending inside
2.0,Cheap price and even more poor quality
2.0,"If you have a width waist looking from back, this is not for us! Front TOP part is flattering looks and fits pretty, BUT it just top part, bc from the back in ur waist area, it looks REALLY BAD. Is more for a good shape body, For reference I got a blush color in M, is a see through, am 4,11 ft with 147 pounds, fits too long! Cute color but am returning it, is not for me!"
2.0,"It came very wrinkle material we wash them it came out same, my husband doesn’t how to iron the material cannot be iron. VERY DISAPPOINTED"
2.0,"I'm 5'7'' 160lbs 38b bra, I ordered the xlarge in black floral. According to the size chart under pictures this should have been loosely fitted on me. This item runs small. I bought it for a swimsuit cover up, it will work for that purpose. The front barely comes together across chest and the length on me comes to mid-thighs. Material is see through and has a strong chemical smell. Hopefully this will not shrink when I hand wash it. Hope this helps someone else with sizing."
2.0,Everything fit except the bust area was way to small.
2.0,the quality is not the best
2.0,"Thought this watch has a digital compass but, alas, it doesn't.  It looks like it does from afar but it's just a design.  I should have checked the specs closer so it's my fault.  But it looks great though I haven't used it much yet."
2.0,"This mask is very small. I bought them for work but I gave them to my 13 yo instead.  They run very small,  maybe woman with small face or teen."
2.0,"Absolutely  doesn't  keep form and  style,only for  very  big heads, I have to think how to fix it, because  I don't  like to sent back items<br />Fur ok for the price  and warm"
2.0,"Very thin, delicate fabric. Bigger than expected."
2.0,"I’m sorry but these earrings are not rose gold. They look like cheap, old gold. Very disappointed cause after days of searching, these are the only earrings I found in the size and color I wanted."
2.0,This shirt is really short. Anyone that has a longer torso it hit mid way. The picture is not correct. The material is itchy and stiff. I would not workout in this.
2.0,"This was advertised as a Sport Face Cover.  Well the mask on it's own it really think and hot to wear with not much breathability, but f you add the filter it is even worse.  I would not wear this to work out unless you are trying to limit your oxygen on purpose.<br /><br />The print is cool and the earloops adjustable for fit but it is the least breathable mask I own.  I don't know how someone would work out in it."
2.0,"Looking at the picture I was really excited about these cool adjustable elephant rings. A number of people in my family collect elephants and I really enjoy them too, so the idea of having a ring that I could wear my daughter could wear by just adjusting the band, was great! Unfortunately, when the elephant ring arrived, the elephant itself looks like it was not crafted with the same care as in the picture. The elephant is a bit less distinct than shown, and the overall effect of a cheaply done elephant in resin is not as good as expected from looking at the advertising picture.<br /><br />Perhaps I just got a defective one that was not crafted to the usual quality, but I was not impressed."
2.0,Low stars for brightness. Green ones fantastic…blue ones. One would hardly find you in the dark
2.0,Sweater is nice but almost sheer.  Very thin.  Easy to snag.
2.0,"ok for the price, I'm a size small-medium and the bottom of this bikini fitted good but the top will be for someone with no breast"
2.0,Shoe height was low and they keep slipping off my ankles. Construction is okay but have doubts about their longevity..
2.0,It'll make you look pregnant. Trying to figure out how to make this shirt work.
2.0,Ran small. Not as nice as i expected.
2.0,Would work for child.
2.0,I’d like to meet the model for this shoe to see if they actually have toes. There’s no way to fit your foot into the front of this shoe.  I had to buy shoe stretchers and use a heat gun to try and make these work but the only workable option would have been Kim k style with the pinkie toe out… i have a shred of dignity left and I wasn’t wasting it on that.  The shoes will live in my closet and every few years I’ll try to wear them and experience the disappointment all over again.
2.0,"I love the look & feel of these, but they stain terribly easy! I’ve barely worn them, and they are stained ALL over! I definitely cannot wear them outside the house anymore."
2.0,"I don't have a figure exactly as the model featured in this costume. But close, honestly. I didn't think to take a picture bc I was so disappointed.<br />It looked very frumpy, I felt frumpy in it. Perhaps I was too excited.<br />The material was sparkly tho..."
2.0,"Received a pair of Thursday Co. Captain boots that came with these laces. They look fine and feel sturdy but are incredibly slippery, that is, as soon as you pull them taught they slip back as soon as you release your hold. Same thing when tying them, the loops just slide against each other. Hence, you can really get the exact fit you want and whatever you end up with easily loosens.  If these were waxed they likely be great.<br />fwiw, the Thursday boots are super well made and comfortable."
2.0,I didn't like the material....
2.0,Disappointed in quality of fabric and shoddy workmanship.
2.0,Demasiado grandes y poco estéticos.  Es facil que se desprendan las piezas.
2.0,Was expecting a burnt orange color but it’s actually sun kist orange. Fits snug would recommend a size larger.
2.0,"Cotton/poly fabric pills after the first washing, making the garment feel scratchy."
2.0,"I'm 5' tall, 115 lbs.  Ordered size Small.  They're too large, and too long.  Also, not warm.  They're no warmer than any other leggings I already have."
2.0,Only weighs 30 lbs.  my umbrella blows over in the slightest wind.  Look for a base that weighs at least 50 lbs or pair with brackets that allow you to attach the pole to the wall or railing.
2.0,"reguLar tipicaL Liners,they are just okay."
2.0,"They are beautiful.  Of good quality.  But if you are not pending they come off, and more so now with the mask.  And although I find it beautiful, I recommend (if you use a mask) buy earrings with insurance so you do not lose them."
2.0,They go on great but within an hour they're sliding down.  No sticky strip inside the garter to hold them up.
2.0,"I had to cut a bigger button hole so the sash would pull through. The ruffles are sewn crooked in places. The waist sags after an hour of wearing because the sash needs to be thicker or there needs to be a button. Luckily, I can sew and work with it… but not worth the money."
2.0,Very thin and low cut. My wife bought it and had to wear a t shirt underneath to have coverage.  Would not recommend this shirt.
2.0,The coating is peeling.
2.0,Glasses helped very little while driving at night.  Very disappointed.
2.0,"Let me first admit that I have a bias against shoes with elastic stretch tabs.  I immediately dislike them before even putting them on.  Thar gave these shoes a “strike one”. Strike two popped up when I looked down on them and saw that they made my feet look two sizes bigger.  Not a selling point.  They went down swinging when their robin’s egg blue reminded me of on old Miami Vice segment I saw on classic tv…not my look.<br /><br />I have to say they’re comfortable and the quality is okay, but I’m afraid these just aren’t my style.  To each his own…"
2.0,XXXL is a little snug on my son he is big for his age and usually wears mens small. Its a onesie (hands and feet) so he has to wear shoes over his costume. The seam started coming apart around the fingers after trying it on once. Its NOT worth $30.
2.0,This did not meet my expectations for quality. The leather was low quality & cracked and the brass fittings were tarnished and not shiny. I ordered the black one as well and hopefully it will resemble the photos but now I'm not holding out hope. This was delivered wrapped in cling wrap and put in a box. Not sure what I was expecting regarding packaging but certainly not this. Item will be returned.
2.0,"Quality wasn’t great, print was almost faded or cracked looking and did not receive the hair band with it."
2.0,"These are super cute earrings, but…  the problem is they are exactly like the picture. Meaning the way they lay is Exactly like the picture. I’m hoping my husband can make them be where the hook is not in the side. But facing back so I can wear them. If not I’ll have to return them and hope I can get a pair that work since they are so cute."
2.0,looks nice but has a bad smell and does not have enough room for women stuff
2.0,"I asked a question about replacing the chain easily and was told that it would not be a problem. Sadly that is not the case, not an easy change. The chain length is shorter then I like to wear, but I can wear it and it is nicer then it looks in the photo. Over all for the price I am not so happy with this necklace, the bell is more of a rattle sound."
2.0,Used to be Ninja; not Ninja. They started unraveling as soon as I put them on.<br />Not Ninja at all...
2.0,"Thin, cheap material with an odd stitching bump and the elastic is thin and feels likely to fail in a month. Good thing I have multiple masks."
2.0,"Could be cute but it was poorly made. The seams are weird, like it was sewn to look &#34;fitted&#34; but is still baggy, so the way it fell on my body looked strange."
2.0,"I expected better quality for the price, but maybe that's expecting too much. The fabric, though heavy, looks like a cheap felt. The fit is bulky and does not cinch in very well at the waist. The belt is especially cheap looking and way too long. I wish they had made it into a simple tie instead. Most disappointing of all, the pockets are fake! They are partially sewn closed and only a couple inches deep. :("
2.0,Mi niño tiene 2 años y le quedó muy ajustado.  Es muy pequeño para un niño de 2 años.  Si está muy bonito el de buena calidad lástima que resultó muy pequeño para un niño de 2 años.
2.0,"While this type of ‘dickey’ is a GREAT idea, it isn’t implemented very well.  It is Very short front and back.  If you are flat chested it probably fits fine but if you have any bosom it doesn’t even come to front edge of bra.  Better design would be 2-3” longer allowing the elasticized side straps to not be right under your arm pits (which is very irritating).  I may see IF I can sew on fabric to lengthen front and back which would allow me to move the side straps down from the arm pits.  Fabric and seams are perfectly fine although one side strap came off while trying it on but it think it could be fixed.  Soo all this being said I’m debating on whether to take time and effort to make these actually usable or return them 🥴"
2.0,I had it for over a month and it started tearing
2.0,Love the print but the hat isn't made well. certainly not the quality portrayed in the image. There is no lining in the front or finished seams and the fabric is stiff and bulging instead of smooth.
2.0,Love the locket but it came with something nasty all over the glass and crystals.  I cleaned it with alcohol and got a lot of it off but there's still some on it that I can't get off.  Disappointed to say the least.
2.0,I guess you get what you paid for. Stones ok. You can see ring mold on edges.
2.0,I loved the fit of these pants I bought two pairs. Each one of them after washing on the low setting came out with holes in the seams. They are not able to be sewn because of the stretch fabric. Very disappointed with the quality of these pants. Today I went out in them and found another hole in the seam on the outer leg.
2.0,Thin material. I ordered a plus size pair and they are very tight. I’m a size 12 in U.S. sizes.
2.0,Don't like the loose sleeves.
2.0,Hat is too big for my 2 year old boys. It fits my head.
2.0,The part that attached to your glass frames is too slippery and comes off.
2.0,If you buy get next size larger.
2.0,Should have ordered larger size.
2.0,"So I bought this in a large and I figured it would be a perfect fit. I was dead wrong! This isn't my first corset that I have bought and worn. I have bought plenty of corsets throughout my lifetime to know what to look for and what size to get. So I got a large thinking that it would fit, I couldn't even put the corset on. My sister tried to loosen the ribbon some and that did NOT look right AT all! She was able to fascin the corset, but it pushed everything weirdly to the middle. I have a little belly, so I wanted this corset to be able to make my belly and sides look on point. This did NOT work! So I am doing the next best thing and getting two sizes bigger and if it is too big I can tighten the ribbon to make it fit."
2.0,Not quite as expected. The fit is a bit too high to the inner thighs. I will not recommend for big thighs because it will go up. I will stick to the longer boxer briefs.
2.0,"The top is one size and the bottom is three sizes smaller. I ordered 12 years size and the top says 160 and the bottoms say 130. The bottoms are too small for my daughter. It is a cute suit, but I will have to return it."
2.0,"I have nursemate socks size XL that are perfect, but these “one size fits all “ are too short and will not stay up. So disappointed."
2.0,I liked the looks but it broke in about a month.
2.0,This product was not suitable because of the fabric.
2.0,Too thin. And not the length you stated.
2.0,The material is not what I expected but it fits ok
2.0,Dress was very heavy and would have been too hot to wear in the summer.
2.0,"The fit was excellent, the material was so sheer that it was entirely see through.  Not appropriate for public use."
2.0,"Not stretchy, picture is poor quality, and sleeves are short and wide🙁"
2.0,Good materials.<br />Beautiful colors.<br />BUT.....<br />The size is incorrect.<br />I am a size 9/16 (14 mm) but they are like a 1/2 (12 mm or so) and now I am stuck with them 🙄
2.0,I like how dark the polarized lenses are but they squeeze my head they are to tight and i have a small head plus i had to order then twice because i waited a over a week for the first pair and they came to me broken!
2.0,See through!<br />The leggings are a great fit. They are see through and offer no real covering. I wanted to wear them to the gym but I feel too exposed.
2.0,"I was expecting these to be shorter, they were relatively light weight but they seemed cheep and bad quality. These get caught in thick curly hair very easily"
2.0,way too small...
2.0,its an odd fit. small I like the print not the fit
2.0,Droplets of water appeared under the faceplate. I dried it out but it occurred again.
2.0,Not very comfortable on my ankle.
2.0,The batteries dead now I have to hut and find new batteries and pray it work or my daughter costume will be ruin.
2.0,the part the bar screws into came out and i can't take one of the out and it wasn't even tight.
2.0,bag was much smaller than we expected. about half the size of what is shown in the picture
2.0,"Not really what I expected.<br />The picture makes it look like the buckles are shiny, glittery and raised.  But it's one piece and the buckle is just purple (faded) ink.  Nothing fancy about these at all."
2.0,It’s very hard to open and then when you try to unfold it it’s singed to unfold it and you fell like you don’t want to pull too hard because it’s a cheap material so you don’t want to break it... and it’s so hard to get photos that small of circle I wouldn’t bother with it
2.0,"Color was orange looking and fabric was very thin, felt like cheaply made"
2.0,"The band is super cute and it feels like great quality. The metal piece of the band that clasps it together on my wrist is a problem though. My skin is somewhat sensitive, and I saw the reviews of other saying it caused a rash. Usually I get rashes from belt buckles and stuff like that, and normally all I have to do is cover it up with some fingernail polish and all is well. but with this band even with 4 coats of fingernail polish over the metal piece it it is still giving me a rash which makes me super disappointed because I really liked it. I literally can't even wear it for a day without getting a rash."
2.0,"I bought this watch about 2 weeks ago and the watch doesn't function well: the second hand stops for some reason. In the past few days, I've had to reset the watch a few times to the correct time because the second hand stopped turning for some reason. The watch's band is also uncomfortable. I know it's fake leather, but it's still feels stiff and it doesn't encircle my wrist very nicely. Maybe I need it give it more time, however, it's been such a short time that the battery shouldn't have died out. I don't know why the clock gets stuck on a time."
2.0,"I am so glad I know how to sew and alter.<br /><br />Like someone else mentioned after I have already ordered the outfit, the size chart is completely wrong. There is definitely vanity sizing going on here.<br /><br />I have a 28' waist so I ordered a medium. It was WAY too big. I ended up ripping out the zipper and sewing it back in to take it in at least around the middle (about 4' in total).  It was still a little too long, and I generally struggle finding once pieces that are long enough for my torso, so that was a first.<br /><br />The bust ruching was crooked and didn't go down far enough so I added an additional gathering stitch.<br /><br />One of the straps was sewn in twisted so I actually ripped both and made them straight straps instead of crossed for ease of getting in and out.<br /><br />The tights are absolutely useless, as someone else also mentioned. They are not made for anyone who is going to stretch them in and way. the crotch went a third of the way down my thigh. It wasn't cute. I ended up buying a pink mesh lingerie suit to wear underneath.<br /><br />The gloves, tiara, and cape were adequate. I found boot to wear so I only use the leg covers as leg warmers in my boots.<br /><br />Basically, take your measurement and order 2 sizes down and/or expect to have to do some alterations. If you are fine with alterations, is a decent base, but still go down a size or two first."
2.0,"Beautiful color, but it was mischievous smaller than anticipated."
2.0,"These sliding shorts are well-made. They lasted through my son's entire spring season, his summer baseball camp AND a full fall ball season with little sign of wear. However, the title and product description says they come with a cup and I only received the shorts. I contacted the seller, but did not receive a response."
2.0,Didn't care for how they fit.
2.0,Received them broken. Bigger than expected but cute.
2.0,"Definitely not as pictured. Product is deep blue, not faded or sun washed at all. Also, no form. You'd have to wash it 50x and sandpaper it then mold it into the shape of a head and use a rubber band to get the bill rounded.<br /><br />I love the company Life is Good so I'm not sure what happened here. Definitely doesn't have that vintage vibe at all."
2.0,Short and tight.
2.0,The shorts band is super tight
2.0,"I got these for my four-year-old's birthday party, and I kind of doubt any of the kids will be able to actually wear them. They're incredibly small. The material is super flimsy and thin. Okay for cheap party favors, but get something else if you want it to last."
2.0,Necklace was nice but the chain was broken.
2.0,I used them one time andvthe hinge broke on one of the Lens. It’s also hard to put makeup on because the lens folds down and it’s in the way.
2.0,Lens was way too light.  Not expecting my eyes to be seen when I have on sunglasses.
2.0,does not look like the photos. it's kind of stiff and does not look flowy like in the photos. i ordered the green expecting it to be darker. SKIP IT!
2.0,"Goodness, are these cheap and clunky. The sound is even cheap. However, the look of the basketball wives necklace can be achieved with a low price. I advise against the earrings though. I guess it depends on what your style is but I couldn't pull them off and wish I could've returned the earrings for someone who'd actually wear them."
2.0,Cute sandal. Runs way big though. Get size down.
2.0,The product is way too large - I had ordered a &#34;Small&#34; which really is more like a &#34;Large.&#34;
2.0,The swimsuit material is very unflattering on plus size women.
2.0,"Ok I went off other reviews and ordered up, thinking these people ordered large. Because I’m similar height (5’3”) and weight (145lbs) I wear 10-12 because I don’t like to look like a freaking sad sausage. I ordered an LX, thinking these other reviewers were ordering large, nope they must be ordering a vanity size like small or medium.<br />These leggings do not have any support but it’s probably because they are so large and I can see my underwear lines right through the material. It’s a great deal for someone that doesn’t require any support and goes commando in the gym. Not this girl. Going to have to return them."
2.0,Do not buy!! Keep falling apart!! Very disappointed in these glasses!!
2.0,Pictures on the site looks awesome but quality of the material is extremely poor. Waste of time and money in returning it.
2.0,"looks so different .... the actual stuff,"
2.0,"I got this for my son's first birthday party, so I got it in the 12-18 month size. The outfit was adorable and looked super cute on him. However, the snaps in the crotch wouldn't stay snapped. He is a little chunky but also pretty short, so the length shouldn't have been a problem. I've never had an issue with snaps coming undone on any of his other outfits, but these unsnapped in mere seconds if he was doing anything other than being held perfectly still."
2.0,it fits like an extra small dress
2.0,"Not sure why everyone is raving about these sunglasses.  They're super cheaply made, and the lenses are HUGE (I'm female) and the nose pads don't sit anywhere near where they should.  Returning them today.  Disappointing."
2.0,It feels like a defected shirt
2.0,This product does not fit well. The back portion is big and the cup size is small.
2.0,Too small to be useful and way over priced.
2.0,"Large in some areas, tight in others. Nice color."
2.0,This didn’t work for me. It was cut skimpily & just looked cheap. I opted for a much more expensive but much higher quality jacket & Im happy I did. You often get what you pay for.
2.0,I bought these for my boyfriend the first pair went on fine and the second tore while he was pulling them on so our search for a decent product that he can easily put on before work because i will not buy these again.
2.0,Went by the size chart and way small.
2.0,"Very pretty, but much shorter then I expected"
2.0,"This dress is cute but was way too short on me and I am only 5'4"". It was also see through."
2.0,Took a long time to figure out how to ware this. It came packaged as a jumbled mess. Didn't come with instructions or a tag that gave any indication which side was which. Almost threw it away then I decided to keep trying. With some dedication I figured it out.  Not planning to invest in anymore of these.
2.0,Not at all what I thought it would be!
2.0,Stiff and uncomfortable
2.0,"This is nothing (short and weird)  like the original Land's End (when Land's End WAS Land's End!) robe I bought 25 years ago, which is still all in one piece albeit showing its age.  This thing looks like some kinda weird mutant terry-cloth fabric that I have never seen before and never hope to see again, so bye bye and back in the box!"
2.0,way large.  had to return it.  could pull it up way up over my belly button like granny panties.
2.0,"The necklaces I ordered were ok, and I guess they basically matched the picture,  but it was larger than I expected and I thought the round part was a small marble-sized ball...rather than a disc.  The biggest problem though was with the red one (I also ordered blue, purple and light green).  The red of the disc didn't really match the red of the necklace at all.  They were still given as gifts as peacocks have a special significance for our family,  and they seemed to be well received but I wasn't impressed.  They did however arrive as expected and no issues with the seller/shipping.  I would stay away from the red one."
2.0,The designs are very cute. Customer service was great.  Not sure why girl sunglasses would be with pirates and planes. My son had leaks in 3 of the 4. In 2 he leaked around the elastic in the fabric. In the airplane print he leaked right through the front.  Contacted customer service and received a quick response and refund.
2.0,It is see-through 😔
2.0,"It looked lovely online but a major disappointment in reality. For the price I expected soft, cozy terry cloth fabric. Instead it was thin, scratchy, cheap looking. Hard to justify the high price and extra charge for delivery."
2.0,The bottoms were perfect but the top is so small.
2.0,"Had to cut it down and make two separate bracelets out of it. If you don't have super skinny wrists, this bracelet will not fit."
2.0,I never even tried the dress in<br />Zipper was ripped and I forgot to send it back. Ugh. It is still in the trunk of my car ready to be returned.  Too late now.
2.0,It was cute but it’s way too oversized. I tried to look at my order to see what size I chose thinking maybe I selected a bigger size not realizing but now the description brings me to a whole different cardigan so idk.
2.0,It is not at all how it looked in the picture. I am very disappointed in it. It is not worth giving to my grand daughter.
2.0,"The shades are super cool, mine came in a crushed box and has a lens scratched along with the carrying pouch ripped. Other than that cool shades."
2.0,"Seams are crooked and fabric is slightly bunched in some areas as a result. The stitching of the side pocket on the inner lining is flimsy and the back pocket zipper is attached crookedly. 2 stars because the shorts are still cute and the purple color is nice but the quality is very poor. I did like the high waist on these. I am not sure how long the shorts will last, however, because some of the seams look like they might rip. Also, when I received these, the inner tag had been cut off, so I'm wondering if these were from another brand...Will be returning."
2.0,"They came broken at the bridge. Easy to fix, just a annoying. Look great though."
2.0,Size is way off will be sending back. Not made very well at all.
2.0,"Too big for my 5yo daughter’s mouth.  Might be good for adults, but not for younger kids."
2.0,The material is see through & its shorter than pictured. I will give it to my daughter to wear around the house. Save your money!
2.0,"Dress is cute, but material is extremely thin and a little to long. Hits a little below the knee.  Fit is good though so maybe a bathing suit coverup!"
2.0,I’m not sure what we were thinking. This outfit is tacky.
2.0,Was disappointed with the way it was stamped.I let the seller know and he said I wouldn't be charged......not true. The second set is just as in readable.You get what you pay for.
2.0,"I was really excited to get these earrings as bridesmaid presents, but when I got them multiple were broken. There was one pair where the two pieces didn't separate. They were welded together. There were others where the coral pearl wasn't connected to the rest of the earring. I wasn't going to try to glue them together, so I had to return them. The ones that weren't broken were cute, but I wouldn't trust them to last too long."
2.0,The product is totally flawless and gorgeous!!!! The perfect one and better than I expected.<br />But the customer service is  AWFUL. I won't purchase to this seller again. What a shame a very fabulous product is selled bypeople who isn't capable of solve situations with customers abroad.
2.0,"I loved the look of the suit and was excited to wear it! I ordered a size larger than normal, just in case. Unfortunately,  when it arrived,  the torso was too short and it did not fit properly so I had to send it back."
2.0,Cute suit.. Not long enough and therefore didn't fit well.
2.0,"Broke after a couple months of use. Great connection to the watch, but the material didn’t last."
2.0,These fit very snug.  I'm a weightlifter and wanted some workout shirts.  I'm  a true xxl with a 51 in chest.  These were tight and not comfortable for me.
2.0,"I wore this dress for some of my engagement photos. I'm 5'2"" and the dress was the perfect length. However it fit really weird in the bust and was lopsided therefore one side of my bra was showing so I had to use a ton of fashion tape to get it to lay right and not flash anyone. Also the material is SO THIN. You could completely see my butt without shorts on underneath. Also, after trying it on once it got a hole in the seam."
2.0,"The fabric is 100% polyester...it felt like the material used to make umbrellas. It was pretty, exactly as pictured but the fabric is not good. Also I got a medium, I wear 8 or 10 normally, depending on the style - I could have gone down to small because it does run big. Also I thought the dress looked frumpy."
2.0,Clearly you get what you pay for. Very inexpensive and it shows. Already going coppery.
2.0,Skinny material that isn’t big enough for most necks.
2.0,Nope nope nope!<br />This dress looks better off you than on you. The color is gorgeous and that’s about the only good thing I can say about it.<br />It’s clear this is just a cheap imitation of a much nicer dress. Skip this one. It’s not worth it.
2.0,Not as pictured. Was looking for a sleek satin mask to wear for formal. The style of this one was ruined by white thread and mediocre stitching.
2.0,The material was thinner than what I thought it looked like on the picture.<br />Probably great for warmer weather because of how thin the dress was.
2.0,The material is of good quality.  The print is clear and the blouse overall would be perfect if it fits my frame.  It was way too small.  Will fit teenagers better than adults. I gave it to my teenage daughter and it fits her perfect.
2.0,I ordered her regular size not realizing cowboy boots run large but these were 1 size too big.  I DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT I had to pay shipping to return these.  I even called their company to see if they would just exchange them.  the employee was very unfriendly and I ended having to pay the shipping.  I received the other boots and they fit and they were exactly 1 size smaller than she typically wears.
2.0,Upon arrival the necklace gem was very loose. I would not recommend.
2.0,"I bought this discounted for my review, and I was hoping that it would be like the picture. I have a larger head and this is quite large on my. It's also wide than it appears in the photos. I just use it to keep the hair out of my face around the house or while washing my face because I can't really style with it too well due to the thickness."
2.0,"If I had a small head it would be ok.  I have a big mug, not even close.  Made in China, very inexpensive, so didn't mind the risk.  Will give it away to an Oompa Loompa."
2.0,Pin back broke within minutes of receiving. Was able to fix it but disappointed.
2.0,The overall desighn of it was accurate. Just to small and cheap fabric. I gave it to a friend.
2.0,Kinda cheap. Not wayfairer like at all.
2.0,bottoms were too big
2.0,Loved the vibrant colors but the fit was really odd and the socks kept slipping off my baby's feet. Won't buy again.
2.0,Don't like these at all. They are cute but too hard for my 8 year old to put on.
2.0,"Mask is cute but I ordered specifically as description said “M-Shaped Nose Clip”. Ordered two and when arrived neither had the nose clip.  Contacted seller and they did reply with a picture showing the nose clip, which ones I received did not have.  Again advised seller the two I received did not have the nose clip.  They suggested I return for replacement or refund which was fine, but since I needed them for an event there was not time to do so.  I inserted my own nose wire., which I shouldn’t have had to do.  Very doubtful if any of them really have the “M-Shaped Nose Clip” so beware if you really need that as what you receive may not have it.  Other than that material and fit is good and fairly comfortable.  But without the nose clip did fog up glasses."
2.0,"The material was really cheap and seemed thrown together , poor quality"
2.0,had to return .. was huge. cute but a little weird also.. I didn't like the quality. BUT they returned my money with no issue so five stars to that!
2.0,One of three bottles was broken. I emailed them twice asking to replace the bottle. Told them I would send pics if needed. Never heard nothing. Ticks me off that I paid for three and only received two in working condition. The two bottles that weren’t broke work well. I just feel I should receive a replacement bottle for broken one
2.0,I purchased a shirt from this particular brand and LOVED it so that’s why I came back to order more however this shirt and the third one I ordered is not the same material as described and not as good in quality. Not sure I’ll keep it because it’s just not up to the quality of the first order.
2.0,When I ordered them I expected them to be a lot bigger like “over sized” and yet they were very tiny and they broke within days
2.0,"Creí que podía ser un poco más desahoga pero la verdad es que no. Siento que me quedo un poco grande de hombros y las mangas mi hablar, súper largas. No es de mala calidad pero no quedé satisfecha con el producto, lo peor es que que la pedí rosada!"
2.0,"This blouse is okay I guess. If you are typically a size small and have any bust at all, size up. It will be tight across the chest and the whole thing will be too short on you. The sleeves are too short too and they look really awkward. I don't recommend this shirt."
2.0,improperly put together
2.0,I just put these on and there is a spot someone didn't see the seem. :( I haven't tried my second pair yet. But this is a bummer.  So much for the feel that I got brand new clothing.  These are defective.  I have to fix them or send them back. :(
2.0,"This bag is super cute, but I was disappointed when it arrived with obvious scratches and scuffs all over the metal clip that closes the bag. I would it no way want to give something claimed as New to someone that has scratches all over it. Will be returning to hopefully receive one undamaged."
2.0,Sent it Back
2.0,El vestido esta bonita pero queda muy pequeño
2.0,These are adorable (great bright colors and nice sheen durable fabric) but they run really huge!!! My toddler wears a 5 (and I purchased these in a size 5) but these look more like a 7 or an 8! The sizing is completely off. Disappointed that she probably won't fit into these this summer.
2.0,bag has many manufacturer defects and the finishing is too bad I doubt if it's original.
2.0,They look exactly as pictured but they're too thick to fit through a normal sized ear piercing 👂.
2.0,"Cute but runs very small. My daughter is just now merging from 0-3 to 3-6. I ordered the 6 month and it fits like a 3 month. I'm afraid to wash and dry it because if it shrinks any it will not fit. Also, the bbn ow is low-quality."
2.0,"This shirt, though cute, is actually a tee and not a sweatshirt.  I love the simplicity of it and the colors but it just wasn’t what I’d hoped for."
2.0,Not impressed. Fabric itchy.
2.0,The color is not mustard yellow as shown in picture its bright normal yellow
2.0,Poor quality. Stitching and seams fell apart immediately. Shoulder strap  gave way.  Not a week after buying.  You get what u pay for. Stay away from this.  Fit ok though. Otherwise 1 star....
2.0,"Arguably, better looks than the authentic Apple Link band but also unsustainable for the exact reason that makes it more attractive. The buckle closure mechanism which allows it that seemless appearance from the outside delivers a constant jabbing pain when the band is properly adjusted for size, so that the optical sensors of the watch keep contact with the wrist. I knew this would probably be a problem when i first looked at the stock images but figured the share beauty of the piece would outweigh the discomfort. For this, i was wrong. In addition, man hair on my arm go through what equates to a slooow, extended rip waxing session each time i wear the band needless to say, I will be returning it.."
2.0,"I likes this watch alot seeing it online but when I received it the band was a much more reddish brown than what was advertised. Secondly, the watch face looked tarnished n had a few scratches. However it was still more affordable than getting it at a local jewelry store"
2.0,"Let's start with the good.  These are by far the best fitting shirts I have bought in a long time.  I wear a large, and other large shirts just seem to fit too large where I feel like I'm a kid wearing my Dad's shirt.  These fit perfectly.<br /><br />To the bad.  I ordered a few two-packs, and so far, two shirts have either been unwearable or appear to be falling apart.  One of the shirts had some weird glue substance and I couldn't unfold part of the shirt no matter how hard I tried.  It was just dried, caked on glue....washing and tugging on the area would not separate the shirt from itswlf.  The other shirt, the stitching was coming out after just the first wash and some of the hem at the end of the shirt and sleeve just came undone.<br /><br />I'm not completely turned off to this shirt as an option in the future, but these issues may make me shop around."
2.0,I bought this bracelet because I thought it was very pretty and I thought it would hold up very well. I have had it for about 5 months now and the color on the medical alert sign came off in about the first three weeks. The links in the the chain hang on your clothes and your hair and the ones holding the medical id part keep pulling open.  The Medical id part was very easy to scratch with just every day wear. For the price you pay for it you would think it would hold up a little longer.  It looks so bad that I can't wear it now.  I have had to order another one.
2.0,They were cute but I wasn't expecting that there was gonna be 2 of each
2.0,This is one of this get what you pay for item. I should've known better. Cheap all the way around plastic clasp that holds the umbrella open is so flimsy and cheap the umbrella closes at any given time out of the blue!<br />Don't waste your money on this spend a few bucks more for a better trouble free one.
2.0,Fit but looked cheap.
2.0,"The socks look fine, but there was no size options and the pack that arrived was size 35-38. I will send them back and wish there was a size choice."
2.0,"Way to small, overseas sizing so be aware"
2.0,"Dress was sewn backwards. The long seam on the skirt that should appear on the back of the dress, was on the front.  I tried to put the dress on backwards (with the tag on my chest) hoping I could still get some use out of it, but the high neckline in the front and the scooped back looked a bit odd. Also noticed it was a bit crooked. The high waisted shirt did not lay evenly. I kept having to adjust the shoulders to to make it sit properly. Disappointed and returning. Someone in Quality Control completely missed the obvious."
2.0,"Plus size, but the arms are super tight and I bought it bigger so it would be more loose and flowy."
2.0,Only had about 2 weeks and shoulder strap broke off. I can see other stitching coming out. Not built to carry anything remotely heavy.
2.0,"Very pretty necklace, fast shipping, but fell apart after wearing only twice."
2.0,DO NOT WASH WITH ANY WHITES .  The first time I washed it I had some whites along with it.  Big mistake.  All my socks and white tees turned pink.  I guess this should be common sense but just figured id let other know lol
2.0,"And a small size, good for those with small face , but it does not have such a good quality as well , but the price is worth ."
2.0,The prints are very pretty and vibrant but these are huge! I washed and dried them to try to shrink them and they didn’t. I’m pretty crafty so I’m probably going to take them apart and adjust them because I have to wear a mask everyday at work. Good news is they are comfortable around the ears and it’ll be an easy fix with a few minutes with my sewing machine.
2.0,As soon as I unsnapped the mask to take it off it then broke off of the strap. I now don’t have a. Mask for Halloween.
2.0,curved back makes them stick out and sag in ears.  Not good.
2.0,the material peel off the 1st day carry it. It was all over my hands
2.0,"Sizing too small. Sizes are maybe for kids, not adults. Please make it clear"
2.0,it is small than what is expected
2.0,The horn transfer started coming off after one wash
2.0,I wore this once and it broke. Poor quality.
2.0,"I Cant wear these Chinese sizes. Even 4XL doesn't fit right at all. Not a US XL. If you wear L/XL US sizes, stick to brands you know."
2.0,"Great looking watch, I purchased two. one had a dead battery, and one did not work at all.<br />Sorry I s;ent money to have then resized for my wife."
2.0,Very short. NOT compression type gear whatsoever. Definitely not suitable for running/yoga. It would ride up.
2.0,A lot thinner and cheaper looking in hand than in picture.
2.0,"Material is good, but size is very off."
2.0,Product is not what they claim. There is no control top and they are very poor quality. I had runs in my nylon with in 20 minutes of wearing them.
2.0,Cool idea. One side wouldn’t stay clipped.
2.0,I’d like to think my face and my husbands face are “normal” size. These seemed quiet small and work for children better.
2.0,Love the brand just not this style
2.0,"I quit buying socks from the brick and mortar places because they were all paper thin. When I found Wigwams online I tried them and loved them. They were nice and thick and soft, lasted a long time. Just got a 6-pack delivered and they are paper thin. So disappointed because i used to love them."
2.0,"I was intrigued with all the different ways to wear one of these and inspired by the blogs where travelers build a capsule wardrobe around them.  Loved the color of this one and decided to try it.  This dress was very short on me.  I'm 5'8&#34;, 38G.  I can see this working for someone who doesn't need a bra, good luck for the rest of us.  As far as packability, I'm better off with a CowCow dress and coordinating pashmina."
2.0,"Horrible but was cheap, cant be mad completely"
2.0,"Wife says fits nicely all over except in the chest area, button area pulls apart creating gaps. (and not large busted)"
2.0,Looks great!!  Feels GREAT!!<br />8.5 inches long.  UNABLE TO MAKE MAKE SMALL ADJUSTMENTs
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:1c6eaadc24ef4de9e24f789d8fbc6c5b]] I wanted these so badly, finally found them. Bought these , not the cheapest but looked the best. Only they arrived with dark marks, maybe adhesive or something on the areas where it attaches to the sole. I was immediately disappointed so much so I haven’t even tried them on. I realized I’ll never wear them how they arrived. It is on both shoes."
2.0,I liked the dress but it arrived with a almost 5 inch rip through the sleeve :( so I couldn’t even wear it have to try and return it now. Material is thin but colors are pretty
2.0,"This ring looks so cool here! I was so excited, and then when I put it in..you could see the whole bottom ball. It looked so bad, I was so sad because I got my hopes up. I returned it."
2.0,This scarf came with a smell that was very overpowering and it actually felt like the chemical was burning my neck! I would not buy this again.
2.0,They fit to right and are not as warm as I expected
2.0,"I returned it, so 2 stars for an easy return with no issues, but the quality and sizing was poor. It was not a soft or stretchy material."
2.0,Beautiful... but did not fit like a 2xl
2.0,"The sunglasses fit extremely close to the face making my eye lashes rub against the lenses.  The lenses are OK when not in direct sunlight or wearing a hat.  However, the lenses become hazy/smokey when out in full sun overhead.  I guess for under $10 they are OK, but still disappointing based on reviews."
2.0,Stained on headband all the way to back piece  Washed but stain wont wash out  Never inspected before shipping
2.0,"The purse was not this shade of blue.  It was a dusty looking blue,...not at all what I expected, so I returned it."
2.0,"I found the scarf more like a necktie with very nice silk but very thin, perhaps an ascot. I was looking for silk for comfort but also warmth for the Boston winters."
2.0,"Good idea but a bit flimsy when I squeezed in one of my earring stud, the sleeve cracked. The sleeve with my earring didn’t fit through my pierced earlobe, guess it really did expand the earring with the sleeve intact."
2.0,"Over a dozen of these were broken upon arrival, and several more broke when I passed them out or soon after.  The switches on many of the working ones were very touchy or hand to be held instead of switching into place.  These are cheap toys!  So many were broken that I couldn't use them as I had anticipated, but I was able to salvage enough of them to give one set to each of my kids.  They absolutely love them.  The lights are fun for in the dark."
2.0,it's very cute but the print peals off quickly
2.0,"I’m 5’7.75”,  this coat was too long and not thick enough.  It falls below my knees."
2.0,This shirt was to big.
2.0,Nice dress I picked the wrong size and had to send send back
2.0,"Sizing is not true to size. I get this size and smaller in other kinds of clothing. I couldn't even get a sleeve up my arm. Scratchy lace, too. Wish it had worked because I like the look."
2.0,"Its cute and all but after wearing it for a bit, it started to turn my finger green...had to stop wearing it so it was kind of a waste."
2.0,I purchased these for recovery from a lumpectomy but they run small and do not provide enough support for D cups and bigger.
2.0,Uncomfortable and not true to size.
2.0,"In 2012-2014 I bought a dozen pairs of Wee Squeak shoes (the maker of this shoe as written on the sole). They were quality shoes and absolutely adorable!  These shoes from little Mae’s are not quality.  They are adorable, the leather is soft and probably fake and does not irritate my sons foot-even without socks.  The opening tallness is good-even for my wife/tall footed kid whom I have issues getting anything but full Velcro or full tie shoes on.  The squeak seemed weird from the day I got these-but they were purchased a size big intended for summer, bought at Christmas. Anyway the squeaker fell out of a shoe (never happened in the years my daughter wore wee squeak-and I couldn’t find the extra squeakers they sent with.  I got out my daughters shoes and took a squeaker out of her shoe and put into these-the sole is coming loose and the air is escaping rendering the squeak useless.<br /><br />EDIT 6/11/18  I contacted Wee Squeak and they told me this was not their product.  Amazon gave me a contact phone # to Little Mae's."
2.0,"The quality of these glasses seemed fine, but I had to return them because the magnifying area is a high rounded area at the bottom that came up so high it interfered with distance vision.  Might just be me but I have used other bifocal readers that have a flat topped magnifying area with no problem."
2.0,"The “sweater” is tight so sizing is off and it doesn’t stretch so that doesn’t help. The material is so cheap I thought I bought this at one of those 99 cent stores, not dollar tree - they’re an upgrade. The sad part is that I bought 2 of these and wasted $$ on them. I donated both “sweaters” so hopefully someone can get use out of them."
2.0,Item doesn’t fit like it should and the top is poorly made.
2.0,"This was great but when putting it on I knew there was a huge flow, the pins that hold it to the Fitbit just slide in and out, my wife took the band off and the pins are gone.  Bummer because the style of this band is really nice, but as an accessory it just doesn’t work out if you ever want to change the band."
2.0,Beautiful robe but not made for a woman with hips.
2.0,The backs of the earrings are too small. We lost one of the earrings within a week of getting them.
2.0,I bought these to replace my GLASS polarized lenses for my ray bans. These are not even close. This seller made it seem like they were the same cause it popped up when I hit my search.. plastic and glass make a huge difference. I gave 2 stars cause at least they fit but I'm sending them back anyways
2.0,Broke after few wares
2.0,"I love the item, only drawback is the inside lining is hard as paper and tore the first day I used it so now it’s ruined"
2.0,Cute really small
2.0,"The sweater in the photo is NOT the same sweater I got.  The material feels like recycled plastic type material woven into fabric.  The length wasn’t like in the photo either.  I hoped it would be a few inches below the waist line, like mid butt, but it was much shorter.  Not cute like in the photo."
2.0,Only had watch for one month and the band broke.  Would not purchase.
2.0,I don't like the material and I've only wore it twice and still can't get fond of it.
2.0,Pretty much a normal pair of sunglasses I got better polarized sunglasses from the gas station but I got them for 12 bucks and received them in less than 24 hours
2.0,It was tarnished when i received it
2.0,Didn’t care for this.
2.0,Very cheaply made. Would not recommend.
2.0,"The hat I received was nicer then I thought it would be. Nice color, embroidery, flexfit elastic band and structured front but the problem was that it only came in one size (large) and it was too big on me. Could not exchange it for a different size because they did not offer different sizes. The hat did not fit the description in the listing but it was better. To bad they did not offer different sizes then it could have been a five star hat."
2.0,"I am disappointed.<br />I had similar slippers, and I need new one. I was looking for them, and they are too tight , too short, the size is very small , also usually this is my size."
2.0,Very elegant but fit to small.. I ordered &#34;L&#34; size but fit like a &#34;S&#34; :(
2.0,Cheap plastic frame broke on the side.
2.0,"Feels Cheap, Very difficult to attach.  Pretty colors, but it feels very flimsy and its very difficult to attach"
2.0,Very nice sweater; however I ordered my size and it was small. I was disappointed
2.0,"Fits weird. You must. We’d to be very small. I am 5’4”, ordered a large but it’s too small. Fabric is nice, gifted to a niece."
2.0,Sold and marked as a man’s XL.  It is a woman’s vest.  Zipper tells the truth.  Waste if my time.
2.0,"Color too light to be good quality. I thought it had a magnetic clasp, the bracelet was broken in two."
2.0,Unfortunately it's too clingy.  Not as cotton-y as I had hoped...more polyester.
2.0,The material is pretty just not soft even after several washes
2.0,"I was excited to see how many onesies I was getting for the price but, unfortunately when we washed these they shrank significantly. I am talking they went from 3-6 months to 0-3... The prints we're super cute but, because they shrank we ended up giving them to someone else with a newborn."
2.0,Would not buy again. Too small and does not fit as expected.
2.0,The fabric is scratchy and kinda cheap
2.0,Much too small. kinda cheap
2.0,"I hate shoving the soft silicone strap underneath itself, in between my wrist and the strap. That's so annoying to me.<br /><br />On the other hand, it seems to be sturdy and won't easily break or wear out. So, just my personal preference makes me not want to use this strap. It'd be much better if I could secure the excess on the outside like a normal strap."
2.0,"I wore it before it was washed, had a huge allergic reaction on my head and face! Had to rush to the pharmacy to get Benadryl, day 2 still having problem from it"
2.0,I was excited to receive this and wear it.  Then when it came the fabric was very thin.  I returned it because I was worried that after only a few washes it would be noticeably worn so to the poor quality fabric.
2.0,"They fogged my glasses up. Also, they kept sliding off my face."
2.0,"Very pretty bracelet, stones shine with nice color and it looks nice on and fits variety of sizes of wrists. Downside is that my girlfriend wore it maybe two times and two stones have already fallen out. Not happy since it was a gift and it's already falling apart."
2.0,"I really like this suit, but after wearing it once, the underwire is coming out of one of the cups. Disappointing."
2.0,Get them Jun 27 2018 how the sole are splitting open . September 22 2018
2.0,"The shoes looked good and based on the sizing chart, they fit well. One shoe stopped lighting up after 1 day even though my son followed the care instructions."
2.0,the gorilla head is smaller than it looks in the picture and the ring gauge is larger than normal
2.0,Received today and this set is more for a child then a adult. It’s very small. The necklace I can make work but the ring and bracelet are very small. Also the little stones in the necklace are loose. I pray the hold on until my daughter gets thru this one event. I didn’t except much but I hoped it would be better than what it is.
2.0,The bag was very small. Definitely not large like it says.
2.0,"They were really cute, my favorite was the one with the eagle. However, cute as they were they did not last very long. I gave one to my sister and one to my friend. My sister's turned green when water touched it, my friend's turned silver after awhile. I expected that for the price. I would not buy these again, but I am hoping the ones I have left last longer than the ones I gave away. Just something to bear in mind if you are thinking of purchasing: the look nice but don't last long, better of buying one legit ring for the price."
2.0,"Not well designed. Should be adjustable. Had I known this, I would not have bought it."
2.0,Item as described. Received  quickly. Rubber grips won’t hold the ear piece in place and keeps coming loose but love the chain; very sturdy.
2.0,Honestly there was an extra strap for detail the dress did not need. Without it it could’ve been perfect. But I’m not cutting a dress I just bought! Not a seamstress!
2.0,The material feels weird. It’s not a soft cotton
2.0,Nice color and great price but the shape was weird and didn’t fit quite well.
2.0,This is the first time I ordered cork sealer. I didn’t know what to expect. Is the brush supposed to look like this?  I’m not so sure! I put it on my Birkenstocks We shall see...
2.0,Tarnished in the box
2.0,I like how they were thin<br />Do not like how they collect lint
2.0,Came on time. Good for the price but not what I expected. Very thin. I will be returning.
2.0,It was kinda like a shapeless sack....not like the picture
2.0,"I love the way the dress fits and looks, but it arrived with a torn seam. I needed it for an event, so I fixed that seam only to find another tear while wearing it at the event! I just want a replacement and do not want to send it back because I would rather keep and repair than risk not being able to get another one in the correct size after sending this one back. The seller couldn't help because Amazon sent it, and the amazon customer service options are useless. So, be aware that quality could be an issue."
2.0,"fit really nice, but button broke not even after 3 times wearing"
2.0,"It took a while for me to notice the large scratch on top of the stone, but it's visible with a loop or visor."
2.0,"I had to give this away to a friend who is over a foot shorter than I am and far thinner. The sizing info said the Large should have fit me, and it would have: ten years ago."
2.0,"I bought large even though I'm small, due to some reviewers said it runs small and they are right !! It does run small but problem with this product is zipper. After 3 usage zipper broke !!! Very poor quality!!"
2.0,Cloth option mqy have went a long way with a slight adjustment in sizes
2.0,"ok, they don't look as nice as they do in the picture.  The quality is very, very cheap. The ones that have a bead glue to it, are misplaced.<br />Some of them can be enlarge, but the ones that are already shape (with out opening to adjust), they would only fit girl fingers. I guess that some of them are to place in half finger ,as show in the picture, but they are to small even for that.<br />I know that the price was cheap either way, but didn't worth it.<br />I ordered  3 differect set from this seller,  they had arrived the 3 of them in the same shipping package but they still charge for each set as if they were shipped individually.<br />But, they did arrived way sooner than expected."
2.0,It runs very big and the head bow wasnt tied as pictured<br />It had frayed fabric strings along the aide<br />Just not at all what i was hoping for
2.0,"fit over glasses fine, but we're very uncomfortable, it felt like they forgot to add the nosepiece. I'll be sending them back."
2.0,Not what the picture shows.... its not distressed.  Its a regular Sweatshirt.  Its thicker than what I was expecting. Ordered xl.... fits like an xl.
2.0,The fabric is very thin and very cheap looking but when you wear it..it looks better.
2.0,Nice but disappointingly there was a large tear in it upon arrival
2.0,"I love the look of exotic earrings, and these certainly fit that description. However, they were quite uncomfortable and heavy, and they don’t hang right on my ear... When they’re on properly, they look great from the side. From the front, I can only see the back of the earring. Sadly, I’ll probably end up gifting them to a friend."
2.0,Not loose showed my belly folds
2.0,It’s shiny. Perfect for a night at the Roxbury.
2.0,"Well, I like the look and design but the material is so thin I avoid wearing it.  Will probably keep it for gardening or painting,"
2.0,"This product doesn't really look like the picture. It is a bright chrome colored, metal finish, not so much gold looking as in the description. On the inside, it just one elastic band to hold cards on each half of the wallet. It is pretty tough to get any cards out of the thing if you have more than 5 cards in it. Also, Amazon put one of their product barcode stickers right on the front, and it was a pain in the neck to get that off, and there is still residue left over after using rubbing alcohol  on it. I would look for something else."
2.0,Comfortable but stretches twice it's size by the 2nd wearing.
2.0,I gave this sweater as a gift.<br />The receiver loves it.<br />Easy to wear and versatile
2.0,"It’s not as spacious nor did it come round like in the image which was what I was the most excited since I thought it would be cute for it to be round but nope it didn’t come like that but oh well i guess it’s convenient for right now .<br />EDIT: I have figured out where the mistake came from and it may not have been with the company, I think the amazon employee didn’t check to verify if it was the correct thing and I got a wrong product sent to me 🙃"
2.0,It seem the quality of  material is pretty low..
2.0,"Posts hurt my ears. I have very sensitive ears, even 14k gold hurts. Stainless steel and titanium are usually the only metals I can use, but these made my ears feel like they were on fire."
2.0,The mask was beautiful but came broken. I needed it for an event so I didn't send it back. It was a bit heavy as well. 4 stars if it wasn't broken.
2.0,Cute but way too small.
2.0,"Not really happy with this necklace, very tiny"
2.0,"I usually wear a small/medium, and this skirt did not fit right."
2.0,"These shoes were to narrow for my feet, then I waited to long to return , now I'm stuck with them... sucks"
2.0,"The magnet in this is ether really weak or I just found out my nose is the an exact duplicate of the wicked witch of the west. It's thin, doesn't hold well. It has interchangeable ends of balls or spikes. It needs a stronger magnet solution."
2.0,"I've bought several of these for my kids, but for some reason this pair shredded on the top of both feet for my 5yo after uses in 2 pool visits. Not sure why/how this happened and so quickly. No unusual pool activities that day."
2.0,I purchased the dog mask. The one I received was probably 3 times as dark as the picture on the listing. It's hard to tell it's the snout of a dog.<br /><br />It's too bad because I liked the print on picture but the print on the fabric is just poorly done.<br /><br />The stitching at least feels good. +1 star!<br /><br />I'll be returning this.
2.0,"To be fair, the pattern on this dress is truly lovely and I did everything to make it work. I ordered the largest size available, but this dress didn't even cover half my bust. For reference, I am 5'5"", 175, 36 D.  No amount of manipulation or creative positioning could make that dress fit, and trust me, I gave it the ole Kung Fu Panda try.  After about ten minutes of sucking it in and boob yoga posing, I gave this to my 11 year old daughter to try on. It fit her perfect. (Cue sobbing and mental anguish). She didn't want the dress, though, so back into the mail it went. I guess it could have been a swimsuit cover up, but why deny some other mom the same fun i had?"
2.0,"I was expecting a cotton/poly blend, like a t-shirt. I got a shirt that has a label stating it was made in China and recommending dry cleaning for care. No materials are listed, but it is a thin, mildly stretchy “slinky” fabric that feels more like nylon or some other synthetic material. It is a Christmas gift for my kid, but I worry it won’t survive being washed, especially since I don’t know what it’s made of. It also runs really small.<br /><br />Update: they answered my fabric content in the questions and called it nylon. Why then, is it still described as a cotton poly blend in the description? Buyer beware."
2.0,"I like this style very much, but the lace is a bit prickly and uncomfortable"
2.0,The star  Choker really cheap looking ruins the whole look of the necklace
2.0,Dislike that it comes off to easy bottom palm<br />of hand always open it up.
2.0,Love the way they look but they broke
2.0,Picture grossly deceptive!  Satchel would be more appropriately described as a bag. Thin fabric that does not stand on it’s own.
2.0,too tight and the shrunk
2.0,cheaply made u get what u pay for from china
2.0,"I bought this sock brand at a local craft shop a couple years ago. That pair is amazing! Thick, squishy, great fit. The pair I got from Amazon are not the same quality. Lots of great colors but they are loose on my foot, the weave is open enough too see through and they are thin. I love my original pair so I am very disappointed. Perhaps these are a knock off? If not the quality of this brand has gone way down."
2.0,"I never lose my earrings and I lost this pair-one earring while swimming and one earring  in the shower. It’s got faulty posts. The rubber backs it comes with are terrible. I almost lost one while showering and so I changed it to a regular silver one I had and I ended up losing it. So whatever posts I put on it, the original ones it came with or the ones I already had didn’t work. Total waste of money."
2.0,"Looks cheap, very see through. I ordered a black skirt and it came in a navy blue. I’m returning it :/"
2.0,"Very confusing to put on. TSA doesn't even bother putting it back correctly, since it's too difficult."
2.0,"SUPER small, even though I ordered a much larger size. It's very soft, though, so I will probably just wear it around the house."
2.0,"These are so cute! I read and re-read the  description to ensure that I was correct. But, when I received my Orangesky Charm Elegant Angel Ear Cuffs; there was ONLY ONE in the package. I was so completely disappointed!!!! I am hoping that the company will make this situation right and correct the order and possibly send me the correct number of earrings.  I would love to amend this review to a full five stars!!!!!!!"
2.0,Had to send this shirt back because I really was not impressed. The material is rough and cheap feeling to me. The color is cute but not a shirt for me. Even the stitching made it look cheap.
2.0,This hat is for kids! Very small.
2.0,"These are NOT small frames, much bigger than expected, much bigger than the frames Lennon actually wore."
2.0,"No padding what so ever in it. Looks cool, not that’s it."
2.0,"I purchased this as a gift and when I received the bracelet I was disappointed. It wasn't very sturdy, the cross of material was crooked, it was quite small and looked very inexpensive.  I would not recommend."
2.0,They were nice looking when I took them out of the package. I decided to wash them before I wore them and the straps have already begun to unravel.
2.0,"The waist and calf fits perfectly, but the thighs are too small and I can’t pull the pants up All the way. These may be a better fit for a leaner body type. I’m 5’2 and wear a size 8/10, but these are not the right fit for me. A size up would be too big in the waist. The high waist is very comfortable, but the thighs just don’t have enough stretch to accommodate."
2.0,"I have purchased this costume from 3 different sellers. This one is the poorest quality and I will be returning. The hat and dress are badly screen printed, rather than a patch or embroidery. As a result, the hat looks awful straight out of the box. Plan to wear something under it because it’s very sheer.  Also, the “socks” are just red knee highs. The belt is attached to the dress and does not go all the way around.<br />The only thing that stood out as better is the baseball buttons and fast shipping."
2.0,the shape was cute but omg was it ITCHY
2.0,I wear. Large and it’s too small. Others then that they are nice in person.
2.0,"The style of the dress is good, but the color of the purple one wasn't as expected. Will try another color because I do like the fit."
2.0,"My toddler is 19 months and has a normal sized head but wow, this hat runs extremely large.<br /><br />I’m keeping it because the hat is cute, but, we ordered it for a quick family vacation but will have to wait until next summer for it to fit."
2.0,We both laughed out loud when we opened the box and looked at this thing.  Really poor quality for a $30 item.  After we purchased thought to check the other reviews on Fakespot and this listing gets a D meaning a lot of the positive reviews are highly questionable.
2.0,We couldn’t get food inside it was so narrow!  Not at all like converse fit as I was expecting:(
2.0,"Determining what size to order is clearly a struggle for most, or there wouldn't be a hundred questions in the Customer Questions section with people disclosing their dimensions in hope of some guidance.<br /><br />I'm 5'3, 135ish, with an athletic build.<br />In most stores, I'm the perfect example of a medium, and on some days can wear a small.<br /><br />So, it would stand to reason that a medium would work out, right? It doesn't. While the dress fit, it was way too tight for what is known as a size medium. The material clung to my hips and stomach and when I bent over, the dress was so short, you could look up my name and address.<br /><br />This alone wouldn't be enough of a reason for a bad review,  afterall, if I liked the dress so much, why not just size up? Because, the quality of the product itself was poor. The faux velour between the diamonds is poor quality and zipper was so flimsy in comparison to the material itself. My boyfriend and I had a heck of a time trying to get the zipper even up- not because of sizing, but because the velour and sequins constantly made their way into the zipper. Even when the product first arrived and we were trying to get the zipper down, we struggled.<br /><br />And finally, the picture is misleading in a sense. Unless you have a smaller chest, youre going to find less of a flowy overlay on top.<br /><br />It's a shame, because I think the concept of this dress is cute, it's just needs better manufacturing."
2.0,Sad it ran very small.
2.0,"First of all, this is a men's shirt so it looks stupid on women...you know...the sleeveless biker kind of tank.  Yuck.  Second, the lettering is WAY OFF - it is as though the CAMP and the AGNE and the CAMP and the AIGN  are all separate words."
2.0,"Bot enough vision, to small to fit on an adult male. Plastic digs into nose. Might be fine for kids. Did not return just because it comes in a great box :P"
2.0,"It runs huge, the baseball is a hard iron on."
2.0,"Me gusto su diseño, pero es demasiado pequeño, ahora quiero devolverlo , para pedir una talla más y no le da la opción, que puedo hacer"
2.0,cannot unscrew bracelet to put charms on it and no instructions were included
2.0,Not my favorite leggin material they are kinda itchy
2.0,Back pocket started to rip off after only a month and I only wore them a few times around the house!
2.0,Cute but poor quality. Broke after only wearing twice:( I expected them to not be amazing but dang!
2.0,"usually really like dresses from this brand, but the under arm area was HUGE. I'm a 36 C and generally never have this problem. I could pinch out a few inches of excess fabric from each side under the arm. otherwise I like the style and the fabric is a nice light weight material"
2.0,Looked only slightly like the photo. Carving is only on one side and there is a hole through the center. They look much cheaper than the photo.
2.0,"Dress is very pretty, flows very well. Just a slight problem. You can't get the top to close over your chest. At all. Unless you want to be arrested for public indecency. I bought a large, 5'4"" 150lbs, 36B chest. The only way you could wear it is with a tank under it, which ruins the look. I wish it would have! I loved the dress :("
2.0,"Took over a month to get it, and it arrived with the zipper broken. Didn't want to send it back overseas to replace. I could get the zipper somewhat together but it doesn't close completely. I do not recommend as there are plenty of other case options to choose from instead."
2.0,Looked very cheap in person
2.0,"Conventional 2bytes color portable game type, without Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections, without memory and without updates, Isn't a SMART WATCH, although my daughters liked it... maybe because they respect me."
2.0,"These were larger than expected, originally purchased for my nose but since it was too big I placed it mid bottom lip, it must’ve broke skin because it left a scab only after having it on for a couple of hours"
2.0,"When I first received the dispenser it worked very well and I was very happy with it. However, after 2-3 months it only works sporatically. Perhaps it needs to be replaced. ?"
2.0,Ran small. Words on shirt were stiff. Disappointed.
2.0,Loved it but the string frayed and broke after 3 months and beads went everywhere.
2.0,Small and not so well made
2.0,dimensions are much smaller than expected
2.0,"This bag was too small for my 15&#34; MacBook Pro.  It barely fit inside, and the way the top of the bag is constructed, it would be a struggle to get it in and out of the bag easily."
2.0,I ordered size medium and it looked like a large. Was so wide with balloon sleeves. Had to return the same day as I received it :/
2.0,"I was very disappointed in  this shirt, the material is very thin when compared toother brands.  It wrinkles easily, the shrinkage is slightly more than otherbrands.  I am giving this shirt two stars only because of the pattern.  Save your money and buy a better brand."
2.0,One of the earrings was missing the whole hook for me to put in my ear.
2.0,"Runs too small. If you're at the upper end of the size range, go up one size."
2.0,Actually hard to figure out.  Still not sure if I get it on correctly.
2.0,The needle is way too long & sharp. Why are earring needles now a days liking like sewing pins?
2.0,This looked nice but it is not safe. On two occasions I found that the band unclasped itself with minimum effort. The last straw for me was when my watch fell of my wrist. Luckily it was in my backyard but could’ve easily been anywhere. Do not recommend this band because it doesn’t stay secure on your wrist.
2.0,"I am returning this wallet, not because it is not nice, but because as great a design as this is, it has one flaw that I can't get past:  if you actually USE all the fabulous card holders, you can't snap the wallet closed!  If they would extend the strap with the snap closure so that you could close the wallet securely when the wallet is full, I would be happy to buy it again."
2.0,"Product is not of good material, feels spongy! Do not like"
2.0,"These at first look will get you excited to sport the Vans skate look for the purpose of keeping your grip in snow and icy condition. The foot in the actual shoes section is quite comfortable. However, despite the cool looks, the extended ankle support feels awkward and unnatural compared to any snow shoe or boot Ive worn. It almost comparable to a snowboard boot but with the ankle a bit more upright. I tried them on at Sun and Ski Sports prior to my decision to pass on these shoes."
2.0,I didn't sent it back
2.0,The jacket size small fit my 12 year old granddaughter.  The material is very thin.  The pocket was ripped on the inside.  I would not order this item again.
2.0,"Really loved the beads initially, but ruined my shirt sleeve and beads when I got caught in rain.  I had noticed a light stain on my clothing when I wore them before the rain, I really hate that they were damaged."
2.0,Material was soft and comfortable but fit much smaller than expected.
2.0,"They are good but run big , and don't fully protect from wind as they are supposed to.."
2.0,The bands where really neat but because they are not cut into the rubber the decal is already starting to come off. I would not buy these again. It was a ok stocking stuffer but not more than that.
2.0,The shirt looks a lot nicer in the picture - its a very ordinary piece- disappointing. The material is flimsy and the corduroy rather thin.<br />The color is also not accurate
2.0,Color is pretty and the material is very soft. Unfortunately it’s extremely long and clung to my body in weird places. I can’t even imagine how long it would have been if I would have sized up to accommodate the clinginess.
2.0,"I'm crushed that I had to return this -- it's so fierce and awesome looking and totally ""me.""  But I was shocked that it just didn't fit right at all and looked kind of stupid honestly.  See my pics -- the zipper on the back bunched up and looked all wavy and weird.  Plus it runs big actually -- the sleeves weren't tight despite me having pretty big/fit arms.  I wanted this to look like painted on and incredible but it totally didn't.  I have other Koral tops in Large and they fit amazingly, but this one wasn't even close to perfect, so for the price I had to return it.  I've bought a couple crop tops recently and when I saw this I knew I had to treat myself, but sadly it just didn't work out.  It's too bad because it's so sexy and fun looking.  Argh!<br /><br />I don't get anything for writing this review by the way, just trying to be helpful."
2.0,Size runs too big. Buy a size lower.
2.0,"The shape and size of these shorts was exactly as described but I really didn't like the fabric. It was very stiff and matte. It definitely wasn't the shiny, rayon-ish fabric shown in the photos.  I ended up returning them."
2.0,Will not wear.it constantly tangled. Cannot keep straight. Threw it away.
2.0,Not as expected z little flimsy
2.0,Very cheap sunglasses. Nice to keep in the car as a backup pair or useful while running. I would recommend to anyone that needs a few backup pairs.
2.0,It is much much smaller than I expected. Can't even make out the images on the darn thing. The colors are nice though.
2.0,"I purchased this for $15.  I didn't expect that it will be a great quality but for $15, I dont expect to be this low quality.  I would only pay $5-7 for this hat in a normal situation.  Only good thing is the product delivered within a week, comparing to other faceshield hats that take a month to be delivered."
2.0,"The sweat pants themselves are great and I originally would have given them a 5 star review. The issue I have is after a few washes, the glitter writing down the leg is all but gone and is only faintly visible and look 10 years old. Bummer because I really liked these pants."
2.0,"I very much loved the idea of this mask for my Halloween costume and maybe expected too much from it. The strap on the top fits fine around my head, but the one for the back of my neck (bottom strap) is way too big, leaving the whole rest of the mask too uncomfortable for my face (I have sort of a small face). The chin area is way too big as well and it would be expected that a person with a long face would wear this. I wish that there were sizes to choose from, because who knows what size mask you're going to get or if they are all the same size. I just have to fix mine I guess to help fit the size of my head. I like the quality, but again think I expected too much....<br />Take this into consideration, please and thank you."
2.0,It's a very pretty dress but to see through.
2.0,"It's really cute unfortunatly the fit is like an XS, I got a size M since I'm a size 4 normally and usually fit S-M but this bikini did not come close to it :("
2.0,The fleece lining is thin and not suitable for winter warmth
2.0,"I like the hat but the small is too small and a large is too large. I'm 5'4"" and don't really have a huge head. I like the style tho so i kept it. Ok for the fall season but i would get something warmer for winter."
2.0,Not a fan of this. Not as cute on me as I hoped.
2.0,Very soft and thin but way too small and would fit a child.
2.0,where stiff and not spongy and comfortable like most wedge flip flops.  Too bad because they are cute
2.0,"Originally, I loved this band, but after a month of daily wear, the elastic started popping out and it looks scruffy.<br /><br />I’ve never had one last such a short amount of time."
2.0,looks very artificial.
2.0,Ordered rose gold but it doesn’t really match the Fitbit Versa rose gold. It also doesn’t come with pins to attach it to the Fitbit so I removed pins from another wrist band . This band is very difficult to attach and don’t feel confident it will stay attached. Although it is pretty I wouldn’t recommend this product
2.0,i lost a credit card that fell out so I went back to my old leather wallet. The slipperiness of the plastic and that I happened to have just one card in the lost meant it must have fallen out.
2.0,Wouldn’t stick all around. It poked out from all different areas. I had to keep pushing it on during my wedding. Was poking out all around
2.0,Cute graphics but fabric and image are cheap. I could do this on my own if the graphics were available for purchase.
2.0,"I liked the design and look of this purse so I bought it after looking at it and several others. I really enjoy the shoulder strap, but after using it for a month, one of the seams has started to come undone and the attachment site of the handles is starting to fray and tear. I love the design, but the quality is not satisfactory.<br /><br />If you change purses a lot maybe this is a good buy. But if you're like me and you stick to one purse until buying another, this isn't the one for you."
2.0,IF YOURE GETTING THIS FOR A FACE COVERING... DONT! IT WONT STAY OVER YOUR NOSE UNLESS YOU PULL IT UP OVER THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD. ITS VERY LOOSE AND THIN MATERIAL. 2 STARS FOR DESIGN -3 FOR USE AND FUNCTION
2.0,It is hard to breathe in the mask .  I have tried to adjust the sides. I have tried it with and without the filters.  I was so excited when I purchased it because I stand with my people but the design of the mask is not the mask.  I find myself taking it off to breathe and that defeats the purpose of wearing a mask. I will keep this one just for show.
2.0,"The actual stud is fine and seems to really be titanium and all, but the gem fell out in the first week"
2.0,"Pants themselves seemed well enough made, but they were way too small. I bought the size my husband normally wears, and these were like two inches from being able to zip, let alone wearable. Given the way they fit, I'd say buy at least one size bigger than you normally would, maybe two (and yes, I did check the size chart). Anyway, returned them."
2.0,The shirt says Christmas watching BLANKET? 😂😂
2.0,"I got this as a gift (but picked it out myself!) a few months ago. It has so many positives, but the wrist strap, which I didn't even use that often, tore off. It left a fuzzy, beige spot and is not hugely noticeable but definitely takes away from this wallet. It holds up well otherwise, and I am really happy with the amount of space, coin purse, etc. An iphone can also go inside and zip up if you don't have it in a case or if your case is very slim."
2.0,Looks funny on.  Fits funny.  I like the color.  Just looks dumb on
2.0,Seems cheap. I bought other brands that were warm and much better looking. Not terrible but cheaply made.
2.0,"CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP. The material is oddly thick and just looks beyond cheap. I ordered this dress for a Maui vacation and wouldn't even take it with me as a beach-use dress because of the quality. I kept it to bum around the house/yard - I'll never wear this in public.<br /><br />*I didn't expect a top quality dress as the price was reflective of the (assumed) quality - but man, this one is bad. I've ordered a couple dresses off Amazon and this one is garbage. Don't waste your money.<br /><br />It is good if you're tall (I'm 6'1&#34;) and just want a bumming around the house outfit."
2.0,the top is big but the small is very small. its weird.  I bought a Medium and the top fits like it looks on the model but the bottom of the shirt is really small and tight. i haven't worn it out and I've had it for over a year
2.0,This caused an itchy irritation under the strap. I'm guessing sweat or water got trapped. It caused my skin to be red and itchy.
2.0,beautiful shirt just disappointed in the size.
2.0,These are bigger than I expected. The &#34;stones&#34; were loose in the settings. Ok earrings if you want a large stud.
2.0,It looked great before I washed it!  The material is very cheap!!
2.0,"Make sure you look at the size chart and order way larger. Actually, don’t order these at all. These are cheap crap from China, which I did not realize until I had ordered them. They have no compression effect and all of the materials are poor quality. Don’t waste your money!!"
2.0,not really my style.
2.0,Got these for my husband (men’s shoe size 10) and they are waaaay too small. These are definitely kids’ sized!
2.0,"Easy to remove links.  Very difficult to put on as the slots fit the pins are upside down, shop you have to hold them in a very awkward manner to keep the pins from falling out<br />Nice looking."
2.0,"I ordered an XL - I typically wear a Large. I try to size up when uncertain. I got  a green shirt, nice color and fabric is ok, however it is skin tight. In an XL - which is a size up for me- this is so disappointing. I took a picture of the sleeve- the cap sleeve is nice- but I will spare you the full body picture- it looks like a leotard it’s so tight. Lol. Size up 2-3 sizes if you purchase this shirt and you will be fine."
2.0,Cheap looking . Returned.
2.0,Very cute and fit nicely but turned green within a week :(
2.0,the chain broke before i even had a chance to wear it once.  cheaply made.
2.0,"When I received it some links were already copper color, I try to clean it I but nothing change, it means to me is not a solid sterling silver,"
2.0,"My favorite bamboo mask was wearing out, so I saw this deal and thought it would be a great buy. Wrong. First, it feels like cotton. Second, I felt tiny fibers rub against my face the entire time. Drove me crazy. The ties are white, on the darker mask and I don't love that. I got something on it the first day-which is not their fault, but still annoying. I have a smaller face and the mask just fits. The protective case is nice. The ties are a good feature."
2.0,"Too small, will give away to small person. Not satisfied with purchase, but you win some and you lose some."
2.0,I don't like to write bad reviews but I will if there is a legitimate reason to.  This helmet is a disaster.  It is flimsy and totally unprofessionally made.  Everything about it is crooked and the led lights don't even work.  This isn't even a helmet.  A helmet holds it's shape.  This is a thin rubber mask that fits over your head.  Its awful.  Don't waste your time or money.
2.0,"The top part seemed really high and the bottom was very clingy. I felt if I sized up the armholes would be too big, though."
2.0,I ordered a large and had to give it to my friend's 10 year old daughter.  Way too small.
2.0,Weren't exactly what was advertised as they were missing the heart on top therefore not making them dangle style. I received stud style instead. They're cute though.
2.0,"These socks are very thin. I was looking for some regular somewhat comfortable crew socks. These are thin, almost nylon like. They would be fine for summer socks I guess, but not for winter in the northeast. Very disappointed. These socks should be better described to warn people. I am only giving them 2 stars because, as I said, you could probably wear them in the summer and get some use out of them. Otherwise...nope!"
2.0,pretty but small.
2.0,It looks exactly like the picture but run extremely small. I ordered a 10 more like a 8
2.0,OK shirt but they really are not US sized.
2.0,"the pads are really really awkwardly shaped,  very unnatural.  not a fan"
2.0,They are really nice and make the ps4 look even beter but they have the big problem that onve the ps4 heats up it makes the design kinda get hot and sribble up and i have to keep wiping it with the cloth and even then it still doesnt look good it has lots of wrincles on it.
2.0,Odered an XL...must be a children's
2.0,"You get what you pay for. I ordered this bag in the brown/black color and my friend ordered it in blush. She got the bag and it arrived damaged. The leather like coating on the straps was coming off. She got a replacement, same thing but smaller. My straps also had issues, which leads me to believe the straps are faulty or just poorly made. I've included pictures of my strap issues. The straps are also maybe a half an inch too short to wear the bag comfortably as a shoulder bag. The size of the bag with the length of these straps is awkward.<br />This bag is bigger than I expected. I've included a photo of it near my face for size comparison. Due to all these issues I'm returning it. Hopefully they will fix the issues because the design of this bag is cute, I just didnt like it as a crossbody and was unhappy with the defects."
2.0,Not such a great assortment.
2.0,Very disappointed with this case. Bought it as a gift for my daughter and paint peeled after 1st week of use. My daughter is 14 and only has her phone on her after school for sports so no real wear and tear to wear off the paint.
2.0,Not impressed with this product. Ordered the size glove I wear & these are way too large. I feel I wasted my money. No compression pain relief. Sad face
2.0,Put them in the wash and when I pulled them out the back pockets were ripped up to the waist. Now I gotta see them back together somehow cause I don’t waste money spent.
2.0,Gold finish appears cheap.
2.0,"This was not a great purchase. The color was way off, it was more of a green than the traditional “softball yellow”. The fabric quality seemed good though. Just not what I was looking for."
2.0,Doesn’t really look like the picture. And the sleeves are short.
2.0,"Runs REALLY small!! I ordered a medium and should have gotten an extra large. I am 5'2&#34; and 135lbs, it's small, I gave it to my sister in law who is 5' and weighs 95lbs and it fits her perfectly. Order 2 sizes up! But is well made and good material and arrived in 2 days as expected."
2.0,I liked the shirt but had to return it because it came with a hole in it
2.0,I have worn Ericka shorts for years and liked the fit and fabric. These last two pair were smaller than they normally were by at least one size. The fabric was also thinner than the others.  What happened to quality?
2.0,The leftovers from the manufacturing process left a sharp edge of rubber on the strap between the first and second toes. I had to trim it with my utility knife and a fresh blade before it was comfortable enough to wear.
2.0,I bought this hoping to wear it to my wedding. It arrived missing a stone and when I tried it on it just fell sideways because the stones are raised too high. so when you wear it it will not sit right and the stones will be laying on their side.
2.0,"COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT - UNDIES and BRA will be EXPOSED!<br />Aside from that, it's a very nice dress.<br />I ordered a small and surprisingly it fit well. My only other complaint is the bust area bunches outward (and I'm busty). It is the perfect length for me and the bride chose the dress over 4 others.<br />My dimensions:<br />Height: 5'1<br />Weight: 115<br />Bust: 36D<br />Ordered Small Pink (Its a very saturated  pink) - Fit almost perfectly"
2.0,Description never said it was Naylon<br />It's very lightweight. Doesn't hug you excessively.
2.0,"Beautiful color and style, but the waistline of the dress was cut too short"
2.0,"This hat ether runs big or my BF has a small head but it didn’t fit him, had to return."
2.0,They are HUGE! and heavy...I will try to give them away.
2.0,The little “diamonds” fell of pretty quickly
2.0,"stylish and cool, and I love the snap on the back but they leaked. I could not get the right fit so I gave them away"
2.0,Its broke :( but it was just want i was looking for.
2.0,Too big for a regular person
2.0,I thought these connected and I am very disappointed. Feel like this was a waste of money and wished I had not purchased.
2.0,"I was so thrilled to order this. It got here just in time for New Year’s Eve! I put it on, and the fit was fantastic. But then... I noticed the edges were all very frayed. It does not have a clean finish and looks like it will fall apart. I will be sending it back."
2.0,Just fits odd
2.0,"This shirt is cheap material, a little on the rough side, short on length for me, and it’s very boxy looking. It doesn’t give me any shape."
2.0,Almost a full size too big. Wound up returning it.
2.0,"I was looking forward to receiving this, but was disappointed.  It's box shape and was too big.  The fabric was much lighter in weight than I expected.  Returned."
2.0,This is more for larger women. I just wanted a cheap suit to wear in my backyard pool. Going to keep it but won’t be wearing it in front of any one
2.0,"Looks great, second time it opened the spring jumped out and has never been found again! Might want to tack the spring in place for this to be a useful product"
2.0,"It's on the ""cheap"" side, and the tires often untie."
2.0,I bought the band back in January. The gems are still all their. However the watch band pins come out easy. A little to easy. I was in my car getting my seat belt and the pin came out. I found it changed the pin to a new one. Cleaning my kids room lost the darn pin again.  It is a beautiful sparkling watch just really sucks you have to be careful.
2.0,Zippers are hard to open. The storage spaces are to small
2.0,"I loved these when my son first put them on, then one day at the pool and they are snagged and look terrible"
2.0,Turned my finger green within a week of wear.
2.0,"Cute style, fit was expected for the size but the material is cheap.<br />This dress arrived and I tried it on and I could tell the exact color (nude, nothing that should have been obvious like a print) of my bra and the pattern of my underwear, it’s practically see-through, which made the dress totally unwearable. I returned it."
2.0,"Cute product but proportions are completely wrong. Got a size medium which is what I normally wear. However, while the waist fits well, the chest is too tight, and the sleeves are too big. The buttons are spread our so far apart that the fabric between bulges out when it shouldn't. I feel like the chest part is going to kill me because of how tight it is (I'm a 36B so not big). I wish I could send it back but sadly I'm outside of my time frame. What a waste of money and good fabric."
2.0,"I wore it for a day, and it broke off at the loop. I'm rating it three- instead of one-star just in case I don't know how rowdy I actually must be in order for that to happen."
2.0,"I got these to wear at my wedding and found out when they arrived, they are really unattractive when you wear them.  They were not as comfortable as I was hoping either."
2.0,"They would stay attached to my safety glasses.  The view was ok, but didn't stay stuck."
2.0,"I'm about 5'1 and weigh 140. Igor a size Large because I have big breast (38D) but it was too small! The bathing suit itself was cute though! I do have to mention the straps are placed weird, they are really close together"
2.0,"These are very comfortable and the heel height is perfect; however, they are very loud when walking and sound like horse hooves on the ground...really the only draw back."
2.0,"One sock is bigger than the other, they do not fit perfectly. It stinks because one side is tighter than the other."
2.0,All you need know is your backside will be exposed as soon as you get into bed. You should wear this as a long PJ top only
2.0,Not the same item
2.0,"I bought the medium for my tween who normally wears a  ladies small or juniors medium. I already sized up to be on the safe side and looks like I should have ordered her a large. While pretty, this was REALLY snug."
2.0,Order one size larger as they are not true to size
2.0,"Not a snug fit, doesn't stay on well"
2.0,Had to return it. It was too small.
2.0,"The opal crystal fell out within two weeks.  If not for that it is absolutely adorable.  If you buy one, you may need to add super glue to the crystal and cap."
2.0,These shorts are not well made. Pockets fell off and stitching came apart after two washes. Don't waste your money on these.
2.0,"Some of them have the nose wire sticking out or poking out of the material. Poorly made and very sharp, just have to be cautious my lil one doesn't get hurt when bending it. Other wise nice material."
2.0,"I love the fact that it is RFID however I have had 3 of these and all 3 have either broke or come apart., looking for an Alternative!"
2.0,"Sizing off and chart didn't work for me. I'm 5'3"", weigh 152# and measure 43"".  Size XL was a poor fit. Too snug thru chest and way too long in arm and body length. Nice fabric and flattering style and color.  Good for Fall and Winter dressing. Sadly, must return."
2.0,this one is too large .. for those who wear Large on other clothes in this one u should get Small size
2.0,"Meh. I purchased shoes extremely similar to these at a big box retailer years ago and couldn't wait to get these in because those lasted forever. When I tried them on, they already felt like that were stretched out and the bottoms felt extremely flimsy. I would return but don't want to go out of my way."
2.0,This shirt is so cute! But the size runs one size smaller. I got my son a 4T for our disney land trip. (5T is too big for him) but the 4T is like a 3T!! I am so bummed since we leave to disney land in 11 days. It is possibly too late to order a larger size!! 😕👎🏻
2.0,"This is such a soft, comfy dress… the color is vibrant … it was just way too thin to wear to the event at church for me unfortunately."
2.0,There were visible lines on the pair that I received.
2.0,Great looking but funny fit. I had to return it because it was very awkward.
2.0,Something made for men and women both does not fit right.
2.0,Very thin and runs extremely small.  Too bad because the image is cute.  Comes from China so be prepared to wait weeks to get it.  Not worth returning.
2.0,"I love these jeans and ordered a pair of these and they were great.  Then ordered again in March 2022 and got a pair that had cuts and scrapes in it as if very poor material.  Returned and reordered.  AGAIN, looked almost just like other.  Returned and tried a third time -- same poor quality material.  So I quit.  Hoping that Amazon changed manufacturers or suppliers and because I really wanted another pair, I tried again this month, almost a year later.  Nope.  Got tears in it again.  AND THESE ARE NOT FASHION TEARS, but tears and shredding as if you had done major construction with them and gotten them snagged."
2.0,This run small so be careful when you purchase the size I'm not sure about the comfort it seems cute but I'd liked the loose look
2.0,There were a lot of 5 Star ratings here; I wish I'd listened to the one rating that told of how the BLUE WASN'T... But it was just one such reviewer...and the photo WAS the exact blue I was looking for... It's not lapis either. I will be returning these.
2.0,"I didn't read the reviews so sizing would be an error on my part, however, the material used is transparent!!!"
2.0,"Very cute, but sizing needs to be narrowed down. It is so huge on my 4 month old daughter and she is already in the 90th percentile for her age. The onesie might fit her when she is a year old, but then the skirt may be too small. We’ll have to wait and see I guess."
2.0,Does not match the picture of the lady wearing it. The bottom band is to tight for a one size.
2.0,Very heavy but the gold color of the necklace makes it look cheap.  I am returning this.  Was not happy
2.0,"It runs a size small if you are ok with the short being leotard-like. Which might be ok, because the skirt is quite full. But size up two or three sizes if you want actual shorts underneath. The fabric is awful, like halloween costume material, and the pattern looks less luxe and classy in person."
2.0,I did some work in a -10F freezer and under 30 minutes I could not continue working because my fingers were too cool.
2.0,The leggings were okay but the description said a 3 pack and I was only sent 1. That was one of the down falls. And they are pretty sheer when you have them them on.
2.0,"Feels like I'm wearing a box. The jacket is way too wide at the bottom. Cold air blows up into jacket. The hood is too large also. When cinched, it covers my eyes preventing me from seeing. Not satisfied with fit at all."
2.0,This product is not the slim cognito that  I purchased from Sara Blakely.
2.0,The arms seemed short on my eight year old niece. It’s light weight compared to most jerseys.
2.0,"It’s small, and shrinks after laundry even more. The pajamas are tight and difficult to put on. Order bigger size."
2.0,"Very nice looking watch for the price.  However, I was not able to change the time using the crown.  I was able to change the date By turning counterclockwise till the correct date shown.  The instructions did not include my model. It included seven models for chronograph. I’ll try to deal with this malfunctionu"
2.0,Returned… This is an amazingly thin fabric that will never retain any shape.  The logo looked nice though..
2.0,Side stiching fell apart after putting them on for the first time.
2.0,"I loved these studs when I initially received them. After about only three weeks and about ten wears, the crystals started falling out. They don't look good enough to wear now. Thankfully, I found a similar pair for a couple dollars less at a jewelry party sponsored by Park Lane. They look more realistic and have a lifetime warranty. I would not buy these again."
2.0,These slippers are so cute . I am just so very sorry they did not fit. They were way too small. So sad.
2.0,It's a little smaller than the size it stated. A little disappointed. Thought it was a little bigger.
2.0,This is not a sterling silver chain!!! I can only wear real sterling or gold everything else gives me a really bad rash.<br />  The only thing I can give it is it's pretty.<br />  To bad it's not as advertised.
2.0,"The material, while soft and warm, must be of poor quality.  My daughter only wore it a few times and both the top and the bottom started coming apart at the seams.  I tried to return it but I missed the return window.  :("
2.0,It was cheap and thin and almost fell apart the first time I washed it..... very disappointed!
2.0,Very stylish looking sun glasses but poor quality!!<br />I had to return them too bad!
2.0,Alot smaller than expected. And the straps are crappy and short
2.0,Although this is a beautiful dress it doesn’t fit as indicated.
2.0,I bought these for my son to wear with his Halloween outfit. He was excited to get then soon as he got them he wanted to try them on so we did. But that were issues come in play. My son is 9ye old and yes these say compression socks but at that age we should have been able to get them on. With ton of work we get them over the foot but couldn't pull them up to even his calf. I thought maybe if I washed them it would help but did not and that's why I didn't send them back. So for us it is a no
2.0,"Dont warm up that much plus takes a,long time to dod so"
2.0,Sorry looks cheat will not wear😩
2.0,"This was a super fun costume but it ran a bit too small. Also, on the packaging, the picture shows striped socks but plain white socks came in the set."
2.0,"The sizing chart was completely wrong for this item.  It should have been clear that the item runs small.  I wear a small in just about everything and this thing is tiny!  Way tiny.  There's no tag in it so I don't know if I was shipped an x-small, but that's what it seems like.  I pulled it out of the bag and thought &#34;Oh my, is this for a child?&#34;  Considering what it is, I sure hope not.  I got this at a discount through AMZ Review Trader and it was really cheap so I won't be bothering to send it back to China.  The material is pretty soft which is nice.  Too bad it's made for tiny Asian people and they didn't mention that in the information.  I'm 5' 0&#34; and about 120#."
2.0,Donated since it runned too small and not well done. Wouldn't buy again.
2.0,This shirt was way smaller than it should have been. I thought I had put on one of my younger daughter’s shirts. I usually wear an XL in tops to cover my long arms and body. The XXL I ordered was extremely tight across my bust and I am not know for being busty.
2.0,It’s like wearing a bag. I was excited about getting it because they look very comfortable and flattering on the models but not on me. Wish there were some kind of structure to it.
2.0,I can’t see through the plastic mask and it’s very hot!
2.0,Cheap...was delivered to me bent and the lens feels like it's going to pop out the frame. Don't waste your money if you want something with longer wear capability.
2.0,"Simply put, these are the smallest earrings I've ever seen!  I was expecting these to be a normal adult stud-size, but when they came, it appears they may be better suited for infants.  They came packaged in a plastic bag, with no hang tag or gift box -- so these certainly aren't suitable for gift-giving, unless you feel like hunting down your own box.  The earrings came with two sets of backs, one rubber, one silver.  My other disappointment was that the &#34;moon&#34; earring was rounded at one end and looked less like a moon and more like a swoosh. If you look at the item photos, there are two different styles pictured, one where the moon is more rounded, and one where the moon is pointed and actually looks like a moon -- I received the more rounded look.  I attempted to return these and was told it wasn't eligible for return.  I contacted amazon customer service and explained that these were very much different than I expected, and they refunded my money.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for leaving my HONEST review."
2.0,Super small and came in with a broken headband.
2.0,"Magnet for the clip is much too weak, will hold maybe 10 bills tops, no way it holds 30 bills as advertised.  Very poor choice for Amazon to have as an Amazon Choice."
2.0,It’s cute but It tarnished fast
2.0,"The buttons are sewn on crooked which looks weird. When you try to arrange the dress to align the buttons, the rest of the dress looks crooked. If you were to wear the dress normal, then it’s really obvious that the buttons are crooked (and not in a trendy, cool way) because the skirt part doesn’t align quite right."
2.0,"The length from shoulder to under bust is very short, making this very uncomfortable to wear."
2.0,"Great idea, but leaves thumbs exposed to weather when mitten covers are used. Next time I'll get a pair with only 4 fingers cut out"
2.0,"Got the reaction from my nephews that I wanted, but I can't wear it again because it was too small"
2.0,"Didn't last long. Worn twice and they look a year old. Also, they were tinted pink."
2.0,Very thin and lightweight.
2.0,Too short and pretty boring. Wasn't able to return it in time...guess I'll be gifting it to someone who doesn't have a large chest.
2.0,It’s fake and looks cheesy. My “pearl” has 3 indents down the middle of it that look like it was made in a machine. Necklace is kid sized.<br />Plus the shell just crumbles in your hand trying to get it open.<br />I guess this would be good for kids.
2.0,"Nice hat, super cute- but they sent purple instead of the grey that I ordered"
2.0,"The watch looks like the same color, blue, but it seems to be a lot darker black and is not no where<br />as predominant as shown in the picture. Little disappointed.."
2.0,"Too small,  neff symbol in the way"
2.0,It cute if only it would stay on.  The buckle is impossible to latch but after you do it quickly opens up.<br /><br />I would have super glued it together and made the belt smell once I had it on.  But I have to tightened it so much that their is a noticeable bulg.  But there are lots to choose from on Amazon so I will return and buy another.  (I use skills belts with dresses).
2.0,Thin material and you can see through it
2.0,not too big or too small just not ment for a womans body.<br />I am average build wear a 8 or 6 but this fits ok but rides up.
2.0,I only use the bottoms anyways.
2.0,I dislike the size and the width
2.0,Its a plastic moonstone ugh
2.0,Pendant as lovely as shown in photo but disappointed  in the rope part
2.0,"I am usually a medium or large. I bought the largest size of this sweater, and it really a small or extra small. My daughter, who is reliably a medium, was unable to wear this. I believe the sweater is made for children. Having said that, it looks nice. Returned the item because I don’t know any young child who could wear it."
2.0,"Very cheap, fell apart after one washing!! Oddly shaped as well."
2.0,"The boots are very comfortable, but I've only had them for a month and the elastic part that goes around thr button on both boots is broken."
2.0,"The shirt runs small... so order at least two sizes larger. Also, the sleeve stitching seam is supposed to be down by the wrist, the one I received has the stitching seam on my bicep. Trying to return but it’s not giving me the option at the moment. Color is nice, and material is soft. It’s just not what I wanted."
2.0,To put on. It literally will fall off your wrist. Not secure enough.
2.0,This is way too large. Can I get a smaller?
2.0,"Cute but felt  a bit small, little snug on face... and I am a normal  size person...probably won't use them. :("
2.0,seem to be too large maybe downside a size
2.0,"Gorgeous color--exactly as pictured, so I had high hopes. The bottom portion fit well, but this suit wasn't long enough. I have a longer torso & shorter legs but overall am only 5'4&#34;. Even tied as tight as possible, the cups were a couple inches below my actual boobs. If better proportioned, this would have been very flattering."
2.0,I ordered milk tea and waited longer for it to arrive. I ended getting the yellow color. I hate the hassle of returning. The fit was fine. I’m a 7.5 and the 7.5/8 fit great.
2.0,the top coat peeled off within a week
2.0,Returned this product because it was cheaply made. The top was too big and the pants a little more snug than I like.
2.0,"This is a handsome watch band and looks slick.  It's easy to get on and off and easy to adjust.  My complaint is that the band is held on by magnets.  This is great for adjusting and getting on and off.  However, it does stick to my computer and sometimes picks up paperclips etc.  Minor annoyance really and even a little amusing.  The bigger problem is that one set of magnets pull off if they stick to the other set.  And they do this a lot.  Because, well, they are magnets.  So, a set of magnets pulled off the second day I wore this then I had to pull the stuck together magnets apart which is actually not easy, then restick them to the right places.  The little seal around them immediately fell off and was impossible to put back.  I might try to superglue the magnets in their little case so they can't pull out as easily but I'd rather not have to immediately do improvements.  Also, the black starts to wear off pretty quickly.  Overall, for the price, a good deal but is far too ""disposable"" for my taste."
2.0,Not for COVID protection but otherwise pretty
2.0,"I manage the freezer section at a grocery store, I'm always trying new and different types of gloves to use while working but have yet to find a pair that fits my small hands and keeps my hands warm. The Vgo gloves were a small and they wouldn't stay on my hands. If they. Would have been able to tighten around the wrist it would have been alot better, but the finger tips were to long especially the pinky finger. With the finger tips to big the touchscreen wouldn't work. As soon as I out them on parts of the gloves ripped. They were very warm though."
2.0,This t-shirt is really small.
2.0,Nice fabric but way too short and I’m 5 feet tall
2.0,The material and feel are as expected but I ordered a medium and the size fits an XS there is no way I could even get these on.
2.0,"This swimsuit is nice,  but the top was cut way too low for me, so I returned it."
2.0,Had to send back because it was way too large.  Otherwise it was great.
2.0,"I loved the pattern , but it runs really small. Even the length was less than expected ."
2.0,very cheaply produced -  Disappointed
2.0,"After about a year of use, the heel seams come apart.."
2.0,The dress is too big and shorter (which is not a problem). The waist does not come in to form a body shape.
2.0,"Item arrived quickly, but the quality was very less than expected. The foam insulation, had a sticky film round the top portion of the goggles. There was also a couple of dark blemishes on the rainbow tinted lens. I live in NY, as you may know, we have been getting hit with snow, so I decided to keep them. Not bad for the price, but quality could be much better."
2.0,"Decent last minute gift idea.<br />Smaller than expected but,  works well."
2.0,"So incredibly bummed. All the photos of this on the Little Unicorn Facebook and Instagram pages made it look like a black and cognac colored bag that would match my car seat so I went ahead and ordered it. I just received it and it's not even close - it's a very dull color, more of a gray brown. Additionally, I guess I was expecting the black part to be a suitable diaper bag material. It's a cotton that's not that much different than a T-shirt over a plastic siding. It doesn't look like it will hold up well, and the bag was covered in lint and fibers straight out of the wrapping so I'd only expect it to get worse. This will be going back."
2.0,I love the Crystal but it is too big and heavy for the chain that it comes with and even for the cord choker
2.0,Definitely not sized properly... more like a large than a 3x
2.0,"Received this sweater today and although I like the weight and the oversized feel and fit of it, the color is not at all like the beautiful light beige in the photograph. In fact, I'd say the color is really more camel brown or caramel. Much darker and not flattering to skin tones which skew towards light to pale olive. It's comfortable and warm but the color is way off so I'll probably send it back and order yet another black sweater...:-("
2.0,Beautiful colors but run very small
2.0,Adorable print for us dental nerds but sad because just as other reviews stated the pins that are in the slide that fit into the tracks of the Apple Watch pop out with the slightest bump. I’ve worn it for about 3 days and any time I reach into something or behind something the watch implodes. I’ve tried to pull the pins out to replace them and it seems that they are glued into the band making it impossible to remove without damaging it. :(
2.0,This item looks more like a eye glass cloth. I guess you get what you pay for. Plus this item took a long time to get here.. It looks fancy but material isn't what I've expected.. Great for decor or eye glasses.
2.0,"This dress is definitely long, which is great as I am 5'8&#34;, the fabric was really soft, and I loved the color. But the fit was not flattering at all - it was not a cute, boho look like I was hoping. It was more of like wearing a potato sack and the pockets made my hips look huge - I'm 5'8&#34;, 140 lbs. I am returning it."
2.0,I am short and thick. I wanted to like this dress but It’s awkward. It is too too long and too too big. I had to scrunch it up to make it feel comfortable. It has some straps on the side that feel like they dont belong. Way too Long!!! Way too BIG! I am starting to wonder why I purchased such a huge dress for no reason. The tie knot on the front doesn’t cover anything and my bra was showing the entire time. I really wanted to like it but it was such a disappointment I only wore it for the brunch and took it off right away. If I can get a smaller size that would be great but i no longer even need it.
2.0,"Cute top but the fit isn’t anywhere close to what the picture or measurements provided by the seller indicate.<br />SELLER’s measurements in their description:  Bust:48.82&#34;,Length:31.50&#34;,Shoulder:14.96&#34;,Hem:47.24&#34;,Sleeve:14.57&#34;<br />ACTUAL measurements of garment I received:  Bust:  46” (2” SMALLER); Length, 31” (1/2” SHORTER), Shoulder 16” (1” WIDER); Hem 44 (3.25” NARROWER); Sleeve 14” (1/2” SHORTER).<br /><br />And, with one washing, i think this adorable top would shrink to a 3Toddler size.  BUMMER!!"
2.0,I was disappointed with this because the material was so slick my heel kept slipping rather than preventing it.
2.0,"Not sweatshirt/hoodie material. It’s thin. Print is cool, but not what I was expecting. Wouldn’t buy again or another like it. Disappointing."
2.0,"Two stars because there is no way these are made of cotton. I hand wash all my clothes before wearing and as soon as these were in the sink, the water ran off them like they were made of plastic. Once I got the water worked into them, the fabric was very stiff. Then, after I drained the water, the sink was full of sediment indicating that these are a synthetic microfiber-type fabric... Please, seller... Just be honest!<br />And they are very small. I am 5'2&#34; and weigh 115. A size small should fit without discomfort! As I said, I've already washed them so they can't be returned... I will donate them."
2.0,"Didn’t fit or meet my expectations, cheap material and all the button came off, cheaply made. I am getting tired of these cheaply made stuff on Amazon"
2.0,The toes don't curl
2.0,This dress came out of the package smelling just awful!!! My daughter was gagging and it smelled up our whole kitchen. Washed it multiple times and there is still a bit of an odor.
2.0,"The frame cracked and the blue coating started wearing away after a few weeks. Other than that, they float as advertised and are nice glasses while they last."
2.0,Was not an untuckit shirt.  Shirt tail too long.
2.0,I tried this dress in a medium blue and large gold. I actually feel like the medium felt a little bigger if not the same as the large.  The dress is super comfy and the glitter is nice and soft. The only problem was the slit in the back was so high you could see my butt cheeks! I wasn’t crazy about either color so I’m going to order 2 more and see if I can maybe stitch the slit a little bit.
2.0,"You get what you pay for, a cheap shirt. The cut outs fit awkwardly and the shirt is not a big as I wanted it to be. I wear a S and ordered a L and it fit like a small"
2.0,While sitting these shorts give the appearance of my crotch being erected due to the velcro seam.<br />Haven't worn them out in public but hope not to get a charge for public indecency...
2.0,"The ""Merry Christmas"" under the trees is black, you can't really see it. It seems to be white in the photo."
2.0,I normally wear a 2xl and ordered this shirt in the same size. It did not fit well. It was tight all around and there was that button gap in the chest area.<br /><br />The material of the shirt did feel nice though. Wouldn't be a bad shirt for smaller/ slimmer people.
2.0,Emblem looks nothing like the bright and detailed picture as advertised.
2.0,"As soon as I saw this topic the packaging I was already disappointed. It looked so cheap. The pink is the faintest ugliest pink I've ever seen. The shirt fits a lot looser than I expected. I'm 5'7 , 130lb and the small was still too loose. The material look really really thin and cheap. I bought it for work but I don't thg think it will see the light of day. Wish I could return it but I cant. It's only $11 so its no great a loss."
2.0,"They are warm and seem well-built, but are sized far too small.  I am always a 'large' in sweatpants and have never had any issues with fit.  In this case I am barely able to get them on and they are too snug to be comfortable, particular as they are supposed to be exercise/lounge wear.  Doesn't matter how warm they are if I cannot comfortably wear them."
2.0,The actual rings are very small.  Pay attention to the stated measurements and imagine the size and reduce that by about 20 percent.
2.0,Something different to try in style. Fits as it should
2.0,Really heavy.
2.0,Barbell too small!!! And the heart is too heavy. There were jagged edges on the bottom of one of the hearts
2.0,"I thought they'd be great for daily wear for both of our glasses,and sunglasses but so far only the black one has lasted @ 2 months 2 have broken, one is rigged for mask use and I'm wearing the last one. Their length is good, would have like more black or solid black straps."
2.0,A couple of the crystals fell of before arrival. Not so good then.
2.0,"Heavy fabric faded, pilled, and stretched after first wash.  Pockets stick out strangely on hips due to thickness of fabric, not smooth or flattering.  Would not order again."
2.0,Very uncomfortable.  The rubber was hard; not flexible.
2.0,Bought these for use with blue diode engraver. Theyre
2.0,They weren’t thick on the inside at all I should of got an 11 instead but I thought they had more padding so I am buying extra thick socks so her feet don’t swim in them
2.0,"I've been trying to find a nice romper that fits forever now! They're all cheap or fit funny and I like to hide my mom pooch, which this romper does for the most part. I'm 5 2 and 160lbs, I ordered an xl. I'm normally a large so size up. The material is stretchy as well! If this holds up after a wash then I'll definitely buy more colors! Buy it!<br /><br />UPDATED:<br />I ORDERED ANOTHER COLOR CAUSE I LOVED THE ORHER ONE SO MUCH. NOTHING LIKE PICTURE. MADE DIFFERENT!"
2.0,"The hat is realllly cute but WOWOW did it stink! Like poison, i had to wash it  4 times and the smell still lingers"
2.0,"These are good quality slippers but they do not breath very well therefore they are almost useless.  I wore my husbands slippers for about 15-20 minutes and my feet started to sweat, believe it or not my feet do sweat but my husbands do.  He will not be wearing them so we will need to order another brand of slipper."
2.0,"Shipping fast, I like the jewelry color an box they came in but it hurts and leaves indentations when left on like supposed to."
2.0,"Love the style, just needed a larger size."
2.0,Not enough room for DD's.
2.0,"Love the look, the buckle, and the solid loops that attach to the 45mm Apple Watch. Unfortunately, the strap is an inch too long unless you’re an NFL linebacker. After I cut out the stitching on the longer strap with the holes and shortened it by an inch it fits great… too bad they didn’t make it like that from the start!"
2.0,I had this band for a little over a month and it broke. Cheap product
2.0,"Don’t like the neck area, it didn’t hang right so I returned it."
2.0,Much too large for the size. Returned it.
2.0,These earrings were very small and a little difficult to close because the hoop was so tiny. These are more meant for a child or a young adult
2.0,"They look really pretty but too large to be too rings. Fell of my toes at first wear. Tried my fingers, too tight and couldn't start the pressures on my finger. Like I said above, really pretty. It they were able to fit my toes, it would have the best buy."
2.0,Didn’t fit - sent back
2.0,Hat was way too small.. More suited for a child or small child
2.0,"Ordered in 2018 and they were fantastic, my favorite. They were sturdy, perfect shape, and great for the beach. Ordered again this year and they are dollar store quality. Lenses are loose in frame, plastic is shiny, and the shape is flattered in the front. Not worth the $8 I paid."
2.0,"I work in a refrigerated Warehouse with a freezer. The fit of these gloves is very comfortable and the finger length is good. Dexterity with these gloves is good. However as far as keeping my hands warm they are a fail. they might be windproof and waterproof but the cold will transmit through the material to your fingers. It took about a half hour for my fingers to be painfully cold, an improvement over the 10 minutes with other gloves."
2.0,"Not attractive or flattering. But not bad for work. I’m very meh on these. I’m short and thin. I feel like a tall, curvier person might rock these."
2.0,"These are cute enough and care promptly.  I lost jewelry and urgently needed it replaced and this worked and looked cute.  It’s a little bothersome because it comes so far off the skin but the real problem is that this thing looks awful after a week of wear.  Especially because it’s large, it’s green on a huge patch of my skin.  Terrible."
2.0,"The dress is beautiful BUT, I ordered a 5x, which normally fits me perfect. This dress was marked 5x, but I couldn't get into it. I love it so much I'm going to alter it, add panels under the arms, and do something creative (still working that out) for the neck."
2.0,Order 1-2 sizes up.  Great quality but the sizing is way off.
2.0,"The clasp was somewhat messed up.  It is a pretty piece, but IMO overpriced for the overall quality."
2.0,I bought this shoe in dark brown and I am not impressed with the fit and look of it. It runs slightly larger in size so there is a little space to the back. I like the shade of brown though and the height of the heel is comfortable.
2.0,"The chain is very flimsy, and broke within weeks. The container was only large enough to hold one of my heart pills. The container itself is sturdy and well made, but if you need more than one medication, or more than just nitroglycerin, this isn't the right product for you."
2.0,"We live in the desert mountain west but took this umbrella on a trip to the east coast. After opening and closing it several times, it got stuck with the handle open, but the canopy pretty much closed. The canopy of the umbrella can close, but won't lock open. With lots of effort, the umbrella can be held open. The handle and rod is now stuck as a very long stick (it won't telescope closed) and is no longer compact and easy to stick in a bag. Very disappointing."
2.0,"The material is much thinner than it looks. It also seems flimsy and it is a bit larger than expected. I wear a size small-xsmall. I ordered a small and it fits like a medium. The length of the jacket seems like it goes a little over your hips (according to the way the picture looks)...but it cuts off where your belly button is, making your torso look short."
2.0,Too small for an XL
2.0,"Apple Watch Series 5 Owners<br /><br />I have used this product for a little over a week, and here is my review:<br /><br />Before ordering this product, I contacted Juuk over the Amazon Questions linked to this product, and they confirmed it will fit Apple Watch Series “ 5 and they confirmed it will fit.<br /><br />Band adjustments<br />Adjusting the band was actually pretty easy. The links did not get scraped or dented even though marginal pressure is required.<br />Quality<br />Quality is good. But it does get dented very easily, like a soft metal. Even from fingernails, it seems.<br /><br />FIT<br />I was told this Band would fit my Apple Watch Series 5, but this was not the case. I was able to fit one side on to the Apple Watch guides you have been the other side would not fit and scratched my watch in the inside very badly. This is very disappointing and Hass to be due to bad craftsmanship to not be consistent on both connectors.band would fit my Apple Watch Series 5, but this was not the case. I was able to fit one side onto the Apple Watch connector guides but the other side would not fit and scratched my watch in the inside very badly. The tiny metal buttons you had to push in yourself, and also scratched the case on my watch. This is very disappointing and must be due to bad craftsmanship to not be consistent on both connectors. Now my brand new expensive watch I’ll never resell for when it should and this watch and never even had a different band on it it was new out-of-the-box only having the rubber band on it once. I did report this to Juuk.<br /><br />Juuk Response<br />Juuk has not responded or offered to replace the band or anything actually. Do yourself a favor and spend your money on a cheaper band that opened up in better quality and most likely the company will respond and make things right."
2.0,"After reading reviews I got a larger size because reviews said arms were tight.  The arms are huge now, I should've stuck with my normal size."
2.0,too big of oval for john lennon glasses and overall bad quality
2.0,"I love the design on the earrings, especially being a huge LOTR fan. The fish hooks they are mounted on though are HORRIBLE. I am not someone who is sensitive to cheap metals, but these irritated my ears to the point of bleeding. I would not recommend these because of the cheap metal alloy being so inflammatory."
2.0,Fits too small..I got an xl fits like a medium
2.0,yoo small means too small
2.0,"Very cute, very flimsy and after reaching out for instructions for changing battery which died within three weeks with no response my 2 stars are a generous nod to cute. Save your money and disappointment"
2.0,I ordered this band to match my gold Apple Watch 4.  The buckle and other metal parts look like the rose gold of earlier watches.
2.0,"I am a professional Santa, there boots will never hold up for the season. Luckily I only have a few people that want the chronicles Santa.<br />They are too small at the top so I had to take a 3” Santa belt to make a fill.<br />I will be take taking the tops off and making something useful."
2.0,"This is a very cute bag, so I was very disappointed when as I grabbed it for the first time heard loud crunching. I can't even imagine standing in the checkout line at the store trying to reach into that bag without being totally embarrassed by the sound. It is loud, and as if someone stuffed easter cellophane into the lining. Anyone standing next to you would hear it. I opened the bag and inspected it to make sure all of the shipping paper was out before making a final decision, and the lining is so cheap it actually snagged on my nail. The leather looked genuine, and the style, shape, and overall look are cute. I cannot attest to the durability, but with such cheap lining and filler, I bet there will be holes inside very quickly with regular use. As soon as I opened it and inspected it, I put it right back in the box it came in, and sent it back."
2.0,"Super thin, unflattering,  looks cheap- disappointed :("
2.0,"The mechanism broke, while I was on a business trip. This is the 2nd one I have broken."
2.0,I am tall and thin and right now clothing makers seem to think all tall thin people have large breasts...they all don't. This is definitely made for someone with larger breasts.
2.0,"Did not like the sizing.  Only could order small-medium or large-X large.  If you are a medium, the small-medium is a little tight."
2.0,Just opened it and damaged product came. And it has marks thats unremovable
2.0,"It’s cheap plastic, my old one was more like umbrella material"
2.0,Somewhat hot and heavy material..  I took off the giant bow.  Looked kinda dumb for a grown woman.  Looks like a funeral dress.
2.0,When I received this one of the strings was broken.<br />No point sending it back....I would actually lose money.<br />Oh well....I knew I was taking a chance.<br />You get what you pay for!!!
2.0,"The image on the shirt almost looks green and it is supposed to fit as a women's Small. However, it fits more like a child's medium. I couldn't even take it off without help lol"
2.0,"Bought this bag around 3 months ago, the side zipper ripped and cant be used anymore."
2.0,"Very see-through and the material felt very cheap, almost like a costume. The dress itself is very cute (from afar) and fit well, but I couldn't get past the material."
2.0,"Was looking for something to wear for my rehearsal dinner and was excited to find this. It was not too fancy but fancy enough and it didn’t seem too hot! Upon trying it on, not only was it too small (and I sized up a size…) but it also was entirely see through!!"
2.0,Beautiful watch but the case is rather heavy on the wrist but not uncomfortable.  Giving it 2 stars because I owned it less than a month probably wore 2 times and the gold plating on the clasp began to fade. I bought the watch specifically because it was 18k gold plated vs gold tone stainless steel. Started off as a little spot of discoloration but then became sizable and continues to fade.  It's on the clasp so it's not readily visible but I notice it and bugs the heck out of me while wearing it.  Needless to say I am returning the watch because amazon does not offer an exchange option but would definitely repurchase. Also the watch came without a battery guard so who knows how long the watch was stored while the battery was running.
2.0,"The bow kept falling off on one shoe & they run a size small<br /> Had the bow stayed on I probably would have exchanged,but with a 17 month old if she can get the bow off what's the point in having a bow on the shoe?"
2.0,Was so excited to get this dress and then could not stand wearing it because material was terrible
2.0,I didn’t expect it to have a zipper on the butt which is not that comfortable to sit on. I also had to sew up a hole in the seam on the leg before I could even wear it. 😕 I have washed it 2 times and now the hood seam has holes in it.
2.0,"The corner of the ID holder is faded, the zipper is weak, and there's a crease that doesn't seem to go away. The clasps seem flimsy. If I wasn't so short on time,  I'd send back for a refund, as this is supposed to be a gift.  I am still debating at this point."
2.0,"Cheaply made, too small everywhere, had to return."
2.0,"It was just what I needed to fit my 5 keys in without bulk, but after 2 months, one of the hooks that holds the keys fell off, and a few weeks later another, will never buy again, no wonder it costs only $8."
2.0,Size bigger than expected
2.0,"i bought this hoodie cause my friend bought one but i bought this one cause it was a bit cheaper- but i shouldve bought the more expensive one ;-;<br />--this one isnt as soft, theres a few loose threads, theres a hole where the ear is sewed on & the hoodie strings are just attached & they dont 'scrunch up' when u pull on them. :( might just buy the more expensive one i saw.."
2.0,"It makes no sense to manufacture a security wallet that will not stay closed.  As nice as it is, I am returning it. The snaps are not heavy and deep enough to keep the wallet closed, even when it is only lightly filled with cards, receipts and money. Otherwise the quality is good.  Disappointing."
2.0,This dress is very classy. But another disappointing experience. It runs too large.
2.0,"The color was not as it appears in the pictures. It was a much murkier blue with white spots on it. It's heavy and doesn't fit my finger the way the size I got should. It's like a brass knuckle, not a ring."
2.0,Three broke while incase....material cheap
2.0,Cheap!!! Not worth it!
2.0,The bands stretch out of shape over time. Purchased 2 months ago. Not worth the money.
2.0,"The material of the panties I bought is not so good.  Their cut is also not comfortable, being high in the front and short in the back."
2.0,the sizing is off.
2.0,I think I got a defective batch. The string on the lower right part when it's on your face has come detached on four out of the five I've worn
2.0,Returned it fit too big
2.0,Not great quality and much too big. Very flimsy.
2.0,"These gloves are odd.  The fingers are WAY too long so you don't really get to use the touchpad fingertips on your phone.  By the time you pull all the material down onto your fingers, the finger tips are too bulky to work.  If you have really long fingers, go for it!  Prob would work great for you.  But for most, they are just cut wrong."
2.0,"These kept falling off of my son's sunglasses.  After just a few tries, the rubber gripper at the end slipped down and was a hassle to get back to the end so he could put them back on the glasses.  Bought a different kind elsewhere."
2.0,"Although I got a medium black sweater, the style is not as shown. It is not oversized, has a collar not like this at all and is cheap quality. Save your money, after washed once was not wearable again."
2.0,"These were pretty comfortable although I should have gotten a bigger size. Unfortunately, when I washed them, the seams split right in the crotch."
2.0,"Material is really rough and almost hard, even after a couple washes. Fits is ok."
2.0,"hurts to use, the teeth on the clamps are very sharp"
2.0,Will be returning too big
2.0,The shirt has a top and bottom part that makes it fit strangely.  I will be returning mine.  I also thought it was an ivory color but is more yellowish.
2.0,"Low quality, smells like plastic!"
2.0,It’s hideous. Don’t buy it.
2.0,It broke in 3 weeks.
2.0,Poor quality fabric. I'm sorry for the design.
2.0,Not true to size.  I always wear a size 10.....this was very snug.  The bra top is very constructed and padded....almost too much!
2.0,"I used them twice, and the third time they broke. I guess for the price, that's to be expected."
2.0,"Nice watch, but it’s really to big"
2.0,Very thin and feels cheap and itchy.  I returned it.
2.0,"I really liked the idea of this item, especially when wearing athletic shoes. But the item was too short, and worked its way off my toes. Probably due in part to fact that the end of my toes vary greatly from large toe to smallest with steep &#34;angle&#34;.  Sorry that it did not work for me."
2.0,"I was SO disappointed getting these. They took forever to ship to me, and they are SO tiny, like children’s gloves. And they really are a pretty glove, EXCEPT for the big sticker sewn on them 🤨😞"
2.0,I do NOT have a small wrist but this bracket is huge! Seems more for a man's wrist. Maybe even to big for them! I tightened it as far as it could go and I could get it up halfway to my elbow!
2.0,"Although these are cute and seen high quality, the suction is so strong it hurt my daughter’s face. She swims year round and wears several different brands of goggles. Not for us..."
2.0,"i ENDED UP BUYING THIS BELT TOO BIG i SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT A SIZE 44, MY PANTS ARE STILL FALLING DOWN LOL"
2.0,The quality of these boots could definably use some improvement. There are a couple loose threads here and there. They are not the most comfortable boot I have worn. Putting them on is a little challenging as the 'elastic' does not have a lot of give to them. There is tightness around the top when they are worn that is really uncomfortable and does bother me to the point I cannot wear them for very long. There is also zero support on the sole. There is NO grip on the bottom of these. The are a thick plastic that if you were to walk on a hard and shiny surface you would be falling. These are something you would find at the store in the mall that sells really cheap shoes.
2.0,Bought two maxi dresses in this style... love this shorter version - above knee. UPDATE: After just a couple of months the fabric is beaded and has two little holes. Not great.
2.0,Too tight for 218
2.0,"This product is unimpressive to say the least. It looks nothing like that pictured. The material is ANYTHING but lightweight; it's thick and the design is boxy. It's something I'll wear with my pj's, but definitely not at the office or out of the house, like I intended. I'm disappointed."
2.0,Makes me look super pregnant.
2.0,"Price was great, arrived quickly. They are very comfortable and warm indoors. However outside the wind moves through them like your bare legged and after wearing them once for a couple of hours they collected so much lint and pilled up beyond belief. So yeah they're OK but if buy them buy a sweater shaver too so you can  ready when they pill up."
2.0,The quality was not what I expected. So I returned it.
2.0,"This might work if you are a size 0, but if your stomach bends when you sit, then don't expect this to stay where you put it! The photo makes it look like it can pull the back of the bra down about 2 inches, (which is what I needed), but in reality, the strap rides up and the back of the bra rides up. In the future, I think I would spend a little more money and get a different product."
2.0,Returning to order another one to small
2.0,"Not very cushy, already tore on cuff. Way overpriced for the poor quality."
2.0,"Like the look but the bracelet came damaged and bent and I couldn't straighten it. I was worried it would break and it wouldn't straighten out, so I returned. Too bad."
2.0,"The cups have a graduated padding, I guess you could say...more in the lower, outer corner of cups (like a push-up bra) getting thinner towards top.  Not what I was expecting, but also the cups are cut off low, like a demi bra.  So not much coverage.  And although the XS is recommended for A-B cups, as a B, the top outer edges of the cups sort of bow out, so under a shirt you can definitely see the edge of the bra.  That’s just how it worked out for me- everybody’s different...just do me a favor and leave the tags on until you try it on. ;-/"
2.0,It ripped at the second use.
2.0,Broken the second time my daughter wore it. :(
2.0,"Came missing a nose piece, gotta take the other one off to make it even, so cheap that it's not worth finding and buying a replacement, would not describe this as 'dope', more like defective."
2.0,"First off, I only got 19 pieces of jewelry when the title clearly says &#34;20 pcs.&#34; Some of the balls get stripped out so easy that they wont stay on the bar. The ONLY reason I gave this two stars is because it got here before the estimated delivery."
2.0,clear vision until you enter the water and then forget them...everything is blurry...I use them in a pool and they are worthless...unclear vision.
2.0,I had to return this  product because it was loose and somewhat large for my husband.
2.0,"The overall quality of the band is nice. It's sturdy, but if it doesn't fit you exactly I wouldn't recommend this product. It came with 3 tools and they all bent before we could even put the band on the watch. The process of adjusting the links was so frustrating I am returning it before even trying it on."
2.0,The top fit perfect but the bottom was too tight and smaller than the described size.  :/ I'll just have to wear a different bottom. Shucks...
2.0,"I was looking for a small messenger bag.  This one fit the bill, looks awesome.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />It is small, but has three compartments. I fit files in the back compartment and can put all sorts of thing into the big compartment.  It also has a smaller compartment in the front that I don’t use much. The two front pockets fit a lot of stuff.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />Zippers are hard to open and harder even to close.  The fabric inside is ripping apart after about ten uses😞."
2.0,"I love this skirt. However, I've worn it once, and the hem is already falling apart. It's really soft and light when wearing, but be forewarned; it won't last long. I'll be spending my night re sewing a hem..."
2.0,The material is very thin and more like a oversized T shirt . I'll use it as a swim suite cover
2.0,"Very nice shirt. However, it is small fitting!!!!"
2.0,I gave it away...
2.0,would have to wear a long top with this unless you have a perfect tush
2.0,Would never wear in public but kept for sleep shorts cause they’re comfy. Wasn’t original intention. I also agree with another reviewer that these are similar to printed bathing suit material.
2.0,See through and yucky material. Not for me
2.0,Doesnt tell which size is which. Just a bunch of spirals thrown into a plastic bag.
2.0,Big time shrinkage after laundering
2.0,"This sweatshirt smells like moth balls, has been washed 20 times!"
2.0,The band was great but the cups were huge!  Had to return.
2.0,if you're as thin as the model than you should be fine. They should take off the part where it says &#34;one size&#34; because it doesn't stretch at all. If you have hips forget it.
2.0,Fit was fine but the peplum style was not done correctly which in my mind would have been gradually so it poofed out on the side making it look ridiculous so I had to return it.
2.0,"When I first received these bracelets I like them. However, after wearing them for about a week or two they started to varnish. No they are just ugly. The smaller ones which were my favorite are all varnished. Eventually all of them would be if I were them. These bracelets were not that expensive but not worth the price if they are going to turn in that short of time. I did not get them wet or sweat in them either."
2.0,The ears are OK. The tail is 9&#34; long - way shorter than either of my two real cats' tails. The bow tie is tiny. Wouldn't get it again.
2.0,The cleats kept me out of the concrete. The heal stop is not tall enough to hold my shoes. I kept walking out of the shoes because my shoe heals would slip over the heal stop.
2.0,I’ve been wearing it for a few days and my skin is starting to break out in hives. 😞
2.0,Usually wear a Large but had to return this dress because it was way too big.
2.0,Don't actually have it so I don't have much to say..... looks great in the listing photos though.....
2.0,"This top fit ok, but very thin and cheap looking, I donated it."
2.0,It not only squeezes the chest but also the stomach which caused my kid to not wear any longer than 2 hours
2.0,The design has large holes my megaton shark tooth kept falling out. I don't think it will work for crystals or rock jewelery either. Not what was described in product review.
2.0,"I bought these based off a question from another buyer if these can be dyed and the response was ""I don't see why not"". These can not be dyed. I got them to dye yellow for costume, and they will not hold color. They fit fine go up to before my elbow, but they are kind of warm/itchy. Very disappointed."
2.0,Turtleneck was way too small and the material is extremely cheap. So disappointed
2.0,Cute shirt but womens size ran way to small and I had to pay to return it so I didnt order a replacement....
2.0,theyre wayyyyy bigger than expected.  the small is huge on me and theyre very stiff.  i have to wash and shrink them and hopefully theyll sofen up too  :/
2.0,"So, I wear about a size 9/10 curvy in jeans, I got a large for the hip room (had last baby 9 months ago) and this is just way to baggy on me. I am 5’8 160 pounds.  This dress looks like I am wearing an oversized pillow case :("
2.0,Looks cheap. I won't wear it.
2.0,sizing all wrong
2.0,It’s very tight in the sleeves and across the chest for me. The dolpatta is very cheap feeling too. I’m considering returning it tbh. It does look nice just not on me.
2.0,Only giving 2 star because I dress is longer then expected and there's a hole in it!!
2.0,Threads already coming out after two days wearing. Poor quality.
2.0,"They look cheap in person. The jewel is just whiteish plastic and the shaft of it is super long and hangs out on both sides. I bought the 2g size and they keep falling out, I almost feel like they're a little small but not quite 4g small."
2.0,"one broke in half three days after using, not the best quality but i’ll still use them"
2.0,"Like the 80's style of these sunglasses.  But the color is not hot pink; it's more like pastel pink.  So, disappointed with the color."
2.0,Very cheap looking. Some charms are very yellow and some have a yellowish orange color. The charms don’t match in color. Mardi Gras charms were included. I think these should be cheaper in cost because of color quality.
2.0,This is NOT 24 inch. It is much smaller and does not fit at all. Back it goes.<br />Also has a super wide brim that looks weird.
2.0,The balls are too big.
2.0,"The case was too small for regular sunglasses. It came with no cleaning cloth. I returned it and got a refund.<br />For reading glasses, it might be a good choice, it is a lovely case."
2.0,I was so excited for really no show socks. And they are no show. Better than any other socks I’ve tried. Except I’ve spent all day having to adjust them because they slip off so easily and then bunch up at the toe.
2.0,I think it is very beautiful but its very delicate so one touch can cause all the accessories to fall off and I was very disappointed pointed because its so beautiful
2.0,Dont buy your size because it will shrink a full size and be useless.<br />fabric is soft and light weight.<br />Beautiful colors just like pictured.<br />No smell of unwashed dye/vinegar or plastic packaging
2.0,Window for ID keeps falling apart.
2.0,"Did not fit right, not flattering at all. Cute pattern though."
2.0,Fits way above my belly button. Nice material for summer.
2.0,See through and poor quality
2.0,These feel like they are junior sized pants.
2.0,"I ordered a size 7.5, and that’s never failed me (in my entire adult life) but my heel hangs off the back of these shoes- unfortunately."
2.0,"I was shipped the wrong size for this item (large instead of xl), but as I’m between sizes I thought I would try anyway. It did fit, with just being a little small in the bust, HOWEVER - it’s just one layer of almost sheer material. You can see everything. It does have extra in the gusset, but that’s it. Maybe if you’re wearing it under a rash guard or wear a second top under it… but I would NOT wear on its own."
2.0,Fit was odd. I figured it would be loose as shown on model. I give two star for nice stretchy fabric. I normally wear size small and shouldn’t have to size up just to wear.
2.0,It’s definitely not worth the price.
2.0,Strong mold musty smell. Cute design and fit. Very see through.
2.0,"They were so cute but within a matter of days I found the clasp in the back was unable to grab onto the ear for more than an hour or so at a time. Eventually it wasn’t grabbing on at all and a few weeks later the entire earring would slip out of my ear multiple times a day, no matter how tightly I had pinched it in place. Very unfortunate as it was a beautiful earring but did not last long at all. I didn’t experience any piercing irritation so good for finicky ears like mine, but they just do not stay in place whatsoever so wouldn’t recommend this product."
2.0,Cute but Too copper looking not gold colored The birds were a little scratchy on The edges but cat expect much for price
2.0,"The material is flimsy and is not as shown on pictures , the shorts underneath are blue not purple wont but again so wrong color"
2.0,They work great but I didn't pay attention to the style.  They don't fit over my glasses
2.0,SUPER CUTE. WAYYYYY TOO SMALL. It's like spandex and doesn't say that in the description or any other reviews before I purchased. I bought a 2xl and returned it because it fit like a clingy medium.
2.0,"The neck and shoulder area was huge, whereas the bottom portion fit a bit snug.  I wear size 8 pants and a D bra, - I am smaller on the bottom than the top, so my body shape should not have been the issue here.<br />I have some Doubleju tops that are a tremendous fit, but the size has been totally inconsistent with last couple tunics I have ordered from them - I guess I need to start purchasing another brand."
2.0,This oil seemed thin and did not penetrate the leather on baseball gloves as well as Neatsfoot Oil I had used in past years.  Is it still made the same way?
2.0,Item have a flaw in back of shirt that may turn into a hole..
2.0,The picture and description do not match the dress. Belt is hard to figure out how to tie and size ran smaller than expected. I returned but had to pay shipping since sent from China.
2.0,"I buy a lot of leggings to I was willing to give these a shot. Loved the pattern and color, but Did not care for the material (hard to describe, but not soft or pliant). The biggest disappointment was the waist. There is zero... control so it feels like nothing. I'd wear these around the house, but definitely not for working out. That would be so annoying yanking them up. The other reviews were right. I read them all and still bought them and wish I had listened. Oh well."
2.0,"I got this because I've bought other romwe items that fit, however I sized up and it was still too small. I am going to wash it and see if it softens up but the fabric is also not soft, it is kinda scratchy and thick. If you are petite this may work for you but the xxl would probably be a normal large or a larger medium size."
2.0,"Ring is true to size, but I was disappointed that the word “love” is barely noticeable, but the writing inside the band is."
2.0,"The suits fit as expected and look great. The price for two suits was a plus. The grommets for the drawstring are rusting, however, so I’m not sure if they will last the season.<br />Update 9/16/19: dropped to 2 stars bc the rust (naturally) continues to worsen.<br /><br />The rug in the background is also an Amazon purchase and it received 5 stars. 😎"
2.0,"Low quality, thin fabric almost like paper,  boxy fit, runs very large yet no stretch anywhere so it's tough to get just the right fit."
2.0,I received a totally different pair of glasses
2.0,[]
2.0,The underwear is soft but it runs too large and the trim in the front is for show—there is no hole opening for standing access. If your kid can stand and pee using the access hole these are not for him.
2.0,Order a larger size. These fit very snug!
2.0,Two stars only because of way they arrived.
2.0,"Super cute but runs really small.  My daughter, who is just getting into a size 10 and still wears some size 8's could not button the 10s.  and they were super short"
2.0,I got this for my boyfriend and I. They broke very quickly! Rather disappointed! Looked nice but the string it was on was very fragile and broke!
2.0,"Detail seems nice, not sure what the material is, came broken. For an event this weekend so no time to return it, going to try and super glue it so I won't be able to return it. Not sure how fragile it is, did not come with any plastic bubble casing or packing peanuts."
2.0,Part of the jacket is coming undone. Overall very soft and cozy. Disappointed though
2.0,Worked great about 10x till screws became stripped
2.0,"These are falling apart, started coming unsewed within a week. I didn't work in them, either, just out and about. I paid more than they are now advertised at currently. Disappointed."
2.0,"Good material not see through, nice lace. Too large and looked like for older lady's."
2.0,TOO LARGE AAND THIN
2.0,The tag arrived and it is nothing short of PINK.  Not purple as the title implied.  The link no longer shows its available so I don't know if I missed something in the picture or description.
2.0,"The material has a nice sheen to it but I can see that it is the type that will start to pill right away. It isn't a particularly flattering cut, though it does seem true to size. I am returning this item."
2.0,Nah!  These made my tits look misshapen.
2.0,The plastic panel on the back (for operating your phone) starting coming unstitched right away.
2.0,I loved the material these are made from as they are really soft.<br />They were returned because they don’t fit right. The waist is very low and didn’t cover well. I am not sure what the manufacturer uses for models.  Maybe they were intended for small teens.<br />I ordered a pair in large and extra large and neither pair fit. I usually wear a medium or large.
2.0,Beware that the sizing is really off. The print is not on both sides like traditional African Print skirts. The fabric is not as heavy either. Also the cut is off so the skirt does not flare like the photo. I contacted the seller to return the skirt and they offered me 1/2 of the purchase price back and I could keep the skirt or I could try to ship it back to China but they could not guarantee that they would receive the skirt and I was going to have to pay for return shipping. Overall the whole experience was a pain.
2.0,Much smaller than I expected it do be. I doubt I will wear it. It is also very thin which I actually like.. A beautiful tank top underneath would work perfectly.
2.0,"The skirt itself is beautiful, however it ripped just a few weeks. I am just 2 days past the return window, unfortunately, otherwise I would definitely return it... Too bad, because the design is amazing, but the fabric quality is bad, somewhat too thin.."
2.0,I would recommend you go up a size.
2.0,Very disappointed. I've been trying to find one that has all these heating areas. Thought I found the one. Even double checked the measurements before ordering. Ordered a 2X fit like a medium or large.
2.0,"These bracelets are nice , but the beads are way to big. Even my husband that he’s a wider person it look kind of big on him. So if you want something to use everyday these are very uncomfortable"
2.0,This is zero support and wouldn't even consider using for when I am working out. This is more like a lounging bralette.
2.0,"The length of the leg should not be adjustable because the mechanics of it leave a weird bulge in the knee area that kind of makes it useless.  It also makes it weaker and allows it to bend. After I had received these and seen how they worked, or failed to work, I started looking for the original style and found this exact same style and brand on another web sight $7 cheaper. In my opinion still more than they are worth."
2.0,Smaller than I thought it would be. I was expecting the larger size ones.
2.0,Bought for my son. He's choosing to keep it even though I wanted to send it back. Very generic and cheaply made design. Very thin material for a sweatshirt and sized small. So if you order this order a size up from what you normally wear
2.0,Vinyl w/ “metallic stuff”
2.0,"The dress its self was nice and exactly what I wanted, great fit, however out of the package it had a rip in the right shoulder on the seam. I am returning it, however, now I don't know if I should order another one or not because it was exactly what I wanted just not good quality. Maybe just a one time thing? Im not sure."
2.0,"Loved them But So dissapointed, the clasp would not secure tight, wore one time, arrived home wearing one earring!"
2.0,Beads were great but gave a low rating because the string used to make is weak. Broke in about a week
2.0,The dress was at least six inches shorter than pictured. We had to send it back.
2.0,I only have one hand therefore it makes it tough to adjust the strap. They come apart and I can't fix them
2.0,"Was disappointed that the sizing is so incorrect. This was a large mens...however it fits like a US womens medium. That is not as expected, I'll have to give it to my teenage daughter to wear. disappointment."
2.0,"It was cute and fashionable but it really didn’t stick to my face , keeps on falling down"
2.0,"Chintzy, nothing like the &#34;first editions&#34; of the Allet line -- which could hold over 20 cards and remain the thinnest on the market.  The new ones are smaller and lighter; but far less usable.  I'll probably continue to use my &#34;old faithful&#34; Allett, though it's seen better days, and keep the new one for the rare occasions when I need to carry only a few cards and licenses.  Very nice, if you didn't really need a wallet."
2.0,"It looks really cute, but, unfortunately it broke the first day.  Rather cheaply made."
2.0,The wand fell apart very easily.
2.0,"After a few months the lenses fell out. For the price I'm not going to make a huge deal out of it, but it was a little disappointing."
2.0,A little snug and very see through
2.0,"It's more like a square tossed cap. There are no ' ears' unless you scrunch,  pull and mold the hat. Pretty disappointed with the quality. With as long as it took to ship, I was expecting more. If you are expecting it to have ' ears ', you will be disappointed.  It was going to be a gift, but it's not worth giving."
2.0,"I didn't like the way this sweater fit, not flattering. I am 5'6"", 140lbs, and this sweater made me look like a muffin with legs. I like the boho-look, but this one was more squared off. Not very cute for my body type."
2.0,"I was disappointed with this purse.  Several of the threads are hanging from the straps.  And after only 3 weeks an inner zipper got stuck, so I had to cut the zipper to get my wallet out!  Poor quality!"
2.0,Bought this as it said lock 2 is a set if two charms but got only one.  Kindly assist by letting me know which is a set of 2.
2.0,"These earrings are so small, you can barely see them on."
2.0,"my arms aren't super skinny so I had to return the first pair of gloves I purchased. then I ordered these. they fit great and looked great, were great for one night but in the morning I noticed they skinny black had rubbed off on my most of hand part on both gloves. they're trash now. good for one long night."
2.0,"I realize that they were inexpensive, but they seemed a bit blurred to me."
2.0,"When I got the product, I thought it looked ok for the price.  When I put it on and looked at it closer, I could see the white plastic that the lace was glued to.  For the price I paid, this really wasn't a shocker."
2.0,i've bought other leggings from same seller and a small usually fits well but in this specific legging that was not the case. the legging was too tight in all the wrong places are extremely uncomfortable to move around in which is not a quality you would usually want when at the gym.  the quality of the legging is great super smooth and durable.
2.0,"I saw so many mixed reviews about this watch, but decided to take a chance on it. And for the first 24 hours, I wasn't disappointed. It's beautiful, and kept time really well!<br /><br />You know, right up until it stopped working the next day. First the hands all stopped moving even though it was properly wound. Then my husband played with it, just resetting the time and such, and the hands started moving again. Well, the second hand did. And occasionally the minute hand. (Like, every couple of hours.) But the hour hand still wouldn't move.<br /><br />Thankfully, I was able to get a refund without having to return it. I'm going to take it to a shop near us to see if they can fix it, but they may not be able to because the metal inside is too cheap. But seriously, if you want a nice-looking cheap watch for a prop in a play or with a steampunk costume or something, this one is AWESOME. So beautiful! But if you want something functional, don't bother."
2.0,"Fit as expected, loved the length, material felt great but did not look great, picture online better than actual dress and material too thin.  Because of the look of the material and thinness I did not like it."
2.0,"I bought these to do with my son's pre-k class. Thank goodness i read some of the reviews first! I decided to put one end of the safety clasps on the strings ahead of time because I read that the shoe string plastic tip doesn't fit in the hole of the clasp. Well, I can confirm that about 50% of them didn't fit at all 50% would fit if you put a LOT of effort into it, and 25% worked perfectly. It took over 2 hours to get one side of the clasp on 24 pieces of string (and 2 of them I just gave up on). If I had tried to do this for the first time in front of a class full of 4 year olds, I may have run away crying.<br />On several we decided to just skip the clasp all together and tie a god old fashioned knot. The kids and teachers really liked them, but the frustration and irregularity of the clasp feature was extremely frustrating! If the clasps weren't included I would ave given 4 starts, but because they were included, I was super paranoid that they were necessary and if I didn't use them a kid could choke- so that is why I gave only 2 stars."
2.0,The skirt is very thin. Ots looks cute but it is not made from good quality material
2.0,"Awkward fit for a camisole style shirt I thought it would have a loose fit. Shirt was too short, large in the chest and tight in the middle. It’s a shame because the colors are beautiful! I also was not crazy about the super thin strap which are not adjustable."
2.0,Beautiful but at the end of the day some of the jewels fell out
2.0,"I ordered a size 8. They sent a 39 which is an 8.5 according to their size chart. The shoes are cute and comfy, but cheap. They are only worth the $32. Of course they're too big so now I have to go through the process of sending back and re- ordering."
2.0,Picture doesn't reflect what I received. Disappointed.
2.0,"Hello!<br /><br />These shoes are really great, nice looking and very comfortable! But I had a problem with them, I believe the shoes were defective since the beginning.<br /><br />The Amazon seller did not help at all, they told me to contact Nike, Nike said the shoes did not meet their criteria for replacement.<br /><br />First thing I saw (and did not consider important at that time) was the the right shoe's tongue was about 1 inch longer than the other one.<br /><br />The tongue is not really longer, it just was wrongly installed, about 1 inch higher, because of this it is loose at the bottom.<br /><br />Then after sometime (about 6 months) using the shoes the out sole of the right shoe came apart, it has a big hole, then a realized maybe the shoes were somehow defective from the beginning because of the tongue problem.<br /><br />These shoes look tough, but at the end a pair of Adidas Bounce, which look way less tough, lasted way longer than my Nike ACG shoes.<br /><br />The frustration here is that I don't understand how the people from Nike can't see the wrongly installed tongue, this clearly means the shoes came out of the factory with defects.<br /><br />I think the shoes are better than what I got, maybe I just was unlucky, but Nike did not honored their 2 year coverage from the manufacture date.<br /><br />Thanks!"
2.0,If you have an average to larger nose bridge the hard plastic nose piece here may ride on your nose too much. That’s what happened to me. And I didn’t like the side view distortion
2.0,It's very pretty on but really thin and ripped easily at the seams the first day I wore it.
2.0,"This product is beautiful, for what it is, and it a great way to add a feminine touch to a normally dull silicone ring.  However, the first time she wore it the top coat came off the fake stone area making the ring look horrible.  We returned it."
2.0,I have literally worn this band two times and it’s already unraveling. I very pretty but I won’t last. This was not worth the price I paid. Didn’t last a week.
2.0,I ordered a medium and it was like an XL
2.0,returned. didn't care for the fit
2.0,They are cute and great if you are simply trying a new style like me. But tbqh don't expect them the last. The glue which attaches the heel is visible. A clear indication they will not last. The stitches are uneven in their tightness in some places so tight they had already pulled the plastic toe tips to create larger holes. The material itself is poor quality outside of being poorly made. I'll be saving for the name brand version while I wait for them to enevitably fall apart. I'll be happy if they last 6 months.
2.0,"I am a petite 5'4"", 110 lbs female and ordered a Medium in this, expecting it to be oversized. It's slightly oversized but barely (i.e. it sits at the bottom of my waist and doesn't cover the tush), and shrunk in the wash on cold water, low heat dry. Most importantly, the fabric looks cheap and feels cheap (especially on the outside)--with a rougher exterior hand/finish characteristic of a high and cheap polyester content. It is thinner than most hoodies, sort of ""scratchy"" on the outside, which started pilling (!) after the first wash. When it arrived it also had that strong ""dye"" odor, typical of cheaper fabrics. Lastly, the neck is tight AF, and difficult to pull over my head. This company should use a better quality sweatshirt, as the logo is the only thing that looks good. (Go Blue!) Fail."
2.0,"Completely bummed. The picture nor description shows that the arm pits are super low cut. So your bra will show completely. I didn’t expect that. The tank print is so awesome I love it! Just really bummed out about the cut. Will be returning. Return isn’t free, so be careful about ordering"
2.0,Great glasses but very stiff to open and close. Broke afte 2 or 3 wearings.
2.0,"Was sized like anything that would come from China which is always too small for me.  Don't hink this did cause was shipped too fast.  I wear  a medium, ordered a large and is too tight."
2.0,Does not look like picture  It is a long tee shirt.
2.0,The zipper hardly worked and it wasn't as pretty in person...not flowing like the photo shows...gathering at the waist made it fit odd as well....
2.0,"Didn't fit great, I'm returning it."
2.0,I liked the bracelet but the closure keeps coming apart
2.0,"This is a very nice hat, very well made., however it is extremely hard and not comfortable to me."
2.0,The band itself is nice and durable. However I ordered the lavender color band and it was NOT lavender.  It looks more like a beige yucky color!!
2.0,The adhesion was good but the weight of my breaats pushed the material out. So it gave my top a weird look and you could see the bra.
2.0,They broke after the second time I put them on
2.0,sooo...the picture beautiful - clearly this is a stock image from fashion closet that I realized only after I purchased. One thing I wish Amazon could do better is to filter 'imitations' or at least make these sellers unable to use stock images.  These are clearly 'hand-sewn' - there is no tag and the material is not that great.  But I have them taken in - they will work for a weekend stroll.  Ask questions before you buy - too many imitators - the joys of buying online.
2.0,"The underwear is very nice and comfortable but I ordered a 4 pack and I only got 2 in the mail, no way to contact seller"
2.0,"This is a nicely constructed and very affordable luggage cart.  If you are rolling on anything other than perfectly smooth surface, however, it has a fatal flaw: the cart tends to get unstable and flop back making it unusable.  If you are rolling through an airport maybe this is great.  I am using it in an urban environment and it is heartbreakingly bad."
2.0,Not what I ordered. Still cute but no bows on the leg warmers and the bow is not as pictured for the onesie. It says 12-18 mo but fits 12mo. It did come with a head band which is nice. Just not sure if I want to keep or return it.
2.0,Cute dress for a teenager
2.0,Item arrived with a flaw is one arm opening was much larger than the other
2.0,"I like the fit, but the material is very thin and see-thru.  Not sure what you can wear under it to make it better."
2.0,Product needs an adjustable nose piece
2.0,Fit as expected but the material is like nylons. I would NOT wear alone like the description indicated. I would definitely wear under a skirt or long top that covered by behind. :(
2.0,"shoulder strap shackle broke already, cheap material."
2.0,"I purchased the rainbow and one of the hinges is super loose. Loose like, when I clicked it together to close it, there was separation in between so it was not flush against itself, aka it will cause damage to my nostril if left in. The other one was okay, but they are mostly just green and not rainbow."
2.0,LOOKS CHEAP! YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR WITH THIS NECKLACE
2.0,Not impressed with the quality. They would be good for an infant or baby not yet walking yet.
2.0,Does not arrive like the photo that you see. The buttons are not bubble like its is on a paper that they stuck behind the plastic. Not the texture as displayed in the photos. Very cheap looking but you get what you pay for I guess.  Arrived in a very dirty black zip-tie bag and the plastic it was in was stained.
2.0,Does not stay on the head. The ears are way to heavy so the headband fall forward. But it’s cute.
2.0,"The dress deserves 4 stars, but the seller sure doesn’t! The dress is nice, not see through at all. The sizing is small, smaller than some of the other reviews led me to believe. I received a medium in the pink color as a gift from my mother. It was way too tight in the chest but fit everywhere else. When my mom tried to return it, the seller was not helpful. Despite the free return option listed on the page for the size and color she bought, they said she could return it for an amount that made it pointless to do so. I won’t be buying from them due to this, and I suggest you only purchase from them if you are certain you will want to keep the item!"
2.0,"This ring is very cheaply made and not nearly as pretty as the photo. Also, sizes run large. But what do you expect for $1.50 (plus shipping)"
2.0,"I was excited about this top. The first thing I noticed is that the color is more of a cornflower blue, not a deep blue. The second was the quality of material, which is thin and cheap. The forearms are proportionally small. The thumb holes are in the wrong place. All in all a complete miss."
2.0,"I'm a DD cup but have a small waist. I bought this in a large and while the material is pretty good, it just doesn't fit. The straps don't go tight enough and the cups are too small. I would suggest that if you're a little bustier, this may not be a good suit."
2.0,I was disappointed. The socks advertised they were thin low /no show socks and they are not as advertised. They are thin but definitely not now show socks.
2.0,These clickers run on a single cr2032 battery. At 75% of the time my gate will not open. Very frustrating!
2.0,This top looks cute… until you put it on. The cheap material rises up and is suuuuper short. I wear crop tops all the time but this is literally like a bra but worse bc it doesn’t sit in place. Do not recommend.
2.0,It's always super reassuring when an article of clothing comes in a Chinese bag and makes a point of declaring itself as “new”.  Also there was no crotch guard thingy which freaked me out.  The suit is cute but the packaging was really weird!!!
2.0,"Welp, I read the reviews and took the chance and brought these jeans anyway. I only wanted them for the one night mind you because I figured the chains would pop off but hoping I could just get to wear them unbroken for the one night. Well no before even leaving the house one popped, no biggie I took that one off and it wasn't really that noticeable. Flash forward to the end of the night and about four had popped off, just dangling... I tucked them in until i was able to get home and cut them completely off! I'm giving these jeans two stars because the idea is great just poorly executed and I was able to tweak them and the fit is nice also, the design in the photo is not the design you get."
2.0,"My husband got this dress for me because he loves yellow-black combo. Unfortunately, it's too small on me, and this was the largest size available. Had to return :-("
2.0,"My wife didn't like this at all, she said that it looked sloppy on her."
2.0,"The red is more pink than red, and flimsy..definitely sending them back. I was disappointed and I would keep looking"
2.0,Big and thin
2.0,"Size up 1 or 2 sizes. Im a larger woman, i wear a 44DDD, and i have several brands of these kinds of bras and they all fit amazingly. I could not even get this 3x over my head. It is nice material but there is ZERO STRETCH. Its like trying to put on a straightjacket"
2.0,"Looks cheap, took forever to be delivered, not happy with the purchase."
2.0,to big and they fall off your face. very heavy
2.0,I didn’t like the thinness of the dress. I put the dress up to me in order to see if the length was ok. And you could see the graphic under the dress of the shirt i in was wearing! It was SEE THROUGH! I will probably wear it around the house but never in public way to see through for my comfort!
2.0,The slits to slide over your buttons are not good. It takes a lot of effort to get them on and off when you're going to the bathroom and when you're pregnant...that is quite often. I threw them in the trash and prefer to use a hair binder.
2.0,Good quality but fits tight on dad bod
2.0,Was sent the wrong size.. I ordered 3/4 and received 11/16.. definitely sucks after waiting almost a month for them. Giving two stars though because they are beautiful! Wish they would’ve come the right size. ☹️
2.0,"The quality of material isn't bad, but the seam runs under the bust line, not at the waist.  If it ran at the waist, as it appears in the photo, I'd like it much better."
2.0,This looks like a choker but it’s not... it hangs down lower than the college bone sadly even on the tightes hook. I am disappointed
2.0,"I received a defective pair. One of the four clips was entirely different style and manufacturer of clip. At first I thought the pin which secures the clip in place on your pants had fallen out, then I realized it was an entirely different design (see picture accompanying review).<br /><br />I don't know if someone bought it and returned it modified and it was sold again, or if it was manufactured incorrectly. Fortunately the Amazon return policy just means returning and purchasing again."
2.0,"I received the 4 pins I ordered, but they were much smaller than I expected."
2.0,They felt good for one day then you could feel the tred through the insole. No better than Wal-Mart slippers in fact they appear as the same slipper or even worse and twice the cost.
2.0,They grey now the grey that’s on the picture I was expecting I darker grey  but it fits good
2.0,I followed the size guide and bought an XL. They were way too tight. I sent back. Disappointed.
2.0,The listing is for &#34;crew&#34; socks. In fact they are almost anklets.
2.0,"Did not like the material, Jersey like. More casual than expected. Color was exactly how pictured and fit was as expected. Just felt dumpy in it."
2.0,"I loved them at first...wore them here on my farm, rode the horse etc...in 2 weeks time the heels are coming apart!!!!!! I am so disappointed because I LOVED them, they fit great and looked great..."
2.0,"I just received this tote and I’m disappointed. It is a good size bag, but it’s very shiny and the materials used for the lining is absolutely terrible! It’s rough and makes a loud crunchy noise that’s sure to be embarrassing when in public trying to get things in and out of it. I can’t imagine why they would use such a cheap material except that it was cheap! And it looks it and sounds it! I do not recommend this product except as a grocery tote or something like that. Too bad. It could have been really nice."
2.0,"This is a LOT bigger than I thought I guess they give dimensions of it, but you don't realize how big it actually is until it arrives."
2.0,"Screen too big, made for men with big wrist"
2.0,Cute but VERY poor quality
2.0,Not well made and way off on sizing
2.0,"The price and shipping time were very reasonable.  The handbag is ok.  I'm trying to be completely vegan, so I'm making the attempt to give up leather handbags.  My guess is that I just really prefer leather bags, and the Scarleton Satchel really looks vinyl.  I am not happy carrying this bag, so will pass it on to my daughter as an occasional book bag for school.<br />It just may be my opinion, based on what I prefer."
2.0,"This are the absolutely cheapest quality. They don't expand to fit the head well (they barely fit my 4 yr old), and they are tough to open to put on."
2.0,"After a couple of uses the frame crack,was dissapointed by the quality,expected more durability"
2.0,I wasn’t expecting a perfect fit...but this cute little item was WAY too small for me....I will just give it to someone else....rather than returning them because they are cute!
2.0,Very cheap looking. Worth half the price. Does not look like picture
2.0,Was not quite what I was expecting. I think she will still like it but it is kinda cheezy
2.0,"They are comfortable and they don't fall off your face. But they are not as nice as they want you to believe. They are plastic. And the color is not even, there are white spots."
2.0,"We like these, but I’ve noticed at least one pair has huge holes in the heels already, after washing them once or twice. We had similar socks to these that he has outgrown but these appear to be much poorer quality."
2.0,"For its value and the amount of piercings it comes with makes it okay. However, they get rusty and break easily."
2.0,"looks cheap, not as nice as in the picture"
2.0,Lo compre para mi my lindo solo que se está desilando esta dañando my rápido 😟
2.0,"Pros:  These gloves are very warm - this morning, with temperatures below freezing, I had to take them off 15 minutes into the dog walk because my hands were so hot. The palms and undersides of the thumbs are covered with a sueded material that offers a better grip (e.g. on the steering wheel) than the fleece would.<br /><br />Cons:  The fingers are too long and there's a lot of material bunched in their tips, so forget trying to do anything even slightly finicky, like unlocking the car door with the remote or latching the leash to the dog's collar. What's more, the bunched-up material pulls the gloves down your hand, so you've got these highly irritating blobs hanging off the ends of your fingers even when you're not trying to do anything.  It annoyed the hell out of me."
2.0,Only 3 of the 6 were as pictured. The other 3 aren't even rainbow nor the designs I was expecting and wanting. Plus 2 of them were already damaged. Poor quality.
2.0,used it to control swelling and circulatiion in the legs
2.0,"The cow leather bag was line with a soft liner that separates the bag in compartments.  I did not like the liner.  The liner had folds in it.  It made the interior difficult to search for items like keys, lip balm or a pen.<br /><br />Secondly, the opening was a bit tight for me.  Therefore, items may go in the spacious bag, however, it may be difficult to find in the bottom of the many compartments.<br /><br />I repackaged in existing box and dropped off to UPS the same day as the delivery date.  The refund was reissued by the end of the night."
2.0,"I bought this hoping it would be a flattering bikini after having twins. I sized up (normally a 0/2 or S in suits, but purchased M) and it fit, but I did not find it flattering. I am long waisted, and after having the babies, have a little belly from diastasis recti. I found this to hit me in all the wrong places."
2.0,Very cute purse but stitching on strap unraveled making it unusable. The other one I ordered in a different design was fine and cute as well.
2.0,This is a very small bracelet.
2.0,Robe is super cute but has no interior tie so it just falls totally open when you are wearing it. Continuously.
2.0,Love the dress 👗Quality was great but it was too big by the arms which I had to take in otherwise the bottom fit well but the top part does not fit as well sorry I purchased because I was using this dress for a event didn't like I Tryed it on and walked around with it the top part the arms area keep falling off my arms you know the part with with the two strap for some reason it keep slipping I said oh no 🙈 this is not happening!!🙈🙈
2.0,The gem on top is very loose.
2.0,Bought this twice… thought maybe first one was a fluke but second one broke the same way. Disappointed to say not very durable nor a great value given they break so easily. Small older dog… & an only pet so no chance that it broke due to rough housing.
2.0,Doesn’t stay on ears.
2.0,Absolutely loved this watch but the band stretched and then broke after only two weeks of wear.
2.0,"This bracelet is very small, and I have very small wrists. I got it and it was almost child sized. Very disappointed"
2.0,I ordered burgundy and received a wine red am very disappointed.
2.0,These softened after a few washes but after 5 washes tge print starts to flake off.
2.0,"brother said they fit until after washing, he donated the rest of socks, the search continues."
2.0,"Wrong size.  Was for boyfriend XL.  Ended up S stretch, so I wear."
2.0,"The fit was fine and based off of mixed reviews about being a thin material, I decided to buy it and see for myself. It is definitely see through and not something that I would want my child wearing."
2.0,It's made a little cheap but sterdy. I hung mine on my rearview mirror.
2.0,Wrong size unless you want really skin tight.
2.0,NOT polarized!
2.0,"Constantly slides down, fabric is really thick so not that breathable and now the fabric is tearing. I had threes for about a month when they started tearing. And I didn’t wear them constantly.  Not worth it in any aspect."
2.0,"Loved this bracelet, although I only got to wear for about a week it broke right after, also Mine came without the cross which I didnt really mind because I liked it so much. Too bad it didnt last :("
2.0,Too small. I found them uncomfortable and I was pulling them up continuously.  Maybe I’m just funny about what’s closest to me. I couldn’t keep covered.
2.0,smaller than regular size
2.0,"I really liked this dress when I first wore it. The fit was great and it looked as good as the picture. The fabric is soft and stretchy, not baggy. The length is good. (I'm 5 ft 6, 153 ib, and ordered a Large)<br />HOWEVER.... After wearing it once, to dinner, I washed it in cold water on the delicate cycle, and hung it up to air dry.<br />The black color FADED. Now it looks like an old, rather worn dress after JUST ONE washing.<br />I'm very disappointed and considered sending it back, but feel I can't because it's  (obviously) not in New Condition anymore."
2.0,These are no way xx-large.  I wear a size 8 1/2 W and I could hardly get my foot into them.
2.0,The photos online looks like a soft pink. It arrived as a dirty peach color. The material is stiff and itchy.  Maybe a good wash with softener will make this more comfortable.  Fits as expected.
2.0,Love the looks and the quality; however shoes run too small for a seven and a half size. I now need to make an exchange for a size eight.
2.0,super cute and fit well but the skirt is completely see-through
2.0,It shrinks in the wash. Fabric is scratchy. Color is accurate.
2.0,"The material looks artificial, not attractive thinking about returning and getting a different one."
2.0,"All are the smallest size it seems, but stretch out to the largest.  The bigger you are, the more skin tight it is.<br />That should be made more clear."
2.0,Más grande y más vivo su diseño
2.0,"These are easily 2 sizes too big.  I bought the small for my 10 year old and he's big for his age.  It swallowed him up.  They easily fit me, and I'm 6'/180.  It's made well enough and resembles the Squid Games uniform, so I'll give it 2 stars"
2.0,Light weight cheap feeling  won't last long
2.0,"If you’re like me, there are an overwhelming number of choices for these sweaters. There are so many sellers and so many different colors and prices and all of the sweaters look the same. This one is not the same. These are not sweater material - these are T-shirt material and the sleeve cuffs are different and the way the “sweater” fits is different. I would not buy this particular item again as the other versions are much nicer."
2.0,"i asked if my masked could be fixed because some of the lights on my mask went out, i did not get an answer"
2.0,"Not very ergonomically suited for putting it on as expected. If you do, in order to fit your ears out the holes, it cuts uncomfortably into you neck."
2.0,"I typically wear a size 12 so I got the XL. The top of the dress wouldn't close but the waist and lower part of the dress were exactly the right size. If I had kept it I would have had to wear a tank top under to make it acceptable to wear out in public which is strange because I am busty...40B bra size.... The overall fit was funky and the material was thin and the kind of fabric that wrinkles way to easily. For the price, it was a deal breaker. This dress shouldn't sell for any number in the double digits. I can find better dresses at Walmart. Returned."
2.0,"Not really that good, just average. It’s a tight fit when inserting my Xbox controller and the bottom plastic, which kinda locks the controller is too tight. It almost removed my controller’s face plate. Can’t really use my phone with a cover so I have to remove my cover everytime when inserting it to the phone holder. My old Moga hero controller fits my phone perfectly, but unfortunately it’s only for Android. I only recommend using this on your old controller that you don’t care if scratches your controller."
2.0,It has good fabric but the leather part awful. After first use it damaged and I have to repair myself. And it is not stop when you wear.
2.0,"Great price but, much smaller than anticipated. I think &#34;dainty &#34; would describe best"
2.0,"This isn't the first time I've purchased products from this company that have arrived broken/shattered. I have several friends who are super into geology who tell me that the stones are great quality and obviously not fake, but I've never managed to order a pair and have them arrive undamaged. Guess I've learned my lesson and I'll just have to find a physical store to buy them at."
2.0,"No elastic at the bottom of the legs so they ride up horrendously.  I threw mine out, unusable."
2.0,i brought 3 pairs and the other two i ordered in large and we perfect this i also ordered in large and it was HUGE and i have had to return it. they need to be consistent with their sizing
2.0,"I have only had this bag for 4.5 months, and the strap broke. It was only filled half full. Now I have to take it to a leather repair shop if I am ever going to use it again. The liner in the pockets constantly get caught in the zippers.<br /><br />UPDATE: After my previous review, the seller sent a new purse upon viewing the pictures I sent them. I have not used the new bag yet because I had to get a new purse right away. I really appreciate the attempt ameliorate the situation. Thank you."
2.0,Not that too nice
2.0,Worked for what I needed it for but the quality is not good. The wig hairs expose the cap in many locations (the bangs and the part in the back).
2.0,Pretty dress but fabric is cheap.
2.0,The diamond area is glitter
2.0,"I have a super bad back so I might be extra picky,  they LOOK soft, but the sole is hard and uncomfortable."
2.0,really cheap material. did not look like the picture
2.0,"I’m pretty disappointed with my purchase. I was hoping for a pretty laced mask but all they did was sew a lace pattern to the inside of the mask making you use the mask inside out if you want it to show. Then after about 5 minutes, your face is soaked because it’s the wrong side and non absorbent. Very disappointed."
2.0,"When I first used these, I thought they would be helpful.  I seemed to breathe better, my glasses did not fog up as badly and they were not as hot as a mask alone.  But I have since found that if they have to be worn for more than 30 minutes or so, they leave sore spots on my face and become very uncomfortable.  I would not buy again or recommend to others."
2.0,This was an awkward fit and the cups were mishapened.  I returned it.
2.0,Shirt is very thin
2.0,Size runs small and kind of fit like mens boxes. Also slightly see thru. But for sleepwear ok.
2.0,It is difficult to get on because the zipper only goes half way down and it is difficult to get off because the inside is a fabric like felt and will not slide on or off easily.
2.0,"I wanted to love these - so cute, right!?  They were so big and heavy on my face that I ended up not even bringing them on my trip."
2.0,"I liked the gloves as a liner and could feel the warmth pretty good, however they quit charging after the 6/7 th time being charged."
2.0,Too small. Fits teens or kids heads not adults unless you have a tiny head. I bought about four colors. LOVE the pink and purple one but it’s way to small.
2.0,didn't like! it looks like a half dollar item
2.0,"Way too small to be of any real use. I would not recomment buying it unless you have something larger along with it to use for protection. I even thought of returning it.<br />You can fit passports  (2) in it, but they will bend around your leg.  You can use it for that.  But as far as credit cards and such, it is a hard fit to get anying else in there along with the passports. The passports are the only use I personally will use it for.<br />It does fit around the leg nicely, and it will not fall down."
2.0,"I  removed the item from the bag, tried it on and a button fell off. I wouldn't recommend going a size up, I wear a medium typically, I went a size up to a large and it's pretty big. Hw material is a littlw stretchy which is nice. It was only $9 so probably won't return. If it wasn't for the fit and button issue I would give it 4 stars."
2.0,"This watch band looks attractive.  I also like that it has more adjustments than the stock watch band - so you can make it smaller/bigger as needed.<br /><br />But the quality is way off.<br /><br />The material is a pleather feeling (bonded leather???) material that is very stiff.  It feels like the equivilent of calling ""American Cheese"" cheese - it's more of an imitation cheese product.  But it looks good.<br /><br />My band was slightly too large (20mm ) to neatly clip into one side of the watch face.  Just a hair too big, which caused some wear/bunching when it clipped in.  Once I got it in, it looked like it wouldn't be an issue.<br /><br />The bad is really stiff.  The box says that by wearing it, it'll break it in.  I twisted, curled, and massaged the leather to get it to have more flex.  Granted, I wasn't really applying pressure to it - just rolling/unrolling it.  This action caused the spring catch (that connects to the watch face) to tear, revealing the cheap material.  Less than 30 min of owning it and it is unusuable.<br /><br />The buckle does feel nice and is attractive.  That is the nicest part of the band.<br /><br />I disagree with the box claim of ""Craftsmanship, creating extrodinary quality""."
2.0,Beware that the zipper is on the left side!!! Feels quite awkward to use. Returned it anyway because it didn't fit but what is the deal with a left-handed zipper??
2.0,They are alot smaller than I thought and the picture on the earrings is distorted...you get what you pay for
2.0,Not made well. Fell apart very quick.
2.0,"Came with a huge hole in the armpit. I sewed it but still, that’s frustrating."
2.0,"I returned the item.  I was interested in buying a RED, White & Blue AMERICAN shirt. I have included a photo, but even this pic does not depict how pink the sleeves were.<br />Hope this helps!"
2.0,Doesn't sit well on dress
2.0,"I ordered these shoes to wear around the house while I'm trying to heal up some plantar fasciitis.  Sadly whatever comfort these shoes are supposed to provide, fails greatly.  They feel flat and non supportive.  My old shoes have more comfort.  So, I'm sending them back."
2.0,Broke very easily. This gift only lasted about a week and a half before it snapped. It looked great while it lasted.
2.0,I am not sure if I’ll be happy with this! I got the 2 bags but they have a different quality. The other one is nice and thick looks expensive but other one is so thin and see through
2.0,"It fit fine but I had to go pay someone 10$ to fix the flaw that everyone is posting about not sure why they cut the dress that way and it doesn't look the same as pictured and I even made sure it was coming from the right place like it states to do, I think they are over charging for this dress with them all having that awkward flaw in the side and not looking like the dress the Model has on :/ it's a ok dress if you dont mind getting it fixed or don't mind the funny pointed cut. I thought maybe it's suppose to have the pointed cut to make it baggy on the one side but no, no matter how I tried to adjust it it kept pointing out and looked silly so like I said I payed to get it cut off.."
2.0,This is a cute dress and decent quality but looked like a sack starting right underneath my boobs.  If the tank top portion was longer and maybe it was more defined at the waste I would have loved it.  Maybe mine was a defect as some other reviews shows more material on the top portion ...... just didn't work for my shape.
2.0,Horrible smell to the bag but cute
2.0,"The brocade design is only on the sides of each leg of the hose, not all over. Looks strange."
2.0,"Very cheap belt, forgot to read the material it was made of, NOT REAL Leather!"
2.0,"They look great in the picture, but the straps were really big and didn't lay flat across my feet. Returning them was easy enough though!"
2.0,Way to small could barely move in them besides that I like all the pockets.
2.0,"Way too small and thin, got even smaller in the wash.  I gave them to my daughter with size 7 feet and they're ok but still small.<br /><br />Cute design if you have really small feet."
2.0,The 3 little ones are so scratchy to clothes and things. The big ones are leaving black mark on my fingers after used.
2.0,"The dress was well made with heavy material. I  feel like it was a great value, it just did not fit me. May be my body type, may have been mis-cut not sure."
2.0,"I purchased a size 4, but it was too small. It fit like a size 3."
2.0,My fit bit keeps popping out of the frame of the band.
2.0,I love the print on this however the mask is large..
2.0,"I ordered the XL, just because the reviews said they were on the tight side.  I don't have large ankles, but these were so tight they wouldn't even get past the foot."
2.0,"The stud is too long, causing the ring to stick out too far and get caught in clothing, bed sheets, etc. The stud needs to be shorter."
2.0,"I have plenty of other leggings from other brands, and have not had this problem with them.  They are way too small.  It also said they had a very high cotton to spandex ratio, and they are really plasticky feeling.  I gave them to my daughter, because she doesn't mind that material, and I'd already tried them on after washing with the instructions on the label so I figured I could not return them at that point.  Would not buy again."
2.0,Cute but one earring came broken.
2.0,"Warmth and thickness? They're telling me to mention those words in my review. What a joke? This apron is tiny, the fabric is paper thin, and why would anyone expect an apron to keep you warm anyway?! But yeah, I'm super disappointed. It isn't adult sized, but even for a kid I would not buy this, because the quality of the fabric and the stitching is so poor. I could sew something better for myself, and I suck at sewing. This won't do what I was hoping am apron would do, which is keep hot grease off my shirt when cooking, and kept hot water off my front when washing dishes. This thing, cheap, small thing won't do any of that. The only reason I could think of that someone would buy this for is as a kid's costume I'd they want to pretend to be a cook/baker, barista, waiter, etc. But even for that only if the kid was really small. I'm 5""0 and 128 lbs., so not exactly a big adult."
2.0,"The fabric is way thinner than I hoped it would be and feels pretty cheaply made.  When I say &quot;thin,&quot; I mean you can see my leg hair through them.  When I tried to pull them up, I could hear stitches ripping.  Maybe I should have gone a size up, but they also feel like they are constantly falling down.  Overall I'm pretty disappointed with these pants."
2.0,"Bought a 4x for a present which a size bigger then my mom wears and she couldn't get them on. These run way to small, if they were labeled different they would be fantastic!"
2.0,"Got this for my daughter for Christmas, she wore it once and it broke. She wasn't hard on it at all. Not made very good."
2.0,"I do like these pants, they are comfortable and long enough. The only problem is the waist is incredibly loose. Not only do they not hold your tummy in but they want to fall down. I would say size down, but they fit snug in the thighs. Kind of a weird fit."
2.0,The head circumference is way to small! For a adult woman's head. This hat may work for you if you have thin hair or if you purchase it for a child. Otherwise the color and design is really nice.
2.0,"The body size was OK but the arms are VERY tight. Good for skinny people only, unless you like bulges on display or the blood cut off to your hands."
2.0,"As you wear the brazier, it moves and it's never in place to hold n support your breast !!!"
2.0,"This is made of silk, which means it is thin and light weight.  It is not for cold weather as the product description says.  This would work well in warm weather if it fit well, but it doesn't.  There are loose spaces around the head.  It doesn't stretch much, and there is no way you could pull your head through the face hole to make a gaiter."
2.0,I returned it. It came from China and the XL size would not have fit a 6 year old.
2.0,"They’re super cute including the packages them came in but 3 of them broke trying to install and the next day not even 24 hours, they broke off. I was super upset that it was a complete waste of my money. I tried to hot glue gun them back together def wasn’t doable because they snapped off again. I will try gorilla glue and try"
2.0,"It fits, but not appropriately. I think I would’ve been cited had I gone outside in this. It was skin tight— and outlined the goods betwixt the thighs if you know what I mean, but otherwise it was really sexy…just too tight to realistically wear out in public. I got an XL which is normally perfect for my build — I am tall (5’7) and have a big frame with some curves, but not very large breasts (38B)— and this was literally like a glove, borderline too tight. So I wouldn’t say it’s a standard XL size…it definitely runs small.  Returning."
2.0,Lens flat best for that type of face and frame is flimsy easy to bend.
2.0,"Material is not soft, I repeat not soft. It's also dry clean only... I ordered a medium I am 5'7&#34; 125 and it fit perfectly. Looks nice, going to see what happens if I wash it delicate cycle, maybe it will get soft? That or I'm out a shirt. Looks nice,  fit well, just scratchy and the dry clean only sucks."
2.0,I have to learn to buy larger ftom the Internet.
2.0,Not very high quality.  And the watchband was cheap and hard to close.
2.0,"The lense is way more purple than it is blue, so be aware of that."
2.0,Toes of both boots fell apart to the point the steel toe piece fell out but it was past the return time frame.
2.0,I’m a busty person so the size L fit short. Size up for a better fit.
2.0,"The section of the dress at the waist looks terrible and the shoulder part is way to big to fit comfortably, Generally I can make things work that don't fit but this is just nothing like the picture."
2.0,The product was open and spilled all over the packaging.
2.0,Low quality. Makes ears itchy and red.
2.0,The material is great and the colors are beautiful.  It looks just like the pic.  My only issue is that the size chart in the description did not advise of shoulder width and was not accommodating to my 17 inches.  The sizing selection Does not indicate if US size or not.  I am unable to wear it.
2.0,These were really difficult to assemble
2.0,Very small and cheaply made.
2.0,Runs short n small
2.0,It was a lot more stiff than the original band
2.0,One of the shoes literally fell apart after the first wear. Very disappointed when I realized how cheaply they were made. Waste of my money for one wear.
2.0,"Pretty warm, but the top is a little off.  Probably would not purchase again."
2.0,After a month -- splitting and stitching becoming undone.  Recommend PASSING on this one.
2.0,Runs alittle small and material is like silky
2.0,Couldn't hardly read the words in the middle of the piece. Didn't look much like the picture.
2.0,I thought the end of this was threaded as to assist with jewelry insertion for harder to reach piercings (like the tregus ot rook) but the end just has a little pin that loses connection during transfer. This is fine if I was using it on customers because I can see but I got this to assist me with my jewelry at home and its basically useless.
2.0,"Fit very small, very poor quality."
2.0,The material of the dress looks and reminds me of a witches Halloween costume......
2.0,"The bra itself was gorgous, the band was wide and comfortable, but even though I ordered a C cup (I'm a B), the cups were way to small and didn't look flattering at all."
2.0,Subpar shades for low cost
2.0,"I love the yin yang cat picture itself. It just doesnt look as defined & bright in person as the item picture. It is a very thin, slick material. I dont have it near to read the label, or see if there is on, cant remember off the top of my head. But Id go with a polyester type fabric feel. The cats/color is rather muted. If it had been a regular thickness, cotton tank tee shirt with the sharp, bright y/y cats, it would be perfect. I wouldn't buy it again. But I LOVE the y/y cat print itself."
2.0,"Not only is the material pretty see through but the sizing is WAY off. I ordered a small for my daughter who is a size 0. Well, it fits a 9 yr old not my 17 yr old.  My 9yr old is a little girls size 6 and these fit her like a kids 7/8 would. Absolutely ridiculous that the sizing says a US size 3 would fit in these."
2.0,It was supposed to be 3 to 6 months but fit more like at least 12 months. She couldn't even wear it.
2.0,I'm not thrilled with this purchase.  It makes noise when I move and I don't like the way it feels against my skin.  I wore it to the beach and it made me feel cold when the sleeves were rolled down.
2.0,"The message is great and the design of the bracelet is really nice. The leather is pretty thin and has stretched out. The &#34;button&#34; hole has stretched out, even after I stitched it, and it keeps falling off. My husband hasn't been wearing it because he doesn't want to lose it."
2.0,Writing was reversed. Printing was cheap.
2.0,"Inexpensive but, as they say, you get what pay for...very thin, not that padded, but OK if that’s what you want."
2.0,It arrived promptly but the earrings were missing of the backs. Have to find one that fits ro be able to wear.<br /><br />Not recommended.
2.0,The sleeves are super wide and makes the shirt look cheap. Love the colors and style but the sleeves ruin it.
2.0,"I received this winder as a Christmas gift in 2016, and as of July 2018 it has stopped working.  The motor seems to have weakened over time, and it no longer has enough power to start spinning while holding two watches. It will spin while holding one watch, but not fast enough to actually wind the watch. It appears it will soon die completely.<br /><br />When new, this winder was nearly perfect. The box looks great, the controls are intuitive, the spin speed was sufficient to keep my watches ticking, and the motor was quiet. However, nobody should expect to buy a new watch winder every 18 months, so I can't recommend this product.<br /><br />Finally, I contacted the manufacturer (Love Nest) directly to see if they would replace the winder. They had the audacity to suggest I should buy a new one.  But at least they responded."
2.0,"Made from polyester, thick polyester...um no.  Maybe I missed that part in the description."
2.0,"Great Concept, but it fell apart very quickly. The wood material cracks very easily."
2.0,This is very pretty but small. I don’t think it would last long.
2.0,Made out of very cheap plastic. I would have returned them but it's more of a hassle then it's worth.
2.0,It was huge. Maybe a couple of sizes smaller would have been better.
2.0,Shoes fit great but after the second time my 3 yr old wore them the velcro ripped.
2.0,"Too small and PINK. Not a natural color, inless you’re a baby pig. And it’s way too small and not much padding. I was expecting more with “double thickness”. I wear an A, so I bought an A. I’m a small-framed woman (32” bust). This size may work for even smaller woman, like a tiny Chinese woman, or a pre-teen. If you don’t mind the color, I’d recommend going up a size or two. And if you’re worried about “double thinkness” being too thick, it’s not. This will not add any noticeable fullness. Sorry to say, and if that’s what you’re looking for, try another brand.<br /><br />I was hoping this would be comparable to the name brand, but alas, will be dishing out $50+ to get a better one. And will be returning these little pink babies."
2.0,Didn't care for the actual color or feel of the fabric. Didn't feel of quality and so I returned it right away.
2.0,No pin so the item doesn’t attach to a suit jacket or dress shirt.
2.0,"It's pretty, but doesn't lay nicely.  Wanted to flip over, definitely get what you pay for."
2.0,"I ordered this for my 11 year old daughter.  Her choice.  While it is described as a kid's watch, it is actually a full adult size watch.  Only the wrist band is short enough to call it a kid's watch.  I think it's bulky, but my daughter still loved it.  Unfortunately, the second hand was broken right out of the box.  It came loose and just dangled there.  We returned it for a replacement.  That new watch worked fine for only two weeks.  The second hand again fell off it's mount.  With the exact same thing happening twice in a row, this is clearly a manufacturing defect.  I would recommend shopping for a different manufacturer."
2.0,"Cute dress, way smaller. Gave it to my cousin who wears a Large."
2.0,I loved this purse when I first got it but the inside lining is now coming apart in 3 areas.  Had I seen the return policy I would have returned it.
2.0,one side is longer than the other!
2.0,"Husband enjoyed,it but this,looks nothing like the pic. Completly see through which is ok but I expected it to look like the pic. Also the cut is in the middle not over to the side with ruffles cheaply made but served its,purpose I feel it was a waste of money not planning on wearing again.disappointed to say the least."
2.0,Smaller and flimsier than expected. Also did not like that the zipper did not fully unzip. Made it difficult to use the bag. Returned.
2.0,"I waited awhile to review this and just tried it on again, but I still think it is awful. I actually ordered two different similar sets from this brand. The black and white and what looks like a weird grey/green and white. I’m going to review them both here, because I see both sets falling under the same reviews.<br /><br />When I initially ordered both sets, there were completely different pictures used for advertising and they both looked really cute and comfortable.... obviously very deceiving. The new pictures that are up are more representative of the outfit, but still look better online than in person.<br /><br />I was immediately disappointed when I opened the package. I didn’t even have to try on to know. The material alone destroyed all appeal in this outfit for me. It screams cheap. The tags say 35% cotton and 65% polyester. Whatever it is, it looks awful to me and does not feel like something I want to lounge in. The fit is also strange, not flattering. Honestly, I got these to wear as comfy pajamas around the house, but not only would I not want to wear this with even close friends around, but I don’t think I could force myself to wear it alone. They feel weird. They look weird.<br /><br />I guess I was expecting like thin, semi-stretchy, but flowy version of sweatshirt material. Nope. They are strange, somewhat shiny, cheap-looking. I think I know what happened. The original pictures that were up were probably never the item the company was actually selling. I suspect it was a random set made by a different company that Pofash was going to copy. Now they have updated the pictures of a model wearing the real clothes. Just looking at the new updated pictures, I NEVER would have ordered. This is not a good business practice at all.<br /><br />I would get into the details and fit, but other reviewers have done that and I’m telling you, it isn’t great. What I will say is that they are mediums and all technically “fit” me. I’m 5’6” and about 145 lbs right now, but they look ridiculous. The waistband on the black set is way too tight for a medium. I could rant on and on about how hideous and ill-fitting these are.<br /><br />I even showed my friend the original picture when I ordered and she thought they looked so cute just like I did. Then I showed her in person and we both laughed together. I’m not sure what to do with these.<br /><br />The tops look absolutely cheap no matter what. Pair it with the pants and it is laughable. I may be able to wear the pants as pajamas with a random shirt.... MAYBE. I’m going to try, because I hate being wasteful.<br /><br />Anyway, I would have taken pictures of them, but others already have, and it is just bad as others have also mentioned. I’m giving 2 stars simply because they aren’t ripped or falling apart at the seams.<br /><br />I just really could not recommend these to anyone on this earth. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know/thanks!"
2.0,"Did not like the material, it is too clingy and does not flow off the body as shown in the pictures. Product was returned."
2.0,"I returned the item becasue It was too large. I couldn't see in front of my eyes. I thought the sheild would be a good idea especially as a protection from coronavirus, and the sun but honestly I felt suffocated."
2.0,"This shirt runs very small.  Material is very thin and clings, very unflattering."
2.0,"A so-so dress, unflattering fit, mediocre quality."
2.0,The breast area was horrible. Would show EVERYTHING. Straps were useless. And was way to short. Not horrible. But not great.
2.0,Love the look but didnt fit my j3
2.0,I always wear Gloria Vanderbilt jeans but these were too small and cut weird. Very disappointed as I like the pull on jeans and they do not seem to be available any more.
2.0,"Please go get the $5.82 kids version face shield which is really good! I bought both Kids and adults shield, but finally returned the adult one. The adult shield use very hard plastic which I think it’s easy to break. The kids one is nicely made through."
2.0,"I didn’t care for the dress at all, so much so I didn’t even ask my husband to look at it on. It really just didn’t look the same as the picture to me. The return took a while, but wasn’t too difficult."
2.0,"They look great, but snow boots are supposed to keep the snow out, and these absolutely do not do that.  Would've returned, but had to wear them in the snow to discover this major defect.  My 4 year olds feet are cold and wet outside."
2.0,The shoulder strap was missing and the name plate is on crooked.
2.0,"I usually wear a bra size 42D. Using the size chart in the listing, I decided to get this strapless bra in an XXL. The bra is stretchy and fits, but it doesn’t provide much of any support. I think I’m just too busty for this style of bra. It might be okay for providing minimal support around the house, but it’s definitely not something I can wear in public."
2.0,"Shells too small, mermaid very small.  Picture doesn’t show proper size."
2.0,"My wife says: The polka dots and cut of this skirt with the ruffle are cute, but it runs small (I got an XL and had looked at the size chart) and the waist only has limited stretch even with the drawstring design - could barely get it over my hips! It is thicker than expected, and felt almost like parachute material. Note that for a shorter person, it is more of a long skirt than midi length."
2.0,"Very strange. Half insert from the front of the ear, half from the back. Otherwise good quality."
2.0,Too gaudy - colors are nice but doesnt fit right and more for the hippy than the office.
2.0,"Smaller than expected, bottom hem was coming apart out of bag  dingleberries fell off inside jacket on way to party"
2.0,These dresses are way shorter than depicted in the photos.
2.0,Very comfy and just what I was looking for except the third pair of leggings that I wore ( The color I would wear most often!)  had a hole in it and it looks like it’s worn in another place that will develop a hole. Hoping it won’t happen with another pair or I will be returning them.
2.0,One of the straps broke while I was trying it on. Had to return.
2.0,"Gloves and pin worked perfectly for Halloween outfit.  HAT was too small.  Weird style, poor material and stitching."
2.0,Item was listed as a medium<br />But clearly is a large
2.0,Can't get the earposts through my ears.  Looked nice but can't use
2.0,I ordered a large because people said to size up...It has no shape and just hangs...It is not flattering..I have only wore it once...Definitely not a go to shirt...I dont know if a smaller size would be more flattering...I would say buy something else in the same price range...
2.0,Not true to size. Bigger than expected and not soft. Fluffy fur is only on outside not in the inner lining
2.0,"Fits ok- I wish it was a little more roomy, since it’s sleepwear.<br />I don’t like the material, it’s stiff. I wish it was softer."
2.0,"Soft and comfortable and durable... but they sent the wrong pattern, totally wrong. Nice leggings otherwise"
2.0,That's why the low star
2.0,IS OK....
2.0,"Poor style at waist. Unlike any other bike short I tried. Unable to get small and medium over my thighs without hearing stitches pop, and I am size 4."
2.0,too small and the material is cheap
2.0,"I bought this robe for a lightweight summer robe. Normally wear an XL, read that this ran small and the only other option was a 3XL. I bought it in the 3XL and it is way too small. Will be sending it back. Very disappointed"
2.0,"Product runs VERY small! I got an XL and I typically wear a Med to Large in Compression gear and it was still small on me. Short on the waist so it rides up when you run, even a little short to be tucked in and worn as base layer."
2.0,Cute but very thin and not well made in my opinion. Look like they just cut the sleeves off with a cheap pair of scissors & didnt bother to make it neat afterwards. I would not recommend as an actual garment for your child to wear multiple times. I gave it 2stars because I'm only using it as part of a costume for a family video we're doing. Havent had my baby cousin try it on yet but will update on sizing as soon as I get him in it. He wears 3T so I ordered this in the 3years size<br /><br />And it did fit but just barely. Glad he only needed it for one wear because this will surely shrink in the wash. I'd recommend sizing up if you want to be sure your little fella or lady will fit it.
2.0,"Unless you want very tight, ( extremely small waist)  capri length pants, don't buy these! I was very disappointed with these, described as ""pants"" ."
2.0,"Color was nice. Dress was heavy, took a long time to lace up corset back and returning was a downright nightmare!"
2.0,Much smaller than I had expected. I could never wear this without a tank top underneath. The slit opens up too.
2.0,"Cute style, but the material is SUPER cheap."
2.0,Can barley they are purple
2.0,"Too small, listed as XXL but did not come close to fitting like all my other XXL shirts, had to give it to my son."
2.0,I thought this dress was going to be amazing. It looks so pretty in the pictures and it actually looked really good in person too. It was good quality and heavy material. But the fit was just off somehow. I think the bodice part needs to be more fitted and the waistband needs to be higher maybe? It just was not flattering at all. I got a size S and I usually wear a size 4/6. Yet it somehow made me look fat. I had to return it sadly.
2.0,"I typically wear small/medium depending on whether something is fitted and/or the material. I wanted this to be a little oversized, but still went with a size small based on the reviews. Way too big. Falling off me, so much material and so long. I have more than enough bust to fill it out, and I'm still swimming. Had to return."
2.0,"If I wear this slip again it would have to be after I have it altered.  It fell right off of me in public. Very embarrassing.  The length, color and fabric are all great, but the sizings is all wrong."
2.0,These are large.  They hang down pretty far off my ear.  I won't be able to wear them.
2.0,"Granted, I'm tall, but these are really short. They come just below the calf. Not pleased."
2.0,Thin cheap looking material
2.0,"Frames are very cheaply made. Lenses have almost no tent to them. They are cute to wear styled with an outfit, but other than to accessorize, they are pretty pointless. They do look exactly like what is pictured and fit my face well."
2.0,"I ordered XXL which is larger than my ordinary size. These look like they would fit a tall medium sized teenager.  However after some tugging I could get them on. The material is very stretchy! They are too tight for wearing to ride though.<br />I can comment on construction and style -  they are cute and have a silicone printed seat for security in the saddle. They have side pockets that are narrow but will fit a phone if you cram it in hard enough.  The color is good and the material is soft. After a lifetime of riding horses, I’ve learned a few things about riding breeches. Riding tights like these need to have a crotch gusset and either no inner leg seams or flat lock seams. These have a seam on the inner leg that will probably chafe after some time in the saddle."
2.0,"This runs HUGE. I'm normally a large, but read the reviews and got a medium. I'm swimming in this thing! Its so long and wide. That's what I get for ordering online."
2.0,"Beautiful dress however it is short and if you have 5lbs extra, it shows it."
2.0,Returned - I was hoping for a nice dress for work but this dress is VERY tight. The material clings
2.0,Will be returning. Dress is cute but skirt way too small.t
2.0,"They won't stay on my head, every time I try to wear them they fall off and cut my lip.  Way too heavy."
2.0,Straps don’t have good adhesive! They keep covered off!
2.0,"Comparing this version to the previous ones and namely (Prestige Model), this one is just a failure starting from how it's packed in the box and ending up with how durable it is. Below are the major points that I think everyone should skip this model for:-<br /><br />1- The 3 in 1 version comes loose in its Fidelo product box. I received almost all interchangeable faces scratched before even using them as they were simply not covered with anything, not even plastic. (Check photos)<br />2- The new wallet is almost double the thickness of the Prestige model just because of the interchangeable faceplates. Which I believe are nice but functionality and compactness are what makes this product nice (Check Photos).<br />3- There are 24 screws that you need to deal with whenever you want to change anything in the wallet including changing the faces or even changing the money clip. It's true that there is an excellent quality screwdriver provided for free, but I'm buying a wallet here. I'd rather save money and get the faces covered with plastic film instead.<br />4- The screws that hold everything in place are made of Black PVD coated stainless steel. For those who know about PVD coating, it can easily be washed out during screwing unscrewing revealing the original cover beneath it. It's nice of them to include 12 extra screws, but it would have been better to use a more durable material, perhaps keep the stainless steel uncoated!<br />5- The optional cash band supplied with the wallet (to replace the money clip) is completely useless, it's too thick to be placed between the wallet and the faceplate, fixing this by making a special groove for that strap is as important as making a groove for the money clip. Otherwise, the faceplate will never flush with the wallet.<br /><br />I really hope Fidelo can look into this, I was excited to use my new wallet but I just went back to my original Prestige as it's slimmer, lighter, and smarter."
2.0,doesnt look very good on.
2.0,These are going to totally shrink after the first wash. Really cheap material. Wanted these for my daughter for softball practice but they'll probably end up being house shorts or pajama bottoms....
2.0,"These gloves were purchased to wear while running. I’ve had them for approximately 2 weeks and 5 runs. The gloves work and function well, keep very warm even when wet. Unfortunately two seams on the right hand glove are already failing and pulling apart. Contacted the seller to report the issue and receive a new pair and was redirected to file a warranty claim through Arcteryx. I own many other products and this is the first issue I’ve ever experienced in the quality of the construction and hope they will stand behind the product."
2.0,"This has such a pretty design and color; however, the fabric is horrible, it is literally like tissue paper. The front was too open for me so I put a safety pin in the inside and the fabric literally ripped apart after using it the first time. I’m so disappointed because I really liked the jumper, but the quality is just not worth the price."
2.0,This is so thin especially the blazer not what I expected
2.0,To small got one same size that fits good i gave it away
2.0,Fo bigger breasted women I would not recommend. Doesn't fit right. Smaller women have it. Not comfortable
2.0,"The dress looks beautiful on the model, but looked very differently on me.  I think the sizing was right, but maybe I am not tall enough to pull it off. I am 5ft and as soon as I put it on I felt like a frumpy old woman."
2.0,These arrived damp feeling and have a very strong chemical odor. Would definitely have to wash before even trying on. Bad.
2.0,"this shirt is like paper thin you can see right through it, also feels like you'd rip it taking it off. the XL fits my 100lb wife. i have never returned any clothing on Amazon, but this ones going back."
2.0,"The material is too thin so it is a see through. It fits like a glove in the sense that it is very tight. Overally speaking, it it not to my taste. I did not wear it once and donated to a charity store with the tag on."
2.0,"I was happy when I pulled it out of the box, and for the first few times wearing it and then the black started wearing off the belt and purple is exposed.  Within 2 weeks of wearing the belt, it has totally fallen apart!  Not worth buying!"
2.0,"Normally wear small in shirts. This medium is snug, but will not return since it is $6.50 return fee!"
2.0,Runs small.  Cheap material and quality.
2.0,"The head band looked great when we got it, and was a super fit. We washed it and the Nike emblem fell off. It was very disappointing for my daughter."
2.0,"Purchased dress very cute ,runs extra small but not made for women who has a pear shape body  very stretchy fabric is a plus..dress made for smaller size women has an hour glass figure"
2.0,"Very nice sweater, runs very small. Material and manufacturing good."
2.0,"Nice rings for a decent quality. Colors are nice and there is a decent array of options. However, when I received my rings, the container was completely shattered and I had to sift through broken plastic to get my rings out, and I am missing one. Not sure when it fell out but I kept them all together in one place when I sifted through the plastic so there's no way I have it. Very upset as I intended to use the clear case to keep them in."
2.0,Nice shirt but I usually wear size XL. Bought the XXL size and it wasn't roomy enough for me. Wanted to wear it on Valentine's Day but have to send it back. Disappointing.
2.0,These are very thin and do not stay put
2.0,Were not real turquoise
2.0,I loved this dress when I saw it on Amazon. Online it looks wonderful but the material is similar to that of a Halloween costume.  Well I guess you get what you pay for...
2.0,I expected more for $56 bucks. The jewel is very small and the chain is horrible quality. It does not twist and it looks like a toy chain. It’s too short as well. Came in a blue pouch (no gift box) with a zipper inside a plastic bag. The jewel itself is very dark and not bright at all in color.
2.0,Unfortunately they don't fit
2.0,I loved the bralette when I tried it on but the strap came off before I got the chance the wear it out !
2.0,"I was so excited waiting on this dress...  material is super thin so just kind of hangs, not flattering.  Retuned it.  Ordered large"
2.0,"These are nice quality, but they do run small."
2.0,"I have had this bag for a couple of weeks now and already the lining on the inside of the bag is tearing. I realize this bag is cheaper than similar bags of it's style but I am still pretty disappointed with it's quality. I use it for my workout gear so there is nothing that would really tear at the fabric. The only reason I gave two stars is because of the bags size, aesthetics, and layout, however maybe I just got unlucky with mine as the inside liner is loose and showing wear and tear after only a couple weeks."
2.0,I thought it was old fashioned looking. Nice dress if that's what you're looking for. Great price. Or maybe it's just me!
2.0,This necklace was very disappointing.  It's dull with very little definition.  I'm sending it back.
2.0,It looks like the picture but fits way different than expected. The sleeves are very wide and droopy. Not very flattering.
2.0,I have purchased these bras in store and have always purchased the same size. Online the size I ordered was the same as purchase in store however it was smaller and tighter. I return the item.
2.0,I’ve been losing a little weight.  I thought this was a great way to keep working and not hiking my pants up constantly until I could buy a smaller size.<br />Hopefully the second and third belt will last a bit longer but I did not purchase them thinking they were disposable.
2.0,"I read the negative reviews for this product and I ignored them. That was a mistake. In spite of careful washing/handling of my precious new underwear 1) within a week all three pair shrunk considerably, making for some dicey wear issues 2) by week three, the fact that they shrunk almost beyond the point of wearing wasn't much of an issue because one of them completely came apart and had to be scraped 3) by week four, a second one was clinging to life mostly because I am too hard-headed to call it and throw them out.<br /><br />So, it you're a wear them for a month and throw them out kind of guy and can correctly estimate the size you need to order, these are for you!<br /><br />Oh, I gave them two stars because for that first glorious week, they were really nice."
2.0,"I had to return this product. I LOVED the style so much that I debated keeping it, but the quality is so poor. It is definitely not worth the price."
2.0,"I never thought I'd say this, but, too many pockets.  I cannot ever find what I need.  It might be great for a really organized person.  I am only moderately organized."
2.0,Wasn't sewn straight and came with a broken strap
2.0,"It is flimsy, would like it better if it was stouter, it just flops over. Would like it much better if it stood on its own."
2.0,All the charms easily falls off
2.0,"Within a week one of the cloth loops that hold the bungee strap came unraveled. It's been 4 months and now all the loops are unraveled and the Velcro that holds the tongue to the straps barely holds. I also bought a pair for my son in blue and while his loops held up longer, the Velcro in the strap did not. Overall poorly constructed."
2.0,I've had this product less than 6 months and the edging is coming apart.
2.0,"The item which I received, was not as pictured. Its closer to tarnished bronze.  I'm very disappointed."
2.0,Soft but no waist support. These slide down all day long
2.0,I did not realize when I ordered it that the watch band did not have a metal clasp. I don't like the way the band clasps because in the past my watches fall off due to not being secure.  So I won't be using this one for that reason :(
2.0,I am not happy about the cups. They're always falling out or folding up inside the bra. I literally had to sew each one in to work.
2.0,Bought for our Christmas photos how ever the shirt was too tight and the pants too big. It was super cute but the sizing isn’t the best.  Didn’t care for the Material the shirt is made out of either.
2.0,Not impressed with quality. Waste of money. Two stars instead of 1 because at least the wolf photo is on metal and not construction paper
2.0,Is this a child's purse? Very disappointed and couldn't return it as I just am such a procrastinator when it comes to returning things
2.0,this was to small all over but the swimsuit  was pretty
2.0,Very cheap quality. Had returned.
2.0,"The pattern on the back of the shirt is out of line with the front pattern, which is disappointing.  The yellow belt image and side images on the front are about 3 inches lower on the back, so the pattern isn't uniform.  It's not enough for me to return the shirt, but it is noticeable and annoying."
2.0,It was cheap and you can tell. It’ll serve its purpose though.
2.0,"Not sized right, very hard to put on and take off would have to order 2 sizes up just to get up over ankle.  Nice quality but need something I can put on and off in a hurry."
2.0,"Cheaply made, not heavy, not sherpa-lined inside the hood like the pictures show. I don't recommend it, though my daughter's boyfriend said she'll like it. I wish I would have seen comments before buying - this is definitely not a winter coat. This coat will work well in spring and fall. Definitely not worth the $30 plus the shipping charge."
2.0,"It is pretty. Iffy fabric, but it looked nice. Just not anything like real US sizing"
2.0,way too small and it doesn't come in any other sizes anywhere else on the internet either'
2.0,"Pretty but Flimsy, eye came off the silver frame. Chain broke at the fastening clamp. You pay what you get."
2.0,"As far as I can tell, these glasses do nothing but make everything amber-colored. No effect on glare at all."
2.0,I love them.. But I've only worn 3 time and they are starting to desegregate ... Poor quality
2.0,It’s not purple it’s pink!
2.0,Cheap and uncomfortable material. No stretch to fabric. Not true to size-runs small.
2.0,Mid rise my ass! These things are low waisted like a muthafucka but they aren’t see through<br />I wanted to love them but they will be returned
2.0,"Looks good and worked fine..... until it didn't.  It's cheap so not reasonable to expect it to last as long as high quality.  But still, 3 months?  Come on man!"
2.0,This fit as expected however the bottom color appears blue and white in the photo and was actually black and white. Not what I expected.  Will return.
2.0,disappointed with this because the clasp is VERY difficult for ME to open.
2.0,The top fit fine but the bottoms were too small.
2.0,"The picture looks great, but the construction is very poor. I was disappointed when I received it. The chain is uneven and does not lay properly. I'm honestly shocked to see so many good reviews. Maybe the piece I received was a dud?"
2.0,"I ordered the size based on the measurement chart, but when I tried it on it was a bit too large. It felt very boxy and the stitching across the chest did not quite match the rest of the dress color. The dress color itself is lovely, I wish it fit better."
2.0,Has chemical smell that doesn't go away
2.0,"Only about 1 year later and this monkey is falling apart! He hasn't even been &#34;played&#34; with he's just sat in the toy hammock in my daughters room (now 14months old) until 2 months back. First, one eye fell off, so I decided okay fine I took the other off since it's a chocking hazard and used fabric glue to make him new eyes. Now today, the yarn hair at the top of the head all fell out and the side of his body is tearing open eposing the stuffing. I don't normally believe in this saying but in the case of this monkey &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;"
2.0,The shoe is too small
2.0,"It fit good except across the top , I have large breast and it was too loose on top left a big gap to see down thru, but I think the next size down would be to small everywhere else."
2.0,"The flops are cute, but the plastic piece that goes between the toes of tiny children should be thinner and softer.  And even though the starfish are made of a durable foam, it is hard and the points dig into the tops of her feet.  I had to shave away some of the foam where the points where making small sores on her skin.  :o(<br /><br />Basically, they could have been designed more kid friendly.<br /><br />That said,  she loves them. (She wanted flip-flops more than anything!)"
2.0,Sleeves were way to tight
2.0,"The pants arrived with a rip in the leg. The size is also off. I usually wear large, so I sized up to extra large but they are still too small.  I will probably return them."
2.0,"These earrings are made out of plastic, don't be fooled."
2.0,Way too small in shoulders and too big at waist.
2.0,Run quite small....I have size six foot and they are a little too tight...
2.0,Red bleed through decal
2.0,Tiny waist for a 22. The waist was more like a 16 or 18
2.0,"Cheap, runs extremely small, horrible material not sweatshirt material at all. And sleeves are horribly long like ridiculously too long."
2.0,"Cute embroidery, but clearly machine stitched.  Fabric thin and synthetic feeling.  Photo looks like hand stitched, substantial cotton top.  Negative on both counts."
2.0,"Loved the Silver posts I bought. However, the fasteners have the hole in the wrong place, so couldn't secure the earring properly. Can I use one from other earrings I have? Yes, but I shouldn't HAVE TO!!!<br />Great attention to detail you morons!<br />So many companies out there that could give a crap about their product! You just might be one of them! 😠😡"
2.0,It’s smaller than expected
2.0,SO small and full of elastic
2.0,Price is good for the 12 pcs. But for.protection from covid forget it. This is more for fashion and just covering nose and mouth but does not provide protection from the virus. Though it is very light weight and fashionable
2.0,I had this shirt delivered to my twin brother for his Birthday.  I have not actually seen the shirt on him.  We live 430 miles apart. He said he liked the feel of the shirt but it is way too large.  When I ordered it it only had XL availability. I will be seeing him soon and we are going to see if this shirt will fit my husband. I’m bummed it was too large for him. He is a Harley Davidson fanatic.
2.0,It is okay but not worth what I paid or it.
2.0,My daughter says it fits as expected but the material is itchy and doesn't feel like silk.
2.0,"I bought a bigger size thinking that when it shrinks, it would be perfect.  It was actually the perfect size before washing it.  But now it's too small.  My daughter was happy to acquire them from me though. lolz.<br />Buy a couple sizes bigger or don't ever wash them."
2.0,"Initially, I thought this watch band looked awesome!  Alas..<br /><br />I don't know why, but it did not occur to me to think the back and sides of this seemingly cool rock print band would be anything other than grey or black.  For some reason they chose white.. which stands out (not in a good way) like a sore thumb.  The small band to keep the top band from lifting up is also white - which it is in the picture also but I had not noticed.<br /><br />The band itself seems cheap.  It's stiff and the rock print design looks like it will flake or fade off before too long with use.  I'm very tempted to return it if I can find the time to do so.<br /><br />Would not buy again."
2.0,Ordered blue came in as grey.
2.0,"The picture online looks as though it were rose gold, but this belt is gold. It fits ok though."
2.0,Cute looking shoes but can’t be worn without socks. My son has significant blisters on both his feet from them
2.0,I thought this scarf would have a lot brighter colors ... but they are pretty muted. Am disappointed; as I was hoping for brighter colors like the photo shows.  Thank you
2.0,Nice bracelet but way to big
2.0,They aren’t waterproof. Water resistant maybe.
2.0,I ordered this based on the size chart. I am large busted so I went according to their measurements. Nope - should have ordered by size instead. The suit I received was easily 3 sizes too big. Returning disappointed.
2.0,The shirt and shorts color dont match. Shirt looks faded
2.0,Esta super transparente la verdad a mi no me gustan así no estibaba es tela rígida y a mi así no me gustan. Tienen que tener un forro para sentirse bien.
2.0,"I ordered this set in Navy Blue, size Small. I'm 5'4"" and 113 lbs. The top fits great. The straps are adjustable and the fabric is soft.<br /><br />The bottoms are way too tight around the waist, though. You would have to be 100 lbs or less for the bottoms to fit comfortably and not have the elastic dig in. Seeing as how this set is made in China, it wouldn't surprise me if these are Asian sizes, which are significantly smaller than US/UK.<br /><br />I probably would have done well with a Small top and a Medium bottom, but since you can't mix and match, I can only wear half of this set.<br /><br />I'll be donating this to my local thrift store since I can't return it, and I advise anyone interested in this to be mindful of the sizing."
2.0,The Color is nice but the quality and fit were odd.<br />it also hurt when i wore it
2.0,Just know that their idea of taffeta feels just like the material a tent is made of.
2.0,"I’m not one to return when I didn’t spend a lot, but these only lasted about 5 wears.🫤"
2.0,"Did not fit well, too large. Gave to a friend but too small"
2.0,The band on this watch was very loose  and it broke.
2.0,"I am 5’2” and this doesn’t even cover my bottom. It is about half the length as the one on the pictured model. The material is soft and the sleeve colors are not as bright as pictured, but still very pretty. I usually wear M or L but ordered XL as Asian apparel tends to be smaller. The fit is perfect except for the fact is is much TOO SHORT. Apparently the pictured model is about 4’ tall! This would never be considered a cardigan and the picture should be re-taken to reflect the true product that is shipped! Very misleading so only 2 stars!"
2.0,The straps were in unraveling!
2.0,"I hate the zipper on this bag! No storage, just a wallet. Carry lipstick- not with this bag! In a hurry to grab a credit card- not with this bag!<br />Not worth the price!"
2.0,"It’s a very cute and sturdy golden snitch pendant, but the chain was bludgeoned by the weight of the pendant. The chain broke after my grandson wore it for 2 days. If you want it, you should seek a sturdier neck chain or cord for the snitch to make it a keeper. Otherwise you’ll be chasing a snitch that’s flying off the chain."
2.0,"I wanted to make these work, but although the leggings fit the skirt was smaller and did not fit around hips. I am curvy and a small behind."
2.0,"This dress looked super cute on the website, and to be honest in person too. The pink was the exact shade I wanted. Only problem is, it's so see through I couldn't wear it at all. Very disappointing since I was planning on wearing it for our baby gender reveal. Ended up having to just wear a pink shirt. Do not recommend!"
2.0,I ordered a small and was sent a medium.  Color is matched the picture perfectly.
2.0,"The construction and fit of these seem great, but unfortunately they are far from waterproof. Water soaks right through them and gets my shoes and socks very wet in even a light to moderate rain."
2.0,They are very pretty. But do not stay latched closed. Always falling out of my wife’s ears.
2.0,Unfortunately this dress was way too small. I wear a large and ordered a large and I couldn't even wrap the dress around enough to close it. It's also a very thin material.
2.0,I bought it for my daughter in law for Mother's Day she said it is pretty but looks cheaply made.
2.0,"The sets dont even match! Aqua bottom with blue top and other set is hot pink and magenta. Tight fit. Needed help to get the top off. Not sure I want to try again if they dont look like the colors shown or fit according to their size chart. Im 5'7 and weigh 174. My chest measures 42 inches, waist 32, hips 42."
2.0,"I’m 5.4” and this dress is to short, don’t buy it unless you are 4.5” going to a bigger size won’t  make the dress longer. I’m returning this week."
2.0,"I usually wear an XL so I ordered 2XL to be safe because sometimes these things run so small, and it's true with this product. It's cute but the size is off."
2.0,"This product does not have a good quality. The letters on the leather keychain are partially colored, and it’s easy to erase them. They printed on the box, the text instead of the draw. I gave instructions but they were not followed."
2.0,"The material is very nice. But honestly? It’s just ugly. There’s no other way to describe it. It’s hideous. And it’s definitely a bit too big, so the slight baginess doesn’t help. I will be returning it."
2.0,"These earrings are so cheap looking. The ends I’d the tassels have the white thread sticking out and the top portion only has beads on half of it, which shows when you wear them. Would not recommend purchasing."
2.0,The quality of these ski googles are subpar. The material is very flimsy and made very cheaply. The lens are like a plastic sheet. They fog up almost instantly once you put them on. I guess the saying “you pay for what you get”  stands true for this set.  Don’t waste your time ordering these unless you are using them as play toys or part of a costume.
2.0,Gave to my daughter got a med this is for very tall women
2.0,"Defective product, the botton literally felt off i had to use the belt, size was perfect but quality for the price not so much , you can find somehting better at the same price at sports stores"
2.0,It wasn't what I expected. I thought it was smaller. I wanted it as a simple nice gift. The tree is the size of my palm!! :(
2.0,Love the colors but they ate very stiff. I have washed them but find them too scratchy
2.0,"The material is not pleasant to the touch. The dress is somewhat baggy so you must wear a belt - the one that comes with the dress is pretty crapy so I wear it with my own. Once accessorized it looks ok but for what it is, I think it's overpriced."
2.0,"Wish the description would've said something about these being a junior's size.<br /><br />Also, the solid dark grey shorts are actually a light grey. The back and grey striped shorts are white and grey striped. I don't know why they wouldn't change the picture if the product has changed since its original listing."
2.0,"Looks good in the pictures, choose a larger size, but did not fit my shape right.  I returned the product."
2.0,I did not like this “sweater” at all. The fabric was horrible and the fit was awful - it ran small for an XXL. I returned it.
2.0,"I ordered an xxl I think because I wanted them to be loose fitting but the waist is TINY, 12&#34; in fact and not extra large at all."
2.0,The strap is falling apart
2.0,"It’s okay quality wise, dropped once and see scratches on clip and some edges are getting chipped off. Since I got this wallet when holding it longer time in your hands, getting the sensation of something is getting rubbed off to your hands (scratch glass itchy type feeling), makes it uncomfortable."
2.0,To small.... I do notvlike
2.0,"I like the look of these industrial barbells, but the paint already is coming off on one of them."
2.0,"Pretty, but runs VERY small."
2.0,Good looking glasses I bought for my 11 year old daughter. She loved them and was excited to wear them. Day two screw fell out. Tried rescrewing them and the threads were wasted. Surprised it lasted two days. Product was not mishandled in any shape and I think appeared to have come defected.
2.0,"After waiting for a long time, I finally got it, but it’s really too small and it’s tight to wear."
2.0,"This rings are very poorly made, size is not correct and they don't show  the colors that were on the web site..<br />I have a ring sizer so I'm pretty sure I ordered our sizes correctly... Just sad that they won't answer my emails.<br />Lesson learned I suppose"
2.0,"There is nothing really but a dab of cheap paint that glows and can come out over time, it would be better to have a disc or thin rubber sheet of that glows, and would make the necklace better."
2.0,Bought this for my 14 year old kid and it didn't last more than a month. Won't buy this item again.
2.0,Too much fabric for moving about.  Great for warmth and lounging.
2.0,"I wanted this to be really comfy and cute. It is neither. It fits really odd-tight in arms and chest, but huge everywhere else. It's not comfy enough to sleep in, but is also not cute enough to wear out."
2.0,Not a good belt
2.0,Doesn't really look like the photo. It is a long sleeve. I'm 5'6 150 lbs and it was a bit tight.
2.0,"this wallet isn't fancy, but it works the way they show it. I have 7 cards and 8 bills in it and it is half the size of my old wallet. it takes some getting used to, and its not for everyone. it says it has RFID protection, but I don't think so, it is just 2 pieces of plastic and a fancy rubber band. Most cards don't need RFID protection, only the cards that you can wave near the reader.I have now used this for 4 months. The wallet is holding up well, but the first two credit cards are wearing out from rubbing against each other as you use them most often. I will probably look for a different style."
2.0,"Not as pictured, bad print matching along waist area, hole in pocket. Great about refunds thou!"
2.0,I do some sports and lost my more expensive mask. Got these but the fabric gets into my mouth and the straps around the ears bend my ears. I'm not rich enough to buy cheap
2.0,"I love the smooth knit fabric. The large fits a little snugly but I returned it because the straps didn't lay smooth over my shoulders as shown in the picture.  The straps go inward,  up and back creating a big wrinkle that looked ugly. The return went very smoothly.  I dropped that package off at UPS early afternoon and the credit was issued the same day."
2.0,I bought a large and it feels like a Medium. I thought there would be more cotton at the crotch area but it was a very small piece
2.0,"It fits but it snags easily.  American apparel leotard material is better. I guess since kids grow fast, it will only be a temporary leotard."
2.0,"I wanted to love this, but had multiple problems. Color was not as shown. Was too tight on chest and length was too short. I have a larger chest and I’m very tall- so maybe it would work for average height."
2.0,Noise reduction less than a 34 dcb I tried.
2.0,"I like them, but they aren't as pictured. I ordered the all black, and the top is lined with gray and the back pockets are gray as well.  Also, after only one wear the seam came apart and i had to stitch them up."
2.0,Links are too big
2.0,I ordered dark blue Carry-on Case and received light red one. In addition I ordered it for the trip and was assured that it'll be delivered before trip started. It have been delivered 2 days after I left for vacation.
2.0,I am not happy with the quality of these socks vs the ones I bought at the course.  I will not order these again.
2.0,"Very cheaply made, and not true to size...I ordered size 11, and it's actually a size 9 at best!"
2.0,I do not like these stockings.  They are too sheer and do not stay up.
2.0,"The frames are decent quality, but the lenses are so distorted that it’s hard to wear them for more than a minute or two. They’re fine for photo props but not to actually wear. I would’ve given them 3 stars but deducted a star because the seller has sent me a daily email since I got these asking me to write a review. So annoying."
2.0,"The shedding on this is amazing, this will not be washed in my washer at home. Also found this exact same pajama suit at a superstore for $20. So bummed."
2.0,"It's not like in the photo I really didn't like the style, but it's not a bad product and it has a good price"
2.0,"Nice skirt,  it runs big and thin."
2.0,"I received the two watches I ordered and on the date as advertised.  One of the watches was correct in all functions.  The other (Geekthink)  has problems and I am just awaiting a return shipping address.  The analog function works perfectly.  Neither of the digital displays work.  It is like the two digital display boxes are without a battery.  I can't get either of the display boxes to even light up.  Please provide a RA number so that I can return the watch with a leather wrist band.  It came in a box labled ""Geekthink."" The ""SKENI"" watch is the one I want to keep."
2.0,"This is a super cute top, but you can see everything through it. I put pasties on and you can see the flesh tone pasties thru it. I love the style, especially for the value, but the material is 👎"
2.0,I ordered a XXXL and the arm holes are too small/tight. I usually wear a 14/16 and had to give this top away because the arm holes are so small.
2.0,"Dress came as described, but to short. I am 5'7"" and it sits above my ankles. Overall dress is beautiful, comfortable, material does stretch."
2.0,Earrings do not look at shown or described. You get waht you pay for. Nothing more to say about it.
2.0,"It's a great shirt however it doesnt have a lot of stretch to it. Definitely size up. I'm 5'4"" and 105 lbs and a small was too small for me."
2.0,This is a very cute swim suit. But!...you get what you pay for. I have only worn it a couple of times and it has held up so far but the straps are very thin and I'm worried they will not hold up for long. The ink from the straps came off on my skin and looked ridiculous. I had to scrub with soap and water to get the ink off my skin. And the padding up top was messed up. You cannot remove the pads. It is a very cheeky swimsuit which I did not mind. But if you are looking for something that covers your behind this is not the suit for you.
2.0,Very are through and thin.
2.0,"If the waistband itself, which is at such a high rise it can be considered ""tummy control"" then I suppose these have some at or above the waist. All it's doing is cutting off my circulation and it's far too high of a rise to do anything for my tummy, which is not located in the area of my rib cage! If you are short or you have a shorter rise, don't order these, too much extra material in the rise area. Also, what little tummy control there is can be found in a waistband of .25 (1/4) of an inch, so unless your tummy spans a distance of 1/4 an inch, no matter what your rise is this isn't going to help you out and since I ordered white it also isn't going to look very good if you have any extra in that area of the body.<br /><br />The material itself is comfortable but these should NEVER have been marked tummy control! Anything I've ever bought that had that description or label spanned several inches in the garment's ""control"" area and was located in the right spot for the garment to do its job. Separately, these should be marked HIGH RISE."
2.0,"was too big, and you get what you pay for. i returned it"
2.0,"When it turns on, the lights and sound are perfect.  The one that I got when you turn it off, the PKE meter just clicks when the arms come down and don't stop.  I don't know if it's defective, but it shouldn't work like that."
2.0,Fit is entirely different to other Lands End pants.  These are baggy and ugly. A pity becuase the fabric design is nice.
2.0,Had to return it as it was not a good quality dress. Material seemed very cheap
2.0,"Returned. I typically wear a size medium which is what I ordered. It was too tight. I liked the sleeve design and color, but I would not try a different size because I didn't like the material. It reminded me of a light raincoat or windbreaker."
2.0,A bad replica
2.0,Did nothing for the shape of the breast. Size was larger than expected
2.0,Cute shoe…Runs small
2.0,If I saw them in person I would have passed.
2.0,Looked enexpensive
2.0,Pretty bad quality.  That's what I get for trying to save money.
2.0,"I purchased 1 for myself, got so many compliments and 1, 3 mos. later for my friend... look beautiful on; unfortunately mine just broke at the clasp and hers broke within 2 weeks same place. I had planned on purchasing a third for another friend and have decided against it."
2.0,ordered this for myself.. at first thought i oredered a childs apron by mistake! it fits my 9 year old niece tho.. now shopping for adiffrent apron to work in
2.0,The antlers lip on the windows but fall off EVERY time you open the windows.
2.0,"This band is really small. Is it meant for a child? It is 5.5"" long, which includes the clasps to go into the watch."
2.0,"Does not fit the Garmin Vivomove 3S, despite being auto release and 18 mm wide. It popped right out of the grommet holder on face of watch."
2.0,Not exactly as pictured; cute but large for sure
2.0,This shirt was too small I ordered a 3X but this shirt fitted tight I thought that maybe it was a large but the shirt said 3X on the tag I like the shirt but was not happy woth the size it didnt even look like a plus size shirt.
2.0,Magnet isn't strong enough. Kept having to tighten it up. I returned it.
2.0,Much smaller than expected. My daughter wore it once and it was very uncomfortable
2.0,"These are very thin and they barely get to under my knees, they fit smaller than the chart shows. They seem strong but they are not padded around the foot, so I need to wear a second pair so my shoes fit tightly."
2.0,"Mislabeled on website as &#34;Wool&#34;.  Upon arrival and inspection, Its label indicated its fiber content is &#34;70% wool, 30% silk&#34;.  This is how the website should describe it.  Otherwise, its construction and quality are fine, and I will be happy to wear it for its non-slip knot and non-shine, compared to traditional 100% silk ties."
2.0,Studs totally bent flush with cuff. I did attempt to straighten but afraid they will break.
2.0,"Cute and colorful frames, that's true.<br />One drop. one lean just so, the frames fall apart.<br />Don't waste your money on this crap."
2.0,"Too small, cut small"
2.0,Does not stay up on either of my children. They both are frustrated by it and hate wearing this specific mask.
2.0,Not that long
2.0,"Too big for my face. I have a longer thin face, and these glasses were just too big.  I love the look, but just not for me."
2.0,Clip in back unhooks at a moments notice..
2.0,"At first I LOVED the ring! My husband has a bad habit of taking rings off but he said this one is so comfortable he doesn’t take it off. He told me he forgets he even has it on. My husband is a huge Razorback fan. It was perfect for him. He wears it everyday. He is a teacher so it’s not like he is digging in dirt, chopping down trees or manual labor. The paint came off of the Razorback now it looks super tacky. Not happy that I have to replace it already."
2.0,material is thin and shirt size runs small
2.0,"When purchased, it didn't give me a size option.  The hat is too small.  Is there a slightly bigger one?"
2.0,Not sure if I like them or not. The description was off
2.0,"First of all I ordered “pink” and it’s salmon color. Secondly, the zipper is way shorter than described in photo. I like a deeper zipper on quarter zips than what I got."
2.0,"material isn't good quality, they started to come apart after one wash."
2.0,"I wore these yesterday for the first time and the back on one of them broke within the hour, also won't stay up on the ear.  They are pretty but not of much use if they break that easily."
2.0,"It was a little see through and I bought the black dress. I also bought the large and it didn't fit right, it wasn't tight. I had plenty of room it just didn't fit my body the way I wanted, so I ended up returning it."
2.0,Doesn't lay right
2.0,Runs large.ok for around the house.
2.0,Ordered black and blue goggles- received pink and blue goggles.  They did not have the snap in the back.  It was NOT what I ordered.
2.0,this looked nothing like amazon photo.. it was shorter in front and didn’t have stretch
2.0,"Purchased for my new vivoactive 3. Was easy to attach, comfortable and exactly what I was hoping for.  I've been wearing it and sleeping in it and it stays in place.  The original bands are so awkward and uncomfortable this one is much better.<br />Edit to add: After 3 months I am replacing this. One pin constantly pops off & I've almost lost the watch a few times, used extra pin- same thing. Now there it's unraveling & snags my clothes & other objects. Loved the look & comfort but so annoying!"
2.0,"Nice casual bag, nice material, nice price......I ordered two that's how convinced I was that this was an amazing bag.....<br /><br />The bottom of the bag is a floppy mess. It's like packing your stuff into a plastic grocery bag. No shape or form."
2.0,Low quality plastic
2.0,The earlobe hooks too small. Hooks look fragile - could break after many uses. Could be tight if ears are fat or on the tubby side.<br />Price point very reasonable.<br />Pearl shade/color not as expected or ordered.
2.0,CHEAP  enough said
2.0,"When I received this necklace the link holding the two collar pieces together was broken, so I improvised with some other chain I had from a different necklace. The length of the chain is too long for my taste and not easily adjustable (I'll need to literally take the chain apart to reduce the chain length on both sides with how the clasp is situated in order to make it the correct length). I think the concept is cute and design beautiful but overall execution is lacking. Ultimately I'll probably end up replacing the chain altogether."
2.0,Love these bands.. biggest fail it came a pastel rainbow and not nearly as bright as online shows. I will be returning.
2.0,large and too short for me to wear it and it did not the way it was expected i am returning the product and iw ant my money back than ks
2.0,"I bought these for my tragus and the opals were way too small. They're really pretty, but way too small."
2.0,this umbrella seemed nice when I first got it until the first wind hit it and it broke just like that.  In the garbage it went.
2.0,The carving is only on one side so they look weird won't be wearing them :(
2.0,"Sent it back,  not as cute in the bioty as it does and seriously waaay too long.  I'm 5'6"" and even with wedges I'd need to take off almost a foot"
2.0,"Thick denim, good construction, but does not hang well. It sticks out like a poodle skirt. Returned."
2.0,"I've been wearing Reef sandals exclusively for nearly 10 years. I wear them all the time, all day, every day. Most last 6 months to a year, and that's fine. These feel like they went and changed something. Every time I take a step, it feels like they're driving my heel down into the ground. They are a little thinner than most others I've owned, but that's not it. The bottle opener is nice, but I imagine contributes to the poor performance of the sole. I had to stop wearing them because they were making my knees hurt. Now I'm wearing a pair of Reef's I've had for years and they still have more padding than these."
2.0,"The description said thick socks but they are really thin, not good for the cold weather."
2.0,Crooked and bigger than I thought.
2.0,It would be nice if the Silver wash you used didn't wash off revealing cheap metal that even the elves wouldn't touch if they existed...
2.0,"I wanted to love the shirt, but I’m someone who want to throw a skirt on the steam setting in the dryer and go.  This has to be ironed.  So not a good option for travel, which is why I bought it.  The white skirt shoes everything underneath and I’d not smooth. I’m 125 pounds and 5”5, and it is too snug for a white skirt."
2.0,The shoes are beginning to peel at the toe are and after two weeks of usage one shoe is already not working
2.0,"Top fit weird, Pants were see through. Feels super cheap."
2.0,These shorts are a sheer peek-a-boo.
2.0,A 3X IS LIKE TOPS A LARGE... BUT IT IS WELL MADE.... ORDER UP... WAY UP... I GAVE IT AWAY.
2.0,Doesn't look cute in person kind of baggy
2.0,"Loved the color - pink with grey - and that is the only nice thing to say about it. It is fitted for a child, not a woman. Much too small in the bustline which pulls on the armholes. Terrible fit. It is also very thin and see through. The color and flare are great - too bad the rest of it isn't."
2.0,The first one I ordered came with a hole in it. I was able to easily exchange it for a new one. My daughter wore it for one day and it now has holes in both armpits and in the private area.  It fits great but it drips easily. Definitely would not recommend.
2.0,This jacket is very very thin and is not conducive for harsh winters and freezing temperatures.  Neck portion featured in photo has a more wide and trendy look than it does on.
2.0,"I like how light the fabric is and the amount of stretch.  The colors weren't as vibrant as I thought they would be, but still a very pretty print.  I had read one review that indicated there was too much room in the bust, which made me feel more comfortable in ordering it as I am very large chested  (let's just say I'm larger than the cups sizes available at Victoria's Secret).  However, this plunging neckline showed way too much!.  And, as I took up all of the room there was in the bust area, attempting to add a stitch to raise the neckline wouldn't work as that would also raised the empire waist to be in my bust area. (I tried just hold it with my fingers and I realized this just wasn't possible, and it looked odd).  As hopeful as I was, this will need to go back."
2.0,Good price for quantity. Quality seemed ok. Thin shirts. Much smaller than average 2t.
2.0,"They were too flimsy and didn't sit right on the face.  I bought them for extras to have for people who forgot their masks, but I wasn't impressed."
2.0,"I purchased this based on the outstanding reviews and was looking forward to utilizing it. Upon unpacking I discovered a piece of (what appears to be) a gum-like food substance to the face of the apron. I did not purchase a used server’s apron (gross) - furthermore, upon trying to clean it off, it’s left a tacky residue and stain. I’m sorry, but I cannot use this.<br /><br />This is not ok."
2.0,"These are ok but don't seem like they're nearly worth the $124 regular price. More like $15, maybe $20. I don't feel like I really got that great a deal.  AND I've had them less than 24 hours and there's already a nice big scratch/scuff on one lens that won't come out. I imagine more to come."
2.0,"The color and print of this dress are lovely, and just as pictured. However, it runs a lot larger than expected based on the reviews. I would suggest sizing down if you're expecting juniors sizing."
2.0,"Material is very clingy and thin. At the same time, the dress is probably two sizes too large, even though I ordered according to the company's measurements. My rule is, if I look better naked than I do with the dress on, then the dress is getting returned. Maybe in a much smaller size (for me) this could have been okay."
2.0,Bracelet was a gift. Daughter said it was beautiful but the clasp came undone twice and fell off.
2.0,"Low quality, rolls up my thigh and the elastic band is awfully uncomfortable. There are better for the same price."
2.0,I ordered both colors and the black one had a broken buckle. The straps are not mad very well to begin with and after a day the pink ones broke a buckle too. Very disappointed.
2.0,Shoddy construction. Had to replace the clasp on the charm
2.0,"it was a great design, great look, very spacious, and worked for the purpose i had for it. i had a lot of cards (memberships, store discounts, gift cards, etc) that were crowding my wallet so i wanted a separate thing to carry them in. It holds all my cards.<br /><br />however, it only gets two stars due to one very big flaw. The stupid latch on the wallet doesnt close. it doesn't close. it just doesn't catch or something. i had to put a rubber band around it. i still have it and like it but that's a bummer. it worked and closed the first time but then it just refused. :( disappointing"
2.0,"Style is all that is true, this is more of a neon yellow not green, and it is also small very tight in the sleeves. Shoulders are right but the sleeves, are very tight, and it's also very short, above the waist. Tried to use the return button but it keeps coming up with an error."
2.0,"The perfect tiered dress, so flattering and not too big and “tent like” it’s hangs wonderfully.<br />Unfortunately I noticed several small holes in my dress as I was taking it off the first time though."
2.0,"The plastic seems really, really cheap and lightweight. Also it fits really tight on my head, like it is sized for a very small head or possibly childs head. It kind of gives me a headache."
2.0,Was already broken
2.0,This is not your typical sweatshirt. It’s an athletic material like Wicking almost. Fabric not at all what expected. Design was cute but didn’t make up for wanting a sweatshirt feel.
2.0,Sizes wear much smaller.
2.0,"I WAS SURPRISED AT THE SMALL SIZE OF THE PENDANT.  MY DAUGHTER LIKED IT BUT I THOUGHT IT NEEDED TO BE LARGER SO THAT YOU COULD SEE THE DETAIL BETTER.  ALSO, IT FLIPS OVER ALL THE TIME, LEAVING THE HOLLOW BACK SHOWING INSTEAD OF THE FACE OF IT.  THOUGHT I OVERPAID FOR THIS ITEM AT 30$."
2.0,"Cute design, good size, but the material started tearing away from the frame within a month."
2.0,These were a bit small for the face not quite what I expected
2.0,To small but really super kut3
2.0,Way.
2.0,These were very large in the waist and I returned them. Also very long for me at 5’6.
2.0,"he quality of the product is not very good, I last very little, do not remain satisfied with the purchase"
2.0,It was too small. I gave it away.
2.0,"I got size Large.  I am 5'5, 155 lbs and my measurements are 36-30-40.  I'm usually a size 6/8 in dresses.<br /><br />I ordered 12 dresses from Homeyee and this one is probably my LEAST favorite.  The scoop seams on the front of the dress are puckered and do not lie flat.  Too large in the waist and poor execution of the fabric pattern.  Other Homeyee dresses also have complicated fabric patterns and are better-sewn.  The dress comes with a black belt, which I didnt unwrap because I knew I was sending it back.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful, sorry for the bad photo quality."
2.0,"Not only does the print not come up as high as it does in the picture but there isn't as much print on it and the colors don't match the picture. its not a goldish yellow, its more of a greenish yellow and the dark purple is more of a maroon. the fabric is a cheep feeling fabric, and the sewing is done terribly. I've considered tearing it apart and resewing it myself since i'm sure i could do a much better job. Seems like its one of those products that is made as cheaply as possible."
2.0,"Great design, but far too small for a normal adult head."
2.0,"Does not stay nice on your ankle, gets all tangled up!!!"
2.0,The cloth was of cheap material and it dint fit well..it was running large..
2.0,"While the shoes look good and breath fairly well, they started to wear-through within two months of sporadic use. Definitely cheap/poor quality material. Once the top started to rip through, I basically turned them into boating-only shoes. But, they don’t even drain very well when wet and take forever to dry. The Sperry brand is not even close to what it used to be..."
2.0,Not sure who these work for but it isn't me. I have a size 7 shoe.  they slipped off everytime I have tried to use them. Not impressed.
2.0,These are not at all &#34;medium&#34;.<br /><br />They fit over a standard person's face with glasses and nothing more; they're not very much larger.
2.0,Bought this to give to my daughter in law loved the saying on the key chain but you can’t read it it’s way to small I will be giving her a magnifying glass with it how embarrassing it should say on the description you will not be able to see it or read it with a naked eye
2.0,"Cute but way too big. It's a very heavy fabric as well. I'm 100lbs, 5'4&#34; & got XS, no luck. Returning!"
2.0,La tela es de muy mala calidad no la volvería a comprar
2.0,Too tight in the bust and arms. Sent it back
2.0,This is a stretchy belt. It’s ok for what I paid for it.
2.0,Fits well. Description is correct but doesnt stay on the watch.
2.0,"I like the product that came ok. However, in the description it says &#34;Material: 95% Rayon, 5% Spandex&#34;. Well the tag on it says Material: 65% Cotton, 35% Polyester. Very disappointed as part of the reason I chose this one is I didn't want Cotton!"
2.0,I liked the style but size was too small
2.0,"Although these earrings are a nice quality, they really are not for grown women.  I ended up giving them to the 7 year old next door neighbor because they are better suited for a child."
2.0,You get that you pay for. Fabric is costume like. I'm going to use them as pajama bottoms rather than go through returning.
2.0,This is not anywhere near something that is for plus size women.  So disappointed 🙁
2.0,I did not like this at all. I canceled one order when I ordered two by mistake.  I was sent two any way. I was not happy. Returned them both.
2.0,"Material is EXTREMELY thin and see-through. The band underneath the bust is elasticized at both the top and bottom, which creates an odd silhouette if you've got a bit of fat like I do."
2.0,"The fit is all off on this cosplay!  The measurements are all wonky!  Jacket is HUGE & pants fit, top is short!  Also lots of things broke off in shipment.  So disappointing.  I don’t know how to reach seller either.  Amazon does not provide the option"
2.0,Too big. Picture is deceiving
2.0,Super small even sizing up
2.0,"It looked awesome, and I bought it for my girlfriend, but the chain broke almost immediately after she put it on. Disappointed."
2.0,This bralette needed 5 or more inches added onto the bust. It didn't even cover nipples!!!
2.0,"Nice neckline but sideseams are not straight, they bulge out almost allowing for a muffintop that I do not have. Now it makes me look like I HAVE muffintop. I got a medium based on reviews but could have worn a small. I am 5'8&#34; and 135 lbs. 36D."
2.0,"Do not like it at all. They fit small, the material is wayyy too stretchy and shiny. The waist part is the same material as the pants. It should be different and more cloth like. Concept is cute hut it doesn't pull it off. What i received was different than whats in the pic. I will be feturning this."
2.0,"I bought these to replace a very old pair that had developed a hole. The fingers are a bit long for me, but that is typical of all gloves I've ever tried on. The width is correct, the leather is nice, the insulation looks like it'll be perfect. I wanted a pair of general gloves to drive with and other sort of general outdoor use, but not sports. I didn't want a glove as thick as a ski glove, and I didn't want it to be too tight around my hand, because a bit of air space helps keep the heat in. These will be perfect for that. I don't love the thinsulate tag sticking out, so I've cut it off, I suppose that's part of the licensing agreement. Note that this is not work glove material, it is thinner than tough work glove leather. These are light-duty gloves and that's what I needed.<br /><br />Update 2/2: The left hand glove has split along the seam between the thumb and the index knuckle. Very disappointed. Did not think the leather would fly apart after two wearings."
2.0,"Broke almost immediately, but worked for a 1 day Halloween costume. Uncomfortable on your nose and ears, and ultimately went in the garbage at the end of the day, but more or less served our purpose as a costume accessory."
2.0,"Saw it ran small so I bought a 2x rather than xl, it’s actually fits a medium. However the shirt is otherwise fabulous, great quality and style. The sizing is a nightmare."
2.0,Like Children's toys
2.0,Nice bra but didn’t fit was too small
2.0,The tie at the neck hurt and the gap at the chest was much larger than it appeared. It wasn't for me so I returned it. Loved the color though!
2.0,Cheaply made and a weak signal as well .  Really not that great of a product in my honest opinion.
2.0,It shows a large oversized sweater but it's way to small and the material is cheap feeling and looking<br />Returning
2.0,"They fit well on my hands with shortish fingers. The wrist is way too open, it could use a button or something there. The stitching leaves a lot to be desired, there are a few places where it just looks poorly done and doesn't match up right, and I suspect it would be on a large percent of these gloves because the bad stitching and patterns are in the same spots on both gloves. The leather also feels very cheap. Not really happy with them, but hey, for $20 you get what you pay for.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />After a month of somewhat regular use, the leather is already starting to look really worn on the fingers and thumb. Not like good worn, but like crappy leather worn. Another month and they will be too badly looking to wear to work."
2.0,"This turkey necklace is very cute and perfect for Thanksgiving or turkey-lovers like my mom, who had a pet turkey.  Unfortunately, the clasp was broken and would not open so I could not even try it on.  It feels like it has a nice weight to it and is well made except for the clasp on the chain.  It was a little smaller than I expected, even given the size in the description, so I added a picture of it on a shirt for size comparison (don't mind the wrinkles!).  Would have recommended it if not for the broken clasp."
2.0,Took an extra day to get to me. Otherwise a good cheap glove. Amazon shipping caused this to be a 2 star rating. I have prime shipping at that.
2.0,Good material and I like that the inside is a lighter/contrasting color. However it’s just too darn heavy even when I don’t put much in it. Plus…if you buy it and need to return know the date. I was 1 day over the short window to return. I emailed and got zero response. Great service guys!! Update: 9 March…a main zipper just broke.
2.0,much smaller than expected.  Made purchase and was surprised that a XL was so small tried to find someone to give it to but even my mother who is a small petite couldn't wear it.  By the time it was passed around to find someone to give it to the narrow 30 day return window was closed :( very disappointed in product.
2.0,"The lenses are great in the glasses, but the frames are gas station cheap. Mine cracked early on when I bought them from nothing but putting them on and taking them off. Fast forward several months and they are now in 2 separate pieces despite careful handling. The frame just can’t hold up to daily use, and for the price they should be able to.<br /><br />I’ve owned the same pair of eye glasses for 6-7 years now, it’s not an issue of me being hard on glasses, they are just very poorly made frames.<br />If their lifespan of daily use is less than a year, they should reflect that in the price."
2.0,I was expecting the quality to be a lot better but it reminds me of costume jewelry. It looks very fake
2.0,Much smaller than expected based on the description but the magnetic closure works well and it is pretty.
2.0,This mask did not fit my face. The mask would go under chin but not able to cover nose. The wire is not comfortable. Be careful when buying a mask. Just because it says it will fit isn't guaranteed. I gave the mask to my mom. She liked the mask and it fit her face. So in conclusion again beware of the fit. Not all mask are made the same apparently. (One size does not always fit all.
2.0,"Too tight in all the wrong places, too long for short girl (5ft), neck line is just straight & ugly."
2.0,Material is not what I expected.  Bottoms are too large.  Very disappointed but running out of time about to travel and can't wait again.for my items<br /> Very dissatisfied for the price.  Should have been maybe 12.00 at most.  May return and just do without for this trip.
2.0,It was to thick and had a bad odor.
2.0,"Every other XL t-shirt, sweatshirt, or jacket I have fits fine.  I bought this XL jacket and it was way too small."
2.0,"Super cheap material. Very-very thin. Definitely NOT a cotton T-shirt. Cute image which my son will still love, but disappointed on how cheap the material is. Hopefully, it will survive the wash."
2.0,Order 1 size larger. They run small. :/
2.0,"Tbh it was cute when it arrived. It was a decent fit but after one wash and mind you I’ve been doing laundry for 15 years I washed it alone in COLD water and the red bled all throughout so all the white details are pink and it looks absolutely ridiculous. I ended up donating it, hopefully someone who doesn’t give a damn about how they look can wear it to bed or somthing."
2.0,"I buy these at least 3 times a year, I love them, but it is hard to keep them in one piece"
2.0,Cute watch. Like that the watch band fits me better than most.  But..... doesn't keep time.<br />Out of box didn't run at first. Then it would start and stop.  Ended up about an hour slow.<br />So useless as a watch.
2.0,Too thin too loose
2.0,"—Feel free to ask me any questions about my review!—<br /><br />I know there are several shirts on this product listing, but this review is for the one with the arms that are tighter. It is not at all like the picture! The arms are supposed to be full length and the shirt I received they were more like three-quarter length. Also, I wanted the neckline to be lower. This one hits at a strange spot on my chest and is really high. The square is not super defined so it ends up looking like a janky scoopneck, not a square neck. The arms are not very tight either. I understand you can’t make them too tight because you need to get your hands through. They are Bunchie and strange and they could’ve used a stretchy or mesh fabric. It’s really obvious because they bunch and strange locations and obviously you can see the lines with a bunch and it’s not part of the pattern. Overall, it looks so cheap and I am so sad!<br /><br />While it is janky, This product runs true to size. I ordered a small, which is my usual size, and it fits perfectly! I am 5’6”, 140 lbs, and a size 4 for reference.<br /><br />I hope my description was of use to you!<br /><br />—Follow @CassandraMercedes on Instagram for more amazing Amazon finds!—"
2.0,the bars were too big for my ear holes. too bad
2.0,Washed this for the first time and the length shrunk up about 3 inches! Now it is WAY too short for me and I can't wear it. Super annoyed with this garbage dress as I bought it specifically because it appeared to be a good length.
2.0,"I was really hopeful with this trainer . It was thick, comfy and gave good stretch. However the piping in the back that gives support gas already broken through the fabric and I haven't even had it 2 weeks.  I didn't even contact the seller because I didn't want to deal with the hassle."
2.0,"I loved the product just way too small, I ordered XXL and normally that is a bit loose fit for me but not this time.  Had to return it."
2.0,The lining is so incredibly short that my behind hangs out. Not wearable at all. The cold shoulder sleeves aren’t as flowy as the picture. Taking back.
2.0,"Cute, seemingly sturdy. However, mine snapped in half within a month or so. I was pretty sad. Not so sturdy after all."
2.0,"Edges of sleeves are not properly hemmed, they're just rough cut. Edges are fraying after one wash. The sleeves weren't cut evenly either. Material is thin. Pretty design, but poorly executed. Will probably just wear this around the house or to sleep in, provided it lasts past more washings."
2.0,Didn't fit well on my granddaughter.
2.0,"One of the shell pearls was completely entangled in strings of the necklace. And the button that keeps it closed was way too small so it immediately fell out of the opening.  Also, the longer few strands of the necklace were WAY too long so it looks funky. Very disappointed."
2.0,"*UPDATE* I changed my review to 2 stars because if you use pads with wings the sticky stuff sticks to these underwear with no hope of it ever coming off!<br /><br />I love the light weight and feel. I even like the larger leg holes, but after 1st wash on delicate elastic busted in the leg hole stitching making the leg holes even larger! Not totally happy but not totally mad either. Also I'm not a fan of the light colors. What upset me most is I buy from JMS all the time and have for years! These were cheaper than on their site and now I know why."
2.0,Junk. Broke after a few days
2.0,"The hats are nice, I have to start by saying that.<br /><br />The draw-string clamp for the chin strap is garbage.  One of them was already broken when I got the package.  It didn't break in the package, or in shipping.  A piece of it was missing when it left the factory!<br /><br />I complained to the company, and they reimbursed me $4.50 for the 50% QC Failure rate.  Not acceptable.  We'll see if this review gets them to do the right thing.<br /><br />Oh--and the hats you're supposed to wear out in the wild (I got mine for kayaking) are marked as ""Dry Clean Only""<br /><br />Really?  I hand washed the good one, and so far it's doing fine."
2.0,"Very pretty top however very simple..in person the top is ordinary, there is no label to identify which is the front or back..stitching is all the same..seems to be more of fabric sewn together and no real design or fit in mind.."
2.0,Always read the reviews 1st. Super cheap (get what u pay for) super disappointed that it looks like a 4 year old sewed it together. Havent tried it on yet due to the fact that im afraid its going to fall apart as soon as i put one arm or leg in. Wont be buying from this company again. Sad quality is the Best i can say for it.
2.0,"Chain broke 2 hours after I put it on, not quality I would expect. Love the charm and its bigger than I thought it would be close to 3/4 inch. I have other silver chains and can easily buy another chain. I got this on sale for $50.00 and would not pay more than that. Decided to return, after wearing with another chain the charm continued to get caught on its self"
2.0,"This jacket, while cheap, is not water proof.  If you are in rain for any extended period water will leak through the jacket and you will get soaked.  Again it's a cheap jacket, but it is not water proof, if that is important, move on and buy another jacket."
2.0,"Like how it looks, just not how it fits. It's for a really big head."
2.0,I bought this bag in July to use daily as a work bag. The straps are already falling apart. I paid way too much to have it not last 6 months.  Very disappointed.
2.0,It's too small for being a 2x.
2.0,Cute dress but the white part was completely see through
2.0,i didn't like the color combo: blue and white stripes with a black shirt.
2.0,"The fit wasn’t bad but the fabric was completely see-through, so it’s going back. It felt like polyester mesh."
2.0,It is extremely small. Not at all worth 20$. It’s just plastic that doesn’t do anything at all and it’s so amall.
2.0,These are very pretty but they are difficult to put on. The angle of the earring that goes in the ear has a part that juts out and it hurts to place in my ear. I am returning them.
2.0,Didn’t look anything like the picture
2.0,Tore at seam in vacation.
2.0,"The belt buckles are advertised to be silvery/shiney. They are just flat, black plastic, and lack the luster you would hope to get from a belt that costs almost $30"
2.0,Runs small in the chest area
2.0,I dislike the way they fit my vest. They do not stay snapped. They come apart very too easily.
2.0,"The advertising on this item is completely bogus.  The gloves are not waterproof - not even close - andee they are not particularly warm.  These gloves will probably be alright while driving or taking out the garbage, but they are completely inadequate for any outdoor chores, hiking or extended exposure,  Amazon (or somebody) needs to verify or discount this false advertising.  I consulted a couple ""Best cold weather gloves ..."" and these popped up.  Why do I get the feeling that these sites never actually tried using the gloves in real world conditions?  While taking out the garbage, I would toss these in."
2.0,"Lo adicional a la correa no corresponde a lo q se ve en las imágenes , no quede satisfecha con el producto 😑"
2.0,"GOOD VALUE, LIGHTER WEIGHT THAN AVERAGE  ""T"" SHIRT."
2.0,Looked cheap. Returned earrings.
2.0,There is no cushion. It feels like you’re barefoot. Also it is little longer than I need. I have 9.5 shoe size but there is no  size available between 9 and 10.  I wanted to return but  kept to not incur shipping cost.
2.0,"Absolutely gorgeous necklace, but unfortunately it fell apart after having it on for an hour at dinner. The clasp literally broke in half, and in two other places the metal broke. If it didn’t fall apart I would have left a five star rating because it’s so pretty."
2.0,Cheap shirt that doesn’t keep its shape - I wouldn’t buy it again.
2.0,The top and bottoms don’t match very well.  Also the pants are small to fit over diapers.
2.0,"I do like the way they fit, they are soft and comfy.  Only 2 stars because they've already started to fray around the elastic after only a month!!"
2.0,This is a very pretty dress but way too small. I wear a size 16 and ordered a 2X. It's more like a size 12. I'm so sad!
2.0,The sandals are prettier in the picture. The quality is not all that great. Would not purchase again.  On the second wear the material at the front of the sandals started to flake.
2.0,the picture is not accurate. The jeans are more like girl jeans they have small pockets and are a lighter color than the picture shows. I also notice I bought two pairs and each one was a different length even though they are the same size. I'm returning these.
2.0,"Definitely a different material than expected and fits a full size smaller also bunches up in weird places, very tight on the chest"
2.0,Really bummed about this. no support I guess crazy yoga will just have to be amazing with their leggins and a miss with their bras
2.0,"Spend a few dollars more and get a more legit pair. They are cute looking but filtered barely any blue light. At first I thought they did nothing at all but there is a slight filter on it, very little though. They also send you a card offering to pay you $10 for a review which I think is a little shady and makes me question the reviews especially when the product itself is less than $10"
2.0,"Bought these on a Lightning Deal and was really excited but they just don't stretch very much at all.  I couldn't get them all the way up and they made my behind look weird.  Too bad cause I love the color and the high waist, but I can't imagine working out in them -- they're too uncomfortable.  Returned.  I would look elsewhere for leggings, there are some great ones here on Amazon!"
2.0,I followed the sizing chart asked questions read everything I could on it.  Got what I thought would fit best. Ordered a medium since I wear a US10.  It fit like an XS or a S..  can’t get ahold of anyone!  Buyer beware
2.0,The material was shiny
2.0,"I love this pin, it's so cute. However, it broke two days after I pinned it onto a backpack."
2.0,"I like the design of this watch band so cute, but the color is off. It is advertised as blue but it is more of a grey."
2.0,"So I’m about to return these because I can’t even get them on. I sized up like the description said to and while the legs fit just fine, I can’t get the waistband past my hips. The stitching is too tight and so it only stretches so far.... the design is cute but these are not super quality leggings. The material is fairly thin and very slick/shiny. I couldn’t squat test them because they couldn’t even get over my bum, but you can press your hand through and see so I would careful what you wear under them. All in all amazon has much better leggings at this price point, I would look elsewhere."
2.0,Very much liked the style for 2 days.  It fell off somewhere .  i read the reviews. Thought mine would last
2.0,I did not receive 3pcs. Only received one
2.0,This item came apart really easy
2.0,"Difficult to release,  buckle does not have smooth action"
2.0,"Cheap texture, poor fit."
2.0,Broke before I got out the door and fits very loosly so it is not as appealing on as in the picture.
2.0,pretty but cheap material
2.0,These are ok..they bend very easily and tarnished after a few wearings..
2.0,It is a cheap and very thin chain
2.0,The actual outfit is cute if the material didn’t make it look like a stage dance costume. I’ll be returning
2.0,Very small and hard to put on. Wore less than 24 hrs because it irradiated my piercing
2.0,"This product runs very small (I ordered 3XL based on the reviews, but it fits like a L) and is much shorter than it appears in the picture. I was hoping for what was pictured. The fabric is nice."
2.0,"Description of &#34;soft&#34; cotton apparently means &#34;thin&#34; cotton as the fabric is very light weight. Too large and long, but will serve as a sleep shirt."
2.0,Looks like pajamas because of material.  Not a dress I would wear outside.
2.0,It is large and very cheap looking. :(
2.0,Made poorly. It doesn’t hang straight. Looks more like marble instead of the actual natural mineral.
2.0,Terrible they broke in 2 days
2.0,"Also, the fabric is very shiny, which looks cheap"
2.0,Doesn't close all the way with my sunglasses and did not come with a microfiber cloth as specified in the description.
2.0,The tied on soft face shield is not staying on the right place all the time.  The soft face shield has some creases that make the seen objects deform.  The hat is fine.  I am considering to buy another face shield but it will be hard face shield one.
2.0,"Straps are not in the right place runs small, returning"
2.0,It was delivered without the cuff links. Felt cheated. Have not even bothered to use it. Quality seems ok though. Did not come in any case. Tie and Square were just thrown into a package containing the shoes I also ordered.
2.0,Fraying and falling apart after one wash.
2.0,Ok they were a little to big and don't like the back of it ? Just wasn't what I was expecting. I tried it both ways. And it's hard to put on
2.0,"The frames are plastic, not metal. The temples are plastic too with a thin strip of carbon fiber. It's too small to effect durability. They feel cheap. The lenses are cheap plastic.  The best part about them is the packaging. It would have been nice for some of that money to go into the actual shades."
2.0,"Beautiful shawl but had something yellow across it stained but speedy delivery, love the scriptures on the corners. I sent in pucs of the stains never received a replacement."
2.0,"Pretty colors, but described as a women's tunic. This is clearly a large man's shirt. I am returning this shirt."
2.0,"The adapters aren't fitted to watch so constantly have things trapped between band and watch,  like arm hair.... OW"
2.0,Cute dress but strap tore fabric in front during first wear of just a few hours.
2.0,Not compression. At. All. This feels likes swim suit material without any lining. I’m bummed I missed the “return window” and am now stuck with them. P
2.0,The color wasn’t as vibrant as I was hoping for.  This was a part of my husband’s Father’s Day gift and I’m disappointed.  It feels cheaply made.
2.0,"I purchased a few of these from a different seller and wanted this brown color, which the other seller didn’t have. Seeing that it’s the same shirt I figured I’d be safe ordering the same size. I was wrong. While this shirt is a heavier weight fabric than the other seller offers, which I like, it’s cut MUCH smaller. I ordered the 2x and I look like a sausage casing lol! Not only is it definitely not a 2x by US standards, it’s also cut shorter on the bottom. The front does hang into a V but the sides are so short you can see the waistband on my jeans, and that’s when my arms are by my side. If I raise my arms you can see the sides of my bra. Not attractive and definitely being returned."
2.0,"This dress is very cheaply made. It feels like a Halloween costume. The material is unbreathable and would be inappropriate for important events where one might become flushed and sweaty from nervousness, like a presentation or performance. If planning to purchase, leave yourself time to wash it before wearing as it smells disgusting from the chemicals used in its production. You could find dresses of better quality for half the price elsewhere. It also fit larger than expected. I am usually a small or medium (5’3 and 135 lbs) in women’s clothing and could have gone with an extra-small instead of a small. I would advice actually looking at the measurement chart.<br /><br />Despite these issues, the dress does look nice (if you’re not touching it) and it’s cheapness would make it attractive for use as a costume dress or for going out in a more casual setting. I was looking for something durable and practical to expand my professional wardrobe and this was not it."
2.0,Cheap metal ring with stickers attached. Reminds me of something you'd win at the fair.
2.0,odd fit
2.0,Runs VERY. small
2.0,"The material is sooooo thin! I was not expecting that. Also wrinkles very easily! I hope I can manage with it. I took it out of the country, so refund is too hard. Also I thought the top would be a thick elastic, but its like 1 cm. This tiny little elastic band. I don't get it."
2.0,Once you get this on it does not come off!!
2.0,Stretching material which I like but not for a tank top but it was just seems really tacky like it was worth $5 no tags of description of material just the letter M for medium. I liked it but not for the price
2.0,"Super thin material, good for a couple wears then holes developed. Not too pleased with them."
2.0,"Unique, too short in front, sleeves extra long (too long) but bust area and shoulders too small."
2.0,This product is probably 3 times smaller then its supposed to be. I forgot I even ordered them it to so long to ship. The plus is they are pretty so if you're a size 0 they will look great on you.
2.0,Love the color nice fit but starts turning black I washed a few times the black wont come off
2.0,Tassels were all misshapen upon arrival.
2.0,Good looking product but the prompt is wider then regular US earings. The prompt must be made smaller so when it enters the ear lobe does not hurt.
2.0,This did not look anything like the blouse that was pictured.
2.0,"Very nice slippers. But WAY TOO SMALL for me, and poorly shaped. There is almost no left or right to the shape, as in just straight. As for the price, they should have fit perfectly. Gave them to my wife, who wears a size 9 woman's shoe, but still trying to get them to take shape. If I would have known, I wouldn't have bought them."
2.0,Ended up returning this due to the very crinkly interior lining. Functionality and pockets were good but I couldn't stand the noise from the liner.
2.0,This product arrived with one shoe that was mis-shaped and looked totally different from the other shoe. Wearable but it’s a little uncomfortable for my child.
2.0,I was trying to get a mask like ones I bought at a certain box store. These are stiff and not very stretchy so they don’t stay in the ears as well. Still 1000x better than those horrible paper masks….
2.0,"I really loved this style, very thin fabric and is cool.  The neck is a tad too low. When i wore it the first time and laundered it as recommended the shirt has many pills and picks.  Color was great, felt great too but  it was not fit to be worn in public."
2.0,"I bought these for my elderly mother. I specifically looked for LIGHT compression. She is 120 pounds, and 5 ft 3, so a fairly small person. She was not able to get the stocking past her heel. They were too tight. Perhaps a younger or stronger person would be able to get them on. The return to Amazon was easy though."
2.0,"Unless you are boiling water, Don't get to close to a open flame with this apron. Not sure what space age fabric this is made of. More of a plastic than a polyester. Be careful..."
2.0,"Cheap material, very disappointed!"
2.0,Very short wasted .. runs small
2.0,"I bought this hat which is more expensive than other similar hats because, based on the picture, it seemed to be higher quality. It is not."
2.0,very weird.  these are silly.  i did not like them at all.  NO crotch support in spite of the look of them
2.0,do not hold up to everyday ware
2.0,Too big and didn't hold up well.  Splitting sole at toe after one month.
2.0,Kinda smaller than I thought... But all in all you get what you paid for!
2.0,The lace is beautiful on this bra but that's the only good thing about it. It's very itchy and looks like a granny bra with how it gathers in the middle. There is no padding so your chest will sag while wearing this.
2.0,"Cheap, junky chain."
2.0,Zippers are cheap and come off track very easily. One bag broke after using it once.
2.0,"Cute hat but does NOT pack well. I have travelled with my other Wallaroo hat several times without it losing shape, and this one is not the same. It is creased and misshapen and I cannot get the form back. I have only put it in a tote bag for the beach or packed it away carefully into a suitcase and now it’s unusable."
2.0,Cute dress. I have 38 d and a small frame so I would have under boobs... I would call the material &#34;cheap&#34; it's unique for sure and really soft _ got a large for reference
2.0,I thought the necklace charm would have more weight to it.  Turned out to be  a bit light and flimsy.
2.0,"I absolutely loved this necklace, but within a couple weeks it started to tarnish and smell like cheap/old metal, despite being quite careful to keep it away from any kind of moisture.  If you can get used to the smell (or want to wear it only a limited # of times), it's still probably a decent purchase.  I received compliments on it when it was still nice."
2.0,they’re nice but i didn’t get all of the charms. i received 8 Capricorn charms and NO Taurus charms. v disappointed. i planned on using them for my etsy shop but now i have to order another set just to get 4 Taurus charms :/
2.0,"I loved this when I tried it on...I made the mistake of washing. After washing all hems became super frayed and it shrunk, its more like a long shirt now (have to wear shorts/leggings under). It was really cute but it fell apart after one wash!"
2.0,"We thought they were grey when we ordered them, but were beige when arrived"
2.0,Very specially for wear during the summer
2.0,"The top of the dress is really cute, and it's comfortable and everything,  but for me the dress was much shorter than pictured  which in my opinion made it not very flattering.  I am almost 5'10&quot;.  The sides came up to almost my mid thigh and the long part in the middle barely went to my knees."
2.0,"Very cheap. I have not started to use them because my last pair hasn't worn out all the way, (they are Op brand and have lasted for almost 5 years) I just got them before my prime ran out. I have no idea how long they will last. They feel more like dense foam rather than rubber."
2.0,"There was only one cute fabric for little ones in the package of five.  I would not buy these again, fabrics were dark and dreary."
2.0,"Top is a lot thicker and not sheer as seen in picture  and neckline is a lot smaller, not as wide as shown, therefore it will not hang over your shoulder. Disappointed,  sending it back."
2.0,"The material inside is very rough.  After wearing it on a flight and leaning on my elbow, I had a raw rash.  Also, the material has little stretch, and the cut is weirdly long.  In general this is a mediocre hoodie that might be acceptable in a pinch, but the elbow irritation is really unacceptable."
2.0,"The product seems to be well constructed, but the background color is purple.<br />I did not notice this in the pictures, until after the product arrived.  I was going to return them, but after looking at the pictures again - I will say they sent me what I ordered - PURPLE CAMO!!!<br /><br />If you want to be my twinner in purple camo, this is the product for you."
2.0,"LOVE STONES BUT, THE VINTAGE BROWN CHANGE IS UGLY=MAKES IT LOOK CHEAP-WANT TO SEND BACK."
2.0,"Not crazy about the low placement of the seam for the skirt, accentuates any tummy bulge."
2.0,I had to return it. Sizing ran small. I ended up having to get 5xl. About 3-4 sizes larger then usual. And you would think that if you have to get 5xl it would be proportionate. But the bust area was super small in comparison to the bottom. I took a chance in buying this and it unfortunately didn't work out. Not saying I wouldn't do it again because next time it could work out. 😁
2.0,"A pretty dress, however, the bust is MUCH too small for the rest of the measurements. I wear a size 10/12 and am a DD cup- to be safe I ordered the size XL. The waist, arms, and length fit well, but the chest was SO tight that I was smooshed flat.  I think this dress would be lovely on a girl who isn't as well endowed on top, but it was a failure for me.  Dress construction was good though, and material was nice and comfortable, so I was sorry it didn't fit well."
2.0,"I thought these might help for reading in bed or watching TV. They are VERY heavy. Too uncomfortable, especially when i have to where regular glasses as well. Would not recommend."
2.0,"Love the design and that the band doesn't stain easily. I ordered a 38 mm and received a 42 mm, I didn't want to return it since I wanted to use it , you can tell the band does not fit the watch (oh well , its cute though, still works as it should.)"
2.0,"The length is far too short for someone over 5ft. I ordered a medium and it sets about three or four inches above my ankles, I'm only 5'4'' so I was rather disappointed for what it could have been."
2.0,Needs to be modified to close on its own to prevent bugs and rodents from entering the house
2.0,Firstly. I ordered a medium in blue. What I received was a large navy blue.<br /><br />The straps are made of like elastic string. They are not adjustable. The chest cups are a nice touch if it fit it would be a decent dress. The material is thick and has some weight. It feels like it would be nice. And it should be decent for the price. The slit is goes up just a hands width below the underwear line so it’s at a good place without it being too revealing. The draping also looks nice. Would be decent if the order wasn’t wrong.
2.0,"It appears to be designed for other, similar Casio watches but does not really fit the SGW-300H.  I could make it fit only by hacking off some corners with a sharp knife."
2.0,"Ordered XL ,TOO SMALL, MIGHT FIT THE LITTLE CHINA MAN WHO MADE IT"
2.0,"I would love the dress but the waistband was a different print on the waistband. I had the zebra print so it made it look a little weird. Hoping the solid print looks different.<br /><br />For reference I am 5'3, ~150 lbs, 32G and a medium fit perfectly"
2.0,This material was stiff and it arrived very wrinkly - and the fabric is almost impossible to get deep wrinkles out of....
2.0,scarf is stiff and not soft. the pocket is rather small and the width of the scarf is on the narrow side. not what I was hoping for
2.0,"Weird shape, the height of the cap made me look weird in my vacation pics."
2.0,"I bought this pen to be able to use it in winter cold days but if the termpurture is less than 45 or 50 they are cold, the cushioning is good and this pants look durable."
2.0,I mean its supposed to be nice. BUT good luck with open up the package and get the whole thing Untangled!!! Very annoying
2.0,Pretty style but it runs very small.
2.0,"I loved the coat, but it is too small and now it is out of stock for a bigger size as well as the price increasing, due to the size."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:3c8c23e811f1cbf5997895adf1cbbada]] I bought this ring as a memorial ring for my father. I first loved it so much, I bought one for my husband. It is supposed to be made of silver, meaning it shouldn't turn my finger green, but it has. You can see where the ""silver"" has rubbed off... I sent in for a replacement and will update after a while to see if the replacement also turns. (Or if my husband's turns as well)<br /><br />**update, I got a replacement for the ring due to discoloration. The new ring got here in just 2 days, but was the wrong size. It is truly beautiful but I’m at a loss at what to do…<br /><br />**Update 2, I ordered a 2nd replacement because the wrong size was sent and again, they sent the wrong size. I have a ring measure stick. I order size 7 but keep getting size 6."
2.0,Fit was large and unflattering on me. Fabric seemed cheaply made. Looks great in the photos though!
2.0,"I loved this glasses when they came in, but it didn’t last."
2.0,Very cheap and cheesy does not look like picture far from it
2.0,"Very cute cover up but, I was only able to wear it once. The fringed bottom part came totally undone,  and was dragging everywhere on the beach. I was so annoyed with it, I threw it away after the first wear."
2.0,I got only item though I saw 2 in a pack
2.0,"Looks cute in picture but bulky looking on your nose, will be returning"
2.0,I expected the logo to be sewn on either as a patch or embroidered. Disappointed to find it stenciled on. But the vendor refunded the purchase and shipping to me. That was a plus.
2.0,Neck is very snug. I don’t like anything tight on my neck so I returned it.
2.0,"Well, damn. I bought this in 36B because they didn't have it in 36A, and because of so many reviews saying the bra runs small, but nope, the cups are way too big on my little boobies. Bummer. Such a pretty set."
2.0,"Looks cheap, poorly made."
2.0,"Not what I had hoped.  When I look down, the mask pokes you in the eye.  Have had others try it, same issue."
2.0,Ordered the XS and Small just in case. The small was huge! The XS fit better but still too large. This dress does not fit right. Very awkward fit. Did not like it at all. Sent them back. Would probably be great for expecting mother’s. I’m 32/26/34
2.0,Band to big BIg to fit watch size in mm not inches very. Difficult won’t fit
2.0,"Poor quality on the seams and the fabric is heavy, which makes it look over-stretched."
2.0,Size is great. Cheap looking.
2.0,The quality wasn’t what I was hoping for and it was a bit tight.
2.0,"It was great while it lasted but when the strap breaks right out of the purse itself, it becomes useless.  Won’t buy this again"
2.0,Got this last minute for a beach trip and I didn’t even end up wearing it. I wanted a tankini but couldn’t find one in stores in time so I ordered this one to try but the bottoms don’t have as much rear coverage as I would like. I just didn’t feel comfortable with that much of my butt hanging out especially around my young girls. The top wasn't too bad but definitely runs a little small in my opinion.
2.0,Son loved them but stop working after aweek smh very disappointed.
2.0,could be a little more comforable
2.0,"I was disappointed this was one piece and not two separate pieces. The fabric was scratchy, reguardless of having a shirt underneath."
2.0,"Ordered one of each necklace.  Got only one.  And it was late af.  Contacted them, they told me they couldn't fix the issues. The necklace I DID receive is cute though."
2.0,Bigger that what I thought. I little heavy on the ears.
2.0,Not very expensive but the description was for junior not 2-5 year olds. How disapointing. Teach kids over 5. I now have 24 Aprons I can do nothing with. I've taken a picture and compared them to a pringles can. Think about that. The other picture is of an 8 yr.old wearing it and he was not impressed. Super disappointing
2.0,"I wish this worked; it looks good, when the hood is down. The Small Gihuo maxi down coat is too tight across the chest - with a T shirt underneath. I'm 5'2"", 110lbs, 34C. Obviously, a medium would be too long. The hood is too high and would definitely blow down. The zipper goes all the way down so it's hard to walk with coat closed. It's great that there's snaps, because if the zipper breaks, you've got them. The plastic zipper may not be durable. The sleeves have knit cuffs, which is great, if all the other issues are okay with you."
2.0,Gravity Defyer shoes are wonderful when they fit. Unfortunately in the last few years they've been running short in length. These were too short on both feet.
2.0,Normally wear 81/2 shoes so went for the 9. Too small. Unable to wear even after attempting to stretch them. Like the style. Wish all shoe makers could conform to generalized sizing
2.0,"Shirt is cropped and boxy, surprisingly not see through. However, there were no tags and the label had been cut out. I was not paying for a new shirt when I received an obviously used shirt, so it was sent back."
2.0,The chain already change it's colour .it's  rusty now in weeks my my not please at all.
2.0,"I wanted to like these, but they barely lasted one full month. My son hardly wears these around the house and has other house shoes. So for them to be ripping so soon is horrible. I haven’t washed them yet and sure they’ll fall apart once washed if they’re ripping already barely 30 days having them. Too bad the return date has passed or else I’d gladly return them."
2.0,"I am returning this bag.  The construction is fine, but it is very gaudy.  The colors are much brighter than pictured.  It is also very heavy and small.  I am disappointed, it looked perfect for my dress."
2.0,"Can't get a good fit on this, I ordered 4 times my size and it still fits funny and tight in the shoulders"
2.0,Not sure but these are huge on me I am having to take in about an inch. Love the designs and bright colors
2.0,Smelled of wet and moldy leather.
2.0,Not sure if this is made for a child but I ordered the large and couldn’t even fit it over my head. I normally wear a 34D but ended up giving this to my friend who is an extra small.
2.0,This replacement handle has a highly polished finish and does not match my original handles which look more like the photo.
2.0,Hardware lets this down
2.0,"One of the pockets is not sewn together, so it's just a big hole when you put your hand in the pocket.  I wish they would just send a replacement, but no-I have to pack them up, print a label, drive to a UPS store, and return them for a refund.  All that extra work when they sent me a defective product. Hm."
2.0,"I ordered quite a few of these cheap Amazon sunglasses to find a solid replacement for my oakleys and Ray-Bans. These were some of the best looking sunglasses sold on Amazon. Unfortunately, none of that matters when the lens does not sit well inside the frame and makes a rattling noise as the glasses shift around. Hopefully this is a problem seller can fix and future versions."
2.0,Good quality not true to size they fall out because they are too small and one is slightly bigger than the other...
2.0,I ordered this in black for my twins in size 2-4.  They are wearing 2T and these are way way way too small.  I compared the sizing to their other leotards and what I ordered was more like their 12-18m leotards.  These will be going back although they seemed like they were made from a good quality material.
2.0,These are super cute leggings but they fall off my little girl. The material slips off her and I'm not sure if it's because she's wearing a diaper or not but they just don't work for her.
2.0,"This is a gorgeous dress! I am 5'3&#34; and size 16. Unfortunately, the XXL is way too small. I will be returning it."
2.0,I'm typically a size L and the size L fit me just fine and they are comfy. So why 2 starts only? They are completely see through! HATE HATE HATE that in leggings. Return item
2.0,Around the waist they were bulky. Ridiculously unflattering.  I only gave 2 stars because I had no trouble returning. They are just not my style
2.0,I bought these a year ago and never wore them. I noticed when trying them on that the crotch sits around mid though and assumed they were too tight. I lost some more weight and the leggings now fit but the crotch still doesn't sit where it should and when I looked at the leggings I noticed the crotch was stitched terribly. Loose thread and holes. It's a shame because the rest of the legging feels great but I can't exercise in leggings where the crotch sits mid thigh.
2.0,Cheaaaaaaaaaaaaapppp cheap cheap cheap. Basically made of fabric with a slight leathery looking coating. Edges are frayed and this shoe is crappier than any shoe I ever purchased. I've had better wear on flip flops from the dollar store.
2.0,Nice belt but way too small. I ordered a 38&#34;. I measured it when it arrived and the holes varied between 35&#34; at the smallest and 38&#34; at the biggest. I expect the middle hole to equal the belt size. Returned.
2.0,I normally wear a 3xl and ordered a 4xl. Way too small in the arms and chest. It should not be based on the dimensions given but it is
2.0,I am 5’1 and large chested- this was not for me. It was way too big and made me look pregnant. Returned.
2.0,I’m disappointed with the quality. Need instructions.
2.0,Not very happy with this product I can't even get the ends to stay on the stud they keep falling out of my ear
2.0,You’ll get hot in it. Sucks in towards your mouth and nose when you’re trying to breath.
2.0,Material is sliky like karate or fighter shorts. Belt is not attached and I holes to run through just goes over top. Not cute on
2.0,"Purse hoop that holda the long strap broke on me the first day I wore it on both sides. I easily fixed it, but I also sew, so if you do not it would be a harder fix."
2.0,"Not the same color as the picture . It comes as a dirty gold , like it was hidden in a treasure chest for years. Still cute but not what I expected when I ordered it"
2.0,"The quality of the stitching and assembly was great.  Unfortunately, the fabric is not very good.  Warm water washed and air dried this XL shirt and it still shrunk up to the equivalent of a medium size."
2.0,The handbag is so cute but it fell apart only a couple days after I received it. I had to return it.
2.0,"The fabric is cotton, like t-shirt material. I wasn't expecting the fabric to be like that, seeing as that the description said &#34;bandage&#34;. The fit was ok until around the calf area it was loose and since it's not floor length it looks like a maxi dress that shrunk in the wash. It does not fit around the calf area like it does on the model. The color description say burgundy but it's more of a berry. I didn't spend a wad of money on it so I'll have it altered and live with the color."
2.0,"Loved the look of the dress.  Purchased something similar and loved it, but this one I am not sure it would fit an arm into the waist.  Something was off with the sizing."
2.0,"Only reason to bought this was for money clip but its to weak to hold any,pockets were ok holding cards"
2.0,We need XXL orXXXL SIZES YOUR PRODUCT IS GREAT
2.0,"These are really rough and not as soft as you expect from Maidenform products. They feel cheap and the sizing is small. I bought a 38 C and a 38 D, the D was actually smaller than the C within the same brand. Skip these and just get maidenform from a reputable retailer."
2.0,"totally see through, returned :("
2.0,"Beautiful earrings and great for the price but not if you have sensitive ears. Got these because they claimed to be perfect for just that, but my ears got infected on day 2."
2.0,"I love the product... that being said:<br />The price went up from 19.99<br />The warranty went from lifetime to 1 year.<br />After using, the clasp usually ends up breaking.<br />I am on my 5th.<br />I wouldn't mind paying 25% more if they had upgraded the clasp so it doesn't keep breaking!"
2.0,I didn't like it. I thought it would be more soft and flowing. The dress was stiff and the fabric felt rough. I decently don't recommend this to anyone. it's cheaply made.
2.0,Works as a mask but doesn’t look as good as pictured
2.0,Although I get many compliments on this cute bag ... there are many spots in the material that you can see through. Not cool
2.0,"I did not like that the neck on this top was too short, which caused the shirt to ride up my chest. Because it’s not adjustable, there’s no way to fix it either. Overall kind of frumpy but not the worst"
2.0,Size down if you decide to order.  The fit was too large and they slide off.  Very soft. Really wanted to love these but are really a tripping hazard.
2.0,Not flattering. Very very thin material
2.0,"Ver itchy,had to return"
2.0,The clasp on this does not lie flat on the belt... so you have the metal sort of &#34;winging&#34; out in front of your belly. Not flattering.
2.0,The dress looks better in picture. The white stripes look reddish. Overall the quality is not the best.
2.0,Too short in the back. Returned.
2.0,"They need better color descriptions. Ivory white with stark white photos, yet product is a cream color. Not happy with sizing either. Overall a very disappointing purchase"
2.0,"WAY too small, elastic is constructed incorrectly and won't cinch. Had to give it to my 5 year old to wear."
2.0,I was hoping it would be mode grey<br /> It's really light colored.
2.0,It came missing a few gems but other than that its ok
2.0,I wear 5 1/2 not available so 6 was recommended way to large recomend sticking with your normal size.
2.0,Too big too long
2.0,"Pants seem to be thick and of good quality. After the first wash before wearing the pants the stitching is already coming undone. The shirt is VERY THIN and slick material. The whole outfit is very cute but the slick, thin, and slightly shiny material is not how the shirt appears!"
2.0,A very tight 7” bracelet...
2.0,Size doesn’t fit
2.0,I was so excited to get this but a bit disappointed when it came. The chain length is more like 14-16” (definitely doesn’t hang like the pics show) and the stones are VERY tiny that you can’t even see the different colors. 😩
2.0,Returned then I went up a half size based on reviews. Still too small.
2.0,"Cute shoe, good quality but I ordered a 6 for my 2 year old and it fit smaller than her size 5 shoe."
2.0,The sizes run very small
2.0,logo not centered on the hat my grandson is not happy with the color too
2.0,Did like the stick line in the front of your face and the face guard shield did'nt stay on the mask attack.
2.0,The strings/ties for around the waist is poorly sewed to the apron itself.
2.0,"I usually buy XS, but the arms on this were super short as was the entire shacket. Nice material though, just wish it fit right."
2.0,"Not a fan. Most of these break after one use. My daughter has really fun hair and they work, until they break."
2.0,"I had ordered a white one in the past.  I ordered a M and it fit great, lose and baggy and very soft.  This second order the M was smaller, didn't fit as well although I ordered the same size and the quality of the material was not the same."
2.0,"They are belts, but they are not good ones. The velcro is not stitched on very well, the pile side is coming apart, whatever metal the buckle is made of is very light and cheap feeling too. But hey it holds up my pants."
2.0,Looks like a paper sack.  No shape and really ugly.
2.0,"Very pretty, but they’re not sized for adults, rather for juniors. I bought them intending to gift them to my wife. I’m going to give them to my niece. My 13 year old niece."
2.0,El-cheapo!! Only gave two stars because my son loves it! Otherwise it's a ripoff!
2.0,"I bought these for my brother, who is Strong Protan red-green color blind. They seemed to work a little bit for some colors, like certain (but not all) shades of teal, as well as some purples, but mostly it didn't seem there was an abrupt difference."
2.0,Chose for my gen 3 and it hung over sides on band part that connects to watch face. One side was longer than the other. Beautiful bands but disappointed that they won’t work
2.0,"I am a solid size 8, but the XXL was still very tight and wholly unflattering on me,  but I am just a fairly slim older woman.  This might work on a much younger woman who is very fit and thin."
2.0,Too small in thigh
2.0,Right foot was a whole size bigger.
2.0,"My daughter wears kids size disposable & cloth masks, so thought these would be great for her. Sadly, these are TODDLER size....like for 2-4yrs old."
2.0,The pjs fit weird and were not exactly as I had expected.  The pants’ seems are somewhat twisted in their fit!  They are cute but probably will not order pjs online again.
2.0,Loved these when I first received them wore them on and off for a straight week and then they changed color and turned my fingers green. I don't recommend if you're looking to get long time use of these rings but if your looking to wear once or twice then go for it.
2.0,They were way to small.  So disappointed
2.0,"Just received this very nice looking watch. Was looking forward to wearing it right away. However, when I tried to put it on I discovered that this watch is made for a VERY thin person!  The band is very short. The entire length of the watch is 9 inches and the last fastening hole is at 8 inches. So if you have a wrist size of 7.5 inches (my wife’s size) this watch may be for you. I’ll have to return it."
2.0,This dress is not my favorite of the summer dresses by Elise Bloom. I don't like the top piece and I don't like the bottom and I don't like that it doesn't fit according to their size chart.
2.0,"Fits small. My 7 year old is still in 6, so I ordered a 7 and the waist is really tight o  her. If I were to re-order I would order a 9 to make sure it fit well. Length is good but waist is snug."
2.0,"Wanted to like this as i have the dress it is pictured with, but it just wasn't flattering."
2.0,Shoe was okay but run small.
2.0,"The color is lighter, the dress runs small, and the fabric is thin. In order for me to not show my underwear, I have to put on a slip or shape wear. Kinda annoying when you want to be comfortable. Oh and I don’t like the seam in the front and back."
2.0,BEWARE.  Asian sizing. I ordered these in the largest size (i did not see the fine print indicating these were Asian sized) and the waist would barely have fit a 10yro sucking their stomach in.
2.0,"I normally wear a size small in most tops, because so have very narrow shoulders and thin arms, but I decided to order a size med for a little room while working out.  I had to take it off after a few mins because it was so tight under my arms.  If you’re going to purchase these tops, I highly suggest going up a few sizes."
2.0,"The previous reviews are accurate, this pullover runs large and the collar is twice as tall as other brands 1/4 zips.  Out of th he package the fabric is stiff and doesn't hang well.  I'm going to wash it in hope of shrinking it and softening up the fabric.  The collar alone is reason enough to return it but it might be good for shoveling snow, playing hide and seek or jumping off a cliff and gliding safely to the bottom."
2.0,It’s definitely cute but the amount of times I had to tighten it just made me take it off completely
2.0,the leather cord is very cheap looking and very poor quality
2.0,I ordered a 2nd larger size and the measure exactly the same.
2.0,color change fast turned white.
2.0,"bad quality, feels like toy or for a child"
2.0,"bought this as gift, when I saw the item I wasn't sure if I should give it.  It's a mess and some patches are about to detach from the fabric itself.  Not a good buy."
2.0,"These pants feel and look very cheap. The fabric is coarse, the lining of the pockets shows through and is visible when wearing them. They have no fly but awkward red stitching where it should be."
2.0,These pants look nothing like the picture. These are size Large. They said they are straight leg and these jeans flar out. The material is cheap feels like it can tear if I were to bend over. They don’t fit in the right places! Yeah no very disappointed I wanted these for my birthday party but instead I will be returning them
2.0,I ordered a small .. and can barely get it over my chest.
2.0,"I wanted to love this sweater, but it runs very small, and is made out of a weird material."
2.0,"The material was good quality and blouse is adorable but I am 5'6"" and it did not cover my butt cheeks (I intended to wear it as a dress) it is going back unfortunately"
2.0,"The printing on the shirt was jagged and not crisp and clean at all. I didn’t even bother trying it on because there were black spots all over the white writing (pictured), which is my main reason for returning. Super cheaply done and I do not recommend, at least not the merry & bright Christmas one."
2.0,very thin material and almost see through.
2.0,This belt is very light and cheaply made. I have order others for the same price and the quality is better.
2.0,"The dress was not flattering due to construction issues. The bust was too loose and weirdly shaped, with the ruching climbing way higher than it does on any of the models, so it just looked awkward. The hip ruching is sewn in at the hip so it doesn't actually come off my body, and the bodice doesn't get tight to my body so it doesn't show my figure and just looks wrinkly (if you look at the pictures, my body doesn't look like this). But the dress is still tight on my hips and was a challenge to put on.<br /><br />The dress also has loose stitches as pictured, especially where the slit is. The fabric and dress is quite heavy, so the material is quality, it just wasn't flattering. I really wanted to like it but I knew I would never wear it because it didn't look good."
2.0,"I thought I was ordering a S or a S/M but instead got leggings which were huge, one size fits all - I assume, and would be much too big for my petite daughter.  Not worth the trouble and expense of returning, so I will keep these and wear myself as cold night PJ bottoms. (I don't wear leggings or tights of this weight in my climate.)  Material is soft and plush.  Too bad this item lacks very necessaary sizing."
2.0,Dislike it. Not what I thought it would be .....
2.0,Got smaller with each wear and wash. I wash in cold and hang dry and still seemed to shrink....loved the first wear tho...
2.0,The overalls also had a green tint to them. I will be returning them.
2.0,"Wow this was so pretty. I bought it for my mother-in-law for Christmas and thank goodness I took it out of the package to inspect it. The scarf had snags and quite. Few threads coming undone. I returned it and Amazon was accommodating, like always. But really there should be better quality control from the seller. I was extremely disappointed."
2.0,Cats body is already separating from the head.
2.0,"Very cheap. Does not match the picture.  Not as crisp, blurry image, no red."
2.0,"I like the actual charm. But this necklace is definitely not a choker or 16”. Put this on and the charm is halfway down my stomach. So yes you could shorten it by using the clasp in a different link, but then you have the chain hanging down your back. Definitely not what I was expecting or can use for my event. Probably won’t return only because it would cost more to ship back then the item itself!"
2.0,"This is being marketed as a waterproof jacket, at best it's a windbreaker, maybe it's water resistant. It's 100% nylon which means it might keep you dry for a half hour drizzle. Certainly nothing special about this, rather disappointing. Not a horrible looking jacket, the zipper seems to be pretty good quality, but the jacket really is like any other windbreaker you have in your closet, and it is a little loud when you move with it on. I'll probably send it back because I have other windbreakers. It's not worth your time or money buying this unless you didn't have a windbreaker. FYI, I am 6' and about 180 lbs., the large was about right for those of you who actually want to buy this."
2.0,It’s bulky and cheap looking.
2.0,"Beautiful looking dress, but very small! We ordered an XL and it looked like a womens small or childs XL."
2.0,This dress looked amazing but came with a disturbing brown stain on it.
2.0,My son normally wears size 7 so I got him an 8 to have plenty of room and it is almost to small!
2.0,"This coat is like a giant sleeping bag. It is definitely warm, but it looks like you're wrapped in a sleeping bag. A nice added feature is the ribbed wrist cuffs which fit snugly and would keep wind from blowing up the sleeves. I liked the design of the collar that turns into a hood but I hated the cheap plastic buttons. On the black coat the buttons are white. They are thin discs with sharp edges and look really cheap. Also, because there is no zipper I would imagine that wind would get into the coat which wouldn't be very warm. And I wouldn't recommend this coat for short people. It came way past my knees and just overwhelmed me. I'm always an XS and the small fit fine."
2.0,"Very inconsistent sizing, but overall too big. I ordered this sweater in four colors in a size small. The yellow and brown fit like larges, if not XLs. I was drowning in them. The blue and grey were a bit better but still didnt fit like a small...more like a medium. I returned all of them."
2.0,"Purchased this wallet in August of 2018. Works well but worried about damage to front pocket of dress slacks but put it somewhere else when wearing them. Today I noticed bill clip loose due to 3 screws missing. So as I do like the wallet, the screws missing is a problem.  Not sure I'll purchase one again or not."
2.0,Bought for my 89 yr old dad. Didn’t want to spend a lot. You get what you pay for. I think he’ll have trouble with it because the face goes blank in 5 seconds. Doesn’t have continuous time on screen 😒
2.0,"It's a nice bag but it's a nylon material, not canvas like the description. I was looking for a canvas bag for daily use. This looks like a piece of luggage."
2.0,"These shoes are super cute, but very small. I actually bought these for my daughter to grow into, she cries when wearing these because they are way too small, even though I purchased larger."
2.0,"My size is large, but this product is too big for large size. I ordered in order to wear under my cloth as compression item."
2.0,These socks are in horrible shape after a few wears! Lots of loose threads. They seem to keep my son’s feet warm enough but next time I’ll get Smartwool.
2.0,"I really really wanted to like this dress. I’ve been looking for a long time for a sunflower, sundress.. unfortunately, this one is totally shapeless . Looks like I’m wearing a potato sack. Disappointing. It’s loose from the bust line all the way down."
2.0,These sunglasses were so tight on my head and gave me a headache. The hearts themselves were also huge and just overwhelming for my face. Not at all what I was looking for or expecting.
2.0,These worked above water but once you got in the water you couldn't see. The tinting is off.
2.0,"I did like that it almost completely eliminated frizz, however, my curls were destroyed. It almost straightened my hair!! Maybe my hair isn't curly enough for this? My curls are more intact when just using a silk pillowcase. :/"
2.0,The color was not as pictured and the fit of it was not the same as picture was just overall tight. No “slouch” or anything
2.0,"This really does feel cheap (light-weight plastic, clicking plasticy sound), as some other reviewers suggest. Luckily, the paint job is just convincing enough to wear without looking like a toddler playing dress-up. I used these for a costume party and probably won't use them again."
2.0,Nice gloves for the money but for one that came with a hole in the palm.
2.0,"Good quality plastic locks but over half of the locks I received were black, gray or dark blue - not the fun brightly colored lock colors shown in the picture."
2.0,The sleeves were shorter than pictured. My main issue is that I received it in a ziplock bag with NO tags. No tags attached nor sewn  inside.  It almost seemed as though it may have been a used product and for the price I expect better than that. The product itself is otherwise pretty accurate as in  description and pics. Definitely not worth over $20.00
2.0,Soft thin leggings. Not trousers at all.
2.0,These are more costume-y than fashionable.  They don't fit well.
2.0,Much smaller than expected. Returned.
2.0,It fits well if you order one size up. There is no Marine Corps emblem on the hip. The quality is not great. The lettering is a pretty cheap iron on. I realize you get what you pay for but I would not recommend this item. There are a lot better USMC items on Amazon.
2.0,Looks tacky.
2.0,I didn’t like them
2.0,Size large was like a medium had to send back
2.0,The dress sizes are off based on color. One dress for fine in large. The other one didn’t. And so it’s possible<br />To be a l in one color and then a m or xl in another.
2.0,"I wanted to love this nursing dress, especially since it had pockets, but it was just so flimsy and poorly made that I ended up returning it. The underneath layer was poorly attached to the dress and seemed as though it wouldn't last long at all."
2.0,"These fit my son very strangely. They weren’t too small, but they seem to have some kind of a bump that stopped him from walking normally. Also, the red was more of a pink, which doesn’t really work for my boy."
2.0,"Not even close to what the photo makes it out to be,"
2.0,Smaller for then what chart stated
2.0,"fits good however extremely see through!!! I bought it for a cruise i plan on taking in 2 weeks and i dont think i will be able to wear it because it so see through, you would be able to see all the goods LOL i think it would be somewhat ok with a long cardigan, but i am 5'7'' 250lbs size 14/16 so i have a lot of meat on my bones"
2.0,"Cute, but poorly made"
2.0,"There is a hole in one seam. Manufacturing error, I think, because it wasn’t torn. It was simply a “skipped” section in the seam"
2.0,It feels great and very light but comes off very easily.  Very sad b/c I like how it feels on my wrist.  :(
2.0,I love the style and material but i am a bit curvy with some love handles im 5”2 175lbs size 11 jeans i bought an xl and it rolls down from my back is the perfect material that i love similar to spanks but sadly have to return l.
2.0,"I've always worn Medium, but this sweatshirt is too large and it doesn't resemble Russell sweatshirts that I've purchased in the past.  I've always been a fan of Russell Athletic gear, but I guess I'll have to shop elsewhere for sweatshirts in the future."
2.0,"Unfortunately, the screen printing was really poor.  The blue ink had bled into the white skull and the ""L"" is missing part of the boarder.  The zipper is not good quality and the stitching around the zipper was frayed. Material is soft and fit as expected.  Returning this item"
2.0,They are ok. They run a bit small and the fin came off already but they comfy and cute
2.0,"Looks great and has good quality materials.  Aside from that .... ugh.<br />The length is small.  The person I bought this for has a standard sized wrist (standard watch band) and this was small.  To add insult to injury, when it was dampened in a rain shower, as it dried it tightened and shrunk further.  Had to cut it off.<br />Cannot recommend."
2.0,very hot to wear.  by the time I took off at the end of the day my face was very red and irritated.  the material feels stiff and rather papery.  design is good but material doesn't breathe at all.
2.0,Chain easily broke when I put it on. Didn’t get to enjoy wearing it.
2.0,"The face plate is decent material. The straps are super stiff, and feel very cheap.  Its NOT the same quality as my G-shock originally came with. Very disappointed with quality."
2.0,"Average quality . I expected better quality .the sewing of the right pocket was defectively reversed creating a bulk over the pocket . Also the lower button is falling off , low quality sewing .  The design is  classic  and good .the size runs slow one size down . If I am large , I order X large to fit . In my opinion , this product is overpriced ."
2.0,First of all it had such a funky smell to it. Almost like fish. I aired it out before trying it in. The top was so large. I’m big busted that was not the problem. The shoulders were way too big. Loved the color. Did not like the corset back. I returned it. This style is made for a very tall medium busted woman.
2.0,The buttons make this dress look very tacky. They look very cheap.
2.0,"I only dry fitted this for a moment as the fit was way off.  I ordered an XL.<br /><br />I am 6'3"", 201lbs.  43"" chest, 38"" waist (though typically wear 34-36"" jeans).  According to the size chart for XL, I am at the top of waist and chest, dead in the middle weight and 2"" too tall.<br /><br />Length was surprisingly good.  Sleeves were too short but I fully expected that.<br /><br />The issue - way too loose, even dry!  Even with the sleeves being 3"" too short, they were way loose.  Water would just pour in them.  The waist, especially at the bottom, was also too loose.<br /><br />Based on the sizing guide, this should have been tight on me.<br /><br />I have a XXL O'Neill jacket that I bought when I was 25lbs heavier that fits tighter than this thing (and is too loose)."
2.0,"Pretty watch. Problem I had was the bracelet clasp. It is a new &#34;improved?&#34; design the looks nice when you wear it. But, I could never successfully fasten it. The dual fold over snap, thingy, is impossible for anyone with less than exceptional manual dexterity. It takes three hands to master it. My husband had to help me fasten it, which meant that I could no longer dress myself  !! Also, after fastening it, it would pop loose by itself with a simple movement of my arm. Very disappointing.Quality good, design poor."
2.0,"This is a super cute outfit, but the quality is just not there. The shirt is extremely thin... and I'm hoping it makes it through the wash pre-wearing. I would not suggest ordering this outfit."
2.0,So cute and summery. Just way too small for anyone who has anything larger than an A cup.
2.0,Very cute bought these for picture day came in fast and is cute kinda thin but good quality for price and small when my son sits down his legs show when he stands it covers him
2.0,"Great looking watch, very well-crafted and classy looking, nice functions. I give it 2 stars because it arrived with the second hand slipping, which makes you look weird if you are sitting across from someone and they notice. I thought about asking for a replacement, but the price is not worth my time."
2.0,The seams are not sown on 2 or 3 pairs of the shorts. I am disappointed..
2.0,About  sizes smaller than the size I bought.
2.0,too heavy and not shaped to stay on a child's head which is sort of the point... i couldn't even get it to stay inking enough to get a photo of her wearing it.
2.0,Shorts were too tight. We’re supposed to be more of a loose fit but we’re not. Nice color but just didn’t work for me.
2.0,Pants are not made for the average person. Too too narrow
2.0,This bracelet is very pretty but extremely lightweight. My fiancée loved it but within the week it fell off her wrist and she didn’t even notice it was gone. She was heartbroken.
2.0,Wished it was a solid color.
2.0,too large didnt like them
2.0,Odd fit. Sleeves wide and oversized.  Neck oversized.  Ordered a large when I usually wear a medium.  When I buttoned it up the buttons were pulling.  The body portion of a large wasnt even large enough for a C cup size. Returning.
2.0,Materials are ok. But does not fit well and band is not supple and therefore somewhat uncomfortble. Would not buy again.
2.0,Fits too small for an adult
2.0,"These dresses are not like what you see. they are totally different they are $10 dresses… the picture makes them look like they can be $40 beautiful dresses, but when she get them they look like $10 dresses, cheap looking smh"
2.0,"I was satisfied with the fit and material, however, seams in the inner thigh came apart with 1st use. Glad I was working out at home And not a the gym d/t the covid lockdown. I haven’t decided if I will sew them or return them."
2.0,"Just not flattering on my frame, so I returned them."
2.0,These leggings run smaller than any lined legging I have ever bought.
2.0,"I really like these glasses for the price. They are light weight and fit well. However, the little tab on the ear piece isn't glues on all the way so every time I pull them off my hair gets stuck in there and it pull my hair our of my head. I was super hopeful for these but that is just annoying and makes me think twice about wearing them when the sun is shinning."
2.0,"The color in this picture is beautiful. The actual color isn't even close. Functionally, I am sure that it is fine. Cannot speak to the durability as yet."
2.0,Its very bad quality. i am very disappointed.
2.0,"It's heavy, does not worth the price"
2.0,"I intended to use this puffy coat to compress down into a small lightweight bundle to go in my backpack. Although shown in both description and pictures, the compression sack was not included.  At 17 ounces it hardly qualifies for light weight."
2.0,The adjustable band they have at the top makes it hard to get a good fit and bunches up around your nose so if you have to wear glasses it is very hard to wear.
2.0,This felt more like a negligee than a swim suit. Sides were very see through
2.0,Thin and clingy. Not a warm sweater. Too thin to keep someone warm.
2.0,"The skirt is much too big and too long for me. It you are under 5 ft 5in, I definitely wouldn’t order."
2.0,"I loved this bra when I first got it. Great minimizer and sucked in the back fat.<br />However, after wearing it a couple of times the first couple of weeks, the strap tighteners wouldn't stay put. They kept loosening on me. I had to keep them in place with safety pins.<br />Now, two months later (and not wearing this bra daily), one of the straps ripped right off of the bra.<br />This is pretty sucky because it's beyond the time that I can return it.<br />Such a major bummer."
2.0,"No front or back tag.<br />Shirt feels great wonderful texture but,<br />It is made incorrectly this is why no front or back label.<br />I was told polyester cotton blend fabric but,<br />No fabric care label on the shirt inside<br />No fabric care tag means No FABRIC I.D<br />The shirt does not have a fabric tag to state what the fabric is made out of not the percentage of the blend such as 65% polyester 35% cotton this is the<br />Usual good fabric blend for white dress shirts..<br /><br />Never buy a all cotton white dress shirt because the cotton will do nothing but wrinkle as your putting it on.’the polyester blend keeps the shirt from wrinkling that’s why the two fabrics are blended to create a smoother lookin dress shirt for men.<br />THIS SHIRT PULLS FROM THE UNDER ARMS AS IF YOU WERE PUTTING ON A SHIRT MADE WITH TWO BACKS OR TWO FRONTS!<br /><br />THE SHIRT PULLS AND WRINKLES ACROSS YOUR STOMACH AND YOUR CHEST,<br />ITS PULLING BAD FROM THE UNDER ARMS, YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE FABRIC UNDER YOUR ARM PITS AND CLOSE TO THE BODY, ONCE YOUVE FIGURED OUT, WHAT SIDE OF THE SHIRT LOOKS BEST ON THE FRONT OF YOU!<br />THATS WHY NO FRONT OR BACK LABEL!<br />I AM RETURNING MINES, (THE SHIRT IS A WACK<br />DEFECTIVE DESIGN!)<br />ITS A FACTORY DEFECT ITS MADE INCORRECTLY!<br />LEAVE IT TO MAINLAND CHINA 🇨🇳<br />GOTTA LOVE UM.... LIL HUSTLERS!"
2.0,"it was too small, perhaps needed a bit more dept"
2.0,Seemed poor quality.  No tags whatsoever not even the size or washing instructions or material.  Made in china.
2.0,Only meant for people with longer torsos. The fit is very awkward
2.0,"Just received this and I thought it was very cute.  I wanted a “fuller coverage” apron and this fits the bill.  BUT, the fabric was kind of stiff so I put it in the wash quickly before first use.  Took it out of the washer and the back hem was already unraveled and fabric fraying.  I’ll probably try to save it some way with fray-check and stitching; however, this should not be needed for a brand new item."
2.0,It was too wide for me
2.0,But the fabric is fairly thin. It's not like a heave duty sweatshirt or anything. We thought it ran a bit small as well. BUT it does fit and it looks cool.<br /><br />Edit: washed it once per directions and it shrunk terribly. Not impressed.
2.0,"Very cute, fits well, pockets are very big, but I’ve only been wearing it for a couple months and there are already two tears in the lining seams"
2.0,"I feel like this swimsuit could only be flattering on someone with a long torso. On me it was bunchy, and felt like it had a lot of extra fabric, which is something I’ve never experienced in a swimsuit. I didn’t really notice the tummy control, and it’s definitely not suited for a large-chested person either. Not a ton of support there. I like the style, and the color is nice, but the fit is so bizarre that I don’t see myself ever wearing it."
2.0,This coat is made in Indonesia. 1st one purchased was made in China & had much better/thicker insulation.
2.0,Too small for most adults. Otherwise good.
2.0,"Too bad the fit is too small. I went by the measurements and even went a size up. The cut is weird, very straight not A line at all, how the picture makes it look."
2.0,"This bikini is not as it was advertised in the photos. The bottoms are perfectly fine, however the top piece is awkwardly shaped and I was unable to figure out how to use it. Very disappointed."
2.0,"I liked the overall dark tribal pattern with pops of color in the picture.  What I received was not the same.  It is lighter with different colors and more of a chevron pattern.  The cord itself is very soft and comfortable, but the Croakies tag on the end has sharp corners.  It is okay enough that I will keep it, but it is not what is pictured."
2.0,"I washed them before having baby wear them and they all fell apart, the knot fell off the headband. They also all stretched out. They were cute and fit pre-wash but now look and fit differently."
2.0,Zipper broke within 10 minutes
2.0,The frame seems too wide and the arms are loose.
2.0,"Strange cut, didn't work for me at all but I am long waisted"
2.0,This outfit was beautiful and great quality and material but the sizing was wrong. It was to small for my daughter. I would size up if I ordered again.
2.0,I thought this was a sweater but it is actually very thin t-shirt material. the buttons are cute and if I wanted a long sleeve t-shirt it would be nice. be aware the patches on the elbow are felt material. I will be returning this
2.0,The quality of the product was underwhelming. Neither the fabric nor the stitching were up to the expectations for North Face product.
2.0,"Yeah, it's a Suicidal bandanna, but like the title of my review clearly states, the product was a bit stiff. Even after a wash with fabric softener, the fabric's flexibility and malleability were questionable. Besides that complaint, I found the bandanna to be over-sized, even for someone like me with a larger than average cranium. Pricey and uncomfortable."
2.0,Not really as high quality as it looks in the images. Kimono doesn’t stay properly and it bulks in all the wrong areas. Pretty disappointing.
2.0,No es impermeable se mojan por dentro.
2.0,Ordered the size based on chest measurements recommendations and it was way too big in the chest. Have to take it to a seamstress and pay more than I spent on the dress to get it tailored.
2.0,If your going to have a ruched front why not do the back. Disappointing.
2.0,Size is a large and still too tight and he wears a size 36 waist.  Couldn't even get it over his hips.  Fits very small.  Sent it back.
2.0,There are NO sequins on this dress and the lace underskirt is significantly shorter than the poncho
2.0,I ordered an xl as a gift and it was a bit too small. I would recommend ordering a size up.
2.0,"It looks nice initially, but be prepared it WILL show dirt very quickly and must be cleaned often to keep its orange color. It does fade over time because of the frequent cleanings.  There is a bit of give in the band allowing for some stretch and snug fitting. Eventually, the plastic loop at slips into the phone broke after three months of daily use, rendering it useless."
2.0,Very cheaply made and getting worn out and ratty looking after only a few weeks
2.0,These puppies blew out on me after three weeks. Shame really as I liked them :)
2.0,They weren't adjustable like I thought they were supposed to be
2.0,These are just flimsy little temp pieces. I got them before I knew much about body jewelry and didn't know better.
2.0,"The crotches of the pants just didn’t fit right, it had too much fabric gathered underneath."
2.0,"If you are extremely tall, this shirt MIGHT work for you.  I'm 6'0&#34; and the cut of the shirt is so low it covers my gut area but not much of my shoulders and chest.  Maybe Kareem Abdul-Jabbar would look nice wearing it. Otherwise, forget it!"
2.0,Bought these for my sister I know right anyways she brought them back said they were discollored
2.0,Not happy with product.  It's warm that is the only thing I can say that's positive about it other then The color is true red.
2.0,On time but starts balling up quickly
2.0,"When i received my son's shoes only one shoe was working so i thought it was dead so when i went to charge it the shoe never came on.His first day wearing them was on February 11, 2018 and only one shoe was lighting up very disappointed."
2.0,It does have a waist band and it is tight. So you can't order your regular size. The rest of the pantys look like they would fit but I could not  stretch the waist band enough to get on. Otherwise nice material and made well.
2.0,"I believe I was one of the first to order the Tikker watch. I had the idea of a &#34;countdown&#34; watch to make you focus and make the most of your life. In doing a web search for such an item I found the Kickstarter campaign for Tikker. I pre-ordered one and it took quite a while but I finally got it. What a disappointment. It was certainly more expensive than it should have been. It's a cheap timekeeping disc with three fields of LCD display as you can see in the photos. The top series is years/months/days left, the middle is hours/minutes/seconds left and the bottom is regular time. You have to set your expected remaining life-time, it's not like it does it for you. It is large and very bulky when the disc is inserted in the rubber band. I wore it only for a short time after I got it. It quickly lost its novelty probably because of its bulk and poor execution of a good idea. Also, if you accidentally push the top button the countdown display stops. Not sure why they would program it that way. I ended up misplacing the instructions on how to set it and those weren't clear anyway. I just recently pulled the watch out of my drawer to see if anyone was selling them and I found it listed here on Amazon. I could not resist giving my review. I managed to set the watch without instructions and wore it again for a couple days, but back in the drawer it goes. Seriously, don't waste your money, and if you do want to, I'll sell you mine. I think if you like the idea of a &#34;countdown&#34; watch the Mr. Jones Watches Accurate would be a better choice. Amazon won't let me post a link.  It doesn't count down but reminds you of your mortality."
2.0,Way too small. Had to give it to my son
2.0,Does not fit as described...way too small!!
2.0,It holds my cards efficiently but is nearly the same size as the wallet it replaced. It's difficult to remove my ID card from the clear ID holder.
2.0,really unconfortable... to small.. but is gorgeous.
2.0,"Nice top, but arms were very, very slim."
2.0,"Not exactly what I wanted.  The curve on the end is too small, too sharp for my heel to fit to  ease my foot into my shoe.  I only use it when I have to fly as I know it will pass security"
2.0,Design is good but the quality is bad
2.0,The eye slits we small and couldn’t see even poorly out of them.  No peripheral vision what so ever.  Do not recommend.
2.0,"Love the style, fit, and look of this dress but extremely disappointed in the care instructions. This dress should be dry clean only but the instructions on the tag are to wash it.  The top turned green and the bottom is mis-colored after following the instructions and only washing one time."
2.0,cheap that is all you need to know.
2.0,This wasn't the length I needed
2.0,I didn’t expect when I received the shoes to have it be shinny.
2.0,"My son love them, but unfortunate one shoe stopped working after less then a month.<br />had to sent them back!"
2.0,These had holes in them after two wears
2.0,"Product was very small and the quality left a lot to be desired, but I made it work for my costume."
2.0,I loved the color but it runs too small.
2.0,OK piece.
2.0,"I bought this product because my sunglasses fog up while walking with a face mask.  What I have found is it doesn't work in chilly morning temperatures.  I usually walk in the mornings when its in the 30's or 40's.  The product doesn't work until the temperature was up.  Above 50 it seems to work.  I have applied every time before I go out.  Yesterday I confirmed the issue. I live in California, and due to Covid, face masks are mandatory everywhere."
2.0,I don't like the grey yoga pants. I'm going to return.
2.0,"Material is pretty thick yet stretchy, the holes look like they’ve been hole punched, went with an XL although I normally wear larges but it’s oversized enough to buy your your regular shirt size. Overall too big/long, and looks pretty cheap. Comfortable though"
2.0,You get what you pay for. First of all they’re not big....the ones I got did not look like the two toned ones I ordered. They’re flimsy and cheap. I have them to my 10 yr old. Not what I expected.
2.0,Love the style but medium was cut very small.
2.0,Cheaper made than what I thought.
2.0,I wanted to love this but it was a bit clingy and the color/pattern was not as pretty in person. Returned.
2.0,This item is tiny when compared to the pic. I was shockingly surprised when I got it. Didn’t consider it worth the effort to return it
2.0,"It seems like the cheap imitation. If it IS leather then its really cheap leather but, I guess its a really cheap band so...<br /><br />I would not buy this again."
2.0,I can not believe all the perfect reviews on this. I’ve had another type of this brand skirt and I love it. The fit is great. But this “breathable mesh” material is completely see through! Has tiny holes all over it. And that is not modest at all! 2 stars is for the fit. Or else it would be 1 Star. Returning for another material/style in the same brand.
2.0,EARRINGS ARE NOT USABLE AND I NEED TO RETURN ITEMS BOUGHT AS A PACKAGE
2.0,It's a super practical purse. But strap broke after about 3 weeks.
2.0,Really tight across the chest for me but the length was just right. Dont know if Ill wear it again. Loved the pattern
2.0,"I am short...barely 5 feet tall, and this did not fit me at all like the photo. It is on the shorter side of tunic length at best."
2.0,Updating my review to show that the bag tote within 3 months of purchase. I’m so disappointed because it really is a cute bag but it won’t last long.
2.0,"Very cute but changed colors, the black spots will not rub off. I’ve tried Lysol wipes and soap and water. Very disappointing."
2.0,"This is a cute, very well-made small purse - but 10 minutes after starting to wear the bag, the back of my neck started to feel like bugs biting followed by an intense itch.  After another 10 minutes, I could even feel the itch through my thin tee shirt wherever the strap rested.  I guess I am sensitive to either the burgundy dye or the fabric that is backing the leather strap.  I'll keep the purse to use as a clutch, but BUMMER!  I'm really sorry to give this bag a bad review, as my problem probably won't be an issue for most people."
2.0,"runs small, very flimsy material, needs iron after wash"
2.0,It was broken when I first wear it. So angry!
2.0,Nice bag but shoulder strap broke and fell to the ground when I was walking into work
2.0,"This jacket is very light weight and rolls up small.  It runs small, I ordered an XL-women/L-men and this barely fit my boyfriend who normally wears a large and it barely fit me (I'm also a large) where it zips at the bottom. The lower stomach part by the bottom band is where you feel it get tight. Not on the chest or torso.<br />This fabric is water resistant to a point. It would not be resistant in a downpour. It passed the test if I ran it through water quickly, but if I fill an outer part of the jacket with water it does leak if I touch the inside fabric. It's very similar to being in a tent with condensation.<br />This jacket is so staticky. It was attracting pet hair and my own hair from everywhere. The fabric is very similar to a kids play tent.<br />The picture I uploaded with the hood shows that's as far as the hood will go up over my head. It feels really weird like my forehead is just exposed to the rain.<br />I'm not crazy about this but at the same time I don't hate it. It is light weight and if it's lightly raining, it will still work. It's also more breathable than the other 2 I currently have."
2.0,"Don't size up for extra length. The shirt is too wide, and it looks like you're wearing the shirt of an obese man."
2.0,"Nice little earrings, but different color than the other sterling I have. It’s a very cool-toned silver that doesn’t seem to tarnish. Coated in rhodium? Regardless, if it’s not marked .925, it could be anything. That’s why metal markings exist...."
2.0,It’s a pretty shirt but it’s basically 100% polyester... I was thinking it was a cotton blend which I would have loved.  Hate to say it but it reminded me of a cheap shirt from Dollar General:(
2.0,"I was so excited to find a new band for my Samsung Gear Fit2.  This band however will not stay connected.  In the 2 weeks I have owned it, my watch has fallen off my wrist at least 1x per day, as many as 4x per day.  If it would stay connected, I would be happier with the band."
2.0,"Fit was off...really short in the torso, which is strange because I'm 5'2&#34; with a really short torso.  Fabric had no give at all which was different for a betting suit.  Returned a week ago and have yet to receive a refund."
2.0,"Bought these to use for senior softball. Shoes were extremely tight and could not be fully laced up. Going up a size would have made the shoe too long and drag the toes. A wide or double wide version would be an ideal option, however that size is/was not available."
2.0,"This beanie grows as you wear it. The fabric is not tightly woven. The hat, though advertised as wool,  is neither warm nor comfortable."
2.0,Did not look as nice in person didn't like the cut.
2.0,Seams are cheaply put together.  Wore them twice and the seams started to come undone.
2.0,It looked cute was too long and transparent that I decided to return it
2.0,Smaller than expected and don't trust how it was packaged.  Not worth returning and will not buy again.
2.0,"Does not look like like pictures and feels even worse. Crap polyester, almost plastic like fell to the fabric. Pretty gross. But it’s covid and it fits well and I’m not going out to a club or anything so who cares."
2.0,"Size-wise this dress fit as expected, but the waste was super high. I have a relatively long gorse so it was not a good fit for me. But on the right person, I suspect it's darling!"
2.0,"I give the slippers 2 stars for the waterproof / washable outer material & the ability to wash & hang dry the insoles. Here's were they lose stars: 1 - these things are UGLY. They look like they're made for fat Flinstone feet (I'm dating myself) 2 - they are way too wide for the average foot and have too much room inside from top to bottom. They fit in length, but otherwise look 2 sizes too big, in part due to comment 1. 3 - the memory foam felt soft and snuggly for about 20-30 minutes of walking around my house. They then started to feel flatter and looser to the point of my feet starting to slip out. Usually, crappy memory foam slippers take a few months to a year to wear down. These didn't last an hour. I planned on keeping them at first (in spite of their ugliness) due to the washabilty & lower price, but I couldn't because of the foam."
2.0,This product is made very cheap. No worth the money.
2.0,"Based on the size chart, I ordered a size medium and it barely fits. I'd be afraid to wash it in fear of it no longer fitting! For reference, I’m 5’2’’, 115lbs, 34D, 26-27 W.  The material feels like a cheap paper jean material - sounds similar to a paper bag with movement. The design of the buttons make it very difficult to take off and on. Will be returning."
2.0,Coat was size at a 3X.  I were a 1X.  I could not close the coat to button it.  I would like to receive a lable to return item.
2.0,I would of loved this had to not broke as soon as I took it out of the bag.. it was very flimsy.. but it was so pretty. I wore one..would of been a great purchase
2.0,I'm 5'3 and 100lbs. The small is huge. It was way too long and its like a large through the waist.
2.0,Size up!  Got my daughter her usual size 10 and they are to small.  Material is very thin
2.0,"It was easy to set the size and the quality appears great at first,  but within hours the black coloring started chipping in small areas on the band."
2.0,"So three of the 5 pairs slip off my feet, my daughter tried them as well and they did the same thing to her.  Very frustrating!  I will not be buying these again. Very disappointed. it was like all of the socks in the this order were different sizing."
2.0,It looks ok but is flimsy and isnt as maneuverable as it claims.
2.0,It's way to small.  Too much trouble to try and send it back.  I'll re-gift it.
2.0,It's nice a bit snug & not the 1 I ordered...not sure why I was charged $20. W/tax 3xs the amount listed $6.99
2.0,"Super cute, the colors are vibrant and I get compliments BUT It’s definitely muffles my voice, harder for anyone to understand me. It’s not very breathable and I find it hard to catch my breath at times."
2.0,"Loved these shorts at first. Sometimes felt a little short but don't think they actually revealed anything. Waistband elastic always needed time-consuming straightening after laundry. Very careful hand wash would might keep elastic in place. Also, they strarted to snag, though im not sure how as i only out them on to walk and dont sit down anywhete before i take them off. Extremely comfortable and looks good. If they'd held up better to the light use I gave them, I'd have given 4 stars. Missed the return window because I wanted so much for them to work out."
2.0,"Not sure why anyone would want this belly ring unless they don’t mind removing it before every shower or before getting in a pool. It discolored easily, it took under a month for the top “rose” to fade from red to yellow.  It’s VERY cute but the cuteness is short lived."
2.0,It looked nice and I was happy with it then it just broke for no reason
2.0,I’m pretty muscular but usually still around small or medium. This ran way smaller and the material is not reliable.
2.0,"Dress was pretty and looked much more expensive than it is, but it was was way too big. I’m 5’2, 105 lbs, 32A and the train of the dress was too long even with heels, and the chest and arm area did not fit at all. I liked that the dress was padded and I wish it would have fit better."
2.0,I love the dress but can I return and change the size to X-large and in the cholate print? I love the dress but realize blue is not looking good on me.
2.0,"I absolutely LOVED this wallet but the strap broke off because the clasp split (it appears to be made of plastic rather than metal). I am extremely disappointed because this is the perfect size. It is large enough to hold my iPhone, keys, some loose change, cash and credit cards. The wristlet piece is critical if you want to use this instead of a purse so I cannot recommend for that reason!"
2.0,"I’m wearing size 9 and these flip flops fit nicely on the bottom, and size 9 is correct. HOWEVER, the straps are too loose, and even though my feet have high arches I still have to flex my toes in order to grab the flip flops securely when walking.<br />I’m glad I paid only $20 on sale, but even that is not worth it."
2.0,"Cute but disappointed. The octopus fell off at some point on my second day having it in and I can't find it. Still wearing it but as I bought it specifically for the octopus, I'm not very happy with it."
2.0,So disappointed...this top ran really small.  Was so looking forward to wearing it.
2.0,"They run a little bit big. I returned the mediums got a small and it isn’t much different. 5’3”  120lbs athletic with hips.<br /><br />Biggest bummer wore them with a white t-shirt... sweated a lot, they dyed my t-shirt pink!"
2.0,Won't last long
2.0,The only reason it's getting any stars is the rapid shipping.<br />The tops don't snap in.  At all.  Useless.
2.0,Oh my there were so many things wrong with this item the material is very thick and heavy not Supple at all the fit was too long on the bottom and a fitted Square bottom of some kind on the shirt and the pattern was atrocious I felt like a human cow and I'm not a big person but I was very disappointed it looks so classy in the picture but the colors were black with a dirty white save yourself the time this one wasn't worth it to do in order to find people and find those bodies is so hard for him to accept so he goes
2.0,"I wear a size 11 1/2 wide shoe and couldn't get these socks on my feet even with help appliances.  So, I gave them to Goodwill, and maybe someone with a real narrow foot can use them."
2.0,even with a difference in monitor brightness (which my screen is actually not that bright) the colors on the shirt are much darker. makes it look extremely odd. only reason I'm not returning is i just yesterday returned a different package and i need shirts. at least sizing was correct
2.0,"Really cute costume style bracelet, smaller in real life than pictured and was a bit difficult to get on my wrist. Its pretty though. However it arrived with an offset hinge so I cant fully close it. If it werent for that I would rate it higher"
2.0,Love the plaid and that's about all. This bag is poorly made and the materials are really low quality.
2.0,Tiny. Too small.  Fall out of ears. Cant see them
2.0,They fit and are comfortable if you are looking for mesh shorts but so thin you see anything you wear underneath them
2.0,"Meh, not what I was hoping for during my night drives"
2.0,Hard to put in due to the short post on the stud that you have to screw in
2.0,A lot bigger and bulkier than imagined. I have quite a few piercings and couldn't use this for any of them.
2.0,Runs very small. My daughter is 10 and I ordered the xl. It looked more like a small/medium.  Had to pay return shipping as well. So lost 6$ on this purchase. Will never order from this company again!
2.0,"La talla demaciado pequeña, mi esposa es talla M siempre pero este vestidoes muy pequeño para ser talla M,  si pensas en comprar  uno como este deberias comprar una talla mas grande de la q usas🤨"
2.0,The color wasn't very accurate and it fit me super big
2.0,I ordered this because it said size 100. I was so happy to find something cute that grandma would love wearing. I got it in the mail and it DOES NOT fit grandma. It could fit a little kid not a size 100 year old. I did cut it up and made a headband and scarf out of it because what else am I supposed to do when it only fits one of grandma's feet and not her body. I couldn't just waste my money. It was soft so grandma was happy until she saw that I cut the little kids in half on it. She said legs don't deserve to be worn on my head when the face is wrapped around my neck. She got mad and threw them away because she loves kids and didn't want to wear them if they weren't whole kids. I did try though. Grandma is hard to please sometimes.
2.0,This item is not good quality I thought it would be tighter fit<br />They are low rise as well
2.0,The neckline is a boat neck. It is not remotely off the shoulder. Would not buy again.
2.0,"Bought these based on the price, i'm hard on my cycle glasses.<br />Small nose bridge and sharp edges on ear pieces make wearing uncomfortable for me. There is a lot in the kit for the money if you are the sort of person who swaps out their lenses a lot for the condition- i don't tend to do that - more of a grab and go , the over ear parts can be sanded smooth and if you have a small nose its probably a good deal but they don't really work for me."
2.0,"I was hoping the quality of these will be better than the dollar store’s ones, but no... so don’t waste your money on these, might as well just get it at the dollar store."
2.0,not happy the stone chip after one wear
2.0,You definitely get what you pay for...broke after about 10 days of using it. I still use the bottom clip but the chain is cheap.
2.0,Eye spaces don't line up properly. Also very uncomfortable.
2.0,"I seem to be one of the unlucky buyers that have an issue with the nose pieces cutting into the bridge of their nose. Extremely painful, and makes it impossible to use the goggles. Unfortunate because these seem to be really great quality and if they were not painful to wear, they would be excellent goggles."
2.0,"This runs very small. I’m normally a medium/large (size 8-10) and this is cut very close. I’m returning it because if it shrinks at all in the wash it won’t fit anymore :/<br />Also the black fabric is sparkly, like black with glittery bits, not plain black. The overall cut is pretty, very flattering, the faux pockets are a little strange."
2.0,Fits like a beanie...
2.0,Separating from the sole after 5 or 6 wears. Disappointed because these are super cute and super soft.
2.0,Love the color and size but the quality is not great and it just has two small holes to put the strap in to wear as a cross body... you have to tie it inside.
2.0,"Really cute but I don't think this cover can protect your luggage from scratches or dents. It fits my luggage a little weird too, some areas are more loose than others. The material is really thin and of poor quality."
2.0,Product is good but wrong color was shipped.
2.0,Very small fitting for something labeled &#34;loose fit&#34;. The burgundy color I chose was a very bright red.
2.0,Very unhappy with it. Not what I expected.
2.0,"Good news you never have to replace the battery, they don't last long enough to need one. The switching method puts stress on the battery holder where it is soldered to the circuit board. The solder joints fail and if re-soldered the circuit board fails next. On 2 of them the clip failed. They are 1/4 the price of the nite eyes brand."
2.0,Band tore off the clip.
2.0,.... Too big... I'm about 5'9 200lbs... ordered size XL
2.0,I bought xlarge and fits like a medium shirt. Very tight around the arms and it feels like crop top. It basically layer tee shirt. I don't think it would be good for under shirt.
2.0,Looks inexpensive
2.0,I would never buy this luggage again.  Did not last two trips. I used it for a trip to Ireland and one handle ripped completely off.  Took on another trip trying to get my money's worth out of it and the other handle ripped off.  Left with luggage with no handles.  Had to stop my trip and purchase tie wraps and tape to make it home.  Now it's going in the trash.  I don't think I need say more.  So disappointed.
2.0,"This is the cutest belt, the closure works super well, just press down to unlatch.<br />The thing I hate about it is the end piece and the adjustment piece are super difficult to fit through the belt loops. The time it takes to fit it through my belt loops and removing it to wash my jeans makes it not worth the hassle. I've tried it on two pairs of jeans and one pair of cargo capris, very difficult fit on all."
2.0,"I was very excited to use this wallet! It has a lot of pockets and my iphone 6s fits in it perfectly! But when I received the wallet, it smelled strongly of fish. I put it in a ziplock bag with a little bit of  baking soda over night. But it still smelled horrible! I had to take everything out of the wallet because I was going to return it, but my dad saw it/smelled the awful smell and donated it along with other items to goodwill."
2.0,Color and material not what I expected
2.0,"Strange material, very clingy and sizing was small. returned shirt"
2.0,You can't tell from pics but it is made of a VERY sheer yet not at all breathable fabric.  It's like those children's flame retardant pj's around Christmas with cartoons.  Cotton cannot be THAT expensive.
2.0,Their products of quality are highly cheap. Don't buy it.
2.0,Too loose the watch face is to heavy for good support
2.0,"The good: This watch winder looks great, and I love the additional storage spots for your non-mechanical watches.<br /><br />The bad: The biggest issue was that this winder would seemingly lose its programming in the CW / CCW mode. It would default to CW only, so one of my watches wouldn't get wound, which defeats the purpose of a watch winder. Restarting after unplugging from the wall had its issues too. I had to unplug the AC adapter from the winder, set the mode select to off, reconnect everything, and then select a mode. Its louder than I had hoped for, sounds like a purring cat with one watch as the winder would almost chug the watch up the loaded side. The mode selector position was also off from the decal, so you had to count notches from off to get the right mode."
2.0,Cute dress just too small.
2.0,"Likes: Soft, thin  and good stretch.<br />Dislikes: not durable material. I was looking for something soft stretchy and thin but at the same time durable material. This gets 2 stars for low quality material. Can the seller reach out? I need a refund please. Thanks."
2.0,"People need to stop leaving reviews for things they gave as gifts... You don't use it, you don't rate it.<br /><br />Anyway, it's advertised as slim, and as RFID blocking. It is neither. It would be slim, except the snap piece added which bulges in your pocket. Kind of annoying size-wize, and not really useful. An extra step when you reach for your cash.<br /><br />I bought this because I thought it was advertising that it DOES NOT block RFID, which is what I need. I keep my access card and don't want to take it out. Fortunately, the description is inaccurate, and works as I wanted. However, that advert is false. If you're looking for one that blocks signal, this isn't it."
2.0,The gloves are good but cant really get my hand/fingers all the way in there. They keep hands warm and are waterproof but lacks grip.
2.0,"It’s pretty !! But the chain broke first day I wore it, and it rattles inside the bail. It is inside the prongs pretty good though. It is worth the price."
2.0,Is not gold tone y rose
2.0,"The cut and the look of the white leopard print skirt is absolutely nothing like the picture. In the picture, the skirt appears to have structure an weight. It looks like a column skirt that is slightly pinched at the knees. The skirt that was sent to me is shaped like a trapezoid. it is made out of an extremely thin synthetic material that is very similar to the material one finds in umbrellas. The skirt has no lining and it is very clingy. Overall, I think it is it Chinese manufacturing abuse of American customers. Clothing made for Europe by the Chinese companies is much better quality for the comparable price, so why not match the quality for US?!"
2.0,Pretty but large..
2.0,"hate the fabric, very uncomfortable not stretchy at all"
2.0,"They fit nice, a bit snug though. I took them to the beach and I noticed straight lined cracks on the lenses. Can this be covered from the warranty?"
2.0,"fit well, very pilly."
2.0,I bought these for a playboy bunny costume.  I ended up making my own and donating these to good will.  Don't waste your money.
2.0,It's cute but that's about all it has going for it. We've had it for less than a month and it broke. Lost the magnet first and then the astronaut.
2.0,"After wearing in the sun and washing 1 time, (cold water hang dry) the fabric faded and the dress looked a year old. Sad because it’s a very cute dress and a great fit. I got soo many compliments.  Wish the fabric was a polyester that would last for years. Instead I got to wear it out once. :("
2.0,"I liked the idea of a neoprene case, but this didn't fit tightly enough for my comfort level.  It seemed like the screen and buttons could get damaged."
2.0,Nice fabric. Fit well but not well made at all.
2.0,Looked good but does does not sit well at all...
2.0,"I bought these to protect my hands and arms as I treated my cats for ringworm....they were just too bulky to work in. They are good and thick, though, if that is what you need."
2.0,This dress fit fine but was see-through in the tan floral print. The fabric was very thin. The top portion was very cute with the ruffle sleeves but I will be returning because of the sheerness.
2.0,Wayyy to big
2.0,"I was hopeful for these slippers but unfortunately - though I ordered my regular size - they were way too big. They are soft inside, but the fleece lining did not seem secure and clumps of it came off with as I tried them on. There is also no support or cushioning. However, if you order down, don't need the cushioning (for wearing on carpeted floors for instance), and give them some time and wear they may work for you."
2.0,Didn't really like this product to much gave it to my little 5.year old niece to play dress up. Color was of and chain was flimsy.
2.0,The pictures of the item are somewhat misleading. This material of this item is VERY stiff and very scratchy. I returned it right after taking it out of the box and unfolding the dress. I would not recommend this to anyone. It reminds me of a stiff table cloth.
2.0,I only received 5 pendants not 6
2.0,received jacket
2.0,It was tight for a XL head size.
2.0,The pants were too small. It looked cheap.
2.0,"The price is ridiculous, but the biggest problem is that the straps are so loose - I have big wide feet with high arches and usually flip flop straps are too tight, if anything. These are so loose, they just flip around and hang off my foot, even though the foot bed is the right size."
2.0,They’re really cute but runs big
2.0,"**Please read addendum first***<br />I was skeptical about this top (Especially when I took it out of the package and could see daylight through both layers of fabric).  However, my husband assured me that he can't see skin (although I will have to be sure and wear a dark bra) and I didn't buy it to be a toasty warm sweater....just the opposite.  I get so hot when we visit certain homes during the winter because they've got their heat cranked so far up, it's hard to breathe!  I need something that looks nice but is lightweight.  This is perfect!  The ribbed hem keeps it from being too stretchy at the bottom and the ribbed cuffs make the sleeves just snug enough that you can push them up and they stay but are not too tight.  The fabric is lightweight and soft without being too flimsy and clingy.  The neck is not tight but is a little high.  I suppose you could just roll it twice if ot bothered you.  It's absolutely true to size!  I'm 5'8"" and 240lbs.  I usually wear a size 24/26 top (with a generous D cup and big ol' back porch) and I ordered a 1X.  It fits perfectly with just enough blousiness (hope that's a word) that it doesn't feel snug.  Very comfortable.  I have to say, it's definitely not an expensive looking shirt but it doesn't look like it came off the Walmart clearance rack, either.  It's just a good shirt to put on when you want to look nice but you're going to grandma's where it's going to be 95 degrees inside!<br />****Addendum to original post: I just looked at this product again and it has doubled in price since I bought it TWO DAYS AGO!  I'm telling you, ladies, it was barely worth $27!!!!  It's definitely not worth $50!!!  How ridiculous!  I'm knocking off two stars.  This company should be ashamed of themselves!"
2.0,The earring was off the stud! I had to glue it back on! Cheap!
2.0,I returned this item.  Certainly not worth the money.  Very unattractive and magnate was in the wrong place. Tried to adjust it but still didn't work.  There was also no users instruction.
2.0,I have had these lenses only a little over two months. They fit in the frame perfectly but the mirrored finish is already starting to come off in spots. Very disappointing.
2.0,This was feeling and looking like such a perfect bra until I started squeezing the soft material of the bra only to find Silicon packets with Beads in side each of the cups........very displeased. The descriptions of this product did not say anything about it having silicon inside.
2.0,One of the shoes will not charge. I got them for her for school so she has no other ones to wear otherwise you would get back. You got 2 stars for these cause they did come quickly
2.0,I had to return this dress. It’ll probably look good on a tall skinny girl. I’m 5’0 130lbs and it did not look good on me. Chest part looked awkward too I’m a 36DD.
2.0,"I ordered 2 size bigger and still to tide at the bottom , love the color."
2.0,Returned it .
2.0,"I thought this would be &#34;dainty&#34; but it is more like a Christmas tree ornament. Mine measures one and a half inches across and one inch long. (Maybe that is posted somewhere and I missed it?)  I put mine on a piece of ribbon and hang it off the lamp beside my bed. I didn't feel like returning it and I love colored glass anything. The color of the flower is not purple which i really wanted, it's a pale pink. Hope this helps someone with their decision."
2.0,"The stitching was reckless and someone sewed a tear made while making the shirt with mismatching thread. Also, this is not a cotton blend...it's a polyester stretchy blend...like a bathing suit material. I specifically wanted cotton blend. For $6 or $7 bucks I don't expect the highest quality, but the description needs to be accurate and the stitching shouldn't include patch ups like this that stand out."
2.0,These socks are not easy to get on or off as described.
2.0,"They were really small, kids size I would say"
2.0,Letters were falling off
2.0,This pants are smaller than expected.  My crack shows!  Oops!
2.0,This hat was very small for a one size fits all
2.0,The shoes fit well and were comfortable but I returned them because of the color.  I ordered black/grey but they were more like black/purple
2.0,Beads are more like my 12mm than my other 15mm. Otherwise ok but not what as advertised. Gold lettering slowly coming off.
2.0,I like the look of these. The size is perfect for a kid but we've tried two pairs in different colors and both pairs have unhinged and the earrings are lost. They don't secure well at all.
2.0,"Bought this for my son who’s been wanting a pocket watch. It’s a great looking watch, I really liked it. My son loves it. But unfortunately it doesn’t keep good time."
2.0,The round pieces are good but the rear drop pieces are all on crooked.
2.0,"Definitely not the quality I expected from Capezio. After 3 wearings (gentle washing& line-dried) stitching around one arm has totally unraveled. My return window is closed (I bought this a month before dance class started), so I’m stuck."
2.0,"Material is a little stiff not soft at all, not flattering just sits very frumpy, not Foley, if I had had the time to try this on before work I would’ve returned it"
2.0,It is a very boxy dress even with a belt.
2.0,"I was happy to receive the belt as I have ordered many others alike, I got it the middle of January and then last week I went to wear it and the emblem broke off as I was walking and it hit the ground and now it’s not staying on the belt anymore. Disappointing as this is the first belt I got that broke like this!"
2.0,I wish they had other colors
2.0,"I ordered the newborn size,  I received it in the mail and it looks like it could fit a 12 month old.  I emailed the company and they will not respond.  Returning this outfit sadly because it is really cute."
2.0,The band is not really comfortable and it keeps coming apart
2.0,"The size, quality of the materials and overall look is great. What disappoints me the most are the kinks in the necklace due to the way it was packaged on the piece of cardboard. I don't know how to get the kinks out, and for the price I paid for this, I expect it to look perfect the moment I receive it. Now the black necklace part of it doesn't hang in a perfect position due to the kinks in the material. If you know a way to work the kinks out, I'd appreciate it. Otherwise, I'm a little disappointed."
2.0,I machine washed mine and most of the color of the gems washed off. I might has well have just brought a mask with clear gems.
2.0,"These did not fit right, I have athletic/ short legs, im only 4'11, I got my normal size based on reviews when i should have sized up, I dont think that would have helped the fit anyways."
2.0,The dress is beautiful but has a tiny hole in the stitching of the lining.
2.0,The shirt is about two sizes smaller than normal so unlike I did order sizes up. My daughter loves it. I gave it to her she is two sizes smaller than me.
2.0,These run very very small. If buying they fit like little teen sizes. Look good but fit is way off.
2.0,"This dress is adorable. I wanted it to work so bad, but there is glitter on the tutu part of the dress that gets everywhere! It makes the dress useless unless you enjoy cleaning glitter off of everything. Too bad. I’ll have to return the dress."
2.0,"Didn't fit for the size I bought, extremely snug to the point of getting a headache after just a few hours."
2.0,"Fell apart, cute once!"
2.0,"I bought this because it's cheaper and it's the same design of baby bum diaper clutch, unfortunately, the wipe pouch was different then baby bum, Baby Bum pouch is smaller and the opening is at the bottom, so the wipes will be sit at the right spot, and this one's is the same size as the clutch and the opening is at the center which means the wipe will fall down to the bottom! Right now, I just put the entire wipe package in the pouch and that's see if it will keep it moist or not!"
2.0,"The material is thin, so you need to wear something underneath. It's also clingy, so beware of undergarment lines. I love the color, but that's it."
2.0,"I wanted to like these, but the material doesn't feel right. It's too clingy, they almost feel like lounging/PJ shorts. Returning immediately."
2.0,This suit claims to have chlorine resistant color but withing 2 months the back of the swimsuot was faded and the material became very thin.
2.0,Didn't like the length it was too short for me
2.0,"It fits well but it is a burnt orange.  Great for University of Texas fans, but not the bright orange you see in the picture which is what I was going for."
2.0,Odd fitting. I did not wear it.
2.0,Very poor quality.  I donated them to Goodwill.
2.0,Nice piece of jewelry! They should be given to children who are not so curious! The product isn’t that well put together! The slightest thing can cause it to break!
2.0,"They look great just out of the package BUT, while wearing them the very first time they broke.  They use very weak jump rings.  I repaired them but same thing continued to happen.  Terrible."
2.0,Ordered for my 6 year old. It was so small he couldn't hardly get the straps on his ears. More like toddler size. The material is soft and stretchy and would have been comfortable if they fit.
2.0,Too big for a nose ring. Easy return.
2.0,These looked and felt cheap so back they went to Amazon
2.0,"This top is so cute it’s just pretty small. I wore it once, washed it, and now it’s way too small for me to wear. It bummed me out because this top is so cute and warm too. I wouldn’t recommend buying this item :("
2.0,"I will be returning it because it has too many pockets/zippers, which is the problem I have with my current cross-body bag. It's too difficult to find anything."
2.0,I bought 3 and I have chubby fingers. They broke very easily when I tried to adjust them
2.0,"The underwear,, in my manly opinion, ordered boxer briefs, the shorter option men are very short.  So, you will not be showing those off in the locker room. Oh, comfort they are great especially sitting at the conputer all day. Price it is steep; not thinking on ordweing these at price. Lastly, price shop. Again longer ootion."
2.0,I would not order from them again as this is very small and does not fit as expected.  This is made for people without meat on their bones.
2.0,Read small print...you get one!  Very pretty BUT took 3 weeks to arrive.  I've purchased several of these.  The rest are sold in sets.  This was a first for me.  One bracelet and now it's too late for me to order the second one for the event I planned to use them for.  Too long for shipping
2.0,"Cute socks, but thin & small"
2.0,Update: I returned this item about 2 weeks now and I still cant get my refund. I keep calling and hear that its been process and still nothing.<br />It looks like a big red shirt on me. It doesn't have that jacket look. I ordered size xl
2.0,Ugh!!! Too short for me and I bought a LARGE although I normally wear a MEDIUM.  I guess I got what I paid for. JEEZ. You'll never know what to expect with Chinese products!
2.0,was very disappointing
2.0,Not good for big breast
2.0,Too Small for a masculine arm and Black part of bracelet is PLATIC! Cheap and should be sold as female bracelet.
2.0,This watch is a very bright fake gold color. Doesn’t look like it does in pictures
2.0,These are made of inferior steel and are thinner than other stays. They bend incredibly easily and don't retain their shape once bent.
2.0,This belt is short.  I have to really stretch it to get it fastened with enough tail to tuck in the end.  It's also very stiff.  The buckle is quite large which I didn't realize in the photo (my fault) but belt color is accurate.  I'm not pleased but I had to have a belt so keeping it and still shopping.
2.0,"Looks a lot like a bathroom rug. The fur is somewhat stiff. I know it's faux fur, but spend a little bit more and get something a little nicer. This one isn't worth the price."
2.0,My daughter love it howeve i thnk its too expensive for quality
2.0,I ordered a XL and XXL based on the sizing chart.  Neither fit well.  Material is strange and hot but is cute.
2.0,"This was bigger and not exactly as pictured. In the photo, it looks like it has shorts and short sleeves but it was long and you had to fold them up."
2.0,the dress came and looked nice i WAS happy.<br /><br />it did not seem too cheaply made that you couldn't gentle cycle it - well you cant - LESSON LEARNED<br /><br />SO DISAPPOINTING that it unraveled SO much i cant repair it and now can't return since we've used it
2.0,Not really as useful as I thought it would be...
2.0,"Very beautiful dress, but right as I was putting it on like a normal human being, not tugging or being rough at all, the right shoulder strap just broke. Very disappointed. The seller better send me a knew one… Not okay!!!"
2.0,"The product did it's job. Held my watch on my wrist. The fit was weird,  with no middle sizes for inbetween wrists. When working out, i had to adjust for a notch bigger to give way for workout sweating. Ultimately, it wasn't as durable for normal wear and normal working out. I switched to this ban everyday just for working out and the rubber just didn't make it."
2.0,My printed logo turned out fantastic but my mouse pads curl on the edges and make it hard to use. I've had them for a little more then a month and they still haven't flattened out. mouse pads were a little lighter duty then i was expecting but for the quantity and price It was a great deal.
2.0,Material is so bad you might as well make a hoodie out of napkins or toilet paper and still get a better quality compared to this. And torso is way too small which made me feel like i was wearing a crop top!
2.0,"It's made of the same canvas material they make truck seat covers out of. The band rubbed my wrist raw within a day, so I had to return it."
2.0,"I bought a XL it arrived today, but I is<br />TO SMALL!!!  Will not be able to wear it!!! Should put on descriptions<br /> that Tshirt runs extremely small!"
2.0,There are spots on the fingers of the gloves that do not have any protective coating on them
2.0,Fits small. Buttons on the side broke with very little use.
2.0,"Order a size larger than you normally require.  To pocket your devices you will need extra room.  The jacket is attractive, but sadly the second one (replacement due to fit) had to be returned as well.  Broken zipper.  Apparently, I received a return jacket in error.  But I am skeptical about ordering another as I wonder if I will have the same zipper problem."
2.0,Maybe I purchased mine too large but I wear a 40D and have a slimmer waist and got a Large. It was too loose to begin with for slimming or taming muffin top in skinny jeans but after drying it not only got mishapen but it also shrunk up length wise. I will not purchase again.
2.0,"Ordered size 12.5, got size 13.5 & they were too small. For a very narrow foot. Quality looks ok, but returned. Return process was quick & easy."
2.0,"Had potential, but the ruffle part of the dress was too large and see through."
2.0,"Very flimsy material and way too short. If I was 5'7"" they may fit. I'm 6'2"" and larges in other brands fit."
2.0,"This dress is completely see through ( I ordered the apricot) and the arms were shorter than pictured. Returning it. Also, if you have a smaller frame it will look like a sack on you. Very disappointed all around."
2.0,"Horrible, don't buy. The clasp refuses to stay closed and opens up randomly. It's not terrible in terms of comfort but not nearly as comfortable as another brand stainless steel band I had for my old 42mm Garmin (ex: the design causes it to pinch my arm hair, which other brands did not). I did not see another 45mm in this style which is what led me to buy this one but I'm regretting it. Will be returning."
2.0,returned!  couldn't get them on the babies foot at all comfortably
2.0,Fabric is heavy.  Maybe in colder weather it would be okay ... but it is also very stiff.  Pink is louder than comes up in photo.  Not for me.
2.0,Lenses are distorted.
2.0,"Great material, its linen but the size is too small. I bought XL but it more like M"
2.0,This item was too short to be a dress and too long to be shirt. I am 5'2 and weigh 140 pounds this dress hit me at mid thigh. Way to short could not bend over in it. Tried it with leggings to see if it would work as a tunic top and it was too long. This item was sheer and you could see through the fabric. Especially with dark black leggings on underneath.
2.0,This pant size is way too small not a 5x as advertised very dissatisfied and disappointed
2.0,"Robe in the picture is different than actual one, length is above knees as well sleeves just below elbows."
2.0,Not as roomy as all the other colors I bought
2.0,"I have a 6yo and 3yo and these fall off their faces. I have washed on hot hoping to shrink, but they are just too big."
2.0,I was excited about these leggings but they weren’t what I expected. I got a size small but they run big. The ankle area is loose even when you wash them. Not for me.
2.0,"My husband is a very slender man and yet a medium sized vest was too small. He even measured to make sure it matched the recommendations, but still not right fit. We send his vest back!"
2.0,"After month paying $45.00. Ralph Lauren Polo is disgraceful, it developed balls."
2.0,Beautiful dress. Horrible material
2.0,"The white one didn't fit into the shell, the red one did. You can tell they didn't cut the white one precisely. The colors matched despricption. They also added extra pins. (I have no use for them) Will probably get my money back, I wish the white one fit, that's the one I actually wanted"
2.0,purchased for a wedding.  will save and use for a costume.  very low quality.
2.0,The quality is bad
2.0,"Sent a size much larger than what I ordered - I just tossed it in the closet until it fits my kid, but it put me in a bind for our family photoshoot. Too bad, it's super cute"
2.0,"Bag was very cute but very cheap and thin material. I gave this to my daughter this morning and by this afternoon, the string broke and came out. Not fixable and no longer usable. Returning."
2.0,Lens didn’t fit perfect. Kind of loose in the frame.
2.0,"I dislike this pantsuit because the pant legs and crotch is too long. The material is ok for a casual event and it has pockets! It didn't sit properly on me at the crotch and too much material in the belly, hip and leg area. The top fit is ok but overall the pantsuit is too big for me, eventhough i purchased the right size. Unfortunately, I miss the return window so it's sitting on my bed! Waste of money. I got a large; i'm 4'11; 150lbs; 36DD."
2.0,The dragon on these earrings are not as clear in person . In person they were not as impressive.
2.0,Was I a mouse or an elephant? More people told me I was a cute mouse! Lol. The ears were so small. The trunk was tiny and it was hard to breathe while wearing it. I would not recommend this product.
2.0,"Great outside, not good for driving."
2.0,"After only a month or so of wear, the back of the pin came off and I lost the pin.  I was very distressed that I lost it.  I will probably not be buying this pin again because I'm afraid this will happen again. Gosh... it would be so nice if the company sent me a new pin free of charge for this issue, but I doubt that will happen.  Oh well.  Lesson learned.  JLF"
2.0,"I love these!  They’re just the right size for me, not too small like for a child and not too big and look  unproportional for an adult. I have a nickel allergy so it was nice finally finding these as they don’t irritate my ears and they go great with my while pearl tragus earring! Just what I was looking for!<br /><br />Update: the color has completely worn off of one of these, which is weird but although I really lived them, less than a month later, they’re not working any more. Sad about this."
2.0,"I wear a 8 1/2 ,9 So I ordered a 9 . They were a little to small . My toes were a smidge over the edge"
2.0,"Bought this belt to replace my old 2 hole solid leather belt of 2 years that was giving out. Looked great on arrival and worked great, for a bit. I don’t wear my belts really tight, just tight enough to hold my pants, phone, and small multi tool up. The belt has ripped at the hole I use. I know it isn’t a saddle leather grade belt, but I’ve had multiple of these solid leather two hole belts and the average life is well over a year of daily use. This belt has only been used 1-3 times per week for two months because I now work from home and only wear a belt when I leave the house. I am disappointed it failed so quickly. I wanted to contact the seller first to try to resolve this but because I’m beyond the return window Amazon won’t let me."
2.0,"Again, waist way too tight, and legs much too long. Have to give them away if I can find a friend that skinny and tall."
2.0,"I wanted a small purse, but seriously, my cell phone barely fits in this purse.  In the picture it looks like you can put your cell phone in that back pocket ... eeehhh, wrong.  That pocket isn't big enough for a cell phone at all.  It barely is big enough to hold my car keys."
2.0,Too much material.<br />Looks like a (moo moo)<br />Ok
2.0,Came with 2 wholes in the dress.
2.0,Son un poco claros pero bastante buenos hasta ahora. No los he metido al mar.<br />Actualizo: muy bonitos pero oa vision es una mierd.. cansan la vista muchisimo
2.0,"The dress is cute and fit well. However the construction was poorly completed. The stitching is loose, several of the surged edges were sticking out of the seam on the exposed side of the garment and there were 2 pinched seams that I had to take apart and fix myself. Not really worth the money."
2.0,"It glows, but not enough to illuminate the inside of a purse. It sometimes took a few extra shakes to activate it. Returned it."
2.0,The lace isnt very strong to hold up and in big busted women.
2.0,Torture on the feet!
2.0,"Only worth the money if you like fast shipping, but a poorly glued on fake gem that's the same price as a real gem and gem holder necklace. Not to mention a chain that makes your neck green."
2.0,Not the material I expected and not as big as it looks
2.0,"The plastic seems pretty cheap and brittle and the side lenses are a different tint than the front lenses and quite a bit of light gets through the seams, which really aggrevates my eyes. Too dark for night use. Not the worst thing ever... but, meh."
2.0,I was so excited to get these if I ordered a size up I think I would have been okay but I ordered a medium and they were just to small.
2.0,Does not fit as expected. Poor quality
2.0,I ordered 2 sizes larger as the other reviews said. The sleeves were huge and the cut in the back was really high! Super bummed I wanted this to work out.
2.0,Wore them 1 time and they were already gross and turning colors
2.0,It did work at first real good and even if I needed to adjust work perfectly..after two days of wearing it it stops sticking even if  I try cleaning it out no longer sticks.
2.0,"The product is okay for 50 bucks. I should warn those with larger chests. Other comments have mentioned as well, if you’re chest is even slightly on the larger side it’s not going to be that flattering. The cups On This thing are for like A-B cups and I ordered a large. My biggest complaint is the way the fabric is sewn on the cups. It straight up just looks like nipples. The headpiece chin strap came broken. The glove are VERY tight but manageable to put on. Other than that, like I said, it’s fine."
2.0,"I'm returning due to the dress is made extremely large and was like a tent on me and I typically wear sizes 10-12  in dresses and ordered a Medium in this dress and it was huge, and very, very SEE THROUGH and is very long (it was literally on the floor) so unless you are atleast 5'9 or taller it will be dragging on the floor. If i decided to wear I would use as either a cover up on the beach, or a nightgown, I wouldn't wear in public due to it being very see through and way too long."
2.0,Busted after a week - maybe not meant for active walkers?
2.0,"I ordered a 30&#34; chain and was sent a 22&#34; chain.  So I had to scramble and go purchase a chain necklace locally since this was to be a gift.  Also, this chain twists and knots easily.  I would not buy this again.  I am returning it."
2.0,not for wide foot
2.0,"Cute dress, bright colors.<br />But the whole side seam was puckered -- poor construction. So sent it back."
2.0,it is a print. not a tapestry
2.0,The black flower fell off the post after three days. Not very sturdy.
2.0,Too small....sizes run way too small however  the company is very responsive.
2.0,"Very uncomfortable! Also lays very flat, if you want it to have volume you’ll definitely need to add an underskirt or petticoat!"
2.0,"These were cute, I bought 4 for my girls for Christmas.. But the slightest tug And the chains break apart. We Fixed each of them a few times before I gave up."
2.0,"When I ordered these I made sure to order a bigger size, Unfortunately they still didn't fit, I recommend ordering 1- 2 sizes larger than usual. Disappointed in the sizing and how thinly the pants are made."
2.0,Super nice watch.
2.0,"This tie is nice quality, but it is NOT EXTRA LONG.  It is about 4 inches short of that description.  Did not serve my purpose"
2.0,Top is perfect bottoms are too snug.
2.0,"Cute but there’s only a few charms that are ‘tibetan’ 2 peace signs, 2 hamsa hands, 2 I Ching symbols.  The rest are pretty childish & cute for kids only. Also color has tainted within 2 weeks of wear."
2.0,The patterns are cute but the material is thin to the point of being see through and it runs about a size too small.
2.0,"These blouses have poor stitching and the material is like a thin Tee Shirt, they look 'messy' and 'poor quality'"
2.0,Great all around but the snap is very weak. Does not work
2.0,"Loved the print, thought the cap sleeve would be cute, but the frill did not work for me. I think it would be great for a teenager, but it was not for me."
2.0,"Pass it up, doesnt fit well and feels and looks so cheap.  unfortunately I bought two an xl and a xxl both didnt fit a kid that normally wears a mens large, this one was still tight.  It looks so shiny and cheap and fabric is very thin.  A waste of money in my opinion."
2.0,"Worked well until it broke. Rachet lock portion broke and was unable to repair it. Requested for a replacement under their ""100-year warranty policy""  but no response from the vendor."
2.0,"This was tight and thin fabric, so thin that everything shows through. (Unlike some shapers, that help keep things a bit contained, this just seemed to smush everything and show how it had smushed it.)<br /><br />It is not at all what one might expect of a body shaper. It's a super thin fabric -- very stretchy, but thin -- almost like hosiery. While it does shape a little (think the top of control top panty hose), it's not really very shaping, and it's really long, so I ended up with loads of fabric down below my waist. This wasn't really comfortable, but not in a  ""I look great and am shapely"" kind of way. Instead, it was uncomfortable in a ""how am I supposed to wear this"" kind of way.<br /><br />Not a fan.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because it did shape to some degree and it had enough control up top to mostly substitute for a bra, but it's not the bodyshaper that I would be looking for on any given day!"
2.0,"I am sorry to say I have to return this pajama. The product description says the entire pajama (top and bottom) is 60% cotton and 40% polyester; this is a mix which works pretty well for wicking night sweats, and this is what I wanted (as all of a sudden, everywhere--not only on Amazon--99% of pajamas are 100% polyester!!!).<br />But nowhere does the product description mention that the pajama pants are ALL 100% polyester fleece, which I abhor in general, and especially in pajamas. I was very, very disappointed to open up the Amazon package and discover that; I didn't even open up the bag in which the pajama is, so I cannot answer the questions about softness, comfort, stretch, size, etc.<br />Sorry, but a return this is."
2.0,the material is very obviously cheap.
2.0,Extremely painful to wear
2.0,Ordered a XS boys.  I am an adult woman and I wear M/L and the sweatshirt fits me.
2.0,"Bought and gave as gift, but stone fell out after just a few months."
2.0,no the one what i expected. don’t fitting good on me. going to return it.
2.0,I’m so upset with myself because of this purchase. Of course I was expecting a bra in them and absolutely none. I know I know I should have read the description. I never return anything so I’m stuck with them. Maybe my kiddo will want them when she gets older as these are junk to me also they are skin tight so buy a size up for sure
2.0,"This dress is absolutely gorgeous and definitely turns head. I wore it on a night out and received many compliments BUT it is made from a very cheap satin. Unfortunately, I was only able to wear it once, because on this night the strap broke and the satin had many runs in it. I had to trash the entire dress. Hopefully this helps."
2.0,"Terrible quality on the lace. After one wash, started to fall apart. Not appropriate for work wear now. Must use as nightshirt. Inexpensive shirt, inexpensive construction/materials."
2.0,The belt itself is fine.  nice thickness and plenty long.  the buckle though is horrible.  it is impossible to keep it tight with the way the buckle is designed.  I'm looking for an old military clip to replace it.
2.0,It felt like it was made with cheap materials
2.0,"Looks and feels cheap. The material is too clingy to the skin (because it's cheap) and somewhat see-through. I had to wear a slip underneath to be able to use it. The color is also neon-y and cheap looking as a result. Shame, because the fit and comfort was nice."
2.0,These are either too big or too small for my fingers.  Think only one of them actually fits perfect the others fell off or turned upside down and some could not get over my knuckles.
2.0,cheap don't really do much
2.0,Bought the correct size and it was marked as such but way to small.  I use them as rags.. Nice rags but not as under ware.
2.0,"First, let me say that I have purchased-- and love-- MANY Grace Karin products, and will likely continue to do so. Sweaters, dresses, belts, and tops. While an affordable price point, they are usually thoughtfully constructed with nice-feeling material and cute details. Alas, not this dress. The general *style* is as pictured, but the material is something I have never seen in any of their products before. It is a hideous, slightly scratchy cheap poly that one would expect in a witch costume or high school graduation gown. It has the subtle sheen associated with bargain polyester that screams ""I am a cheap dress!"" If this material were the same as their soft, ruched tops, for example, it would be lovely. Instead, it's a shame someone decided to go for the 10 cent bolt of laughably bad costume-grade material."
2.0,Cute but felt like a cheap shower curtain.
2.0,"THE TOP IS STRANGELY ILL FITTING.  IT IS SORTA LOSE AT THE BOTTOM AND IT IS TOO SHORT FOR MY TASTE AS I PREFER MY CROP TOPS TO COME DOWN MUCH LOWER.. EHH, JUST EHH.. WORE ONCE NO PLANS ON WEARING AGAIN"
2.0,Looks nothing like the pic. It’s black. Very disappointed. If color doesn’t matter then it is worth it. Good quality and good fit.<br /> I’m 6’1 195 X LARGE IS A good fit.
2.0,Nice looking watch but fresh batteries should be put in before shipping. I had to have them replaced within a month
2.0,I was pretty but the fabric was thin. I usually wear a 12. But got the large. It was tight .
2.0,all the pieces fell apart of the buckle - piece of junk - I hope its not a real swatch if it is their product has gone down the tubes - I have perfectly good ones still working from the eighties - this lasted a month before I couldn't buckle it and the battery ran out in a few months - piece of junk
2.0,"Sorry to say it, but I can't take a leak in these things without the very onerous tasks of undoing my belt, unbuttoning my pants, and then pulling both my pants and underwear down a little bit.  And all this increases the risk of getting my belt against a public urinal.  I have to start looking at things closer before ordering them.<br /><br />Take this with a grain of salt because otherwise these are quite comfortable.  But you need to know what you are (not) getting."
2.0,"Too long for my smallish female wrist. I would have to wrap the entire thing all the way back around to wear it, which makes it very chunky and inelegant."
2.0,It's a cute dress but the fabric was very thin and unforgiving.
2.0,Ouch!! Very painful!  I could only wear it for a few hours.
2.0,"This watch band is pretty heavy. It adds a lot of weight to your watch. It's extremely difficult to get the pins in since it doesn't have the standard quick release. The tool is helpful, but it took two people who got pretty frustrated with it. Once it is on, it's not as easy to change the fit as some of the other bands are. I found it was either too tight or too loose most of the time. The worst part is that the clasp gave out about a month after using it daily. It wouldn't stay latched and it fell off repeatedly. My watch face now has several scratches on the front from falling off and landing on things. The final straw was when it fell face first on the tile floor of our kitchen. The screen did not shatter, but I saw that a few other buyers posted here that their watch screen DID shatter. I stopped wearing my watch until I could replace the band. Very sad about the quality."
2.0,I haven’t washed it yet and the hem is coming out. Also noticed the tag says you can not put it in the dryer. Not happy at all about that.
2.0,Came missing the binocular tether and barely fit my Vortex Vulture HD 15x56.  I am a big guy 6”2” 290 and the straps barely fit around my chest.
2.0,"It is a nice product and I received it on time, but the first day I received it, the zipper fly of the left side was damage. What a disappoinment."
2.0,"The shirt material and feel is great!  It fits nice, too!  However, the screen print is like 2 inches to the right.  Too much trouble to return it so I will deal... but it's so obviously not centered so should have been caught by the maker."
2.0,Very cheap thin material. Disappointed in quality.
2.0,"Stitching bunches the cloth - half mesh cloth, then part of the scarf is a pseudo-silk.  The photo was so much more lovely."
2.0,"If you are buying these for work pants and your job entails a lot of moving or lifting, fair warning they wear and tear easily."
2.0,this strap is made out of hard material and it cuts into your body.<br /><br />not recommend unless you like to bleed a little while you play
2.0,The shirt was too wide and too short. I would rather have a longer shirt that does not show my stomach when I lift my arms but had I gotta larger size it would have been even wider. It was just a weird fit so I had to return.
2.0,"Good bag, looks strong, except the seams don't hold up! The middle size came with a big slit in one of the sides and basically not usable."
2.0,Had to return because the size does not fit correctly
2.0,El vestido viene de tal forma como esta en la foto solo k la talla recomendado no es la mejor yo usualmente uso talla l y encarte talla l pero viene muy grande y rabón
2.0,Bent the first time it was worn. About to break so not even wearing it a third time.
2.0,The  tank tops are cute and comfortable But they offer zero compression if you are looking for a regular tank top then go for these but don’t expect any compression whatsoever
2.0,"I may be a perfectionist but these don’t close straight on, it’s a teeny bit shifted.  I don’t see them lasting long either."
2.0,"These are super flimsy and thin. The Fire Chief stickers are crooked. Okay for cheap party favors, but get something else if you want it to last."
2.0,Cheap and poor quality
2.0,Super cheaply made. Not sure it will last. Upper is foam.
2.0,"Really liked the hat, was perfect dark blue and super soft material. The first time I washed it, it faded out to a near demon color. Very disappointed to see the color fade like this, but I liked the hat enough, I may just buy another one and never wash it."
2.0,"This jumper is cute on, but it is flimsy. The material is very chintzy. Even after ironing it over and over again, it stays wrinkled. It is also pretty see-through, even with the additional shorts liner inside. It looked fine on (and it *is* comfy), but it is poor quality. For it's quality, it would only really be worth, possibly, a bathing suit coverup, but barely that. Also, because of the material, the straps do not stay tied. I ended up wearing a hoodie over it most of the day because it kept falling off my chest and leaving my bra cups exposed."
2.0,"Too small, also in the picture it looks like it has a white screen behind the mouth, but it does not."
2.0,Fits at breast but loose at waist
2.0,"These were marked as the same size. I checked the tags. One was huge. Probably a 7 or 8. The other was small, a 3 or 4. Both were marked size 4.  The smaller might fit. This was a gift. Disappointed."
2.0,"VERY heavy and arrived with one of the back pins already broken off, so that earring is completely unwearable. Even if it were wearable, however, these earrings are crazy dense and so heavy."
2.0,The package says &#34;one pair&#34; but there is one asymetrical piece. description is not clear.  Either one piece is missing or there should be instructions that says it needs to be cut--even though there is no way to cut it into two matching pieces.
2.0,It is very sheer and very see through.. do not get the white h less you are using it for the bedroom. I put it on and you could see EVERYTHING. I’m returning it.
2.0,My boobs squeeze out the sides and I'm a B cup...
2.0,I really didn’t like this.  I thought it was thin.  I hated to have to squeeze putting it on.  It would ruin any hair style.  Yuck
2.0,How does anyone put this on???  The criss cross in back means you can't latch it in front and then spin it around...you need to try to be double jointed and latch it behind you.<br /><br />What a truly stupid bra.
2.0,"this wouldn't fit me or any adult, I gave it to my friend to use for her 6 year old daughter!!"
2.0,Beautiful lace looked great
2.0,These are very small and obviously for children. Do NOT buy these if they are to be used by an adult with a normal-sized head.
2.0,These headbands are advertised as being &#34;perfect for newborns&#34;.  They were too large for my daughter's head and she is 3 months old and has a head in the 75th percentile.  They are cute but definitely for toddlers or girls.
2.0,"It’s pretty sheer and it was short, like can’t lift my arm up or people will see some things short. And when I did lift my arms the top part of the dress rises over the belt, so I would have to pull it back down."
2.0,The glasses are fragile but the frame is good
2.0,Gave it away as it was to small for me.  Also could've returned but it would have cost more than the dress to ship it back!
2.0,Had to be remade to fit.
2.0,Lil stage like for costume not so much normal wear
2.0,It is too large
2.0,The first one showed up with a stain on it. The second one showed up with a printing defect.
2.0,"The decal is shiny and looks super cheap. The color is way off, the horse looks almost white. When compared to the photo I guess the decal is the same size but it just looks ridiculously tiny. You can only read it up close. I bought for my secret Santa at work so no time to return. Oh well. Would not recommend to anyone."
2.0,Decent look and seems to be put together fairly well but can't really test it out as it is much too small.
2.0,"So many pieces that you have to put together before placing on shoe. Pretty pieces, just make sure you’re free that day… you’re gonna need the time & patience!"
2.0,I ordered my normal size but it’s too big in crotch area.
2.0,Very tight and the material is a little see-through.
2.0,This latex mask just doesn’t have the quality that Doom would expect. The strap is secured well so that’s a plus. But it looks terrible when worn. How can I hide my scarred face with this??
2.0,The band strips easily.
2.0,4 stones have come out of one side and 6 out of the other... Frusterated
2.0,These are pretty but incredibly hard to open/close as is. Will be sending back. Too bad; disappointing.
2.0,Doesn't fit well and not comfortable
2.0,"This product is easy to put together but even when its finished, it dosnt sit quite right.  Also, it smell gross like metal and makes my jewelry smell like that too.  I would not recommend this holder."
2.0,Sizing is greatly off standard fit.
2.0,I wish they were a bit longer in length.
2.0,"Lots of LOOSE strings, but cute enough for the price."
2.0,"The smell killed me! Wow!<br />My disappointment is not in the quality of the product, it is worth the $$ by any means. My disappointment comes from the size. While this tends to be the normal, it sure would be nice to have a brief case that I can stack 8.5 x 11 paper side by side. As it sits at the moment, I can only get a single stack which makes for a unique situation.<br />Other than the aforementioned, the quality is very good & it is well constructed. the one I received had no marks or defects of any kind. After putting it in the garage for a few days to air out, I would not hesitate buying again & I may just do so (keep all my important paperwork together).<br /><br />Update: the inside lining fell apart & will require re-gluing."
2.0,Not great quality and see through
2.0,The seam in the forearm was not sewed together.  Therefore there is a hole the length of the forearm in the left sleeve.  I love the shirt but was extremely disappointed for the price verses quality.
2.0,"I ordered these as a back up pair of shades for the boat. I am not too impressed as I ordered the purple lens and I was shipped blue.<br />The overall fit is small, almost like they are children's glasses? Not too impressed, but cant expect much for $10."
2.0,"Super see through, had to return it"
2.0,algo chico
2.0,"Fits my 5 year-old, so not an adult size. Arrived and did not have the black ribbon."
2.0,the package is a plastic bag..looks cheap for the price
2.0,"First, it's not inexpensive glove and therefore my expectation was proportionally high to it’s the price.<br /><br />Pros: Warm<br />  Waterproof(but not on a heavy rain day)<br /><br />Cons: Bulky<br />  Touch screen not working at all after using it once on a rainy day."
2.0,"Comes with a hole on the inside fabric where they had to fill it full of holes to put tags and such on it. As it goes holes in thin wool develop quickly into larger ones. But its good the got their tags on there, bad for the end user when the hole gets bigger and bigger. Is nice and thin to go under a bike helmet though."
2.0,"I'm writing exactly the same review as I wrote for another belt with the same type of buckle (teeth on the buckle hold it to the leather) because it has exactly the same problem.<br />The teeth in the buckle that bite into the belt aren't keeping the buckle in place. After wearing the belt a few times, one of the buckle's teeth inevitably pulls and stretches the hole it first made, the buckle twists, and a little bit of the belt needs to be cut off, and the buckle put on again. Guess what? It happens again... and again... and again."
2.0,Came apart after 6 months<br />And company won't return!!
2.0,They are nice to look at but not properly made.
2.0,"I love the look and the inscription of the locket, but it keeps coming open while I'm wearing it. I wish it had a magnetic or snap closure so it would stay closed."
2.0,Size runs big ordered a size large it’s way bigger diameter about the size of an extra large .  But it’s only the length of a of a blouse or a shirt  .  It would probably only reach the length of your wrist .
2.0,I really liked this belly button ring but I've had it for maybe 3 months and it's completely tarnished which means it must not be surgical steel like it stated. Super bummed cause I'm already not able to wear it it looks cheap!
2.0,"Poorly made and terrible fit. Too short in the back, and rouched in the back so it can’t be pulled down. Too loose in the top. Very strange and terrible fit."
2.0,Sweating.  Works well where placed.
2.0,I did not like the quality of the top. The material is see through and very thin. You would have to wear something underneath. Sleeves seam is a simple hemstich. I will not be wearing the top and would not recommend.
2.0,"The robe I received was several inches longer than the measurements given on the product page -- I'm 5'6&#34;, and the front hem brushes my feet. The inside lining is also much rougher on the skin than expected, almost like a stiff towel -- definitely not &#34;luxurious.&#34;<br /><br />I wish the inside had the same texture as the outside, and hope it will soften after several washes. But as it is, it looks better than it fits or feels."
2.0,"The bag was stiff and bulky, returned the item"
2.0,They definitely did not fit as expected. They are a very thin material and I will probably just sleep in them instead of wearing them to the gym.
2.0,"Loved it until it broke after 3 weeks. I only wore it during the day, and I have an office job so it's not like I abused it or anything. Just came apart when I was putting it on one morning. 😞"
2.0,Wore once....just laying around the house (not exercising). Washed them and there’s a hole in the the seam already!  Not able to return them bc they have been worn once!! Very unhappy with this product!  Will not order them again especially for the price!!! Only plus side is they fit well and are comfortable.
2.0,I liked the color which is why I bought them. But unfortunately they are not really women’s size. I have an average sized hand and these are way too short for my fingers.
2.0,Didn't do it's job.
2.0,"hope the other order is better than this, I would not order this again"
2.0,"I bought these for metal detecting and magnet fishing.  They were absolutely great, until about the 10th use...  something has happened and the rubber coating is getting sticky, and they make my hands smell quite badly.  Like that smell of someone who hasn’t showered in two weeks mixed with the smell your skin has after taking off a bandaid you’ve had on for a week.  They smell like dirty butt!!  It’s horrible. I even threw them in the wash. It’s just as bad! I could understand after a year or two,  but... four months? Of very sporadic use????  Nope."
2.0,"the hat is white on the underside. the sizing chart is way off for us sizes just go by your normal tee shirt size.<br />gloves come to wrist and are stretchy nylon type. neck and head are not covered. mask is a joke, spend a little more and get a better costume."
2.0,This product runs small.  I would order up a size maybe even two.  The quality seams to be good but it hasn't been worn or washed because it is to small.
2.0,After reading reviews of others I purchased these glasses. Some remarked how the frame and glass was wide enough for a person with a full face. I found this to be untrue as I have a full face. They are not a bad pair of sunglass but not for me. These glasses are better suited to women or men with a narrow front face.
2.0,Asian sized. Small is very small. Debated ordering a larger size but pattern and quality looks much better online than in reality.
2.0,Not flattering.  Good idea poor execution of design
2.0,"I am 5’9 150 and new the large I would be swimming in the chest! So I went with a medium. The torso is not meant for tall persons and it will slid up your back side. Logo is not white. It’s a faded white, almost grey. Even though the bodice fits nice, the straps on the shoulders are loose. I was most disappointed with the belt. The company let a defect go by and my belt as you can see in the pictures has to be twisted to be worn the correct way. Hoping they reach out and can send a new belt!"
2.0,"I’m 5’9 110lbs, ordered this set in brown small the joggers were too short so I exchanged them for a medium which was loose on me but worth it for the additional 1 and 3/4” length increase however when I ordered the set in cream the medium joggers were an entirely different length. They measured about 1 and 3/4” shorter than the brown medium joggers. Maybe I got a defective pair? I returned them and ordered another cream medium joggers, will update my post if the length is still inconsistent."
2.0,"I bought a very similar-looking pair of sunglasses on Amazon for the same price and they were fantastic. Nice visibility, good sun protection, and sturdy. When I lost them, I bought this pair, hoping for similar quality. However, these glasses are overly dark and provide poor visibility in both bright and shady conditions. They also glare extensively whenever the sun is out, making it even harder to see. While I think it's possible to find great sunglasses at this low price, these are not worth it."
2.0,Cute but the straps are made of a terrible material. Don’t stay in face no matter how much you tie and adjust. Don’t buy.
2.0,"Cheap looking, mirrored, flimsy. Returned them.  I gave the Randolph Aviators in gunmetal and they are high quality.  Not sure how these turned out so crappy."
2.0,Was way too small and itchy
2.0,Runs too small and was more of an off white color
2.0,"This case is way to big in all dimensions for my prescription reading glasses, which are not particularly small. The case has absolutely no padding so the glasses clunk around and rattle loudly whenever the case moves. Won't be using it, unfortunately."
2.0,I was looking forward to using this but it arrived damaged.
2.0,"At first it fitted pretty good until I started to sit down or squat, i really felt the tightness in the pants. It's elastic in the waistline but not everywhere else."
2.0,Was missing the charms. Also it's just a bunch of cheap plastic bracelets. Not one bracelet.
2.0,The dress looked cute in the pictures but when I got it looked super tacky and the embroidery was coming undone. The colors on the embroidery are super bright too. Not at all like the picture. I ended up returning it.
2.0,"The watch seemed to be of good quality except for the fact that the face was tilted with respect to the window, which is especially annoying for a square watch. I had to return it."
2.0,"It is not as thick as I thought it was... but the quality seems ok. The packing should be better, a white box is not that great. Amazon collection has better packing than this one and the jewelry is sometimes cheaper than this."
2.0,I should have read the dimensions before I ordered these. They're long and narrow. I wanted them to put produce scraps in. I have to use a 1 quart soup container. Ordering bigger wider ones for next time.
2.0,It is too small even though I ordered one size larger I am size 8/10 and I ordered 12 still too small. The material is too thin so i am returning it.
2.0,Same look as the picture but different material. The links are much larger. Would not purchase any others. Worth a try though.
2.0,The metal was weak and does not hold it's shape very well
2.0,Im 5 ft 10in 175lbs and the small is baggy on me. These are not a fitted style shirt.
2.0,"I ordered this because I thought these type of belts were all the same - they aren't.  This one is quite a bit larger than the brand the I do like (murino - my spelling might be off).  this buckle was actually very uncomfortable to wear when sitting (driving, desk, etc..) - the edges and corners dig into your stomach and actually it's painful... weird because the smaller murino buckles ( I have two of them) don't...  so if youre like me and have a tummy that will rest on the edge of the buckle, I'd go with another product."
2.0,Waste of money battery does not hold charge
2.0,Material was nice but runs small. Returned
2.0,I am missing the rose gold and gold Alphabet letters..  product came on time just missing items
2.0,Because they where medium but fit like extra large I figured the would fit perfect. They kept sliding off my hand
2.0,"These frames are well designed,  but they didn't fit me well. I gave it 2 start not because of it's designed, but because the fit. Delivery was very quick."
2.0,"great feel, REALLY small. boo hoo."
2.0,"The dress was super cute! ...but not to be worn out of the house, as you can see right through the material. Returned :("
2.0,Joke
2.0,Does not fit as expected. Also collar tag was ripped out when I went to check the size. For what reason don't know
2.0,Two pairs were damage
2.0,Item said order 2 sizes up to fit and it was wayyy to big definitely fits true to size don’t believe the suggested size
2.0,"These stretch out while you're wearing them, they aren't black, they already have holes in them and they get pilly. They came very late and are not good quality at all. I shouldn't have trusted the reviews on these and most were bought at a discount"
2.0,"The skirt was not what I was expecting.  The options for reviewing this item does not clearly reflect what I thought when I tried on the skit.  It fit; however, it was not the fit that I was looking for.  The material is super flimsy which too away from the appearance of the skirt.  The color was stated as beige; but it looked more of a yellowish color.  Overall, it was not flattering; therefore, I returned the item."
2.0,"Cheap looking, worse than a Walmart pair."
2.0,Cute vest but zipper gets stuck a lot.
2.0,"I was pleasantly surprised when I opened these. You get five large sturdy durable bags with thick plastic bottom inserts. These bags will last, as will the bottom inserts. Most bag inserts crack and are soon thrown out but these should last.<br /><br />And they all fold neatly into a sturdy carrying case.<br /><br />Editing to add: When I purchased these in November they were $12.99 with no shipping fee. Now they're much more expensive. I can't really recommend them for nearly $50 plus shipping!"
2.0,"These are cute, I got them in denim gray. BUT they were small even though I chose a size up. I gave the previous pair away even though they were supposed to be my size. Cutting my losses at this point."
2.0,I ordered a size XL and received what looks like a size M. Have had the same problem with the nautical tee shirts I have received also. Very disappointed. Baffled by the bright bow on the back. Makes it look childish.
2.0,"Really cute and fit well, rated 2 stars because one of the top buttons fell off one of the straps after one wear."
2.0,The shorts ripped easily.
2.0,Unfortunately I only put this on my baby for a few hours. It's not comfortable and cheaply made.
2.0,"These are so tight, they barely fit over my head. I need to fold the mask underneath at the bottom because it is so long it bunches all up at the neck. Once it’s on, it doesn’t stay up over the nose which is surprising because of how tight it is to get over the head."
2.0,"Haven't tried them on yet. Out of the packaging, these are definitely not as described. They have a sparkly bow and that's a no no for us. It also has loose threads. I don't think they'll last with this poor quality. They're going back"
2.0,Decal wrinkled and faded. Material is not the best quality for price.
2.0,I didnt care for it. It was to big when I recieved it and it wasnt what I was expecting it to be like.
2.0,"I loved the fit and flexibility of this shoe, unfortunately we were not able to use them as on of them came with half the sole missing."
2.0,"At first, I thought these were great. Comfortable and super warm. Now...I’m sorry I purchased FXR boots, & don’t intend to do so in the future. One of the boots leaks so badly through the toe area that these boots are now unwearable. A lot of money for very little use out of them."
2.0,"Material was very red, felt stiff and rough. Returned item"
2.0,"It's very comfortable and the fabric is nice, but the fit is terrible. Wouldn't wear it on the street, and not even on the beach as a coverup. A nightgown maybe. The neckline is nice and flattering but the pockets create bumps on the sides that are extremely unflattering (makes me look 3 sizes bigger). Basically, it only looks nice with my hands in the pockets, so not very practical... Returned it."
2.0,"I was excited to get this necklace (also ordered the &#34;matching&#34; bracelet) and was disappointed that it doesn't look like the picture. This isn't as bad as their &#34;matching bracelet&#34; but I was still disappointed in what I received versus the photos and description! If you want something to wear once and junk then full speed ahead but by the look and feel of it I doubt it'll last longer than that! Such a waste of money, luckily it's cheap enough that one or maybe two wears will make it worth it."
2.0,"This bra is very well made, but not proportionate at all. I normally wear a 1-2X, based on the reviews, I ordered a 3x. It was very tight, cups were too small and it created a horrible pancake effect. Way too tight and too much padding with the pads in. Still too tight and uncomfortable with the pads out. This bra covers a large surface area without providing comfort or ample cup room. It is well made if you are on the smaller cup size and want a ton of coverage. I have a request for return in."
2.0,"very disappointed in  the rings, they faded after a few days wear, I knew they were adjustable when I ordered them but they were even to big for my fingers and they were suppose to be midi rings. sorry for the low review"
2.0,The layers aren’t as long as the picture shows. Pretty bad packaging job because the tutu is seriously mangled whilest brand new
2.0,"The top I received was not true to color. It looked more like pink and blue tie die. And with it being too large, reminded me of a night shirt"
2.0,Compared to the same size of other panties they run small
2.0,This set is not good at all... The wheel will fall off when you least expect it..
2.0,I got size 12/13 for my daughter and these are way too tight/narrow. She can barely put her feet in and doesn’t want to wear them because they are uncomfortable.
2.0,Its a good looking bag but it was to big and it had a scratch on it. Im usually a Dasein bag fan but the material felt really cheap.
2.0,"I didn't received the colors that were displayed in the picture.  I received 3 black, dark grey, light grey and a burgundy."
2.0,Broke the moment  took it out of package
2.0,"4 out of the 5 were alright, they were sturdy and I love the design. But the 5th one, I couldn’t get the tag out, it was like it was melted to the plastic and it smelled like dog pee or something. Whatever the smells was, it was terrible!"
2.0,"It's a beautiful dress, good material, but it runs small. Definitely 1 size up is needed, maybe 2."
2.0,The pants are way to long and I don’t like the material
2.0,This girl run small but the problem was that the lining of the skirt is sewthat in the back that it's messed up it's a beautiful color but it runs small and the sewing is defective
2.0,Cheap and the back kept falling off
2.0,thanks for the deal
2.0,These glasses are alright. The frame runs a bit small... and I received them with a scratch on one of the lenses.
2.0,I purchased a small thinking I would want it to be snug so I could wear without a bra- I am a thin woman and the arms were pretty tight on me. That being said- the texture/glitter of the fabric that I purchased being that tight against my arms makes it pretty unbearable to wear for more than a few hours.
2.0,"This dress is made kind of similar quality to a kids Halloween costume. It’s entirely see through, has a wonky hem and seams. Hooks for the straps are poorly placed and pop off revealing side boob. Also you may not be happy with the open back if you have love handles. I ordered a large, I’m 5’1” 150 lbs and 32DD, it mostly fits but is a tiny bit loose on top. Overall it’s a cute design, but you may not like it if you are tall or overweight."
2.0,Its a nice warm fleece material. The quality seems good. But this is not the one I ordered. Debating returning it doesn't match the beanie I got for my son but we are days away from the trip we are making to Great Lakes Illinois for my husbands graduation not sure if I have enough time to deal with this.
2.0,"Ran very tiny, even for my 13 year old"
2.0,This item ran small and was not quality fabric. I guess you get what you pay for!
2.0,"On the model it looks like it flows around your curves.  In reality it is about as wide as it is long (or so it seemed to me when I tried it on).  This might be ok if you are a cube masquerading as an adult female homo sapiens .  it did not look ok on my hourglass-leaning-toward-pear figure. Also the neck opening becomes a slit, not a V, when you try it on.<br />I give two stars because I can imagine that maybe *someone* might have a body this works for .  After all, I think Earth's population just hit 7 billion. And the stitching seemed ok."
2.0,"Let me start with what I like about the bracelet. First, I love the simplicity and the deep meaning of the bracelet. Once you open the box, it comes in, and it talks about creating positive intentions while putting on the bracelet and giving you a background of the meaning of the red string bracelet. I have been through a lot lately, and I liked the idea of creating positivity, healing, and fulfillment. Second, I liked the red color of the bracelet, the heart, and the simple stone that accents it because when it catches the light, it shines.<br /><br />I am giving it two stars for the price point, and I think there should be a lot more adjustability to the bracelet. You can tell from the photos that it is a simple bracelet, and you know what you are expecting upon arrival. However, it is very limiting on how small it will adjust to. I have provided photos of how loose it hangs off my wrist to the point where it becomes awkward. I debated on even tying a rubber band around it to make it smaller. However, that is not something I should be debating for a product at this price point.<br /><br />It is simple, cute, and dainty, but the limited adjustment to sizing makes it a 2 star for me."
2.0,"Saw this sweater and thought....hum, should I.  So I did.  I wear a size 14 so because of the reviews I ordered an XXL thinking it would work.  NOPE.  The XXL was more like a size 10 I ended up giving it to my 21 year old niece who's a size 8, she likes it."
2.0,I love it it’s so cute but I can’t get the ball off for the life of me to put it in.
2.0,"I am on a mission to find underwear I like. Unfortunately, these aren’t it. I am a good 15 lbs heavier than I am used to a couple years post baby, and I just can’t understand why there isn’t underwear that isn’t so snug around the waistband that it creates a muffin top or isn’t so loose that it falls off. The plus about this underwear is that it is returnable (but also, who is getting the underwear I tried on and sent back...). But too snug. Uncomfortable. Maybe this fits someone well with 4% body fat (as a reference I’m a size 8/10, not someone who is considered medically overweight)."
2.0,"I bought what I thought was a 7.5 but when I put them in my shoes & put my shoes on I can feel the inside edges of the toe area of insole. I checked the insoles & they are too small for my shoe. I checked the pkg & it says they sent me what I meant to order (7.5), but the insole slides to the back heel of the shoe as I walk around which causes my foot to not be situated evenly on the insole & my big toe rubs on the inside of the shoe. I'll be returning them."
2.0,"The goggles fit well and were comfortable, but the strap broke after the second time wearing them.  I could understand if they sat out in the sun all summer, but it was day two of using them.  I'd recommend spending a few more dollars and getting a higher quality pair.  These come in a two pack and the second pair has held up so far."
2.0,"The top ran small but the main problem was no back part to the bra so nothing stayed in place. The bottom, however, fit beautifully."
2.0,The size for a child and it stinks really bad
2.0,do not like performance and fabric
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress!  I first ordered it in olive green, however it had holes in seams.  I returned that one decided to try the burgundy color.  The color is not burgundy it is red and the fit is not the same as the olive green dress.  I have decided that this dress is not for me, I will be returning it."
2.0,"The shirt fit well and is nice looking but snags too easily. Ruined it before I even got on the trail. I think this shirt is more for casual wear, definitely not for trail riding.  Expensive lesson learned."
2.0,"This skirt fit well, but I didn't like the fabric. It felt more like a heavy shower curtain than a skirt, and it is a heavier weight than I expected. I'm very disappointed with this purchase."
2.0,"Very flimsy, they do not hold straight up."
2.0,"I was shopping specifically for Wonder Wallet insert replacements... these came up, but don't fit in Wallet... horizontal backing instead of parallel backing. Business Card protectors open on wrong side."
2.0,"No doubt, this is built reasonably well - esp. given the low price you pay (It does not entirely eliminate glare, but significantly reduces). I specifically ordered one with a brown colored lens, but was sent one with a dark blueish gray color. I contacted the seller and s/he was very prompt to follow up. The seller informed me this is how their brown lens would look like. The level of dimness does not suit me personally; rather than returning, I am going to keep this anyway to gift someone."
2.0,Slit is super high on thigh! Material is very shimmery. Quality is as expected for price.
2.0,they broke after about one week. Ill never buy from your company again
2.0,"Unfortunately, I lost track of these and cannot return them. They are way too small. I can't get them past my knees! Not happy."
2.0,Not as cute as I thought they would be and not very comfy.
2.0,"Its a lovely dress. Well made. Didnt do any custom fit, though, so the straps were too long and the dress way way too long. Was worried about ship time but came a week earlier than expected.<br />The downside is- yes, you can return it. However it costs as much to return as the dress cost originally."
2.0,Product was thin and sharp. Must contain a lot of nickel too. The stone was not Mother of Pearl but something clear. They were a last minute Christmas order so I kept them but will not purchase from this designer again.
2.0,It came and was pretty cute. It was a gift for my daughter. It did not last but a month before the strand with the charm came off. I was a bit disappointed.
2.0,"I bought this dress for the Halloween Party. The dress made out of the cheap material. Runs small. Plus this dress is super itchy. I wanted to return it, but it said that dress wasn’t eligible for returns."
2.0,"Glasses seem cheap and ridiculously large. They area much larger than they seem in picture.  I would not recommend buying these, even for the price."
2.0,Really surprised at this dress. I read slot of good reviews but didn't like the fit. Not what I expected. Even one of thepockets had a whole in it. I waited over a month for this dress to arrive. Size wasn't accurate though
2.0,Ordered a plus-size and it was so small my granddaughter couldn’t wear it. Granted it comes from China so beware about sizing as it is not USA sizes!
2.0,"I ordered this in gold and what I got was almost orange. Not a pretty color and certainly not what I expected from the picture. The wrap in the picture seems to have a very bright light shining on it, which makes it misleading."
2.0,Despite the supposed non slip technology THEY DO NOT STAY UP!  Reason I tried these the reinforcement on the toes. But no show sock for my booties and tennis shoes big big fail!! Please don’t waste your money!!
2.0,"Not very comfortable at all for a 5'7&#34; female with a small frame. I like that I can fit a lot of stuff in it, but adding any weight leaves bruises on my hips and lower back due to the lack of cushion."
2.0,"Too tight on the arms and butt super uncomfortable. Belt fell apart in seconds , should have been cheaper for the quality ."
2.0,I had high expectations....this is a flimsy product. Best thing is the color...This is not worth the price.
2.0,Very big and I did not like the material or the color.
2.0,Feels a little itchy and cheap
2.0,Looses a minuite a day. What good is a watch that doesnt keep proper time.
2.0,"Looks nice on a medium to large wrist. It's a bit big and clunky looking for my wrist. After a few weeks, one stone fell out and the silver color started to turn brown/rose gold color. I do wear it in the shower everyday, so perhaps that's the reason for the discoloration."
2.0,"They are not long enough, always falling off, undoing them self's"
2.0,"I bought these pants so that I could hike in the fall and winter stay warm and dry. The pants look nice they fit nice they feel nice. However, they are not waterproof by any stretch of the imagination. The zipper broke after a couple months so if you're looking for waterproof durable hiking pants these aren't them."
2.0,"I typically order an x-small, which was too tight in this case. I'm 5'6&#34;, 125 lbs, size 2-4. I ordered this as the next size up and it was not flattering at all. Bagged in weird places and generally unflattering. The X-small was too form-fitting for the office, but still fit in the right places, if you know what I mean."
2.0,much too big
2.0,"Was tight around thighs and very loose and unflattering around stomach area. Within two days of wearing mine, the seems from the inner thighs became loose and holey. Considering the fact that I payed 3x more for a SkylineWears adult onesie more than any other and it got &#34;worn out&#34; within 3 days, I wasn't too happy about it."
2.0,Loved the bracelet . Took it off one night and the bracelet broke and beads went everywhere.  The string broke not sure how after less than two months
2.0,"These are absolutely adorable, and my daughter loves them - but they smell terrible - a STRONG odor of kerosene or some kind of fuel.  We left them outside for days - it didn't help.  Her teacher asked that she not wear them anymore because the odor is so strong it bothers the other children. The smell is so bad that we can't even keep them in the house and store them in the basement.  If it weren't for the smell I'd give them 5 stars.  I'm not sure if we just have a bad pair or if they're all like this. I hope not!"
2.0,I bought it this last year and it was amazing and this year the material is quite different and not fit as usual. I am wondering why??
2.0,"This looked great when it arrived. Thin material, but its a nice color. After 3 washings, the graphics are already peeling off. Don’t waste your money on it."
2.0,"I expected these to fit to the ankles like in the advertisement picture not mid-calf, I consider this false advertisement"
2.0,My shoes size is a 10 and I got  extra large . Still not large enough.
2.0,"The fingers were way too long, and the thumb was really wide. I had to cut everything down, and re sew it. Very awkward looking. I bought this for my 10 year old son. He would be considered teenager/small adult size. It fit my hand weird too though. It worked for the costume, but it wasn't great."
2.0,I am  disappointed because the product does not look the same as shown...The waist band is quite narrow and it much less material as shown in advertisement.
2.0,I ordered a large and it was true to size and roomy. But I was very disappointed with the graphic on the shirt. It's not anywhere near as detailed as the what's shown. There's no color in the cheeks and the eyes are just dead looking black holes. Just a blob of green.
2.0,The clips lost their holding power in 10 months.  They would come undone during the day at work.  The clips are not particularly comfortable either.
2.0,"The plug backs got stuck, so the earrings got stuck in my ears. I had to break them to get them out"
2.0,Far too small. I went one size up and it was still too tight so get two sizes larger when you order.
2.0,"Pros: pretty, rubber hasn't stained yet (2 month use), useful to know tides when in the water<br />Cons: only iOS information sync, dial info is TOO small to really read, the light is useless at night (I just turn my phone's lamp and shine it on the screen), all tracking of waves is done MANUALLY (Start/Stop). Wouldn't buy again."
2.0,Purchased these for 6 & 7 year olds to wear for a stage production.  The elastic was too small for their fingers.  We attached them to headbands and shoelaces instead.  Not sure I would purchase these again although the colors were bright and fun. A few of the lights wouldn't turn on.
2.0,Don't wasting your money!
2.0,I ordered a 2x but those fit my niece whom wear a size 7/8 which is a medium
2.0,too expensive
2.0,Too tight on arms
2.0,returned because was white and cr&egrave;me color....didn't like..wanted gray and taupe
2.0,Love the earrings post is broken though
2.0,It was small and miss shaped.<br />Could find better at a dollar store
2.0,Itchy material. It looks way different from the picture :(
2.0,Very disappointed with product
2.0,nice shoe however runs a good size to big sending back
2.0,"Purchased for my sons military ball, needed something ASAP. Material was cheap, ripped with taking it off. I was not able to wear it, now sitting in my closet."
2.0,What you see is not what you get. The material is a slippery polyester type fabric that stays super staticky with the design printed on one side and white on the other.
2.0,"The gloves are nice on the outside; however, after only 3 months use, the lining is shredding.<br />I should have looked for thinsulate lining."
2.0,"Pros- holds oil well and love design and multiple bracelets, lovely touchstone for anxiety<br />Cons- cheap elastic and fell apart in a week<br /><br />I bought these bracelts in hopes of giving them as gifts to friends. I don't take them off hardly at all but the more you take on and off. The weaker the elastic becomes and eventually flew off my wrist and beads rolled everywhere.  Maybe consider using cord with drawstrings. The few that haven't broken are on the way out. Trying to be delicate about taking on and off. Can not share with friends as they're not sturdy."
2.0,"These look nice, but they don’t last.  Normal wear causes the temple to crack and break in about 4 months."
2.0,"I honestly expected something completely different. The material was weird to me, very thin. It was way too long, and I’m not a short girl. I’m 5’7”. I was very disappointed."
2.0,The dress is okay but too large.
2.0,Too tight to put on...
2.0,My head is small but there’s hair on it therefore this did not fit. My hair doesn’t fit under this. The only hair this will protect is a pixie cut on a woman with a small head or Golum level thin hair.
2.0,Must be in Asian sizes. It's pretty and nicely made.
2.0,"Very pretty bikini and  not cheap looking but only if you have an extreme pair sape ,as in nothing in the top and a giant the bottom .  I got a size L and the top part is miniature and the bottom part looks like granny panties ."
2.0,The earrings themselves are fine but they arrived without any backs so now I have to go out and see if I can buy backs to fit the earring. Very disappointing
2.0,This is NOT navy blue!!! Its a weird blue and not as dressy as a true navy blue would be.
2.0,"If you are small on top the dress might look cute, but if you are  not, dont bother with this dress. The elastic at the waist wont fit right at your waist, as your bust will take up the top part of dress n it will ride up and the dress will look ridiculous on. Not a winner here. Darn, I bought two of these dresses. Oh well."
2.0,"Cheaply made but hey, its cheap so there's that."
2.0,"I purchased the purchased the handbag in September, I did not start using the purse until late October.  I now have noticed the bottom wearing out.  It is disappointing that the purse is wearing out in just a few weeks of use normal use.  I doubt that I will buy this brand again."
2.0,Definitely not the chocolate color posted. It’s more of a dirty grey color....feels like a heavy jersey fabric so that’s a plus.
2.0,My daughter refused to wear it after a day or two. She says the fabric is itchy. She is 6 but on the tall side. We purchased a size 10. The length fell just below her knees. It’s also a little smaller than we expected. So maybe size up depending on how you want it to fit.
2.0,The brim is too wide and floppy.
2.0,Quality isn’t great.
2.0,"One glove fit better than the other and they DID NOT have the stitches as pictured, which look like Mario's. They served their purpose, though."
2.0,"I am an average height woman, so I was surprised that the waist of this dress was easily 2-3 inches too short. The overall length of the dress was fine, the material was fine, but it was obviously made for someone with a much shorter torso."
2.0,Not a nice dress!  I bought size S and is huge. It looks cheap
2.0,Way too big. So extra lol
2.0,It tears too easily and not very durable.
2.0,The chest was big and it made me look like a whopper
2.0,"Nothing to like, poor quality and misleading product advertisement."
2.0,This was a snug fit. A larger size would have been too big in other parts of my body. Wish I would have returned it before I wore it .
2.0,Definitely go up one to two sizes. It runs small
2.0,"The string that holds the beads together is poor quality, although it looks nice. It didn't last a month of wearing it about 3 times a week."
2.0,they fit very small for the size i got. maybe order a size or two up.
2.0,"I bought a gray pair with the girl picture on one leg for a 4 year old. Unfortunately, they pill and start to look terrible in a short period of time.:( I would not buy again."
2.0,bought a medium that looked like a plus size medium when it arrived.  I normally wear a size medium in rompers but I was swimming in this one. Very disappointing as I bought it for a wedding this weekend and I don't have time to replace it
2.0,I've bought two of these so far. The grey one and the silver one. Both of them have been big disappointments. The first one stopped working after it got banged on a door frame. The second one I have now is constantly going dim and you have to bang on it for the brightness to return.
2.0,Not enough fabric to stretch or cover the ears. No slack to fold for a secure fit. Ears stay exposed to the cold weather.
2.0,"Pretty, but also pretty cheap. Clasp never worked."
2.0,"I was disappointed that this necklace did not arrive in the packaging as advertised.  The ""From Miss to..."" card was not included.  It was on a small, cheap looking cardboard.  The necklace is fine for the price; but it doesn't have the same meaning without the inspirational message card."
2.0,Fair price. Lens keep popping out.
2.0,"This shoes fit very well and bought them for a 10k.  Although they fit perfectly and fit pretty well,  I developed a large bruise on one of my toes!  I walk a lot and have never had this to happen with a pair of walking shoes.  Considered sending them back but wore them for the race.  Sooo disappointed"
2.0,"Shipped only in plastic bag. The shoes were smashed bad and wearing them shows big wrinkles in the back of them. They are not slippers you just slip into, you have to pull the back up by hand since the back will not stand up. I probably would have liked them better if they had not been all smashed up when I got them."
2.0,"This feels more like a cheap Halloween costume then a wearable dress. The material is terrible and the fit is just blah.<br /><br />If you're looking for a wearable dress that feels like a wearable dress... this isn't it.<br /><br />This is literally the same quality as a cheap Halloween costume would be. Like, material and construction wise.  Like, you can wear it... but you won't."
2.0,"The lopsidedness at the bottom was just strange. I did a spin for my partner and while I normally get an excited response he said, ""hmm"" which is never good. Normally lingerie looks good on me with my petite body, but this was disappointing"
2.0,"WAY too small and I used the size chart first, then read all of the reviews, and finally decided to order a size larger like everyone said. I looks like I'm busting at the seams on the arms (so way, way too small), but the body fits just too small. I don't know. It's just weirdly made. Was going to cost too much to get it back to seller and get refund, so I just put it int he back of the closet to try to give away at some point. You'd have to be very, very small and have skinny arms. Just weird. The hot pink print is like a screen print. Not very pretty either."
2.0,The pattern is not the same as the model!  But the bathing suit is still cute. Fits pretty well and has padding that can be removed.  I got a small and I weigh 125 pounds I'm 57 and I'm at 32A
2.0,"I HAVE PURCHASED THESE JEANS BEFORE AND REALLY LIKE THEM, BUT FOR SOME REASON THESE ARE VERY SMALL;"
2.0,It broke off 💔
2.0,"I bought four of these thinking that they'd be just as beautiful as they look online. Unfortunately when they got here they looked really cheap even though they are, and you couldn't really tell the man and the woman in the center of the butterfly. Color wasn't as vibrant, but still looked good."
2.0,"While this is nice fabric and design, it is not true to size.  While there is a small elastic ""expansion"" in it, the hat itself doesn't expand, so the elastic is ineffective."
2.0,These bands are cheaply made. The plastic pieces that adjust the bands to size are flimsy and don’t stay in place- I have to adjust them back several times a day as it loosens
2.0,Colors are Wayyyy off compared to the real thing dont buy it if you intend to use it as camouflage
2.0,"They have some sort of hair all over them it comes off like dog hair and sticks to your jacket, pants, etc"
2.0,"LOVE the stone I got, but the bale broke off within a week. I'm going to attempt wire wrapping it, or hire it done because I really don't want to send this one back. Dissapointed in that part"
2.0,"This dress is beautiful. I wasn't expecting perfection for the price. I am a seamstress, and it was honestly cheaper than buying the fabric to make it. If you don't have access to alterations, then I would avoid this purchase. It will need quite a few modifications before it is ready to wear. Beautiful fabric, beautiful lace, just not a fantastic sewing job. I will have to remove quite a bit of stitching along the bottom lace and resew to allow it to lay down properly. It is also very large, but I anticipated that, as my daughter is very tiny and tall. The bows along the back are only fastened at one spot in the center, so they droop to face the floor. I will have to sew those on more securely. The waist bow attaches by a very weak, small ""safety pin"". Waist sash does not meet exactly at zipper in back, not a huge issue as this can be covered by bow. It will definitely need a petticoat to stand out as it does in pictures as the fabric is very lightweight. If you're looking for a playtime princess dress, this is perfect. If you need a special occasion dress, then be wary unless you can sew. Otherwise, spring for the more expensive style of this dress and save yourself a headache."
2.0,Product was delivered timely but was much smaller than described.  It has been returned.
2.0,"Sorry not only was it super big, the fabric is hideous. I gave it away."
2.0,"I ordered this for a friend's wedding as her ""something new"" to put a photo of her deceased brother in so he could be part of her big day (as the ""something old"" since he was her older brother). The package was missing the revision software and adhesion materials, so I had to crop the photo she wanted to use of him and email it to her so we could insert it into a word document so we could resize it for the frame, print a couple of different sizes to find the best one, then cut it out to fit, then tape it into the frame.<br /><br />Eventually, she can get a photo printed on photo paper for the locket, but I was very disappointed that I had to basically jerry-rig it to get us through the day.<br /><br />If I had gotten everything that I was supposed to, I'd probably given this item 4 or 5 stars."
2.0,"I bought four of these, 2 blue ones and 2 red ones,  to be used on a camping trip for people in wheelchairs.  The first one that I used, the clamp immediately broke off the chair with very little wind and the umbrella blew into the lake and is now gone forever.  I took another one out and when I opened it up for the 1st time, one of the metal pieces that holds the umbrella opens fell onto the ground when I took it out of the package.  I have not opened the other two that I have.<br /><br />The material the umbrella is made out of is good material.  It's too bad that the umbrella is of poor manufacturing quality because it would have been a great sun blocker."
2.0,Too loose and the fabric had a very weird feel. Made me really warm. Not sure if I'll ever wear them again.
2.0,These are too short
2.0,If your head is big these will be to tight I know it says XL but they were to tight on me
2.0,The reviews said to go down a size but I would suggest going down 2 sizes! Very cute but very big! Not really upset though considering the price and eventually my daughter will be able to wear them just might take 9 months or so.
2.0,"I bought this for my husband, 2x. I wanted loose fitting for obvious reasons. I won't buy again only because it fit him like a glove"
2.0,I received this bag after seeing a frie d of mine buy it and love it.  When I opened the bag i could the quality wasnt great.  There were 2 missing D rings so i could t attach the shoulder strap. I missed the return deadline so I ourchased a couple D rings from Joanns and out them on. Then a few days later I realized the handles were incorrectly sewn on.  The hardware is backwards.  And the strap material is poor and not sewn on strongly.  The shoulder strap is too short for my liking .  But i love the look of the bag!  So im needless to say disappointed
2.0,"I just don't like it, it's not cute. It doesn't fit me the way it looks in the picture and it's not even khaki its like a dusty light purple color."
2.0,cute in the picture but not for me. I was not impressed
2.0,Really cute on the outside. Soft to the touch. Fits my iPhone 7 Plus with a lifeproof case on it. Very cheaply made on the inside. Credit card slots very thin and tear easy. Very cheaply made.
2.0,Hard to keep them in place
2.0,They don't reduce the glare as I  expected
2.0,"Updated.  It broke already.  Not impressed.<br /><br />Works great.  Not hard to put on.  Its already been dropped with it on, but it did pop open.  I'm not sure on the water proof or if you drop it into water it wouldn't pop open, but it's a nice case."
2.0,"Beautiful suit, the color was as expected, but I bought an XXL and the legs holes are very high cut.  Needless to say, I will be returning the suit."
2.0,It was made of rayon not sweater material as it appears in tje the photo.
2.0,I love the look of these gloves but the loop for your finger ripped first time I wore them
2.0,Its alot smaller than shown. And the sides dont really fit well.
2.0,"The necklace I received was much cheaper looking than the one pictured.  In addition to being a super shiny fake gold color (not even acceptable to me for inexpensive jewelry), instead of having the areas for the Red, Black, and Caspian Seas cut out, they were only embossed.  I am returning this necklace and ordering a slightly more expensive version of it from another seller."
2.0,"I guess I was expecting way too much for such a low price.  In addition to being very cheaply made, the front cover came off right after I opened the package and exposed the dial and numbers.  The black paint that forms the design inside the cover was badly scratched.  I did manage to reattach the cover but I am probably never going to wear this watch.  I will most likely be giving it to Goodwill or let my granddaughter play with it because it is not worth the effort to return it."
2.0,It gets wrinkly easy.<br />It is more of a shiny material. I wouldn't wear it too work.<br />Ordered my regular size and it did't not fit right.<br />I would recommend to order a size up if anything.<br />Will not repurchase again. Waiting to get approvail to return it.
2.0,The size is not appropriate. Xxl mean 44 and when I measure the kurta it was 42.5. Sleeves were very slim. Which xxl size woman has slim arms? Simple disappointed.
2.0,Cute product but did not fit
2.0,Not as nice looking as the bronze version (It looks cheap and not as &#34;polished&#34; in it's details compared to the bronze version). Get both and compare them together and i think you will come to the same conclusion.
2.0,Large fit like a small
2.0,"They're not bad overall, they don't do any kind of ""push up"" for me though. If you need something for a backless dress and aren't concerned about you having that ""push up"" effect they get the job done."
2.0,Too small thought it was larger
2.0,Too big and too long
2.0,"It’s very short , very light , doesn’t look a good quality pendant"
2.0,terrible inseam.
2.0,"The size is 25-27 cm (as shown on the packaging label that is unfortunately excluded from the Amazon photos) is not US 10-13. I have a shoe size 11, and these socks are too small. Fit perfectly my wife's size 8 feet (and this is women's 8, and not men's). Otherwise, they would be perfect for what I wanted: walking around the house on cold California nights :-)"
2.0,Really cheap looking lenses.
2.0,Cute but not for women with big hips.
2.0,The fit is nice. I wanted a thicker white shirt (this one is rather see-through). The white shirts at Costco are better quality than this.
2.0,Great price for the amount that come in the pack however when i received my package there was a used blue pair in the black shimmery pack. they were plain blue plugs with a hole through the middle. had ear funk all over them. it was disgusting. i threw the entire pack away.
2.0,Kind small. But nice
2.0,"Firstly, I recieved a small when I ordered a large. The pants are a bit snug, but that's to be expected. The pants are super thin starchy material. There is no back or front. The hems were made on the outside. Not long enough for my height. The shirt is pretty comfy. Definitely made more well than the pants."
2.0,The bag gets 2 stars because it is not water resistant or water proof. It is a nice bag and I loved the phone compartment and extra pockets but all of my items got wet when we took a boat ride island hopping.
2.0,"This watch is beautiful and looks great, however 2 days after wearing it one of the clasps on the band just fell off. There are no replacement clasps so it then became too small to even fit on my wrist and had to return it. Shame."
2.0,I got the wrong color and size. But in they end it still worked out I didn't return it because they color I got was still super cute and still matched with my husband's but overall it's still affordable and authentic. Would have gave all 5 stars if it was the correct order tho
2.0,The top is like show your under boob short. I suppose you could wear a beautiful bra or bikini top under so you don't have to worry about that. Defintly not mid rib cage like in the picture. Very disappointing!
2.0,"The gold triangle looks very cheap because the metal seems to be copper. It is not a golden color metal. It has a copper tone. as, as beautiful as the cristal is, it looks like a cheap pendant.<br /><br />The blue triangle and the swan look great though. I bought one of each when they went on sale for $22.00 I would say the Blue Triangle and the Swan make for great birthday gifts.<br /><br />But stay away from the gold/copper one.<br /><br />The two stars is only for the gold/copper one. The other two get 5 stars from me."
2.0,"I have 3 other sweatpants by Aeropostal and they are all great! Keeps me warm at 34F, comfi, and look great. I bought these expecting the same. Well its not.<br />The material is too thin, it wouldn't keep you warm at 60F. Just thin.<br />Secondly, unless you have abnormally long arms, the pockets aren't comfortable.  Or maybe if you look like a model, they are.<br />Thirdly: the cut is too low so when I bend Im looking like the plummer...<br />I'm not fat so it's not that. ( I'm  5.4 142L).<br />Over all, thin product, not flattering."
2.0,"The coverage is less than I expected, and the scarves are slippery - they slide right off my hair."
2.0,Shirt came with a hole in the sleeve. Not the happiest about it.
2.0,"Seemed to be of good quality, just waaaaay too short in length. Like it was belly shirt, almost. Had to return."
2.0,"The laces are set up in such a way that it makes them veey difficult to both loosen and tighten.  In addition, the fabric insert around the back of both sneakers bends into them and makes them a bit annoying."
2.0,I ordered a size up and they were still too small for my kiddo.
2.0,loved the size and the fit but the fabric fell apart where the stars are with just one wash in cold water!/ its like what ever was used to make the star pattern made the fabric fray and left see through holes in the shirt. so disappointed the shirt will not last long.
2.0,"When I saw these masks online I was excited to order them. However I am very disappointed with them. The shape of the mask does not look anything like what is shown in the seller's pictures. The mask is not the traditional fitted shape. The top of the mask is very angular at the nose that it looks like I have a bird's beak from the side view. It's very unattractive. I tried turning the mask upside down and it doesn't work that way either. I don't know if I got a defective package but all 5 masks are the same strange shape. Also one of the mask's brand label was sewn upside down compared to the other masks. The only things I like are the colors, the feel of the fabric and the adjustable ear loops. The stitching quality is good. There is no adjustable nose piece or filter pocket. I don't know how this mask would fit comfortably on anyone. I have a small face and because of the angular nose area, the mask slides down my face when I talk. These masks would've been great if they actually looked like the ones in seller's pictures. I wouldn't have ordered these if I knew they were going to look like the ones I received. I never post photos with my reviews but I had to for these masks."
2.0,"These are toddler size, not kids. They were bought for my eight year old, but fit my three year old. Other than size, they seem to be good."
2.0,I am an average size person 5 foot five 130 pounds. The large size was not large enough particularly in the shoulders and extra large was not available. I did like the style of the coat
2.0,I ordered big and they were still WAY too small and a very thin material
2.0,"I LOVE the style and print on this romper. However, the zipper at the crotch is completely useless! We could not change our son's diaper while wearing this. The zipper is way too short, and there was no way to pull his legs out. He won't be wearing this again. Such a bummer."
2.0,"Beautiful, but too big."
2.0,Ordered these pants in the size that should have fit me.  When they got here they were so small in the waist that it probably would not have fit around one of my thighs.  Returned them posthaste for a refund.
2.0,The picture is great the words are not clear
2.0,The earrings seems to big and heavy for my ear so I ended up using only the small part (not the petals what was the interesting part of the deal). And then after less than a week of using it I can see the rose gold peeling off. Big disappointment! Even though I have been taking it off before taking showers. So if you’re looking to wear it one time only go for it. If you’re looking to wear it everyday DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
2.0,The rocks are super small and the string is very thin. Not what I expected for $60.00
2.0,They are so short  they are more like capris
2.0,Bottom fit but not the top. Top looks nothing like the picture.
2.0,This is very cheap looking kids jewelry like out of a bubble gum machine. Not at all what I expected.
2.0,This bag seems like it was sewn backward the pockets are super small. It was smaller than I anticipated.
2.0,Very unflattering.  Striped potato sack.  The slits are high and the dress is shorter than I thought.  The neck line is high and doesn't fit down the shoulder like photos show.  Above the slits it sticks out and looks really weird.  Don't do it.
2.0,"It's a lovely top, very nice fabric, light but opaque. But it is not a US 2X. Not even close. I usually wear a 1X or 2X, 18 or 20 top. This tank didn't even go around my torso. I advise going up one or even two sizes. Unfortunately, I was unable to return it because I let the time slip by."
2.0,One time use only but cute.
2.0,I bought this jacket for my son for Christmas.  He is a big DC fan. He loved the jacket until he tried it on.  I got the largest one available and it was way too small.  Extremely disappointed and I returned the jacket.
2.0,"this one  doesn't have the tightness to sorta force my shoulders.  the design is faulty for me.  I wanted to wear it to line dancing but after trying it on, I didn't feel that it could do the job."
2.0,These are as pictured but do not give any eye protection..like a sunglass should.  Misleading ad..cannot use to partially block when in the car.
2.0,"Cute but not worth it, it broke off."
2.0,It looks nothing like the first photo of why I purchase it in first place. There's no yellow in it . The orange is the yellow. There's not two purples just one purple. Was somewhat disappointed
2.0,Not true to size go a size or too up .
2.0,"These seem well made. However, this is after 3 months of light use indoors only. They’re LITERALLY falling apart. I had high hopes for these, especially for the price I paid…will update if I hear<br />back from seller. **UPDATE **<br /><br />**UPDATE**  I received this message from the seller:<br /><br />“I will apply for a refund of $5 for you and you can have your shoes stitched up so that they will last longer. Can you live with that?“<br /><br />WOW. I did not send them a nasty-gram. I was polite about my issue with their product. They need to learn some business etiquette, at the very least. My expectations must have been too high. I passed on the generous $5 refund and will invest in better slippers from a different seller. That’s something “I CAN LIVE WITH…” unbelievable."
2.0,this was for my grand daughter did not care for coloring
2.0,It is to hard to try and put on. I worked with it repeatedly and it was really to hard to work with.
2.0,preTTY
2.0,I wound up returning this item because the fabric on the bust is cut really low and really lose. It was way to big on the top.
2.0,"If you’re expecting the green in the picture, DON’T!!! The color I received was an army green, which is okay, but I wanted the green in the pic! Someone said go a size up, but I should’ve went twoz It fits okay, but could’ve fit better. For the price, I’m not satisfied, but I’ll make it work"
2.0,They ran too big. I waited too long to return and am stuck with these giant pants. If they were my size they would be cute though
2.0,"I know the belt only cost $10, but the first time I pulled it through the buckle some of the coating on the belt came off when it rubbed against the buckle.<br />I did get the belt in a timely manner from the seller, but I am dissappointed with the quality of the belt.  It was a gamble for 10 bucks, but in this case I wasted my money."
2.0,"Perhaps I received a defective batch but I have had to reinforce the inner seems on all of these because the first time I wore each bra the underwire popped through.  I've bought bras through Amazon before and was pleased with the product, just not this time. I feel I should wear a bra more than once without being stabbed by the underwire."
2.0,I loved the color and fabric but it’s like two sizes to small.
2.0,Wore them 3 times. 1 wash. Literally began unraveling on the 4th wear. Comfy for the very short lifespan
2.0,La tela del vestido no es como en la foto de exhibición acá la tela no cae con el mismo peso si no que el vestido tiende abombarse no se amolda al cuerpo
2.0,My daughter is a tiny 3T. The arms were way too small but big everywhere else.
2.0,"Yes, the keychain looked like the picture, but it broke about ten minutes after my sister (who’s 16 years old and was careful with it) unwrapped it for Christmas. The metal ring connected to the coin was so flimsy that it snapped (imagine a super soft metal that you can practically mold with the fingers). She’s really good at making things look new again and just decided to drill a small hole through the top and make a necklace, but I’m pretty disappointed that it wasn’t stronger. On the side of the seller though, I didn’t end up contacting them about it so it’s my fault that nothing was resolved. The reason I’m giving two stars is because it broke right away."
2.0,Decent quality for the price but awful fit! The bottom portion fit true to size and even a little baggy but the top was tiny. I am small chested and it was skin tight on me. Needs to be better portioned.
2.0,Cheap shoes the top of the shoe near the angle had torn the second time I wore them. Was expecting a better quality.
2.0,These barely even looked like hearts. Shipping was super fast but I wish the product was what I was looking for. I ended up going and buying another pair.
2.0,I loved the look of the necklace but it tangles too easily. Only got 1 wear out of it and I kept untangling it all night.
2.0,Great dress by the way it’s really sheer so if your wanting to have any other color underneath it will show
2.0,The lost its color after a couple days...
2.0,"I thought they were smaller but they fit too wide on my face. Not my style but if you like wide frames, go for it!"
2.0,So disappointed!! Packaging was as if I bought it from the dollar store. No box just plastic around a paper necklace holder. The chain broke as soon as I tried it on. Not worth $5.00 let alone $33.00. Sending it back immediately
2.0,Ridiculously small for the price.
2.0,Faux pockets. Kinda useless. Returning. Quality just ok.
2.0,It's coming apart after 2 washes.. Hang dry only . Great design ..poor iron on  decal.
2.0,"Very hard to see the dial indicators outdoors because of the daylight reflection...And if you want to read time in the dark, &#34;forget it&#34; , nothing there to see.  It's a very pretty watch to look at but that's about it. And if you take it off for more than 3 hours, the whole mechanism stops working because it's an automatic watch and you have to keep resetting the time.........$50 bucks, what do you expect!<br /><br />I'm currently in the market for a battery operated watch with good dial indicator visiblility so I can see @ day and night. I guess I'll just keep this one as a collector's item or give it away."
2.0,To small. Should come in sizes
2.0,The buttons don't stay buttoned after washing. Collar is very floppy after washing.
2.0,These look cool but the stones would fall off after a few uses. Not for me
2.0,"Watch band broke twice in the first week. The links are very weak. It's a great looking watch, which is why I gave it two stars instead on one, but I was disappointed with how fragile it was. Also, the dial to adjust time is cheap and fairly difficult to adjust. It moves very quickly, so an accurate adjustment is rather difficult."
2.0,I bought this purse a while ago.  Finally moved my stuff to bag... Second day using it the zipper separates  and now is broken .
2.0,"The set came in a nice box, and they look great. However, one of the cufflinks had the post snap off while removing it from the box. They look nice, but they are made with cheap metal and are very fragile."
2.0,"Beautiful, but 2 beads fell off after wearing once."
2.0,wasn't what I thought
2.0,"These are thinner and are not as drive as I thought they were going to be. Also the inside seam really bothers my legs, v so much so I can't really wear them. I would not recommend it purchase them again."
2.0,I searched for shorts with pockets<br />These have no pockets.
2.0,Had to return the boots was really hard to put on!
2.0,Fits mediocre.. color is tan/nude not grey as listed. Not very flattering and material is cheap
2.0,"I was sooooo excited to get this kurti. I is too small. A very snug fit and if I wore it the kurti would rip. I normally where a 1x to 2x but I got a 3x. Buy a size bigger! Sadly, I bought the largest size they offer and I can not do that."
2.0,It’s too shimmery and the quality of cloth is not that good! I had to return it for that!
2.0,"Ok product. The light is not super bright, but works OK for keeping an eye on the dog in the backyard at night. It wouldn't work well for walks or anything like that."
2.0,Fabric is nice and light.<br />However I bought these because pictured should be low rise description says low rise..  instead this item fits right at the natural waist and sits right on the belly button.<br /><br />Pockets are smaller then pictured waistband looks exactly the same as the pants vs a different texture as pictured.<br /><br />It's almost like they switched models but didn't update the add.<br />.very disappointed
2.0,Pero no dura mucho su gold … apenas unos días y ya para va perdiendo 👎
2.0,Returned. It's too small (narrow). It's not as clear and transparent as shown in the picture.
2.0,"It's a very cute watch, but quit running within a week of getting it. I can get a watch for half the price from Walmart and it runs 2 or 3 years before stopping.  Don't exactly like the idea of taking a new watch to a jewelers to get a new battery."
2.0,These plugs screw on from the front and got twisted so tight my SO had to break them to get them out! I was stuck with these for months befor I finally let him break them
2.0,Larger than expected. Also the nude color was too light.  I am returning all except the one I wore.  It kept sliding down and I had to keep adjusting.  There was very little control.
2.0,"they feal great fit great but are not nicely made have ripped withing 3 times of wearing them, not worth the money"
2.0,"fit ok, however it was misleading on the made out material, it is not made of silk or not even core-spun polyester silk yarns."
2.0,"Entirely too small, impossible to ever put a photo in"
2.0,Nice. Not loving it.
2.0,"One of the ear rings was damaged, and so I was dissapointed."
2.0,"It is not the typical newsboy but it will do for now, which is why 2 stars.  The brim of the cap is smaller than the photo and the cap is very floppy.  It sour scent so I will be sending it to the cleaners before I wear it."
2.0,This is my second pair in 2 months and they both ripped at the toes
2.0,This item was to be used to keep an elderly warm.
2.0,"these run small and I reordered a size bigger, got yesterday and they fit the same..Will be returning the second pair as well. Gonna try one more top at even larger size and if that doesn't work will give up and go back to my DAWGS!"
2.0,"Be aware the red is orangey red, didn't work for me. Looks cheap"
2.0,"These were small. I ordered a size above. Order at least two sizes bigger because not only are they small, but they shrink also."
2.0,Everything is fine but the hoody is just a weird fit.  Always constantly fixing hoody.  Its way to big for anyone's head lol.
2.0,"It's a cute ring but unfortunately it lost a ""diamond"" the second day I wore it. Im not particularly hard on my jewelry so its disappointing that it didn't last more than one day. I guess you get what you pay for. I still wear it and it hasn't turned my finger green, but I don't  usually wear my rings at night or in the shower.<br /><br />Update:<br />After a couple of weeks it started turning green. Don't bother buying this ring"
2.0,"Makes a person look really big,I would suggest one size down"
2.0,"I am not sure of these are sterling silver as stated because there is no stamp on the earrings. I will try them and see if I react! If they are truly ss, they are a real bargain."
2.0,"Cheap material, very thin. Feels like swimming trucks. Way larger than listed"
2.0,These were okay. It was hard to remove and reinsert information card. Also the flap over info just stays flapping so you should just put name and number on front of cards.
2.0,"This was HUGE on my baby (1 month). It could've fit a 2 year old. Because my stepdaughter was dressing up as Pippi Longstocking we needed a monkey so we checked local costume shops, they were all cheap, corny looking monkeys. So, I tore this one  completely apart and sewed it back together to fit. Having done that it was really cute and kept him warm!"
2.0,"I normally wear a large (think Target or Kohls large) & ordered this in XL, teal. It arrived today and I couldn't even get my wrists through the sleeves & my wrists are tiny.... as in I have to have 4-5 links removed from Citizen watches. It fit the rest like a medium, but the length would have been perfect.  Its a tshirt, NOT a a sweater.  It's jersey stretch,  so its light weight and requires a tank or chemise under it. I had my daughter, who is 5'4"" and wears S/M, try it on & it fit her ok. I may just have her keep it."
2.0,Nice material<br />Arm holes too small<br />Very thin
2.0,"I was so excited about these, but they looked nothing like the picture- the holes were just holes cut in jeans not frayed or stringy at all, and the color of the jeans makes them look cheap. I would jot recommended if yuh are buying these for every day jeans to look nice."
2.0,Please be aware the dress in VERY HEAVY not suitable for summer events or warmer places. The cost to ship it back is as much as the dress. Gonna donate to a goodwill someone can use it
2.0,The bow part is ok but the material going around the neck is a poorly sewn string and the clips are very very cheap. Clips won't last long.
2.0,These did not work out for me. I went based on other reviews when I ordered. I actually just went to TJ Maxx the other day and found a xl and the sizing looked completely different from what I received. I ended up keeping them and giving them to my mom. She is a m/l and they fit her perfect.
2.0,"I really like how comfortable and soft the material is, but there isn't enough elastic(or something stretchy) in the waistband, so they lose shape quickly and try to fall off. I still sleep in them, when nothing else is clean, but that's the best recommendation I can give."
2.0,Expected. . . better.
2.0,Sent it back for a sz large it was too small
2.0,"My first pair of isotoner mocs were great- sized properly, comfortable and reasonably priced.  Unfortunately the style I was happy with is no longer available, so I decided to try this one.  I ordered the 2XL instead of XL since the reviews say they run small- the ones I received were the same length as my original isotoners, but fit way too loose, and the string tie is worthless since it runs directly from one eyelet to the other instead of looping around the back, so it wasn't possible to snug them up.  Also one of them had a hard spot that made it even more uncomfortable.  At least I was able to return them for a full refund- thanks, Amazon.<br /><br />I've given up on Isotoner; I'd rather spend 4X as much and get a quality product."
2.0,Too small for average size man
2.0,These are sized pretty small and they aren't very elastic
2.0,It took less than two weeks to wear. Both tie up buckles were broken and lost. Only the shoelaces are left.
2.0,"Got it for my baby shower, but unfortunately didn't end up wearing the dress because it was see through plus it was too big"
2.0,"I ordered a couple of this bracelet and the multi-colored one and thought they'd be such nice bracelets for my daughter and me to dress up a casual look.  When they arrived, I was so disappointed.  They are cheap and sloppily done.  The &#34;evil eye&#34; is randomly painted on (it appears) and sometimes it's smudged on the bead.  The return shipping would cost more than the bracelets did, so I won't return them but I was really disappointed that they looked so bad.  The wire seems sturdy, though, and I might throw all of the beads away and redo them with old beads I have in my jewelry kit.  Sigh..."
2.0,The rings fit nice. However the black coating has just about all flaked off. The rings are mostly steel color with a bit of black.
2.0,It's soft and super comfy but it doesn't drape the same way as pictured. It looks bulky. I ordered the brown and somebody joked that I looked like a Bear. LOL so I'll probably only be wearing this at home.
2.0,"the sleeves are super big & the material of the shirt is super weird and very thin, not t shirt material at all"
2.0,"It is a very nice set and seems like it will be warm. My issue is I ordered a 3 to 6 MONTH size and it would most likely fit a 2-3 year OLD, so we won't have a chance to try this out for several more years. the hat is bigger than he entire head and covers her entire face."
2.0,"The feel of rubber….and hold moisture,  become sticky"
2.0,"I wanted to return this top. I ordered it because of the good reviews but was very disappointed. I got white and it was see through. Also, the fabric on the bottom to tie the top we’re way long and skinny and just looked weird when tied and you can’t leave it untied. Because the seller is in China it was going to be almost as much as the shirt cost to return it, so I just kept it. Overall not happy with this."
2.0,My daughter wears under shirts everyday and these are super cute but the head and arm holes were way to tight.
2.0,Turned my hand blue
2.0,Lovely sweater BUT I wore it for the first time and one of the cuffs started to unravel
2.0,"It's a really nice jacket, but the sleeves on a large where about the length you should get on a small or medium (the length of the jacket is fine)."
2.0,"Really cute dress and nice quality. Unfortunately, there is absolutely no stretch or buttons/snaps at the neck, so my daughter's 93rd percentile head could not fit through the neck hole even though the body of the dress would've fit. I ended up having to return the dress, which is a bummer because it's so cute!"
2.0,"I ordered these to be used as septum jewelry and needless to say, I won't be ABLE to use these as such as the jewelry is really small. Plus, they actually came in different sizes (the black ones were bigger than the rest of the colors). I will more than likely keep the jewelry and use it for when I get my nostril pierced again."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:6d315cff05b05fa9f080a5e6560335e3]] It’s nice but not as described at all no 3D butterflies not many embroidered butterflies<br />Different then photo shown on website here
2.0,Daughter never even got to wear it because the zipper broke immediately out of the box. Not sure if I can fix this one.
2.0,"Material of the camo style is thick and fuzzy. Elastic on waist in heavy and tight.<br />I'm 5'5"", 130lbs, average build.<br />Fit makes you look wide. NOT a good choice if you have a tummy. Overall very unflattering.<br />Also took a month to arrive. If I had noticed they came from oversees, I would not have purchased.<br />Material of the black color is more 'linen-ish' and better for summer. Elastic is a bit more comfortable, but still NOT a flattering fit."
2.0,Quality of fabric was good and thick but it was too small and short for me.
2.0,"This is not a complaint about the material!! It’s the fit that I have a problem with. I can get them on my feet but there very tight!!! I have been purchasing socks for over 45 years and most socks do not fit the size they claim , so iam not surprised,,<br />Just another lesson learned an stick with what has worked in the past,,<br />I am curious to see how the supplier acts to this<br />Review,,??<br />A good supplier would send the correct fitting socks and or refund my $$$ ??"
2.0,"Nice size, but strap broke a month after wearing."
2.0,"Didn't get the color (iridescent gold/pearl not matte gold) I selected.  The front earrings are different than pictured. They don't look as sleek and nice as pictured.  But stone settings look solid.  Use care when putting them in your lobes, the post are sharp at the ends.  You can prick the inside of your ear when inserting.  Probably will return in hopes of getting a better pair"
2.0,"I have some combat boots that are clear and have butterflies all over them I thought these socks would be perfect because the butterfly print would show through my boots. Well, they are cute but once you put them on, the design stretches out and looks terrible. So the design is not woven throughout, just printed on. I returned them."
2.0,Uncomfortable and clingy on me
2.0,"Pretty low quality. It's not terrible. Probably worth the price, but it's no hidden gem. It's pretty cheap looking"
2.0,Color faded after first day wearing it
2.0,"I bought this because I have used other backpacks before. The straps are too thick for me and where you hook the bag inside is not that good. The velcro is too close to the zipper so when the 2 L bag is connected, it pulls the weight down so it doesn't want to close. I would not recommend it. I replied to the email from the company but they never responded and it's been over a week."
2.0,"Really cute tank, light weight perfect for summer but the straps started to unravel after the first wash so the whole shirt is now useless"
2.0,"Color was good, softness medium, fit way too small even tho I ordered large"
2.0,"So I LOVES these at first. But then The more days I wore them the more the elastic at the waist would roll down. I ultimately returned them because it was very annoying always flipping it back up and pulling them up. It’s like half an inch thick. If it were thinner I’m sure it wouldn’t be a problem. If you have a flat stomach it might not be a problem either. I’ve had two babies though, one being 6 months ago and a c section, so my abdomen is still rolly."
2.0,"Sizing runs way small, most likely 2 sizes smaller than advertised. Could not even get this dress on. Returned!"
2.0,ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IS SHOWN. TOP HAS SCOOP NECK AND CAP SLEEVES  BOTTOM IS A FLOWY SKIRT INSTEAD OF TUTU  IT IS PINK AND PURPLE ALSO INSTEAD OF PLAIN PINK
2.0,"It's an extremely cute shirt.... it's not long enough to be a dress. It has high cuts on both sides so you can clearly see up to your hips and undergarments. I tried to put leggings on with it to see how it went, nope. The front is too long and the back is right at my butt, pretty disappointed. The fabric ia rough, not smooth like you would expect. Won't be ordering anything else like this again. 😕"
2.0,Looked like a praise dance dress. Ordered a XL fit like a 2X. Dress came below my knees. Great fabric .
2.0,"My first impressions of this top are really good. The material is thick and supportive - especially in the chest. You could easily run in this one and do high impact. The white isn’t see-through and it’s almost a compression type shirt. I don’t know if it’ll roll during yoga, but I think it might just because it’s pretty fitted. It does run small. I typically wear a Large in tops - sometimes Medium - and I couldn’t have gone smaller. The XL fits like a medium. It’s a good length. I’ll wear it to yoga and then adjust my rating.<br /><br />Update: it’s a little tight, but I still think I’ll keep it. It did pretty well in yoga and hopefully I’ll lose a little weight so the compression will feel less constricting."
2.0,"Is very small for a man, and there isn't anyway to adjust it. Other than being small, it is a very nice watch! Different!!"
2.0,Disappointed to say the least  looks like wish crap.<br />I ordered a 2xl  it's like a kids 2xl<br />I can barely get it on and no way it will zip<br />It does heat up ok
2.0,"It looks like the picture but on 1st use the plastic head ""jewel"" fell off.  I have to glue back on.  Backing on earring stud was super tight- difficult to put.<br /><br />The entire item is made of plastic, But it's cute.  It's very short & made for a child or very small adult (5' tall adult female).<br /><br />I would mot buy again or recommend."
2.0,"Material is very thin and material is very soft, not much structure.  if you are looking for a sharp shirt, this is more casual."
2.0,"These earrings are beautifully made; HOWEVER, they are very heavy.  If worn for any length of time, these earrings could stretch or even tear your pierced holes.  I decided to keep them because they are so lovely looking, SO, I made the choice to remove the beaded flower post and will add a new post that works better for my ears.  EVEN SO, these earrings remain fairly heavy and I would not wear them longer than several hours for an evening out, etc.  I hope that the makers of these earrings read this and create a beautiful beaded LIGHTWEIGHT earring."
2.0,It's alright I mean it fits good but doesn't really help me sweat
2.0,Bought these for my g/f who said they turned her wrist green. I would not buy again.
2.0,"My son wore  this stylish cross bracelet on his wrist  for three months.  I  wanted to be sure if it reduced the arthritis pain in his hands. After three months, he said that he did not feel any relief from the arthritis pain in his hands. It is now lying in my jewelry chest."
2.0,You can’t track anything while wearing the watch around your neck.
2.0,I really liked them at first! But they broke super quickly and it’s not something I can fix
2.0,"It's exactly what I wanted, but the thing is that it came with little white spots that supposedly had to go away after you wash the shirt for the first time, however, that did not happen because not all of the white spots disappeared, but the question mark did disappear..."
2.0,"One pair came with a hole, a few others got holes after HAND washing."
2.0,I had to return them. The large was too small for me and I only wear a size 8. The company did reach out to me to see what they could do to help. But there was nothing they could really do short of refunding me. Cute socks. Too bad they didn't work out.
2.0,I had such high hopes for these. these keep pulling down. the waste band is super loose and thin.
2.0,"I was so sad  these showed up in black, but they are super cute nonetheless!!!"
2.0,These socks seem ok except for the fact that they run small.  I'm a shoe size 9 1/2.
2.0,"Frame build is cheap. Arm became loose and is unable to be tightened. Nose pieces are too hard. And most importantly, the clarity of the lenses are poor."
2.0,Too skimpy for me.
2.0,They sit crooked and the nose pieces to adjust suck.
2.0,"Great product idea, but bad (or incomplete) design. When you make eyeglasses which are so foldable and bendable and unbreakable, you, unfortunately, make the rim of the lenses soft too, thereby causing lenses to fall out all too frequently. Once you lose one lens, then you'd have to replace both. It's happened 4 times with my almost-7 year-old, so the glasses could definitely use a stronger/thicker rim."
2.0,This is a really cute dress. I got the small but it still was loose where the<br />whole is due to the very stretchy material. I am in the workings of seeing how to fix that but when that is fixed I think this will be a very pretty dress!
2.0,"The boots look deformed.. The leg part and belts are cute, sparkly - but the rest is bad... I have not even tried them on yet - they look uncomfortable.  I give it a 2 for the belts.  Will probably return."
2.0,Size up about 2 sizes!
2.0,Not worth the $$
2.0,"Giving it 2 stars because it might have a useful application, but I wouldn't use it for welding or cutting applications where eye protection is important. To much airspace all the way around would make it pretty easy to get a piece of slag in the eye. No complaints with the company and the quality looks fine, just seems to be a poor product design."
2.0,"Case protects stadia controller very well, but has space to hold VERY little else. Case does not have enough space to fit easily or conveniently the chromecast or the controller charging cable. Kind of a pain in the ass, and not as discribed."
2.0,Looks really cheap and the the color is misleading. Not happy about this dress
2.0,The stitching is horrible and coming loose and hemmed out after barely a month.
2.0,Run very small. Bothered my skin
2.0,I’m giving it two stars because it’s definitely cheaply made and it looks like it. Plus it broke two days later while I was put putting. It’s a cute idea for party favors or for a kids birthday party.
2.0,Runs very small. The style is very cute & the fabric is nice. Great way to look business casual but still be comfy. Only suggestion is to go much bigger than you think you’ll need. I’m a 26 inch waist yet both the small & medium were smaller digging into the lower half of my rib cage. Trying with the large.
2.0,Would not work on earrings!
2.0,Gold plating full & stone also dull. Returned
2.0,Run a size too small. The fabric did not feel like cotton. It was thick and rigid.
2.0,"I loved this at first, but in less then two weeks one side of the diamonds broke apart. If the band stayed together better, I would have given it a 5 star... I'm bummed that I cant even wear it anymore without it being too loose..."
2.0,"I am a 36 FF and the extra large did not cover my ""ladies"" well at all. Though I'm not opposed to showing some, this was not good at all. The dress  itself was super cute and i loved the material. I wish it had fit"
2.0,"Not very fashionable, mad for males that work outside physical"
2.0,"They work, but they're too small to work with very easily.  Worse, they put hard metal and sharp points inside my hats very close to my head."
2.0,"The adhesive bra didn't stay on at all. The nipple covers worked pretty well, though."
2.0,It's too small/ That's not for someone who wears a medium
2.0,"I was excited to receive this jacket. I ordered the rose colored pink but it is actually a bubble gum pink. I am usually a size medium and I would say it is true to size depending on how you want the jacket to fit, it was definitely a bit roomy to wear clothing underneath. The other downside is one of my sleeves lining isn't even sewn into the jacket. I currently have a message into the seller to return, I will update how that process goes. I would love to order another color but am scared it too will be completely off."
2.0,I like the hoodie but it runs way smaller then I expected
2.0,Coat was not well made at all. Zipper for the coat was so light weight and tiny I suspect it wouldn’t hold up at all. The overall build quality was really shoddy. I retuned it the same day it was delivered.
2.0,"These feel cheap and flimsy, and the little plastic nose piece came off and got lost really quickly, before I even had a chance to start abusing them."
2.0,"The fabric is poor. As I  wear them, they increase in size."
2.0,I really wanted to LOVE this dress (I purchased 4 different colors) but it did not flatter my shape. I ended up returning all four but I’m still on the hunt for my perfect off the shoulder dress. The material was light (perfect for summer) and the colors were vivid. It fit as expected but made me look short and extra round - This might be perfect for someone who is taller and has broader shoulders.
2.0,"Love everything about this pink nightgown (lounge dress) except that it pilled up after about two washing.  Not sure why, but I know it is not supposed to."
2.0,"I received this item on November 19,2020 - not even a month later the band is broke. The part that you insert into the watch face is worn it won’t latch anymore and it’s not from me changing bands - I’ve been using this band since I received it."
2.0,Top and bottom does not go together. Looks great tho. Was buying for a bridal gift but the top was for like a size E for a C cup person lol
2.0,"These watches look beautiful, but none of them had the battery seal on.<br />Two of them are​ not even working."
2.0,It was very baggy in the body but tighter in the arms and neckline. The colors are great and vibrant but this material is very cheap and sheer. Will be returning.
2.0,"The Large that I ordered was too small to fit over the width of my hands - and I can often get by with a Medium, so this was actually a Small with Lg tags affixed.  How can I say anything of their quality if I can't even get them on my hands after ordering a size larger than I normally do?  Needless to say, they were returned.  If you do feel like taking the chance with these gloves, order two pairs:  the first one size up, and the second two sizes up, and return the pair that don't fit.<br />Update:  The XL replacement pair just arrived and fit almost identical to most Med.-sized gloves, that is; short in the fingers and somewhat tight across the hand - with enough fill that putting them on is neither quick or easy.  I'm going to keep them, but would not recommend them to anyone who requires a Lg (or larger) sized work glove, or to anyone who needs to put their gloves on quick over damp or wet hands (you'd rip the liners trying).<br />These gloves could prove to be a durable pair of work gloves for adolescents and gals who do well with a Men's Small or Medium, as these are the actual sizes of what RefrigiWear's Lg & XL in this particular model of glove."
2.0,I dunno why — but they are difficult for me to see out of?! not a fan. brought them to a party and the team loved them though
2.0,"after 6 months of active wear, shoes fell apart, not waterproof."
2.0,I love the idea of the necklace but it's just weird. It doesn't lay flat across my chest and the ribbon started to fall apart the first time wearing it. Awful!!!
2.0,"Too long. It would fit a woman who is at least 5ft 8 inches tall (which is a very small group in the Indian / Pakistani community). There should be an option to state height while placing the order (some other sellers have this option). I am 5'3&#34; and even with 4 inches high heels, the bottom still sweeps the floor. I can not get it easily altered because there is embroidery at the bottom. Alteration from the waist is also hard because of the way the fabric spans out below the waist. The one size fits all model does not work, because all women are not one size."
2.0,"My wife says the band is great, but the Fitbit kept popping out. Had to exchange it with her old cradle. Other than that, it’s great!"
2.0,[[VIDEOID:d68150194be932a0fd3d95313d379179]] It’s not wearable as it arrived smashed flat.
2.0,I don't like how it looked on me... Maybe it looks cute on others..... cute product though.
2.0,The top is cheap material and junk construction. think Halloween costume quality.
2.0,These are very cute. I like the way they look but the first time I wore them a button popped off. They are not very well made and they stretched out of shape after wearing them for a couple of hours. They are useless now and I'm annoyed that the three pairs that I bought lost their shape after wearing them one time.
2.0,"I bought these for my ""tween"" and ended up returning them...these are ""SHORT"" shorts.... it's a cute jammie but too short for my liking..."
2.0,Good gloves but they wore down and have a hole after 3 days of package handling.
2.0,I returned it. The suit was a bit low cut for my 7 year old.
2.0,"The dress is a lot boxier in person than in the pictures so you will likely need to wear a belt with it. Otherwise, you'll look like you're wearing a geometric potato sack. Also, this dress is very large. I'm 5'2&#34; and 115 lbs and the smallest size was still well past my knees so it looked very awkward on me. I eventually got it tailored to my height."
2.0,"I wear it and it's pretty with the lace but I don't like the fit. It's very billowy in the bigger sizes. I wasn't comfortable with how it gathered in the sides around my chest. I bought black and it was a true black, not faded, so I like that and it was thin and comfortable to wear for all day.  I will not but again though."
2.0,These are flimsy. They bend under the weight of the keychain and they fall off easily. I also had to punch holes in the top of mine to hang them up for display. I'm not sure I'd buy them again.
2.0,"Cute panties, but thin and way smaller then they should be. I ordered a 4T and they fit more like a Small 2T. So order 3 sizes bigger then you really want if you want them to fit."
2.0,"This dress does not look at all as the picture. The fabric is cheap and the colors are not at all vibrant. The dress also does not fit properly, as the fit is actually 1 size smaller than should be."
2.0,cheap looking and it doesn't hold on to the glasses.
2.0,"I love the look, the material is good for the price , my only problem is that it runs big, I order a xxl , normally I  wear a xl should've ordered a l ....... it was sooooo much room left, and I'm thick so if you are too order your size or a size down"
2.0,I didn't like the fit of
2.0,I’m usually a large but they must use petite sizing because it was way too small. Luckily seller accepts returns.
2.0,"I ordered the 5X (42""-48"" waist).  They fit my friend that were's a size 33""-34"" and 34"" inseam waist perfectly in the waist and a bit short in length.  I don't believe these are intended to be worn with the elastic waist stretched as far as it would go.  I assumed these were meant to be fit looser in the hip and leg. I gave them 2 stars because the colors and pattern are great as are the beads attached to the end of the waist drawstring."
2.0,"My oldest daugher (12) ordered this hat for her little sister (9), expecting (for the price of $32) to get a great quality hat. It is rather thin, very thin, actually, when compared to other animal hats my daughter has had in the past. Though we tried to fluff up the pom pom ears, they were a bit skimpy. The proportion of the ties to the hat are not at all as they are depicted in the photo on the page. The ties are not long enough to tie under my child's chin. The hat is too small, as well, and we will be returning it after the holidays when we have time. Some accurate sizing information on the site would have been helpful in making our purchase as well. It was definitely a disappointment, both in quality and in size. If the hat had been priced at about half the cost, I would have been less likely to post a negative review, but for the price, I expected more. I'll know better next time."
2.0,did not fit over glasses as advertised
2.0,"the socks are nice enough, but they're HUGE.  My kid can't wear them for years."
2.0,CHEEP CHANE.  IT IS NOTHING BUT A CEILING LIGHT PULL CHANE .
2.0,I love the color color sooo much these leggings would be absolutely perfect if they did not have a line rite wore the crotch is . Why would anyone do this😣 !<br />The stretch is amazing the softness is unreal they r squat proof and very high waisted
2.0,Runs very very.small
2.0,"Got my bracelet today and was excited to wear it.  Took it off this evening after a day of office work, and voila’!  I have blue on my wrist!!<br /><br />Color me very disappointed."
2.0,"One of the strap came broken I send a comets to th e seller and they never responded. Other than that, my wife is happy with it."
2.0,"We’ve had this for maybe two months and the color has completely faded off of any part that’s been in the sun! Not great quality, but for the price I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,There was very little detail in the carving.  Difficult to make out what it is supposed to be.
2.0,"flimsy, too small, not a good fit, cheaply made"
2.0,Very flimsy product. The strings broke almost immediately.
2.0,"I'm very tall and thin, so it's sometimes hard to find dresses that fit my size 6 measurements that aren't WAY too short. (the assumption seems to be that if you're a size 6 then you're also 5'3&#34; and the only sizes that seem to be long enough are 2x or more) So when I found this dress I jumped for joy and ordered a size Medium based on the indicated length of nearly 44 inches shoulder to hem and measurements that looked close enough to fit nicely and comfortably. The dress did fit perfectly... almost. Just saying that the only way it would measure 43+ inches long is if you put it on the rack. Laid flat it measured 39 inches from shoulder to hem... so on my 5'11&#34; frame it hit me at mid-thigh and bending over was out of the question. Material was a beautiful color and very comfortable, but being that short it made me look like I was wearing a little girl costume. Returned it for refund."
2.0,"The top was too big around the back, with no way to tighten it. The cups fit fine. The bottom was too small for it to be an XL, fit like a S."
2.0,The actual product doesn't sit on the body like in the picture/on the model.  It feels a little shorter than what is pictured.  Also boxier - not as long / tunic-like.  Doesn't wash well.  Put in wash once and the balls started to unravel so I was pulling thread off all over the place.  I recommend either hand washing or washing in a laundry bag.  Also - it wrinkles VERY easily.  But annoying to iron such a casual wear item...
2.0,"unraveling after one wear and baggy and bulky. not great fit, material seems nice but poorly sewn."
2.0,"I bought these in aprx May of 2016 (the two pack) and both masks started peeling with two weeks of use. If you buy these, find a glue that won't seep through the material. It is October 2016, and by now I have tried to glue these back together at least twice, but I haven't found the right adhesive yet. Frustrated!<br /><br />Other than this problem, I think the product is a good idea, it just needs improvement."
2.0,It doesn't fit a men's size 14 shoe.
2.0,The description says these are men's socks but they wouldn't fit any grown dudes that I know 😆
2.0,"This thing does not look like the picture, the straps are very long which I can easily fix and the pants are too short which just makes it look weird. I honestly hate this thing. The belt that comes with it is also too small. Only keeping this thing because my daughter likes the heart print and still wants to wear it"
2.0,White gold painted
2.0,Bought these for a friend and they constantly fall out of his ears.
2.0,"The backing for the mask could've been 1/4 wider all around, this will make a better fit, and I expected the yellow mask to be a deeper yellow like the picture you provided."
2.0,"The dilly dilly logo is a bit faint and not as pretty as the picture, the shirt material is thin and cheap, fits a bit snug around the chest and arms compared to other t-shirts the same size. Didn't realize this product was coming from China. If I did, I wouldn't have ordered it due to past experiences with their cheap material and smaller sizes."
2.0,this did not look like the pic...it was a little cheap looking and there were parts of that were damaged. Would not recommend it. Sent it back.
2.0,"Should include a warning that, unless you're built like Beth Dutton, shirts run at least 2 sizes too small"
2.0,Not only was this too large but the picture does not show there is a standing collar around the neckline.  Would not have purchased if that was more visible.
2.0,"I order the size xl, the panty is perfectly fine but the top... is TOO SMALL to be a xl. I was not satisfy or happy about it so I gave it to my younger niece and kept the panty."
2.0,I have a very small head and it’s still too small!
2.0,Not as nice as the picture. It looked cheap. Never wore it.
2.0,These fit ok because I got a large (usually wear a size 6) but the pockets on the back were at my upper thigh.. It looked really weird and the hardware on the overalls was rusted. I was not impressed so I returned them.
2.0,The support on this would be good if it didn't run so small
2.0,The product was too small and the label didn't indicate which size it was.  It also smelled terrible.
2.0,This dress would have been perfect for Christmas pictures but it did not come with the belt now it just looks like a big night gown
2.0,"""This Bikini Cover up Women Boho Beach Wears for Summer Holiday Vocation"" is miss represented as ONE SIZE. It will fit petite, size small, flat chested women only. I gave two stars for the quality, which is good, and the off-white color makes it versatile."
2.0,"CHEAP!  My bet is it will break within a month<br />The clasp is is very cheap and will wear out fast<br />One good thing is, it holds up your pants!"
2.0,The magnets kept in coming off and I lost them so the wrist band wasn’t usable
2.0,The hoodie is nice however it was too small i reccomend going up 2 sizes.
2.0,"I wanted to love it, but the fit was really goofy."
2.0,"The masks are so hot, having the ""window"" defeats the purpose. All you see is condensation and fog.<br /><br />I DO NOT RECOMMEND."
2.0,I only recieved one. I assumed it came with two.<br />Who sells one shoe?
2.0,Looks nice but is actually smaller than the given dimensions. As described it should be 11.8 inches long. It’s only 9 inches. If interior was as described 10x3.15x14 inches. My 13 inch laptop. 9x11 inches should fit. It doesn’t. I’m returning.
2.0,"Charm is quite large, nothing dainty about it whatsoever. Sent it back immediately, not what I expected."
2.0,Took a week to get this small envelope that could have been mailed. The pin is the exact size of a dime. So tiny you can barely see what it is. Don't let the picture fool you.
2.0,Glass looks green and cheap :(
2.0,This wasn’t just too large it is a strange shape that would fit weird on probably anyone
2.0,"I ordered these glasses for a school project. I needed the lenses, but they glued the damn things to the frame! Not to mention how they were sticking out of the frame. And the frame was bent out of shape, as expected when it came in a yellow envelop instead of a box or something. But I didn't care, as I wasn't going to be wearing it, I just needed the lens (which took ages to take out). But what bothered me the most is the lens color. It's NOT pure red as it's on the picture. It's got orange on it. And you definitely can't see through it like it's shown on the picture. They are reflective lenses. But all in all it works out even better for me! But I just wanted to you to be aware.<br /><br />They probably ran out those red lens, now they are just gluing in lenses that are similar to it."
2.0,I try not to believe all the reviews but this shirt definitely made me believe them. It is nothing like the picture the cut and the quality are pretty terrible.
2.0,This sweatshirt is TOO BIG.  Sleeves are baggy.  Shoulder seams are too low on the arm.  Not very flattering.  Had purchased this as a Christmas present.  Wish I could return it.
2.0,Mediocre quality. Fit fine. Kinda see-through.
2.0,"I love these slippers, BUT they are much too large.  What size is a woman's 8?  That's what I ordered and it seems to me that it is about 2-3 sizes too large.  It would help a great deal if they listed a realistic chart of American vs. whatever type of size this is:  the chart they have doesn't make sense."
2.0,"Awkward fit, slides down on my daughter, nice material and warm just not the nicest fit, kinda fits like tights around hips"
2.0,"This product was cute and couldn't beat the price. The material is soft and looks like the photo, but not for my built. I'm short, big breasted, broad shoulders and a little tummy going on. This was not a flattering dress at all on me. The dress came in a small package with the chains that connect to the back and that was inside another smaller package. It would have been helpful if the chains were already on the dress. But one of my chains out of the five links that they give you is broken as you can see in the pictures. Not to mention again I'm 5'1 and in the pictures this dress is about up my little behind. If the dress was 3in longer, chains already connected and not so low cut in the front, it maybe could have been passable."
2.0,I've had it turn on at very odd times.  It's embarrassing.  I'm afraid to carry in on my purse.  I'm afraid it will go off in Church.  Have no idea how to contact the company as there was info with it.
2.0,The shoes are very cute but they do run very small. My daughter is a Size 4 so I ordered them a size 4 but they were too tight. I will be returning them.
2.0,Glasses are cute and won't break but much too big for my 3.5 yr old
2.0,Not the same arch support as an Oofos sandal.
2.0,Doesn't breathe. Don't wear it to workout.
2.0,I had to fix the top because it is too big.
2.0,"I'm 6'3&#34;/ 230 lbs and the slimmer Oasis line from Icebreaker, at size XXL, has been a go-to for years.  This recent iteration, however, is too short and too wide--like those bad-fitting Smartwool shirts.  It's obvious that the XL will be way too short for me.  The fabric is also not the same quality of years past.  Not sure if Icebreaker changed their production in order to accommodate expanding waistlines or what.  Disappointing!"
2.0,The buckle is not what I expected.  It makes zero sense!!!  Disappointed!
2.0,Not the same as ilustrated.
2.0,"Received the item rather quickly, disappointed in the quality of the fabric and the fit. Though I knew it ran small I ordered a size up and still not close to a good feel. The material feels cheap and is see through, though it's silk I expected a better quality product. The color in the picture is a charcoal grey once received light grey"
2.0,It was a no from me - these went right back
2.0,It’s super cute but it does not fit a standard pandora bracelet.
2.0,I just went to wear this for the first time and the back spot where the straps slip through are cut so I can’t use the straps at all. Sucks cause I can’t use it now. I can’t wear strapless tops. :( sucks waste of money.
2.0,Is will be needed to wear underneath it. Otherwise it’s adorable.
2.0,Not the best quality . Sizing on top for a small definitly need large Chest. A or B cups won't be able to fill in.
2.0,I am only 5’8 and although beautiful and comfy it was several inches to short.
2.0,"too small, gave it to my Sister :("
2.0,"I got a large/XL (I’m a size 10/12) and it fits my 12 year old daughter better than it does me. Sizing is absolutely horrible. But the price was decent, the colors are cute, and it’s been holding up in the wash. Worth it if you can get the sizing right."
2.0,"Beautiful and arrived on time , however none of that matters considering it broke two weeks after purchase, while my sister simply wore it. The piece holding the name plate broke off. Kind of embarrassing as it was a very sentimental birthday gift and It was our late Mother's name."
2.0,"Was too large and the color was all wrong, I recieved a yellow, red, black plaid. The fabric was also very uncomfortable I am returning this item."
2.0,Very bad quality. The items are easily broken with just 1-2 uses
2.0,Feels nice but does not look like the picture. Single snap. Wanted that extra snap for sturdiness.
2.0,Started off well then got super baggy around the hips and droopy
2.0,It's not worth the money The address space is very small.I do not recommend this seller
2.0,"A little undersized. However, I was able to donate to my town clothes bank."
2.0,"Was bought as a gift for a Navy mom in June, the thing just fell completely apart. Just looked at the order - it was ordered June 22, the window for returns was June 24....really?? And how do I get ahold of these people about a warranty or something? Barely lasted 3 months??!!!"
2.0,"Product came in bent and out of shape. Since the wiring around the white part is so thin, I would have preferred it to either have been shipped with some material to keep it in place (such as a cut out of soft styrofoam) that also helps prevent bending of the headband part too (the blue part). The material is good but I just find it very inconvenient to look for something large and round enough to place the wire around so it can bend back into shape. Also, the attachment for the wire easily comes off."
2.0,"Not anywhere close to worth the price.  They fit small, they rip easy, and most of the time rip just trying to get them on."
2.0,Didn't fit my versa 2 like it was discribed to.
2.0,boxy look and shorter than it shows in the picture
2.0,Love the glasses but break super easy. Usually abt a month or 2 in. Wish they were more durable
2.0,Shipped folded up in an envelope instead of a box and won't flatten out. Folded up not in alignment with lettering. Embroidery unattached and frayed on one end. Nothing lines up. I'm just using for decor or would return.
2.0,"The fabric is so sheer that it nights as well be chiffon. It's too bad because I was SO excited to have something like this. For the price they are charging, I'm sure they could use a thicker fabric. You can see through the skirt."
2.0,"I wanted to love this and I needed to love it, but it was awkward looking. The fit was perfect, but the lace top and the separate material at the bottom made it look weird. It would look better lace throughout."
2.0,"Cute, but way too small. Fits like a size Med"
2.0,"Really cute but, poor craftsmanship. One leg of the shorts was markedly shorter than the other!"
2.0,"Fit was fine but style of strap made it impossible to step and walk. Sandle would not stay on, too much movement. Super cute though."
2.0,These fit fine but are pretty sheer and see through which isn't great. They also pilled after just a few wears which is really disappointing.
2.0,These bras literally all broke in the same exact spot. Not great quality. Don’t last more then a month each.  Not super comfortable...
2.0,"So disappointed! The fit is not at all like a woman's T should be. I bought a small and medium and they're both shaped more like a child's/man's T-shirt - straight down). Also, the material is not soft at all. I gave it two stars because it arrived quickly."
2.0,"So, I bought this trio for my husband because of the metallic looking silver band. The band really does look like metal & is very comfy. However, within a week the metallic paint/coating began peeling & looked horrible. He no longer wears it. He now wears the black band exclusively. The only reason this is getting 2 stars is because the other 2 bands function well. However , we are not satisfied because we bought the set because of the silver ring and it lasted a week."
2.0,It did NOT give me a choice of what's REALLY WRONG with the boot. The size is NOT the issue. The COLOR is NOT what it appears to be in the picture. I ordered grey. It &#34;looks&#34; grey. It's NOT grey. It is a light beige at best. I am very disappointed because otherwise these would be perfect price-wise and quality-wise. Really wish the color was what is was supposed to be.
2.0,Cheap material and the fit is not flattering. Looks like something you might see in a bargain bin.
2.0,Difficult to see
2.0,"Horribly wrinkled, hard to steam out... I should have known from the pictures, you could even see wrinkles on the models.  Foolishly, I hoped for better.  When I shook them out to hang them, all sorts of debris fell out... YUCK!!! I would NOT recommend UNLESS you like looking far less than professional and like you slept in your clothes.  Pretty disappointing."
2.0,"It is nice quality, but it fits more like a medium."
2.0,These were a bid disappointment.  Very thin and the material seemed cheap. The size was ok. I returned them
2.0,The color was a bit off
2.0,It was a lot shorter than I thought it was going to be.  Couldn't wear it as a dress!
2.0,"Pretty, but isn't the same fabric or detailing as the photo. Disappointed because the silk finish is what I was wanting and it's 100% not the photo it's a replica"
2.0,Pictures that are advertising are not what you really receive
2.0,I generally order shirts in a medium because they shrink to a small after a good hard wash this thing is HUGE might as well be a dress. I ordered as part of my new work uniform so I didn't have time to return it so I'm stuck with a dress make sure you order a but smaller than normal.
2.0,Very cute dress. Didn’t quite fit.
2.0,The product works well with my eyeglasses.
2.0,I just received this and it is a total piece of garbage.  I bought the small for a 3 - 4 year old and it would be very short if my 3-year old  was to wear it.  I'm returning this because it's just so cheap and almost see-thru material.  just not worth the money.
2.0,I ordered the pink one. It has the black body with pink limbs. I wanted this one bc it was the only one that didn't have the pink cat on it. When it came in the mail it had a cat on it. Wasn't was pictured. Other than that a cool necklace. Just disappointed about the cat part.
2.0,The packaging these earrings came in was way nicer than the earrings themselves.<br />They are comically huge!! Please see the lipstick for scale.<br />I would not recommend to anyone
2.0,One link keeps coming off. I was highly disappointed. I used transparent glue and clips to keep it from linking off. Still haven’t found a solution. I thinks it’s a pretty cool product minus the gap.! Ugh!!
2.0,"I liked everything about it except for the actual ability to read the Lord's Prayer inside. I had one of these when I was 7 and I could read the words very easily. This is almost impossible to read anything in it for me, so I'm  sure my granddaughter is not loving it. I had other adults try to see the words and they has the same problem. Wish it could have been seen easier."
2.0,Really small loops for the ears and fits really tight on your nose. I could not breathe properly
2.0,"I bought one for my wife 1 yr ago , went through the dryer many times, no problem. She wanted another one this yr but it unraveled in the dryer on the first drying.  Would like replacement but can't return it unless it's in new condition. Hoping for a replacement. Feb 3 still no replacement."
2.0,I looked up the item and expected the pins to come with the pins to install the new watch band.  I saw that that I would get ten dollars discount and didn't get it.
2.0,Esta pequeño se mira muy bonito pero el número que pedí era pequeño
2.0,No scarf included. Disappointed
2.0,Too big I kept anyway
2.0,It is so pretty.  It's ashame all pieces were great except for the necklace.  It came completely broken!  I am so disappointed!
2.0,Not 100 pcs. Only 30 pcs.
2.0,Beautiful bracelet but very small. Couldn’t slip it on and I have small hands and wrists.
2.0,"The fabric isn’t stiff enough, it’s loose and flimsy so it gets sucked up against my nostrils or mouth every time I try to inhale, literally suffocating me. And the ear loops make my ears ache pretty quick. I was really hoping to show off my pride with this, especially because it doesn’t look very nice, just like the photo, but I just can’t breathe in this one. I had to switch back to the plain ones I have from other companies that used stiffer fabric so I can breathe."
2.0,"They were super cute, comfortable and the right size when I received them. However, after about 2 weeks of use, the material lost it's volume and fluffiness. They aren't as soft anymore and are too large on my feet."
2.0,It's ok. Not as slouchy as pictured.
2.0,"They may be cotton, I haven't done a burn test.  BUT even after soaking in hot water and washing them through twice in a very competent top-loader whatever sizing was used is still there.  Perhaps I should boil them.<br /><br />Stiff, nasty, don't know if I can use them.  I may send them back just because I am sick of buying garbage from 'you know where'.  I sure wouldn't wrap this crap around my face, it would sandpaper my skin off.  But maybe I could use them in the wood shop.  You know, to rough sand."
2.0,Way too big of stone and does not sit flush with the skin like the jewelry should. I would not buy this again.
2.0,This was way see through.  Was hoping that it would be made a little better. And as soon as I washed it (per the directions) it shrunk.
2.0,"not a sweater at all most likely will stain for your skin black in you dpnt wash it first it comfy but be warned if it's hot out you will sweat and if its cold out you will freeze , definitely wear somthing softer underneath so your body has a way to breath long sleeve cotton silks or those thin thermals you see at Wal-Mart"
2.0,"Gave this as a gift to brother-in-law. After going through the dishwasher, he poured himself something to drink and noticed the cup was still wet. After drying, cup was wet again. Upon emptying cup out, noticed a very thin crack along the entire inside sides of the cup. He was surprised that it was leaking but did not completely fall apart because the crack looked like it went all the way around.<br /><br />Got some laughs at least."
2.0,Really cute but its already starting to crack in the center. It is bending and when it bends you can tell it is breaking.
2.0,"For my daughter, but she has a petite head and the glasses are a bit overwhelming for her face."
2.0,"It looked like the shape in the picture, but the material was a very cheap-looking, shiny, lining-quality fabric. Returned it."
2.0,I ordered this in the color black but received an army/olive green color. It was a gift for my boyfriend. His favorite color is black. He likes the bag & I didn't want to ruin the gift by telling him that there was a mistake made.
2.0,"It does not look as slim and delicate as the picture shows.  The real thing is heavy, fat, and rough looking."
2.0,"Super bummed about this purchase. I got this leotard for my daughter in Dec, for her Xmas stocking. She’s worn it only a handful of times since then (Feb). The entire beck seam split out already!  Ugh. Maybe try to find a better quality body suit for your kid. I thought Capezio was a good brand, but...."
2.0,Ripped as soon as I put on
2.0,"Actual item does not look the picture. Cheap material, the v-neck goes all the way down to mid stomach"
2.0,"The glasses are beautiful and I really like the look and feel.  Can not stand the multi focus spots and the glasses, they made me nauseous.  It is a personal thing and not the fault of the glasses or manufacturer.  If you can stand bifocals, then you would probably love this product."
2.0,I got the shoes for my six-year-old nephews birthday. They were delivered on time and fit as expected. They lit up one time and went through all of the cycles but as soon as they died and he went to charge them they would not work anymore.
2.0,Good Gloves - as advertised. But while snow blowing my fingertips get cold. Durable.
2.0,"I bought these for the Black Metal Cuff Links, however, the black cuff links were not very dark. They looked like the silver cuff links had a very light tint on them. Also, the blue in-between the silver is very light as well, you have to really look in order to see the blue. Overall, I'm a bit disappointed."
2.0,Size not true to chart can see underneath.
2.0,the fit is not the best..also the material looks cheap.
2.0,"They are too cheaply made, they ripped after the 4th use."
2.0,The gloves are pretty but way too small. They would not fit over my wrist and the thumb holes were very tight. I returned them
2.0,"Product was rather underwhelming. The petals were dull in color and luster. In the picture, the petals looked much more pink. In reality, they are much more of a faint, white-wash color, maybe with a slight tinge of pink in just the right light. The petals in the picture are much more consistent in size and shape. In reality, the petals are noticeably different in size and shape. The velvet bag that it comes is also very stiff and chintzy. She liked them, but as the buyer, I was disappointed."
2.0,These almost immediately lost luster in the metal color. It tarnishes within one use. Good luck if you wanna keep longer than that. Hope this helped you.
2.0,"Fits a bit snug, which causes the skin under the ring to peel because of the moisture that can stay trapped. Both edges on the inside of the ring have molding ridges that dig into my skin making it uncomfortable."
2.0,"not sure it was cashmere, looked and felt like merino.  not as soft as other cashmere sweaters I own, disapointed"
2.0,Not too pretty!
2.0,Chains Rhinestone starting falling off and the gold is fading
2.0,Cute concept and I wanted to love it.  I am 5'2&#34; and 130lbs - it was really difficult to get on and I didn't feel it fit me right so returned.
2.0,Rough fabric and fits too tight
2.0,"They were pretty, and I like the fabric, but they run entirely too small—as in I had to give them to my daughter. After being washed two times, I couldn’t raise my arms without it riding halfway up my stomach. Other brands don’t seem to do this. Could be a bad set, could just be the brand. Who knows, but I won’t try again with them."
2.0,Super cute but cups are too padded and too small for bigger breast requesting refund
2.0,Some what tight but still wearable! Thanks
2.0,The winder is nicely designed and manufactured. It has a glossy finish. All hardwares are high quality. The motor runs quietly. It has all basic functions. It's a very good value for the money.<br />12/17/2020 update: the watch winder stop to work!!!
2.0,I think these are super cute earrings. However they are so light they come out of your ears. I lost one and I didn't even know it. And I had only worn them twice. So if you want these I suggest you put one of those plastic and to keep them in your ears. Disappointed they're already gone
2.0,"I have never had a pair of gloves that fit me like this.  I have long fingers, I know this, and even large gloves tend to be too short for my hands.  But they're usually too short in all the fingers, not just the middle one.  Actually, it's because the rest of the glove fits so perfectly that I can't ignore the shorter middle finger, as I have to pull the wrist band up onto the bottom edge of my palm to alleviate the pressure on the very tip of my middle fingers.<br /><br />This is made especially frustrating because the rest of the glove is very well made, extremely comfortable, and works perfectly on all the touch screens I tried them on.  If not for that short middle finger, these would have been an emphatic 5 stars!"
2.0,I can’t tell what’s the front or back. Tag is on the side lol
2.0,Didn't like the way it look
2.0,"The dress was really cute and fit as expected (I’m 5’8”, 160 lbs, 36D) - ordered a large in the gray. The rouching hit in all of the right places and certainly made me look slimmer. The arm holes are a little big, however.<br /><br />I did send this item back, because it had two big sort of greasy looking stains on the rear 😢 I turned around and there they were. I’m seriously so disappointed."
2.0,These do not cover from nose to chin. I will not be using very often
2.0,"The tutu is cute, but it's not what I purchased. I'm looking at the photo of the product and at the skirt delivered to me and the color scheme is completely different. There is no dark blue, yellow, or green in this tutu. I was really excited to give this as a gift, but it came a day late and I was hoping for the product that was advertised. I've posted a photo of the tutu I received and of the one I actually ordered."
2.0,"If you buy this product in navy blue, it will look black like mine does. Also, scroll down on the description. The pictures are misleading. The default umbrella base is the metal cris-cross design. The bases shown are an additional cost."
2.0,Nice price but very light weight and cheaply made.
2.0,The fit was not right for me
2.0,"I returned these, they were too heavy to even give the yellow tint a chance. Were not comfortable to have on my glasses."
2.0,This rompers is cut short in the torso. Very cute though.
2.0,Does not flatter the body. Looks like a big red garbage bag on.
2.0,Different.  cute if you have no butt.
2.0,"I purchased this yesterday and I didn't get the 110 pieces, from what I counted I got half  And not only that I didn't get the ones from this ad shows, I got the fuzzy balls  ....but it's great quality and a great price.....sadly I'll think twice about buying from amazon because some have the no return policy....think about it when it's looks good to be true...then something wrong .just saying"
2.0,So I took this bag with me while backpacking around Ireland as a way to hold my dirty laundry untill I could make it home. The bag fell apart after about 10 days of use. Bad construction was definitely a factor. I also might have been putting to much weight. Would not recommend for traveling.
2.0,The beads are not the same color in the photo and they fit a little snug
2.0,"I love this ear cuff, though was made poorly. The leaves began to fall off after wearing once."
2.0,Not warm enough - it was about 35 degrees out & my fingers were frozen.
2.0,Size chart is not accurate at all. You'll need to size up 1 or 2 sizes. I ordered based on the size chart and I can't even get the shorts buttoned! Ordered in early April and just now received them so the delivery took so long and now I can't get a refund. Will donate them.
2.0,"They are super cute when they come in the mail but after wearing them for 2 days they are dull and the metal at the bottom of the actual heart is kind of sharp.  Unhappy and DO NOT recommend.  Also, I am not a smoker, drinker, and I do not play with my tongue ring so those things would not be the reason the rings became like this."
2.0,Not unsexed for sure
2.0,"Arrived scratched and with a bent post. Posts are too long to be comfortable. Price is ok, but I will probably give them away."
2.0,The sleeves are really short and the jacket is hard to move around in.  Looks swag tho
2.0,Loved it but the top you cannot adjust the straps and they were way to large. :(
2.0,we’re a little small on me... i’m a fairly tall person (like 5’9) and they were really short on me
2.0,Nothing like I expected. Cheap material. Not nearly as pretty as the picture
2.0,Too thin and flimsy..would not buy this product again..
2.0,I only got one spike. So disappointing. I would give a five star if I would have received it in whole.
2.0,"I haven't had a real chance to use it yet because it hasn't rained, but just from first impressions this umbrella does not seem good at all. It is difficult to open and when you close it, it is not neat & therefore hard to put back into the sleeve without having to stuff all the folds in. There's also some loose threads hanging off the strap which is a sign this was cheaply constructed. The frame also bends pretty easily just using my hands so I'm pretty sure this wouldn't last in high winds. Will be returning."
2.0,The tie looked very nice but the zipper is cheap which caused it to get stuck. The zipper was so stuck the tie had to be cut off making it not reusable.
2.0,Big girls this does not hug your boobs and it makes me look like a whale. I have broad shoulders so maybe that's why haha. I'm 220 5'8 and got the 2x
2.0,the watches fall out of the slot with the pillow. Poor design
2.0,Too Bulky and stiff - Clasp come open way too easy - would not recommend<br />I was not happy with this braclet
2.0,"It's pretty when you get it, but after 2 weeks the glitter started to fade and fall off."
2.0,Awkward fitting and poor quality. Low profile in the way it fits your head like a deflated balloon
2.0,"The pattern is not cute up close and if you want the top to hang freely in the front like the picture th n I suggest buying a bigger size than what you think you need because it's made straight, no flare to it like there probably should be."
2.0,"They are not what I expected,  they are very thin..."
2.0,"The earrings were gorgeous, but much smaller than expected."
2.0,Broke apart after one wear!
2.0,Made in China so sizing is small and not according to size chart. This is NOT a cotton blend as described. It is 95% Polyester and 5% Latex. Very cute but dislike the material and returning.
2.0,"Bought my normal size and they were way, way too small. Plus the thick padding doesn’t go all the way up the back like I was hoping."
2.0,I love the color and style but it did not fit me the way I would like go To Church the Jersey material is thin
2.0,They feel and look cheap. The frame does not feel like it’s a high-quality metal. It’s an inexpensive lightweight metal that feels really weak. The hinges are one-way and have no give to them. The lenses are cheap plastic. There’s no way glasses this expensive should cost this much. The case is nice.
2.0,Theres no way these are good at -40°. Its 47° out today and I rode a scooter that goes no faster than 15mph and my hands were still freezing.  Comfy but the squared off touch screen finger tips have you pushing the wrong thing often.
2.0,"They were too small. Unfortunately, I'll have to return them."
2.0,"Cute style but one of the most uncomfortable tennis shoes I've ever worn.  You would think for the price these would be comfortable, but they are heavy, stiff and tight. Wouldn't reccomend."
2.0,It's very cheaply made.
2.0,"Definitely not as flattering as expected. Didn't flow very well, size was way off, but the fabric is nice and soft though."
2.0,"Purchased and thought they would withstand rain/wind. They do not withstand even light wind. They easily flip but what I will say is when they flip, the sturdy springs easily fold back. If you just need them for rain they will work."
2.0,"Very cute, but heavy and definitely not hypoallergenic."
2.0,When they say runs small they mean for real small not just a bit!
2.0,Looks much better in the picture. Its basically a cheap t-shirt that someone sloppily made cuts in the sleeves. You could do this yourself for only a few dollars and get a better result.
2.0,"Update - Well, things were going well.  Received the purse June 6. Stitching is coming loose by the outside sipper, the lining is starting to come lose on the inside of the purse and just this morning one of the snaps is no longer usable.  One of the 2 pieces of the snap completely separated from the purse.  So, my review has changed to 2 stars. Still love the color and the size, but knocking off 3 stars due to subpar construction.<br /><br />It's just right!  The photo shows it beside a 32 oz cup for size reference.<br /><br />The strap is long enough to.go over my shoulder with a coat on.  Inside had 3 divide organization. The hardware is substantial and attractive.<br /><br />Love it."
2.0,One shoe already stopped work. My daughter had had them for 2 months
2.0,"I like these bands better than the band that comes with the Samsung.  Easy to attach to the face, however, they have already faded and lossing their original colors, as well as breaking.  I am bummed because I thought I found a good brand."
2.0,This is a cute and soft sweater but I ordered my normal size small and it is more like a large or extra large size. It’s also more fuzzy than I expected making it look like a more casual sweater than something I’d wear to work.
2.0,"Great color and pattern, but colorful print on band only lasted a few weeks. It is pealing off as seen in photos."
2.0,"I did not think the quality was very good. Also, too large for my face."
2.0,"Good thick material, but constantly needing to pull them up 😣"
2.0,Wish there was elastic or adjustable waist band. Sized up to grow into but probably won’t fit for a year with one-size waist. Cute design in neutral gray color is otherwise great and versatile.
2.0,"The inset is not noticeable at all when you have it in-hand.  It is very thin and non-descript, making it unable to be anything distinct."
2.0,These are so pretty but of cheap quality. The left black and green residue on my nose after wearing them.
2.0,They broke after the first day.  Not a good item at all.
2.0,"These were amazing, absolutely perfect. The best glasses ever.<br />Unfortunately they didn't last. They broke after just a few weeks.<br />I'm in my 50s and careful with my glasses.<br />I'm really bummed they didn't last"
2.0,stone too big
2.0,"They would have been PERFECT, bought a lot of these but these came broken, hopefully it was the mail carriers fault"
2.0,"I was so excited to get these, I opened the box and they're wooden tunnels with the plate placed on top which is fine..but the one plate was not even attached. I hot glue gunned it on and they're fine. Just a cheap pair of plugs."
2.0,"I bought this as a dress to wear to church. It’s super cute on the model but let me just tell you, it is WAY TO SHORT on me. I’m only 5’2 and it doesn’t even cover my butt. It’s super cute so I kept it and I wear it as a shirt with leggings but it’s not good for a dress."
2.0,Ran small and length way too short
2.0,"This item came incomplete, missing two golf spikes....*"
2.0,"Ordered an extra large received a medium.  Liked the top of the shirt but had a band at the bottom that I didn't care for. It was even to small for my teenager, had to return."
2.0,Returned. The quality was not good at all. Shiny and cheap looking! I'm really sorry because the design is pretty!
2.0,This products material is very poor quality and the fit was just off but the color was nice.
2.0,"I really wish they cut the fabric a different way because the crotch area fits weird and since the fabric doesn’t stretch at all it looks a little awkward unless you either wear them as a high waist or very very low waist.<br />I do wish they made this using some stretchy materials as well because even though they are meant to be baggy, if you try to squat in this it might be uncomfortable or even too because the cut is a little off.<br />For these reasons it snot necessarily worth the price, should be around 10bucks. But looks fashionable."
2.0,"The material was not great, and the fit felt very loose. I felt like I was wearing circus pants. They kept falling down. I would expect that if I wash them, they wouldn't hold up."
2.0,Very pretty but tarnished quickly
2.0,It was too big...
2.0,"The lenses pop out rather easily and the plastic lenses are not optically pure. I rarely use these after a week of ownership, but I keep them around for the lower light levels, as they are not dark lenes."
2.0,"I wanted this dress to work. The top fit tight but still zipped. The problem is that this dress is so short. It was more of a long shirt than a dress. It stopped at my butt in the back and barely covered the front so there was no way this was passing as a work appropriate holiday dress. I returned it, maybe someone with smaller hips and chest would get a better cut but definitely not for me."
2.0,"I'm Not Impressed With The Fabric And Even For Someone Who Can Easily Wear A Size 0 US Size,Its Quite Snug...It Looks Like The Photo..."
2.0,Smell and taste bad.  Would use as decoration but not very functional
2.0,I liked this design but the item fell off and top part broke with minimal movements. So sad.
2.0,Made with  umbrella materials that don't stretch
2.0,I am a curvy woman. I bought a large thinking it would give me that flowly feel but it didn't. It hugged my body like a body con dress .
2.0,Don't buy this cheap POS belt. It broke after normal usage 6 months after purchase.
2.0,"Received this hat, runs very small, mine also has a defect at the top that makes it pointy at the top, looks like a cone shape on the top."
2.0,"Finally got watch set after several hours. This the 3rd watch like this my wife has had.<br />Works good now. The year is wrong 2020, but the time is right.<br />Hoping it lasts longer than the two she had before this one.<br />The other 2 just quit and a new battery did not help.<br />Looks great, this was a Christmas present.<br />Hoping this the 5 star watch."
2.0,The waist cinch looks like it was ripped and poorly resewn! Overall the coat felt stiff and uncomfortable to wear. Returning.
2.0,Quality not good.
2.0,Too heavy on sweaters and won’t stay flat.
2.0,this runs incredible small.  If you order these make sure to get 4 to 6 sizes larger
2.0,"The shirt is cute, but it looks nothing like the pictures... Totally different look it does run small... I usually wear a large or xl got an xxl and it's still too small..."
2.0,These are the cutest sexiest shoe.. but they hurt like the devil.
2.0,"purchased for a 10 year old and the neck portion of the hat is a lot shorter than I was expected. The hood itself is nice and thick and should be pretty warm. However the string that tightens the face mask was not fastened in at all, so there's no way of tightening the face mask - Wish I had noticed this before i threw the packaging away so I could have returned it."
2.0,"Its new, doesn't appear to have been worn, but there is a liquid stain in it. I checked it's on the mask itself. I needed it in 2 days. So I'll wash and sanitize it. If stain doesn't come out most DEFINITELY returning it."
2.0,not the fabric i was expecting :^( and the shorts are a little awkwardly fitting for me in the crotch
2.0,"Update: Reduced from two stars to four.  I wore the jacket once for about an hour late year. Today I wore it all day while teaching…and received a number of compliments from my students.  When I got home, I noticed the “faux leather” had peeled back at one shoulder. This could only have come from placing the strap of my purse on and off my shoulder — which I did walking in the building this morning and out again at the end of the day. Very disappointing.<br /><br />It fits a bit shorter than I expected, even though i admit I am long-waisted. The seams appear to be well-constructed (I do a fair bit of sewing whenever i have the time, and the seams were the first thing I examined, as there are many of them) and the material looks good. The cut is slightly boxy; I prefer a little more fitting on my smaller frame to keep me from looking shapeless, but someone with more of a figure might not object."
2.0,"Arrived with one earring broken, so I've had no chance to even wear them.<br />On a positive note,  they are a good solid weight and are very pretty. I would have considered this an excellent purchase if they'd arrived intact, but I'm extremely disappointed after such a long wait for delivery."
2.0,the bottom is nothing like it shows on the product page.
2.0,I bought this because I wanted a buckle type closure. Instead what I got is the same closure as the original band.
2.0,"Love the quality of the product and the picture they're great, unfortunately it's not breathable at all i ordered two different ones and i'm unable to use neither one, i removed one layer where the filter goes and still very hard to breath thru it the double layered fabric is not very breathable I won't be able to use either one what a shame."
2.0,Bottoms feel like cheap material. Outfit looks cute. One of the straps has already come undone after only 2-3 times wearing for a little while at a time and I haven't even washed it yet
2.0,They were too big for her. She is a size 5T
2.0,Too soft for a walking 10 month old. Too slippery for the tile floor.
2.0,It broke within 30 mins of wearing if. It was nice but a waste of money for a 30 minute use
2.0,In the picture advertise there is no design on the buckle when I receive the belt I was happy with the quality and the quality of the buckle  itself very happy but the buckle had a design luckily for me I didn't mind it I like the design but if I didn't like the design I would be very unlucky this is false advertisement
2.0,"I'm a size 10/12, 36DD and ordered the XL. The fabric for this style is all wrong making the bottom wrinkle and pucker between the laces."
2.0,"It will dig into your waist. If you’re looking for the ultimate comfortable alternative to panties, this isn’t it. Elastic at waist is tight despite sizing up. Also, if you’re looking for essentially grannie panties, why do they need to be low rise?  You gonna wear them under your low rise jeans?  Honestly!"
2.0,"Pros -<br />- It's cute<br />Cons:<br />- the navy color of the edging is pretty much black<br />- the neck of the bib is huge so wide and drops down so far in the front that my 2.5 year old easily will drop food on her shirt rather than her clothes. Making this bib non functional<br />- It is t-shirt weight. Super thin so even if it does manage to catch some food/drink, they will be soaking right through to my kids' white dresses."
2.0,"These are all 18 gauge. When it said for lips, eyebrows, etc, I expected at least 16g, hopefully 14g. These are extremely too small."
2.0,Looks a little cheap pearl and wings are nice needs to be on nicer chain
2.0,"Me llegó sin la piola la blusa, tuve que conseguir una para poder utilizarla"
2.0,"It’s so thin that it’s more like a pajama dress. Can’t wear it as a dress or tunic in public. However, I am using it as a swim suit cover up. It’s very soft. But can’t wear as intended. Bummer. Love the color."
2.0,I ordered the white with black cheetah print dress that appeared to be all one length in the photos. What showed up was this high-low dress with colored cheetah prints. The material is also really thin/cheap feeling. Disappointing.
2.0,It hurts my legs on first use:;( i really like how much it helps you to swear but what about the pain? If you train on bike more than 40 mins it hurts a lot :(( sadly i will need to return. :(( i m sad because i know it really works.
2.0,The hem of this dress was unraveled when I first got it. Really disappointed for the amount that I paid for it.
2.0,Flimsy and bent
2.0,"I liked the sweater, but didn't realize was only 15% wool, and acrylic does not breath well. I was wanting a wool sweater, and it's my own fault for not reading the amounts more carefully before purchasing. If you're not sensitive to acrylic, it's a really nice sweater. It just felt really hot to me."
2.0,"Has thus in for not even 2 wks & the ONLY reason I purchased it,...had fallen off...I was absolutely devastated, but the seller did end up replacing it  I did for me..."
2.0,"It was decent I guess. Didn’t really look like the picture material wise. The picture looks like good quality material, but it’s cheap looking when you receive it. The color is not entirely accurate either."
2.0,To big for my ear. Got hooked on my clothes
2.0,Necklace to tight.
2.0,"Ordered size 6, cute booties. Shoe box noted size 6, inside of left shoe said 5 1/2... You get what you pay for?!"
2.0,"I bought this cute little bracelet for my 14 year old Granddaughter for Christmas. She loved it. Unfortunately...she informed me that the little end that twists off so you can put a charm on it, kept coming untwisted. She kept putting it back on...it eventually fell off the day before New Year’s Eve and she lost it. So now she has the bracelet bent around her wrist and how can she wear the charm that I bought for her to wear on it? She can’t because she may lose that also. Needless to say, I feel very bad that this happened to her bracelet all in less than 1 week."
2.0,So I went into this knowing that they are super fake but it’s a very noticeable fake gold color. On top of that it doesn’t properly fit my no means. I wouldn’t really recommend these.
2.0,Meh. It keeps pulling apart where it connects to the cloth
2.0,"No nose wire. Very thin. arrived in packaging unrelated to the company,  address was a Chinese tech company. ..almost threw it away. Save your money."
2.0,It's quite comfy. It's baggy.  I'm a little disappointed because I might have gotten a size too big. Sometimes extra larges are great for me when I buy hoodies on Amazon.  this just wasn't the case. I'm sure I'll appreciate it more once it gets colder and I start wearing it. My hands will never be cold!  The arms are a little too long for me and I'm 5-9 my arms are long or so I thought.<br /><br />(Update) I don't really like this hoodie. I've had it for a while and I never wear it. I just hate how it feels. Was a waste of money. Only wore it like twice.
2.0,The socks are low I'll give them that. But they're advertised as no show loafer/boat socks. They show up awkwardly in my sperrys. The price is cheap and the materials are cheap (don't wash well) but for the price you'll have to decide if they're worth it
2.0,Fit awkwardly in the shoulder & chest area. Fabric is more satin then the picture shows
2.0,it didn't fit me well
2.0,belt was way way way overpriced
2.0,Very disappointed in these socks. Have had them 6 months and 3 pair have gotten holes in the sole. Normal every day wear by my 50 something year old husband so nothing excessive. Not up to par for Skechers at all.
2.0,"It was smaller sizing, loved color"
2.0,"This item is listed as ""over sized"" and it barely fit as a fitted size.<br />Order twice as large if you actually want oversized with this item."
2.0,I sent it back. Top fine but short waisted. Color nice. Skirt made it look maternity.
2.0,Looks very cheap came in a flimsy plastic bag. Was very disappointed when I got mine based on other good reviews and recommendations
2.0,"Nice accessory piece, but the fabric sticks to EVERYTHING."
2.0,"Comfortable, but definitely not suitable for wearing outside the house. Not flattering at all; clings in all the wrong places. But comfy, so keeping as pj's."
2.0,"T Shirt has a cute design, ran big and is 30% polyester & 70% cotton. I’m not a fan of polyester, my fault, I should have read what the shirt was made of. Probably won’t wear it much."
2.0,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!<br />This dress had great reviews so I was excited to try it. First of all, the material is similar to that of an umbrella or a raincoat. It’s not flowy, super stiff, and uncomfortable. Second off, it has an AWFUL chemical smell. All around a horrible purchase."
2.0,"The cap part is way too small, or maybe my head is just bigger. Either way it didn’t fit very well and the quality isn’t great. Kind of disappointed because i was excited for this hat."
2.0,This gown is not made from the cotton flannel I expected.  Not soft and rough.  Not a good buy.<br />Fit also strange.  Not so roomy.  Could not recommend.
2.0,"The cutout style of this bathing suit is very nice and that's why I'm giving it two stars, but everything else is off. The material is cheap and irritated my skin. I couldn't wait to take it off. There was no real support in the bust area. You can't see this from the picture, but the style of the suit is the top is meant to be a bit looser than the bottom part so it's not even fitted all around. This would work if you are much bigger on top with more narrow hips, which is not the common female body type. The tie for the bust doesn't tie tight enough to actually hold you in so maybe size down if you want to give this bathing suit a shot. Overall I cannot recommend this product."
2.0,"This is a very oddly-shaped item. The first thing to note is there is no &#34;give&#34; - it won't stretch at all (not that it should be spandex but most slips have a little give so you don't feel restricted when you walk). This leads me into my next observation which is that if you are hour glass- or pear-shaped I cannot recommend that you buy this product. I bought an XXL expecting it to hang loose (that size tends to be a little big at my waist but work well with my butt/thighs) but it wasn't a specific size issue that made me not want to keep it - the weird thing is, there is no &#34;tapering&#34; to this item - it's just a straight up and down piece of material which means if you are at all curvy, then the slip bunches up between your waist and the top of your thighs with a lot of excess material - if you are shaped like me you will know the issue I am describing."
2.0,"Style is not as its pictured. Totally dufferent , somewhat smaller though."
2.0,"Very beautiful , But it broke my arm out in a rash"
2.0,"Besides the sizing, I did not like the way the elastic is sewn at the waistband. It is not basted down so it becomes an awkward loose belt. I wish I had skipped this purchase."
2.0,"It was way big. Beautiful but, it was long."
2.0,Received through Vine for an honest review.<br />Received size 2X but runs small.  Measurements are that of a standard US Large.<br />Design is somewhat misrepresented.  Looks like the waffle weave thermal shirts.<br />Not red but more coral red.<br />80 percent polyester. 20 percent algodao.<br />Nicely designed but could use some improvement.
2.0,"Nice material, but these run small and also short in the leg."
2.0,Shirt was cool. Bought for my husband but a 2xl fit like a large. Returned and got a 3 xl and it fit about the same. Also 100% cotton. Would have shrunk more. Disappointed because it was a Christmas gift.
2.0,very uncomfortable as a mask. I had to do a lot of modifications to make it work. The band it comes with is this super tense rubber band material and wore out after a couple of months of consistent use.
2.0,The color wasn't the same as pictured. Too peachy...
2.0,"First day wearing and turned finger green ! It's beautiful, BUT."
2.0,looks really cheap
2.0,"These are super cute and fit perfectly but the down side is all of the pairs I have purchased, three different colours now. The hem on all three have come out within one wear. So have had to take all three to the Alterations store to fix."
2.0,Insole was uncomfortable. The memory foam made  your feet unstable
2.0,Not as long as it is pictured! Guess I got what I paid for!
2.0,I was really hoping these would work especially since sending them back is hard when you live overseas.  I read the site again and again as I tried to choose the correct size by using the measurements listed.  They were very tight in the legs which was surprising from how they look in the picture.
2.0,"Huge- couldn’t wear as they kept falling off my nose, and I wear a larger size of sunglasses."
2.0,"I ordered 2 pairs of size 8-9. Only one pair was the correct size. That said, these slippers are attractive, but they are not durable."
2.0,Now I will start by saying maybe I misread something about measurements but these did not fit at all. They would hardly go past my knee and when I did get them to my thigh they just rolled down. They wouldn't even stay up long enough to snag a cute picture at the least. Im rating it a 2 because for others with smaller legs maybe it would work but not for me.
2.0,As many have stated actual product had much smaller graphics than what is pictured.  Material is comfortable but looks dumb with tiny graphics.
2.0,Item was described as ladies size large. After trying on it felt like the description should have said youth or child. The return was easy and promt.
2.0,Says sterling silver but it turns my finger green
2.0,"Nothing to say about quality (although packaging really ruins the horn) but this thing are WAY TOO big for any girl, making them difficult to use around the house."
2.0,Wasn't the fabric I was looking for but a very nice gown
2.0,"Tight in arms as well as short, other than that nice fabric"
2.0,I didn’t like the fit and they had a really strong chemical smell that won’t wash out.
2.0,Just take your favorite wallet and put foil in it and call it a day. That's all these RFID wallets are doing.
2.0,I don't really like these.  I never wear them because they do not fit.
2.0,WejThis item was advertised as a sweatshirt but it was barely thicker in a T-shirt. I had to order it three times before I got the one that was had the correct wording on it.  When it arrived it fit on the small side.
2.0,"Kind of cute, but very cheap looking. And yes, they were cheap!"
2.0,"As soon I open the box and tried to open the wallet, the little tab that you push to spring the wallet open, broke off. Because it is such a small piece, it can't be repaired."
2.0,"Cute, but only one or two of the snaps worked. Quality isn't there for the price."
2.0,This product was way to small. They were a gift for my niece and she is a size 3-4 and she couldn't get them over her hips. There was no give in the material at all. If you order these jeans order up a size or two.
2.0,"First things first- This is costume apparel.  It's not a decent pair of sunglasses.  While it will block the sun, there's no polarization.  They're simply meant to look cool.  You should only order these if this is your goal.<br /><br />My pack of 3 arrived, and I opened the package to see that only 2 of the 3 were in functional condition.  The third pair was bent WAY out of whack, the one arm angled far out of its normal range of motion (I'll upload a pic to the product photos soon).  The other two pairs were in decent condition, and here's my thoughts on those.<br /><br />-The mirroring is enough that someone won't be able to see your eyes, but it is not as mirrored as other $3-$5 pairs I've had.  Viewed from the front with some back light, you can see through them.  This is good and bad at the same time... you can see more in darker light, but in bright light you'll be able to see through the mirroring from the outside.<br /><br />-The frame construction is surprisingly solid.  They're really not all that flimsy like I had expected them to be for the price.<br /><br />-The nose pads are pretty far apart by default.  You can bend them back in, or the glasses will just sit very close to your face.<br /><br />-The arms are a little bit short for me.  I don't know if I have a large face, but they could suffer to be a bit longer, in my opinion.<br /><br />-Mine did NOT come with individual cases/bags for each.  Just the 3 sets of sunglasses in a box.<br /><br />Overall, the price would be great for 3 with carry bags.  However, I only received 2 in working condition and NO cases. If I had been buying a 2-pack, I would have considered other options.  For costume apparel, they're really not too bad, and were all of them in working order when arriving, I'd probably think they were a good deal. However, my results were very inconsistent with the product being shown here and you should take caution accordingly."
2.0,They slide down as a result a blister developed.
2.0,"Both sets were tangled. One was just knotted together - the other was not only knotted together, but knotted on each chain. What a pain."
2.0,Sizes definitely run small. I wear a small to medium shirt and this is skin tight. I would definitely go a size up.
2.0,This band doesn't stay closed. It keeps opening on my wrist. It looks cool but I took if off my watch face because of this issue.
2.0,"The color and pattern are right on. I ordered an XL, I like my clothes a little looser however this dress fits snug. I'm 5'5&#34; 170lbs. This dress is too short in the back. I can't even pick up my two year old without my hiney playing peekaboo."
2.0,Poor quality.  The color and material are like a man's under shirt!
2.0,"Not for full figured mature women, very small"
2.0,"I know this shirt is cheap, but it's not even worth what I paid for it. My biggest complaint is I ordered a size up and it is STILL so tight around the shoulders/back that it is beyond restricting. I don't even want to know how bad it'd fit if I ordered the correct size. I can't wear it out because it's so tight it made it hard to drive. Super disappointed."
2.0,"not well made and the metal part is cheap,,,,<br />do not buy it,,,,go to unicef"
2.0,"This dress was really pretty. The top was much too full and I had to take it in. I wore it once, washed in cold water, hung it dry and the green from the flowers bled all over the white of the dress. Very disappointing, one wear dress I guess!"
2.0,"Worn 4 times, 2 buttons have come off build quality not worth price."
2.0,"This item is nothing like the pictures, fabric quality and color included. The pictures portray this as more of a burnt orange. The actual item is a BRIGHT orange, like a traffic cone. The fabric is extremely cheap looking and it fits smaller than expected. Save your money on this one."
2.0,Runs about two sizes too small.
2.0,This skirt is thin and cheap material.  Completely transparent.  Not worth the cost
2.0,did not work for me.
2.0,Very oddly shaped and extremely see through.
2.0,if your face not huge this sunglasses  not good for you<br />it is huge<br />(made in china)
2.0,"I looked all over for a pair of leggings that wouldn't attract lint or pet hair. I have 2 long haired cats. It's impossible not to have their hair on me. There was a question answered by the company saying there is ""no problem with lint"". So I ordered a pair of black ones. Wish I never would have bought. I can never wear these leggings. They're velcro. Do not buy unless you plan on walking around with a lint roller 24/7. Even then, that won't work entirely. The hair and lint gets trapped into the fabric of these leggings. Not worth any of the trouble. Ruins the whole pair for me. I'll most likely throw them out."
2.0,Too bulky and too long for petite people. I like the attached belt.
2.0,"Cant use the belt, hook pattern on the outside of the belt is the same as my duty belt, so it doesn’t stick."
2.0,"Not true to size, falls off when you walk."
2.0,These fit right everywhere but the waist and they’re so cute it’s very disappointing :( for reference I am 5’2 and 105lbs. I ordered the XS. Will be returning
2.0,Way smaller than expected. Going to give to my granddaughter
2.0,The rings are all the same size including mid finger rings which kept falling off. The rings stained my fingers green the first time i wore them.
2.0,I'm returning this shirt. It's cute but in the picture is loose and long enough to wear with a pair of leggings. It's not. It's extremely tight (I wear a medium usually) and barely goes past my waste. Very disappointed 😞
2.0,After wearing them for about a week I felt that the arch support (the reason I purchased) was no longer there
2.0,I purchased the light grey looking one. As you can see in my pic it is not the color advertised. What I got is a dark grey color. I wanted the link ght grey one which is advertised. Other than that it fits just right
2.0,The dress was really cheaply made. The fringe was falling off and the beading on the back was not matching the front. It also ran really big.
2.0,"I'm giving this watch two stars. The overall quality is not that good. In the picture(s) the watch looks way sturdier than the product I received. The watch itself has a dial that looks like it's made by colored aluminum foil. The numbers protruding on the circumference of the watch, don't really know why they're there besides the label &#34;Tachymeter&#34; in the upper-right hand side of the watch's face. Yes, I can the label fits its description quite well: the whole setup is &#34;tachy.&#34; The three inner-dials do not work (as reported in the description), but what I have to say about this feature is that the numbers are painted on... they're not even inserted dials that don't work—they're just painted numbers that don't work that are surrounded by gold-aluminum foil. The band is too shiny for it's own good (it makes the wearer standout like a sore-thumb, in a bad way (if there ever was a thing as a &#34;good&#34; sore thumb)). The band came wrapped in saran wrap as well. I don't really know what they were trying to protect. The box the watch came in was overall a very high-quality box, the best I can say about this entire watch buying experience. Didn't really wear this watch and washed my hands with it to see if it was waterproof, I just want to return it immediately as soon as I got it. But that's what I get for buying a cheaply made watch with the back label &#34;Made in China.&#34; Do yourselves a favor and pickup a watch at Walmart, Target, Gap, or a Sears (you could probably fetch a better deal since they're all going out of business soon). The buckle itself is as described by my description. It's like a belt-buckle. After fumbling with it, you learn that it closes around one's wrist exactly how one's mother would too tightly buckle one's pants.<br /><br />Oh, one last thing, it came with no batteries."
2.0,Thought it was larger
2.0,The material is cheap and clingy
2.0,Fit is off. Doesn't drape properly.
2.0,"my daughter really loved this dress and was hoping to wear for Confirmation. It fit perfect everywhere, however every time we ordered, it came with a discoloration on the white top. Looks like the black from the skirt rubs against the white top in the packaging and discolors it. It’s unfortunate; we had to return this twice now."
2.0,The dress is lovely but does not fit the way I expected it to fit. The skirt portion is a little too large but I will adjust it to fit accordingly
2.0,Product runs very small stay cautious when purchasing
2.0,"I was certain once I ordered this T-shirt that men would be powerless to resist me. Cats are stealthy, graceful, and mysterious. I was under the impression that once I donned this post-modernist masterpiece, that men would associate me with those qualities. Sadly that has not been the case. However, even though men don't stare at my breasts (as hoped), I noticed that cats do, so at least I am getting some attention."
2.0,These pants are cute and fit as expected. But they are pantyhose material. I bought them as PJ pants but would definitely not use them as such.
2.0,Loved the purse when I first got it. But now less than 5 months later the handles are coming apart. So disappointed.
2.0,"The socks were to small for me definitely Asian clothing size, and the color printing was pretty far off of the image on the display, probably should have expected it though product didn't have many review and no stars. Would have loved if the product had been clearer in the discription of what it was."
2.0,"These shoes fit fine, but are so ugly in person! They look decent online but in person I just couldn't handle the hideousness. I had to return them."
2.0,"2 stars because I bought it for my daughter and her BFF. Except the ones that were delivered said “friend” and “friend” no best to be found. Super annoying. Luckily, they’re only 4 and can’t read."
2.0,Agreed doesn't look anything like the photos. First off my biggest issue with it is the color. The original photo shows a muted pink and I got a really bright pink. And in general as a woman I hate pink. So I needed the muted pink. Next the fit is all wrong. Too fitted and the bottom helm is not present in this cardigan. It's more like an ugly sweater than a cardigan.
2.0,Those wide shoes are loose on 11 month boy. Have to return.
2.0,Purchased them last year and used them around christmas time. Looked good.<br /><br />Put them back this time and it rained. the antlers didnt last few hours of overnight rain.
2.0,"After just a few hours of wear (nothing crazy, just to work in the library!) the design is already cracking. Super disappointed. The ""sweatshirt"" is really just a nice long sleeve T-shirt, but it fits well and is soft. Can't imagine what it will look like after being washed."
2.0,The mushroom didnt last but 10 minutes on my neck i had to use superglue to put it back together
2.0,I bought this for a white party but the dress is not white it’s ivory almost a light yellow. So disappointed! The fit and length are good but it should not be described as white.
2.0,"Sadly, I returned them.  They were my first pair of padded bike shorts to try.  They fit so awkward.  Of course it feels like a diaper under your rear end.  The leg was tight at the bottom near the knee, weird.  They were also pretty tight!  I’d rather use my regular leggings and a padded seat until I find some better shorts."
2.0,"Priced much higher than many other ear plugs, I was hoping for the Rolls Royce of ear plugs.  I bought late at night-no connecting tie so easily dropped or separated and definitely not that much thicker or better than the five dollar ones I have.<br /><br />A poor value; I could not recommend."
2.0,Nothing special.... I was just hoping they had more cushion
2.0,"Not the best silver buy on Amazon.  Some pressure/work marks are visible on the earring under the plating, and the scale is somewhat awkward for everyday wear.  For a very casual, jokey New Year's Eve or Mardi Gras where you don't want to risk losing anything valuable, this might be OK.  I'd give this one a miss."
2.0,Super soft and fits so comfy.
2.0,"Cute top. First wear it was soooo cute Fell apart after the first wash. Completely ripped at the lace. Oh well, you get what you pay for!"
2.0,These were too small for use on a blouse!
2.0,I only got 22 pieces
2.0,"Everyone I hand wash them,  the dye runs everywhere.  Ruined the gray pair I bought with these because the blue stained the gray.<br />Not happy about that. Stained my shirt in the rain too."
2.0,"These are way too roomy to offer good compression.  I ordered a S/M (size 6.5 shoe, 17.5"" calf, 10"" ankle) and the foot & ankle area is just like wearing a regular sock with too much material at the toes.  The calf area does offer a little better compression but still not as much as is needed to help with circulation and swelling issues.  The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is that they do appear to be well made quality material."
2.0,"Much too short for me and the waist didn't hit right for my body. I'm 5'2"" for reference"
2.0,"Measurements were for the outside size of the sunglasses, not for the size of the glasses they would be worn over.  Perfectly fine for regular sunglasses with a very nice case, but didn't work for me a wear-over glasses."
2.0,"One of them got tangled and frayed after only one use. Some of the clips fall off from the ends, and it's hard for a child to clip them onto a mask. I guess they are okay for the money. My kids seem to like using them."
2.0,"It’s ok. Runs a little small. Cut is not at all like I expected. Fits like a basic tube skirt, just with a curved hem. I thought it would be more loose."
2.0,"I kept them, but was very disappointed. The only thing sterling about these earrings is the ear wires. Probably should’ve read the wording in the description a little better. They are “Hilltribe” in design only, not material. The sterling silver earring in the picture is for comparison."
2.0,"I expected the earrings to be clearer so that the gold pieces could shine through, but instead its dull"
2.0,Cute piece for the price but the &#34;gold&#34; changes to bronze after one wearing. Would not recommend for sensitive skin!
2.0,"I bought this controller to test a PS4 game in development on a PC. It was not recognized even by DS4 for Windows. I saw the light and bought a Sony, which worked perfectly."
2.0,"The Packers emblem literally wore off in less than 10 days. And although I registered for the warranty, the company wanted me to jump through hoops for a replacement. Won’t purchase again."
2.0,"as advertised. it is lightweight.  with just little use, the metal hatch scratches easily.<br />**UPDATE** I liked the idea of this watch band, it's light weight, black on silver, but what i hate about this is the links use micro screws as pins. well, what happens with only screws? the screw jostled loose and the link fell apart! it should either come with lock-tite, or just regular pins."
2.0,It is way lighter than I had expected. Not even worth it to use as a sweater jacket. More like a dressing robe just without a waist sash.
2.0,"Material felt a little cheap. Top half fit okay, bottom half was too tight. I’m 5’4, 38 DD, size 14 in bottoms. hope this helps others."
2.0,This dress was beautiful but my only complaint is that the sash and the dress straps are two completely different colors (one gold and the other more like light brown or tan).
2.0,"I figured for a penny, why not?  Well, first of all, the shipping was almost $8 -- and even still, I thought, &#34;how bad can they be for $8?&#34;.  I got my answer... pretty bad.  The &#34;real gold plated posts&#34; look like yellow paint.  I don't just mean &#34;yellow paint&#34; either.  I mean the stuff they paint center lines on the highway with yellow.  UGLY!  I'd return, and might try to, but if I have to pay return shipping, I'll keep them for next Christmas' White Elephant gift exchange.  Oh, the stones?  Yeah, the only thing uglier than that highway yellow paint job, is the cheap and over-sized blob of glass.  Save your $8.01, I promise you won't regret it!!"
2.0,Very disappointed that it does n ot hold many credit cards😕
2.0,"This dress looks amazing and Elegant in pictures, but is just plain is cute but not for a formal occasion. I ordered it for a wedding ""not"". Nothing to do with  the pictures looks like one of my favorite sweater with sparkles one of  my daily use. I'll use it for Thanksgiving dinner...."
2.0,Thinner than I had hoped and really long.
2.0,AL momento de recibir la pulcera pensé que seria mejor calidad pero  no. No me gusto para nada
2.0,It's a good fit but the material is cheap.
2.0,I received the product and they were used. The package has been opened and there were water stains on the lenses.
2.0,Not that great.
2.0,Not worth $15.00
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:470bae44e585704a3cd01a19d87d7e9a]] The product looks amazing. The size was perfect for my son's ipad, laptop, etc....<br /><br />School started in late August & the straps tore apart at the seam by mid September. Funny thing is that NO BOOKS are carried as text books are all digital. And the 2nd strap is going as well. We had to purchase another from a different manufacturer."
2.0,"These are cheaply made but are functional.  One lense was loose and floppy, the other one hard to flip  but my husband adjusted them with an eyeglass tool kit and it worked fine for awhile. It's months since I bought them and they're already in the trash."
2.0,"Well-matched for color & size. Even more reflective than the picture shows.<br /><br />Mine came with a card that says “freshwater pearls” not “Akoya.”<br /><br />So, I’m not really sure that I got what I ordered, or if this is just an error."
2.0,Very uncomfortable to wear. I returned them.
2.0,"Absolutely gorgeous ring! Nice and sturdy, I don't feel like it's going to bend in half. Very true to size which is nice when ordering a ring online. I'm overall extremely happy with my purchase.<br /><br />EDIT: Unfortunately, I am not happy with this purchase at all. Sure, it's a pretty ring. It is definitely NOT 10KT white gold. It's not even sterling silver! I've worn it since I received it in the mail and it's turning my finger green and the plating is coming off from the top, visible part of the ring. Do not buy this product, it's not worth the hassle"
2.0,The material is way too thin. I ordered a size up due to the other reviews and it's still way too small. I gave it to my daughter and it fits her perfectly. She's a girls XL.
2.0,The color changes
2.0,Bags were much smaller than they appear in pictures and they seem cheaply made.
2.0,The material clings to your body so unless you are a size 4 it will show EVER but of belly rolls.  DO NOT BUY
2.0,"Shipment was ok and on time. Item was very large more like an xxl than a large the collar was very wide this item was more like short PJs. I didn't like it, take smaller size to get perfection if ur a jonior."
2.0,I returned them they were much too small
2.0,"I'm 5'9"", 225 lbs, B cup; bought a 3X. These shirts are well made and are fine from the mid breastline down. But across the top from the arm pits, it is tight, which causes it to pull. When I raise my arms the shirt starts to bunch up across the top of my breasts. Weird. Otherwise it flared nice & the fabric is nice. So will be returning."
2.0,"Legs are super long, torso is super short, and cuts me off about two inches above my waist. Not a lot of fabric in the torso to have the off the shoulder look. If I went up a size, the pants would look ridiculous. Overall, not happy about this romper and I’m bummed. I’m 5’4” and a fit 144 lbs."
2.0,"It seemed a little longer in the pictures than it is in real life.  The front ended just under my waist and the back stopped just below my butt.  It is a pretty decent quality.  I am using this for a Halloween costume, but I would not make it part of my wardrobe."
2.0,Very light ring. I was expecting something a bit more substantial due tonits size. The finishing is a bit slopy as well. Ordered one and the stone was cricked. Got a replacement that looks even worse.
2.0,When I ordered a shirt I ordered it as a medium in a Rab as a medium high over it's more like an extra small that even a small way too little for me and I or a medium all my love the bla or a medium all my life
2.0,Button for mask great idea but headband is difficult to put on.
2.0,"The Bracelet itself is very nice but, is incredibly fragile. I only wore it for a week and it broke. All in all, I would recommend this bracelet as a piece to be worn on occasion and not on a day to day basis."
2.0,No photo
2.0,the neckless does not flex. it does not follow the couture of the neckline. to stiff.
2.0,They’re pretty but definitely too thick for cartilage..
2.0,Chain broke within 3 wears
2.0,"I had them on for 2 hours and they tore. Didn't even bump anything, they just tore. I only give them 2 stars because they fit perfectly."
2.0,I’m not at all happy with this bag!! It says that it’s grey but it’s in fact a bluish color and it smaller the it seems! It’s a pain to have to send it back but I think I’m going to do just that!!! Not happy at all!!
2.0,"The ""stones"" where mostly glass.  And a decent amount of the cords came broken or broke as soon as they where worn or the slightest bit of tension and they break. Pretty frustrating. Even for the price I expected a little better"
2.0,"Description says model is 6ft, and picture shows length to his knees. I ordered the largest size after reading comments and this coat barely reaches my butt. I’m 5ft 9, athletic build with muscular arms, sleeves are very form fitting and tight. Love the look of the coat but was expecting something similar to the pictured example I.e. a long robe like hoodie. As it stands it looks like a baggy cardigan. Would be nice also if it had buttons to cinch it up, it does not. Will keep but buyer beware runs very small."
2.0,Exactly what i wanted but broke after the first week
2.0,I ordered the size I always wear in axle jeans. Tried them on fit ok a little lose. So after I wash these for the first time the fit was great.  For about an hour after that they just stretched and stretched and stretched. Never experienced anything like that with a pair of jeans. So now that they’ve been washed I can’t send them back. So I tried them a few times with a belt of course. And they just stretched out everywhere in the legs everywhere they just got extremely baggy. So I turned them into work pants. To do that I cut an inch and a half out of each side of the waist line right at a belt loop overlaid them and so them back together Then I started at the bottom of the pants leg outside seam and sewed it up from the bottom to the top at the top taking nearly 2 inches off the hip area on both sides before I made them fit right. I don’t do much sewing but hey my job turned out very good. I wear them to town sometimes but they make really nice looking work pants. So yeah I would stay away from these kind of axel jeans or buy them about five or six sizes small which is not going to work so I just say no unless you don’t mind a sewing project.
2.0,You get what you pay for sometimes<br />This was too good to be true
2.0,Crystal are not secure.  But I bought another set.
2.0,Runs very very small. Order 2 sizes up.
2.0,Product was returned to seller because the quality was not as picture online. Blue colour on the bottom fades into white when stretch
2.0,I am not happy cuz I had high hopes and it came broken
2.0,Too many fibers fall off during wash. Cannot clean it even washed many times.
2.0,Not ticking
2.0,"This was nice for the first few times I used it, then it broke."
2.0,"What I ordered: Alimens & Gentle 100% Cotton Regular Fit Short Sleeve Casual Hawaiian Shirt for Men<br />What I got: 65% Cotton, 35% Polyester.<br />DO THE MATH."
2.0,"The sleeves should be bigger. As is, you can feel the seam. Cheap material"
2.0,The hat itself is a good buy as far as quaint however it was crinkled up and I can't get the wrinkles out of the top of the hat which is very noticeable.
2.0,"I'd probably really like this...if I could wear it.  I can't get the darn thing in!  I've never worn one of these bone studs before, I didn't realize it would be that difficult to get in.  I even tried to &#34;lube&#34; it up with some neosporin.  Maybe that's a little TMI - but - whatever, we're all friends here, right??  It did not work.  I guess it's a good thing so it doesn't come flying out of your face.<br /><br />I will still periodically try for coerce this thing in my nose...  I will update the review in the event that I am actually successful."
2.0,"The dress was way too small and it was an instant return as it couldn't even be put on.  However, it was able to be returned and without any issues.  While the dress itself wasn't satisfactory, the customer service was actually amazing.  I would order from this company again!"
2.0,I really like the design of the bag and plenty of pockets but one of the zippers broke the first time I used it. Really disappointing
2.0,"I ended up returning this. The top was quite short and boxy, and the material was a shiny spandex. It was not what I was expecting."
2.0,the ring was way longer than photographed. And it was hard to get the shape right since it was so flat in shipping. I returned product.
2.0,Theses are really big. Can I return them?
2.0,I’m a Tom’s fan and loved the look of these boots. The soles however were made of some kind of hard plastic-like material that made them very slippery even on carpet. I returned them and am sad.
2.0,Disappointed with these. Out of the forty I received 10 did not even light up. Shipping was on time and the ones that work are nice and bright to bad 1/4 of them are broken.
2.0,"i'm a true 2x sz in shirts but this style runs small, clings at the waiste"
2.0,"Upon receiving this item, I was very excited. It was super pretty, delicate, and exactly what I wanted. Looks-wise, it was 5 stars. Unfortunately, it broke the first day I wore it. I was moving a chair and the chain just snapped. I didn't even feel a tug of any sort that it would have gotten caught. I have never broken jewelry in my life and am always completely careful, so that just goes to show how delicate this bracelet is. Unless you're going to be mindful of the bracelet 24/7 and have large enough wrists where it wouldn't dangle at all and get caught, I probably wouldn't purchase this item."
2.0,I went to put the band on for the second time and it won’t lock onto the watch. One of those three little things on the band is missing so now the band is useless.
2.0,Don't like the shape after opening
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress, but it was a wee bit too big in the bust/armpits and you could see the Jockey Skimmies I was wearing underneath. I tried two different sizes and colors.  Returned."
2.0,"I had a feeling these were too good to be true. I ordered my normal waist size (32) and it fit fine without belt. But the pant legs are absolutely massive, reminding me of the ultra thick, long, and baggy pants worn by firefighters. I’m 5’8” with a somewhat athletic build and it would take a LOT of alterations to make these not look like clown pants on me. It’s always a gamble buying clothes online, but I’m within the return window so no harm done."
2.0,"This product fits LARGE. I ordered the smallest size possible and I still have to pin it so it stays on! It also is cheaply made— every time I wear it, some of the sequins fall off. The price wasn’t bad, though, and it does look just as pictured."
2.0,"The pictures looked great and as this was a Vine 'purchase' for me, the price was right.  I used this as an 'add on' Christmas gift for my wife.  The good thing is, it fits as expected.  And initially it looks good - not as good as the pictures, but good.  The colors are nice, and a bit unusual so that makes it eye-catching in a good way.  What isn't eye catching in a good way is the lack of a hem, and roughness in the cut so that - at least in the one we have - it doesn't look particularly even at the bottom.  Given that this is about $30, I wouldn't have expected a high end skirt, but I think some rudimentary quality control could have been expected."
2.0,"It's overall great except that the compasses don't work. We bought a few and all 4 have totally different compass reads. If you need this for the compass, don't get it. If you want it for the rest of the benefits, I would recommend it."
2.0,I have washed this robe 3 times and it is still producing a ton of lint. The lint comes off in chunks and gets on everything.<br />Very disappointing.
2.0,THEY STARTED TURNING TWO DAYS AFTER I GOT THEM
2.0,"The chain looks good, but the moment I took a shower with it on, it started getting kind of itchy on my neck!! Maybe I can waterproof it somehow to stop that ""reaction"".<br /><br />If you have sensitive skin I wouldn't buy it."
2.0,They get &#34;runs&#34; in them very easily!
2.0,Socks slide off the heel and they dry out my feet. Do not recommend.
2.0,Bought two pairs two different colors and within a week one arm from both glasses broke off.<br />Not made with good qualify hardware however the plastic is fine and the lenses were okay.
2.0,"This dress was pretty and the colors were vibrant. however the material was horrible and didn't fit like it does on the model with the bottom flowing it fit all the way down and I just didn't get it, had the material been less heavy it would have be great and I wear a 24 and ordered the 5x and it still did not fit right. typically I wear 2x or 3x but for me not be able to wear a 5x speaks volume as to what you will be getting when you order this dress especially if you are plus size. Not to mention I am small in the waste with wide hips"
2.0,"broke after a while, not very strong loop"
2.0,Cheap but I guess I didn't expect much in this price range.
2.0,So I ordered a medium and I received either a large or x- large.  The cut of the dress is so-so.  It appeared to be sewn together at the last minute.  The design and floral motif are the saving grace.  Also one of the holes for the button was not open and had to cut it myself.  I have to pay more money to have it altered to my size ... 😕
2.0,The shirt is like a crop top not a full length shirt like the picture. I got the 7-9 size for my 6 year old who is small and skinny. It probably wouldn't fit if she were any older.<br />The shirt is cut short like a crop top
2.0,"Dress fit fine, but quality was very poor. I got a size medium and I am 5’7 and 135 pounds, size 34B. It wasn’t loose, wasn’t just average but flimsy so I couldn’t tell if it was a good fit. Extremely thin material. Wrinkles easily. Cheaply crafted, which I expected for the price. The puff sleeve is not anywhere close to the volume of the photo. It has very minimal puffiness. The color is not as vibrant yellow either."
2.0,The picture on one earring was a reflection of the other... So backwards... Unfortunate...
2.0,They are extremely small.
2.0,It's a good band if you dont have an active lifestyle. I've had mine 3 months and I've had to change my band cause it was falling apart. Ots super cute though
2.0,way way to small
2.0,"I am a size 4 petite and have been for many years.  I purchased a size S (small), however, when I put on these pajamas, the top was nice but fit me like a size medium or large and I can live with that. The bottom (pants) was very snug at the waistline. I took the pants apart at the waist and measured the elastic band and it was 24"" - from where is was sown together it measures 22"". According to the size chart, a small waistline measurement is shown to be 26""/27"". My waist measures approximately 24"". I'm not a seamstress, but I do know how to sew enough to be able to redo the waistline (that I will do instead of returning them since I did take the pants apart at the waistline).  I do like the fabric, it's soft and feels wonderful. Also, I really like the color.  Unless you have a 22"" or smaller waistline, I would not recommend these pajamas in a size S."
2.0,Too much poof at the waist.  Makes one appear heavier than they are.  Returned it
2.0,"The bag itself is great, looks great, works great and is stylish- but within a matter of a month the straps became undone and the stitching falling apart. Just review all the pics that show the poor stitching on the handles. If you want a bag that last a month or two go for it. But the return period is only two week window"
2.0,Keeps time well but the chain is worthless.
2.0,I’m a size small (100 lbs 5’5”) fit is baggy. The color was as expected however around the mid section and in the breast area this dress was very baggy. I was hoping for a fitted dress but had to return.
2.0,"Thought sports glasses should protect from wind and dust, these dont."
2.0,I like the purse but just wish that this inside was cloth instead of a cheap plastic
2.0,Nice sweater awful gold zipper.<br />Should be a silver zipper.<br />The zipper zips rough and catchy.<br />Woukd like to return
2.0,"Wire for the speaker embedded inside is not that long so the beanie stays fairly tight on your head.  Also, this is more for winter use.  I bought it because I thought it would be a thin material and I could wear it to the gym... BIG mistake..."
2.0,Sent back... leather started cracking in one day's time.
2.0,Bow was broken
2.0,"Narrow at the shoulders, chest, and sleeves, shapeless at the waist. A very strange design. Not for my figure. If you have large breasts and a thin waist, this is not for you. The fabric is of high quality, but it is dark khaki, not apricot."
2.0,It's my own fault. I should have checked on size instead of just assuming that a men's handkerchief would be large like your normal handkerchiefs you buy in any store. These are so small you can't even tie them around your face or head. I suppose they're fine for blowing your nose once or twice. I gave them two stars because at least the patterns are pretty.
2.0,I can't under
2.0,I have been through 2 rings since receiving them. The stones fall out of the settings..
2.0,Not as wide as described. I would not recommend these.
2.0,"So I bought these because they say that they're 100% cotton in the listing but once I received them and checked, they are actually 95% cotton and 5% ""other fibers."" I don't want to seem THAT picky but my daughter gets rashes with even small amounts of certain materials. I also ordered a 2T and the tag states 2T-3T and are a full 3 inches longer than other 2T pants I've ordered. They are cute but since she won't fit them for another year and they could cause a rash, I'm returning them."
2.0,The shirt is short and wide.  Don't love having to pay for returns....
2.0,Overpriced for what it is. Discovered it going for less than half the price in several stores in my area. Nice size brim though. Comfortable to wear.
2.0,"For whatever reason this band didn’t sit comfortably on my wrist, it even left a little sore. I wore it for a couple days and had to get rid of it bc it left a mark on me. The color was so cute, I was disappointed it didn’t work out."
2.0,Looks nice but the charms fall off
2.0,I have a small breed chicken and this was right on her. Also didn’t fit very well. She shook and it bunched up on her back
2.0,Dress was see through and a little snug in the waist. Had to return.
2.0,The hole was too large and would not stay on the elastic
2.0,"It was cute and the price was right, but was too short even in a size up."
2.0,"Bought this shirt for my youngest daughter and she was very disappointed with it as was I. It was said to be oversized in the description and for the most part that is what it looked like it was going to be. Upon its arrival, it was a crop top instead and is not as large as it may seem in the image I have attached. It was very small it could honestly fit my 8-year-old grandchild. Not happy with this at all."
2.0,It digs into your nipples and it's heavy.
2.0,"Ordered the silver stainless steel color and it came in a cheap looking shiny black plated finish. Clasp is difficult to clasp and undo. I won't use it, looks like a dollar store watch band."
2.0,"Still trying to figure out how to use this. Tried to operate push button it goes on, then push again it goes off. Tried holding it down, sometimes only get a 1 second blend, after 4 minutes of creative fiddling trying different patterns of pushing buttons, it finally operates correctly and blends all the way. Don't even know how I did it. Not worth the money, just an expensive toy that operates when it wants to. Nice, if it worked correctly."
2.0,"I read reviews of this dress and ordered the size I would normally purchase in order for the dress to be a bit on the loose/flowy side (L) and when it got here, it fit like a Small! I returned it immediately. No pockets and fit extremely tight the entire length of the dress."
2.0,"The buckle rubs my wrist the wrong way, very uncomfortable."
2.0,"Somewhat happy with these. They do keep the snow and sunlight from hurting my eye, but The clip to attach to glasses are hard to get on, would of been great had they did a flip up then flip down over the glasses. Also really makes it hard since I need my glasses on to see, so when I take my glasses off to put the clip on shades on, it makes it very difficult to see what I'm doing"
2.0,"If I was a betting person, I would say the 'leather' was actually plastic..."
2.0,I bought this pair for Christmas gift my 2 year old so he could wear them as soon as he outgrew his other Billy pairs. He wore it 3 times and the zipper broke. This is the 2nd of the 3 pairs I have bought where the zipper broke like this. It’s disappointing because the shoes are pretty expensive. The shoes are very functional and makes it easy to wear AFOs I just wish they were more sturdier.
2.0,"They are adorable, but I was hoping the squishy paws would be comfy to walk around in and they are not."
2.0,Earrings are pretty and light weight but broke at the part that goes in the ear after wearing just a few times
2.0,"I got the medium and it was too loose, for me.  I'm short and it didn't cover a small part of my stomach.  I don't have a big stomach.  I liked that it didn't have the zipper.  I really wanted it to work."
2.0,Hi I am a female that weights 105 pounds and I got a large so that it would be extra roomy but it was so small and uncomfortable but the colors were very nice but not the ironed on logo way to expensive for this price do not recommend
2.0,Like the fact that its pack able but the wrinkles don't fall out. It lost it shape! I would like it better if it retained it shape.
2.0,They are very cute boots but they run narrow and are not very comfortable. I wore them for about 2 hours with an insole.
2.0,Ride up into crack areas and uncomfortable.
2.0,"Could just be me, but the material was not the best quality, feels like the seams it might come apart in the washer. Add to that the neck width - when buttoned it was VERY LARGE. Felt like a deep-v even when buttoned."
2.0,"Does make things look a bit brighter, but seems to make the glare from lights worse."
2.0,I want to cancel my last book order I do not have kindle
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:7fd3e39d125862db8e24c3e8dcc97a19]]Two stars because I like the feel of the material, and it was affordable. But some of the cats look more like rats, and the color is different than the picture. Its more of a bandaid beige-ish color."
2.0,"The posts are too large.  They look nice, however, in order to use them I would need to put new posts on, as the current ones get progressively larger.  I will not be using these."
2.0,The material is very flimsy and seems like it would break easily.<br />The zipper on mine is off and doesn't close entirely. I don't trust that I won't lose something from this little bag.
2.0,The watch is nice the major issue I have with it is that the little piece that goes through the holes in the strap is on on the wrong side and it won’t stay on my wrist cause it falls off due to the plastic not being in the right place. I wasn’t expecting this from such a well known brand such as Casio.
2.0,"I've been using Zimcos for years. I've just pulled them out for my biking seasons, and these are the smallest mediums I've ever bought. They are men's size, the label says medium. This was the only site I found that even had mediums, everybody else only has small or extra large sizes. Way too small to wear, but I purchased them months ago."
2.0,Had to return - The port for my ear buds is too small. So I can't have the cover on if I want to use my ear buds. Quite annoying.
2.0,Definitely bigger than anticipated. It was a beautiful dress though
2.0,"The quality here is...well, what you'd expect.  REALLY low.  I knew I was taking a risk, and it wasn't worth it.  Skip on this one."
2.0,"They look nice and fit well, but the thumb and index finger tip is exactly the same material as the rest of the gloves.  They are not touch screen."
2.0,I wanted to love these. The sizing is not accurate. Runs small.  They are well made although a 3x doesn’t fit me (2x).  I gave them to a friend.
2.0,"This dress is extremely small.  I ordered two sizes up from my normal size (L to XXL) and it's still micro-sized in the bust.  I plan to keep it and wear it with a camisole underneath, but only because I like how flowy the fabric is and because I don't want to deal with the annoyance of returning it.  Buyer beware with these kinds of products--they're never as lovely as one would hope."
2.0,Came broken. The top piece that makes the part you pull and push is broken. Very flimsy not well made
2.0,"Material is scratchy and the fit does not work for me. Bought because I read several reviews that claimed they worked for shorter, larger bottom women. Not really the case. I’m 5’4” and the waist was too high to have the crotch where it should be. You definitely get what you pay for."
2.0,"It's not a bad dress but the top is proportionately built for a shorter frame lengthwise. The skirt portion is long enough but the chest/sleeve/midriff ratio is not much like the size of the dress, and I ordered larger assuming this might be the case. For taller frames the skirt length or elastic center may not matter if the bodice is just plain too short. The length from the armpit to the top of the cinched area that sits under the bust measures a little over four inches."
2.0,Cute but it broke after a couple months. The ring to hold it together bent over time
2.0,"Sometimes it works after great effort, more often not. It’s basically a colored rubber ball with a hole (apparently for air). Was supposed to be “sticky” surface, but isn’t. A disappointment."
2.0,Looks a bit cheaper than the picture
2.0,It was too large to fit into my husbands pocket.  This is the kind of wallet I've been looking for and was sad that I needed to return it.
2.0,The dress is pretty but is not the dress that is pictured.  The beading is completely different and the dress pictured has a halter top.  The dress we received was apparently made in haste.  On one side it has two straps and on the other side it has three.  It is not meant to be asymmetrical.  The skirt of the dress is also different.  The photo shows gathered ruffles.  The dress we received has straight tulle.  We also hoped that the dress would be floor length.  It is about two inches shy of the ground.  My 9 year old daughter is 4'10&#34; tall.
2.0,"I bought my watch assuming it would be able to be resized with links taken out, however once I received it there seemed to be no possible way to remove a single link. Either a faulty product or false information."
2.0,"I ordered two of these a red one which I loved so much that I ordered another one but wanted it to fit a little more loose so ordered next size up. The material showed the same on tag but it was not at all the same. The second one I ordered was awkward and didnt lay on the body, it was lighter and much less figure flattering so I returned it."
2.0,Not easy to adjust length.
2.0,Sizes are way off.  Usually wear a medium or large but in these and XL fits like a small
2.0,"It's cheap material. That's ok, it was inexpensive. The zipper is on the left. Like a woman's hoodie. It works but reminds you how weird it is that men's and women's tops are set up differently."
2.0,"I ordered a few of these shirt a while ago and I really enjoyed them. I decided to purchase three more and ordered a ""Large"" to match the ones I use. When I received the shirts, they were a USA Medium and an international Large. I figured I made a mistake in reading the label and then ordered 3 more as X-Large.<br /><br />When I received those they were USA X-Large and International 2XL. I really don't understand why I am getting the wrong sizes after spending $50 on two orders. I just needed a USA Large. Now I have 3 a size too big and 3 a size too small. Be careful when ordering the correct sizes."
2.0,"The suit did not hold me in very well. It’s great if all you want to do is lay in the sun. However, if you want to live is the suit for the day you might find that “the girls” might fall out. Not my favorite suit."
2.0,"Quality is cheaper than photographed and not as long inside.  Claims 6.3 inches, only 6.125."
2.0,It bothers me how loose this is at the waist.  I may have it taken in.  I ordered the XS and these dresses are supposed to hold you in.  It made my butt look smaller and my waist look bigger.  I might take it in but deciding.<br /><br />I like the color though and overall idea of it... would look great on another body
2.0,The material is weird
2.0,It unraveled and broke three days after wearing it. Only had it less than three weeks and worn it for about three days...
2.0,I love the size and color of this bag. But I have been using it for 3 months and a seam is coming undone on the bag. I have purchased a wallet and lanyard from the same company and the quality was great. Not sure why this purse would come undone.
2.0,The material feels extremely extremely cheap
2.0,"I love the idea of these glasses. They light up well and I got lots of compliments on them at Paradiso. The problem is, if your head isn't the size of a watermelon they will slide right off your head. I used a bunch of foam sports tape to wrap around the entire sides of the glasses and they were still too wide and kept sliding down."
2.0,It's cute....but it broke the 3rd time I wore it  :(
2.0,"I really wanted to keep this dress. However, as another reviewer mentioned, the top part is way too big along the ruffle that runs along the bust line. It needed to be taken in about 2 inches, maybe 3. For reference, I am 5'8, 130lbs, 34C, ordered a small and I couldn't even come close to filling out the top. Everything else was great though, perfect length, nice fabric, and would have suited my needs perfectly except for that one issue."
2.0,"These are very small. I bought them for my 5 and 3 year old. My kids are big for their age, but it was too snug for the 5 year old and was ok on the 3 year old."
2.0,Ordered according to the chart. Should have ordered based on the reviews. To small.
2.0,"Full of knots and melted clumps of links, the chain is dirty and sticky and smells unpleasant on. It also turned my neck a lovely shade of grunge. I know it was inexpensive so I didn't have super high expectations, but I didn't expect it to feel like something off the workshop floor. I plan on replacing the chain myself with something a little less gritty at some point because I love the birds, but until then it's unwearable."
2.0,"More like polyester sandpaper than description’s promise of smooth, especially on the seams.  Unable to wear without an undershirt for comfort."
2.0,"I like the fit though the shoulders are a little narrow. I'm 5'6"", 143lbs and a 32DDD. The medium fit well but dont count on actually unbuttoning the snaps for any reason. It came right out of the fabric and now just gapes."
2.0,It was super cute but the material feels super cheap. You can see my bra/underwear/tattoos through the fabric.
2.0,"Came with loose threads, will be returning."
2.0,"The design of these earrings is fine and the hammered metal look is really pretty and unique as well as that they're easy to put on and take off. The problem comes with the color. I bought a silver-colored pair and alongside the rose gold color, and you can hardly tell the difference. Very disappointed in that. I was hoping that the color would be much more distinct rose gold color."
2.0,"The strap part that goes over the top of the foot is way to large, causing the sandal to be very loose. When you walk, the 'flip-flop' sound caused by it not being snug, is excruciatingly loud."
2.0,Material is not as pictured its shiny.
2.0,Delivery was fast.- excellent. I was frustrated of lot set of archangel because 2 of which were the same!
2.0,Not comfortable and the yellow filter is distracting
2.0,After less than 2 weeks the inside liner had cracked already.
2.0,Decent Phone Case For The Price.
2.0,"I'm a fairly tall and wide person so I assumed I made the right choice in buying this dress in a 5X, boy was I painfully wrong. The material is nice and soft but that's the only good thing about it truly, the dress itself was like a parachute on me, hardly fit, and was waaaay too baggy to actually be worn out anywhere"
2.0,Fabric was so soft. Really wish it were better support. The sides don’t go up far enough so there’s no support or containment. Not smoothing in the back at all. Would have been super comfortable if the structure/design were better.
2.0,So small I had to give it away. I am big (250) and ordered 3XL. Couldn't get my arms in the sleeves comfortably at all and no way it fit in the shoulders! Zip it. Forget it. Not going to happen. I gave to a guy who wears L to XL and it fit him well. Size guide is not American!
2.0,This were very big from the waist
2.0,Sent them back not the best quality
2.0,"I guess I should have read more reviews. I really wanted to like these shorts. The idea of support and shorts in the same package is great for exercise. These shorts are an accident waiting to happen - almost like running in traditional boxers.<br /><br />CONS<br />(1) I order according to instructions (waist in jeans 34) and still these shorts were way too tight across the mid section. Not a problem if you want to show off your privates I suppose. But if you ordered a size large enough to breathe you would have absolutely no support at all.<br />(2) The lining is just plain weird. It's like tight boxers, but not boxer briefs because there is no support. I would have thought that the lining would be attached only at the waist band, like traditional swim trunks or running shorts. These are attached at the waist, the crotch, and the leg - why?<br /><br />PROS<br />(1) It was refundable.<br />(2) Great if you order a couple sizes up and like running in baggy boxer briefs that look like running shorts."
2.0,The material is cotton and easily wrinkled. The material appears cheap. In the photo it looks more high quality
2.0,"What they don't tell you is that this necklace is super long. While it's style would indicate that it should sit on your chest, above your shirt, in fact it sits super low- way past the top of your shirt onto your boobs. That's not a flattering length for this kind of necklace. The necklace itself is very pretty, though. I've made due by tying several knots in the necklace to give it the right length."
2.0,Bent and broken
2.0,"Malliosse Womens Summer Sleeveless High Neck Halter Tank Tops Racerback . This solid-color white cotton/spandex tee-shirt is said to have a racer back.  But it does not.  Furthermore,  its  armholes are  cut too generously. This top is not appropriate for everyday wear; it  must be worn with an  athletic bra, hopefully a prettily  colored one. Recommended hand or machine wash with like colors, cold water, no bleach, hang or line dry. Finally, these sizes run very small, a size which should fit me is skin tight."
2.0,A few diamonds fell out after a few days
2.0,Too furry and huge especially for a medium.
2.0,These are SUPER thin and the colors will bleed in the washer so make sure that you add a color catcher to your load unless you want everything to come out looking awful. if I hadnt already washed them I would be returning.
2.0,I own 4 pawstar hats that I've purchased years ago. This hat is obviously of a much lower quality than my others. The felt is extremely thin as compared to the others and the ears are far to heavy to be supported by the thin felt I used to be a massive fan but this makes me second guess a future purchase.
2.0,Neck hole is way too big. My daughters whole body slides through the whole thing... it's cute though.
2.0,"Had I know that the second glove would not be stretched properly, I would have gotten two pairs of the same glove so that I could give the smaller gloves to a toddler and still be able to have a pair. The second glove was not close to usable, and I was unable to get it stretec enough to even slide it over my ring, middle, and pointer fingers. The second would have only fit a toddler or someone with exceptionally tiny hands. This is the worst purchase I have made, and I am ashamed to have used birthday money from my gran on it. If both gloves had been on cardboard hand displays, this wouldn't have happened."
2.0,"Product arrived on time, package was nice. However you get what you pay for, it's very pretty but looks very cheap. It would be okay to wear maybe out to the club for a night. The chains are really cheap looking.<br /> Just trying it on one of the gems fell off."
2.0,It was smaller than I thought
2.0,"Typical cheap plastic screw togethers, which is pretty typical now days. I have no issues with that, as its what I expected. The image looks just as it should. My issue, is when I first got them, they came apart easily (I always test). When I went to actually use them about a week later, they were fused together! They weren't cross threaded. I tried everything short of using hand tools to get them apart. These things are not coming back apart. If this would have happened when they were in my ear I'd be royalty screwed. I exchanged for a different pair, but I'm honestly nervous af about using them. I've never experienced this before."
2.0,3 stars because it is cute. the skirt fits great the top was way to small and I am a C cup.
2.0,"I would've given these pants a higher score, however, the material is straight SEE THRU! If I was wearing this as a bathing suit cover up, I would give it a 5, however, I wanted these as casual pants for work, so it's completely useless."
2.0,They are cute but they broke as soon as we picked them out of the box. They were supposed to be a birthday present for my daughter's friend. We had to throw them away the day we got them :(
2.0,"Nice tight fitting shirt design, but the brown buttons make the shirt look terrible. It's like wearing a black tuxedo with brown tuxedo shoes."
2.0,"The coat is kind of cute, but is not a heavy coat.  It is ridiculously small.  It was described as a women's coat but is sized for a child.  A 2XX has about a 30"" bust.  It is also not as long as it appears in the product image."
2.0,One belt works the other doesn’t hold.  I have had a click it belt for a couple years and it worked fine until it got old.  I am sending back one for replacement will let you know how customer service is.  The black belt works fine.
2.0,"I wouldn’t recommend this pajama. After 2-3 nights of wearing the color in knees are faded, and it’s stretched out a lot. It’s doesn’t look safe now because my daughter can stumble and fall down."
2.0,"UPDATE: the clasp broke in 6 months' time. It's kinda hard to use something like this without a functioning closure. I'm not happy anymore.<br />I'm taking 2 stars off as a result.<br /><br /> just as described, i can't say how it works with the RFID blocking aspect, but the case itself i like a lot. the clasp seems thin, though, so i am afraid it will break if i don't take care when closing it. holds a fair amount of cards too."
2.0,cute but did not fit at all
2.0,"They are pretty, soft and fit well but holes after first wear."
2.0,"Ordered a small, fit like a Md./Lg."
2.0,"The glasses do not fit any of my regular glasses at all well.  They hang on poorly, fall off easily, and do flip up or down with without my removing the prescription glasses..  So the two stars of for the difficulty of usage.  The color of the lenses is good.  Would give the color more stars."
2.0,I could not get this apron to stay on my hen.  She was able to shake it right off.
2.0,Horrible fit. Think fish net. Worried the color would bleed on me. Sent back
2.0,I did not receive 50 like it says. I only got 40 in the package.
2.0,I don't really know how to reviewthis.  The mask is adorable and came earlier than expected.  Thing is thr filter parts stick to the back ofthe mask with double sided tape.  I will have to finda way to open this up sothe filter part can go inside and won't get rubbed loose by my nose.  Unsure how I am going to do that.
2.0,I bought these for my son because I liked the colors and thought he would as well. On closer inspection I noticed that he wasn't wearing them very often. I asked him why and he said he feels like they were &#34;cheaply made&#34; and have some sort of itchy component to them that is not comfortable.
2.0,It’s like wearing a ski mask and not pulling it down on your face.<br />It needs to be much shorter
2.0,the style of this watch is great. i love the look and the leather band. it should be noted that the two round dials in the center are for appearance only- they're not functional. The quality is not great. The watch stopped working after a couple of months. I tried replacing the battery with no luck.
2.0,"145lb,s, 5’2. Poor quality. Girls with thick thighs beware! They’re pretty tight and roll off easily. They felt like they were cutting off circulation."
2.0,"I bought this in gray and loved it. The green one is totally different. The material on the gray one is thick, warm, and knit. The green one I received was stretchy, thin, and more shiny-spandex-like. It hung longer and the zipper for the pocket was very visible, not hidden, which was the whole point of the pocket for me. Returned it. Very disappointed. I wear the gray one almost every day at the moment and was hoping to have another color just like it.<br /><br />I will say the stitching seemed well done and it was polished-looking. It just wasn’t at all what I was expecting based on the other color version."
2.0,"I ordered the black and white strip and the grey and white stripe. Both are very cute, god quality, but will likely not fit as long as I had hoped. HOWEVER I distinctly ordered black and white for a Halloween costume and it’s 100% navy. No doubt about it. I should’ve read the reviews more closely. I won’t be ordering a replacement, as apparently even when you do that it’s still navy. The shirts are cute and I’ll keep them regardless. I’m just angry I still have to go out and find a black and white striped shirt for Halloween."
2.0,"I had to get a size 12 in Amanda pull on jeans, and they are quite tight after being laundered. The Avery size 12s are MUCH bigger. I will return them if possible. Size 10 was not available. AARGH!"
2.0,Perhaps they can fit a size 8..<br />I’m a 10.5 and am suffering.
2.0,"very pretty, but ridiculously long as well as nowhere near an extra-large.  XL approx. a size 12, compared to my many sizes of clothing."
2.0,The charm fell off of the keychain and got lost forever.
2.0,Poor quality. Fraying after one wash.
2.0,"This is so thin and cheaply made it's going to fall apart after the first wear. There is practically no under layer, there is only one layer of poorly stitched rainbow fabric, and it's poor quality ""tulle"". Definitely not worth almost $50. Will be returning."
2.0,i have waited very long for these earrings and it is very disappointing to see the cheap quality .
2.0,"Manufacturer assured me these were the thin socks they sent me last year.  Well, they aren't.  Too thick.<br />I'm sure for folks that want a thick wool sock, there are great. My needs are for a thin merino wool sock."
2.0,"I don’t know, this just didn’t really look like the picture. It look like I had a poncho on. And the color wasn’t the greatest either."
2.0,Had a horrible chemical smell to it when it arrived.
2.0,Way to small maybe good for kids
2.0,I have bought this style in a different design but same size small. This dress fit totally differently.  Very tight and short.
2.0,"The crystals fell off very quickly, w\o even wearing it out!"
2.0,"These are really cute but they run slightly smaller than expected, also expected them to be longer but they were laid right around the waist area"
2.0,It's way too big for me. Sorry that I bought it.
2.0,Luce muy grande.. tiene la forma de un gorro de chef.. no muy bonito para mi parecer! Devuelta a la tienda!
2.0,"My skin had a reaction from the cheap material used. When in, the earrings don't look flimsy, the print is uneven. Looks like an 8 year old made this with a button press and I feel bad because that statement is unfair to 8 year olds."
2.0,"One sided earrings that sit parallel to your jaw line don’t make sense. The way these earrings are worn, they should be “finished” on both sides since both sides can be seen while wearing."
2.0,"This is probably the most different of all the ones I’ve tried. I wouldn’t mind the design probably if it does its job of keeping my extra bulges tucked in and controlled. Unfortunately, this does not do that job. It is high waisted but the material is too soft so  that it does not shape your hips and waist. I am so disappointed with its performance.  The curve design in the front just emphasizes the belly which is the last thing I need. It will probably look good with those who already have a flat belly (I am working on it!!).  When I tried it on, my son exclaimed that he can see everything and if I should wear it, the tops should come down to the thighs. A little bit embarrassing when I did not realize how see through it was.<br /><br />The length was another problem. I thought it would only come up to the shin and not to the ankle. This one did and I still have to fold up the seams as it is all crunched up in the ankle to make it more comfortable.  I totally feel naked and sagging everywhere and that is not a good feeling. Maybe when I am successful in my workouts I just restarted."
2.0,Hay que pedir un size mas grande
2.0,Price was nice but I wish I could return. Didn't care for material at all. Now it's just sitting around collecting dust. I guess you can't win them all.
2.0,"I really like the style of this dress, but the fabric is very thin and super clingy.  Unfortunately, the dress is going back."
2.0,very tight in the waste. I kept it but it is def. tight. in the waste I say size up ladies
2.0,"Too short, bad material."
2.0,"This ring is beautiful and actually, for the price, is decent quality. The stones, especially the light blue one, are beautiful and the detail is very nice. I have gained a bit of weight so it was snug on my finger, which is my fault, and I now know what size to get from here on out. What I do not like about the ring is the leaves that stick out from the sides rub on the inside of your other fingers which makes it uncomfortable to wear. The leaves are a bit pointed and so I was constantly thinking about the ring. I was hoping to build a collection of rings that I wear regularly and this was the first one I chose due to how pretty it is. In the end I gave it away due to it be too snug and uncomfortable."
2.0,These were way too narrow and I had to return them.
2.0,My set did not come with a filter as advertised. Instead there was a piece of rubber for which its use is a mystery to me. While the mask is comfortable and washable I still want the filter.
2.0,If worn daily the elastic wears out  very quickly and no longer provide support. They lasted about half as long as the ones  I got at the pharmacy.
2.0,"I am 5’6”, 143 pounds, wear a medium so ordered a medium, the belly is covered, however, it rolls, and does not stay firm and tight. And clearly not butt lifting. I have a bit of a booty, and these made me look a bit flat in the booty area. Not satisfied nor happy with these at all."
2.0,"This is not the quality dry wicking material that Nike shirts are typically made from. My husband and sons own many Nike shirts, and this was nothing like those. We returned it"
2.0,"Great fit, attractive print, BUT the fabric pills. I should have returned this but I needed it for an event. Not sure if all the dresses have the same fabric. This review is for the LEOPARD BLACK."
2.0,I bought these for my son (size 8 toddler) this summer. The stitching and Velcro started ripping apart within weeks. The look trashy. Very disappointing.
2.0,The  brush on top of the  gloves are soft. doesn’t clean well .
2.0,it was way too small for my arm
2.0,"This shirt was a gift. I ordered an extra large but the shirt I received is definitely not an extra large. The tag inside the shirt was ripped off which was pretty weird and made me think maybe it was used or a previous return. The quality of the shirt is nice, I just wish they sent the right size."
2.0,These are such adorable earrings if they didnt break apart while ur taking them off of the card.
2.0,"Product quality control isn't so great.  The bottom of the mask has bits of rubber that stick out (into your face). Also, the whole mask is just kind of &#34;wrinkled&#34; up.  The eye holes did not match up to my eyes at all.  It was so bad that I didn't use it for halloween--went into the trash unfortunately."
2.0,Didn't fit as expected.  Fits loose under the arms.  Not cut properly.  Also if you have an issue and you do a negative review seller will tell you they will give a refund if you remove it.  They won't.
2.0,Only got one set. Very disappointing
2.0,"This shorts swimming set comes in really cute colors. I ordered the sky blue and navy set. The top fits fantastic, but the bottom was way too small, and I could hear the elastic creaking as I tried to get them up over my hips. So if you have very thin hips and a normal sized top area, this suit is for you!"
2.0,These pants were great at first. I’ve been wearing them about once a week for 6 months and recently they just ripped at the seam near the waste in the back. Pretty bummed as there is now a hole and I can no longer wear them :/ They should last longer than 6 months.
2.0,Bought this for my wife to wear and the first 2 were too small and the 3rd was somehow both too small and too big.  The materials the costumes are made of are very good but they're just made really poorly.  What's a guy gotta do for some Dark Phoenix sexy time? :-(
2.0,"This is the second dress that i purchased from Novica and, like the first, it is boxy.  I am 5''8"" and 130 pounds. I put the dress to my sewing machine, then added two darts to the front of the bodice and took in the sides of the bodice, then added a half-slip because it is a little see-through.  Now i like it enough-- although the teal color is a little darker than i expected.  I probably should have returned it, but it will do for hot days."
2.0,SENT BACK
2.0,"Poor quality control by manufacturer...described as adult size, but would only fit a child, and the eye holes are disproportional...very disappointed, but guess can use as a wall-hanger in my billiards room."
2.0,"So uncomfortable, rubbery and unflattering :("
2.0,The seller advertised this as large hoops these are small medium size hoops. They are not big at all.
2.0,"What is odd is the claim it arrives in a 'delicate jewelry box' in the product details. True, the box is not unattractive, but it is far from a delicate jewelry box. It's a black cardboard box, with a thin black foam insert that has the tiny earrings embedded. The box is way oversized for the earrings. So, the initial impression is one of disappointment.<br />The earrings are supposed to be 9mm (.35inches).  It is not even close to .25 inches. So, 2 inaccurate claims in the description in the product details.<br />The 'cheap' appearance and handling of the backing clasps is thus not a surprise.<br />Attached are photos, with ruler for size reference.<br />Overall, a very disappointing experience. Being generous, the earrings get a 2 star rating, and low level recommendation."
2.0,Loose  around  arms amd chest<br /> It climhs to your stomach  and  makes you look fat
2.0,Not true to size and the material is very very cheap not worth the price could have bought this in K mart for half.
2.0,They were delivered on time unfortunately they do not stay on ear correctly and did not feel comfortable
2.0,Thin material that shrinks after 1 wash
2.0,Big hole in it
2.0,"Poor quality, these were made at the end of a shift, the seam is not straight and the stitches are crooked. Disappointing."
2.0,"The mdx is a all class vehicle and I wanted a keychain that had the logo and was a classy workmanship.  Not so,  I was hoping for a metal key chain,  and it is an imitation"
2.0,"Material is not standard fleece material that most sweatshirts are made of; this one is 65% polyester, the fleece material is see through, so it feels plastic-y and somewhat cheap. The fit is narrow so if you have curve, don’t expect this to be roomy.  I got the 5X and it is pretty much a somewhat roomy L; an adequate US XL; a tight but wearable 2X (if you like tight clothes). The cut is definitely more for junior or Asian body types. I got the brown and the zipper was black; combine that with the non-brown drawstring and it just looks and feels cheaply made.  Also had an odor when it came out of the package."
2.0,The size is not true size.  It is too small.
2.0,I’m really disappointed with this. It’s just a flimsy blanket. It really bunches when I try to tie it like the model..
2.0,"I love this simple hat in photos, however when I wear it, it sits funny on my head and has a weird dent that just won’t go away. It pushes right on the center of my forehead and is very uncomfortable."
2.0,"The design of this dress is cute. But I didn't like the material and it ran small, so I returned it. I am disappointed. I am no longer ordering poor quality clothes made in China."
2.0,"The set is cute and fuzzy, but the top is INCREDIBLY short even for the small-chested. It covered less than a sports bra. There is no elastic to secure it, and it is rather wide so even a small top is baggy and ill fitting."
2.0,"The material is too thick and heavy. Not a light weight summer dress at all. The large fit ok, but a bit long. Had to return because of the material."
2.0,"This dress runs very small!! I ordered a size XL, I normally wear about a 10 in dresses. I could not even get this dress on! It is a nice dress, but very very small. I would say to order at least 2-3 sizes up!"
2.0,The earrings are ok. They're extremely thin and the posts bend way too easily. I am returning them. They're not overpriced though. I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,"I like the print and the material weight is nice. But it's way small. The product info said the sizes ran small so I thought I compensated for that by ordering two sizes too big. Well, my daughter wears a medium so she got the new tshirt."
2.0,Really loved these glasses bit after just a couple months the wood is splitting.
2.0,Quality ok size runs really small
2.0,While leaving feedback they don’t ask “Do they work” the answer would be NO!! They are garbage
2.0,"Why do I keep getting sleeveless tees with thick, clingy material.  Cute logo, horrible tee."
2.0,Material is too thin and you can see through it.
2.0,Not the best quality. Will not purchase again. Very thin.
2.0,"Color is vibrant, but they do not fit at all! They are definitely not high wasted, and are too short. Even when sitting on my hips the length barely reaches my ankle. Also, material clings to your skin, showing every crease. Unfortunately, I will have to return. Disappointed because they are cute in the picture. Maybe works better for shorter individual, as I am 5’10."
2.0,the foam wasn't very sturdy.  already gone flat with little wear.
2.0,Highly disappointed material reads polyester however its def like a bag feel and looks cheap I actually ordered a 2xl expecting it to run a bit smaller but i couldnt even get the pants passed my knees. Maybe this is a junior's measurement.
2.0,It doesn't really look like the hat you have in the photo and it defiently is smaller than it looks too. I like that I have it but it doesn't look exact. A bit disappointed.
2.0,Bought size 2-4T for my daughter who is a 2T and they were too small. Was very disappointed as the quality is very nice and wanted them for the holidays.
2.0,"I bought, to separate between my son's wanting them to have a set (like pictured) a piece. And received 8 of one design and did not receive any of one shown. Good quality, just disappointed by that."
2.0,"Barely a month old, and the snaps inside of the liner that snaps in are broken. The leather is nice, the size is perfect. But the hardware quality is terrible."
2.0,"I usually wear a small or extra small (size 2) so I ordered a small. They fit fine in the waist and the length, but they are very wide in the leg and flare out A LOT. If you have larger thighs and behind they might work, otherwise I don't recommend."
2.0,"It's a no. Gave my XXL to my daughter who wears a medium.  Based on where the arms fit, going up a size still wouldn't have fit."
2.0,"It's unfortunate that these goggles snapped (on side strap) within two weeks of wear. My daughter is on a swim team and these worked great for blocking the sun, but she said one side always let water in and then yesterday they broke at practice while she was swimming. We are really disappointed. These fit her head great, were comfortable, and stylish. They might be better for non-chlorine pools and not for every day wear."
2.0,"This top is so cute that I was going to order more, in different prints... until I washed it. I washed it on delicate and hung it to dry. The fabric pilled terribly in spots, rendering the top ratty looking and unwearable."
2.0,Didn't like it so big on my face
2.0,"Really cute, however this top had such an odor upon opening the package!! Yuk!! Plus, washed it and it shrank one whole size!!! Disappointed!!!"
2.0,It didn't fit properly and kept coming loose. I had to buy different watch band.
2.0,The material was different then I thought.
2.0,These are not as pictured. You cannot even make out the initial.
2.0,Cute shoe for cheap price.  My son only wore 2-3 times before sole became separated from shoe.
2.0,Way to small I expected these to fit but they run small
2.0,This is NOT a cocktail dress. The material is thin and feels like a t-shirt. I bought this to chaperone a formal (I'm a teacher) and this will just not work. It looks like a jersey t-shirt dress that just has an accent. It fits and looks fine but isn't suitable for a formal occasion. I will keep it to wear elsewhere but I am disappointed. I feel like the language on the posting misled me.
2.0,Tore up first day.ball fell off hats and gloves ripped.don't waste your money
2.0,Ordered a size bigger and was still smaller and shorter than I was expecting
2.0,"I got these for a costume and they worked fine, but the issue is that the crotch sits super low! It was a bit uncomfortable to wear for the day. Ditched them halfway through the event."
2.0,Bought two sets of clear lenses for Oakley Hijinx. First set had HORRIBLE optic quality. Massive amounts of peripheral distortion with a variable yellowish tint. Second set was fine. Emailed customer service to see if the 100% happy guarantee was gonna be answered. Let’s see if they really stand behind their product.....
2.0,"I wanted to love this case. The design is really pretty, so I gave it a couple stars for that. However, I didn't like that the front of the wallet kept flopping closed when I tried to use my phone. So I folded it behind the phone, but then it made a big ugly crack in the leather (or whatever it is). Also my toddler ripped the rubber case off the inside of the wallet after only a couple days."
2.0,"Nice beautiful handbag, but began peeling after a short time."
2.0,The material is very cheap. Would not buy again.
2.0,"It seemed like these socks were made for a child. I have small feet (size 6), but I could not wear them. Had to give them away."
2.0,The watch itself is gorgeous. however to make it bigger you had to contact customer service and purchase extra links...we could not get customer service to respond. Also it was purchased for a dress watch. If you do not wear the watch every day it will not keep time.  But the watch is gorgeous if you want to wear it every day.
2.0,Both dresses I ordered were too small.  I need to send them back but do not know how to do that. Could someone help me with that?
2.0,Way to loose!!!
2.0,I was buying XS size for size 0-1 gf. This is 2-3 sizes larger unfortunately😔<br />Pro: looks great<br />Con: wrong size and bad smell
2.0,"I was so excited to get this Nicgid bag. I’d narrowed it down by reading a million reviews. I love the idea of this bag, but it ARRIVED coming APART! If it came this way, I can’t imagine it holding any weight without it completely coming apart. I’m going to try to return it."
2.0,"The fit is just a t-shirt fit. On the loose side. I ordered another brand that is perfect and material feels good, so I ordered several more of those. This feels very synthetic and fit isn’t necessarily complimenting to a figure. Sent it back."
2.0,Reusable bags are reusable bags...or so I thought. My only issue with these is they don’t have the small loop to be able to hook over the existing bag dispenser at the store. As a result the bags caves in while you’re trying to get the first few items in. I would buy a different brand instead. It really is a huge pain especially at self checkout.
2.0,Very thin not what I thought I was getting
2.0,Got a large and really need an XL to achieve the right look. The fabric is pretty and the color beautiful though.
2.0,"This black knit hat is made very well, wore it a couple of times but, very tight and uncomfortable. My head's not very big it's knit cap is very small. I was going to get a refund but I'm a week late on that. Only last for a month."
2.0,"The material is a very scratchy weird material. It didn't get delivered until the return window, so I'm donating it- I feel a bit guilty about that."
2.0,Shirt fit perfectly except sleeves are not balanced I do have thicker arms but bought the shirt big and arms still didn't fit and shirt was very comfortable wish I could have kept it
2.0,We received this product with 10 out of 40 lights that were burned out.  The lights were not good quality compared to others my children have had. The rubber bands to attach them to your fingers fall out and are tricky to reinsert. The price was still good for what you do get.
2.0,So much pilling only after wearing for couple of hours ...
2.0,Not high impact for larger chest. Fine yoga bra
2.0,very cheapo.
2.0,"These shorts taper inward and become smaller than expected at the ends/bottoms. Also, the crotch area fits oddly. When I bend forward or squat the crotch feels awkward and looks odd too. Ended up giving them away.<br />I like the fabric and they seem to madewell. Just fit oddly for me."
2.0,They do not work to see well and cut down the light glare at night.
2.0,Broke literally the first time I tried adjusting the elastic.
2.0,The hat looks great but it doesn't have any give to it. The hat ripped on the first wear. Doesn't really serve the purpose.
2.0,Too small and thin material.
2.0,"This didn't really turn out as planned -the material has an odd stretchy quality (almost as if someone skinned a muppet to make it), and it did not fit as planned.  There are better options out there -"
2.0,Lousy material
2.0,"I really thought that i can use when the sun is on my face. at night when i used it, just about the same when i'm not wearing it. it's too dark to wear at night or at dusk."
2.0,Thought I bought a light blazer but the fabric is poor and looks like you are wearing a long sleeve T. Returned item.
2.0,"These shoes fell apart about a month after they arrived.  The strap broke off and the rubber started peeling off on the front due to poor quality.  I wouldn't recommend these shoes at all, very disappointed.  I had to go purchase another pair at the store."
2.0,Top too small pants perfect
2.0,"Bought these in midJune 2022 but no rain until last week (November).  I love them and they would have gotten five stars except:<br />1) no side grommets as advertised when I purchased<br />2) no interior side pockets (I did know that)<br />3) De laminating!!  This is the big one:<br />I’ve worn them for exactly three days, approx 3 hours each time, and the inside coating is already delaminating in places. Very disappointing!<br /><br />Update: I contacted Grundens and they replaced them under their warranty. Hopefully the second pair will do better."
2.0,One of the two shoes did not charge out of the box.  They looked cool and my son loved them until the battery died.<br />We will buy them again and hopefully get a better pair (maybe a different brand since there are quite a few to choose from)
2.0,Very low quality. One of the hearts fell off my daughters shoe the 1st day she wore it:(
2.0,Make me feel I’m wearing the 3D glasses from the movie tearether ..cheap and the lens don’t change color at all..👎🏽
2.0,I order biggest size I could and socks still won't fit. Disappointed.
2.0,Watch face is too big. Looks out of proportion.
2.0,The colors are bright and eye catching. The fit is extremely small. I am a DDD size and it barely covered the essential parts.  I ordered a large as the size chart stated based on measurements.  I wear a size 10-12 normally. The pattern did not line up in the front.  Asked for a return but not sure it is worth the time or money.  Will not reord.
2.0,Nice necklace. Can’t see a thing.
2.0,These are well constructed but too small for an adult. I also do not like that they are hand wash only.
2.0,Why is the product  so small for the adult and it is not as shown in the picture
2.0,Cute but wouldn't stay button.
2.0,"I liked everything about these EXCEPT the cropped, frayed bottom was not skinny at all... they flared out on the sides. Unfortunately that ruined the tight, distressed, sexy look."
2.0,"I guess I have a big o dome head! Good price, color and design. I get lots of compliments but at the end of my 12.5 hour shift my ears hurt so bad from the tightness, my glasses and masks. I have other brands that either hurt less or not at all."
2.0,Perfect...if you’re over 6’ tall. 👎🏻
2.0,When I ordered these I was excited but when they arrived they are really big and I barely wear them because of the size.
2.0,"This was a $30 item, one would expect that it would at least be half decent quality. But I knew my daughter would only be able to use it once and it would fall apart, it wasn’t worth the money. The shoes were half decent if that’s worth anything"
2.0,"Nice LOOKING boots, but they are extremely narrow and run REALLY small. I ordered 2 sizes up, and my son couldn't even get his foot into the shaft. When compared to his street shoes (2 sizes smaller) these were a hair smaller than those. Two stars because nice quality, but quality is pointless if they can't be worn. Sending them back."
2.0,"Felt thin, rolled down a bit & dug into my thigh. I’m 5’6”, 155, athletic/muscular build, my thighs aren’t that big, but these socks were uncomfortable. Returned them."
2.0,Notice in the Amazon photo that the amethysts are a light lavender? The ones I received today look like onyx. Hold them up to the light and they do not even look deep purple. The workmanship is good quality but I did not want black stones. Will have to return.
2.0,"Super cute., got a lot of compliments. But literally a one time use... my sequence started coming off. It was ripping at the seams. It is very cheaply made I wint be able to use again"
2.0,"Ordered my size 12-14 L. Tight around waist & hips. Loose at top, shoulders, arm holes. Nice material. Was hoping to buy another, will not buy again."
2.0,Not happen with ring. Ring slides off excessively.
2.0,Had hat for a couple months and it’s already starting to unravel. Husband is very disappointed.
2.0,I figured these masks would be e large enough for adults they are not I’ll see if I can give them to a child.?not adult size very tight around the ears
2.0,Lenses popped out after a months use.
2.0,Does not have a nose wire so it didn’t fit. Disappointed since I like the patten.
2.0,Super thin . . Great as bikini cover up
2.0,Did not like the way this fit at all.  The pockets will not stay in.  It's not that I got the wrong size because it is very loose everywhere else.  I really wanted to love it but sadly I did not.  Would have returned but didn't want the hassle.
2.0,"So the winding turn knob is comprised, has a chip. Much smaller than it looked in the photos. Looks like it will keep time and date but after reading the broken English owners manual, attention to detail isn’t a through line for OLEVS. Sending this back right away."
2.0,"Very, very,  very small"
2.0,I have a pair of these in a soft gray and love them.  I just bought again in black and they are shorter in length and thinner in material.
2.0,Doesn’t fit well at all. Constantly slipping down 😏
2.0,Not practical. Takes up too much space in my luggage.
2.0,"Was disappointed as these are definitely not navy blue, they're purple. I gave it two stars as the gold bangles are really pretty. I got a set of plain navy bangles and replaced the purple ones with those."
2.0,"This shirt has no stretch, is see through, and is so cropped when I lift my arms up I basically flash everyone."
2.0,"Got a XL (normally I get a medium bottom and a large top (38&#34;bust, 34&#34;band) however both the top was still too small (I first ordered a L) and the bottom was too big. The cups of the top would've been fine if the shape was different (more bowl like than the cup of a bra)"
2.0,This item arrived in a plastic bag folded and wrinkled and not at all like the picture shown online.  The faded color is OK but this in no way qualifies as a dressy sun hat.  I am laying it flat and putting some light weights to see if it will flatten out.  If it doesn't  I will be returning the item.  Very disappointed
2.0,Way to small. I normally wear a women's small but I bought medium so it would be big enough to put other shirts underneath. It's tight. Sleeves are short.
2.0,"The item is smaller than stated on description.  Cute Design, but thin material."
2.0,"It's okay...doesn't really stick as well as it should, and the top edges kept sticking to my dress. Just not that great. And doesn't give as much lift as it shows/claims."
2.0,"Within a month of infrequent wear, the silver on these studs tarnished and become uncomfortable to wear.  Had to send 'em back, sadly."
2.0,Loved the color. Looked very cheap and cardboardy not the elegant stiff feel of good work handbags. Returned.
2.0,Material is very thin. Dress sizing runs large. Length is perfect
2.0,I was excited to purchase this necklace as I enjoy vintage jewelry but upon receiving this necklace I wasn't thrilled... The picture is no where close to the actual color of the rose... It is more a nicotine yellow and no that is not a compliment...
2.0,"i ordered 6x,fits like 4x.zipper is on wrong side.nice material.cheap so i kept it."
2.0,"fit is baggy and loose, also sweaty material"
2.0,Cheap looking and pretty cheap material.
2.0,"Holy moly this suit runs SMALL. I'm 5'6&#34; and 160lbs, and somewhere between a medium and a large. I ordered the Large, figuring that if it's a suit made specifically for plus size women, they'd know how women are really shaped. Well no - the elastic top of the bottoms were crazy tight. Of course it's stretchy material, but there's no way it's wearable.<br />Otherwise the material seemed nice, and it's super cute. Just be sure to order a size or two up."
2.0,"Very cute and appear to be nice quality, but way too small! I ordered my son's size that he wears in all of his other shoes and I couldn't even get these on his feet (despite the stretchy material). I would have ordered a larger size, if I had known the sizing was wack. Overall not worth the hassle. Returned them."
2.0,"Some reason they sent me a XL<br />The set over all is too large<br />The colors are the same as shown<br />The pants don’t appear they wouldn’t be fitted all the way down even if sent the correct size.<br />Very stretchy, not thick."
2.0,Not a fan of the bottoms as they are huge<br />The top is cute but one boob is smaller than the other<br />Quality is poor
2.0,Short for what I expected
2.0,"These glasses are nice but a little bent from non padded packaging.  They're clearly black and silver in the picture but i received them yesterday(on time), but they were black and gold.  I dont really wear gold so not sure what happened..a little disappointed."
2.0,Buy the small one as didn't fit. It is big for me.
2.0,Loved the glasses but there was a huge scratch on the lens and a scratch on the frames as well.
2.0,They were big
2.0,"If you want to buy these DON""T call the toll free number from the TV ad! Very high pressure sales staff! Very deceptive! I ended up with 2 sets= 4 pair of these flimsy binocular glasses and a credit card charge of $88.00! I'm disputing it now. No invoice came with them. Toll free number very difficult to get a human being! Customer service only available Mon-Fri, 8-4pm. Buyer Beware!<br />Reported web site to Fl. St. Attorney as deceptive and false advertising!"
2.0,Nice belt too small.  Fit like for a child’s neck
2.0,Fell apart a few days later. The wire came off the pendant
2.0,Very dissatisfied. I purchased for compression and doesn't have much of any.
2.0,I like the design- and thought it would be more opalescent and in the shades shown in photo- it is very vivid and bright in person and looks like thin plastic- I haven't worn it as it doesn't go with what I'd intended-
2.0,"These are suitable mostly for very slender necks. I was only able to wear the stretchy ones the likes of which were popular in the 90s, which is fine, but I wish I'd known I'd be giving 99% of them away because I never would have bought them."
2.0,"The dress fits well and has a cute design, however I would describe it as more of a teal or blue green. Unfortunately since I ordered this to go with siblings outfits (that are a true green) it’s not going to work for us. I included a green marker for reference incase it helps others gauge the color."
2.0,"Got this thinking it would be super soft, washed it and it was still stiff and scratchy. Going to wash it with towels and jeans see if that softens it up some. Pretty disappointed."
2.0,they slip!
2.0,It's really thin and feels cheap. Like it was sewn together really rushed.
2.0,"You can't really tell from the picture, but this is a really shiny fake silk scarf. It feels really cheap and looks like it came from the clearance section at Forever 21. It is also very short."
2.0,"The length and clips for the shirt are fine.<br /><br />One of my major complaints is the foot loop's sewing makes it never sit flush.<br /><br />The other complaint, the one that makes me not be able to stand wearing these, is the metal clip near the Y-split. Since the foot loop doesn't sit flush, it twists the band left and right.. Well, when it does that, you have the metal clip digging into your skin or pulling hair.<br /><br />Plastic adjustable clips would solve the issue that prevents me from wearing these."
2.0,To be fair I am 6ft and 215lbs wile I can get them on if I bend over they slide down the elastic band does not fit well or does the highway for me they also are kindof more capris on me and are tight with not much to little stretch room I'm going to be giving them to a friend who has a better body type to fit them
2.0,"I was excited to receive my shoes, but the quality isn't at all what I had expected.  As a long-time Crocs customer, I expected the shoes to be a good quality with adequate construction.  Both of the shoes I received fit differently.  Where the straps connect and where the upper and lower pieces are fitted together, I can see the white under-layer.  This is not what I'd come to expect from these shoes--these look more like ""factory-seconds"" than retail.  I'm disappointed, but not disappointed enough to return them."
2.0,Frames are non flexible and are hard. Son doesn't like wearing them. We use it for nerf battles so no big deal.
2.0,"Several concerns:<br />1. Bezel clicks back and fourth, feels like it is going to come off, gap between face and bezel<br />2. Bezel color doesn't match the watch face or markers<br />3. Strap clasp doesn't feel sturdy<br />4. Feels more like a $50 watch, pictures online make this watch look like a filet mignon when all you really get is a sirloin."
2.0,"I love the look, but they are just too heavy."
2.0,Already some stones fell out…..  a little frustrated……. I guess it’s my bad luck.  But it’s the first time it had happened with my purchases.  I have brought a lot.  I hope it’s not a trend.
2.0,"Ehh a little on the cheap side I thought they would be more structured and conforming.  I use they<br /> Under my work shirt (I work in a resturant) to give me a second layer.  They are ok for the job I am using them for, just not totally what I expected."
2.0,Their products are very tight fitting and j always have to size up. I ended up returning due to the unflattering in the front. It almost looked like a diaper in the front with the fabric scrunching between thighs up to the band
2.0,"Was a bit disappointed when this arrived and was only one short, I had to go back and sort down through product details to see that it’s not in fact a set when the title description and photo indicates that it’s a set.<br /><br />The shirt is nice quality and I am now going back to buy the newborn shirt. But I would have a) appreciated knowing that from the get go so they could have arrived together and b) feel a little bated and switched."
2.0,This is such a pretty scarf! I didn’t pay much for it so I wasn’t expecting the nice quality. I gave it 2 stars only because the awful tag that left a sticky mess on the scarf. If the tag had been several inches lower and off to the side it would be unnoticed. Not even sure I can wear it without fussing with it all day making sure the tape mark doesn’t show. Maybe should have left the big ugly white tag on it.
2.0,Completely fell apart after wearing 4 times
2.0,It technically “works” but there are no instructions on how to change the LED colors or lighting modes.
2.0,No good cuality
2.0,"Quality ok, but the bowtie and suspenders were two different colors. We were not pleased."
2.0,The earrings are beautiful but extremely big not as they  appear on the screen.( poor screen image description)
2.0,"This dress runs small. I stand 5 foot 5 in tall and weigh 175 lbs and wear an extra large in all my dresses. This is too snug and I will be returning it. Such a Pity, I have had my eye on this dress for probably a year now."
2.0,"This mask has so much potential. It’s attractive and multi layered, but it is extremely narrow and the length is laughable. I will be returning."
2.0,"They were supposed to be baby wraps which I was so excited about. Only they are huge, I could probably wear them for me. Very soft and I'm extremely disappointed she won't be able to wear them. :("
2.0,These watches are quite the hit in Italy. Was excited to receive mine and was disappointed to find out the watch was really small in size.  Please take note that this watch will only fit a child and not an adult.
2.0,"The earring themselves are fine.  Not the highest quality but they are inexpensive, so I wasn't expecting them to be.  My issue is that the photo shows 12 different colors and the description states &quot;mixed colors&quot; so you would assume you are getting all 12 colors.  This is incorrect.  I got 2 each of 6 colors, so I didn't get the colors that I wanted.  Still cheap enough that I plan on keeping them but I'm disappointed."
2.0,"This is getting two-starred because the pattern's accurate (and cute) and it fit a friend of mine.<br /><br />Otherwise, this basically FAILED for me personally across the board. The fabric does not feel normal for a thermal garment and mine arrived stinking of unknown chemicals besides which may explain the odd feel. (It's difficult to describe, but I *thought* it was going to feel like some of my other waffle-weave gear which is a lot softer/more like standard cotton-containing gear, and instead it felt both too lightweight and almost crunchy or something. My friend's planning to use a LOT of Downy and hope that works.)<br /><br />It is also neither long enough from collar to bottom nor in the sleeves to comfortably fit my 5'8&#34;, 190-200 pound long-armed self.<br /><br />On the other hand, it fit my 5'4&#34; friend with shorter arms who weighs somewhat less fine, so your mileage may vary, but I was very disappointed *I* wasn't going to have a wearable cute thermal and in general wouldn't rec this."
2.0,"The cups are so stiff in the top that it doesn’t fit right. I’m a 34C and ordered a medium. The bottoms fit fine and the bodice of the top fits, but the cups look too big because they are too molded and stiff. It did arrive quickly and I can use the bottoms, but not the top."
2.0,Broke within 2 weeks.  Looks great but won’t last.
2.0,Somehow a bit small😑😑😑
2.0,"Definitely a blue/teal. Not green. Also the inside of the suit is white, which shows around the edges and is not flattering. It makes it look cheaply made or as if the suit is turning inside out"
2.0,"product advertised ""true to size"" which is not true. due to the materials in product..its no where close to the size a person puts down as their usual size. its approximately one size smaller. due to that ..i wont be ordering from that particular vendor..but will give it to someone else."
2.0,"I had to send this back. It is made of very thin material and seemed cheap to me. Also, ALL the pockets are on the outside, which is ridiculous. And it's HUGE. Not good for a few hours at the baseball game. Maybe if I was going on an extended baseball TRIP."
2.0,Zipper came off first time trying to wear it.
2.0,Cheap and broke right away
2.0,"Unfortunately, it arrived damaged. There was a hole in the belt. Sleeves were a little long. Ordered a large (all that was available) but a medium would have been better."
2.0,Not true to size<br />Too small<br />Cheap material
2.0,I have had this umbrella for a little over a month. I have the dark green color and it is totally faded and yellowed. Disappointed
2.0,"Straight out of the package, Great material! The moment I unsnapped the top button to try it on, it broke. The back of the snap closure came out of the fabric and remained snapped. A BIG let down. The tie back could use a little more length to be inclusive of all body shapes. It will suffice for now, but would not purchase again."
2.0,"I love the look of this watch and had to get a few links taken out to fit my wrist.  The watch works intermittently, which isn't very helpful.  Disappointed in the actual quality of this watch."
2.0,"I loved the style, color and fit of the dress.  What I didnt like was the dress was super thin."
2.0,Pendant too small.
2.0,"Print was rather dull, and really faded after a was"
2.0,Locket received is smaller than we expected.
2.0,"While I could’ve worn them because of course they came as Asian sized clothes normally do, too small. But the ankles were almost Barbie doll sized"
2.0,I thought it was going to be shorter but it was way long !
2.0,"I'm disappointed in this item because, the color is not near as vibrant as the picture. Also, the arms of this Maxi are so small you cannot get the dress to sit on your shoulders; it simply won't go because these sleeves are so tight. In order to wear this Maxi, you have to keep the sleeves off the shoulder and even then, it is very tight. I would send this back but don't want the aggravation plus the cost of postage. I looked at the stitching to see if I could tear the sleeve out and re-sew it, however, there is not enough fabric to do so. I will use it as a cover up for the beach, however, the arms will be uncomfortable even for that. I have decided I will no longer purchase clothing on Amazon because, you can't depend on the sizing."
2.0,"Made way too small. I ordered my size 3x and ended passing then on to my mother who is a L.  They look nicely made, super soft….but reduced in size"
2.0,These shoes are really more trouble than they're worth. It's easier for my daughter to walk barefoot or wearing shoes.
2.0,"Doesn’t hold very well, the edges peel constantly. Also it’s very bulky looking under your clothings and isn’t very flattering. Holds your breast’s together but does not hold them up. I use it along with tape to hold down the edges and also for a lift. It’s not horrible but I definitely wouldn’t buy again."
2.0,"THEY WERE WAY TO SMALL, I COULD BARELY SEE THE CHINESE SYMBOLS"
2.0,"great color and quality but size is too small, looks like a women's watch."
2.0,Runs on the shorter side for a poncho.<br />The neck does not lay as shown in the pucture but serves as a cute hood
2.0,The quality of fabric is good but the design is not what I expected. Unless you have a good body figure do not try it.
2.0,I like the jeans.  They are just cheaply made.
2.0,I ordered a size even bigger then anticipated & these things do not stretch whatsoever. If all I had to do was walk then yeah they look awesome but sitting or bending down was a no-go. RETURNED!!
2.0,"The skirt flows very nicely, but the top was bigger than it should be. I felt like it wasn't coordinated in a correct way so I had to return"
2.0,"I thought it was pretty uncomfortable, didn't fit well.  Sent back. Face looks very utilitarian."
2.0,The shoes are cute but began to fray at the toes when worn only 3 times.
2.0,"I recently bought another tankini, and wanted to try another one. This was not it. The top was extremely long on me. It completely covered up, and was even longer than the bottom skirt. The foam cups didn't fit right. They were very stiff and rigid. When I tightened up the straps to keep them on my shoulders, the top of the cup was too high for my boobs. The bottom skirt did not come up high enough for my liking. It was more like a hipster, sitting below my waist. Finally, the print wasn't very attractive. Returning."
2.0,I mean it's a nice jacket but it's really tight around the arms and dosnt fit comfortably. And I got a large one and I wear a medium and it still didn't fit!
2.0,"Okay quality but they were too big for my face, so I returned.  I give Amazon five stars for the quickly processed free return."
2.0,I wear between a 3-4x and it’s super tight and it’s a 4x
2.0,not what I really was looking for
2.0,"Not a flattering cut.  The ruffle over the tummy was not flattering at all.  Might work for a gal without curves.  It was very wrinkled and would need ironing.  With all of those ruffles, it would be a nightmare.  I’m gonna pass on this one."
2.0,"If it is not simulated, it looks like it is. Not worth the price in my opinion."
2.0,Returned. Cut across my bum in a very uncomfortable way
2.0,Much shorter than expected and the size didn't match up.
2.0,the material is not as expected
2.0,These were very uncomfortable.  They pinched.
2.0,Biggest ever
2.0,Really disappointing. First the dress was super thick and heavy. The bodice fit really weird. I ordered a size larger but it still fit tight. The dress laces up the back so there is no zipper so I managed to get it on. Quality was not there. I also read “free returns” when I ordered but this means they won’t charge YOU to return it. It cost me $15 at post office to return. What a waste of time and money.
2.0,"Way too big for my kids, 2 & 4. They fit me!"
2.0,The fabric frayed after only one time wearing them. 🙁 Very disappointing.
2.0,They run way too small
2.0,"The pants are cute, they shine great, but they are not lined, not even a little bit; because they are not lined, they are very scratchy, and would probably have rubbed my skin raw.  There is no elastic in the waist band, and they are definitely low-rise, and didn't fit my ""pear-shaped"" body.  I wish I could give them a better star rating, because they're cute, but I simply can't."
2.0,"Loved the color, hated the material. It was shapeless and dowdy. Returned."
2.0,Quick shipping. Choker looks awesome but the clip breaks so easily. I wore my first one twice and the clip broke so I got another one thinking it was just me. Nope. Second one the clip broke before I even wore it once! So frustrating.
2.0,Band too big for my wrist and I got the smallest one
2.0,I am probably going to have to send this back. It is EXTREMELY sheer. The pattern is nice. I wanted to wear this as a summer dress to work to keep cool. That’s not going to happen as I would have to wear a thick slip underneath. Which means it won’t work as a float summer dress.
2.0,"looks so cool in the pic, but so plastic and cheap in real life :( so sad!"
2.0,"I had high hopes for this dress, as in the picture it looks adorable. In person though, the dress material was just not right for this style of dress. It was very wrinkly and would absolutely require steaming or ironing for it to look presentable. If you can get past the material, the dress itself might work better on those who are tall. I'm 5'5"", and the dress came about to my knees and just was not flattering. Overall, I did not like this dress and did end up returning it."
2.0,"Not good material, will even a slightest pull I could hear the stitches  coming off"
2.0,"After one wash and wearing them twice, there is already a hole in the crotch at the seam."
2.0,"I ordered this bag for spring time but it is not white.  The color is cream, not even off white.  I am disappointed that it was labeled white and clearly isn't. Nice bag other than the color."
2.0,"I wear a 3xl, said order larger than normal by two sizes. Ordered 5xl, could hardly get it zipped. More like 5xl = 2xl max. Nice, but small and has women's zipper (wrong side) zip"
2.0,the magnetic snap tore out of the fake leather tab after a few months.
2.0,"These are cute and fit well, except the shorts part rides up horribly, even when just walking. :( Super sad about that."
2.0,I almost wonder if there was a mistake.  They are too big for my adult face.  They do feel decent quality and the adjustability is nice.  But I cannot use them for what I intended them for so hence the two stars.
2.0,"The material is wonderful. The scarf is perfect. The hat is an extremely large size. At this time Costumer Service has not responded, so at this point I do not know if they have a smaller size or if I should return the set. It was a Christmas gift and too pricy for my son not to be able to use it in the cold NY Winter weather."
2.0,"These sunglasses are good for a photo with a stylized outfit, or for use as a LARP prop. I wouldn’t depend on them for driving."
2.0,"Looks like the pic but the material isn’t it, the logo feels like plastic or a sticker and the actual hoodie is very cheap cheap material"
2.0,"I like the attempt at pockets, but it scrunches up the middle. It is cut funny, runs small, the the white is see-through. The fabric has a nice feel and the pattern is pretty, but I am disappointed."
2.0,Not the support I'd like so returning it.
2.0,Way too small for my adult size hands
2.0,"These are so cute, but the leaf tassels are far too long. I'm going to have to adjust the length, as they currently hit my collar bone when I'm wearing them."
2.0,A bit baggy top half and tapers down too much.
2.0,"I bought this on a Prime Day lightning deal so felt pressured to purchase (you have 4 minutes before the price changes!!!!) before I could read reviews. Mine will be similar to the others, though in the chest and waist it fit as expected, contrary to the others saying it fits small. The buttons are WAY too big for the button holes. I had to fight to unbutton it to try it on and even then I couldn't really button it back up. The sleeves are a bit tight and have these huge awkward pleated puffs on the top. It's thinner than I expected, but that's not a make or break. Also it hangs funny so it sort of puffs out around the hips. Also, there are no pockets! What kind of coat has no pockets?"
2.0,it is awesome material great condition but it is supposed to be large and came super super small I am normally a medium but requested large and it came as small as a Small.
2.0,Unfortunately the description leaves out the fact that this is a mini half shirt in the front and barely covers the boobs. So I'm from the '80s but I don't care to promote that when I'm going to bed.  It's going back. Stat.
2.0,Quality of watch was not what I expected. But delivery was accurate.
2.0,"Bad quality earrings. They feel very flimsy, the clasp doesn’t close so you cant even wear them. They are pretty but very cheap quality, very disappointing."
2.0,Would give 1 star except I actually like the hat -- but I can barely hear anything and have made sure my phone volume is all the way up. I can only listen to my podcasts on my walks if I'm in a very quiet area. Is there a way to increase the volume?
2.0,"Way off with sizing. Sheer material,"
2.0,"The clamps are big and the weight of them pull the necklace down the back of your neck. Also, the gold color is a very bright shiny yellow. It doesn't match any of my 14k or gold dipped necklaces."
2.0,A little wided than expected... Or my head is too small lol!<br />A lot of reviews on Amazon now end with..I recieved this a discount price..blah blah blah... It makes it harder to really believe what they say...This is my review...I payed full price and this is what I think.<br /><br />I was looking for a headband to wear in the mornings to take the kids to school and maybe to work out...the band is a bit bigger than expected...so big that if not folded in a half looks like a strange cone is on your head...and since the band is kind of large is better if you keep it on top of your hears..which could be a little hot during summer and work outs. But that is just me.<br />So I'm thinking in cutting the band 2 inches and sawing it again for better grip. For this reason I give it 2 stars.<br />The band is very soft and someone absorbent.
2.0,The boot looks great and will keep your feet dry but is very uncomfortable. Your foot feels as if it is laying flat on the pavement when walking around; the sole offers little to no support. I wore the boots in 15 degree weather and did not feel cold.
2.0,"The quality of the product looks good, but how is this possible !! you sell a pant size 34 and it is like 28, I use to wear Levis jeans 34 and it fits perfect, In order to make this pants fit on me I will need to get a pant size 38."
2.0,"Packaged horribly, quality cheap, but I expected it to be. Delivery took 2x longer. The box was too small to even fit the product. Half of the shipping box was cardboard and the other half was constructed out of paper and tape."
2.0,Fit more like a small/ medium as opposed to an XL.  Couldn't wear them.  Gave them to my son.
2.0,I am returning this watch because it was not in any type of leather box or any other type of box. There also were no tools included to remove links from the watch band.<br />The watch was loose in an envelope with no packing around the watch.
2.0,Pretty but way too small and poor quality material
2.0,"Super small head hole, not useable on a 6 year old."
2.0,"Got the e colored (white) bindi, it was shipped to me in just an envelops so arrived a little beaten up but I was able to repair it with resin. Overall it's ok looking but (a) the fake pearls are huge (b) the entire thing is entirely too large (c) It is straight so you have to bend it to fit your head and (d) there is no pin/clip/comb to help secure it to your hair, so I used resin to attach it to a bobby pin."
2.0,Gloves feel apart as soon as they got wet
2.0,"It was a nice made dress, but way too small.  My dress size is normally xs to small.  I probably would have needed a large in this dress to fit the way I wanted it to."
2.0,"This purse was actually returned. It was a good looking purse, but the attached handles would dig into your shoulders, or at least it did mine. I had to regretfully send ti back ."
2.0,"I bought the popular brand of this top that is in the low $20 dollar range, I loved it and wanted to buy more colors, so I shopped around for the best prices in each color and ended up getting 4 different brands of the same cut top. This brand, specifically in gray, is the only one that missed the mark for me. It states that it’s 87% Nylon and 13% Spandex like the other tops but sure doesn’t feel like it. And although I cannot read the writing, the numbers are either 75% and 25% or 94% and 6%. Also all the other tops need to be sized up to fit (according to all the reviews) but this one runs much larger and probably doesn’t need to be sized up. The elastic band for the built in bra is also thicker and white unlike the other tops that have the coordinating color and lay flat on the skin. Maybe it’s just the gray color? I’m sending it back."
2.0,Super cute. They just run super small. And shrink when you wash them.
2.0,"These earrings are an excellent price and wear nicely on the ears.  However, this company did not mention how small they were.  They appear very large on the computer screen, so it was a disappointing surprise to open the drawstring bag to find tiny little black specks.  I was hoping for larger stud earrings."
2.0,Cute but WAY TOO LARGE. Do not use the size chart. It is inaccurate. :(<br /><br />Quality of the tank is decent. I just wish it fit.
2.0,"Definitely too tight, did not fit as expected. The material does not breathe or stretch and is very low quality, although the pattern and style are very nice."
2.0,Cheaply made. Kinda see through. Super flimsy. Not flattering at all. Sending back.
2.0,"I gave this to my daughter who loves turquoise.  I didn’t see her for awhile and forgot about the ring.  Tonight I was reminded about the ring and so texted and asked her about it.  She said a stone fell out of it not too long after I gave it to her.  She didn’t want me to get upset by telling me, said she knew I would forget about the ring so didn’t say anything.  She wears lots of different turquoise jewelry so I did forget.  So, sadly I would not suggest anyone buy this ring.  Sorry."
2.0,"Garter was a bit snug, and the stocking didn't fit as expected."
2.0,too stretchy shows every bump  lump
2.0,"Extremely uncomfortable. I bought 2 pairs for my daughters to start off the school year with. Epic fail. I was called down to the school before lunchtime to deliver new shoes. The shoes are very stiff and hard and rubbed terribly against their heel and sides that they received blisters and raw marks from them. The only reason this got 2 stars was they were pretty, delivered timely and appeared exactly as seen in photo."
2.0,A little small and see through
2.0,"you have to crop and print the pic yourself. then you have to stick it on w the print fitting perfectly behind the adhesive. if you're crafty this might be nice for you, but you also have to consider how you'll get a quality print done."
2.0,This would be perfect if it wasn’t made for a gigantic head. It won’t even stay on my face. Way too big
2.0,"Pretty object, but too small for Men. Rope not long enough."
2.0,"Dress is getting returned. I ordered a medium (5'3&#34;, 130 lbs). It was the right length but the bust area was too short. The sleeves also did a pucker where you could see the front of my chest and the belly was very unflattering, making me look pregnant."
2.0,"The glue in the self adhesive is pure garbage. It doesn’t attach well to the skin, and once you remove it to try and put it back in the packaging to try to reuse another day, the glue starts to melt into little balls of dust in the corner. I was very careful and followed all the instructions in the package, but I couldn’t reuse a second time. It went straight to the garbage bin."
2.0,"It looks nice, but the strap broke after a couple weeks of wearing it."
2.0,Runs extremely small. Size 2 sizes up
2.0,Super cute in pics but the sleeves are about 2 inches too short and the stitching is already coming undone.
2.0,Shaping is funny big at shoulders small on the bottom
2.0,These broke very easily. Not good quality
2.0,Way too wide.  Disappointed because it could have been cute.  My daughter loves Queen Barb.
2.0,"Very weird fit. This looks more like pijamas which is how I’ll end up using it. It has weird bulges where the pockets are, near the hip area. The material is somewhat awe through."
2.0,Not worth the buck even for a gag
2.0,"This Jacket was not the same as pictured the material was different, a denim vest yes, but the style in the picture is what I thought I would receive.  The jacket has a thin cheap almost linen like denim used not a stone wash maybe closer to a one color blue.  Not happy, the cut was the same, so overall the style worked, but not what I expected"
2.0,The shirt ripped on the side after 2 wears
2.0,"The only reason I’m giving this 2 stars is because of how fast it started to rust after nearly a day of wearing it! It looks exactly like the picture when it arrived, but not even 48 hours of wearing it and it rusted faster than Forever 21 clearance jewelry.<br />Shame...because it actually looks so beautiful and it was exactly what I wanted...and I guess the rust decoloring can have a cool vintage effect? But overall, I would purchase with caution: this is clearly only meant to be worn at a minimum."
2.0,I don’t like this product is not stable on my daughter ears.
2.0,Great Wallet but cheaply made
2.0,If you're looking for harem pants these will be right up your alley. I personally did not like how short they were. And they also got a hole in them the second time after wearing them.
2.0,If your a very thin person then this is perfect.
2.0,"I ordered a size small, it was more of a size medium/large. It was also see-thru. The material is cheap. Really wanted to like it because I like the print but had to return it."
2.0,Came with an ink stain on it.  Returned.  It's too bad because the dress looked great otherwise.
2.0,"I feel like Goldilocks with this company. I so much wanted to like their product(s) because the multiple pockets appealed to me as did the ability to travel without extra carryon bag. BUT...These jackets are NOT made for a woman's body. This company does not think women have boobs. The phone pocket is directly over the left breast and makes a very squarish outline if you can even zip it closed with the phone in there (that's another thing). Also, beware--this ""Phone"" pocket can barely fit an iphone 6 in and even then with a great deal of stretching lengthwise--not designed for the modern phones.<br /><br />I've been through a number of their items. First, the Chloe Glow size medium (because I typically take a small jacket and all reviews said to order up). That was so tight I'd never get anything in any of the pockets in the upper torso (so much for having boobs, which they clearly don't expect). So then I ordered the Chloe large. It was a bit better but still pretty snug in the top when zipped, so I wasn't sure about keeping that one either--same problem with the phone pocket, more limited pockets than in their jacket, so I ordered a jacket--this time in extra large because of the snug fit of the chloe glow large. Wow. Huge. Shoulder seams down my arms. I was a potato sack. Might as well carry a backpack onboard than have to look like a clown. So then I went down to a large in the jacket. Oh, boy, I still looked like a sack and it dawned on me that it was two things--the style (really manish) and the fabric (no give, very rough, very wrinkly). I'm definitely not a fan of this company's design department. They need a major overhaul if they're going to sell to women. If it's any consolation to them, I did wind up keeping the Chloe Glow size L because I figured I'd put them through so much back-and-forth and it was the least of all their disappointments. The fabric is more giving. I have the option of using different pockets, but I certainly can't see using them all--with all the weight on the left with the phone and the ipad? Come on folks, give it some thought ('weight balancing' really?) Hope this review helps some people who wonder what to expect if they do want to try this. Good luck."
2.0,I bought this in white; it is very lightweight and almost like tshirt material. The white was see through; usually hoodies/sweatshirts (even when thin) are at least thick enough they aren’t transparent. Returning unfortunately
2.0,Cheap plastic piece of junk.
2.0,It was damaged upon arrival. The i side case was separating from the outside.
2.0,I was expecting a deeper red and something a little more sturdy. The magnetic clasp doesn't stay put. However I do like the style and I get a lot of compliments
2.0,Fabric feels like a paint canvas
2.0,"The product of the material of the dress felt cheap and thin, and I do like thin, but this was ridiculous. I probably should give it a few more chances! It looks nice!"
2.0,Cute but not breathable at all
2.0,The colors of the scarf are a lot lighter then they advertised. There is more white in the scarf than red and blue. Although the colors are not what i expected the scarf is very soft and warm i just wish it was the same color as the one advertised.
2.0,"I really wanted to like these glasses. They are the style that I like and I was able to order them in my preferred frame and lens color. They fit great and they are comfortable. The problem I have with the glasses is they make everything look BLUE. When I say that they make everything blue, I'm not just talking about a blue tint. White cars look blue, grass looks blue, grey cars look blue, the road looks blue - literally everything is blue (just different shades of blue). It is so bad that I feel like I am underwater and it makes me feel sick.<br /><br />I have had polarized glasses before, and they have not had the same effect on my vision. If these didn't turn everything blue, they would be the most amazing sunglasses find ever, but I'm sadly returning them. If you are going to use these only on the water, they would be a great inexpensive pair of sunglasses. I'm feeling blue that they didn't work for me."
2.0,I'm a bit unsatisfied with this Kimono. Its super thin and it has no hooks around it for the string to go around your waist. I may return the item because the way it is in person is not worth the money. Like I thought it was a bit thicker in material. You ever look at something and said to yourself 'I can make this myself' those are exactly my thoughts on this Kimono.
2.0,Usually I wear 7.5 for my sandals but this one is little big. Ankle straps are not comfortable for me I feel little scratchy on my skin.
2.0,Too narrow.... Not as in the picture
2.0,"This dress is weird. I found the dress huge in the skirt and sleeves, but super tight in the bust. The bust might be okay if you’re a 3x and flat chested, but my DDDs was not going to fit and allow for breathing comfortably. I also thought the waist was short. This dress would have been better with a wide and long smocked waist and a bit more flow in the bust."
2.0,The bottom of the sweatshirt is very loose. I have the same one is light pink and it’s made with a different material.
2.0,I didn’t even try it on. I was so disappointed in the color. Smh
2.0,The inside velet part where your glasses go came apart very quickly. We had to wait a few weeks for this item to get here so it wasn't a quick shipment. With that being said returning it was not something we wanted to have to wait for.
2.0,"Was so excited about this bag. Perfect size for gym and weekend get sways. However it only lasted a couple of months and truly only a handful of uses. I had purchased it with a trip this summer in mind but the bag is broken - crossbody strap is completely off. At the time it broke all I had in it was - one swim suit, diving rings, makeup bag, flip flops, book, and a water bottle - disappointing."
2.0,TOO SMALL AND TOO DULL OF A FINISH
2.0,"You definitely get what you pay for.  If you are expecting a soft, durable, yet malleable material for the straps, you will be in for a disappointment.  The straps feel frail, thin and stiff and cheaply made. Appearance-wise it looks similar to the picture, which is the only reason I am giving it any stars.  I had bought a similar one, different style for a gift for a friend and it looks and feels so poorly made that I was embarrassed to even give it to her.  I bought this blue one for myself that is too big for my tiny wrist.  However I assumed that the material would fall nicely like a bracelet should, and as long as it wasn't falling off I would wear it.  I wore it to &#34;break in&#34; the straps to they can fall correctly, and it is still just as stiff and awkward looking as when I got it."
2.0,The Velcro is weak and after just a month they won’t stay clasped and keep falling off. The size is right. I do love that the sole is bendable and the leather looks nice.
2.0,"I am disappointed with the robe. The zipper started coming apart about half down the robe. With the type of zipper it is, it can’t be fixed. This was a waste of money."
2.0,Disappointed.  Had one pair break in less than a month with only occasional use.  Wore on a cord/strap and with only occasional use.  Arm broke at end where it screws into front piece.  No way to repair.
2.0,The rubber is to flexible and has too much stretch to it. The extra stretch allows your foot to move to much which can cause you to fall.
2.0,Does not seem to help.
2.0,"Don't like that sock thing at the top, and it is a darker color than the boots"
2.0,"Purchased for my husband. He was pleased with it, except it didn't last  him 2 months and that's not from constant wearing. He does have other belts that you uses alternatively. So sorry that this belt was poorly made :("
2.0,Bigger than expected also its see through.
2.0,I ordered this because of the unusual charms . All together there were 3 charms that were not usable at all . 2 of those were the ones I liked the best .
2.0,Pretty color good quality way too big!
2.0,The extension ear piece fell off and is lost.
2.0,It was advertised as off white. It's tan.<br />The circumference of the hat is so narrow all the way up it looks like a tube with a brim. I am very disappointed
2.0,*update* the band will not stay hooked to the watch!  It just slides right off. :(  The band is great. Nice and solid.  I'm a bit challenged so I had a little trouble taking some links out.  The tool that comes with the band did it's job and made it a bit easier......
2.0,"Not figure flattering, and tight across the chest will be returning."
2.0,"I had high hopes for this. It's super cute, but the pockets stick out. I ordered a medium, so maybe a bigger size would hide them more."
2.0,"These are not loose fitting, but for the price I'll keep them!!!!"
2.0,Fabric is loose and cheep
2.0,Really didn't see much of a vision improvement at all.
2.0,Runs small. My daughter wears a 2T in clothes and the 3T in this swim suit was tight on her.
2.0,its lighter and sheer like a cheap tank top
2.0,To tight adults<br /> great for kids
2.0,Be careful! The mask's dye transferred onto our white duvet and stained it along with our pillowcases. The fabric began to pull away from the mask after only a few wears.
2.0,Package was missing one mask which got sent to me several weeks later.
2.0,This ring is beautiful and well made but it was way to big for me.
2.0,To large and the bill is very long.
2.0,"It looks like the pearls kinda drip off your earlobes. Even though they are well crafted and beautiful, they just blended in with my hair. I must send them back."
2.0,"This watch is not strong or durable, the second hand broke in the first week."
2.0,They look really pretty but are huge! I feel<br />Like they are to big for my face and look odd.
2.0,"I had recently lost 45lbs and needed long sleeve shirts. I bought this one because black is my favorite color and goes with everything. I ordered a XL as it said to size up. The shoulders were tight, the chest was so low cut you could see my stomach if I bent over, and the sleeves were folded in half just to come to my wrists. I'm 5ft, 155, 34c, 30 waist and 36 hip. I'm rather athletically built, but after losing weight, and a pregnancy...I look like a mom.. The trunk of the shirt was baggy and long which I was ok.<br />I would have returned it if I hadn't washed it, hoping that it would shrink. If you have long arms, long torso, or you want to show off your bodacious ta-tas then this is perfect for you!"
2.0,There were strings all over where the stitching come undone. Very cheap quality
2.0,Rosary case is  WAY TOO SMALL Icould not fit my Rosary in to it but had to use it for another purpose
2.0,Picture is so beatifull but when I hand just so so.
2.0,The watch band doesn’t flex when you wear it. Looks pretty good but very uncomfortable to wear
2.0,"The material is very thin, which I expected. I washed it once with cold water on gentle cycle and air dried, went to wear it and could that the stitching on the front v-neck came apart."
2.0,Very large and no shape to it. I didn’t like it.
2.0,"This “shirt extender” is W-A-Y longer than the pictures show. It comes down to my knees (actually PAST my knees in the back). It’s long enough to be a skirt.<br /><br />I DID  pick the right waist size, however. I wear a size 14 and the size 3XXX fit my waist.<br /><br /> Not worth the hassle of  returning."
2.0,"The pattern is nice and as expected, but the fabric feels cheap and not convenient. Wouldn't recommend."
2.0,Had a small hole in the stitching and the material looks cheap.
2.0,I sent it back. It wasn't made of flannel like I expected it to be. Just plain old cotton.
2.0,"I thought it would be more substantial…..it’s very thin and the beads are minuscule. It is pretty however,just less than I expected ."
2.0,The reason for the two stars is that there are multiple stains in several places on the scarf which was very disappointing.
2.0,This blouse was made somewhat small!
2.0,the cut is made for chestier women.  The blue dress with pink flowers is significantly better for smaller chests.
2.0,"They are hard to breathe through, it makes me feel like I am suffocating. The material gets sucked into your mouth if you take a breath with your mouth slightly open or yawn and it feels too thick for me to wear around my neck all day. I have a hard time with things that fit closely around my neck, I cannot wear turtle necks or scarves without feeling like I am choking a bit."
2.0,"After been washed you will have to throw them away because ,they will be too small to wear."
2.0,Thin/cheap material.<br />Will not last long.<br />It’s cute though
2.0,"The band is too stretchy so there's not enough support coming from it. I definitely would have liked the fabric holding the clasp to somehow be reinforced. As you can see in the pic I attached, it just bunches and causes the clasp to go sideways even though the band isn't tight on me. The cups are so separated that the under wire from the side of the cups is digging into my arm pits. I had hoped a front clasping bra would help with pushing the girls closer together, but that definitely doesn't seem to be the case. Also, what the heck is up with the warnings on the bag that it came in? So random. 😂"
2.0,"Cheap quality, golden bow is plastic material, plastic looking inner lining.There's a divider in one of the pockets that can slide out so you can either take it out of the wallet easily or leave it in to be a divider.It was true to its color. It does not appear to be well made, it looks sort of cheap.<br />I gave it 2 start because the shipping was faster then i was told"
2.0,"UNUSABLE. Wasted money. I have no idea how the designer didn’t think about this design before manufacturing. All it would’ve taken was an open hook at the neck. I threw away the packaging before I got around to trying it on, or I’d return it"
2.0,"I didn’t like how short it was in length, bought for work and I kept having to pull it down so I didn’t feel inappropriately dressed. Also you can’t tell which it the front or back and I hate that. There is no tag to distinguish and it fits weird on regardless. Plus I thought this was a smooth cotton texture but it’s not. Just not what I expected. I’ve worn maybe twice cause I tried to give it a second chance. Never again"
2.0,"Another beautiful dress but again, the sizes are wrong."
2.0,"Magnets were not strong enough to use in my nose, when trying to put it in it felt large Inside my nose. Just didn't work out for me."
2.0,"These headbands are super cute, but they leave headband marks on my baby’s head (my baby was only 3 months old and weighed 11 lbs., not very big) and some of the flowers and bows came off after one use because they weren’t glued on well, or the glue wasn’t very good quality. They’re cute but probably will just last for one or two time use and when your baby is very young.<br />Let me know if my review was helpful!"
2.0,The product is nice and soft but i vary from size 6-8 so I ordered M only to realize that it was big! im hoping to retun and get a smaller size.
2.0,"It's really cute, but I went up a size and it was still way too small"
2.0,These were very small I would say more for a preschooler. They did not fit my 6 year old.
2.0,Very cute but really thin.  Was hoping it was more solid
2.0,nice looking and warm.  The problem is the buttons.  Everyone came off.  Before the bottom came off the leather ripped.  I had reinforce the rip and am still having problems with it ripping further
2.0,"Not too sure who to blame for this but there was a hole in one that looked like a box cutter might have gotten it.  Unfortunately I tried one on and it fit so I washed them and now I have a lovely little 1/2"" slit hole that I hope won't get larger."
2.0,Didn't fit my watch
2.0,Bought an xtra large for my 14 yo daughter who likes baggy sweaters and ended up inherited by my 10 yo daughter who usually wears a small.
2.0,This is a super cute earring!  My only problem with it is that after 2 days it turns your ear very green!
2.0,"The band came on time, but wasn’t exactly was described in the info. It was very flimsy and was very hard to put on the watch."
2.0,I got a medium (that’s typically my size) and when it arrived it was ginormous. It is like a trash bag. It has no waist at all. Extremely thin itchy material
2.0,One broke and the other tarnished in less than a month....
2.0,Spend the money and buy something of better shape
2.0,"Really liked the fit of the blouse. The dress itself was good quality, fit well, and was pretty. The apron strings, however, were way too short -- I could barely tie a bow, even when pulled as tight as possible. It looked  unflattering and ridiculous. The fabric wasn't very nice either. Had to return it."
2.0,The top fits the arms could be a tapered wanted to love it but disappointed
2.0,I’ve only had this wallet for a couple weeks and the lovely blue color is rubbing off the outside edges to show the white underneath. This is merely from sliding the wallet in and out of my back pocket. The blue is also coming off the center fold on the inside. Otherwise the wallet is fine.
2.0,Did not fit well. Much too small and took a while to arrive. :/
2.0,Very thin material and the dress is almost too transparent to wear.  I do think this would have made a good dress if the material was not as cheap.
2.0,"This leotard/tutu combo is adorable and my 2 year old loves it! However, it is already coming apart wherever the fabric covers the elastic. Poor quality sewing"
2.0,It was nice but way to small.
2.0,"These are ridiculously baggy and unflattering. They look nothing like the picture, except for the color and the fact that they’re overalls. They’re not a tapered leg, they’re not flattering. They’re baggy in all the wrong places; like a box of fabric."
2.0,Product received was not as pictured. :( Sad
2.0,The shorts were packaged nice but a dirt spot is right in the belly area about the size of a dime. The fit is good though.
2.0,The material is a body hugger.
2.0,"I REALLY wanted to like this since I previously ordered a hair clip of the same design and wanted to wear as a set. The colored cabochon ""stones"" were the same as the hair clip and well made and placed. My problem with this piece is the metal. This is a tension bracelet and EVERYWHERE there was a seam or bend in the metal, it was heavily tarnished (actually black) and really brought down the look of the item. Sadly I can not recommend this particular item."
2.0,"The dress was really pretty, but was small."
2.0,Fit has expected. Was good til first wash and it fell apart. Sewing around the top came undone and thread wrapped around it. I'm trying to.see if i.can fix them myself since i liked them and the fit.
2.0,I was disappointed the bag was advertised as a Granada but it is small. It was too late to return it so I kept it.
2.0,No support for bust whatsoever. The straps are way too long and cannot be adjusted.
2.0,Not comfortable and too small. The cups tightened my breasts and I am small breasted...
2.0,"Lexol works a lot better. For whatever reason, this neatsfoot oil seems to dry out the leather."
2.0,Installed an put glasses on felt extremely tight. Glasses push on my eyes.
2.0,"not too tight, but too short."
2.0,"Credit cards barely fit in slots.  If they added a little more leather, it would be a great wallet.  It's not worth the money now.  Have the manufacturer try putting credit cards in the slots and then try to get them out again an see how happy they are with their product."
2.0,"THIS SMOCK IS HEAVY, CROOKED, AND VERY UNCOMFORTABLE!!!!! DO NOT PURCHASE! WAS SERIOUSLY HOPING FOR A BETTER BUY CONSIDERING THE PRICE!!!!!!!"
2.0,Not really impressed
2.0,"Started wearing these earings once I got them. After a week or so, I noticed the color started to fade. They tarnished!"
2.0,Waistline has no give.  Wish they came in size 18 or at least have the adjustable band inside.
2.0,Ordered XL. Too small by at least 1 size.  Unable to return.
2.0,too fat for my pocket
2.0,"I wear about a size 8 in shoes and these were crazy tight, my toes felt forced to bend and couldn’t straighten well."
2.0,"When I first put it on, I had a VERY hard time finding the slit in the side for the string to go through to tie it.  My husband had to help me find it. Took us a while.<br />Once we found it (very small hole)<br />I tried it on again and tied it up. Nice wrap style dress. Very lightweight but the material is very clingy.<br />I love the print. I got Green in size XXL<br />V neck"
2.0,Color and material was awful
2.0,"Color is nice and rich, but the one I received has bad stiches all over. One of the straps was unstiched and the underwire was poking out. Both are things i can fix, but i should not have to."
2.0,This was very cute with a great feel to the material. It just wasn't adjustable and therefore was too short for my torso.
2.0,"It has the potential to be cute. I REALLY wanted it to fit. But the shoulders are so weird, they don't fit correctly. The bottom half fits great but the top half is very large. There's a bunch of extra material on my lower back before my butt."
2.0,"Great quality, beautifully packaged however the design of the earring is off. The design is only on one side so the way they will sit on the earlobe displays the backside of the earring with s925 engraved mark....if the design were two sided they would be perfect as the style, size and quality are great."
2.0,too dark for me to usel.
2.0,Nonera lo que esperaba. Muy pequeño
2.0,Bothered my ears.
2.0,Be careful with the name of the color.  I ordered the first pic with dark yellow and black.  Then I received light gray and baby blue. Quality fine though. Sleeves a tad too short.  I got a medium and I’m 5 foot 6.  I don’t have crazy long arms so it’s kind of weird that they are short
2.0,They're useful but not very attractive. Non-skid but flimsy. I've tripped a couple of times because the front would fold on itself when stepping (not clearing the floor well).
2.0,It’s a very cute dress but the sizing is WAY off. My daughter is 4 and wears a 5T. I ordered the 4-5year and the 5-6year sizes.  They were both INCREDIBLY small.  The 5-6 year fit like a 2T!  So frustrating. Returning both.
2.0,"Bad quality, Bad material."
2.0,Would be a nice bag if not for the weird zipper. It's not sewn end to end on the bag and it's got a &#34;tail&#34; that's about 4&#34; that just hangs there. The color is not exactly as shown either. i got the red bag but the color is more faded than the photo online. I'm returning the bag.
2.0,"I received this and immediately put it in for a holiday party. Tons of people complimented me on it and I really love how it looks.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after wearing it for some time, I noticed that my septum was a little raw. It progressed to some pain when I would pull certain expressions, and then a general, constant throb at which point I switched back to a surgical steel ring purchased from my piercer. The throbbing ceased quickly after and the tenderness was back to normal after a day or so.<br /><br />I'm not sure what went wrong here, except perhaps this isn't actually surgical steel, or somehow the gold plating irritated the piercing site, or maybe it was just too tight.<br /><br />Edit: I did attempt to wear a second time, but as soon as I closed it, my nose was on fire."
2.0,Material is scratchy and too large.
2.0,Blah... you have to have a perfect shape for this dress!
2.0,Size is great price was great but it has a rip on it already right out of the package.. my daughter loves it so much that she would let me send it back so I just sewed it up
2.0,Huge! Got these for my 2 1/2 year old son. He is average size. These were huge on him and he didn’t like the way they are hooked together with the string.
2.0,Waste of money. The latch went the first time I clipped it in her ear.
2.0,Doesn't fit like I expected to I only wear it when needed
2.0,"The length of this cami was way too short, and the sizing it at least one, if not two sizes two small. Between the snug fit and the short length I will be returning this item. The fabric is also almost swim suit like, which I want expecting."
2.0,Feels like I'm walking the side of the sole
2.0,The material was thin and fit small.  I threw away bag it was in so could not return it.  Disappointed.
2.0,Nice at first until the diamonds fall off after a day.
2.0,"Very thin, costume-y material (for lack of a better description). Also, the Burgundy color is more like a bright candy red."
2.0,Details are hardly detectable.  Mama Bear lettering so small and same for the heart.  I would not buy this again.
2.0,Clasp broke on third use. Fantastic look and fit... Just can't handle abuse of an almost 5 year old.
2.0,They are nice socks but the toes are too tight.  I have other sock patterns from this company and haven't have any trouble with the toes in them.
2.0,Awkward shape and the zipper was off center. Returned
2.0,Bought it for a Christmas present for my boyfriend. The magnets fell out the first day we had them.
2.0,Sort of clings to you if you have any kind of tummy!
2.0,I lost one earring. I liked them so much I ordered another pair in the exact design. They are not the same and do not resemble the picture.  There are far fewer twists in the new hoops and the look is totally different. I would not have bought them had I know this or even suspected this was the case.
2.0,The pockets for these lay on my butt. It would have been better with no pockets. The materiel is so light and thin that pockets can't support any weight of anything anyways..
2.0,Not a fan of this hat. I don’t think I have a big head but this hat is too shallow and fits really weird. I won’t be wearing this one.
2.0,"I ordered the XS and the S and the XS was too small and the pockets stood way out. The Small was really wide around my waste and the pockets still stood out, not a nice fit at all. I  ended up returning both of them. I'm 5'4/115 lbs."
2.0,"Holy crap, half of them came broken or nearly broken. Some were sewn up all jagged and bad, the sizes were like...too big, too small, and the ones that were just right were...again...broken or hanging on by a thread. I mean they are cheap so I cannot complain, but I am going to anyway because might as well hit up Claires or some junk store like that and get some then buy these because they will all break and you'll be out the money anyway."
2.0,"Fit well in torso, but way too long (I'm 5'6"").  Tailoring looked a little rough.  Sent it back."
2.0,Seriously couldn’t be any thinner.  Definitely not high quality or resilient.
2.0,We ordered fit to size and the pants were freaking clown pants and looked like it could fit multiple people !! And definitely make sure you order in advance so you can get it fixed !🙄
2.0,"I ordered the blouses to wear with jeans and possibly to the office. Fabric is too thin, feels almost like one layer of a tissue paper; see through and needs a camisole to wear to the office. Based on the chart I ordered XL for both blouses, both did not fit. While they were quite roomy, they both have weird cut that pulls on the shoulders and is too small. It is also tight when you try to cross your arms. Then I figure it out-shoulders are different and the shorter one pulls the shirt to the side.<br />Overall it is way over priced for what it is : stitching is not good, fabric is too thin, design is left alot  to be desired, it is too short and on the sides even cannot be tucked in with a skirt or pants...it may work for somebody in XS or S. I am 5,7 and 165 lb and neither one of two blouses worked for me."
2.0,Somehow two of the boxers tore already on the extract same side and shape. First I thought it might have been do small but when I read the label it was my size. So yea this boxer are pretty bad
2.0,Looks nice but the clasp is not really a 'clasp'..it comes apart easily. I found it on the classroom floor one day..didn't know it fell off!
2.0,I usually were a size 10/10.5 I ordered a 10 they got here quickly but when. I tried them on it was looking more like a size 8.5/9. Very disappointed & will have to buy completely new pair for my event. I will definitely be returning shoes. Please please please read before you buy!
2.0,"Not short sleeve ugh these shirts are cap sleeve:( If you have broad shoulders, as I do , I wouldn't recommend these even though the photos appear to have at least a quarter sleeve to keep it from bunching up in your armpits,they do not.<br />The torso is plenty long but I haven't washed any of them yet to see if they shrink"
2.0,Ok for the pieces only not the chain
2.0,I'm barely over five feet and I feel like this was way too short for me to wear.
2.0,"Soft and lightly padded, no support. Comfortable goo for around the house or to sleep in.....Glad l didn't pay a lot for it."
2.0,I really want to love this strap. 2 issues though:<br /><br />1) The leather stained 3 of my Oxford shirts in the first week of wear.<br />2) Screw on the buckle came loose while on business in first week of wear. I was able to find a watch store with a small enough screw driver to fix it. Resolved.
2.0,"I bought this bookbag for my daughter to start her school year and it lasted I would say 1 month and a week until the zippers completely got off their tracks. The bookbag itself is beautiful, and the lunch bag and water bottle are good too, just wished it lasted longer."
2.0,It's cute. But the clasp broke pretty easily. A shame because I really liked it.
2.0,"I liked this while it lasted. I bought this one in green on the 17th of April and the inside plastic that holds the screw in broke off. Not sure how it happened, I only wear this 2 days of the week for work and it is always tucked under my compression sleeves and I change the band to another one for my personal use at home. This was purchased for work and I needed something durable. Now I am on the search for a new one."
2.0,Cute dress but I ordered a small and it fit like a large
2.0,"They attempt to stay up, and they stay up longer then normal socks like these. But they do slip"
2.0,"Much shorter than I expected, bigger than I expected and looks like a maternity shirt or very mini dress.  I am very short so it is rare that anything is too short on me."
2.0,"The beats are very cute and fit well, but made with very cheap material!!  It’s spliting after four times wearing it!!🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬"
2.0,Turned copper after a while.
2.0,"After reading the reviews, it must be that everyone gets something different. Mine is much shorter than pictured, tight in the arms and definitely not the same look as pictured. It looks more like a sweatshirt than a sweater."
2.0,"I have these pants in the Eclipse and the Grey as well. the Black are totally see through and the material is itchy. the Eclipse started ripping in the crotch after 3 washes. so, these are cheap leggings that are a bit inconsistent that will likely last you a few months."
2.0,"too loose, not tight"
2.0,I ordered one of these to go with a costume and to where at my sisters wedding. It does not work. I was sent a new one free of charge that didnt work. I was refunded my purchase. Overall bad item GREAT CS!
2.0,"The quality of the material was good, but by the second week one of the shoe light stopped working."
2.0,Big and overly bulky. Not a thin and sleek design. Think &#34;old fashioned Aviator's goggles&#34; but sunglasses. Perfect for a wide or pudgy faced person.
2.0,"Maybe my expectations were too high. I really expected to receive a well-made piece of clothing for this price. At first, they actually look like a decent pair of lederhosen, but when you look a bit closer you see that they are just very good approximations. First, the sizing. I took everyone's advice and ordered one size larger so a 58 (42"") instead of a 56 (40""), but they just gave me a pair with a waist that was too big. They fit OK through the seat, but the legs were tiny like they were make for someone without thigh muscles. I could not even sit down in them and had to loosen the leg hem buttons to even walk around. The leather (if that's what it is) appears very thin; almost a veneer. The buckles on the front of the H suspenders are cheap, stamped junk. The suspenders themselves are apt to fail in just a few wearings. All in all I was very disappointed and have continued my search for a real pair of lederhosen."
2.0,I ordered one size too big by most sizes and it's way small on me not much loose fit. Disappointed to find out after I bought it made in China.
2.0,It's a little low cut from what I was expecting and not because it's cut that way but because the straps are too long- which results in the armpit holes being really low too. It's a weird fit. I wouldn't recommend.
2.0,"Big in hips area, has a lot of stretch would recommend chosing size by bust."
2.0,"These definitly keep me warm on cold rides while still breathing well. I'm 6""3' with a 33/34 inseam and these are long. Not so long that its an issue but there is no sock visible. Unfortunately the ankle zipper on one leg broke, and the other side is sticking. Seller has been contacted and did reply but then went quiet not replying to two follow-up emails."
2.0,"The skull ring was kind of messed up because the skull was facing downward rather than forward. Also the &#34;nail jewelry&#34; ring looks horrible. I got over it. Its a cheap product & if someone doesn't see it close up, I guess it appears cute."
2.0,"It's a little too shiny and I don't see myself using it at all.  Otherwise, it's a well made purse."
2.0,I like the look of this tank but the material is spandex and just not flattering at all I have never worn it and thought I might one day but every time I take it off the gamer I put it back.
2.0,Very short in length. Not as pictured.
2.0,"I love the coat, great for all types of storms.  But the zipper has never worked properly.  Doesn't thread accurately and gets stuck often.  Exchanged the first coat and got the same result with the second one."
2.0,Color not has shown and runs small.
2.0,Too large and a bit too thick for a dressy shirt.
2.0,"Yo pedí talla mediana, pero esta más pequeño, si me queda, pero muy justo, tipo, a la chica se le ve medio suelto, y largo, y pues no me quedo así ;( esta muy justo, y corto, pero me gusto de todos modos, buena tela :)"
2.0,Did not look good in py
2.0,I like the product but if you get them wet it stains.
2.0,the picture is very hard to see and it tarnished quickly leaving a green mark on the wrist.  I would not recommend this product.
2.0,"One lace was perfect.  The other unraveled at one tip.  That defeats the purpose of permanent , comfortable fixed laces."
2.0,"It's a shame I have to leave a 2-star review as the glasses seem so promising. I ordered the green frame with the leopard print on the sides, and the frame is sturdy, well-made and fashionable. I also loved the additional touch of including a money-print glasses cleaning cloth, and felt the box the glasses came in was quite sleek and giftable as well.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I immediately noticed that this item did not include a blue light testing light and card, which sort of made me suspicious as I've previously ordered other anti-blue light glasses that include the light and card. I took the blue light blocking light and card from another pair I'd previously ordered, and tested them on this set of glasses. I could instantly tell that the glasses were not blocking blue light, as the light was able to penetrate the lenses and mark the card. On 2-3 other pairs of glasses that were all advertised as blue light blockers, I tested them and the light did not mark the card.<br /><br />This leads me to conclude that the glasses do NOT effectively blocking blue light, and they are only good to be worn as an accessory. I am giving this two stars because the glasses are well made and stylish otherwise."
2.0,"I should have read the description better. I thought this would be more cotton and less polyester. In the photo the dress had a slit at the bottom and I assumed the buttons held the dress together. You could also see through the dress pretty easily. However, this dress is good if you are just looking for something lightweight. Ideal for the pool/beach."
2.0,I wore them once and when I removed them from my ears I noticed the color was changing/tarnished.
2.0,"The dress fit okay, material was a little thin (as expected for the price), but the slit was way too high. I felt like I could flash someone if I wasn’t careful. I have to juggle a 5 month old so the high slit was not ideal."
2.0,Fit is very poor - very expensive for what you actually get - I would not recommend it and mine was also damaged on the neck area. I returned it
2.0,"Cotton wasn’t very soft,felt like cheap material.Get what you pay for."
2.0,"The sweatshirt was supposed to be a Christmas gift but had to return it due to the thinness of the material, I was very disappointed when i opened the package to wrap it. For the price point this sweatshirt is not worth the money."
2.0,Does not fit a 36dd
2.0,"I purchased these for an outdoor wedding, by the end of the day the heel had pushed through the disc that is supposed to keep you from sinking into the ground."
2.0,Too small and poor quality.
2.0,"The colors were vibrant.  I feel like the dress would have been very comfortable however, I did not get to wear it because it was too small."
2.0,Top was 3 sized too big and bottom was 8 sizes too small. would have lived it if it fit
2.0,It's looks good... but it is not exactly same with the pictures. It have A little bit different from pictures. . In pictures it looks bright yellow color but in real its color fade yellow. And it's material quality is no so good.<br />And its not stiched. I thought it will be stiched. Because they did not mention it's stiched or not. They only mentioned it's free size.<br />And one of another problem is its liner clothes is not enough to make adjust with the dress. That's why I have to buy another liner.
2.0,Thin wrinkled cheap product.  I bought three different hats from three different companies and this was the worst.
2.0,"Like the comments before some of the backs don’t come off well and there were some sharp pieces that weren’t cut off. I guess it’s cheap so it’s fine, but I didn’t like them so I refunded it."
2.0,This has two strings holding it together. Cheaply made and ill fitting. Returned :(
2.0,Not cute on me. I have a small butt and thin legs. I am more top heavy. This style looked dumpy on my body type. Not a fan I returned them
2.0,Strange fit. And it doesn't quite lay down right on the body. I don't know if I will actually wear this
2.0,"To begin with the bag was much smaller than I imaged.  The quality and materials is not good.  There were, before I cut them off, lots of sharp, pointy plastic bits, on the seams and whatnot that would poke my hands. Furthermore, in less than 2 years of ownership, the interior fabric dividers are torn. Spend a little bit more and buy something of higher quality that will hold up.."
2.0,If you have any Boobs this will be right
2.0,"This dress was a beautiful bright pink color, however, the stitching at the waist was horribly uneven and the dress hung sloppily on me. I had to return."
2.0,"When I requested this, I had no idea what size it would be. Doesn't seem to matter, because no one I know will wear this item. I will be using it for doll clothing, which will work quite nice."
2.0,"Very big, very long. Not the material I expected."
2.0,Very pretty. Came on time. No way would this fit! I 'm normally between sizes 16-18.  I usually wear Xlarge.  It's a shame because it's a nice dress and I would have liked to have it for my vacation.
2.0,One of the pink ones broke the same day I put it on my daughter’s coat. The spring fell out or something—it won’t stay clipped.
2.0,"Everything is pretty nice this except for the fact that the &#34;slider&#34; or bead that holds each end of the bracelet in place is not made of the same metal as the rest, and after a week, that piece is turning my wrist green wherever it sits for a while. I would probably return it if it were worth the effort to do so...."
2.0,Too thin for the oakleys
2.0,"Very tight gloves, doesn’t hold up to work"
2.0,They are cheap for a reason but look cute.
2.0,Run very small. Size up 1-2 sizes when ordering
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:28a4bd7807571afd89c3def6889219e1]] Arrived covered in gooey fingerprints and scratches. There are also little black  dot-like Imperfections in the lenses. This is after I cleaned them, but these were clearly used and worn and probably returned, and then the company sold me returned murchandise. Not awesome. The style and fit of the glasses is amazing but I would have liked them not covered in someone else’s finger-funk and scratches."
2.0,Not that flattering
2.0,"Really big on my face, but will still wear them on upcoming trip"
2.0,"I loved the fabric, it was exactly what I wanted. But the dress was ridiculously small. I didn't even try it on. I ordered a medium and got maybe an XS.  The label said M."
2.0,Not great beachwear
2.0,Image on shirt started to crack after only one wash. I always put my shirts in the dryer on low setting. It never came with instructions not to do this. Other than that the material of the shirt is very soft and good quality.
2.0,"At first, I loved this item because it seemed true to the picture online. It's beautiful, cozy and, quite big...So, it could have been great for winters. But, it sheds a lot!! I could see shreds of it on my clothes and everywhere in my house. I would have kept it if quality of the material was better."
2.0,Slow delivery but very good product. Wife appreciated it much.
2.0,The style and color were true to the pics but unfortunately I was sent an obviously used pair so they were quickly returned.
2.0,"I wouldn't buy this again. I really like the padded area on the foot bottom (there isn't net there so it won't rip), but why the heck is there not a normal panty?  No one needs the netting to go up that high, and even if you wanted the entire leg to be netted for some outfits, the panty area certainly does not need the netting.  If you make one as I described, I would buy it, b/c so far the netting seems stronger than usual."
2.0,Doesn't really look like shown and the logo is cheaply made. It also had a missing patch of logo. The  fabric is okay but better of ordering simple tank top instead if the logo Is that bad...
2.0,These socks seem like nylon. I do not think they are bamboo.  The patterns  are  nice however
2.0,"It looks pretty when it lays just right. But the metal is light and flimsy, so it often looks odd."
2.0,"I was super excited for this band, I wore it for about 3 hours before one of the chains broke. Very disappointing."
2.0,It’s cute but you have to baby the clasp. Twice I have almost lost it because the clasp doesn’t stay closed.
2.0,Definitely not squat proof. You can see straight through them even with no underwear. I can only wear these to sleep in. They are comfy but not for working out!
2.0,Doesn't look like the pictures. Doesn't go to your ears but it's sparkly and pretty.
2.0,"The material feels how i expect the hat to feel, very comfortable. visor/brim is fine. back of the hat - A okay. front of the hat seems slighty bent and cheap, and as intended, there's no adjusting the part where it's folded. Maybe I should've studied the preview of the hat more before purchasing, I'm realizing it looks nothing like I expected.<br /><br />If what I described presents a potential problem for you, i recommend checking out similar hats like http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00892KGBO/ref=twister_B00DR7M3U8?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1<br />(looks a lot less cheap in the front and the fold looks neat and good in the front).<br />Happy clicking"
2.0,"Depending on how you like your clothes to fit you might want to order a size smaller than you typically would.  I am 5'9"" 148 lbs and I ordered a medium and it definitely was about 2 - 3 inches too large in the waist/hip area.  It made the dress appear like a sack on me.  It was very unflattering. I would have loved to tried a smaller size but they were sold out of smalls."
2.0,The belt on the left has no 'tongue' that goes in the hole for the strap so it just hangs. There is no way to fix it either.
2.0,Broke very easily!
2.0,"I thought the black with pineapple pattern was adorable, and it was in person very cute, but the fabric itself is cheap (which I guess I should expect for the price). Seems to be the kind that will pill quickly, and its very thin so you can see through it."
2.0,Very comfortable. Doesn't pinch or grab hairs. Looks great on my Gear S3<br /><br />My only problem is that the latch will sometimes get very loose and it has caused my watch to completely fall off and I now have a nice scratch on the watch screen.
2.0,"The product doesn’t fit the watch properly to start. Worse off, the clasp buckle pin doesn’t reach the end of the buckle. It just goes through it. Which means the strap moves back and forth. Very disappointed as this seems like it would be an easy thing to have right."
2.0,"UGH! I am so frustrated. The first one of these hats I ordered was soft and slouchy and perfect.  I have ordered 3 more in different colors now and all have been NOT slouchy, rougher material, and just a regular knit hat with no give or stretch. I am frustrated! There is no quality control.  The hat looks nothing like the picture because there is no slouch.  I am so disappointed that I can't seem to order one that is soft and slouchy now.  So, do I have to order 15 more and hope that ONE of them is the soft, slouchy kind and not the tight, non slouch ones. What's the deal??"
2.0,Ring was very wide and didn’t fit comfortable in my daughters nose
2.0,"The arms are smaller than normal, I have many smart wool vests that fit perfectly. This is very tight in the arms"
2.0,The first time I washed these shorts they shrunk and I had to return them. What a hassle.
2.0,"These thigh highs are the worse I've ever purchased.  They're not very durable.  I wore a pair and by the end of the day, my toe had ripped through.  That's not acceptable."
2.0,3x fit a person. Who wears a large and it is snug.<br /><br />Quality is good<br />Jacket is soft ans warm
2.0,The letters with the quote were smaller than the ones in the picture. You need a magnifier to read them.
2.0,I would truly love to buy clothes through some of these vendors.  But so often the merchandise is inconsistent.  I feel as if my dress was cut out with multiple pattern pieces and I got the miscut one from the bottom. I wear a large. I ordered an xlarge thinking I could always take it even if need be.........I look like a sausage. Too tight across the breast and came above my ankles.
2.0,"The dress fit okay...but the material was cheap, and the ties laid weirdly along the front. I guess the lower quality should be expected from the price point, but...I’ve paid similar price and gotten wayyy better quality<br /><br />Returned : ("
2.0,"The idea of this bag is great, and what i hate about it someone else might like... but it is so stiff!  It's super hard to get anything in and out of it."
2.0,It's too large for me.
2.0,Some of the balls were smaller than others and i had some issues with shipping. The gems are horribly placed. And the bars are very small.
2.0,Did not like the straps would have been better if it was leather straps.
2.0,"Lock will not stay on one of them.  They did help stretch out one pair of pants, but if there is any spandex, it will not work. It bounces back to the spandex memory and is a total waste of time.<br />Be very  careful with them as they are not made out of heavy weight metal and can bend very easily."
2.0,The color is way off from the photo. It is an ugly brown not yellow brown .
2.0,The cut was good but the fabric looked like a couch from the 70's. I returned it.
2.0,I got a 3 pack in 3 different colors but the 3 colors all fit different... Seems crazy but the red with black stiching fits wonderful and I really enjoy them. The black with red stiching and gray both fit like the waist band is sitting lower on my body so that while I am at the gym I am constantly stretching them back up so they cover my butt. Very weird but if they all fit like the one red pair that came in the pack I'd her very stoked on these
2.0,i got this for my wife and she ware it twice and the band brook and the spring is missing . it sucks its to cheaply maid i would never by it again.
2.0,"As mentioned above, the mask does not sit well on my face. The design has a downward pull on the mask. I tried to like it, may modify it."
2.0,"So unlike the great photo. Material, studs, style... not good!"
2.0,These fell out of my ear. Lost one. Unable to wear. Clasp should be better. Very pretty though.
2.0,"Fit is nothing like the photo. Length is not long like in the photo. Somewhat nice shirt, but Not as described."
2.0,"Its cheaply made.  Really disappointed, I could have gotten this at the dollar tree for 2 bucks."
2.0,They lock is not secure enough! You cant play guitar and wear it! I jerry rigged the lock! The Leather I love!!
2.0,"I love this dress, but I am disappointed that the color is not as advertised.  The Royal blue is a much more muted and lighter color than the bright blue in the picture.  That is disappointing, but the cut is cute and flattering."
2.0,The quality of the fabric is just as good as Carhartts but they shrink several sizes after washing. Unfortunately have to return them.
2.0,The dress is cute but I ordered 110cm and it was too small. I have to reorder 120 cm
2.0,"Decent quality and sizing is fine if you have short arms and short torso.<br />Not meant for anyone 5' 7"" or taller"
2.0,Returned it. It’s a pretty pattern and nice fabric but mine was coming apart at the seams when I received it. I tried it on anyway and it was smaller than I hoped for. It’s on the shorter side and it’s a snug fit. I considered reordering but one size up and then decided not to since it was coming apart at the seams and I didn’t want to risk it again.
2.0,"La calidad es buena, pero es un corte de camiseta común.<br />No tiene el corte tipo túnica más amplio a la altura de la cadera y más larga atrás."
2.0,Material was all spandex like. Looks much different in person. Was disappointed in this.
2.0,Too small order one size bigger. I always wear a medium and felt like I really had to struggle to get these up and then I didn’t dare bend over for fear my but my show
2.0,Nice looking glasses but cheaply made with plastic
2.0,The material does not cover me well. A litle movement causes it to open up.
2.0,Fit well but not as fancy as the picture needed nicer pants for work they are ok
2.0,I ordered a size xl for my daughter who is 5’3 140lbs it fits my daughter that’s 5’5 105lbs so it runs a lot smaller
2.0,This definitely doesn’t look like the picture. I feel frumpy in it but it’s pretty enough to get by for what I need it for. If you can get something else. I would go that route. Price was good.
2.0,"Paper thin, looks and feels cheap. Disappointed, I returned. Style was nice and color was nice.  The arm holes were a little large."
2.0,"I purchased the S/M they were too small, returned and purchased the L/XL and they were too big. Nice quality though."
2.0,"Very cute if it would stay on your ear without hurting you, but it doesn't."
2.0,SUPER TINY and cheap
2.0,"I bought by the size chart. It has nothing but completely sheer material, no fabric front, no weight. Did not come in as pictured. Putting it on, because there is no fabric weight, the front falls to rest under my arms."
2.0,The metal silver was paint and got full of air bubbles
2.0,"The dress has the potential to be very cute, but it is cut way to large.  The arm cutouts went way below the side band of my bra.  Considered having &quot;it altered, but that would cost more than I paid for the dress.  I'm 5'7&quot;, 149lbs, nornally wear a M or 8/10 in dresses."
2.0,Was not a fan of the material. May have been my fault because I didn’t read what the material was but I’m currently waiting for my return label because it was that unflattering.
2.0,"I was disappointed greatly, of course it would look better in the picture, however it is exteamly thick and heavy with big bulging glass over the front. If it was thin, without the huge glass and just slightly smaller it would carry great potential."
2.0,Beautiful sweater but it ran small. I returned it.
2.0,Top and bottom do not match. The top is vibrant and the bottom is dull.
2.0,The image looks cheap. The size was not true medium.
2.0,It was small and the star wasn’t on it
2.0,"Didn't like it, look like something to sleep in"
2.0,"I have some old AhhBras that need replacement and thought I'd try a different brand.  I researched the sizing and ordered what seemed right.  I'm a 32F so I got the large but that was way off, even with the liner.  I returned these pretty quickly and just bought new AhhBras (small).  Thankfully Amazon Prime makes trying bras easy to do!"
2.0,These shoes are just as cute as they look in the picture but are like half of another size 4 shoe I ordered. Way to small!!!!
2.0,Dress was cute for a one time wear. It would rise up with every step. I spent most of the time yanking it down. I am curvy if you have a flat bottom it might work for you.  Plus when you look at it up close there were a few loose threads.
2.0,"I guess this could work on women with smaller breasts and chests in general. I am a 38D and this did not fit at all, even though I'm usually a large. I would have to see this garment in a 2xl in order for it to fit. The material looked good however."
2.0,Neckline fits weird.
2.0,looks very sloppy on me
2.0,Tissue thin fabric and very wrinkled
2.0,I gave this to my brother for his first house and they did look very cheap
2.0,This was not a good purchase for me. After a few wears the metal wire came out and I had to them it away.
2.0,"It's not what you think if you watch Hardcore Pawn. You can't look at things up close. You have to do it from a distance which kind of takes the point, and the fun away from using this product."
2.0,"Broke within the first wearing (just putting it on), perhaps it wasn’t crimped well. These can be fixed on your own if you have some tools, but won’t last long unless crimped well."
2.0,"Nothing like the picture, this is not a crewneck sweatshirt, it’s a long sleeve t-shirt."
2.0,"While these insoles are a good quality, they are MUCH shorter than I need them to be. When the arrived I realized that they are produced and shipped from China and, apparently, not sized for American feet. I will do a little more due diligence before I order insoles again, and will not be ordering this brand again."
2.0,"I don't know how you other tall people were able to fit in this. I'm 6'2"" and about 210 lbs. I ordered the largest size they had (3XL) and even pulling the (VERY) tight pants up past my ankles the seat pad was still sitting about 6 inches beneath my groin area. The quality seemed fine, but I couldn't exactly test it. Maybe this will work if you're a smaller person."
2.0,Cute but made my neck turn green in 2 days
2.0,Very small and transparent.
2.0,"It looks good, but didn't last long."
2.0,within 1 week the charm fell off...:-(  and the saying was so small i could hardly see what it says
2.0,Very pretty color with sparkly stones.  I was happy with beads until the stones fell out of them.  Did not hold up well at all.
2.0,"Ordered this with a “mango gold” buckle, which should have been the same as rose gold per other reviews. It came with a plain gold colored buckle.  I’m not sure if it was a mistake or mango is really plain gold???  I’d like the rose gold buckle if it exists...."
2.0,"Bought several, all of them started falling apart in 2 months."
2.0,"bought based on reviews of “fits larger heads”. Ordered the large of course, definitely too small.<br />Keep searching...."
2.0,I've finally learned my lesson that these dresses (and a good amount of clothing on here) don't look the same (or even similar) as they do on the models.
2.0,The fake jewel popped off twice.
2.0,Broken after just a couple months
2.0,After all the exchanging and them loosing one pair of the shorts returned and charging me for the lost pair I finally get one that looks to be stitched properly.
2.0,These are OK. But I guess you get what you pay for. They’re very thin and feel a little bit like burlap. I definitely wouldn’t buy them again
2.0,Too fancy for my taste!
2.0,Very pretty but I was hoping it was more on the mustard side or a dualer yellow from the pictures... instead it is shocking bright lemon yellow. So going to try rit dye for mustard seed instead of returning because it is beautiful made and fits well.
2.0,The colors were so off and some of the colors in the swatches weren’t compatible with the colors from her book. This would have been useful if the colors weren’t off.
2.0,the pants fit good but the pocket zippers broke in the same week so can't use the pockets because of the flawed zippers and the high placement of the pockets.  Definitely need the zippers to hold items in the pockets.
2.0,Very thin material and can stretch out easily
2.0,"These pants were not made for thighs like mine. Pull the waist too high and it looks like there's no fabric between my legs at all, and even when adjusted the pant fabric continually gets pulled between my thighs and bunches there until it's literally pulled back out. That makes walking any distance maddening, as one hand has to be devoted to keeping fabric free at all times unless you had the foresight to bring a safety pin."
2.0,Came with only one earing back. This was supposed to be a Christmas gift.
2.0,Hem doesn’t lay flat and gathers in a weird way.  Makes it look cheap.
2.0,Solution leaked all inside the so I received 1/4 bottle of product very disappointed.<br />Shoe cleaner itself was meh... at best try something different.
2.0,Was pretty in the picture but didn’t fit like I had wanted.
2.0,"Bought these for a one time ski trip. The tightening strap ripped off when I tried to use it the very first day! By the end of a three day trip, they had multiple holes and were tearing apart. Would recommend you look els-wear of spend a little more money."
2.0,"Nice texture. But very boxy, doesn't flatter."
2.0,Order Xl and it didn’t fit need 2 size bigger I’m a 18 plus size but the outfit is pretty mad cause I ordered a xxl in another similar outfit and that was too big giving the dress to my daughter..
2.0,"The frames on these sunglasses are very square and do not form to fit your face. The reflective lens can be heard to see out of and often gives me a headache if I wear them too long. The frame is medal, especially where the nose piece is. It’s just a pair of decorative glasses for photo ops and that’s really it."
2.0,Cute design but EXTREMELY SMALL. I'm 5'3 111 pounds and the suit was so small and constricting. I ordered a small like I usually do. Most of the time small fits but not this one. I think they might be kid sizes. I gave it 2 stars because if it were bigger I would definitely  eep it.
2.0,The ring has a pretty design but the stones are awful. I know it is costume but I have lots of stainless and silver jewelry that is beautiful and not cheap looking. The stones are pasted in and not very neatly. Would pass on this one.
2.0,"I'm 5'10&#34; and 160 lbs. I normally wear Medium or a size 8 in Ann Taylor, Old Navy and Banana Republic. Sometimes I'll wear a size 10 depending on the cut. Because of the reviews, I ordered the red and navy dresses in Large. The dress came to about 4 inches above my knees and it was skin tight. Looked pretty raunchy. I think a XXL might have been better for me and would offer a more professional look. Not sure if the length would be the same (knee length) as depicted in the picture - preferable for a corporate environment. I give it 2 stars because of its potential to look professional if I ordered 2 to 3 sizes up."
2.0,I was hoping to replace my Uniqlo ultra light down however this jacket was not quite as warm. Also the zipper got stuck on several occasions so I ended up having to return it.
2.0,it is hard to walk in the sirt because i is too tight. its a cute skirt and material feels smooth and seems a bit thin.  I need to return for one size up
2.0,"They are nice, except I made a mistake and ordered the wrong size. These are very small and hard to work with"
2.0,"The colors on the dress are not bright/bold at all. Very very poor tie dye job, kinda looks home made by a first timer, not a professional clothing line. The fit and material were nice for more of a loose, t shirt dress kinda vibe, just not a cute pattern at all."
2.0,"This was super cheap, so I thought I'd buy it b/c it is somewhat pretty.  It's very cheaply made.  The chain was broken when I got it, but why bother returning it if it's only around $1?  I will most likely use the pendant for decorative purposes or put another chain with it."
2.0,I liked the feel of the material but they do not run true to size.
2.0,This belt looks like something out of a little girl's dress up box. It is definitely shiny but very cheap looking. I can't address durability because I won't wear it.
2.0,Material of dress is very thin and the white shirt does not come with the dress. Wasn't what I expected.
2.0,Definitely not for plus size... waste of money
2.0,"Hi!! I am XL  size women and i have odered XL size and the skirt fits like the penal skirt.So,if you need the skirt fits loose,you need odered two size up."
2.0,This was not a Steve Madden product as advertised
2.0,"The adjustable ear pieces are nice, but the printed design isn't how it seems in the photo. The mask is a weird peachy-orange, and it looks as though the photo the mask is based on was zoomed in on prior to printing."
2.0,"Really wanted my wife to like this band, but the color was washed out.  She used it as a work band during the holidays so she didn't ruin her good ones.  Good news it does not crack like some others she has."
2.0,I find it huge! My dad is not a small person but this piece looks huge on him. Not happy.
2.0,THEY WOULDN'T STAY ON MY EARS.
2.0,Getting kinda tired of ordering dresses that are so thin they are see through. The dress is light and comfortable however the material is so light that through two layers it is still see through. With no extra lighting but window lighting you can see the outline stitching of the pockets. I wanted to like this dress but I could go to target. Marshals or any decent store and find a better quality maxi dress that is cheaper than what I paid for this dress. I don't recommend this dress. There are snags coming off in several locations. If it was a 20 dollar dress then maybe I'd call it a swim cover up or dress for laying around thr house but I hate it when clothes are so see through you can see any outline or shape of my underwear and bra.
2.0,"Description says ""earnings"" but you will be getting 1 ear ring.  What a disappointment!  Will have to order a second one"
2.0,the fabric is weird material and it is too small.
2.0,"Necklace looked great upon receiving it, BUT the &#34;Virgo&#34; pendant literally snapped in half after only owning it about 2 months, and I did NOT even wear it daily.  I only wore it out a few times on the weekends, and so I only had the chance to wear it about 4 times before it broke in half.  I wasn't rough with it, as it was around my NECK. The chain was ok, and I had no problems with the chain.  Would have been a great necklace had it lasted more than 4 wears (1-2 months), as I thought it was really cute."
2.0,You can literally make this top with 2 scarves and buttons.  I bought this because of the color and the shear material.  I'll make my next one 👌.
2.0,Well very loose top but stuff is nice had to return because of the defect
2.0,I thought these would be a little larger. I've used them but I've definitely had better quality. I suggest going with a round profile over triangle. These move around which is annoying. They are probably great if you sew them in.
2.0,"I have bought several of the LEMI brand sunglasses and this was the first one I have not  liked.<br />These looked yellow in picture and yellow is my favorite color. These are gold, and the type of gold I refer to as gaudy gold."
2.0,"As you can see there are two watches. The first didn't work so they sent second and it doesn't work. Pros: Nice looking watch, gets attention, so sad they don't run."
2.0,"I ordered a L which is what I normally am. Normally wear a size 12 or 10 dress. I’m 5’6”, 42” bust, 32” waist, 42” hips. This did not fit at all! I couldn’t even pull it past my hips. The size chart did not help."
2.0,This product came with no instructions on how to wear it.  I've tried yo wrap it like the picture and it looks ridiculous.  Quality is just OK.
2.0,I wouldn't recommend. The material looks a far cry from the picture. Looks like a silk robe. Can't go anywhere in this.
2.0,"Very disappointed. The hats were made of very flimsy fabric so that the rims just flop down. The colors were not at all like the picture. The colors were sort of dusty, not clear, and the rims were dark gray. The hats arrived folded in quarters with hard creases that would not come out. I am sending them back."
2.0,"The picture makes the artwork look good but it's not Sharp colors bleed. It barely can squeeze onto my head, very uncomfortable. Luckily I have kids I can pass it onto that it should fit. Sales picture shows nice roomy fit with ample room for man bun. Not in my case."
2.0,"Cute, however broke after 4th wear."
2.0,the first time i got this the top was to small and the bottom fit and I ordered a Medium which i always am. I don't like how the top fit. Between the black spaces it squeezes all your back skin up and it puts your boobs more squished down rather than pushing them up. I ordered this product again in the Large which i never am and the bottom was to big and the top was still to small. Unless you have tiny boobs i wouldn't bother. i then lost 11 pounds and it seems to fit pretty well now so this is very tricky
2.0,Arrived Broken.
2.0,Does not fit very well or comfortably on said face.
2.0,"Cool looking, but the clasps were weak, kept opening and falling from my ear.  Eventually they both broke."
2.0,I purchased this and at first it was great. Fit and feel were spot on. After a few weeks I noticed skin break down around contact areas. I am a daily wearer and apparently the mosituer this retains was causing my skin to break down. I by no means have sensitive skin so this is truly an issue. If you keep it off your wrist for a couple hours a day should be no problem.
2.0,Clasp was loose; side clips would not close properly; wore once & stone fell out. I returned it.
2.0,Very cute but strap broke in the first month.
2.0,I WISHED this had fit.  I got my size by their charts but those charts are WAYYY off.  My 11 year old daughter couldn't squeeze into it. I thought it was really cute but as the material expands...it looks like you have spots of no color.
2.0,Returning because the the cut is not what I expected. I think i read somewhere that it was &#34;mom jeans&#34; almost and I have to agree. Although I do know that shopping online for clothes isn't always going to be 100% it was worth the try
2.0,Bracelet itself is very nice but so frail it has broken twice and each time I had to pay $15 to have it soldered
2.0,RUNS SMALL AND COLOR IS RUSTY NOT BROWN AS ADVERTISED
2.0,"Good concept but poor design. There is no way to secure these to the ring. I was hoping the raised edges would help hold in place, but it doesn't. If it shifts around, it can easily slip out of place and fall out. The one I tried was on just a couple of hours when it started to slip out. I felt it move so I didn't lose it, but it doesn't do any good in the box. Time to try a different style."
2.0,This doesn't sit properly.. keeps popping up.
2.0,Dont Buy This.. Kate Spade should not make technology... its a waste of money
2.0,"Nice top but fits waaaay too snug.  I bought another top the exact same size at the same time and it fit fine, a tiny bit big, but fit overall well. Theis 2X fit VERY snug and did not look like the picture at all.  Beware on sizing. I would almost go up 2 more sizes to get the same effect as in the photo"
2.0,"pretty, but runs way too small."
2.0,"They fit good, when they are off the zipper is a little hard to zip sometimes"
2.0,"The size is way bigger,3-6 months looks more like 12 months and the shoes are too wide,not quite wat I expected"
2.0,"Very cheap and HUGE, way too big"
2.0,"Lining too big for leather outside and sewn with wrinkles in it so thin leather looks wrinkled all over bag, especially front. Within 2 week you could see abandoned on the back where flap and purse bottom sewn together. Straps were pieces of leather sewn together, not a continuous strip of leather. Would have returned it but needed cross body bag immediately for trip. Looks like a cheap Walmart type bag."
2.0,It doesn’t look like the pictures and runs 2 sizes too small. It is very tight in the neck as well.
2.0,can't use it as intended to
2.0,Not true to size and too clingy
2.0,These AG Adriano Goldschmieds are more of a twill than a denim.  They run large (not slim fit at all) & the front pockets are more on the side hip area like you’d find on a pair of slacks.  Not a flat front style - they are fuller much like pleated pants.  Not what I’d hoped for.
2.0,I ordered a women’s 1XL and it fit more like a Medium. Very disappointed
2.0,I was looking forward to a fun summer dress that had lots of swing and movement.  What I got was a stiff dress that doesn't breathe.  The colors are nice and match the pictures that are advertised.  But the sleeves are tight (I'm wouldn't consider my arms to be wide) and the dress material doesn't breathe.  It doesn't give me that happy summer feeling that I was expecting. :(
2.0,The green shorts has a black spot on them that won't wash off.  Straight out of the package and my 8 year old saw it first.
2.0,The sweatshirt is made of strange material.  It's soft (sort of) on the inside but the outside is stiff and not soft at all.  Not really that comfortable to wear. Thinking it might be more useful as a layer to protect against light rain since the outside feels slick and plasticky.
2.0,I bought medium size but its like xxl to me. (( material looks like wat cat after shower.
2.0,Color is not as shown. It is more of a salmon color. Disappointed since I bought earrings etc to match.
2.0,Only lasted a month before parts started falling off the mask.
2.0,"Like another person mentioned, the band at the top of these if VERY compressive. However the effect it causes is very unflattering. I much prefer the material the actual leggings portion is made out of as it is super soft and comfortable. I also did not like what it did in the back. Since there is no booty seam I felt it gave me a unibutt type of look which is not what I like, personally. The good aspects are it did not give a camel toe and the material (other than the waist band) is very soft."
2.0,"Not smooth, it’s getting furry after washed"
2.0,"I purchased two pair. The zipper failed (broke lose) on the first pair out of the gate. The second pair has worked well. There are plenty of pockets and the shorts even breathe well and fit comfortably. I would rate them higher due to those factors, but the cheap zipper is a cause for concern and would prevent me from buying these again."
2.0,This hat is little bit large for me. The big concern is this hat was fold when shipping. Hope the folding mark will go away otherwise it will look ugly with the mark.
2.0,"I got this Kenneth Cole bag to replace the one I have almost identical I bought from their store .<br />Same price, but without the outside flap feature, instead had an outside zipper. When I received it<br />the quality of the material was not the same. It is not leather, smells plastic-y. As far as the design is practical<br />small and a lot of room inside. If leather it is not what you are looking for , this is a good bag."
2.0,Product came folded and could not be normal.
2.0,The color is not as pictured it is a neon orange and it just wasn't for me. I returned it almost a week ago and I have yet to be refunded. The top is beautifully designed and the bottoms are nice but the top part fit way too tight and made me have a muffin top not what I need.
2.0,"These were not what I expected them to be. I thought they would be big and bold! They were so thin and small, and one pair I don’t even know how you put it in your ear, not the look or style I thought they would be."
2.0,"Visually, this belt is nice. The reversible nature  is pretty handy. But if you need a belt that you'll wear every day, then this is not the belt for you. The buckle is not secured to the leather very well, and can be pulled right off with a moderate tug (like, say, cinching it just a bit too tight.)"
2.0,"Ok so ive had this for a year and I bought this for my son to use in 7th grade. When i unpackaged it I knew the metal rolling rack was not going to last very long. It's made of very lightweight aluminum or somthing similar and cheap feeling plastics. its all screwed together with short little screws. The wheels are ok and the little shelf the backpack sits on is a very flimsy piece of plastic that folds in on its self when the backpack sits on it.  The backpack itself is of ok material but the pulls on the zippers broke off about 6 months in and the seams of the backpack were giving out by the end of the school year.<br />There are better products out there for this price range, i wouldn't recommended or buy again."
2.0,"don't expect too much, its small and cheap, but looked ok in a haunted house display"
2.0,size guide said XL = US large. Not true. More like a medium.<br />A little tight for a US L size. And way too short for L
2.0,The material of these shorts is not what I expected and they run small.
2.0,They looked gaudy. I returned them.
2.0,I ordered a XXXL and it is more like an extra small. I can not wear it at all. I do like the print though.
2.0,"My item arrived quickly and in shiny new condition, however, the wallet was much thicker (fatter?) that it looks in the picture. I was looking for something slimmer."
2.0,"This would be a very nice dress... but... I found the neck to be so uncomfortable tight. It fits so close, feels like wearing a choker on me. I have broader shoulders but this needs alteration for me to wear ut again..... Weird because it's not a for fitted dress. Nice fabric. No stretch. Breathable, light"
2.0,Needed to be bigger
2.0,inseam length is very important to know<br />40 could be longer surprised there is no 42<br />otherwise a nice nice product
2.0,"Fit well, but that seam down the middle is very unfortunately located. Can't use for exercise because the seam is prominent, and in a sensitive location. If you catch my drift."
2.0,"I was really hoping for a supet soft jacket, but this one is tough. Reminds me of a brillo pad. It also has an odor I can't tolerate. The sizing is very small as well. The only positive thing I can say is the color is pretty. I am sending it back."
2.0,zippers are very  cheap!  would  not last very long. returned it. if you can replace zippers it would be a nice jacket.
2.0,I got and XL and its see through and too small! I suggest a darker color than beige and order a few sizes up.
2.0,"After wearing a couple pairs this week, I'll probably return the two packs I bought.  For the record, I'm a 6-1 guy with big thighs and was going for something I could wear under jeans for work and shorts for working out, that would give proper support and prevent chafing.  I usually buy Hanes, but find their fit to vary by color, even in the same pack of shorts.<br /><br />The good:<br />Colors and stitching are fine<br />Quality materials<br />Extra long, goes down almost to my knees<br />No ride up or roll up on the legs<br /><br />The bad:<br />TOO tight around the thighs(they basically wouldn't come up past just above the knee and showed below my shorts when I ran)<br />Too lose around the waist (with the thighs so tight, the waist would just get pulled down as the day went on)<br />Lines and fit not flattering(according to my wife anyway, who normally has no complaints)<br />Not enough support(maybe a product or tight legs and loose waist, but kinda feels like wearing regular boxers in terms of support)<br /><br />Potentially unrelated... After wearing a(new, freshly washed) pair all day, I developed a bit of an... itch... I showered and put on another new pair, but it continued through the night and the next day. The itch immediately subsided, though still lingered a bit, after I stopped wearing these.  It could be nothing but I also might be having a reaction to the materials.  I never has this issue with other neoprene compression shorts, so I'll probably be returning these shortly to be safe."
2.0,"I like the dress, but it's nothing like the picture.<br />Material is cheap and it's shorter than a picture. XL is not even close to L. But I can wear it at home. Not outside."
2.0,"This dress has no shape- it's very loose and just hangs.  It would be great for someone who is kind of square shaped and very thick in the waist- all that would be hidden.  For me, it became a sleep shirt."
2.0,"This is the second time I ordered this product from this seller. The first set of rings came in, sterling silver, good quality for the price. I lost one of them and liked it so much I decided to re-order. Big mistake. The second order arrived and the rings were made from a different type of metal. The small mid arrow ring snapped in half when I went to tighten it. Definitely not sterling silver but probably copper because my fingers will turn green. The second order appears to be a knock off from the first. I do not recommend purchasing this product. I have been wearing rings my entire life and know the difference between cheap and decent. These are cheap. The sizes also differ between the two orders I placed."
2.0,"The T-shirt I received is odd, there is something off in the fit and tayloring. The neck is cut wrong and is a bit larger than I like, the arms are just wrong, and the bottom of the T-shirt hangs oddly. I will wear this around the house but would not wear it going out of the house. Maybe its just the shirt I received?"
2.0,The polarizing came off when I used the enclosed cleaning cloth.
2.0,"The gloves seem to be OK but are almost impossible to put on with the tight, non-flexible cuff.<br />Definitely have to order a size larger and even then I question how easy it will be to put on."
2.0,I ordered these for my son who is very hard on shoes. He wears a size 3. I ordered a size 3. When they arrived the shoe looked much smaller than I expected.  They were much smaller than my son's other shoes. My daughter wears a size 2 so I measured next do hers. They were the same and fit her perfectly. She loves shoes so she claimed these.  She says they are comfortable and light. They are nice and neutral and basic. They would get a much higher rating if the size was correct. I don't know if I got a mis-marked pair or they just run a full size small.
2.0,The onesie is a strange material and the print already looks faded. Not very good quality.
2.0,This is for skinny women. Panties fit but not my chest.
2.0,"I ordered a cheap ring to wear to work, so I wasnt expecting much, but 4 stones have fallen out in 2 weeks. The ring is pretty and fit well, but I had hoped it would hold up a little longer. You get what you pay for."
2.0,Hurts my boy
2.0,"Should have paid attention to reviewers that were not happy. Pants are not as pictured. They are straight legged and not Capri, rather, they are to the ankle. Very disappointed."
2.0,These are really cheap looking and do not hold up at all.  I went for one run and they already have a tear in the under-seam.
2.0,Difficult to pit on. No directions.
2.0,This dress was so tight (I ordered my true size) I should have went up a notch. It was very pretty but it was so thin you can see every line/roll. Plus glitter was everywhere.
2.0,I had trouble getting sox to stretch around heel.  Also 90 years age didn't help
2.0,I normally wear an Large so I ordered a XL and it fits super tight.
2.0,The first day I wore it to work the stone came out.
2.0,They are cute but the posts bend too easily.  For 18.00 they should be sturdier.
2.0,Have a XL size.
2.0,I am not to happy with these. I spent 29.99 on them for them to drop 19.99 2 days later. . and no price change. these are for my 3yr old first day school Friday.  I am not a huge fan of them but my 3yr things they best thing in world.
2.0,Leather handle tore- and I do not overload my purse.<br />Very pretty and I received a lot of compliments on the bag. Disappointed when the handle tore
2.0,Ordered in grey large fit well. 5’6 140 lbs. Black runs small. Tight through arms
2.0,"The pocket zipper did not open well, but finally did.  Now the main zipper bent and cannot use it any more.  Poor quality made, and I should have returned it when the pocket zipper had issues.  Now I cannot return it.  Nice jacket, but frustrating it didn't even last a season!"
2.0,"No queda bien encajado la ""peluca"" se cae, es difícil usarlo, prácticamente debes sujetarlo todo el tiempo.<br />Las calzas o pantalones del traje se traslucen son muy delgadas."
2.0,Size matters.  OMG this is so small!  Pay attention to size. This surely is for a child
2.0,The hat is definitely navy blue and not black as it appears in the product pictures. The logo quality isn't as good as in the product photos and its not as large. I think it's safe to say the hat people receive is a completely different hat as the one pictured in the description. That being said the hat you actually do receive isn't half bad for the price if you're okay with the color. Fits my big head and still looks like a nice Subaru hat.
2.0,"The graphite color is actually blue. It looks nothing like the photo, on any of my computer/mobile screens. Although there is a grayish tint to the color, it's so obviously blue that I don't think most people would reasonably choose the word ""graphite"" to describe it.<br /><br />I can't comment on the other features of the belt, because I didn't bother taking it out of it's plastic bag. As soon as I saw the color, I immediately started a return with Amazon. I may re-order in black, but don't want to risk trying another color after this experience."
2.0,"I would have return this if I had more time, just too big for me however the stud do look great!"
2.0,These are spray painted wire ties on a cheap gold headband. Flowers are foam and more orange than red. I took the flowers off and DIYed my own from a craft store. Go to the dollar store and save your $
2.0,"Sent back, to short."
2.0,"Boobs part is just weird, like lemon shaped."
2.0,They were way too big for my great nephew and he is 6 months. But they are cute
2.0,the material looks cheap. will either be returning or it giving it to friends for Christmas.
2.0,Fit not right
2.0,Not the greatest quality! Pretty light duty
2.0,Looks so stupid on your face . They sewed it up the front it's horrible and huge if it fit it would be cute but talking with it is awful to
2.0,"The dress looks good from the front and I have no problem with the top, but the bottoms look very cheap and do not hug the body like shown in the photo if you are on the skinnier side."
2.0,"The Mask is very Good my son love it , but the face covering is bad you can’t see well"
2.0,The base is small so they constantly pop out.. no good
2.0,The elastic is too weak.
2.0,The material wears out quickly. Disappointed in the quality
2.0,"Soft & comfortable; perfect length for 5’1” or shorter. Unfortunately when it came out of dryer, fabric & side seams were skewed off to one side. Will return if I can find the clear plastic bag. The long version was perfect but needs hemmed. Worn a lot anyway."
2.0,"Non adjustable and quite large nose pads, lots of reflections."
2.0,Got red for the holidays BUT after 1st wash the zipper got stuck & even my husband couldn't budge it.  Just slip it over my head for now.
2.0,"Bought this for one reason.  I needed a truly silent alarm that wouldn't wake up my wife. She's a light sleeper and anything that buzzes or vibrates wakes her up.  The unit worked well enough when I was testing it out but not as an alarm.  Even when wearing it relatively tight, and putting it on a high charge, it did not successfully or reliably wake me up in the morning. I think the issue may have been that it doesn't work well on dry skin.  Regardless, after a few weeks, it stopped working altogether.  It would register as working on the app but there was no electrical shock. Ended up just throwing it away."
2.0,Not what I expected. Not warm at all. Don't have enough elastic to always stay up.
2.0,Fake dress buyer beware
2.0,I am very annoyed that the clasps on the straps were not already on.  I had to assemble them myself.
2.0,"WHOA! This dress looks and feels like a pirate costume! It is not flowing and folding on itself like the picture, it is four triangles hanging. Do not buy this unless you need a Halloween costume! I gave 2 stars because it did fit well."
2.0,"Shirt fits as expected (tight and uber cropped). However it is SO SHINY! It looks like a bathing suit from the Limited Too. Will wear it to the beach with bikini bottoms, but it's not useful for other pokéventures."
2.0,"We’ve had these for only four months and holes all over. We take good care of our clothes, no dryer. I have four other pajamas from this company and they’ve held up well on my kids, but these ones are falling apart, the material is very thin, does feel the same as their other pajamas. This shouldn’t be happening with higher end clothing. I’m giving two stars because if they weren't falling apart, they’d be adorable."
2.0,My daughter dislikes the fit.  It is too large.  She dislikes the style and length.  She dislikes the print. too busy.  I guess its not for her
2.0,"Shirt is cool, comfy, and fits great. However, the stitching at the bottom of the shirt has already come undone. That means that the stitching at the bottom of the shirt came apart and now the shirt looks weird."
2.0,Depending on what style you are going for... it was way to large and long. It came past my knees and looked like a potato sack on. Material was soft and quality of stitching were good.
2.0,"Fabric is super cute, colors are great but I think it's made for a taller person, I'm a 36/38C and it's too big in the chest, I may have to get it altered to fit. I'm 5'6"" 122lbs. It just doesn't lay right on top, the rest is great."
2.0,My daughter has worn then to school for 2 weeks and they’re falling apart. They also run extremely small. Had to send get 2 sizes up from her regular size.
2.0,The battery died and I see *no* way to open it to replace it nor do I see a place to wind it up
2.0,This looked like it would be a great product but unfortunately it came with defects. I didn't notice them at first until my daughter's bottom was in full display at the beach thanks to defective seams. They didn't serge the seems together completely in two areas.
2.0,"I see halos around lights at night when I'm driving, so I got these polarized glasses to help with that. The yellow color is pretty extreme, but they do help with the halos a little bit.<br /><br />The biggest issue is the quality. They feel like they came from a dollar store. They are super stiff and squeak when you open and close them. They also smudge ridiculously easily and are very hard to clean, because the material of the lens is very cheap plastic.<br /><br />Definitely not worth the money."
2.0,"i liked the neckline but that was about it for this product. The sleeves were way to short on me and not nearly as billowy as they were on the model. The fabric was very thin and felt weird on my skin. The dress did not cinch at all around the waist it came with a belt that you have to cinch yourself making it look ill-fitting. The bag my product came in was also damaged, lots of holes, probably from the very extensive shipping time. Overall would go back in time and not order this at all if I could as I don’t think i’ll be wearing it, which is sad because it looks great on the girl in the picture :("
2.0,Very hard to get the ball on.  Wish they screwed on the front
2.0,Colors/patterns are really ugly but they do their job. I wouldnt buy again though.
2.0,"the clips not long enough, it keep falling off"
2.0,"Super cute, but these didn't last at all. The elastic broke in a month and the colors and sparkle have scratched off. My daughter isn't all that rough on shoes either."
2.0,It would be a better product with a plastic zipper. The fabric did was well. I dried it only for 10 minutes on low and hung it up.
2.0,"Skull design is terrible, wraps around the whole thing"
2.0,I returned this pant. It’s a lint magnet material
2.0,"This shirt is nothing like the picture on the model. It is not at all fitted. Just straight like a man’s shirt. The pictures of the shirt by itself are accurate. It is 100% nylon, and there is no indication that there is any UV protection. It is very comfortable to wear, but a bit crinkly and doesn’t seem to breathe."
2.0,I really liked this dress. Then i washed it and it became a shirt... ho hum
2.0,"Made of cheap material, it illicited some allergy on my wife. It was not that good and she didn't realy care much about it anyway."
2.0,Missing decorative stud on one side of the frames. Otherwise pretty much what you'd expect out of a $10 pair of sunglasses. All plastic frames for those wondering.
2.0,Didn't really like it. Looks better on amazon than it does in person.
2.0,I purchased this set of earrings for my daughter.  We received them in a timely manner and she was happy with them except for one piece in the set.  The clasp didn't close correctly allowing the hoop to fall out of her ear very easily.  So we asked to have them replaced and we are in the middle of this now.  The second set came again timely but she is having the same issue with the same earring in the group.  So not sure if we should try again or just return the whole set and move on at the moment.
2.0,"It would be a overall decent jacket for the price, but the stitching is of very poor quality and dont anticipate this jacket to last very long at all."
2.0,"The colors of this top are so great, I wanted to love it, but the fit is terrible.  I am a 32DD, 5ft 6in, 130 lbs, and ordered both the medium and the large.  The medium fit in the band but was way too small in the cups that I was spilling out of it.  The large fit in the cups but was way too big in the band, even with the tightest loop.  I returned both, which was a shame because the bottoms that match this top are amazing.  I kept the bottoms and purchased a different top to wear with them."
2.0,"yea, not really what I expected. Don't get me wrong if u got curves I'm sure this will make ur booty pop n all but like I said before I'm a little shorty weighing a beautiful 98 lbs n 5 ft n thas hella small. It made me look like I was wearing a long old man's night gown."
2.0,If you want your boobs to keep falling out....then buy this bras! If you want your boobs to still in place....then look somewhere else! I ordered the 32DD (natural boobs) for some reason it seems these bras should be for B cups only! Not sure!
2.0,[[VIDEOID:5d7e02518b409d8cfe5c6d79e654566c]] Loved this shirt. I’ve only worn it twice. When I pulled it out of my dryer the print was completely stuck together and I carefully pulled<br />It apart but I couldn’t salvage the design. I’m so bummed.
2.0,"I ordered it as a gift for mothers day.the first one was wound and ordered again, but the owl ship came away and there was a wound, I fixed it and used"
2.0,It was too small for my head in that the neck part didn't even come to the bottom of my neck. Plus it's see-through. My face and hair were visible through it.<br /><br />The only good thing is that it's breathable. Not what i was looking for though.
2.0,"The bracelets are made for tiny wrists. Although very cute, I can't use them."
2.0,"Weird size (I bought 2 different sizes and had the same problems with both). Too big in some areas, and to small in others. Straps will have to be cut and re-sewn to make them the same length. Fine for a little 10 minute dance party, but the girls couldn’t wait to take them off☹️"
2.0,My boyfriend told me he wanted this royal blue polo for his birthday so i ordered it for him.  When i received it in the mail i was very disappointed because instead of solid blue it was blue and white striped.  My boyfriend hates stripes and doesn't like to wear clothes with stripes on them.  The picture showed a solid blue and i'm very upset about it since it's too late to order another one and get it here on time.
2.0,Not exactly great quality.  The back of one earring fell off and my earring fell out before I even made it to work.
2.0,"These glasses are cute, but the left hinge is already loose and wobbly.  they were delivered on June 15, 2023, and the deadline for returning closed two days ago.  I guess I'm stuck with broken sunglasses. I do not recommend these sunglasses."
2.0,Lid seals keep coming off causing leak otherwise great thermos like
2.0,"weird sizing, short jacket, wide shoulders. I'm 5'11 and 160lbs, with a 40&#34; chest - went with a medium but since i'm a slimmer build the shoulders sagged. this is a polyester-ish material so it doesn't keep its shape well"
2.0,"Cheaply made, Not Durable"
2.0,Cute but way too small we didn’t wear them!!
2.0,"The hat is super small, and the lining is &#34;Polyester,&#34; not &#34;Satin!&#34;"
2.0,This looked so good on model. In order for it to look good you'd have to weigh 98 lbs. I ordered size up and it was still too small
2.0,Bought for my grands with glasses and they are a great concept and really cute for little ones with eye glasses or even sunglasses but 2 broke right away.  I mean you do get several so you can just move on to the next one if one breaks but I have them to different kids so once it broke they just didn't have another
2.0,Color got dull after three days and doesn't look good anymore. I guess you get what you pay for. Wouldn't buy again.
2.0,I would not buy these again. They turned after the first wear
2.0,They were very cheap and they didn’t fit anyone. Everyone in my office tried them on. All different shapes and sizes and no one liked the way they fit!  Yuck!
2.0,"Amazing look to the necklace, bought for Halloween, perfect for my outfit, but it looks like it's for a child. The smallest hook is about as big and my ankle. The biggest is about 3 inches smaller than my average neck. Had to buy an extension. Also had a bunch of random loose strings hanging, just poorly made. But for $5, I will make it work. Wouldn't wear it on an ordinary day...."
2.0,"About 2 sizes too small, I am usually a 2XL or XL, So I ordered a 2XLA and it was WAY too small"
2.0,didnt love the colar in person
2.0,You can't fully remove the insert unless you remove stitching and then you won't be able to put it back and that's misleading if you don't read every word of the fine print.
2.0,I did not like the fact that the dress was to small it definitely was sized incorrectly.
2.0,Very pretty colors! Broke the 3rd day.
2.0,"The shirt was pretty good quality, very nice. however, the size was too small. I wanted to simply exchange what I got for a larger size, but nope. No returns or exchanges, even though I thought the quality was good and liked the styles a lot, I have to pass on ordering from this company again because I can not trust the size and have no ability to exchange. What a waste to buy a shirt that can't be worn."
2.0,"These were beautiful and looked amazing on! Unfortunately the turquoise piece fell off within days of one, I figured that was a fluke. However shortly the others followed. I now have 4 earrings with no turquoise on them 😞."
2.0,"This is more like a summer tomato red, not Christmas red at all.  Cheap looking, thin material with what looks like an iron on decal."
2.0,Liked the glasses but the screw kept falling out! Can't wear them anymore
2.0,"Link broke 5 weeks after normal wear. I work in an office setting, too. Hope the company will work on getting me a new one because my return window closed 8 days ago."
2.0,The chain that is attached to post not very sturdy or strong not long enough to claspthe post when removing from ear and already broken wore 2 times
2.0,Not what I was expecting at all  have a very cheep feel to them and very thin
2.0,"Was disappointed by the size, the description was not clear enough, but product was  very good quality."
2.0,Doesn’t wash up nicely. Every pill and fuzz sticks to it.
2.0,Had to order 2 sizes up for proper fit. Otherwise the fabric is pretty lightweight and is good for spring. I pulled a ton of loose string off it so hope it stays together after a first wash. I probably would not buy again- cheaply made
2.0,ITs pretty cheap... and not even CLOSE to the 50+ L it claims to be. I have a 40L bag that dwarfs this tiny bag.<br /><br />I can’t complain too much because it is one of the cheapest on the market.... but I expected at least HONEST advertising for it.
2.0,Shorts are great! Super cute outfit on. Shirt shrinks even when washed on cold and low dry. Shrunk about a size smaller. Disappointed. This was a gift.
2.0,Skirt fits weird
2.0,Broke second time using.
2.0,"Love it except for length, it’s more of a waist length than shown in the picture."
2.0,Went in easy but with 24 hours my nose was infected.  I'm wondering if it's because it was very loose and moved around a lot. Honestly I can't figure it out. I purchased a stud from the same company and had no issues.
2.0,Sad they broke
2.0,"I ordered xxl. I get it; I am large. But the sizing was so off that it was only a little large on my niece who happens to be a size 7. I think one quick time in the dryer and it would fit her fine!! Lovely, lovely shirt, but should be marketed to tiny, tiny women...The sizing is way off. I am reviewing with full disclosure of having been sent this item at a reduced price for my opinions...Again, it's beautiful, but you need to go a couple of sizes larger. For sizes zero to say, eight, it's a winner!"
2.0,"I’m not a big person. I have fairly small wrists. This didn’t fit. I was able to wriggle my wrist into it, but the clasp would close over the bone, leaving a good 1/3 of my wrist clamped in the clasp. It might fit very, VERY fine-boned women or small children, but definitely not for the average adult."
2.0,A little better than the stainless steel. But can't be a higher grade surgical steel. Still makes my sensitive skin itch.
2.0,"We loved them at first, but after 2 months of wear they are falling apart at the front seams. NOT AT ALL what I expect from Stride Rite. All other products have been great!"
2.0,"you get what you paid for, cheap material, even the colors look cheap, i threw it out. it was cheap so i got what i paid for"
2.0,Runs small. Material quality very poor.
2.0,Material was great for the price. Arms are weirdly stitched however. You would expect this type of ruching on a 3/4 length sleeve but it goes all the way down to your wrist so the ruching just makes it look like the sleeves are too long. Not a good look for the office.
2.0,Colors are as pictured. Ordered a medium fit more like a large.
2.0,"We wanted masks that were purple... 100% purple ... and the photo at Amazon certainly looks that way.  We wanted that because they are part of a uniform where they need to be that way.  But there is a white strip at the top and bottom, and the ear loops are white.  They are not 100% purple.  Not as advertised.  We will use them, but not for the intended purpose."
2.0,"Looks cute from a distance, but they are very see-through and the threads are coming out a lot on the bottom."
2.0,"Full disclosure, I washed and dried this garment before photographing.  It shrank substantially. The XL reduces to a medium at least. The material is soft, but really thin.  You can easily see light pass through it.  Order at least 3 sizes larger than you normally wear, maybe 4 sizes up."
2.0,It is definitely not a compression underwear. It does not help shaping your body it is just tight tank top
2.0,Please.. don't waste your money. Cheap looking all the way.
2.0,They didn't fit my head so I gave them to my wife. She loves them.
2.0,Lol.  Too and way too wide across.  Really didn't care for the fabric either.  Already returned them.
2.0,It's cute but doesn't fit. I ordered a large when it said fits true to size but when I opened the box it was clearly not my size.
2.0,"Flimsy, arrived with one of the chains already broken. This is my lesson to invest in quality and not buy cheapo, toss -away jewelry  : |"
2.0,"Definitely an inexpensive set, but hey 4.99. You get what you pay for so even if I wear these twice it's paid for itself!"
2.0,"This dress fits well and my daughter loves how the skirt is flowy and spins.  Unfortunately, the material is not cotton.  It feels like really cheap pajamas.  So, she uses it as a nightgown."
2.0,"This tarnishes very quickly,a couple of days"
2.0,"Disappointed, the dragonfly fell off after only wearing it for two weeks...."
2.0,"The pockets and ears were on backwards, and it doesn't stay closed very well.<br /><br />It's a nice material, and very warm, though, which is the only reason I gave it two stars."
2.0,"While these are nice glasses, they do not fit over my spectacles."
2.0,Fits amazingly! But that doesn't matter since one of the ear straps broke off after one month!
2.0,"I bought these pants in February, and It's April. Putting them on today, the pants ripped at the top of the zipper picket to waistband. I don't even wear them that much, and I have a regular athletic build."
2.0,If you want a beach cover up this will work well. If you want to wear as a dress....you will be showing the world your privates.
2.0,"I usually order a large because I have a 42"" waist and with stretchy material, this works well. But these pants were way too small.  Had to return them."
2.0,Little confusing to set the time and date. Took me about an hour to figure out as directions are not clear. Looks good though.
2.0,I returned this product because the stitching on the sleeves did not match the sweater.
2.0,"I absolutely love this dress but it’s unwearable as the straps are like child size. It pulls it halfway into my armpit so it’s not comfortable whatsoever. The fabric is awesome and the style would look great if it wasn’t for the straps. I would keep it and have the straps altered if they were too long but too small is an issue. Make them adjustable and I will purchase again! For reference I am 5’2 120lbs, 32b/c and usually wear a small/xsmall"
2.0,"didn't try any of the other positions, as i bought this for squats.  Barely any resistance at all."
2.0,"Very very thin. It’s described as a suede material and it’s really not. Lots of loose threads and very cheap zipper, hard to zip. I’m 5’4” and 105-110 pounds and it fit well."
2.0,The sizes run small and the tie in the middle is too bulky. So you you want to wear with a bodycon it will show.
2.0,Just gave it to my granddaughter for her birthday when she put it in the ball would  not tighten kept on pulling out
2.0,"Very comfortable but in the first week, two of the straps broke which really stank."
2.0,Despite checking the size chart this item was huge on me. I had to return.
2.0,"I first loved these, then was so sad to discover they are tarnishing right away. They are sterling silver yet they turned bad and too late to return."
2.0,"I am not thrilled about this item. It looks exactly what you would expect, but it looks a bit too silly. I think it would be great for little girls."
2.0,"Although the jacket looks nice, the sleeves aren’t long enough. There’s too much fuzz that comes off and shakes out of this jacket and gets all over your clothes."
2.0,CHEAP LOOKING AND TOO SMALL SIZE WAY UP
2.0,"Received package with black mold covering the box, inside the box, and partially in the money clip."
2.0,Size runs small. Be careful to check sizing chart when buying.
2.0,"I loved this, but after the 1st wash(on delicate cycle) it started coming apart at the seems. It's not going to deter me from ordering more items form Mordernmiss though. I have purchased several & this was my first disappointment."
2.0,Not what I expected. Can fit a doll.
2.0,"They came with an awful smell.... I have washed them 3 times and they still smell... I thought let me try and wear them for a little bit ( put perfume on them as well) and see if that helps... NOPE!!!!! Idk what to do!!! The pants are especially bad!!!!! I thought it might b the dye.... I put color grabber, beads with gain detergent & fabric softener( I was trying the strongest smell I thought there was) NO Bueno!!! Help , if anyone has any ideas!!"
2.0,"I was so looking forward to getting one of these, they came so nice n soft , but was very confusing to open to add keys and attach to purse. It had no instructions , so sadly it broke rather quickly and I never got to use it:( Sorry hate giving poor reviews , but always wish to be truthful!"
2.0,cute but the fabric is super plasticy and theres no zipper so if you have a large chest and small waist it will be really hard to get on
2.0,The shirt is European cut which is too small in the arms and chest.
2.0,"its' cute.  made like a bathing suit top with the hook in the back.  however, does not come anywhere close to covering or holding me in.  im a 36dd so i knew that was possible, but i ordered the xl based on what others said and not only do i pour out the top, but i fall out the bottom even after removing the pads."
2.0,"The glasses are really cool, and but I’m bummed they came in missing a plastic piece that sits on your nose (I’m not sure what it’s actually called). I checked the packaging, the box it came in, everything and couldn’t find it. So it didn’t fall off in shipping, it just didn’t come with one."
2.0,"I have other Tallis, the Tzitzits are not the greatest. I was getting this for my dad, I will get a wool one instead."
2.0,"I didn’t care for the fit of this dress, and the material was thin."
2.0,They are pretty but too heavy.
2.0,Should have ordered a XL
2.0,"It looks good, but the material is rough even after washing. I'm not sure what collar has in it, but it's hard and has no give and is super rigid. If I didn't know better, I'd think it has Plastic in between the fabric to give the collar a crisp look?"
2.0,"These masks will NOT work to protect agains covid-19. While they are cute, comfortable, and lightweight, you can easily blow out a candle while wearing the mask which is an indication that they do not work to stop the spread of the virus."
2.0,"Assembly instructions not very clear, just pictures no writing. Don't swing back too far, the whole thing will tip. I would not recommend this product."
2.0,"I ordered this for my daith piercing because it is so cute, but when I tried to put it in, the bar wasn't long enough and I wasn't able to click it closed. I figured it was my fault at first and assumed since my type of piercing isn't what this jewelry is intended for, so it was no problem. Then I cleaned it and gave it to a friend who has her septum pierced and she said the same thing! So the bar on this particular piece of jewelry is too short and is not comfortable to wear in any piercing."
2.0,Nice quality but defiantly no all over coverage!
2.0,"I ordered this set for the V ring, I got all the rings but the one I wanted. All the rings I got were broken, I'm very disappointed, I asked for a refund or replacement from the seller but they haven't contacted me yet, the rings are cute.. I mean they would be if they weren't broken. On the bright side I got them 2 weeks early!"
2.0,Cheap. Run way too big. Not comfortable and your feet slide around because the strap becomes stretched out . Cute visually but can't even walk around the house in these things.
2.0,"I've had Calabria before, a few years ago.  I feel like the quality has gone down, the glasses don't sit square on my nose and I find myself always adjusting them so my field of vision stays clear.  All I all, I have had cheaper reading glasses nicer than these.  What they do have going for them is that they are nice looking than most cheap internet reading glasses."
2.0,Bad material... and too big.
2.0,"Cute but way to small. I went off the comments and ordered my normal size. Way to tight. Cute print but dont think it would last long. Returning, maybe getting a bigger size."
2.0,I got this for my daughters birthday. She loves it but it broke after a week. Sad as she loves it.
2.0,"My daughter received this shirt from her amazon graduation wish list as a grad gift.  The slip in the box said Indiana University, but the shirt was actually University of Utah. No idea how to exchange it."
2.0,Ordered last minute for my 10yr old daughter school play. Sized up according to the size chart but tutu was still 2 sizes too small.
2.0,5’3 240 pounds ordered XL these look like mediums. Very soft material and longer length which I wanted. Just wish they were true to size.
2.0,Poor quality. Returned promptly. Looks very cheap.
2.0,I ordered an XL and the shirt is still way too small and too short. I'll probably give it away.
2.0,"DOES NOT RELEASE THAT EASY ,"
2.0,"The material is a bit scratchy, right at chest but loose at waist. Overall I’d say it’s below average quality for a tank."
2.0,The items have a smell to it.
2.0,"I ordered these pants in gray (true to the photo on my screen) and a size Large - I'm either an 8 or a 6 depending on the pant, but it's because of my hips/thighs, not my waist. According to the size chart, I figured a large would fit over my legs and wasn't worried about the waist. The pants are pretty thin and are supposed to be a corduroy pant, which they kind of are...the outside feels like it is, but the inside is a polyester lining. The waist has zero elastic and the material does not stretch at all. I was lucky to button the waist and can fit in the pants, but only if I stood all day and didn't try to sit! The pant legs actually fit great and look like the photo. I like the loose fit and think these would be great for spring/summer, but based on the poor material and fit, I wouldn't be able to wear them."
2.0,Comfortable and real but they gave me the wrong color which is more then disappointing
2.0,I bought an XS for my 5 year old daughter who typically wears a 4/5 or XS - This fits more like a kids medium. It's good quality but it's so large it's difficult for my daughter to wear : /
2.0,"Hair was not full, that was the only downfall"
2.0,"Chain came tangled and it already snapped before even using it!  While the cage is nice, they need to make a chain that is stronger. Better quality."
2.0,"It's thin so you have to wear something underneath. Not the fit I was hoping for, but I shouldn't have expected much for $7.00."
2.0,Let me start out by saying I love this bag. Its big and the color is perfect and sophisticated. Unfortunately when they decided to unstuff the stuffing from the bag or whatever they did in shipping they smashed the front of the STRUCTURED BAG and created wrinkles that cannot be corrected. Super disappointed. I am returning this bag and going to order it again in hopes it will be shipped and delivered in a better state.
2.0,"Very thin material and very see through. It was very comfortable, but not so much fun or convenient that I have to wear a camisole and slip under as well"
2.0,"Bought this dress because of all the great reviews. I however, was very disappointed. The dress is very see through. I also felt the slip lining was very cheap  I sent it back, for the price there are better quality dresses."
2.0,Was much shorter then expected. Has stitching across the boob area.
2.0,Size small was a bit tight for the top. The quality of the fabric is cheap
2.0,I thought being 14k gold that I would not be allergic but I was. Couldn't wear them at all
2.0,I bought this for a Christmas party thinking a hooded flannel would be nice and warm. This has to be the thinnest material ever used for a flannel. Now off to try and find a warm shirt for under it. Thankful I got a larger size so I can do that. It is way bigger than I need and hangs down past my behind. It is cute but seems cheaply made for the cost.
2.0,They were not as expected.  But they do make a nice gift.
2.0,Very pretty. Anklets already broke after wearing twice.
2.0,"I wish that these socks had higher tops. Also because they have some wool (30% I believe), I had hoped they would be warmer."
2.0,first time I used them one of the metal rods that hold the ear muff in place came loose.
2.0,Get what you pay for. Quality is very cheap and does not look as on model.
2.0,"I ordered 3 jumpsuits from here. The floral, the pink and mint. I received the floral one first and it’s perfect in sizing, and super cute. I then ordered the pink and mint. These 2 are both short at the legs and too long on the top so her little toddler nipples show when wearing- not a good look."
2.0,I would never buy this luggage again.  Did not last two trips. I used it for a trip to Ireland and one handle ripped completely off.  Took on another trip trying to get my money's worth out of it and the other handle ripped off.  Left with luggage with no handles.  Had to stop my trip and purchase tie wraps and tape to make it home.  Now it's going in the trash.  I don't think I need say more.  So disappointed.
2.0,It was for my granddaughter and she liked it very much.
2.0,Very cheaply made. Wore it the same day i recieved it and it broke the same day. The prongs that held the stone in were all different sizes and the stone was loose.
2.0,"So, I had high hopes, but this turned me into a shapeless, black blob of cheap material. The shorts part were WAY TOO BIG. They were longer than I expected, nearly to my knees, and too roomy everywhere else. The elastic waist was too big, and all that material just made me look like a oompa balloon. So, now you're thinking...maybe I should just size down? Well, the top part was actually a little tight! Once it was on, it was ok on the top, but it was tight getting into around the shoulders, even with the one button undone. So, if I ordered a size down, it would have been too small on top, and honestly, I think the bottoms would have still been too big! For reference, I bought the XL and I'm 5'6"", 160lbs with 34G bust and an ""ample but not obnoxious"" booty, which is why I ordered an XL, because usually things can run tight across the hips. If you wrap yourself in a black garbage bag from shoulders to knee, that's pretty much what I looked like. This might work for some, but not for me."
2.0,rigid material
2.0,Lenses too small for frames… they “rattle” in the frames and I’m afraid they will pop out. Do not recommend.
2.0,"Pros: cute, very soft, quality seems good for the price<br /><br />Cons: THESE ARE NOT SEAMLESS. The seam across the toe does feel like seamless HOWEVER the ends of the seams DO have that little bunched up piece of fabric. If you are like me and can’t stand toe seams I would find something else. Pretty bummed. I will be returning them."
2.0,I usually wear a large which I purchased but this outfit purchased in a large is way too big.
2.0,These are cheap 99 cent earrings that you can get from a beauty supply store. Save yourself some money
2.0,"Cute pattern but material is very thin. The top seems about 4 inches long. I’m 5’9 and 155lbs, a large was too little. My torso is too long for this outfit because the bottoms rode up. I’m sad because it is so cute in the pictures"
2.0,"I loved this band, the colors were so bright and I got a ton of complements-It’s the second one I ordered. Turns out the link that connects band to watch is pretty weak. Both of them broke. I would take off at night for charging and loosen the strap so as not to put too much strain on the plastic part, but it still broke after only a few months, both times. This part of the band is not made well unfortunately. Otherwise, it’s super comfy and I liked how adjustable it was as I have very small wrists"
2.0,Material was not what I wanted
2.0,Looks good in the picture but not so much when you get it.
2.0,"Like the pants so much, but the zipper is really cheap and broke after only wearing twice!"
2.0,"You get what you pay for, and good bike shorts run almost twice this price.  I guess for beginner riders or those who always ride less than an hour these might be useful.  The padding is thin and it's not the kind of material I'm sued to for the chamois.  It's a synthetic knit cover over some sort of rubbery padding.  The only useful thickness is on the area on the butt where you would hit if you sit up fully as in a town bike.  If you ride leaning forward, it's almost no padding at all and if you tend to rub raw on the front of the genital area, the chamois does not even extend that far, so you're out of luck there.  The material in general is very light and doesn't wick well.  Not wicking well means among other things that you are going to have more chaffing.  It also looks really thin on the skin and a little glossy, so it's going to be very unforgiving to any imperfection, fold, bulge, etc.  I wish I had returned these promptly and used that money on real bike shorts."
2.0,Shirt is nice cotton material fits nice on shoulders and chest. I expected the shirt to be a bit longer. I order XL I'm 5'7 and shirt hits right at my hips. It will expose your tummy if you raise your arms. Cute shirt but definitely could be longer.
2.0,the material is very light weight which is great for Cali weather . the blue and white dress is very pretty.  after unpacking this costume  i realized  the back of the dark blue dress was ripped........has a hole the size of a thumb and unraveling from that point.
2.0,The remote only works on one sneaker :(
2.0,Lightweight and easy to use but the handle on the midsize broke after one use<br /><br />Update:  customer service was extremely prompt addressing our issue and has offered a partial refund. Very positive experience!
2.0,There was  no size requirement for item and they we're very tight
2.0,Kinda weird length and curve. Not my favorite but still cute.
2.0,"I ordered 2 of the. White and purple.<br />White - beautiful, great fabric, dress looks really nice (wrinkled)<br />Purple cheap material, badly made, nothing like the white one. Even the brands are different.. not sure if its by color or basically whatever they have but purple is going back."
2.0,Holy camel toe!!  I bought these expecting a gym shark dupe and was disappointed!  They did not come up as high as I would have liked and they rode up in the front.
2.0,Loved the look and feel of this watch. Runs fast about 5 minutes a day. Emailed company so the could tell me if it could be calibrated. They never responded.
2.0,Did not provide enough protection.  Very THIN!Not
2.0,"good rayban copy, but very poorly made, low quality plastic that breaks very easily compared to $100 sunglasses."
2.0,"This is a very odd piece of clothing. The stripes and material push it into maintenance worker or prison jumpsuit territory. The fit is ok, although the crotch is a little long and the waist ties are too short in length to be useful. Spend more money and get something better."
2.0,"I bought this purse a year ago and loved it.  Bought it again to replace my old one and was seriously disappointed.  The mirror was thinner and broke the first time I put anything inside the bag.  The interior fabric was also much stiffer and thicker, making it hard to fit much of anything inside.  Very sad."
2.0,"It is nice and cozy but it is threading into pieces, even before I gave it the first wash. I don't think it will last me more than 6 months."
2.0,Logo was painted on
2.0,The edges around the ring on both sides are too sharp to wear comfortably. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Put in my daughters ears broke within two days, and she does not play with her earrings either."
2.0,"The material is too thin, so you have to wear white clothes underneath. Also, there was not a built-in bra, which I thought it would based on the picture. I do enjoy the design other than the v-neck back. Otherwise, I am happy with the product."
2.0,Color don’t look like posting
2.0,For the most part this ring is as described and almost a year later is still in ok condition but all of the matte finish has come off and now it is super shiny. Not super happy with it but what can you expect for $30
2.0,I bought these for my uncle who wears a size 13.  They were too small.  He was not able to use them.
2.0,"It's very pretty, but my long hair gets caught near the clasp every time."
2.0,Not true to size.  Too small.
2.0,"Feels cheap and odd style, does look as pictured"
2.0,"This dress is very unflattering on a girl with hood. The sequins catches the light and makes you look much wider than you are. The waist is at the wrong place. The waist is way to high, above the belly button so it makes you look short torsoed. The top fit nice but the it is cut in away that's looks hideous."
2.0,I expected this to be costume I could wear to my school and teach as Olaf. There is no way to see out of the hood. The carrot nose is very long and hangs. I do not have time to find another costume or I would return this one.
2.0,Not soft not very stretchy
2.0,"The colors seem more balanced in the photo. If real-life, colors are far more contrasting versus smooth and flattering. Disappointed a bit, actually. Spent a VERY long time searching for the coloring and pattern advertised. Had I saw this in-person at the store, I likely would have bypassed it. Certainly wouldn’t have paid $20+ for it."
2.0,Not enough room for the bust
2.0,"These are the cutest, but the bow fell off the first time we wore them."
2.0,Very small and no stretch at all.  It definitely needs larger sizes.  Appears to be very high quality though.
2.0,"this shirt runs extremely small, I got a 2xl and it was more around a medium. I like the screen print just wish I could've worn the shirt. this is obviously a common problem as other reviewers have mentioned so the company should take a look at what they're calling 2xl, xl, etc....."
2.0,"Looks cool, but easily breaks"
2.0,The photo shows a long skirt and I received a short skirt. Not what I thought i was paying for.
2.0,I really liked the top over all. All except the cuffs of the sleeves did not match and at almost seems like the top has two right sleeves and it drives me crazy because the buttons get in the way and I can never straighten out the seam.
2.0,"Cheap-looking, cheap-feeling, and not the pictured light yellow but a bright Pikachu color."
2.0,"Tight fit, strings are short to tie"
2.0,"Fades after 3 washes, a little small"
2.0,Got the Mario socks for my boys.  Cute socks and well made but why in the world is there a K on top of the Mario and Luigi socks?? Doesn’t make sense.
2.0,"The finger bands weren’t  stretchy enough and one broke the first time I tried to put it on. I got the rest on and two more broke over the course of the night. I used wire to tie them on, and it still looked pretty cool. I have little hands and thin fingers, so I don’t think it was a size thing."
2.0,"This is a jacket, not a coat.  It arrived in a tiny box/bag, and I couldn't pack even one of my coats in them if I did my best.  Having said that, it does LOOK like the picture, except it arrives wrinkly, and looks inexpensive.  I am tall (6'1&#34;) and this did not fit my torso correctly, or my arms.  In case someone like me is wondering how this looks on a tall, curvy lady (185 lbs), I have included a photo. The waist of the jacket hits really far above my natural waist, so it makes me look frumpy/boxy.  I am sending it back, but... As far as quality, I feel like I probably should have guessed by the price (shame on me).  Also, the arms are very slender, so while I ordered an XL, I wouldn't be able to wear this over a sweater (it was tight on the long sleeved t shirt I was wearing in the photo).  And the arms are too short (by at least two inches).  I do not have a problem with the product, per se, but it isn't clear from photos or descriptions what you will actually receive."
2.0,very small and does not fit at all and it is suppose to be X large?
2.0,This was suppose to be a bit adjustable but NOT AT ALL.  Runs small and would be appropriate for someone with a small neck or younger girl like less then 12 years old. I returned it immediately.
2.0,"I loved the three-fer and price, but once I put these into use, they just didn't make the cut. The adjustment mechanism bends to easily and the lenses go all out alignment with the slightest force. Would not buy again."
2.0,Fabric too then for fabric type.
2.0,"I saw it and wanted it to match my friends stroller, which is violet. Unfortunately it's more of a light jean color with the smallest hint of violet, my mom was not too happy. The bag quality wasn't that bad."
2.0,"I usually wear a 2X, so I ordered this in a 3X to give me room to wear over a sweater or something. The 3XL was slightly tight when wearing over a t-shirt and barely came to my belly button. No raising your arms while wearing this jacket! It was so absurdly small for a 3X that I checked the tag to see if I was sent the wrong size... nope! I'm very disappointed in the sizing because it is a beautiful jacket otherwise!"
2.0,"I liked the design, it's pretty comfortable, I like that it's adjustable but I'm returning it because the main thing I want is to see the color changing with the temperature (none of them change by mood BTW). Disappointed that it was always a dark grayish color."
2.0,Irregularity in slipper size. One fit fine the other was too big. Not sure why there is so much difference!
2.0,"looks gorgeous on line but in person, you need to have that models body you see in the pic"
2.0,Had to return. Runs super small
2.0,"Well made, but sizing is way, way off. I ordered a XXL for myself, but it will not even zip up. However, it fits my wife, and she is a size large.<br /><br />The jacket has bottom drawstring, and back pocket is very large. Material is soft and lightweight...Judy perfect for cycling.<br /><br />Overall a well designed product, but size is a concern."
2.0,Great if you’re a tiny woman. Not for someone with a big butt and double Ds. Had to cut the bottoms.
2.0,"Beware - this is an asian cut coat, so buy a size or two up."
2.0,Cute bathing suit but material was a little too cheap looking for me. Had to return.
2.0,Waaaay to small! Double size up!
2.0,Shirt is way too small. Pants are right size. Material is not great compared to most TB products.
2.0,Cute hats. But they are not fleece lined. And there is not a ponytail hole in either hat; they are just regular hats. So the description is completely inaccurate.
2.0,"Based on the reviews I ordered a size larger than normal - and it was much too tight EVERYWHERE.  Extremely disappointed in the fit, fabric and overall look.<br /><br />It was inexpensive so not worth returning. Going in the donation pile."
2.0,I bought these as rewards for students that I keep in my substitute teaching bag.  More than half of them did not work right out of the bag.
2.0,Pocket was ripping within a month of wearing.
2.0,If you are not 5'6 or 5'7 these ware way to long.  Make sure you check length.
2.0,"Unfortunately i wouldnt reccomend this product, new looks great but as of this date 2/19/21,after having for less then one month the silver plating is almost all removed and the gold tone underneath is starting to turn finger green. Sadly i Guess its time to throw it out!"
2.0,"These buttons are TINY, about 1&#34; in diameter.  Tough to read if someone is wearing them on a shirt or a costume.  These are not a good value."
2.0,"this is a pretty cheap wallet and it very much shows - its the kind of thing you would buy in chinatown for $5 ... i dont think it will fall apart right away or anything like that but it will not last very long either... i will probably NOT use it and overall it is not something that i would ever want to give or receive even as a stocking stuffer gift - the weird inscription on it, which i didnt realize at the time of purchasing, is just a little wacky/over the top... and i know that often stuff translated and sold in stores that import things from china have these weird inscriptions.... but this is just too much and doesnt match the style of the wallet<br /><br />i dont think anyone should pay more than $5 for this one and as such i would not be able to recommend it - if youre looking for something brightly colored and to give as a gift to a young girl... maybe this is a good bet - but otherwise i cant really imagine a use or occasion for this.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review – For almost 10 years I’ve relied on amazon reviews more than anything else when buying items online and my assessment of the item is based solely on my experience using it and desire to help others buy the products that work for them! [if you found this review helpful click below - happy shopping :) ]"
2.0,Oh well you get what you pay for.
2.0,Colors do not look anything like the picture! It's very faded and mute. Also the material of the shirt is very cheap and uncomfortable. I definately  do not recommend this.
2.0,The product is sturdy but doesn't offer much relief from the sun.
2.0,way too big and not the same color as pictured it was orange.  Cheaply made I won't use this company again.
2.0,"Beautiful, but not covid safe at all. Zero protection.  Description does say its mesh, but the picture looks way different than actual product.  This item is a great vanity addition to whatever boring mask you already have.  Item should be labeled as mask decor.  It terrifies me that people are out there buying this and thinking it works against covid."
2.0,"Short we're nice, but way to big."
2.0,"Very good price, but too small"
2.0,"As you can see from the photos, these are lower quality than what was advertised. Given the low price, I did expect a bit of difference from what was shown to what I would receive but this is just... bad.  The star points are uneven and one bit is unevenly cut off. The hoops connecting the chain to the star looks extremely fragile and squished. I would be worried that any pressure would snap the weak points. The front face of the stars is already marked up, I believe due to the fact that the earrings are sent in a small bag, where the metal can brush up against itself and are not secured away from each other on the black foam that came in the jewelry box.<br /><br />The moon posts are already bent. I didn't realise or notice in the advertised photos, but both of the moons face the same way, so they can't be worn ( ) but only ) ). Turning one upside down would not work, as the chain would be on top.  The front face of the moons look to be unmarred.<br /><br />I didn't even bother to try them on. Took them out of the box, saw what was sent, took pictures for the review and now I'm going to send them back for a refund. Will not buy from this brand again.<br /><br />---------------------------<br />I purchased two different sets 1) the moon and star set and 2) the bar and lighting set. Even though they are different items, I seem to only be able to leave one review on this listing?<br />The following is my review of the Bar and Lighting set, I will separate them later if I am given or find the option.<br />---------------------------<br /><br />The Bar Earring pair just miss being ""keepable"" quality. They are cute, but the front face of the bars are slightly marked up. I'm assuming this is due to the fact that they were packed in a small plastic bag with nothing to keep them separated. They are not even in length and width and it is just enough of a difference that I was able to tell upon first taking them out of the bag.  It doesn't look like it would be enough to tell when wearing them, but I did not put them on as I knew I would be returning them. The link attaching the bar to the chain looks to be thinner than the chain itself and I would be worried about them breaking off. There is just enough wrong with them that I will be taking the option to return them, since I can.<br /><br />The Lightining Earring pair is very cute. They look to be fairly well made, all the crystals shine and the hoops connecting the earrings to the chain looks to be sturdy. I would actually love to be able to keep just this pair, but since it is a 2 set deal with the Bar Earrings, I will have to return them when I send in the Bars. I think I'm actually more disappointed about that than the Bar Earrings being poor quality.<br /><br />I will be sending this set back for a refund and will not purchase from this particular brand again."
2.0,Does not really keep your body warm the way I expected cool gear to do.
2.0,I thought it was the top and bottom no it's just the bottom can't see where to buy the top so ??? Not pleased bottom fits
2.0,It looked like I was wearing a moo moo; way to large
2.0,Lenses had scratches in them upon opening the box
2.0,"This is one of those clothing items that looks better in a picture on the web than it does when you are actually holding it. There's nothing wrong with the fit, and the material seems perfectly fine. But, to put it bluntly, as my wife did when I gave it to her, ""It's ugly."" Enough said."
2.0,"These leggings are so cheap, one wash and the're faded, ten washes and I can see through them. Don't waste your money."
2.0,"This is not the same material, color, or look that is shown in the picture."
2.0,"I was under the impression that this was larger and was a functioning whistle, it was NOT and was VERY small"
2.0,"It's very large width wise, and there's no real support in the cups"
2.0,"On the coral bottoms, the front has lining, but back is too sheer. Top fits a bit loose around rib cage..Too bad bottoms not fully lined makes it unwearable to me. This would have been a really good suit for my teen otherwise."
2.0,Very flimsy! Broke away from watch face easily and almost lost the whole works.
2.0,"Quality seems good, but the large size is still too snug on my size 5/6 daughter."
2.0,Looks great in the pack. Not so good looking after wash tho!
2.0,"REALL tiny and cute, but the posts bend very easily."
2.0,Son muy anchas
2.0,"its ok, used it for a neck wrap hunting."
2.0,"Glasses were as expected, but there was supposed to be a cleaning kit and a second pair of SD glasses.  Only received the Ray bans.  Had to email back and was told would receive the missing items but as of today nothing.  Kind of screwed up a Christmas gift."
2.0,The sweater was tight and too small<br />I gave it away<br />Thank you<br />Tanja Bryant
2.0,This bikini runs really big and is really thin cheap fabric. I was also not expecting it to have pink in the cow print.
2.0,I gave 2 stars bc it's actually a cute top. But order up two sizes. It wasn't worth tha hassle to order another size.  Sent it back.
2.0,The image of Bane's mask on the neck gaiter is very faded. It doesn't look like the picture and is hard to tell that it's supposed to be Bane's mask.
2.0,Loose and flattering
2.0,These would eventually fall off my earlobes throughout the course of the day.
2.0,Cute hat but the snap that connects the Pom Pom came off before even wearing it. It’ll be returned.
2.0,"Full of knots and melted clumps of links, the chain is dirty and sticky and smells unpleasant on. It also turned my neck a lovely shade of grunge. I know it was inexpensive so I didn't have super high expectations, but I didn't expect it to feel like something off the workshop floor. I plan on replacing the chain myself with something a little less gritty at some point because I love the birds, but until then it's unwearable."
2.0,The product has an out of proportion top and shoulder area.
2.0,"the tassels are made from a really cheap yarn/thread. they're uneven. i tried cutting them myself to even out. If i'd know i'd be finishing the product, i would not have paid more than $2.00."
2.0,"Of the 6 ,3 have broken BEFORE I even wore them. Super disappointed."
2.0,Correct size but the sew was a little loose on both side it look weird
2.0,looks cheap and the zipper is bad. i guess you get what you pay for
2.0,"Wanted more of a ball type cap, not a “truckers” hat, too tall for what the picture shown, was a good quality hat though."
2.0,could not push onto pandora bracelet. removed silicone rings & used as plain spacer
2.0,"I purchased an Xs as I have with many other brands. I like a compressed fit.<br /><br />These are more like a small. I suggest sizing down for a normal fit and down 2 for compressed fit.<br /><br />The crotch area was saggy<br />Fabric was soft, vibrant and squat proof.<br /><br />I opted to return due to saggy fit"
2.0,Cute but it was poorly made. Started falling apart at seams when trying it on.
2.0,"I bought this cardigan for my wife who is 5'7'', weighs 145 lbs. and consistently wears a size 16.  This cardigan was too small, but that was not the worst thing about it.  The side pockets are so shallow that they are totally useless.  They are not deep enough to stay on the inside of the jacket and bulge out for a lump on both sides look. I do not recommend this product."
2.0,"At first sight, the design looks nice, however that's where the pros end.<br />Cons:<br /> - the socks run very small, even for my tiny little girl<br /> - there is nothing deluxe about these socks; after just one wash they look worn out, very cheap.<br />After giving one pair to my little girl to wear once and seeing how small they are I wanted to return them, but washed that pair before sending them back. Giving how old that pair looks now (as if it has been worn for years and through countless washes), I cannot return it in good faith.<br />Definitely very low quality socks."
2.0,"It's very pretty but not as long as I thought it would be.<br />Not impressed with how quickly and easily the two necklaces get tangled together.<br />Assumed it would be made better, so as to prevent that from happening.<br />Would not purchase again😕"
2.0,I gave this product two stars and that's me being generous because if zero stars was an option i would go with zero stars so not only was the delivery an issue I had to get it re delivered. A day later I finally received the product I tried it and no matter how much I closed it the nose cuff kept falling out of my nose. So i wasted my money basivally... so i hope everyone who's considering buying this product will see my review and not purchase this horrible product OOO IM SO MAD 😠 DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS IT IS NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!
2.0,"Very low quality, but what can you really expect for $10? I returned them."
2.0,"Received the first one and nose wire at the bottom of the mask, for it to work I'd have to wear the mask upside down. Did a return and replacement order - same problem. It's a very nice, well made (except for nose wire placement) good looking. I'm sure I'm not the only one with this problem and wish Amazon's quality control was used on this product."
2.0,"Poor clarity, not like in picture. Otherwise ok"
2.0,These were a big hit but the bow was broke off when i got it i just super glued it back but I wasnt happy it came broken.
2.0,I have small ears and the jewelry itself was pretty but the bar was too short and the jewels themself were wayyyyy too big for the upper part of my ear.
2.0,Plan on returning ..did not know the guess and stainless steel words don't come off lenses. It doesn't look right. Would have been a great pair of glasses otherwise.
2.0,Too big for Small..
2.0,The description says they are 19” long. The ones I received were between 21-22”. Way too big for me. I returned them.
2.0,"Very stretchy, metal clip in back keeps slipping and the material shows marks where it slips through the metal. I use these every day, I work at Home Depot and use suspenders to hold my orange apron on. Not at all pleased with them."
2.0,Zipper wouldn’t stay up- kept slipping down leaving about 1/3 opening. Super annoying
2.0,"Gloves were okay, got the job done. Used them in Colorado at 17° and my hands were still freezing - I ended up buying little hand warmers to put in them to keep my fingers from freezing ! Nothing special & finger grip to use touchscreen phone was pointless. I had to take the glove off each time to use my phone screen."
2.0,Not flattering. arm holes are so tiny.
2.0,I didn't like the look of it.
2.0,"The material is very thin, feels cheap. Should have gotten a large as well, this runs a little small."
2.0,I dont like it. The word ' crown #is mispelled. If you have lots of cards the button wont close so now my wallet is always open. Its expensive for the quality that you will receive. My 10 dollar nine west wallet bought from ross was way nicer it lasted for 2 years and is still nice until now . I purchased this one because I like the color.
2.0,"Terrible fit, much shorter than appears in picture."
2.0,It is too big for a 6 but the shirt is good. It just doesn't fit.
2.0,Shoe size fits my child’s foot but getting the heal into the boot is hard.  I have to undo the laces every time my child wants to wear them.  Boots look great and once they are on they are fine.  But getting them on is challenging.
2.0,"Shoehorn works good, but shipping was a pain. For some reason they required a signature to receive the package which was a pain..For that reason I give them a 2 star."
2.0,Returned this. Material was very thin and cheap looking.
2.0,"The design I received was a paris themed design but not the same one. Mine has tables and couples and birds, no birdcage. The one I got is really dirty looking. It looks like it's white in the picture but it's more like eggshell beige. I'm pretty disappointed. I feel like it's false advertising if you send something similar but not the exact item"
2.0,"This is ok. It does not provide any support, the fabric is thin. I ordered a medium and it wasn't enough coverage. Would not buy again."
2.0,"Two stars ONLY because the quality seems fine!<br /><br />But, the title is:<br />Men’s Workout Athletic T-Shirts Quick Dry Lightweight Muscle Shirts Casual Workout Tee<br /><br />...Men's, you say?<br /><br />Either Amazon screwed up, so... these are youth sizes? (see my photo...)<br /><br />At 29, I dont think even a leg would fit through the neck hole....<br /><br />Buyer Beware!<br /><br />.....Returning, obviously!"
2.0,"Looks cheap, you get what you pay for"
2.0,"They are really pretty,  but they suck not able to see clearly  the only thing a see is a light reflection,  glare ."
2.0,"The sizing for this dress is not true at all. It's smaller than expected, although made of good quality material, especially for the price"
2.0,"So are these silk or satin?  Maybe polyester?  Description says silk, then satin, but tag said polyester 🙄"
2.0,About 10% didn't work.
2.0,The material is not great.
2.0,That earrings themselves are beautiful but They are really really big. And luckily I don’t have a really big earlobes but even though I don’t I have to put my ears in each hoop tk make it look like the earrings fit my ears. They are not comfortable at all.
2.0,Did not fit as expected. Purchased XL but it fit like a medium.
2.0,Frayed & unevenly braided.  Do not stay tied.
2.0,"the design needs to be tailored a bit more to a woman's body--and fabric was unforgiving, no stretch ,true to size."
2.0,Made with very cheap thin materials. Nice design but not worth the money.
2.0,"I'd be a little more forgiving in this review if the manufacturer didn't dishonestly try to pass it off as in any way &#34;Swiss&#34; - and then when pressed on it, add the silly (and insulting to actual Swiss watchmakers) disclaimer<br /><br />&#34;The biggest advantage of Swiss watches is the Swiss technology and standard, not the people.&#34;<br /><br />Um, no.<br /><br />But anyway, I knew all this going in, and I bought one because I wanted a minimalist design and this looked reasonably attractive. But truth be told, it doesn't look as good as in the picture. It just exudes an aura of &#34;gumball machine&#34; low quality. I got this on lightning deal with another 40% off. This dropped the price to under nine bucks, which made it a somewhat worthwhile purchase. Barely.<br /><br />Here's the deal. Brigada is one of those bargain bin uber cheapo watch manufacturers who artificially inflate their prices here on Amazon so they can sucker people into paying much much more than the watches are actually worth. Seventy five dollars normal list price? For this barely acceptable watch? &#34;Swiss&#34;? Bahahaha.<br /><br />If you want a quality cheap watch sold at decent (honest) cost, there are several brands worth considering - such as Lige, who make really nice and attractive watches for a good price. I cannot recommend Brigada, they're simply not an honest company."
2.0,They block the light but they do nothing for the color.
2.0,The art was nice but everything about it was to big  not really impressed
2.0,"I received the package in good time. Tryed the ankle bracelet on and too, too small. You cant see the heart or the beads on it! Not worth the money!"
2.0,The quality of the item was very poor. The shoes appearance were very cheap.
2.0,"A perfectly nice, cute, and sturdy clamshell-style sunglass case, but be warned, it is VERY large. I carry a quite large shoulder bag, and this still seems to take up too much space. If you carry a dainty purse and want to have your shades handy and protected, this really would not be the right thing.  (OK, I guess I have made that point.) I am going to look for something smaller."
2.0,"When it arrived I thought I was nice because the pendant is nice. Once I wanted to wear it, the chain is old, gray and nasty. Was so disappointed and couldn't return. Not my best purchase on Amazon."
2.0,"EDIT: washed and now there is red fuzz all over my laundry!<br /><br /> This is a beautiful cover up! I'm 5'3 165lbs and usually wear medium or large tops. This fits me perfectly. If you are tall, it might not be long enough for you. It comes to a few inches below my butt. The only thing I don't like about this piece is that it has a strong dye smell that I hope will go away with a wash."
2.0,"This is a nicely-made buckle, but it's HUGE: unless you're six feet five, a defensive lineman in the NFL or like belt buckles the size of Captain America's shield, it's likely too big. If you're under five feet nine, definitely forget about it unless you want it to obscure your entire body."
2.0,"First-the smell. Many people have mentioned it, and it’s really as strong as they say-because it’s goat “leather” and it smells extremely unpleasant. I try to be very careful buying bags on Amazon because I have been fooled before-my fault for not being more cautious this time.<br />Second-the straps aren’t leather, so don’t think you’re getting a quality bag-they’re a noticeably  different and cheap plastic material.<br />Third-I found the description misleading, so I ordered it thinking leather meant cow leather-usually sellers are more open about it when they use other types of animal hide. When I asked this specific question via email after I received the bag and attempted to air it out, they couldn’t seem to find my order information.<br /><br />The second star is for the size-it is nice and large, if you can actually use it. Since the seller “can’t find my order” even when provided the order number, I will keep it out in the garage for the winter and use it as a car organizer if the smell is gone by spring."
2.0,"It is good quality. Actually liked the color and the material BUT if you have large breast like me it will pull the sweater up and it just looks weird. I'm 5’2  with some curves (36D) ordered a medium, should've ordered a large."
2.0,Just so people are aware these are not leggings like the kind a kid would wear with a shirt or something. They’re like long underwear with weird double seams in the crotch/butt area. Almost like tights.  So if you plan to wear them as pants skip these. They are thick and nice- would be great for leggings if they were leggings. But the seams  ruin that.
2.0,"Very disappointed in this product, lasted me just 2 weeks before the end of the cables became loose."
2.0,They are cute but I ordered a size medium and they were completely see through. I normally order a small but ordered a size bigger this time and it was still very tight and see through. I am pretty disappointed.
2.0,No me agrado la textura de la tela.
2.0,"This is the second time I ordered this product!!  The first lanyard lasted for over a year.  I love it and get so many compliments on the rainbow colors.  The second one which was delivered Feb is already broken.  The strings didnt break it just seems like it came unlatched on one side of the lanyard-  I can see the loop for the ring but don't think I can fix it to go back through the large bead towards the ring.  I cant get it back on nor return because its been over 30 days now.  I'm sad because I love wearing this daily, but don't think it's worth it to keep buying if they're not even latched on correctly to being with."
2.0,nothing to say about it
2.0,"Very cute, I enjoyed them for the first few days I wore them before the mitten section began to detach from the fingerless-glove section.  Very poorly constructed."
2.0,Way too big for me!
2.0,"I ordered the white of this dress months ago and is completely fine, but the light gray is cut lazily and has choppy fabric. The fit, sewing. And actual fabric quality is fine, but this one did not come with a bandeau as the white one did. I ordered the white from this same seller."
2.0,Runs very small even when I went by size chart. Could not clip bra and not even close to cup coverage.
2.0,"This product was well crafted and quite heavy to wear on your ear, but the problem is you have to have super small ears to have the dragon tail slip over the top of your ear to hold it in place. I hoped I could bend the tail to shape it to my ear, but the metal is heavy and not flexible at all."
2.0,"The ring is cute, but a stone fell out within a week."
2.0,2 of the 3 bands did not fit
2.0,"This material likens to a vinyl covered canvas. And although it is stiff, it's sheer and you can definitely tell the religion of the wearer. If VPL's are your thing, this is for you. If they are not, go with another selection. The inside leg seams pull a bit higher than the outside leg. The rise cuts very close, as well. Maybe you can &#34;tuck&#34;, but there's only so much tucking one can do in these. Returned.<br /><br />The brilliant white color is very nice, however."
2.0,"I have a big head, so I always have problems finding glasses that fit. These are painfully tight, sharp edges. My wife has a normal head, and said that these are super tight on her too. Not sure who tested this before designing, but it's extremely uncomfortable."
2.0,First day I wore it the chain busted so easy
2.0,I love these. They’re gorgeous and great to wear everyday. I promised myself I’d take care of this pair so I took them out every night before bed…and they still broke after just a couple of weeks 😖
2.0,"It only clips on one way, the image will not turn so that if I clip it on certain ways the picture is upside down or sideways. But the elephant is cute."
2.0,Agreed doesn't look anything like the photos. First off my biggest issue with it is the color. The original photo shows a muted pink and I got a really bright pink. And in general as a woman I hate pink. So I needed the muted pink. Next the fit is all wrong. Too fitted and the bottom helm is not present in this cardigan. It's more like an ugly sweater than a cardigan.
2.0,"I was skeptical on buying this bag because of all the bad reviews but i still purchased it anyways. This bag is terrible for 15 dollars I was expecting better quality. It’s really thin and flimsy, the zipper doesn’t go all the way across, and the strap feels like it’s going to snap any second. It’s more like a children’s toy."
2.0,"I loved this bra until I noticed that it was bruising me! The bra fits very nice but if you have soft underarms the supports in the side might give you bruises. the first couple times I wore it I just thought that I wasn't used to the support because my old bra was well, old. That was until last night I noticed that I have a quarter-sized bruise under each armpit from the top of the side support on the bra."
2.0,"Beautiful.  However absolutely no grip on the soles, really slippery.  Some of the leather lining on the bottom of the golden parts was loose too.  Don't wear them much."
2.0,"I own so many Bvlgari sunglasses, they are all so beautiful and have great lenses. This one doesn’t, the brown lenses are very dark, I could barely see something with it. Will return."
2.0,Wrong size received
2.0,"This runs really big. I'm 4'11&#34; and 108 and it was huge. It has no shape to it and was way too long - the model in the picture made it look nice but in real life, it's cheap, off color, and huge."
2.0,"This hat was a big disappointment.  The actual hat was great. When it was mailed, it was folded and consequently, changed the look of the hat. I would suggest changing the method of transport.  I was going to give it as a gift which I was going to decorate.  Now, I will give it to my grandchild to play dress up."
2.0,"I wanted to love this; I love the look of it, it was lightweight, and easy to put on. However, the magnets get caught on anything metal you come close to. Also, when you bend your wrist, it folds back and loosens while getting caught on the hair on your wrist. Bummer"
2.0,XL Arms too long. Waste and shoulders are too tight. Fit seems to be designed for thin framed people.
2.0,The dress was really tight at the bottom and big on the top. I was not a fan of the material. I thought it would be more Of a cotton material it was more sheer. Cotton is easier to dress up and down.
2.0,"Too small. If you're going to order, order a couple sizes up."
2.0,The legs fit fine but the waist was huge! At least 4&#34; too big. I have to return them.
2.0,"You get what you pay for, this is cute but VERY small in the shoulders and the right lace on the arm came off before I ever wore it."
2.0,"Pants fit great, and are very warm, but not suffocatingly so. Major problem i have, is they tore near the seam after one wash on gentle. Very disappointed after dropping almost $40 on each pair."
2.0,I ORDERED TOO LARGE AND RETURNED THEM  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT IN THE RIGHT SIZE
2.0,Adult size barely fit my 5 year old
2.0,This set of pajamas are too transparent. Doesn’t keep the kid warm n cozy.
2.0,Glue is not good. Comes apart
2.0,"Well is says is for kids. But I think is more for ages born to 3yrs to 4yrs. My son is 10 yrs. and they don't fit him. He still uses them but they go through the neck, it doesn't fit him through his head."
2.0,"Not really well made, but I wasn't expecting much."
2.0,These are cute earrings but they slip off.
2.0,Stems are rectangular.  I cannot wear them and gave them to someone else (with larger earring holes).
2.0,The shipping took forever! I had to email them just to figure out wat was taking the item so long. The lens of the glasses are almost like buying readers looking through them kind of hurts my eyes.
2.0,"I ordered a medium and it’s a bit too wide in the neckline, but ok tight everywhere else. I got the white and the fabric is like a very thin teeshirt material. See through of course. The sleeves are pretty so that’s good. The one I got had a hole in the side. Looked like a return. I won’t be trying another in this brand.<br />I got a black one from a different brand (BMJL Womens Puff Sleeve Tops Dressy Mesh Parchwork Shirts Square Neck) and the quality is better. Material thicker. The sleeves are a bit different and it’s not a sweetheart neckline. I am 34C and the small fits well. Medium was a little too big. I would recommend this one instead."
2.0,Very basic material.  Sized somewhat small.
2.0,"The hat is not really too small, but rather too flat, shallow. It should have been designed with a deeper structure, to be a man's hat. Disqualified for the average man. Otherwise a nice product."
2.0,"It was very pretty, but the quality of the material wasn't that great. If you are of a healthy &#34;top&#34;, you will  be disappointed.Unless you have the figure of the model shown..it will not work for you."
2.0,I use liquid silver cleaner for my silver jewelry but  hate the odor.  I decided to give this a try.  Waste of money.  Did absolutely nothing to my silver.. tarnish didn't even lighten.  Other jewelry cleaners for gold and gems did a much better job than this one as well.
2.0,Very thin material and they are see through
2.0,"I love how this looks, but it broke immediately. Too cheap."
2.0,"The plastic the shirt came in was vacuum sealed so tight that it ruined the shirt causing deep wrinkles and lines where you can see through the fabric. It felt like cardboard inside the package before I opened it. Quality of the fabric was not as nice as the pictures for sure. A lot thinner material in person which made the shirt kind of drape down the body loosely. It is a cute style, but I’m frustrated about the packaging and quality for the price. Makes no sense to vacuum seal the plastic like that. Use a larger package to send it in!"
2.0,"Always thought I had average size ears but this product is too short (?) to reach the top of my ear, once inserted into my earlobe.<br /><br />And, shipping took forever!"
2.0,"This dress was nothing like the photo. Different color and material...my daughter will wear it as a nightgown because there is no way I would allow her to walk outside with this as an actual dress. For the price it is a good nightgown because the fabric is really light and breathable; however, note the arm holes are huge and it is so loose you can see my little one's chest. Not happy with this at all!"
2.0,"The fabric is great, nice and drapey, not clingy.  Not see-through.  Pockets are a good feature.  I got the navy print and the pattern just landed wrong on the bodice area,  so I returned it.  Wear a size 6 dress and ordered a medium which fit just right.  I have this dress in the turquoise print which I do really like."
2.0,"The package included 4 pairs of small - medium size.  However, 1 of the gloves was NOT the same size as the others.  It was larger and longer in the fingers.  See the picture.  I asked for 1 glove to be sent to me so I can complete my craft project.  Instead they want to reimburse me $2.  I don't need $2 dollars.  I need just 1 mitten that is the correct size that matches the balance that were sent to me.<br />Thank you!"
2.0,"Teeny tiny cube, with a teeny tiny crystal, that looks like it is trying to find it's way out. I've decided to call it microjewelry. The 'crystal' is not attached to the cube cage, so it just rattles around in there, looking lonely.  The cube came with a chain, that must be for a very small child. I didn't even attempt to put it on, once I realized the chain, when doubled, fit like a bracelet on my wrist. It will not fit an adult neck, unless you like the choker look (and it will, choke you).<br />It's not worth the $6 I paid for it, but also not worth the hassle to return it.  I will get a new chain and gift it to my young cousin."
2.0,The color comes off on your blouse.
2.0,I've worn for approx two weeks to run in. 3+ miles almost every day. The seams chaffed the underside of my arms pretty significantly. Great shirts but I'm afraid missing skin is a deal breaker for me.
2.0,These broke after one week of being on his bag. They were not made well at all.
2.0,The socks are too thin in the toe and heel
2.0,"This jacket looks much better in the picture. It is very cheaply made and doesn't lie nicely at all. I'm quite flat-chested and no manner of adjustment could get the lapels to lay like they should. Although the jacket fit everywhere, it seemed like the button was placed about two inches too high. Maybe if you're super high-waisted it would work. I bought it to play a ringmaster for a one-time event, but I would never wear it again."
2.0,"Funny, the photo of the two people wearing the glasses...they are actually wearing a different brand from ThinOptics and not these glasses."
2.0,"These shorts run small! I normally wear a small in bottoms, and ordered a small in these, and they were too tight. They also flare out a lot on the sides, and not in a cute way. I definitely don't recommend these, but if you want to try them, size up."
2.0,"Wore for 1 night then when I took it off it just feel apart. Looks good if you only need it for one occasion, which I did."
2.0,Dress was cute until I washed it. Color faded significantly with first wash. Blue went to a blue gray and looked like it was an old hand me down.
2.0,The dress is nice and sits very well. However there is no underlining and so it is completely transperant.
2.0,It doesn't hang on you like it does in the photo
2.0,It is cheap looking you get what you pay for
2.0,Looked so nice in the picture. I should have read more carefully it is not cotton.
2.0,"It took the full guide time to arrive.  It included extra fixing bars incase the watch strap gap was measured inaccurately.  A  strip of tape across the seal would have been a good idea, as the card envelope had opened.<br /><br />Well after 14 months the colour has faded and the rubber has cracked, I thought it would last longer. I am going back to black."
2.0,Fabric smells bad and does not breathe.
2.0,"I got an XL because of the Asian sizing I should have gotten a L I usually wear a size 6 in American sizes (5’4” about 150/ 34DD). It was too big and looked like a mu-mu. Also, it’s cheap looking, like a Halloween store costume which was not what I was looking for. As a previous reviewer stated, the back is completely open, which the cape does cover but it moves so you can still see that and it’s also pretty sheer so I wouldn’t forgo undergarments. I ended up ordering a different Khaleesi dress that I really love, this will be going back."
2.0,Same product. Size 11-12 too large. Size 9-10 too small. Both were wide size.sizing could be better.
2.0,Good enough to wear once or twice.  Cheap but its expected for the price
2.0,Tarnishes after a few days wearing these.
2.0,"Bought several years ago, and just started using it.  The zipper came off, the drivers license plastic is not clear.  would never buy again"
2.0,"This is the second pair I purchase, somehow it's not a tight fit in the bar."
2.0,The large does fit like a medium. The colors were vibrant and beautiful (red & pink). Both sweaters I ordered arrived damaged. The pink sweater has a hole in it and several snags on the fabric. The red sweater has blue dye all over it. The material doesn’t seem like it would wash well or hold up very long. You could definitely not put it in the dryer.
2.0,"Parts of it were nice, but parts are poorly made.  It fell apart within an hour."
2.0,Very hard and scratchy material.  Long and narrow fit.
2.0,"Idea is cute but very thin (see through) and flimsy material with poor workmanship where the collar is sewed inside out. People will see the sewing hem on the outside if wind blows and flips the collar over. Seriously, at this price, the manufacturer should know better how to sew."
2.0,Looks cheaper in person fits smaller than expected.
2.0,Loved the blue print but returned it because it doesn't have a zipper!! Why would they make a coat without a zipper for a kid?! It even says full zip in the title! It's just snaps. Bummed because u loved the print.
2.0,Pretty thin material
2.0,Very weak.
2.0,I'm disappointed with the quality of this belt but it was cheap so I guess I got what I paid for. The grommet fell out of where the belt buckles after I wore it for the 5th time. I just wish this belt would have lasted longer.
2.0,"It runs large,"
2.0,"Thin material, not worth the money because you will still get wet."
2.0,The design is nice though loosely adhered to the hoodie. And the material that makes up the body of the hoodie feels plasticky.
2.0,"Looks cute, but very VERY cheap. Reminds me of the jewelry you would get out of the quarter machines in the 90s. It's hanging on my rear view mirror bc I can't wear that!"
2.0,"This wasn't what I expected. There is no scent to it, it just smells like wood, and the beads look more faded than I expected. I was also deceived thinking it was a bracelet because of how the photo looked all wrapped around small like that. It's a single-strand necklace. Not happy!"
2.0,They didn’t fit as expected. My feet weren’t as protected as I thought they would be. Didn’t like the fit.
2.0,The packaging made the item look cheap. The actual pendant is beautiful. It took me 2 hours to untangle the delicate necklace.
2.0,"Very small around chest no stretch, bottom much larger than top"
2.0,I have it two starts because it is cute but the sizing is WAY off! I even ordered a size up and it was still uncomfortably small.
2.0,The product runs extremely small. My normal wedding band is a 4.5 and the size 5 silicone ring is still too small for my hand.
2.0,Hat runs small.
2.0,"These shoes are adorable but not durable. They are made of plastic, which cracked in half after I wore them a couple times. I am a plus-size woman, but still... I didn't expect them to be made of hollow plastic."
2.0,Liked the style however it did not fit. The pants were baggy at the top however tight around my calf and ankle.  I ordered a small and I'm 5'6 and about 125 lbs
2.0,"When you buy something made out of polyester for cold weather you will pay the price. This item does keep you warm for about 1 hour. When you start working and begin to perspire, the moisture is retained inside the pants and you become wet. If you keep anything in the pockets of the pants, they become soaked. Then you get cold all over again. And this is dangerous if you live in the northern latitudes. I would not recommend these at all for northern latitudes. I live in Georgia and these pants did more harm than good as I was soaked when I took them off in weather that was in the low to mid 20s. If you stand around without physical movement, they may keep you warm."
2.0,fabric is thin and it runs small.
2.0,"I want it a nice Light Summer maxi dress that I really could wear around the house. The colors are beautiful on this dress. The dress was just too big and long for me period in the first picture I am wearing 4 inch black wedges and the dress is barely off the floor. I am 4 feet 11 inches tall so most maxi dresses are long, but it depends on the manufacturer. This dress seemed heavy. The Fit made me look large. On Amazon I usually buy a small or medium in dresses but this just made me look really frumpy and prego. 2 stars because I think it just didn't work for my shape and height, but it us cute."
2.0,"I bought my Granddaughter a half dozen, different Charm It Charm's. They may look good in pictures, found on-line, but buyer beware! The paint comes off with use. I regret giving my precious grandaughter such a poorly crafted item."
2.0,Es grande y tiene un tono de color más oscuro
2.0,Flare is too large
2.0,"Be warned, this is a slender fit. Hugs the body. Not loose fitting despite xlarge and tall size."
2.0,too big for my taste
2.0,"Had a small stain on the white part of the fabric in front which came out with stain remover. Unfortunately, when I washed it using the gentle cycle, the lace in the back unraveled."
2.0,"Adorable, but the points on the anchor catch onto everything! Came home from a night of dancing, and the anchor was gone! First time I wore it!"
2.0,Size was the biggest issue. Xlarge is more like a large but cute top
2.0,It was too large so I gave it away.
2.0,Pants were to short.
2.0,Poor fabric quality... design photographs well but looks cheap in person.
2.0,"Very disappointed. First off let me say that this is a well made, but you may want to get one a couple of sizes larger. I say a couple because I got the size that I wear and could get them past my thighs. Very small! I can recommend them with reservations."
2.0,"Boy the reviews are absolutely correct with this being extremely small.  I am using this as a nose earring,  but the hole basically swallows up the earring"
2.0,It broke veryy quickly
2.0,"Super cute, but way too small. had to give it away to my teenager. :/"
2.0,"Cute but the sizing is way off. I know they are stretchy, but I have a small wrist and these were super tight and uncomfortable."
2.0,Shirt fits fine. Disappointed in the hue.
2.0,"Outfit adorable, but NO HEADBAND! Disappointed."
2.0,"These aren’t fleece but okay. 4 bucks a piece, whatever."
2.0,Not true to size at all. Too small!
2.0,Runs small is an under statement. Should be listed as Girls or Children's But not for Woman
2.0,"I got two sizes up and it just doest work because we're the second shade of blue starts the hem line is to tight so it just doesn't work if u have hopes and a little gut... it won't fit right unless you are a toothpick in the mid section.. so I guess this one has to go back and I'll have to give up on this style of dress, that sucks cuz I like the dress but not on me"
2.0,Too small so tight on ears I could not wear them sent them back.
2.0,Once they get wet they are ugly
2.0,These look cheap and there is nothing &#34;vintage' looking about them.
2.0,"Looked like it had a shape to fit tighter on top, but it’s all the same big at the too"
2.0,The pants have a plastic-y feel.
2.0,"I was so excited to receive this watch band, but it did not fit my watch 😔.<br />I have a Galaxy Gear s3"
2.0,"Looked nice out of the box but ripped after first use right along the seam of my thumb - to be fair, it was after a few hours of light snow blowing but .... .... Unimpressive"
2.0,"Super cute, very flimsy and see through."
2.0,"It's what I was looking for. Cute and delicate, not too chunky but the clasp doesn't open all the way. And not worth the cost of returning. I fear I'm on borrowed time. Looks kinda cheap. I can't recommend"
2.0,"LENSES DID NOT FIT MY OAKLEY M FRAME, THEY WERE TO BIG TO FIT IN SNUGLY"
2.0,No era como lo esperaba
2.0,"Although this is very attractive in the picture, its entirely different as shown.  Much shorter, much lighter and in general not a good product.  Shipping was terribly slow and now for the bad news.  If you want to return this item YOU MUST PAY POSTAGE TO CHINA!!! I can't believe Amazon does business with this company!"
2.0,"It is ok if you have thin arms,and even thinner wrists, otherwise don't get it"
2.0,They fit nicely and are fairly priced but arrived with a run in one of the stockings.
2.0,"The soles are paper thin, while walking on gravel you can feel every single stone.  A hiking boot should cushion your feet from rocks and such.  They do seem to be fairly waterproof though, so I am using them in the yard.  I wanted hiking boots and I still need to find and buy some real hiking boots.<br /><br />My feet are kinda wide and I usually wear a 10 so I ordered a 10.  Apparently they are sized a bit smaller than my usual 10's so I really needed a 10.5.<br /><br />Other than these issues the boots are just ok."
2.0,The mask does not resemble the photo advertising
2.0,"These shoes were really cute, but they were WAY too long. I am normally a size 7 and I ordered that size.  I had to return them."
2.0,This product is China's sizing and still way smaller than charts. I ordered XL or XXL and it looked like a medium. Sent it back. But nice shirt super bummed it wouldn't work.
2.0,Rim of skirt not stiff to give look in photo.
2.0,"The spandex underneath does not fit properly, it achieves the ""look"" but none of the function."
2.0,"Beautiful at first...  very cheap quality.  One of the links broke while I was resizing... split right in half because the pins are so tight.<br /><br />After a day of normal wear, the finish is already worn off in multiple places and it looks terrible.  I suppose you get what you pay for."
2.0,This runs very small so size up. It is pretty tho and I will return for a bigger size.
2.0,So thin- might as well be a bathing suit cover up
2.0,"Pros: They are pretty and cheap.<br /><br />Cons: IMPOSSIBLE BACKINGS! I mean, impossible! I can't get many of them off so they are just laying with the rest of my jewelry and taking up space. They are almost fused to the actual earring so removing them, thus using them, is very difficult and not worth the cheap price."
2.0,The skirt fits as expected.  The material is not as good as expected.
2.0,"My head is a measured 55 cm, 6-7/8. I'm willing to look stupid in a hat as long as it fits my head. The hat was so big that it went halfway down my forehead. I had to either put my ears under it or they'd bend over. It's going back."
2.0,Nice jacket but runs small.
2.0,"The band looks nice and add character to the watch, but does not function properly. I cannot get the bands off since installed. Also, my watch does not consistently charge since applying the replacement bands."
2.0,What a beautiful belt! I purchased for myself-unfortunately returned had a strong smell to it...
2.0,"I purchased these because we had found that ""hospital"" socks worked very well for my almost 90 Year old mom, but that wasn't the case. with these socks  They constantly fall down and as she walks around in the house she ends up with big long socks on the end of her feet...and then these socks become a tripping hazards.  They are definitely not the real or typical hospital socks."
2.0,While the dress feels nicely made it is not the dress with the cross top as shown. The top is cheaply sewn in the middle. It’s like they took a different dress and added some stitching to make it look like the first photo.
2.0,Not very sturdy/quality and pictured item looks better then the real thing.
2.0,"These are cute, fit great, but wouldn't stay tight enough without having to stretch the string so much that it hangs to the floor."
2.0,I've had these for about year and loved them. However I started to have pain and it seemed infected all of a sudden. The earrings started deteriorating.
2.0,Size ran small and material of sweatshirt was not great. The cost to return the item would have been more then the shirt itself so we just kept it.
2.0,"The wedge and shape of these shoes make them seem like they will be at least moderately comfortable within the realm of heels. However, they fail to meet that minimum standard. Within an hour or so of wearing them, the plastic-esque straps began to dig into my ankles, leading to blisters and the undeniable realization that I will never wear these again."
2.0,"Dress is super cute, nice fabric, but barely covers your butt! Would not recommend for anyone with long legs"
2.0,Very thin. Could see through it.
2.0,It doesn’t cover the face as shown.. not worth my money.
2.0,So disappointed. Super cheap and no shape to it. Will be returning.
2.0,Very cute pants but very short!
2.0,I love the look of this ring and since my ring size fluctuates between a 5 and a 6 I went ahead and ordered 1 in both sizes and if I only wear it for a day I don’t have any problems but any longer and I get the green band.
2.0,After a few washings the material pilled. I also have to wear another shirt under it or my boobs fall out.
2.0,"It's just okay.  I kept it, but it's not something I recommend or would buy again."
2.0,It feels light and cheap.
2.0,They do help with the glare but I have to tighten the screw for the arm every day because it gets loose
2.0,Broke in a month
2.0,More like a kids size. Definitely too small for the average men's head.
2.0,"This dress looked lovely online but on my body type, with a little bit of a pouch and wider hips, it did NOT look flattering. The fabric is both stretchy and clingy. Although I could squeeze into the small, a medium would have been better suited. I also wasn't fond of the length of the dress which hit me below the knee, restricting my movement some. Will be returning. As a reference,  I'm a 36B, 135lbs, 5'4"" and I ordered a small (but should have gotten a medium instead)."
2.0,The skirt is cute on it’s own but im missing the red chain. I bought it for a specific outfit for a music festival so it was very disappointing.
2.0,Ordered these and the Enso rings to compare. These do not look nearly as nice. Returns are not free.
2.0,"They kept sliding down and rolling up, I was so sad, I wore them to go out for my friends wine tasting party and I knew it was going to be hot so I wanted to use these! I had to take them off within 5 minutes! Super disappointing"
2.0,"I recieved this and loved the feel of the material. Very soft and cooling. Not a very fattering set, but with the drape of the material that's expected. Unfortunately i noticed this morning, after wearing last might, there is a hole along the seam line.  I cannot figure out how to contact the company to see if a replacement would be authorized since looks to be a quality control issue.<br /><br />For the price of this set and the quality, based on the stitch issue, I would not reccomend this product."
2.0,"I like the look of it , BUT It did not fit my nose ... :("
2.0,"They are super thin on material,  so thin in fact that they look hairy where the black and red connect. I can still see glints of my skin at the seem. They look like they are coming apart."
2.0,Silky satin material and fits smaller than size
2.0,It looks beautiful in the picture but in reality it’s very poor quality! The nose ring is also very small and more difficult to put in...
2.0,"I was hoping for more from this dress but the material left much to be desired and I thought the hem would run straight down, however it curves out at the hips which is not flattering. Not my fav."
2.0,"It was very long and I did not want to hem. It was also very high waisted and looked old fashion cause it was too wide at the bottom. But good quality, just not my style."
2.0,These are tiny compared to what they should be. If you order make sure to order a size or 2 up. They are super nice and cute made good just small
2.0,"Love the bracelet itself, however the writing on the charm is so small that even with a magnifying glass it was hard to read. I wanted to give this to someone as an inspirational reminder but unfortunately will not be able to use it."
2.0,This was wayyyy too small. I fit small & mediums in most items. This fits more like a xxs-xs. Not as cute in person. I had to send this back.
2.0,"Overall, this is not the pair of winter tights I am looking for and here are why (for your reference, I am 6’6” and 105 pounds; usually wear size 0 or 26)<br /><br />Pro: your legs will looks slimmer because the tights are SO TIGHT!  And it probably okay for 32F above with boots on.<br /><br />Cons: very unfortunate! I can feel the tights every step I walk. Also, it is only for female that is under 165cm/6’5” as it is said on the package. It is too short for me even I try to even them very hard.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a size 0/00 and is 6’5 or below, this is the tights for you in mild winter."
2.0,Decent gift item
2.0,"Bought 2 of these, only one would whistles.  If you buy one you roll the dice."
2.0,"OK... the single caveat is that I am close to the upper end for the size I bought.<br />BUT every single one of the gray briefs fits just fine - perfectly comfortable & I'd buy them in this exact size again.<br /><br />OTOH, every single one of the black briefs is *significantly* smaller - sure, you can get them on, but they're too tight around the waist to be comfortable for all day wear: they feel like they're cutting into my waist after a couple of hours.<br /><br />Legs, butt, & crotch are fine for both colors but the QC for the black pairs dropped the ball here."
2.0,"Original review: Finally nose studs small enough that they don't show from the inside and sparkle on the outside. Super light, thin, and short - but go all the way through. LOVE THESE!!!<br />Update: nope. Tarnished already. Didn't last a week"
2.0,They look great and nice quality didn’t fit wrong size to small<br />Shipping was fast<br />I am in the Process of returning them
2.0,I bought 2 pair of these for my yoga classes and I was super bummed out that the inseam(the leg length) was too short. They fit great around my waist but were about 2-3 inches too short on the leg looking like high-water pants instead. I gave them to a friend who is shorter than me and they fit her great.
2.0,"Good quality, had to return them though way way too small. Good maybe for a baby but very very small"
2.0,It was a decent suit but was WAY TOO SMALL. And I don't think that if I ordered a size up it would help. It was just disproportional. Not impressed.
2.0,"cheap material, but if your a wear once kind of person, and you are 5'4&#34; or shorter, this could work"
2.0,The dress would fit if the sewn in shelf bra wasn't too small for my chest. Fits strangely at the top.
2.0,Not in any way flattering. I'm not overweight but this made me look like I am.
2.0,"Its thin, cheap and poorly made"
2.0,Too low slung for my feet to keep them on comfortably.
2.0,"Be sure or read the description clearly.  I assumed when buying earring(s), that it was for a PAIR of earrings.  This is for 1 earring only."
2.0,The hat was bigger than I thought it should be given the age range. The fleece was very low quality. Reminded me of a set thought be found in a dollar store or other discount store for less than maybe $7. Not worth the 17.50 I paid for it. I returned it.
2.0,"I ordered a black in this. And it’s not black, it’s navy blue. Very disappointed in the color. But it’s still a pretty shirt."
2.0,"I was really excited to receive this tee.  I love the acid wash look and design.  When I unpackaged it, the shirt is not a cotton or even t-shirt material.  It is more stretchy with a slick, sheen to it.  I am heavy chested, approx 165 lbs and ordered the XL.  The shirt fit, but it was not flattering at all.  It was very boxy looking and the material basically ruined it for me.  Had this been a cotton tee, I would have loved it and the shape probably would have been better.  I am returning it as I know I will never wear it."
2.0,These were very large and not not be adjusted small enough to fit my artist.  I returned them.
2.0,"I purchased these to use as part of a Halloween costume. The gloves are fine, but the sewing on some areas is very bad and I'm positive some of the stitching is already coming out after only wearing them twice. As a cheap component to a costume, they're fine, but don't expect great quality."
2.0,"I tried to follow the application instructions, but I was left with less than favorable results.  My hat now has a slightly mottled appearance. It is wearable, but I would NEVER try this on my more expensive Stetson.<br />Professional hat shapers are becoming a rare commodity, but for a proper re-stiffening or blocking they are a must.<br />For cheaper hats, I suppose you can try this product, but if my cheaper hat gets too worn out and floppy, I'll just toss it and buy another.  Cheaper to me is $100 or less."
2.0,The last time I rated this I gave it three stars this time I'm only giving it 2. This one fits but I had to order  almost three sizes up  so the sizing is not having any continuity. The fabric is completely different than the other one you can see through it it doesn't have such a smooth texture and seems rather catchy if you have any type of dry skin on your hands. It fits better but you can see through it. I got black because I didn't want to see through it. It doesn't have the same tags as the others so I'm guessing different manufacturer. I'm definitely not impressed and I doubt I'll be repeating this order
2.0,"I loved the way this looked on me. I’m always a little self conscious about my belly, especially after having a baby, but this romper made me look great. However, the seem on the outer leg ripped the first time I wore it. I was really disappointed."
2.0,Definitely not to size. Pretty but prob made overseas where everyone is 110 lbs & 5'0
2.0,HMMMM NO<br />THE MAIN REASON WHY I GOT THIS WAS BECAUSE OF THE ANTI FOG AND THAT DOESNT EXIST
2.0,Runs super small.....not worth the time
2.0,The picture on the website depicts the frames as clear when actually they are dark gray clear almost look black as you can see from the photo.
2.0,I liked it until it broke. Got out of the car and my keys all fell on the ground.
2.0,earrings are to large for a six year old child
2.0,Very poor quality. But I guess you get what you pay. Wore it once can't wear it again. Haven't wash it yet and it has like little fabric balls. It was cute.
2.0,The belt simply too small. It was reasonably priced which got my initial interest. It appeared to be a fairly good quality belt.
2.0,very big and baggy not flattering unless you are tall and skinny
2.0,Broke after 3 days 😔
2.0,The costume was fine but was missing the neck bow which is a key part of the costume
2.0,Nice hat but was too big. Came down past my ears.
2.0,Insole material is uncomfortable. Difficult to put on and take off. I wear a size 10 regular and the large size really doesn't work. Perhaps they will break in.
2.0,"Very thin, not much compression but not worth returning, lesson learned."
2.0,"Sadly I was very disappointed with the dress.  It fit fine but it's a cheap knock off of an original design.  The picture is the original the dress, but this dress is not like the picture.  The color is a little off (a little less vibrant) and the material is much lighter (weight) than the original.  The design on the outside wasn't a clean finish, instead it simply looks like the dress is turned inside out.... the original is much nicer. I was excited at first to find this dress but I see you truly get what you pay for, as the original was $80.  So, I turned the dress &#34;inside&#34; out.... and it looks like a normal dress, I simply removed the tag.  The flow & length of the dress is nice and so it's a decent summer dress & I found no reason to spend the time returning.  I guess I haven't learned my lesson yet and keep hope alive that buying cheap knock offs from China will work out."
2.0,"Item length did not match the picture, so could not wear it for my event.  Otherwise nice dress for the price."
2.0,"Geez just got these sleeves and they are so tight! I'm an average size man my arms are not huge. Tried one on thought it was going to cut off my blood circulation, these would fit great for a 12 year old but not for a grown man. I do not recommend these at all."
2.0,Great sign!!! very disappointed with the packaging when it arrived it was bent.
2.0,Se transparenta la tela<br />No son stresh<br />No es fresca
2.0,Ugh so disappointed!<br />The picture shows vibrant bright cheerful colors!<br />Well it's not The white is not white it is cream<br />The purple is dark and flat blah color!<br />The fabric is so thin! Far from being a beach blanket! Or  Yoga mat !<br />It is extremely thin and see through<br />It is more like a table cloth or Shaw if you will.<br />See photos of the thin edges<br />The fabric is like a thin dress scarf<br />I received this item for free or at a discounted price for my honest opinion
2.0,2 dance classes in and falling apart.
2.0,The wig is cute and useful for halloween. Mine came with the curls undone so I tried to curl it and it didnt really work out. The hair would fall off easy and couldn't keep the curling iorn to hot because it would melt the hair. I still used it for halloween but had to put it up and to the side so it can have a fun messy look because keep it down looked horriable. It was cheap in price and quality. I would spend a couple extra bucks and get one that would hold better.
2.0,Thin material on bottoms.
2.0,poorly made tie....They don't have any sizing's Marked at all.
2.0,I love the various tie dye colors because they are all bright and very attractive. This dress has a little stretch to it but not much. The material is soft and comfortable. It comes in a long sleeve and comes down to your knees. It is a form fitting bodycon dress that is kind of see through. I don't think it's the most flattering to my curves because it kind of hangs in awkward places like it's a little tight on my arms but hangs off my shoulders more than I would like it to. I do like the orange color that I chose.
2.0,"Liked these sunglasses, darker lenses compared to other baby sunglasses. Unfortunately they are destroyed after a short amount of time by a toddler who decided to twist the earpiece. Unable to be fixed."
2.0,"Just too much, although the green is pretty the gold is super brassy looking"
2.0,"This ring is beautiful.  Well worth the price.  And, best of all you can get it in small sizes, which is usually hard to do.  I wear a 4.5 and it fits perfectly.<br /><br />Update:  Had this ring for less than a year when one of the stones fell out.  Was not wearing it every day so it cannot be attributed to wear.  This is the second ring that I have bought by Sonia Jewels where a stone fell out.  Even though their jewelry is really pretty.  I will not be buying their jewelry again."
2.0,I have no idea why this bag smells so horrible :( It's stuffed with fabric softener sheets right now) It's really REALLY cheaply made.  I think the interior will last me maybe a month. But..it was cheap...and you get what you pay for... Atleast it's cute.
2.0,"Wore it once, dried once.  Wouldnt fit my chihuahua now"
2.0,The shirt ran small and the material was poor quality.
2.0,"The design looks great, but I am returning it due to lack of quality for the price point."
2.0,"Not sure if it was just a fluke but the zipper kept getting caught on the way up - not just once but several time. Frustrating. That was a major flaw in this hoodie. Also too big and bulky, heavy. Weighed a lot! Good for cold weather I guess except for that zipper thing!"
2.0,The material is inferior and was pulling at the seams. Very disappointed.
2.0,I brought both the 8mm and 10mm. For my correct gauge and it either didn’t close or it also closed but hurt too much. I love all of their other products but this one was a missed for me.
2.0,The lining came out of one shoe after one day of wearing them. Other than that they're comfortable.
2.0,Muy bonitos pero me quedaron chicos
2.0,product not of good quality..arms tight.Not true to size.
2.0,"These pants have a faux denim-like texture, which was not described. The waist has no stretch at all. I bought a medium and wear a size 28, I have larger bottom so I’m used to needing to shimmy into pants but I couldn’t get these over my butt or thighs. Had to return. Rebought bamans stretch yoga dress pants instead."
2.0,"I like this cardigan, and I bought it in two colors. I have worn the red one twice and got compliments both times.  However, the red one already has a hole in the bottom of the pocket despite the fact that I never use the pockets. So far the royal blue has held up, but I can’t really wear the red one now."
2.0,"I wish I hadn't bought these. They don't go up as high as I would like, and the spandex doesn't give it as stretchy a feel as I like. Won't buy again.  Also, the material was obviously not prewashed, since they shrunk a lot after I washed them the first time.  And the material isn't as soft as I'm used to in panties.  Very disappointed."
2.0,Was not impressed. The material felt cheap and it was too big.
2.0,Broke in a week. But it does look nice.
2.0,Maybe it was this brand but this size did not fit me even though it does in all other brands.
2.0,It’s not very thick and a little thin.
2.0,Wine color stole is not wine color at all. Its simply RED.
2.0,"They are nice, good size and comfortable but do not have a high definition polarized lens as described. They even send a test card and with the glasses  you can not see anything."
2.0,"I don't love the smell, as it smells like chemicals. It's not very strong either, so if you need it to cover a very intense smell this isn't for you."
2.0,I used these to drive and 1 month later they are ready for the trash. They are good gloves but not for driving.
2.0,"Rated Amazon’s #1 THINNEST material, over rated expensive nightgown robe.  Double Thumbs DOWN"
2.0,Beautiful dress but didn't fit me the way that I needed it to. I'm older.
2.0,"Super cute and love them, but I was sent the wrong size.... Ordered a 4 and got a 2 so my sister (who they were gifted to) has them just sitting in a box. ."
2.0,"Not worthy of even my cheapest watch.  Terrible cheap looking tan/brown color and the deployment, which works fine, is brushed and not polished as shown in the illustration."
2.0,"These are super cute, fit well, & my Kindergartner LOVES them. However, it took only a week or two of occasional wear for the stitching to start fraying in several areas."
2.0,This product shows signs of discoloration and loss of elasticity after only about 130 - 140 hours (4 to 5 months the way I pace my regular swimming) in a swimming pool environment. It is un-usable after 6 months of my regular swimming schedule.
2.0,Pants fit a lot bigger on me. The top is perfect but pants keep sliding down. I wish there was a way to choose different sizes for top and bottom. I did think the material was going to be thinker for sure from the looks. The material is pretty thin.
2.0,"This was an exchange for the original dress that was purchased (due to a defect in original). The dress was cute, but I received a dress 2 sizes too small and not even the dress that was originally purchased. Not sure what happened?"
2.0,Skimpy. I have a one size fits all with ample fabric. This is NOT
2.0,"I purchased this for my wife, to match a gold south sea pearl I purchased for her through a jeweler. I was disappointed in what I received, just not the same level of quality, it looked cheaper than I expected and it is something that should look super classy."
2.0,"inside lining delaminated after a month or so, and in a few months, the rubber in the outside ripped. price reflects quality."
2.0,Not as long as pictured. It's cute but it stops much shorter than the product pictured
2.0,tight fit for size 11 foot
2.0,"This band is so cute. However, after wearing it about a week the material stretched out and it started to slide around on my wrist. Not really worth it."
2.0,I ordered this shirt to wear to a party. Unfortunately the clear ring that connects the shoulder strap to back of the shirt on the right was broken. So I didn't get to see how it actually fit. I gave it 2 stars because I liked the design and it did come on time.
2.0,knot fell apart
2.0,"I was very pleased with the ThinOptics cases I purchased for my iPhone 8 and iPhone 11, but this new design is a big disappointment. As you can see in the photo, the case offers no protection to the front of the upper right corner, due to warping of the case."
2.0,"Beautiful, my daughter loved it but chain broke super fast. Very disappointed"
2.0,It faded terribly in one season.  Will get a better one this year.
2.0,There is no elastic at the waist so it sags on my hips. The lace around the thighs also don't have elastic so it was tight around my average sized thighs. I looked like a sausage.
2.0,"While pretty, the bow is far tinier than pictured and the gemstones immediately fell out. Not worth returning as it is an extremely inexpensive product and a bit of super glue will fix the gemstone issue, but as a general rule I don't like to have to glue new purchases together."
2.0,Very tight waistband. Shrunk after washing. Beautiful material.
2.0,Was to small. I returned mine. I have a d cub and looked for a cup. The bottoms run small too. Beautiful color
2.0,The boots themselves look great but I was extremely disappointing when I received them already with a tear in the material used at the tip of the boots which was blatantly showing. Needless to stay I returned them. I'd suggest getting the same pair on the official timberland site or getting them at an outlet like Macys.
2.0,Looks and feels nice. Definitely order larger though!! You can totally see the pads on the bra area through the top.
2.0,"I am 5'8 curvy about 215 lbs. The dress was so tight around my chest the under slip hit high thigh not low/mid thigh. The back butt zipper is no bueno. It's doable for $20 or a Halloween costume. But, not $55.00"
2.0,I did not look hard enough at the description of this shirt hence it was not what I wanted.  Please take note that since it is 95% Polyester / 5% Polyurethane (Spandex) it is very clingy and showcased every imperfection on my body.  This was not was I was looking for so it is going back.<br />This did arrive on time and in good shape.
2.0,It’s on the smaller side
2.0,Fit smaller then hoped.  Gave it to my grandson. Fit him better.
2.0,"This would have been a decent bra.... however, they put the wrong size under wire in the left cup. It is too small so I am not fully supported on one side. The other side is fine. The bra has held up being washed and would be comfy otherwise."
2.0,The thickness of the dangle is almost equal to the width.
2.0,"I am a sucker for grab bags and other mystery type purchases.<br />Accordingly, this three piece random clothes offering piqued my interest.<br /><br />While the black and white color scheme of the three articles of clothing I received are all perfect for me, that's where the good news ended for me.<br />First, I would say these clothes are all two sizes smaller than their tags indicate.<br />Second, you have to be comfortable with very racy styles to enjoy the tops; one being a crop top and the other being a cropped tank top with straps you are meant to tie around your waist.<br />Third, while the quality is not great, it is what you would expect from items that come out to $4.33 per piece.<br /><br />The care tags are all identical; however, in the case of the skirt, I do not believe that it is accurate.<br />While both tops have the feel of cotton blends, the skirt feels like it is polyester with no cotton.<br /><br />If you are going to order this trio of mystery clothes, you are doing it for the entertainment value.<br />Still, that will only be fun if you can actually get the clothing on, which is doubtful if you order your size.<br />I would order two sizes up, which means these are only going to work for women who wear a small and girls.<br />Honestly, if the sizes were anywhere close to correct this would be worth the modest price tag, but as it stands, the incorrect sizing and somewhat immodest styles limit the appeal of this offering."
2.0,These fit a little on the small side and are made with poor quality materials.  Mine ripped playing volleyball.
2.0,Had to return. Construction of the slipper fine but the size was huge & they tripped me every time I tried to walk. Really hated it because I cannot seem to find a reasonably priced FLAT-NO Memory Foam slipper. Don't know about others but memory foam throws me off balance & have twisted my ankle twice. Will just keep looking.
2.0,"I'm 6'3"".  I typically wear XL. I bought this in XL and it was short in the sleeves, tight in the shoulders, and it barely tucked in. I returned it for a XXL. That one was exactly the same, but even shorter. Couldn't even tuck it in. I sent the XXL back, too. These shirts will be fine if you're slim and under 5'10""."
2.0,The clips on this chain destroyed the outer plastic cover on my sunglasses.  The outer plastic cover peeled off from the sides of the glasses where the chain was clipped.  Also the chain is uncomfortable around the back of the neck.  The chain cannot be adjusted for length.  I do not recommend this item.
2.0,"I knew that this wasn't going to be of lower quality being so cheap as it is, and honestly I was OK with that. But I bought 2 rings and neither of them had their stone set even close to correctly. The first ring had the stone set at a angle, you can see it in my pic above, where the top of the stone looked like it fit well, but the bottom didnt even reach the ""clasps"" that are are made to look like its holding the stone in place. Its a little hard to see but there is also a gap on the front facing side of the stone where you can peer through it. The second one had a massive gap on the side which you can easily see through.<br />Giving a 2 star instead of a 1 due to speed customer service response, and ring size fit as desired. However, I won't be buying again."
2.0,AMAZAN PLUS GIRLS....THIS XXL IS REALLY A SIZE LARGE.  THE BUST SIZE IS ABOUT 36B. AND WAIST ABOUT 32 INCHES.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM HEM IS NOT SEWN CORRECTLY.  THIS STYLE ALLOWS VIEWERS TO SEE HEM IS DEFECTIVELY SEWN.<br /><br />TO BAD THE STYLE IS GREAT.  ALSO THE FABRIC IS LIKE WEARING A HEAVY POLYESTER COAT.
2.0,dont like this on me
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:d1179f7a225328853930780765984d48]] Opened the plastic packages and socks had a really bad smell. As I took off the tags, I found out why. Mold."
2.0,This fits about a half to a whole size too big.
2.0,Super cute but did not last. After one wash the lettering really faded.
2.0,This should be listed as a CROP long sleeve hoodie. It does run small through the shoulders but it is extremely short!!!!!
2.0,"Though they look cool, not ideal or practical. They run small, have a very narrow footprint and have absolutely no foot or ankle support. Which is both surprising and appalling considering they are boots. Would not recommend to any buyers."
2.0,"I am a big fan of the Nora Twips sleepwear. This was my first purchase of “silk” pjs from the brand and I am very disappointed. The fit is odd, the color is blah, and the fabric is bad! I own 4 other Pajama items in this brand and I’ve ordered the same size for each. This is the first time it’s been too small. The other ones I’ve ordered bordered on too large, but I like that in pjs. The shirt with this set was too big in my shoulders and too small in the hips. The pink color is very sad and unflattering, at least on my somewhat fair skin tone. Lastly, and most importantly, this fabric is not good. I thought it would be light and soft, instead it’s very stiff, thick, and rough. Returning this ASAP."
2.0,The straps on the top feel like they've been stretched out. 2 of the straps are adjustable the others just hang there like they were stretched and broke the elastic in them.
2.0,Absolutely beautiful anklet but incredibly cheap and poor quality.  It broke a day after I bought it. I kept trying to fix the broken link to keep wearing it but then another link would break. It was lost/gone 2 days after purchase.  I should have expected as such given the cheap price though.
2.0,"No Compression just like it's counterpart, the Compression Athletic Workout Shorts.  The tops are too thin and should have an inner bra for some support.  Very disappointing."
2.0,This is actually a very pretty ring but it believe me this is not a silver ring it's already tarnished and turning copper so I'm very disappointed that it says that it's silver but it's not 😢
2.0,Not only small it just wasn't what I anticipated it to be
2.0,It was too thin and not what I wanted
2.0,I almost always fit in Columbia pants but these pants were too small and not cut right for my body
2.0,"This is a lovely shirt, it is very pretty but is more a box cut then A line.  I tried it on when it arrived and I really liked it, it wasn't a super loose fit like the model but it looked nice.  So then I washed it...cold wash, hang to air dry, just as you are supposed to.  Put it on this morning and it has SHRUNK about one size!  So now it is too tight at the hip area.  I am so disappointed as now I am stuck with it as I have washed it."
2.0,WAY to big and hard to change size in my opinion. so I am not using it.
2.0,"Runs small so I took one size larger.  I had to return my regular size for the larger size, and they were still too small.  So I had to return them again.  I did not re-purchase them."
2.0,To big and had a smell to it.
2.0,"I loved this when it arrived. Then I put it on the watch. It's really cute! It's easy to get the watch on and off with a quick rip of velcro! That's where my good comments end. The ends that hook into the watch are plastic. The band was pretty easy to install onto the watch. Then: One end kept coming off. I kept putting it back on. Then I decided I'd had it and needed to return it. And I couldn't get the other end off! It was completely stuck. This is not worth the money. Of course, Google is charging $60 for their bands, so that's outrageous. I would like a reasonably priced band that does the job. This wasn't it."
2.0,"The elastic at the wrist is not covered so you can just see 4 white elastic bands that are very noticeable and do not match the rest of the dress. The cups in the dress are also too small for the slots and since they are a different color from the dress, and its not lined, it looks very cheap.<br /><br />May be good as a Halloween costume but nothing fancy."
2.0,Sleeves too shorr
2.0,Wife didnt enjoy the look and she said it hurt when it was even the best she could get it to fit. Not that sturdy either. Decent product for a watch...
2.0,Fits big around bust area in width. It's also see thru. It's cheap material
2.0,"Cute dress. The problems I had with it were that it was transparent and way shorter than on the picture. The designs on the bottom were on my butt, but otherwise it fit perfectly everywhere else. I was really bummed I couldn't wear it."
2.0,"Laughably large. May fit when she's 3 or 4. Definitely not high quality, but cute."
2.0,"They don't seems brand new at all like said, they look faded and if you pull on the edges a little bit it's rips off. Not happy with them"
2.0,"Uncomfortable elastic waste line and its short, goes just under the bra line."
2.0,Tight and small
2.0,"I wanted to like the dress so much but it was too big (I ordered a medium and usually wear small or medium). I had gotten the dress based on some reviews that it can be good for nursing. However, the top part was not as stretchy as I thought it would be. So if the dress had fit better (in other words, been tighter) it would be even more difficult to pull down to nurse."
2.0,Cute belts. Love the woven pattern. But my very arthritic hands struggled with the loops to buckle.
2.0,Don’t like the band at all.
2.0,"These shoes must be seconds, because they have flaws in them."
2.0,"Color,and size and style was very nice. Very light weight for the size also. Would have given them 5 stars but the horseshoe part of the clip was defective. Can’t be worn"
2.0,Smaller than expected and the blue on Navi comes off too easy for it to be from Bioworld company:/
2.0,I found this mask to be too tight.
2.0,Too large and shiny
2.0,It’s a great casual dress. I was a bit taken off because it has like pink? I’m not a fan of pink and I’m confuse why would you put black and pink together?
2.0,Fits very very small!! It was a tight fitting shirt. If you want loose you would have to size up like 4 sizes!
2.0,These are thin and don’t have tummy control
2.0,"These took so long to arrive that I forgot I even ordered them. They're nice enough, but stretch out rather badly."
2.0,"the pendant is beautiful, but my chain came in the mail broken. this was supposed to be a christmas gift for my partner and now i have to figure out what to do. very disappointed."
2.0,Far too small. I got an extra large and I would be surprised if it fit a chihuahua. Also the material was super thin
2.0,"I noticed there was a split seam on the ""brim"" of the hat. The wool material appears to be good quality but workmanship and stitching is very poor. If you buy this expect to have to sew up any holes before you can wear it."
2.0,Super cute but it broke already 😢
2.0,The material is good but the size is not correct. I ordered 8 shirts from different vendors and they all fit me right except this one shirt I ordered from this specific vendor. I will take the loss 😡
2.0,"The glass is durable, but the size I ordered was for a LG K7 and it's too small, doesn't cover the whole screen."
2.0,I wear a size ten and a lot of times I wear a size eleven to have room. These boots are a bit small. I gave them to a coworker and she wears 8.5-9 and fit perfectly. The shoes are beautiful btw.
2.0,I give this wig a two star rating because it was not curled the way it was in the picture. It gets two stars because it was blonde and a wig.
2.0,The quality of the jersey is awesome and even the MANNING name…but the numbers were low budget iron ons. Kinda sad
2.0,I am 38 D and usually wear XL which is what I bought but this shirt runs small
2.0,I did photoshoot for newborn. Price is good for me. But dress’s rubber too tight for infant babies. I didnt wear this dress on my baby. I just put this on her tummy for photoshoot.
2.0,The color was not pretty it said Brown it's mush more red then brown. I was expecting a more chocolate color I have to dye it to have a more flattering color
2.0,Beautifully soft and well made but they run small. Order a size up for sure!
2.0,I ordered according to size chart and this dress was huge on me. I ordered a large and should've ordered a medium.  It's also see through
2.0,"Every single pair of these fits way different.<br />Laying them on a pile, they all look like different sizes.<br />BUT..... They're really really comfortable so I don't care!"
2.0,I ordered a 2x and it fitted like a large I'm very dissatisfied
2.0,"Jersey material really annoying to workout in feels uncomfortable, don't recommend."
2.0,"The Band Is Very very short, I'm lucky that I have a small wrist, I can barley remove it with out unlooping it, also the bracelet is very small and sharp, I dont know if itll break if stretched open."
2.0,Not what I was expecting. They so small and not pretty.
2.0,Was missing the bag and jewelry.  But had it all been there I’m sure we would have kept it.
2.0,"These headbands from China are pretty thin, despite how they look in the photos.  They won't absorb a lot of sweat so you'll have to wring them out often.  The best I've found is the GoGo brand, which are thicker and very well made, and are also carried by Amazon.  Several vendors sell them on Amazon so be sure to choose the one with the lowest shipping charge.  One charges more for shipping than the headband itself!"
2.0,Lensess too dark
2.0,I love the look but i ordered a size large so they would be baggy and they fit like a med. They are not super soft on the inside like most sweats when you first buy them. They also came with a big gap in the seem of my leg.
2.0,"Ordered bracelet based on appearance in photo, wanted multi colored marble however bracelet was only 1 color"
2.0,"Eh.  Nice dress but I didn't care for the look.  I'm 5&#34;1', 150 lbs and ordered an XXL.  It was too big but even if it fit I wouldn't keep it.  I still like Homeyee dresses and will buy from them in the future."
2.0,"Dress was ok but fit WAY too small!  Order up at the very least, two sizes."
2.0,The ashier runs small . I ordered a up and it Still was small and tight . Very disappointed
2.0,"These sock are a bit smaller than expected as well as there color being dull and not the viberant look i was expecting, as posted in the picture...."
2.0,my employees went crazy and refused to wear.. they think these are super duper ugly dont buy for hairdressers.. not a one out of 7 will be caught dead.
2.0,"Very small. Arms were too small, for weird over the boob region. I would size up 2 or three sizes if possible. I know you probably have hope it’ll fit, but just save your money and don’t buy it if you can’t size up AT LEAST two sizes."
2.0,"Quality seems ok, a bit thinner fleece than I expected, but I got the wrong size and color..."
2.0,3d effect not even close to picture. I think they photoshopped picture
2.0,"Material very cheap, arms too tight, dress fits nice though."
2.0,"Good for only once in awhile otherwise if you’re like me you will begin to look like Shrek, turns the neck green. Looks great just not good for summer wedding sweat."
2.0,"I was very excited when I discovered this here, and super disappointed that this did not fit my wedding shoes. My heels were about 5"" because I'm pretty short and my husband is extremely tall (we're nearly a foot apart!), and we had an outdoor wedding. This was useless to me.<br /><br />I was more disappointed I found the same exact product at Off Broadway shoes in Hollywood, CA, for LESS! I could have saved the hassle of S&H fees AND actually return them. Maybe one day it will come in handy... that's why they get 2 stars."
2.0,Tore apart on first use.
2.0,"Didn't fit right as expected it doesn't look very crooked (the hem, a style) but it was really retarded looking like it ws simply put on wrong, twisted."
2.0,Why does not illuminate entire screen I fear this watch over the months will begin the chip is slowly breakaway die do you like it small structure
2.0,"If you have any shape, curves, bust, or in general are not built like kate moss, by pass this shirt. It's not made for non-sticks.  I'm a size 6, but DD bust.  It's almost like it's cut for a little girl, not grown woman.  So unless you want it to hang weirdly in some spots, fit in some places, and stick to you around the upper arms, oh and give up the shoulder seam ever feeling like it fits correctly....yeah, just skip this one. even buying bigger size wouldn't have helped. the garmet is a bad cut/construction for average+ frame."
2.0,Did not fit my face at all. Also the lens smeared up in 1 day. I returned theaw
2.0,Very pretty but way too large for Evan an adult to wear
2.0,Bad cut
2.0,"The gloves did not fit, hard to understand how these fit individuals with larger hands of longer fingers"
2.0,Never dropped my phone yet started cracking after only 4 months do to stress put on by case! Had better believe it may be due to curves.
2.0,Washed it one time and the pouch that holds the filter is already coming loose.  Great design.
2.0,"I ordered a XXL, it fitted like a Large.<br /><br />I returned both pairs at Kohl’s and was only refunded for one pair!"
2.0,To see through
2.0,Straight from China. Looks nothing like this.
2.0,This dress was really see-through and cheap material. I gave it to my friend and she only wore it once.
2.0,Very poor quality. It was not supportive fabric at all.
2.0,Got this for my 5 year old as a stocking stuffer. Cheap stuff but still pretty. Mailinv was a nightmare.
2.0,the elastic unraveled upon washing
2.0,"So, this thing truly is sheer....I seen that in the description but wasn't aware how sheer. The only parts not exposed on this dress are the vag and the crack!  I'm kind of old school and believe in leaving some things to the imagination, so I had to return it."
2.0,"The dress is Ok, but not what I expected!!"
2.0,"Visually, this product is beautiful, the perfect size for a tragus or helix piercing. The flower itself looks well made and high quality. However after wearing this earring for a few hours I noticed my tragus was swollen. I figured that it was most likely irritation from changing out the earring (anyone with a tragus piercing can attest to how tricky they can be to put in). However over the course of a few days I noticed that the swelling wasn’t going down and my ear was sore to the touch.<br />I double checked the item description of this product and noticed it is advertised as “steel” & “stainless steel”. After doing some research about what metals are typically best for piercings, I learned that not all stainless steel is actually suitable for use on the body. Many times stainless steel can be mixed with other metals like nickel.<br />Thankfully the flower portion of the earring was able to screw on perfectly onto the rod/ base portion of the original earring that was placed in when I got my piercing done at a shop.<br />So, if you have sensitive ears, this product isn’t for you.<br />I’m giving 2 stars because I loved the flower portion so much and was happy that I was able to make it work with the rod of another earring. Otherwise I’d be giving zero stars."
2.0,I can wear it but NOT as a dress. It is too short and I'm only 5'0' I will have to put shirts or tights on 🙄
2.0,"The first pairs of these a stone fell out of one of the earrings in like 2 weeks. I returned for a replacement. They were very fast and easy to deal with. I tend not to take my earrings out but I did the other day and I found that the side of one of the earrings (again one of the hopes with the stones it) is totally rusted, again after a few weeks. I thought I was getting sterling silver but clearly it's not. I have been wearing a sterling ring on my thumb for 20 years, I don't think it will even come off at this point and I've never experienced rust on it. Same with the captured ball hoop I wear at the top of my ear. So while I was initially very pleased because they are cute, easy to put on and stay in, I am ultimately very disappointed with this purchase and I do not recommend."
2.0,So wrinkly and impossible to iron!!
2.0,"I should have taken a picture of my Mother when she put on the jacket/more like a shirt, it was not what was shown in the picture where it shown the length to be below the waist 6-8 inches (more like waist line)! It fit her fine ""shoulder & arm length"" but I could tell in her looks that it wasn't what she hoped for on the length of the jacket!(even though she told me she liked it) I was very disappointed with this purchase that the pictures used in the advertisement was very deceiving (length of jacket was NOT as pictured) Sadly, I will never again purchase from this seller."
2.0,a bit cheap looking . nice for halloween outfit sprucing. Other than that its just ok.
2.0,Just received my keychain.  There are scratches all over the charm.  The Volkswagen logo isn’t centered and looks like it will chip away easily.  It really only deserves one star.  I gave the second because I like the idea.  It just needs to be better.
2.0,We purchased xl and fits like a medium
2.0,"I got these for my daughter as undershirts. Loved the colors, but they are VERY cheaply made. I bought them back in May and can't return them now, but several have frayed or unraveled at the neck line over the last couple of months."
2.0,They came chipped - so I couldn’t wear them
2.0,Fit me like a maternity shirt
2.0,This doesn't not run to the size specs given at the time of order.
2.0,"I’m so disappointed by these mask since after one use, the filter came apart. They were hand washed. And line dry."
2.0,"I would've loved the dress, but it's way too small and I waited too long to try it on after I received it. Therefore I'm out the cost. The fabric is lovely however."
2.0,If you are wearing this because you have no hair and your very fair-skinned...think again. It looked horrible on me.<br /><br />I looked like I was in a biker gang (at age 55).<br /><br />Younger women may look better in it.
2.0,"Somewhat smaller than the size I bought would have been. I believe the measurement was wrong. Again the zip is on the left hand side, Why?"
2.0,"me gusta, solo q se desbarata muy rápido los nudos para ajustar.."
2.0,Didn't hold well
2.0,I bought a size that usually fits me oversized but it fit kinda snug and not how i expected. ever since then it has been in my trunk bc I don’t know what to do with it and it’s not that cute anymore. do not buy if ur a plus sized queen!!
2.0,"Here is your problem, you will have to take the band to a professional watchmaker/band repairman for placing and adjusting this band to your wrist. I tried to cut it however I then could not mount it to the clasp afterwards. I wasted one day with this issue. I then had to take it downtown to a professional with tools who charged me twenty bucks for repair and mounting. There is no mention of the difficulty of adjusting this band to your size. None. No instructions for shortening the band as well. You are on your own. After getting a pro to adjust it correctly, it is a sharp band from all viewpoints."
2.0,Looks great until it’s wet. It’s completely see through.
2.0,"Poor quality and fit like a potato sack. I'm curiver than the model in the picture. i thought it looked very cute on her, but just didn't flatter my body type"
2.0,before the lens cracked and chipped. And I kept these in a HARD case. So much for quality...
2.0,Colors were more dull in person. The black wasn’t a true black so I returned.
2.0,"The shirt fit true to size, however the color was way off and it appeared to be drab.  I returned it not interested in the shirt, very unflattering look"
2.0,XLT is more like a medium
2.0,"I love the color and style of this band.  However, it’s poorly designed for a 40mm Apple Watch.  The band is too wide and loose at the connection point, which makes it appear cheap and ill-fitting. And even worse, it definitely gives the impression that the watch is not securely attached."
2.0,"I dont even know how I am supposed toput this shirt on. There is no give or sttetch to the bottom of the shirt to even put it on. No clasp or other opening, just sttaight stiff fabric. Too bad because i love everything else about the shirt"
2.0,Material is very thin and cheap but it works.
2.0,Bought a medium and had to return for a large. Bought a large and it fits like the medium. Ugh. I wear a 6-8 in pants and dresses depending on the brand and material. ...Ladies if you are just not skinny in the waist or rib area (busty or just have a more robust build) I'd suggest going two sizes up what you normally wear to be comfortable. Can't sit in this skirt because it feels like it's constricting my ribs and lungs.
2.0,I bought this simply for the case. My 3 year old got prescription glasses and I needed a case she would love. The sunglasses were just a bonus. I'm pretty disappointed with the condition the case arrived in. A lot of imperfections just from handling prior to being shipped to me. Sunglasses are cute.
2.0,"Cheap, got what I paid for it.  Lost it first time I wore it."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:327ca202d872de9d299ca0b9d874b418]] As you can see, this ""100% cotton"" (?) Linen shirt was washed by hand from a blood stain.  Results?  the stain came out, but it left me a shirt ruined by the dye that released the button of the shirt .... unheard of!  What rating would you give to a product that can't even stand a wash without staining how it is?  Let's see what the producers of this misleading advertising do.  Because linen is linen.  And cotton is something else<br /><br />Como se puede ver, esta camisa de lino y “100% algodón”(?) se destiñó al lavarla a mano de una mancha de sangre. Resultados? la mancha salió, pero me dejo una camisa arruinada por el tinte que soltó el botón de la camisa.... inaudito! Que calificación le darían a un producto que ni siquiera soporta una lavada sin que manche cómo está? A ver qué hacen los productores de esta publicidad engañosa. Porque lino es lino. Y algodón, es otra cosa"
2.0,"I had to return this earrings, they were ok, but too small"
2.0,"When ordering this, I didn't know that the one apron would have words on it that I don't approve of. The picture in the ""ad"" only say this is going to be delicious, not what it came saying.  Not appropriate!"
2.0,Fit is weird and material is stiff. This product is overrated. Will be returning.
2.0,the apron itself is very small and the &#34;lace&#34; edging is very cheap looking.
2.0,DID NOT LIKE THE MATERIAL.
2.0,Love this bracelet and love the charm. But the bangle itself is not great. You get what you pay for so don't expect it to be similar quality to an alex&Ani bracelet.
2.0,Not shaped to body. Very poor quality
2.0,I sized up because the reviews said they run small and well guess what? Those are even small! I’m usually a size 9 and I ordered the 10/11 size and they’re small. Very disappointing. The look and color were so cute too.
2.0,these were way smaller than i was expecting
2.0,Came looking like cheetah print
2.0,"The sewing wasn't great. It tore in two locations, the cuff and bottom of the zipper. Also, the cuffs weren't long enough."
2.0,Too thin and flimsy not fitted around garment
2.0,Nice boot but runs a whole size smaller.
2.0,"the photos don't show you the back, which is not like a pin or a button. it's like, two long metal bars, that i guess are meant to be somehow wrapped around clothing? i really dont see how"
2.0,The shirt looks nice- but the material it's made of is shockingly thin-and they don't include collar tabs in the collar of the shirt-  thus giving it an unkempt look.  very disappointed for a $40 shirt
2.0,I just got this set in the mail. Not pleased with it. It is not rose gold..it is yellow gold. Bought specifically for the rose gold so I am sad!
2.0,"Overall satisfied. Cute design. However I was a little disappointed in the quality of the strap. Very thin weak material. It survived one trip on airplane, so we shall see how it hold up."
2.0,Watch band broke after 2 months of use. It looks nice though.
2.0,Definitely not true to size!!!
2.0,way too small and the hooks for the straps are so big that they continue to fall out of the hook so your left with one strap and the other one waving in the breeze.  Also colors are way brighter and not as attractive as shown on the computer.
2.0,Cool shirt. Just runs really really small
2.0,"This dress would be nice on someone with curves and not a larger middle. The fabric is thin and the pattern gets stretch. The dress looks great in the photo, but it didn't look good on me. I will be sending it back."
2.0,Took forever to get it. The gold turned dark after a week. Not worth buying.
2.0,"Does not work for us at all, very hard to use, cape kept moving and the black strings are in the way, very clumsy even for short hair.  If your kids have long hair, forget about this product."
2.0,I used it and had no push up in it but dang the design was so so pretty
2.0,"Not durable. Already had a hole after one use!<br />Comfortable.<br />As it is not durable, it is not good value for money.<br />Can this be refunded?"
2.0,Very small and does not put out significant light.  Disappointing
2.0,Run very small and narrow in the toe box.
2.0,It broke in one day. I was sad because it is really quite lovely!
2.0,"It is off-white or beige in color, not white. The fabric is very thin and transparent, and the arms are basically a size medium...definitely not 2X. I always buy my tops bigger because I'm smaller on my upper half and I don't like my shirts to cling to my hips. In this case, the bottom part is okay...not a 2x, but not clingy. But the top is way too small to be 2x. It also took forever to be delivered. Just overall disappointing. Will not buy from them again."
2.0,This tank top feels great..but I received a different shirt then the one that is shown on the advertisement. But its comfy
2.0,The color is a bit lighter than the real Cookie Monster. They eyes are very small and the mouth is not as dark & big as the picture shows. I did have to add some felt to the black of the eyes and the mouth (above the see through black) to make it look bigger as well. First picture is as it was. Second is after my changes.
2.0,"I loved this jacket online and I got it just in time to wear to the World Series, game 4. Problem was, it didn't fit. The length was very short, so whenever I raised my arms, my midriff was exposed. Also the sleeves were just barely to my wrists. I had ordered a Medium, which was sized 8-10. I am only a 4-6 and yet the jacket was still too small. Sadly, I had to return it and never had a jacket to wear to the game."
2.0,"I put too small because the bottom part is basically a thong because of how small it is height wise, but then the top is extremely loose."
2.0,"I ordered these slippers in a size too big, they were still too small for my daughter."
2.0,Cheap fabric. Weird fit. Unattractive.
2.0,"Fits nice but the gold color is not really gold. It's an ugly yellowish fake off gold color. Disappointed because I was really looking forward to this swimming suit.  Other than that color, I really love the suit.  I'm not sure what I want to do with it."
2.0,"This dress is see through. No liner, nothing. Just paper thin, scratchy fabric that shows everything. I purchased the pink so maybe a darker color would be better? It’s a really pretty style, just wish it wasn’t so thin."
2.0,does not keep thehand warm in the freezer and battery died too fast
2.0,First off i just want to say this thing smelled awful out of the package ! Like it had been stored in a old wet basement. Must Wash  b4 you wear it !!!!  Runs small but good quality  .
2.0,Iwas really excited for this necklace to come. The package came over  2 weeks after placing the order. It was in a plastic wrapped in bubble wrap. I'm giving it two stars because the necklace itself doesn't sit well and has to be adjusted and fixed every minute. Its not as pretty on either and it looks cheap.... I hate it. wish I had gone with another necklace.
2.0,"Quality slipper, but too large an opening for anyone with a narrow heel."
2.0,"Weird fabric. Like double thick compression stockings. I’m sure it would snag easily. I got them on once, Fabric thick, itchy, hot. Very uncomfortable ( more than the usual discomfort of compression stockings.) Took them off immediately, returned them."
2.0,"The color is nice, but it was so skin tight I looked like a sausage.  I returned it because it wasn't worth the $."
2.0,This runs small I ordered my normal size and is way too tight
2.0,crown way to big
2.0,I was disappointed to discover that these don't stay on the foot any better than any other ones I've tried.
2.0,"Got the Large and it didnt even fit comfortably; I have average legs and wear a size 10 in pants, im disappointed based on all the positive reviews that are on here..."
2.0,Only had this band a month or less and already falling apart. Cute but not durable.
2.0,Too small - had to return it
2.0,Broke the second time i wore them.
2.0,Picture shows an infant wearing the hat and reviewers said that it fit a baby. No this hat is huge. Its a hare to small for my adult head. Hat will get packed away for quite some time
2.0,Looks super awkward on. I don’t recommend this shirt. The think elastic band at the bottom makes it fit weird.
2.0,Kudo's to those that can get this dress to fit correctly!  The neckline comes way too low and your entire chest is exposed!  I tried pinning it but it looked and just felt awkward!  I will pass.
2.0,Way too tight.  My legs not even that wide
2.0,"Falls off ears, wasted money"
2.0,"Runs very, very small. My daughter is a size us 7 and I followed the exact measurement and they were like a size us 5. Order 2 sizes up.<br /><br />The material of the shoe is very nice. I’m not sure how they would work for the water but my guess they would work well for children."
2.0,"The positive is that the 31 inch inseem was long enough to slightly bunch at the ankles which is great and I'm 5'8. Unfortunately, they  are somewhat thin, cheap  fabric and there was a dark line in the fabric across one knee. Returned them. Might be ok if you wanted them for casual wear with a long shirt, not office appropriate unless it's a very casual office."
2.0,Liked the original design but way too long - i am 5'7&#34; and it drags significantly on the ground.
2.0,Its not veru sturdy. Tried it on for the 1st time since i got it and the heel was starting to bend. Its very stylish but not very strong
2.0,"I purchased this in my normal size, but it was way to small."
2.0,"Poor fit on a Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Sapphire.  It is a little narrow and slides a bit on the pins.  Also, the fit on the pins does not feel like a solid tight hold.  Makes me think the band will unsnap, which is not a good thing!  Also, the band is extremely stiff and doesn’t feel good on the wrist.  I do not recommend this band at all and certainly not for $25."
2.0,Too much fur felling off the cloth and too small
2.0,"I really liked the fabric and how these shorts are made, but they are way too small.  I usually wear a 14/16 or XL and they were very tight around the waist.  Disappointed in this."
2.0,The. Pin. Of. Buckle. Fell off. And. Got. Lost.<br />So I. Can't. Wezr. It. Anymore!. I. Mean the red. Belt. Of. The red faced watch.Thanks.
2.0,"I was given this as a christmas present. The pendant itself is beautiful but, after only wearing it a couple of times, the rose gold is coming off of it. And just yesterday, the chain broke! Thankfully  the necklace somehow stayed partially on and I didnt lose the pendant! Im going to see about buying a better chain for it but disappointed that the color is already rubbing off!"
2.0,"The item arrived in about a week.  The box was made of flimsy wooden panels. The briefcase latch was not properly screwed in. The upper latch fell off right away. The lower latch was misaligned. Oversized brushes were nice to hold, but shed too much. The shoeshine clothes did not have the &#34;Made in Italy&#34; stamp that was shown on their picture. The shoe polishes, made in U.S., were decent.<br /><br />I wanted to return the item. But, realized too late that I would have to repack, drive to USPS, and pay the postage myself. At any rate, a return seemed like an admission of failure on my part.  So, I took out my tool box. Drilled new holes and re-screwed the latches with bigger screws.  At present, I am trying to get into a trance.  Trying to hypnotize myself that I have a brand new shoeshine box."
2.0,"Not happy with the fact that I got the wrong dress. Also, the dress is a little too snug. Might need the next size up. The length is okay but it does not fit like a body con dress should. Overall unhappy with the purchase. Hope to get the correct dress soon!!!"
2.0,bought this for a costume party for my fiance and he wore it for maybe 10 minutes he said it hurt his face and kept slipping.
2.0,"I was all excited because this is a good price for the leather necklace but when I received it, it was just too stiff and thick that it didn't look good with any of the enhancers I had bought. It didn't even look good on by itself.<br /><br />The bails are also super huge so I would never be able to wear it with any other pendant so I returned it. I gave it two stars because the material is worth the price and it is sturdy but its not a great design."
2.0,I bought it as a gift for my wife. Its her watch and I think its to large for her wrist. She likes the watch but hasn't warn it very much. It is a unisex design. I find its on the thick side for a Swatch watch and is very loud. The ticketing can be heard across a room. It doesn't stay in the bedroom  and currently resides in the medicine cabinet in the bathroom.
2.0,Absolutely as gorgeous as you see on your screen. However they broke the first time I wore them period I was so sad because they are really beautiful.
2.0,Very cute and comfortable but one tie was very uncomfortable and tight on the foit
2.0,"Comes from China, sizes waaaay too small! Grrrr!"
2.0,Would not recommend this.
2.0,"Bought this shirt a few days ago, arrived yesterday.  My first impression thru the bag was how bright and crisp the pattern on the shirt was.  But after removing it from the bag and holding up the shirt, my first good impressions faded away.  The printed pattern was only on the outside of the shirt and white on the inside.  It looked unfinished.  Every shirt I've owned of this type (bowling shirt or aloha style) was a print throughout the fabric, or a weave, and usually made from an airy rayon or cotton or a cotton blend. This shirt is not airy or billowy in the comfortable way you'd expect.  It feels smothering to wear.<br /><br />The shirt is mediumweight and plasticky with a slight sheen, like those printed outdoor flags for the home, and not the type of fabric you'd wear against your skin. The 95% polyester fabric has a very tight weave.  It's more like a surface fabric than a clothing fabric.  And it's NOT breathable at all.  I tried blowing into the shirt to test its breathability, and not a breath came thru on the other side.<br /><br />The size fits as expected (XXL for loose fit), but it feels like wearing plastic.<br /><br />My suggestion is to buy something a little more expensive made of anything but printed polyester.  Check out this link on Amazon.  Currently in my cart for purchase @ $25.99.  It's a cotton/viscose blend.  Viscose for a silky drape.  Cotton for breathability and durability.  Nice patterns that look like they'll wash and age well.<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B099PRJT7Q/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A60375D51PSXW&th=1&psc=1"
2.0,"They’re cute, but one of the jackets had no holes so I couldn’t wear one. They’re cute, so that was really disappointing. The seller is also very hard to get in contact with. They told me to email them, but didn’t provide an email or phone number. I tried to tell them but they wouldn’t listen. Very disappointed. Seller was the big issue since I couldn’t return them and get a new pair."
2.0,Very thin material. I'm fairly thin but this made me look like a busted can of biscuits. I donated it to good will.
2.0,"I really wanted to like these. I got them at a great price. They came in a wonderful eyeglass case, with another soft-side pouch and a cleaning cloth. But they looked terrible on; they were crooked on my face (that bar across the top leaves no doubt when they're not straight) and there was no curve to the lenses at all; they were practically flat. Also, one of the little screws on the earpiece caught in my hair every.single.time I tried to take them off and ripped out my hair. They'll be my back-up pair only. I'm quite disappointed."
2.0,"The material stiff and not at all comfy ,"
2.0,It was too small to fit around my ankle. Its sized more for a child. Gave it to my daughter and one bell has fallen off each day just from her moving around.
2.0,This fabric is virtually see-through and VERY clingy. I was hoping it would be billowy and float away from the body as pictured. It is very cheaply made. The fabric is so thin that it dulls the color of the dress!
2.0,"I ordered the largest I could get which should have allowed some room and shouldn't have been tight.  I couldn't even get the shirt on and gave it to my Wife. Don't believe the size chart, these were made for tiny people."
2.0,"I usually wear a 3x in shirts and a 22 in pants and I got a 3x in this dress and it was very big but really small at the bottom at the feet, I’m 5’7 and it was above my ankles :(  so I aould advise anyone to get a size smaller but be prepared for it to be above your ankles"
2.0,The locking mechanism broke after about 3 wears. Not worth the cost of repair. A short lived experience buying fashion Jewelry. I’ll pay for the good stuff.
2.0,"The material on this is a very heavy almost shiny material. I loved the design, but the  execution of the design was off. I had to send it back. The very top is build small and there is a tents worth of material after that."
2.0,Disappointed due to button holes... should have sent it back. 😕
2.0,Some elements of the complication don't even work. Very weird watch...
2.0,"I bought this as a gift for someone, and the mask itself is cool. The only bummer is that it came with a rip in it, right out of the box.."
2.0,The material is a little wierd. No inner lining
2.0,Very tiny… look to cheap for price!
2.0,Clasp already broke and shoes barely worn. It's plastic.
2.0,"They look pink in the picture but in reality the tint looks more yellow than pink. On top of that, one of the hinges already broke within a week! What a waste of money!"
2.0,They stretched out at the heel and I can no longer wear them
2.0,"Loved visibility and style, hated that they broke twice in first week and ultimately were unrepairable after plastic snapped where arm attached."
2.0,Not a perfect fit
2.0,Heavier and larger than I thought. My husband thought the were diving bells and my coworkers thought they were skulls. Neither look I was going for.
2.0,"Not to rain on anyone's parade, but there's a big design problem with this otherwise pretty pendant/enhancer. I was able to buy it at a HUGE discount, and when it arrived, I noticed that the leather backing is glued to the metal. Since jewelry from this line tarnishes regularly (even in protected storage with anti-tarnish strips), especially mixed metal pieces, cleaning off the tarnish would pose a significant problem. There's really no way to clean the piece without damaging the leather. If it got damp/wet in any way, it would be ruined. Normally I love American West and Carolyn Pollack jewelry, but even at a low, low price, I felt I had to return this item."
2.0,"As said before in another review, (but I bought them anyways) the material is like a thin fake cheap wanna be felty suede. Slipper material on the top of the boot the toe area seems a little bit more sturdy and thicker. For the price of $40 not worth it. My mistake I should have listened to the previous review. Cute style wish it would have worked as I wanted the comfort of my UGG's with a heel to it. There is no fur lined on the bottom of your foot either it is just on the sides."
2.0,I bought the shirt because it said it was cool and breathed. I was looking forward to using it on my deep-sea fishing trip. By the time we were out I was sweating and felt like it was in a rain coat (no air flow). The material was nothing like I expected.<br /><br />The buttons wouldn’t even work without double unhooking (the cheap stitching got caught around the button). I would not recommend for any outdoor use.
2.0,Was as described but front pocket does not stay latched otherwise ok..
2.0,Went size bigger still too small..really cute though
2.0,polyester and cheap.
2.0,Size guide is really wrong. It ended up giving it to my 10 year old.
2.0,"I  returned this top. I like the colors, but it looked like a maternity dress on me. I was hoping to wear with leggings and boots for fall winter. I’m 5’3, 115 pounds and a size small was just too baggy and loose on me."
2.0,Supper wide and awkward on your face
2.0,Low quality fabric
2.0,"It is plastic, not hand-crocheted! Worth the money you spend, but not to last.  Beautiful design, but can't wear more than one time."
2.0,Okay. Wasn't that flattering
2.0,The chain and hook is incredibly short while the necklace is stiff making it hard to clasp it. Very bright and shiny and was a hit. The middle size seem to be the most comfy as opposed to the big one
2.0,"I bought these for wearing with strapless outfits. Being short, pleasingly plump, and well-endowed, I purchased a couple sizes over what I thought I would normally buy. My experience has been that most bras are tight on me when I buy one that would be the same equivalent in my clothes size. Even a smaller size would have worked well, and the bra is comfortable. I wear it with loosely fitting outfits though because despite the size, the removable pads are just tiny disks that move all over the place, and they are quite prominent when wearing something clingy. There is a large pocket built in for them, so I guess the large pockets exist so that you can get your hands in there to keep putting them back in place. If the company would provide a pad that fits the pocket, it would have received a better rating from me."
2.0,Didn't like this. The top part was not made correctly which kinda looks uncomfortable.
2.0,"These gloves are thick silicon which is great. But the scrubber pads on the hands are totally useless for cleaning, all they do is make it extra difficult to hold anything. Would not recommend."
2.0,Beautiful watch but horrible function the adjustment knob pulls out way to easy every time I put it in my pocket it would go into time adjustment mode
2.0,tight sleeves
2.0,It shrunk immediately with one washing.
2.0,Chest area I superrrrrr tight.
2.0,Bring these in smaller sizes! Looks cute
2.0,"These earrings are fine for the price, very cheap. However, the wires and clasp are very uncomfortable. Instead of having a rounded shape to the part that goes through the ear, it is square shaped and can be downright painful. the clasp tends to pinch the ear when closing. I wouldn't order these again and would recommend choosing another product."
2.0,"Shorter than expected, but to expensive to return."
2.0,"I did not like the fabric on this dress - it was almost spandex-like and was not comfortable against the skin, nor was it flattering."
2.0,This watch keeps dropping time.
2.0,I ordered this two months before I received it. It was tight and did not look like the picture.
2.0,"This bag is insulated, but not waterproof.  If you put ice in the bag, it will melt and leak all over."
2.0,"The top is too small and the bottoms are too big. I’m 5’2, 138 lbs and I ordered the large size."
2.0,"They were fine, nice even but one came broken… disappointing because I needed two for gifts."
2.0,The elephant came off chain on the first day of wearing.
2.0,Pro: pretty<br /><br />Con:<br />super tiny<br />incorrect gauge (not a true 16g)
2.0,The liner has been peeling from almost the beginning. Now the seams are separating.
2.0,Really nice but too short it was more of a blazer fit (did not come with sash to tie) xxl? more like a m-l. Its okay though i had no expectations.
2.0,"Really not worth what I paid... They're cheaply made... The backs are cheap and huge not a good combo with the nickel sized earrings, they fall out easy.. But they are cute."
2.0,Dress was uses before. Collar has makeup stains and holes in it
2.0,I'm not sure what type of pockets the designer has but they would have to be very thick with a thick opening seem.  The clip doesn't really stay with the pocket. When I go to remove the blade the sheeth and clip come with it. There just isn't enough grab to keep the clip In place. Purchase something that actually clasps onto the pocket if you want a secure pocket carry
2.0,The Watch band itself is great.  But I have a smaller size watch face 40mm. The strap edges stick outside the watch case itself.  I gave the band to my mother who has the larger sized Watch.
2.0,Bought these for my two year old.  The headband  was extremely hard to put over his head. However it did help with blockout out sounds.
2.0,Description of 2 piece advertise pockets in the top.  No pockets!
2.0,They fit very small
2.0,"I will say that the color is really pretty - a true wine red. But the material is a bit rough (like a thicker t shirt material) and there's no real structure, so it hangs a bit strangely. The zipper looks really fun, but you have to have it unzipped at least partially for it to look even decently ok. The biggest issue I had with the shirt is how it looked from the side - because of the material and lack of structure, it stuck out and made me look a lot bigger than I am."
2.0,Locket is beautiful but it glows by an off center poorly applied blob of glow in the dark paste. Splattered within the inside it's only pretty when closed. Dont recommend.
2.0,The charm is too small
2.0,Pants fit fine but shirt didn't
2.0,"Socks were not like the pic, way too short!"
2.0,"Not as cute as I thought, it’s more like a grandmas sweater."
2.0,I was very disappointed. I am an adult and it was small enough for a child.. Too small..false advertisement
2.0,Cute print.  Runs VERY small. Purchased for a petite friend.  And even these were too small....very unusual.
2.0,"The chest is ok, but the shirt is weirdly tight on the rest of the body as if they reduced the amount of fabric there. It doesn't fit relaxed like in the model. I'm 5'4"", 112 lbs, 35.5"" chest and 34"" hips, and the XS fits good in the chest with enough space, but tight once it arrives to my navel. Weird."
2.0,give  it to someone
2.0,cute hat but a bit too floppy for me
2.0,Has a &#34;gap&#34; issue in the front under the front button.  I didn't like the feel of the material either.  It was a gift though.  I loved the collar but my sister said she never buttons a top button so I guess it wasn't that great of a gift for her.
2.0,Size was all wrong. The width was correct but the length was not. Returned the slippers which cost almost have of what I paid for them. Buyer beware!!!
2.0,"The Keychain are very tiny,  you can barely read what is in it. It looks like a toy instead of a real Keychain"
2.0,"This could be bad reading on my part. It’s not a solid dome ring and also 18k, this makes it a bit more fragile. Mine already has a dent in it. Not sure how to fix this quiet yet. Best not for everyday wear."
2.0,"I clipped the case to my purse in hoped of having easy access to my sunglasses.<br />The tab that holds the clip to the case frayed and fell off before I even left the house.  I tried a second case, same thing.<br />Great idea, poor quality."
2.0,"These are fabulous..there are a ton of them and they appear to be very high quality stainless steel. One problem, they are for REAL septu piercings. My 11 year old added them to hee Christmas list, along with some fake piercing ones, and I was stupid enough to buy them. Why would you need these many for a real piercing? You wouldn’t. I thought they were one time disposable fake piercings. So it’s my bad. The one mistake I WONT make in the future: signing a fake authorization for my tiny baby to get a real piercing. She’s 11! Nooooo"
2.0,The thread that they used to stick it is very weak mind came apart on the first day in the back
2.0,Small sized chain!
2.0,"This is very hard to put on.  Because it is magnetic, it catches on to everything.  the previous mesh band I had, in silver&lt; was wonderful.  I though this was the same thing but it is not.  I would not purchase this product again."
2.0,Worn once. Zipper broke second time.
2.0,This is not as nice as photo.  Even w waiste cinched in it has no shape.  Cheaply made.
2.0,"These are some gorgeous earring. However, the clip portion of the description is misleading because these are not clip on earrings. I was looking for clip on earrings."
2.0,"I like the material and the comfort, but the top doesn’t fit like other pj tops. I wear the pants but not the top"
2.0,Cute as can be but it’s more of a size 2/3 not a 4.
2.0,Sent the shirt back - horrible material and runs very small.
2.0,"It was a nice ring, in less than a year it broke."
2.0,These shirts are kind of cheaply made. Do not seem to be a very good quality.
2.0,Returned it. fit and style were awkward. Not flattering at all.Didn't like material or cut of sleeves.
2.0,"Did not like the way they fit. I thought they would be a little more slim fitted based off the picture. They flare out at the hens, and are baggy in the legs. I'm 6'1&#34; 180lbs, with a slim/athletic build. I was looking for a more slim fitted pair of pants for duty. They are nice pants though, quality wise. And the pockets are nice. Just wish they were more slim built"
2.0,I think that any splashes of food or liquid would soak right through and stain your clothes.
2.0,Is okay you have to be carelessness if you not you loosed
2.0,They are very pretty but they don’t stay on your wrist
2.0,"Comfortable enough that I would wear them, but absolutely disapointed.  I have muscular thighs and expected them to be more as advertised / shown in picture.  These legs are so short that if I squat down, my boys get pinched between the holes that form due to the legs being so short.  For someone of a slender non-muscular build with no expectation of using them for much more than walking they would be fine.  For me tho, they are a huge bust and I will  be requesting a refund or return of the set.  If the legs were 3-4 inches longer they would be the best thing ever."
2.0,It was a little less quality that the picture & it was for Halloween.
2.0,"The leggings fit well and the material washes and wears well. I found this particular pattern much less vivid / bright than shown on the website. I own several other pairs of leggings from this manufacturer, and all of the others look just as good as pictures on the website.  The material for this particular print is much darker  and duller in person."
2.0,They are not excactly the same as in the pic and they are super thin.
2.0,way way to see through. HUGE - I got a small and it swallowed me and I wear a size 10!
2.0,"Beware that this item is not made in Italy, as they claim, is just another Chinese frame"
2.0,"Stone is too big, looks tacky in my opinion.  Returned."
2.0,It doesn't seem like on the picture.
2.0,I returned it because it didn't fit at all. It's the same size I always wear.
2.0,Much bigger than I thought
2.0,The item lacks inner liner causing a boxy fit.
2.0,They stretched after a day which means that they won’t fit well anymore 🤷🏽‍♂️
2.0,This Skirt is tiny...I wear an 8 maybe 10. Ordered Large too small so reordered XL and the button snapped off first try.
2.0,"Lights on one shoe never really worked, my son said they are very uncomfortable"
2.0,I was slightly disappointed with the hooks they look nothing like what's in the picture they are styrofoam with wire inside and just look real fake with one end of the foam cut to look like a &#34;sharp&#34; end  so I gonna need to spruce them up to like a bit
2.0,The socks are very constricting - they barely stretch and run small - these are going to goodwill. Gave it 2 stars because the colors are nice and socks would probably work for a child.
2.0,"I loved the design and everything, but unfortunately they didn’t fit! i wish while i was buying them i’d have a choice to customize the ring size."
2.0,"Although it seems to be a nice umbrella, it is NOT what I ordered. I ordered starry night and these are plaid! Boo!!!"
2.0,If your planning on washing this at all go .2 sizes up  its very pretty though
2.0,These were a bike short with a big bike pad tacked on both sides.  Felt and looked like a big diaper in the middle when you walked around.  Didn't like the fit at all.
2.0,This is so so so tiny not for a man
2.0,Looks cheaper than the photos portray. But that's why they say you get what you pay for.
2.0,"I desperately wanted to love this, because I am overly fond of things not on this planet. But.<br />* The image was pasted in off-centre, leaving a crescent of non-image all along one side.<br />* That empty crescent also got glow-in-the-dark treatment on it, so it's extra obvious in the dark.<br />* The adhesive wasn't applied uniformly (it's like a wonky hourglass across the middle), so the glare of lights off it creates a really weird and distracting effect.<br /><br />This is all sad because the image is just as I'd like otherwise, and the glow is great once you let it spend some time charging in the light.<br /><br />(I hate to leave a negative review, as I'm sure there's some harried individual or sweatshop making these, but this sort of thing reminds me to ask local artist friends who have done similar things if I can buy something like this from them instead.)"
2.0,"Bought this for the Vivomove HR, however as you can see from my pic, the pins on this strap (left) are considerably shorter that the default strap. So, the new straps would not stay on.<br /><br />I'm sure this is a good strap for a watch that fits them, just not for this."
2.0,"I had to return this, because it is ridiculously small! This product would not fit most shoes! This set me back in my wedding planning!"
2.0,"Ugly pants on husky men.  ;-)  if you are a stick-boy, you should be fine."
2.0,"I ordered a small, and it was just too short all over and the shoulders were almost boxy which made the sleeves float away from the arms too much-a football jersey type shape rather than a loose and flowy look. Had I gotten a medium it may have been longer but then the sleeves and shoulders would have been more boxy-am disappointed."
2.0,Looks nice fits way too small.
2.0,"these are ok, they fit a little loose in the but area and are not as stretchy and soft as the other 90 degree. they are a good material and not see through. I'm only giving them a 2 because they are rough and not a soft material."
2.0,"The shades are fair. Cheap plastic with decent clipping mechanism. Problem is the color you see in the picture is what other people see, when you wear them. What you see is old tired gray color."
2.0,Fit is awkward...tight in all the wrong places. Does not fit as described.
2.0,"I ordered a Medium, after reading all the reviews and I have to say it fit comfortably. The only issue I have is that if you want to sleep in them mind you they are polyester! Also said to dry clean only?! Now I'm not one to take my PJ's to the dry cleaners are you? Over all it did arrive early and they did fit comfortably. But I prefer NOT to sweat in my PJ's and I prefer NOT to dry clean. So that's why I am returning them."
2.0,"So many headbands in one order ... they vary a lot in quality and consistency. On most headbands, the buttons can't hold a mask in place without pulling the headband out of shape. Cute idea - Not practical. I ended up taking all the buttons off and using headbands alone."
2.0,"I bought this for my husband, we were going to get photos done. He wears a 2x mostly but I got a 3x just to be sure. It fit to tight and he didn't wear."
2.0,I purchased this for my three-year-old. It is extremely large and it was printed completely in a mirror image so the lettering is backwards. The fabric is nice quality but it was really disappointing to see this.
2.0,"Love the design and look, but way disappointed in sizing chart. What a pain to return and reorder (I mean, Amazon makes it easy, but it's still repacking a box and dropping at the shipper because the manufacturer can't get or advertise sizing nuances).<br /><br />So I'm docking them in the review for that. In our experience. we ordered a 2Y, probably a 3Y was needed, so plan 1 size up.  Though I would note, it might be even 1.5 sizes up that would be needed. I.e., a kid wearing 2Y would prob be better in 3.5, but they don't make that, and 4 is def too big.<br /><br />We had ordered a 2Y and 3Y, and our 2Y kid felt the 3Y might be ok. But we figured she'd only get one season out of them given the fit."
2.0,"Loved the luggage on our first trip in 2016.  Haven't used it since, however upon arrival at the airport the smallest piece extended handle broke and I was unable to use it.  This was a huge inconvenience since this is the piece that is a carry on.  I would love for the company to replace the handle if possible.  I am leaving again in 2 weeks and need this piece to be usable."
2.0,LOVE IT BUT WAS TOO LARGE
2.0,I'm giving it a two star because the watch is pretty. It is light weight be it is made of plastic. But the watch stopped working after one day. Plan to return.
2.0,Suppose it’s better than nothing but they are not nearly as affective as the ones call Machiners by Quilter’s Touch. You get what you pay for
2.0,This was a big L E T D O W N  The materials are inferior the cloak is made from the same synthetic cloth as The $0.99 Santa hat at the $store.<br />Returned to Amazon after it was tried on.<br />I do not recommend this product
2.0,"I used pack for a quick deployment overseas holding power supplies, radios, phones, clothes, medkit attached, water bottle holders were attached, had some survival gear and some headsets packed in it. Within two weeks (first time using it) the top stitching holding the front bag zipper area to the back bag began to tear away and quickly separated. The area is not reinforced in any way, you can see from the pictures. I wouldn't recommend for any serious outdoor use or heavy packing."
2.0,Not durable at all...very flimsy
2.0,Came with a gaping hole in the seam on the leg.
2.0,This is a cheap watch so don't expect much - its very light and I was a bit disappointed that the 12 wasn't even aligned at the top of the watch but decided it was not worth the bother of sending it back.<br /><br />Update: I have raised the rating of this watch a little - I have managed to align the face better after taking the back off and for the money I guess it's not as bad as I first thought.
2.0,They did not work as well as it looked like they would perform in the pictures. When we went out into the darkness we did not see streams of lights
2.0,"This seems like it was designed for a different market.  It was at least two sizes too small for typical US sizing, and the feel of the material was rough.  It seemed more like what I would expect in a low-end import/export market.  I don't expect to return it for a more appropriate size."
2.0,"Nice quality material but the sizing is way off.<br />I ordered Large meanwhile the bottom of the bra that supposed to wrap around under my breast, on the ribs, barely even reaches my breast... feels like an Extra small..."
2.0,Ordered the small- dress fit like a tablecloth even with the chinzy belt provided. On the plus side it was easy to return!
2.0,This shirt is not a wine color it is apple red. Letters came a little stained red instead of a clean white. Shirt fits as expected
2.0,Just ok. Not pirate looking enough.
2.0,The slits went up to my mid section - above my belly button. It is not wearable as a dress
2.0,This top looks nothing like this picture. The color is more of a mauvy pink. I ordered it big to wear with tights but it was WAY too big and it was sewn weird.
2.0,Loved the top but after first washing the white turned dingy gray....followed wash instructions
2.0,"This is a nice looking band, but... the clasp is small and won't stay snapped. Would not trust it at all!!<br />I'll be sending it back, hopefully."
2.0,"Cover up is super cute and got me lots of compliments although it was much smaller on me than I expected. I'm an average sized 5'7"". I washed it on gentle and hung it up to dry and it shrunk so much it looked silly when I put it back on. I'm giving it to my 5' tall friend who probably weighs 95 lbs. Buyer beware."
2.0,Too big. Order a size down.
2.0,"Don't like it.  The material doesn't hang well, and it is somewhat small.  Off to Goodwill with it."
2.0,"Los materiales no son los mejores, pero los accesorios que trae son interesantes"
2.0,The size of this dress seems too small in the waist area and much too loose in the shoulder/chest area. We will return it most likely.
2.0,The broke on me after 4 wears. Wouldn’t recommend.
2.0,Very thin and not at all what I expected. I will be returning it.
2.0,Don't know how to use it.  Picture makes it look easy -- not so!
2.0,The bracelet is very dainty and fragile. I expected something with more substance and stability.  I plan to give it to my young granddaughter. Would not have ordered if I knew it looked like this.
2.0,Poorly made. Not worth 16$. Go to Walmart or Ross
2.0,too thin material
2.0,The bag wasn't the same color and being used I think they meant rebuilt and drug across the firkin pavement. I looked like it fell off a back of a guy whom may have crashed into a tree..
2.0,"I did not review the size very well, its adorable but huge!"
2.0,The studs are much larger than you'd think. So if you want a large stud. This is for you!
2.0,"Very Sad... The first time I wore one of these it broke. Now I am scared to wear any of the others, :("
2.0,"It was supposed to have 2 glasses & I only rec’d 1, the missing pair were pink & the ones I wanted to wear"
2.0,"These glasses are NOT polarized and they do NOT help with headlight glare.  However, the frame and nose pieces are sturdy and the lenses seem clear enough.  I have been using them as safety glasses, and they're fine for that I suppose."
2.0,Cute but broke after the third wear
2.0,"Good mask, hard shell and which makes it hard to apply to face"
2.0,"While it looks very pretty, after using once or twice the spokes started to break"
2.0,"NO FREE RETURNS! I was excited for this item but upon receipt, I found the sleeves are not cotton, but a nylon/spandex material. The pattern isn't vibrant and it runs small. You have to submit a return request and the response was that I would have to pay for shipping myself. Being as this product is from China, that wasn't really cost effective. They only offered to reimburse me 25% of the shipping if I provided them with the tracking number. So I guess I'm stuck with this shirt. My advice, don't purchase unless you are positive you're going to keep it."
2.0,Item not true to your size runs to large
2.0,This is NOT a slim fit shirt.
2.0,"If you're planning on using it for a crazy or tacky costume, fine.  But if you want a classy look, look elsewhere.  The tulle is very stiff and just looks crumpled.  It reminds me of cheap toddler play tutus.  I will try to tame it to lay smoother for my costume, but not sure I will ever wear this."
2.0,"These just...aren't the leggings pictured in the first photo. The cords that tie around them aren't attached (they come separately without a place to attach them) and aren't thick knit like they are in the first photo, but rather thin little cheap-looking cords like in the other photos. Look carefully at the pics without the model to see what you're actually getting. These leggings could never come up that high and be that slouchy on the average adult woman's legs. Unless you are VERY small (under 5'0&#34;) and thin I don't think these will fit you like they fit the model."
2.0,This rusted quickly
2.0,"The actual backpack has been falling apart for a while. The fabric separating the different compartments is really thin and has opened up at the seams. I love the design. I love that you can take off the backpack and wash it. I love the three wheels, which makes it a little easier to go up stairs. I folded the ""dolly"" part of the backpack, which is part of its design, and it completely lost is sturdiness. This has been the absolute annoying part of the backpack, it constantly collapses on its self. I constantly have to push down on my books to lock the dolly part back in place. If this backpack were better quality then it would be a great product. I would not recommend this backpack."
2.0,Very disappointing when I tried my shoes my heel hung about a inch and half over the heel. It would be nice to know this product runs small. Now I have to go run around and find me a sandal in this color to take on vacation 🙃
2.0,"The elastic makes the gown fit strangely. I guess I missed that in the description, because I never would have ordered it."
2.0,quality of chain is a bit thick.  low quality material which is what the price reflects. would not recommend
2.0,"These are neon pink & see-thru. They aren't even close to the color in the picture. They were comfortable when I tried them on & sizing was pretty good. I have a ~27"" waist, wear a 25/26 in most brand name jeans, 130lbs, 5'3, thin but muscular build. They fit my thighs/butt. They were a tad loose around the waist, but would have worked there... biggest issue size wise was the extra material/baggyness in the crotch. Fit-wise I would have made them work, but when you add the wrong color & being see-thru, they're getting returned!"
2.0,The shorts looks fine but the size is no good<br />I am US size L  and a ordered that size L and send me  ones like size XXL
2.0,"They were cute. I ordered a half size bigger than normal because of other reviews but they were still to tight, very disappointing."
2.0,"The pink color was see-through. The material felt cheap. The drawstring doesn’t actually do anything. I’m 5’2 and these were almost full length on me, not cropped. These are going back."
2.0,Rather unattractive and cheap looking.
2.0,Fit too small and the material was sheer so it couldnt be worn without clothes underneath.
2.0,"Don’t stay up, lose fitting but pretty. Maybe meant for thick calves?"
2.0,"Sadly two days before Christmas break, my little kindergartner came home with a broken strap. Wish this backpack would have at least lasted a s hoop year!"
2.0,Ordered this as a gift according to their size and it was way too large.
2.0,The price was right when I ordered this and I liked that it came with the head band. The straps fit awkwardly and its not the softest material-has a weird feeling when my fingertips touch it. I wouldn't really recommend this particular robe.
2.0,"To expensive for my liking. Not good enough quality to be worth it. Came all bunched up in a bag, and was severely wrinkled."
2.0,Weird rayon material.
2.0,"I really thought this would be my favorite of three similar dresses. Unfortunately, that's not the case. It might be a combination of the color (I bought the purplish color) and style, but basically it looks sloppy and baggy. I thought the drawstring would be a positive, but it actually makes it worse since it adds to the overall unkempt look. I should have returned it, but it's fine as a wear-around the house dress during the warmer months. (I'm 5'7"" 130 lb and the small fit fine.) I will say it's nicely made, though. Maybe another, darker color would look better."
2.0,The fabric is kind a granny style.
2.0,Wore them once but they didn't hold their shape. It got stretched out and never went back :( I'm sad because they're cute!
2.0,"I ordered the S a month ago and it was too small, and it was fulfilled with 2-day Amazon shipping. However, for some reason, the M takes a long time to arrive. I then had to wait for 2 weeks for this item in size M and it's still the wrong size! They gave me an M bottom and S top, and my vacation is coming up in less than two weeks. Horrible quality control."
2.0,"The dress is beautiful and well made, but it does not work for someone with a large bust."
2.0,"For the price i was expecting more.  The photos online look great but it's nothing like that.  I ordered the OLIVE color and in person it is slightly faded green (not like the photo). It is thin which was what i wanted but it is cheaply made.  The material is a little scratchy and rough.  The brand is Le3no but for some reason mine had a tag with the brand C'ESTTOI (see photos).  The neck area has a flap of material that rides up when you put the jacket on so you have to keep re adjusting it (to tuck it back in).  I am not happy with the purchase.  I will be returning this.  As far as sizing, just follow the size chart and you will be fine.  I ordered a XXL.  i am 168 lbs and 5'8 tall.  I usually wear an xl  but again, follow the measurements in the chart.  I would not recommend this jacket.  It is cheap and you can definitely get a better deal on a better quality jacket in other stores.  This jacket is also not very flattering.  I usually look slimmer in anorak styles but this one made me look even more &#34;boxy&#34;.  I am large frame girl but this did not look very good at all."
2.0,"I purchased this bag based on the reviews being so good.  The purse arrived intact, however 2 zippers are broken and will not close at all.  The bag looks good but has a cheaper feel to it.  I could've spent a bit ore and received a much better quality purse.  I am keeping the purse and will make due for now.  The material inside is a cheap, shiny material that does not look durable and is stiff.  Overall I do not have any high hopes of this purse lasting long and would not recommend it to anyone else.  Most items I've purchased online have been pretty good, but this particular purse cannot be added to that list. I will be using it while I shop around for a better purse."
2.0,"Very cute slippers, but I ordered a child's 10 and when I got them there was a sticker on the bottom of the slipper that said 10, but if you removed the sticker it said 9 on the actual sole.  My daughter tried them on just to see if they fit, and they did, but just barely.  She's normally a 10, so I'm sending them back and will be reordering, hoping to get the correct size."
2.0,"I ordered the 1st dress in large and a brown, blue and off white pattern.  The material is heavy and pretty but the dress is too big.  The zipper also gets messed up because there is nothing stopping it from zipping down to far.  Ordered a medium in the blue and white poka dots.  This material is very thin.  The zipper doesn't go down far enough so I had to put it over my head.  Then it was WAY to tight to zip up. I have hips and a chest.  If you're very slim I can see it working for you."
2.0,The material is very thin. I did not keep them. I wanted it a little thicker with more compression.
2.0,"Look great, but not worth the $20 I spent!!!  Broke after a month or two of wearing them.  One of the screws fell out that holds the lens in and they are short screws--not what I have in my eyeglass repair kit.  :("
2.0,I’m a size small 5’7” and it was very baggy on me.
2.0,"They are okay.  No spring hinges, definitely cheap feel, and overly polarized.  I honestly wouldn't recommend them."
2.0,"The top fit perfectly, if not a little loose. But the bottoms were too tight at the waist. For reference, I ordered a Medium and wear a size 6 or a small/medium."
2.0,"Nice fit.  Sturdy product.  If you intend to match product shirt with pants, Red Kap makes it impossible to do.  I ordered Postman blue pants and shirt.  They were two different blues.  I also ordered an olive set that didn’t match."
2.0,These boots are really cute and they have the round toe that I love but the size chart is easy off and so I returned them. Haven't gotten a refund yet tho
2.0,"Feedback said item runs small, so i ordered larger, and it fits perfect. After I washed them, the zippers wont lock and they just unzip!! Changed my 5 to a 2..."
2.0,Some of the sock is starting to come apart at the heel already just from it rubbing my shoe.These socks are hot also.It seems to be working for keeping sweat from being a problem but overall I would not recommend getting these.Oh also they are tight.
2.0,It’s too short for me to wear and I am only 5’7”.  I love the print and fabric though.
2.0,The toxic chemical smell ruins everything! They are oddly shaped and run too small! Cute but not worth it!
2.0,"Honestly sickest frames on the market but the arm legit broke off after wearing it twice, and the metal started to rub off and made my nose green. Good for a one time wear to flex, but won’t last you."
2.0,They are giving me a refund and were very helpful after learning i wasn't satisfied with the product.  Thank you!!!
2.0,"not for multiple use, came apart at seams after one wash"
2.0,Black underwear in the pack fell apart after about 2 to 3 wearings.
2.0,"One star for quality and one star for fit. I'm 5'4"" and normally wear size 10 in clothing. The torso was too short so that the shirt did not blouse at all and you could see the waist elastic. The pants were too baggy at the crotch area almost as if they were sewn on backwards and ballooned at the ankle. I really wanted a romper/jumpsuit but not this one."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:cfeb4d538956ed2068358ee257ce4d4f]] This is a cute hat - iron on “go take a hike” is securely applied. Nice neutral color. The major downside is that the circumference is small. If you have a medium to large head, it will not fit. I noted this comment by other reviewers but thought that maybe they had very large heads or didn’t know how to adjust it. Nope. Circumference is just under 22”. And it is not adjustable. See photos/video. For the price, we’ll keep it - might be perfect for a child or small-headed adult."
2.0,It fit kinda small and had a hole in the bottom of the pocket when I got it
2.0,Looks cheap. Would be appropriate for you young girl 10 to 12. Not really for an adult or for a gift to an adult. Not worth the money spent
2.0,"The initial problem is hat the wrong size and color were sent. However, the more significant problem was that he fabric was not soft or cozy as described. I did not have it replaced."
2.0,"This sweater is very cute and the sleeves are nice and long but weirdly, it's not able to come together in the middle.  You can even see this in the picture.  I guess it's meant to just drape at your sides only.  I don't mind this look, but it has the tendency to fall off my shoulders because of it.  Just a weird fit."
2.0,The product came and one of the mittens was ripped.
2.0,Not the same
2.0,very small and cheap looking.
2.0,I was looking for an option to wear while keeping up a professional appearance while teaching.  This was not it.  The stud was constantly popping out of my nose and it was even more visible than my regular diamond stud unless the person is standing 10 feet away.
2.0,"4pcs.... What are you considering 4pcs? 2 nose rings, a clear bag, and a red drawstring bag? When you say 4pcs it means 4pcs! I love the nose rings, it's just you're misleading. I want another 2 nose rings sent, yes different colors but same size, for your misleading information."
2.0,I’m sending back regardless that I was told I didn’t need to just for the fact that I won’t be wearing it. I don’t need to contribute to waste by throwing it out. I wasn’t given the same option for both of the shirts we bought. So with that being said I’ll send both back. Didn’t even try it on since it’s jersey material & not a tshirt like I had expected.
2.0,"Cute top, stretches easily out of shape. Will snag on anything basically"
2.0,Too big for wrist.
2.0,Ordered large. Didn't have xlarge. Fit like medium. Disappointed. Love the material and length. Will give to coworker
2.0,The pants were too big and the top was too small.
2.0,Definitely see thru. I wear a 15 and ordered plus size and i doubt they would fit anyone over a size 18. I have to pull them up constantly they are tight in the calves. Dont hold anything in and when I sit down my a## shows.
2.0,They say they are men's oversized but will fit a woman better or smaller slim head.
2.0,"The dress looks precious on my daughter and arrived in perfect time for her to wear it to an event tomorrow - but it doesn’t zip. So, if we can’t find someone to replace the zipper overnight it’s a waste."
2.0,"Yes, these stones are clearly died, which isn’t an issue for me. They are so poorly cut, dull and misshapen that they are pretty much a waste. I definitely wasn’t excepting gem quality sapphires for $15, but I wasn’t expecting such  chipped, uneven, poorly cut stones. They are basically rocks that were dyed and cut. You can see the areas where they couldn’t or really shouldn’t have tried to cut them. They also aren’t polished, or if they are they certainly have no luster or sheen. I would skip these and just get stones as they should have just been sold as rough stones or those that could have been tumbled and polished."
2.0,I am 5' 2&#34;/130 lbs. I normally wear a small or medium for an over-sized look. I ordered a large by the other reviews...its way too small.
2.0,"Look very, very fake and plastic."
2.0,Hated it! doesn't look like pictured at all. The elastic covers your breast and that's it!  It does not come down on your body AT ALL! Returning!!!
2.0,"Bought these for my daughter to use in Krav Maga classes. She didn't want to go completely barefoot as she had injured her toe. We bought what we thought would be her size, but they turned out to be too small. Had to return them."
2.0,Large is way too small for my son. I gave it to a child
2.0,Cute dress not so great material and fits small
2.0,"made in china, seller makes you pay at either UPS or whole foods no free drop off"
2.0,"I really wanted to like this. The color is lovely, the chiffon detail down the collar is pretty and feminine, the fabric has a nice subtle texture. But...the floppy pockets were just weird, they made me look even wider than I already am. I saw they were floppy in the pictures but thought I would  take a shot.  Also it's very long. I wanted it to mostly cover my butt, but this went way past. Sadly returning."
2.0,I really like these pants. I sized up to an XL I wear a size 14 jeans. It gets cold running so I bought them for that. These fit tight with no give. They look fine but feel tight. They might look tight. It gets cold here and these are perfect for the cold. So far I’ve not needed leggings when I wear these. And they don’t hinder how I run or walk.  These are also great for trail runs. But I couldn’t wear them any smaller. Mine are solid black and I think I’m buying the red pants and sizing up. XL should fit perfect if not too big. I gave them 3 stars cause of the fit. I’d hate to see the size mediums. Geez I bet they fit a 10 year old. But these are useful and I’m sizing up the next pair. Around here I need all the fleece lined pants I can get.
2.0,"I purchased this hat for my granddaughter who wanted a hat for the Renaissance Fair and I thought I would make her one because the hats at the fair were expensive!  I didn’t want to spend too much money and bought this hat for that reason. I was hesitant hoping the quality wouldn’t be too cheap looking. I was so disappointed when the hat came in the mail squashed and bent!  It was sent in a bag!  The next morning I straightened it out the best I could and I’m hoping I can cover the damage when I decorate it!  Like they say, “You get what you pay for...”"
2.0,"The pleats are not folded along the colors at all, so it looks ridiculous… and it's hemmed crookedly. Annoying."
2.0,Way too small (XL fit like a medium).
2.0,Product had a hole in the seam. Wasn’t able to return it.
2.0,I did not like these sunglasses at all. The left and right lenses and frames are slightly different sizes and shapes so they look strange. Is this really cork? It appears as though it's made of a plastic type material. Definitely returning these.
2.0,These are so cute and soft but my navy one came with a hole in the arm. I haven’t checked the red one yet UPDATE RED one also had a hole in the arm... Hoping it was just this one because they are really cute and true to size.<br />UPDATE: After washing these two (they came apart in wash on delicate... the seams pulled apart on the hem of the neckline and the one sleeve that had a hole almost completely came unstitched. Poor quality. Don't order or you will be disappointed... also they are not nearly as long as shown on the model... they fit more like a shirt with super long sleeves.
2.0,I guess I can't be completely dissatisfied because I bought cheap. I did not receive the earrings and neither the necklace or the extender is as long as it appeared in the picture.  Lesson learned.  I want send it back because  it's not worth putting the time in to the return process.  The beads ok I guess.😒
2.0,Let me start off saying that the bag is a good looking and well made. It was not smelly or crumpled. It's just NOT what I thought it was going to be. I thought that it would be entirely made up of genuine leather. It is not.<br />Having said that I do not think it's worth the 50+ dollars I paid for it. I will be returning it.
2.0,Quality of material and seamstress was something to desire. 100% cotton and shrunk drastically!
2.0,Nice mask but really stinks.  I left it outside for a week before Halloween and it still smelled horrible.  Could not wear it long.
2.0,Started coming apart after 1 washing
2.0,The material feels awful against my skin.
2.0,The breast part is very large in armpit area other than that it is cute and as shown.
2.0,The white sole makes them look cheap!!!
2.0,When they arrived I was really excited because they were very cute but they did not stand the test of time. In less than a week one of the flowers came off the top. Plus the flower petals would get caught inside the sandal straps because there was only one tiny glue dot. Pass on these unless you need a one event sandal.
2.0,Very cheaply made... I only paid $7.99 for it but it was worth maybe $3... but served a purpose for my son...
2.0,"I bought this a few months ago and washed it with the rest of my clothes like I normally do, and these pants shrunk like crazy.  I bought a Large and I'm not a very big person (usually wear between a 6-8 pant) and they literally cannot fit anymore.  They are like trying to wedge my way into a sausage casing.  Maybe there was some complicated washing instructions that I didn't follow, but buyer beware -- these pants will SHRINK in your regular load of laundry."
2.0,Cute pattern but the elastic in the shorts is about big enough to comfortably fit around my thigh. I wish I hadn’t cut the tags off or I would be sending back.
2.0,Spell check.
2.0,"I really liked the shoes they are nice and comfortable, with really good cushioning. But about a month ago one shoe separated from the bottom so I cannot recommend these shoes for that reason they should last longer then 3 months it shows poor quality."
2.0,"Poorly constructed. Messy glue spots, bad stitching, zippers stuck first use. Not recommended. Don't wish to try them out, think they would fall apart.<br />These are only a few photos."
2.0,"These were just ok....definitely not compression. I ordered the XS and they are soft, have the different patterns on them, but I just didn't find them flattering or compression. During HITT I could feel jiggling in my lower body still. better options on amazon."
2.0,In the pic this looks like a cute tunic to wear with leggings or skinny jeans.  It’s basically a long sleeve T-shirt.  Hits above mid-thigh. Might work if u are super skinny but I’m average and only 5’5” and it’s not flattering.  I’m returning.
2.0,I returned this dress.  It is really clingy and see through.  Slightly small in size.
2.0,Doesn't fit my 6 YO's head well (water gets in) and the piece that holds the strap in place broke during the second usage.
2.0,"Product wasn’t true to size, very short very tight and overall just to small.<br />I even went up a size kindly disappointed.<br />Sissy is 34 lbs and 35 inches tall.<br />Ordered size 110"
2.0,"The “white” was yellow-y, and it was see through, and too tight. I returned it."
2.0,The dress is pretty stiff and a little bulky and not quite what i was looking for the bust is too big and the wrinkles are hard to remove
2.0,"I am normally a medium, therefore I ordered a medium - unless you have a rock-hard body, with no baby bulges - go bigger in size. Also, upon returning I have to pay to ship it back."
2.0,Doesn't fit the wrist properly and is too delicate for a watch this large.
2.0,"You get what you pay for! These have very thin “leather” that seems to cover a foam backing.  You are able to see the white edges of the foam. One pair of earrings was ok. But, the “leather” covering in the second pair was folded over and exposing more of the foam. I would never buy these again."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:fefaeb40959b53148a2abd9ac6c6c20c]] I ordered a size medium, I likely needed an extra large. Everything fits but my chest. I'm a G, so although the arms fit the chest area does not. I'm 5'4"" 165lbs. My only complaint is the chest area, and this is surprising considering it is a loose dress. But, never the less, I have a large chest so..  if you are like me, order a size or two up. Also the color looked like hospital scrubs. But I didn't mind the color even though it was not lavender."
2.0,Material is very cheap and not worth the money
2.0,"this is a little pin, not a brooch. and it's fastened on with a squeezy clip, that always loosens over time and gets lost.  I wish it was fastened with a safety pin back so it would last longer, but it's just too small for one of those.  It does look just like the picture, but it's tiny. Looks more like 3/4"" inch than 1"" tall."
2.0,"It is not stylish and chick as it looks in the picture. it runs large, and I would  recommend it for women over 45."
2.0,"they break too easy, stupid me, bought another one because they are so cute, and it broke also, :("
2.0,Received the earrings in a small bag and no Pandora gift box.  Doesn't make for a nice presentation as a gift.  Disappointed.
2.0,The sleeves are just held on by a tiny string all I did was raise my arm and the sleeve ripped off
2.0,Not quite what I thought I was getting. And delivery took a really long time.
2.0,"I’ve bought these for years, I have several. However I just went to refresh mine and when the news ones arrived they have changed fabric. They are much thinner. I liked the thicker more cotton fabric. These seem much cheaper. Very disappointed."
2.0,First of all I was sent the wrong size. I ordered a medium. The bag the skirt came in said XL and the skirt itself said XXL. And even for it being a bigger size it was still shorter than expected. I ordered the orange skirt and the colors weren’t as bold as the picture shows which was disappointing. The material itself looked good which is why I gave 2 stars and not 1. I returned it because of the wrong size. Might have kept it otherwise.
2.0,Very very thin material that isn’t seamed at the top or bottom and uneven cut :(
2.0,"Fabric felt like blackout curtains, just a heavy awkward material. Fit was funky too"
2.0,There was scratches on the lens and the ear pieces are lose and can't be tightened
2.0,way to itchy; cheap material.
2.0,Purchased this item because of the good rating and price.  Installed it and it worked great for about 3 or 4 times.  Then the prime stopped working.  Now I have to order another one.  This time I found the OEM replacement cheaper on a non-Amazon site.
2.0,Buy it 2 sizes too small. Their size charts are very flawed
2.0,"I ordered a size larger than I needed based on my calf measurement based on the sizing info in the product description. They fit my foot, ankle, and calf well, but the band just under the knee is really tight and painful. I thought it might stretch as I wore them and get more comfortable, but it did not. I ended up folding the sock over, so the band was around my ankle.The compression worked great around my ankle and calf, but the swelling moved to my forefoot and toes. These were fairly easy to get on, but difficult to get off. The material is nice and smooth. My search continues for compression socks that work for me."
2.0,These earrings are really pretty at first but they tarnished to the point of no return within 2 weeks of wearing. Super disappointed and will not be buying again.
2.0,Turned black after a week
2.0,It squeezes my head so tight I cannot wear it. Love the design wish it fit.
2.0,This is just not the soft cuddly looking shirt that I see in the picture. I fell the material is the kind that makes you sweat.  Giving it to goodwill.
2.0,Cheap n don't stay in position from day one.  They sparkle cute
2.0,"This shirt runs small. I am wearing a M. The material is a bit thin, but not see through. I hope it does not shrink when I wash it (as it is already too small). The sleeves are long enough."
2.0,"Loved the appearance of the necklace, but I can’t stand how on one side the gems constantly flip backwards. I wore it to an event and my date had to flip it back before every photo. So frustrating!"
2.0,"It was too small , probably for a kid"
2.0,"I'm wondering if this is just the ones I received, because I see no other reviews with this issue. I agree the sizing is off -- I got the XS and they fit more like a S/M, and are especially loose in the chest area (I'm a 34C for reference, roughly 36-37"" chest). I have really been trying to find a replacement for the tanks they used to carry at Target -- originally under the Mossimo brand, and then the A New Day line. They no longer carry the long, stretchy, fitted tanks -- only shorter ones that are almost short enough to be midriff shirts. Also tried the Amazon brand and those didn't have that coveted length and elasticity either. Idk why this style of shirt is so hard to find -- wondering if I need to resort to shapewear, but I don't want to feel like a sausage.<br />For some reason, even after washing these tanks, they are very itchy. I'm going to try to wash them again -- I'm wondering if I thought I used fabric softener and didn't. They feel soft when I first put them on, but then I'm itchy all over.<br />Wish Target would bring back those old tanks, I wore them for years and they genuinely took at least five years to become fully stretched out. They were durable, comfortable and great for layering."
2.0,These look ok. The metal bar that goes in the ear was bent unfortunately on one of them.
2.0,"First of all, the fit is smaller, so if you typically wear a small, get a medium. The material is very stiff and not comfortable."
2.0,The beige tone is darker than expected from picture. The material is cotton and conforms to the body (not lose and shows extra curves). Iy was too long for me. I am a little over 5' and it fits below my hips. Not very happy. Sadly I had removed tags otherwise I would return it. Now have to get it altered for lenght.
2.0,"Not only did it turn my finger green within 3 days, but it also came with the gem crooked. It's too bad because I was extremely excited for this ring. Deff good for just a day at work or school though. Can't wear forever and the gem will not last."
2.0,"I had to return this item, because it was NOT true to size and ran really really small. The quality is very nice though."
2.0,"It's an odd fit and I'm not usually at all picky. It sort of slips off the shoulders and there are no buttons or sash to keep it on. It feels like a robe more than a sweater... which is why it's call kimono cardigan, I guess. It's kind of both. But it doesn't feel comfy enough to be a robe and it doesn't hang nicely enough to wear out. I should have returned it, but I'm not in the habit of returning... I keep thinking it will fit better the next time I try it on. That of course makes no sense. Oh well."
2.0,Not what I expected. Isn't loud at all.
2.0,"When I  ordered  this bracelets,  I  chose  purple  and gold, not this color  I received.  If I  wanted  this color, I  would have  ordered  it. Not cool!"
2.0,"Not what I was expecting and arrived with a snag on the inseam. Very thin, more like opaque tights than leggings."
2.0,It was supposed to fit Samsung Active 2 40mm but it did not. Disappointed  so needed to return it.
2.0,Did not look anything like the photo when I tried it on. The seams are weird and it looked funny when I put it on.
2.0,"I wanted these for lounge pants. So I ordered up one size, because let's face it clothes from Amazon usually run small. Should have ordered up two sizes."
2.0,You get what you pay for these did not provide any actual protection but I'm more just for fashion I would not get up with you again I would spend the extra money and get real useful sunglasses
2.0,the buttons close was very bad.
2.0,"The bracelet is very pretty and sturdy, so I was very disappointed when the clasp would not hold the ends together.  I tried several times, and although there are safety hooks on either side of the clasp, they also did not hold tight.  The bracelet would just fall off my wrist.  I am returning this."
2.0,"Size is great and comfy. But it isn't the item in the listing.  It says Anderson,  not Sanderson."
2.0,I love the concept of this shirt and if you are a C cup (maybe D but probably not) or smaller I think it is going to fit you great.  But if you are busty like myself then the elastic is going to ride up on your breast like and it is never going to fit right.  If I lift an arm then the elastic waist is halfway up my breasts.<br /><br />I did like the flare at the hips and the sleeves.  Really great for an hourglass look but again if you are a D cup and above I'm not certain it will fit.  However I did like that the buttons are faux so the shirt doesn't button up and therefore you don't get a gap between buttons.  That was a nice feature.
2.0,The sunglasses broke at the top frame when i went to try them on the first time!!! Will re update once i receive replacement
2.0,Not like picture. Felt mislead. These earrings were a great price. But they are so small they fit an infant. Do not purchase these earrings unless it's for very small children.
2.0,"I ordered these shorts in XXL, they should be labeled SMALL.  I initially wrote a scathing review, I heard from Sasairy apologizing and encouraging exchange or refund, which was appreciated that they were interested in the reviews.  So I upgraded to 2 stars."
2.0,Much smaller than they appear in the photo. I have small ears and they are too small for me. They are really child sized.
2.0,"EDIT: these sunglasses broke within 6 months of buying them. The screws starting falling off and were stripped after fixing them twice. Not really worth the money after all.<br /><br />I love how these sunglasses are actually polarized. They’re a little bigger than I expected, but it’s certainly not a problem!"
2.0,"I would have given it four stars, except it arrived with one tassel broken.<br />The biggest problem, is that it appears that the tassels are literally *glued* to the chain!  So, don't expect many uses out of it, and the glue is not altogether invisible.The gold is a nice color, but obviously costume.<br />The stones [cz?] Are beautiful and we'll placed. The length is great and the weight.  The style is perfect for breaking up a shirt with full coverage, or to complement a V-neck.<br />But, hey, it's cheap, so ces't la vie."
2.0,Keeps breaking.
2.0,"The shirt looked so beautiful on the website!  And it looked very pretty from the front when I opened the package.  And then I realized that somehow they must have run out of fabric?? The back was completely sheer. Not something I am comfortable wearing, so unfortunately had to return."
2.0,Very hot and the material is not very comfortable
2.0,Very cute but on the small size.
2.0,I wished the product would of been made with another material. The quality of the material was very cheap. It was going to be a present but I was very disappointed with it and returned it (it was dirty and faded). The idea of the design is good.
2.0,"This hat was in no way slouchey like it shows in photo. Maybe for a child, but not an adult with a normal size head."
2.0,It is a bit fragile.  Looks like fashion jewelry and not silver.  I like silver so I will wear it.
2.0,"I would size down, it was too big"
2.0,"They’re cute for sure! I split them between me and my two besties! They’re beautiful! However, mine started to unravel the second day I was wearing it, and it ended up having to become a rearview mirror decoration, which made me kind of sad."
2.0,Way too small and cheap-looking.
2.0,I didn’t like at all it felt like spandex material was not at all comfy. It’s cute but the way material feels was bad.
2.0,These had extremely large wide legs! I sent back.
2.0,"The picture is deceiving, don't believe the hype. I purchased a 3x so that it will slide off the shoulder properly.  Nope, the shirt sits like a large. Who are they making the shirt for? definitely disappointed in the sizing, I gave the shirt to my niece who it a lot smaller than I am, and still will not fit off the shoulder."
2.0,Sewn very badly. Crooked. Good material bad sewing4
2.0,"The product was visually as I expected, but it did not stand up to the test of time. Definately only order of you plan on wearing it ONLY on your shirt and not in an actively moving job. The clip broke off the second time I wore it."
2.0,Cheap and flimsy. Seems like something you'd find in the kids toys section at the supermarket. Don't pay more than $10 IMO
2.0,Too feminine- Gave to a gal pal instead-
2.0,The pants fit great and I have several. However the band around the waist keeps coming apart.
2.0,"It looks nice, but if you bump it on anything at all it opens up.  It hasn't fallen off several times.  It's actually shocking I haven't lost my fit bit.  I can't were it when i'm on the computer at work because it opens up on while i'm typing.  I should have returned it after the first time it fell off, but I liked the look of it so I didn't, now i have missed my window on the return.  I guess that was a waste of money.  :("
2.0,Was to small and not a stretch band.
2.0,"Got this based on the reviews posted but definitely did not work for me. I’m large-chested (DD) and it hit me at a really awkward point and just emphasized how top heavy I am. Definitely returning. I could see how this would be cute for girls who are small on top, but beware if you aren’t!"
2.0,smaller than expected .. would not buy again
2.0,"holy cow!  i bought white one after buying gray one from another seller,same maker though.  this one's far from white.  it's at best beige with brighter yellow yarn throughout.  has one huge tear on shoulder.  yes,it's oversized, but much much more so than the other one i bought.  it's much bulkier and has chemical smell.  gray one looks elegant, in this one i look like a head in a pile of blankets.  for comparison, i'm 5'5&#34;, sz 4<br />it is good as a robe though.  big chunky smelly robe...<br />'"
2.0,To tight!
2.0,Covers the phone and is pretty.  Nothing more no protection
2.0,"I love love love love love this bag. but within 2 days of receiving it, the side strap broke due to poor sewing. I glued it with gorilla glue because I paid $60 and the some for the thing and it broke again. I'm not pleased with the manufacturing of this product. if you're going to charge $60+ for a tote bag, it should be crafted a lot better. and if it's not, you shouldn't charge that much for something made poorly."
2.0,Like the concept but arrived broken. Will be returning.
2.0,I am 5' 2&#34; and weigh about 115 size B cup. I knew that the sizing ran small so I ordered a medium and the bottom fit well but the top was still too small. Since it has cups there was no way I could get away with it. Unfortunate BC its cute :(
2.0,They fit nice but the waist seam was ripped so I had to sew it myself.
2.0,"Pink color is more of a dusty rose (if I'm being polite), looks more like the color of vomit. Disappointed!"
2.0,"First of all the filling is not Down, I Read the inside label in Chinese, it's polyfill. It's also quite small, I normally wear US size M, I ordered Large to be safe, still too tight. The jacket also came in dirty on one sleeve and the back."
2.0,Runs a size or two to small! But ok quality
2.0,The size of the leggings runs at least 4 sizes too small.
2.0,Such a cute ring!  Unfortunately it makes my finger green.  I wish it was sterling silver.
2.0,I feel like the scarf may not be fully cotton linen. it is a little heavier weight than other linens i have purchased.
2.0,The band itself is beautiful.. however I will not be able to use it as it only came with 1 pin.. so I can't install to my watch.  Disappointed!
2.0,"Very cheaply made, like ribbon used for wrapping Christmas presents.  It fell apart after about a week. Might be OK for holding an ID or badge, but not for keys or other heavy items."
2.0,Really liked it... would have given a five star but it was little too small for a 16month baby...<br /><br />I bought it for gift and cannot even return.. :(
2.0,"Not what i expected at all, had to return it"
2.0,Dress is great material and all but runs super small.
2.0,It doesn't match the picture. It doesn't look as good as the picture.
2.0,"I'm a busty woman with a short waist, and this robe, as lovely as it is, just doesn't fit comfortably.  The tie loops are located high on the robe and when I tie it, the tie rides just below my bosom rather than at my waist.  It's just uncomfy and very unflattering.  Wish I hadn't bought it."
2.0,"I think calling this a “wallet” is a stretch. It’s more like a poorly designed change purse, though the two snap closure won’t really suffice to keep change in under all circumstances.<br /><br /> The wallet is nothing more than a strange leather piece folded over. No dividers, no slots for credit cards: just a pouch and not a very large one at that.<br /><br /> I don’t find it useful.<br /><br />Jerry"
2.0,"I've tried these shoes three times and can't make it through an hour. They're very lightweight, but there's little or no support. I tried using my orthotics, but they rendered the shoe too tight and cut the circulation off to my feet.  Without the orthotics, I felt out of balance and wobbly. The tongue was also weird. It's too short for the shoe so it hits the front of the foot in an odd way. Disappointed."
2.0,I first purchased a Med which fit like a large then ordered a small after a couple washings on gentle cycle the material stretched out and ended up fitting like the Med I originally got. The material picks up lint horrible from what ever you come in contact with. Bad purchase!!!!!!
2.0,"Very low quality. After 2 weeks the canvas upper separated from the rubber side, the insole came apart, and the elastic holding the tongue weakened so much the width increased so the shoe falls off. The only reason I did not give it one star was the cost. But I suggest spending more for higher quality"
2.0,I loved it. But it's to dang hard to buckle by myself and it's hard for other people to buckle it on me also. So I don't ever get to wear it.
2.0,Extremely small! We bought a xlarge (husband normally fits a large) and it was more like a small. Gave two stars because they did offer a refund.
2.0,"The frames work well and look good, but one of the lenses (particularly the top of the lens) makes vision blurry. It's enough to make wearing the glasses uncomfortable. 2/5"
2.0,"The quality of the sterling silver 925 ear cuff is good.  However, I should have realized that an ear cuff is not meant for pierced ears.  Since my ear is pierced and I must &#34;cuff&#34; the earring to my ear, I have to close the earring tightly.  This causes pain to my ear and is not comfortable.  In addition, the cuff begins to slip and not stay in the area I want it."
2.0,Very Poor Quality
2.0,you get what you pay for. not so great quality
2.0,"It took only seven weeks for these clip-ons to fall apart.  I was very careful with them too.  If you can afford to reorder every 7 weeks or so, they're great looking and they'll do the job. I mean, the price is right for a disposable item, but don't expect sturdiness"
2.0,nothing about this shirt is &#34;black&#34; and the material is very thin and it runs small in sizing.  a 2x fit like a L and was to tight to look cut and flowy like the picture.
2.0,"It broke after only a month of use, but it worked well until then."
2.0,"5'9""/36B/145lbs athletic build. A medium fit perfectly. This is fine, stretchy in the right spots, jut very see-through because it's white"
2.0,"I'm giving the dress 2 stars b/c it was exactly as pictured, but it didn't fit at all. I bought it in a small and it was really huge! I bought a similar dress in white from a different seller and this dress didn't hug my body in a fitted way like the white one did.It was loose all over the place. It's not worth returning for an exchange or refund so I'm stuck w/ it. I'll probably give it away."
2.0,"I hate them! I ordered a size up for my 1 yr old and actual size for my 5 yr old, I have to struggle severely to get these on my kids. I thought they would be somewhat sturdy on top fabric like an ugg boot feel that kept shape that feet would slip into but it's impossible to get on my kids feet. My fault for instantly opening and assuming would be ok as now I cant return and have to buy 2 more pairs of boots somewhere else in same wk"
2.0,"The material was nice but, I wish that the size had been bigger than what was displayed. Not worth it."
2.0,"Very beautiful sandal. I cried but I had to return because it was just too painful to wear. The arch is too high for me, but another girl would rock them well."
2.0,"I really did not expect much from this necklace as it was a cheap necklace, but the pictures looked nice on here so I figured I would give it a chance. It was fairly slow shipping, and once it finally arrived I have to say I was disappointed. The &#34;turquoise&#34; did not look even anything like a real one. I could tell it was fake without much inspection. The chain looked very cheap and not well made also. Again, I know not to expect much given the price, but it was much nicer in the pictures!"
2.0,Nice mask.  It is made very rigid (hard) mask....no give to it.  Mask easily cracked in half.
2.0,Picture look good but it not useful.
2.0,The first time I washed my tanks a strap ripped off.
2.0,"I ordered according to size chart but seems like it's 4 sizes big. Looks good though. Received in a plastic little zip bag., No box or bag. Very disappointed with packaging."
2.0,Material is very thick. Overall looks very revealing and borderline inappropriate to wear out. Returned.
2.0,TOO SMALL.  NO ROOM FOR LIPSTICK OR ANYTHING BUT CREDIT CARDS.  HATE I PURCHASED.
2.0,"This runs small. The adult size is more teen sized than adult size. The scythe is extremely short and very flimsy. The gloves would fit a child. None of the edges or hems are finished in any way, they are all rough edges, and the zig zag hems on the robe are very roughly cut. The fabric is cheap polyester. The face cover is easy to see through, and the glowing eyes are cool. Unfortunately the eyes blink and you cannot make them stay permanently on. It fine for a cheap Halloween costume, but it is overpriced for what it is and it's definitely sized incorrectly."
2.0,Was not the color I wanted. Color is a light lavender. But it' ok.
2.0,To tight!!
2.0,"WAYYYY TOO SMALL!! I ordered an XL and got a shirt that will fit my niece that is turning 11 this year.<br /><br />I am giving this product 2 stars, because it is actually a cute shirt, but very cautious about ordering due to the size. It looks identical to the picture, but I am not exaggerating when I say that runs very small."
2.0,"I purchased the silver because I read the reviews and learned that the colored pieces looked a bit sloppy. I figured I would avoid a sloppy paint job by getting plain silver, but when it came it was not just a silver metal piece of jewelry. It appears to have some kind of gray paint or at the very least there is a clear substance painted on the leaves and in the spaces leading up to the chain. It does seem a bit sloppy, and it is a heavy necklace. I will still wear it, but it's not my favorite necklace or anything. It also took a really long time to arrive, since it gets shipped from somewhere in China."
2.0,"While the boots certainly draw a lot of attention and seem to better constructed than most synthetic boots (e.g. the sole isn't pulling off within the first month), the plastic side zipper has broken with less than 50 wears. The only reason I don't give these a single star is because they do look good and are quite comfortable."
2.0,"These did fit well and they're very cute boots (my 8 year old likes them) however after just one wear outside, the suede on the right foot was peeling off. SO, I've returned them."
2.0,"I usually wear a size XL in gloves, but I thought having extra room might be nice so I ordered XXL. When I got my XXL's not only were they not roomier, they were so tight I could barely get them on at."
2.0,I've had the ring for two days and the black is already coming off. I'm very unhappy. The only plus side really is that it had looked great at first and it fits perfectly.
2.0,Very cute but did not fit as expected. Go a size smaller than the sizing chart it gives.
2.0,"It is very cute to look at, but it is VERY cheaply made.  The chain broke after only wearing it for a few hours.  Disappointed, but I guess it costs less for a reason."
2.0,I bought these earrings to wear with an outfit I bought for my Birthday/Valentine Dinner These earrings look red on the website screen but they are more orange/pink. Very disappointing
2.0,"It’s cute, and the rose gold matches. However, it breaks everyday almost and is too light weight. I spend more time fixing it than wearing it."
2.0,Not what I expected from the picture color and size.
2.0,Not the same item pictured. Still a decent item
2.0,After receiving this item I felt like I got a toy for my daughter. Not even used for a single day.
2.0,After a single plane ride it developed linear cracks on both sides of the external plastic shell.  This is a replacement  suitcase for another brand of similar design that failed in exactly the same way!<br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071GRSSFQ/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
2.0,"Loved this watch, however the clock hands came undone and was loose inside the watch. This happened after only wearing it just a few times."
2.0,"Chinese sizing, at least a size or more small"
2.0,This sunglass is slightly big for my 4-year-old boy. I also did not find the material of better quality.
2.0,The were not perfectly square. The color is fine. But they were mishapen.
2.0,"I thought the fabric with sparkles was great.  So I bought it.  Then, when I wore it, I bother me a lot, because I could see the sparkles under the cap.  So, it would have been perfect, if the maker used just plain fabric under the cap instead of using the same fabric with the shining stuff.  So, there!"
2.0,"This was so much smaller than I was expecting.  Smaller than a quarter.  Perhaps I should have paid more attention to the description, but even beyond the size, the color is this very strange orange dye.  Not natural looking leather at all."
2.0,"I thought these were the neoprene type face masks. I got one for each of my kids for skiing and sledding. When they arrived they were super cheap see through fabric that loses its stretch quickly. They are more of the bandana that can be a scarf, hat, etc. I probably didn’t read the description correctly but I was pretty disappointed."
2.0,😐 mm
2.0,Size was way too large.
2.0,Jacket is okay but not the same color as in the picture. I likes the gray going down the sides but the one I got doesn't have that. Just a gray stripe across chest and down inside of arms.
2.0,It was cheaply made. Looks ok and probably wot last too long.
2.0,The little beads keep falling out
2.0,"The actual shirt is a square box shape, not long and fitted like in the picture"
2.0,"looks to be pretty good quality but it's TINY. would not work in a tote or large purse, only a smaller purse or cross body."
2.0,Very poor quality but you get what you pay for.
2.0,Did like the fabric
2.0,Very small. I had to send it back because it was like a child size. It was really cool looking amee I wish it would have fit
2.0,"The bill of the hat is quality, however the rest to me is cheap and flimsy, See attached picture"
2.0,"Great looking glasses but I wear prescription glasses and these glasses are non script and they do not sit well over my regular glasses,."
2.0,"They are bent. The nose bridge seems to have been ""welded"" crooked. They don't sit well on my nose. I've tried to straighten them to no avail. I will not wear them. They just look stupid."
2.0,This is TINY.
2.0,Loved the idea of these but the waist is really low and the fabric is so light they kept falling down.
2.0,"The lace is gorgeous, and I love the double ribbons to tie it, but the eye holes are HUGE. I looked like an alien.... I’m returning the product because I honestly don’t know how I’d pull it off."
2.0,"Toddler 2-3 is smaller than expected. Fits for size 2 but not a 3. Didn't wash well, shrunk and not even dried."
2.0,I was very not happy with this product at all could not get it to fit my Gear 2
2.0,Very tight fit..... to the oint of being uncomfortable to wear.  It's not effective as a face covering if I don't want to wear it.
2.0,"Nice, funny design but turned out to be way too heavy. And they are clip-ons, not posts..."
2.0,"When it arrived it had fallen apart.... chains hanging straight down, charms missing, the glue that was supposed to hold the ribbon to the lace collar was defective and the ribbon had fallen off.  I have to redo the whole thing now.  Thank goodness it was so cheap.... you get what you pay for!"
2.0,I have only owned this two moths and a button already came off! The buttons aren’t even used they are decorative!!
2.0,Wayyyyyyy too small for my head :(
2.0,It took a month for this product to arrive and it’s not at all what it looks like in the picture.
2.0,It is a good product except the colors are WAY lighter in color then what was ordered. I like darker clothes and was pretty disappointed.
2.0,The wallet arrived on time and was in excellent shape.  I found it difficult to use as I'm a senior citizen.  I returned the wallet.  Maybe for the younger generation this would be a great wallet.
2.0,"Kinda a strange fit, but kept it."
2.0,It’s to baggy in the crouch. Plus you have to iron it after you wash it! Who wants to iron.
2.0,It looks cute but it should be from the dollar store. Not worth the money.
2.0,"The band is very short. It is probably ok for kids or women, but a guy will have difficulty even putting the watch on. I say this as a guy with fairly thin wrists too. I was also dismayed to find that it does not display the month, only the day. Typically not an issue, but still, cheesy."
2.0,"Good grip easy install, only lasted about a month before the left joystick on both controllers I used the replacements on collapsed, would not reccomend to others"
2.0,I lost a charm recently that was very similar to the K charm that I purchased here. Unfortunately the charm cannot be removed from the necklace and the necklace looks a little like play jewelry.<br /><br />I returned the item and will continue my search for the perfect letter K charm.
2.0,"Sleeves are too large, and don’t stay on shoulders. Very see through. Light green color actually looks more beige in person . Was totally hoping this dress was going to work, but the sleeves falling killed the whole thing."
2.0,way too big of frames
2.0,"I really wanted to like these because they are a super cute pattern. The fit is terribly odd... I’m 5’2” and they are too short for me. They also have a strange cut through the legs that makes them wide around the halves and hips but tight at the ankle and knees. As seen in other reviewers photos, the waist band is tight and the pelvis/hip area bags with too much fabric. Awkward to say the least. They are not worth the price you pay for them."
2.0,They are way way small I ordered a Large they fit like a small
2.0,I thouht it will fit me well but no. I ordered S and it's too big. And the person who sent it requested a sign and it took me four weeks to get it because I'm never home.
2.0,Very small!! This isn’t made for a man at all my husband had to give it to our daughter and it barely fit her.
2.0,There is no pins to attach to plaque or shirt. NOT REPRESENATIVE OF U. S. MILITARY STANDARDS
2.0,It's so pretty but way to small! Have too look for something else
2.0,Material of shirts feels cheep. Fits weird. Was expecting different material. Will not buy again. Very upsetting.
2.0,Rather itchy even after washing with fabric softener.
2.0,It was ok. Very cheap looking.But not a big deal for me. I am just giving the honest review based on what I received.
2.0,I did not like the fit.  They are at least a size smaller. Would not recommend.
2.0,This dress runs small-order one size larger.  Dress is a nice t-shirt dress.
2.0,Cute shirt but if you want it to fit I would order a size up. I’m returning mine as it’s to snug and short.
2.0,"Cut very small.<br /><br />Product fits more like a tailor made jacket,<br />or even a shirt.<br /><br />The make is fair quality, I just don't understand what man's physique the size chart is modeled from.<br /><br />The jacket is supposedly a 2X, but fits like a medium."
2.0,These aren’t ankle pants unless you’re 5’8 or over. I was swimming in them.
2.0,Cute shirt but the arm elastic is so tight that it was uncomfortable and left severe marks/ indents on my arms. Not comfortable and semi-see through. Too bad.
2.0,cute dress but its too small in the boob area :(
2.0,it held up pretty well until I put on my jacket!<br />it seem to me soldered on so it wasn’t very strong to begin with<br />i have a wedding to go tomorrow and now got to fix it with superglue :/
2.0,"neck on this top is not as big as pictured, its also shorter, and arrived with a snag on the chest. its ok i guess"
2.0,Tarnishes fast..only was able to wear it once.
2.0,"The arm sleeve stitch was undid when I opened the package, so there’s just a huge hole in the left arm.. Nice material though."
2.0,"Loved the style. Nice and long, good cowl neck line. HATED the fabric."
2.0,"I received the hat in a timely manner and the color was true to the picture. However, the hat is poorly made and completely crooked. The bill is extremely long and the fold where the bill meets the hat is not centered. It appears like the bill is longer on one side. The hat is definitely for super big heads. I have a big head and had to wear this hat on at its' tightest. I will only wear it in the backyard and not out. Definitely looks too awkward."
2.0,"The ""pearls"" do not look like this photo; they are so light they look almost dull white. They are also larger than those on the standard bracelets, and plastic-y looking. I was so looking forward to getting this and was disappointed when it arrived. Disappointed. Drat."
2.0,"The white one, too see through and don’t like the fabric."
2.0,"This add is mileading. It looks like you are getting a variety of leg warmers, but you actually only get one and its very thin. Not thick enough to be a ""warmer."""
2.0,"good for the nose, if worn minimally, but painful and leaves a sore on the lip. Only good for a pic or two."
2.0,Cheaply made. Loop broke second time worn.
2.0,"Like the look but so uncomfortable, there unwearable"
2.0,"The material is very thin. You can see through it.<br />I'm 34DD 4'10"" 27 waist"
2.0,"I’m 5’4”, weigh 138lbs and ordered a medium. These leggings are extremely tight and not faltering at all. They hug in all the wrong places. I’ll never order another pair again."
2.0,"I ordered two of these,and after a short time (weeks) one ring is fine and the other has lost half of its &#34;gems.&#34;  I contacted the seller who said they could do nothing because the ring had been worn... they would not stand behind their product.  You can get the same quality for $.99 numerous other places, as opposed to the $12 they are charging."
2.0,I do not recommend this steel band.  The steel pieces come loose and snag on shirt sleeves and blankets and any other fabric it comes in contact with.  It's also pretty sharp (as in ouch sharp).  I did not heed the warnings of the past reviewers.  Do not let the beauty of this product fool you.  I cannot recommend this product.
2.0,This dress did not perform well in the washer.  It shrunk and the hem turned up.  In order to make this dress look good..... I'd have to iron it.  I HATE IRONING. Don't buy this dress.
2.0,Sadly it is very small from panties to cup size they were not accurate to say the least. Super attractive just wish it fit.
2.0,Nice chain but very lightweight....too light for pendant I wanted to put on it.
2.0,"I purchased the A2-Camouflage Gray Nylon w/Black hardware in the 42/44mm size. I'm returning it.<br /><br />Pros - Seems to be well made. The black PVD hardware is nice. It fits my Apple watch just fine. I like the traditional watchband band clasp hardware over Apple's stud & hole.<br /><br />Cons - Color does not match the photo. I was expecting neutral gray white/black tones, more dark than light. What I received was a band with bluish gray and navy blue tones more light than dark. Don't like. Also the band is narrower than I would have expected for the wider watch. I'm a big guy and this looks like a women's watch on me. Its too narrow for the wider watch. I measure it at 22mm - or just under 7/8"" wide."
2.0,some of the earring arrived broken
2.0,It's a cute purse very nice. I was disappointed when I opened the box to find how small it was. Because in the picture makes it look bigger.
2.0,"Love the style, however these are really heavy for a toddler and they do run really small. My daughter wears a 7T and bought this size 9 and was pretty tight on the top of her foot. Had to return."
2.0,"I ordered lg in black and red. Black was great,  red was way too small"
2.0,"Cheap fabric, not very flattering. I ordered two different sizes and ended up sending both back."
2.0,Looks cute and nice but material is not good at all
2.0,Initially I loved it. It's quite pretty. But the chain broke the third day I wore it. I am not at all tough on my jewelry. I don't sleep or shower in it. I am very disappointed that I now have to have it repaired.
2.0,Far too small. My daughter is just growing into 10/12 (size I bought) but it fits like 7/8.
2.0,Disappointed with size. Thought it was bigger.
2.0,"I expected these to be a lot more plush and soft, however, they feel just like a soft towel. I purchased the blue pair and they are a lot brighter than I wanted them to be. I am not really satisfied with the purchase considering how much I paid, but, I am not going to go through the trouble of returning them considering they are just pajama pants. Overall, I would not recommend these."
2.0,"Pants run a bit small but still fit.  I don’t know if it’s because they fit a bit tighter or the way it was sewn together but my biggest problem with these pants is the grey and black coming together in the crotch area gives an embarrassing optical illusion of camel toe.  It’s not just me either, my friend and mom tried them on and it is the same thing.  Looks like camel toe."
2.0,This was maybe just me but it was way too big and bulky for my nose. It was also almost impossible to get it out without hurting and very hard to get in.
2.0,"This looks amazing. Makes any outfit shine. However. I have so far bought two of these. They have both broken. Sadly, I would love to have another but unfortunately won’t be spending the money a third time for it"
2.0,Small and rather boring.
2.0,"I so wanted to love these leggings. (I ordered small black.) They feel great, a little larger than expected but quite comfortable. Unfortunately, they are not even close to squat-proof (no matter what color underwear I try). NO WAY I could wear these in the gym. They show everything when I bend over. Sadly, I am returning them."
2.0,"These are some nice good googles. They fit my face perfectly and they are quite comfortable. But they are not anti fog. They were coated with an oily solution, however, once that solution washed out these glasses started to fog immediately and now I can't use them. I might have to buy some anti fog solution to be able to use them again. So while the glasses are good, I didn't like that they are advertised as anti fog."
2.0,Small. Order up.
2.0,"I ordered a large (I even took my measurements before buying just to make sure). I was so excited for these to come...but unfortunately I will be returning these. They’re packaged fine/nicely, but the shorts themselves are WAAAAAY too small... they say large on the packaging, but they must have a different idea about what “large” is, because these honestly feel like somewhere between a size small and a medium. Also, they say they are black, but they are actually a really light gray. Just beware before buying."
2.0,"Love the socks and the colors, but I only got to wear them like 2 or 3 times a piece and then the heels and toes wore out."
2.0,Husband and I both tried this on and it’s just a weird fit.  Very tight in the center and loose elsewhere.  Can’t imagine who would like the fit
2.0,"I have a 46&#34; chest, and I'm swimming in the XL. It's way too big."
2.0,"Don't like it at all, it is also kind of small in shoulders and upper arms."
2.0,"I bought the size 5/6 for my slim 5 year old daughter.<br />They are too small.<br />Great quality, but unfortunately, a waste of money to get underwear that she can't wear."
2.0,The color does not look like what the advertised picture looks like. I thought it would be dark gray on the arms but it’s actually blue!
2.0,The lenses are to big and look ridiculous.
2.0,It did not appear to be the dress I thought I was ordering.  It was stretchy and way to big. I normally wear a med but it fit more like a large.  I sent it back and it cost me $4.50 to send back to seller.
2.0,There was an unpolishable blemish.
2.0,"This dress was extremely unflattering for my curvy body shape. I was disappointed to find the buttons are decorative, not functional. The chest part might've been less constricted if I could've opened a button."
2.0,"These are good relaxed pants to wear on a warm day, the fit was too large for me, but I still wore them down to breakfast a couple of times on vacation and received compliments.<br />If you're ordering, buy a size smaller than you think you need."
2.0,Super see-through. Had to return
2.0,It look a lot nicer on-line than it does in reality.
2.0,"I'm top heavy, but small figured for the most part. I understand that I will have to go up in sizes at times to accommodate my shape/ size, so I got a large. My issue with the outfit was the pants weren't tight at the ankles. I also have pictures of how high they come up and if I don't pull them up, how droopy and unflattering they will be. It's a no for me."
2.0,Material is already pulling after a few washes and fading. Runs small.
2.0,"Lo que no me gusto del zapato, es Que se descalzan al caminar y eso es muy incomodo, pues el rosé puede hacer ampolla, son bonito y la parte delantera es cómoda"
2.0,It's 77 degrees outside and I got hot pulling weeds in the shade!  I thought for a minute I accidentally bought a workout shirt for winter.  This does not keep you any cooler than a cotton shirt.  Very disappointed and will not buy more.  I wear Nike Dri-Fit short sleeves and they are 100% cotton as well but they cool 10X better than this thing. It does run just a little bit small.
2.0,"These underwear tear very easily, so bad quality. The material and design is cute but I didn't use them a lot."
2.0,It is not
2.0,"I liked the watch , was comfortable to wear, stylish"
2.0,They look beautiful but run big and did not fit. I had to sand them down to side and after doing so was able to get them in.
2.0,"These shoes look super CHEAP. Payless Shoesource shoes look better. Thus, I'm very DISAPPOINTED!"
2.0,"The shirt fits perfect. I love the color, however the Nike symbol is not visible at all. The Nike symbol is the same color as the shirt. That is not what I expected or wanted. I returned the shirt."
2.0,TINY dress plus not blue & red - more like purple.  Purchased for play costume for teenager - not appropriate for anything more than adult halloween costume.
2.0,"I was very disappointed in this handbag. First it was larger than I expected, it should be listed as a tote bag. The quality was poor and the look online is very deceiving. When my husband made a comment about the bag, I know that something was wrong. He did not like it at all."
2.0,Too small.  Very open weave so it is not warm at all.
2.0,This product does nothing but fall off and take some hair with it. You can’t stick it to itself and it will rub off after about 5 minutes. You’re honestly better gluing cloth inside your helmets
2.0,Material is rough on the skin.
2.0,It looked nice but it's garbage.
2.0,"If you want to take your expensive watch and make it feel like a cheap watch this is the way to go. The touch screen is a thin wavy plastic. It is difficult to take on and off because of the 2 straps that hold down the band. Also the band does not stay under the straps. Even after diligently going step-by-step through their set up, it only held water out for a very short period of time."
2.0,Cute design but the quality sucks! It turned my wrist green (the bracelet)
2.0,Bought this for my 9 month old. Unfortunately she will never be able to wear it because they put the part to tie the know on the front of the skirt 😑
2.0,They break easily on the plastic frames
2.0,It is a beautiful ring. but it snags on everything.
2.0,It's a very heavy dress. I'm a 34D and I think medium may work best.
2.0,"It is a $5 ring did you really expect. It to be real silver, or even silver plated?!? It is a cute accent piece not to be worn everyday. Also if you paint it with clear top cote nail polish then it prevents it from wear and turning your finger green.<br />IT'S A $5 RING WHAT FO YOU EXPECT"
2.0,The ring was beautiful.... while it lasted the plating started wearing off in about 2 weeks. It would make a good temporary ring.
2.0,"I read the reviews so I ordered one size up, so instead of an XL, I purchased an XXL which was still very small. The bottom portion fit a little ok ( my butt is big so it stretched the waist out, but the belt helps cinch it slightly).  I'm an African-American woman , 5'4 and weigh 190. The buttons were a little stretched at the top. I had on spanx and a waist clincher so I thought it would fit better. I normally wear a size 14,  bra size 38D, so if you're a shapely big girl with hips, thighs, and boobs, I would suggest to go two sizes up. I couldn't wear it to the event because I received this product the same day. If I didn't care about my appearance, I would have worn it, but I can't go out looking like a Ball Park frank about to pop!! I only kept to because it's cute and will encourage me to lose a few pounds so it will fit nicely."
2.0,Such a beautiful set but within four months of purchasing and two months of actually wearing there are a few broken beads and the bead that is threaded for the clasp is broken in half.
2.0,"Have owned the HOFAM compression socks since late November and probably wear them once a week or so. Liked them very much initially, strong compression that I really needed, appropriate fit, and reasonably priced. Unfortunately, the pair may have had an manufacturing issue as both developed a hole in the area of the second toe. Just wish they would have lasted longer."
2.0,"Analog clock stopped working after 30 days so too late to return. Nice watch otherwise and fairly waterproof considering i barely took it off while I was at the beach for 10 days and showered every morning with it on. If I was you though, I would probably just buy the Casio Tough Solar for 10 bucks more. It should work for longer."
2.0,Tight in the thighs
2.0,Extremely thick not light and breathable
2.0,I thought i was getting  jersy capi leggings and they turned out to be  yoga pants! I don't remember seeing anything about yoga pants!
2.0,"The image on this shirt began to peel after the third washing. Its barely visible by a few bits hanging on after a handful of trips in the machine, disappointing, my son loved the shirt originally."
2.0,"Poorly made and be prepared for something that clings to you. I wear it over stretch capris for a nice enough look. But, must wear a camisole and a sports bra, so it is a rather warm outfit for the SW. All seams are raveling after 2 washes. Fairly disappointed in the quality."
2.0,"Used it for snowboarding, definitely not water resistant."
2.0,"I was so excited to take some summer photos of my daughter in this little romper, but WOW it's tiny. At least a 2T size when I had ordered a 4T. Having my daughter try it on was a laugh. Definitely not the size I had ordered. I had to pass it along immediately. The material is also extremely thin and cheap, which isn't exactly what I expected but would have dealt with if the item at least fit my kid."
2.0,I ordered this and Rothschild bib snow pants. I found the Rothschild pants were puffier while ixtreme pants seemed thin and not likely to keep my daughter warm in th snow. Ixtreme is much prettier and I liked the shoulder straps better but what's the point of snow pants if it doesn't keep you warm.
2.0,"2 years and done.  Shortly after the 1st year it started making funny noise, then at 2 years, it won't go on.  Construction seems cheap."
2.0,"I'm a 34A, and this was much too big up top. Also, the pink wasn’t as bright and pretty as on the picture. It was a shade that makes my olive skin look yellowish."
2.0,looks big. over priced for the quality
2.0,The part of the sleeve around the bicep is too small and doesn't have much stretch
2.0,"Nose clip is sewn too low on mask, so it is at or below tip of nose, not over the bridge, so poor seal. Bad fit. Too bad because fabric seems good."
2.0,"Cute prints and stripes but I bought a medium so it would have some swing. I am a 4/6 (5'6&#34;, 135#, 34A) in dresses so should have bought a small but went with guide. I returned as it was too large and not flattering"
2.0,"I really wanted to like this shirt however the size chart was way off / I believe the size chart is for Asian sizes, I ordered a large per the size chart and when I received the shirt it would not have even fit on my dog it was so small. Getting a refund was relatively painless /  a few emails back and forth and they agreed to refund for the shirts. Beware it is a long shipping time as it is coming from China."
2.0,"Color not as pictured. Also said true to size. I usually wear a M, would need a L in this. Shirt is like a spandex shirt, not cotton."
2.0,"This bracelet tarnished, and I was very disappointed!! It would have been nice if it didn't fade! It would be nice to maybe get it in different colors, like a black, red, white, or purple."
2.0,These are wack they’re made of some sort of  weird  spandex and they come in a generic bag look more like a Ziploc bag .  do yourself a favor and pass
2.0,"I'm only 5'3'' 120. The sleeve fit well around my biceps but the wrist band was too large and would ride up. I feel that they should be made a little longer. I would have to constantly pull the sleeve down to cover my arm. I used them everyday for two weeks until one tore, it was snagged on a ladder and by the end of the day the hole was about two inches in diameter."
2.0,Asian size. If fits you body reality then buy it. NOT for curved and not starved women.
2.0,"Cheap, fell apart the first time I wore it.  Got my money back."
2.0,Didn't keep this one!
2.0,"Unfortunately, I didn't check before buying and when I needed to return them because I had purchased the wrong size, it cost almost half as much as I paid in the first place."
2.0,"The set of scarves seem to be of good quality. Unfortunately, there were not the color I ordered so I will not actually be using them. Due to shipping constraints (30 miles to nearest UPS drop-off; price to have it picked up to return), I will not be exchanging them nor will I re-order because I have no guarantee I'll get the correct color. If you want to gamble on getting the color you ordered, the quality appears to be good & the price for a set of 2 is good as well."
2.0,The belt is NOT 1 3/4&#34; wide but 1 3/8&#34; wide.
2.0,"Coarse and stuff material, not as pictured"
2.0,Did not work upon arrival. Thought batteries were bad and replaced them - still did not work. Took the wand apart and put it back together again. Started working after pushing button in very hard. Cute enough wand and my daughter is enjoying it but still has its flaws with the on/off button.
2.0,This dress is really cute but it stinks so bad!!! Everything that shipped with it stinks as well. I don't know why this dress smells so horrible it had my entire two story home smelly. I don't even think washing it will help. This bad baby is on its way back!!
2.0,"Was going to be a gift for my wife, but piece was barely the size of a dime.  It gets lost on any necklace or chain."
2.0,"Not great...runs REALLY small and quality not terrific. But, it's inexpensive and trendy, so who cares? If you want a hat like this to last, spend more."
2.0,It's not great.  Rolls up and slides up all day long.  It is not comfortable at all.
2.0,"This dress is gorgeous and fit me really well and the only reason I give it 2 stars because I can't wear it anymore...I washed it BY ITSELF in cold water--nothing crazy here--and all the red pigment just bled all over so basically that's $18 wasted. Yeah it was cheap, but it was so pretty that I expected to wear it all the time and now I have to throw it out. Very disappointed."
2.0,Received today. Correct size but strange residue on and around the plug. Will not wash off with mild soap and hot water.  Very disappointed in purchase.
2.0,It's comfortable but pockets are half sewn shut
2.0,I really liked the skirt but I am returning it because it's too long for me and fit is not flattering.
2.0,"I was excited to get this because it showed a picture of a phone fitting in it. The length is fine for phones, but width and height is not. You cannot close the wallet once an iPhone is in."
2.0,Good for what I needed which was to later however it rusted in a day...
2.0,I bought this shirt in a 2xl and it's more of an xl it's not long enough to cover my butt to wear with leggings and it's pretty tight to it's very disappointing
2.0,"T-Shirt fabric, looks cheap. It was a good price. I will not order again."
2.0,I wore it one week and it didn’t want to keep closed.
2.0,"The buttons were a light color and the size was very small, I had to give it away."
2.0,"Way down in the product description it says &#34;Due to manual measurement, it allows 1-2(cm) discrepancy&#34;. This is an understament, I picked a medium shirt and nearly Hulked out of it, I mean it was so tight across my back I could not move my arms forward.  rather than put teh warning on the description how about the seller actualy gets the correct measurments and use them on site. I paid for next day delivery as I am going into Hospital and wanted something to wear to feel more up beat,and now I have to pay for it to go back. Quality did look good, colour was a little darker. I then ordered the Large size, the sleeves were a little long but stull too snug across my back. If I was sure that the x-large would fit me I would order that, but I'm sure if I would be left needing a between size and more hastle returning it."
2.0,Read the reviews and size instructions but the item was way too big
2.0,With the exception of the rounded top is too tight
2.0,"The quality is not what I expacted. Can't put my finger on it but it feels cheap,"
2.0,Loved the style but they are very small. I bought a larger size expecting them to run small but I couldn't pull them over my hips.
2.0,Pants ripped when she first put them on
2.0,"It is a cute top, however, there was a serious problem with sizing. I got the black size large and at a 34c the top was way-way-way too small in the breast area. The top and bottom hems fit nicely, however, the breast area just squished down. I couldn't even lace it up properly without something popping out. I am starting to think the bust sizing may be at the fullest part and not the band size as I assumed. A smaller chest may have made this top look cute if not a bit strange due to the sleeves."
2.0,The material is very rough not soft at all and this shirt runs small
2.0,"The green color is pretty, but the fit of the top is not as pictured. It is tight around the hips which makes the rest of the top not hang right."
2.0,Super cute stitch band… unfortunately after a few weeks the leather ripped
2.0,Rated low because the one I ordered showed up and one of the zippers was broken.
2.0,Description indicates this is kids/adults. This sizing is toddler at best.
2.0,The top was definitely not of a better quality. I did not have to open it up to see that. Not for me.
2.0,The glasses are sturdier and thicker than they appear in the pictures
2.0,Bottom not right form and not supportive.  Rough insides hurt toes.
2.0,"I bought this set for the metallic finished ring. Rings arrived on Saturday. After 2 days the &#34;metallic&#34; coating has started to blister and peel away. I didn't  wear this ring while being particularly active. It looks great and fits awesome, but I'm unhappy with the &#34;metal&#34; finish peeling off. I can't recommend because of that."
2.0,"The boots are great but my son only wore them for half an hour before one of the brass tacks holding them broke. He was just walking, nothing out of the ordinary, he’s only two. Not sure if its defective or just to be expected. Super disappointed though as he was SO excited to receive them and they didn’t even last ONE day :("
2.0,The person I gave this watch was embarrassed to let me know it stopped working after a few months. Rather disappointing. Outside of the exchange/return window. Putting in a new battery did not work. I don’t recommend this watch
2.0,To wear!
2.0,It was to big and to thin
2.0,So disappointed. These are nothing like the cotton stretch I bought before from Bali.  Waistband and leg elastic are not covered in fabric.  I don't like them. I want the old style back:(
2.0,"Super comfortable in fit, but extremely itchy. Didn't realize these were nylon. Nylon on my skin is very itchy, couldn't stand it. The color is nice, a rich black color. And they seem like they'd stay up as I work out but unfortunately they didn't work out."
2.0,It did not fit my Galaxy 3 watch. But I didn't realize there were 2 different sizes!...
2.0,"Very soft material, but very dual colors and looks like it's been worn alot. Wouldn't recommend"
2.0,"I love the shirt, but the seam at the neck started to come apart after first wash."
2.0,The legs get caught in everything and at this point one of the legs kept getting bent so much it broke off. Very sad about it. Over all Still a beautiful piece.
2.0,They are not what I was expecting.
2.0,Ordered a small and it fits like an XL. Fabric is soft but it's a pajama shirt now!
2.0,"There is nothing I like about this sweatshirts. It's much shorter than shown. Barely covers my hips, and the pockets are at my waist. The CREW neck is more like a scoop neck. If you're about 5'2"" tall, it might work for you. I won't be wearing this. When did manufacturer's start making crew necks so large? A crew neck is supposed to fit your neck - not hang down about 4 inches."
2.0,Screw came on loose multiple times after tightening it it now sits on my desk as a decoration
2.0,Kept falling out. Dropped one and it cracked into a million pieces.
2.0,"Too tiny, too cheap looking"
2.0,"So disappointed... I order this dress in the peachy scallop style and when I took it out of the package the material was not what I expected.<br />Definitely feels like a clingy, synthetic, stretchy rash guard material. Wasn’t flattering, especially on my upper arms and back. Underwear lines for days, ladies. Returned and haven’t purchased anything else from this seller knowing it will probably be more of the cheaply printed design on crappy material."
2.0,Broke after 2 months of occassional use
2.0,Adjustable Waist Trimmer Belt<br />Separated inside disappointed.
2.0,I thought hard about this purchase and was very disappointed for what I paid. I purchased the olive solid colored dress. The material was t-shirt thin and not suitable for fall/ winter. I posted a picture of the fabric unstretched and up to the light. This dress is being returned. Definitely not worth $29. This dress is fine for summer.
2.0,Holes were made as I gently put them on--cheaply made
2.0,Too short and smaller than expected
2.0,It arrived tangled between the saucer and one of the nacelles and I broke the chain trying to get it out.
2.0,"sent back, strange feeling fabric"
2.0,If you are looking for gloves that are easy to get your toddlers hands into these are not it. They looked like they would be but they are not. The Velcro wrap really does nothing. Nice gloves but not easy to put on a toddler.
2.0,"Ehhh... I ordered two pairs of sunglasses. I know you get what you pay for, but the one I got from zero UV for about the same price blew this pair away. The arms weren't very straight and didn't flex, but you kinda have to break them to fix them. Also, they're bigger than normal sunglasses. My pair is kind of for show now, but at least they still look nice"
2.0,"You are definately getting not what you pay for. The quality of this shoe is mediocre. It lacks any kind of support on the sides of the foot as the fabric is thin.<br />We have had the shoes for a week. My son has worn them three times and he says he feet are tired.<br />Thankfully my son is not extra hard on his shoes so hopefully these will last a little longer for special functions, as the best part of the shoe is the dressy-sneaker look.<br />Def worth the price and not a penny more."
2.0,"I ordered pants size XL, in both green and purple. When I removed pouches, it was immediately evident, that the green pouch was heavier, containing more fabric than the purple pouch. The green XL pants are appx 2 inches longer than the purple ones.  Both plastic pouches say XL on them. However, the pants have NO size tags inside, to know what they really are.  I really wear size M, 5’8”(but mostly legs),waist appx 27, hips appx 37, but heeded the warnings, and ordered 2sizes up. Concerned that multiple reviewers report shrinkage during washing even by hand, I need both pants to be XL. I contacted merchant.<br />The colors are nice and vibrant. The fabric is modal. I’m not a fan of this type of fabric, but it works for this style. They do have sort of a crotch weggie, which I can better hide in the larger looser pair. The workmanship would be good if not for the irritating loose strip of elastic twisting and swimming around  in the band. A better job should have been done at waist. I like design. and will still consider keeping."
2.0,Purchased these...they arrived. and i am not impressed.<br />the sizing guide is not accurate at all. I purchased large size. the waist is not 32-35...maybe 36-38.<br />the draw string is front designed like boardshorts. AKA not all the way around your waist.<br />More of a sizing issue on my part more than anything else. I plan to purchase a smaller size and go from there. everything else was nice minus that sizing issue.
2.0,Giving this two stars cuz it is very pretty and nice thin summer material but... it’s way too small (at least 3 sizes too small!). I can’t even pull it over my head. Unfortunately I will need to return it.<br />If the sizing was accurate I would’ve gave 5 stars.
2.0,Maybe it’s the size of my wrist...but this watch band DOES NOT work for me. I would not recommend.
2.0,"Just received this yesterday. I didn’t even get a chance to wear it out. Only wore it for a short time around the house. I noticed while wrapping it around my head that there was damage on the scarf. The scarf is SUPER thin. Not very good quality, and certainly not worth the prices."
2.0,The pattern is adorable. The ruffles are sweet and whimsical. But if you have a large chest forget about it. I wish this dress fit because it’s decent quality and fits in all the right places except the bust.
2.0,"These are only ""women's"" socks for women with very skinny legs.  The pattern is printed on the relaxed fabric.  Once you try to put them on, the pattern distorts and looks faded.  And the socks won't fit someone like me who has larger calves.  I would not buy these again or recommend them."
2.0,Wheel broke after 1st use at airport.  Maybe a manufacturing defect.  Company to replace.  Will give it another chance.
2.0,"The belt is stamped with ""Genuine Leather"" and ""Made in USA.""  The description only says that the liner is Full Grain leather.  I'll see how this belt holds up compared to other belt's I've owned but I'm a bit disappointed that Genuine Leather was never mentioned once in the description."
2.0,run rather small and quality is margional.
2.0,"Felt is pretty low quality and hat is flimsy.  There was visible glue on the felt and the glue had bled through to the other side, gluing the hat to itself."
2.0,Beautiful but the petals fall off very easily.
2.0,Cute but fabric is so thin you could all the cellulite on my legs and thighs even though they weren’t tight.
2.0,Was not forming to my body at all and I bought a small. Had to return. I’m 5’4 110lbs
2.0,"These would be perfect if not for a thick, tight band at the top. They look like full length workout leggings I have from another brand, but once I put them on, I realized how different they were. The legs and butt and stomach all fit great, perfect even. But the band at the very top is way too tight and hurts. I am very disappointed in them, and I never had a chance to wear them until the return period had passed due to an injury. If you have a less squishy middle, it might be fine for you. I'm very squishy right now, so it hurts my insides when I try to wear them.<br /><br />The color is perfect, a tad bit more vibrant than pictured."
2.0,"Looks nice, but it was cheap material."
2.0,These say they are one size....one size if you foot is on the smallish side.  I wear a 10 and they weren't even close to fitting.
2.0,I will not buy another: fabric sticks to skin from sweat and it does not wick sweat away
2.0,"Wayyyy too small. I thought I ordered a pair of children's shorts on accident. Also, have to pay to return them. May have tried a large if returns were free, but I will not be ordering again."
2.0,"Does not work as sunglasses, light reflect back into my eyes when wearing them . It's cheap!"
2.0,"The pattern and skirt length were great, but waist was small, and it flared out strangely at the hips like it was designed for someone with odd hip implants. Would have been better to make it elastic waist and eliminate the weird flare at the hips."
2.0,The vizor its not straight the side with the 48 sign on it is not stiched wright.
2.0,"This product and is waste of money, baby is unable to crawl and sometime looses balance. The top and bottom elastic is of not good quality and causes mark even if baby has put on for 5-10 mins."
2.0,"this dress is a little blah for it to be so revealing. Thr color blue and/or the material make it look cheap (sorry only word i could use) and between the slit all the way up and the cut out side its a lot bit too much for a teenager going to prom!!! to each their own on that part that is just my opinion. but neither of my girls would be wearing it out of the house until they were grown grown and then their deddy still better not see them lol but fr. and we are not prudes by any means (h**l if i could fit the dang thing i would keep it for one of our date nights in/dress up nights wink wink) but unfortunatly im not small enough to get into it nor would it be very attractive with my pudge hanging out the side lol not a good site at all. wish i had a better review for it but i don't  not for me or us but it maybe for someone  im not here to judge anything but the products and this one got 2 stars only because it is almost as pictured. but not really there was no rouching (spelling) on the front, the side hole as much larger, the back of it was unfortunatly the same as pictured just blah, and the color was the same it just looked cheaper. the dress was sewn very well at least but thats about all it had going for it.  if the slit didnt reveal as much, if the side was cut out as pictured and didn't show so much of your stomach side and back, and if the material was of a higher quality and maybe some jewels or something around the neckline or up the slit line something to make it pop and not so blah in the back then it might get a better rating and review from me but until then sorry"
2.0,"The little ""rods"" were bending turns out it's just plastic barely lasted 3 days unfortunately I had Faith in it for a good moment but nope I was proved wrong,<br />That's a shame."
2.0,The size is not accurate! I needed accurate sizing. The base width is barely 5 1/4 inch. Not 6.3 inches! Overall seems decent enough quality but the size advertised on the Large bag is not correct. Doesn't work for what I needed it for.
2.0,Pensé que la tela era de mejor calidad.  Acá en Panamá encuentro blusas similares a 7 dólares y su calidad es mejor.  Me desagradó pagar tanto más lis gastos de envio por un producto de baja calidad
2.0,The bracelet is very pretty but has a terrible smell.  I will return it if the smell doesn't  go away in a couple of days.  I will never buy anything that is made in China again !
2.0,"This product has the potential to be effective, but is poorly designed.  The nose and mouth holes are way too small.  The neck is too loose.  I can sew so modified it and use it to protect my face while I swim.  Even with my modifications it's not great, but better than nothing."
2.0,Prettier in person.  I have a 6 inch wrist and it fits me perfectly.  If you have a bigger wrist it may be too tight.
2.0,"I don't know how anybody could call this a sweater, or even a sweatshirt, or even a t-shirt! It's made out of some extremely thin, and very slick material. It feels more like a bathing suit than like any kind of normal shirt or sweatshirt, it's so slick and cold. I guess you could use it for Christmas if you live in the tropics, but anywhere that has actual winter weather, this shirt would be a joke. It's not just the thinness, it's the swimsuit feel that really throws me off and feels extra cold and uncomfortable in winter weather. The colors are bright and the print is fun, but that's all there is to it. My kid refuses to wear this because we don't have swimsuit weather over here in December."
2.0,I like to return
2.0,"These look cute, and they were purchased for a costume for drama class. However the lense is not clear and creates a very distorted view<br />So I’m possible to wear as an accessory for any length of time."
2.0,I’m so disappointed. I paid for expedited shipping which was still super late but i took the chance. The dress is not remotely similar to the picture shown and it does not compliment my body at all. the sparkles make it look pink. Do not buy this especially if you’re on a crunch.
2.0,Fabric is not as shown
2.0,Material is more spandex...doesn't fit like the picture at all
2.0,Dress looked so cute in the pictures but when in person...just looked very large and shapeless.<br />Often sizing with Modenmiss is irregular.  Mediums could be fine in one garment & in another too large or too small.<br />Nice quality but sizing is an issue.
2.0,The material is cheaply made.
2.0,Mu daughter wore it once just to take photos and within the hour that she had it on it ripped on both sides by the waist! Shes a pretty petite one year old and i got size 18 months because i read that it ran small and the size seemed to fit her well.  The outfit is very cheaply made but It does look cute.  If i had known how poorly made this was i would have skipped buying it.
2.0,"The product was too long, ad I could have used a 1X instead of a 2X."
2.0,The fabric is thick. The peplum is made of something like sofa lining. It does look extactly like the picture  I am a size 12 needed to order xxl
2.0,"See thru😳, very disappointed."
2.0,Cute be it is not true to size
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress. It has a very flattering fit and pockets! But as soon as it arrived I was concerned about the material. When something is 100% polyester you never really know what you’re going to get because polyester can be made so many ways. This dress is a thick stretchy polyester, and started pilling immediately upon my first wearing. Any thing that rubs against the fabric causes this. You can clearly see in my pic what has happened after only wearing a handful of times. Very disappointing."
2.0,"Eh, I'm not a fan.  The top part of the dress is nice, but the skirt part is stiff and unflattering.  This dress needs a skirt with some movement, or at least have it fitted better."
2.0,"The good stuff....The color is great, though MUCH darker than pictured, and it's super cute. I bought this for Easter. The problems...the hemline is off on one side in the front and in the back (see pics). There was no tie/belt like in the picture, either, which makes the dress look  unfinished. Plus, there are strings from the inner seam that were sewn over from the inside now on the outside, but those were easily cut off. I had high hopes for this dress, and bought accessories to match, but now I'm not sure I can wear it, as the hemline is absolutely awful, and is especially noticable against the petticoat beneath it. I am going to be returning it, and buying something else, hopefully close to the same color so I can use the same accessories. Unfortunately, I can't recommend this dress."
2.0,"Do Not order your size!!!  I ordered SO because I like very loose sweatshirts.  Not only did it not fit but, gave to my 12 yr old granddaughter.  Geesh!"
2.0,Sent them back. Too small and didn't have anything behind the zipper to protect you from pinching your leg when zipping them.
2.0,Very bland. Too large. Doesn’t stay closed. Not an attractive look at all. Returning.
2.0,Doesn't look anything like the picture. Looks too cheap
2.0,When I got this shirt the fabric was so cheap and ugly I didn't even try it on.
2.0,Mui grande a si arriba
2.0,Clothes run very small. Arms are too tight as the top as wel. I normally wear a medium and I ordered large.
2.0,Size way too small.  7 fit like 5
2.0,Order my regular size should have went a size up
2.0,"Awesome print, but a really poorly fitting shirt. I’m an athletic build XL all day, and this shirt doesn’t even come close to fitting properly. It happened to be really tight in the back, short in the torso, and really loose in the sleeves (I happen to have big arms, so most XL shirts are actually snug in the sleeve), so this one is going back."
2.0,"Cute but didn’t last . The material came undone after one week of wear The material inside the boot is a faux fur lining , very fuzzy  . I don’t think I will buy these again because I was looking for somethijg that would last."
2.0,I purchased this for my 7 year old daughter. She does not like how quickly the color fades after being charged by light. Both balls are very close in color unless charged. This was not made clear in the description. The blue color shown in this picture is not the color of the ball inside the locket unless charged by light and in the dark.
2.0,This product was really small. I bought it to wear under an ugly sweater vest for Christmas. The garment didn't cover half of my bottom and the length on the arms barely came to my wrists. I ended up guy having it to my little sister who was 11 at the time and she was able to wear it as a dress with tights.
2.0,These shoes are not true to size.  The size 8 was more like a size 7.  The arch support was about an inch in front of my actual arch.
2.0,"Easy to use, looked really nice. But broke a few weeks later. And only wore minimally."
2.0,"I purchased these for my mito red light therapy and they did a very poor job of blocking the light.  I also purchased FreeMascot UV and Red Laser Safety Glasses for Typical 405nm, 445nm, 650nm and Infrared Laser Light, and these worked much better at blocking red light!  I would not buy these glasses for red light therapy (but the other glasses instead).  For comparison I included a picture of these glasses (on the left, not blocking the light well) and the other glasses that I mentioned (on the right, showing a much better job at blocking the red light).  I also included my red light therapy side profile."
2.0,"I took my measurements with a sewing tape measure so that they would be exact and ordered based on their sizing chart but it is too big so I would recommend ordering a size smaller. Material is very stretchy, heavy and hot, not as “flowy” as it looked in the pictures. Unfortunately I don’t have time to send it back and order something different because the event that I bought it for is in two weeks ☹️"
2.0,Wht! How is this sized? The small is more like an xl.
2.0,Dress style is great but fabric is super cheap polyester and feels terrible and cheap
2.0,"Broke when dropped on car seat, landed softly and frame broke.  No info to contact for seller."
2.0,"The dress is way too big (and I sized down based on other reviews), the fabric is very heavy, and the neck hole is so small you can barely get your head through. Very disappointing. Returned."
2.0,ugly..... it doesn't look like the picture
2.0,Way to big and bulky! Doesn't look too cheap though!
2.0,"This dress is beautiful and decent quality for the price.  Mine arrived with a tear in one of the seams.  Also, was a little snug in the hips I normally wear large and size 12 pants, ordered a large but the satin material is not forgiving on my hip area.  I will be returning."
2.0,It fell apart after one delicate wash. 😢
2.0,"far too small, does not have anything to do with american sizes. Next time I will check the source country and if it is produced in the far East, I will not order."
2.0,This product stretches but very lil. It’s very tight to get over your head and it’s very uncomfortable to wear.
2.0,They don’t stick very well but looked cute enough to try.
2.0,The innermost hole is at 38.5&#34; and the outermost hole is at 42.5&#34;. This WILL NOT fit anyone sized less than an XL.
2.0,Not sure who they're measuring to come up with the sizes. Runs very small.
2.0,These did not seem to be the same quality of my 7 other pair of Toms. They seemed cheap and made of plastic (&#34;Leather&#34;).  The tonge stated made in china and no where on them did it say what the material actually was. The bottom are also plastic - not the rubber of most toms. Very disappointed.
2.0,"The beanie itself is very soft and warm. It covers my head as it should instead of covering my entire head like most beanies I owned (I have a smaller head then most people :P ). The problem I have is with the headset. It. Would. Not. Turn. On. When I read the manual, it said that a red indicator light would show that its charging. My beanie doesn't show any light. There's no red or blue to show that its on. I thought maybe the light itself was broken, so I looked at my phone to see if it was on. It wasn't. I wasn't happy with this, but it was for 12ish dollars so what did I expect? I guess I could use it as a beanie instead."
2.0,"If you're a larger chested person, this definitely runs tight around the bust. Order at least one size up."
2.0,"Nice watch, however it does not look like the watch advertied."
2.0,"Pockets are very bulky and stick out funny. Otherwise, it is beautiful."
2.0,"Loved the top,just wasn't sizedoing right"
2.0,"I ordered an XL due to my normal size. Stretchy material, but not a loose fit by no means. On the fence about ordering a XXL."
2.0,Backs came off so we lost one in 2 days. Not sure why_how it came loose enough to come off but I won't buy again.
2.0,"Seems to work, but they have already broke..... so I don't know that I would buy again"
2.0,Top was perfect  but the bottoms where to big
2.0,These look much smaller in person and are of very poor quality.  I don't recommend anybody to purchase these as they will not be content with them.
2.0,I would not buy them again. I don't like the fabric.
2.0,"The item color turned in a matter of days, it looks very rusty"
2.0,"Seller response was fine.  But product is very hard to use; it takes a long time to get the earring post through it.  It is too tiny, and the hole in it is also too small for the wires to find it and fit through easily.  I have used much better versions of this product which came with the earrings."
2.0,Cheap material. The shirt was to small and the pants were to big. When it came it looked like someone wore it and smacked it in a bag. 2/10.
2.0,You get what you pay for. Save you money
2.0,"No way to adjust the supports,and no grips to hold it on the bridge of your nose, so they are too loose and slip around."
2.0,Fabric is nice and soft but it feels like the spandex shorts inside are a size smaller than the shorts on the outside.
2.0,"I love photography, but I have an old neck and upper back injury, and the weight of my camera hanging from my neck limits the amount of time I can spend with my camera. I was very excited about this double shoulder camera strap. I intended to hang my camera from one side, and one of my lenses (which has a tripod mount) on the other side.<br /><br />My family spent the day at an amusement park last week. I decided to leave my gear in the car for most of the day, and grab it just before sunset. I got to my car and excitedly pulled this out. I immediately realized there was no paperwork at all included - no instructions or even a photograph that I could go by. I had no reception on my phone, so I couldn’t pull up the page on Amazon to see if there was anything on there that could help.  After 10-15 minutes I still couldn’t figure out how to use it, so I ditched it and ran back through the parking lot and amusement park, to the area where the park was meets the lake. By this point I had missed the beautiful sunset. I was so disappointed.<br /><br />Back at home the following day, I again took the strap out and tried to set it up. This time I was not under a time crunch, and I had the benefit of being able to load Amazon. I was able to figure out how to mount the camera, but have no clue still how to get it to fit properly. There are screws and straps that I don’t know what their purpose is. When I put this on, the camera hangs on my side, with the lens stick straight out, rather than in front of me, where I can keep it from banging into anything.<br /><br />It’s a shame because this seems to be made really well. With instructions, this might be an excellent product. As it stands though, I can’t figure it out, so I will be returning it."
2.0,"We gambled on this given that it only had two reviews but it’s too cheaply made given the price (we bought the rolling backpack). I’m confident it would fall apart after a month of use and we can spend the same amount of money for a different brand we know will hold up. My daughter is disappointed because she loves the look of it and if it was half the price we’d maybe keep it, but unfortunately we are going to return it."
2.0,The design is pretty good. It mostly looks like the image. The material feels nice. The fit on the shirt is really awkward. I ordered my usual size and it clubs to me like it had separation anxiety.<br />My daughter wears it to sleep.
2.0,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT :(
2.0,"The darkest they ever got, in the full hot Texas sun, was a very transparent yellow color. Basically they are blue blockers."
2.0,I ordered both the tan and grey coats; ended up returning both.<br />There's not much structure to these jackets... they look like short bathrobes.
2.0,"I was really disappointed with this dress, I definitely wanted to like it more. The top was see through, to start. It also was sewn in a really junky way. The stripes did not match up on the sides, so the stripes across the front, were mismatched to the ones on the back, like someone wasn't even trying when they sewed it together. Also, part of one of the stripes was sewn into the waistband of the skirt, but only a portion of it, so it looked very skewed and crooked. The skirt was a nice heavy quality though and the dress is form fitting and nice, but the top was so flimsy and poorly sewn together, it made it look ridiculous."
2.0,"It's not very clear in any of the reviews or &#34;size chart&#34; how loose and large these actually run. Some reviews say they do run large some say they don't. I just went with my gut. I'm 150lbs and 5'6. That said, my chest is 36G and the Large is still big.. Huge actually. I'm going to wash it to see if it takes a little shrink. The quality is really nice, it's very good quality but again, it does run big, not like loose big, like oddly big and the flare at the bottom is way too much flare. I would suggest a cami or tank top underneath because it isn't friendly to rolls. 😂<br /><br />Update: washed still awkward shaped"
2.0,"These masks are great quality and we love the prints, but the masks are ENORMOUS compared to all the other masks we’ve bought. They’re bigger than most of the adult masks we’ve bought in the last 2 years. Super disappointed that they won’t work for my 5 year old."
2.0,Bought for my wife she says they are tight and hard to get on not like the others she's gotten in the past.
2.0,"You get what you pay for, the quality is pretty bad and I can hear it breakin when I put it on and take it off..."
2.0,Cheap material... interesting design and good color.
2.0,Size was great.....quality is very poor
2.0,"I wanted this to fit so badly but no such thing. I bought the biggest size offered because I read it ran small and still didnt fit over my hips. I am 5'5&#34;, 220 and normally wear an XL or size 16."
2.0,Wore it one day and the dress balled and pilled really bad where your butt sits on furniture.<br />It is very thin fabric.<br />The color was as expected and the fit was perfect.<br />Only a one time wear...
2.0,"Too long.  Baggy around the waist.  Fits my chest alright, but doesn’t accentuate it.  Overall, I just didn’t find them very flattering."
2.0,If you looking for a dress this is a 2 piece... And the top seems to run small
2.0,"thin fabric, comes in super small"
2.0,The gloves came apart the first time I wore them and the hat is oddly cone shaped.
2.0,"The description states that this is a magnetic clasp on this necklace, but it is not a magnetic clasp you have to push the button to open it. Also the description said it’s a thin rope style that chain in leather but it’s actually a lot thicker than the description. It’s too thick to go in the bail on any of my necklaces! You might want to pass this one up, it’s not worth the money"
2.0,"Liked the material, but fit small. Ordered large and fit more like medium"
2.0,"I mean... you get what you pay for. They feel extremely cheap because they are cheap. The top of the glasses look deceivingly straight on the pictures, but they definitely arch giving it a more  feminine look. I expected them to be exactly what they are, but unfortunately I won’t be wearing them as they look girly... even then it’s too much of an arch."
2.0,Starting to turn my skin green around hole...
2.0,So-so.. it’s quite thin so need to wear something underneath.
2.0,"It's a an okay dress. Very cheap material. You are definitely getting what you paid for in price, maybe over price. I'd wear it out at night cause it is sexy, and at night it's too dark to tell how cheap looking it is. But it is a  sexy dress with the slit and backless structure."
2.0,Nice colors. Nice fit. Won't last long.
2.0,This belt is TINY!! It says 32 inches but it doesn’t even fit me and it definitely wouldn’t have fit him. It’s actual measurements are 26.5” so unless you’re buying this for the world’s scrawniest middle school boy- save your money.
2.0,Ooh pic looks bigger
2.0,I ordered 2 rings in which they are beautiful ! One came to me Broken ! I’m Not A Happy Camper
2.0,I’ll be more careful ordering
2.0,"Disappointed! The hat was small, the #3 was basically a cheap sticker, and it was made of thin material. Had originally bought as a present for family, but would have been embarrassed to give it to them."
2.0,"I purchased 4 of this brand's masks - two floral, and two black ones - one for me, one for my husband. The floral ones are excellent, and I wear them all day, every day at work. The black ones unfortunately are made from a different fabric that's too thick. They aren't as breathable as the floral ones, and therefore, just aren't comfortable. The design and style is great; just needs a lighter fabric. And while you'd think thicker fabric is more protective, and maybe so, I wear the lighter, floral ones every day and work with two people in very close proximity in my office who both got sick with COVID (neither were wearing masks) and I did not catch it; so it's worked very well for me."
2.0,Way too small. Disappointed:(
2.0,Cuts weird in the breast area.  Never wore
2.0,"Really cheap and very hard material; does not flex much. I only wear these at the gym locker room to/from the showers, so they serve their purpose, but if I wore them for longer than that I think they would cause blisters."
2.0,I wear n it was ripped not satisfied
2.0,"These are not anti-fog as described. They were a great fit and comfortable, very light as described. Unfortunately they fogged as soon as I put them on. So I placed back in the package and returned them. Easy returns and prompt refund."
2.0,Needed to order a bigger size than my normal size
2.0,"I purchased this sweater because I love the cuffs on it. However it not impressive on. I ordered an xl and should have gotten a large. I’m 5’5 and have curves,not fat. The shoulders on the sweater are slanted which makes a different fit. It doesn’t look much like the picture depicts. It’s almost a box look on me. A turtleneck or scarf may help with appearance. Not Impressed with it though.🙁"
2.0,Huge skirt. The best way to explain the skirt is that it stays like an umbrella when you put the dress on. Nice fabric and exact colors as shown in the pics though.
2.0,not great quality even for being lower end. almost only a one time use quality
2.0,The Sizing is off at least 1 if not 2 sizes comparative to U.S.A. sizes for sure. I ordered an XXL and its between a large and XL comparative to a standard U.S.A. Size fit.
2.0,"It was perfect, until after I washed them. They all shrunk in the washer (did not put them in the dryer) a child sized mask is what I ended up with."
2.0,These run way too small in the length and waist.
2.0,These wings a very pretty and of good quality. It also has nice straps at the shoulders & hands/wrists<br /><br />I rated it so low because it is not as shown at all. They are wide & narrow and not nearly as long as shown (they look like the lower portion are missing from the wings). They also do not have any waist straps so it constantly moves in the back in all directions. I will have to sew a strap in myself.
2.0,As cute as this is it’s not meant to hold up over time. I’m the kind of girl who’s super lazy with their jewelry so I like to wear stuff I don’t have to take off and goes with everything unless it’s a special occasion. I’ve had this maybe like a month and part of the yellow is coming off. If you guys are worried about it turning your skin green it will not. But I bought another necklace for this price and was sterling silver and have had it for years without it breaking or anything rubbing off. If you take this on and off everyday this necklace will be perfect for you. I just expected the yellow sunflower part to not wear off so soon only having it for a month.
2.0,"The smell was horrid. I ordered the dark green one and it smells like they used moldy swamp algae to dye it. That along with the extreme wrinkles and concerns on how they would smooth out, I had to return it. Otherwise, I ordered an XL. At 5'9"" and 190lbs, it fit perfectly. The armpits did not sag too low and there was ample room in the hip/butt area to both flatter and accommodate my extreme pear shape. Length wise, it was a little above the knee. The belt was brown as pictured, but not long enough to knot as in the picture."
2.0,"I followed the exact size chart they gave and it doesn't fit . I can't even close the zipper, so for me it was a waste of money."
2.0,The color is different from the picture. Had to return it.
2.0,This thing washed in cold water and hung to dry shrunk to half it's size. Very disappointed since it was so cute out of the bag.
2.0,"I ordered a small, and it fits, but the armholes are HUGE.  You can see all the goods and the only way this can be worn is layered. Its an oddly shaped top."
2.0,The top is a little small but it works!
2.0,Sweater definitely too big...I order small but looks like large
2.0,Somewhat small and the fabric was of obviously poor quality.  It did not look particularly nice straight out of the packaging and one trip through the laundry cycle left it shabby looking.
2.0,Arrived broken so I did not get a chance to wear it.
2.0,"I bought a pair of brown ones last spring. They were nice looking, baggie on the top. The red ones I just purchased are tight on the top - 3” tighter than the brown ones. The brown ones look and fit much better."
2.0,The material is very sheer so don't get white. But for the price one should expect this
2.0,"Fits awkwardly- the length is short and the neck is wide and low. I tried adding a necklace to draw attention away from the neckline but nothing worked.  Sadly, I’m returning mine."
2.0,i regret buying this. thought it would be a little bit bigger but no. and the fabric it horrible. i personally don’t recommend buying.
2.0,I liked the pants the fabric was good quality but they were too small on me.
2.0,"Thought that these would be a good summer shoe, able to get a little wet and endure an easy beach day. After wearing in the sprinkler for an hour my LO took his shoes off and this was the result. We bought them for the whole family, will be returning"
2.0,I was super excited to get my pants but when they came in they were way too tight around the thighs.
2.0,Loved it so did my husband
2.0,Very cute but looked very old and used after first wash
2.0,"I wear a small in everything. I couldn’t even zip this dress up and the length stopped barely below my butt cheeks. Otherwise, the material seemed to be fine and the dress is beautiful. I recommend ordering a size larger."
2.0,Material gotten fuzzed balled
2.0,It was too small and the fabric wasn't what I wanted. I ordered an extra large.
2.0,"If you're a big person, make sure the size of the chokers fit."
2.0,"I have tried numerous times to find the opening in the body stocking, to no avail. However, it feels good to touch"
2.0,Sizing is completely inaccurate for bottoms. Almost like the bottoms are 2-3 sizes too small. Top is true to size. Pajamas are super cute if only the bottoms fit. Returned.
2.0,"I ordered purple - the photo looked purple and it was called purple in the description but the shirt I received was more red, like maroon. Disappointed."
2.0,"Is very hard plastic, not easy to put on and even more difficult to take off. Very disappointing given the designer ."
2.0,"Just got the gloves today (3/9/2022)<br />I attempted to try on the gloves, but then the right glove immediately started to tear at the seam.<br /><br />The other reviews were positive so I plan to try again with a new set, even though these broke."
2.0,Cheaply made and super thin and scratchy material
2.0,The cloth is very thin and not stiff. Quality is not good.
2.0,Too big I guess they would be comfortable if they fit. But I don’t care much for the material. Not see thru. Made good
2.0,"Short length, colors not as pictured. Returned item."
2.0,Just wasn’t very flattering. Very clingy
2.0,"Not what was expected, kind of cheap looking"
2.0,"It came with bad stitching on the bottom, it will likely snag and come loose :("
2.0,Not flattering at all for big breasted
2.0,"Overall, I really enjoy the product. The part I don't like is the fact that the left speaker has already gone out and the Velcro that holds them on lasted one use. I like the convenience, dislike the durability"
2.0,Well made and very comfy.  I'm only 5' tall and ordered a Medium to be sure it would fit as a sleep shirt.  Washed once per instructions and it shrank 2 sizes!!! Can't return because it was washed.  The sizing chart not accurate.  Too bad because It's a well made product.
2.0,"The description says the fabric is soft, but it's NOT. Many other items that have a 95% polyester, 5% spandex IS soft, but this is NOT one of them. It's course and brutally uncomfortable. That being said, the pattern DOES look like the picture. It's beautiful."
2.0,"I wore the necklace for one day, then took the Fitbit out to charge it. When I tried to put it back in, the necklace would no longer stay closed. With such a risk for losing the actual tracker, it was certainly not worth the $20 I spent for it."
2.0,I got what I paid for but the nose piece was welded on crooked so they look a little funny.  Still wear them though.
2.0,Dress too small for a size XXL.
2.0,"The vibrating part of these are MUCH larger than I thought they'd be. So much so that it's hard to get them to stay on. Also, you can't really feel the vibrations in your nipples, unless you clamp them on your breasts above the nipple, resting the vibrating portion over your nipples. & Even then, the vibrating motor part will roll away or they come unclamped. 😞"
2.0,Shirt is very cheap looking. Odd material. Not flattering in the least!! Returning.
2.0,"I love the look of these, but the metal irritates my skin, and I never have issues with that kind of thing. Not sure what the problem is.... A thin coat of clear nail polish fixed that problem for me though."
2.0,"I read all of the reviews and thought for some reason I would not have the rolling waist band issue, but as soon as I put them on they started to roll.  Also the material was poor, but it was THREE for that price, so I gave 2 stars."
2.0,"The product is decidedly mediocre. It looks just as expected, and whatever the core is made of has more heft then I expected, which I was actually happened about at first. However, the sword is poorly balanced (not that I was expecting anything better from a toy) but it means that the whole thing bends when you swing because it's top heavy, and it makes me worried that it will snap. The hand guard also has no solid core, so it looks like it will probably rip off easily. However, it was relatively cheap and looks half decent, so it's not completely a waste."
2.0,Cute design and colors but horrible material not stretchy at all. The bottoms fit but the top is too tight
2.0,2 seam lines... makes it goofy
2.0,Case is as described in terms of size and would have been perfect.  Unfortunately it smells like cigarette smoke and I can’t use because of the horrible smell.
2.0,Nice looking product. The strap broke after 4 supervised uses
2.0,"Not happy this hat I got to wear 3 times, all of a sudden holes appeared in it, the material started coming apart I don't know if I got a faulty product but I won't buy this again. (Also no moths were eating it if you were curious, it was in a sealed plastic box)"
2.0,Looks like a knock off
2.0,The jewelry is nice and pretty arrived in a timely manner however very small. couldn't fit or use any of them for my septum ring . will return.
2.0,"The color is light pink, and not hot pink as the photo suggests."
2.0,Rips easy. Taste like plastic
2.0,"These glasses get an overall 2/5 stars from me because despite their perceived benefits, it fails to serve the purpose I bought them for: reducing glare/eye strain under grow lights.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Quality is decent/so-so; the frame feels like typical cheap textured plastic, but it seems to be made well. I don't have a big head, so it's nice that this pair fits me well (though it might put some pressure on someone with a big head).<br /><br />Cons:<br />Increases red/orange glare. Product description claims: &#34;The Sandalwood protective grow light glasses are the perfect solution to reduce the red/orange glare from your greenhouse or grow room lights&#34;. They don't. In fact, the glasses ADD to the red/orange glare from the grow lights. I've added pictures to show what I mean. The purple image is the light without the glasses; the pink/fuchsia is with the glasses (over my camera). I even added a photo with the glasses half on, half off the camera so you can see the difference. It reduces the blue/increases the red.<br /><br />These glasses also aren't color correcting: If you're buying them for that reason, look for another pair. They aren't advertised as such, so although I didn't notice this when I bought them, I'm not deducting stars for something it never claimed to do.<br /><br />Finally, I'm not sure of their UV protecting capabilities, as I do not have a means of testing that (other than failed eye sight after using the pair).<br /><br />Overall, the glasses don't do much in the way of reducing red/orange glare, are unknown in terms of their UV protection, and additionally do not help with color correcting. I'm not sure what the seller's return policy is, but I'll be looking for a replacement for this."
2.0,"Cheap quality, plastic zipper...not what I was expecting."
2.0,Not as good as I expected.  Described as red... they are orange.
2.0,VERY CHEAP LOOKING!
2.0,The jacket felt cheap and was oddly proportioned. I tried to return this product but my return request wasn’t accepted. Don’t recommend.
2.0,The material is not comfortable and seams are rough and rubs the skin inside even with simple walking.  I am returning this item.
2.0,not made to work with dog harness
2.0,Not sunglasses they have zero protection from sun.  They are very very faintly tinted. Would have been nice if they were better for wearing in the sun. Sent them back.
2.0,"Too small in the hip region. Just couldn't button the bottom two buttons and it otherwise would have fit perfectly :( When it says slim fit - it really means slim. I'm willing to admit this was some customer error, but I was a little disappointed since the shoulders and chest looked great and fit exactly as expected. Color was nice too... Such a shame and I can't really return it since the shipping was so expensive :/"
2.0,The flowers are very grainy!! They look like the image was blown up too much. It looks awful
2.0,After washing it they unraveled completely.
2.0,"Got this purse, it's ok disappointed with.  It doesn't stand up,it falls over plus it bends at the bottom.  Not pleased."
2.0,"The sweater is extremely thin and very small. I guess if you want your sweater to fit very tightly, it would be true to size. If you like a looser fit, buy one size up from your normal size."
2.0,Es tan bien pero duraron muy poco las compre  en octubre  y ya no sirven  se despegaron de la parte de enfrente  por el costo esperaba mas durabilidad.
2.0,I like the bag but it smells like bad leather.  It's been two months and I still can't get the smell out.
2.0,The quality seems sufficient and as described.  But it is much smaller than I expected.  It was labeled Large too.  After wearing it for half an hour I gave up.  There were circles around my face showing what the mask was.  I cannot recommend this mask to anyone except those with a small head.
2.0,Runs very small. Nice soft shirt just very small.
2.0,I was looking forward to this one but I really hate the print.  The flowers are actually kind of ugly to the point of not wanting to wear outside the house.  Regret the purchase.
2.0,"Horrible! Hate it. I ordered the yellow, white and blue tie dye looking one thinking I was getting a sweatshirt type shirt but it’s the polyester/spandex cheap shiny fabric. I’ll be returning it."
2.0,Cute but too small. My daughter wears a 2 and her heel was hanging off size 2-3.
2.0,I ordered  this in white and got black?? I literally paid EXTRA for this listing because I wanted WHITE !! On top of that I don't like how thick this is. I'm probably going to cut the top bit of leather off. It's still cute i guess but like :/ I didn't order black.
2.0,Pretty but too big to sleep with
2.0,"This may be the last FYI try buying clothing through amazon. The product quality is icky. The cardigan looks and fits as expected but it feels awful. The material is stiff, scratchy and always has static. The product isn’t worthless so I’m keeping it only because I don’t want to be bothered by sending it back. But it’s not a nice item to wear."
2.0,"Runs very small. The quality is great but it is a small eight inch for a guy. Sadly, had to return."
2.0,Not sure about the quality.
2.0,"very badly made, would be okay for a costume.<br />not happy at all.<br />picture looks way better than really is"
2.0,"The size & face of this watch was very easy to read & I liked it at first.  However, I lost this clip watch quickly, clipped on the loop of my pants, due to the poor quality of the clip.  The moving part of the clip slides & you'll lose this clip watch, so if you order, I suggest to change to a much sturdier & secure clips if you can. (as you can see, it's not that easy to replace)"
2.0,Part of a Halloween costume ?? Not happy with item but no time to exchange or return
2.0,"Nice belt, but not sturdy enough for my purposes."
2.0,"Very mild heat, for a very short period of time. Disposable warmers will give you more heat for the same amount of time for next to nothing. Having to use the app is much more a hassle than a benefit. These are completely overpriced for what they provide. I would not recommend them."
2.0,Jacket fits a little smal and the material is spandex. I brought XL fits like a medium
2.0,"Very very thin material, more like a gauze type of fabric. This IS NOT a ""bandana"". Don't waste your money."
2.0,"Nice shirt, but WAY too small and I bought an XL (I usually wear large)"
2.0,"One of the straps is coming unsewed from the top edge of the bag after only 3 weeks of use. It’s not like most totes that have the reinforced ‘x’ and box shape sewn to hold the straps in place. It only has the strap tucked into the top edge of the two pieces of material at the top and then sewn straight across. I was using this as a bag to carry a chromebook and a few other materials back and forth to school.<br /><br />I do like the material it’s made of since it seems easy to clean the outside by wiping it down. But if I can’t carry it because the strap is coming off, the bag is pretty much useless."
2.0,"Nice apron. However, you must soak it in kosher salt water before the first time it's used.  What a pain."
2.0,They are very small! They do but fit ages 6-11. I returned them.
2.0,"Made cheap.  Very poor quality speakers.  Not comfortable with the bulky size of the speakers.  I bought it with intentions on using it on a long flight, I heard more of other travelers conversations and the usual sounds encountered during flights.  I also bought one for a family member and received the same criticism."
2.0,Meh. Super boxy and unflattering.
2.0,Not the best quality returning it today. The light pink is not the prettiest.
2.0,"Ok..first the band breaks in no time<br />Second the shooting computer...by the time you add in the different calculations the target has a chance to leave the area, go home, get married, raise kids, send them to training and they can come back and offer cover fire.<br />Take that away...and its a rather overpriced Casio watch. Sorry its typical 5.11 hype crap. They are a company with great vision...they can see a sucker coming a mile off."
2.0,It's cute but I'm 5'5 and it goes to my knees so it's more of a short dress instead of a long shirt
2.0,I don't like the eye spots they don't seem right.  Cause there is no hole for your eye so you have to wear it under and it looks odd
2.0,its lighter and sheer like a cheap tank top
2.0,"This is for girls, not for women. The size of the bracelet is almost the same as a K-cup."
2.0,The top runs a little large.
2.0,Cheap interior came apart.  I
2.0,Cute and stylish but scratches up so easily! They scratch themselves when they are closed up! I think they are beautiful but should be scratch resistant...
2.0,"I needed an electronic travel organizer, thought this would work. it is basically a piece of cardboard with flex straps, trying to add all my gadgets didn't work because of the various sizes of the straps.  Ended up buying a travel bag organizer that works and covers all my gadgets."
2.0,It’s a beautiful dress. The material is a little cheap and the fit runs VERY small.
2.0,Poor in quality
2.0,"GREAT MATERIAL, but a Large fits like a YOUTH size. I couldn't even get it up. I'm 5'6-144 pounds. I will try again with an XXL. WAY TOO SMALL EVEN FOR COMPRESSION FIT!"
2.0,"The bottoms are fit to the size given but the top is so small, it could fit a 7 year old perfectly."
2.0,"For $5, I really wasn't expecting much. What I did expect was clean gloves and a right and left glove. Not 2 right hand gloves. I attached pictures showing the stain on one and the side by side of the 2 right hands... That being said, the quality was slightly better than I expected. And they fit my 3 year old sons hands okay, though the glove fingers were a bit long, and the hand part a bit short. The cuff could use some elastic to help hold them on. Luckily I know how to sew and I will add some elastic thread to it... I bought this to use for a Halloween costume, and for that it will work, even with a stain and 2 right hands..."
2.0,This is the second time I've ordered these pins. The first time the quality was great. I ordered a second set and I'm very disappointed in them. The best looking one has fading in the corners. The others look like they are faded and worn. Not worth the hassle or time to ship these back. Buying beware of quality control.
2.0,"Don’t fit right, other brands fit better and are more comfortable"
2.0,This was a really nice robe but unfortunatly it ran very small.
2.0,They just have a horrible fit....like you have them on backwards but you dont.
2.0,"The skirt is pretty but the size runs very small, I bought Large but it appears to be the equivalent of size 4-6"
2.0,"I had a hematite bracelet for about 10 days. I wore it everyday. I was giving someone a basic hug in NYC, and all of a sudden i hear little things dropping. My bracelet broke and the beads were willing into the street. The point of the break was on the exact opposite side of the clasp.  I will say, i did buy a smoky quartz bracelet too which is still in tact. I think maybe the black nylon cord isn't very durable.  I will also add that i buy a lot of beads from AD Beads and i love their beads. I usually make my own bracelets because the elastic ones usually break for me in a couple weeks. So u usually use hemp to make mine. But i was specifically looking at hematite and Smoky quartz so i tried these. I might buy another hematite one to see if it does any better. If i do, I'll update this review."
2.0,"The shorts fit very weird.  The back was perfect, legs a bit tight and it bulged/bunched in the crotch and tummy area.  The material was stretchy and would have been comfortable if the fit was right.  Pockets were too small to hold my phone too."
2.0,"First, I ordered the tan colored cardigan but actually received the black one.  I liked it so much though that I chose not to say anything. The fit was great and the material is very soft, stretchy, and comfortable.  I have worn this cardigan maybe 4 times and have washed it only once.  Both of the pockets on either side are already starting to fall off.  Very disappointing because I really liked the cardigan and would have said the quality was great if it wasn't for the pockets unraveling so quickly.  I would have highly recommended this but now I cannot."
2.0,This was a no so I let my daughter have it she loves it.  It stretched to much for me and I did not get that rich look when II wore it.  Felt like AVON or Fingerhut but worse
2.0,This mask was not clearly represented in the above picture. Outline of mouth on mask is not even visible. The mouth is much smaller compared to what’s shown and also crooked.
2.0,"These clips were very pretty, they were just too small to fit onto an adult woman's size sandel.  They might fit a child size sandel though.  I had to return them, but have not received my money back yet."
2.0,I know my measurements for compression which should've been a medium. All compression stockings are a struggle to get on but this was 10 times worse. Once I got them on I felt uncomfortable in my ankle area and my knees. I have dents in my ankles from the stockings at the bottom and I have little deep dots in my thigh from the band to help them not slide off. I say the size is off because I know what my size is. I don't know if I should just buy a large or just look else where for stockings. It's too late to return them to get my money back. I'm 5'7 124lbs.
2.0,Super soft and comfy but NOT scrubs.
2.0,I returned it it is like micro mini
2.0,I’m 5’5” 125 lbs and ordered a size small. They were way too big on me. I’ll be giving them to my friend.
2.0,glasses broke immediately when I tried to form the to fit
2.0,"The material is low quality and unforgiving. The outside of the fabric looks and feels great however, the inside is going to tear within the 1st 3 washings."
2.0,"These run small, especially if you have athletic build. They're made for guys with no leg muscles. Cut for distance runners, not bodybuilders."
2.0,"quality leather, pretty color. however, the inner strap is to short; i tried it with 47mm watch - no comfortable, can not place watch on proper place (must be very close to the buckle) for smaller watches and (maybe) kids will be fine."
2.0,I gave 2 stars for the next day delivery and beautiful design. I am a solid US 8 for pumps and 8.5 for sandals . These shoes are so lovely but they weren't well made.<br /><br />Just got the gorgeous sandals today but it was too small or short in length. Since my heels are stuck out for almost inch and a half. It says 8.5 US size and 6.5 UK size but unfortunately it appeared in size US 7 more than US 8.5. Have to return the same day.
2.0,"Cute but material is very cheap and not soft, unfortunately will be returning"
2.0,Uncomfortable and not worth the money
2.0,"These look dark purple not blue, probably won’t wear them"
2.0,These were fun for the first day. They turned an awful color and had to be thrown away. They also smelled funny.
2.0,"I bought a small and it fit perfectly, except it was cheaply made and the material was very thin.  I did wear it  because the  event I went to required red!  Will not wear again."
2.0,"It's made of cheap 70's pajama polyester, kinda shiny.  I will never, ever wear it."
2.0,"Cotton socks are supposed to let your feet breath. Not so with these socks. Look nice, wash up nice, just make feet sweaty."
2.0,"Great product, but not large enough to cup under and to the sides of Double D breasts. Would love these if they were about twice as high and 20% wider."
2.0,I ordered the shirt based off the only size chart available and it is not correct. The size small measures 34&#34; inches and it's 100% cotton so no room for stretch. If only they had offered a correct sizing chart I would have ordered and received the correct size. Now I have a pretty pricey t shirt that my son can't wear.
2.0,This skirt is definitely more fitted versus the loose fitting one in the picture.
2.0,"Not the shape I’d expected but comfortable once I got used to it.  Since my orbitals are not the same depth I can’t wear many kinda of sunglasses, so this is the 10th pair I’ve purchased of this brand.  I got 3 in this shape but it sits lowers on my zygromatic bone and face than I prefer."
2.0,fits awkward
2.0,"Run small, find them to be uncomfortable.  Worn once or twice,  sitting unused in a drawer."
2.0,Too small.  The fabric is stretchy and feels cheap. Not flattering.
2.0,"Beautiful band, probably would have been worth my bringing it to a jeweler to adjust the band properly.  Although the instructions state there are arrows stamped on the band indicating the directions in which the pins should be removed, my band has no such markings.  Apparently the direction I chose was not the right direction, I couldn't seem to get the pin all of the way out, even with the help of pliers.  I'm left with a useless piece of trash of my own making, $20 wasted.<br /><br />The product seems very nice, I certainly am to blame for trying to adjust the band myself, but buyer beware."
2.0,"Arrived broken . not packed well ..looked used.. The coating peeling off from places..Rhinestones fallen out of place. Got this to give away as a gift I am glad I opened it and saw, will def not give this gift it would bw looked down upon. Not happy .will not recommend."
2.0,They were cute at first. If they get stretched out that’s it no more wearing them. Ugly looking once that happens
2.0,"After about 10days, the pearl lost colour, and the necklace looks rusted. Now I have a plastic ball on a rusty looking string. Don't tell me &#34;You get what you pay for&#34;. No no.. it was a waste of my money. This crap doesn't even worth 9 bucks!"
2.0,We ended up returning this dress it fit strangely. It seemed the torso wasn't in proportion to the dress.
2.0,Not what I had expected.  The picture on the Amazon website shows the back of the hands being warmed and that is precisely what happens. I put them to the test today driving my tractor 2 miles in 25° weather. The backs of my hands were fine but they never got cold anyhow. My fingers are frozen. The backs of the fingers were frozen. I had it on high setting which made a difference. I will be returning these.
2.0,My daughter went to wear this the first time and it was made with a hike in the side. You can see in this picture that the fabric was never sewn together. Unfortunately we are outside the return window since we purchased in advance of when she needed it.
2.0,"Really comfortable.  Perfect support.  Not terribly difficult to put on/take off.<br />HERE’S THE PROBLEM:  Wore them for two days.  Washed per the instructions (cold/hang dry).  The heels pilled ridiculously.  For $20 bucks a pair, I expect more.  Despite the positive that I really like, the value for the money is missing due to the material quality at the heel."
2.0,"The material is very clingy and there is no lining whatsoever.  Since a full slip with a little lace on top showed through I tried a half slip.  Even with a half slip on it still shows minor lines.  It's also a material that does not breathe.  I wanted this for a summer dress and just in the time it took to look in the mirror and buckle a pair of sandals I felt the dress was too warm for summer use.<br /><br />I ordered a large.  The fit was fine.  The band that fits right under the chest has a little give, and so does the top.  I can see it fitting any size chest.  The length hits right at the knee on me and I am 5'5&#34;.  I prefer a tiny bit longer but would have been alright with it.<br /><br />I ordered purple and the color was pretty close to the picture, probably a little darker.<br /><br />I am returning because it has no lining and is a bad material for me."
2.0,"Overall, I find this strap underwhelming. Nothing about this strap looks or feels ""premium"". The material is nice, but nothing spectacular. The hardware is cheap (and looks it). The strap came packaged in a cheesy plastic sleeve reminiscent of chinese made dollar store goods. I have ordered many less expensive nato and zulu straps from Amazon that were superior to this one. If this had been a $10-$12 strap, I'd probably keep it but at $20, I am disappointed. I'm planning on returning this."
2.0,You get what you pay for. Poor quality...
2.0,"Not what I expected, thin which I said ok for summer but the fit is very strang at mid section. Not for me. I like the color."
2.0,Very big ! Order down. I don’t feel like sending it back so I’ll keep it. The leopard is off in color. Wouldn’t recommend ! I’ll use as a lounge shirt for around the house.
2.0,The bathing suit was very nice . The size was so so big for a 4yr old. Now buying another. Its his birthday this week.
2.0,Not too pleased with it
2.0,THE WHITE PAPER SLIPS OUT BUT I TAPED OVER IT ... SO I DUNNOOO... I REALLY DID NOT EVEN NEED THEM TO TRAVEL.
2.0,they were very difficult to put on - cannot wear them
2.0,It is ok for the price. U get what you pay for
2.0,This produce is crap.
2.0,"These are the level of the $5 gas station sunglasses. They seem to be sturdy, but the lenses are horrible, my eyes just can't get used to them. They seem too dark and there's some sort of distortion which irritates me."
2.0,"Cute design and fit fine but they really mess with my eyes, they're almost like wearing 3-D glasses - so I won't wear them anymore."
2.0,"Materials seem ok, but the buckle isn't the correct size. Falls off my wrist every 20 minutes."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:46e5f8bdd05d60eb1e1ed6546509a9a7]] I bought this hat for my 5-year old daughter a couple weeks ago from BB&B. after wearing it only one day, the tassel fell off from the end of Elsa's braid. Fine, I thought. No big deal. I went back to the store and returned that one and bought another Flipeez Elsa hat.  Again, my daughter wore it only one day, and now the entire braid fell off! The rest of the hat is made beautifully -- very well-constructed, but that damned braid! The whole point of the hat is to have Elsa's braid move up and down. So, sadly, I am returning this one, too. Seems like there is a quality control problem because just by looking at the braid, you can see that there is only one piece of yarn that's supposed to hold the thing onto the rest of the hat. For the $20 I paid, I shouldn't have to sew pieces back together...especially not after only wearing for one day! My other daughter has the Flipeez dog hat, and that has lasted beautifully for over a year now. I'm returning the Elsa one and will look for another Flipeez design.<br /><br />I did include a video (sorry, no audio), so you can see how the hat works and how the braid fell cleanly off and was only attached by one string."
2.0,The picture looks way better than the actual boot. The boot feels and look very cheap. Way over priced and took a long time to arrive from China. Buyer Beware!
2.0,"Fits as expected (just a little short...and I'm only 5'4&#34;).  Unfortunately, the material is unforgiving so I could see all my imperfections (cellulite) so I returned."
2.0,The outfit arrived and was super cute but way to big. I ordered a 3-6month and it looks like it would be more around 12month size. We be returning.
2.0,Love the patterns and style but fit very small and I have an average size adult head. Had my adult daughter and son try them on and they also fit small on them.
2.0,Mine came today. The posted pictures are much nicer than what I received. Several stones look discolored. I would have done better just going to Target or the mall.  Disappointed.
2.0,When u order them order them in your size being the UK they fit but tight my husband need 9 in uk us 10 we order 9us 8uk little heads up but he is wearing them only boot he wears
2.0,It was late but overall happy
2.0,It's really not a functional workout bra.  It's not all in one piece and has straps that are really flimsy.
2.0,"I’m really disappointed and wish I had read more reviews before ordering.<br /><br />This is not made from cotton, it is a very thin synthetic material. It was also a smaller than normal. I decided to give it a chance, but I should have just immediately returned it.<br /><br />It does look good, which is why gave is 2 stars  instead of 1."
2.0,The only thing that kept this skirt rating so low is the compression shorts ride up while running. I had to stop several times to pull them down.
2.0,I don't know how to put it on<br /><br />¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2.0,"Ordered 4X because I wanted it to have plenty of room this fit like a 16 plus size and went above my knee i am 5'4"". It was very pretty but to small"
2.0,No me agrado porque la pedi xs pero igual estaba grande
2.0,I used this set on two occasions. The first time I loved it. The second stone I used it my fingers actually started to turn green
2.0,"I am usually a 1x or 2x. For the size I ordered, 3x, it still is too small. I'm not a huge girl and was hesitant to even order it but I went with the biggest size available because I like loose fitting clothes. Nope. Can't even wear it in public because it shows every nook and cranny haha. I will keep it but wear it as an undershirt. The top part fit perfect to my sizing. I order bigger because of my chest size. The torso was too tight for my liking."
2.0,Didn't fit well and was kind of stiff.
2.0,Watch does not keep good time.  Starts and stops.
2.0,Order up! This did extremely small!!
2.0,Pants were slightly baggy and zipper broke after first time zipping up.
2.0,"Looks good. I usually wear xs or s size, this skirts is too small (hips) to put it on."
2.0,"It is a perforated fabric, run small."
2.0,Great bracelets but I thought they would be a multipack and they only had one color.
2.0,Received the hoodie without fur. Not what expected. Also seems very large considering the size.
2.0,"Pretty earrings but difficult to latch closed,  unlike any earrings I have ever seen latch like that."
2.0,I ordered a 2xl so it would be extra roomy and big on me.  It was tight! 😳  I ended up cutting it up and making a off shoulder t-shirt out of it since I like the tie dye pattern.  Wouldn’t recommend sleeping in it as the material doesn’t breath well.
2.0,It's very simple. Not very durable  has a good price and is not good quality and strong
2.0,"Didn't fit so I never wore them.  Was too large for me but if it fits you, I think they'd be good."
2.0,The top loop is much longer than it is in photos. Looks dumb
2.0,The fan isn’t connected to the costume which allows for air to escape. I bought a kids costume that inflates and the quality is so much better.
2.0,"Ran about 2 sizes too small, Unless the pair I received were marked incorrectly.  Very attractive boots so I was very disappointed"
2.0,Looked better online. Comes with very cheap tiny plastic backings that I lost immediately and so have been unable to wear them because all my other earrings are hooked.
2.0,"Bought two pair of these in solid colors and they fit great (see-thru but fit) then I purchased a pair of the camo and they are WAY too small, different material and quality. Irritating since the other two fine but I guess you get what you pay for...."
2.0,Well...if you weigh less than 160lbs and have a wrist that's slightly slimmer than your average toothpick....you might be able wear this watch. No way could it fit me.
2.0,"I was excited to receive this Tallit and looked forward to using it.  While examining the tzitzit I discovered that instead of eight strings, there are ten.  This is incorrect.  The wrapping between the knots are not the correct number either.  Beautiful to look at but unusable until the fringes are tied correctly."
2.0,The stones were pretty but I ordered two pairs and both were tarnished when I received them.  I removed the tarnish but don't think a jeweler should send tarnished jewelry.  My photos show before and after cleaning
2.0,"Look and fit is good, and pretty good quality. But the waistband is very thick and strong elastic that would be uncomfortable and only fit on your high waist. Not as versatile as other skirts of this style. Plus the fabric is hideous and static central."
2.0,I ordered a medium and it fits like a XS. I have to return item
2.0,"I was so excited to order this shirt but it was not as expected. I ordered a women's medium, and I could wear it as a nightgown because it's so long. The collar is so large, it falls off both my shoulders. And there was random stitching over the middle of the shirt. I wonder if the wrong shirt was sent. It is that off. Plus side- I'll use it to do a DIY project with t shirt cutting to cut it down to fit. Still love the graphic (after I picked the errant line of stitching through it.) Edit: I see now that the stitch is supposed to be there, so I upped my rating."
2.0,not quality material
2.0,Only clips on one side and comes undone
2.0,Too thin to protect
2.0,broke second day
2.0,They look great but they are not tight enough at the  toe
2.0,"I liked it at first, it's comfortable and easy to put the watch on.  But the pins pop out easy and the watch falls right off my wrist in random situations.  Also, because it's magnetic and doesn't clip in I feel like it loosens up during any kind of activity and then my heart rate doesn't read correctly. It's a shame because it's really nice looking and comfortable.  I saw someone else's review that says the pins start to give away as you use the watch more frequently so you can just replace the pin.  But I've have this band for about a week, am I supposed to replace the pin every 4 days?"
2.0,"Still in original packaging,  stitching is terrible and unravelled already. Has a slight discoloration on one of the sleeves. Very disappointing"
2.0,"I like the shirt a lot, but when one orders the XL, one size larger than normal, and the XL is the largest size available, and then it is still a bit too small, you send it back and keep looking.  Darn...I really liked this one too.  Made in China...enough said!"
2.0,"Material was thick, but a string came loose after one Washing. Plus the seams were so wide it was annoying while wearing.  I had to return them."
2.0,We received two necklaces with this purchase.  The first necklace fell to pieces within the intial week of its arrival after being worn twice.  The second necklace is still hanging in there!! :)
2.0,Just No. Couldfind better quality shoe for same price at Ross dress for less. So cheap...
2.0,It would have been perfect if the product was in working order when it arrived! Smdh one of the 3 holders was broke
2.0,normally
2.0,I bought this dress for a cruise we are going on in January. The fabric was a bit heavy (polyester)and I felt a bit exposed in the front. I also didn’t care for the floral design on me.
2.0,The waist part is very loose and doesn’t flatter. The fabric should be a more tight fit
2.0,Looked awful and the quality is cheap.  You get what you pay for.
2.0,"Bought it as a gift for my wife, she liked them but after a week the stud pulled from the pearl.  We sent them back not sure if we will reorder."
2.0,I felt very disappointed upon arrival of these hand sanitizer pouches. We were so excited to get the “back the blue” pouch. The picture shows a blue line. When we got the pouch was most definitely purple (as shown in the photo). Very disappointed son!
2.0,Cute for the price... Looks a little cheap... I like it tho...
2.0,Size is smaller than normal
2.0,"Medium was equivalent to most L or XL tee sizes; image is super pixilated - not good quality. On top of this - there is a $4 charge deducted from refund for returning shirt: only option offered is USPS. I 100% regret purchasing this tee shirt - and never would have purchased, had this been an in-person transaction."
2.0,"Some might like, but not for me. The cheap surface fabric printing really stands out and not in a good way.  I can't comment on the fit, because I didn't even try it on once I had seen the printwork."
2.0,Lopsided. Haven't worn it more than once. Just looks weird
2.0,"The hat was exactly what I was looking for and at a great price. However, it was shipped in a box that was too short and it crushed the hat... I was able to make it work, but such a disappointment that it would be shipped that way!"
2.0,"These are really cute, but the lense popped out as after one wear."
2.0,"Those are beautiful but lasted like nothing with their original color. Wouldnt buy again, ever."
2.0,"Smaller than I'd thought it be, it's about the size of a quarter...not a half dollar,like in the movie"
2.0,Nice design but sizes seemed off. Daughter who is normally a 1 had a size 1.5 falling off her foot from this company.
2.0,This was very cute but one of the bees fell off after wearing it for only two days
2.0,"There is no such think as a hi-cut bikini.  There is a brief, or a hi-cut brief.  I can't wear these pitiful underpants and wish I hadn't bought them."
2.0,"The fabric feels like a plastic shower curtain. I bought it for summer but it doesn’t feel breathable and even makes a bit of a plastic noise. I’m surprised other reviewers haven’t brought this up. The buttons are poorly placed and gape at the waist seams. It is the quality of a cheap Halloween costume. I would be embarrassed to wear it in public, especially if you work on a quality retro look. Disappointed because it looks so cute in the picture."
2.0,Very cute. I thought they were gonna be to little but the are just right. Very stretchy. But they aren't worth 18 dollars more like 10.
2.0,"They work to stop your glasses slipping, for about a day. Then it just breaks at the seam.<br /><br />First, this type of ear hook seems to be designed for think glasses legs (the wire type maybe), and definitely not for slightly thicker plastic legs.<br />Unlike the description, these things are very noticeable, very hard to put on (especially if you have thick frames/legs. Mine immediately split down the seam halfway when I put it on). They don't last at all. Some fall off in a couple of hours, the longest piece I had lasted for 2 days."
2.0,I see no evidence of polarization when glasses are rotated.
2.0,This toe ring is super cute but constantly spins so the knot is on the underside of my toe.  Very disappointing
2.0,"The wrist band has started catching on everything fabric. I haven't had the edges scratch my skin. But they are unraveling in a manner which grabs everything from a threat on my sheets, shirts, pants, couch cushion, towels. It was cheap and it is not great. I like the style over all. But ruining everything that has threads in them is not helpful."
2.0,"Bought this for my friend for Halloween. Got it a week late...and it was way too small. It was her size but maybe in juniors??? Seemed like good quality material, the over all purchase was a complete worry."
2.0,These mask are huge! They seem to be made well but I would say they are like an XL
2.0,The lenses are not black as shown. They are mirrored blue.
2.0,"I got the cat laser mask. It showed up early, but it was EXTREMELY faded, as if it were left out in the sun. It's a good mask otherwise and came with the two filters."
2.0,Waste of money. Kid was still covered in hair. It doesn’t close right enough for a 3 year old btw.
2.0,"Brown bracelet broke five minutes after putting it on not sure if the black one will break also , afraid to wear it now"
2.0,"Really sad, back came loose and gone.  Pretty earring, but need to be more secure."
2.0,I haven’t worn it that long and it is already stretching out. I have to tighten it everyday. I’m switching back to my other band.
2.0,Cute pattern but doesn’t help compress whatsoever
2.0,"They fit good, and they look pretty cool. They aren't wood grain, it's like a painting of a wood grain. And they are not polarized. It doesn't say polarized on the side and it didn't come with a little picture to test for polarization. I emailed the seller and he just said that they are polarized and to check the picture that came with the glasses. I responded that I did not get one of those pictures. He did not respond back. But again, they are decent, and cheap. I'll just keep them."
2.0,"As another reviewer said, this doublet does not compare with my triplet 10x.<br />The area of focus is very small, only in the center...the rest is blurry.<br />The triplet has focus throughout the viewing area.<br />Would not buy again.<br />If you want good viewing, through the full area, buy a TRIPLET, not a doublet."
2.0,I returned this because it was way too short. It also made me look like a child... way to loose and cutesy.
2.0,Sent me a ripped - used item & item isn't even on the paper correctly ...a new one is stapled to the cardboard..this one is tied....and the cardboard is all ripped and old.....like really...don't put NEW ....when it is a pre owned item!
2.0,"The tie is okay, but the plastic part that holds the clip arrived broken on one side and soon later broke on the other, so it's no longer usable."
2.0,"3X fits my size 10 daugther.  She loves the dress, material and style."
2.0,The sizing is off.  Would not recommend purchasing.
2.0,I loved the design but it looked cheap and a part seemed a little discolored.
2.0,"This was too small for my 3 year old's head.  He has a big head, but it is supposed to fit up to the age of 18.  The hat was not only too small in circumference, but it was also too short to fit over his ears.  The quality is good, however, and cute, so I gave it 2 stars."
2.0,"I'm 5'8 and about 185 lbs with a wide, muscular upper body. This hoodie fit like an oversized trashbag and looked terrible. A medium would fit 6 foot 220 lbs, easily. They really need to adjust their fitment guide."
2.0,"Even the skirt is super cute, don’t buy it if you’re thick. It won’t go over your butt for anything."
2.0,"Cute, too small for adults..."
2.0,"I like the style of these jeans but I ordered a size 9 which is usually on the big side for me.  With these, I could hardly get them to button and were really tight around my hips, fitting me like 4s.  I was so disappointed.  They really are cute but maybe order 2 or 3 sizes up."
2.0,Bought the bag for work use<br />However I realize it’s way smaller that expected can’t be worn as a crossover bag. Like the fact that it has small compartments.
2.0,Cute but they came all bent which was disappointing.
2.0,This sock has great compression around the foot and ankle but the calf kept sliding down and I would have to pull them up every once in a while during the day. Not what I would expect from a compression sock. I have some regular Hanes tube socks and they stay in place all day long with plenty of walking at a much lower cost per pair.
2.0,"The material is wrong for this design.  Sleeves should cling to arms, but because it is a big, bulky sweater and it stretches out, they don't."
2.0,Fits very smal. Poor qulaity fabric.
2.0,The material is super itchy. It was hard to wear more than a few minutes
2.0,This necklace is ok. Looks a little cheap in my opinion.
2.0,Didn't like the masks. They are way too big for a kid
2.0,"These sweat pants have a weird W to L ratio. The Medium pants I ordered were, according to the size chart, a 32 waist. Thinking this is a perfect fit for me I ordered a pair. What I got was a 32 waist with what seems like under 28 length. I cannot wear these and plan on returning."
2.0,"BEWARE -  these are NOT dye set, they WILL dye leach when wet/washed"
2.0,"I loved them at first, and now after a few weeks of wear they are sitting crooked on my face.  Not sure if I damaged them somehow, but I don't like the look and it's annoying."
2.0,It was a little too small for me
2.0,"Most XL gloves fit me just about right to maybe a bit snug.  These were VERY tight & the fingers were way too short for me to get them all the way in.  They aren't real sturdy, but they also didn't cost much so if you get them in a size that fits & don't need them to be real sturdy, you should be fine."
2.0,"Maybe these worked for many people, but unfortunately I cannot recommend them for bad edema (swelling) and poor circulation as a result of pregnancy.  While they did help to cut off the circulation to my calves and ankles, I ended up with swelling and pain in my knees and swelling remained in my feet!  I won't be wearing them again because they are definitely not helping the problem."
2.0,Cute dress but the corset back fit weird at the waist. It was too big so it bunched up.
2.0,"Arrived with the clasp attached to the chain, not the bracelet itself.  Easy fix with some spare jewelry parts from a craft store, but still a hassle.  Low quality, but not the worst out there."
2.0,Magnet fell out within first two weeks. Wont stay attached. Loved the look however
2.0,To stretchy! Yes it’s very soft and comfortable but it make it just to big then you have it falling with these big old pads sticking out under your boobs! Yikes no thank you! $ lost:(
2.0,Was obviously cheaply made and didn't fit well at all
2.0,I bought this for one of my sons who wares 3t.  The shorts are so long and don’t stay on him.  The shirt does not fit it’s so small.  I gave the shirt to a friend of mine who’s son is still in 18 Month cloths and it’s snug on him but he can ware it.  We modified  the shorts so they would stay up and bought a new shirt.  We got the same shirt Just two sizes up and it’s still almost to small.
2.0,"A bit see through, probably shouldn't be put in a dryer"
2.0,"My daughter wanted this for a vintage look. However, the top of the dress did not have room for her bosom. She is not fat but she wears a larger bra size. It made her feel bad to try on a large and there was not enough room in the top. In fact, one of the buttons popped off when she tried it on. The style would be perfect for her if it fit properly."
2.0,"The hat is not very big, so it literally sits on top of my head, not meant to be around or cover well."
2.0,"These are really uncomfortable to wear. The fit is really awkward. They hurt my eye sockets on either side of the bridge of my nose. I'm super happy with the company though, I have other googles from them that are amazing."
2.0,It is a very nice design but was disappointed in how small the hearts are. This is a Christmas gift for my wife.
2.0,Bad quality screws are not going in
2.0,I bought this item for Christmas for my daughter and she loved it just exactly the way it is online the packaging was really cute she really enjoyed all the features that it has but just until yesterday on the middle of the night it started making this really loud beeping sound and we couldn't shut it down it started to overheat and my husband had to open it up and take out the battery and the battery was really hot not sure what happened to it it seems to be working now but i dont allow her to wear  I'm a little afraid that it might overheat when my daughter wears it so just because of that little incident I would give it a 2 i feel it unsafe to wear now.
2.0,I returned this item because the quality of the fabric was not what I was hoping for.  But the style is very cute.
2.0,It was an x-large and it was the size of a small medium. I wanted to return it but was unable to it was more hassle than it was worth.
2.0,Feels nice. Great color. But it's child sized.
2.0,Very nice looking but pants leg were  too narrow for waist size.
2.0,"Socks have plenty give in forefoot, unfortunately they feel like you are wearing plastic bags when you get into physical activity. They do not wick or absorb sweat."
2.0,"Cute, but received item with multiple stains on bikini bottom from rusted jewelry piece"
2.0,"Cute and cheap, but they kind of look like little girls’ jewelry."
2.0,Doesn’t hood up to weather. Already falling apart after a week
2.0,Shirt overall is unflattering. It’s too large (even though I received a small) Peplum is unflattering.
2.0,The fit and print are perfect. Wish they would use a material that isn’t shiny. It has a sheen that makes it look cheap. I’ve ordered dresses that cost less from other sellers on amazon but they didn’t look cheap. No sheen to the other dresses.
2.0,"My husband is always large, but this large was good in the long and extra large by the shoulders and sleeves, need to look for slim cut now.  This is going to be returned, the fabric feel nice though"
2.0,"Very pretty and unique piece, but only suitable for a couple of uses. Coating on metal is already coming off and with a slight tug, necklace fell apart."
2.0,Glasses were larger the described. They were huge on my face! I returned and got charged more the half the price of the glasses for return shipping! It wasn’t my fault they couldn’t measure properly!
2.0,"If these didn’t pinch my head giving me a headache , they would be perfect. They pinch about 5x more than normal glasses"
2.0,The color was great but the elastic for the waist line was very lose not flattering on a slim figure . Be perfect for a maturity dress runs big
2.0,"Very heavy, not yo happy with the product."
2.0,My grandfather used to make these for us when I was a child. They work great for removing oversized boots. If you are small in stature and wear a small boot this will work perfectly for you. I am 6ft 2in weigh over 200 lbs and wear a size 12 muck Boot it does not remove that size boot.
2.0,"Looks cheap, but can look nice with the right outfit."
2.0,"This really does not give a flattering look and there was a noticeable flaw in the overall design, not sure if it was meant to have a pocket but either way it was poorly cut. Yes, I expected a loose fit but it is basically a shapeless tent with two slits.It got two stars because it's comfortable to sleep in."
2.0,Not exactly what was in picture
2.0,I was in a wedding and needing a black dress. I order a medium and large just to be safe. The medium fit like a large. If i could have gone back and ordered another one I would have ordered a small. The material was good. You couldn't see through it. The length was about ankle for me and I’m 5’5
2.0,It was a beautiful coat but not true to size
2.0,Too small and the fabric was very thin<br />.
2.0,The jewels fell off within a few months of use.
2.0,It’s well made but very see through. And wearing nude underwear or none at all won’t help. You’d have to wear a slip or leggings to not see through it.
2.0,Fits very small.  I am 1xl.  Bought 2xl.  Still does not fit.  Way small.
2.0,I thought this would be the same quality as the long kaftan I have purchased  the material of this much thinner and skimpier.
2.0,While the belt is soft and long enough. The groves don't seem deep enough and tend to slip if you have it tight.
2.0,Kinda short bars. The hearts are good.
2.0,"Nice looking hat, but sewn very poorly causing the seam to unravel after a short period of time"
2.0,The pedometer does not work
2.0,I hate the hood.
2.0,It’s really cute and good quality but it runs really big.
2.0,"I was excited for these, but after opening the package I’m just disappointed. I’m not sure why these socks arrived with some kind of hair all over them. It looks as though they were in someone else’s home with cats, maybe. I’ve washed them twice and it remains. Picture included."
2.0,This is a super cute dress! It even has pockets. The only down fall is it runs 2-3 sizes too small. I ordered a large and it ended up going to my 11 year old :( yes I will buy again for her but for me I won’t buy it again.
2.0,I liked the idea of them having a shield but they fog up really bad making it hard to see so I cut off the plastic
2.0,"The shoes are very comfortable. My husband loves the fit and support. Unfortunately, the shoes I ordered were brown with a black bottom and these shoes have a white bottom. He doesn't like the way they look, bu5 needed to go ahead and wear them, so we can't exchange them. Disappointing."
2.0,"Could be a nice fit if you are large in the hips and behind, otherwise they look rather bad.  I wear mediums usually, and ordered a medium, however these are simply enormous in the whole seat.  Legs snug, waist great, but won't work for me.  Returned.  Also, had to return thru the company, and it cost half the price of the pants to return.  Sad!"
2.0,This is just barely too short to fit in a tongue snake eyes piercing.
2.0,This item didn't work for me.  They were well made but didn't fit adequately and slid down when speaking.
2.0,These hold well all day. The problem is the top part of the bra shows if the clothing is at all revealing. Any tank top or low cut blouse shows the tails. Bummer.
2.0,"I get compliments about how these look, but the lenses have gotten so scratched in just a few months that they are now unusable.  Won't buy again."
2.0,As an OOfos fan my expectations were clearly set too high but this was a disappointment. Sizing is way off and as a result so is the arch support.
2.0,They're a lot bigger than they looked
2.0,Straps are different lengths and the image is offset to one side. Disappointing.
2.0,"It was a thinner and cheaper print than I expected, but it wasn’t janky or anything."
2.0,I love the piece across the neck. The front twist does not lay right. It needs to be tacked down better. This is made for a smaller woman because the twist is right at the stomach and makes it look larger. It doesn't hide any flaws. The material is typical polyester. True to size. The sleeves are the right length. The shirt can be close to tunic length if you pull it down. If the twist laid better I would have given more stars.
2.0,It's very comfortable compared to the one that came in the box. But every time I adjust it on my wrist  it falls off.  It's fallen off at night while I was walking my dog and I had to go find it.  The connection points are terrible
2.0,I ordered black and was hoping it came ready to wear but no. It arrived grey and it has a huge hole in the seam.<br />I gave  it a second star because the fabric seems soft and weighty like it might be nice but I will never know. Returning.
2.0,"I actually purchased this item twice. The first time the back racer back area was not sewn properly and immediately came apart. I reordered. Upon receipt of the second one I noticed that when you wore it even after adjusting the straps that they would flip and they were kind of like a paper clip shape and they would be elongate and it was very painful.  They would stab into you and you could set them straight but they would immediately do it again. Beyond that, putting the darn thing on is something else. Disappointed and unable to rate  highly"
2.0,"Inaccurate sizing, fit very tight and fabric was poor quality"
2.0,This dress is extremely long and you can see straight through it. It makes you feel like you need another dress up under it. It is very clingy and accentuates Every lump and dip. :-)
2.0,It looks good but didn't fit as expected. The dress is sized as expected but it doesn't fall on my body right. It's like the stitching is off somehow. It's just not as flattering as I thought.
2.0,"Ring seems cute but is too bent to get on finger. I would attempt to bend it into shape but it seems a little fragile, like it wouldn’t survive the process."
2.0,"The dress was longer, below the knee, not above (I ordered XL).  The strap was weird in that it tied on one of the shoulders, didn't like that either.  The fabric was also kind of strange, not what I expected.  I sent it back."
2.0,"Returned because whole shirt felt scratchy like the lacy sleeves, and stitching at chest is too high and uncomfortable."
2.0,"The ""enamel like"" logo turned out to be a printed logo with a clear cover. My Chevy logo was not printed very well and faded in the blue area around the Chevy logo. Not crisp like the photo looks. It definitely looks as old as my 92 Silverado, so I guess I can still make it work. Just disappointed that it did not match what was advertised. Maybe I got the bad one in the batch."
2.0,It is very dull. I even used jewelry cleaner and it remained gray. I'm not certain its sterling . Not happy:(
2.0,Well this coat jacket thing is not my favorite...reminds me of wearing a bath robe...the material is weird...maybe I can use for Halloween
2.0,"Would not recommend...too thick and too bulky to sleep in, material is not made for sleeping in, it’s slick but odd - would not recommend"
2.0,cheep but cute
2.0,Eye openings are set way too far apart. You have to cock your head sideways to see where you're going.  This is a tripping/ falling hazard.  Express delivery (EMS) was a waste of money. Not a day faster than original delivery date and cost an extra $45. Could have been a good costume with a bit attention on the manufacturing side.
2.0,"Cute but VERY see-through. You couldn't use it to swim in, only as a top or costume piece or something.  Wish there was a higher q suit with the print!"
2.0,"It only worked for 2 weeks, then it just stopped working. Very dissatisfied with this purchase. I do have to add that for the two weeks it was working it was really nice and had sufficientl light."
2.0,Runs very small through the arms and bust
2.0,"This is extremely small, and almost see-through."
2.0,"All they do is cut down on blue light, reducing the effectiveness of my own headlights. Adds some blurriness.<br />That said, the seller kindly refunded my money. 5 stars to him/her."
2.0,"The fit was perfect but the material was not a smooth dry fit, felt like cheaper material. Also the design was nice if you don't tuck your shirt in. But if you tuck it in, the sewn in stripes felt awkward and annoying against your waist line. Sadly returning"
2.0,The fabric was not what I thought but was ok.
2.0,Glasses were too small for my face. Had to return them. These are more like kid size.
2.0,"The Med (US small) was way too big...the sleeveless version. I am 5'3 123 Ibs... 34-26-37 the top (near the side of breasts) as well as the mid back bunched to leave gaps making the dress look odd. Not sure if it was just faulty sewing or a size issue, yet reviews said to order a size up & this was the smallest available."
2.0,They don’t fit. My feet are too wide!
2.0,"too wide, bulky and over the top"
2.0,"Not flattering at all on larger ladies. The print is lovely, but the dress has no form and the belt isn't enough to save it."
2.0,"Too small, thin material and listed as grey but it's actually a tan color."
2.0,"Doesn't lay right,  never even wore it and got ride of it."
2.0,"Not true to size at all, I ordered the biggest size and it's very tight and I wear a xl in regular clothing."
2.0,All plastic and cheap ok for 2 to 3 week use
2.0,Fingers were to long for my short hands.
2.0,"good only for a few keys, I ordered 2 and on the second day of use one of the rivots came loose on one of them and now it swings side to side. also metal seems a bit cheap."
2.0,"I received this in the mail quicker than anticipated! I tried it on to make sure it fit. I'm 5'11"" and usually wear a size 10 (I ordered a medium). It hits me mid calf, so if you are tall, this dress is nice because it doesn't look like you are trying to pull off a maxi dress and it be way TOO short. HOWEVER...after pulling it out of the washing machine after the initial try on, the stitching in the waist/bust is coming out and there is a hole. I don't think I'll be able to get a refund for this now....very disappointed because it is really cute."
2.0,I was hoping this would be easier to use.
2.0,"See through material. Though that did not bother me nearly as much as the color. The red is not red. Rather, a hot pink."
2.0,"These bags were hard to fold into the attached pouches. One bag was already ripping at the seams, one had a stain and another one was very thin in some areas like it would rip soon. I returned them ASAP."
2.0,The tag rubs me.
2.0,"This is very wierdly sized.  The top is VERY padded (which I am small busted, so pops them out there) but the suit runs small-tight so can see my ribs.  I will wear it around the house pool but not out.  I am 5'10&#34; approx 175# and regularly wear 12/14 so I ordered a L but guess I should have ordered an xl....."
2.0,"Should've gone by the reviews...it is very large and loose especially on the arms. For reference I am 4'11, 125lbs"
2.0,Look the model appears to be curvy and I thought this was an American model. It's from China where I'm lucky this will fit after I wash it! They do not know about carbs in china because I think slim women are more common then here.
2.0,Runs extremely small. I wear a small or x-small in everything. I couldn’t get one pant  leg up pass my thigh. It does not expand at all.
2.0,Low quality but good for the price
2.0,"Hot, bulky and they slide around on the palm of your hand. Not recommended."
2.0,It's fine i thought my helmet would fit in the front pouch but was wrong.
2.0,"The picture shows a fully faceted onyx ring. What I received was not as pictured at all. It's still nice, but beware."
2.0,Okay but completely sheer
2.0,The quality is worse than Wal-Marts. Ive bought many bras from u guys and not once been satisfied. Sure i can return it but*I'm caring for my grandfather who cant walk and needs 24 hr care. I'm lucky if i can get to the gas station down the street. I can't leave him alone that long.
2.0,"This showed way too much cleavage, it was weird. Lost the classiness."
2.0,Ink runs on linens and runs very small
2.0,"The dress itself was cute, it hit above the knee and could be worn by itself or with leggings. However, the shoulder area fit too snug for comfort (and i’m not broad shouldered)."
2.0,"I ordered three of these dresses in three different colors. Although all three dresses were the same size, they were all very different in size when i got them. The fabric was also very different from dress to dress. One is so thin, there is no way it could be worn in public. The dress that fits me the best is too short to be worn as a dress, its more like a tunic. The one made of the nicest fabric is way too wide."
2.0,Low quality. It looks small on my head too. It feels like the size between a youth and a men's. Good caps are getting harder and harder to find and this is no exception. I suggest buying a different brand. '47 brand keeps raising their prices and lowering their quality. Will never buy this brand again.
2.0,"Crappy material, doesn't look nearly as cool as in the picture"
2.0,It looks nice and high quality when you get it but on mine the grey color started peeling off within a few days.
2.0,WAAAAYYYYYY short! I'm 5'3&#34; and it wasn't long enough to cover my rear end. New shirt instead of new dress.
2.0,Thin! and you can see right through it. I ordered from another seller...Authentic African Kente Cloth. I'll just give this away.
2.0,"Most of the rings were nice. I bought them as a gift for my friend who likes natural stones. Some of them looked fake, but the ones that didn't were beautiful. After wearing the rings for a little while though, some of the stones popped out."
2.0,Fits too large
2.0,"Very cute nose studs the only downside is I've been wearing the candy cane for a week and I woke up this morning to it being green all around it. Didn't cause any irritation just the unsightly green, kinda bummed because they are adorable!"
2.0,Looks good but poor quality .
2.0,I got a smaller size and it is too long.
2.0,"Don't like the band  at the top, slips down when doing yoga, and a bit scratchy."
2.0,Does not give you a lift
2.0,"Too short. I am 5'8&#34; and at 8mo pregnant I weigh 150lbs. I ordered a large and it fit everywhere even a tad big, except the length. It was a few inches above my ankles. I ordered a blue floral print and I felt it looked somewhat like a couch fabric."
2.0,This was a lot bigger then I thought it would be. I don't know who would use it on their actual keychain.
2.0,"The shoes fit overall great and are ok for what we need them for, however, my little Dorothy can't skip because of the shoe design. The velcro is not strong enough for her to even walk without them popping off/up. I will have to do some fixing to get them ready for actual little feet to use them. What a let down!"
2.0,I didn't see any difference in reducing the glare headlights!  Karen
2.0,"If you are buying these for kids older than five, buy the adult size.  These are very small."
2.0,It was like a bad 70's-80's prom dress.. Very frumpy and not form fitting at all. I'm 5'4 about 130 pounds and I ordered a medium.. It was too big in the bust and around the middle. Those cute lace sleeves on the sides are wayyy too constricting and make moving your arms a task. The material is really nice though. Not see thru at all. Just wasn't for me.
2.0,They seem to block blue light.  They are huge. They are uncomfortable because they put dents in my cheeks.<br />I most likely will return them. I wonder if there is a way to trim them on the bottom.
2.0,Would not recommend. Material is cheap and the garment looks irregular without ongoing adjustment.
2.0,"I realize these are not high end, nor did I expect something high quality. But they looked like they came out of a gumball matching. Disappointing."
2.0,"It does NOT fit an iPhone 6s Plus with protection case as stated. And the color is not khaki, it's gold. I can make it work if I jam it in. It needs to be about 1 inch longer. I am disappointed."
2.0,"Cute but they're big, bulky and heavy."
2.0,"The band is nice enough, and the price is right. It has a nice heft, but, you do not want to hang your arm out of the car window or over the boat edge, because the clasp is garbage. Not a secure band for your expensive watch. It constantly comes loose."
2.0,Very weird fit.  It rides higher in the front but feels like you have plumbers crack in the back
2.0,"This was not 'exactly' what I've been looking for. I've been searching for a small square turquoise stud (I only wear one). This smallest size works well and I have grown to like the ball shape as it looks like a little 'earth' ala Carl Sagan's 'pale blue dot'. As far as quality - they seem to be good quality as advertised. I took a bit of a chance, but for the price (very reasonable) I figured if they weren't right for me, they'd make a nice gift for a friend.<br /><br />Above was my first review - before I had worn them. As stated I wear one at a time....here's the rest of the story:<br /><br />After a few wearings the ball came off of the stem. I thought it was odd but didn't think too much about it. I super glued it back on and got out the other new one to wear- same thing - after a few wearings the ball came off in my hand when taking it out. I was surprised that both times it didn't fall off and get lost completely. I super glued the second one and I've yet to find out if they'll hold.... So - my revised review is that these earrings don't appear to be assembled well at all. Beware they may fall apart on you too - with this quality the price should be $1.50 not $8."
2.0,"The fabric is not as advertised, very poor quality and uncomfortable. Smells absolutely horrible (you should wash it first anyways, but still makes you wonder how sanitary it is). Even image is poor and fuzzy (my phone camera did a good job at trying to clarify the image, but just look at the clarity difference between the mask and the counter its on. Would be worth $5 maybe, definitely not $16. As a seamstress, I can see where the fabric isn't going to last long. Not a terrible product, but just isn't worth the price for what you get."
2.0,Plastic stone fell off within a week of wearing.
2.0,"Poor quality fabric, uncomfortable and hot."
2.0,"If you are looking for a cheap Halloween witch costume to wear one time this is fine, but if you got it like I did to wear to a formal event, then it's terrible. The proportions are weird and the sleeves are much smaller than in the picture. The lace was already separating from the hems in some places. Unless it's just for a one-time costume, I don't recommend this!"
2.0,The fabric is beautifully silky and comfortable. The straps slide off my shoulders. There is NO separation - it's definitely a flattening shelf bra. Will keep to perhaps use as a sleep bra to avoid hassle of return. Do not recommend except for very flat bust.
2.0,"This product arrived damaged one post was completely missing, and the other post was bent. The earring also we extremely cheap, and wouldn't stand to wear more than once."
2.0,"It was very soft and a really nice color but it was pretty big. The most disappointing part to me was the bow did not come tied, end it was huge. I ordered a 0 to 3 month and I don’t know what 0 to 3 months head would fit this strap. I’m not good at tying bows so pretty much I ordered just the onesie not the headband."
2.0,"The green pants fit perfectly"" the fabri is also soft and satin I. I als ordered in heather blue and one one in dusty purple color. The quality of the blue fabric was inferior. If you enlarge the picture you can see the threads are white in the bottom. Only top had the color.<br />The dusty purple had good fabric. But it did not fit well. It is about three inches longer and if I pull it up, it fits on my chest rather than my chest .So the quality is not consistent. I returned the heather blue pants, The dusty purple pants, I kept them.i liked the fabric. But I will have to make them Shorter. These are size 10 pants."
2.0,I can work with it but it looks nothing like the picture. The triangle at the bottom isn't pointing down as advertised its just a triangle. and its way too long.
2.0,"If I was smaller therefore ordering a smaller size, I think it would have looked much better. Too bad. I really liked it."
2.0,Shirt is sized VERY small. Size up. XL is more like a men’s sm/md.
2.0,"In this picture, i wore it straight out the bag. Of course it needs iron, but as soon as i put it on it was a no no! The dress reminds me of a table cloth! I ordered a small and it felt great, shows your shape! I have a flat stomach, but if you eat and get full, your stomach will show. Will be returning as soon as possible."
2.0,"I ordered the hot pink dress and it fit great, but the material was completely see through! I’m not sure who they think would pay $20+ for a dress they have to buy a slip to wear under. I am returning. Disappointed because the dress was cute except for being see through."
2.0,The shorts arrived on time and are what seems to be the correct size.  The padding looks to be plenty thick.  The material for the shorts themselves seems very thin and extremely stretchy.<br />The real kicker is that when I put them on. The back waist is very low cut.  When you sit on your bike saddle the top of the shorts in the rear is extremely low.  ( lower than it should be buy at least four inches.<br />We will see if they last for any length of time.
2.0,"When I bought the goalie shirt, it was for my 9 yr old son.  The sizing did not indicate that it was Youth, so I assumed Adult.  I ordered a XXS and I received a shirt for a 2-3 yr old.  I spoke to the vendor and they kindly replaced it with an appropriate sized shirt without a problem.  My son loves his new shirt."
2.0,"Awesome jacket. Looks and feels great, only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is was wondering why it felt tight and realized I got a Size M when thought i ordered a large."
2.0,Very cute good material runs small I wear an large/xl however I have a larger chest ....I got a xxl and it looked and fit like a large. It’s supposed to be a somewhat loss fitting outfit
2.0,"I will start off this review on a more positive note. The material is decent quality and I do like that the drawstring straps are adjustable. However, I ordered a small and it fits like a large. It seriously looks bad and whenever I try to make it work, it still is too big. I'd say keep looking. This product isn't worth the money."
2.0,Chain sucks. Way too short and thin... flimsy
2.0,"I was so excited to receive this watch band, but very disappointed with the quality. Very stiff not comfortable at all. It is missing one of the pins to install it to my watch well let me say it's not long enough to clip to my watch. So it doesn't stay clipped I had to remove a pin from another watch band and that's how I was able to wear it."
2.0,"These bottoms are cute, but a bit clingy. I'm worried they'll be see-through when wet, so I haven't tried them out in public yet :/"
2.0,does not fit or look as good as this
2.0,"This item was way too small and I immediately returned it. I ordered an XL and could barely put it over my head. Don't go off of the provided sizing chart. If you wear anything larger than a US women's 6/8, I would not purchase this product.<br /><br />As far as the material and quality, it did not seem bad for the cost. Also, the zipper only goes about halfway down."
2.0,"This is what I wanted, but it broke within a week.  It's unfortunate because it is otherwise well put together except the o rings that hold it to the large ring open easily and the whole thing drops off."
2.0,Fits like jogging pants. Not tights.
2.0,"I usually fit this size in all my other suits but this one fits small<br />Otherwise it’s a nice suit, too bad I can’t even wear it"
2.0,Its very pretty but the Tail fell off. I Have only had it for a short period of time.
2.0,I didn’t like how clingy it was. You can see everything under it. I wanted gowns for the hospital but it isn’t appropriate. Not modest enough.
2.0,Leaks! Fogs!
2.0,Ended up returning just wasn’t cute
2.0,"This shirt is very large for what size I ordered. I'm 5'5, 128lbs and the small is way too big.  It looks baggy and sloppy on. womp womp."
2.0,Did not fit me at hip area.
2.0,Mine came broken and  cheapky made not worth $10. Sent back did not reorder.
2.0,"I don't know how they got such a great picture of it for Amazon, but it's smaller than a dime. The typeface is so small, I had to put it under a magnifying glass. It is, however, very well made and I have to say that the fastener is of great quality. My use for them was as a zip pull, so I'm afraid it doesn't make enough of a presence for that use."
2.0,"I loved it but returned it as I don't want it dragging on the floor and tripping over it.  I am 5'6&#34;, probably 6-8&#34; too long.  It would be great if you are 6' tall, very pretty"
2.0,Wayyyy too big.
2.0,"I like the design of this shirt, and the fabric feels okay if a bit lightweight.  However, I ordered a L and was shipped a shirt that looked like a XXL.  I tried to change it for a replacement, and was shipped a second shirt of the same giant size.  I don't know if there is something wrong with the provisioning, or if the manufacturer just thinks a L is actually supposed to be a XXL."
2.0,Not at all like the pictures.  I sent it back.
2.0,Runs very small.. I’m a size small/medium normally and bought a large.  Fits more like a small.  Good quality though!
2.0,"These are much thinner and more fragile than their standard white gloves--which appear to be unavailable at present. Other than for washing dishes, I would not recommend these. They are certainly not strong enough to protect one from garden chemicals and the like."
2.0,"For the price that I paid for these boxers, I was extremely disappointed with the material. Very light, and flimsy. I realize their for children, but come on, it would be nice if they had some hold to them."
2.0,"very small, not for adults, kids sizes"
2.0,"La camiseta y la pantaloneta están muy bien, pero los calcetines no llegaron. Me gustaría saber cómo puedo contactar al vendedor para ver si me los envían o me reintegran parte del dinero que pagué por los tres artículos, ya que como dije, los calcetines no llegaron."
2.0,"Soo this was a weird fit , Im thicker in the bottom smaller on top , ordered a xl and they were almost to small and the top was waaaaay to big . I looked crazy , returned immediately. If your're thick in all the right places this may not be for you sorry hun .. If you have a smaller  figure  it would work . I ordered the windbreaker tracksuit"
2.0,almost see through and very long.
2.0,"The watch itself was fine BUT the band broke off after 3 weeks.<br />Not good quality - had to buy replacement ,<br />You get what you pay for"
2.0,Very cute! Durable but the size is completely off ordered a 9.5 they are more like an 10.5 Picture to compare.
2.0,"If you are on the chubbier side of average, be warned. These leggings are NOT forgiving. The fabric is nice and soft but so incredibly thin. They outline every role, lump, and bump on your body. The waist band in the tummy area is small and where it sits, it will push down on your belly creating a very unnatural and noticeable bulge especially when doing crunches or squats. I wish they had a longer waist band for the tummy area to hold everything in better.  After a work out, they also feel moist, too hot and uncomfortable to keep wearing."
2.0,"not sturdy, question contents of this necklace.  I do not believe it is silver."
2.0,Very cute hat but you need a small head. Fits my little sisters head perfectly but was meant for me.
2.0,Shoes kept slipping off feet even though they were the right size. No mom wants to hunt down a missing shoe.
2.0,"This product shipped fine and looks good, but they do not all fit in my ear. The ones that are just straight lines fit okay. All of them are a little thicker than my piercing jewelry so I had to shove them through a little, but the ones that I was most excited about (the ones with the squiggles in the middle of the jewelry) will not fit in my ear. I took the balls out on both sides but the earring is too long and I cannot get both sides of the earring in."
2.0,got for my daughter for her October birthday. She is very big into birth signs. She loves it but it does flip over which annoys her but she still wearing it. Love the concept of the necklace.
2.0,These are quite small.
2.0,Really lovedthe loon but the heel is super unstable so it forced you to use the balls of your feet only. the heel just was not under my foot.
2.0,One size does not fit all. I am a size 10 and the fit is too tight. Not worth it
2.0,"I really enjoyed it, until my clip broke off...<br /><br />Lasted about 15 months."
2.0,"Beautiful skirt, but much too small! Not for american sizes - had to return"
2.0,I received 3 pairs of white no show socks with black thread knitted in the socks .There are also the yellowish  color on the white surface .  I cannot believe they QC their product.
2.0,"It is what I expected, but nothing special."
2.0,I didn’t like the colored ones
2.0,The fit is really small compared to the measurements given. I ordered the largest size because I wanted it to be oversized and its definitely not. It's still wearable but not what I hoped for. Also it had a really bad chemical smell. I'm going to wash I several times and hope for the best. The tight wrist cuffs are weird too. I may unravel them and reknit them
2.0,Cute shoes but the heel part of shoe flares out. Would be good on someone with a very wide foot.
2.0,The fabric is cheap and &#34;hairy&#34; and it is not loose fitting at all (like in the picture).
2.0,This tank is so long it could almost be a dress…
2.0,These are completely see-through
2.0,I wear a large and I got a XL. It cannot fit my arm into the sleeve. I don't have big muscles so this isn't my issue. I will return these
2.0,"Not really a favorite buy.  It's okay, but nothing exciting."
2.0,Most of them are way too big.
2.0,I have this same dress in other colors so I was excited to receive this one for a wedding.  It runs really small and the color is NOT beige! Wil have to try and return. I ordered 3 of these dresses and this is the only I have received but I'm assuming the others will fit the same way and have to be returned.
2.0,"I want to like it. It's so cute!  BUT, I couldn't even get my arm past my elbow into the sleeve. Fail. The elbow patches and seams are OK, but patches are fraying.  It's expected for the price.  I wish my arms were toothpicks."
2.0,"I didn’t read the reviews, which is crazy because I walkway read reviews, and I wish I had.  The wrap is not knit, it is a sheer mesh.  I bought it to keep my daughter warm, but there is no way it would help.  If your looking for anything thicker than a veil, this is not the product for you.  If your looking for a sheer wrap, it is decent quality.  Size L for a 7 year old girl."
2.0,The neckline is higher than Snoop Dogg on a Saturday.
2.0,Never wore hated it but timely delivery
2.0,I have a small head and this fits horribly.
2.0,"My favorite sports bras are very expensive. I decided to give this cheaper brand a try because it looked like it would provide a lot of support when running. I'm pretty disappointed in this bra. It's pretty, but I can't wear it for cardio."
2.0,"i should have realized that this dress had elastic all around the top, it does not sit well over a strapless bra AT ALL. the dress is not narrow around the calves like shown, it's wide and just hangs. didn't like it."
2.0,"Loose, very floppy"
2.0,"The quality of the purse does not warrant the price.  The leather is not quality, the straps are like cardboard, same sentiments that a previous reviewer wrote.  The design is really nice and I really wish this purse would have worked out.  Another thing I didn't like is that the purse fell over, the height and weight made it flop over.  Beautiful design/poor quality.  And, another thing, when I bought the purse, it was at $200, when I looked a week later, it dropped $50.  This purse isn't worth the money."
2.0,"I got this watch for my fiance last Christmas. The first time it got wet, the inside of the face got cloudy with condensation. After this happened a few times, I sent it back to the company to be repaired. After several weeks and several emails, I finally got it back, only to do the same thing again. If you plan to wear this near water, buy something else."
2.0,"It was just like the picture, but the little chains broke from the clasp it was in."
2.0,"It ran smaller than what the size chart shows and because of the material, fits a little tighter than expected in the stomach area."
2.0,"So.. the jeans are cute let’s start there. I love the waist and the boyfriend style is cute too. However I realized the medium was way to big for me. I should have went down to the small. Also. ALSO. When I tried on the jean I put my hands in my pockets (yes it had front pockets which awwweeeesomeee) BUT. In my front right pocket I felt something in there. There was a tissue in the pocket. Now, I don’t get annoyed often but this was so irritating. Not only were they obviously used and appropriately inspected. I don’t even know what the heck was on this random tissue in jeans that were sealed in a bag. Like hello? Quality control? Gross."
2.0,"Beautiful blouse but even though ordered XL,  it was too small. Had to return it."
2.0,Doesn't look like pictire
2.0,Still too small after ordering a large size.
2.0,"IT TARNISHED AFTER THREE WEARS. IT IS SUPPOSE TO BE STAINLESS STEEL,I DO NOT THINK IT IS. STAINLESS STEEL DOES NOT TARNISHNTHAT QUICK. I DO NIT RECOMMEND THIS RING!!"
2.0,Looks cheap because it is.
2.0,I loved the style but hate the slinky material. The fit was a bit big as well.
2.0,Material is not at all what I expected.
2.0,I saw this dress and i loved it so I bought it but when it came i was very disappointed is was too small and the material is very thin
2.0,"Way too small, ordered a 6x amd it still didnt fit! Im not that fat, ive got a 50 inch waist so the sizing chart lies."
2.0,Dis-Like. Too bad shoulder strap & wrist strap clips (quick disconnect clips) are different sizes!
2.0,"Super cute, and obviously for the price wasn’t expecting much, but don’t expect an amazing quality piece. It feels a bit like a plastic, super lightweight. I would be surprised if it lasts the summer."
2.0,Had to return VERY tight in the waist but I couldn't have gone up a size anywhere else.
2.0,"It is a pretty top but too big in the underarms,and to short at the bottom."
2.0,"Fit is appropriate.  Appearance starts off nice, but quickly degraded.  The sneakers are lightweight which make them comfortable, but is likely one of the contributing factors to literally lasting only 5 weeks of daily wear by my 1st grade child."
2.0,I dont like it. Looks cuter in there pics.
2.0,"Tried to put it in the second time, it fell apart"
2.0,[[VIDEOID:a75371863ca4a8c30d2fc268909a3137]] for $50 I wouldn't expect the pockets to be fake. the jacket is very thin and costume-y. I'll be returning because this jacket is worth more like $15.
2.0,Ran very small I bought a medium and I am only 4'10&#34; not even past my shoulder blades and wouldn't close in front.  I am not a big person
2.0,"The frames fit well but the lenses do not appear to fit the frames properly, you can see gaps around the lenses in places and the lenses just pop out when you are trying to clean them."
2.0,The “quality” looks NOTHING like the picture! Same colors… same sweater… but it looks cheap! The ONLY reason I’m keeping it… is because I have a shoe that matches the sweater… but after I wear it… to the trash it goes! It’s NOT worth what they charge!
2.0,"Too tight, didn’t love the material"
2.0,Tangles really badly. REALLY BADLY. Beautiful color though...
2.0,Very short in length and wide in material fit horribly. It was pretty and soft on the inside.
2.0,I’m big for my size 5’6 and when i tell you this dress just didn’t fit me- my arms didn’t fit the sleeves my shoulders are on the less broad side if that helps at all. Along with took forever to come.
2.0,"I liked the butterfly in the center of the hoodie. it was stitched well and very clean. The hoodie came in waaaay smaller then i thought it would and i even went a size up. so if you’re trying to wear this hoodie comfortably, go up 2 sizes. It’s also super thin and slightly see through. You’d be fine with just a bra or undershirt, but i usually wear my hoodies without a shirt underneath and i would not be able to do that in this particular hoodie."
2.0,"The description states no pilling, but this shirt pills immediately and the fabric is scratchy."
2.0,"It came with part of it broken in the wrapper and the size of the bracelet is very large, does not fit snug on a small wrist."
2.0,I really like how they fit on my huge head but it's been only a week and the coating is already separating :(
2.0,"Rings are cute but way too small!  I only wear a size 6 ring so my fingers are not overly large, yet only the two plain bands would even fit over one of my first knuckles.  The plain bands measure a size 3.  The heart and leaf rings are only a size 2."
2.0,"Not a very durable material to put on a keychain, in fact part of it broke out of the box. It's cute, there's no doubt about that but it's way over priced for the quality of product and you only get one. Not super satisfied but it does make a nice piece to the shadow box."
2.0,"Chain not long enough, color good,"
2.0,"I had to return these jeans though I have several other pairs of PajamaJeans.  I ordered a large, which fits me fine in all the other jeans, but these were more like a medium.  Maybe the corduroy makes them smaller?  I don't know but I was disappointed that they didn't fit."
2.0,"As with many clothing products, if the size is not specifically geared for an American fit or standards, you'll be disappointed.  I can't really complain because I only bought it because I needed something ASAP and it wasn't that expensive.  Lesson learned."
2.0,"My 10yo was not pleased, too flimsy for the child's liking. May be suitable for other children to play with."
2.0,"The hat itself is cute but the fit is pretty awkward. The brim is shorter than your average hat (closer to a kids size) and the head portion is really large.  I have to wear it it on the tightest setting, which causes it to bunch in the back. The color isn't as bright as the photo either. It's a lot lighter, but its still cute. Just wish it was a better fit. I guess  you get what you pay for!"
2.0,"the fit was awful and I have returned it.,"
2.0,This has 8 pairs of arm sleeves 4 black ones and 4 different colors. I used the sleeves when I work at my job. I work in landscaping for 10-12 hours a day. All the black pair do feel nice and tight but when you wash them there’s a high chance that the stitching of the top or bottom of the sleeves will become undone. The 4 different color ones were loose on me so I didn’t bother with them. The four black pair lasted me only 1 month and a half. If you work in a different type of field they might last you longer but for outdoor workers I would suggest looking else wgere
2.0,Fabric is cheap and there was a ton of lose seams
2.0,The material is way too thin!
2.0,These boots are not very stable. The fit is lousy.  No support at all.  But for 12 dollars not bad.
2.0,"I love interchangeable purse straps but had no idea this one came with more design than I expected. It has huge text the width and length of the strap saying ""DEAUTY 1987"", whatever that means, which isn't shown in the product image or description. It's very visible. Bizarre. Returning it. Unfortunately it'd be a nice purse strap if the reverse side was just blank or the same as the design I selected."
2.0,"I don't know why but my masks smell weird which is really bad for a mask! Even after three  laundries I still feel that smell. Otherwise good masks, but because of the smell I'm not going to wear them. Mask should either smell good or not smell at all. Have a lot of washable masks from different sellers, this is the first time I'm having this smell issues"
2.0,"The photo makes you believe that it is more of a « vintage » orange. In fact it is a very bright orange. The coton is thick, the fit is stiff and not as soft and loose as you may imagine from the picture. The design is not incorporated in the material but rather made as of an additional plasticky kind of texture. It’s not bad but not what the picture let’s you think it will be ."
2.0,"Big, poor quality. Returned."
2.0,"This is not a dress - it is an oversized T-shirt with a scalloped bottom on the sides -- at a cost of nearly $30.<br /><br />And where the scallops dip upward they hit mid-thigh making this ""dress"" way too short.<br /><br />There's not much ""bat"" to the batwing sleeves (see photo) and the only thing that makes it a ""dress"" is the piece of cloth to tie around your waist.  I've included an image of me wearing the belt and another of me without it so you can see the T-shirt aspect well.<br /><br />On the plus side:  the material is soft and the pattern is camo done well, but those pluses weren't enough to convince me to keep it."
2.0,Way too big...followed chart. Shipping was ok and product looked like picture. My daughter wears a 2.5 and I ordered a 1.5 and they were huge.
2.0,The style of the skirt is cute but the material is so cheap it shines and feels like a Halloween costume. Skip this purchase
2.0,"I ordered a size 25 (which is my normal size in Hudson and DL1961 Jeans) in the color Essential Indigo. It was 1 and most likely 2 sizes too large as you can see from photos as they are super baggy and not super skinny or twiggy, so I can’t make an adequate assessment fit wise because of this vast difference, but do plan to order a smaller size to see how they match up. They are quality jeans, thick but not too thick, no smell, no dye transfer (although these are not a dark wash) and are made in the USA which I did not realize prior to ordering which is what I try to focus on buying anyway. This color style does have the worn look on the edges of pockets and other edges but I would not consider these to be “distressed” jeans (which I don’t care for).<br />I can’t hate on them for the sizing discrepancy but I don’t know if this brand carries a size 23 and that may be a problem for me at just under 100 lbs and 5’2”. The length was great for me which is often hard to find and why I bought these. I will try a smaller size and post my results!"
2.0,"I put these panties in the washing machine as Chrissy Metz & pulled them out of the dryer as Britney Spears. My high-cut briefs are now bikinis at best.  Upon opening my box, ea. pair was individually wrapped in clear plastic & they appeared so big I was not sure I was going to be able to wear them. (Online I always buy things bigger bc being a plus-size girl it's a given.)  Folks, I wish I had a picture to show you the before-and-after!! The label says 'tumble dry on low heat'.<br />*Hand wash only is my advice*<br />1🌟color(s) + 1🌟design= 2🌟 rating"
2.0,This dress is very pretty but the material is super cheap. The bottom part is like rayon. I wash on a delicate cycle and hang dry only and it’s already all pilled up. I’d never buy again.
2.0,"The photo of the flip flop appeared light blue footbed with navy straps. Compare it against any other brand in a black model, side by side. What I received was a light gray footbed with black straps in a men's large size. I wear a 9.5 U.S. and thought a woman's 10 would fit fine. I couldn't keep it on my foot it was so long and wide and the straps as a result were not even resting on my foot. I would have loved these in the proper size & color as the arch support was sublime."
2.0,Material is heavy and uncomfortable
2.0,the head piece looks cheap the rest is fine
2.0,"Not crazy about this band. It has only one loop to the hold  the strap, and since I have a small wrist, the strap dangles in the breeze. It was inexpensive, so  I guess I  got what I paid for."
2.0,"The style is great, the quality and color of the garnet is awful!  Light brown, awful stone quality."
2.0,Poor quality<br />Ax fire extinguisher broke on first day<br />Would not buy again
2.0,"Short sleeve, shorter than what I expected"
2.0,"won' tighten sufficiently, so they look like they are falling out. i was very disappointed, especially since the black ones didn't work, either."
2.0,"Amazon, take this product out of your platform.  I can't stand false advertising.<br />this product is definitely not polarized. I had polarized lenses all my life and this is nothing close to be polarized.<br />Please don't lie to your customers, be honest.  that is the best way to grow your business."
2.0,"We all have different wants and needs, so keep this in mind while reading this review. The problem I had with is that it it had no form to it. The dress felt a little boxy to me, and looked a little boxy. I couldn't believe it was the same dress I had ordered when I took it out of the package. The navy was not vibrant at all, in fact it wasn't navy at all. The color was very muted and subdued.. The fabric had a very cheap feel, and a very odd one too.<br /><br />This may not have been the dress for me, but this very well could be the one for someone else. My stats for those considering such a purchase are: 4'11/ 35-26-35/ 112lbs"
2.0,"The angle of the slit is no where similar to that of the model. No matter what way I stand and no matter how I pull it, it doesn't even come close. It's not even relatively tasteful.<br /><br />Got this as an evening beach walking dress for a honeymoon. Now I think it's just going to be a regular nightgown.<br /><br />Of course the item is see through and poor quality, but I docked stars for neither. I was expecting that. I docked stars for the item not reflecting the image depicted on the ad."
2.0,Usually a size 11 is a bit too long but I purchase it because it feels more comfortable in the width than a 10.5.  This boot was waaaay too short. My toe was about to burst through. I've never had that experience with a size 11.
2.0,"cute bag but within two days the side zipper broke, the main zipper broke in a week and the change purse zipper never worked"
2.0,The necklace was pretty but it turned after wearing it once.  Bummer.
2.0,The lenses are really nice themselves but they didnt fit my oakley twenty xx's maybe I got the wrong lens
2.0,"The picture makes it seem like it is a lot bigger...when it is not. I like the design, but wanted a statement piece. This was no it. If you are looking for something more discrete the this is for you"
2.0,"Did not like this cap , did not look good on me."
2.0,"Oh, Timeson. *sigh*. Well, even the best have their bad days, right? I love almost all of Timeson Women's blouses. They are usually very comfortable and form flattering. I decided to give this shirt a try as I've had such wonderful luck with their other styles. For me, this was a miss. I am 5'5, 154 lbs with most of that weight in my midsection. So yes, a blouse that is looser is usually ideal, however as much as I wanted to like this item, it just did NOT lay right on me at all. Maybe on a smaller chested woman (I am 38C/36D) this would work but I just ended up looking pregnant. Which I am not. Also, there is a seam along the back of the shirt that runs across the shoulder blades. If you have gentler skin (I do) it becomes irritating real quick. It's still a well made product, covers the bum just enough, and the shipping was great, but this just didn't work for me."
2.0,"Not quality, but that goes without saying.  It smells. Put it outside to help rid the scent.  Didn't work.  Good for walking around a fair not wanting to carry purse."
2.0,Love the shoe design but it is waaaaay to narrow.
2.0,"too small, not true size"
2.0,The material is nice but there was a misprint.
2.0,the fly buttons are already falling off.
2.0,slightly too large (And I love large sunglasses).  But they look cartoonish
2.0,The foot fits great. The sock is mid calf instead of knee high. Wish it was actually knee high.
2.0,Very very cheap. It's not real leather
2.0,This is a cute hat - however it is NOT real fur as advertised. It says right on the tag &#34;Faux Fur&#34; . I would not have paid this much for a faux fur hat.
2.0,I got the black and white pinapple and the white part and black part came apart in two pieces. When arrived the top part was smushed and hard to straighten out. Was just very cheaply made
2.0,"From the picture I thought the stones in this bracelet would be small and delicate, it is woven so tight that it is stiff."
2.0,"I bough this piercing on 28th of July, 2017. I got a few more piercings with led me to not to wear it right the way. It was beautiful! I really liked the design.<br />But the few weeks I wore it, the gold came out, and the middle stone fell out. So to me it doesn’t look like it is a good quality at all."
2.0,"The material for this product is a lot thicker than I expected. It was cute on, but the material is too thick to wear during the summer."
2.0,"So, I always order this style dress in a size lg from Amazon even though I wear a size medium in US sizing.  I wear size 6 pants & 6 or 8 dresses/tops depending on the garment.  I ordered according to the seller’s size chart.  I’m 5’4”, about 130 lbs, & have a 38C bra size.  The top of the dress fit fine; but, from the belt loops down it was way too big.  Because the material is thicker than any other maxi dress I’ve ever purchased, the pockets made my hips look bulky.  My hips are my smaller feature.  Honestly, I look pregnant in this dress.  I usually find a wrap look top flattering.  Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case w/ this dress.  I looked like I was a 40DD in this dress.  The dress is sewn well & has actual belt loops.  The colors were very vibrant.  I can’t say that there was anything attractive about how it made me look.  I own quite a few maxi dresses & skirts that I’ve purchased on Amazon & this was the worst one I’ve ever purchased.  I saw another reviewer comment on the pockets; but, thought it was just one person’s opinion.  I have to agree that the pockets don’t work with the thicker material.  This one is definitely going back."
2.0,Looked nice until they broke the second day
2.0,"Cute swimsuit , BUT NO TUMMY CONTROL"
2.0,Gloves were not made well. Binding at the fingers were horrible. I would not recommend the gloves.
2.0,No didn't fit right
2.0,Colors were great. Size was WAY smaller than expected
2.0,this style looks MUCH different in person.
2.0,Liked: the col;orful patterns.  Disliked: horrible sizing.  I ordered these for myself and they were so-o-o small I gave them to a niece who wears size five shoes.  My wife got the alleged womens socks that barely fit my size 9 feet.  Maybe If I leave them outside the birds can unravel and repurpose them for their nests.
2.0,The glove certainly did not have the gel padding that I am used to. It feels more like a thin foam padding. Other than that the gloves seem ok. No other complaints.
2.0,"As mentioned by someone else, the dress is cute with a nice trim but the fabric is quite harsh. It's a tough material and definitely doesn't feel like cotton. There is also no fabric tag is the dress to identify the material."
2.0,Tears easily. This was my 3rd attempt trying to put a glove on and they kept ripping. Poor quality. I paid extra for these because of the picture of them standing up to sharp objects. When I did a puncture test w a pen it easily went thru with little pressure. Im very dissatisfied.
2.0,Love what they look like on me but the backer holes are too large for the earring posts and the earrings fall off after a short time.
2.0,Looks just like the photo. Size was right on. However this pilled like crazy after the first wash. Think cheap sweatshirt fabric. Nice concept for the price but expected it to last longer than a couple weeks.
2.0,Wasn’t the right color
2.0,"Very pretty, I love the size. What I don't like is it doesn't hold a scent for very long, maybe 2 hours and it's gone. It is also hard to clasp close I'm afraid it will break."
2.0,"I liked it was leather and loved the looks of this bracelet.  But the magnet is not strong enough.  I wore it to the store this afternoon and it fell off my hand 6 times.<br />If the magnet were only more powerful.  Other than that it's a cute bracelet.  But it needs a differnt clasp, or stronger magnet."
2.0,"The fit on this top is ridiculously small. I really did like the top style and material and it appeared to be a quality product. To bad the sizing is so far out of specs. This fit like a small, not a large. Had ordered 2 larges, both are returned and not replaced."
2.0,i like it but print is damage
2.0,"to large for me, stones"
2.0,The color almost has a grey lavender hue instead of bright white as I expected.
2.0,"The fabric is comfortable and flowy, but the buttons were practically falling off by the first time I tried it on"
2.0,I bought the &#34;bright red&#34; bezel and band and it was not &#34;bright&#34;.  The color that was in the picture wasn't accurate at all.  I don't know about other colors but the red wasn't accurate.  Otherwise it fit well and was a good product.
2.0,"Was too small for my use, sent it back"
2.0,The dress was not the same vibrant mustard color as depicted in the advertisement.
2.0,"Very thin material, but it was very soft. It was not a very flattering fit."
2.0,"Really cute and well made, but it looks like a child's size."
2.0,We liked the costume...it just doesn't run true to size.
2.0,"Very cute top, and I will keep it, however I did have to alter it a little to fit my body better. It was to tight in the chest area. I am 185lbs and a DD. And I got it in the XL like I normally get my shirts."
2.0,"The reviews for this item have been scrubbed clean, as I purchased it a month ago when there were many reviews to help guide me in my size selection. My daughter wears a size 2 shoe. I ordered a size 2.5 and it is WAY too small. Her foot is hanging off the back by at least a half inch. If it was even close to the correct size I'd give it five stars because it's very plush and she says it's warm and comfortable (besides the size issue). Will be returning. :("
2.0,Expected a better bra for the price
2.0,Do not buy this if you want it to cover your entire stomach. It's like 6 inches to short. You sweat good but theres not enough coverage to be truly effective. I will be purchasing another brand.
2.0,Not fit for curvy women
2.0,"I'm very heavy chested so I ordered a size up thinking the top would fit. I ordered an XL; however, the top fits as if it's made for an A cup. If you purchase this, make sure you go up like 3 or 4 sizes."
2.0,I wouldn't waste my money on something like this again.
2.0,Smaller than expected and I ordered up.
2.0,"i like the color & design on the kurti. its a good length kurti since my height is 5.7"".  also its looks same as shown in the pic but i dint like the fit & material as such. runs small. so just returned it back."
2.0,Definitely not as cute as the picture. Quality seemed fine but was just overall sloppy looking.
2.0,"purchased this for my 20 month old, she's average height/weight for her age, the shirt fit well the dress was extremely oversized and the material seem kind of cheap"
2.0,"Out of the 4 pairs I've worn so far,  every last one has had at least ONE STONE fall out! Prongs that hold the gems are so small it's almost impossible to replace them without USING GLUE!! WHICH IS SO TACKY AND JUST SHOULDN'T AT ALL BE AN OPTION ON HOW TO FIX THE ISSUE,  SO DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PURCHASE"
2.0,Not a matched pair.
2.0,"Beware when buying these, they are very cheaply made and strip out super easy, if you can even get the ball off of some of them... you get what you pay for"
2.0,Poor quality and ill fitting. Worth a dollar as a Halloween novelty gag gift.
2.0,"So so quality, nothing fancy. The metal appears tarnished, but not in a good way. Like it’s just cheap quality. A couple of the rhinestones were missing from the heart. But all in all it was an okay present for my nana."
2.0,"somewhat small, the metal down the side broke through after using it once. Very hard to button up, because you get one in the eye hole and when you go to do the next one, the previous hook comes undone. You have to get one in and hold it down while you do the next so it will not keep opening. Pain in the butt and in the side from metal breaking through"
2.0,"I am very disappointed with this handbag, very poor quality. Bought it as a christmas gift and I am very embarassed, the bag was stripping at the bottom ends, the strap bursed and stripping all over. I had to apologize to the person and promise to buy them a new bag. DO NOT BUY THIS BAG"
2.0,Update: (March. 2021)<br />I just update costumers on my review after wearing this band for a couple of months. As you can see in the attach picture the band began to detach from the connecting claps area which is why I lowered my star amount as well because it’s last me a short period of time and looks like it will continue to detach.<br /><br />Jan.2021<br />The only reason that it’s 4 is because I couldn’t give it 4.5 is that it snags sometimes on fabric. So far I have had it for a month and mine is still rose pink and haven’t noticed any fading in the paint. It’s overall comfortable  on my wrist.
2.0,"A lot larger then the image, too large for my liking."
2.0,"I’m a bit disappointed in these jeggings. They do not have the Spanx top for tummy control. I have a pair of the faux leather Spanx leggings and I absolutely love them. These have a thin band at the top, creating a muffin top look. Looks like I will be returning and continuing my quest for a good pair of slimming jeggings."
2.0,"big disappointment. other reviews said too big...mine was too small. also, top of dress is shown as same fabric as the rest of dress. what was delivered has a different top..and its too tight"
2.0,"Looks like the picture but fabric feels like a child’s tent. Be aware there’s no stretch. It’s somehow cute still, maybe for a picture or a costume it would be more suited than day-to-day<br /><br />I’m 38 D and bought XL, It “fits” but the material feels papery"
2.0,I just received my order today and this are tiny I mean tiny.  Like for kids bracelet not happy.  Nothing like the pictures at all.
2.0,Daughter loved it....till it broke.  Not made of the best quality material.  was nice looking though.
2.0,I don't feel comfortable wearing them. They don't have the breathing vents behind the stones. That makes them look cheaper than they actually are. They are the right size that I've been looking for though.
2.0,Cute shirt however the pocket is to large with no top seam.
2.0,"The sangria carbon interlock material is very nice, soft feel, not too thin or shiny & very comfortable; these appeared to fit nicely at first, but they constantly fall down in the crotch - they WON’T stay up - can’t figure out what is up with these …  they’ll have to go back.  I have a pair in black & they are great - they don’t slide/fall down at all !!"
2.0,This is terrible material.
2.0,"Really cheaply made, it looks like a kind of suede in the photo but it's just like plasticish with glitter"
2.0,"These are just footless socks, definitely not leg warmers…Maybe if I was 10 years old. They are not slouchy at all. Not what I needed. Disappointed."
2.0,"With no added length for a 5xl, this was a belly shirt and although very funny to look at, was absolutely useless as a shirt for a larger man."
2.0,"Looks like just what I wanted, but it's shipped in a vacuum pack, so it leaves the warehouse already crushed and hugely wrinkled. It's nylon, so it can't be ironed, and though it seems good value, it looked awful with those wrinkles. I returned it easily, thanks to Amazon."
2.0,Shoe fits small and is almost identical to a size 2 shoe
2.0,"The quality was great. However, ordered an XL and it was sooooo short. Looked like something my 10 year old would wear. Very disappointed"
2.0,The stones are falling off
2.0,The waist is you tight :( not good for relaxing.
2.0,Get what I paid for overall was a good shoe
2.0,I bought the dress a size to big with hopes of it going to my feet like in the picture however it was still too short for me. I gave the dress to my mother that is 2 dress sizes smaller than me and it was still snug on her and only went to above her ankles.
2.0,Very uncomfortable but super cute
2.0,"You get what you pay for? I liked the style ish but the material was scratchy and the dress was way too big. I ordered a standard size that was an inch larger than my bust, but the bust was significantly larger than my body and gaped out. I forgot to take a picture of the back, but the lace up detail in the back looked like it just replaced a zipper, so it didn’t actually show much since the sides completely met. I also found the sellers difficult so I wouldn’t buy this again."
2.0,Pink collar is a TOTALLY DIFFERENT shade of pink from the mask!
2.0,Love them my 2nd order
2.0,This may have been a nice pendant if it had not arrived extremely tarnished (looked like copper) and with a chip in the stone.  Returned.
2.0,Dislike: size. Too stretch also package was received open without one item.
2.0,Description says 100 pieces
2.0,"The ballet shoe will serve it's purpose, especially for the price. However, the size is way off. My daughter uses 7US as a 3 year old and I purposely ordered an 8US to allow her foot some room for comfort. The shoes were still way too small; the size chart is a hoax. Seems like they just posted a standard size chart. Not cool, because obviously nobody wants to visit UPS to go through the whole process of returning, SOOOOOO with that said, buy 3 sizes up people. Instead of an 8US I should've gotten a 10US. Hope this helps."
2.0,Lived the design and the colors but the sizing is completely off. An XL is more like a small.
2.0,"Some flaws:<br />- sleeves have to be ironed to stay folded, but the fabric doesn’t hold ironing well<br />- the drawstring area lays weird me.<br />- color and length are good, it’s just kinda sad looking so I’m not gonna wear it.<br />Hope the pic helps."
2.0,the bottom was more flared out than i expected. might work better on someone with longer legs..😬
2.0,"Cute boots, fit great, looked great but the heel pealed off on the second day of wear.  Returned it no problem."
2.0,"The sizing on these is crazy... I followed advice and ordered a size 8 (my foot measures to a 7.25) and it was a little small. I ordered an 8.5 and it felt like a full size too big. I decided to return because they didn't feel that great to me. I am used to wearing minimalist shoes so that wasn't the issue, these seams and other materials felt cheap and definitely not worth the high price."
2.0,This is so cute and comfy but I came with multiple holes I have had to hand sew. The only reason I am not returning is because I can sew them up myself. Also wish it had pockets but not a dealbreaker.
2.0,Cheap plastic clip. Already broke and it hasn't even been a month.
2.0,Product runs small. If you are heavy chested you may need to order up 2 sizes. Not as picture
2.0,"This seems like a beautiful dress and it came right away, but where other reviewers said it was too large, I ordered a size up. It fit nicely but it was SO long. I'm 5'2 and usually a dress like this falls just below my knees but in this case it fell almost to my ankles. Not attractive at all. If you're a shorty I'd say try another dress. I had to return it.<br /><br />The dress itself had a stiff feeling but maybe a couple of washings would get that out."
2.0,The straps broke after a few months of use. It was really good for carrying things but the straps gave way when carrying too many heavy things
2.0,I only wore the black one once and the side tore.  ONE time....and that's the color I needed the most.
2.0,I hated them!! I bought these for my daughter because she loves leggings and always wears them. From the picture they look amazing! When we got our package we opened them and there were holes all in the front. My daughter being optimistic still wore them though. The holes were sewn on the the outer edges which we thought would make them more durable. Wrong!! The all tore making one huge hole! The reason I chose these from the photo is because the other styles they offered had holes and looked super tacky. These were the only one we found that looked normal and decent.
2.0,Runs smaller than the average shirt and shrunk in the wash more.
2.0,it was like putting on a blanket in 90 degrees weather....
2.0,"too small for american wrists, not made well and smelled of mildew out of the bag, they were returned"
2.0,"They are HUGE - they look small (as advertise) - Unless you got a big a$$ head, try to find something smaller."
2.0,"Ok product but doetlast very long at all, they fell apart on me in about two weeks."
2.0,To tight in chest
2.0,"This was the most ill-fitting costume. I’m 5’3 and typically wear small tops, size 4/27 in pants. It is made of good material, however, the straps were way too long, the dress came down to my knees. If I wouldn’t have hemmed the costume it would not have worked."
2.0,So cute in the pic...hated the material!
2.0,"These pajamas are super cute, but I would never wear them. The material is very scratchy and there is no tag to distinguish front from back.  You get what you pay for and the influencers that promote these products are probably not wearing them to bed either."
2.0,This item was just ok. Very  flimsy and made awkwardly. The arms were not right. But I needed it and kept it. I will probably let my little girl play dress up in it now.
2.0,"They are a beautiful pair of gloves that I never got to try on. The strap that loops on the finger was broke. If I were to buy these at the store I would have just exchanged them for another set, They really are a beautiful pair of gloves!"
2.0,Looks cheap... She won't be impressed.
2.0,Looks very cheap like it should be in a childs play set. Good lighting doesn't evem help.
2.0,"I love the necklace and the high polish shine however, it broke my neck out."
2.0,very cheap and thin --not what i expected at all!
2.0,"The mask was overly large, smelled funny when opened, and arrived nearly a month after it was due to arrive."
2.0,I didn't really like the neon colors. It also pinches in at the waist in a weird way.
2.0,A small looks like a large!  The lettering won’t last a wash. Sad
2.0,Fit and appearance is as described. However the band leaves impressions in my skin and itches after a couple of hours. Finally stopped using after I started to develop a scaly rash.
2.0,"I was very excited to receive this necklace. The very first day I wore it, it turned my neck green. I gave it another try and it did the same. It was very disappointing."
2.0,I love the look of this band. After 2 weeks of normal use it broke! The silver piece which holds the band to the watch totally snapped. I'll be looking for a tougher band with the same look.
2.0,Unfortunately we received Gold crown not silver and. It’s needed April 21 for senior prom. The crown is beautiful just wrong color.
2.0,"Sadly, this dress ripped without even being able<br />To wear it."
2.0,"Super thin, and minimal leather coverage. Not sure what I should've expected for such  a low price, but these won't last through a day of average use."
2.0,"I liked these shirts at first. My husband wore them around 3 to 4 times each and now when I wash them it looks like the fabric is snagging. I am not washing them with anything other than like items, so not sure why it’s happening. He definitely cannot wear them to the gym now."
2.0,"I bought these for the primary purpose of &#34;non-slip&#34; warmth, but while the dots don't slip, my feet INSIDE the socks do. The fabric is so soft and slippery that I have less stability than if I had regular socks on. I also concur with other reviewers that I can feel the dots through the socks, enough to make them uncomfortable enough that I'd prefer cold feet. So, if you just want aloe socks and won't walk in them, they're great-nice fit, nice colors, easy on and off and I have 4 pair to share with you. Just don't go for a walk!"
2.0,I watched Iron Man and thought I might like a pair of these.  They are cheesy at best.  WIfe said she would be embarrassed to see me in public wearing these.
2.0,The helmet is made from a very plyable poly rubber like material. The heat from a cheap hair dryer can be used to reshape or miss shape the helmet. My visor was smashed and I have been completely unable to fix it. The visor is also attached with a hot glue gun and foam tape. The helmet is great as a toy/prop for my daughter but trash for cosplay. If you are looking at this for cosplay I highly recommend spending the money and getting a helmet that is 100% resin cast.
2.0,"I'm 5 months pp and wanted a pair of workout shorts that didn't have the tight squeezing band at at the top so I thought these would work good because of the flat waist band. However, what I got instead was a pair of shorts that squeezed all of my lower abdomen fat together. Now I realize I am carrying more fat on my body than many so if you are super in shape these might be the ones for you, but for the average Joe they are super unflattering. They also ride up constantly when I'm trying to work out"
2.0,Super cheap material. The sleeves are itchy and not nearly as it looks in the picture. The actual cropped part is also much shorter than pictured. Returned.
2.0,"Ok, I'm addicted to compression clothing so I know my stuff. These tanks run small. I'm 5&#34;9 200 lbs athletic build with wide shoulders. At first I didn't mind, but after a day or so it started to annoy. The materiel is uncomfortable and I would not recommend this  ever... Sorry y'all"
2.0,Socks are very thin so if you want them for winter warmth or hiking shop elsewhere. The dark blue toe are worn by a US size 9 woman the grey toe worn by a US size 8 woman. I wanted then for hiking and winter warmth so probably would not buy again.
2.0,The sweater was great except the hole in the band and it was a bit shorter than what it looked like on the model.
2.0,Ripped along the seam before the performance
2.0,Not really what I thought but ok.
2.0,"Although it looked good on, it did not feel good at all.  Not only is the material very cheap (i.e., very thin and scratchy - not at all smooth-feeling), but the design of the pants was tight on the lower half of legs and not attractive on the top part."
2.0,This was not the sweatshirt material I expected. It felt cheap and shiny. It also ran smaller than expected. If I didn’t need it for a gathering that evening I would have returned it.
2.0,Hard to clasp and kind of small and I have a small neck!
2.0,"I ordered the faded black jeans only to find out they were dark blue, washed them once and they faded to medium blue, it’s annoying really because they fit great. I may return them if they get lighter"
2.0,Tried everything want stay n my ear or others I've given to try. Very pretty but if I can't show off...waste. back to my boring cartilage.
2.0,Not great for larger chests. The band is super thin and these shrunk after one wash.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:c2bbd5569e476797c41aca5dae77106b]] I ordered the letter “A” and the gold ring came in what I believe to be the letter “I” or something else. So frustrating and annoying. I don’t have the time or energy to to return it!
2.0,Slippers are okay but are cheaply made. It'd be better to spend a little more money and get a better made and longer lasting pair.
2.0,I need to use the fabric shaver after every use. I won’t be sad when she outgrows it.
2.0,Muy apretado
2.0,Pretty cheap ....
2.0,Very tiny bag and it arrived extremely late. Poor packaging
2.0,La pulsera está exelente muy bonita pero no se puede abrochar no queda fuerte
2.0,Runs to big and is not very flattering
2.0,"They’re pretty, and okay quality, only issue was that Most of these were too big, but a couple were too small to wear in my septum."
2.0,Fits very small. You have to have tiny tiny arms.
2.0,I should’ve read the description better and realized these are two separate pieces. The entire reason I ordered them was to have a single piece loop to replace the apple loop sport band which I find easiest to put on and stays on best of all the designs I have tried. I also was very disappointed that “storm Gray” looks more blue than gray. Giving two stars because it’s my fault for not reading fine print about the two pieces and because the price is cheap so it’s not a huge loss. Otherwise I would not recommend this product.
2.0,Not as described.  Was very disappointed with the quality of the material and style.  Very poorly made.
2.0,"UPDATED REVIEW AFTER ALMOST TWO MONTHS: These Pants still smell. Also the waist band is cut on a different grain from the pants and is v. Uncomfortable over time. I can still only wear them once and need to wash and dry them, but each time they wash/dry they smell again. DON'T WASTE YOUR $$<br /><br />Pants fit well. They loosen up a lot over the course of the day. Worst problem was the SMELL. They smell chemical-like. Almost like strong mothballs or cedar chest smell. I washed them three times and it didn't get better. I put them out in the sun to dry and it didn't help. The fourth wash I put odor remover in the laundry and that helped for the most part but they still have a little bit of the smell."
2.0,"Comfortable, good looking but broke the second day at the pins leather is to thin. If u work in an office probably be fine."
2.0,My husband wore this necklace for not even 24 hours and he was taking his shirt off and it broke... It is very pretty however.
2.0,Difficult to put on/take off and toe box construction isn't smooth; overall inferior to SB Sox
2.0,Got these as a gift from my wish list. The came. Super cute but one of the backs of the earrings doesn't fit the distorted pin on the back of one of the earrings. I hope I can get a replacement pair as I just got these!
2.0,"It's not as pictured above. The straps are much more sturdy and thick in the picture. The ones i received were very thin, like spaghetti straps, and my immediate thought when i unwrapped it was it looked like it was made for a child."
2.0,Stylish but a bit pricey after a week the metal seem to scratch bad and also the top gem is not set tight and spins in circles and I'm. Afraid It will fall. Off soon
2.0,Too tight. Order one size up.
2.0,I was hoping to find a sports bra that would provide support for 'fast' walking and light workouts.  Unfortunately this does not meet my needs.  I am a 38 D. I followed the size guide and ordered an XL.My breast are mashed together and spilling over the top.  The back straps which cross are always twisting or rolling into a little string.
2.0,"Get what you pay for, super cheap material"
2.0,"The item is a warmup jacket. The size is super small, normally I wear XL, BUT I had to order 3XXL. The zipper is tragically hard to zip anytime downwards and I had to pull the zipper off in order to get it to zip somewhat correctly."
2.0,Way too big. Have jeans the same brand
2.0,Very yellow. The size didn't bother me but the color was listed as 'beige.' Not a flattering hue on me.
2.0,The mask itself is fine but it’s way too small!
2.0,"Ordered same size as all the other hoodies I’ve ever ordered and some from the same sellers, yet this one is way to small. It fit my gf who’s a foot shorter then me perfect though lol."
2.0,"I was looking forward to a loose fitting, thicker fabric sweate,r with the cute over-sized zipper like the one in the photo. This was not what I received. The material was thin and cheap, and it was shorter and form fitting. The zipper was also small. Overall, a disappointment."
2.0,The sleeves on the shirt are way to tight and small for a 3X. Doesn’t really stretch. Not true to size. The color is way off as well it was supposed to be purple and it looks blue.
2.0,"The sizes seem to be right, as far as I can tell. They do not run too small or large. I ordered the pink & white stripe. However, the material is slightly scratchy & very see through! Very disappointed in the material & would most definitely not purchase again!"
2.0,The metal clasps are very poor quality. I feel like one wash and this will fall apart. Super cheap and not worth the money I paid for it.
2.0,"These sandals were beautiful my 2 year old loved them she never complained when she had them on. Unfortunately a little over a month after purchasing them one of the sandals broke from a piece that connects the part with the bow and the part with the velcro, and she was no longer able to wear them any more."
2.0,"I was concerned that this would be one of those ""looks great on this model and totally different on me"" shirts and it definitely is!  It looks more like a thinner, softer cardigan, open sweater than anything.  The tie how she has it didn't look right at all, like I had just decided to tie the bottom of a cardigan and it was not meant to be that way at all.  If it wasn't so thin and the sleeves were slightly short and very loose, I would have just kept it to use as a cardigan, but ended up returning it instead."
2.0,"I ordred the color G-Beige, but when it came, it looked more like G-Camel."
2.0,Product looked nice and felt comfy on the first use. By the second use the joggers were coming apart at the seams. These pants were used for lounging around the house(Nothing strenuous).
2.0,Not comfortable. No tread on bottom at all - slippery walking on all surface types. Very thin boots. Toes get crunched in these. Wouldn't buy again.
2.0,"Super cheap and super bad quality, it's too big also"
2.0,"I purchased these for post c-section and was not a fan of the material used. It was very thick and not soft at all, even after multiple washes. After surgery I wore leggings and the thick material of these showed right through everything I wore. Would not recommend."
2.0,"This choker look awesome in the pictures and nice when you get it, unfortunately it is at least a inch and a half before it will even wrap around my 14 year old daughters neck. Not even room to make another punch hole to fit my dogs neck. Oh well…that sucks…"
2.0,the quality is bad.
2.0,When I received these they were not heart shaped at all. From a few feet away you couldn't even tell they were supposed to be a different shape. I ultimately returned them.
2.0,Eh. Main complaint is the the fogged part of the lenses don’t go down fair enough. Train in Piper archers and if I lift my head up at all I can see out the windscreen.
2.0,"Works great if you have a small head. But this was even too small for my daughter, who is 8."
2.0,"I really like the design of this purse! But I was disappointed at how small it is.  I also don’t like that the lining is loose and snapped to the purse rather than sewn in. The leather of the purse itself is very soft and luxurious, though the handles and shoulder strap don’t seem to be leather at all."
2.0,"This product material was very cheap, and the sizing was very small. I wear a large T-shirt and I ordered an XL and it was extremely tight."
2.0,"The plastic corners are sharp and poke me.<br />The plastic sticks to my face, making it sweaty"
2.0,"poor fabric , looks like a curtain"
2.0,"Did not fit well, very loose and cheap looking."
2.0,Got a medium I thought would be more fit. But it's way too lose. :(
2.0,Cute set but the bra is terrible. It fits a little awkwardly but what’s really bad is that the padding is cheap and actually makes creaky sounds whenever it is pressed on!!! Oh and forget wearing it underneath normal clothing with that crazy pattern. Looks ridiculous.
2.0,I read great reviews and decided to give a try. I ordered 2 different pairs.  They are super soft but too long and too big. I ordered the Xs and thought it felt more like a small. The back is not my favorite cut. I returned
2.0,Sizing is off!  It fits very small
2.0,"Love design, weak construction"
2.0,"These briefs are comfortable for day-to-day wear, and would be supportive enough for moderate athletic use if they weren’t so flimsy.<br />They do not stand up well to wear, especially in activities like horse and bike riding, tearing out in the seat."
2.0,Be careful but notch keeps coming undone in your watch can fall off your arm
2.0,"Fabric is too thin, does not hang well."
2.0,I ordered a Large and it fit like a small. Plus the material is very thin. Be careful of the underwear you wear underneath because it will show through.
2.0,I ordered the navy and yellow but got the navy and white. Decent socks if you aren't picky about the colors you get.
2.0,These fit too far away from my face and didn’t fit over my glasses. I had to return them.
2.0,Uncomfortable for me.
2.0,"for the price its fine, but I wouldn't suggest buying it if you will wear it In harsh conditions."
2.0,Face cracked the day after I received it and not even sure how as I had it in my pocket with nothing else.
2.0,"Cute shorts, but pockets way too small to be of benefit"
2.0,"I like the look of the dress and the fit, however the material is very polyester and feels polyester. When you stretch the fabric width-wise you can see white appearing between the ribbing of the ""knit."" If my breasts were any bigger, my chest would look like it was a lighter color than the rest of the dress. I wish it had some cotton in it."
2.0,"This is a complete mess, I purchased a M blouse and it is like XL, very cheap fabric and the bow is not like in the picture. I regreat for this shop."
2.0,Gave it two stars because it’s cute but the hat is WAY too big to be 0-3 months.
2.0,The bag was small/flimsey but the thing that ruined it was the strap. It was a completely darker shade than the actual bag and was very off-putting.
2.0,It was ok the colors were nice and stuff but the sleeves were really big and puffy and there’s a weird line separating the sleeves. Also the fabric is really weird not sweatshirt material. I might wear it around the house but not out
2.0,"I like the case, the color and what came with it but I am returning it. I could not hear when my phone rang or watching videos."
2.0,Very comfortable but the writing on the mask doesn’t show what it says just shows the smile when I wear it. Very thin I work outside and it always falls off my face.
2.0,These are not athletic socks. they run way too small and they are way too thin. At least they're cheap.
2.0,Nice sunglasses but the pair I got are crooked. Returning to get another pair. Hopefully the replacements are ok!
2.0,"I got the one with the button's, which are fake.  It was waaaaaaay too tight in the bust.  I am a 36, and unless you are a 32, I don't see it working for you, unless you like the girls overflowing!  It was not chiffon either.  It is polyester.  If the top works for you, it would be cute.  BTW, none of the pictures people have in reviews are of the dress with fake buttons."
2.0,"Im going to be generous & 2☆ this item.  To echo other reviewers' experiences, shirt may have gotten rated higher if sizing was more accurate.  Ordered brown/white plaid 3XL, which i absolutely love the color BUT when i put it on it felt like a muscle shirt, is a bit shorter and snug than anticipated, would have exchanged for 4XL if option was available. This just fits okay at best so ill keep it, though i feel as though ill regret the decision after a 2nd or 3rd wear.  REALLY wish the 3XL was more 3XL-y and less XL-y. Should have seen this though, noting its China origin.  Maybe this is a boy's 3XL? 🤔"
2.0,These are way to small and they advertise as the same error if Drew’s which there is no comparison.
2.0,They were too short. They also felt like wearing a swimsuit as pants.
2.0,The stud itself is perfect but the earring as a whole is too big. It sticks outside of my nose.
2.0,i was nervous about the one size fits all- surprisingly it fit but it immediately stretched and started to look raggy it doesnt hold well... no need to return it but would not recommend it to anyone<br /><br />then i washed it hung it to dry and it got worse! the ties on the sides got pulled and extra stringy
2.0,"Def not add wide as pictured, but did the job. The pice makes it look a lot better. I was suckered in. Still,  I used it every day on my honeymoon,  so there's something to say abt it not damaging.  Just wish it looked better."
2.0,"First of all, I wouldn't really call this a blouse since it doesn't have sleeves. It's more of a poncho. It's not quite as long in the front as I expected but its not terrible. But the animal print rolls up in front and exposed the underside of the fabric. The solid green version of this doesn't do this."
2.0,After a los of Very nice and kind emails My dress was Very Very big. Still debating what to do with it. Is beautiful but I won't be able to wear it!
2.0,"I’m not sure if i got some broken ones or what , bit both of them were just not holding one my watch so I returned them."
2.0,didn’t fit my 16G hole but was pretty
2.0,They don’t work with my iPhone 14 Pro so I basically overpaid for thin gloves.
2.0,"Top part fits fine, its just sleeves are waaaay too small. If you have super thin arms and want to buy top, go ahead. If not, don’t bother."
2.0,"Very thin, arm length is too short"
2.0,"The color is dark brown, nearly black. Also the texturized look is much less noticeable than in the picture, it's more smooth and shiny.<br /><br />I have a 30 inch waist and have to use the last hole on the 32-34 size."
2.0,"These fit small. I have a smaller face and these still felt like child sized glasses. The nose/bridge rest is also quite stiff, no padding, and not at all adjustable."
2.0,not as comfy as my thin titatnium band..
2.0,"The wig arrived earlier than expected which was great. When I took it out of the package it was as long and soft as everyone else described. Unfortunately, when I put it on it had some gaps around the scalp and back so you could clearly see through to the wig cap (and my dark hair) underneath. It could be a dud based on what other people have said, but who knows. I decided to return it, which was much less painful than I had expected. The customer service was fantastic! Timely and respectful. Although the wig didn't work out for me, I wouldn't hesitate to buy from the same people again."
2.0,Way too big for head
2.0,the set looks cheap and chintzy not worth the price
2.0,"The pendulum is really nice and pretty big, about the size of a 50 cent piece, but the chain on it is very cheap and the latch is horrible."
2.0,I love the bright colors of these earrings and I wore them proudly… for two days. Then the stem of one of them broke off and I’m going to have to buy replacements to repair it.
2.0,"Compre estos zapatos para unas vacaciones, después de solo 2 usos se empezaron a romper el material es muy malo y con solo rozar el piso se despeluza y comienza a romperse, mis vacaciones duraron una semana y solo pude  usarlo 2 días antes que se abriera un hueco en el lado del dedo gordo.<br />Nota: las zapatos no quedaban apretados, más bien desahogados, el hueco se hizo del poco roce del pie con el piso. ( poco roce pues mi bebé apenas caminaba estuvo más tiempo cargada que caminado)"
2.0,Really cute design but you cannot fit your head through the top and I have a small head. I figured I could cut a V in the back and stitch along the lace. This worked fine but then I realized the lace on the bottom of the shirt was torn. I would have returned it if I had noticed the tear before I modified the neck opening.
2.0,returned.  never kept time.
2.0,"I just got mine today , I was all excited to open my package knowing that I could wear it to where I was heading to the next day but it came it in ""M"" and I ordered a small ... so disappointed about it ... everything seems so cute and so comfortable but I wish they could've sent me my small size  .."
2.0,"VERY FLEMSY!!! It looks cheap like a nightgown, nothing like picture"
2.0,everything is a lot smaller than expected. It would be good for travel.
2.0,"These are buttery soft. Like nothing else I’ve worn. I love them. So why the 2 stars? They are see through. I do a lot of bending at work and don’t want to worry if my cardigan is long enough to NOT show my panties. Complete bummer because I want them so badly... but sadly I think I’ll be returning. I wear a 12 to 14 depending on the brand and they fit wonderfully. They weren't too tight like yoga leggings, the ONLY problem I had was the see through issue unfortunately."
2.0,"Not flattering at all. The material is thin, clingy, and unforgiving. It's a t-shirt... pretending to be a dress."
2.0,Way too large...<br />I ordered a youth XLarge for my 12 year old son. It fits my husband who wears adult Large-XLarge. This is sized ridiculously large.
2.0,Doesn't really do anything except an expensive piece of undie and attractive marketing. I sent it back.
2.0,These socks are way too loose and do not fit right enough to stay up
2.0,The picture looks much better than the product.  The fabric is cheap.  Not worth the money.
2.0,Nice but over priced for the quality of material.
2.0,Liked look and style and size but come undone to easily..
2.0,"Feels nice, but doesn't stay in place unfortunately. The skirt rides up despite the rubber banding on the bottom. I wore it in my friends wedding and my boyfriend had to block me from view a few times so that I could inconspicuously pull it down."
2.0,"Do not buy, too small my couldn’t even put them on"
2.0,"It fit a little small, I should have ordered the M. I also was unawares that the skit is very short in the front."
2.0,I love the pattern and the fabric is ok if a bit sheer but the size was too small for me to wear
2.0,"Returned. If you’re a normal or larger chested woman (I’m a D) this will not work for you. It was awkward, instead of accentuating the chest it pulled them in. If you have curves, this dress is not for you. Perfect for very slender woman."
2.0,"posts bent and miss matched backs. Size is nice, cut is pretty"
2.0,I wore this shoes maybe five time since I purchased them and they are coming apart
2.0,"Both of the two bands that hold the strap in place started to tear within the first 4-6 weeks of use, and then about 3 months in, the silicone strap broke completely off from the plastic piece that fits onto the watch. Glad it happened when I was indoors or I might have lost the whole watch without realizing it had fallen off."
2.0,"The dress is a beautiful dress! I didn't care for the fabric, length and fit of the dress. Item was received damaged"
2.0,Too tight on the arms.
2.0,"They feel nice, however I got a run that extended from front to back within a minute of wearing them. If you don't plan on bending or crouching, moving or heck, wearing them these are the leggings for you."
2.0,I am usually an XL / 16 and this was too small
2.0,It was nice but the back was completely white and you could see my bra straps and pants
2.0,stick out 10mm and cling to everything
2.0,"Super cute swimsuits and they seem well made. Definitely order up though, my daughter is in the 14-16 size range so that’s what I ordered and they are pretty small. I would say it’s fits more like a 12."
2.0,"Definitely not suitable for something formal like a wedding. The earring layers are not symmetrical and some of them have larger gaps than others. This makes it clearly look more sloppy than the photo, where every layer of rhinestones is spread out evenly."
2.0,Cheap 2 cent worthless garbage. Don't waste your cash
2.0,"Poor fit, won't line up on my foot properly."
2.0,"the clip on is way too small. have problems gripping the clip. The lenses are alot larger than thought to be. and they dont want to stay down in position, rather sticks out instead of down"
2.0,I read the reviews earlier and everyone said that they got the wrong size some people said that if it has expect that but I got the wrong size I ordered a medium and I got a small I will order again and when I do I expect a medium.
2.0,"Very thin, flimsy and clingy fabric. It's the kind of fabric that clings to all your lumps and bumps and is very unflattering. I was hoping to wear these out and about but they are too thin and a little see through.<br />The seams are so thick and hard they press into your skin which makes wearing them VERY uncomfortable.<br />If it were not for those thick seams pressing on your legs they would be comfortable.<br />It's sad because the cut and style are so nice and promising but then they ruined with using awful fabric.<br />They also run a little small. I normally wear a size M with room but got the size L because I wanted them to be oversized but instead they only just fit."
2.0,The ID holder started to come apart pretty quickly
2.0,"Design is good, but shirt quality is low. Has a very &#34;boxy&#34; fit, sleeves stick out and do but hug the arms."
2.0,"Sunglasses were great....at first. Lens was clear and visual picture was excellent. Fitment was also excellent.<br />Then, after only 6 weeks of daily wear, the ear piece departed the aircraft (it fell off). No protection for my ear equals discomfort and inability to use/wear. Therefore, down graded to a 2 star. Unfortunate, as these sunny's started out so well and ended so poorly, so quickly."
2.0,It’s not standard. Waste of money
2.0,"Not great material/quality. Looks nicer online, cheaper in real life. Material was super thin and felt like it would rip so easily"
2.0,"The goggles were smaller than expected, and they did a poor job of preventing fogging."
2.0,"The material is good.  It would be nice to have in true American sizes.  Many of the fashions made in Asia are of good quality, just too small for the American curvy woman."
2.0,It's a cute dress. But the material is thin in the armpit holes are huge.
2.0,"Soft material but colors faded after just 1 wash. Quality is just ok, colors went from bright to dull & I didn’t even put it in the dryer."
2.0,It’s a lovely piece and I may try to order again in a much larger size.  The M would fit a child.
2.0,"The sizing chart said to buy up a size.  I'm usually a M/L and ordered a Large.  This corset is terrible quality.  There is no way that you could wear it under a dress because it bulges in the stomach area.  I purchased this to wear as a smoothing element under a cocktail dress and I will be returning it because you could so obviously see it under the dress.  The straps are nice and thick, which I liked, but overall this is a poorly designed product."
2.0,Broke on first day. Got refund thru Amazon.
2.0,"Pretty, but very bad cuality. Two days of use."
2.0,See thru but very nice
2.0,I did not like the way it attached with the buckle. The loop stuck out too far and it bugged me
2.0,"If your a type of person like me where you are constantly running around, busy, working out, etc. these are not the type of leggings that you want. These leggings do not stay up when you are working out or getting in and out a a car or even just running errands."
2.0,These Marino long leg warmers are for very skinny legs!  I couldn’t get them very far above my ankles.  They don’t stretch and they aren’t that warm!  My 10 year old granddaughter can wear them.
2.0,"Not nearly as good as Adidas socks.  Began pilling after first wash and when worn, are thin enough to see the shinguards underneath."
2.0,Shirt is cute but extremely form fitting.  Can't imagine a plus size woman wanting to wear something so form fitting.
2.0,"LOVED it, very comfy then I washed it in the gentle cycle and the tassels fell apart and it's one big tangled mess of threads."
2.0,Wore for about an hr. and are very heavy.  The weight stretched my earlobes making them look silly. This is one of those &#34;drawer items&#34; that you might not see again for years.
2.0,Way too short. I am only 5' 7&#34; and the dress is two inches from my crotch.
2.0,Loved this dress but after 6 or more washing it unraveled around the neckline😫
2.0,I’m 5’6 and it barely covered my bottom. Felt like a cheap table cloth.
2.0,"Although I liked the watch, it was sent to me with a dead battery, so it was essentially useless. I was using it, primarily, as a prop but it would have been nice to actually use it."
2.0,Too long. Sent back. And the color wasn't the same as the photo
2.0,As other reviwers have mentioned these broke easily. I also bought a cheap 12 pack of adult  sunglasses around the same time for my kid to play with. Those have yet to be broken.
2.0,"too light in color much less pink than the picture, disappointed"
2.0,"This shirt did not match the color online. It looks like it would be a dusty rose color, but it's actually closer to an orange/cantaloupe color. I returned it."
2.0,"Cheap material,  looks like something you'd see grandma wearing in a nursing home. And its shorter than you'd think."
2.0,"The color is nice, but this dress is too tight! I ordered a size up and still is inappropriate. I had my heart set on this dress. Waisted money for sure"
2.0,Color was good however the material looked and felt “cheap”. Very lightweight more like cotton sheeting as opposed to heavier weight cotton you would expected for a jacket. One of the few items that I had to return . Appreciate Amazon easy return policy via my local Kohl’s store.
2.0,I wanted this to fit so bad. I usually fir into a much bigger too than a bottom. I ordered a large because the sizes said to run small. The too fots fine but the bottoms are HUGE. when i tried to return no one sent me return labels and there is no way to contact the seller. Id buy it else where if you can find it. Not worth spending your money to have to send it back.
2.0,The belt loosens with little to no agitation. Buckle occasionally unclasps for various reasons
2.0,Couldn't wear it every day.  Gave me a terrible rash.  That has never happened before with other rings.
2.0,"The dress that I have received was definitely not 3/4 sleeve. It was a long sleeve. Partially side of the dress was loose, showed a bump. I kinda looked like an old grandma in it. It’s looks cute, but definitely not for me. Had to do a return."
2.0,Very thin fabric. Didn’t wash well
2.0,"This outfit could possibly be cute.... its extremely small, tho. I ordered my usual small and I couldn't even get it on( Im a small/xsmall) in all my workout clothes. So... I guess, order up a size or 2 and see if it works for you."
2.0,"The fit is good and is comfortable. I liked the way it looked when I recieved it. However, after only two weeks, the bronze pattern has worn off from a significant part of the band."
2.0,Didn't really stop the glare...but my eye doctor did tell me not to expect much help from any anti-glare glasses.
2.0,Color and fit not the same as in photo. I ordered small and they were still big but not in a cute  “boyfriend jeans” kind of way. I returned them.
2.0,"The description is clear, however, the pictures are very deceiving. If you don't read the description fully you will be in for a big surprise. You do not get a handful of stones like in the pictures, you get 4, just as the description says. And the 4 stones that you get are not anywhere near the quality of the stones in the pictures. The stones are more white than yellow-orange. They are pretty. Just not what we were looking for."
2.0,"Look good, but broke like a week after I got them. The tiny screw just fell out and was lost forever."
2.0,Dress too long
2.0,The material and the dress are not the same as the photo.
2.0,It did not fit the front at all give it to my daughter she loved it.
2.0,It was too small and smelled like plastic
2.0,They’re cute and trendy! Def cheap metal quality and my grips on the handles were already sliding off but that’s what low costs gets you. I def expected a little better quality because forever 21 glasses are $5 and would fare better honestly.
2.0,"I placed my order for the larger size offered and shown as available BUT the order switched to the smaller size which is tighter than that which would be comfortable to me.  Only the color ID is shown on the package with no other identification.  I do not believe these socks have the high cotton content as listed,  they certainly do not feel like it to me.  Very skimpy ID and appear/feel to me to be of poor quality.  I ordered these socks as samples to see if they were good so I might order more.  NO WAY!"
2.0,The cut would be flattering. However the pink dress is entirely see through even when wearing a slip or nude colored undergarments.
2.0,Way smaller sizes
2.0,Easily broke after 3 weeks of minimal wear. Bad product.
2.0,It broke a week before i got it. the chain came off and i tried to fix it but i made it worse. Dont buy this unless your willing to take the time to repair it with careful hands
2.0,"This was a great vest with a long lasting battery but unfortunately the wire that connects to the battery wore out very fast causing it break. Now, the heating component of the vest is useless after one season. I tried to salvage it by trying to tape it but it didn't help. The wiring should last longer than this based on the cost."
2.0,not of good quality. equal quality of a ring coming from a quarter machine
2.0,no support in the bra area
2.0,Couldn't tell how to tie?
2.0,Ordered for my twin daughters one of the shirts have no elsatic in it and hangs down and shows her chest and i have no way to put elastic in myself and this was supposed to be the outfitt for their first day of school and on top of that the ones pair of pants is definitely faded and looked like they were washed and then returned cute outfitts but just wish it was better quality now idk what im gonna do
2.0,"NOT for a size 12 or 14 women, Its makes you look bigger because its Puffy."
2.0,"They don't come any where near the thigh, just over the knee, and they roll down. The band at the top needs more attention to detail to help it stay flat. It does not roll down pass the knee but it is not a pretty look."
2.0,Very disappointed..not true to size marked at all!!!
2.0,"Such a disappointment, as I went according to the size chart. Yet still this was too small. Gave a 2 star because of the color."
2.0,Noticeable uneven cut on all of them that I bought. Nice (if thin) material.
2.0,Couldnt wear them. Made my ears red and itchy.
2.0,"If you have a butt or hips you have to order 3/4 sizes up to even get that boyfriend look. Extremely off sizing, I am a true 29 by measurements and I had to return the 31s because they were barely able to be buttoned. Cheap denim material, smells like rotten eggs on arrival."
2.0,Much smaller than expected the entire earring is the size of my nail.  The stone is so small that you can't tell it's a green stone...it's more of a muddy dark color.  Disappointed.
2.0,"It broke in just over a month. The bracelet unraveled and the charms fell off and got lost. My niece was devastated and thought she'd done something wrong. (I thought of left this review before, but apparently hadn't)"
2.0,Runs small - I hope with wear they loosen up.
2.0,The wash tag says wash separate or dry clean. Feels like most hats but washing instructions make me think it won't last
2.0,A cute statement necklace. Major problem with having to super glue the two bottom center pieces back together. Get what you pay for I guess.
2.0,More space than I thought.  Raised Emblem is slightly too high. Color is not as shown some weird blue greenish color.
2.0,"I bought these because I never pierced my ears.  I needed long earrings for a party (or so my husband thought :)).  These were painful on my ears and almost immediately the clasp on one of them broke.  Luckily, my husband was able to bend it back in place.  I wore them for an hour and then felt like I was losing feeling in my ears.  Not very happy with this purchase."
2.0,"This is the second one of these I purchased (July 2017), hoping for a better design, but I think this &#34;basket&#34; is even smaller than the first one I ordered.<br /><br />I had been reading the benefits of sleeping in a silk cap so I ordered a few of them a few months ago.  Of the three different brands/styles/manufacturers I initially ordered, the pink one of these MAYMII sleeping caps (ordered April 2017) was my favorite.  My only wish was that the &#34;basket&#34; in the back that actually holds your hair was bigger.  The band around the head is comfortable, I like the tie, but there wasn't much room to put your hair.<br /><br />When I realized I'd need another one for the times when I was washing the pink one, I went back to the same MAYMII company and chose the blue flowered pattern.  I crossed my fingers and hoped that the &#34;basket&#34; on this one was more representative of the picture..but alas, it isn't.<br /><br />The two I received are more like &#34;skull caps.&#34;  My hair is short, just below my shoulders, and I have a hard time getting it to fit in the basket.  When I push my hair up and into the back, the sleeping cap slides up my head and has to be adjusted.<br /><br />I don't understand why the beautiful, functional product they advertise isn't what you receive when you order.  They seem to know what people want (based on their prototype), but they aren't shipping the same design.  To clarify the sizing, the headband part fits as expected, but the design of the back of the product is virtually non-existent.  I won't try a third time."
2.0,length was much shorter than I expected.
2.0,So narrow on toe strap but instep strap is too wide.  Not a good fit on anyone’s foot.  Franco shoes are always too narrow!  Who has such narrow feet?
2.0,"This cap seemed of fairly good quality.  Unfortunately, a product that represents a specific culture and manufacturer should be made by the company that is being advertised.  If this Irish company outsourced, I am a little disappointed.  I want my product to originate from the country that it specifically represents.  I don't like buying items from China that should be MADE IN IRELAND OR SCOTLAND.  I am not trying to take anything away from the Chinese, but it is just personal preference.  I am Scotch-Irish, so I want items made there."
2.0,"I can only give these earrings a 2, as they are far too heavy and therefore droop down.  The size is very good and the finish is lovely, but just don't sit nicely on the ear.  Hollow ones would have been better.....too bad I didn't listen to the other reviewers who said they were just too heavy."
2.0,We're cheap for the price but not what was expected
2.0,I would love for this hoodie to be like the picture was instead it was very light doll pastel colors I ordered an extra large which is what I wear in any American size large to an extra large and this was way too small around my stomach I do not understand why these clothes are not true to size we are in America I didn't think these come from China if you would send me another one that had little brighter colors and maybe a double x I will definitely give you a 5-star review
2.0,"This sucks, it's cute enough on but the groove is not deep enough to keep the hair tie from popping out every five seconds. Super irritating, buy a different brand."
2.0,I wear a 3x and ordered a 4x so I could wear this over the top of other clothes.  It barely fits my wife and she wears an extra large.  There are no size markings on the hoodie to very the correct size was sent.  Its a bummer because it us printed nicely and has an al.ost 3D appearance.
2.0,"Got a size 12 which is my normal size. This dress is cut possibly like a size 8...! The sizing is way off. Looking to return it. I hope that will not be a painful process. Nonetheless, the material is light and airy. Could be nice to wear."
2.0,"The “assortment” consisted of 5 identical purple, 4 brown, and 1 red. Very disappointed."
2.0,"Lets get to it. What I did like about this mask is the look of it, but i super glued a purple and blue wig to it to make it even better. Its too bad there is so much more I dislike about it. The most important thing  about this mask is, you  can't  really see out of it. Visibility is very poor. Second thing is that its very flimsy. What i had to do to keep the mask in good shape  was, I had to stuff it tightly with old clothes and let it sit like that to keep the wrinkles out and so that it stands up better on its own. Since it is made of latex you will be smelling it strongly while you wear it and if you wear it long enough you will probably have a hard time breathing in it."
2.0,Tight across the shoulders and chest.  Returned.
2.0,"Manufacturing defects, poor finish."
2.0,"colors featured on amazon are not indicative of what they are in real life.  The pic looks good but in acutality it's a brush brass type color.  the silver looks more like a satin chrome look, but in real life it is chrome"
2.0,This isn’t a wrap dress. It has elastic at the waist where you’re basically forced into where they think your waist should be. It’s too high and it bunches. They beauty of a wrap dress (as shown in the pictures) is you decide where your waistline is.<br /><br />The material and color is as shown so 2 star for that.
2.0,"For reference I'm at 34DD and I ordered a large did not fit at all, ended up returning it."
2.0,A  bulky seam in the crotch makes these pants feel like wearing a wet diaper. Ick!
2.0,"Let me start off my saying this is a pretty good deal, and that you get quite a few beautiful colors. However, you do get what you pay for. I ordered 00g, The box says 00g, but these are much smaller than all of my previous 00 gauges. While most of the pairs are the same color, I received a few that didn’t quite match. 1 jade gauge is cloudy and the other is clear, one amber is darker than the other, and one sparkly black gauge has much less glitter than the other."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this skirt. The material was nice for the price. Would have been great for the costume I was planning. However, even at 5'4&#34;, this skirt was super short and runs small. Luckily Amazon has a great return department and refunded my money. ;)"
2.0,It's very comfortable and feels nice.  I bought my size.<br />BUT it doesn't fit right!  The string at top doesn't keep the jeans up so when I walk around the jeans keep falling down my hips and I have to keep pulling them up.  I wish they'd make these with belt loops so I could use a real belt instead of the drawstring which doesn't work for me.<br />Overall they are nice and comfy but not practical to use.
2.0,"The small and medium organizers are really too small to use effectively as designed. I imagine the large one could be used in a hobo bag or tote, so will give that a shot."
2.0,I'm not trilled about the slippers.  The back of the slipper ripped after a week and I had to repair it.
2.0,"Gloves came promptly. Fit was good. Leather was soft. Seemed perfect. However, after only ten or so times wearing I pulled them on and the leather tore close to the wrist on the right glove. This was disappointing. This is the obvious place where a person pulls the glove on and it should have been stronger."
2.0,"I purchased this as a gift for my wife based on the reviews however, when I opened the package I was disappointed. The rose and snake are very big. I was expecting something a bit smaller. The chain appears to be very cheaply made and is not very long. It wasn't made for an adult unless you wanted to wear it as a choker. My wife says she likes it and wants to keep it but will need to get a new chain if she's going to wear it."
2.0,"Color is dark, can’t see design"
2.0,"The dress is really cute, but really runs small. I wear a xl, that is what I ordered. When ordering size up at least once. Will be using dress as pj’s ."
2.0,VERY TIGHT!  BEWARE!
2.0,"So light weight that I think I wasted my money! Oh sure you can twist the frame, but don't, the lenses may pop out."
2.0,Some what small but I do like them
2.0,Have purchased several different masks. The quality is good and the cloth portion fits my face. This PRODUCT is not good for people with bigger or longer noses and is very uncomfortable to the point I will not wear it . It actually smashed or bends your nose down making it hard to breath. Add on the cloth and pad you also are breathing threw on top of having your nose smashed downward makes it useless for me. As I stated earlier quality is good.
2.0,"First day that I wear, it had a problem!"
2.0,"Nice and colorful design however after 2 gentle washes, cold water, inside out and lined dried the fabric has pilled terribly."
2.0,"I like the look if the sunglasses.  The geen really is lovely however, first time I wore them I dropped them.  It wasn’t a big fall.  One lens fell out.  Trying to get it back in.  So far unsuccessful.  Disappointing to pay for sunglasses that don’t seem to take normal life accidents."
2.0,The cheap material
2.0,It's not suspenders its a tie around the neck halter. I was dissapointed.
2.0,"This two piece was very thin and the sleeves were a little tight on my arms as well. I would recommend looking elsewhere if you want quality. The only reason I gave two stars is because it did serve its purpose and I was able to take pictures as NewNew for Halloween which was my main reason for purchasing. Otherwise, I regret buying this two piece as I won't be wearing it again."
2.0,"As attractive as these &#34;Rose Bush&#34; anti thorn proof gloves claim to be, THEY ARE NOT THORN PROOF!  If I had my way, I'd return them as this is false advertising however, it's too late.  Very unsatisfied.<br /><br />Thank you, Carol in Anaheim, CA"
2.0,Just don’t buy this. It falls apart immediately.
2.0,These pants run 2-3 sizes small. I ordered medium for my size 4 daughter and they were way too small and short.
2.0,No back to the watch
2.0,"They are super comfy but unfortunately I have only had them for a month n half and they are already ripping, sadly I am upset because they were cheap either"
2.0,"I specifically ordered this pair for the colors: navy, fuchsia, turquoise, leaf green, etc. In actuality, they’re primary colors. Red, blue, green, blah. Otherwise they’re great. Thick and sturdy. BUT if you’re looking for softer colors, look elsewhere."
2.0,"Such a beautiful pieces but it is very fragile.. within two weeks of wearing it, it broke."
2.0,True to size but I didn't find this to be flattering
2.0,Super thin nylon material right fit may be difficult for someone with a larger built.<br />I guess it’s goo to wear with a mask underneath as added protection but not alone
2.0,Nothing was wrong with this cap besides the wording on the fabric. Letters were not complete. I returned.
2.0,Did not hold chest very well.  Not recommended for larger busted women
2.0,"Super cute, but they don't hold up very well...and my expectations weren't high to begin with."
2.0,"I bought two different sizes so my girls would match for getting ready as flower girls to a family members wedding. They were two different shades so the girls don't match now, they also had different buttons to each other and different buttons even to the ones pictured, instead of black one pair has clear buttons and the other has white. They look cheaply made and have threads hanging out. Don't have time to return them before the wedding which is very annoying.<br />They're soft that's all I'll give them."
2.0,Plastic outer started cracking and flaking off within a week of wearing. I'm betting these don't last a month.
2.0,SUPER DISAPPOINTED<br />They’re thick like they’re supposed to be. But absolutely not see through. They aren’t opaque. They are kind of cloudy. Like your windshield on a cold morning before you warm your car up.
2.0,Love the color but the shoulders are way too big even after trying to shrink it  Runs large and something is way off on the shoulder cut on a medium size
2.0,The dress was a pretty color but it smelt awful. Had to wash it 2x to get the smell out. want buy from them anymore.
2.0,"I liked the wallet,  but the inside zipper seemed like it might break easy. Needed a more sturdy zipper.  Other than that, it's a nice wallet."
2.0,"I am 5'3 130lb.  My bust is 32E.  I bought a size Medium.  It was way to tight in the bust.  The waist should have sat at my natural waist, but it was too high sitting just under my rib cage.  The fabric was rough. I felt like a linebacker and I am petite.  I had to return it."
2.0,did not like the fit or the fabric.  gave it to my daughter
2.0,"They were bent when I got them so I had to return them, but they do look super cute."
2.0,You get what you pay for........very poorly made........earpiece not glued on
2.0,"Ordered two because my daughter wanted one too, but both rings arrived tarnished. I had to use my silver cleaning cloth to get them to shine. Did the best I could to get them looking just ok. You all need to check your merchandise before mailing out."
2.0,I was too big for my daughter who is 4’11” and the small is too small ! :(
2.0,"I gave this as a gift for my teenager sister and it looked really cute and shiny at first. Next time I saw her, it was faded and does not look good. You pay for what it’s worth I guess. It’s just a cheap material and does not last too long."
2.0,These shoes have an odd finish and were way too big. I wear a women size 7 1/2 shoe and they fit a whole size larger in my opinion. The ankle is also really wide and unattractive.
2.0,"Cute, but way too big for my fingers. I range between a 5-7 ring size(s)."
2.0,This wallet did not hold up over time. Eventually the dividers tear.  Had to seek purchasing another RFID wallet
2.0,Very tight squeeze to put on.<br /><br />Regards Rishi Persad
2.0,My granddaughter really enjoyed Pedro & Pony BUT not the fact that Pedro can not actually sit on the horse.  Very frustrating.
2.0,"My bad - my father in law, besides being legally blind, is also deaf without his hearing aids. He cannot hear Time even with hearing aids turned on."
2.0,i order a us medium  size when it arrived it was an asian 3xl which was very much larger than i expected. the shirt did not fit me like a slim fit and I'm disappointed for that; I should have ordered a smaller size maybe then it would have fit perfectly maybe. I think i should purchase american made apparel that are true to their sizes. the color is great but i think the fabric is of a poor quality which might wash out after three wears
2.0,Was disappointed in the length of the shirt.
2.0,Not built to last. Got as gift just over 2 years ago. Just over 1 year in the 1st of the 4 stopped working. It then started working again for a few weeks but stopped again. Then 6 months later the 2nd stopped working so just over 2 years of use and half of them don't work. I only had it set on low turns per hour so not like it had heavy usage.Had hoped for 200 bucks that it'd last at least 3-5 years but no such luck. Small investment compared to the cost of the watches but still would have hoped for better and rather than fuss with shipping/spending $ to get it fixed plan to just take the few seconds to wind the watch I want to wear that day as collection keeps growing having 2 of these would take up space and get $.
2.0,"These were nice at first, but at 2 months, maybe earlier, they started falling apart. You can find a 2 pack of some that look exactly like this for cheaper on Amazon, so I'll try those since I liked the design otherwise. These cost too much to have to replace them regularly."
2.0,"I was looking for a bottle like this forever, but it seems that the plastic is poor quality and came broken."
2.0,This is not sized for an adult...or even a big kid. I'm kind of disappointed that only my 6 year old can wear this for crazy hat day at school
2.0,"Think your grandmother's polyester.... Fabric ia better suited for curtains (your grandmother's!) Fabric is very disappointing and will not breath. Definitely a layering dress for Fall.... Bummer it's not made of anything resembling breathable materials. Fit was fine. I'm 5'3"", 250#'s and small on top (42DD)"
2.0,Not for busty women.  If the top part was a little longer it would look better.
2.0,Really nice looking but two of the opal gems have fallen out. You get what you pay for.
2.0,I feel like it is not a real Seiko. It stopped working after 4 months. It was a gift for my husband. Don't buy.
2.0,Was too small and too short. I’m 5’4 125lbs and ordered a medium
2.0,"Initially felt comfortable. But after a brief wear-in time, I found that the padding at the bottom is minimal and quickly I began to feel the hard sole on my feet."
2.0,Color faded quickly.  Dull metal color left.
2.0,I loved it when I got it but the center piece fell off within days of recieving it
2.0,This dress did not fit well. It seemed to be off center. I had really hoped it had fit properly.
2.0,Came with pink lines marked on it. Looks like marker
2.0,the pearl  came off the post.
2.0,"Overall, the shirt seemed okay but the gold on the logo was peeling off before I took it out of the bag."
2.0,"I was disappointed...Its a cute concept for the necklaces but the quality is poor, the woman's necklace chain is really short, the males necklace chain is really long and the bow well its pointless! Not happy with this product and we don't wear them anymore...Something like this should be made to look great because they are meaningful pieces!"
2.0,"I have had this shoe since March 31, 2021 and the Velcro doesn’t stick anymore. Can the seller please contact me to get this resolved. I can’t find the contact information for this seller."
2.0,"My original review is below, but I'm updating it. This is cute for the first 2-3 wears, then after about 3 washes it fades and pills and looks cheap and old. So proceed at your own risk.<br /><br />----------------<br />Review when I first got it:<br /><br />Very cute summer dress. Hugs all the right places, so if you're trying to hide some hills and valleys, it might not be very flattering.<br /><br />Buy the size that most of your current dresses are in, as it's pretty much true to size.<br /><br />I'm 5'4"" and the length fits at just at the knees. It's perfect as a not too short dress unless of course you're quite tall.<br /><br />The black looks so chic for the price."
2.0,This dress came broken.  Not just ripped at the seam but actually torn.  Pretty disappointed.
2.0,"Fits great but you have to hand sew it closed or change the buttons to a larger button. For the price…I don’t know. Wasn’t worth it to me, but it definitely is cute. Wish it stayed closed. I would blame “too small” of a size, but that’s really not it-I ordered up and the fit is great! But the weight of the fabric and the buttons just do not make for a secure and reliable closure. Might be fun after hours… 🙃"
2.0,Look nice just didn’t like it on me.
2.0,Like the pattern. Too large for my face. Cannot adjust ear loops. Need to give dimensions
2.0,The material was very thin. Not too flattering
2.0,"The straps were so flimsy, they fell away from the medallion just by my taking it out of the box!  I shouldn't have to repair something before even getting to use it!"
2.0,The material is too thin and it's a poor quality; almost sheer-like
2.0,"I bought this for my agate loving sister for her birthday gift. The picture shows teal colors, the product I received was dark grey. It had a crack withing the stone. On the back side of the pendant it had a few spots that were scuffed up. I needed a gift and didn't have time to send it back. Overall I was hoping for more color, I chose teal because it's her favorite. If i had wanted grey I would have chose that option."
2.0,"Does NOT even come close to fitting a ID205L watch... which is very unfortunate, because it's so cute and looks to be well made. Super bummed!!"
2.0,"I love the colors, but I'm starting to wonder if these were not real Nike shorts because I ordered an xs and they fit my friend who wears a large rather well, they're absolutely too big for me, and I know what an XS Nike shorts fit like. Dissapointing"
2.0,No me gusto el pantalon
2.0,Definitively order at least a size larger!
2.0,"I like them but the first day I wore them they messed up the thing where the nose 👃 pice goes , you know that soft thing that hold on to your nose well it came off then the other one . Well it’s okay for the rice I guess . I love the style just wish it was more durable"
2.0,"I had high expectations for this product. After receiving a Barefoot Dreams blanket and socks I was ready for some of the loungewear. I am woefully underwhelmed. The fabric is ok, it’s sort of a version of a French Terry, but not cotton, which I knew. It has a sort of a shiny appearance. Not terrible, just not to my liking. The fit I particularly do not like.  For one thing, I found them too short. This is surprising since I am only 5’4! Because the length is off, the entire pant has a sort of old, matronly vibe about them. This style should be long, almost to the point of dragging. This pant doesn’t reach the bottom of a flat sandal. At first glance I figured they would be a style similar to Juicy Couture track pants from years ago. These are a big miss for me. For the price point I expected a lot more from these pants. I wear a size 27 jeans and purchased a size small. Going up a size might help with the length, but the other features are not positive enough for me to attempt a different size in this particular style. I love the blankets and the soft socks. I will look at different brand for loungewear."
2.0,"I ordered custom and fit was horrible!Top was large,hips too tight.  But, they are very accommodating. I asked them to add a sleeve before I obviously knew how the fit was and they asked me to send a picture. I did with my measurements & they were too long as well as they lined the lace which was not attractive. Also they covered the buttons in a blue satin which really cheapened the dress and shouldve had lace over the satin. Unfortunately I won't be wearing the dress for my sons wedding as I anticipated it would be perfect."
2.0,It took less than 48 hours to get a scratch. I will say on a good note they do seem to have good polarization filters. But not worth the $$ just buy the smith replacement glass Lenses
2.0,Not what I expected.  The coffee mug leaks.  The toothbrush didn’t hold a charge.
2.0,"The burnt red and cream colors in the photo are misleading. The top is actually bright red and the bottoms have a pale pink hue. The medium bottoms fit great, but the medium top is slightly too big. It can be tied tighter in the back, but a small top would have worked best for me (and I'm not small chested)."
2.0,"After one wash (hung to dry), the neck seam started unraveling. My niece bought the same leotard and had the same issue. These are cheaply made and not worth the money."
2.0,These are HUGE earrings.  I bought them as a gift but may offer to return them.  They look much cheaper in person.  Total disappointment.
2.0,"Product is not as pictured. pearls are far apart. it is very long, and rather confusing. had to disconnect some of the links and connect it back in order for this to even look like a body chain.<br /><br />Turned black after wearing it only once."
2.0,Love this line but with in a week these started to strip of color
2.0,"This is a very cute top/ cover up, but I never got to wear it! It arrived quickly but had a strong vinegar smell so I decided to wash it.  Immediately after taking it out of the washer I noticed the seam by the neck was completely ripped. Very disappointing."
2.0,"These pants were a gift for my roommate and he loved the fit.  Unfortunately, the material was awful.  Everything stuck to them and they began to pill on the first fit.  They also snagged on almost everything and he was unable to wear them out of the house after the first wear.  It's too bad because they were a great cut and fit.  After a few hours with them on, they were covered in white fuzz and fluff from who knows where because almost everything in the house is black?!"
2.0,Product is too long
2.0,Exterior bow fell off first time my daughter put them on. Good coloring & gloves seem to hold up okay otherwise. A glue gun or stitch will fix it easily but that part didn’t hold up to even one play session.
2.0,"To write on the shirt you have to have the pen right up against the shirt. If you hold it against the shirt like a pen if it's not right up against it, the pen won't write at all and it's just a big blob of light. Just not what I thought it would be. The shirt was at least 1.5-2 sizes larger than normal and it's a very weird material... Feels very chemically, not like cotton. Wouldn't want to wear it for a long time. Also wish the t-shirt was just plain white do you had more room to write on it."
2.0,The box arrived extremely battered and the plastic they used on top of the adhesive was like Reynolds wrap very thin it took me about 30 minute to peel it all off cause it was so thin and breakable the product itself though seems to be intact and nice just needs more considerate packaging
2.0,Smaller than expected. Would work for 5 and under but larger kids they are a bit tight
2.0,The hoop was bigger than I wanted.
2.0,The pants were find the top was way too small. I was very disappointed because they are cute.
2.0,"Just not what it looked like it would be in the photo. Fabric wasn't nice... Think all those ""I bought a wedding/prom dress on the internet"" stories."
2.0,Beautiful green color but was wider than I thought and lacked in length so tucking in will be best with higher waist bottoms. Also material seems like it'll fall apart/unravel easily (36B).
2.0,"More of a lavendar pink, not true to photo.<br />Too long waisted and snug for me. Also too short."
2.0,Size label is extremely innacurate
2.0,The dress was ripped in the back before I even opened the bag. The dress looks flowy but there is a mermaid-tail slip that is very constricting.
2.0,Looks well made but it took only a month of occasional wear before the weak reinforcement on the band just snapped and the watch was instantly junked.
2.0,Love the color and fabric. Returned because it looks like a nightgown on.
2.0,"I wouldn't buy this product again.  The quality is not up to Amazon's standards, but then it came from China, so I should expect it to be inferior.  Won't recommend this product to anyone"
2.0,Did not work for me. I am an ICU RN and I am on my feet continuously for 12+ hrs a day. My lower legs swell quite a bit and I needed something with compression but the compression listed on these socks really don't exist. I have short stocky legs and have had a problem with socks  being too tight and too long. These were long but I was able to roll down. The compression was like a dress sock. They even stretched when putting them on and when taking off. The print is cute though.
2.0,"If the belt were truly all leather it might be OK. I bought a Wolverine 40mm  Apache belt in 2014 that was made in Mexico and its quality. Also it's leather. 100%. This Chinese belt is not, not, not (repeat refrain 10 times) worth any money. Backside is frigging fabric! That's right...cloth. Beware. I think it might be a Chinese counterfeit, but it has all the Wolverine stamps. If you can find a Mexican belt - 5 stars."
2.0,"Chunkier than the image portrays, not the style I expected"
2.0,"It was ok, did not have a &quot;polished&quot; finish,  priced too high for quality."
2.0,"Strange fit. It fits tightly around the shoulders and chest, and it fits loosely on the arms and lower torso. On top of that, the material is made from that same cheap jersey material you might find a gradeschool football team wearing for practices."
2.0,This purse was made of good quality and seemed to be a nice looking purse. It just wasn't what I wanted so I returned it.
2.0,"Showed up with a dead battery,don't know it the watch actually works.  I would hope someone would inspect the watch before it was shipped out, but that is not the case.  So hopefully after a new battery it works and and I am pleased witht the product."
2.0,It was a child size.
2.0,Calidad no es muy buena. Divertido los diseños
2.0,"Meh. It's cute but the eye ball is weighted more than the back of the eye charm so it leans forward and you can't see the eye ball, which is obviously the point. It has potential but I don't end up wearing it much."
2.0,I liked the colors and it was breathable but it was too small for my 10 year old. I specifically bought this because the adult size in another brand was too big. Now it’s back to the drawing board.
2.0,I like the fact that the blue one that I ordered fit and I wanted them all blue and it seem like the next two shirts you'll send me were too small.
2.0,"Great-looking, comfortable, but shedding is horrible. We were constantly picking up pieces of dark fuzz from everywhere it touched, as well as in the floor. We returned it."
2.0,Not water proof by no means...
2.0,I did not like this product because the pants were too baggy
2.0,"This necklace was underwhelming to say the least. The chain is thin and the heart is also quite fragile. I've gotten several necklace prior that were also thin but did not feel nearly as flimsy as this necklace does. Also it seems a bit poorly constructed as I could not get the heart to lay in a flattering way against my skin. It always seemed to be off just a tad to where it didn't sit straight no matter how much I fussed with it. Overall, I would look else where for a better quality and more attractive looking necklace."
2.0,I wore these two times and the &#34;leather&#34; straps came off leaving a hole ... in the trash!
2.0,They very very small
2.0,Disappointed didn't have a nice finish like the picture
2.0,"One of the shirts (the black one) was very loose on the sides right underneath the arms. It seem stretched out, you can not wear it like that."
2.0,"I've had two of these watches and they are beyond reliable, durable, and exactly as pictured.  Some of these reviews are leading me to believe that maybe what this vendor is selling is NOT a genuine Timex Easy Reader. One reviewer states that what he received was not large enough for an adult. This Timex Easy Reader is definitely a men's watch - no question. Another mentions that the watch fell apart. As I say, I've bought two in the last 10 years and both are still working. I've only replaced a leather watch band on one of them because it had gotten wet repeatedly from gardening and sports. Try a different vendor. This one may be a little hinky."
2.0,It came about a month early but rather than being a true size 6 it was about a 4. The package said it was a 6. It is really cute. Since it was less than two dollars I am just going to try an fix it.
2.0,Very warm. Nice quality. XS fits like an XL... Arm length is okay but body of the shirtis very big.
2.0,"I wear a 14-16, ordered the 18, but it’s still small on me even prior to washing it. Had a weird odor to it even after washing it."
2.0,Ordered a large - didn’t even get but one leg in them
2.0,"CZs dance in the light and look beautiful, but chain construction was extremely low quality and it wouldn't stay upright, stones constantly flipped upside down. Expected more from a more pricey end of fake jewelry, you can get this same thing not in stainless steel for like $12, i thought id be getting better construction but i guess not."
2.0,"Only one of the three pair still works. One was bad right out of the box, and one the nose piece fell off after to days."
2.0,"Although this has a pretty design on it, it is not the right texture to be a towel. In fact, I didn’t even know what it was supposed to be when I opened it up. Too thin to be a throw rug, too floppy to be a wall hanging, too thin and non-absorbent material to be a towel. I have no idea what I’m going to do with this thing. I gave it 2 stars because it’s pretty, it’s just useless."
2.0,Not as long as posted
2.0,for the same price u get better
2.0,That it would be smaller
2.0,There was a 2 inch hole in the pocket because the stitching was missing.
2.0,I ordered my size and product was to small they are pretty and seem to be well made however the cup sizes are not right I ordered a DD and the tags said DD on them but the fit was more like a large C to D cup.
2.0,I love the color but I wear a lg and decided to size up to xl and it’s still too small.... very thin material too.
2.0,These are no gap but they aren't cut right or something because the no gap part sticks straight up instead of staying bent like the original Samsung bands. I would stay away from these. The quality is fine but they just don't fit right.
2.0,This is an alright backpack but it’s not 75l like it is advertised. It’s about 55-60l so it’s much smaller than advertised
2.0,"Material is not very good, too shear.  Ordered an xs which was way too big."
2.0,Very nice but the broke after a week of use.
2.0,The bust is not meant for some this size.
2.0,I'll probably return this. I bought  because all the other reviews looked great so I thought finally a good off the shoulder shirt from Amazon. When I got it the fabric was more see-through than expected and the elastic around the shoulders is really tight. You definitely can't raise your arms up or move around a lot in this top. If you do the elastic will come back up  your shoulders. It does not stay put very well at all. The fit of the top was fine. I bought a small. I am 5'3 and 145 lbs.
2.0,Hand pluckers worked just fine. Don’t for get a dial condom before you use the plucker because it’ll dick the dial. The hand press is pretty much garbage. Nothing precise about it. It gets the job done but barely.
2.0,The uppers were so soft that they had a caved in look in parts.  Shoes were shipped with no inserts at all so may have gotten smushed a bit during shipping.  But the uppers are so flimsy that I think it would be an ongoing problem.  That really detracted from the appearance of the shoe.  Returned.
2.0,"I bought this item because it was described as being large enough for a man's wrist. I measured mine to be sure it would fit. Maybe with the elastic stretched out. Quality of the beads looks great, but I will need to cut and add beads from the second bracelet if I want one that fits."
2.0,You get what you pay for! The finger part of the glove Ravels very easily! Not the best quality and there is no place for your thumb...
2.0,I got the size xxl and I'm guessing they would fit someone who is a size 12 perfectly. The quality is ok for the price.
2.0,"It is shiny, looks cheap. Runs a little large"
2.0,"Last year we got this hat from buybuyBaby in the 18 month size. This year I figured I'd go for amazon in the 2-4 years since the 18 month size was almost too small. I'm not sure if it's the different source or what, but the hat was totally different. The brim was stiffer in a cheap way. After about 2 wears my daughter managed to rip a huge hole in it. We loved the last iPlay hat, but this one went in the trash."
2.0,I disliked the fit it was to big for my wrist
2.0,"I'm a average sized female, This thing wouldn't even close on my forearm. I put it on my 90 pound girlfriend and it fully closed. This product is meant for someone 100 pounds or smaller. It almost poorly made. Not very flexible, so it doesn't form to anyone's arm well."
2.0,Hard to clip and unclip on clothes.
2.0,too short and slip underneath shorter than the dress.
2.0,"These mirrored glasses seem well made, are very light weight (.66 oz), comfortable to wear and come with a nice, soft, non-leather case. That's the good part.<br /><br />The lenses are very dark. It makes things in shadows harder to see. Didn't notice any polarizing effect. Worst of all, light shining on sides of face reflects off the inside of the lenses making it look like there’s something on the lens obscuring view. Very annoying.<br /><br />Minor note: Under product description, manufacturer says, “TIPS! To avoid damage . . . use clean water and 'included cloth' in case.” No included cleaning cloth came with these glasses."
2.0,"This bra is pretty, especially since it’s for big breasts; however, the material is not soft at all,  it is scratchy and I could never wear it for more than a few minutes.  If that is your goal, a pretty bra to get to sexy time, then this is the one for you, but if it’s for actual wearing all day, I personally couldn’t do it."
2.0,They fit small and your feet slide around because they are so smooth and flat. They are well made but I wish I hadn't bought them.
2.0,Ok small purse for somewhere you don’t want to take a decent purse but cheap fake leather—looks cheaply made.
2.0,Needs a strap....
2.0,"Glasses look great, but we did not receive the peace necklace."
2.0,"This seemed to be a nice, silky soft,  light weight top, but the sleeves were snug at the upper arm and about 4 inches too long...as if for a man.<br />I was disappointed ."
2.0,The strap broke off after my daughter wore it for maybe 10x. Had to order her a different pair.
2.0,"These are very cheaply made,I know the price was too good for some reason.I sent them back."
2.0,To Whom it may concern  Overpriced
2.0,The case is small and would not fit much of all of your required toiletries. The leather seems a little delicate. I am sadly disappointed. I will not return it as it is too much of a hassle. Never again.
2.0,"The Celtic knots are not obvious on the earring. The picture makes it look very clear, but the actual design in the material is poor quality. I had to tell people what the design was. Sadly, these were a gift."
2.0,Not good quality. Scuffed on first try just walking in my house. Really cute though. Wish it worked out
2.0,"Stiff with NO STRETCH!!!!  I read the reviews before my purchase and some people did say that it did not stretch very much.  But come on.  Even cotton has a nice feel to it and a little give. This shirt fit great.  I wear a medium and it fit like a medium. But, it was so constricting because of the stiffness, I thought it would chafe.  I know not even a wash with tons of fabric softener would help soften this tee.  So I'm returning this and looking for a ring spun or cotton poly blend.  Blessings"
2.0,Poor sewing skills. Not even on placement so mask is also slightly higher on one side of the face. Other sites have better quality for the same price.
2.0,"I wanted to love it. I loved everything about it except, for some reason it twists multiple times around it self while I was just walking around. So the two chain look looked like a tangled mess...and I would untangle it 10 times in one shift. Not cool, too much work to be worth it:("
2.0,"Cute bangles but does not serve its purpose, hair ties do not stay in place"
2.0,"I lived this super cute necklace, however after just  a few weeks of wearing it really showed wear and broke. I repaired it the first time it broke, however it broke again  and was not fixable anymore."
2.0,"Very very cheaply made stiff weird material, I wouldn't waste my time"
2.0,"Is advertised as having a countdown feature, which it does not have. Had to return it as I need it to ref soccer games. It was nice looking and seemed to be good quality for the price, though"
2.0,Awful... so small maybe product should be advertised for infants .. infected my ears never has that happened.. So upset .. .. just a waste of money
2.0,"Material is constricting, boob parts are TINY and this is about 5 sizes to small."
2.0,Ordered for my little girl for my wedding (flower girl) looks very cheap :( the tutu separates and bunches up and  you can easily see the slip underneath
2.0,very cheap but look even cheaper...
2.0,Brim was riduclously long it looked absurd.
2.0,Really short and horrible material
2.0,"Not crazy about the quality, returning because these ran smaller than expected and were wildly see through."
2.0,"Looks different than picture, off material"
2.0,It runs very small!
2.0,"These pants were an odd length, and maybe just ran small.  Not long pants, but not a good short length either. They looked weird."
2.0,Too lose
2.0,Material is polyester and does not breath at all!
2.0,Not 'tiny'. The pair I received did not have any marbling. I will be returning.
2.0,"Maybe I was sent the wrong product, but the skirt was cheaply made, the waistband was very thin, and somehow it was both tight and boxy at the same time. It was very unflattering and I sadly have to return it."
2.0,"Tried the shirt on when I got it....the description said to order a size smaller if you want a tighter fit. I ordered a size smaller which is medium, it is still very loose and not a compression tank at all..very disappointed and feel I wasted my money."
2.0,This is not worth any amount of money because the black fades off fast.
2.0,Too tight. VERY difficult to put on.
2.0,Bigger than I thought sticks off my nose :/
2.0,"Delivery was great!! The product itself though (*from the seller) is very tight and very small. I hate returning things so I’ll give it to my mom to wear as a nightgown. It’s cool looking, but again….. it runs wayyyy too small!!"
2.0,Way too small and no stretch!
2.0,Very see through and not the pink as it appears in the photo. It's a much lighter pale pink
2.0,"I was so happy to finally get these nice hefty scrunchy cozy jackets on flash sale. So disappointed bc although I bought a bunch of these during the flash sale, all are unexpectedly just way too small for the look of a roomy, oversized width that’s not overly long in torso length or in sleeve length that others here have clearly shown :( which means (sigh) that I’ll have to return all except two SMALL or MEDIUM which will (unexpectedly) go to two other friends (not the friends originally intended :/) who are way smaller than a 36” chest and a couple inches shorter than me.<br /><br />SIZING:<br /><br />According to the size chart, the SMALL very clearly states it has a 41” chest. I thought, oh, this is good bc it will fit me fine with room to spare. However, I’m 5’3” 32DD = 36” chest and the size SMALL only just fit at the chest rather than being a nice roomy piece. For the SMALL, the difference between it and me is 41”-36” = 5”. Whoa, that’s a big diff. The MEDIUM was a little looser on the chest, but mostly just longer which also felt slightly better in the sleeve length. For both sizes, the sleeves felt just a little short even for my 5’3” frame.<br /><br />I’d like to note that amazon also recommended I buy either a small or medium. Unfortunatlely this is also not correct.<br /><br />In summary, SMALL and MEDIUM were too closely fitted, and these sizing issues just mean that this item runs extremely small. If you are aiming for the look that others here have posted as generously roomy (love!), then you will have to go up not just one but a few sizes. I should also mention that I got several different colors in both small and medium and they all fit pretty much the same respective to the two sizes so these are definitely cut small rather than just being a one-time or one color fluke.<br /><br />That‘s about it for sizing. Now for the other characteristics:<br /><br />COLOR: As for color, the colors are as shown in the product listing and photos others have posted:<br />- brown is really dark<br />- olive green is really deep dark green dark lol<br />- muted is the heather pink<br />- reddish burgundy red is the perfect dark red<br /> - honey: I’ve not received this yet<br /><br />STRETCH: As for no stretch, this is true.<br /><br />THICKNESS: As for cozy thickness, this is true. Not too bulky and has a nice hand.<br /><br />LINING: This item is also lined with a matching, cotton-like fabric.<br /><br />Guess I should probably try an XL or XXL next time?<br /><br />LENGTH: As for length, if you are taller than me, SMALL and MEDIUM will be a lot shorter than others have posted. Both definitely did not hit mid hip (which looks nice on others) but instead are below belly button (way short) which is above hip.<br /><br />Well, hopefully these will flash sale again! That was a very cool moment!"
2.0,I was really unimpressed as it look cheap and really ugly compared with the picture.  I kept it but would not wear this topmin public.
2.0,"Fabric too thin, no side pockets..."
2.0,"frankly, these pants puzzle me.  There is velcro everywhere.  I understand that velcro is there so one can adjust the length of the pants, but the external Velcro should have been covered by straps.  One walk in the woods and I brought home all manner of seeds from brushing up against things.  The fabric had no flaws, no imperfections in the seams.  It was heavier than I expected. The seams were all stitched well, no bad stitches or mis-stitched seams.  The waist was right, but the legs were way long.  For the price these seem to be OK, but I wasn't overwhelmed."
2.0,"The top itself feels amazing. It’s soft, and the inside feels even nicer. However, it’s nothing like the photo lol. The sleeves aren’t figure hugging at all. The section around my torso is also super wide and it basically looks like a shrunken normal long sleeve shirt. Pretty irritated but whatever, I can pair it w/ high waisted jeans and sneakers instead of a skirt and heels the way I wanted to."
2.0,Cheap quality.. Plus the colours are dull as compared to the picture.
2.0,This outfit really doesn’t look anything like it does on the model. The shorts are a weird fit and not very comfortable. I just think that the whole thing is kind of baggy and strange looking
2.0,The pendant is very tiny.... n the chain is just thin..... its not a bad product just for the money... its dissapointing .... I dont think its worth it....
2.0,This dress did nothing for my figure. If it did anything it made me look bigger than what I am. It was not flattering at all. It did not even touch the floor. The only good thing about it is the fabric felt nice
2.0,These do not wash well they have strings and the fabric pulls apart
2.0,I really wanted to like these pants but every time I wear them I'm a little less in love with them.  The material is very thin and flimsy like an old rag.  Also the knees stretch out right away and they look sloppy.<br />On the plus side the are comfy and cooler for summer.
2.0,"Doesn’t look the same Doesn’t fit good, I’m disappointed. I need to return please guide me as. To do so you’ve been ignoring my review😡 I need my money back I can’t message seller or nothing how do I get a refund this jumpsuit is aweful"
2.0,"I loved the idea of this jacket, but it is just awkward. The sleeves are too short and the rest of it just hangs there. It has no shape to it at all."
2.0,"While the leggings are stretchy and a good weight, they do not stay up when working out or running. They constantly slide down, and the crotch area is made differently, making them look weird."
2.0,Not a tie-dye. It's some kind of paint with a VERY strong smell. Colors are accurate to the picture but the paint has some areas where it was applied too thick and it makes it rough & uncomfortable. The inside is white (an obvious indicator that it was painted instead of dyed) except for a few spots where the paint was applied thick enough to get to the inside.
2.0,Run small. Tend the roll down. Come up just above the knee and I'm 5'6. Nice colors though. Won't be wearing these.
2.0,"These are SO cute! Perfect for new walkers too. They are soft and flexible, love!<br /><br />Had to update my review - they broke at the toe seam! Such a bummer!!"
2.0,Very cute design and good size. I gave it two stars because after only two uses it's falling apart. :( Very disappointing
2.0,product is off white/ appears dirty.  size is smaller than expected from picture.
2.0,"I am a curvy woman and usually a Large fits me nicely and depending on how a clothing item is made, I range from a M-XL..but the XL didn't fit me very well at all!  I was able to put it on and zip it up (with help on the zipper) But the arms were incredibly uncomfortable and I was disappointed because it was a cute dress.  I wish clothing companies could make sizes better and stop catering to woman who don't have curves or hips."
2.0,I like the pattern but the quality of material and craftsmanship wasn't worth the month long wait.
2.0,"Starts for the yellow, polarized, night-driving glasses... Love these. The others are too dark for even the brightest of days... I kept them for the yellow night glasses, bought a single pair for daytime, that I love."
2.0,"The design is very appealing. My only disappointment with my purchase is that I wouldn't really consider them ""oversized."" I prefer a true ""Jackie-O,"" style, with the much larger frame."
2.0,"Fits like panty hose...not in a good way. Stitching through crotch area is uncomfortable and rubs against my skin.  I'm 5'8&#34; and 150lbs, in good shape and wear plenty of athletic gear that fits well. Unfortunately I can't recommend these."
2.0,dress is nice but runs super small. I wear medium and the large didn't fit. I has to return it and purchase an xxxL just to make sure that it fits. this sucks . I had to also lay a 1 day shipping fee just because I need it by the 30th
2.0,I need to exchange it for a heavier rope chain to hold the pendant I wanted to put on it.
2.0,Fits well.. Fabric is terrible. If you want people to know you are coming theres are the pants for you...
2.0,"I have had better adhesive bras. These have sharp edges that dig into the armpits, and the adhesive doesn't last. They were falling off after my first 2 hours, and any sweat made them fall off completely. I hoped that it was the tension(which would suck as it was the point of the bra, to become a push up bra by tightening) but when I released the string, the same issue was still going on. I will stick to the other brand I ordered from."
2.0,"The color is nice and it looks like it does in the picture, but it's really tight in a weird, non-stretchy way."
2.0,Sizes run very small. I ended up donating it because the cut was not well suited for busty women
2.0,They don't really work for my feet.They're always slipping off my heel in my shoes and its kind of annoying.
2.0,Thought it would be longer. It's to short for me and I am 5'9. Material is great but to short. I wasnt able to wear to meeting.
2.0,This is not what was described. The item described was shorter and had a drawstring to adjust it to your face which was the main reason i spent as much on this as i did. I checked the reviews first and my item does not match what other people had. I would be willing to adjust my review if i received the proper item that i ordered.<br /><br />Update not even one month later. I tried getting the correct item from the seller and they just stopped replying to me so i kept the wrong item that i did receive. After washing it maybe 3 times now the threads are unraveling and it is so tight around my throat that i can't even wear it.
2.0,"The bag was bigger than I was expecting as the description says it's a medium bag, but I was happy with the looks of the purse. The zipper on the other hand is very cheap and comes apart almost every time I try to close the purse! I have seen others state that the company is good about replacing the purse, but I would NOT want another purse with the same issue. I would not recommend this purse, sorry!"
2.0,Ordered three pair and all three frames were bent and had to be straightened
2.0,I am 5-5 ft. Legs are made for people over six ft.  Also did not like the net under liner.
2.0,It looked very nice on the wrist. No problems with fit. All was good except it only lasted a few months when it broke at the end where it attached to the watch. Unfortunate and will not provide this brand again.
2.0,Left shoe does not light up.
2.0,"It is fine as a v neck t-shirt, but does not have the same loose drape as in the photo. I am keeping it, because it is okay, but it isn’t what I wanted."
2.0,"The button on the jeans is weird, the ripping is weird looking, the fit of the crotch is weird. Very sad."
2.0,Cotton Flannel is scratchy; doesn't feel like quality flannel was used.  Was not impressed at all.
2.0,VERY distorted plastic. I was seasick in 20 seconds!
2.0,"Was beautiful.  Nice size, how ever the bar portion barely  extended past the skin in my nose. The ball at the end was not big enough to keep the jewelry from coming out. Mine just washed down the dang sink. :("
2.0,The material was ok.
2.0,the design is pretty but the sleeve is big and the stomach area is tight
2.0,Didn't fit my Oakleys Radarlock by a tiny margin at the nose bridge.  I have two Radarlocks and neither of them fitted.  I had to file the border a little bit with a sandpaper at the nose bridge.  Now it fits.  Lens quality is excellent though.
2.0,"I bought this since I wanted an extra neoprene visor (all neoprene) & this got good reviews on Amazon.  I find it ironic that it's listed as &#34;no headaches visor&#34; since it was actually giving me a slight headache when I wore it!  It's not worth returning but I wouldn't buy it again. Amazon doesn't carry the neoprene visors I like (all neoprene, including the strap).  This strap is the problem--it's not comfortable."
2.0,"I expected higher quality at this price point.  it's a beautiful strap, but the exterior leather paint is fragile at best.  it will look aweful in 4 or 5 months of wear.  I'll try to update this if I'm wrong."
2.0,First thing i noticed is that the fit is to small in the waist and i bought a size or two larger. Second is they dont get very warm even on the hottest setting. They dont come with the battery and the areas with the heating wire are not enough.
2.0,"Fits okay. Has an odor that won't go away. Tried airing it out and spraying with odor remover sprays, but nothing worked."
2.0,The bracelet is beautiful but it's not 8 inches long. I received one that said 8 but no measured 7.25 inches. I returned it for a replacement and got the same thing. It's tight like a hair tie on my wrist. I'm very disappointed
2.0,"the shoe inserts came apart.  It seems as though the glue is not up to par.  I would prefer buying a more expensive, better quality product but not have it fall apart on me.  I will have to re-purchase something else next summertime for sure."
2.0,Very pretty and seems to be good quality but its WAY TOO SMALL. I couldn't get it over my boobs. Order at least 2 sizes up.
2.0,Se ven muy lindos pero El material es demasiado pesado
2.0,Returned because the material was cheap looking for $18.
2.0,"I ordered the gray dress in an XL. It got here fast. That being said, this was a dark blue dress with different flowers on it and the neckline was not a wraparound looking collar. I was so excited to get this dress so I could wear it to a wedding this weekend. It is a pretty dress anyway and now I don't have time to get another one so I guess I will be wearing it. I am 5'6 and 170lbs and ordered an XLand it does fit perfectly, disappointed it is not what I ordered! :("
2.0,Ordered to big & it does not fit right on me. The front hangs weird instead of a nice flat surface infront of the dress around stomach area. It was all ruffled & hanged I guess cuz it was to big on me. Also heads up pple if washed it will shrink majorly on length & not size. So instead of a dress close to the knees it came up more close to a really short mini skirt smh
2.0,The hardware on the handles ripped right through the top of the purse on the first day of the use. Same thing happened to the other handle shortly thereafter.
2.0,"I ordered these pajamas in size: small, color: black. Item arrived quickly. These have more of a fitted look and fit me well. For reference I’m 5’4; 104LB; 32/26/34 and Usually wear size XS /0-2.  So I would say these might run on the small side and it might be necessary to size up. Additionally, Item description stated these were Cotton. They are not. So if you’re looking for cotton, look elsewhere. It’s rayon with stretch.  I’m contemplating returning due to fabric as I needed cotton. Otherwise, these are cute."
2.0,"Absolutely run way to small . I think they were made for kids not adults , I ordered a large and extra large and both did not fit at all . Super cute and I’m bummed they didn’t fit ."
2.0,"I really wanted to get something somewhat attractive to wear to bed and had hoped this would be it, but it's not.  The picture is very misleading-lace is sewn all around the bottom and top of the bra and does not cover the middle as it appears to in the picture.<br /><br />The bra fits fine and I am going to keep it.  Padding become dislodged in the wash and I am probably going to permanently keep it out.<br /><br />All in all I am not returning but I would not reorder and I would not recommend this to a friend."
2.0,The color was what i wanted. I ordered  a larger size and the sleeves were too tight. Didn’t fit well at all
2.0,"I liked these for a week or so before I easily lost one during a dr's visit, so you need to be extra careful when wearing them"
2.0,Much smaller than they look in the pics :(
2.0,"Another lesson in ""you get what you pay for"".  I didn't expect much from these, and got even less.  They're comfortable enough, but less than two months after I bought them the soles are pulling away from the tops.  I give them another week before they're unusable."
2.0,Only got two.
2.0,They were great until I had an allergic reaction to the gauges/tapers which sucked. Great for upsizing- easier and great for not getting blow outs. I recommend but but at your own risk.
2.0,"Nice fabric, cute cut except that the front is wacky - looks like it's just one layer on the picture but it's actually two making it look like you are wearing an apron. Returned it, do not enjoy the apron look. Sad because the rest of the dress is super flattering."
2.0,"The black clutch I received had a black zipper, not yellow/gold as the one pictured. The overall effect was ugly and disapptointing, as I found the clutch to be the perfect size for my wallet, phone, keys, and one or two more things. I returned the item."
2.0,The bands appear to be good quality and beautiful. But the pins sent were too long to fit the Galaxy watch 3 41mm and unfortunately I had to return it. If you could somehow confirm the correct pins it seems like they would be a good purchase. Seller please create option if possible to select a specific watch to ensure the correct pins are sent. I was really disappointed these did not fit.
2.0,"They pinch my legs and make an unflattering buldge no matter how high or low I put them. I don't have particularly thick legs but it seems all socks do this to me, even plus size ones."
2.0,Expensive & Doesn’t hold shape after machine wash
2.0,This was very small
2.0,"I ordered 2 colors. This skirt is pretty. The elastic waist it cheap and looks like it was sown by a child on a toy machine, and it runs around 6 sizes smaller. I thought they had sent me the wrong size, so I checked the label. No, the tag showed the size I ordered. I wouldn't order again."
2.0,We received the dress today. My daughter hasn’t had a chance to try it on. But I did want to document just in case I need to return the dress or get a discount. The dresses inner lining came ripped.
2.0,4x fits like 2x
2.0,"I orded a large at first, that is my normal size, it was too small in the thighs and hips, so I returned to get an xlarge. It is too small also in the sam areas, it is almost as if it is the same exact cut of the large. I still have it, it's sexy, that's why I gave the two stars, but I need to return it, I just haven't yet."
2.0,"I’m 137lbs, 36c, S/M in women’s tops because I have a broader upper body. I went with a Med, I probably should’ve gone with a S but this sweater has a weird cut. As soon as I put it on I noticed the material is bulky in the shoulders and upper arms and slimmer down the waist and at the hem. So if u have a wider upper body like I do it just enhances and makes your shoulders huge. Not a flattering fit on me at all. The length of the sleeves are also on the shorter side and I have short arms. I had to keep scrunching the sleeves up because they just felt off to me.<br />This is a sweater I should’ve passed on because of my body type but the bold and vibrant color and pattern drew me in. It’s even nicer in person and the material is soft and warm but it is a bit heavy and it prickled the skin on my back a little. I wore this to a birthday dinner and I felt uncomfortable in it the whole time.<br />If I had tried this on in a store I would’ve never gotten it."
2.0,"The jacket is great, but it looks like it had been used.  I reached out to the seller and they have not responded.  Would not recommend purchasing from them."
2.0,Way too small.  Asian size.
2.0,"The little “hammer” shaped part digs in under the sneaker tongue and is very uncomfortable. They’re super cute, love the colors but unfortunately they are bulky, irritating and I took them out. :/"
2.0,It look nice but broke adter a few days
2.0,The length was too short and the material snagged on everything.
2.0,"Too small had to return, it didn't seem like 6mm."
2.0,"I am 5'5 and ordered a large because I like my pants on the loose side...they are snug and fit me in height....which is running way small - not sure how a 6ft guy will wear pants fit perfectly for a 5'5.  the fleece is nice on the inside, but the outside is some weird material that sounds like a wind breaker when. you walk...weird.  unless I got a bad batch, these definitely undershot expectations."
2.0,The buttons wouldn't stay buttoned.
2.0,"Dont buy,doesnt fit ."
2.0,"Cheap material. Super thin anf transparent.  Cute design, but would not recommend due to it’s quality."
2.0,Not sure why but the sleeves were all stretched out and is not like the one shown in the picture. Not the best but not the worse?  Hit or miss kind if outfit.
2.0,"Cant reach anyone to order or purchase additional watch band links this is not satisfactory<br />As a result I wouldn't recommend this watch if you have large hands 2 more links are required for comfortable fit, as it is watch must be worn with band not clasp. NOT GOOD ENOUGH"
2.0,I want to like this dress but it's just a big piece of see-through material that you have to create into a wearable item...I got a nude dress slip....a must...then the belt really doesn't blouse it right..it just ties this big bag on you...so you blouse it...it looks nice for a minute...then it starts to fall out of the not attached belt and you look disheveled. I love the color. I'm thinking of taking it to a seamstress to try to figure out how to put a waist in it maybe. Too much work..
2.0,Kind of cheap material and too small
2.0,Material did not hold up after one wash.
2.0,Did not fit well. I got new one
2.0,"I would ordinarily support items of this nature, however your Ingwaz Rune is totally wrong... for no apparent reason. This causes me to question whether it is wrong on all your other items as well since I can't see it."
2.0,The quality is there for the price. I ordered a large pant and large top but received a small top which doesn’t fit. No choice but to return the outfit. Just an unnecessary hassle!
2.0,This dress is extremely sexy and I love it but it is not made for anyone who is a true size (L) in USA sizing or larger.  I wear a size L or XL depending on the cut of a dress and this dress is just off.<br />You would need to order 2 sizes up to get your correct fit if you are top heavy (I wear a size 44DD in bra) but I only weigh 175 lbs.
2.0,After 1 day of wearing it I took it off my watch because it had rubbed a blister on my wrist. Do not recommend!
2.0,"Waist too short in the pants, and pants too long. Don't fit well over a diaper. The top is fine."
2.0,"Sad, I really liked this dress, but it is way too tight for me. Was going to see if one of my nieces could wear it. But forgot in the grief of losing my father. I got the biggest size there was, so too bad so sad."
2.0,Got these glasses for my 6 year old son. Within 3 months both nose pieces fell off and the ear pieces.
2.0,"Cute shirt, except it was super short, almost like a crop top.. I'm not exactly flat chested, but I have a shorter torso. I don't think that's  enough to account  for such a short shirt. I don't have problems with other shirts...<br />Returned."
2.0,"This hat fits like it's made for toddlers. My kids are 10 and 12, and both hats are way way too small."
2.0,Rather heavy and very OTT.  Would look good on stage if you are playing a monarch - but that's about it!
2.0,The netting on these trucker hats is already frayed (had it for 3 weeks) and has the plastic liner sticking out of it which pokes the inside of my head. In general the quality/price trade-off here was not worth it. Pretty disappointing.
2.0,They don't fit snug enough to stay on my feet; they slide off the heel.
2.0,"While the leggings fit well and the material feels nice, the first time I wore these the seams busted on both inner thighs. I’m 5’4 and 135lbs. I was disappointed that they ripped right when I was doing squats. Which contradicts the title that these are squat proof. Would recommend for light cardio."
2.0,"I loved these overalls, but unfortunately, after wearing them for a few short hours, one of the buckles broke."
2.0,"The costume is very cheaply made. Upon first putting it on, the seam below the zipper pulled completely apart. After a couple of hours a seam ripped on one of the fingers. May be a $20 costume but not worth $90!!"
2.0,"Very disappointed with the quality of this product not to mention that I ordered a larger size than I normally wear and could not get the pants past my knees!  Would not recommend, pass this one by..."
2.0,Too short in the legs.... :(
2.0,"The actual shorts are nice, my husband likes them. My issue is there was no hole for the button. Like.. seriously? I ended up cutting my finger trying to put a hole so he could close them up. These aren't expensive I know, buy for the price you'd think at least a button hole would be included. Other then my cut up finger I suppose I'm satisfied. But, fix that. Like yesterday."
2.0,"Much shorter than I expected but mostly disappointed in quality. Super thin material, see- thru everywhere."
2.0,"I will give the seller credit, it was fit true to the measurements stated. However it was not sewn or fit like the pictures. The seams look cheaply sewn and the breasts do not fit as shown. I think if the material had even a little stretch to it, it may lay better, but the way it’s cut, is exactly the way it’s fit. So I had some places that just bunched or looked puffy, like I had extra material, although it actually did fit. It did not lay properly once you moved."
2.0,"I am 5'5 125 small was too big, didn't look cute"
2.0,"Bought this in XL and XXL in Black.  Each cost $34.99 and I received Free Shipping and Free Returns with Amazon Prime. I liked the way it shaped me from behind and at my sides.  I also liked the color.  I wish the front had more material towards the bottom to match the amount of material towards the top.  Made it seem a tiny bit like a cape. Also I didn't like the way the sleeves looked on me but WORST OF ALL, the fabric felt rough (in both sizes).  Not comfortable at all.  For the price, relative to the other light jackets I purchased this month in plus size on Amazon Prime, I expected something nicer.  I returned them both."
2.0,I am only 5 ft tall and just barely 100lbs and the size 25 couldn't even be pulled up past my upper thighs :(<br />I normally wear a size 24/0 so I thought the 25 would be enough given that these were suggested to order up. Too bad they were waaaaay too small. I was tempted to reorder in another size (may 26 or27) but am worried to do so. The cute and wash is really cute though.
2.0,Have purchased this item 3 times.  Absolutely loved the first two.  Material was very soft and design was adorable with glitter accents.  When I received the 3rd top was extremely disappointed.  Material wasn't as soft and design was an iron on decal.  Cheap looking.  Wanted to order more to give as additional gifts but now am afraid to for fear of what I'll get.
2.0,"only 3 of the bags hold anything at all size wise the rest, for me, are too small to do much with.  I will be dropping them in the good will."
2.0,"Fit was right, but it's so poorly made!!! I took it out to try it on and the strap broke...very disappointing."
2.0,This is a cheap little bag that doesn't fit much
2.0,It doesn't look like it does in the picture. It looks rough and it's not smooth and shiny like it is in the picture.
2.0,Ordered a large. Material was extremely cheap and flimsy. Ended up returning :(
2.0,They pull the hairs on your arm bad.
2.0,"I have just bought this from an authorized dealer.  At a distance, it looks good. Up close,  it is rough. The surface finish is sloppy, uneven and unsymmetrical, and the bezel coin edge is down right unfinished.  The dial is the typical Seiko special: misalignment. The lug holes must be drilled by monkeys -  the positions of all four are different and crooked. The movement is the worst: -12s/day - daily adjustment. If I didn’t know better,  I might conclude that it is a Chinese counterfeit.  But it came from an authorized dealer and I doubt the Chinese counterfeiters are this bad. The only decent thing on it is the metal strap. An expensive  piece of trash."
2.0,"I was very excited when I received them. Very pretty colors, vibrant. Some popped/burst however within a month. Maybe the material used as the elastic need to be stronger."
2.0,Cute but came very wrinkled and I was frustrating
2.0,"Fit as expected but tooo thin.  Not a towel, but yes a cover up."
2.0,These very quickly turned a greenish color.
2.0,The band does not hold the Fit2 very well. All it takes for it to come flying out is a slight rub on one of the silicon edges and it pops out. Our Fit2 screen is now broken.
2.0,Disappointing. Shrinks after laundering and didn’t  stay new looking for very long at all.<br />Seems like cheap material and cheaply made in my opinion. I don’t recommend it at any price.
2.0,"Must turn the volume up to high in order to listen songs clearly, but a person standing a few feet way can hear you playing music."
2.0,There was dirt on one of the hat. That weren't in bags.
2.0,Pedí un size y es demasiado grande
2.0,It was a bit too large. I should have ordered a size smaller.  Love the color though.
2.0,"Very cute hat, but way too big.  Being a &#34; girl's&#34; hat, I expected a smaller size, but this hat is even too big for my 6'2&#34; husband."
2.0,"Very pretty robe, love the detail of lace. Unfortunately it’s way smaller than the size says. Debating whether it’s worth it to send it back."
2.0,"For really big glasses, these fit fairly tight to the face."
2.0,"I just tried 2 out of 24 for battery check. Both of them didn't work. (I did not forget to take insulating tape off. ) The fiber optic need to be assembled, which I couldn't do because of the poor construction. Plus, only those 2 I tried  made enough mess with unglued glitters. I wanted to use them as party favor, but I don't want to give my guest something doesn't work or assembled.  The price was very reasonable, but it was unfortunately waste of money. I had to return them."
2.0,was tarnished
2.0,Not real 925 silver
2.0,This items runs way too big. I ordered my normal size and its swimming on me.
2.0,Looks nice but we returned it after 3 weeks when it stopped working. Took it to a jeweler and it wasn't the battery.
2.0,The grips on these socks did not perform for my reformer Pilates class. I usually buy toesox branded socks and thought I would give these a try. The dots are a clear plastic on the sole of the sock. They did not hold traction on the machine and I almost fell... and this was before washing them. I sadly cannot return them as I have worn them already.
2.0,hard to get one out of the many cards out.  Not a great product as you have to get them all out then find the one you want out of that.  I kept it but put it away as an emergency spare only.
2.0,Marginal quality
2.0,"itchy and stiff, but cute"
2.0,Love them . Fit as expected. BUT came in dirty with wax marks all over. I had to scrub them for more than 10min to get them semi clean.
2.0,The tshirt is very thick and feels like a performance material. Cute design and fit is as expected.
2.0,"My husband and I swim and he does water walking. They started to fall apart at the sole seam, today. It's been exactly 6 months ago that I bought them. We only swim on an average 8-10 times a month, right now, in the winter. I don't know if they are returnable yet...are they?? Will not purchase again."
2.0,The picture and description made it sound like it would be shiny and glittery but it's just fabric. Boring!! After waiting almost 2 months it is not worth it. I would not purchase this again.
2.0,"Ignorant of and ignoring the term &#34;Dad Hat&#34;, I found out the hard way that these are more Elmer Fudd than one might wish.  Rising high off the head, they might work well for someone with a head of hair I could only dream of, but they'd still look nerdy  Otherwise, they seem as well made as most and are a good value."
2.0,This bracelet is very nice but is way too small. It fits very tightly around my wrist.
2.0,Earrings are beautiful and very sparkly but I’m not sure if they are Moissanite or CZ. The description uses both words and I did not receive a warranty or certificate like I did with other Moissanite purchases. Also the backing does not fit tightly and I would be afraid that it might come off easily. I am returning as a result.
2.0,I like the color and design; however see-through.
2.0,The material was very thin.  I ordered white and I could see every thing that was going on underneath the dress…returned<br /><br />Also the ruching didn’t fit as pictured.
2.0,"We got a lot of compliments for the lights and my son enjoyed it for one and a half day. Then one shoe stop charging, and next day another stop as well."
2.0,"These are not lasting. Got these for our 5 year old who wears a 9 in all her other shoes and had to send them back and re order a 10.<br />She has maybe worn them 5 times, while playing around water. Sprinklers and water balloons, the designs have started to fade and crack you can barely seem them anymore. Might be defective?  Definitely not what they advertised, wrote to customer service but never heard back."
2.0,"Shown with stripes, but received a plain bag.  Yes, it's a nice bag, and the pink salt is pretty, but I wanted the stripes as shown."
2.0,"They sent me the wrong style. I ordered “blue flowers” and received “navy blue” looks like it would be super pretty, it’s just not the one I wanted."
2.0,Started to come apart after one wash
2.0,Socks were smaller than expected.  No return offered.
2.0,Purchased this 5-pack a couple months ago and the elastic band is already becoming unstitched from the fabric. I'll stick to Hanes or FOTL as these brands can last years!
2.0,"One zipper broke in less than 24 hours and bag had hardly anything in it.  Most zippers work poorly and never fully shut or open and the liner fabric often gets caught in them.  Fabric looks and feels more like coated fabric than a faux leather.  Good size, color and amount of pockets but I feel I should have opted for something more expensive as this bag doesn't seem like it will last much longer for daily use."
2.0,Cute pattern but super cheap not really stretchy fabric.  The fabric (not the pattern) looks like it’s from the 70’s & is really not attractive.
2.0,Very short overall and legs were extremely tight.
2.0,Poor quality on make of product stitching and making of pants do not flow or lay right. Crooked!
2.0,Made for girl
2.0,Appropriate for the price. Not a long term item
2.0,"Nice necklace but a little difficult to clasp.  Would buy again though!<br /><br />New update as of 12/21/15, this item already broke in 4 1/2 months.  The clasp pulled away already."
2.0,Too small for some glasses
2.0,Be sure to order a size up
2.0,"Both posts came bent, one detached from the ball when unscrewing the back first time. I glued it back on and they now look fine but if I knew how poor quality these things were I would not have wasted my money."
2.0,"I was excited, the fit was perfect. Then for the washing instructions, hand wash, line dry! Who makes pants out of this material when there are so many others to choose from. My fault I didn't look at that before I purchased them. I hand washed, laid flat and they came out terrible. I had to iron. What a disappointment, to labor intensive for a $23.00 pair of pants. Please keep sizing and change the fabric to a more wash and wear fabric!"
2.0,"The shirt itself is pretty, but the material is just awful."
2.0,"Design & color saturation are good, inner mask material has foam feel.<br />This mask DOES NOT have a filter pocket."
2.0,I bought this to wear to a wedding but it was immediately vetoed as it looked like I was completely naked under the lace. It was not appropriate for any public gathering.
2.0,they are small around the heel part
2.0,Broke easily won't buy again
2.0,They're low quality obviously. Won't be buying these again. Came in just the bag and plastic pouch.
2.0,Both of the front pockets rip a part.  Cheap material and clothe.
2.0,"ordered a spiderman for my 10yo boy and it fit perfect. also ordered a jojo siwa for my 9yo girl and it was at least 2"" smaller in neck diameter than the spiderman version of the same neck gaiter from the same amazon listing manufactured and sold by the same company/third party seller. the girl version was way too small; she couldn't even get it over her noggin. not sure about the qa, but the material and themed print was nice. had to return the smaller one and roll the dice that a different one would be the same size as the spiderman version."
2.0,"Nothing like I expected. It's velour but at least thicker than I anticipated. I added a pic. For reference I'm 5'5"" 190lbs wear a 12/14 and the XL was waaay too big. I might need a medium to fit like the pic."
2.0,I like to idea of the adjustability of the chain but it is too thin for the pendant I needed for. had to return it
2.0,Buyer beware these are cut SMALL. I don't think even the XXL is going to fit and he usually takes XL.
2.0,"Received today and was very disappointed!!  The pockets are not located in the normal position for pockets!!  If I put my hands in them, my elbows were pointed out. It's just not at all what I expected!.  I will be returning this item!!"
2.0,"I love the satin, but the elastic did not last for even a few weeks.  I will not purchase again."
2.0,This purse is very pretty but it already has a rip in the back due to poor quality. I've barely used it so I'm very disappointed.
2.0,"The US22 is not a 22. It's probably more of an 18/tight 20. It also smelled SOOO strongly of chemicals that I was concerned about what the material was treated with, and decided to return it."
2.0,"These showed in every pair of shoes that I tried them with.  Some might like that as they are pretty and lacy, but it was not a look for me."
2.0,"My grandson loved his new shoes. But, the very first day of wear the black around the toe area came off. and white shows through.  For the price of the shoe you would think they would be made black instead of black over white. After all these are made for little  boys."
2.0,"It’s a raw, thin cut of fabric, no hems. You literally can make it yourself at home."
2.0,not as long as shown in the picture.  Really thin material.  Cheaply made.
2.0,"I purchased the turquoise colored jewelry piece, when it arrived it looked more royal blue. I had to take a flashlight & hold the piercing up to it to somewhat tell it was actually turquoise. Very deceiving. The size of the jewelry is smaller than portrayed on images. The butterflies are way too small & it arches to the point where the piercing awkwardly sticks out. Highly dissatisfied. Only reason for the 2nd star is because I received a “free gift” with my purchase which was just a basic blue round jewelry piece that I like more than what I actually bought."
2.0,Extremely cheap looking. The Pearl's are way too large and have a plastic seam down the middle of each one. I returned it
2.0,"The overall visual appearance is pleasing, my 7 year old loved the color and design.<br /><br />After that the problems began.<br /><br />1. The zipper malfunctioned and needed to be repaired.<br />2. One of the straps attaching the bag to the trolley platform tore off.<br />3. The inner fabric liner that separates the outer pocket from the main compartment shredded.<br /><br />9 months later the bag is useless..."
2.0,Shipping packaging was not great so one of the posts was broken by the time it arrived. I tried on the other one and these are way heavier than they look. The backs didn't fit the post correctly so it wouldn't stay in my ear.  Too bad - these are just so freaking cute to be this disappointing.
2.0,Not a real tourbillon movement. It is just an automatic watch. You can get similar versions made in the same place for less. For what these cost you could an Invicta automatic watch rated at 200 meters and almost indestructible. If you really want a tourbillon expect to pay close to 400 dollars and above
2.0,"Bought as a gift.  It was beautiful and she loved it.  Then, two stones (one on either end) fell out.  I got this back in February and it’s broken in June.  Disappointed in $50 gift that didn’t make it 4 months.  Of course, it’s past the one month “return” period."
2.0,Not for larger chested women! Strange fitting arms as well. Loose elsewhere. Returned
2.0,Ring is even bigger than described in other reviews. I have a fairly large nose and wear large septum rings often. This ring was humongous. I bought this to wear for my wedding and we all laughed. Decided to keep it as a joke. It's pretty... But I can nearly fit it around my pinky finger.
2.0,"Short but still kind of pretty. Definitely has an odd smell when came out of the package, but my main concern was that it's a lot smaller than expected. The scarf can be washed."
2.0,I expected it to be more cushion-y or flexible. It wasn’t comfortable on my foot.
2.0,"I was looking for high lift never noticed it said medium, why medium meant to bag grass. When I put them on they hit each other, i had to grind middle blade forcing me to remove deck again."
2.0,Too big for my face! Sorry!
2.0,Cute on the butt however it seems this bathing suite is for a shorter person. I’m 5’7 and didn’t seem to fit well on top. It exposed too much but only bc it was not made for someone with a long torso. My husband loved it on me 😂 but it was basically topless! Not really what I was going for!
2.0,Glad I read the reviews and ordered 2 sizes larger.
2.0,"Good-looking, but it's essentially a plated piece of plastic. It has no weight and barely weighs down the cord when around the neck. It's about the quality of a cereal box prize."
2.0,"Looked good and worked well for about 3 days, then the functions quit working. All three watches were nonfunctional after 2 weeks"
2.0,"Ordered a light green and light blue, both size S. For reference, I am 5’10, 185lbs,  and both fit well. The light blue pair we’re cut about an inch shorter than the light green. This didn’t  make much of a difference to me, but for someone else, it may. After the first wash the material held up fine, but the drawstrings frayed and will need to be replaced. For the price, the quality of the should be much better."
2.0,Made for a small ear. Does not stay on. Disappointing.
2.0,"Bought these for an upcoming trip to Costa Rica and wanted to have less to bring back in suitcase. These came from overseas so their sizing must be very different than ours...I usually wear size 7, so ordered thes in large and they are very snug.  Nice enough quality."
2.0,Look like nice earrings but the posts are extremely short and the backs are tiny. They should be advertised as children's earrings. These are being sent back. Disappointed that I paid for orinally shipping and they now want me to pay to ship them back. Ripoff.
2.0,"Quality is great, however, watch out for the sizing! It was super small! What is an &#34;Asia&#34; size anyway?! I've never seen that before!!! I ordered this for my husband and ended up giving it to my size small daughter. Disappointed :( Maybe just list normal sizes?"
2.0,Was very heavy and uncomfortable had to return it. No free returns so I had to pay a hefty price for return label
2.0,"I ordered based on measurements and when I received the item, it was way too large. Too long, too loose everywhere and it was very long. It didn’t actually resemble the picture."
2.0,"This ring actually irritated me really bad. i could only wear it for an hour without having to change it, and it constantly bled, which never happened to me before. This definitely isnt 316L stainless steel. All of my other rings are but don't nearly hurt this bad. Other than that it looks great and fits well."
2.0,Nice piece. Just arrived broken
2.0,Cute shirt BUT it runs way smaller than your true size! Felt like a girl’s shirt or junior NOT regular woman’s sizing!
2.0,"Postage was great, I wore these to work one day and I already have snags on it :("
2.0,If I wasn’t lazy I would have returned these. I expected that they would fit loosely but not almost falling off. I’m usually a 2/3 (ordered a size 3) but the fit was about a size 6. The crotch part was also a huge no for me because of how non-fitted it was and how it made me look like I had a wiener. M’serious. Thank god they weren’t that expensive so I could just eat the money that I spent on them.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:f88f1208906fe88b2353061e26b5dd05]] Update review:  write it for work and started to become uncomfortable to wear. Middle wire is super uncomfortable. Had to keep adjusting all night.  Great look at first,  but not comfortable.<br /><br />Very stretchy but wire that goes under the breast doesn't fit properly and won't bend to my liking. Fits a little to big."
2.0,"This is an attractive suit that I found just a bit tricky to get into. I like the easy closing clasp around the neck. The straps in the back can get a bit tangled when putting this on but straighten out once pulled up to the neckline. This suit does not have any type of control built in, so one's shape shows as is--fully tummy and all. What I do not like is the bra inserts. On the one I received, the right insert kept folding over and it was difficult to straighten out. Personally, I do not like inserts of any kind in a bathing suit or bra. However, if they stayed in place that would be acceptable, but these do not. It is mainly for this reason that an otherwise attractive suit is a disappointment to me.<br /><br />The label recommends hand washing only and line drying. I always machine wash items like this in a lingerie bag and hang dry."
2.0,Not suitable for full C at all. Maybe an A or B. Not enough surface area to hold up anything larger.
2.0,"I purchased these in January, it is now Marchand the sole already is splitting from the rest of the shoe. Not good quality at all."
2.0,IBoot had a stain on it. I had to return them. Now I have to wait to purchase another pair. This is so inconvenient.
2.0,"This fascinator was cute, but did not provide the sophisticated look I sought. Worse, the headband was extremely uncomfortable and, therefore, unwearable. I will not purchase any more fascinators with headbands, but only those with clips or combs!<br /><br />Regarding the fit, there is no choice for &quot;uncomfortable,&quot; so having to choose one I chose &quot;Fit as expected.&quot; But it really didn't because it hurt."
2.0,It is basically just a prop. My mom ordered this for my nephews school dress up day and it broke before he could even use it. It’s very cheap and doesn’t do anything. It’s just a prop to hold which would be okay for an adults costume but a kid would at least like for the trigger to pull and maybe some sounds.
2.0,Cheap materIal and looks cheap.  Not impressed
2.0,It was delivered without the cuff links. Felt cheated. Have not even bothered to use it. Quality seems ok though. Did not come in any case. Tie and Square were just thrown into a package containing the shoes I also ordered.
2.0,"I did not misread the “cashmere feel” description before purchasing. I wasn’t expecting real cashmere, but I was hoping for more than a thin sock thickness and feel. Actually buying thick socks, cutting the foot end off, and cutting thumb holes would be a better idea"
2.0,The face was blue when I got the mask. Didn’t look like the picture
2.0,The material used to make the shirt is so very thin that another shirt would need to be worn under it. Cheaply made.
2.0,"Very tight around the bottom, not flowy like picture"
2.0,"The size was perfect for my needs, however, got a couple of scratches and one of the wheels came loose at the airport and couldn't screwed it back on, had to use super glue to hold it in place. Not happy."
2.0,"The fit of this dress was fine, but it was shorter than I expected. I did not measure but looking at the pictures i thought it was at least knee length. When I tried it on it was actually somewhere between mid thigh and knee length, way shorter than I needed it to be. Plus I thought I ordered white and it was actually more off white."
2.0,"I like the idea of them but really difficult to use and a couple of the screws wont move after a certain point, making them difficult to secure on."
2.0,"These were comfy and looked good on me, but avoid bending over. I always do a test bending over to make sure no one can see anything and needless to say I mooned my mom. So I just wear them around the house or with a very long shirt/dress."
2.0,Material is very thin. The strap is very cheap material too. Price reflects quality.
2.0,Much fatter then I expected.  The material is rough.  Not easy to tie closed on my small wrists and still be able to take it off at the end of the day.  (
2.0,Did not like that after about 5 weeks I went to put them on and the straps broke off
2.0,"This band has a nice feel in your hand. Unfortunately it doesn't fit my VivoMove HR at all. The enclosed pins feel right out when I installed them on the watch. Luckily I had a couple extra 20 mm pins that were compatible with the band so I am able to use it. If you don't have extra pins, don't buy this band for the vivomove hr. The band does loosen throughout the day, I do find myself tightening it. I suppose it moves vs. digging into my wrist when I flex my wrist. I haven't had the magnet come lose at all."
2.0,A small wrist man as myself finds it a tad large. In  the latter past month it started readjusting itself and I would have to pull the strings to get it back<br />I prefer the adjustment to work for a size 7 - 7 3/4  better<br />It only lasted 4 months before it broke.<br />FOR THE COST? in consequential.
2.0,Couldn't fit it
2.0,These where perfect but a part of it broke in half after about two months.
2.0,It fits but it is not a zip up. It is a regular hoodie
2.0,Thought I ordered a small… no tag so don’t know. Gaps at the bottom button. Only thing good was the color. Took a long time to get. Gave it to Goodwill.
2.0,The bands look nice but unfortunately they don’t stay in the loop that keeps the excess band from flapping around. They tend to stretch out after a short period of wearing them so they don’t stay put very well.
2.0,"It's to thin,would be a nice cap if it was more snug and fit better it's also too thin needs to be thicker"
2.0,Cute earrings but the patter is not on both sides. Only in the front
2.0,"Beautiful at first, but on a hot day my sweat ruined the tint on the lenses."
2.0,This fogs up terribly
2.0,Product came already scratched and with black marks on it.
2.0,Not really what I was expecting. Figured it would be more of a push up bra but its really not
2.0,"I did not like these.  The material made a crinkling noise.  It felt fine, but you could hear a crinkling noise whenever you touched the earmuffs and they did not fold like they were supposed to which I needed so I returned them.  I would have kept them if they had folded nicely even with the crinkly noise."
2.0,"Unflattering cut. I have curves, but this just made me look frumpy."
2.0,"Smaller than expected. I bought a 2X, I wear a size 12 but it was really snug. Not as thick as it looks in the pic. Very soft."
2.0,Came swished in the package and couldn’t get the gold lines out
2.0,"This specific color was completely see through which was not what I was looking for since it was a summer wedding and I didn't want to wear extra layers underneath. Fit looked all right, for the price pretty impressive. I'm 5' 8"" and found it would have been a little short for me."
2.0,"Heavy. And with 6.5&#34; wrists, on the smallest fitting it was still too large. A couple spots of bare metal suggesting that the paint would quickly get scratched. Returned."
2.0,This fabric in the yellow leopard is pretty see through. I wouldn’t wear any color undergarments that didn’t match my skin. The cut is extremely tailored and by that I mean that it will only fit well on someone perfectly shaped to it. My 36B bust didn’t come close to filling it out. It was straight up frumpy on me.
2.0,The color is not at all like the picture. It's a very very light yellow and very sheer. You can see the stitching on the inner lining through the dress. Any undergarments are visible in this dress.
2.0,"This is a Secret Santa gift, a little flimsy for adult but looks nice. The original price $14.98 was left on the product, seller should be up front this is not Ebay"
2.0,The tint on the goggles creates a halo effect when looking at light.
2.0,Correct number of hooks but too short for bra.
2.0,"Was too long, thin and sheds. Sent it back."
2.0,"Nice, thick, warm pants that are very soft. Ordered the pattern my daughter wanted, recieved a completely different pattern. No exchange offered to make it right, only a refund to send them back. She (and I) are very disappointed."
2.0,weren't comfortable to wear all day for me
2.0,Definitely runs very big.
2.0,"I think I would have liked this had it fit properly, but alas it did not. I ordered this and the Allegra K Woman Mesh Panel Front Pullover Casual Slim Top Shirt. The latter fit perfectly, while the former - this one - had sleeves that were too tight. COME ON! It was also made of some sort of itchier material. Dislike."
2.0,"Very thin, they therefore they don't absorb as much as previous versions.  But for the price, so long as you are willing to switch head bands often (and since they are so cheap you can have lots of them) I guess it is still a good deal.<br /><br />I had originally given them 3 stars but after first wash... I have to give them no more than 2...it worn out at the edges after the first wash, while it didn't torn, they look worn like they are very old after the first wash.  Definitively not as good as others I've bought before."
2.0,Great design and look. WAY TOO SMALL! Mine said 3XL for size and I couldn't even get it past my calves. I'm usually a 1X.
2.0,I got an XL in this and the top could easily be a 3x. The shorts are fine. Normal for the size. The pattern is ok. It was nice online.<br />The material is soft and thick but strange. I’m not sure what it is.  I’m keeping it because I wore it to sleep. I wouldn’t buy it again.
2.0,these socks are WAY too small for the average man.  These are tighter than Ted socks!
2.0,I wear hat size about 7 1/2 (new era cap) . This is way too small for me .. also it has a vomit smell ? I washed it multiple times and still had the same smell.. only on 1 mask hood
2.0,Item shipped fast. Was not impressed with this top at all. Was thinking the material would be kinda flowy but it was a cotton t-shirt material and ran extremely small. I requested a return on this item.
2.0,"""True to size"" couldn't be more untrue! I'm a size 10, and really wish the skirt came in SIZES. If i were to size the item that i received, i'd say it's a size 0/1 if you want the skirt to truly wrap around to cover up all your lady parts! If not, HOOCHIE-MAMA is what you get. So sad to have to return it."
2.0,It is a cheap nylon material that does not stretch or breathe at all. It’s more appropriate for PJs then wearing out.
2.0,size was smaller then expected
2.0,"No scratches or marks on the bar or cuff links, but definitely not worth the price. The clip is very flimsy and the cuff link bars twist too easily. I suppose they will make a decent back up set, but I regret getting such a cheap quality set."
2.0,Earrings are too small.
2.0,There is no detailed description on whether or not the mask part is lined. However they are not lined with anything. So you will need to add lining in it or put on a mask underneath it if you're buying them to serve a safety purpose.
2.0,"I wish I hadn't made this purchase... The clicker gets stuck and is very difficult to put in and take out. It also looks very large and awkward on me (which I won't hold against them, just noting that if you have a smaller nose I wouldn't recommend)<br /><br />I was okay with the horseshoe, but be warned, the balls fall off extremely easily, I really wish they had included one or two extras. I wore the horseshoe literally only one day and the ball has already fallen off and gotten lost, very bummed with this purchase."
2.0,These look like poor-man's ski goggles.
2.0,"So I’m kinda confused...I ordered this dress in 2 colors, same size (S) and one is way too long and the other is too short? The material is kind of this weird satiny cheap fabric. Doesn’t look horrible in the blue cuz the dark color kind of hides it, but the brown has a really shiny look to it. I actually like the blue one but it is way too long! I would be tripping over it all the time. Also, the blue one came with a hole in one of the pockets :(<br />Will be returning both.<br /><br />For reference, I’m 5’5” 140 lbs."
2.0,"This was going to be a casual cover-up for my wife to wear at the beach, etc. this summer. She likes the simple dress design and the fabric is a pretty color. Linen is a perfect fabric for summer time. This isn't really linen though, it is a linen/poly blend. Still, it is a nice fabric and she would have enjoyed wearing it. Unfortunately, the buttonholes are too small to insert the buttons into it! Darn!"
2.0,These are most definitely not 18 mm. I'm really disappointed because that's the size I needed. Returning for a refund ☹️
2.0,"Straps broke after only wearing once. It did come with an extra set of straps, but I didn't want to wear the pearl ones, and it was the other ones that broke. It's cute, but not worth it if it breaks that easily."
2.0,I ordered two different color combinations . They both just came with a black thread unlike the pictures.<br />For the price- disappointed. Will not recommend.
2.0,It broke under a week 😐
2.0,"I gave it a low score because the yellow is not the color shown - it's a deep, mustard brown color (not very becoming!).<br />I was hoping for bright and cheerful.  It's not."
2.0,I must have missed this was a children’s hat in disscription.  Does not fit but he is keeping it.
2.0,Lenses to big
2.0,The colors are good but the wristbands unhook too easily. I caught it the first couple of times but as of last week no more Fit Bit .  don't have any idea where it fell off :(
2.0,"This item arrived quickly, but I did not care for the quality of the faceplate. It slipped when on the phone on the upper portion. To remove the bottom portion was difficult without scratching the phone itself. I am using a different cover for my phone because of the factors listed previously."
2.0,"I love a basic tank dress but this was way too thing and poorly made. This is not for any woman with curves, you can see right through the fabric and it's thin as a tissue.  Might be good for someone very thing, as long as it doesn't hug your body."
2.0,La calidad no es la esperada pero hacen el trabajo
2.0,"I purchased the green dress in small. I'm 5'10"", 154 pounds. I normally wear size 6. This dress was extremely tight. I couldn't zip it up.  I'm thinking of going up to a large. Love the style of the dress."
2.0,"Hard to set time and date , too many knobs"
2.0,So I'm doing a late review I've worn these pants twice since I received them and here I was today I'll grocery shopping and the seam in the crotch split wide open.<br />They're comfortable pants and they fit perfectly and they are baggy and fox which is nice but I'm disappointed in the overall all of it all
2.0,"This top totally doesn't match measurements on description. On large, bust measure 36&#34;(supposed to be 40.4&#34;) and length is 24&#34;(supposed to be 26&#34;)."
2.0,"Sizing was no where near a double x, is too tight and not comfortable at all"
2.0,"Not breathable at all, but looked cool."
2.0,It wasn't as cute as picture.. but my daughter loves it. The crown on the front of dress was damage since this was shipped from China. I am keeping but I wouldn't buy again.
2.0,One of the posts is loose.  I'm thinking superglue.
2.0,What you don't see is that the lining is white! And the back is longer than the front and cut like an arch instead of horizontally
2.0,Super thin<br />Soft material
2.0,Cheap and not enough tint.
2.0,"I bought these for my niece who recently got her ears pierced, and she loved the look of them, but that’s where their functionality as earrings stopped. Almost immediately after giving them to her, one of the plastic backs broke off (which apparently kept happening, as she told me the other day that they ALL broke).<br /><br />Of course before giving something to my niece, I tried it myself, and the plastic (when it stays attached to the earring) requires a lot of effort to get into your ear, but I think that could also be because I don’t wear earrings that often anymore."
2.0,Too lage returning
2.0,"For the money, it's not bad, but it would be nice if the color and tone of the stones matched one another.  I attach pictures to show you what was sent to me.  The middle stone is much darker and looks like a child's toy gem.  The other two smaller stones are nicer looking.  I will be sending this back, or donating ASAP.  Very quick shipping!"
2.0,"my tits are way too big for this thing, but my torso fits perfect. Good luck busty ladies."
2.0,"The bottoms are fabulous.  The top is simply too small for me.  I ordered an XXL and am a 34DD or sometimes 34DDD.  There's simply not enough room in the top for someone that's busty.  Disappointing, since the suit style is so fabulous!"
2.0,"I saved this bag in my &#34;want list&#34; for awhile.  I dreamt about this bag.  I adored this bag.  Then I got it and saw it IRL.  I ordered the 'brown&#34; because on the internet it looks so freaking beautiful.  Nope.  IRL it looks like a gigantic football.  If it looks EXACLTY like it does in the picture I'd keep it and use it every day.  But, alas, if I kept it, I'd probably only use it a few times.  Probably during my kids football games!!!!  *le sigh*"
2.0,Wasn't what I thought it was going to fit or good plus too small
2.0,These are not as bright as they are pictured and very cheaply made.
2.0,"The socks are fine, except they chose to embroider their logo on each side of the sock on the side of the foot. After wearing the compression socks, the embroidery threads on the inside of the socks leave deep imprints on both sides of both feet. That's a fairly simple design flaw that could be mitigated by simply embroidering the logo at the top of the sock where there are 2 layers of fabric."
2.0,The item was of good quality and I may have been able to use it I cut it in half.
2.0,I got the Grinch masks.  They say for kids but they are not!  This will fit someone in their late teens. But not for small children.  In fact they fit me perfect.
2.0,"The hat was shipped in a polybag.  The creased still remain after a month.  Also, the bow at the back of the hat is glued on, but is easily fixed with a bit of hot glue or other glue.  The hat does provide good sun protection and is very lightweight."
2.0,"First impressions with this jacket were just OK, it comes vacuum sealed so needs time to fluff up, but is still pretty thin. However, after looking over the jacket closer I unfortunately noticed some really poor stitching (see pics). Perhaps I just received a bad example, but based on my experience with the jacket I received, this is hard to recommend."
2.0,The material is Very stiff. It is really long & too skinny for the size I purchased
2.0,The first time I wore these glasses I ended up giving them to a friend who loved them probably even more than I did. They're so cute I had to order them again for myself.<br /><br />Edit: The second pair arrived cracked and bent with jagged edges around the bridge. It was raining when they came and I didn't  open them until this week. It's after the return window so I'm stuck with damaged sunglasses. They weren't the same quality as the first pair and I regret reordering them.
2.0,"Look great, but left green make on my ear...and my ear was read and swollen."
2.0,In answers to questions about the heal having a back to keep the slipper from coming off they say yes.  It Does Not
2.0,"Firstly they stick extremely well at the base. However the part that is supposed to lift everything up does not work at all if you have a bigger size breast. I'm a DD bought according to recommendation and it just didn't do the job. Also if you have on a thinner top at all you can definitely see the outline of it, plus the top is visible on pretty much anything unless you have only a deep cut V top and sleeves/thick sleeveless blouse."
2.0,Not happy with this purchase. Shipping took over a month. The quality of the dress was cheap. Runs small. Colors were pretty but just not a good dress. I ordered another dress similar to this one and received it in less than a week. The quality was way better.
2.0,The earrings are pretty and sparkly. They are not sturdy at all.<br />The clasp was thin and bent easily. One earring would not close at all. I was afraid to force it because it might break.<br />These were returned with no problem at all.
2.0,Not made for people over 5'3&#34; also it doesn't look like the picture. Still kinda cute. Gave it to my 9 year old daughter.
2.0,The gaiters were nice but too tight to fit over my head to wear them. I am a small woman. Barely larger than a child but I couldn’t even get them on-even after removing my glasses! If you buy these then be looking at them for your small child. They just won’t fit an adult.
2.0,bad clasp design.  Won't stay on.
2.0,"The shield doesn't fit well n pops off when you pull it down slowly into place. Had to alter the hat to makeit work n the shield is softer than expected so it gets wrinkled,  causing a warped view"
2.0,Beautiful design but super tight so uncomfortable to wear.
2.0,"These are above my ankle at 5'9"".  Not worth the money."
2.0,These shoes fell apart quickly. Super cute but not worth it.
2.0,Design and color are good. Price is not bad compared to others. But it is not comfortable to wear it for long time compared to my other compression stockings. Color is not vivid anymore after one time washing.  I would not buy again.
2.0,For the price the locket was decent although a little flimsy. Be prepared to buy a new chain. Mine came completely tarnished and just an overall yuck feel. We are only using this to announce our pregnancy to my MIL so it will work.
2.0,"the bottom part of the bend is to short,"
2.0,Ordered a large and it was long and thin.  So if you are a short stalky person this shirt just doesn't fit right.
2.0,A little thin & tight. Fine for wearing to sleep. Would not purchase again
2.0,"Touch screen does not work. Rubber pieces already coming off, just got them today and wore them for 20 mins...kept my hands warm but other features are useless."
2.0,Just don't like it.
2.0,Love these undies but unfortunately one of them came torn! Actually discovered that at least 2 of them have small tears in them
2.0,"purchased as gift for my visually impaired Mother - numbers are completely different than shown - not as bold, and more &#34;script&#34; like...not as easy to read.  Truly not sure it will work for her. Disappointed in that factor.  the watch itself is cute, but, again, not what I was expecting."
2.0,Cute dress just didnt work for my body type
2.0,"The fabric is not soft satin as expected. Also the shorts have a weird fit, it gets soggy on the back."
2.0,I returned this item. The top was too small and very low cut. Seemed to be good quality when I tried it on and it was very soft.
2.0,"They fit fine, but are super uncomfortable!!! The balls on the bottom hurt my feet everytime I walk and one of them fell off already( had them a week) Look cute, but feel horrible. The company did get them to me on time."
2.0,"This is a thin, lightweight jacket w/o hood, for the early fall or spring seasons. I like the color and style. But, I felt discomfort when I wear a jacket. The body and the shoulders fit perfectly, but the sleeves were short. I have an M-size. When I move my arms, the movement was limited. This happens when the garment is sewn in the wrong cut. Such kinds of clothes are often found in outlet stores."
2.0,"They looked great, however the material was very thin and ripped easily"
2.0,"Material is same as my Mom’s old nightdresses, super thin and clingy.  Size is small and not much give.  Colors are close but not exact.  Disappointed"
2.0,WORKMANSHIP WAS MUCH CHEAPER THAN SHOWN
2.0,Not  a good material - no stretch to it. like a stiff unflattering cotton
2.0,Love the style but they keep breaking on me.  I have ordered two pairs so far because I just love the style but I am wasting money.
2.0,Low quality. Too rigid and hard.
2.0,"Nice picture. Mask is too heavy, thick. Difficult to breathe. I never wear it."
2.0,"The dress is polyester,not what I expected sorry it is such a disappointment."
2.0,"I was really excited to get these because at work I am on my feet everyday; the compression felt good, but when I got home from work they had dug into my legs. I didn't think too much of it, but where they dug into my legs the marks were still there 3 day later! I have some that I think are permanent!"
2.0,"First, can I say how tired I am of Asian manufacturers claiming that Asian women are smaller and hence Americans must order several sizes up? That's just baloney -- I wear a size 4, and this XXL just barely fits me. Asian women are not 4 sizes smaller than I am, these sizes are just intended to shame the buyer!!! Luckily, I was able to figure out the right size from the fine print, but It's time for Amazon to start listing their clothing by actual garment measurements rather than phony made-up sizes.<br /><br />Anyway, the color and cut are flattering and went well with my outfit, but the quality is mediocre. Upon arrival, the lining was already frayed and there was a hole in one pocket. Both pockets are unnecessarily shallow. The belt has sharp metal edges that scratched up the leather the first time I wore it, and the waistband got rubbed and slightly discolored underneath the belt (from the leather, not from the buckle.) I don't expect it will last very long, but I'll keep it because it's not worth the hassle to return it at the price."
2.0,It’s okay not as nice as l expected. But it’s okay!
2.0,Too Smalll!
2.0,"See through material. The pants are very comfortable but that doesn't matter to me if the material is see through. Also they are not a material I wanted for working out as they are very thin, not a lot of support, etc. I am returning them."
2.0,"Not as pictured. Blackhawk face is black & white. Same sock, but low quality of print. Company should re-think printing the face better."
2.0,"Very thin, but will serve the purpose for that one day intended to wear them. They leggings have a black line toward the bottom of one leg, looks like maybe a machine did it. I most likely won’t buy another pair. Does seem good to wear as pajamas."
2.0,I didnt like this watch. Idk if its even sfill at my home where i cant even go azamon delamn goosux
2.0,"The dress feels more like a costume, the fabric is very thick and heavy.  Also, the shoulders are cut too big so there is a lot of extra fabric up top and the sleeves are shorter than shown.  Definitely returned this dress."
2.0,The shirt is adorable but although the sizing chart said it ran one size smaller they were wrong!  It runs about 2 or 3 sizes smaller.  Very disappointing!
2.0,"Despite the extravagant claims about length (""men, boys, women, and Hercules""), this strap is a full two inches shorter than the Geckota strap I was going to replace. I don't know if I'll return this or just throw it away, but I'll get a different strap."
2.0,"It looks nice, its very light. and the extra dials don't make much sense. the counter in the middle goes to 39. ??? Still not sure the purpose of that. the Month and day dials dont actually point to any specfic day or month. But is still looks aesthetically pleasing. And I get compliments on it. For the price its worth it."
2.0,"Was very excited about this, no sparkle, rather dull. Poor quality chain. The crystal looks like resin, metal is very dark and greyish :("
2.0,"Thin material so unflattering around the midsection. The way the sides are uneven, that too is not a great look once it's on."
2.0,"These pants are great length. Im six foot tall 175 lbs typically wear womens size 12. I wear ladies size large. These pants I purchased in XL because I wanted some extra room for exercising and the waist was uncomfortably tight and the pants were overall very fitted and tight. I am returning. Also, the fabric is thin and stretchy like leggings."
2.0,"I was super saddened when I opened this package. I sized up and everything and the skirt was still incredibly small! It looked just as pictured in the picture so I had high hopes till it came time for trying it on. Oh well, guess I’ll give it as a gift."
2.0,I would go up one size especially if you have toned arms.
2.0,"I would be happy with them except they are SO thick. They cause my ears to stick out because they are so thick. I do not wear them,  waste of money. I will stick to websites that are specifically for jewelry like this."
2.0,"All in all it’s a cute outfit, but the white fuzzy trim has some really hard and sticky spots that are unfortunate in a piece of lingerie."
2.0,Really nice looking sunglasses. The lenses fade from dark at the top to clear at the bottom. Kinda pointless if you're looking to darken your view.
2.0,Such a cool shoe but a full size smaller than it should be . I am a 39 and there is no way I can fit this 39. I would return but too expensive for an international order
2.0,Nice looking shoes but came with a stain on one of them
2.0,"The straps are way to long, the material is more of a silky material, my daughter hasn't worn it yet, as it's for Thanksgiving, but hopefully we can make it work. The button slits are not sewn, just cut."
2.0,I orders this received it fast unfortently my sister is a 4T so I order a 5T and it's way to small<br /><br />Loved the shirt tho and am 're ordering in a larger size gonna go with the 7T this time
2.0,"I didnt like it, but that doesnt mean you wont. the fabric seemed super cheap like foam/felt and it just didnt look good on me."
2.0,"They were not sewn with matching corners.  As a result, warped.<br />  Using a hot hair dryer could not re-shape it."
2.0,"Way too small , when I use it , my finger was stucked , it is really not easy to use these gloves to wash anything at all , to be honest ,after few uses , I purchase some other brand to use"
2.0,Looks dingy and faded after the first wash
2.0,Strap broke first day I wore it
2.0,"Cut for someone with a fifty inch inseam. Crazy long, but the worst part is, they are sheer! Like so transparent you can see tan lines... Big disappointment."
2.0,"great shape and material, however the second time wearing them to work, I've realized how uncomfortable they are.  The return window has closed. So I'm stuck with them"
2.0,I was so excited when I found this and so disappointed when it arrived and the legs are so tiny and fit so tight it can’t be worn. Going back! Thank
2.0,"Returned this dress because it was too small and tight. Beautiful, though, for someone who is ultra thin."
2.0,Every time you wash it it stretches out and gets bigger
2.0,"Dress was too large for me, I’m S/M and too synthetic for me😕"
2.0,The metal was not pleasant on the face. The strap was too tight.
2.0,"I wear size 4 dresses and 4 pants. This is too small even to wear around my waist, let alone my hips. Fits size 0-2 maybe, not 4, and in no universe ever 10."
2.0,"takes a lot of pressure to open, when it does the opening is very small"
2.0,I order to big of a stone looks fake
2.0,Cheaply made and only received the boy outfit! Read fine print because its very deceiving
2.0,Not the same material as the navy dress. It doesn't have any stretch.
2.0,"Absolutely loved the look of these glasses, super cute! The only downfall was the nose piece is metal and is NOT for those who have very sensitive skin... I would wear them for maybe 30 min and my nose would get itchy and red marks would be left for a couple days from the irritation so I finally just decided to toss them."
2.0,The belt was very disappointing!  Poor quality and definitely not worth the price.  The design is absolutely ridiculous!
2.0,Could only wear once and not the zipper is stuck!
2.0,Tarnished after 2 weeks. Not impressed with the quality at all.
2.0,"Not sure if you can tell from the pic or not, but this came with zipper issues. The zippers were in the middle of the zipper, but zipped on both sides. This is typically what happens to a zipper right before it stops working.<br /><br />The material is also much cheaper looking and feeling than I expected. And the tote is small, it does not look like the size in the listing"
2.0,Cool concept but the quality isn’t worth the money
2.0,"Good color, but the dimensions of the scarf were 72&#34; x 18&#34;. No. Just no.<br />72 inches is 6 feet. 18 inches is 1.5 feet. So I was expecting a wrap. But I'm 5'6&#34; with an average build and I could barely get it to wrap all the way around me. It was exactly what I'd wanted, but the sizing wasn't very true."
2.0,Is not sized correctly- way smaller than other clothes sizes I buy.
2.0,Falls apart when you try to put it on
2.0,"LOVE  this dress and the fit is the same as the first one I got several months ago, however, this one has holes in both pockets. Was going to return it and reorder BUT the delivery date instead of being a few days as these were is several weeks away and city being shipped from sounds like it's China. Considering the green one that came with this fits very differently and is being returned I decided to keep this one and sew up the pockets myself. not worth taking a chance the next one's fit is off. Consequently I will no longer recommend this to friends, too bad. Great price for a cotton & spandex dress that's GREAT over leggings for errands or yoga here in the East, I've had lots of compliments and extremely comfortable, and can be dressed up or down. Even plan on wearing for yoga w/turtlemneck underneath in winter...."
2.0,"Flimsy fabric makes shirt look cheap.  The style is lovely but quality was so disappointing. Also, the fit was not right. It was too small."
2.0,Cheap but broke within a week. Looks nice.
2.0,Did not fit at all runs so small had to return. I wear a 38c tried a large barely covered my nipples
2.0,"Love the style!  However, I thought they would be more of a larger frame.  The size was much more fitting for a child than an Adult."
2.0,Too small had to give away
2.0,The product is well made and does look good . Only thing is it is not a one size fits all.  I had to modify the velcro so I could loosen the fit.
2.0,I sized up but it looks like the size of a child's large not an adult large. The material feels good and the design is neat just sad that it runs extremely small!
2.0,Wanted to love this. Was weird and clingy. I want to try a larger size and see how it fits.
2.0,"I was SO looking forward to getting this and wearing it! BUT nothing is right with it. I could barely fit my head through the hole, the shirt is super tight and super short. I should’ve never bought this! If you buy this, go like 2 sizes up!!!"
2.0,Great glass with proper shade.  I gave only 2 stars because they run WAY TO SMALL.  I was looking forward to use them climbing the Volcano Cotopaxi next week.
2.0,"Too tiny, i returned it"
2.0,"Glue on the outside of the rim, around the lights. Some of the lights phase out, but come back after tapping on them. Batteries didn't last long."
2.0,"I love the color and style of this swimsuit, but right away I could tell the cups were obviously way too big for me. I'm a large in most swimwear and haven't come across one that was proportioned like this. The bottom half fit perfectly though. So, if you're a size large with smaller breast cup needs, this will definitely not work!"
2.0,Cut too small has to return. Would have been nice though
2.0,"The watch is cute but the teaching elements on the hands are way too small to be useful.<br />Granted, there are various ways to teach time but at the least, I expected the lettering to be large enough to be easily read.  If you want a watch that is Summer ready, this isn't it.  It's not waterproof or water resistant but I knew that when I purchased it.  As for quality, it's too soon after the purchase to comment."
2.0,I am 5’8” and these are like high waters on me. A little short for my liking but I will wear them around the house
2.0,"Such a beautiful set. However, I am missing an earring. This set was supposed to be a gift for a family friend but unfortunately, I need to return it. It was really pretty too. Just wish it wasn’t missing pieces"
2.0,"Fits huge, not super easy to wear, but maybe a smaller size would be better. I’m not small and this was like a tent on me."
2.0,ordered a medium and it came as a cropped sweatshirt
2.0,"Should of known, I thought It was very cute and affordable. This bracelet broke very quickly"
2.0,"I'm so disappointed. This isn't anything other than a button up pajama top. The material is shiny, the buttons are huge and the cut is NOT batwing. The belt is way too short. It looks dumpy, nothing like the photo."
2.0,Really big/awkwardly high waisted
2.0,"Dress part fits very well, however the bottom is much too short and slightly small. Had to buy a bottom with longer  legs. Don't like the bikini type bottoms."
2.0,Material is really thin and cheap. Feels a little like Halloween customers material. But the design is very nice. Hopefully a little ironing and starch will get this good enough for the office. I bought 5 other better dresses at the same time. I wouldn’t bother with this one.
2.0,"These are really short. They fit well everywhere else. I am 5'7&#34; and most t-shirts fit me pretty good. These ones sit just above the waistband of my jeans prior to being washed. I washed one in cold water and hung dry, but it still shrunk. It now doesn't even reach the waistband."
2.0,"I bought the white small version of this dress. The straps were too long (I am 5' 1&#34;, 117 lbs, 32DD) and the dress itself was too big. My bust fit fine in it and did not feel like I was busting out. I'll be returning it though b/c I am not going to get alterations done on a dress for this price. The fabric is more of a silky polyester than a cotton. For a white dress, it is not see-thru at all. It's a thick white fabric. And I'm saying this as a woman of color."
2.0,We liked the patterns but the fit was too tight for my 6 and 8 yr old. We would have returned but the kids had already opened them all.
2.0,cheap crappy watch. It looks great at first glace but simply feel it and its plastic. Stopped working after one day and diamonds are just sooo fake. I mean its the nicest crappy watch their is for the money.
2.0,Had to return these they were way to tight on my calves ..what a shame because they are such beautiful boots
2.0,Was unsatisfied with no tie shoelaces.<br />The plastic piece that's supposed to hold the laces in place didn't work so I had to tie it in a knot.
2.0,"Great looking tank top, with a good fit, but don't wear them while you're lifting. I wore one of them yesterday while lifting, and within minutes there were several areas where the material is starting to pull away from the tank top. Very disappointed that these can't be worn while working out."
2.0,Fit was strange..
2.0,It was too baggy for me but probably good for someone else
2.0,"I felt like this ran a little too large, but that was OK. What I really did not like is that the description says that it is gray and black. It is NOT. The &#34;black&#34; is purple :("
2.0,All my clothes are 2xI ordered a 2X in is not true to the size
2.0,The watch was so small it looked like it could be for a child. It did not feel like gunmetal at all and was very light. There are no good aspects about this watch. The shipping was on time though.
2.0,"It fit, but looked like a church dress"
2.0,"The color is nothing like in the pic, in which it seems very light and soft pink. The shade is actually so much darker, kind of a dirty dark salmon color rather than pink - I don't like the color at all. Also, it's a really short scarf, a lot shorter than what I expected! (I know I should have checked the size more carefully, I'll admit that.) Bottom line, the cats are the only thing I like about this scrf!"
2.0,The fit.  The style.  Much smaller than medium size which is what I ordered.  Missed the return date due to death in family from COVID.
2.0,This bracelet was a gift to my daughter who really likes the one infinity sign. I was so disappointed when I saw how very small it was. I could barely get it on her wrist. It was just too tight 😔<br />The bracelet is pretty and dainty.
2.0,"but beware, the neck is not sturdy and flops over when wearing.  Not that you will wear it often, this was purchased for a four year old."
2.0,The shoe has a good look and feel except the hole your foot goes into doesn't isn't tight enough to keep the shoe from raising up on the back as you walk. Length was perfect. To bad I can't use them.
2.0,Ordered an XL and it fits like a small. I couldn’t even close it around me. Luckily my teenaged daughter can fit it otherwise I’d send it beck
2.0,"They were too small for my nipples, the ball was very hard to get off, and they were externally threaded. The only reason this has two stars is because they are made of titanium"
2.0,"After using this maybe 5 times at most, the mechanism is broken and it won't close all the way, so the umbrella part won't open.  The alleged lifetime warranty is suspicious because I can't find a website or address to use.  I've had it for three months, so can't return it to Amazon.<br />Update:  Finally found a way to contact the merchant through Amazon and they say they're sending a new umbrella.  Will update once I receive it.<br />Update: Received TWO umbrellas as replacements for the defective one, very quickly.  They both work now.  I've raised the star rating to two.  If they still work after several uses, I'll raise it higher.  The umbrella is small and light - if it works for a while, it warrants a 4 rating.  One star off for the lack of relibility.  Customer service, once I got in touch with them, was very responsive."
2.0,"Does not fit my neck which is 17&#34;, had to buy another at the store since I didn't have time to order another."
2.0,"It did NOT fit.  It did NOT look right.  Maybe I am too short?  Maybe my arms are too short & stubby?  And the elastic straps were as TIGHT AS THE SHACKLES OF HADES.  I feared they would cut off the circulation of my arms, LOL.  The wings didn't lay right...........  And the fabric & color were just, meh, so I don't even want to ""Make it Work"" as Tim Gunn would say on Project Runway, lol.  Good thing it is cheap.  Will use for some random craft project during next quarantine.  Curtains? Kite? Flag? Pillow? Weird Wrap Skirt?  Hey!, now I am starting to feel better about this purchase, lol."
2.0,Very Cheap looking and Stiff Leather.
2.0,Earring are too large and goddie
2.0,comfortable fit. however they do not look rose gold tone they look clear.
2.0,The dress itself was beautiful and classy but the material was poor and the sizing was way off :( I opened it and it looked as if the seems would come apart and then it was at least 2 sizes too big. It's a good dress for a play or costume  but not for a fancy occasion.
2.0,awful material. very itchy and was full of static cling as soon as i put it on. the strappy cut out design does not lay flat and looks messy (even though i have plenty to fill out the top!)
2.0,"Horribly see thru, thin material"
2.0,"Guys this dress was comfortable and slimming but the strap broke on my dress in the middle of my valentines dinner. I have B cup breast, am 5’1” at 115 lbs, no reason why this should have broken. Then i washed it and the other one broke. Do NOT buy. Such a waste of money and time"
2.0,Although both pieces are beautiful independently they are a bit much together as a set. . Unfortunately I had to return it.
2.0,"Not much bling for the buck.  In fact, no bling at all; just indentations. The way the picture portrays this, it looks like it will lay over your &#34;girls&#34; in a flattering way.  The only way it would do this is if you pinned each side to your bra.  One you tie around your neck, it loses its appeal."
2.0,Product is too narrow and rolls down really easily on movement.
2.0,This item look very costumish. And very big as gody!
2.0,I have purchased these 5 different times because the screws always come out. I get so many compliments & I really do like them but I feel like they never last long & shouldn’t be that easy for the screws to become lose & once it’s gone no other screw fits.
2.0,This purse didn't make it a whole day with me. The quality seems fine and it looks like the picture. It is WAY too small for me.  My wallet didn't even fit.
2.0,"They are just ok. I got size 9.5 foot. these run small. So, I donated them to Goodwill since cost was very little"
2.0,I bought a size up and I couldnt wear it and 2 other girls in the office that are smaller than me cant wear either.
2.0,The busy is way larger then the body of the dress. With some tape and a pin I could wear it.
2.0,The fit is all over the place for this outfit. We bought the 3month rage set. The headband is huge (our daughter is in the 90th percentile) and the red bow just flopped in her face. We had to fold the band in half just to get it to stay. The little shorts are adorable and fit perfectly. However the onesie was very wide in the thighs and the print isn’t as pictured. The glasses are so low on the onesie they are cover by the shorts. If you want to see them you have to pull the shorts so low they basically fall off.  We ended up just using the shorts with a plain onesie and a read headband.
2.0,Fit was to small
2.0,"To small, it was nice doing business with you."
2.0,"Sinceramente tube Que regalarlo, cuando me llegaron me gustaron pero cuando me los puse un lente se veía más oscuro que otro y no me permitía ver con claridad el teléfono por los diferentes tonos de color en el lente."
2.0,Very pretty color that matches the picture but the other reviewers are right that the stones fall out. I was hoping mine would be different. I have metal cement from a hardware store that I put the stones back with. Hoping that holds up. I was super lucky that the stones fell out on top of my bed so I was able to rescue these earrings so far (what are the odds!).
2.0,"It’s way too big for a medium imo. Too bunchy to wear if I want it form fitting at all and I’m 5’6”, 145#, size 6 US. No idea how to exchange it though..."
2.0,"It took 6 weeks to get to me. The rings look just like the picture, but they are bigger and when i put it through my nose, it touches the other side of my nose. (too long). but it is cheap. so if you do not mind waiting 6 weeks and constantly fixing your nose ring, then these are for you!"
2.0,I ordered a 3x and it fitted real small.
2.0,Size is okay but fabric was thinner than I expected.  You can see right through them.
2.0,Not good in quality.
2.0,This hat came folded up and has creases that will not come out no matter how many times I wet it down and try to get them out.
2.0,Lasted about a month or so then falls apart
2.0,"It’s exactly what you see in the picture, but it’s very small and short.  short enough to be a bracelet, but not a anklet"
2.0,"The style is nice, 'flowy' at the bottom - but it fits too tight in the sleeves and shoulders. Also made in China."
2.0,Pretty. Im a AA 32... Still a lil big but may shrink... Tie straps badly thin... Taking it to have it secured better so it doesnt pull apart in public.
2.0,"It's a cute top but it didn't really fit like the picture.  I wanted something slouchy, but it fits like a normal shirt at the neck and is too small over the torso, so that part of my belly shoes.  It's pretty much what I expected from these types of sellers, though, and the price made it worth the gamble."
2.0,"For starters...... you can see right through the pants, very thin material. Also the pants are made very poorly, very tight at the calves, which is weird because normally it would be tighter at the waist or thighs. I won't buy again!"
2.0,Definitely not the material you might think. Not as thick as  a blazer should be. The inseam also is not great.
2.0,"Sheds like crazy! I tried it on over a black long sleeve, had bits of thread and fuzzies ALL OVER. It’s more of a red color than burgundy. Not happy with it"
2.0,Material to thin and sizes are off. Size large should be small.
2.0,These were way too small for me to use (I have arthritis). I had to return them. Picture is misleading and should either be actual size or show them on a model.
2.0,I ordered a medium but received an XL. I did not try the dress on as it wouldn’t have mattered since it was 2 sizes too big for me to judge how it looked on. The hot pink looked like the photo and looked nice.
2.0,It literally reeks to it's core fiber of marijuana.<br />The smell was so pungent that my search and recove dog zoned in on the scent.<br />Does everyone's purchase come with a free try it get high!? This is ridiculous. Does the seller even care products are being delivered in this manner?!
2.0,"When a first arrived I tried them on according to the size chart they should have fit comfortably they were a little snug, but after washing and drying them on low I even tried trying them by just hanging them up they still shrink about 3/4 in all the way around"
2.0,The material for this dress was very thin. I bought an 2XL for my niece. She is actually a size XL but the XL was out of stock and I thought we could just have it taken up (it was for a small gathering after her wedding this Saturday). When she tried it on it she couldn’t get it over her breasts.
2.0,"This footie is too wide, doesn't have elastic at the ankle and the buttons are far apart.  Thus, my baby is constantly getting her leg up into the pajamas and then her foot goes out a hole between snaps."
2.0,"I really wish I could return. Skirt has no stretch to it, so you can’t place lower on hips. Mine fits  around my waist and is SOOOOO SHORT!! The quality is costumey. Not a fan at all."
2.0,The material seems different and also is not the same shorts as in the picture.
2.0,This is nice in person... fits well and holds my wife's tracker securely. Looks nice with her work outfits. But the plating on the metal pieces is very poor quality. Only 3 or 4 days of wearing it and the silver wore off the links and the copper is showing through. Two weeks in and it is turning her wrist black. She would have paid a few dollars more to have a quality finish like PVD or Stainless Steel.
2.0,"I purchased the purple fleece bathrobe for my daughter, within the first week the inside tie to help keep the robe shut had fallen off. This was a gift so needless to say I am a bit disappointed and embarrassed that it is having issues."
2.0,"Not large enough for my head. The delivery was fine, the product seemed fine, except for it just was not large enough for my head. When I adjusted the glasses and neck rope, to the longest available position, they were so tight they would hit my eyelashes when I had them on. I will cut a 2 inch Space in the net connector, and use electric tape to bridge the gap.Outside of that, they are nice glasses."
2.0,Wanted it for working out but it’s pretty much a Regular shirt
2.0,I had to send these back. The reviews said to order 2 sz larger and that was still too small for me. Ordering by mail is too challenging to know product specifics.
2.0,"This umbrella quality seems somewhat poor, given that it is not powerful at all, once it's opened and there's a steady wind, the umbrella turns upside down and becomes difficult to tame."
2.0,Got the item and no stone in one of earrings
2.0,This shirt is cheaply made and does not come in the right size you may order.
2.0,"Color looks purple and it’s suppose to be a red for January birthstone; packaging was sloppy, one earring on one side of packet and the other on the other side.  And they just look like I paid $1.00 for them.  Very disappointed."
2.0,Needs to be advertised for a child if that is what they are for. These were much to small for my team to wear for the breast cancer relay.
2.0,wayyy bigger than expected
2.0,Pretty shirt but fits big
2.0,"Not what I expected, frames was not the size shown in the picture."
2.0,"My boyfriend loved them but the bottoms fell apart after he had worn them 15-20 times in the first month. They still work but soon his feet will be completely worn through. Cool product, just not well made."
2.0,"The dress fit okay, but did not look flattering on and the material on the bottom half is rough and hard. It does not flow and feels uncomfortable."
2.0,"First of all, mine were not as pictured, the two lotus parts were exactly the same, as in the bigger leaf was on the right on both which bothers me. But I let it go. The real thing that bothers me is that these come in 3 separate pieces. They are hard to get on and just feel weird. There's the bar, the lotus, and then the backing to keep them on. Not very comfortable and not what I expected."
2.0,I was getting headaches when wearing.<br />The sunglasses seem like ther double vision or 3d glasses. Style looks great<br />But can't wear due  to distortion
2.0,"Disappointed in general...especially in regard to the price.  This temporal realistic assessment does not factor in any benefits, including comfort, that may otherwise be derived from the item."
2.0,"the orange color of the frame is too bright, even in indoor casual light.<br />it makes your eyes always see it, You can't concentrate in other things."
2.0,crown too big. returned.
2.0,I'm 5'4 and the length of this sweater is so short I can't wear it.  I love the sweater but it looks like a girl's size.  I honestly don't know how it could fit the model the way it is pictured because it's 'one size fits all' and on my short frame it is just below my waist and the sleeves are also much shorter.  It's too bad because it really is a cute sweater but definitely sized for a child not a woman :-(  I was traveling when I received the sweater so also missed the return timeline.  I will likely give it to my 12 year old niece.
2.0,"Before I purchased these earrings, others had commented on their poor quality.  These are cute but not really a very high quality."
2.0,I should have done a better job overlooking the hat when I got it. It was pretty lopsided & needed reshaping. Was a cheap quality and not very comfortable. Okay for a costume but I won't wear it casually. Not worth the price.
2.0,Was supposed to be burgendy but wasnt. It was red
2.0,didn't not fit well and wasn't easy to get into boot to wear. :(
2.0,Not getting the color that was shown to us
2.0,Cheaply made.. All the bows fell off second time she wore it..
2.0,It is cheap but very low quality fabric. Especially the collar is too loose.  Does not look like good and can be used only as pajamas.
2.0,I really wanted to love this. This bracelet is well made and a beautiful rose gold but It does not hold a pony tail! Any sudden movements and the pony tail slides off the braclet. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Its cute but I dont like the draw string adjuster, its not comfortable."
2.0,"The print is on point, but the dress itself is boxy and deeply unflattering. I chose exactly the size I wear on a regular basis, so I'm disappointed. I got rid of the dress as soon as I took it off from my try-on.<br /><br />Best if you have a concave abdomen because any millimeter of roundness WILL be made to look massive."
2.0,Fit is way too tight.  Lovely socks just don't fit.  Not everybody has beanpole legs.
2.0,It caused me to breakout :(
2.0,the width of the shoe is giant.
2.0,Don’t like the quality. Returned
2.0,To small can't return it.
2.0,Much too long and they feel cheap.  I'm going back to Vermont Country Store for my socks.
2.0,Heavy and too expensive for composite turquoise.  Can get nicer Navajo earrings on other sites.
2.0,Looks just like the picture but the shirt is shorter and flares at the bottom and the ties on my shorts were backwards compared to the pockets.
2.0,"The swimsuit fit okay, I ordered a size up and ended up not being super uncomfortable - there wasn't as much give in the swimsuit like normal ones because of the lace waist I am assuming, Idk? However, the swimsuit bled like crazy!! My lace is saturated with maroon coloring and the water surrounding the swimsuit was colored! You get what you pay for,  I suppose. If you need a cheaper, one wear, you don't care about crazy color bleeds, then this swimsuit might work for you?"
2.0,I Ike the design  when I received it but it fit way too small. If you purchase this item you will need to go two sizes up from what you normally wear.
2.0,"Se ve de n color en la foto y en realidad el tono es diferente, lo devolvî y lleva demasiado tiempo y no me reembolsan mi dinero"
2.0,"These are not high enough, they are very uncomfortable because they aren't high enough, and they roll down.  I don't like them at all.  Wish I could return them, but unfortunately you don't know they don't fit right until you wear them, then its too late to return them."
2.0,"To anyone thinking of purchasing this for the beautiful necklace shown in the photo - DON’T.<br />I’m attaching two photos.  One showing the image presented in the listing with the bright red stone, and a photo of what actually arrived - a dark red/brownish tinged stone.<br />If you are looking for a dark colored stone, this may be great for you.  But if not, it’s not what is pictured by the seller.<br />We returned it to try again, maybe it was from a bad batch, I’ll change this rating next week if the new one arrives any different."
2.0,after about a month the top band came off on mine my mothers and sisters but they are good other than that really liked the till that happened so now they wont stay up
2.0,The horse are to big.
2.0,Lightweight. Much more flimsy than expected.
2.0,Looks great at first but within two months the magnet got stretched out and won’t stay attached. Very sad - and I see no way to exchange or return because to me that’s defective
2.0,To small of a fit
2.0,"The stitching is nice, but I got the nude color because it looked yellow in the picture. It does not look like the picture. The little flower is a patch that I noticed it is already peeling off and could probably come off in the wash. Not very thrilled about this purchase."
2.0,"The hat I received is nowhere near as tall as the 7&#34; one pictured.<br /><br />Also, this hat does not fit my head (I have a large head). I can't complain as much about this because I have issues with hat fitting all of the time.The deviation from the advertised picture is false advertising."
2.0,Was cute for short term wear.
2.0,"The glasses changed the color of lights from white to yellow, which helped the brightness, however they did NOT reduce the glare at all."
2.0,"The product was as advertised, I guess.  The sizes were very confusing in the information.  They are very small and I couldn’t get one through one of my ear lobes and ended up bending it.  I suggest buying this product in person so you can see what you are getting.  Money down the drain."
2.0,"Great concept, but product arrived with hole in the pocket. It would make sense if the hole was on the side with the hidden cell phone slot, but in this case it appears to be a manufacturing defect.<br /><br />I gave two stars because I can still wear the shorts, it’s just an inconvenience to have a pocket I can’t use."
2.0,Although the skirt is beautiful it is cut really small - the one size fit all will fit no larger than a size 8 and it is not long but comes just above the knee
2.0,One was broken upon receipt.  Very cheaply made and had no backing for protection.
2.0,"Jump suit was cool, didnt feel cheap but my big issue was that with a small tug it started falling apart at the seams which tells me they are poorly put together."
2.0,The seal was not good and we returned the item
2.0,"I like the design, but the waist/tummy area is WAY tighter than the top, so it's going back. If you hold weight in your mid section this might not work for you. Definitely doesn't come down over the bottom either. The flowers are not very secure on the elbow area either... you would have to hand wash to be safe."
2.0,"They were super slippery at first(i nearly fell on the ice on my porch and DID fall on it at work). I initially thought that I just needed to break them in, but they still, after a month and change, hurt my feet. They are a nightmare to get on because they don't lace/unlace easily and the tongue doesn't pull out well. I have to fight with my insoles shifting constantly. And, most frustratingingly, the fabric on the inside is already wearing out. They're cute, and they are waterproof, but that's about it"
2.0,Cute but clasp broke day 1. Very cheap feeling material. Took the two decorations off broken bracket to repurpose.
2.0,"Beautifully made, but the cups are extremely small and it appears that this is made for a very slim person but the band is the only thing that is increased in length.  i ordered a larger size 36 thinking the cup would be larger too... not the case! It looks strange to have a larger band but the cups are tiny and not even spaced further apart to accommodate a larger/wider chest. I normally wear a 34/D or 36/C."
2.0,I like this earrings a lot! But the stem on them is too fragile and cheap. The stem literally fell off of one of mine after only 2 months.
2.0,"Small fit, flimsy fabric"
2.0,"When I received this dress, I was very excited. I love this kind of dress, and I knew it would fit perfectly as per measurements. I even went to the trouble of measuring myself-and the top was going to be, as stated in the measurements, 1-2 inches to large on top. No big deal, I thought. besides, it comes with a fabric-like belt, anyways. so I opened the packaging and tried it on over a camisole. it was very baggy on top, and the armpits were gappy. the rest of it fit like a glove, but there was no fixing the top unless you cut 3-4 inches of fabric off the side and sewed it back together. the fabric dress was well made and beautiful, and it flared out as shown in the picture. the zipper kept getting stuck, though. I was very disappointed. I am not going to go to the trouble of returning it. not really worth the $$30$$. I just hope it will fit me in a year or two."
2.0,Very thin. Was disappointed
2.0,"I usually wear a 34B/C. I ordered a medium based on the fact that the sizing information listed all “band” sizes essentially the same, but I know from experience that bralette cups tend to run small. I was probably correct about that last part with this one. The cups were just the right size, but the lace “band” was huge. It says that it fits “under bust” measurements of 26-32”. My under bust measurement is 29”, and it was way too large around. I could pinch an extra couple of inches of the fabric without even stretching it. Which, for the record, is not even very stretchy. It had minimal elasticity. It probably fits an under bust of at least 30” or so and up, but definitely too large around for anything smaller."
2.0,"These did not feel light, thin, or cooling.  They are well made, but definitely not cooling."
2.0,Too small for engineer boots
2.0,The color is great and the design. Unfortunately I have long arms and it is hard to find tops where the sleeves touch my wrists. This is a cute and versatile piece.  Just wish the sleeves were longer.
2.0,Did not state that it runs small super small supposed to fit your muscles your tone fits like a women sweater
2.0,"Quality is ok, but I'm having so much trouble with the clasp. It's really difficult to use. Once I'm able to actually get this necklace on, it looks just fine. But it really and truly is so hard getting this necklace on that I hardly ever wear the necklace, which is a shame, because I bought it specifically to use with a lovely necklace charm; but it's just not working out."
2.0,"It was cute, but the bust wasn't quite bug enough."
2.0,"These slippers are soft and have a cushy insole. I ordered a women’s size 10.5-11. These are two inches longer than my foot. There is no size in the slippers or on the sole, which is strange.  The package label shows the correct size. I think the wrong size slippers were put in the bag.  Not having a size in these makes packing them correctly a problem.  Had they been the correct size, they would have been comfortable.<br /><br />The slippers felt cushiony and the sole was soft. They would be warm for winter weather. Other than the size issue, the slippers are nice."
2.0,I was very disappointed they do not look like the picture..too small & not very shinny.
2.0,"This is a beautiful dress, but some of the sequences are silver instead of red. The dress is way too big. I ordered a 7/8 and she wears a size 10."
2.0,I'm 5'9 and this dress came down to about 2-3 inches above my ankles. It also doesn't look too good once it's on.
2.0,"All Jama Old West brand boots are marked specifically for the type of toe they have and if it's for ladies, mens or childrens sizes. &#34;BSL&#34; which you say in your listing description is for Broad square ladies. But you claim these are childrens size 10. This is very misleading. If these are infact childrens size 10 it should say BSC for broad square child."
2.0,DO NOT BUY. I had this for now week and wore it only about 2 days and then it broke. It was very pretty and felt nice but the string was already on its last legs when it came
2.0,They are not transition nor are they photochromatic. I like the color though.
2.0,"It would’ve been nice if the touchscreen feature worked as described. However, it does not. The gloves are warm and I like the style but I don’t like being deceived. Therefore, I am only giving two stars in this review."
2.0,"way too big, the sizing is way off. Pretty colors."
2.0,I bought these to wear to Harry Potter world at universal and decided to wear them a few time before that. I got caught in some rain and they got wet and the color turned when they dried. Tried to polish them up and bent them 😞 they’re super cute just don’t get them wet!
2.0,"I really loved this fitting of the bra top and also the cut. Nice and secure, soft fabric etc. Unfortunately the white lining was showing everywhere and I didn't care for that. If you didn't mind, I would say go for it!"
2.0,Cap is very tight for any child. I had to alter it to make it fit. Do not recommend
2.0,"It’s a cute design, but it’s not T-shirt material. It’s very thin and cheaply made. Very disappointed"
2.0,"Only wore the item once, however it was as described although quite questionable on the durability side.  As I stated, I only wore this once and if I wanted to wear it again I wouldn't be able to because the fabric tore in several places during the one event I wore the item."
2.0,Material is too thin almost paper like. I felt like a helium balloon.
2.0,"i'm not certain these are real Lokai...they feel different than the authentic ones, and the clear one broke the first time it was worn. VERY DISSAPPOINTED with this purchase"
2.0,"I really wanted to be able to love this dress.  I was able to purchase it for 1/2 price,it arrived sooner than expected, the material felt great and it even has pockets!!!  BUT...  it was huge!!!  It looked more like a circus tent then a maxi dress.  Not flattering at all.  I ordered by the size chart the seller provided.  If anything the dress should have been a little tight in the bust area.  The seam that should have been just under my bust went all the way down to my waist.  The arm holes are huge and show off my bra.  The dress is NOT racerback.  (Honestly, I prefer it not to be a racerback, so that was a plus for me).  The length was longer than stated. I ordered an XL.  It should have been 56.3” long and mine was 58”.  Please see my photos for all the issues I have just mentioned.  I contacted the seller and they said to send it back and “please order again with the right size”.  It almost sounded like I made the mistake.  I double checked my measurements and their chart.  I ordered correctly the first time.  If I was to reorder I would order a M.  I think that a M would have fit properly.  But I will not be reordering for 2 reasons.  1.  It cost me $3.33 to return it.  It is not a free return item.  However the seller did rembuise the cost.  I doubt they’d do that a second time.  2. Even though I was able to purchase it for a discount the first time, I wouldn’t be able to the second.  I was told the code is “only use for one time for one customer”.  I am still the same customer and it didn’t work out the first time.  I liked the dress, but it didn’t work for me.  It may work for you but I recommend caution when purchasing."
2.0,This belt looks like it would fit a child not an adult. Very disappointed.
2.0,The fabric is so see-through that a slip is not even going to help. It looks adorable on the model but I am definitely sending this one back.
2.0,"Dress was too narrow on bust, narrow on waist and then it flared out tremendously.  Didn't like the fit at all so returned the item."
2.0,"Updated review: Husband loved the belts initially, however belts crack within 6 to 12 months. I ordered him 3 belts, all by Chaoren. One actually broke in two."
2.0,"It's not that it's too large there's just no support, no compression so what's the point."
2.0,"I should have paid attention to the reviews I read before buying it. It has been less than two months since I made this purchase, and the ring is now turning YELLOW, confirming that the materials are cheap and poor quality"
2.0,Very cute and fit well but the material was see-through so I had to return it.
2.0,"FIRST TIME I USED IT, THE GROMMETS STARTED POPPING OUT<br />DON'T BUY THIS BELT"
2.0,Poor look - does not look like quality product!
2.0,The embroidery is actually an iron on. My floral patch was lifting in the corners. I donated my top to charity.
2.0,"I loved the picture on the mask but it's huge and the pocket for the filter is so small that with a filter in it doesn't cover your nose, just your mouth. Totally disappointed."
2.0,"This hardly holds your shirt in place. After moving around normally, the shirt will still be pulled and this belt will also be exposed for all to see. I recommend wearing suspenders while using this because they will at least keep your pants up enough to hide this underbelt. I give this 2 stars because it is slightly better than if you had nothing to keep your shirt down and tucked."
2.0,Love the design but definitely a cheap and poorly made mask. One of them has an actual hair sewn into the part the would touch your face. 🤮 Only 1 of the 4 that I received looked decent. The other 2 had the metal nose piece not sewn in good at all. Very disappointed with this purchase.
2.0,One of the ropes broke off after one month of use. Got them repaired for $50 and the frames are only $40 here on Amazon. They are starting to deteriorate in other places along the ropes. Most likely will eventually break in those places as well. Not happy with the quality.
2.0,"the print on this shirt is so cute<br />the fabric was very disappointing<br />false advertising, was listed as a sweat shirt<br />received cheap polyester fabric"
2.0,Colors are cute.  Sized way too small.  I ordered a large I typically wear a medium.  My b cup ladies fall out the bottom of the top and the leg holes in the bottoms cut into my legs.  Too bad it would be cute if it was cut properly.
2.0,"The inner purse/crossbody I like, but the main purse is just ok.  There are no inside pockets what so ever and the straps keep getting tangled up it's pretty annoying I have to adjust them a lot."
2.0,A tad too thin to wear alone and not designed to be work on top of anything.
2.0,"I absolutely wanted to love this dress. After reading the reviews, I intentionally ordered a size up in hopes that it wouldn't cling to me. Unfortunately, it showed every flaw, even though it was loose fitting, due to the type of material. I was so disappointed that I had to return it."
2.0,"Very very very cheaply made. Strings hanging and the black runs off on the toes with just indoor wear. My daughter does love them still but for the price, I expected better quality than that."
2.0,"It does the job, but feels like it is wearing out way to fast I've only had it less than a month and one of the holes is already worn out"
2.0,Not at all what I expected.  Looks like a baggy sweater in the picture but it's not at all. And it is shiny material cheap looking...
2.0,Material had a smell
2.0,The bad was poorly constructed and too small. I opened the package and immediately sent I back...
2.0,It’s small for me
2.0,Very small<br />Made for kid fingers
2.0,I'm a bigger girl but this was to big and the feel of the dress was off.. Spandex is the best way to putt it but even that isn't right
2.0,Pretty gloves but low quality. Snagged almost immediately after putting them on. They will last a total of 1 wear.
2.0,Loved color keep falling down. Measured myself but still too. Ig
2.0,Ok but not very heart shaped
2.0,I received this product two months ago and came back to write a review because its now falling apart. I go days without touching my cards so this will probably last a daily user a few weeks
2.0,This doesn't fit well around the boob area. It's too big. I was very disappointed.
2.0,"I bought this ""nicer"" silicone band after the one that came with my watch broke.  This one is thick and therefore less comfortable, but I thought that would at least mean it was more durable, but it broke after only a little over 2 months of wear (and I take it off at night)."
2.0,"Idk If I have a big head or hot but this was a squeeze to put on and not enjoyable, girlfriend likes it tho so I guess it wasn’t a total loss."
2.0,"I ordered a black pair, recieved white cheap looking ones. They flashed but wasn't comfortable"
2.0,Absolutely beautiful but way too small even after sizing up.  The 2xl was more like a large.
2.0,I normally wear a medium and i sized up to a large. The large fits like an extra small. It’s SO small. Definitely returning. Wish they had a bigger size
2.0,Very cute and my daughter loved it but the zipper got stuck and then broke after the second time she wore it. Very disappointing considering the cost. I’ve bought far less expensive items that have lasted much longer. She really wants a new one but I can’t justify the cost and risk it’s breaks again.
2.0,"It is not like the picture, it is very short and that spoils the look"
2.0,Don't bother buying. Not as expected.
2.0,"The picture for the orange shirt shows a colorful sun/moon, and was part of why I chose it. What came was just a white outline, and a different design."
2.0,That quality doesn’t last long
2.0,Fits small not the greatest. But worth the price
2.0,Not what I expected at all. Very small.
2.0,"The design was cute but the material was polyester. I ordered a size down but that was still too big. I ordered a Medium (even though I order Large most of the time), but I should have ordered a Small. I am 5'5 38D. I just asked for a refund instead..."
2.0,"Almost broke my glasses attempting to ""Jimmy"" as they describe as the best way to put onto your glasses. Garbage. Will never use them"
2.0,"I gave 2 two stars because only 2 are wearable.  The other two were so tight at the top I had to cut a slit in them in order to pull them above my calf.  They are above the knee, warm and very light weight.  I would not buy them again."
2.0,"I really liked these, used them a couple times a week for two months straight but then they developed holes (that went from small to massive quickly) in the balls of the feet. If they would reinforce the bottoms, these would be a fantastic product. I enjoyed the merino wool because my feet didn’t get sweaty/stinky. Just bummed that they got big holes so quickly that they were no longer usable and I had to discard them."
2.0,Nice but super large...
2.0,The fit seems to be pretty poor. The elastic is so stretchy that your foot slides around in them. I probably should have returned but didn't want to mess with it.
2.0,Ordered a medium and it looks super small and dirty
2.0,This is a beautiful set but sizing not accurate. The top is for very small chest. The bottoms fit a little smaller than a medium but a large would have been too big.<br /><br />I am 5’3 137 36d so I knew the top would be small but I was going to give away and keep bottoms if they worked but deciding to return the set since the sizing is off.  I really wished it fit right the color is amazing.
2.0,"In defense of the dress, it is cute and has a lining.  If you follow their sizing guide, it will probably fit but the sizing is unique to the manufacturer.  I'm returning it because the back zipper sticks and feels flimsy.  You will need to tug it from behind to get it through the seam, and the zipper doesn't feel sturdy enough for repeated tugging. Also, the metallic looking buttons are poorly sewn. They are shank buttons, not flat ones, and they already look floppy and dangly on the new dress.  After a few washes, they are going to come off.  Even at the sale price, this dress feels cheap."
2.0,My son wore it for a few minutes. He couldn't stand the texture of the shirt so he refuses to wear it again. It fit really loosely around the arms and neck holes.
2.0,Loved these glasses but broke for no reason
2.0,The cheap paint job is coming off after 2 weeks... not acceptable at all. May as well not even paint it if it's not done right to begin with. I'd return but not worth having to pack and drive to drop off. Another wasted purchase.
2.0,"Hello there, I ordered the product a couple days ago, and the beads fell off in my first shower with it on. Do I have to purchase a new one?"
2.0,"I am typically a small or medium in tops. I got the small, it feels like a large. Also it’s very thick and not breathable for working out. Maybe more of a day to day top"
2.0,"Small and the fabric is made of like, kids Halloween costume stretchy fabric. For the price I guess it's OK, but it's see thru and cheap. There's no front or back, or tag..."
2.0,Bug eyes! Is what my teenagers said when I showed them my pretty purple over sunglasses. I asked if its better than clip one & both said no. Sadly returning them even though the dark grey lens & purple marbled frame is very attractive - just not on my face.  My large prescription glasses tightly fit inside which might damage the frames over time if I kept it.
2.0,"Pros: good length, cool design<br /><br />Cons: cheap chain, metal looks cheap, too shiny<br /><br />I bought 4 pieces of jewelry from this company and they all share the same flaw: they look incredibly cheap in person, practically costume jewelry. If that's what you're into, then you will love these, but I was hoping this necklace would be silver, not chrome."
2.0,"The quality of the dress was good and sizing is accurate, but there were 2 major reasons for me returning it. 1, the bell sleeves cinched the forearm tight so that it was uncomfortable. 2, the dress itself is extremely boxy with no shape. The belt is supposed to give the desired cinching at the waist. However the belt is much smaller than it appears in the image and looks like I just tied something around as a second thought."
2.0,"This cosplay was terrible. I was already expecting it to be cheap as I just needed one that came fast, but it was even worse in person. The material is terrible & the top “jacket” doesn’t even open it’s just got a decorative collar. XXL is far from the truth as well. Typically I fit just a XL but this was a tight medium at best."
2.0,Did not stay up on leg.<br />Both size and elasticity seem to be the problem
2.0,"I loved this bag, but after only a month and a half of using it, the zipper broke. I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,"I wore them one time, but never again.  Not at all comfortable.  They look nice, but appearance isn't everything.  Buy something else."
2.0,Not what i expected greately disappointing
2.0,"Doesn’t really change color, you can’t really tell, it like just darkens the pink it doesn’t change into purple… kinda disappointing."
2.0,"This set its cheap looking. The picture is better. The red color is sloppy and bleeds onto the silver. Its like, the company didn't care about how this one looked."
2.0,"The pendant itself wasn’t bad, the chain however so cheap and awful rusted over just from being worn. I was embarrassed to wear it after a couple of days."
2.0,The material is very thin and cheap quality. I would not recommend this dresss for a formal event.
2.0,"Don't purchase if you plan on wearing this by itself. These are very cheaply made, short in the torso area (hit about 2 inches above waist line). But if you plan on wearing these under a nice suit jacket and do not plan on removing the jacket - go for it. They are beautiful colors are very sheer but just don't work for me to wear by itself. Also - size up. I was very disappointed since they are pretty but returned mine."
2.0,"Unlike other products similar to this, the &#34;notch&#34; isn't very deep and my girlfriend keeps experiencing her headband coming off the jewelry"
2.0,"This is my third pair, except others were black, same size. Think maybe these were mis-marked, they’re about a size too big?"
2.0,"Very thin material, and crudely sewn. Pretty, but not a circle skirt. Looks like the type of garment that will become faded and look like crumpled up paper after one wash; though I've yet to attempt to do so. Fits as expected, but longer than I'd anticipated based on dimensions provided."
2.0,"I wear a medium in all my athletic shorts/pants, but maybe I'm a &#34;large medium.&#34; 40&#34; hips, 22&#34; thighs. These shorts are already pretty short, but they ride up quite a bit.  I purchased these in the Volt color because they looked so awesome online...  The color is definitely bright, and I love bright things.  However, they are semi-transparent- my undies are visible through these.  I ended up having to wear them over my Under Armour compression shorts, which are not friggin' see-through and better than these Nike Pro shorts.  These shorts also shrank a bit in the dryer, and I think they might be unwearable now.  Yeah, I know, I KNOW, you are supposed to be nice to your athletic wear and not put them in the dryer at all, or not very long.  However, I can beat the hell out of my UA shorts at the gym and with the clothes dryer, and they still look awesome.  I'll be going back to UA for my next shorts purchase."
2.0,"The shirt was very cute, with a nice pink color but sized way too small."
2.0,Looks halfway decent other than the fact that I received a damaged mask with a white spot the size of a quarter on the cheek with no green paint on it and it has creases in the face from being folded in packaging.
2.0,threading started falling apart after first wash
2.0,Not at all oversize like the post said!! Very disappointed!
2.0,To shot
2.0,"The product looks well made and I was eager to use it. I am taking a flight to Europe that requires luggage no bigger than 55 x 40 x 20 in centimeters or roughly 21 1/2 x 15 3/4 x 7 3/4 inches. The description says that this is 20 x 15  x 4 inches.<br /><br />However, this product is about 8 5/8 inches (22 cm) deep. This is definitely not the 4&#34; advertised.<br /><br />This is disappointing and frustrating since it is so hard to find luggage that meets the strict size requirements. I  don't know if this product would be accepted or not, but I can't take the chance.<br /><br />Perhaps it is the manufacturer and not the seller that is providing incorrect information. Either way, if the seller would correct this mistake, I would be happy to change this to a more favorable rating."
2.0,"I bought two kitten necklaces because of the good rating. When I receive the necklace, one of them was visibly in better shape than the other. The better one is in a cleaner package. It has fewer spots and the colors are better. The other kitten has many small defects. Parts of the necklace have rusted. I tried to wipe it clean  to get the dusts and particles off but some spots are are permanent and it has lost its shine. I'm rather disappointed. It doesn't look like the one on the picture."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this shirt…but it runs small, the material shows sweat easily and the fit is weird. Overall I love AmelieBoutiq clothes but this one just didn’t work out.<br />If you’re going to give it a try, order two sizes up, wear a padded bra, and don’t wear it somewhere that you will sweat.<br />I’m 5’7” and 170 lbs and the XL is too tight and not very flattering."
2.0,Unfortunately they look really ragged after one pool use.
2.0,"Buyer warning, Do not put any kind of tension when tying straps. Loved it at first very comfortable, until I tied the straps and this happened. (See photo) I already sewn the left side before thought of taking photo. Again like the shirt but definitely NOT worth price."
2.0,i returned. it was cute but i didnt like the rings on the side of the sleeves. they were metal and heavy. should just be a button to hold the sleeves up.
2.0,"I had to return this coat because the material of the jacket itself felt like something you would use as a saddle blanket for a horse.  Coarse does not do it justice.  Honestly, I think prison inmates have better quality clothes."
2.0,"In just 2 weeks, one of the rhinestones fell out. Still works better than the &#34;Steering Wheel&#34; version!"
2.0,"The material was not what I was expecting.<br />It is more jersey like, I would recommend sizing up.<br />I am a size medium in dresses, and should have probably gotten a large.<br />Returned it."
2.0,"Cheaply made, and the cuffs stretch to ruined the first time I tried them on. Not worth the money."
2.0,The fingers are way too long; these are not a standard medium.
2.0,It is not what I thought it would be. I will look for something more to my needs.
2.0,"Suction cups don’t work very well unfortunately, kept falling off mirror (clean mirror)."
2.0,"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing.<br />The graphic was disappointing, there was glitter on the gold bit, but the pink dripping bit had nothing so does not look as good as in the advert.<br />Id look for another print before getting this or something from the same supplier again."
2.0,To Expensive
2.0,Sucks I have bald head so this is useless for my head . It slips off imediately. It does warm your ear for a second then you have to adjust it every 5 seconds . Don't waste your money on this thing it sucks.
2.0,"I love the concept, but when I finally went to wear the gold ones they were identical. So I have 2 earings for one ear and it looks stupid that way. Silver pair was fine, but I will say my only complaint is the backs are a bit loose."
2.0,Cute... but WAYYYY smaller than expected.  I typically wear a 1X... ordered a 2X... it is closer to a L :-(
2.0,They were too small for a grown man
2.0,Necklace fell apart within days.
2.0,Get a bigger size. Runs small.
2.0,Super awkward/tight fit around the belly. Missed the return window and will likely only wear around the house.
2.0,Wasn't as slouchy as the picture and title
2.0,"The under of the bra was super to long and uncomfortable. Ran small, way too much padding for my taste. Never wore again."
2.0,"My wife's review:<br /><br />Although advertised as a tee shirt style dress with an elastic high waistline, it is actually a baggy dress with ruffles that would serve better as a nightgown. I thought this dress would be perfect for work, but it truly is too unflattering to wear outside of the house. Although the price is right at $29.99, the look and fit isn't. It's a thumbs-down for me on this one!"
2.0,Cute but returned. Didn't look good on me.
2.0,Me parece que el tipo de tela usada para hacer estas mangas no es el adecuado muy débil el tipo de tele
2.0,I think Hi may be missing a few straps
2.0,"Cheap material, poor fit, returned."
2.0,"This sock stretches out a lot after wearing for just a short time.  Plus, it is slightly uncomfortable on the bottom of my feet when I walk.  Disappointed because these are cute."
2.0,Very large and goddy item.  Cheap made
2.0,"If you have a chest larger than a B or C don't get this dress!  It runs EXTREMELY SMALL.<br />I bought an XL and I am a size 16 with DD chest - it doesn't even come close to fitting me.  I would say the XL is really a more like a Medium.  I am not paying to return it so it will be gifted to one of my much smaller friends.  Other than that, the print and material are great."
2.0,I loved the necklace  but it brakes very easily
2.0,"Very disappointed when I opened the package and the sweatshirt looked nothing like the picture. The picture shows a dark gray, distressed look and mine was light gray and looked like a regular sweatshirt. Not happy with this product."
2.0,"The dress is cute, although I’m almost certain it’s see-through. BUT, there’s chest space. It’s flat and would probably only work for women who are flatter in the chest area."
2.0,"I love the pants but unfortunately, the zipper doesn't stay up.  They have been washed and worn twice so I'm unable to return them :("
2.0,"I liked the comfort and length of the shirt. Great for leggings. Unfortunately, the bottom hem was uneven which makes the shirt shifted to one side"
2.0,The shirt itself is very nice and the color pattern is great.  The problem is I ordered an X-Large and it doesn't even come close to buttoning.  Now I have a beautiful shirt to put in my closet and look at.  I doubt this would fit an extra large child!!
2.0,Like them but the clamps to get them on and off hard i will try for two weeks if its too much of a hassel will return
2.0,I’m disappointed as I was expecting a wine/maroon colored shirt and received a red shirt instead :(
2.0,They fit well but the colors are in dots which can obstruct your view. They gave me a headache.
2.0,These are made with a fleece lining that is very heavy and thick. These would almost be good for wearing outside in the winter except they are not waterproof. If you get cold easily  these are for you.
2.0,Poor quality.  The silver decorations fell off at my event. Kinda embarrassing
2.0,I always follow the size charts b/c I'm hard to fit.  This was big and really just unattractive on.  May be best for someone who is taller and thinner (I'm 5'3 and a size 14).  Good luck!
2.0,Kinda small for my ear.
2.0,The shoe is not comfortable. There is no support.
2.0,Sunglasses looks great when they came one lens was missing so I was disappointed
2.0,"UPDATE 8/9/16<br />The zipper for the inner pocket broke. BTW it still smells.<br /><br />This wallet should get 5 stars BUT when it arrived, it smelled horrible. I left it out for days to air it out. Even now, there is still a bit of a smell. I googled what it could be and some sites said it was leftover from the tanning process. You can buy leather soap to really get it out but I'm too lazy for that.<br />The functionality of this wallet is amazing. It can hold all my cards, ID, money, change AND I get my phone in there and it snaps closed.<br />I like this wallet.<br />I would have loved it if not for the smell"
2.0,The wands arrived with one of them broken.  Unfortunately I needed six for my daughter's party so she ended up not getting one.  The ones that were unbroken were okay.  The feathers were kind of falling apart but the girls seemed to like them.
2.0,I returned.  It was kinda junkie.
2.0,"Not worth it if you ask me. I bought it and it came a bit earlier than suspected which was nice. When I opened the package, it had emitted a horrendous odor, which left me shocked. The packaging was well done- however, the product itself was so-so. I had gotten a size up than usual, yet it still seemed a bit tight. The rings that came along fell apart as soon as I opened the bag. They look nothing like Hu Tao's rings which left me disappointed. I had bought this a month before, and the description said that there was a red shirt, but then edited it to a collar AFTER I bought it. The socks were okay, but the red straps were absolutely off the grid. It was so tight, and I have rather slim legs. The hat was really floppy and the little label on the hat was a PIN. And don't get me started on how horrible the actual cosplay was. Most of it WAS HOT GLUED? Unexceptable. Looking back at the photos, It was nothing like the actual thing. The accessories were also just hot glued together and pins. It left me extremely upset, but I am willing to buy another one and return this. I hope the seller can fix this mistake because I don't want to have to refund my money."
2.0,The material was unimpressive and underwhelming
2.0,"I bought these as sleep shirts, so they'll do, but they are very cheaply made and not at all flattering. They fit ok (maybe run a little large). However, the fabric is cut unevenly so the sides of the shirt do not hang at the same length. When they are washed, they shrink up but not in, so they become short and wide. The fabric is very thin and doesn't lay well at the collar or around the pockets. Ultimately, it just puckers in odd places and hangs frumpily. Again, they're sleep shirts so they'll function, but I won't be buying these again."
2.0,I did NOT take out of package so I can only comment on color.  I needed white.  It was listed as white.  However it is off white.  I had to return.
2.0,"The material is itchy, the seams are scratchy, and the arm hole is irritatingly tight with a thin elastic band, so that it’s guaranteed to cut off circulation on someone with a little arm fat or muscle, while simultaneously driving you crazy with how painfully scratchy that seam is. The thumb hole is slightly too small for comfort (and I have pretty small hands). It almost feels like the ends of the fabric simply had glue or nail polish put on them to keep from unraveling, which effectively makes the edges very scratchy—not something you want to feel on the sensitive skin of the inside of your elbow or on the web of skin on your hand between thumb and forefinger. The sleeve is roomy around the wrist, however, so it’s comfortable to move my hand around, and the band going across the palm is not too tight, either.<br />Basically, this gets stars removed for fit, material, and edge/seams."
2.0,"Ok the bracelet looks nice but i made a mistake , i didnt measure my wrist to know what size should i get but when i realize that i went back to see if i can change it for my size , well ot doesnt give you more options so if you are fat or bulki then its right you but for me was a waste of money"
2.0,"I don't like it...the color is pretty but I'm a medium, I bought medium size and when I got it, the arms were too tight and the dress fit as if it was size large....totally hate it"
2.0,Love this but beware the drawstring is for looks only. It doesn’t cinch up or loosen at all.
2.0,Not super helpful!
2.0,Sewed thread and the buttons were off-center and there were plastic tag holders everywhere on the shorts that I had to cut off. Not ideal for a gift.
2.0,Doesn't fit on the ear well.
2.0,Charm looked good when I purchased it. The charm broke off and I ended up losing it.
2.0,The dress was really pretty. It was comfortable and fit amazing. My issue was that it was too transparent. Whether I write stuff underneath or not you can tell right away.
2.0,Beautiful pin. Broke the 1st time I tried to pin it to my blouse.
2.0,"Tail looks nice but it’s ridiculous to sell it attached to a satin ribbon & expect anyone to wear it that way. It’s heavy, so it pulls on the ribbon & if you are wearing anything that doesn’t cover the ribbon, like a dress, you can see it the entire time.<br />There aren’t any instructions or hints on how else to attach or wear it.<br />The “ears” clips, fall out almost immediately. They are crappy quality clips, although the ears themselves look nice.<br />Good looking product with poor application is useless."
2.0,"Because of the way it was constructed, the lanyard was splitting open and didn't look nice very quickly"
2.0,Too small-- too narrow
2.0,"Fabric is see through, doesn't show in picture"
2.0,looks cheap in person. not impressed. Also made for a taller person.
2.0,"The buckle scratches WAY too easily.  This is after only a few days of wear, and I can't even explain WHY it scratched."
2.0,"Super cute, but arrived hopelessly tangled. We had to give it as a gift immediately and didn't have time to fix it, so am hopeful our friends can sort it out."
2.0,difficult to get on is an understatement  run small bought a large for my husband would not go over his heel
2.0,Not long enough to be considered pant length but too long to be a capris...just weird cut overall. Returned them.
2.0,The charger area broke shortly after arrival
2.0,Fabric mostly rayon which wrinkles & requires ironing.
2.0,"Build quality was not so great for the item we got.  We used this on a trip to Europe for carting stuff around town for shopping.  Well about a week in, it starter to fray around the zipper area and the that fray started to get caught in the zipper a lot, to a point we stopped using it because of the annoyance factor."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this top. I've been looking for a nice white blouse for work. This one is not what you see in the photo. It sits like a tent. I even got a small. I'm 5'3"" 130 lbs. I'm assuming by other reviews that this company does not always ship the the same style. Some fit, some do not. Some are short, some are longer. Only think I liked was the light weight chiffon but That's not what the photo looks like. I thought it was supposed to be more form fitting. I'm returning. Disappointed :("
2.0,You get what you pay for! It was cute while it lasted
2.0,"It is very compressing and cute, but way too small. I ordered an xl, following the size chart, and it was TIGHT. Not comfortable for working out or lounging. Would size up if you can..... update: trying on the bra makes you ineligible for returns. BUYER BEWARE."
2.0,Loved them... gave them a 3 star because from the sides you can sort of see how they're not sowed to<br />good. Overall very comfortable and true to size.<br /><br />UPDATED REVIEW:<br />These didn't last long at all. Went from 3 starts to 2. Waist of money
2.0,Was bent when delivered.
2.0,"This product was buttery smooth but way too thin, you could see right through them as I took a step. I returned these because they would not have functioned properly in the gym or anywhere in public!"
2.0,Belt too small doesn't look good
2.0,Bought size 9. Was way to small. Gave them away. If they had shrunk they would of been todler socks.
2.0,Socks were thinner than expected.
2.0,"Was super excited about this potentially attractive shirt until I received it today.  The style idea is trendy, and would make a great addition to one's wardrobe, but the sleeves are not sized properly.  The shirt looked great on me, except for the arms.  The sleeves are just way too small.  (My arms are average size).  You cannot tell from the image, but the fabric is not a smooth or soft polyester, it is textured, and is more on the sheer side.  The color is true mustard.  It is still a nice shirt, but only for those with very slender arms"
2.0,"Have lots of these sweats. My go to. I'm old small guy. 5'7&#34; 118 lbs. In small these always fit and felt great, but this most recent one is way to large and long. Think label wrong. Small size maybe put on large sweatshirt."
2.0,cheap look and feel and it doesn't come with hooks on the sides to snap the longer strap into place.
2.0,I have  burgundy 3/4 sleeve version of this exact same brand and love it. I ordered the long sleeve in gray In the exact same size and it arrived looking like an muted olive green and did not fit at all like the other one I bought. I ended up returning it.  The front did not fall as shown in the picture at all.
2.0,First time I washed the dress it bled all over other clothings and on it self. The top is now pink instead of white.
2.0,Items were very thin and feel like they wont last long. :-( and they were so cute.
2.0,The bracelet is super cute but after 1 week wearing it started to tarnish. I don't shower with it and take really good care but even that did not avoid the tarnish. The charms are still good. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Pretty but runs small, sending it back"
2.0,[[VIDEOID:4643891382bfe51832aecc5f929e8d3]]
2.0,the color is a wierd reddish orange and do not like the quality of the material.
2.0,they are not true to size they run very big
2.0,Although the material was great the jacket was cheaply made. The buttons fell right away
2.0,Bigger than expected- product description stated it would fit as a daith- it did not- too big
2.0,These were pretty but cheap imitations. They felt like $12 glasses from the pharmacy
2.0,"Poor quality. Some clips won't close, others won't open. Leaves black residue on the fingers. The clips fall off the bracelet because they don't close well - I lost one. From the whole bunch, maybe there were one or two that work.<br /><br />Cheap and poor quality product.<br /><br />I gave it a second star because it includes  rubber rings that I use with other clips."
2.0,The gold tone wore off within 2 weeks.
2.0,"Sizing is way off , I'm usually a size medium for tops and I'm a 32c for bust size. The medium fit like a small and it literally is tight for the neck. The material feels itchy and uncomfortable.  It just feel tacky and very misleading with the sizing and the material."
2.0,I gave it to my mom...
2.0,"These come up very, very high. More than the photos suggest. And then there is an approx 3 inch band that is tight. Otherwise, there is no ""tummy control."" It will be tight around your ribs and no where else."
2.0,don't waste your money.
2.0,I like the size of the hoop earrings but back closing area is very hard to close
2.0,"This is SUPERRRR thin. It would be cute as lingerie or on a smaller chested girl that’s not worried about her nipples being noticeable. On the 32DD, I’m not wearing this in public LOL. It’s cute though."
2.0,Bag is way to small nothing like the dementions maybe be good for a concert or a night out but barely fits my wallet and on one side I can see through the stitching
2.0,"1/2 of these buckles have whistles that are closed up. They can't be blown. When I had them seems me replacements, they still had half of them sealed up. Not really a great product."
2.0,Not for big boobs and definitely runs small
2.0,"This is a shirt, not a sweatshirt. If you want something warm, keep searching for something else. Also, the  arm length definitely runs short, even though the body length runs true to size."
2.0,Cheap item broke after 1 week
2.0,The zone of the pins are TO THICK and doesn't fit to my Coros Pace2: even in an AmazFit GTS it is VERY TIGHT since it rubs the edge of the watch case.<br /><br />The material is superb.
2.0,"Cute top- no stretch, fit everywhere but in the bust. Had to return."
2.0,I ordered a small and it fits like a large. :(<br />Its good quality made though but clips in the back like a bathing suit.
2.0,It would look great if the breast cups fit properly and I'm only a 38C and had ordered the xl.
2.0,not very good material but wearable
2.0,The card holders are to hard to fit the cards in sent back
2.0,"The fit is tight, I tried other prints of the same tunic dress, in the same brand and it fit right.<br />So, the fit changes from print to print."
2.0,"Not what I received. I received what looks like a child's backpack with backpack-style shoulder straps. It has the face on it and the materials are reasonable quality, but this is not a purse."
2.0,Nice for a few wears. It’s thin and not sturdy.
2.0,No good for me- looked worse than not using them at all- just too light and too obvious.
2.0,"While the fabric is nice, the fit is very odd: the bodice and sleeves are enormous, while the body is narrow, snug and uncomfortable. If you have no hips and a tiny waist and an inverted triangle shaped body, it might work -- but be forewarned that it's not an average fit by any stretch of the imagination. Returned mine."
2.0,Ripped when I pulled the strings together after 3rd use. Probably best if you’re an A or B cup.
2.0,The texture is a bit rough. I prefer a  silky feel.
2.0,"This is NOT a quick release band. It's a standard spring pin that requires your own pins (and tool.) Sure, you get 3 colors and they're decent enough for what they are, but it is not what is described. I would have sent them back, but for the price it just wasn't worth the effort. Says Mens/Womens but there aren't enough holes for a smaller wrist, so it's not great for women."
2.0,"Kept us mostly dry but very flimsy and the sleeves were too small and tight at the wrists. Tore very easily. I guess it was what I paid for, cheap. Kids ones were small for my 8 and 10 year old. Adult ones great for those shorter that 5'8"""
2.0,While they look good they didn't perform for me as pictured in the ad.  They did not reduce glare from night time driving. I had cataract surgery hoping this would solve the problem.  I selected the more expensive glasses as someone commented that the more expensive the better the product.  Now I doubt that information.  They are all probably the same unless purchased at the dollar store.  I guess if they were so great the optometrists would recommend & carry them for their patients. I should have listened to the advice from another customer who said she had tried them all & none of them worked.  Unfortunately I waited too long before attempting to return them so the window for returns closed.  Maybe I can use them for sunglasses?
2.0,"I was excited about receiving and wearing this T-shirt, I like the design and colour of it! However the material is of poor quality and feels as if it is going to stretch out after washing / drying, even though its new it actually looks that way when worn because the size is off - I'm a size small and the T-shirt fits like a medium, but in a weird fit as in the sides are extremely large (it kind of looks like a square when worn)- Simply put this shirt has no shape to it!.  Also the neck is extremely wide and falls off the shoulder - another review warned of this but I thought it wouldn't have been a big deal given that review said it was good quality - Its certainly not!  I felt its a waste of money, I would not recommend!"
2.0,This runs very small and its always a hassle returning to 3rd party sellers as you cannot return through Kohl’s.
2.0,This is the second dress i had bought for the winter to wear with my new boots and i didn't get a chance to wear it at all because of how thin and clingy it is.  my bra and panties show through the dress and even wearing a slip didn't help.  i'm going to keep it and try to find a way to make it work because it's super cute and the color is amazing... it's just THIN
2.0,The lens description should be yellow there os not green tint at all. The wood grain temples are not natural  it is plastic-looking.
2.0,"Great bag, will only get better with age. I have one complaint which is that the main zipper ends in a free dangling piece of leather meant to keep it from coming completely undone. The problem is that, because this is just a dangling end, you cannot zip it closed with one hand; it requires both hands. I will probably sew it in place to correct this problem, I just don't understand why it wasn't done in the first place.<br /><br />UPDATE: Little more than a month later, the lining started unraveling through the edges of the leather. Then the lining unraveled through the inside and had to be glued. Now the grommets (which are actually screws) for the strap have gone missing. Great aesthetic design, very poor construction. Extremely displeased."
2.0,El cocido mal hecho la hebilla mal hecho no hay calidad en el detalle horrible
2.0,"Small was more like a large, good quality tho. Returned."
2.0,Too small for most girls
2.0,Good quality but they were definitely too short!
2.0,I've had this one on my wish list for ages and finally went for it. Pretty disappointed. The dangle chains are stiff - rather than hanging loosely it sticks out in random directions and came with black spots of rust already. Haven't worn it yet to see if it's true that it discolors the skin.
2.0,"They're much bigger than the Rayban 55mm Aviators, so I returned them right away."
2.0,Leaks on Asian face...<br />Perhaps they could have adjustable nose bridge.
2.0,"I really like the way they looked, the cups were nice and really provided support, but like most people I found the band to be uncomfortable. Too tight and the elastic was painful. Returning for a size larger. Hoping it will feel better"
2.0,Started to chip and peel within a week
2.0,I love JMS briefs but this package is differing sizes.  Two pair fit well the other 3 don't.
2.0,"The strap did not work as described.  It was pushing the chin backwards if it is used as described, which is opposite of what it is supposed to do.  It was slipping forward and finally out, if it was being used towards the front of the head.  It definitely did not work for me."
2.0,These socks are nice however they continually fall down throughout my 12 hour shift.
2.0,I think 🤔 it's a little too tight for me I'm 5'2 and over 200 didn't fit my body I brought 2x
2.0,Uncomfortable and cheaply built
2.0,"Not the quality I expected,  but fits as expected!"
2.0,I ended up only using the fabric wig cap and not the latex bald cap because it didn’t look real. It was baggy.
2.0,I could not get my phone in or out
2.0,The dress was too small compared to dresses I purchase at the same size.  I could not button it around my chest and waist.
2.0,Very thin. And short
2.0,"Low quality, long sleeve t-shirt dress basically.  I would not step foot out of the house in this piece.  This is going into my pajama drawer and it will be nice on the cold winter nights.  It's a really low quality tee material.  Already faded looking.  I have nothing positive to say.  I do not recommend."
2.0,"I am 5'6, 165 pounds. My normal size in bottoms is size 10. I ordered two pair of these pants; 1 black pair and 1 white pair, and this is what I've found: The white pair was way too small and had a defective zipper. The black pair was perfect and the zipper wasn't perfect, but it remained intact. The white pair is not high waist but the black pair is. The name brand of both pair was different as well. I ordered both pair in size large. I will be sending the white pants back but I am keeping the black ones. I hope this helps....."
2.0,"So we ordered a 4T two pack, one set was 4T but the other was a mislabeled 3T? Not even sure how this happens. The quality between the 2 sets also differs. The 4T is soft whereas the smaller set is course? Not loving these thermals"
2.0,"The first couple times I wore this, it looked very nice, but it's just not a high quality dress.  Seams began to unravel and the material began to pill; it's good for a few wears, but I'd be surprised if anyone gets more than four or five uses out of it."
2.0,Don't bother measuring. Purchase 2 sizes too large
2.0,Had a bad moldy smell
2.0,"It’s an okay shirt, but size(s) run very small.  The 3X was to be the equivalent of US size Large, but it was more like a US size Small."
2.0,Look nice for the price but very very small.
2.0,"I like that they looked real, but did tangle very easily. I cannot find a tutorial showing how to attach them directly to the front of the head as my hair is parted in middle and the hairs that are too short in front, I cannot attach the extensions to them. The only way would be to use hair spray to keep the hair down seamlessly with the rest of my longer hair. Anyone know of a video that shows EXACTLY how to apply them to the front? I've looked on Youtube with no results.<br />Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated as I can't contact Feshfen directly."
2.0,Nice top but too small
2.0,Item was very soft and comfortable but not flattering at all
2.0,"This does not have adjustable straps so it did not work for me. However, if you are average-sized, this sports bra will be perfect."
2.0,The material is good just that the top is toooo small and the bottom is to big had to pair the top with a different bottom cause it didn’t match
2.0,"This item was too small and I had to return it, but it seemed to be well made."
2.0,Dress fits too small and front piece is too large. Awkward fit.
2.0,This is SHORT and sheer! I'm only 5'2&#34; and I couldn't imagine wearing this without leggings and a tank underneath. There is also no hem on the bottom. I immediately gave it away.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:329e60223ac1fc4abb2fee59749a619b]] The dress was very beautiful but it just came ripped on the side
2.0,"We ordered this mask for Halloween for my son,  it broke  as we unpacked it. It was nice quality just very disappointed it was so brittle."
2.0,"This is a pretty necklace and a nice idea with the small and large beads, however, it tangles so badly while wearing and does not stay in place at all, that it is unwearable.  It's too bad because I liked the look."
2.0,"I love the look of this, but the first time I wore it one of the outer stones fell out. Unfortunately it's very noticeable so I will no longer be wearing this."
2.0,"Nice product but clasp very hard to work with, you need some one to attach for you."
2.0,Frayed and came apart at the shoulder seam in the wash.
2.0,"The led lights that worked were awesome on the dance floor of my wedding reception, sorry to say, less than half the box worked. :("
2.0,"I really liked this set but I would definitely recommend sizing up. I got a small and am 5’2” and the leggings fit me well length wise, but the arms were too short. I am returning because I do not think I will be able to work out in this set. It is really cute, but I was in search of work out clothes."
2.0,Didn't meet my expectation...too small and i thought it would have been more glossy like the pic...
2.0,Meh... Stitching is off. Not the best quality.
2.0,very thin material. not even real good for summer wear because it's so thin the sun N heat just come right through
2.0,crooked. kinda small on face. have a narrow face to begin with.
2.0,"I love the shoes, but sadly they didn't make it very long. When you walk, the shoes faintly light up or glitch on and off. One shoe works fine, but even when totally charged they only last a couple of minutes and they've only been charged three or four times. They are still cute shoes, but once they stop working it's kind of pointless to have a plastic piece hanging out the front that serves no purpose."
2.0,"They are soft, stretchy and look nice on. Button broke off as soon as I put them on. Ordered a larger size and still fit too small. Had high hopes but very disappointed."
2.0,pretty style. it doesn't have a liner in the inside and not true to size.
2.0,"did not care for the material, it rolls"
2.0,Stones are yellow not remotely close to a champagne color. The large stone is not set well. The metal ring is higher quality than I expected.
2.0,Sheds all over my clothes.
2.0,Hard to get on and off.  Look okay but feel light and cheap
2.0,"Update: These broke after a month of use. The plastic frame basically crumbled around the nail. Would not recommend.<br /><br />It’s a sturdy pair of glasses that looks nice with most outfits. Love the tortoise shell. The polarization is not that great compared to my other glasses, so I use this more for fashion than utility."
2.0,These are way too big. Ordered medium and they are like an XL. Really wanted a tighter fit.
2.0,"The battery didn't last long,  but nice watch."
2.0,"did not fit right. material is absorbent, not appropriate for a bathing suit."
2.0,"The hat is a decent size, however it is warped pretty badly. The left side of the bill hangs alot lower than the right and the symbol skews off to one side as well."
2.0,the owl was 3 times the size it appears in the photo
2.0,Sadly they fit a lot larger then you’d think... I got a small and they’re baggy and short length.
2.0,"While the size chart indicated a 2X would fit size 18, the tag inside the dress said 16.  Loved the dress though but that was the largest size.  Had to pick another."
2.0,What I disliked about the purse is that it fell apart within days.  The short handles broke off as well as the long handle a week later.  I'm clasping the purse under my arm while going shopping and this just didn't work for me as much as I attempted to use the beautiful looking purse without handles.  The other zipper pouches are useful and I am finding use for them in my other purses.
2.0,"Runs very small, had to return it"
2.0,"I really love this design. A big flaw is that the slit is too high and you end up revealing everything. I need to use a pin if I want to go out in public. I hope the designer considers a lower slit, I would buy this product again if so. Fabric is not as soft as you would expect, but that doesn’t bother me much."
2.0,"These are not very flattering glasses. The lense is not pink, but super pale gray. The frames are flat, with not curve whatsoever. They feel light and cheap and I doubt they provide any sun protection. My 12 yo loves them though, so I have them 2 stars."
2.0,"Returned.  Cheaper quality build than I expected.  I guess when something has a ton of 5 star reviews, I'm expecting it to be a better deal than it seems this is.  This caused me to go and buy something in the $100 range, with which I'm much happier."
2.0,Size really big
2.0,It’s very small compared to the pictures
2.0,I got a 12-18 month for my son who is in 18 month clothes. Some 18 months are too tight depending on the brand. This however is literally like a 3T!!!! Under size like a lot... Have to return for sure. Thin material.
2.0,the pockets are missing the shorts are made cheaply the ribbon doesn't have anything to go through and is just tie-able the buttons are very loose. They are not scratchy or hot and overall are comfortable but the fabric is sheer and see through. the waist is a tight fit so get a size up if you buy them (it is elastic) overall not really worth 19 dollars but if its comfort you want go ahead and buy them.
2.0,"Ordered this pom pom to go with a backpack that I ordered. The backpack is going back, but this pom pom charm I'm stuck with it. I have a hard time believing it's real fur as it feels rather fake in person. It came with a rusted up clasp which I ended up swapping out from my old charms, hence why I knocked off some stars, poor hardware. It came in an extremely sticky white packaging so some of the hair got pulled. I fluffed it up with my hair dryer on cool setting and it fluffed up nicely. The one side has a weird dip in the middle, it doesn't look ugly but makes one side of the pom pom somewhat flat at times. Overall, I would not buy from this seller again (Mfurs), poor hardware and terrible packaging. I provided some photos after it's been fluffed. I'd return it, but the package the seller put this in got destroyed from trying to open the darn thing! So now I'm stuck with it, sigh."
2.0,"So for $20 I knew this was not going to be a bridesmaids dress. First off, its a cute dress for a night out! It is by no means a formal gown as pictured. Bell sleeves.. um actual a ruffled sleeve. It is a polyester/nylon/spandex blend fabric (like a bathing suit) Again, super cute dress for a night out especially for $20… but again.. not the same as picture."
2.0,Fit like a 16..... i ordered a 2x... sat right below my bottom butt crease.... ordering a bigger size
2.0,Earrings are very small. Perhaps fine for young ears. Wires had a coating on them and was unable to get them in my ears. Loved the colors just not big enough.
2.0,Definitely NOT sparkly! Looks cheap and dull... don’t buy.
2.0,"UPDATE:  I did decide to return the jacket.  It's really too bad because I love the style and the cut, it's just that the stripes were all over the place as you can see on the picture that I attached.  If I can get this jacket where the lines/stripes, on the sleeves and the pockets in front, are all lined up nicely like on the picture on the model, or if this style jacket can be made in maybe a plain color, I would definitely buy it.  I do recommend this style/cut of jacket.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />The picture of the jacket shows the stripes are aligned.  The jacket that I just received had the stripes all over the place.  I'm still debating whether to return or keep.  For the price paid, the craftmanship should be a bit better.  Attaching a photo that shows the strips on the pockets and sleeves don't line up at all, unlike the photos."
2.0,Bracelet is much smaller than expected!
2.0,"I ordered two and they were both for the same ear, and the side that my hair covers."
2.0,"This mask is not very comfortable as the plastic lays on your face, it also fogs over every time you breath so not very functional when teaching."
2.0,Very heavy on the ears.
2.0,The glasses are great at night but the quality is poorly. Already lost one of the side glass.
2.0,"Cheaply made, the band is barely attached to the watch itself, has no weight to it but you get what you pay for so can't dock all the stars"
2.0,"Product looked like the picture,  however even with adjusting the size, the shirt was way too small and much shorter than expected. Wasn't worth trying on"
2.0,"Received as a Christmas gift, very disappointing. Cheap looking poor quality. Sending back."
2.0,20% of the stones are falling
2.0,Without new pins to put my watch on the band its kinda worthless.  I've purchased this band from other suppliers and always got new pins.
2.0,I’m not pleased with the fabric/fit. The fabric feels nice and sleek but it doesn’t stay put. I spent the whole day pulling and tugging them up. This is the first pair of Baleaf leggings I haven’t liked. I would never buy these again
2.0,This is so small and flat I can't see it holding much of anything.  There are other flat options for carrying money and such for less money.
2.0,Not a nice fabric.. looks cheap
2.0,"When they were delivered, the leggings came soaking wet with several small dark stains on them like rust stains. I washed them and were able to get them out and they fit good but i don’t think i would consider buying again"
2.0,I didn’t use it because the mask & antenna seams were all ripped. It’s just in my closet untouched.
2.0,"Compre esto porque dice que no tiene varilla, lo cual es mentira pero en si, están bien"
2.0,"I read the reviews. I am 5'8 and 150lbs, so usually a small/medium. I ordered a medium (technically an XL) and it was HUGE! Will be returning."
2.0,Far too loose. Going to fall out or be ripped out by the first car wash.
2.0,Returning this dress. I tried it on and it's just not the bandage material I am use to. Too thin. Also not pure white. It's off white.
2.0,"I personally did not like how they fit, very lose and short."
2.0,"strap not sized for adults.  nose bridge feels great, but goggles leak (maybe don't fit my sace)  Total waste of money - will not use after the one try."
2.0,I have big hands and they fit perfectly. They look like the real thing and are definitely do the part as costume gloves. They look great. The only drawback is they already have a hole and ice only worn then for 10 mins. Not sure if they came that way or it happened as I was putting them on. Either way the seams shouldn’t open that easily.
2.0,I got this necklace for my daughter and it does not glow in the dark at all.....fail incrediblegifts fail that said it looks ok
2.0,They run small material does not give much.
2.0,"I got my coverup today but it's not the one in the picture.  The dress that came has short sleeves and it's defective/irregular.  The right side of this dress isn't sewn i.e. When I put it on, I can put my arm through the left sleeve but the right side is wide open lol.  Needless to say, this is going back.  Obviously, whoever inspected this was sleeping on the job!!  I gave it 2 stars because I like the way it feels and even though it's not the same dress in the picture, I like it but the right side of this dress isn't sewn up."
2.0,These run big and they are definitely out for high impact exercise.
2.0,I was excited to get these and anticipated them to run small from the reviews so I ordered the next size up. The frustrating thing is that half the pairs fit as they should and the other pairs seem like they were sewed incorrectly. The elastic around the legs are tight and uncomfortable and are way too tight. I would cop it up to me ordering the wrong size but the fact that the sewing is inconsistent between pairs is disappointing.
2.0,"The shorts fit as they should, and the top layer was thin and ""swishy"" as expected, but the material of the inner layer was much thiner than expected -- very slippy feeling and almost see-through  -- and as a result was not sturdy enough for the pockets to actually hold anything in. It took three bounces for my phone to bounce right out of the pocket. Returning them."
2.0,Rhinestones fall off from time to time. Nice belt for the price though.
2.0,This dress is perfect for tall people. I am 5’1 therefore does not look right on me. The material looks cheap.
2.0,"Costume sold by fanshengshop is different than some other sellers. It seems more true to size (which means I ordered too large, since I read some reviews that said  to size up). Material seemed good quality for a costume. But the biggest issue was that it is the wrong color - the dress was purple instead of blue and did not come with wristbands as described."
2.0,I have only used it about three times before it broke.
2.0,This dress did not fit well at all. I had a lot of space around my chest and shoulders and the stitching around the waist was uneven.
2.0,This certainly is not as attractive in reality as it is in the site picture. I'm disappointed.
2.0,"Difficult to keep on head. Otherwise, very nice. If you have thin hair, you may have to tinker with it to get it to stay on correctly. Served the purpose, but, the clip style could be made with shorter/thinner hair styles in mind."
2.0,You get what you pay for.  Poorly made.
2.0,Exchanged for a smaller size and was still too big. Does not have great support on the top and didn’t even wear the bottoms for the trip that I got it for. The straps ended up turning my shoulders black even though it had already been through the laundry before wearing it.
2.0,Runs small and cannot be returned! Make sure you size correctly. I always wear a medium and this medium was more like a small.
2.0,"Too small! If I had had a 32 inch waist, and not a 37 inch waist it might’ve fit?"
2.0,The is smaller
2.0,Material was very thin and the sizing is way off.  I ordered a large for a loose fit and it was so small that my 10 year old could wear it.  Returned.
2.0,"I am almost always a medium (size 6/8) and could not even button this in a size M over my chest (Large C) and at the waist. At first I thought they send me an XS by mistake, but the tag read Medium. Beautiful pattern and color, though!"
2.0,I was not impressed by the tint of the lenses in these sunglasses.  The lenses gave a pinkish color to anything viewed through them.  They make looking at outdoor scenes less enjoyable.
2.0,The shorts are nice and have made it through several washes with no wear and tear. The shirt just looks cheap and doesn't match the quality of the shorts. Overall it was worth the price for the shorts and I found a red shirt for my girls to wear with this.
2.0,These really didn't fit right and they were too short.
2.0,The shirt is super soft. Love the sleeves. However the colors didn't match. The colors are a lot lighter than shown.
2.0,"So they're definitely bandanas, they're definitely cotton, and the size is right. Beyond that it falls off a bit: the printing is only on one side of the cloth and doesn't show through the fabric very much and the paisley pattern includes a bit that says ""100% cotton"" in the graphic, which is super weird. They seem fine for now but nothing to write home about or recommend."
2.0,Got a size 13 and they fit like a size 10. They were way too small!!
2.0,Fit so weird and came with a huge hole in the inner thigh... Definitely making me second guess
2.0,They're not very good quality. I'm able to see my underwear color through the pants
2.0,Bought this specifically to be oversized (size XL) and couldn’t even wear the shorts because they were so tight
2.0,Shirt is a little shorter than I would like
2.0,"Big & Tall?!  Not really,...maybe in China.  Shown is 33 ""Double-Extra Large"" pants on a 5'6"" boy.  They are a perfect length for him, but they shouldn't have been if the pants were really big&tall.  We planned to rip and cut these for a costume, so the length didnt matte much, but the acerage customer would expect a longer inseam.  The fit is also tight for anyone with a decent sized butt and non-thin legs.  His usual size is 34 which requires a belt and does have 33 pants tha fit loser than these.  These are worth the $10 of the sz 32, but the $17 for the sz 33 is wee much.  The quality isnt quite that high."
2.0,"Like the feel of the fabric, but I was still swimming in an XS. It looked like a granny dress. The model must’ve 6 feet tall."
2.0,I ordered the white one and it’s very cheap looking.
2.0,"Not as shown, much shorter on me than the model and I went up a size."
2.0,This is a beautiful coat but like many I have problems with the bust. It is to small and to get the right size I’d have to get one way to big in other ways.
2.0,"I returned it, the shirt looked dirty and stained. 2 stars because the shirt was a soft material."
2.0,"Very cheaply made, thin thin material, and color is completely off. The olive green is a poop brown. The clothes fit but the seams where sewn are tight."
2.0,clasp was broken had to replace it to wrap the present
2.0,Dress fit perfect but retuning because of poor stiching near the end of the slit on the back and a brownish stain on the dress.
2.0,Medium was small. An xL would have been best. I usually wear a Medium but this dis not fit right at all and did not look like the picture.
2.0,"Nice enough for cosplay, but a I was more than a bit disappointed by this item.  It's extremely thin, more of a wafer than a coin,and the design it more of a shallow stamp then a carving or embossment.  Would not pay this much for it again."
2.0,luv the polarized  aviator clip ons.<br /><br />problem is the Jaky clip-ons don't bend and hug my original glasses.<br />In my opinion I cant use them as I see blurry areas.
2.0,"It fit ok, I am 5 foot 9, 165lbs, it was fitted not loose. Despite this, the garment wasn’t flattering due to both the print and the thicker type fabric."
2.0,"I liked the style on the front of this shirt, as well as the colors offered, but unfortunately it just isn't very flattering. It is quite long in the front, and with the crochet panel going directly down the middle, it looks like it's leading right to your...area. I returned it."
2.0,"I could have made this underwear at home. So cheap. I like the cotton factor, but oh my gosh...it's like it was just slapped together."
2.0,"The size was good. The color is more of a neon yellow than green and the bottom is see through on the backside, so I kept it 'cause I liked the top, but wear a different bottom from the one it came from. Sadly still not the green I expected."
2.0,Cute but way too narrow
2.0,"Looked nice when I got them. They are made very cheaply. Fall apart. To put anything on the necklace at all was a long process. Will not buy again. I had to buy other necklaces at the end of all this. They went right on, no issues. I can say I did like the Satin silk!"
2.0,"These are sized very small. If you're ordering an extra large size you'd assume roominess. I'm not a fan of tight fitting things, particularly sleep or lounge ware. I always order larger sizes than I need to accommodate for loose fit. Even at the top range of size they are still snug. Also one of them arrived with one of the pockets not even sewn together; just a flap of fabric. Very disappointed in this product. I would not recommend."
2.0,"The vest I ordered is advertised with a hood, the one I recieved does not have one. I have set up a return and ordered a new one (only because now there is a promotion going with 50% off) so going to give it another try. If the promotion was not going, I would have just returned and let that be that, bc it is a very thin, not so great quality of material. But well give it another shot 🤷‍♀️"
2.0,These rum small
2.0,It looks cuter on the girl in the picture...  I don't have bangs so maybe that's why.  I look like a painter with it on
2.0,"I should have read more reviews before buying this. This cap is made for BB heads. It is tiny, it will barely fit my 12 year old daughter's head. Disappointed at this for the price."
2.0,This item was 2 sizes too small and the material is very thin.
2.0,"This was a major disappointment. The pictures feature a slender waistline, not an empire waist (which I hate and would never buy). The draping around the bodice doesn’t lay right, and wrinkles. I wear an XS, and the small was tight and odd fitting. Look elsewhere."
2.0,This hat does not fit my head at all
2.0,The details said “small” and also said “woman and men” as well as “size fits most”.<br />This mask is HUGE! I adjusted the straps and the mask pretty much touched my ears. My entire face could fit in this. I have to fold it so it doesn’t ride up to my eyes or hang 2 inches off my chin. I wanted this mask so bad and now I’m not sure I’ll be able to make it work.
2.0,Not sure how these are supposed to work but they did not stay in the position as advertised. I sent them back. They fell out of my ears very quickly.
2.0,"Seems to be made ok, just can't tighten down.  So it spins on your wrist. Material needs to be a half in shorter so that you can tighten it to fit your wrist."
2.0,Very large when I asked for a small. Made from a cheap synthetic fabric.
2.0,Order two for Christmas gifts. Only problem was that the string would slip off of the elephants trunk. Other than that they're super cute.
2.0,Looks cute.  Wish the bar was a little longer as the hooks of the anchor dug into the inside of my navel.  The tip ended up falling off a week after i got it.
2.0,The fit is a little strange. It’s silky and oversized but comfortable. It doesn’t open in the front. I definitely don’t consider this a robe lol. I’m 5’7 142lb 36dd for reference.
2.0,The quality and the fit is off.<br />I don’t think the picture is accurate.
2.0,"I really love the look and feel of these glasses however they tend to break really easily, after about a month or so you lose one of the arms. I’ve bought several pairs because I really do love the look however this happens with every pair. So I will no longer be purchasing any more only to have to replace them a month later."
2.0,Love the dress color and design unfortunately it was too small on me.
2.0,display inside watch to dark
2.0,"Meh… If the fulfillment center had fulfilled my ordering pink instead of black, I’d feel better about them. But meh."
2.0,"This said a 1X, which is not, I am fashion critic, I wear a regular 16-18, not a plus side, when I gotv this and tried it on if was so tight on v the arms, my graND daughter who wear a size 8-10, I gave it to her which fix perfect, if you have a small frame order it if you are 14 to a plus size do not order"
2.0,Quality is subpar.<br /><br />Final thought: keep searching
2.0,Pins do not connect to Fitbit HR.
2.0,Sizes run small and the zipper sticks a little.
2.0,Not the quality I’m used from this brand.
2.0,"The Zipadee-Zip product from Sleeping Baby is great but this Flying Squirrel just really isn’t necessary, don’t waste your money.<br />Our first son did great with the Zipadee-Zips but hated wearing these so we just skipped this second step and went straight to a regular blanket without a problem.<br />Our second son is now wearing the Flying Squirrel that we had purchased a while back since we already had it. We recently tried purchasing another Flying Squirrel since our old one has ripped but the size was way too big even though it was the next step up. Unfortunately Sleeping Baby does not offer free shipping or free returns/exchanges. Long story short and many emails later with Sleeping Baby customer service, I’m out $15 for ordering the wrong size ($6 to ship, $6 to return and a $3 restocking fee) Just be sure you order the right size the first time."
2.0,"So, when I saw jogger, I was expecting a t-shirt or sweater like cotton. These are basically super soft spandex / lycra pants that are loose at the calf. I even sized up and they don't fit like joggers at all for my body type! Ladies, if you have a big booty and thick thighs, and wants something baggy, don't do these. I feel naked in them, no suppirt whatsoever, super thin fabric. I would not guy these again. Sorry."
2.0,Was not thick enough for the season i want it for other than that it was ok.
2.0,These didn't do anything to relieve night glare as I was expecting. It just turned white headlight glare to yellow headlight glare.
2.0,Hi this mask was not what I expected. It feels very cheap and no air for breathing. If you have respitory issues do not buy.
2.0,wore a few times and the picture is coming off
2.0,Too small for my neck.  Feel like I'm being strangled.  Sent back.
2.0,"These shoes are very cute, however, EXTREMELY SMALL!!!  My child is a 9.5 or 10...a lot of times the 10s are too big...  she could not even get these size 10s on her feet.  I thought she was playing around so I sat there trying to shove her feet into them and I couldn't get them in either.  When I held this shoe up against her other shoes it was a lot smaller.  Not sure how to advise anyone to order because they were so small you might have to order 2 sizes up.  Very disappointed!"
2.0,Quality of the belt part is good but the plastic pin broke on the buckle after 2 weeks.
2.0,Do not purchase these!!! The stuff on them peels off and leaves you with just silver earrings. I was so excited to get these but they are so cheaply made. I wore them for awhile but now all of them have peeled off halfway and dont look good anymore. So my advice would be to pay a little bit more money for some better ones.
2.0,"Pro: good quality product<br />Cons: We ordered the tie clip with the Agents for Shield symbol on it, and it was never received. We ordered another one while waiting for the first order. We finally received the 2nd order, however, it was the Captain America tie clip rather than the Agents of Shield one we ordered.<br />The product was perfect. It was just the wrong one. And they never contacted us about our first order that was never received."
2.0,"Prescription inserts are extremely small I can't find who can made it and a reasonable price because the insert size, it is plenty space to do at least 1/4 larger inserts, l other it is good lightweight etc. But useful for me without prescription."
2.0,It wasn’t what I was expecting. Wrinkles and made cheap and is see through.
2.0,"They served their purpose as gifts for my bridesmaids. &#34;Help me tie the knot&#34; however, they are very flimsy. As i was pushing them through the display foam to put them in the boxes, they bent and there was no way to straiten them out. I don't think many of the girls will be wearing them. But they are cute for a little gift or just a pair of cheap cute earrings."
2.0,"I loved the pink color, but unfortunately, it arrived with two red smudges on it. I had to return it."
2.0,Looks good.  Good price.  Broke within 2 weeks
2.0,Cheap and still with the adjustment.  Did not adjust to my prescription.
2.0,"The color is not as pictured. It was more of a blue instead of grey. The pockets work. The material is itchy. They are not high waisted as described. The worst part is, you take two steps and the pants fall down. There is no running in these and hardly any walking unless you are using suspenders or want to run with your hands at your waist holding your pants up. Wish I would have retuned them - corona got in the way."
2.0,"No matter your breast size, you must wear a shirt underneath it. It's very, very, VERY lose and your entire boobs will hang out - small or large. Myself and my sister tried it on.. way too large. Cute dress but you must layer"
2.0,"Cute, but the position of the stem makes wearing these difficult. The stem is positioned so that they lay unevenly and weird. If you have long ear lobes, they’ll make you look like you have even longer lones and if short ear lobes, it may not even fit at all...."
2.0,I was looking for a skimpy bikini but this was comically small on the bottoms and large on the top. I am usually a medium on the top and bottom but the sizing on this was way off.
2.0,a little bulky.
2.0,Beautiful color and quality but smaller than I imagined
2.0,I ordered a size larger then I normally wear but it was still tight.
2.0,Too narrow and smaller size
2.0,"I gave it as a gift. She was so excited when she opened it, but the chain broke before she could even put it on. They took the pendant in hopes of finding a different chain for it."
2.0,Shrinks bad and I don't dry hardly any of our clothes
2.0,Sadly this swim suit didn't fit. I got a medium but it was way too large i had to return it. I'm usually a small/medium but I got a medium because I thought since it's a one piece a small might be too tight. A medium was HUGE and didn't even cover my nips. Disappointed
2.0,Adorable but about 2 sizes too small.
2.0,"The shirt is thin cheap material ,, it doesn’t hang as low as it shows it’s more WIDE then anything. Size up if yu want a loose fit.. I’m disappointed but w/ Amazon purchases you never know lol"
2.0,They were so flimsy it ripped as soon as we put them on! I won't buy them again!
2.0,"We are returning the item as it is very thin and small. It barely reached around my husband’s wrist and almost looked like a toy, although features did work. We decided a child around 10 might be more suited for it. We are trying a pricier Casio."
2.0,This is NOT lightweight. Heavier material than other outdoor neck gaiters. Description is wrong.
2.0,"These did not fit my glasses well.  One tip frayed, which caused the glasses to come out of the sleeves very easily"
2.0,Did not polish Silver as expected. Have a wine chiller with silver. Had to sent back for service to repolish.
2.0,This hat is very flattering and cute but as others have said it fails at it’s main job which is protecting you from the sun. The light shines right through the brim and if you bring it next to your face you can see right through the hat. I highly doubt it’s actually UPF 50. I purchased a UPF 50 hat from Sun Grubbies and the difference is huge. The Sun Grubbies hat does an excellent job at keeping the sun out and you can’t see any light shining through the brim like you can with this Slogger’s hat.<br /><br />I purchased the white one so it’s possible another color would have done a better job but I suggest you save your money to purchase a better hat from a company that specializes in sun protection clothing. It may cost more up front but what’s the use of buying a cheaper hat if it’s not actually offering much protection?
2.0,I wore these earrings while in Hawaii and I experienced pain in my right ear  This pain comes from non sterling or gold or non hypo allergenic earnings with me.  I haven't warn them since and plan to return them.
2.0,"This is a really pretty dress, but it arrive extremely wrinkled. It smells really bad as well. It looks exactly like the picture, but the delivery is extremely disappointing. I wouldn't buy from this seller again."
2.0,kinda short for me
2.0,I don't like the feel of the material. It comes out of dryer wrinkled. It is not flattering.
2.0,The sweater arrived with a stain on the shoulder.  I tried to bleach it out and it would not come out.  The sizes run small.
2.0,These are not for large breasts. I ordered e-f cup size. They would only work if you had very very perky breasts and smashed them into a very tight shirt😂
2.0,Not as pretty as pictured.  Has an unfinished hem. I would have returned it but my grand daughter loves it.
2.0,"These masks are smaller than normal size. I love the colors and patterns. But I'm really disappointed, because they are really small compared to my other adult size masks. One of the masks also arrived with a ripped seam, so the nose bridge piece was protruding."
2.0,"I dislike the fabric, but the color was very nice. No stretch."
2.0,These straight leg pants appear more like flare leg.  I returned them.
2.0,"At the end of the first day of my two year old wearing with shoes, there was a hole in the big toe."
2.0,"My son bought this for me for Christmas and I can't even get the chain done up around my neck.  Not sure<br />if it was meant for a little girl, but it does not fit and adult."
2.0,Not enough support and straps were really long
2.0,Picture messed up first wash
2.0,Got 5 doubles
2.0,the bottom sticks out so I don't wear it. its pretty and one of my hooks were missing
2.0,I had such high hopes for this romper and I was so sad when I returned it.  The print is cute but the fit was way off!  It looked very bulky and boxy on me and the crotch area was much lower than expected.
2.0,It was so tight on the shoulders that the sleeves popped up over my shoulders every time I moved.
2.0,Actually bought this for second time cos granddaughter loved the shirt. Bought the fist time through wish... this time I bought it the shorts were way too small the shirt fit ok but first time wearing it it ripped half way down under the arm I didn't even think I just threw the shirt away. Then next day I was kicking myself cos I could have sent back. Cute outfit but runs small.
2.0,The belt is higher than the norm and the belt overlaps the flap or shoulder cape on the back I see the photos wont show that It looks like a design flaw as though trying to make it different yet not very functional.
2.0,This is advertised as t-shirt! Definately NOT tshirt material! Very thick and heavy material NOT as advertised! Also NO Waffleknit!
2.0,Very shiny material 😞
2.0,These wings are stiff and lack mobility wearing them.  My child was pretty disappointed with them.  We missed the return date and are now stuck with them.
2.0,Fabric color (red) spread all over my sheets after sleeping in this pajama. I don't really sweat that much either. Was surprised for sure!!
2.0,"The &#34;lens&#34; protecting the hands is a cheap plastic, and falls off. Seconds into getting this and correcting the time the plastic came off and damage one of the hands."
2.0,"Not as nice as I had hoped.  I would not say this is luxury, but rather just an average robe.  Not as plush or cozy as the picture shows.  I would also say it runs small. I wear a size 4 in women’s, and I thought the S/M is too small.  I wanted ... and if you want a high quality plush absorbent hotel/spa bathrobe, don’t get this one. I was disappointed."
2.0,The zipper is messed up after one day of wear. The price does not fit the value.
2.0,I was recently married on March 13 and My husband works in construction as a pipefitter. There is no way he can safely wear his ring to work so he was so excited to get his LSU ring. BE SURE TO CHECK THE SIZING!!! It will not be your normal ring size. We are both so sad the ring is too small now he won’t have a ring to wear at work until we can get this fixed!! He absolutely love everything about his ring except that it’s too small. He’s 46 and just got married for the first time so he loves having a ring on his finger. We are just so disappointed that it is too small. He will need 1 size larger than his normal size. I’m just so sad he can’t wear it. I hate not seeing his ring on his finger. But again other than sizing we both absolutely love it. We will also get the Saints ring for me soon too. We play softball together and it’s a great way to keep your finger marked and not worry about destroying your expensive rings!!
2.0,Tight in the calf area. My daughter in law doesn't have big calves but she had trouble getting them zipped up. Kind of cheap looking but paid $30 bucks you get what you pay for.
2.0,I like that they are quick dry but fits to snug
2.0,Second time I ordered. First time packaged arrived emply envelope not sealed. Shoes atr cute  but run big and the buckle doesnt hold together well.
2.0,Very boxy on
2.0,"Pretty but I’m 5’9” and the dress doesn’t touch the floor like the pic, it’s inches too short. Too late to return."
2.0,Cool but is larger than expected and heavy. Hits my collar bone and hurts.<br />I emailed the company and told them I will keep but told them as described above.<br />They were nice and emailed me back that they're sorry and if I would want to exchange I could.<br />I haven't--too much trouble sending back.<br />So I don't wear much.<br />It's classy looking though.
2.0,The first day I wore it I noticed there was rips in the fabric and it looked very worn on one side. Returned it and bought a Diophy backpack.
2.0,"I’m 5’5”, 130 lbs. I purchased a medium and they fit pretty well! Very comfy! Thankfully I brought these on a work trip and wore them at the hotel for the first night. Loved them, but I woke up to a purple stain in the bed. I tossed them and asked for house keeping to change my bedding."
2.0,"First off, the Chinese sizing is off. They do not understand American sizing. Not only do they run too short (maybe a 1/2 inch too short) in the toe, but are more narrow than regular American shoes. The other thing is that these are not man made leather (fake leather), they are a rubberized material like for a rain boot but not shiny. They are also impossible to wiggle into. No side zippers. You are are your own to wrestle your foot in. The strangest boot I have ever tried on. The chunky heel is also not all rubber or solid like you would expect. When I was putting boot back in the box and grabbed the heel, inside it was a plastic hollow cage like structure with thin layer of rubber wrapped around it. Imagine walking around at an outdoor concert event all day and the plastic cage in the heel snapping. I have NEVER seen hollow plastic heels like this. I want to see a solid chunk heel. Solid inside and out. Very strange!"
2.0,Length was shorter than expected
2.0,"Pretty but  the buttons came off after 1 wearing.  Also, they are *not* water resistant making them retain the cold if you handle snow."
2.0,"I saw that people were really happy with these leggings and that they had pockets. Sadly, I was not one of those individuals...<br />Sadly, they were too small, even in a size up from my normal size, and see-through when the material stretched out. It bummed me out because I really wanted leggings with pockets, but I will keep looking until I find a pair that works out for me."
2.0,Small in size.
2.0,Zipper broke with light use
2.0,The lense fell out of the glasses when I was wearing them at work.  I’m a health care worker and I have to wear eye covering.  These are cute but poorly made.
2.0,"No good. They are comfortable/breathable, not as baggy as a lot of people made them sound. i expected them to barely touch my legs and they definitely do. i don't have skinny thighs or calves but all the reviewers made them sound like they would be bigger than the average large. They slide down too much for my liking. Definitely not a gym pant definitely only wear for sleep or lounge."
2.0,"It was to small,it largeras they advertise it..."
2.0,"The dress is not bad looking, but the one I received has been worn and washed. The botttom part of the palazzo which has some type of thin golden lace has ripped off and the threads were all over the place."
2.0,To delicate for a 10 year old to wear.  Had it less than 2 hours and it broke.
2.0,"I wear a 9-1/2 wide shoe, so why are these size 11 moccasins so tight on my feet?  I am trying to decide whether to return them."
2.0,"This broke in like 3 seconds, but it is also like $1 so kind of expected."
2.0,Zipper is cheap and snags on the sweater material on the top each and every time
2.0,Impossible to clasp shut once they get into the ear.
2.0,"These fit weird. The thong is too far back, making them uncomfortable."
2.0,"I had bought this dress for a party I was attending but unfortunately was not able to wear it due to it being too large. The dress has pockets which is usually a huge plus however in this case the pockets made it look like I have large hips. Also, I was hoping for a typical red flannel look however the color was much more orange than I was expecting. Ultimately, I was disappointed with my purchase."
2.0,Sizes ran too small on both granddaughters.
2.0,buttons are very touchy.  I cant bend my wrist without opening the clasp
2.0,Really cute but thin material and runs small. Order one size bigger at least
2.0,The material is cheap for the price that i paid. And also small.
2.0,Garbage. Way too thin.
2.0,Not silky like the ones I had 15 years ago. Bumpy after one or two washes.
2.0,These are very cheap. Very thin. Almost paper like feel. See thru. Loose strands along the hems. Run small so you’ll want to order up a size. These kept riding up the rear. Not comfy at all. More of an annoyance than anything.
2.0,"Color is not even close to the picture. Size is so small, I got an XS like always but I have to have assistance taking it off lol"
2.0,"not the color i wanted at all, it doesn't even match the color in the picture. but a couple stars for the fittings and how it feels"
2.0,"It was pretty small and flimsy.  If you don't have many toiletries it may work, but I feel as though it is not large enough for an average traveler. I returned mine."
2.0,Ordered this dress in the Lake Blue. Fits really nice. Absolutely loved it so I ordered in purple in the exact same size. The purple fits more snug and is much shorter. Disappointed in the purple.
2.0,Thread broke when I first put it on
2.0,Not shorts.
2.0,"The scallop detail is cute, but it's a raw edge! The zipper is not even finished into the neckline!"
2.0,The sweater quality is decent but the print is blurry and not a screen print.
2.0,I it was too thin
2.0,"Wayyyy too tight in the bust area! I got it because I’m breastfeeding so the buttons would work awesome, but it was way to tight and way too low! Like my boobs were hanging out! Other than that the dress was beautiful! Material was kinda cheap but could work if it was taken care of. Definitely not worth the price. $10 quality."
2.0,"I bought the largest size they had and I normally wear a 14. It barely closes in the front and I dislike the way the tassels get in my breakfast, coffee, sink when I wash my hands, etc. Not a great robe, especially for the price."
2.0,It broke 3 days after I put it on. Very fragile.
2.0,"The anklet was pretty, but too big."
2.0,"This is a knock off... bought 5 simply southern shirts in the same size from various sellers at the same time... all had the same tags, same length and width (sizing consistency),  and same weighted material except this one... this one didn’t have a tag - it was “tag less”, material was thin , and it was significantly smaller than the others...  my daughter likes it, so I won’t be returning it..."
2.0,Charm fell off of the medal
2.0,"The glasses were alright. I was pretty upset that there was a bent which made the glasses unwearable. Also, they were pretty big so beware if you have a smaller face."
2.0,"Love the look, but the product is extremely unreliable. You get what you pay for with these cheap mechanical watches. However, I have been getting many compliments on the piece!"
2.0,Had to return it because it was way too large for my small head.
2.0,Way too tight on my feet.
2.0,Photos are deceiving. It looks like a typical ornament in the shape of a sphere. It's just a flat one sided piece of cheap metal.
2.0,"I were a size 10 shoes, the fit is too small for my shoe size!"
2.0,"I understand variations in natural stone, but these don’t even look like they’re part of the same pair. A bit more care in trying to more closely match plugs would be nice. Can’t even wear this set."
2.0,"I had ordered another dress similar to the one I returned, however the same dress price,material,and company fit perfectly."
2.0,The elastic around the front stretches when you flex your foot so they don’t stay attached to your foot. They don’t bend AT ALL when your foot does. If you want a shoe that smacks your foot every time you step…these are for you! Hard and heavy!
2.0,there is a weir5d fit to this top. The fabric is rough and see thru.
2.0,Made this purchase...hoping it would sparkle and I could wear it all the time.  I can't even wear it a day without it turning my skin dirty looking...I am finding more and more of the bracelet purchase I make the same thing happens.
2.0,"you CANNOT do any sort of cardio/hiit with these. if you static weightlift, ok, fine but otherwise these are terrible. two stars because i really like the color/pattern"
2.0,"I bought this tank on 9/6/21 and I really liked it at first. It was comfy and for well. Unfortunately, I washed it the other day on a gentle cycle but the stitching on one of the straps came undone. It unraveled the strap and part of the top. It didn't last a year which is very disappointing."
2.0,Very difficult to get off and on because there is no elastic in the neck or sleeve. Serious manufacturing flaw I’m going to have to buy an entirely different swim suit. No elastic in the neck. It doesn’t allow for any give. Very difficult for my granddaughter to get off and on when it’s dry or wet either one. Very important for you to know
2.0,It’s a pretty dress just wish is was a little longer.
2.0,"Was excited about this ring. It showed up at my door, just as lovely as the photos. However after 2 weeks the gold coating is wearing off"
2.0,Cute concept but not if you have boobs above a B cup. The fabric in the chest area was even wide enough to cover the sticky boobs I wore with it that only cover half my breast. Love the color though. I gave it to a smaller chested friend and she likes it.
2.0,"THIS IS JUST LIKE AN ORDINARY KEY CAIN, AND IT DOES NOT REALLY WORK AT ALL."
2.0,cheap looking and a little large for my tastes.
2.0,2 bracelets Brock trying to out them on:(..<br />Bit the others are still working out fine.
2.0,This was basically made of plastic. The pattern looked nice but not as nice in person.
2.0,Too small once I got it over my shoulders
2.0,Comfy but not good quality. Starting getting holes after just a few wears
2.0,Returned but canceled.  Hope to use it.. MLM
2.0,"They look great, but are waaaaay too small. Based on reviews that said they run small, I bought my husband large instead of medium. They are now mine, because they fit me perfectly: I am a size 6 woman."
2.0,Too loose for size indicated and very thin.
2.0,I bought this for my bridal shower and it's ok. The lace is pretty and the fabric is soft but it is also extremely this. Even wearing a nice bra underneath you can see it. There elastic is also pretty flimsy.
2.0,"Two stars because these pants are comfortable, but the fit is so unflattering that I can’t even wear them outside of the house - and I normally like the harem pant fit. These were very cheaply made and you can tell. The part that should be baggy between the legs is only baggy in the hip area so it just looks like there’s too much fabric in that one spot. Also, the “tummy control” has no control. Yoga pants provide more control than these pants that are supposedly specifically for tummy control. I’ve already started losing the swelling in my postpartum belly, so the lack of tummy control doesn’t bother me as much as the unflattering fit, but if that’s what you’re mainly looking for, then you’ve been warned. Overall, I’d recommend just buying a different pair of pants that you don’t have to worry about being so hidden in because of the poor design."
2.0,The two acrylic pairs lost the clip and were detached before opening the package. I may be able to glue it but likely it will break again the small clip is harder to open than the adhesive holding it to the earring
2.0,This is running way too small
2.0,Nice skirt but my very large. My daugher is almost 5yrs old and wears a size 5 (XS) and this skirt did not fit at all. Had to send back.
2.0,"A little on the flimsy side, compared to another version I bought from another vendor on Amazon. But cute."
2.0,ran way too small.  I returned these.
2.0,"No pockets, scoop neck, not cowl"
2.0,"Annoyed. Ordered twice and both times did not receive expected item. 1st time I ordered pink, received white dress which was very lovely, but a little too see through and not what I wanted. 2nd try, the dress was not a wrap style dress, and although similar in appearance, not what I wanted."
2.0,"They were just bigger then I thought they would be, and I ended up having a allergy to them"
2.0,"Looks great on the outside but inside line was super small, not shaped like outside skirt, and came ripped- had to return."
2.0,it was an xmas gift that was returned for an exchange.
2.0,This was too small and it was not worth the price.  I am returning it.
2.0,Doesn’t fit anything like it looks on the photo.  Not a one size fits all.  Very baggy in the back.
2.0,The handle breaks easily
2.0,"It appears that I received a dress someone had returned.  Dress appears to have been worn before and arrived  with 2 safety pins attached.  If the dress had arrived new, I am pretty sure I would have loved it. The color is great. The fabric is thin, but it would have been great for a beach photo session.  As I am leaving town for the event I bought it for tomorrow, I am returning. Very disappointed."
2.0,Not a true fit had to return
2.0,Not what I had hope for. Just didn't work for my feet.
2.0,"I would rate this higher, but the credit card slots are too small. If you get your card in, you wrestle to get it out."
2.0,"I really wanted to like these dresses, but I just thought they looked cheap. I was hoping they would be as good of quality as an incline wrap dress, but I was disappointed. I sent all three dresses back."
2.0,To thick and hard to get on.
2.0,"Eh, it's a plastic hat with felt sprayed on"
2.0,"If you’re dead set on getting what you’re looking at (lol) don’t get this.  If you’re ok with a shirt that’s fairly similar, sure.  It has three buttons.  Doesn’t drape as shown, the cut is off, more a baggy shirt with a fitted hem line. The green isn’t as vibrant as the picture.  Big in the chest and too baggy under the armpits.  Typical of international Chinese manufacturers.  It’s a rough draft replica of what’s shown.  It’s midsized by a whole size"
2.0,My 5 year old loves it and it looked and fit perfectly BUT one of the straps broke after just 3 wears. Had to sew it back together because she loves it.
2.0,Zippers fail easily
2.0,The print is larger than pictured and the color is more burgundy than tec. Frantic is thicker than explained
2.0,"The very first sentence in the description of this scarf is/was (I reported the misinformation) “100%” cotton”  Nope, a flat out lie.  The scarf is 100% POLYESTER.  I bought it because of the cotton.  Will keep as it is correct color and zipper on pocket works fine, but still incredibly disappointed in mis-leading information."
2.0,An absolute beautiful bag!!  Love everything about it!  May order another color.<br />6-22-17 Revising my review<br />Although this bag has 3 separate sections the middle section is not sewn to the bottom of the bag.  Everything from the other sections slides under the middle section to the other side of just sits under the middle section.  It's really annoying!
2.0,We purchased these because they received good reviews outside of Amazon. Used them on a regular pair of glasses from mid May to mid June and already they fall off all the time.  It is so disappointing.
2.0,"The dress would have been cute if it fit properly.  If you have larger breasts, don't bother, as it did not cover them at all.  I was disappointed."
2.0,"I had hopes for this, especially since I love off shoulder tops for my body type (I have an athletic build). This is not very flattering and it does not look like the picture when you put it on. I am using it as a lounge shirt now."
2.0,Color on the photo is deceiving. It shows white and no where on the description the color is mentioned. It's beige color.<br />The material looks very cheap quality as well. For the price this definitely not worth it. Definitely returning this.
2.0,Short...
2.0,"These active shorts are okay but not great.  The first thing I noticed was that the color of them is a little more on the bluish-purple side compared to the royal blue in the pictures.  The color is nice and vibrant, but not exactly what I expected.  The material is lightweight and comfortable and has a good stretch to it.  Unfortunately the fit leaves something to be desired.  They are not as short as traditional dedicated running shorts, but are shorter than typical basketball shorts.  The fit is quite tight around the upper thighs and crotch areas, which even though they're stretchy isn't a great feel during active wear.  I'd only recommend these for skinny guys.  The fact that they only have one small pocket on the rear makes them most suitable for running, but they're longer and tighter than I'd want for that.  In the end, I'm not really sure what they're going for but I'm not loving them."
2.0,"This is the worst match of pearls I have ever seen, they come in a nice box and the stud and backing look good, but one pearl looks like it was sat on by a whale, and the other is round. I will be sending these back, maybe worth keeping if you by a few pairs and make a better match."
2.0,Some of the seams un-sewed after first washing. Material feels stiff. They are pretty.
2.0,"This was pretty but didn't last. I never got it wet but noticed the beads starting to get dull inside. Then it randomly broke while I was wearing it, not even from being stretched. All in all, this bracelet lasted at most six weeks."
2.0,Showed wear after one day.
2.0,These are cute in color and style but they literally fit like leggings not yoga pants.  You can see your underwear easily and they run small.
2.0,"Okay so crazy fun dress socks are coming on, so I decided hey I'll try this pack...<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />These socks are comfortable<br />They do a good job of staying up on your leg.<br />The packaging is great.<br />It is a good value for so many pairs of socks.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />The socks are very thin, which you may like that but for me i prefer thick socks, comes down to preference I guess.<br />The ones with lots of stitching along the top like break as you put your foot in. You hear threads breaking, feels cheap.<br /><br />Worst of all:<br /><br />I picked out my pattern for the exact sock combo I wanted, and I didn't get that combo, actually not one sock that arrived matched what I actually ordered. I will be in contact with Amazon and the seller about this and if they make it right and get me the right set I will be glad to update this section of my review."
2.0,This item was to big and to long. It was heavy enough but felt scratchy. I prefer a more smooth feel. So will be returning it. I have to package and pay postage as it is not covered under Amazon Prime.
2.0,Very pretty but Too big for a little girl!
2.0,Although it is a compression shirt I normally wear a small or medium but purchased a large. It's too snug for my liking to be a large
2.0,"It’s nice, but very slippery. It won’t stay on my head. :/"
2.0,Its a nice vest and fit very well however as soon as I opened the package one of the button's fell off.
2.0,"I typically wear a size 14 or Large.  I used the product specifications and measurements and ordered a size Large.  The dress is very stretchy, but still looked like I needed the next size larger.  I wish I could order an XL, but the promo code I used to get an extra $5 off is no longer valid.  I'm bummed because this is a gorgeously sophisticated dress."
2.0,the release lever does not release like it should
2.0,"Wooden gauges work very well, but the plastics ones irritated my ears sooooo much. I couldn’t keep them in longer than two days. I do have sensitive skin, so maybe it’s just me but for those of you with sensitive skin, beware!"
2.0,I like the color. But dislike the material. The quality is poor. I purchased this dress in red and blue  and love those dresses on amazon but from another seller. But they didn’t have lime green. My favorite color.
2.0,The material makes the dress look cheap
2.0,"The hat is too small and the scarf way too big. You’d need to attach a button to cover your front neck AND chest. It’s too open in the front. It doesn’t work as a scarf at all. The hat has a pointy top that makes it look like a costume. It needs to be round. It’s way too pointy. I tried stretching it and nothing. And again, way too small, and I have short hair. Someone with long or curly hair wouldn’t be able to fit in it.<br /><br />It’s a great idea. Just the design doesn’t work."
2.0,"Soft and comfy but doesn't stay in a garter well, tries to roll with the garter, rolls without the garter. Was highly disappointed :("
2.0,The dress it's self is cute fabric looks and feels cheap and inner slip is see through. Sleeve cuffs are a bit snug. But I can deal.
2.0,The item is not well made. It's pretty but don't wear it unless you have nothing underneath. I just wore it yesterday because the weather here has gotten chilly. I had a light weight black top and black leggings underneath and when I took it off I was covered in white fuzz from head to toe. Just hope it comes off my clothes when washed. Too late to return but won't wear again. Very disappointed!!!!
2.0,The quality was amazing and you wouldn't know they weren't real crocs except for labeling but the sizing was off by alot so they don't fit my son unfortunately
2.0,Ordered my size and it was way too small.  I couldn’t even get it past my shoulders to attempt to zip it.  Super bummed because the dress looked cute in person.
2.0,Color is more peach than pink. Bottom of shirt is tight for the size. Seller charges  a return fee.
2.0,Springs to attach the band broke almost immediately.
2.0,fits small. poor quality wool
2.0,"They were too small. Unfortunately, I'll have to return them."
2.0,"Super cute top, but not a one size fits all. I'm 5'8&#34; and 165 pounds, I wear small shirts and I popped the top bottom off of the shirt."
2.0,Sent it back.  The cap sleeves were different sizes.
2.0,Cute but it fit like it was made for a child.. order a few sizes up. I'm very disappointed
2.0,Falling apart two months later
2.0,The product I received is not what is pictured. There is one less button on the v-neck and it’s a one size fits all. The shirt is extremely wide and not something I can wear to work which was the entire purpose of purchasing. I’m only keeping it because it can be a lounge sweater or I’d be returning for a refund.
2.0,This dress could be cute but sticks out in the top sides and hip. cant get it to go down.
2.0,"I wanted to wear this as an every day. Thought I was buying a tarnish resistant piece, but within 2 days, it was losing the plating, and looking ""used"". Very disappointed in this piece...although very pretty, looked bad quickly."
2.0,Cheaply made. Super thin material. Looks cute but was ripped before.he even put.it on.
2.0,"Did not like it! Well I did until the minute I put it on, it stoped working... Now I just have a braclet so I'm very unhappy kuz I totally needed a watch"
2.0,"Very cute and pretty, but did not last me one day without breaking."
2.0,These started to come apart after very little use. Very disappointed. Would not recommend.
2.0,"I usually like Spsnx as a brand, and love their underwear shorts style (under skits, as skirt slips always roll up, but these did not fit well at all. I guess I should have paid more attention to the word &#34;crop&#34; too. They did not even fully cover my ankles, and at 5'2&#34; I need all the leg lengthening styles I can get.  I will try again with s different style, but for now I am moving them along"
2.0,"One of the arms were uneven, still wore them but they broke after a couple of weeks."
2.0,"I really wanted this to work out im 5'0 220lbs my butt is bigger then my top but for some reason the shorts are huge and the top is like a really tiny bra , would also be better if it was cotten and not swimsuit ish material"
2.0,"Yall I can't in good conscience recommend this to anyone... I had to send it back. No support for the top, the material is really cheep and I ordered the white so you could see straight through it. There was no way I could wear it in water if I tried. Looks great in the pic but in person I was so disappointed.."
2.0,I actually really liked the wallet but it's not &#34;rugged&#34; at all. Broke in less than three months due to dropping it on concrete. Disappointed.
2.0,one of the frogs eyes is missing
2.0,"These are a lot smaller and duller than stated, with way too small backs.  You can't even tell you have them on."
2.0,Cheaply made and unattractive. Too stiff for delicate glasses
2.0,"It has very weak and cheap metal that breaks off quite easily, be warned."
2.0,"No matter how much you tighten it, it will loosen up"
2.0,"The fit of this dress is way too big. The colors were flattering and nice, but the dress looked poorly seamed and the fit of this dress was way too oversized to look cute, and was unflattering on my shape. I bought the xs or s (the smallest fit I could find) and it didn’t look like the model at all. I’m 114 lbs."
2.0,Way too small. I would go 1-2 sizes up
2.0,It was deformed.  When my son put it on the face of the mask was contorted.  He couldn't get it to look like the picture at all.
2.0,These briefs are decent quality but they are too small and there is no opening to take a pee. Lame... I was instructed to buy a size larger which I did and they still were way too small.  Bad purchase!
2.0,"A little tighter in the legs and butt than others I have purchased from Target. Ehh, I purchased too many and should have sent them back."
2.0,Returning...too large.
2.0,great -except the handles ripped off. Cheap fabric. still works as a hand clutch. I had to improvise and clip the hooks to the zippers inside.
2.0,CRAP. Definitely made in China for anorexic lil things. If you can get a thigh past the waistline on these &#34;One Size fits all&#34; leggings... Eat a burger!
2.0,Made very  cheap I waited to late to return it
2.0,It's soft and comfy but not very flattering for a curvy body type. Baggy in the waist but then very tight over the thighs. Just kind of like a potato sack up top for me. The length is too short because my butt takes up soo much surface area.
2.0,I don't like the feel of them. The material is not soft at all. Would have returned if I didn't already wash!
2.0,"While this ring is very pretty, I personally don't find it particularly comfortable to wear. It's a little bulky, and I'm just not used to that. However, I won't give it back, and will wear it on occasion and hopefully get used to the feel."
2.0,Got caught in my hair and broke a arm off the first week. Not sure if they are strong enough for everyday use.
2.0,So disappointed in this top.  The XL fits more like a medium . . . . or maybe I just received a very poorly cut/sewn top.
2.0,I got a small but it fits like a medium
2.0,"Very cute but, to large for little people."
2.0,Was way too big and after a week the words faded.
2.0,"Good watch, but sent it to the jewlers to get sized and they can't pop a link out! They are going to look for a new band, but if the band is more than the watch cost it will be junked!"
2.0,Not as comfortable as expected.....seams still dig in
2.0,Thin material. I ordered size small and it fits like a medium/large.
2.0,"Very poor quality material, and did not fit body right at all. Looked like a bag lol"
2.0,"When I looked at this wallet, I thought that I would be able to choose the text on the side. It LITERALLY says &#34;Forever Friend Your Choice&#34; underneath the bow.... Why would I want a wallet that says that? The bow is cute, it has decent quality, and the inside is pink with white polka dots. I gave it to my daughter to use for her change and fake credit cards but there is no way that I feel comfortable using it myself. I was disappointed because I had high hopes for it.<br />I did receive this product at a discounted price from the seller in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
2.0,"I really want to love the skirt because it fits well and the material is thick and smooth,  but...... The pattern on the seams on the sides don't match up and the skirt is a funky print.  Looks terrible unless someone is directly in front of you or behind you."
2.0,I bought this for my son. It is the right size but on the first day the band came undone. Even after gluing it it has can undone twice. I wish the ends of the cords were finished off better. The rubber covers do not stay put.
2.0,The material is cheap polyester...I do not recommend
2.0,"The strap looks good and seems to be made well. However, It's very loose on my wrist even when it's cinched up to it's shortest length. It's a NATO-like band made with elastic, so I was expecting something that would fit all wrist sizes, but this isn't the case. If you have small wrists you should shop around and look for something shorter in length.<br /><br />After wearing it for a few hours and having the dial end up on the bottom of my wrist every few minutes, I've decided to return it."
2.0,"I ordered this scarf for myself ,found it too narrow in width....otherwise beautiful"
2.0,"These are not attractive, and they are hard to get on and off.  Cannot recommend."
2.0,The material is great but it would be nice to receive a clean one. Opened the packaging and it had black marks all over it.
2.0,the underwear fit great but the bra was too tight
2.0,They run so short. If you are 5'10 or are around 5'10  do not buy them.
2.0,So sad the optical quality the lenses are really good one pair lasted two weeks the other one is hanging on ..but I've had to use some super glue. The return window passed since the extra pair I purchased was...an extra pair and just intended as a back up.
2.0,"Update - lens are now a month or so old and have lost the mirror coating in multiple spots on both lenses. Have revised my rating to 2 stars from 5.<br />Went in the frame well, nice balance of not too light, not too dark, clarity is very good. Can’t really weigh in the the long term durability but for the price they are hard to argue with."
2.0,The cups are not sown correctly. Bra too small
2.0,The dress was cute but the size was not even close to standard sizing. I ordered a 3x which is what I wear in all other brands.  The sizing was a big disappointment that came at a time when I didn't have time to exchange it before the event I unwanted it for
2.0,"Love the product, actually got it for a nursing bra and it can be just moved to the side the material is so soft and thin. And for this it works great. However,  the first time I used it the very thin underwire worked it's way out of one side of the bra constantly, which was painful and awkward. Especially since I bought this to wear in public under nicer clothes so I didnt look like a massive uni-boob. So at my son's baptism and the family gathering after I felt like a monkey picking at my side boob as I constantly had to work the sharp underwire back into the casing. It's like they forgot to sew that end. Other than that its great,  beautiful color, soft material... but constant shanking really kills it for me."
2.0,It fits small in length. Came with no packing slip to return it. Isn't made well.
2.0,"There's no hint of argan oil that this bonnet claims to have. When I'd get them in the past from the beauty supply store, I'd at least smell the argan oIL treatment in it."
2.0,2 earrings have already broken for no reason. It's a couple days past return date so now stuck with these.
2.0,"The dress is very pretty and the length is nice, not too short. However the sizing is ridiculous. I am not sure why they say it runs small. I ordered the small because they said it ran small. It was massive! Assuming that the dress must have been labeled wrong and just wanting to be sure, I ordered the XS. The dresses are almost the exact same. If you have any waste at all, I do not believe this dress will fit you. I am 5'3&#34;, weigh 108 lbs and I could have fit another person in both the S and XS. Maybe I got two faulty dresses. I don't know. You can see in the pictures how much extra fabric there is. Yikes! It really is very pretty though."
2.0,Item arrived with the chain being tangled up in a ball and took a while to untangle but the product itself was pretty<br /><br />EDIT: Also discovered the constellation for Leo on the necklace isn't even accurate!!! Wouldn't reccomend.. do the research of what the constellations look like first which was my mistake
2.0,There ok but not exactly the ones we expected. To long so we had to cut them short
2.0,I have a 38c chest.  I usually wear a large.  This jacket is a nice light weight jacket.  It is partially line which makes it a good choice for the spring or summer.  It however runs very small.  It is extremely tight in the shoulders. It is also very tight in the elbow and bicep area.  The stretch fabric is a nice plus.  If you chose to order this product I would order it at least 1 size larger than you usually wear.<br /><br />This product was provided to me at a discount rate for the purposes of review..
2.0,Quality isn't as good. The lace is very thin.
2.0,Returned these.
2.0,"So, these earrings were fairly inexpensive but I don’t think I’ll be wearing them. They have a very poorly placed and crinkly cellophane too that makes them really distracting. Forget talking on a phone with them. The “fish” inside are not at all goldfish-like. I was really disappointed with the overall effect."
2.0,After 1 wear the knees completely wore out making these leggings a waste of money. I'm so annoyed
2.0,"Very weird fit for boys, wasn’t very happy."
2.0,Dislike you can see the white underlining through the pants.
2.0,I was so excited to get this but when it arrived I was very disappointed.  I ordered a woman's large and it is cut very strange.  It fit in the shoulders but the arms were very very wide and approximately five to six inches too long.  The length of this is enormous.  I am 5'7 and it came almost to my knees.  I could not return it because I washed it to see if I could shrink it some.  It seems to be irregular or something and the fabric is too heavy.
2.0,Feels cheap. Stitching on sides are bar
2.0,I was not a fan of the material used so returned. I expected a linen feel but it felt and looked cheap.
2.0,"Just shy of 2 months old and the lens literally popped out while driving! Love them, but now are totally ruined! I have bought Walmart sunglasses that lasted longer!! Not to mention the horrible distraction it was while driving!! So sad and disappointed."
2.0,Received months LATE! The material not quite what I expected.
2.0,Seams opened on one pair before it was worn.  Other pairs developed holes after being worn only a few times.  Disappointed.
2.0,"not even the white, navy, gray depicted.  not even the same stripe pattern.  All Navy stripes on white."
2.0,The only thing about the dress that is like the photo is the color and the length. The shape of the dress is nothing like the one shown in the picture!! This dress looks more like a nightgown than I prefer. The material is thin. The shape is not sexy like the one in the picture. It was sewn together without care (the stitches are coming undone near the pockets before it’s even been worn). The plastic on the straps is very cheap quality and looks very breakable. I’m 5’2” and 146 pounds. I bought a medium. Do with that info what you like. I’m disappointed most of all by the fact that the style of the dress is completely different than the one pictured.
2.0,"Poor seam work in comparison to the other dress I purchased for about the same price. Lovely color, but that's about it. The whole design is a swing and a miss. Ironically, doesn't work well for a curvy girl, which is contrary to what you would think for the design. I typically wear about a 4 in dress. I have an hourglass shape with bust/hips and waist being the defined 10&#34; difference and this dress just could not lay down the right way. I wouldn't wear it for a real event. I ended up trying to return, but missed the return date so I'll hang onto it for costume purposes or possibly donate it to my father's theater department. Not for long term wear, for sure. Super disappointed."
2.0,The fit is so weird and the material makes it look cheap
2.0,"Nice to look at but not up to the job. Clip does not hold well making it likely to be lost.  I still need to find a closure clip device for my capes and shawls. Too bad. Good idea and look , crummy clamp."
2.0,Diamond missing can't wear them
2.0,The fit is ok but the fabric is strange. It’s accumulates a lot of static and feels more like a blanket than a shirt. The neck is also very high.
2.0,I had high hopes for these socks. I'm unable to wear closed toe shoes or socks in the winter because my feet get too warm... too sweaty... then I get very cold chills and the only thing that warms me up again is getting barefoot. These socks are very large - I'm a women's 6.5 and they didn't stretch around my foot at all. So they just kinda wadded up in my shoes - very uncomfortable. I was willing to put up with that if they could actually keep me from getting the cold chills but that didn't happen. If they had fit properly I might of tried them as a sock liner but suspect that wouldn't have worked either - I probably need a completely different kind of solution. Sadly I returned these.... and will continue my quest to be able to wear closed toe shoes in the winter.
2.0,"This is the kind of baseball hat you can buy at a craft store for as little as two or three dollars. The design on the hat is as pictured and it looks cute from a distance, but this hat is simply not worth what they are asking, especially with the added cost of shipping."
2.0,Dislike advertising on items didn't show names on them when show
2.0,Strap sown together twisted on one side.
2.0,They are beautiful but some of the stones were missing in a couple of them but over all I love them
2.0,I am a dd and a size 12 and the size was very tight and unforgiving.
2.0,Loved this dress but.... i wore it for my rehersal dinner and 3 hours later the elastic came loose and the sleeves were just hanging. SO DISAPPOINTED!!! Because i loved the dress 😔
2.0,The smell was awful and the belt/accessories were flimsy and tore easily. I had to find a different black body suit and glue in the pieces that fell off the belt
2.0,I love the look of this top but unfortunately if you sweat it really shows up and clings to your body which is not a good look for me!
2.0,the material is not of good quality.
2.0,I did not like these but I cannot return them because my sister took them from me. She liked them so that's why I'm giving this 2 stars.
2.0,This is a beautiful anklet and I love the butterflies but I’ve found that they randomly fall off. I have a total of one butterfly left in my anklet
2.0,"I love the design on this shirt, but it is too short and slightly too small. If it shrinks at all, it will not be wearable."
2.0,"Took a month and a half to arrive. Can hardly wear it because the material causes irritation and makes my wrist itchy. I even had a few different people try it on to make sure I just wasn't allergic to the material, but they also said it made them uncomfortable and irritated as well. The bracelet is also quite large, it'll fit well on a larger males wrist (at least the ones who tried it) but not so well on a smaller wrist. Overall a bit disappointed because it looks great but wearing it is not worth the irritation."
2.0,This is more of an athletic material verses a cotton sweatshirt. I haven’t worn yet but might if I decide to work out one day .
2.0,"This was a gift for my 16yr old daughter, who loves raccoons.  The details were beautiful and she loved it.  Broke after 1 week of light wear around the house and she was sad/disappointed.  I can not return as I don't have any packaging."
2.0,Well constructed but too small. I find my shoe rubs on my skin because the sock doesn't come up far enough.
2.0,"Chain is short. Necklace is pretty cheap looking/feeling. Overall it's ok, but wish the chain was much longer."
2.0,"I own a long-sleeved tunic very similar to this in the same brand which I love. I assumed the short sleeve version would fit similarly, but sadly it did not. Both tunics fit similarly in the shoulders and bust, and both flared out towards the bottom which I expected with this style. However, the short sleeved version was 2-3” shorter in length, and the bottom flared out to a MUCH wider width. The long sleeved tunic camoflauges my tummy pooch, but this short sleeve tunic was so voluminous it just looked like a maternity top on me. It was also just barely long enough to wear with leggings.<br /><br />For reference, I am 5’5”, 140 lbs, 32D, and ordered a size S in the black and white print. (I usually wear a S in Misses sizes.)"
2.0,I like the concept of the dress and it fits as expected but the quality isn't there. Cheaply made buttons don't really match the dress.
2.0,Came fairly quickly and the texture and overall look of the mask is good. If it wasn’t so fragile. It came in a box thankfully but still was cracked inside the beak part. I also had to redo/make custom knots on the strings so it could be actually worn. Otherwise not too bad.
2.0,"Cheap material, more translucent than you would expect and fell apart quickly. Might as well save yourself the trouble and order on ali where you can find these cheaper."
2.0,"These fit so SMALL and so LONG for this brand! I love Celebrity Pink’s skinny jeans but these are really just weirdly cut and would be unwearable without a lot of tailoring. I’m 5’7, 130ish and normally wear between a 5 but not even the 7 of these were right for me."
2.0,Thought it was cute but didn't glow.
2.0,Fits good the glasses will not stay up when riding I would order one without glasses
2.0,"I wanted gold posts, not gold earrings with steel posts.  That does my metal allergy no good.  They are however quite lovely and if you’re not shopping with a metal allergy in mind I’m sure you’ll like them.<br />Can’t return them to Kohl’s for whatever reason either so they are not convenient to return."
2.0,They don't look like the picture. The frames are Much wider!
2.0,My son has a 5 o’clock shadow. He wears the mask for a 12 hour shift and then has to fly home on an airplane.  Sometimes he has the mask on for 16-18 hours. He talks a lot with the mask on teaching in the hospital research lab. The inside is the mask pills.
2.0,Black tank came dirty with hair on it and a pull on the shirt. Was probably a return and they just sent it out to me. Good fit on the other two I received
2.0,"Not bad, but look cheap ones..."
2.0,They stretch out terribly
2.0,The picture definitely makes this shirt look better than it really looks in person. The material is very odd and uncomfortable. It’s not in my opinion anywhere close to being a sweatshirt.
2.0,Enviaron la talla que tenían . No me gusto la calidad
2.0,"Cute but arrived with messed up mood changing liquid. It was a gift and I should have looked at it better before giving it, otherwise I'd return it. It stayed a yellow/brown color.  But the panda was cute and wasnt overly big"
2.0,I buy this jacket for my daughter birthday not happy with the material is not really a good quality I not recomend this product
2.0,"I was eagerly waiting for this product to wear for a wedding event, but unfortunately the top didn't fit. I got a medium. The skirt is beautiful and so is the material. But the top doesn't work well for larger chests (DD+). I do think they should make the top longer so it covers below the breast area. I don't really know what to do with the top now so I'm pretty bummed. I had bought two of these in different colors. :/"
2.0,"It's a nice shirt but if you are over 5'7"" don't even bother! I ordered this for my husband who is 6'3"" and the sleeves are extremely short on him! He is a medium build and in shape so sizing up would not help. Will be returning!"
2.0,Great for kids only ! I’m 5’4 and They are way too short.
2.0,Really cute at first.  Then brand name fell off of the one side and was really obvious.  Smooth return process.
2.0,"Cute idea but didn't fit me at all!  Way to long, but I am pretty short."
2.0,"its ok, ship material"
2.0,"I  reviewed these more fully under the acorn color. Bottom line is they are not very durable and do not seem to keep a person any cooler than other breaches. Mine were destroyed after the first day, but I was on a trip, so I had to wear them twice. Then they went into the trash. Not suitable for trail riding or chores."
2.0,3 of these scarves were beautiful how ever one of them had a hole and that's really annoying cause I played for 4 whole scarves not 3
2.0,While the case seems durable and strong I am highly disappointed in the quality of the Marauders Map printed on it. The design is very blurry and hard to read. Such a disappointment......
2.0,It is so small.  And the chain is to thin.
2.0,The material and style was great! The fit was not! I usually wear a 1X-2X . I ordered a 3X and the sleeves are way too tight! Poor design there!
2.0,I know they are midi but real small
2.0,The shirt itself is great but 1 can sliced across the mid section. I tried to reach out for a replacement but cannot get ahold of the seller. Disappointed!
2.0,Too small doesn't stretch
2.0,"sheer, short, barely even a belt more like a ribbon and buckle, same for the side pocket clasps too, which are the only pockets on these pants"
2.0,It was smaller than expected...tighter than I like through chest and back.
2.0,"My wrists are small and yet, it's too small. The band of beads are not shiny but dull."
2.0,"I thought these were going to be nylon braided cords like the one I have, they are rubber with a braided designed imprinted on it. Braided is misleading."
2.0,I ordered a up size and they still were too small.
2.0,Cute top but very poorly made and runs big. I wear a small and it was too loose around my torso. The overall quality of the product is poor. The straps are coming un-sewn after just trying on the top. The material also reminds me of swimsuit material...not something I would work out in. Do not recommend.
2.0,It was broke when I got it in the mail. The starfish was not connected with the ring.
2.0,"I thought this mask is for kids- the option I used for searching the mask is “sonic mask for boys kids”<br /><br />Then this one came up- I need to have this ASAP and I just bought it. Upon putting in the gift wrap, I saw that it is for adult size. Unfortunately this is not gonna be used as a gift."
2.0,"If I’m honest, I got these to wear under my short tight dresses but. BUT. If you have thick thighs they’re no good. I like to wear shorts under skirts and dresses because my thighs rub but these just needed to be a bit longer. These end up rolling up my thigh and my thighs end up rubbing anyways. Not what I needed them for"
2.0,"They aren’t true to size,"
2.0,"Set the watch to the correct time and the watch doesn't keep time. Bummer too, it looks stunning."
2.0,I wear a medium and this was large in fit.  Looks good on model but not me.  Very gathered and makes hip and me look bigger than I am.
2.0,looked to Mexican
2.0,I ordered biggest size which is 3x it's not a 3x!!!! More like a L
2.0,"Crap, thin metal, obnoxiously large."
2.0,I love the color and softness of this sweater.  But the seam at the neck came apart at the first washing.
2.0,"Loved the color, the style, the logo, and everything else about this cap. Really wanted it to work. The strap in the back definitely extends far enough for my large head, but the front of the cap does not stretch hardly at all, and is not wide enough for my large head. Very disappointing that the rear strap allows for larger heads, but the front of the cap doesn't. 5 stars for cosmetic design and looks, minus three stars for fitment and structural design. I am returning mine."
2.0,The material looks very cheap. The white you can see through
2.0,"The fabric is not what I consider to be linen.  It more like a thick gauze.  It was thin but not see through.  The only real problem I had was it was very short.  I am only 5""1"" and it hit me at the top of my hips.  Not at all what is in the picture. I will be returning. :-("
2.0,Seam ripped after three wears.  Thin material and poor quality.
2.0,This came to me tarnished.  I don't think it's real silver.  I didn't look until after the return window.  I guess it was cheap for good reason.
2.0,Too small. Tiny tiny look dorky
2.0,"This is the first and last time I buy cheap sunglasses here. I am surprised the didn’t break because that box was just smashed as you can see on my pictures. Completely cheap feeling, and not well made. They are not even at all."
2.0,"In theory, this was really cute. In reality, not so much.<br /><br />First of all, it's really long in the back. Really, really long. Much longer than I expected.<br /><br />The front? Short in comparison. Although this is shown as a dress, the one I received as a gift could not be worn that way.  In the front of the shirt, there were a few inches between the bottom of the fabric and the last button, so the material could easily open. That opening landed right at the... well, let's just call it the lower part of your underwear.  If you wore it as a dress-- from the front-- you would be revealing a lot more than what you might want.<br /><br />Overall, the fabric was OK; it's not a heavy flannel at all. The buttons were hard to close as if they were sewn too tightly.  The front pockets also seemed to be placed too high. It was a gift and is being returned."
2.0,"Not at all happy with this product. The pictures looked exactly what I was wanting but it turned out nothing like what is pictured. Disappointing, I did send it back without problems or questions asked which was very nice.<br />JFK"
2.0,"Super cute, nice light material, but extremely small in the arms shoulders, and chest. And I'm only a B"
2.0,Looked nice online got it late and seems very cheaply made. And the faces lol longer knock off emojis
2.0,"i like the dress but the zipper is no good, and i  cant retune the dress. this is not good"
2.0,The colors are pale and mediocre.  Rasta colors are usually bright and vibrant.  Really disappointed.  I only purchased because I wanted to give my rastafarian friend as a gift.  Overpriced piece of cloth
2.0,"Purchased 2 pairs to take on vacation. The arm of the first pair broke within 2 days. I've been using the other pair for about a month, but just know they're definitely flimsy and not polarized. The packaging was really nice though."
2.0,I have worn a size 10 since high school All my shoes are size 10 Your size 10 is not right  These are too small<br /> I'm not sure they would be comfortable if they did fit right.
2.0,Cheaply made but looks nice
2.0,"The style is cute and I like the fit. I’m curvy so I like that I can tie the dress tighter to exentuate my small waste. However, I also weight lift so my arms are a tad bit larger. The sleeves cut the circulation off on my arms and no matter how much I try I can’t get them to stretch out. The middle seam on the dress was also lobsided. So it was sloppily made and the material isn’t very comfortable. This definitely isn’t worth the price it’s being sold for."
2.0,"Size isnt accurate, was cheaper to give away tayher then return"
2.0,These look so cute on but after a few washes the fabric hasn’t held up. It’s fading and pilling terribly. Would not buy again.
2.0,Product seems good but the lenses came scratched. Very hard to see through but other than that seems like a good product.
2.0,These look like they are for a child.  They are really small.
2.0,Lock was loose I end up losing it
2.0,"Nice, but pewter is much too soft to hook this onto anything without it bending when you go to grab it.  I have this on the end of my pocket watch and I hook it to my vest, but it is even too soft for that.  Other than that, the design of the dragon head is very detailed."
2.0,"Looks good, but could hardly see out of the lenses."
2.0,I got my package today and I was so excited because I bought them to wear to a wedding but didn’t get what i expected. I have a 28 inch waist and the small fit perfectly but these pants are not made for tall women. I’m 5’8 and the pants only went to my calve muscle. If you are petite these may be perfect but not for anyone over 5’0maybe 5’2
2.0,"I bought two pairs of these and neither lasted. They may be fine if you get them for a light-duty application, but these do not make good work gloves.<br />  First, The insulation on these just crushes and makes them way too loose. The first pair I got was a Large and after only a week they were uselessly loose. So I got a pair in Medium and they were a little better, but the insulation crushed  thin again and within a few days they were pretty loose too. I decided to give them a chance anyway, but they just fell apart over the next few weeks and after about a month, I'm giving up on them.<br />  As far as far as warmth goes, these are okay. I work outside in Pennsylvania. These work fine when it's above 20 degrees, but it gets much colder here and I definitely wished I had had something better once or twice.<br />  I wouldn't say my job is especially rough on gloves, but I do use my hands for every part of my job. These just aren't work gloves. The first pair didn't get used enough to wear out, so they're still fine and I'll use them for a backup. But now I'm back to shopping for another pair for daily use."
2.0,Didn't really like it. Wasn't the material I expected and looks different than the picture. Just looks a bit cheap looking
2.0,Will be returning these - they run way too small.
2.0,"Nice, but be careful, it runs too small."
2.0,Did not sit straihjt on face
2.0,the jewels came off after I had had it for about 2 weeks... don't buy it.
2.0,To Large.  Quality of chain is poor.
2.0,I do not like the way it fit  strap keep falling off
2.0,"Yes it arrived pretty soon, however, it was too wide and short. Didn't realize it was a &#34;crop top&#34;.  Thought it gave off the idea it would cover your belly."
2.0,Can't order by size chart.  Check measurements and had to order one size smaller.
2.0,muy chica
2.0,"When we opened the suit one of the straps had come unseen so I resewed it. About an hour after putting the suit on, one of the plastic clips that holds the shoulder strap had stretched to the point that it would no longer hold the strap. It’s a beautiful suit, wish it were made better! May buy replacement pieces so that we can keep it and make it work."
2.0,I spent so much time researching dresses and the sellers before buying a wedding dress. This dress had some good reviews so I took a chance. FIRST off the design is not like the picture. Under the chest it looks crescent moon shaped that tapers down the sides. The ACTUAL seem on the dress is STRAIGHT across....NOT FLATTERING AT ALL! Secondly the rhinestones are NOT the same as in the picture!!! They are silver looking beads that FROM A DISTANCE might reflect light and give an APPEARANCE of a rhinestone. Please think twice before buying from this seller.
2.0,Don't like them..way to small ..take picture down ..an take picture with them in the box..then people will know what there getting
2.0,I ordered the product expecting it to look crisp but there was white sticky residue on the package and the print looks faded.
2.0,The chest is too tight.
2.0,"These were cute so I'm really disappointed. The stick part that goes in your ear is slightly thicker than any average earring. It doesn't seem like a lot, but you can feel it! It felt like gauging my ears. Also, one of the earrings would not clasp shut. They seem like decent quality material so if you have larger holes and happen to get a pair that works, these would be great earrings."
2.0,"If you’re well-endowed, this is not the top for you. I’m a 36DD and I ordered an XL.. my chest shows through the bottom of the top and there is a lot of cleavage on top. Would not recommend"
2.0,Not the best fabric. I had to return this item.
2.0,arrived falling apart lucky i had a glue gun to put it back together
2.0,"In my seemingly never-ending quest to find attractive and comfortable yet also effective face masks to wear in public as the COVID-19 pandemic lingers in the US and around the world, I decided to give these masks from Jeelow a try. As you've probably guessed, my evaluation follows.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br />1. The masks are, as promised by Jeelow, made out of a comfortable, breathable mesh-like material<br />2. In compliance with the current guidelines from health experts, the masks are constructed with two layers of fabric and thus have the POTENTIAL to provide a highly effective barrier against COVID-19<br />3. The masks' ear loops are adjustable and thus aid in making the masks better fit the wearer<br />4. The masks are available in a variety of attractive colors and patterns<br /><br />THE BAD<br />1. In spite of their adjustable ear loops, the masks never seem to fit snugly against the face, and their effectiveness as a barrier against COVID-19--both for the wearer and for those in the wearer's proximity--is thus dubious<br />2. The masks are on the small side, so contrary to the product pics here on Amazon, they do not cover the average adult's face from the bridge of the nose to the bottom of the chin, and this adds to the dubiousness of the masks' effectiveness in battling the spread of COVID-19<br /><br />THE UGLY<br />1. The sewing together of the masks' two layers of fabric was done somewhat haphazardly, and since the inner fabric layer for each of the masks is white and does not match the color or pattern of the outer layer, this detracts from the aesthetics of the masks (especially the ones with a dark-colored outer layer of fabric)<br />2. The vertical seams on the front center of the masks were also sewn haphazardly, and the result is some unattractive wrinkling or puckering in the fabric immediately adjacent to the seams<br /><br />My final verdict? While these masks are, despite the evident sewing faux pas, somewhat attractive, they are simply too small for the average adult and therefore will not provide adequate protection against COVID-19 or other airborne nasties. (It is possible that the masks will fit the faces of children, but why take the chance?) So if you're looking for aesthetically pleasing face masks that will also serve as effective COVID-19 barriers, I must strongly suggest you keep searching."
2.0,This product is so cute but ran so small! Had to return!
2.0,way too thin and stiff material
2.0,I bought this for my mom and she had to glue it back together when it arrived and I was very disappointed. This was a birthday gift and was not expecting her to have to put in effort to be able to wear the necklace
2.0,The socks are little small and very thin. For cotton socks I think they need to be thicker. But I have had a hard time getting 100% cotton socks and you can't beat the price.But I would definitely pay more for made in America 100% cotton socks
2.0,Jewels fall off too fast.
2.0,Only had about two weeks and paint started coming off😫
2.0,U get what you pay for.  I ordered one for myself and 1 for a friend.  They looked tarnished and looked used
2.0,The bow fell off the same day.
2.0,"I ordered 2 of these I'm different colors and the first fit great and exactly as expected but these ones were a completely different fit and not at all close to the size I ordered. They were way too small but also very uneven with the waist being average (but smaller than the size I ordered) an the thighs being very loose but the legs are extremely tight. They were also very, very short."
2.0,Real clear but we're much bigger than I thought. Bought 1.5mm recently just Avery little too small thought 2.5 would be perfect but at least 4 times bigger
2.0,They run small. I use the bell rogue helmet. These do not fit inside. And are not comfortable in or out of a helmet.
2.0,"I am a curvy but big girl with a tripe D bust and the size I got def couldve been smaller. But the overall dress was a disappointment. Its hit and miss with ANY seller and or brand, so its NO reflection on the seller. I just didnt like the dress. Paper thin and very very cheap in quality, which, happens half the time with these Amazon dresses for larger women. I noticed more often than not, better quality is made in the much smaller sizes. Im sending back."
2.0,"This dress is made of good-quality fabric (although lined would be nicer) and seems to be well-made. The picture is adorable BUT the dress came with puff sleeves. Like, Anne of Green Gables puff sleeves. The picture does not have puff sleeves. The picture has nice, sleek shoulders that doesn't compete with the cute retro collar. The dress doesn't look cute and retro, it looks like I'm heading to a square dance (I'm sure square dancing is fun, and if I was going to a square dance, I would enjoy wearing this dress...but there are no square dances at my office). Very sad it didn't work out, it's so cute on the model."
2.0,Nice but not real Leather.
2.0,This dress looks cute on the model but isn't as cute in person.  It is super thin showing every detail of your bra.  It also is low in the underarm area. The color was different than shown too.
2.0,"Very weird fit...or maybe it's me, but I doubt it.  Way too small and smushy."
2.0,Silver plating started coming off on one of the post earrings after wearing one day. Irritated my ears. The hook earrings are good so far.
2.0,"The bracelet is nice and a true 9"" bangle but it is nopt brown.  It is a light rusty orange not the brown pictured."
2.0,i ironed this dress before i even got to wear it and it burned a hole right through it so
2.0,"Received wrong pair. Only received one pair that looked as advertised, its ok... BUT the 2nd pair was obviously  a different style, more masculine, i was very disappointed.  Cant give it 3 stars because the entire order received was not as described."
2.0,"Many defective ones in the package.  I got these for classroom prizes.  The reason I gave 2 stars is that the ones that do work are REALLY cool and bright, however many (at least 10 in the package) did not work, or quit working right away.  While they are cheap, I wouldn't buy again."
2.0,My son wore this one time and the seam on the sleeve unraveled leaving a 10 inch opening.  We returned it for being poorly made
2.0,"THIS IS NOT A MASK TO WEAR WHEN INTERACTING WITH OTHER PEOPLE.<br /><br />Take a lighter, hold it 6"" away from your face, blow out as hard as you can. This not blocking airborne pathogens. If I can blow the flame out as a 10 year light smoker, you're going to blow it out. It is super cute but is for aesthetic purposes only."
2.0,You get what you pay for.  It'll work for the night I need it but I probably won't use it again. It looks very cheap
2.0,The belted part is merely for looks and does not actually cinch in anything. I was very disappointed since my son is thin.
2.0,I was so upset when I received these and realized there not even real PUMA's.<br />They say POMA. Omg!
2.0,"Hinge is broken. I have to drive 22 mules away to get ""free"" returns. That means a bus ride.  It's not free. I will gave to pay 31$ to get it repaired.  Disgusted.<br /> M.  Illinois"
2.0,"Already received a pair like these,.. exactly the same. At least the pic shows they're not ""round"". It's still confusing. Pearls like these are used in settings, because of their flat back. The fact that you charge the same amount as the others selling a whole, round pearl is wrong. People, beware."
2.0,"This medium is really a large fit.<br />I am 5' 6"" weighing approx 140 lbs. It was way too big."
2.0,The arms fit very strange. It was made wrong. One arm is way too tight and the other is loose.
2.0,"I am 5'11"", 165lbs. I ordered the medium and it was a bit big on me. I guess for a costume it would be fine, otherwise it felt and looked real cheap."
2.0,It looked fake.
2.0,Thin skimpy fabric ! looks very inexpensive
2.0,"I bought the light blue marl leggings it because they looks like GS, but I couldn’t get over the itchy fabric and heavy feeling of these leggings. I didn’t wash them so maybe that goes away, but decided to return and not use it for the gym because they were too uncomfortable. I did like the color and cut, just not for me."
2.0,It fix directly under my bust. I was very disappointed. The size is not accurate at all. It runs small
2.0,The gloves are warm but they were not long enough or snug enough for my liking and the thumbs are ridiculously long ( a good inch longer than they should be).
2.0,This hat is lightweight and has a longer bill than most regular hats BUT the part of the hat that goes on your head is small I don’t have a big head) so the fit is off and looks odd.
2.0,"not as expected, one of the downfalls to buying online"
2.0,Had iron on letters and football was super small had to order another one but bigger in size
2.0,Great for an A or B cup.
2.0,"Odd Fit, not worth the price"
2.0,"Bras are not supportive, but are comfortable.  The green bra is very bright, you may want to keep in mind when considering what you'll wear with it.  The green bra also had some &#34;dry rot&#34; stretch to it the first time I put it on. Offers a lovely uniboob look. Pads do not stay put in pockets.  I am not impressed.  I got what I paid for."
2.0,The colors were not as pictured.
2.0,"Jacket fits nicely, and worked well at first. However after walking in heavy rain once it seems to have lost the waterproof coating. I still use it over a hooded sweatshirt for light rain, but kind of defeats the purpose."
2.0,The filter is below the nose it doesn’t give you full coverage or even through the filter to protect yourself it’s a shame because I’m a big Dunkin’ Donuts fan and that’s the reason I bought it  dose not fit very well even if you tighten it
2.0,"Pretty, not well tailored."
2.0,Very cheap. All the stones fell out within a week. And it irates the nose.
2.0,"This necklace is very pretty however the gemstone is too small and the diamond chips are almost non-existent!  This looks like a child's necklace given the size.  I am returning -  very disappointed, especially for the price.  I have it 2 stars bc it is very pretty and the chain is lovely.  It's just so small."
2.0,"Runs quite small. The colors are really pretty, and the quality is decent enough for the price."
2.0,"I would give 2.5 stars because the fit is good, with plenty of room, but the material is so thin it’s not even as tough as cheap denim. Ripped them my 2nd wear by barely catching them on the corner of a sheet of plywood."
2.0,"Items did not equally match, as in finish and size.  Some posts felt like 18 gage and others 16. Some edges were not finished. Heart shaped earrings, the ones I really wanted, bent while I was putting them in."
2.0,The large fits like a small/medium they need to size this properly. Waste of money and couldn’t wear it. Does not fit like the picture.
2.0,Well there was good and bad. The good: it fit... it came on time and looked like the picture. The bad: it was an awkward shirt where the straps cut in towards my neck so the frame of the criss-cross looked really strange. It was as if they did the same size criss cross for every size so if you bought an x-large you had the criss-cross of a small. After wearing it once the straps broke in the wash and I just tossed it. It wasn't even worth saving... I never even got a photo of it because it frustrated me to even look at myself wearing it.
2.0,"Purchased the XL at beginning of pregnancy.  At that time an XL or XXL in most other brands was a good fit.  These wouldn't even go all the way on, had to be returned.  By comparison, at 8months pregnant, still wearing the 1X leggings from motherhood maternity very comfortably.  Probably fine leggings if you are small enough to wear them.  Company handled my return promptly, so no complaint about customer service."
2.0,"I bought this as a gift for a 5-year old, and the bow is HUGE!!!  Thank goodness it is removeable!  Disappointed!"
2.0,Came with one nose piece missing.  Not even in the package
2.0,Although well made all the pieces of the wolf system did not fit well into the boxes. Each tray could not be easily removed which is a problem when the trays should stack in the extra deep box. Returned entire system.
2.0,"I received these earrings and noticed that one earring had a piece fallen off on the bag. The piece on the chain was missing, but I was able to add the chain back.still wearable, but worried now that they will fall apart."
2.0,donated them to my nieces dress up box. Even they won't wear them
2.0,Size is not accurate. Too small for a toddler.
2.0,This is not what I had hoped for.  The fabric is very thin and will quickly become rough on the inside.  The outside layer has a slippery feeling that makes it look cheap.  I had hoped for something soft and warm.
2.0,"Okay, I NEVER EVER EVER write Amazon reviews, but I felt the need to quickly do one for this band. For twelve bucks, I was thrilled with the color and texture of the band when I opened it; however, after about one day of wear, I could hear a crinkle sound when I moved my wrist or removed/put on the watch. When I rubbed my hand over the band, I noticed a plastic/cellophane-like film that was peeling off. The band is solid white underneath with this clear/Iridescent film that creates the iridescent coloring. I superglued the edge that had come loose, but I know its just a matter of time before it begins peeling in a different area. Such a shame because it's lightweight, smooth on the inside, great size, etc. But the band is not iridescent in color - only the film on top."
2.0,"was very thin, small, and felt low quality, amazon return was very quick and easy"
2.0,I’ll be doing a simple seam on this too to make it fit. That seems easier than returning it
2.0,"see my comments:<br /><br />I love them and like the fit, the look, the price and the straight legs were fine but these bootcut yoga pants<br />are just too long...do they come in a shorter person's version? I'm 5'3&#34;"
2.0,The chain was to weak and broke several times
2.0,I am so surprised the reviews didnt mention this at all.. My husband isnt a big guy but this was so tight on his face and neck it felt like it was choking him and his nose was smushed into his face. Thank god it came in a back of 2. I would up cutting some fabric from the second mask to make it bigger.
2.0,Chain clip broke while fastening it so I haven't been able to try it on yet. It's a shiny belt indeed but cheap on the metal links.
2.0,Washed in cold and dried on low and still shrunk significantly. Pretty disappointing.
2.0,"When the children wore the masks at our party, many of the layers of foam began to come off as they were not glued together well."
2.0,Did not like the cut of the pants.  The fabric was not comfortable.  Looked more like scrub pants than casual pants to go out in.
2.0,Beautiful dress unfortunately the under skirt is really short it berly cover my butt and since the upper skirt is tranparent you van see everything wish the under skirt was longer really liked the dress.
2.0,This is my second purchase. I liked the original so much i thought i’d order a spare. After waiting several weeks for delivery i received a hat not fitting the description i ordered. The original is in Navy and the newly purchased appears to be like a denim blue/white spotted pattern. Replacement was not opted so now i must wait for seller to receive my return to issue refund.
2.0,"These leggings are extremely pixelated. I should know better than to order cheap leggings, but they were cute. Much cuter online than in person. They're ok. For $12 it's not worth sending back, but I wouldn't buy them again."
2.0,"Pros: its a great material and quality.  Looked like if I wore them all night long I wouldn't die in pain or worry about falling.  A tall enough heel to be fashionable, but not a super high heel, which I liked.<br /><br />Cons: This runs extremely small.  I am a true 8.5, I can fit in an 8, but its a bit uncomfortable and tight.  These fit more like a 7.5 because I couldn't even get the zipper past the base of my heel."
2.0,"Well, it is plush and nice to the touch, but flimsy. It also has a weird sole design: my feet just keep sliding down to the side, which can cause a serious damage to the ankles... ..."
2.0,"Should have taken other reviews to heart more but I ordered some new sunglasses to pair up with this item because I love fishing and loved the cork feature on the back. These look the part but are only functional with the tiniest of frames. My regular glasses frames will not work with these but as i said, i really like the look so I made my own modification. I had to cut right down the middle to open the holes up and then i used electrial tape to attach to my frames. I want to be able to use it this way but only time will tell how they work with the electrical tape wrap around. Cant see it with black on black but other colors wouldnt look right."
2.0,"Love the cut, but as usual, Asian manufacturers cut their clothing for flat chested woman.  Will they ever learn?  -- Or will I?"
2.0,"Well, I was hopeful this suit would work for me, but it didn't.  I am returning it. Here are the pros and cons I found:<br /><br />Pros: 1) The color is quite nice -- very bright purple/violet blue top, 2) I got a size 16 and it did fit well around the bust and had pretty good support.<br />Cons: 1) The shorts were too loose on me and slid up and down on my thigh. 2) Also, it looks like the shorts in the photo are BLACK, but they are navy blue instead and that didn't seem right to me. 3) The BIGGEST disappointment was that the top hugs your belly in all of the WRONG places!  It made me look pregnant; it also was too clingy on my butt.<br /><br />So disappointed!  It think it's so difficult to know how something will fit until you try it -- we're all slightly different in our shapes and sizes, so you may want to give it a try!?  Maybe the seller should market this bathing suit to pregnant women?!  It could work nicely for them."
2.0,"they attached a sticker on the visor and could not remove it without ruining the visor, I will return it."
2.0,"They are very stiff and have an odd sizing, very wide."
2.0,First I thought this item was wonderful. Unfortunately where the two metal ends come together against the back of my wrist --- breaking me out big time! I can't wear it at all.
2.0,Ordered large it says its a large but its like an extra small it fits my 5 year old daughter
2.0,Too long and sloppy.
2.0,"Just to be clear, this thing is polyester. It feels and smells like one of those 70's all-poly shirts, or maybe a motel housekeeping uniform (just add apron and nametag). It came with creases that you can't get out even by washing. MAYBE you can work a leisure-suit look in it if you have a chunky chain to put on, but it's not much more than one of those Spirit Halloween insta-costumes. It might be OK if it had some way to cinch the waist, but it doesn't. The buttons are super cheapo. I THINK it was maybe manufactured for a woman's body and now they're trying to sell it to all the queens (like me) looking for a cheap onsesie -- the low waistline, which hits my crotch but would fit a woman's shape better, is the giveaway. I do not lie."
2.0,"I was disappointed when this shirt, that cost me $16.99, arrived with Walmart tags on it for $4.97."
2.0,I really made a mistake getting these pants. I took it that they were loose excersize pants but they are not THEY ARE made more like street pants BEWARE NOT MADE LIKE YOUR REGULAR GYM PANTS! I TAKE A 12-14 AND THESE WERE MADE MORE LIKE 10-12!! VERY UNHAPPY WIRH MY PURCHASE. AND TO RETURN YOU HAVE TO ORDER SOMETHING ELSE AND SPEND MORE MONEY FOR NEW GYM PANTS OR WHEN YOU RETURN WAIT TILL MONEY GOES BACK INTO YOUR ACCOUNT TO GET SOMETHING ELSE!! EITHER WAY YOU HAVE TO SPEND MONEY AGAIN! LADIES I WOULD THING TWICE BEFORE I GET THESE PANTS THAT ARE NOT LIKE GYM PANTS AT ALL!! NOT A GOOD PURCHASE.
2.0,Extremely small torso size and thin fabric material I didn’t expect doesn’t do much alone for me
2.0,"There's a reason there aren't many photos in the sale. While this fit great, it did not look anything like the one and only picture advertised once I had it on. I'm returning mine and didn't wear it."
2.0,I purchased this specifically because its advertised as a sideways V.  Its not.<br />I am quite disappointed.
2.0,"Broke the 1st day I wore it. I fixed it then it broke in a different place, will try to fix again."
2.0,Quality is ok. Cute concept but did not fit.
2.0,It grabs my hair. Ouch! Don't get it wet or you have to take it off to dry it. It grabs my hair if I get my arm too close.
2.0,These are awful. The straps fall down constantly and the pads don't stay in place.
2.0,"The bottom of the tankini is unhemmed , this is ugly and unfinished . This might be expected in a cheaper brand., but you’d expect Miracle Suit at their prices to hem their products."
2.0,I wish the tassels didn't swivel
2.0,alittle cheap
2.0,"The reason why I don't like it is because the picture shows that it is fitted. It also says it is one size. So presumably, if it is fitted and it is one size then you would think it would stretch. Well. It does stretch but it does fit. I am 5'5 and 125lb, and 36DD. The dress does flatter me because it is too loose. It doesn't sow the curves like the picture. So one size means its a large that can hang off of you or a large that may fit your curves.Now that I look back at the picture, I think the model hip is out, which will explain a lot.  The dress has no tags what so ever so you don't know how this came to be. The dress looks like a bag with the sleeves.  However, the colors and the material is accurate."
2.0,This is really cheaply made. Doesn’t wash up good and needs to be ironed. Not a good purchase.
2.0,"Update... Loved these when they arrived but every one of them has now broken... simply shattered while in use.<br /><br />Original review... Wonder why the review asks if it fits???  Not something I wear.  That said, very nice shoehorns!  I put one in my gym bag the other on my dresser.  Just the right length and the rubber like loop on the handle works very nicely.  Can not slip my sneakers on without having to untie/tie them!"
2.0,too thin in waist compared to other similar dresses of same size. not cut quite right. print is too... just not good colors together. doesnt look as good as picture.
2.0,"I ordered two of the clip-ons.  The spring between the lenses on one is frozen, while the spring on the other is working.  Because the spring on one works, I gave it two stars, not one.  I will return one pair.  A pain."
2.0,"The color was pretty , but it was too small in the busy area."
2.0,"Loved the color, but it didn't fit the way it's shown on the model.  The pleats at the collar were more bunchy and awkward.  The length was longer than I'd anticipated, also - but that's my bad because I didn't check the measurements before I purchased.  The material was kind of heavy and stiff, and was uncomfortable at the elbows."
2.0,"It's not bad,  but it's not for me. It won't stay in place not even for 5 mins it's moving."
2.0,"This is a great price for a chain mail shirt, and is a hell of a lot easier than making one. However, It is advertised as being stainless steel, and it wasn't. It is made of galvanized steel which is cheaper, heavier, and tarnishes. The links are also prone to falling off, but they are relatively easy to put back on if you have a pair of pliers. I like the shirt itself, but if you buy it just note that it is NOT made of stainless steel and that some of the links probably will fall off."
2.0,These shoes are really cute but they are ruined. There is white stuff all over them. I am very disappointed
2.0,"This thing is tiny.  Does not lay like the image. The the very last circle of each chain it's still tiny. I think I could Hulk rip the chain with 1 neck flex. They are all almost the same length and not durable at all. It looks cute from afar with a nice shine. Probably a waste of money, or I'll dangle them off something decoratively."
2.0,These kept tangling and were smaller than expected. Could only use few of these
2.0,"I really REALLY like how the earrings look, but the clasp is VERY flimsy and barely holds. I’ll probably return them. :("
2.0,I'm a 16. Something told me get a bigger size. Your size chart said 2x is a 18/20. That's a DANG lie.
2.0,"Same general comments as posted by another reviewer. The bangs do not look like they do in the picture and I cant get them to lay straight down. The long hair is also not cut as shown, nor are the bangs cut straight across. The long hair should be longer in the front and shorter in the back which it is not. On top of the obvious hair line issues, I wasn't able to brush or comb out all the hair; it was a tangled mess to start with. The wig was carefully removed from the flat clear bag in which it was shipped but it was badly tangled. I was expecting to put my hand under the  netting, pull the wig from the bag, and have all the hair fall naturally around the sides of the netting but that never happened. I spent two hours trying to comb it out and finished about 3/4's of the job when is it became obvious that the hair line did not match the picture. To get it to look like the picture I would have to be both a hair stylist and a barber. That's too bad. It was just more trouble than it was worth. I wish Amazon had an option for a wig that matched the picture without all the hassle and I would gladly pay a higher price for it."
2.0,Looks nice but it doesn’t fit as a swimsuit should be. It is larger than the tabled size.
2.0,got a hole in the heel within 3 months
2.0,Very cheaply made. No label nor washing tag. Has a strange band at the bottom of the shirt. What you see in the picture is not what you get. The color is a bit different too. Will not order again.
2.0,It will work but its super small. Way too small for me.
2.0,sent it back crystal cracked and scratched
2.0,"Well, initial thoughts are that I am disappointed in the fly snap or closure mechanism.  It looks like very inexpensive thin metal hooks.  No buttons,  no snap in.  Will easily bend and have the pants come undone.  Expected better for a so called winter activity apparel/ clothing.  I haven't worn then yet on my winter gravel bike ride or hike.  Will update afterwards to comment on wear during winter activity."
2.0,I’m a regular size 4/6 and I purchased an 8 to be on the safe side. They were still too small. I have to return them. I still do like the style.
2.0,"I bought these shorts for my daughter who is dancer. She has wore them maybe 1x week for a few hours at a time. I wash all of her dancewear on delicate and hang to dry. After 4 months, the shorts are pilled *everywhere*.  She has a variety of brands of shorts--Lululemon, Balera, etc., and no other brand does this.  I do not recommend."
2.0,Disappointed that this was only an adult size says child/adult got it and it’s adult can’t order in child I have a teen who is 5.5 and way to tall for her arms and awkward as nothing inside the legs (where her arms go ) to hold onto so really can’t move them around to be funny
2.0,"First off, if you are going through shoulder surgery your arm is in a sling and you can only use the other arm. It is impossible to use the snaps on this shirt with one hand (especially the left hand if you are right handed). secondly the snaps are uncomfortable and cold."
2.0,"Disappointing - too tight, short toes."
2.0,The reflection of the light from inner side made me so uncomfortable. Not worth buying it
2.0,The ones that were whole were fine but 16 didn't work or we in pieces. The ones that worked we good....too bad the quality control was do poor.
2.0,"I'm right hand, the claws are only on the left glove. Will be returning."
2.0,"The material in the picture was one red color; the item I received was a multi-color pattern. The advertisement indicated the item would be gift wrapped; the item came in a cheap plastic bag. No, I'm not satisfied, I paid a lot for an item that was not worth the price, quality or packaging advertised."
2.0,"Love these boots, yes there is virtually no arch support however the piles of soft sheepskin fur inside the boot more than makes up for it. I purchased the white color, they are stunning!"
2.0,"I wear a medium. After reviewing the size chart provided, I ordered XL, just in case. The XL would not even go over my thighs. They are well made but definitely undersized."
2.0,"It is hard to get the lights to turn on sometimes. Also, some of mine do not even turn on. Kinda disappointing."
2.0,"Product looks cheaper than implied in the photo. Waist runs VERY big. I’m 5’6”, and  about 185lbs—I bought a Large.<br /><br />There’s a collective 4-5” open gap around the waist; 2” in the front and about 2-3” in the back. It is high waisted, but it’s so loose that it’s irrelevant. If you buy a size down, the thigh area may be to tight, but it does have a decent stretch.<br /><br />Again, I repeat it’s just the WAIST area that runs big, the bottom portion is fine. Pants are very long. Likely meant to be worn with heels.<br /><br />Hope this helps!"
2.0,Was supposed to be for work but both belts were the wrong size! We got a small instead of an XL
2.0,"The actual kurta itself is excellent.  The pants, however.... oh boy.  Do you remember Danny DeVito's Penguin from Batman Returns?  These pants must have been designed for him, and him alone.<br /><br />I'm a 34 waist.  The pants were a size 48, though they do have a generously long drawstring that almost makes the pants wearable.  But then the legs are literally tighter than compression socks.  I have very slender lower legs (some may even say chicken legs), but I had to tear the fabric just to get them over my heel. These are not pants, at least not from the knee down.  They aren't even leggings.  They are tights.  They cling to your legs like a toddler being dropped off at school for the first time.  It borders on indecent.<br /><br />So ... if you happen to have a hilariously massive waist AND impossibly thin legs, these are for you.  But if that's the case, you are probably a mutant.  If, however, you are an actual, living human being with human-ish physical proportions, I suggest tossing the pants in the trash immediately and wearing the kurta with jeans or slacks.  It's a good look."
2.0,I got this necklace as a gift. First off I just want to say it does make a nice decoration. But it's not very well made it's barely square  its very lopsided. The bottom isn't flat it looks like the Tardis is coming off it's base. It's clear this was quickly crafted and with very little care. The Tardis is bigger than I personally expected I most likely didn't read the description well enough when I added it to my wish list. I personally feel like it's to large to wear so I have it dangling off a light switch as a bit of art. If you are looking for a necklace to wear I would say look some place else.
2.0,"Damaged in transit, only got to wear them one day. Got my money back."
2.0,It's feathers glued to card board. Made for a small child
2.0,"Not what I thought at all. I was expecting a stretch ring....this ting has no stretch to it. Luckily, it fits my hand but they sent me the same two rings instead of two different. Who wants two of the same ring?"
2.0,"This necklace by Muaiolaus was not what I expected. The depictions were pretty, but in person it looked a little cheap and haphazard. The chain is sterling silver, and the pendant has a heart-shaped iridescent stone. It is inscribed with “I love you forever,” outlined with small cz stones. The pendant is large, about the size of a nickel and quarter. This would probably look better on an older person than on a middle aged one. In conclusion, I was very underwhelmed and plan to return it."
2.0,"I never wear these because the bumps in the footbed hurt my feet! And they are too loose, so flop around! I would have returned them, but they charge to do it! Never again from this seller!"
2.0,Bought this coat for my 2yr old daughter in a size 3T at first but it was too big so I replaced it for 2T and it’s still too big. The size says XL instead of 2T.
2.0,One of the bracelets was missing the charm
2.0,Looks very different in person. Even larger size is tight. Need at least 2 sizes larger.
2.0,"Blouse was huge, definitely not a large which is my usual size."
2.0,it left a stained on my friends wrist . The watch's color just ran out.
2.0,"Very form fitting. Bought them to be loose. Disappointed, but seems to be a nice product."
2.0,Received wrong color stone.  It looks very fake and easily broken.  Decided to send it back within 10 minutes of opening package.
2.0,larger than expected for the size
2.0,Back hooks to short to reach part of my back.
2.0,It's warm but it is big on me. One size fits all usually means it's big
2.0,"While the gloves are warm, after one week of use, I can definitively say the touch screen tips work at most 10% of the time."
2.0,"Really, really see-through."
2.0,"Very cheap fabric, looks sloppy on."
2.0,"Dress was pretty however poorly made. I ordered the correct size, but the fit was just..... off! :-("
2.0,My necklace broke while trying to out it on. Probably my own fault I have a rather thick neck. I am 5'5&#34; and 160lbs.
2.0,The picture seems miss leading. The dress has this silky material thing going on and that's what made me return the dress.
2.0,"So thin, So poorly made, not even clean cuts on the material. Was looking for something that last for this price and got something that was already fraying because they are cut edges and not himed"
2.0,"Too small, had to return. Sizes run extremely small"
2.0,Sizing was small and not much butt room to use as workout shorts
2.0,Quality wasn't great broke after 2 wears
2.0,First off the sound is VERY LOW and I don't know if it would be heard outside from any distance. The animation of the rubber chain is turtle slow. I really couldn't believe how FAKE it looked. The yellow is way too bright and shiny while the fake blood has a weird color. (looks more like kool aid) This product is cheaply made and like some have said should be sold for around $20 instead of almost $50.I understand it's not a real chainsaw but I do think a little more detail should've been paid to considering the price. Highly disappointed!!!
2.0,Runs too small and doesn’t stay put
2.0,It’s a very pretty dress.  It just had a hole in the side
2.0,"We ordered 3 burgundy velvet bridesmaid's dresses.  Three dresses were delivered in a timely manner but the dresses were the wrong color.  They were red.  The seller said they sent them because they did not have burgundy material but to send them back and they would send the right color.  After the second set of dresses came in, one was the wrong size so we had to ask for another dress.  When that dress finally came in, It was a slightly different shade of burgundy.  Also, the workmanship is very poor.  Velvet has a nap and you have to cut all the dress pieces the same way or you get a different sheen on each piece that was cut wrong like in the picture I attached.  The only reason we kept the dresses is because it was very hard to find what my daughter wanted and the wedding is in the evening so we hope the irregularities in color are not noticed.  I would not work with this seller again and do not recommend their work.  However, the seller was always willing to work with us in correcting the other problems."
2.0,"The color is white, not pink.  Not as pictured."
2.0,Nothing like the picture they are thin and smaller than i thought they would be
2.0,"This runs pretty small.  I normally wear a large in leggings, but ordered and XL and it was way too small!  Also, I think it looks better in the picture.  The skirt part is very short; too short for me."
2.0,"The neck tie is separate, fabric feels a little cheap and costume-y. It also fits a tad smaller than expected, I would probably size up. I usually wear a size small, I ordered a medium. My arms are a little long, so the sleeves weren't quite long enough."
2.0,Not for pear shaped women
2.0,"I returned them.  They were not very flattering or supportive in holding everything in.  On the plus side, they did not seem to be see thru."
2.0,I ordered a XL in this dress for a wedding! It is super cute but too small. I went by what other review said for sizing... it fit nice other than the neck. Yikes. I could not wear it. I will keep and have it altered to work for me. My suggestion is to size up.<br />150 lbs. 5'3. 38D. Dress size 12.
2.0,"This is a huge bra in the sense that its got a lot of material, wide back straps, and huge shoulder straps, and is far from feminine! Its like something my grandmother would have worn in the 1940's. It is also heavily padded and not what we expected at all. There is nothing in the description that mentions padding or the fact that it comes from China, a fact that seems to be always missing from products from that area...why is that I wonder!!!"
2.0,Just barely ok.  Silk threading comes apart real easy.  You get what you pay for!
2.0,Really were not thst comfortable.  Sizes run a little big.
2.0,The picture on the mask is way too big and looks odd on.
2.0,"Very pretty, but flimsy. Arrived broken."
2.0,Great price but after a week the colors fade and peel
2.0,If you need a over night bag this is perfect.If I carried this as a purse I would need surgery No my shoulder within a year.It's so pretty why does it heavy to be so big.How do women carry purse's so big?Unfortunate!
2.0,Color is off front the picture. Almost looks like an entirely different tie but the design is the same.
2.0,sleeves are terrible and material wrinkles easily. overall unflattering
2.0,Great length. Great idea with the clasp but i have to use pliers to engage the opening mechinism.
2.0,It was really pretty but even though it says 18mm it didnt fit my watch. Which is 18mm and other 18mm bands fit it
2.0,I shouldn't be surprised this item was very cheap and shipped from outside of the United States.<br /><br />Wouldn't recommend this product
2.0,"La parte de arriba es muy pequeña, soy M y pedí L pero parece una talla S, la parte de abajo si tiene un buen tamaño pero la primera vez q lo utilicé la tela soltó un poco del color y se llenó de bolitas como sele pasar con ropa muy usada, la verdad súper desepcionada"
2.0,Unfortunately the legs on my outfit were sewn on backwards.
2.0,I really wanted to love this watch... But it is such poor quality. The first day I was wearing it the face cracked and today only 2 weeks after receiving it the knob on the side broke off so the watch can not be set. I love the design of this watch I just wish it was of better quality so that I could enjoy it.
2.0,"Living in the Rocky Mountains I have plenty of places for really good hiking. My first complaint is that e v e r y single rock or stick you step on is easily felt through the soles! I had initially thought I could use these for hunting as well, but they have the worst squeaking noise because it's not real leather or plain fabric. So any animal will hear me walking around for miles in any direction.<br /><br />If you just want to have the look of an outdoors enthusiast these will work, but if you want real hiking boots do NOT buy these."
2.0,From the photo I thought the bag was Black and Grey....not so it is Grey and Blue
2.0,I thought it was going to be nicer and shiny unfortunately it looks likes a piece of cheap stamped metal with a bunch of lines through the design. The shape and size were good but the metal was cheap and it wasn't taken care of when made unfortunately. But you get what you pay for. If it is cheap price wise it is cheaply made.
2.0,The material is cheap.  I wouldn't recommend buying it.
2.0,Very wide foot
2.0,"Ordered XS wondering if it might be a bit too tight or small.<br />Nope, the first one I got was huge! I don't believe that it was truly XS; more like Medium.<br />There's no size tag or even label with anything, so I don't even know how Amazon staff would be able to know what the sizes are.<br /><br />First one, looked like a big nightgown on me. And the length went past my knees! I made a return and then reordered hoping that it would send the right size.<br />2nd one I ordered is still definitely not XS but maybe SMALL on the big side (American modern sizing). Was very let down. No where like how the model in the ad looks. This one still was baggy. Didn't cling to my body like assumed it would. I may be petite, but not as much as this dress fit me. Still look like a big floppy gown. Since there is no size note or label on care, I can't say that I am 100% sure that it is truly size XS. But after 2 orders, I'd think at least 2nd one was smaller but not XS.<br /><br />I think I may have liked it a lot if it looked like in the ad. And glad for all of you who ordered and love it! Hope to have better luck next round."
2.0,Don't sit near heat or open flame. Plastic will melt. Yes the material is not good at all.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:b45b430b5ee6cd9c7f36cd07be049b2b]] For the price, the material is great but the fit is way too big! Order down a size!"
2.0,horrible material. not soft at all! kind of itchy.  wish I'd sent it back! I thought maybe it would soften up after washing it with a softner and drying it with a softner. no such luck.<br />It looks cheap. the style would be cute if it was a decent material.
2.0,About 1/8 the size that I expected and gets stained very easily
2.0,Cute style dress that is true to size with adorable fabric print however the fabric is so sheer/see through I can not even wear them out of the house. Also seller seems to be a bit deceiving by listing dresses for $23.99 and $14.99 under the same listing with Prime shipping for some and ridiculous shipping for others. I clicked the tab for prime shipping items in the filters so I shouldn't have to hunt through every selection I make to see if they in fact are prime shipping or not. Nearly $20 for 2 dresses that take a month to arrive seems like highway robbery to me. I will never do business with this seller and probably will not do business with an international seller ever again.
2.0,"I wear a US large and ordered the large.  Was a bit tight, but liked the material and color.  May return both products for an XL."
2.0,I wear a size 16 bought the XL. I buy L or X L always. This is well lined and very cute but runs very very small.
2.0,Got scratched easily.
2.0,"The neck line is weird. It won’t stay in place.  I’ve ordered 3 or 4 items from this seller and received rave reviews on the fit and colors. Needless to say, I’m disappointed. I didn’t return because I washed before trying on"
2.0,This was way too large. The top part has way too much room.
2.0,The cord is whimsy and if you pull on the cord it comes out of the end cap.  It seems shorter than expected.
2.0,It’s a cute purse. Cheaply made but not meant to last a lifetime.
2.0,Do to they shaping my wife couldn’t put these earrings in her earlobes. They are very pretty but unfortunately she can’t wear them.
2.0,They all come individually wrapped. The pink one  REAKS of mothballs. I mean REAKS. That is a smell that typically does not ever go away. It was the one I wanted most & sadly the one I probably won't ever get to use. Purple & black were ok.
2.0,"Came scratched and nicked :( Also, pendant is a good bit larger than I gathered from the pic."
2.0,"It’s okay. The small beaded bracelets in the set are very small and 3 of the 5 charms on the big one came off within several hours of 1st time wearing it. Also, the elastic band on that charm bracelet was unraveling (received it that way, not from wearing it)."
2.0,"This shirt runs small enough that if I wash it I'll be in trouble. Also, there are three small white spots on the left side. I'd love to wash it to see if they'll come out but.....I'm getting so tired of ordering shirts that don't quite run true to size and I'm really getting tired of receiving things that have flaws in them and/or are made like crap."
2.0,"The bag is a decent, compact size with good pockets. I'm disappointed that the purple is actually pink. Very, very pink. I even returned and ordered a second time but again, way too pink,,,especially since I ordered purple. I won't be keeping it."
2.0,"I have recently lost 35 pounds so i was trying to man up and wear a 2 piece.  pretty sure i need to drop another 30 before that will happen.  The style of this is really cute- and it would probably be adorable...on someone else.  The top offers no support at all and i have a very large chest.  It comes with removable pads that i would never wear.  The top does not work if you are busty....unless they are fake, then by all means, proceed.  I love how high waisted the bottoms are- but they make me look like humpty dumpty.  They fit great though- no squeezing or tightness.  I will be returning this, but i think it could be cute on the right body type<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased and honest review. I test every product before reviewing. My experience may not match every other reviewers but my experiences are what I base the reviews on. If you felt I was helpful, please click yes below. If not, please comment and offer suggestion on how I can improve my review for you"
2.0,Not great. I much prefer the Bitly brand: http://www.amazon.com/Bitly-Plantar-Fasciitis-Premium-Compression/dp/B010OAIF7U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1463947273&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=bitly+plantar+fasciitis+socks&psc=1
2.0,I love the hat but one of the Pom poms came off second time I went to wear it. I don’t know who to complain to!
2.0,"I ordered a 3-pack and am disappointed that this is actually a 1-pack (one bandeau). The one I received is a comfortable,  “barely there” bandeau yet perfect for light post-surgery compression. I would rate the product 4 stars but give it 1.5 stars for advertising the wrong quantity and shortchanging the purchaser out of two bandeaus.<br /><br />I tried this in a large to extra, extra, extra large and all the sizes in-between and these bras fit me perfectly in any of those sizes without much difference in feel or tightness. I got these to help reduce swelling after surgery and this is working perfectly for me. I also love the lilac color. Note that they also wash well in a lingerie bag. I lay them flat to dry but have tumble dried them on low for a few minutes without any issue. If this had come in a three-pack as currently described on the Amazon site when I ordered it, this would have received 4 stars."
2.0,it's not even a month and my bracelet and the one I gifted started to fall apart!!!!! The bracelets  were not chip for them to fall apart.
2.0,"The pilling is bad enough, but today I noticed how super thin these are. WOW! I mean THIN. Cheap, cheap, cheap. I won't be buying anymore of these and you shouldn't either. I guess you get what you pay for, right?"
2.0,Very tight around the leg.
2.0,"These are the type of sunglasses I expect to pick up from a Forever 21, for example. They look and feel like sunglasses I've bought for a quarter of this price. Very lightweight, flimsy, kind of cheap-looking. Unless you completely love the style, you might be better off picking similar glasses up somewhere else for a lower price."
2.0,I brought this product from a different vendor before an extra large fit awesome. This time I ordered extra large and they fit like a large.
2.0,I guess that old saying you get what you pay for. These are made of a felt-like material that won't hold up very well. Not really what I expected
2.0,Way small on the fit. I but everything In large or xl with a good fit. I suggest buying two to three sizes up.
2.0,Can’t get them on
2.0,"Their cute but not what I expected, my toddler never had a chance to wear it.. slides off easy."
2.0,Fit was too small and I even ordered larger than normal due to it being Asian sized. I am a size 10-12 (USA) and even ordering 2 sizes bigger was too small to close the zipper all the way. The colors are also not vibrant at all - very dull colors. The return process from the seller was very easy however. The dress is pretty - I may have reordered it in an even bigger size if the colors were more vibrant.
2.0,The xxl was still very small and the material was much thinner than I anticipated.
2.0,"The jellyfish they sent me is yellow, not white but with the color lights it is hard to see what color the jellyfish is."
2.0,"First time I wore these earrings, one fell apart.  Very pretty but very cheaply made."
2.0,No quality to this product.  Clasp already (after wearing once) doesn't close
2.0,The material was very strange and almost silky. Wasn’t what I expected so I returned them.
2.0,"About the quality you'd expect for the low price - cheaply constructed, waiting to snap in a few months. Luckily I only use them for landscaping to keep rocks from flying into my eyes while weed whacking."
2.0,"Ordered this for the RenFest in Todd Mission. First package came quickly but it was a cape and not the 2 piece dress I ordered. Returned that only to receive my second package opened and only one piece of the the 2 piece dress, and the one I received had been ripped open. Hopefully, third time is the charm and I will have it for next years festival."
2.0,I thought this would help with all the glaring lights at night.  It just made everything yellow and still had the glare with the yellow tint.  Did not work for me.
2.0,"Collar was thick but hardware seemed cheap and flimsy, but that’s to be expected for the cost. My main reason for return was that the collar was too small"
2.0,GORGEOUS pin and I am a survivor and was planning on giving these out to my friends but? The pin just doesn't want to stay shut.  This pin would be fantastic if it had a tie tack type pin and not  the type it has.  I only was able to keep one of the four I ordered.
2.0,"I had high hopes for these, but they slip off my hair. I don't recommend and would not buy again."
2.0,"Got these for my granddaughter & they were supposed to be ""totally unlined"" & are not!"
2.0,"Sizing charts are off, super cute skirt."
2.0,"One was broken when recieved, bummed needed for back to school teacher gifts!"
2.0,Liked what I saw on the site. Too bad thats not what I got in the mail... But you get what you pay for I guess
2.0,"Sweater not reversible, has tag and raw seam edges that look tacky. Not a bad sweater if you like that look or only want to wear one side."
2.0,It fit my phone too loose
2.0,The ones I received were dyed to make them look darker green. I placed them in water and they lost a lot of color in a few minutes. Not sure if these are even real
2.0,too small for the laptop it says it will fit
2.0,"The material was not good, the printing was kind of mehh. It also didn’t fit as expected, looked kind of funny in the top part"
2.0,Picture was taken after my attempt to fix the ripped seam. My daughter wore it only twice and the seam ripped during class.
2.0,"It ripped after two days of wearing it. Very loose, the bows on the socks are super glued on. The choker is very uncomfortable when looking down, not worth the price"
2.0,"They fit okay, but the metal on the bracket broke on both shoes immediately upon use.  Very flimsy.  Able to use them, but not a neat strapping of the extra material."
2.0,this is a very light jacket
2.0,Unsatisfactory!<br />Returned it...<br /><br />Brown Leather Black Hemp Metal Plate Time Is What You Make of It Handmade...<br />Unsatisfactory!<br />Returned it...
2.0,Used 4 time Orlando airport busy jammed belts cracked the bottom wheel off
2.0,"Love this ring, but it didn't look exactly like the picture. The picture looks more 3D while in real life it's more flat. The band is adjustable, but very bendy which I did not anticipate, and one of the skinnier sides broke off after accidentally being bent at an angle. Overall, I really like the design and how small the ring is, but for $20, I didn't expect it to be so flimsy and break so easily.<br /><br />UPDATE 8/13/16: One side of the band broke off entirely on one side leaving it in 2 pieces. When I got it one side of the band had a tiny crack in it near where the heart connected with the band. Today the crack got bigger and that one side of the band broke off, so now the ring is unwearable. I lowered my rating down to 2 stars. This is my favorite design and was looking for a new ring since I lost an old one I used to wear all the time, so I wish this ring hadn't broken in half on me, because it would be the perfect ring and just what I was looking for."
2.0,Way to long and high waisted.
2.0,Didn't hold up after washing.
2.0,I ordered a 12 pack and only received 10.
2.0,&#34;Arm&#34; broke off after only a few wears. Got what I paid for.
2.0,The shirt is made of thin material and is slightly asymmetrical in the front (at least mine was). It is not as long as it looks in the picture. I had to trim off quite a few stray threads from the seams to try and make it look less cheap. There was no tag inside the shirt so it is very hard to tell the front from the back without putting it on (then inevitably having to turn it around). I would say this is more like a $6 to $8 shirt.
2.0,"I love the material. It is very light and airy, but the color just wasn't anything to call home about. It was very faded as if it had sat in the sun for a few years..."
2.0,"I'm 5'7&#34;, and I normally wear size 30 pants. If you buy these to fit, which was a size medium for me, they will ride up like crazy and be the most uncomfortable thing you've ever worn. They likely fit someone who does not have average to above-average thigh muscle.<br /><br />Also, the no-fly thing is more annoying than I thought it would be, especially at work with a tucked-in dress shirt.<br /><br />Wouldn't recommend for the average person."
2.0,I order a black xl shorts and I got a dark blue size small shorts. That's bites. I really need me some shorts. But it's such a pain to have to call Amazon deal with them then go to fed ex and box up and return. Heck with gas prices so high and I have a 4x4 dodge ram it would cost more in gas to return them then to just bite another bullets. These bullets are starting to get pretty expensive though. Lol hey I have them 2 stars for getting here in time
2.0,"My grandson liked the look & feel of this weapon,  but there is something loose shaking inside it. We'll be returning this first another."
2.0,"This dress was so cute, but fit huge! I am a tts small and sometimes I wear a medium. This fit like a large on me."
2.0,"This top fit awkwardly, but I liked the color."
2.0,Ran too large
2.0,"This was way too small. I looked at the size chart, but it was 3 inches away from buttoning. Very disappointed. Quality was ok if I could have worn it."
2.0,Order one size down. Shows a lot of cleavage
2.0,"So when I first bought these, they fit securely and looked great. I would shake my head and they would stay in place.<br /><br />Fast forward a few months, the metal on the earring (which seems like the same material as a paper clip glued to the earring back) would spring off and my earring would fall apart with the slightest movement.<br /><br />They’re beautiful, but honestly they’re not well constructed."
2.0,I should have read the reviews before purchasing. It looks nice online but it's made of a cheap plastic. It's thin and looks very breakable
2.0,"No attached panty but is fully lined in the front.  Legs kept creeping up, not for me.  Gave them away to a friend."
2.0,"Cute, but the heart was too puffy and just didn't look right."
2.0,The fit was fine. It was simply that the skirt looked very cheap. It didn’t look nearly as good as it did in the pictures online.
2.0,They were really cute but very disappointed when both pair broke After my kids wore them once
2.0,Too flimpsy but pretty
2.0,"I ordered this to blend in to a beautiful white dress I have… I happen to have WHITE sweatpants on when this arrived yesterday, it is not plain white!! It is off white… not cream, not shimmery… OFF WHITE. I would show a pic but it’s in the wash right now. I may throw it in with my WHITES and was again, cause I put bleach in with my Whites!!"
2.0,This material has no give to it at all.
2.0,"The glass is too small for the frame and moves around while it is installed.  Get what you pay for, I guess."
2.0,"These shoes are cute, but the bottoms have NO traction.  I put them on my toddler and the minute he set foot on our tile he was falling all over the place."
2.0,MY GLASSES BROKE AT THE ARM. NOT TOO HAPPY BUT I LIKE THE GLASSES
2.0,"I love the sparkly Snoopy pendant. Very cute and good detail. I put it on and within ten minutes the very fragile chain broke. I contacted the seller and they never responded (it’s been 2 weeks). I went to a thrift store and found a new chain. So if you like the Snoopy, plan to buy your own chain."
2.0,This is a GORGEOUS dress but it is soooo darn short and Im only 5'2😖😖
2.0,"""Leather"" is peeling and ugly after a couple weeks of normal use."
2.0,This is no where near as long as the picture shows. Huge disappointment.
2.0,The fabric was too scratchy and made me itch. Will return.
2.0,"This dress is kind of cute. It looks better in the picture, and the pockets start at the natural waist, instead of being lower, which makes it look bulky and square instead of graceful over the hips. I’ll keep it and wear it with a sweater or jacket to hide the pockets but I’ve definitely seen better designs. For comparison, I got the large, and I’m 5’4 and weigh about 175."
2.0,"I’m disappointed because it’s so cute! If you plan to buy, definitely go up a size or two.<br />For reference: I am 5’7, 120 lbs, and I have a small bust. I got a small, and it was EXTREMELY tight in the neck and arms."
2.0,"I really liked these and have 4 other pairs by 90degrees, but I wore these for the first time the other day and 10 mins into my workout I noticed a small hole in the crotch area :("
2.0,I've never given a bad review so this hurts. It might work for some but the things just slide right off the glasses. Any tension to make it snug and it just slides off. My suggestion is to get rid of the silicone loops on the end and find something that will cling.
2.0,I'm 5'6 and about 165lbs I ordered the large since the size guide said it's a 12-14. A large is more like an 8. These are so tight I can barely button them. They are also very short and not flattering for curvier ladies. These are getting sent back!
2.0,It is not anti-fog and not good quality. I am disappointed .It is not worth the price.
2.0,"The patterns were beautiful, but the masks were HUGE on an aver sized adult face. Returned."
2.0,The size is not accurate. I wear a xl in all my tops and night gowns. This gown I got in red and blue. They both were very snug. I was disappointed because they are very soft just not true to size.
2.0,"The layers do not fall like the photo for mine - you can see the third layer beneath because the second layer was not long enough (hard to explain, see photos). It is also much bulkier than it looks in the photos making me look larger than I am. Not a big fan, I will be returning this skirt."
2.0,Bulky and difficult to operate
2.0,Took way to long to get. Not very thick.
2.0,The material was very thin - not in a good way.  The cut was wrong for my pear shape.
2.0,Very wide legs and short in length.
2.0,"Since you are asking, Not happy with the silk screen quality. The shirt was washed inside out to protect the decoration from abrasion before wearing, then dried on medium heat. When it was removed from the dryer I was rather upset to see how much of the decoration had come off !  The shirt looks like it has been washed 10 or 12 times and its yet to be worn . Poor quality !! Think I will be sending it back, since you are asking ."
2.0,"Lovely hand to the fabric, but dry clean recommended.  Fit was large."
2.0,Clasp is stiff and does not move well.
2.0,Looked like a granny dress in person. Returned it.
2.0,"Didn't notice that the V on the crown was in bling.  Nope!  I probably  will try to return it.  Or, for the price it might have to do."
2.0,"I love the look of retro swimwear, unfortunately being that I'm super heavy on top (40DD) the structure of the top was not providing ANY support what so ever. I was so bummed. For someone that may not be so top heavy this design may work, I just wasn't willing to risk a wardrobe malfunction."
2.0,The textile nato looks great. On the leather nato I had to do some modification so it wouldn't look as bulky.
2.0,Hermosos pero no buenos ala semana se despegan
2.0,"These appear to come up a little bit higher than they actually do, my toddler walks right out of these and the are always falling off. Not a great slipper at all."
2.0,They're cute but not true to size
2.0,I have smaller wrists so when trying to wear the band it was only good for people who have larger wrists. I wouldn't wear this when being active because it felt like it would fall off at any second. I purchased this as a good outdoors band for camping or hiking and it just collects dust. Not a huge fan at all. Wished it would have worked out.
2.0,"My only complaint about these pants is that they have a super high waist, which makes them really uncomfortable (at least for me)<br />I am average size 5'5"" tall and ordered a medium.  They fit well except they come up to about 2-3 inches below my boobs. They do not fit at all like on the photos of the model.  I have to fold them over just to be able to wear them."
2.0,Veerrry small bells but they do jingle.
2.0,"the heel doesnt feel like its attached very well when i walk, and fit is a bit smaller than expected"
2.0,"Flimsy material, missing pieces (respirator), not assembled, no instructions<br /><br />Opened the package and stuff fell out on my desk: the mask with two holes, a thin filter with two holes and two pieces of plastic. No instructions about assembly but it is not rocket science. Place filter next to mask. (Shapes don't match well). 2 holes so should have 4 plastic pieces but only receive 2.<br /><br />Am returning. (Really surprised they want it returned, but doesn't do me any good anyway.)"
2.0,"Looked great for a day or so then after washing it the fabric was a magnet for everything piece of dust, hair and lint. Ended up tossing it."
2.0,"Fit's very small. I wear a large/xl juniors and it was a task getting it on, I order a 3x due To comments but I probably needed a 4x"
2.0,"Loose fitting, always have to readjust the glove while in uniform to keep on my hands"
2.0,Not made well and very awkwardly shaped. Shaped very boxy. I ordered a M.
2.0,"The belt is broken, practically with out use!"
2.0,Brakes to easily
2.0,beads too small although the wood is nice
2.0,"I really really loved these (and so did my daughter), but the glue on the soles failed after a month of use."
2.0,It’s thinner then a b!&$? with alopecia 😒
2.0,Very disappointed. Looks nothing like the picture. Material is very thin. I will hang on to dont want hassel try to return. The color isnt same.
2.0,"Shoes are very heavy soled, 11 month old daughter absolutely refuses to walk in them.  Very plastic looking but good craftsmanship for the price"
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress, it’s long , stretchy!!  but the blue dye they used came off all over my nails by just trying it on. . Not so great of quality for the price ."
2.0,"To me, it was cuter in the picture. It was baggy in certain areas. I am a size 12 so I ordered a large and it wasn't giving me the shape I was looking for."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:9978a9dbe0572abbe0291e821b9a504e]] My first order was damaged and returned prior to receiving. I can understand  why; it came in flimsy packaging. I wish I had not reordered it. It looks rather cheap. The strap is not adjustable.  I am able to ide it as a cross body but it will not work as a cross body for a larger woman. I guess you get what you pay for.  My video makes it look better than actuality.
2.0,They fell apart too easily. Poorly constructed.
2.0,I didn't get the long sleeved one but the other ran really small in my opinion. But again the long sleeved one I never received.
2.0,broke very fast
2.0,"I'm 5'5 and I can barely get it over my shoulder, suck cause everything about is what I wanted in a drawstring backpack but the strings are short. One upside of ordering online"
2.0,Very cheap clothing and did not look how it's supposed to at all.
2.0,It worked well for about 3 months. Clip broke and spring fell out
2.0,"The front is not appealing. It's like a teenage, training bra type look. I love the back, but I can't wear it due to the front and the feel of it."
2.0,"Not great quality material. The metal irritated my ears (and I don't have sensitive skin/ears). I will say that the color is very accurate, but overall I'm not happy with this purchase"
2.0,This was super cute! I’m 5’ 8” and I got the XXL and it was still pretty short on me.. you also get hot really quick in it because it’s a heavy material.
2.0,I Love it.  Better then I thought.  Very nice quality. But it all fell apart.  Zippers broke.  Pockets all got holes.  Uhggg
2.0,Slips down my feel & wads up under my foot.
2.0,Not enough scoop neck as shown in the picture
2.0,Not accurately sized
2.0,It looks like a womens watch cause its so small
2.0,Not exactly what u think.  It's a very strange material n has little color on it like the picture. But it does run according to size
2.0,I bought this for a wedding. The sleeves were gapped in the back. I felt it looked cheap for a wedding.
2.0,My daughter is about 135 pounds and these were a little tight on her.  So tight in fact that they tore (small hole) in the crotch area the first time she tried them on.
2.0,I have ordered a number of necklaces for about $5 total cost and this was the only disappointment. Very cheap and flimsy feeling and rose is too fake looking. Giving mine away
2.0,Looks nothing like the picture. The material below the waist is super baggy and the legs are too short. The flares are not nearly as wide as the photo. Don't waste your money
2.0,The shirt was comfortable and fit well but the logo was very cheap - the plastic-y kind that is ironed or pasted on. Those always look awful after a wash so I returned.
2.0,"I love this designer and have lots of her things. However, this was cheaply made. Was going to be a gift but not now"
2.0,I did love this band until the metal band started sticking and puling on my clothing and other objects so there were little broken and sharp edges all over. I sadly returned it and bought a different brand with the same design and it didn't fray again.
2.0,I ordered a size L16 for an average size 11 year old...too small.  Reordered men’s small.
2.0,Was very small and did not breathe well. I was hoping for a lighter drifit material
2.0,Wore this Twice and already stretched out. Get a size smalller
2.0,"The sizes seem to vary in shipment.  Also, the leg seam rips with minimal pull."
2.0,"Nice , but really wasn't what I wanted..."
2.0,"It doesn't look like Sterling silver, no matter how often I clean it.  It does have a nice design."
2.0,this jacket was mcuh too small and looks like it's made for a woman.
2.0,"Got the cover up, and it's not worth what they charge for. Also, I'm 5.2"" and it's way too long. Disappointed, but keep it to wear around the house when it's hot."
2.0,"I really wanted to love this dress.  It is such a beautiful pattern and nice, thick, soft material, unfortunately it is more like a robe then a dress.  I decided to keep it and wear it as a robe."
2.0,Cheap. The back pieces broke within two weeks. To all three sets...
2.0,The construction and material look and feels cheap. Don't think they will last very long. Will not buy again. I guess u get what u pay for....
2.0,"I know these are cheap and you get what you pay for, but the materiel feels pretty bad. I wouldn't wear them for a long time."
2.0,I like the look of this bag and was happy with it for about 2 weeks when the strap broke. So I bought another strap and was happy again. Then the zipper broke. This isn't worth the hassle. You get what you pay for.
2.0,Looks nice but very itchy.
2.0,Color is pretty but they are definitely not as cute as they looked in the pictures. I didn’t expect them to be high quality but they look cheap as hell. Like kids dress up cheap. Sending them back. It’s a no from me.
2.0,They all broke at the frame around the lens after a couple months of use.
2.0,not so satisfied
2.0,"Fake looking, too big ghetto looking just eh..since this review has to be 20 words long I guess I'll tell u that reviews have to be more than 20 words long!"
2.0,"The body was the correct size, the arms were at least 2 sizes too small for me. (My arms are not out of proportion to my body). The top button immediately fell off as I tried the coat on. The coat did not look nearly as good as the photos-- though the body material was nice."
2.0,"Size XL, color, Red with white polka dots.<br />First the good things - the material is soft and pleasant, the dress is the correct length and the sleeves are just long enough. The color is a beautiful red and it's an adorable dress. The bad thing, and the most disappointing, is that is too small in the middle area (between my hips and my natural waist), and the buttons were straining in the bust area. I went up one size, I would have liked to be able to go up two sizes. I'll be passing this on to someone in my family that hasn't given birth to 4 kids."
2.0,I want to love this hat. Unfortunately it is a very shallow hat (and I don't have a big head) and it sits far above my ears.  The logo is also off-center. I wouldn't buy another hat online.
2.0,"Cute, heavy material, very solid.. 2 sizes too small. Sending back."
2.0,"I've bought two shirts from this company.  Both shirts had different colors than the pictured shirts, and the buttons were completely different than pictured on both...  Its an easy fix that this company obviously doesn't wish to make..."
2.0,I wanted to love this band but I had to use a Dremel to grind down the ends a little to make it fit my Galaxy watch 4 classic. Also after wearing it for just a few days the paint started to wear off. Not happy and won't buy this brand again.
2.0,"After reading other reviews, I bought the XL.  When they arrived, they fit like I had ordered M.  Not nearly as vibrant as they look in the photos.  I gave them to a smaller friend..."
2.0,2 year old loves the hat. Fits well. Arrived with the stitching on the bill being frayed and coming loose.
2.0,This pants was too baggy and bulky. I have thick thighs so thigh areas were fine but knees down were way too big. It made the pants look really big & baggy. I just didn't like the style. Color was darker than I wanted to so I returned.
2.0,"Very disappointed.  Not what I was expecting at all. The color was not the same. Not a canary yellow but a neon yellow. The fit was not flattering either.  Regardless I bought them and was determined to wear then, but can start to hurt after a while.  I really like the concept.  Would have looked past the discomfort if the color would have been correctly labeled. I would have chosen another color if I would have known before hand."
2.0,Too long. They desintigrated after one wash. What the hell! Worthless.
2.0,The color was nice but it's flemzy and some of the beads had fallen off... probably get a couple wears out it.
2.0,I liked the variety of colors but unfortunately they don't really hold very well. I used them for face masks. It gets annoying when you have to adjust constantly.
2.0,I like the outfit its really cute the pants fit perfect but the top is really small i ordered an XL
2.0,"I received these leggings and returned them immediately. They were comfortable, but looked so fake they wouldn't ever pass as jean looking leggings."
2.0,Best socks compresión just one sock it was ripped
2.0,"I wish I could give this dress 5 stars, but unless I can find someone who can fix the hem problem, I'll never wear it.  It fits me wonderfully - 5'9"", 153 pounds with birthing hips.  The material is soft and comfortable and the hidden zipper in the back is very well sewn in.  My dress has a serious problem though.  The hem at the bottom of the slits bags out into big puffs.  The puffs look like the inside of the corners of fitted sheets turned wrong side out, and the seams are visible.  It's like the hem corners at the ends of the slits are twisting out for some reason.  I have tried to make them lay correctly but they keep bulging out while the rest of the dress lays much flatter. It looks bad.  What a shame because I was really looking forward to wearing this dress to a fancy Christmas party this year but the hem problem is very obvious."
2.0,Smaller than I pictured
2.0,Color was great.....given as a gift but too small! So tired if everything being small made in some other country. If you say 2Xl it should be about a size 24 typically....everything else was nice....
2.0,"I was very disappointed in the way this dress fit. I read many reviews so I felt I had a good handle on the sizing and ordered a medium (I am 5'7&#34;, 120 lbs.), but it was definitely too small and not nearly as long as shown in photo. It barely hit my knees. The quality of construction was better than I expected though."
2.0,"The hubby was impressed when he initially tried them on, the fit was prefect. However, after the wash they never fit properly in the foot area - saggy. The hubby wears them mostly for the stabilization of the calf muscle, he said that he prefers his calf compression sleeves."
2.0,They were cut entirely too short for 6 teeth.It only covered 4 teeth. I was disappointed bc I have purchased several from this company before and this just wasn’t suitable.
2.0,I feel a little silly wearing these. Like the tin man. I thought they would look cool but it would look better maybe if there were two straps or the straps were skinnier or something. It doesn’t help that at size 8 these run big and are too large on me (I usually wear 8.5). I’ll probably wear them for taking out the trash or trips to the mailbox but that’s it.
2.0,There is no way that was a B cup.  It looked like an A cup and was therefore too small.
2.0,Expected more support and more thickness. Disappointed in them.
2.0,Love the watch but only wore it once and it quit working.
2.0,The foot is cut strange and the piece that goes between your toes is slightly out of place.  By the time you ware tgem for a couple hours you foot hurts in between your toes. Not recommended.
2.0,"I've never thought I have an especially large head, but this fit as if it was made for a child. Way too small."
2.0,The stones are so small. The backs of the earrings are much larger in circumference than the stone.  Barely there...not a good buy at all.  The photo leads you to believe that you can actually see the different colors. Not!
2.0,"As many other reviewers have said, the strap frayed within just a couple hours and the hook fell off. Didn't even actually use it. Very poor quality, but it's an inexpensive case so you get what you pay for with this item.<br />I attempted to sew it back on, we'll see how long it lasts.<br /><br />Also, this is a pretty large case, great for very large sunglasses but wouldn't recommend for regular RX lenses."
2.0,My husband loves the fit on these and having pockets is great... if they weren't supplied to us with a hole in one of the pockets that is!!!
2.0,Bracelet broke immediately. The necklace is still in tact but they both turned orangish after only a few uses sadly.
2.0,It is way bigger than what I expected and colors are not as bright as shown in the picture.
2.0,"It does a okay job of trying to look like the photo but overall, it looks nothing like the photo. I'll just keep it because my son wants to use it and Halloween is coming soon. At the very least, I was hoping it would be some what similar to what you see in the photo."
2.0,Rose gold Color looks tarnished. Just not happy w product.
2.0,"My wife has had this for about a week and the bow broke off already. Luckily we didnt lose the bow and I'll be super glowing it back on. It's pretty but it's a little fragile, but it did for the pandora bracelet correctly so I'll give it that. Cheaply made."
2.0,"Top is too small,<br />Bottom is too big -_-  . Really disappointed."
2.0,I like the item that bought I really enjoyed wearing it. But it’s wrist band is too weak. I wore for 5 months that’s all.
2.0,"This shirt feels nice and is of good quality, albeit a bit sheer. However, please be advised that the sizing runs rather small, I am 5'7, about 140Ibs and a size medium, although long enough, did not fit my shoulders or stomach properly. I will be retuning this order and purchasing a size up to see if that works."
2.0,Bottom of quality chart
2.0,"Way too small.  Was not impressed with the quality.  To me, it looks nicer in the picture than in person."
2.0,"Ordered this suit for a trip to Florida. It is a beautiful pattern but is definitely not for someone who has a cup size larger than an A to a small B. Unfortunately, I am larger chested and the built in support just doesn't cut it, even after removing the pads."
2.0,"This swim suit is cute-when dry! I wore this to a pool party and the bottoms are only lined on the front, so when I went to get out of the water you could see through the backside of the bottoms. The top was well lined, but if you insist on getting this suit I would recommend you get the black bottoms."
2.0,"This bag is pretty, I like all the pockets that it has. I only gave it 2 stars because it is smaller than what i expected and needed. I also dont think the material will last very long. I got it from snagshout, good deals!"
2.0,"The Angel Wing part of the necklace is nice but the chain clasp is so tiny...I mean tiny, I can not close it to put on. It is even very difficult to close holding in my hands. Not sure what the solid balls are for unless it's just for decorative purposes I'd your not using the item for essential oil."
2.0,Arrived very wrinkled. Lots of unsnipped assembly threads.<br />Some assembly needed.
2.0,"Good material for light support, just WAY too big."
2.0,I bought these shoes for my 11 year old son two months ago and  I am very disappointed that they are falling apart already.  🙁
2.0,cute but extremely bulky and uncomfortable especially in a shoe - bought as gift and they gave away.
2.0,Broke trying to get out of the packaging.
2.0,"I was really disappointed with this men's ski jacket. Despite following the size chart and ordering my usual size, the jacket was way too small and tight in the chest and arms. It made it uncomfortable to move and I couldn't wear any layers underneath. Additionally, the jacket also felt cheaply made and didn't seem like it would hold up well in extreme cold or harsh weather conditions. I would not recommend this jacket to anyone due to its poor fit and low quality."
2.0,ordered these for my daughter but only received one.<br />I'm waiting to hear back from the seller so will update when they message back.<br />I received a pink bonnet they are thin and for my daughter perfect she is 6yrs.<br />perfect for fall.
2.0,low quality and took forever to arrive.
2.0,I wanted to like it but the large on me was so tight! And I'm a skinny girl! Had to get rid of it because I washed it before I tried it on.. The sad part I bought two..
2.0,"I ordered a size down and it was still too big, and incredibly baggy. The ""compression"" lining doesn't comress anything, and was more like a slim pair of shorts. The outside was longer than what I felt like was described, and came down to my knees (I'm 6' tall exactly.)<br /><br />I returned these since it wasn't what I expected, but if you don't mind baggy shorts then you might like them."
2.0,"The vest arrived a few moments ago. I was eager to try it on. The vest arrives zipped up. I had to struggle with the cheap, tiny zipper so long that I thought something was wrong with it. Finally, I coaxed it open. The thing needs a lot of fiddling at its base to either zip up or unzip. It is hard to handle something so small. The grab-on, moving part measures only 6/16 by 4/16 inches.  The base part at the left bottom of the zipper measures 3/16 by 3/16. To secure the grab-on part to the base requires two hands, the left to hold the base and the right to push the left side of the grab-on into its proper spot with sufficient thrust. That's step one. Step two is to slide the bottom right side of the zipper into its proper spot on the grab-on. Then zip-up.  Later on, un-zipping is successful only after pushing the grab-on to touch the base, because it will not do touch it naturally.<br /><br />I gave it a lot of thought, should I keep or return this product? After practicing with the zipper I decided I liked the rest of the vest too much, and would tolerate the user-unfriendly zipper. But if my life ever depends on a quick zipping up, the story would not have a happy ending."
2.0,"Bought these a size and a half larger for my grand daughter to grow into. They fit right out of the box. The shoes were cute, but not made as well as I had hoped. She out grew them very quickly, so I can't comment on how durable they actually are. Would not repurchase."
2.0,Mine broke already and I just got it Friday. But it was still cute!
2.0,"very cheap glasses.  these have not broken yet, but the looks of them it won't be long.  Came in a decent amount of time n they have a nice sleeve for the glasses but glasses could be more sturdy"
2.0,Material is uncomfortable and the arm sleeves  are shorter than I was expecting. Leg length isn’t bad though.
2.0,Too small button was falling off hanging by a thread
2.0,really does not knock down glare for night driving
2.0,Wrong size wheels. My daughter can’t even wheel around in them. The wheels are too big and won’t fit in the shoe
2.0,"one zipper broke after two day use.  clasp broke, with in a week, and the whole bag fell off my shoulder.  no it was not too heavy.  wallet, appointment book, pen and pencil, one tube of lipstick, few odds and ends."
2.0,The fabric was heavy and coarse and sleeves too long - not suitable for spring wear.
2.0,"Cute band but definitely NOT stainless steel, as you can see from the discoloration in the photo. This is a big deal if someone has an allergy."
2.0,"Very voluminous but too short and tight in the bust. Needed two to three inches e length in the bodice. Not easy to return, either."
2.0,"These are so cute, and so soft.  They are not good quality though.  I've only worn them while driving one or two times.  the seam on the end of the glove has now come completely undone.  The seam in between the thumb and palm of my hand also has a hole in it.  They just rip way too easily and I've barely worn them."
2.0,They fit different then my others I bought in store .. these ones are too small in the arms but fine everywhere else.
2.0,Super small.. not worth your money!!
2.0,Not great very thin chain
2.0,Super cute chokers but unfortunately was way too big for my neck.
2.0,Small enough for a kid. I probably end up giving them to my 9 year old niece.
2.0,"Hate the polyester material. Thought it would be cotton like most Maxi style dresses and the length was short, nothing like the picture. the color was nice."
2.0,"I had a feeling this was going to run small, so I ordered one size up. Turns out, even that is to small. I am a big guy, usually XXL, I ordered a XXXL and it still is to small."
2.0,like panty hose material not soft and seems to be coming apart at the seems just strange material for leggigs
2.0,Felt a bit costume like. Waist detail is only on the front and doesn’t go all the way around.
2.0,Can't adjust it. Nice for a $3 watch. Looks nice but wouldn't buy another.
2.0,"the good:  The color was perfect, loved the button details, and the material was nice and light.<br /><br />the bad:  sizing M (8-10) must mean B-C cup girls which I, sadly, am not.  although I normally wear a size 10 top this one was a little snug.  might just have to get a larger size and hope for the best."
2.0,Color not as pictures
2.0,Not flattering on my daughter and the material was weird
2.0,Wore it one day and it already is falling apart
2.0,"I have been very happy with this bag, however after using it for only about 6 weeks the stitching on the handle began to come undone.  It is a great size.  I needed something that I could use as a small diaper bag, but didn't want anything that looked like diaper bag.  This bag has been great except for the stitching issue.  I would like to exchange it, but apparently it is past the return window.  I would give this bag five stars if it weren't for the quality issue.<br /><br />Update:  I have had the bag for almost 7 months now and I am not happy with it at all.  The quality of this bag is very poor.  The stitching on both of the handles is now coming off and, just yesterday, the zipper on one of the outside pockets has broken.  I have downgraded my star rating from three to two stars.  I am officially on the search for a new bag."
2.0,did not last
2.0,The patch on this hat is AWESOME But it came crushed after several attempts to mold it back into shape I gave up and sadly have to return it
2.0,This is a decent purse for the price but when I opened it and was checking it out I noticed the little zipper in the front was missing a piece. The decoration on it that you zip it up and down with has a side of the snap missing. So therefore it will have to come off because it will not stay on and that will leave it without something to zip it with.
2.0,"Very sheer, wrinkles easily, cut very small"
2.0,Fit as expected but does not take scratches well. Not durable.
2.0,"Loved these earrings. However, a month after I bought them, the part of the clasp that goes through your ear broke off. I've tried everything to fix them, but nothing works. Now I have an unusable pair of really cool earrings."
2.0,The material feels like it's just going to unravel at any given time
2.0,Poor quality.  Came in all squished
2.0,"I bought the exact same shirt in black loved how it fit and was true to size, so I decided to get this one, I really liked the color and style but it does not fit the same at all! It the same size as the black one I ordered but way to small! Definitely not made with the same material. It's real disappointing because I really liked the color and style but I can't wear it!"
2.0,"Too small, thin material.  Felt like paper."
2.0,Fell apart too easily
2.0,"I bought this hoping to use it as a running jacket in low temps (under 20F). This coat is not suited for that, even with two additional fleece lined layers. The fabric in the arms is very thin and does not insulate well. The only part of the jacket that has insulation is the front chest area. The rest of the coat is a very thin material that does not keep me warm at all.  Very disappointed, especially since the product pictures show it being worn skiing - a cold weather sport."
2.0,Purchased both red and black and within 2 months both fell apart. The shoulder strap burst on both so it must be a manufacturer defect. I gave it a 2 star because overall it look cute on but a waste of money unless you are into stitching the strap back together.
2.0,This was more than an entire size off. The Large fit like a small.
2.0,"It sits to low on my head,covers my ears. I didn't know I had to measure from ear to ear for the depth."
2.0,I loved these until I went to disinfect them with alcohol wipes after they were contaminated. It made the lenses foggy and I can’t see through them or use them at all. Not a good purchase for workers in the medical field since they can’t be disinfected.
2.0,Sewing quality is poor.  The color is not wine red as I requested.  It is red.  Fit is okay.  I need to dress it up a bit as it is rather plain.  I would not order this again.
2.0,"The actual shirt is not the same as the picture.  Oh it’s lightweight, you can see through the damn thing. I don’t recommend at all. Even after washing and using fabric softener, it has an itchy/scratchy feeling to it. Look at the Cadmus shirts, WAY BETTER."
2.0,I brought several pieces of this type of jewelry.  no of it is good for me.  The metal starts to tarnish and make my skin itch.  But is is a beautiful piece but not for me.
2.0,"The ears are too close together and don't look good, too tight on my head so I had to give it to my sister. :&#60;"
2.0,Rolls up at the bottom which isn’t comfortable. Too big even after measuring my waist. Had a hard time getting it tight enough to keep it where I wanted it.
2.0,Dress fits small and I wasn’t crazy about the pockets in the front. I returned it
2.0,The charms fall off of the base easily like they are barely glued together
2.0,"I am a big guy and while I use the lanyard, I find it too small and too stiff for comfortable wearing."
2.0,The lights make it look extremely shiny online. Just received my order and it it cheaply made. A stone was already missing from the bumper and the band itself had patches of glitter missing. Returned same day I received it
2.0,It's nice that you get a whole set of these masks however the plastic is very thin and the masks crack and break really easy.
2.0,Didn’t last but 2 times
2.0,"I really like the dress but could've stood to have gotten a size bigger since the built in slip was way too small, and without it the skirt was see through."
2.0,Ordered two sets. Disappointed that both were definitely different sizes. This is my second time ordering from this company. First order both sets were same size. Good quality.
2.0,Batteries run out after a few uses. Will not buy again.
2.0,"Material is  Soft kind of see thru, had to wear under garments underneath but the dress is comfortable."
2.0,It was a good purse until the arm strap broke off & it started wearing out too quickly.
2.0,"Beautiful necklace doesn’t change colors, but the chain broke the first week into me having it."
2.0,Both zipper handles broke within two days of usage. I tried using it for school but majority of my binders didn’t fit in it (the bag was smaller than I thought it’d be) and the straps are low quality. I really like the bag design but I’d only recommend using this bag for light weight items.
2.0,Shirt was so thin as to be transparent. Flimsy and cheaply made.  I returned.
2.0,Top part is see through! Where the white is you can see your whole bum!
2.0,Too small. Order larger than you wear. Will give them to my daughter.
2.0,"The quality seemed really nice, but they sent me S/M instead of the L/XL I ordered. Not the kind of surprise anyone wants."
2.0,Beautiful but not surgical steel. Turned my ear green after one day and my ear really started to hurt. I was only able to wear it for about a week before I had to take it out and get new jewelry.
2.0,"On the one hand this unit does blow warm air and is quiet, so that's good. On the other hand, it lacks an auto-off timer which means that you have to remember to go back and turn it off or it will run indefinitely. IMO an auto-off feature is basic and should have been included on a boot dryer as expensive as this one ($45). Thermic does include a timer on their even more expensive model, but that unit is $80 (!!) and has a silly ""UV sterilization"" feature."
2.0,"Package is missing the necklace, bracelet, and stockings that were listed in the description."
2.0,I must have been drunk amazon shopping when I bought this because it’s kind of garbage. I usually read the reviews and apparently did not on this one. It is ridiculously small and would not work as a real skirt at all. I didn’t give it 1 star because it will be fine as a bathing suit cover up. I want to be clear this is one square of fabric sewed on to a string of fabric to tie it on to your waist.
2.0,Great look but can only fit a mannequine
2.0,I got this as a gag gift for a friend for Christmas and as adorable as it is it is soooooooll tiny that he wears it all the time but it goes un noticed
2.0,Gold rubs off and has funny taste after a few hours
2.0,I am usually a large in shirts because I am heavy chested. I bought a pink and green shirt in Large. They were way too big on me. Too long and too much fabric in the stomach area. It was not flattering at all. I would have tried a size down but if it was going to be just as long it would have been a waste of everyone's time.
2.0,too small. can't wear it. I wear xs to s. This was even smaller than XS.
2.0,"They are decent, but I would not use them on a very sunny day.  they were also slightly smaller than I had though.  They do not completely cover my lenses"
2.0,Meh.  Fabric VERY thin.  Fit is on the small size.  Just an iron on image.<br /><br />If I had handled I wouldn't have bought.
2.0,Ordered 4/5T twice and received size 90 both times which is something like a size 2T maybe?  Giving it two stars because it’s still cute!
2.0,It’s small!! It supposed to be large!!!
2.0,"I won't wear this mask, it is baggy and a strange color of green, I am not sure what skin tone would look good in this color, it is more lime than pictured. They refunded my money promptly."
2.0,My first experience on my trip to RD and the two large suitcase handles came off. I need my money back.
2.0,The white band is discoloring and becoming dingy.
2.0,"This belt is NOT leather. This is cheap imitation outer with some kind of fiber filling. After wearing it only a handful of times, the whole I use is already stretching out and showing the filling inside. The back is already warping after only a few uses as well. The color and style is cute, but even for occasional wear it's not going to last at all. Waste of money."
2.0,"It was cheaply made and irritated my neck, the charm fell off a week after buying it"
2.0,The skirt is simple and maxi.  The weight is not to heavy but it’s not see through.  Only problem- you don’t get 3- it’s only 1.
2.0,The shoes are cute but the size doesn’t match up at all.  Will return and try 1 more time.
2.0,"The seam underbust made it drape strangely, and getting the tie to align over it never stayed for long. The slit is very high."
2.0,"My daughter was very excited to get this bracelet and I'll admit that it was very pretty for the price.  Unfortunately, the first time she tried to put the bracelet on it broke.  I don't think this bracelet would have lasted for long even if it hadn't broken right off.  The ""metal"" looks to be very cheaply made."
2.0,"Ordered a 3xl, thinking I'd have a little room. Not at all. It fits like it is a medium.  I get compression is in the title,  that's why I ordered up. Will be returning."
2.0,"I usually wear an extra large in a belt, but this one was too small. Love the look of the belt, so very disappointed that it didn't fit. Maybe it will give me the incentive to lose a little weight though...."
2.0,Not what I expected but works
2.0,"I love the color and the style, but it runs very small"
2.0,"Cheap, sloppy socks. Par for the course for Hanes. Those of us with larger feet (size 11N for me), have very few “extended size” sock choices."
2.0,This top was just “ok”. I have Fabulous boobs and 4’10 at 110lbs but the top was made a little off.
2.0,I bought this item because one of the photos shows the girl wearing a septum with the ball on either side and assumed that it had magnets or something so you could wear it like the photo displayed and you can't.  Wearing it the way the photo displays isn't possible. Only reason it gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because the metal is semi-sturdy and still manipulative. Super disappointed.
2.0,Hat was smashed. Thanks.
2.0,"Bought the first one and thought maybe it was a fluke because you could barely feel any heat. So returned it and got another one. Same issue. Almost no warmth. Also, instructions are non existent for how to turn on or use. There was a tiny paper explaining how to charge the battery (duh...plug it in), but nothing explaining how to turn on (button on front of vest was never mentioned)! I purchased this for an elderly mother who is always cold, just as an extra layer of warmth. Returned both for a refund."
2.0,These are disappointingly small (only 1/2&#34; long). Blue color is dull. Wouldn't recommend.
2.0,Poor quality fabric and it has no structure at all.
2.0,"I managed to get the posts through my ears, but it was tight and made my ears sore. I chalked it up to not having wore earrings in 2 decades due to my allergic reaction to them. What I didn’t like was that the backings don’t fit over the provided posts. If you only push the backing over your earring post,  there is still space between the backing and your ear and the earring is not snug against your ear, and therefore sags."
2.0,"They work great BUT I’ve worn one twice, and only to work, and already tarnished.  It’s no longer gold, doesn’t match my original necklace, and became a weird brown orange color."
2.0,"Quality is nice, but the pockets on the skirt caused it to not hang smooth and give the illusion of larger hips.  Returning for a style without pockets."
2.0,"I didn't really enjoy this product. It fits small and I ordered a size larger, plus the straps keep popping off."
2.0,I have multiple pairs of firm Sockwell compression socks; these socks have much less compression in the calf portion and negligible compression in the feet.  These socks would be appropriate for someone who does not need much compression to relieve their symptoms. I will attempt to return these socks.
2.0,"Thin material, top fit, pant too large and flimsy. I'm 5'8 210 lbs.8"
2.0,Cheaply made & the tires are way too large to be useful. Not recommended at all. My daughter sleeps in them as they're too hideous to wear in public. 😂
2.0,Too big. They always fall off my face. Cute tho
2.0,The gloves were comfortable but the seams were getting in the way and just felt very odd when holding the controller.
2.0,Compartments are nice but this is week 2 for summer camp and the zippers were not sliding smoothly and now they are broken
2.0,Got it as a Mother’s Day gift and sad to say ut broke the first time I wore it.
2.0,Received today.. stitch at seam is open.
2.0,This may be a Trapper Hat but it has no warmth. I have to wear it under a hood to keep warm. This is for fashion and not warmth.
2.0,I liked the watch until the band broke after wearing only two weeks!
2.0,The product was well made however uncomfortable if needed for more than 5 or 10 minutes of use.
2.0,"I got a size XXL and they fit okay but maybe a tad too small so I got the XXXL and they were way too big<br /><br />They have zero support so they weren't for me<br /><br />I'm a size 14/16 ish and carry my weight in my stomach  :(<br /><br />Not badly made, a tad thin etc but not for me"
2.0,"Looks better in picture. Inexpensive, but very cheap looking. Latch does not work."
2.0,"Doesn't stay in place, in a few minutes, the top is all the way down."
2.0,"THIS LOOKS MORE LIKE A TOY, THAN SOMETHING I WOULD WEAR.<br />AND THE CHAIN...........REALLY???"
2.0,"I was pretty excited to receive my order in a timely manner. I tested the wallet against a very cheap and simple RFID machine. Unfortunately it failed immediately. No RFID protection whatsoever in this wallet. Other than that, cute simple wallet."
2.0,Bust too small.
2.0,I got it today and it was on time. It came inside out with (what looks like) makeup inside of it. I gave it 2 stars because it looks as described. Great price. I hate returning things.
2.0,Bought as a gift... far from &#34;Adult&#34; sized... very small... barely covers an adult men's head.  Disappointed in the fit
2.0,"These capris have good padding, but they are short waisted. If you’re looking for a pair to be waist-height, I’d order something else."
2.0,Arrived in good time. But the material was scratchy and it was very floppy and bent after being folded into the mailing envelope. Not at all what  I was expecting.
2.0,TOO SMALL UGH
2.0,"Their website says sizes run 37% large.  No, they run 37% small. We ordered a medium and it fits like a U.S. small. They required a photo to show how small it fits and will not cover the cost of returning it. Buyers beware of that policy."
2.0,I like it for the most part but the post is too wide for my ear and keeps twisting.
2.0,"It doesn't fit, but I am only glad that it's only a novelty item which I can care less about comfort to wear on a regular basis....good halloween item though..."
2.0,"I washed this before wearing it, hoping it would soften. It did not. It is very itchy. I know acrylic CAN be like that, but not always. This is definitely not the softer acrylic. The shoulders sit really odd and make me look like I'm wearing shoulder pads. That might work for some, but I wasn't a fan of them in the 80's and I'm not now, either. Maybe it's because I'm on the shorter side (5'2"") but the sleeves also don't fit right on me. The snug part goes to my elbow and makes the rest of the sleeve bunch and puff, adding to the shoulder pad effect in a very unflattering way. Not for me, thanks."
2.0,"I purchased this watch for my mother, who is blind.  We have had numerous talking watches in the past, and they always stop talking sooner or later and become useless to my mom.  This one never talked at all. I followed the directions to &#34;wake it up&#34; and the second hand started to move very fast around the dial.  The voice  (&#34;set the time, set the date&#34;, etc.) never said a thing.  Tried a new battery, tried resetting the second hand...everything I could think of.  I finally returned the watch to Amazon. It gets two stars because it does keep time with the hands, but that isn't useful to a person who is blind."
2.0,"The picture looks like a pretty coral, but in reality it's quite orange.  It fit as expected according to size chart measurements."
2.0,"ended up never using the gloves and gave them to the smallest lady with the smallest hands, and they were snug on her! these must be Asian sized"
2.0,"Cheap quality, wont be able to get more then one use out of it."
2.0,"I like Doublju stuff and have order a few of their skater skirts and shirts before, but this one was a total miss for me; I returned it promptly. The skirt is an awkward length, too long to be short but too short to be long; not really tea length, not really anything at all....Awkward all around.<br /><br />The waist band of mind did not stretch very much at all and even ordering a size up it was way too small."
2.0,Small an very hard to place ashes in.did not like the chain
2.0,Love this shirt but I got 2 size up from what I usually wear and it was still to small I got a 2xl and it fits as a medium I was a little upset cuz it didn't fit
2.0,Fitted funny because slightly bent
2.0,"It’s very light-weight, but it looks and feels like plastic because it is plastic. Looking at the photo, I thought it would blend in nicely with amethyst jewelry, but it looks and feels cheap."
2.0,"UPDATE lowered my stars b/c one shirt is a different size when I went to wear it.  It's too small and I can't send back b/c its a set. Not the best customer service on that either, I tried.<br />I ordered XL first time (I normally would buy a L or XL) and it was tighter than I would want in the body but long in arm length and body length.  I went back and bought a XXL and it was VERY long in the body and arms but fit ok in the body. I am taller too at 5'8 1/2 this still was long.  So weird fit but the material is nice, colors are bright and I wear these under tee shirts.  I haven't put the moisture wicking to the test fully yet as I keep reverting back to my favorite under armour long sleeve which works amazing but is old and needs to be replaced (hence why I bought these)."
2.0,WWAAAAYYY too small
2.0,"Not the quality I expected, but not completely horrible."
2.0,Size down - this runs BIG!  Otherwise pretty
2.0,"The bracelet had sharp edges that cut into the skin of the wrist, and the face is reflective making it very hard to read. Returned it."
2.0,Covered in red dye.
2.0,Too fit cute. Bottom was highwaisted and very cute BUT backside was too droopy
2.0,"There was a scratch on them when they arrived. QC must have missed one, but i needed them anyway...so whatever. Do better next time."
2.0,"I tried using it for a month, one side keeps coming off the end of the glasses and my glasses will then fall on the floor. The metal of the cording is heavy and gets caught in my clothing so then when I turn my head it jerks it off the ear-end of my glasses again. I liked the design, kind of pretty, but I'm going back to the sports kind that has fabric that hangs onto the back of the ear-ends instead of this kind with plastic rubbery things that let go. It's also obnoxious in that the thing hangs weird near the ear due to how it is attached the ear-ends - one person said I looked like a character from Deep Space Nine with strange draping earrings. It's just that I think I now look like an old-fashioned librarian, so if that is your gig then you might like these. Foe me this item is going to the thrift store."
2.0,No era del tamaña lo que esperaba
2.0,"Pretty and all but the ""bling"" material started separating from the purple band not long after I started wearing it...disappointed  😔"
2.0,"Had to return.  I don't consider myself &#34;large busted,&#34; but when I put this on, material stretched so much across the chest it became very see through.  Needs to be redesigned to allow more material in the top.  Material was nice and loved that it had pockets, but too self conscious to wear it."
2.0,The stitches came off on the first day of usage.The ribbons to tie bow tie came off.
2.0,"I really wanted to keep this! Had to return it because of the fit. Bottom was perfect but top was too loose. The Medium the bottom fit me perfectly but the top was loose in some important areas. It has zero support if you have boobs. I was gonna fall out of it if I got in the water. There's too much extra fabric on the top part of the bikini top so it just droops. Super bummed cause the design is super chic and totally me. I even exchanged it with a Small but that didn't work either. Extremely bummed cause I would have kept this in a heartbeat if the fit was there. It looks just like the pictures, even better in person. :( Oh well."
2.0,This does not fit loose. TIGHT
2.0,"Very cute, but runs very small!"
2.0,"Upon opening the package I noticed the leather was extremely hard.  Very difficult to bend.  Since it was leather I expected it to be soft and pliable.  Also, this band was extremely short.  I do not have a big wrist and when I put it on I was near the back holes for the buckle."
2.0,These run very small I suggest a size and a 1/2 up frfr<br />Was upset bcuz I only went a size up and they were still too small.
2.0,"I don’t know what I expected for the price but these ties look awful. Turrible. Horrid. The fabric is bad, the colors are muted and just plain odd, and they’re not at all what I expected. I guess, for the price it’s fine for 6 ties, but I’d have rather had 3 that looked good. Basically, you get what you pay for so don’t expect that much."
2.0,"Came in a nice package but missing the keychain, instead of the keychain it was a random bracelet. Sucks because it's a cute necklace :("
2.0,These are cute but you can barely see hearts at all.
2.0,"Not horrible, but not for me. The material of the dress is very pretty, the sizing was fairly accurate (I am 157lbs and ordered a sz medium which is what I typically wear and it fit good) although it was shorter than I wanted (I am 5’5”).  I ended up returning as it wasn’t what I was looking for and almost struck me as “nightgown” looking, or maybe as a bathing suit cover up...not something for engagements photos. Also, the entire dress, even with the attached lining, is see-through making it impossible to wear a bra or underwear without adding some sort or slip underneath."
2.0,Doesn't look good on me but I forgot to return it in time.  Not sure what I will do with it as it was very unflattering for my figure and barely contained my larger size chest.
2.0,"I have returned this Item for a number of reasons, firstly the tin it came in was damaged, the name on the watch wasn't the name advertised, the description shows a Spotalen, the tin it comes in says Spotalen, but the watch says Brinzi. The dial is dark, so the dark blue hands make it very hard to read. Unfortunately you cannot rely on the digital read out as this is very small.  No doubt the functionality of this watch is fine, but not ideal to read the time quickly. Some people might say what do you expect for little money? I would say, the capability to be able to read the time at a moments glance."
2.0,"hat works as advertised, but the gray hat has faded to an off brown/orange color within a week of outdoor wear"
2.0,Good mask but falls down my face. The older designs were better.
2.0,faded after 1 wash
2.0,"When I put the hat on everyone who saw it frowned and shook their heads ""NO"" ! It simply did not work plus it was too big for my head. It just looked tacky. Returned same day I received it."
2.0,"I love the style and color of this lightweight open cardigan, but this is just so poorly made. When I got it out of the package, I noticed several stray threads and one seam that was already falling apart. The neckline is not reinforced at all, so one snag will turn this into a mess of threads. Great concept, but I just can't get past the poor construction of this sweater."
2.0,Much smaller than what a large should be
2.0,Missing one key tray and 6 cabachons. Quality good. Timely delivery.
2.0,"At first I loved the bag, but I've had it now for 1 month and it's already ripped. The bag wasn't even filled and it ripped at the handle."
2.0,"Not constructed well,  the pieces of dress do not lay flat or drape on the body properly. It would not matter what your size."
2.0,I didn't know the stone would be so small. & the chain be so  cheap and light looking
2.0,"I bought this for my great niece. Fortunately before I gave the gift, I examined the dress. The fabric was positioned correctly on the bodice, however the skirt fabric was upside down. I will be returning the dress."
2.0,"Went I use for first time lost a screw , but is looking good , I know is cheap and works well"
2.0,"too small, poorly made.  Sent back"
2.0,I wanted to like this so much but the material is cheap and the fit is weird. The top does not sit right and folds over in weird places.
2.0,"I love the look of the robe, but its shaped weird.  It fits fine up top (and I have boobs 36I), but at the bottom it barely closes.  Its like it is made for someone with no kind of butt or hips.  If you even have a small serving of either, I suggest you skip this robe!  It was beautiful though."
2.0,Way too small. I have a smaller head and it was still putting a lot of pressure. No stretch.<br />HREAT material is very thick.
2.0,This dress is ok but material is thick. Dress too short.
2.0,"It works but it is not great quality, if you have big hands<br />it won't work well.<br />Bad ergonomics for an adult person."
2.0,This is so small it looks like a child's size. Not what the picture represents. Shorter then shown also. Very disappointed but this one example you get what you pay for.
2.0,"The dress has some places that weren’t sewn well, but I’ve come to expect that from all Halloween costumes.  I ordered an (XL) extra large, thinking that would give me a little extra move to move around, but the costume fit like a Large at best.  I normally wear a large but this is too snug to deal with.  Guess I wasted $22.  So disappointed."
2.0,Totally broke in a day.
2.0,"The quality of the shoes is not good and hard, and the heel is injured."
2.0,Received them yesterday with one of the earrings missing a stone...WTF? They are pretty but disappointed the one was broken.
2.0,"I did not like how there was nothing for the inner lining to support my breasts so the padding literally went up above my breasts. I had to remove the padding so I can wear it. If this were not the case, the rest of the suit would have fit just fine. If I were to go up a size it would be too large as the length of the sleeves were pretty long as it is. Bottoms fit perfectly."
2.0,The product came a day early which is nice and the jeans are cute but they run at least 1 size maybe 2 small in the waist. Fit my legs and butt great. I normally wear an XL in leggings.
2.0,"Not what I expected.  The size, color, and fabric are great, but the design is actually a decal and feels very rubbery so not sure they will work as a headband.  I have others where the design is printed or dyed onto the fabric and they are very smooth and soft."
2.0,little transparent and looks like old one because of dull color
2.0,The brim is so floppy that I cant see past it. It does not have any shape.
2.0,"I loved these socks at first, but they shrunk and the heals wore out quickly."
2.0,This shirt runs super small!
2.0,great cotton fabric/fleece but a very odd shape and way way too small.  i can't really recommend it at all i'm a size 6 blouse and doubt that even an extra large would have fit me.  medium was so much too small.  dropped shoulder might be useful if there was more volume to the sweatshirt.
2.0,"My nephew absolutely loves these shirts. However, this is what it looks like after 3 washes. I have no idea as to why the design is coming off?"
2.0,"The arms were WAY WAY to short, like defective short"
2.0,It flips over.
2.0,"Cute, but not practical whatsoever. You can really tell that these are fake glasses which isn't cute."
2.0,"I had read several review about this shoe.  They all stated that the shoe ran large, and advised buying a size smaller.  The shoe did NOT run small.  If you order it, just order the size you want.  I was expecting a shoe that was more comfortable and cushioned.  I had to return this shoe."
2.0,"I like them... Don't get me wrong, they're just not as advertised. There clip is nice, the color is nice, and they fit well. My problem is that I bought these for fishing because they say they're polarized lenses. I have polarized sunglasses... These certainly are not polarized. I guess that's just something you can say because who's actually going to know the difference. Well...I am. If you just want a nice pair of clip ons, then for the money these are a good pair. But, fisherman, DO NOT bother with these if you're<br /> looking for polarized glasses."
2.0,It's cute but i had to size way way up.  Also it's really low cut so I have to pin it bc otherwise I'm literally hanging out.
2.0,Lovely if not full<br />Too bulky if semi full plus too small size and space
2.0,Runs small. Long but very small top
2.0,"It was super cute just too small. The picture shows that it will dangle a little, well I’m a size 14-16 (large) pants and it barely latched on. Only made for smaller girls"
2.0,Not very good quality. Smaller than I imagined and look like metal cutouts with strange edges that look too much like earrings came out of a mold.
2.0,Ok outfit. The material is silky... I’m 5’5 and the pants will be too long if I don’t wear heels. The pattern doesn’t look the same in person it looks more like paint splashes.... I promise wouldn’t buy again. Just not what I was expecting
2.0,much to large for a newborn.
2.0,Had a very strong chemical smell.. And what ever they coated it with painted it whatever  caused the bag to feel sticky. I had to air it out in order  handle the odor and ended up giving it away.
2.0,I still needed to look up while using these as they offer a small field of view. Will be returning.
2.0,Not enough compression.
2.0,"Light weight. Decent grip. However, the socks turned a lot on my foot during yoga class. I had to take them off. They were becoming uncomfortable"
2.0,These are very clear and it's even hard to tell the design.
2.0,funny smell  too small  cheap looking
2.0,"These masks would fit a man’s face and were way too big and the loops were huge. They were comfortable and had nice designs, but too big for me"
2.0,"I use the bag to go to the gym and play soccer. It was never packed to the brim. The zipper zips all the way, but doesn't actually seal the bag. When I can coax it to close all the way after a few minutes, it pulls apart while I'm on my bike.<br /><br />Good looking bag at a cheap price, but it seems that I ended up getting what I paid for. Other reviews have also mentioned the zippers, so I'm not alone. Any of the people reviewing this more highly can't possibly be using their bags that often, or reviewed before they actually put it through its paces."
2.0,Not a fan they ride up your leg during the day. And dont look as god in person as the pictures. My womans least favorite underwear so I tossed them.
2.0,ordered both the black and grey the grey was PERFECT but the back was a completely different top :(
2.0,I really didn't like these at all but have no choice but to keep them as shipping is $6 to return and they only cost like $7 to begin with. I will give these to my teenaged cousins and see if they suite them better.
2.0,"The hat band is a simple ribbon with a bow attached to one end.  The total length is 30 inches, which should go around most and hat.  But, there is no method to connect the ends.  No closure devise leave connecting the ribbon or attaching to your hat, to your own imagination.  The narrative in the description is also not accurate."
2.0,"Underwire is horrible, runs small. Uncomfortable"
2.0,Ordered 2X and they were way too small
2.0,The dress fits and is comfortable but I ordered the orange and they sent me the burgundy. So I am disappointed.
2.0,"The studs are easily folded every time I put them off, one stud was broken on second day I wore it, Disappointed(((("
2.0,cheap shoes! Shoes were delivered on Friday and by Sunday one them didnt work. DO NOT BUY!!
2.0,"Nice looking, but expect low quality with the price. Mine came in broken."
2.0,This is super cute and such a nice length but it came scraped and looked kind of tarnished already. The middle was the main damage with a few specks here and there. It's really nice! But I wish it didn't come damage. I might return it.
2.0,Like the fact that its pack able but the wrinkles don't fall out. It lost it shape! I would like it better if it retained it shape.
2.0,thought it was a stone not plastic.  disappointed i wanted a gem stone.
2.0,"The fabric is SO thin. Unless you are a size 2, and super fit, I suggest buying a better made suit. You get what you pay for."
2.0,This brush appeared larger in the photo than it is . For a large handed person like myself it is hard to hold let alone brush a hat with it . The description should contain the size of the brush .
2.0,"My son loved the shoe, however, box said correct size but actual shoe that came in box was size 7."
2.0,El q tiene diseño de llama de colores al lavarlo la primera vez perdió el color.
2.0,Recieved this item and the saying was detached from the clip.  I notified the company and they kept talking about a necklace.  I didn't order a necklace.  It wasn't very much but don't waste your money on it.<br /><br />You also need a magnifying 🔎 to even read what it says.
2.0,"I bought this pack, because I have several other different brands that I really like. Every single one was too tight, and I don't have an abnormally large face."
2.0,can see in between the buttons
2.0,This was too tight. I ordered a medium because I have similar short sleeve dresses in the medium size. Picture had me believing it was not like that in some spots. Nope.
2.0,After 1 day the pendant detached from the necklace - very disappointing
2.0,"Shoes are very uncomfortable to wear for long shifts as a restaurant manager. I normally buy sketchers slip resistant, which are very comfortable. Finding a slip resistant shoe in 14.5- 15 is a struggle. Buy some good insoles if you have to buy these."
2.0,"I purchased 3 sets (pairs) of pearl ear rings as holiday gifts. 2 out of 3 arrived in good condition, but the 3rd and most expensive arrived broken - one of the 2 pearls were separated from the metal clasp. This broken set of ear rings were returned and another pair was purchased. The new pair was at least not obviously broken, but on attempting to wear them my wife found that the clasp does not close securely and spontaneously pops open. We have now returned those to exchange for another similar pair. While we like the design and appearance of the ear rings, it is very disappointing that 2 out of 4 pairs of ear rings are shipped with defects. There does not seem to be any quality control of the condition of the product that is shipped. I do not plan future purchases of this brand. My rating should be a single star, but half the items seemed fine so 2 stars seemed appropriate."
2.0,I don’t like that the shirt comes smaller then the pants. I order size small and the pants is to look that looks like a pj pants.
2.0,"Nothing special. Looks okay, but the material is so stiff that I could barely cram in my slim wallet, a compact hairbrush, and my iPhone, apart from a coupla lipsticks and pens in the zippered compartment. Be prepared to use the jaws of life to remove anything."
2.0,Very thin material  and mines has thread coming  out of the skirt.
2.0,"Not sure what I was expecting, but they are as pictured.  When we received them, we decided they looked cheap & decided to send them back."
2.0,Heavy on my nose - and whatever material the frame is made of or the coating on it - it made my skin break out. Had to clean it with Clorox.
2.0,"Color was not as expected. It’s darker and brown, not green colors as pictured."
2.0,"A very cute dress, it feels like it’s 100% spandex. Not that it fits really tight it definitely is not formfitting, but definitely feels like it’s spandex and no other material. It is cute on because it’s not self one fitting, but the chest or boob area is such a weird shape, I don’t know that any boobs would actually fit in the shape of the cups address gives you."
2.0,"Very small beads, pretty but small"
2.0,"Lens size is great, but the arm length is incredibly short. These should be listed as children’s costume glasses."
2.0,these are usable but the pieces on the clips fell off in a week.
2.0,These were really comfortable when I put them on but they flat within hours and now that I've had them awhile they have stretched out something terrible. I'm very disappointed.
2.0,I am 200 lbs with a curvy body. Hips with small waistline. I ordered an XL and these are tight (smothering) my thighs. Uncomfortable so I had to return. Maybe need a bigger size but I don’t want the stomach loose fit
2.0,Claps was welded together
2.0,Very nice but changed colors after my first swear.
2.0,The nose pieces were stitched into place (they are not supposed to be) and we unable to be used properly.
2.0,They don't work for me. I'm almost always too close or too far away. It's frustrating to try and use them.
2.0,Was not exactly what I was expecting... Returning
2.0,It was pretty when it came in but I gifted it so don’t have input on quality
2.0,"Boots had a terrible smell even after airing out in garage over night. Also, the leather doesn't look genuine."
2.0,Took forever to get and it's pretty cheap looking.
2.0,"The one I got didn't look like the picture it looks like a little boys costume. The mask is also attached which it looks like in the picture that its a separate piece. Wouldn't recommend for a women, it would be a great Halloween costume for a boy though."
2.0,"These are high quality items. Unfortunately, they were made backwards. You have to push the post through the back of your ear instead of the front. This was the case in all but one of the screws."
2.0,Clasp broke on the second wear despite fitting fine or even loose
2.0,Sound bot was very comfortable & wide looks just like picture BUT... on the inside for the hat were the sound is located fell apart & was not useful at all honestly DON'T waste your money😐👆👆👆👆👇👇👇👌👌👌👌
2.0,They sent the wrong size and the drawstring was large enough to secure a boat. The quality was good though. I Just didn't like the pants
2.0,Sits very high like an empire waist...which unfortunately makes me look pregnant.
2.0,Not as good as the short sleeve
2.0,Not as nice as the photo
2.0,"Disappointed, since it did not fit the ring we have. The guard we received was for a woman's ring and we have a man's ring. It did not show this in ad when ordered."
2.0,"very cute waist belt but unfortunately upon receiving the belt, ribbon was split on one side... i have to look for similar colored ribbon to replace it.."
2.0,Glasses run big and are more for men than women. I also found lenses darker than expected. I returned them and seller was great with my return.
2.0,The caps started ripping after one use
2.0,These are pants yes. They look like the pics however the quality is anything but stellar. Definitely not worth the amount they charge. The product is very thin and nothing like true cargo pants.
2.0,It's well made but runs small.
2.0,"Top, especially bra, way too small. The large is maybe a medium. If you have a chest go bigger!"
2.0,This would fit great but the metal piece doesn’t stay on. It’s almost unwearable.
2.0,give away - at first I kept it then I realized I would not wear it because it just did not fit right?
2.0,The sizing is definitely wrong on this product. The material is very slinky. It will show every flaw you have.
2.0,5 feet 3 and 154lbs needed medium.  Large was way too big. Fabric is thin.
2.0,The shirt shrunk on the first wash. it was very disappointing. I would suggested getting two sizes up because it will shirt two size after the first wash.
2.0,"Have a few other dresses like this, but they are better quality. The material on this was extremely thin and see through."
2.0,I ordered a size large. I am a size 8. I like my short's loose. A large in these were still too tight for my preferred fit.  I have working thighs.  :)
2.0,"Color good , material nice just made smaller then expected"
2.0,"fabric is soft,thin and clingy. Not flattering at all in Medium, my usual size (size 8)"
2.0,"print is off and blurry, edges unfinished and not sewn properly"
2.0,"I have a high instep, and these have a very low tight instep.  Also, the circumference was just a tad to tight, making it impossible to get my foot into the boot.  I wish descriptions gave information on instep height.  For instance, the size could tell you the the circumference of instep/heel.  Mine in 12.5&quot; and if the instep of the boot is smaller than that I wouldn't waste my time purchasing it, no matter how cute I thing they are.  I had to return these."
2.0,"Some laces have a penchant of untying themselves-quite annoying, unless you want to double knot them like a child. These are a tad better than the laces these replaced, but not by much."
2.0,The child could hardly walk with them.
2.0,"Too small, will be returning this item."
2.0,Just so you know:  This T-shirt is NOT an official Buzz Aldrin Get Your Ass To Mars T-shirt.  It's an obvious knock off.  The official shirts have Buzz's signature on the front lower right corner below the GYATM logo (clearly visible).  The label on the inside has the Buzz Aldrin trade mark.
2.0,Barely 2 and a half months of part time use and they came apart. My last brand lasted just about two years with full time use. Will not be buying these again.
2.0,Way smaller than expected. Followed the size chart.
2.0,I was not pleased with this watch it looks really cheap and the extra little strap to hold the band has already broken and I have only tried it on i feel like it was a waste of money
2.0,"Quality  wise,  not worth  the price.  Seems very cheap and the chain is tiny. Does glow though."
2.0,turned green on neck first couple wears would not buy again
2.0,"It runs very small and the material is see though and feels like a shower curtain. Also arrived slightly damaged. I returned it, don’t recommend."
2.0,Looks cheaper then i thought it would
2.0,"Too thin, not at all suitable for a beach with rocks"
2.0,Ordered medium and returned for large... gave large away... sleeves long and baggy and body way to tight.  Great fabric though.. and color
2.0,"The top of the shirt was too small, but the bottom was good. It was just a really weird cut. I felt like the sleeves hung way too low, and the chest width was too narrow. Also, the material was woven... very much like a cottony twill. Not a flattering shirt."
2.0,Sits off to the side crap material and hot
2.0,This bag is cute but very cheaply made I don't think it would last very long unless you are person who doesn't carry much in your purse.
2.0,This dress is just...weird. The material was like a reusable grocery bag but also stretchy? I got this dress in the blue color and it came as a royal blue vs. the heathered blue that was pictured. I’m 5’3 and 160 pounds and ordered the dress in a medium. I thought the dress was short on me and wish it had a couple more inches (stopped right under my butt). This dress is also thick! It is probably a good idea to wear in the spring/fall time vs. the summer. It also didn’t have a tag so I have no clue what was the front and what was the back. I wouldn’t buy it if I tried it on in the store.
2.0,I didn’t like these. A lot of them were bent
2.0,"Not an adult product, very delicate. for newborns ."
2.0,"Came smaller than the &#34;Large&#34; on the label, then shrunk after the first wash. I will probably have to donate it after the next wash."
2.0,"Quality is lacking all around. Missing a letter!  (Does no one check these before they go out?) The rest of the letters look terribly spaced and feel as if they’ll fall off after one wash. Didn’t even try on, so can’t speak to size. Fabric felt rough and itchy. Was looking forward to this shirt. Saw it somewhere else, excited to find it cheaper here. Now I know why.<br /> Second star only bc it came a day early, which was a nice surprise (until I opened it and was then disappointed)."
2.0,The size does not match the description.<br />Nice product but now I have to spend time returning it and I will reorder as my daughter likes them.
2.0,very cheap fabric. Extremely thin. Just gave it away.
2.0,"They were not comfortable at all. The piece in the back on the Achilles's was digging in. I had to return them, just too uncomfortable."
2.0,They fell off very easily and got lost. Dermatologist told us to get them. It was a waste of money.  I wish we could get our money back.
2.0,Material is very cheap and sticky
2.0,"Very pretty colors, but when it stretches, the color changes significantly. Fabric is far too thin to wear for anything except sleep/lounging around the house.  Tried a slip but it was so thin, the seams on the slip showed through.  Very undersized; length okay but largest size did not fit my size 14 body. Disappointing!"
2.0,"The cloth is soft and it feels comfortable on, but feels cheap. The fit is not flattering at all on me. I suppose if someone is slim, it would look good on them. But if you’re not - it will add nothing to your look. The neckline feels too high for a dress. I bought the black one with white polka dots on it. The dots were huge!!! It might have looked better if the dots were smaller. I’m returning it."
2.0,Whatever was used to make it black or tarnish its color not really impressed with that I've only had it on 24 hours to see how it would do and I'm stuck at home and dont do much. So I'm not impressed with the coating other than that I like the design I wish I could find someone who can do custom work I have a idea for one existing ring that just needs some tweaking to make it my own if there's anybody out there who could design a ring for me I have the idea I just need some one to get it done to it to make it officially my own I'll check back for comments in two days so if anybody knows someone who can help me out that would be great. thank you
2.0,These are very tiny and thin. The price is cheap...this is one of those times you get what you pay for.
2.0,"The bracelet isn't as big in the picture and I have a small wrist and I was clipping it on and putting it on my wrist and the anchor part broke off the next day after,the whole anchors part of the bracelet came apart and then the chain part just broke off and so did the clip. It's cute but it breaks easily."
2.0,"The beaded necklace is cute, but unfortunately only lasted about 2 weeks before breaking. It was also tricky getting my mask to stay on."
2.0,Extremely small. Great for kids not adults
2.0,This is comically short (I’m only 5ft 2in) and it’s clearly a cheap knockoff of the dress on the model 🙄.
2.0,Paid too much for this cheap made item. Won't buy again!!! Lesson learned.
2.0,"I saw this dress on multiple Instagram accounts and loved it. I ordered the coral colored dress and I thought it would look great for a summer wedding. When I unpackaged it, I LOVED. Unfortunately when I put it on, it was completely see through. I don’t see a slip working with this because of the way the top is cut. Sadly, I will be returning it."
2.0,"I was excited to receive this wedge sandal, but unfortunately, it wasn’t as described.  It came in just a plastic bag, sandals were smashed, no arch support, and it  feels like I was wearing hard plastic.  Don’t go through the trouble of ordering it, then having to return it, waste of time."
2.0,"I wasn't too impressed with what I was expecting, especially with the price tag. They're nicely designed frames but they're ineffective at blocking blue lights. Save yourself some money for something better."
2.0,The color pink does not look like the pic it's a very faint pink.
2.0,I did not like he earrings at all. They were too big for my taste. Not the best quality.
2.0,I gave it two stars because I ordered and paid for a 2-pack black/burgundy heather. The package I received had only the burgundy heather. I’d like to know where is my black jogger.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this shirt.  The material is nice and light without being see through, and the color is vibrant.<br />After that,  it all goes wrong.<br />The bust seam sits too high on the chest makingit blouse out too much in front.  The pleats in the back seam make it blouse out too much back, and the ruffle at the bottom pulls it back in at the hip giving the overall barrel shape appearance.<br />Definitely NOT flattering.<br />Even pear shaped figures will look like an apple.<br />Returning these ASAP."
2.0,I didn’t care for this bandeau. The pads are round and pretty noticeable. Doesn’t provide the lift I wanted. It is comfortable though.
2.0,"5'2, 200 poundsish, I purchased an extra large.<br /><br />VERY HEAVY MATERIAL. I wanted a slouchy shirt to wear when it's hot. This not only thick, but an extra large would fit perhaps a size 24/26. I am a 16/18. I looked like a child playing dress up. I am returning it, and not repurchasing. If you size way down, and want something warm, get this."
2.0,Not great quality but i guess it'll do...
2.0,"I'm a bike commuter.  The folks in my office refer to this as my shower cap.  It is HUGE.  Far bigger than my winter helmet (a Bell Somethingorother from Target - plenty chunky in its own right).  I actually use a binder clip to take up some of the slack on the front.  So what?, I figured.  It's for safety, not fashion.  Well, maybe.  One night my husband was in the car and I was riding my bike the other direction, and he commented that other than my headlight, I wasn't very visible from the front.  ""But isn't my head practically glowing?"" I asked.  He said it wasn't at all.  An experiment with a flashlight shows that the helmet only looks reflective when the light source is at the same level as your eyes.  In that case it's really really reflective.  But sitting in a car, with your eyes way above the headlights?  Nothing.<br /><br />I assume this is the case with all Illuminite fabric, and it surprises me.  Maybe someone has had a different experience, but I sure wouldn't spend my money on any of it expecting cars to be able to see me.<br /><br />On the upside, it's a really bright color in daylight.  It's also water resistant and keeps my head a little bit warmer in winter because it keeps the breeze down.  But as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't do the main thing it's supposed to do."
2.0,When I ordered this pant I thought I was ordering 5.11 but when I received it I instantly realized that<br />Is not the 5.11.  It's a made in China and the material is no where near the 5.11 quality. Disappointed ''
2.0,It falls apart fast
2.0,The watch broke after I wore it for 2 weeks. But still a look look before it broke.
2.0,"I ordered both the adult womens size small and medium for my small 13 yr old daughter (she's a foot smaller than all her peers, people think she's 10 yrs old!) and she couldn't get the small or the medium even up or down over her body.  She still wears childrens size clothing so there is no reason at all why this dress shouldn't fit her.  Other than that it appears to be made nicely, it seemed durable but the body of the dress looked like it should fit a 7 yr old child."
2.0,They cute and small but the back piece comes off eazy I’ve already lost half the pack
2.0,I got these because I wanted strawberry earrings for my Halloween costume and I couldn’t even open them to put them on.
2.0,Small cut through the arms.
2.0,"The description says 3mm but compared to my other nitrile gloves that are also 3mm, they are comparably thinner and feel lower quality."
2.0,"Shirt is as pictured,  but 4 sizes too small. Otherwise made well."
2.0,Was not happy with this when i received it. It is like half the size that appears on the site. Very disappointed. Make sure you don't order if you are expecting it to be long.
2.0,My son like it but it would have been way better if it came with pockets.
2.0,"These definitely fit small, so i haven't even worn them. I hope to find someone with a shoe size smaller to pass them on to."
2.0,The item was cheaply made and was too tight to fit around my ankle.  It does not look as nice in real life as it does online.
2.0,Way stiff material and very small
2.0,"When I first bought these slippers it was wonderful. They did seem to run a little large but they were like walking on fluffy air.  After 2 weeks of wearing them, the Memory Foam became flat and stayed that way permanetly. So it was really a waste of money."
2.0,"Cheap material, snug in all the wrong places. Returned."
2.0,"Bra was very comfy but was way to small. I’m a 34G cup, the bra fit two sizes too small."
2.0,Very disappointed because it is a dark grey with hardly any blue hues. I loved the blue in pic.  There was not a get to choose. It was white or blue. I have the white and love it. I get lots of compliments. Can where it casual or a little dressy. I just wanted the blue. Not sure if I will return it
2.0,"I love love this set of earrings. I purchased them because they were sterling silver. I'm highly allergic to certain metals so I can only wear sterling silver or gold. The posts on these  earrings are not sterling silver. 10 minutes after I had these in my ear, my ear began to burn, then started turning black. I knew immediately the posts weren't real. Too bad too. Super cute earrings. Wish they would have been sterling silver."
2.0,I didn’t wear it because it didn’t look like the photo it shows that the sleeves go to your wrist and the one I received stopped at the elbow.
2.0,"Wanted to love these as the cut is great, fabric is perfect, and they look good. But the sides are badly sewn and created miniature holes on the sides. Seems quality control is low on these as they fit me perfectly."
2.0,This is truly misleading advertisement: I can see every blue item with these glasses. They need to be reported for wrong advertisement!
2.0,"Well made and functional. Reason for two stars is that outside is so slippery it keeps falling out of my back pocket ... even after two years of use. At least 10 times to date no matter how careful I am, but fortunately recovered every time. Seriously not good for a wallet."
2.0,"The purse is a lot smaller than showed on picture.  The metal is gold not silver like the picture shown.  It’s a very pretty bag, but way too small."
2.0,"They looked good, but my face broke out in a rash from them. I do not have sensitive skin and I've had a rash twice in my life."
2.0,The pin less attachment didn’t stay in place for my Fitbit. The minute I tried to put it around my wrist the band popped out. I have a Fitbit Versa 2.
2.0,Didn’t expand as much as I needed or thought it should
2.0,Cute But their was scratches on the Mk medal !
2.0,Shirt runs small. I ordered based on the size chart and it did not fit; has no stretch. Cute shirt though.
2.0,"Looks really nice, however the pads are horrible and need to be changed."
2.0,"I purchased this dress in &#34;cream&#34; it was white, white when it arrived, the top portion nearly see through.  The sequin on the skirt had a pink tink to them as well.  It is very high waisted even in comparison to how high the picture shows and it was a bizarre fit because of that.  The zipper also wasn't sewn in right and bulged out on the side, the neckline also seemed to be cut incorrectly as I couldn't get it to lay right.  To top it off the sequins fold under at the bottom of the skirt for the hem and are incredibly itchy.  I bought the dress for a bachelorette party and knew I would be walking quite a bit and was afraid I'd have cuts on my legs by the end of the night, because just walking back and forth across my hose once I had scratch marks.  Needless to say, I wasn't pleased with the dress (the price should have been a warning but I took a chance because I was just planning to wear it one night) and I returned it."
2.0,"CHEAP, CHEAP WATCH BAND..."
2.0,"It holds in the belly, butt, and thighs okay but I found the material a little scratchy and uncomfortable. The straight slip they use at David's Bridal when trying on dresses is better."
2.0,Material is very mediocre.
2.0,Hurts my face a ton!
2.0,The model picture looks great but its frumpy looking on. May be better on a petite person. I returned it. Material and quality fine but not me.
2.0,Purchased 3 different colors (1 for each of my daughters). They are extremely cute but are VERY cheaply made (which was expected due to the price) but I expected it to last more than a week.
2.0,"It fits fine, but the material is very thin and cheap. This will not keep you even slightly warm. I expected much more for $50."
2.0,My husband is 6'2&#34; and 200 lbs.  I ordered the XXL and it was too small/tight.
2.0,"Even though I sized up, it was still too small and looked like a cheap skirt for a very young girl."
2.0,Very think and nice quality. But under the arms is so big.
2.0,Loved the design however it broke after having it about 6 weeks
2.0,The color and size are true to advertising however the scarf itself is lesser quality fabric than it appears in pictures. I would not buy again.
2.0,"Chinese crap, definitely not as nice/detailed as the picture."
2.0,"I bought this mask so that people can read my lips but it doesn't fit well around my nose to ensure safe closure of the mask towards my face.  The other problem is that the plastic part is too close to my mouth so that when I breathe, it fogs up the mask.  Maybe it doesn't fit me well but it might on someone else."
2.0,"Well I love the ring at first. However, after 8/9 wears the ring broke in half. Then I noticed that any small easy to form tear the ring breaks. If you don’t have a job that requires you to use your hands this ring is great. However as I have discovered, the larger thicker rings are there for a reasons. These feel great but any little cut and this ring will fail."
2.0,"Too small. Cut was nothing like the photo. Nothing about this was spaceman other than the photo which looks Vulcan. You don't get the ears. And other than matching the hair color, nothing (absolutely nothing) matches the photo. Did I mention that it arrived almost a week after the quoted delivery estimate. Not cool."
2.0,"The only thing polar about these is the name. They are lined, but even with the lining they are very thin. And the leg length is short. Very dissatisfied."
2.0,"It is pretty but much too thin, Clasps are so tiny it is very hard to close or open. Description on product should be posted on sale page."
2.0,It does not have the same fit as it shows in the picture:(
2.0,"They bleed through your clothes. I wore the hot pink one to the gym and when I removed my tshirt, I noticed thy my tank was all stained with the color of my bra."
2.0,Did not send belt. Had to return
2.0,LOVED IT BUT IT WAS TOOO SMALL..
2.0,"Very disappointed with this watch.  It is extremely small.  If you're a woman or a very small man and you're looking for a watch like this then go ahead and buy it, but other than that stay away from it."
2.0,Están muy elegantr
2.0,I love the necklace But I’ve only had it one month and I wore it tonight for the second time and it broke!  I am four days past the return window. I am devastated.
2.0,"Giving two stars only because it was packaged very well, and clock/watch pieces are very pretty, plus they are not plastic as I'd thought they would be. BUT the large pocket watch looking piece that sits at the knot of the tie is attached to the tie with the tiniest drop of glue. So the main piece fell off of the tie during shipping, and wasn't attached when I received it. Will have to do some gluing/stitching to reattach and hold in place."
2.0,"I like the design and quality, but the hat was too small for me (too shallow, if you can imagine what I mean). I'm not convinced that this hat was manufactured with an adult in mind. Or maybe I just have a big head? I don't know; In any case, I wouldn't repurchase this hat."
2.0,Didn't fit and was to short for my taste.
2.0,"I bought these in April 2018 because I wanted good arch support, and overall the reviews seemed to be good. I'm a size 8 to 8.5 and I have wide feet. I was quite pleased at the beginning because of the soft and bouncy feel, and the arch support was quite good. However, I did notice that, unlike with flip-flops, my feet would sweat more in the Telics. But what I really didn't like was the fact that after a few months, they got wider and wider to a point where my feet would move forward quite a bit when walking (see photo). Even worse is that the front sole folds under my feet when I walk a bit faster. I have almost fallen several times because of this, and it's especially dangerous when going down stairs. I'm putting up with it until its first anniversary in April 2019, just to get a bit more from the amount I paid, but I cannot recommend it. If I'm an 8-wide and I have this problem, I can imagine what they would be for regular size 8 feet."
2.0,"Love the pants but they run so small! Order at least one side up, if not two!"
2.0,"The (S) dress fit me very well (5’7” 122 lb) but the points at the sleeves make this dress look kind of witchy, more like a Halloween costume. It’s very lightweight and the shape is flattering  but it’s made from a very wrinkly material (so even if I fixed the sleeves it wouldn’t be for me) and I’m returning it."
2.0,The gold color was so off that I can't use it on my purse @ all. Do not recommend.
2.0,"Nice bra, but I wore and washed only once and the underwire popped out! Other bras I’ve had can go for years without this happening."
2.0,"XL for my full figure, but since I'm short, the skirt goes halfway to my knees. Didnt care for the way the bust fit, either, didnt feel secure.  I didnt keep it."
2.0,Too small and it doesn't fit my wrist because the band is so short. Ordered a nato  band but it was too thick to fit through the pins.
2.0,The sleeves are too short and the material wasn’t what I expected. It’s not really stretchy like I thought it would be. It’s more like Jersey. It’s pretty high quality but not a firm fitting shirt like I thought it would be.
2.0,"These shoes are so cute and my kid loves them. However, a piece of the shoe popped off within 2 minutes of wear. Now we have to tie a knot so the size adjuster stays on. It didn’t break, it just fell apart because it clearly wasn’t made correctly.  Disappointed."
2.0,"I received 50%polyester and 47% modal and 3% spandex  jeans and they were listed as  Fabric: 49% Cotton, 49% Rayon, 19% Polyester and 3% Spandex. Sent back. Way too shiny and stretchy for me. Fit was large on me."
2.0,Cheap looking. The underside of the football charm is hollow curved interior.  I gave it 2 stars because the chain is nice.
2.0,Very tight. Not easy to get on or off
2.0,Liked the pattern of it<br />BUT<br />Wasaay short both front n back<br />Feels n fits like it was designed for a child.
2.0,It's seems to be a cheaper product than it looks in the picture.
2.0,"Lenses have this perpetual 'dirty feel' on them. First day I got it, I washed the lenses thinking they were dirty. No, they just made that way and makes you want to always want to wash them."
2.0,can't keep them on.. had to return them.
2.0,"They easily come out of nose, which is why I bought such a large pack I was hoping theyd stay in better since I always lose nose rings. They also look kinda cheap up close but you get what you pay for. Other than that it was a decent buy."
2.0,This outfit is more like an over priced pair of tights with a matching v-neck. It does NOT hang off the shoulders and the material is cheap. I gave it 2 stars only because I didn’t return it; I gave it to my 16 year old niece. Wouldn’t recommend especially for the price!
2.0,The material is a huge turn-off. Very cheap looking.
2.0,Magnets are very weak.  They are the main reason I bought the game board.
2.0,looks better in the photo that it does in person
2.0,The color is red not purple as pictured & the materials used feel plastic. Not something that I will use. I would pass this on for use in a dress up box for kids.
2.0,"Did not fit, just would not seat like originals. One fit okay but the other would not click in. Returned for refund, seller did take care of issue, now concerned about ordering other brands as well."
2.0,This bracelet was so cute and I was so exited when I got it. But it broke after like three wears. The chain ripped.
2.0,"Tight, thin material and just plain cheap looking"
2.0,Love the idea behind these compression wide calf socks. Beautiful style. These are the same size i buy in all my compression socks but i can't get them over my heel to put them on. Everything about them to look at brings me joy. I am going to exchange for a larger size and try again to get them on.
2.0,strap part is good but the o rings they hook onto the glasses DOES NOT STAY ON KEEP PULLING OFF. I will find a way to make them work just not yet
2.0,"I wear an xl to 2xl, so I ordered the largest size offered 5xl-6xl just to be safe since it runs small (Asian). I still could not fit into the skirt and the top was way too short. It is a nice piece, well made, but that was unexplainable! Ridiculous!"
2.0,"Such a cute outfit. Got a 5T for my 5 yr old niece but it’s way too small, closer to a 2T size. Her little sister gets it now."
2.0,Huge ! A small was massive . I’m 120 5’9 DDD for reference and it fits like a large . Size down
2.0,I expected it to last longer than 5 months.  We replaced the battery and the watch still doesn't work.
2.0,Why are these slippers so noisy? It sounds like I'm walking on candy wrappers or something. They're not very comfy either. I can feel the ground kinda through the soles. I gave 2 stars because they're at least warm. I'm disappointed and wouldn't recommend. You get what you pay for
2.0,They are ok. Nothing special. I don't think I would purchase again
2.0,"I wore these for 2 hours tubing in 28 degree weather and my hands were so cold I had to go inside halfway through to warm them back up. Very disappointed. They're comfortable, reasonably priced, and my hands stayed dry. But they're not warm enough."
2.0,"The belt looks great! At first. It may be real leather, but the color isn't real. It's painted, and after a while that paint peels off and looks terrible. Not a long term belt.<br /><br />Buckle is very nice."
2.0,the straps broke and I don't even have that big of a head :(
2.0,The toe area is much more narrow than other Saucony shoes I have purchased. I have a wide toes with a very narrow heel so finding the right balance is tricky. I love Saucony Grid Stratos 5 but they are always out of stock. Moving to Cohesion 10 and hopefully they fit.
2.0,"The sunglasses are cute, but, they are very wide.. They slip off when looking down."
2.0,"Super cute product, but I bought this for a trip to Vegas, and I was really disappointed that the strap broke the first time I wore it! I would've given 1 star except that it did fit well and look good while the strap held itself."
2.0,"Like another reviewer, I didn't even try it on...the fabric is really weird. It's super thin and cheap feeling and not soft and has zero give/stretch. And the color is more of a neon dark pink, it's not a pretty red, but really bright. I'm returning it."
2.0,the straps that go across the chest are loose and have to much slack to it
2.0,"It's looks nothing like what's in the video to me. It's thin instead of wide, and it just looks and feels like the generic version of the real, more expensive version."
2.0,I got the size XL and it's still really small on my chest. I'm normally a 34DD and I'm 5'8. The torso does seem a tad small but I think you could get away with it with the straps.
2.0,Looks like Dollar store Material!
2.0,The laces are way too long and wide. They don't stay tied. Makes the shoe look sloppy.
2.0,"I'm 5'7&#34; 145lb (35B chest, 28 waist, 39 hips); Bought the M - The top is awkwardly large in the quantity of material and fits snug to the body (not tight), but the middle is loose/baggy and not in a good way, and then the bottom is tight again. They're also short for me in length, so I can't layer them the way I wanted to. It's an awkward spandex material, so baggy spandex is just a mess of an outfit. I find myself putting these shirts on, trying to make them work, and then taking them off again. The swoop neck is awkward. Something is just off."
2.0,The belt apparently has two layers of 'leather' glued together. The layers separated after about 2 weeks of use. Absolute junk.
2.0,Hard. Not soft at all.
2.0,Quality is not good. It’s small and it feels and looks VERY CHEAP.
2.0,"I usually wear a small-medium. Im 5 ft 7, fit at 130 lbs, wear size 3 pants, but i have broad shoulders & large chest (32 DD), and the large fits well, anything smaller may have pulled on the arms or spanned at bust. The coat is not really coat weight, it is more similar to a medium weight cotton shirt. There is no liner, and this was the biggest disappointment because it makes it look quite chincy. The photo of the model indicates a patterned liner, but this coat has all exposed seams & even some uncut strings & unfinished trimmings. I am going to try and get someone to sew a liner in it for me. 1st 3 photos show the inside of the coat,  and one of the outside, after I ironed it (it was a crumpled mess). It was a cheap purchase but I wouldnt have paid that much for it due to the quality."
2.0,"COMPRÉ UN PAR  EN MAYO DEL 2019, SIN EMBARGO, POCOS MESES DESPUÉS TUVE QUE BOTARLAS PORQUE SE ROMPIÓ UNA DE LAS TIRAS Y ESPERANDO QUE FUERA UN DEFECTO DE LA PARTIDA, COMPRE OTRO PAR IDENTICO, DE OTRO COLOR, EN ENERO DE ESTE AÑO 2020<br />SE ROMPIÓ EN LA MISMA PARTE.<br />SON MUY CÓMODAS, PERO LA CALIDAD ES PÉSIMA Y NO SON ECONÓMICAS.<br />UNA LÁSTIMA."
2.0,"Had doubts, but took a chance based on reviews and customer photos.  Petite reviewer shared:  too big for her, but 3X sister could wear.  Thought these would be roomy/generous cut.  Normally wear 1X.  Pants I received had tight waist and were a second skin when I managed to pull them on.  Also closer to crop pant length instead of full length.  Both are available and took care to order full length style #.  Maybe inconsistent quality control if big/long for some and small/short for others.  Fabric is thinner than any tops I have and quite sheer in the taupe.  Not what I expected and not for me. Returning."
2.0,Fits fine but brown is definitely not brown. Looks like a nude color/pinkish. Not what I expected when ordering brown camo.
2.0,This is really pretty but it breaks extremely easily. The first day the dangling rhinestones fell off and then the chain kept popping.
2.0,Sadly too big to be useful
2.0,I was not impressed at all with this dress.  It was very difficult to keep the sleeves up on my shoulders...wouldn’t order this again or recommend it to anyone.
2.0,I bought this in May. After a handful of uses I already have a hole in one of the pockets.<br />Atleast it is an internal hole
2.0,It was good for like a week before the buckle wouldn't clasp into the hole and would keep popping off.  Also this belt was more for aesthetics than function.  My stomach does not burst at the seams.  It was just designed poorly. Don't waste your money.
2.0,Great feeling. Down side is first 3 I took out of bag had rips in the seam on left leg. Pretty disappointed in this for cost.
2.0,"I bought the X- Large. The sticker on the package shows X-large, however when attempting to put them on the were smaller than advertised. The were maybe a large at best. I ended giving them to a coworker who has a smaller face and head."
2.0,Heavy and the charm isn’t flat it’s 3D so it rolls around
2.0,This top is much less a-line than the picture appears. It's more of a straight cut with a very quick increase in circumference past the hips. I have an average length waist and this didn't flare til well past my hips. It also feels cheap- squeaky fabric. I sent it back.
2.0,"I tried to unscrew the ball, and the cross popped right off... smh not cool"
2.0,Was exactly what my daughter wanted. The quality isn’t bad. It’s leather. But the strap is not connected at all. I was going to get creative and attach it myself but the connecting piece is only hanging on by 1 thread. So I opted to return the purse.
2.0,"I liked it, but the end broke the second time I wore it.  Not quality apparently."
2.0,"I am a size 16 and they fit just fine. My only complaint about the fit is that the seam in the middle of the crotch tends to pull them down, so you are constantly feeling like they have a droopy crotch and need to be pulled back up. While they are not sheer like nylons, they are definitely not opaque. If you don't wear something to cover your rear end, everyone will know exactly what color and pattern underwear you have on. I would never buy these again!!"
2.0,Just too loose for my hands. Or any normal sized hands. They run just too big. The description should have mentioned it. The quality is good through but unusable for me.
2.0,This is a strange dress. The slit is too high and the bulk lays right at the widest part of the hip. I thought I'd wear it with a belt but it would look weird. Sending it back.
2.0,"I wanted to love this, but just couldn’t justify the price. Why are women’s PJ sets so overpriced? I just want to be cozy while I watch Netflix and don’t want to worry about the $50 I spent on ONE lounge set. Make it make sense."
2.0,"Don’t be fooled. May be printed in USA, but the shirt is manufactured in Nicaragua. Boo. Good quality shirt, but should be made in USA from start to finish for this price. I have others that are."
2.0,"I only received the top of this two piece bathing suit. Cute, but I kinda need bottoms."
2.0,"The skirt had potential even with the thin material however it cuts very small and typically a medium, so I ordered a medium. Needless to say that wouldn’t go past my size. I’ve been sized up and ordered a large and that was extremely tight."
2.0,"These were fairly short waisted.  Ok for just wearing around the house, but not great for outside use.  Somewhat see through and too shiny for my liking."
2.0,Didn’t fit right over husbands beard but the kid loved it.
2.0,I have the house of Sunny dress and this one is just ok. The fabric looks like it will wear and start balling after a couple of wears. My House of Sunny one looks fits and material is much more superior to this one…you pay for what you get. I returned this one and kept the original.
2.0,the pockets drop down if you have something heavy like a phone in them but are good for working out and water activity
2.0,Material is like that cheap Halloween costume material.  Definitely does not look the same in person as online
2.0,To large and thin and don't look like what I seen in pictures
2.0,Hahaha looks nothing like the picture.
2.0,"It was too small, with just 3 keys and two CC, I could not close the wallet. It would be impossible with the full set and coins."
2.0,Material is VERY thin.
2.0,Not real leather.....looks cheap but buckles are nice??
2.0,I am a size Large and couldn't even get these on even though they are super stretchy.  I would return them but it's probably not cost effective.  They were slightly too big for my 11 year old daughter who is a size 00 or Small.
2.0,"I wear a 46 and ordered an XL which according to the chart fits 46-48. But it was too small throughout, shoulders, chest, arms.  Also the quality of construction was not great"
2.0,"Billed as walking shoes, these sneakers are not comfortable for the long haul.  They don’t appear to have any arch support - just flat shoes with some foam.  They’re cute - but folks like us are looking for comfort, and some support - so these don’t work for us."
2.0,Too small and looks better in the picture than the actual item
2.0,"Cute shirt HOWEVER,  The neck hole is extremely small and the shirt in general is really tiny.  I ordered the largest (sz 5) for my 3 year old Grand son hoping he could wear it a little longer as they grow so fast.  Well, not the case.  He will wear this once or twice and be out of it.  That is if we can get it over his head.  And if it doesnt shrink one ounce after washing !"
2.0,"This is the same quality as something you get from Wish. There are no darts on the chest area, so it sticks out on the sides. The fabric is not stretchy. The fit is also smaller than expected, even when using the size chart."
2.0,This dress is so cheap looking and very unflattering. Will return soon.
2.0,The shirt looks longer in the picture. At 5’5” this shirt comes down to my waistline so was pretty disappointed. Material doesn’t feel totally nice either.
2.0,I ordered a medium which was too small and the large was too big
2.0,Shorter than I thought it would be. More.like an over sized shirt.
2.0,No opening for urination; too many seams to sit on. We men need fewer seams in our underwear as possible!<br />Thx-Scotty
2.0,"It takes too long to arrive, the color and quality is acceptable.  I was not really impressed."
2.0,Writing too small. Unable to read
2.0,Sleeves are short and really thin material.
2.0,"Size 12 is way too small for my 12 year old. I knew as soon as I opened the box and looked at it that it would be too small. And normally leotard sizes don't have to be exact because if they're a little tight it's fine...its a leotard...its supposed to be tight right? But this was uncomfortable for her it was so tight (for reference she's 5ft. 3in. and slim so she's normally fine in anything that's girls size large or XL). I was very disappointed that their sizing is so far off.<br />I'm taking a picture of it next to a different leotard that is a SIZE 8 and will post here for reference as well.<br />Also the stitching is already unraveling in 3 places that I saw immediately around the top, which would be very noticeable if she could actually wear it. I didn't bother inspecting it any further. And with no returns it's going in the trash."
2.0,Hard to put on and very little directions included. Not overly impressed so far. They give you 6 because you easily mess up at least 1 trying to put it on then I don’t see them staying in place very long either.
2.0,"It’s difficult to breathe in these masks, but I wanted to try them. They fog up and are very hot to wear as a nurse. I wanted to try them because I want my patients to see me smile at them."
2.0,Wife said it runs small and it's made cheaply
2.0,"Doesn't look like the picture, can't even try to make it work. Scratchy material, but weird"
2.0,Cute but ordered gold & received silver. Returned and didn’t reorder
2.0,It's good kind
2.0,"Quality is not good. Only after a few weeks of using this, the shorts was already showing some wear and tear!"
2.0,"I was excited to receive these as a gift, but when I took them out of the packaging I noticed they came with a hole between the fingers and multiple huge threads loose."
2.0,"The products is not the color in the picture. This shirt, not sweater, is baby blue in color and has the weight of a thick t shirt. Not at all was expected."
2.0,Poor quality shirts.  Button color bled onto the shirt after the 1st wash.  Also the white lines on the shirt started coming off after 1 wash. The yellow Coofandy shirt also lost the lines after the 1st wash.  Pictures of the purple attached.
2.0,The quality is not great. After a few uses the see through part is coming un done and looks old a worn
2.0,Beautiful box but lid was broken loss from hing
2.0,The print is so pretty but the shirt fit as though it was 4 sizes too big. So much extra material. Returning.
2.0,Fits my 3 and 6 year old. Very thin and silky material.  I dont know how well it will stay up. We will see
2.0,The jewels fell out of the earrings and we're poor quality.
2.0,"I generally wear a small. I ordered a medium since most say the fit is smaller. A medium was a little too small in the top and extremely small in the bottom. Did not seem high waisted at all. The top is not nearly as long as the picture, more of a bandeau look. It is definitely not as cute as the photo. The material and stitching had a cheap look and feel, but I was expecting that for the price. I just wanted something for my backyard pool."
2.0,Low quality. Turned my ankle green.
2.0,"The hasp broke almost instantly, after only wearing for 2 hours. Since I discarded the packaging, I couldn't return it."
2.0,Material seems ok but way too small.  Size is about an 8 in us sizes.
2.0,So much larger than I expected.  Not for me.
2.0,I like the watch but I had problems wearing it because I could not fasten the bracelet.
2.0,I do not like the feel of the material. It’s a weird shiny/silky type material. I was expecting something cotton. They do fit pretty big. I got a small and they were quite large on me. They are ridiculously long.
2.0,The dress is “not” made with denim  as shown on the model... It is made of the material posted of the dress by itself!!
2.0,More cream then white. Houndstooth pattern was off. Returned the item.
2.0,They are nice but the stick was a bit thick and made my nose piercing bleed
2.0,"Received my necklace already tarnished. It’s heavy and has a decent chain, but the tail is tarnished."
2.0,"Too lightweight, can blow a candle out through these thin masks."
2.0,"El pantalón no era de mi talla. Tomé las medidas correctamente y las comparé con la tabla que el vendedor publicó, por lo que todo parecía estar bien. hoy cuando me probé el pantalón me quedó demasiado grande."
2.0,The dress arrived quickly but was to big. I ordered according to measurements and it was way to long and loose.
2.0,"These would be excellent and sturdy except there was no way for me to attach these to my luggage. I will have to find something I can attach with. The holes are too small to use a zip tie so I will need or order something else. Love the tag, but because I am not able to attach it to my bag I would recommend purchasing something else."
2.0,Get a size bigger than you are and the pants don’t stay up. The pants don’t have belt loops. Jacket works great but it didn’t have an access to turn it on so I cut a slit in the liner.
2.0,"Took this out of the package and the buttons were sewn crooked all down the dress, looked ridiculous. Ordered it in a medium. Size was fine but a little more fitted in the skirt than I thought it’d be. Bummer had to return. Just really cheaply made."
2.0,Stretches out way to fast. Have had it 5 days and already retightened it three tiems
2.0,They  don't  stay on my nose.  Keep  falling off.
2.0,Adjustable clasp hits me right in the middle of my back. Way to big.
2.0,Absolutely no support and I feel like I'll fall out of it if I don't pin it securely. Also the edges of the fabric rolls up a bit and gives an unfinished look.
2.0,Nice look good material. Very small and came dirty. Had to return.
2.0,Super cheap and uncomfortable. I bought it as a gift and was embarrassed to give it to her. Looks like a Dollar Store item.
2.0,"Such a cute bathing suit but it's built for a very specific body type that most women don't have. I'm 5'1, I usually wear a size 8 or 10 pants, I have a medium sized waist, but very large breasts. I was feeling a little heavy this summer so I opted out of a bikini but still wanted to show off my belly ring so I bought this bathing suit in green because I thought I'd look amazing. Boy was I wrong!! I ordered the xxxl so that I could fit it to my boobs and have it taken in where needed. This bust area was made to fit a C cup at the absolute largest. I tried to remove the built in cups and underwire so it would fit better, but to no luck. The torso is very very long so it hung a little below where it should have. The waist fit ok but the butt and crotch area where saggy and tight at the same time. (how does that even happen?) I bought a lime green bralet to wear underneath so that I could try to wear it like it's supposed to fit in the picture without showing off a ton of underboob, but it still just looked funny. Thank goodness it was so cheap because it was an absolute waste of money."
2.0,the ends do not hold the glasses and let the arms of the glasses constantly slip out.  Used a few of them; the rest are still in the packet in my draw.
2.0,The only good thing I can say about this rosary is the stone beads are very beautiful. Its put together with a cheap plastic cord. the cross looks like chromed tin. I used it for parts to make a friend her first rosary
2.0,The plastic is so cheap. You can’t see clearly over it because all the crease
2.0,This large is tiny.
2.0,Sleeves are too short
2.0,"Soooo if you have a butt or hips, and want comfy lounge sweats, 2 sizes up. Yikes. Bought a medium that won't go past my butt. I'm usually a medium. I won't be reordering. Maybe buy men's?"
2.0,"These run a good inch smaller in the waist than the Camber 105 and Camber 107, which I have 4 pairs total of. Just something to be aware of. I can see the cell phone pocket getting annoying since you have to zip and unzip it every time you get your phone out. I prefer the phone pocket on the 105 and 107. Nice color though."
2.0,"Ordered 2 sets, they didn't come separately packaged together. All different sizes. Only 1 pair of 5 fit my feet. They are definitely NOT nonslip. The other &#34;set&#34; were gifts for my sister. She has smaller feet, size 7 vs my size 8...I haven't heard if they fit."
2.0,"I like the leotard, but it runs a bit large. I ordered a 7-8 yr size which is normal for my daughter but was surprised that it is big for her. Giving 2 stars as sizing need to be more standard"
2.0,Not as nice as other third-party bands I've tried.
2.0,This was ridiculously small. I am 5'8 and normally wear a size 2. There was no way I could even make this wrap around my body to close. I gave it to my 13-year-old daughter.
2.0,My boyfriend wore them a few weeks off and on and they ripped !
2.0,I ordered a medium and a small and they fit exactly the same.. The arms are HUGE as if they have been stretched out. Also the shirts don't come with tag to show size only a sticker on bag.
2.0,Eh for the price it’s really not much better than all the other bags I compared it to. Very very bulky but if you like that than this bag is for you. This bag got returned and I stuck with a samsonite bag.
2.0,I ordered it for my wife but the entire set is extremely too small for her and it's still within the plastic.
2.0,The chest area is too small and the bottom is too big for my size
2.0,The Men’s Large gloves I ordered will not fit onto my average size hands. I cannot squeeze my hands into the gloves. I double checked to make sure I didn’t order women’s gloves. Obviously these gloves are made for much smaller people than typical American men. I’d order 2 sizes larger if you can.
2.0,"I was pretty excited for these for Christmas.  Sadly, I do not like these at all.  First off, I would order up.  These run very small and run low in the back area.  I wear a 2x in all of my leggings, and I could not get these on.  If you do have any stretch in the fabric, it turns white and you can see through it.  So, even if you can get them to fit but they are stretched, you will not want to wear them.  I personally do not want my leggings loose and would not wear them for just the design."
2.0,Super thin cheap material
2.0,I ordered this for my wife. It was horrible. As soon as it arrived she tried it on. She loves the feel and pattern of it. However it began to quickly unravel. We had threads coming out everywhere.
2.0,"The color and material were nice, zipper operated fine, and the belt seemed to be of good quality.  I am 5'4&#34;, 130 lbs, c cup.  I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly.<br />I will be returning this dress however due to odd curves at the hips about 3 inches under where my hips actually belong.  It caused weird little handles on the dress,  like parachute pants.  This isn't shown in the picture or in the description."
2.0,The bow on the shorts was sewn crookedly and in a random spot....there was a shoe string type of ribbon I assume for the headband which doesn't match the set at all.
2.0,"I wouldn't consider buying these unless you have a size 5 foot, I wear a 10 and they don't work for me.<br />Apparently made in China, The packaging has Chinese lettering."
2.0,"Shorts shrank considerably, washed cold gentle cycle and dried low heat"
2.0,Well this cangaroo jacket only has an opening for baby take his head out nothing to carry baby. Color is very odd gray was kind of purple. So be prapered to have a baby carrier this only fits poupouse to have baby close to you
2.0,This hat did not fit me well at all. The forehead section was too tall. I must have a shorter forehead than this was meant for.
2.0,The clip is too sharp.
2.0,I didn't realize how big this was. I think this would be better for a man. I wanted something a little smaller.
2.0,The quality looks good but they are way to big for woman. It will be nice if they have a smaller version.
2.0,I couldn’t wear it. My wrist broke out in a rash. Glad it was cheap.
2.0,Bought this case before anyone had reviewed it.  After receiving it I noticed that it did not protect camera lens.  I didn't want to have to get a camera protector.  It is much lighter than I expected.  I need a case that I know will protect my phone since I have a habit of dropping it often.
2.0,"The sleeves were small, the midsection was super big and the quality of the material was horrible! After a wear of about 5 hours, the fabric on the insides of my sleeves had worn thin and began to rip"
2.0,This was my second time offering these and I just received the second pack of them and they are cheaply made and not at all what I purchased the first time. These are pure crap this time. I will be sending them back for a full refund. Highly Disappointed!!!!!!
2.0,This is a very cute product. But I need it for riding on a motorcycle. The edges are not sewn together. When I tried it on the fabric started ripping. Definitely not what I expected.
2.0,Design looks like it was blown up too big and is kinda blurry as a result. Bag feels flimsy like the zippers aren't going to last very long. It's also kinda small. I bought this to hold binders for school and it absolutely can't handle that job.
2.0,"The quality is ok. Thought it would be softer, but it's kinda hard leather. But the bottom of the shoes is very soft! I bought for 12-18 months cause my son is 11 months, it's like a third bigger than my son's feet. He's a big boy too!"
2.0,ZIPPER BROKE AFTER 2 WKS ZIPPER REAL DRY NEEDED SOME OIL
2.0,"It didn't work. The watch didn't work from the beginning. I contacted the supplier who was very difficult to get in touch with. Needless to say, we still have the broken watch."
2.0,This outfit is very pretty but runs really small
2.0,I bought 2 sizes up and it still doesn't fit
2.0,I love the vest but the one size fit all is a joke. They need to redesign the size or make bigger. I am a 225 guy and this fits snug
2.0,Way too small! Ordered a 12month and came as a 3-6 month size. Way too small!
2.0,The color is not as bright as it looks
2.0,Sorry - I don't like this bracelet.  It slides open and drops off the wrist.  I didn't even notice the first time - just found it on the floor of my office.  The other bracelets are more secure
2.0,Very thick and hard to breath really big on my face.
2.0,Straps attach in the back too far out so the straps don’t stay up while wearing.
2.0,"I have placed 3 orders for these tights. The first set of came with one pair fine and the other pair lacking a hole in the bottom. The second set was great. My daughter was in a performance, so I bought another set to have bright white tights for the performance. She wore each pair for the performance and only once after. Both pairs tore the first time she wore them to dance class."
2.0,Fits very tight. I ordered a Large and it fits like a small. Cute dress if it were true to size.
2.0,"No me gustó, debido a que no protege bien la parte trasera de la cabeza, pues tiene una abertura.  Si es una persona que tiene el cabello largo y se hace una cola, le funciona, pues la abertura le sirve para sacar el cabello.  Pero si tienes el pelo corto o eres calvo, el sol te golpeará fuerte en la parte trasera.  Deberían poner fotos donde se ve la parte trasera, para que las personas puedan comprar mejor informadas."
2.0,"Pretty design, but cheap plastic that broke the first day, plus they were kind of a tight fit."
2.0,I thought that they would cover the full forarm that's why I bought them they didn't even go close to my elbows. They were tight and uncomfortable. I returned them.
2.0,These earrings are definitely not worth buying. They are cute but they tarnish very quickly and turned my daughter's ears green. Definitely fake jewelry but they are cute.
2.0,"One of the  buckles comes loose and falls off the strap (the side that should never come off). The other 2 are fine, but the end of the belt strap comes off after a month or so of pulling it back through belt loops because it gets stuck. Not the best for work belts. You get what you pay for."
2.0,The cut and sizing are good but the material is very strange and it stuck to my nightgown which made it difficult to put on and take off.
2.0,poor quality.  Fell apart after wearing it a couple of times.
2.0,Sizing is not accurate they run smaller.
2.0,I love the item its just to short
2.0,The design was cool but it fit really weird. The collar was really low and the shirt didnt fit like you would expect. I think $20 for this is very overpriced this is more like a $4 shirt... Huge let down!
2.0,The color I selected with a mainly blue color came with mostly bright orange the color and design is not exactly as pictured. I’m sad
2.0,"They are really nice, vibrant colors. They do not stay in place for exercise- I do have a particularly small head and perhaps that’s why they aren’t working well for me."
2.0,"This dress would be cute except it is poorly made. The ruffle that hangs over your arms is one layer of fabric, so the front is the main pattern, but the back is white. This would be fine if you never moved your arms, but it looks really tacky being able to see the back of the fabric.<br />The ruffle also hangs awkwardly. I think the romper would be better without it.<br />I don't recommend this product and will be returning it."
2.0,Super cheaply made. Not baggy even when I sized up. The straps on the chest had lots of threads loose and it looked messy.
2.0,"I have big boobs (like 36G I measured yesterday) and I ordered an extra large. The top was too big and the bottom was too small. Absolutely no stretch I could hardly get it zipped up, not lined, and a little too short (I’m 5’8). I wanted to love this so much but there’s no way to make it work for me unfortunately."
2.0,The 'stones' are not genuine turquoise; they're not even good quality fake turquoise.
2.0,"When I tried to return it, the post office rejected it. There is no street or number on the return label, only.<br />Guangzhou locust Trade Co., Ltd<br />Louisville, KY<br />Louisville, KY 40258.<br />I tried googling the address and couldn’t find it.<br />I understood that this would look like complete tartan. It is more of an implied line partial image of a tartan. It does not look like my family’s tartan. Right colors. Cheaply made. Disappointing. The fabric feels lovely and the size is nice."
2.0,"Not a fan of these belay glasses, it looks like the glass is not properly aligned. when wearing it you cant see, because you see double. Don't recommend them"
2.0,"Disappointed! I was so looking forward to receive this dress. I'm a size large, but ordered the largest size available (XL) but it was still too small. The XL is more like a Medium."
2.0,You can see everything!
2.0,This sucker is huge!
2.0,Looking pretty fit great but turned finger green in a week
2.0,"Actually thought it was going to be a legit tiny bottle that you could fill with some perfume.  It's not, it's just a little pendant that just looks like a perfume bottle."
2.0,"I like the design of the masks and they are comfortable. But they seem thin and I couldn't find any mention of how many layers they have. We should only buy masks with 3 layers now. If you really want these masks to protect you from COVID, you probably should wear 2 or even 3 of them at a time. You can also put coffee filters inside to add more layers."
2.0,Nice quality BUT  the XXL fits like a LG ! Too bad!
2.0,"Got this blouse for a gift and didn't come with tags, it looked like it wasn't new."
2.0,"The costume is super cute and it came amazingly fast. That's the good. The bad is that it is an outfit that has to be put on through the neck hole. This does not open wide enough unless your hips are super small. Mine are not. It wouldn't even go past my thighs. This is not a true extra large. It would fit otherwise, but again, there is no other way to put the outfit on. I am seriously disappointed with this item."
2.0,Yo la compré en talla M pero no me quedó me quedo pequeña y ajustada para mí peso y estatura tendría que ser XL para está camisa y yo normal mente soy M
2.0,"Seller was great.  good communication and quick delivery.<br />Unfortunately, the bezel bent very easily and did not fit the coin that I had that is the size of a quarter.  Very disappointed.  It appears very flimsy."
2.0,After wearing these less than 10 times the stirrup connecting to the leather broke.
2.0,Very cheap quality for what I paid.
2.0,"After a few days of use, the wheels are not rolling well. It's hard to move the case."
2.0,It runs 2 sizes small
2.0,"The pearls are so tiny, it looks like a kid necklace. i expected them to be the size of the the pearls in<br />TOUS Mini Bear Freshwater Cultured Pearl Strand bracelet bracelet, so disappointed!!!"
2.0,Broke within three days. Would not buy again.
2.0,"I bought these for my mom. They do look cute, but they cut into her head and are way too tight. She still wears them when she is desperate, but normally chooses another pair that are more comfortable. That being said, I do have a different style of sunglasses from this same company and I LOVE them! They are much more comfortable than these."
2.0,"This was a really cute swim suit, but I have to return it because the top was just too large.  I'm a 36D and even though I tied it as tight as I could, it was still loose and unfortunately didn't give me nearly enough support.  I didn't see many other reviews saying the same, so it's possible the one I got was just a fluke.  I wish it had worked out because otherwise it was comfortable and quite pretty."
2.0,"This seller used to have the bra that had an extra wide band across the bottom and 6-straps across the back. I LOOOOVE those. For a 40D and fluffy woman those 2XL rocked. This particular style… no. Just no. Everything was wrong about it. All it did was curl/ride up. I was constantly adjusting myself while grocery shopping. I was miserable. All my fluff was hanging out over the sides, front, and all in between. Maybe they fit better for the smaller sized crowd but not this woman."
2.0,Doesn't fit well
2.0,The print is cute. But I ordered a size up and it was still a size-size and a half too small. I will not repurchase as I do not like the stiff material.
2.0,"Easy for the kids to wear, but to thin to be useful for the purpose of germs getting through"
2.0,Too long and fits weird.
2.0,"I loved these earrings when I first got them! They're perfect, not too heavy....however, they only lasted a few months before the clasp broke on one of them!! Should be much better than that...in the trash they went. Sorry!!"
2.0,Cheap material and small! I even ordered a few sizes up!!
2.0,Too small but color is nice
2.0,Fit really well but they ripped after my daughter had them on for 30 minutes. Will not buy again
2.0,It broke while trying to attach keys to the hook.
2.0,sleeves too short and the whole jacket is very skimpy
2.0,Very thin and poor quality. Don't order this
2.0,Disappointed - wanted to love it - but it just fits funky - sadly returning :(
2.0,"I’m always cold and always looking for nice warm sweaters. This sweater is thin you can look right through it. The material was very weird, stiff or rough material! Not soft cozy like most sweaters. But if you just want a sweater looking one, not caring on softness.... it’s ok."
2.0,"It's too thin, shows everything. sorry"
2.0,"My experiences with previous compression socks were not satisfactory. But, I thought I would give these Copper Fit easy on / easy off socks a try. (I even ordered a larger size than the chart recommended.)<br />Well, I found these ""easy on"" socks are just as much of a challenge to get on, as previous compression socks.<br />My guess is the Copper Fit marketing rhetoric (propaganda) will convince many others to purchase & try these."
2.0,"I like the fit &amp; look of the sandals, however, I've been wearing them for less that a month &amp; the back strap is already breaking."
2.0,"After 4 months the plastic cracked. Took good care of them, but alas cheap things do what cheap things do."
2.0,It doesn't fit as expected and it's way too long. Basketball player long. It's going to cost more to get it hemmed.
2.0,"I normally wear an L/XL.  I bought an XXL thinking washing would shrink.  They are too small.  If you are a size 14, buy a 3j-4X"
2.0,Dress is more on the Blue side of Green than and a true Green.  I was hoping it would be Green like the photo and the description
2.0,Very small it was chipped on one side.
2.0,I washed it in cold water and did not put it in the dryer. It is now kids size.
2.0,"Way to short, i got the long sleeve one in the sane size and it was fine"
2.0,"I purchased this necklace because I wanted a long one but the one I received is shorter in length than what was described. It is also different than the picture. The pendants are placed opposite on the chains. Also, the metal had damage in some areas."
2.0,Very nice piece. I’m 5’2 150lbs (athletic build) and it fit just right. However this gets 2 stars because it came with a hole on the side of the dress. Looks like the string and stitching came apart.
2.0,"Too much compression for me.  Otherwise good quality, love the honey ginger shade"
2.0,If  you like  your pants to fit  like  pants  worn in 1900s  brittain  with a hoop  skirt  around  your  waist  and  an adult diaper  in your  critch go for it  you'll love  these.
2.0,"Fits as described, but really poor quality.<br />I would not recommend!"
2.0,Bought this bracelet twice. The first one came with an imperfection on an end link and the second one does not fit my Casio MDV-106 as advertised. I'll be returning the product and getting a different bracelet for it.
2.0,Rips easily.
2.0,"This dress was so pretty in the ad picture when I ordered it and I was really excited when it came today. I tried it on right away and what a disappointment. I am 5’11”/250lbs and wear a big 2x so I ordered a 3x just to be on the safe side. This was definitely not a 3x, a very very small 3x. It squished & pressed my boobs down so tight and the liner of the dress was so tight it seriously felt like I had a corset on. It was so tight and uncomfortable, hard to move and breathe right. The liner was way shorter than the lace making it look funny. A lot of my weight is in my belly and the way it hangs really made my belly stand out. Then the lace trim around the V of the chest is completely sewn on crooked, it looks awful! (See photo) The material is nice and the dress has potential but wow, it is just really poorly made and unfortunately I do not recommend it. If you do go with it, make sure you order up on the size."
2.0,"I bought these since I have a couple of piercings going down my earlobe, and they're the perfect size. But they're a little on the thicker side, they changed colors (got a darker color) after less than 2 weeks of wearing them, causing my ear to get irritated and itchy. I had to remove them and throw them away. I ordered 4 and the clip was damaged and couldn't use it :("
2.0,"I really loved the bracelets, unfortunately they dont last long"
2.0,Sizing is always hard on the internet. Inches must be different in different situation. It is disappointing
2.0,"The socks are fine, but the dog on them is not a Keeshond."
2.0,The skirt is cute on it’s own but im missing the red chain. I bought it for a specific outfit for a music festival so it was very disappointing.
2.0,"This doesn’t look at all like the image, it’s cut small. The color isn’t vivid like the image, in fact it looks<br />Completely different than the picture. The sleeves aren’t big, loose or flowing and the dress is definitely<br />not cut like this was represented."
2.0,"Cheap material, hard and it does not have a flow."
2.0,I love the band...once it's on my wrist. But the clasp is so difficult to put on it makes it almost worthless. I'll be looking for another paracord band that's more practical for daily wear.
2.0,"I did not like the color of this purse in person, plus was just a tad too big."
2.0,very tiny bands-
2.0,"These are SO close to being a great bargain find. For non-prescription frames, these are pretty sturdy with a flex hinge that has stood up to lots of wear, on & off & folding. The shape, yellow color & size of these frames are accurate as in the pictures & would even be trendy/stylish EXCEPT the reading area part of the lens is noticeable and looks dowdy, like cheap bifocals. I guess that’s what they are? Lol. I’ve received compliments on them until someone sees them front-on and agrees with me about the obvious bifocal area/line (“What a shame….”)<br /><br />Also, the lenses do NOT darken as the pictures indicate but stay clear. I wanted something that would darken like sunglasses and have purchased other models like this 1 below that do darken in the sun, although they too have the ugly reader zone although without an obvious line.<br />LifeArt Bifocal Reading Glasses,... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BWQXYPB?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share"
2.0,Runs very small - I returned it.
2.0,I went up a size to make sure it would fit and it wouldnt even go over my shoulders. Wouldve had to go up 3 or 4 sizes from my normal.
2.0,Cute but broke within 5 minutes. There’s extra pieces on the side that don’t beong
2.0,Fabric very  cheap feeling lucky I only bought it for Halloween wouldn't wear it to a to a normal suited setting
2.0,Child wrist size. Size of a hair tie
2.0,"Not too happy with this suit, but guess it partially helps to read what it says (no lining).  And some of this stitching is coming loose after only a couple of wearings."
2.0,The skirt is way bigger than it looks. It does close to down to your knees and has way too much material.
2.0,Overall the watch looks decent for its price BUT I was looking specifically for an ORANGE watch to match a uniform. The band is not orange at all (as the picture and description claim) it is brown. Now I have to buy another band to replace it and I am very dissatisfied. What a waste of money.
2.0,cheap looking and it does not sit on hip its not long enough
2.0,"It’s not white, more like cream/yellowish"
2.0,"Blouse is not as pictured. There are 3 elastic bands in each sleeve, not one at the wrist as pictured."
2.0,Brand new snd it says….  “Let the moon lase your mind”?????  I believe it’s supposed to be “ease your mind”.<br /><br />Got it for my daughter.  Disappointed that such an obvious error was missed.
2.0,its very short.
2.0,"While the sandals are waterproof, they have very little padding or cushion so they are not good to do any real walking in.  Your feet will start to ache very quickly."
2.0,"The product seems nice, but way small. I usually wear a small-medium in shorts, and ordered a large. I got sent a medium which was too small. I tried two more times, got two more mediums. One showed up in a size large bag... Have to return them all."
2.0,I gave it to Salvation Army.
2.0,"Watch wasn’t as nice as the picture, light not as bright as it indicated and it’s hard to program."
2.0,"I did NOT care for this top. It's made of a waffle weave fabric that is very stiff and uncomfortable. The sizing runs small and the ends (the neck area, the ends of the sleeves and the bottom of the shirt) get stretched out really easily, making for an unflattering look. Overall, I do not recommend this top. You can find much cuter tops in much more comfortable fabrics elsewhere on Amazon."
2.0,"Pros:<br />Incredibly thin<br />Fit most of the stuff I needed to carry (~5ish bills, around 5 cards)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cheaply constructed, feels like a toy.<br />Falling apart after only half a year.<br /><br />The wallet served its purpose pretty well while it lasted. Unfortunately, the quality is pretty low and it's already starting to fall apart. The wallet feels cheaply made and overpriced."
2.0,The sweater is comfortable and washes up nicely without twisting. BUT it’s not at allll as long (like a tunic) as it shows in the photo.
2.0,"Not pleased with this item, poor quality. Also I was give 2 dresses, however only requested one."
2.0,"The vendor was great, shipped it out to us asap! We would use the vendor again... but the ring was not quite what we thought it was as it was alot lighter in weight than we expected so we returned it. But that was not the vendors fault."
2.0,"So I ordered these sweet black vintage wayferers with sweet blue lenses.  So, in about two weeks I finally got them!!  BLUE FREAKING GLASSES WITH BLACK LENSES.  Ugh... They are really crappy quality too"
2.0,"Careful with this one.....I'm 5'8, 34B, 30 waist and 40 hips and ordered the Green one in small and it fit perfect. I loved it so much I ordered the Black Floral and Multicolored in small....what a disaster!<br /><br />The Black Floral dress was too big and too long.......and that was a small! I was pretty shocked because I thought the fit would be exactly the same since it's the same company.<br /><br />Then the multicolored one was flawed all the way around. It had a weird chemical smell. The neckline didn't even cover my chest.....it was plunging down in the waist area even though the fit was fine. Also, the belt was in the wrong place. The belt on the multicolored one is attached to the dress unlike the Green and Black Floral, yet it was too high up and attached near the underarm. It was weird.<br /><br />I asked for a refund which also proved to be a disaster. The Green dress, which fit fine was Amazon Prime eligible, however, I didn't realize many of the other prints weren't. They were shipped from China. So because of this, the seller told me I'd have to pay for shipping or I could opt to keep the dresses and they'd refund me $14.00. I went ahead and took the $14.00 refund since it would cost that much more to send the dresses back.<br /><br />This is definitely a hit or miss dress. When it's a hit, it's gorgeous and the material is very nice. When it's a miss, it's a HUGE miss. You can't even make it work...forget trying to have it tailored if it won't even fit over your chest. I understand it's low cut to begin with but when you can't even get it above your waist line, yet the fit is fine, you know that's a problem!"
2.0,"I think the cut of this has been changed since most of the reviews were written.<br />First, there is a seam down the front which is not in the pictures.<br />Second, there is much less fabric than the product photo, or other reviews.<br />I am 5'6&#34;, about 125lbs., 34b. and this is what I got...<br />The length is way shorter, not really any side drape, and there is no drape in the legs at all. Just weird, straight, petal-like flaps that curve inwards.<br />I knew from other reviewers about the fabric, and I actually liked that it was light weight, stretchy, and wrinkle free.<br />Back on the hunt..."
2.0,Cute! Just wish they fit! I can get by for a short trip but a full size too small and straps are big. Stretched out quickly.
2.0,"I wanted to love this suit so much. The quality is fantastic, very sturdy, not flimsy or thin, the top was structured, the hooks were metal, and the breast area was padded/formed. Why only 2 stars? This was not made for someone any taller than 5'4&#34;at most. I am 5'7&#34;, ordered the US 12/14 and it was 3+ inches short in the torso, compressing my breasts and going so far up my butt it might as well have been a thong, and when I pulled it up to cover my chest, it would expose my underbreast. There was no adjustment that would work and every time I tried one of the straps would fly off.  I'm 5'7, 190ish, 33&#34; waist 44&#34; hips, I don't have a completely flat stomach, but pretty close, in fact the netting rested above my skin and there was a gap between my skin and the suit caused by my breasts and the lack of length. This might work for someone short with no chest, otherwise, skip it."
2.0,"Two stars because the fabric actually is good and soft. Otherwise the fit is terrible, and very inconsistent - two fit okay ish and two the legs were extremely tight and uncomfortable."
2.0,"The material is nice, but they're much shorter than shown."
2.0,Cute dress if it fit right. Fit everywhere but my chest. I'm 5'9&#34; and it was long enough for me. Past my ankles like I wanted. Wanted to love this dress so bad! But the top was just to weird.
2.0,The dress didn't have an even bottom. The left side was longer than the right. The material and print were her nice though.
2.0,Jacket was way to small. But very nice other wise. Had no one to even give it to
2.0,Cute shirt but NOT for busty girls! The cross-over part of the top just doesn’t work.
2.0,Was way too big for my 12 year old daughter.  Had to use a rubber band around it to keep it on.
2.0,Shirt was comfy and soft.  But way too large and pretty baggy.  Armholes are huge!
2.0,"This dress is pretty cute, but completely transparent, which means you can’t really wear it anywhere. I’d still use it as a beach coverup, except for one issue: there’s no room for boobs. None. If your chest size is larger than 36 around, or if you’re under 36 around but bigger than a B, it’s simply not going to work."
2.0,"Fit as expected but there's a reason these are cheaply priced, they start falling apart after a couple of washes and you'll start pulling threads off like crazy."
2.0,"I do not like that the fabric is like the dry fit fabric.  It is ok, but not my favorite."
2.0,Not as good as my kids other goggles. They don't stay on great and water leaks in constantly.
2.0,Not sturdy and durable.  Disappointed. I gave it two stars since the colors were nice.
2.0,"Measurements are a little off from the size chart.  The quality of the material material is poor for what the price of the sweatshirt is.  Loved the pattern idea, but material needs improvement."
2.0,This did not fit at all.
2.0,"While the engineering/ design is good, the hat is small and the adjustment limited. My head isn't that big and it couldn't fit. Also, you usually need a quality hat to have a comfortable and not biting rim upon the forehead. This hat is not that level. But, it's inexpensive so not a surprise.  I tossed the hat but kept the ear shade portion to use with one of my other hats. Also if you want the face mask to keep pollen out of your mouth and nose while you weed eat or mow, this isn't it; it's a mesh so you can breath easy but that let's in the stuff that gives you the runny nose or rough throat. Small head with a bandana while fishing, it's a good deal."
2.0,"These are definitely more like briefs than boys shorts. The picture is deceiving. If you're looking for something that comes down the leg a little more, don't get these."
2.0,purchased same as the size i buy in America but it did not fit that way when it arrived. I could not use them and gave them to a female friend who is smaller and was able to use them.
2.0,"Way to small<br />Run extremely small  . Got for daughter  bought bought 2sizes up cuz always know it always know it runs small  an they were still way to small .  They  fit a small tho says xlg . I even checked their size chart  said they would  fit her actually  would  be a lil big but she's still growing  so I thought  who cares.  So chart way off is all I can say . They run several  times  smaller .must be lil  children  sizes ....smh. very disappointed , won't  purchase again . Gave 2 stars because material was awesome."
2.0,The stones are plastic and cheap looking and the chain is so short that it couldn't stay closed as the clover.  I thought about finding a better chain but it wasn't even worth it so I just threw it in the trash.
2.0,Very small for small calves. Not recommended for plus size. They are more like ankle warmers for my plus size calves.
2.0,It is a nice band though the picture is somewhat deceiving. More for a man or larger woman even with the adjustable band it not good for someone with a smaller wrist. I would like to point out that the quality is really nice for those of you who are looking for a larger band I would rate it 4 stars. It just didn't work for me.  Kudos to Amazon Customer Service resolving this issue.
2.0,Pro: Great colors and soft. Tagless is a plus for my toddler.<br />Con: One of the shirts we received had a micro-hole in it. Not sure how well the shirts will hold up after wearing & washing. I am sending back for a replacement.
2.0,"Cute style. However, they run small & you can see right through them if I bend over."
2.0,Good design for regular sweat pants. The legs don't come in enough to be considered joggers but aside from that major detail. The pants are comfortable as regular sweat pants with a draw string. Would not call these joggers but the graphics are cool.
2.0,"This sleeping cap is so small. I have a short bob and it doesn't even hold my hair in. If they made it bigger, it would be great."
2.0,"Great Bracelet, But the clasp broke first time we put it on. We didn't bother returning because of the cost. Just replaced with a new clasp and it looks great."
2.0,I bought this to wear while riding my motorcycle this will not work without a helmet on it fits very loose would blow right off. I tried to use while doing yard work and it kept sliding off to the top of my head I would say if your going to use at the beach of just lounging around outside this would work I would not buy again
2.0,Heavy. Rough. The picture looks better than in the living.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this, because it’s so much less expensive than 99% of the other options out there, but there are a few things about it that make it very difficult to utilize. First, like another reviewer stated, you cannot put as much water in as you think would be appropriate, because once they freeze, they won’t fit...<br />second, the sewn sections for the ice packs aren’t all the same size, simply because of poor sewing quality standards. So, even with the ice packs that I filled with a smaller amount of water, some don’t fit in because they were too wide.<br />Third, I am a small framed person (5’7” and 115lbs), and having this on and all the way cinched, it was still much larger than my body, so it worked best when I was sitting in a chair (the chair pushed it against my back and my arms were able to hold the front of the vest against my chest/stomach).<br />Those things being said, the 6-7 spots I was able to utilize out of the 12 available, kept me cooler than I otherwise would have been, and for that I was very grateful.<br />If you fill the ice packs with fairly minimal water, and don’t set your expectations very high, maybe it will work for you, but if you have the thought that it’ll be as good as some of the ice vests that are $150-200, you’ll be disappointed."
2.0,It's kind of cheaply made. The collar looks like a shiny plastic thing much darker than in the picture.. the cut is pretty bad. Bulky in the front so it doesn't quite lay right. It is cut short I'm a short guy so it wasn't a problem for me. And it's kind of stiff there'd be a long break in period. The material they used for the main part is solid and the lining is cool. But the cut was just kind of funky.
2.0,I like the color and the fabric is ok but it did not fit quite right on me. The top portion is so long. I am slightly under 5ft and 95lbs.
2.0,"Was quite disappointed when I received this cardigan as I thought it was going to be a sweater.  The material is like tee-shirt type material, not normal sweater type material.  The navy color was a lighter blue then navy.  If that is the feel of a cardigan you like, than it is for you.  The fit is great though.  I will probably wear this if I go to the movies, but not if I was going out and needed a sweater."
2.0,the material is weird and not like typical tights
2.0,This thing is huge. Made me look like a linebacker. I ordered a small.
2.0,Slightly tarnished when I received them. Also turned my ears green after wearing for two days.
2.0,"Beautiful ring, but turns your finger green."
2.0,"Unfortunately as soon i got it out from package it's already broke,the middle jewel is not glued enough i ges and since I really need it and i have no time to return it so i keep it and glue it for myself"
2.0,anything from china fits small oh well gave to my daughter
2.0,"Tiny and light... nothing special, in my opinion.  Was expecting more.  Necklace comes in a small plastic bag.  You need to take it out of the bag and place in the universal jewelry box (use the slits in the top corners to hold the chain). I plan to return one of the three... ran out of time to replace the other 2 before graduation.  This might be cute-ish for a young woman and a great concept, but not a substantial gift... and doesn't look like its price tag.  :("
2.0,Used it twice and the seam separated just underneath the hangar.  I liked the bag but it was not sturdy enough
2.0,I bought these socks because I'm a Hunter I want to keep my feet nice and warm and dry the elastic in these socks goes the first day you wear them they're they're that cheap disappointing they're soft and warm they don't stay pulled up the elastic is gone I didn't even wear them a full 24 hours no literally falling apart sorry don't mind
2.0,very cheap but look even cheaper...
2.0,"Very thin, and parts of the seem already had holes."
2.0,"I had great intentions buying these shoes. Not sure I will buy another pair of shoes that don't have laces for my toddler. She takes them off very easily and they are not the easiest shoes to get on her tiny feet. Getting a toddler dressed is hard enough as it is. They are SUPER soft and supple shoes and seemed great for new walkers. I got these for less than $20 here, which is a great deal on these shoes, but I would be PO'ed if I bought them for more than since she is rarely wearing them."
2.0,Llegó roto por el lado izquierdo . Es hermoso pero está roto . No estoy satisfecha .
2.0,Was hoping it was beige not white
2.0,"Wore it one day and it broke... great price, but I guess you get what you pay for.  It's very cute on!"
2.0,"They run a bit small, but fit ok once you break them in. After 2 months the bottom of the shoe broke away.  i won't say they weren't used, but they weren't abused.  This just shouldn't happen this early.  I'm very disappointed.  I wouldn't recommend.  My daughter is going back to Adidas."
2.0,They were supposed to come Saturday. I didn't get them until Tuesday. They are alot smaller than advertised. They are perfect for my 6 year old daughter though.... Not really for adults..but they are super cute for children.
2.0,Thinner plastic than it looks. Definitely looks stronger and shinier than it is.
2.0,Lightweight but difficult to open. Bottom fell off after 5 uses
2.0,Material is see through.  Will not wear.
2.0,"Smaller than I expected, and the fabric isn't that great. But they were pretty decorative pieces"
2.0,"Ordered a 0-6 month was sent a 5. The hood is not a rabbit ear, resembles cat. Buttons bulge funny. This was a gift and I am sad i was sent the wrong size and item was not as described. Fuzzy and pink, not bunny, not size 0-6 month. Sad."
2.0,This wasn’t what I expected I wanted . I thought the material was thicker softer and not so see through.  These are great for a shell underneath your clothes but not as something to wear regularly. I’m a fan of under armour cold gear and wanted something similar. This definitely doesn’t cut it and I’m afraid to wash these because they may fall apart
2.0,"I wan't impressed with these. The elastic in the wrist was very stiff and scratched my hand when I took them off, I had to remove it.  They aren't very warm, the wind blows  right through them."
2.0,unfortunately I used this bag for a week and then both zippers on the outside stopped closing. They would zip and then the zipper would open in the middle so now the zippers our useless. It's unusable now.
2.0,"Initial impression was good as I liked the feel of the compression and the roomy toe box.  However, the top band is not as wide as shown in the photo and much too tight for comfort. In a last ditch effort to save the socks so I could wear them, I removed stitching at top hem. I knew this was a gamble and was not surprised that it did not help.  I also have the Allrounder Compression socks.  They are sitting in a drawer."
2.0,Cute socks but to tight especially after washing. Great for an kid but not for an adult.
2.0,The sewing lines are very weird. I worn it when was 7 months pregnant and it wasn't too terrible but definetely cheaply made.
2.0,I’ve purchased these gloves twice. The first time they had a rip on the outside. The second time they had a rip in the interior lining. I would suggest not wasting your money on these.
2.0,Haven’t had for 3 months and color started to rub off. Only gave 2 stars because my watch did stay on my wrist.
2.0,Every bra is in different size none of them is comfortable
2.0,i wore the first pair one time and before my day ended there was a huge hole in the thigh. I don't know if I will even open the second one. I have another pair in this brand without issue.
2.0,I’m going to send this back it fits and looks like the picture. Just is a lot cheaper made and looking than I expected.
2.0,Too small. The company offered half refund for keeping not returning these pants.
2.0,I should have listened to the reviews. I only was able to use the bears all others were damaged or poorly made.
2.0,"Very Very wide footbed and loose straps... My daughter won't wear them because the sole is ""floppy"" which caused her to trip and scrap her knee."
2.0,It didn’t fit like the model at all. Way too big
2.0,Doesn't shine. It's pretty dull.<br />I wouldn't recommend anyway.
2.0,One of the Pompoms fell off after wearing the scarf one time.
2.0,They are ok but the metal feels and looks very cheap
2.0,Very pretty color but the material and sizing is off.
2.0,Not to bad
2.0,It was late and I had to look for it at a UPS after I was on the phone for days with Amazon! Not happy with this whole prime thing if I have to drive 15miles to pick my items! The dress is small . not true to size.
2.0,"Loved the look, dress was heavier than expected which isn’t a bad thing. Only Big complaint is the studs/rhinestones fell off. Wash by hand. You might get two wears out of it."
2.0,It's pretty cheaply made.  It should have come with the glasses as it does when you buy Peepers in an actual store.
2.0,Color is cuter in pics. Does not fit well according to size measurements. No way to return.
2.0,jacket  use that word carefully in Minnesota. New winner lightest sorta flannel jacket.  wow came from king size  disappointed
2.0,"I am very physically active. Workout 5 nights a week with weights and bike about 60 miles a week. I am starting to incorporate swimming into my routine. My current baggy swimsuit made for the beach is less than ideal for swimming distances.<br /><br />Looked at similar items online. Since I am just starting out I was not willing to pay the higher prices. Boy to I wish I would have spent the money to go with a brand that is known for competitive use.<br /><br />I would call theses a swim suit. More like a cheap pair of biking shorts, a lesser version of under armor. Little if any lining. Not worth the money.<br /><br />These will never see a swimming pool."
2.0,They okay but the part that goes into your earlobe is a bit uncomfortable. It irritates the ear.
2.0,"Bag comes as it appears, I'm satisfied with the bag but upon opening it there was a foul fishy smell inside of the purse, I have tried to spray perfume and febreeze to mask it and the smell is still there, for that I rate two stars."
2.0,"This purse is just the right size and has the handles I wanted... even though I wanted silver handles, the bag looked like it was just what I was looking for so I ignored the gold. But it's just one big cave. Not a single pocket. And the shoulder strap makes me ask why bother putting one on? The strap looks like something that came from the garage. I didnt mond that since I didnt plan on using it. But where it enters and exits the bag is just a hole punched through the material. So if you remove the chord strap there are 2 big holes on each side.  Sadly it just doesnt fit the nill.<br /><br />I've had a hard time finding a purse I'm happy with and I really had Hope's this one would be the one for now but nope. Too many design flaws to be practical. It's too bad because it's really a nice looking purse."
2.0,This is REALLY SIZED WRONG.  I WEAR A SMALL BOUGHT A MEDIUM AND IT STILL FITS SMALL
2.0,"The only thing I liked was the light up on shoe.  The length between end of shoe and toe piece was way to long.  I ordered the correct size and they do not fit well at all, heel reaches total back end and almost over.  These were very stiff and cheaply made. Not happy with them, but grandson liked them so keeping them."
2.0,"This fits fine, looks fine, feels fine but.........the only problem is that the seam thats supposed to be in the back of the dress is directly down the front of the dress. Makes it super weird looking because the tye dye doesn't match up correctly. I just got a defective one I think though other wise it was fine. I kept it figured ill wear it out on the boat nobody will see me lol but they also refunded me the money because of this issue."
2.0,"I bought the size recommended for a woman with size 9.5 shoe. ( L/XL) They were way too big, so I had to return them. It was very convenient to return them at Kohl’s!"
2.0,"This is NOT waterproof. Works well in very light rain for about 10-15 minutes. However if it's consistently raining on you, say while you're walking around the streets of Cape Town in the rain (for which you bought this jacket for) you will be damp underneath it, and angry.  The fit however is great."
2.0,I hate this shirt. Its wayyyy too small and it looks like s*** on
2.0,Used it once or twice and it was more trouble than it was worth.
2.0,Runs too small. Not the brand I expected on the tag
2.0,"Corre exactamente a la talla, si buscas que quede apretado usa una menos"
2.0,Print far too small to read.
2.0,They feel like dollar store glasses. Frames are super cheap quality. Hopefully they actually block the UV rays and actually protect my eyes.
2.0,It is an unappealing fabric and runs small.
2.0,I ordered this in a 10 for my daughter that wears a 10 in girls.  The bottoms are so big that teenager in high school could wear them they fall off of her. No happy!
2.0,They lasted maybe month! They are see through and ripped in the crotch area... I liked the compression but they were not a very good material.
2.0,"I am disappointed in how small the earrings are.  They look ""child sized""."
2.0,Cheap--difficult to walk in. Donated.
2.0,"The robe is cute but the quality is really poor, very thin, sewed not neatly, a lot of lose threads inside the robe, the pockets broke in a day (we fixed, but anyway) not happy with quality at all. I am afraid to wash it, it can easily fall apart"
2.0,Material is see through and it’s too short. Very light weight!
2.0,I love this suit. It would be great for a pool. But 15min in the ocean and sand is permanently trapped in it. Even after washing it’s got black specks of sand stuck in the fabric.
2.0,This pill box is very nice but it is extremely small.  It is not practical.
2.0,Cute dress but very short and ran very small. I returned
2.0,Easily breaks.
2.0,Names spelled wrong
2.0,"Does not fit correctly, the cuff is placed poorly and broke off immediately."
2.0,"The overall look of the pendant is nice, however it is MUCH bigger than expected and the chain is much to short for the size of the Chief head. At first I thought I could make it work by switching the chain, but the pendant can't come off so there goes that. It's very disproportionate and I really don't think the makers thought it through. I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for a subtle high quality Chief pendant necklace."
2.0,"The dress is beautiful and it does have some stretch as other people mention.  The top half looked stunning when I tried it on.  Unfortunately the skirt was cut wrong so there is a u shaped lift in the front that is definitely not meant to b there.  I rechecked other pics people who were happy posted and it is straight across the bottom, unlike the 1 I received.  The flaw is very obvious while on unfortunately. Super disappointed bc it is otherwise stunning & great fabric."
2.0,The shorts are great I just don't like the button that is a clip.
2.0,The design looks like what was ordered but it requires a specific body type to look like it fits. The thighs have too much fabric to fit against the skin and when laced it looks floppy. I ordered one size larger to accommodate my body type however it was still too tight everywhere besides to knees and the ankles. In the first ten seconds of putting them on the crotch seam came undone. These are not very flattering.
2.0,This is not for the girlies who have a figure to them. It does not go past my butt & I wear a size large in pants which is what I got. I do however like the length. Just wish it fit.
2.0,I loved the look but it’s way to tight!
2.0,Like the design but way too small.
2.0,True to size they are okay
2.0,"I really thought these were going to be super nice sunglasses.  The company put a lot of time and thought in their product, by adding case to carry, cloth to clean, packaging.  The actual sunglasses were too light and plastic felt like dollar store cheap plastic.  I currently do wear Costa and I'm not spoiled.  I live on the coast so being on the water and having good shades really is important.  These are advertised for boating but to be honest they just aren't.  I received item through Vine Voice for an honest review and it does bother me when I can't give a great review.  I think if they worked on the product a little more they might have something to market.  The positive I can say is I think if you dropped them 100 times they aren't going to break if that helps. Sorry folks, these just didn't stand up to my standards of even cheap sunglasses."
2.0,These earrings are very tiny.  Smaller than I expected.
2.0,I bough this as an accent to a top and was happy with how it looked but it didn’t fit right at all. It would rise up to the middle of my bust and would not stay put.
2.0,These are practically see through. They leave very little to the imagination.
2.0,"I love the cut and fit of this dress. It is very flattering and can show more or less cleavage depending on how you wrap it. Unfortunately, the sleeve ripped after just one use. The fabric is a chiffon type material (not exactly sure what you would call it) but it isn't easy to sew back together. I know it's  a cheaper dress, but for $30 I would expect to be able to wear it more than once. And I didn't do a lot of moving around. Very disappointed."
2.0,Worn very few times and the waistband is fraying all over and begging  bc to come apart. Cheap.
2.0,Pants are perfect why I did not return top sucks
2.0,"The rubber sole is soft and has poor support. Walking around at work and I can feel rocks right through the sole. Sometimes it is painful ☹️. I can depress the sole with my fingers.  If you work in a warehouse with a flat concrete/wood floor. They might be fine,<br /> but a construction site, not so much."
2.0,The shoes arrived quickly and my daughter thinks they are cute but we are already regretting this purchase and have purchased a different pair of house shoes to replace them. They have no support at all and they have already started to turn over on one side making it a hazard for her to walk in. I feel like she is going to twist her ankle in them. Waste of money.
2.0,"Nice material, but not long enough. I am 5'9&#34; and they are too short. Had to return."
2.0,"Stiff plastic, I have owned two of these and both pair had a screw fall out."
2.0,Impossible to use with any other belt than the cheap piece of ductape that came with it.
2.0,Seams i. The Arpita and very rough and tight.<br />The hurt the underarms.<br />I bought this to wear after surgery… could stand to have it in due to the arms.
2.0,"I wear between 2x-3x, so I ordered a 3x.  I couldn't even get my arms in because of the waist. It might have fit if the waist had some give or stretch. The bodice has some stretch and is thick material. The skirt has a slight stretch to the material but it felt like upholstery fabric, too heavy for a dress. I am returning the dress."
2.0,"It fit fine and the colors are great. A sad thing, it tore as soon as my wife put it on."
2.0,"I normally wear a XL or a 1X in clothing. Sweaters, however have lots of stretch, so I usually get a XL in them. After reading the reviews of this product I decided to error on the side of caution and get a 2X sweater. It was tight. Like really tight. I didn't like it at all."
2.0,"I ordered the wine, it is a beautiful color but material is really thin. It would be a comfortable sleep, lounge jumpsuit if it wasn't so extra tight in the waist. I am 5.4 108 pounds, normally an extra small but always buy small , I would have to buy this in a large to even be able to zip it without help. Otherwise it would be very cute."
2.0,The fit not true to size. Fabric very thin. Not sure can wear without undergarment. I did not wear as planned on cruise. Am returning.
2.0,They are so cool but I just opened them and broke.  I just will fix it myself :/
2.0,Rolls great. One trip to Dallas and one of the foot pieces is missing with a sharp screw sticking out!  So disappointed!!
2.0,They are not completely black. Almost like a washed out grey on the thighs. I was really disappointed bc I thought I bought jet black pants. I missed the return window so I can't get my money money. Won't be buying these in the future.
2.0,Way too small. Gave to my 10 yr old daughter. Must be from an Asian company. It is super cute tho.
2.0,I wear a large everywhere else but in this I am going to return it and order the 2XL
2.0,The item is much shorter than pictured
2.0,See threw material doesn’t stretch
2.0,Really cute but the pendant fell off several times and was finally lost the first time I wore it.
2.0,"Nicer than all the other stuff from Asia but still way to small and very disappointing because I really like this style. I am not that big, 6’2 220 and its to short along the sleeves and barely covers the belt."
2.0,"I was actually pretty disappointed with this item. After looking at the pictures other buyers posted I thought it was going to be okay. However, when I received this item I immediately put it on and took it off. The straps are way too in on the bust, plus it doesn't have the same shape as shown in the picture, there is no waist as shown, it's just the part that covers the bust then it comes straight down. The body portion of the dress is too big, I ordered a size larger than I thought I would need for the bust, which is too small and gives me Uniboob. Not happy."
2.0,Love them except....when you bend over they are completely awe through.
2.0,"Super thin, like a scratchy thin t shirt. Not soft, bit on the small side. Cheaply made."
2.0,Looks very nice but it frays
2.0,Too short and sailor like.
2.0,I returned because I thought these had wrist straps to help keep the mittens in place like I purchased for my daughter. I’m sure these would work but I have an active baby-toddler and don’t think these would hold up through a good snow playtime.
2.0,red is a bright orange was not happy with the colors.
2.0,"I was really excited to receive this dress today...thought it would be perfect for fall, HOWEVER where the top piece is attached to the bottom it appears to be crooked and has the beginning of a hole in it. Very disappointed, as I know every time I wear this dress my eyes will go straight to the crooked line!"
2.0,"Size runs extremely small. Ordered a large for my wife and when she got it we thought they had sent us a kids size large. My suggestion, order at least two sizes larger than you usually would."
2.0,"I love this suit, but it has no support for a large chest. I wore it once and it faded out to light pink. Not worth your money for this one."
2.0,"The dress has almost no stitches which makes it look a little bit informal (not good not bad), but if you are of thin or medium complexion in the waist area... it will look big<br /><br />The yellow color is pretty"
2.0,A lot larger than I expected for my face anyway.
2.0,"Didn't know what to expect, but saw these and thought OMG i gotta try this. Totally giftable. Charm quality was nicer than expected, and for the price I knew it may be terrible. It's definitely decent. I got the scorpion, it's about 1/2"" all around, thickness maybe a tiny bit under. The only thing is the chain, it's not very long. If it were much shorter, it would be a choker. I have a slightly more slender neck than average, and the charm sits right inbetween my collar bones, maybe a tiny bit lower. So seems like possibly sides for kids. Overall I was pleasantly surprised with the presentation and quality, for the cost. It's unique little gift.<br /><br />UPDATE: Within 3 months it fell apart. The chain lost it's coating and it would make my neck itch (I did not wear this on a daily basis, not even once a WK). It's cute, but know you are basically throwing money away on a fair or street junk item."
2.0,Smelled bad and toes broke off.
2.0,The material was not what I expected.  Very masculine looking and too big.  Going back.
2.0,"I liked the design and fit, but design started coming off the band."
2.0,They work but won’t last long. Knock strap is too short. They snag easy and there were a lot of frayed edges all over both aprons.
2.0,"Too big.  Don't like the color.  Should be red white and blue,  not orange."
2.0,Beautiful dress but not for large busts
2.0,This product runs small.  Lean toward the larger size
2.0,"Nice for just a fitting tank top like heat gear kind but not slimming or compressing as said in description. My husband's 6""2 and 220lbs and first ordered a large and it was big on him.  Then he got a small and it still wasn't slimming at all. Just like a heat gear shirt with a bit of elastic in it"
2.0,"This sweater arrived and I was shocked to find that it is full on velvet! I think they must have changed this product bc it was not described as velvet in the description at all. I am returning it. It looks pretty much like the same sweater but the velvet texture just made it look gross in my opinion-I felt like an old lady, not a hip young mom. Ha. If they change the product they need to update their product info!"
2.0,BROKE after 5 days!!!!
2.0,I returned this dress because the top was a stiff polyester feel and the bottom was a nice soft cotton/silk feel. I really wanted to like it since it had pockets but the top just didn't feel or look nice. The 'belt' is just two attached pieces you can tie. There are sewn in pleats on both breasts that also looked awkward.
2.0,Poor quality. Split down the seam after a few weeks of gentle wear. Would not recommend.
2.0,"Runs big, was not a true size 5. No size marking in the shoe. Most likely, I was shipped a size 5. Gave the shoes away, it didn’t fit me."
2.0,They are cute but very thin & they aren’t true to size at all! I contacted the seller & didnt really get the help I was looking for. But I guess you get what you pay for
2.0,Not big enough calf room but I liked the look of the boot . I hate they didn't fit .
2.0,Short in front
2.0,Disappointed in the quality of the metals. Cute packaging
2.0,"I just wore these leggings for the second time and they already have a run on both legs (in the thigh area) and the seam is tore in the butt area. I was VERY surprised and disappointed since I washed them with my delicates and didn't put them in the dryer. In addition, they fit fine in the front but do not come pass the small of my back in the rear so every time I bent over, I had to pull them up. I will not be purchasing anymore."
2.0,Very tiny sweater
2.0,"Very slick nylon material not very stretchy, and only a 1 inch leg (looked like more in the photos) seems like it is constructed well. Has a gusset across the crotch that runs from leg him to leg hem, so no seam across the crotch, but no cotton or anything absorbent. That’s a problem if you are prone to UTIs"
2.0,Shirt fit really small and was constantly irritating my skin no matter what I did
2.0,Didn't come with adapters so have to buy them separately
2.0,"I am giving a 2 star rating ,  heavy on the ear , and I thought I would receive a pair .....nice for a special occasion if I had 2"
2.0,Just meh. Took forever to get here.  Not great quality but they work.
2.0,"Not very good quality, too big"
2.0,"The first few gloves on top of the box are very strong and new, but as I digged deep in the middle of the box, they are yellow  and dirty,and look to be used."
2.0,"No heels in socks, hardly wearable"
2.0,Color changed in 2 weeks
2.0,Purchased this shirt for my husband for our family pictures on the beach and it was considerably smaller than what we expected from a Ralph Lauren Polo shirt. My husband wears mostly Ralph Lauren shirts and this one did not fit like his others. We were even wondering if this shirt was even an authentic Ralph Lauren. We returned it because it was too small. Then the seller is charging us a 20 percent restocking fee on top of my having to pay for shipping the item back to them. So disappointed. I will make sure not to buy from this seller again!
2.0,"After purchasing the tool that was recommended for removing links, I was able (with great difficulty) to shorten this band.  However, be aware that it is VERY difficult and you will probably bend some of the individual coils that would make it impossible to mount between your watch lugs.  Too bad."
2.0,"These were great until I washed them, and they started unraveling on the top, so they are not wearable anymore. I'm bummed. It's too late to return them."
2.0,Frame too big for my face....seems more suited for a women.
2.0,Quality is low. Elastic and waistline are low quality.
2.0,Even the Santa hat was low quality. The hat is made for a child but the other accessories for an adult.
2.0,"I guess I thought the way the ties looked asymmetrical in the photo was just a bad camera angle but no, they are definitely not even and it looks so incorrect I literally can't get past it to even wear it. I am 5'4"" tall and the way the waist is banded also looks awkward and unflattering. The thickness of the fabric is nice but the design and fit are misses for me. Very disappointing."
2.0,"This jacket is perfection... with the exception of the SMELL - chemically, industrially, migraine inducing.. I've never smelled anything like this in my life!  Currently its in the garage where it will hopefully air out enough to be able to wear it by late spring."
2.0,Fit just a bit snug. Returned.
2.0,"If the zipper worked, I'd give this clutch 5 stars.  The zipper separates about 2&#34; from beginning the zip and no matter what I try cannot get the zipper to perform correctly.  This creates of hazard of losing items."
2.0,"Cheesy cheap material , more a gag gift than an actual gift !"
2.0,"Bought this for my son, it works but when he sits or bends his legs, the strap of course stays straight, so it looks weird in his pants, plus they pull too much on his socks- maybe because hes so tall, idk. But he gets annoyed by these and just takes them off."
2.0,The band hurts.
2.0,"Im 5'1. 140pd, order a small (blue) med (orange). I could have order a ex small. I usually wear a med."
2.0,"I actually wanted to return this shirt, but they said that they will only return $8 because of shipping charge. Anyways I kept it, but I can’t wear it, too small. I wear size S-M, and according to people’s reviews I got one size bigger, the large. But, it is still small. And the quality is very poor ( stitches, and cuts)."
2.0,Pretty but doesn't stay on nose well.
2.0,"Ordered one size larger than usual, a 14 but even so, it fit like a size 6 or small. I returned."
2.0,Love the quality however it came in a black box and the black rubbed onto the bow tie. So it looks dirty. I will try to wash it out... if that works out well I will change my review accordingly. For now I was disappointed since my son has prom in a few days.
2.0,Nice hat. Was shipped sealed in plastic but mine had something on it while sealed in plastic (see picture) it washed out easily but that was pretty disappointing. Otherwise a nice hat
2.0,"The quality was excellent, but the color is hard to translate by a photo. Looks very different in person and changes in the different lighting."
2.0,"Ordered these for my daughter for the upcoming spring, but when they came, there was already some black scruffs on them, and the color is more orange than tan.  The reason we really sent them back though was because neither shoe had the metal snap on it so that you could fasten the sandal.  Maybe it was just the shoe we got, but with the other issues I just sent them back.  They would have been really cute in another color and if they were functional."
2.0,The bow tie unraveled within an hour of him wearing it. The suspenders remained intact
2.0,"The black band has the color coming off of it already after wearing it for just a little over a week.  The bottom side that rubs against the keyboard when typing has started to lose the black color and the regular metal is showing through now.  Unless this band is meant for decorative use only and not to be used during the normal course of activities, I would not recommend.  The band is very. Light compared to others but I’m disappointed with the quality for the price.  I could have spent half as much and got the same results.  I would look elsewhere for a band similar to this."
2.0,"ordered numbers  1-50, used them for LOTO locks received (2) of 41 to 50 and no 31-40"
2.0,It didn’t even fit any of my fingers not even my pinky finger and it was not adjustable
2.0,It’s cheap and small enough sad very disappointed for god sake’s anyway can’t you send a decent product
2.0,"Cheap shiny fabric, feels like polyester. No compression. Loose at the ankles. 1 inch elastic can be felt loosely moving in waistband. Do not buy."
2.0,"I had high hopes for these, but unfortunately they showed up with a strong chemical smell, and the inside had a strange fuzz that made them very uncomfortable when my daughter tried them on.  Also, note that the size is off.  They ran bigger than indicated."
2.0,"Great bracelet, however does not adjust 6-9 inches.  The smallest it adjusts is 7&#34;, which is too large for my wrist."
2.0,Didn’t like the band
2.0,"I ordered the correct size, they seem to run small.  Not expected from Gloria Vanderbuilt"
2.0,Very small and  ugle.
2.0,This dress I finally tried it on.A batwing disaster.Nothing like the picture.The measurements were not as described.The cut is really big.Not a quality dress.The material was nice.But everything else is not.
2.0,I bought 2 of these. They were supposed to come in their own boxes. Both of these were put into the same box. Makes it hard to give to 2 different people<br />I suggest you buy the beads and elastic string and make your own.  Would not recommend buying these.
2.0,"Way too small, not for the curvy!"
2.0,"As I was removing the band from the packaging, one of the stones fell out, so I packaged it right back up and returned it. If just removing it from the package makes a stone fall out, I can’t imagine how many more would fall out with normal wear. The Sakura pink did look pretty close to my rose gold Fitbit, but I wouldn’t say it was a perfect match as others indicated. I loved the look, so it’s unfortunate it had to go back due to poor quality."
2.0,Impossible to put on the Tragus!! Item is nice but unless you are very versed in putting these in forget it.
2.0,The frame is sooo good. But lens suck......... bad quality
2.0,Can't say I'd buy another pair.
2.0,The fabric is very thin and stretchy. It came super wrinkly and ironing didn’t remove the lines completely  Looks cheap.
2.0,I ordered what I thought was gold but instead it seemed like a glittery yellow.  Ok belt but wish it would have been a true gold not yellow.
2.0,"We purchased two sets of sunglasses from two separate vendors: one for our bridesmaid team and one for our groomsmen team. What's most interesting is that the bridesmaid/bride sunglasses set was a full $2 cheaper than this package for groomsmen, but was a least three times better quality.<br /><br />This groomsmen set is basically what you expect: cheap, one-time-use-only flexible sunglasses with cheap, easy-to-rub-off paint on the sides. However, the other company's sunglasses had sturdy, durable plastic frames and engraved ""Bride"" and ""Bridesmaid"" lettering. A world of difference. If you are okay with these sunglasses being used for one day only, and you don't mind if the wording rubs off too easily, then this might be a worthy purchase. For 4-5 hours for our wedding, it did the job. However, if we'd had more time, we would have preferred to go through a higher-quality store, perhaps on Etsy. Good luck!"
2.0,Not colorfast .. the red had already bled into the white when I received it from the company.  Not a soft fabric and it's like one med length tube ..  nothing like I expected and I would not buy it again.
2.0,Loved them at first but after just a week it started falling apart and now it got strings all over the place.  Disappointing.  I wouldn't recommend getting this for yourself or your kiddos
2.0,"This scarf cost less than $3 so I am not really in a position to complain. However, the hem on this scarf is not sewn very well. The stitches are very far apart and it was obviously done hastily. I am giving this scarf as a quirky little stocking stuffer, but I know that the hem is going to fall to pieces after a wear or two. Then it is only a matter of time before the fabric starts fraying.<br /><br />Like I said though, for less than $3 I can't complain. The fabric is very cute and soft. The length is also good for looping it around once. It looks like an infinity scarf that way."
2.0,"I thought I would try this, and it it not for me. It is a bit tough to unlatch when you want to remove it.<br /><br />I decided after I bought this to give the Grip6 belt a try. I bought a 3 pack of those and it is hands-down superior to this. Search for Grip6 here on Amazon or go directly to their website like I did."
2.0,"I was disappointed because I ordered these in both brown and black.  The very first time I put the brown ones on, and laced them, three of the hooks on the side popped off!  I haven't had this problem with the black ones so far, so keeping my fingers crossed.  Not best quality, but you get what you pay for."
2.0,Tight for adults
2.0,This vest has sub-standard zippers--on the vest itself and on both pockets. It's 100% polyester and<br />is poorly made. I expected a better product based on the reviews I read.
2.0,"After reading all the reviews and comments about sizing being really small, we ordered an XL for my 11 year old son.  It is huge!  Probably the size of a men's medium.  There is no tag inside to say what size we received.  My son really wants the hoodie but I am hesitant to repurchase.  This is definitely going back."
2.0,My dog ripped a hole in one glove after a week
2.0,The earrings are much smaller than I had hoped.  Pretty color and I love the setting.  Just wish they were bigger.
2.0,I used the size chart provided and it's not accurate. The swimsuit is very cute. It's quality matches the price.
2.0,The ear ring broke before I got to wear them ... I love the necklace wear it a lot...they did refund my money...  I just love it..
2.0,"I had to return this top and would have exchanged it if they offered larger size.  I ordered a small #nd actually it fit fine everywhere except the forearms appears lose on the picture but was extremely too small, tight end constrictive and let me just say, I do not have fat arms but actually have skinny forearms.  I would have needed a size large for the forearms to be comfortable yet the small was good for the body and it was very soft and I would have loved it otherwise.  Too bad they don’t offer any other sizes."
2.0,Heavier than expected turned mine into 2 pendants
2.0,"I normally wear a xlarge but reading reviews I went with XX, they are still snugger than I like! Everything else is exactly what I wanted but definitely not sized correctly!"
2.0,too big. looks fake like childrens toys.
2.0,"This dress was quality material and a great pattern, but it was enormous. We bought the smallest size, so we cannot size down. I have small children, and we’re used to things being too big, but this was easily three sizes too large. It’s really a shame. It would’ve been so, so cute at such an affordable price."
2.0,"I was disappointed with the apron for two reasons. First is the font. It was supposed to be Star Wars but it's just regular block font. The second is the image of the crossed rolling pins. Doesn't really look like rolling pins, just an ""X"" with ovals on the ends. Will probably return."
2.0,"These are huge, I thought they were little dainty earrings but they're larger than a quarter each."
2.0,The lace in the neck comes all the way up to under your chin. Not at all like the picture. A little fitted around your belly area
2.0,Too short.  Need 36 inch.  I should have measured old places before I ordered them.
2.0,Nothing really wrong with them other than it’s a stupid design.
2.0,I received this in a timely fashion and was very excited to wear it. The fit with respect to size was right on point. I wear a Large. The length however didn’t work with my torso. I am only 5’5”. Clearly not tall. The center band was just under my chest. Needs to be for a short person.
2.0,"Too long. The photos they use are fake.<br />When you wear it, it gets bunched up around your neck and jaw so you can’t see it.<br />Also I think the face itself is too low, because the eyes of the mask fall below my jaw. I wanted it to be more like in the photo.<br /><br />It’s soft and has a nice sleeve to put replaceable filters, but sadly I’ll be returning mine. Maybe because I’m female my head/neck are shorter? I don’t know.."
2.0,"The sock on my right foot was partially damp after one use. I was wearing these in a marsh area with a lot of water, mud and brush. Perhaps only good for light use in a stream or low river."
2.0,The rings were really big and looked weird when I put them on.
2.0,"Got this dress and fell in love. Perfect color, size, fit, ect. I was so happy. I already got one dress from them (something simple for the office) and wanted to get this one for a pop of color. Wore it 2x before the strap broke. Its so cheaply made. I was utterly heartbroken."
2.0,"The style was amazing - the lens were dark enough to block out harsh sunlight and was polarized for adequate protection. The cat eye shape was flattering, and the size was big enough to protect from the sun. However, pressure applied to the lens when cleaning it resulted in bubbles forming around the edges of the frame and looked horrible. The glasses slide off the nose very easily, and the earpieces were so flexible that they were bended and eventually snapped off."
2.0,"Ordered small and still too big, hole in right pocket. Not sure what they mean in a size small. I'm 5'11 160 gym toned body and these would fit a body builder double my size. Not to mention the hole in the right pocket"
2.0,I was very disappointed when I received this because the colors were very girly- pinks and lilacs.  When I wrote to the seller about it I was told that the pattern on each individual item may vary depending on what part of the pattern makes it onto the item.  Ugh.
2.0,quality was good but size was way off!
2.0,change the colors so fast
2.0,"My daughter wears a 5T which is what we ordered. When she tried it on it fit way too loosely around her chest and arms. So we returned it and bought a 4at. The 4T fit, but then we noticed one strap was significantly less wide than the other, and some fringe from the lace was missing in places. Also, the back cutout was sewn incorrectly to where a piece was folded over and actually stitched. The 4T was also quite high on my daughter who’s 44” tall."
2.0,The string was so small I felt alittle cheated I couldn't even go around  my ankle once
2.0,I ordered an xxl<br />This was actually way too small .<br />It was sized more like a medium .
2.0,I like the design but these glasses were crooked. I was able to bend them a bit to make them work. They are ok but I would not buy them again.
2.0,really cute. but also really cheap looking
2.0,This product arrived broken in half.
2.0,It's way to small. If you wear a size medium you shouldn't have to buy two sizes larger. I won't be buying clothing anymore that ships from China
2.0,"Loved the way they looked, but not the fit. As mentioned by others, the material is way too thick, and doesn't stretch. These do not accommodate a wide calf."
2.0,The fit of this cardigan was weird.  The body was roomy but the sleeves were too short.  Overall it's okay but I don't plan on keeping it.  Too expensive to mail it back so I'm just going to find a friend it fits or donate it to a shelter.
2.0,"Not flattering, V-neck is very high and waist a little loose. I was expecting a dress with more stretch so that it would hug the body above the waist before it flared out. It did not do this. Likely will return."
2.0,"If you're buying these for kids, they're fine, but far too small and thin for adults."
2.0,"I wish I had taken a photo. The only thing I like about it was the color and the print. I purchased a medium, but it didn't fit well at all. The sleeves were tight and completely uneven. Left sleeve stopped at my wrist and the right stopped just below my elbow."
2.0,It's really short and not as cute as pictured
2.0,"Too large, and very see through"
2.0,Not a bad top if you are shorter. Fit in the body but sleeves and length were too short- had to return.
2.0,Can't get it open with the tool
2.0,Estamuy delgada y la tela súper incomlda
2.0,"Although it is very comfortable and looks nice....it is not really water resistant.....after less than 7 month 1 of the strap holders came off, and the other  is close to coming off..I  would say the reason is water....I shower with my watch on"
2.0,The stitching on these pants never never last through that wash very long. Comfortable but don't last as long as all my other pants.
2.0,Not a good fit. Seems to ride-up in the back.
2.0,"I purchased this earring because I am an earring fanatic and have multiple piercings. Unfortunately, it broke off in my ear after only three days of wearing it! Very frustrating!"
2.0,"Cadena extremadamente delgada, dije diminuto. De verdad no sé que hacer con esto."
2.0,This was okay. A bit cheaper and tighter than expected. Just unflattering.
2.0,I shouldn’t need instructions to put on a top. It’s literally two loops that don’t make sense. I wouldn’t buy this unless you already know how to put it on. I couldn’t figure it out and couldn’t find a tutorial. It’s not a tie. The fabric is nice tho.
2.0,"Unraveled in washer, maybe I should have hand washed it.?🤔"
2.0,Had to give it to my 10 year old daughter. Fit her great.
2.0,"Does not fit well, I returned it"
2.0,"I'm 5'5ish and 125 pounds. Normal weight and this swallows me whole. I had to double check and see if I ordered a wrong size but see it was the &#34;one size&#34; type setting, which normally works out for me. It would look better on someone larger than me though. The color was nice and it was here quick. It does look as pictured, just huge in size. I feel like I'm wearing a hospital gown. I'll either decide to return it which is all good or risk 12 bucks and try washing it to see if it shrinks a little. I expect to have it fit loosely as that is how I like my clothes and especially bathing suit covers but this would look better on someone built larger than me."
2.0,Great dress but WAY too short!  Unwearable!
2.0,Good: Looks and feels like a solid watch.<br /><br />Cons: Mine came with crooked dial which didn't align with the bezel. Paying at this price is unacceptable. Certina qutility control needs some work.
2.0,"The rings are soooo small, don't buy"
2.0,".. even the small is huge (and I am 5'9 145)... and the 'knitting' fell apart in a large number of places after washing, had to fix all over..."
2.0,Not happy with product . To thin and short
2.0,"Bracelet was nice and large, and even loose on my large wrist which is what I was looking for but the tie off point was messy and kept scratching and pinching my wrist as I wore it."
2.0,I added an extra size to the size I ordered but they were still too small.
2.0,Its a beautiful skirt but the waist was extremely tiny compared to the flare of the skirt. The fabric is not the highest quality....it feels more like hard plastic (similar to a raincoat). I am disappointed.
2.0,Poor quality stitching
2.0,They shrunk with washing. And are now too small. More for a child
2.0,"The shorts fit perfect, the jacket to tight and small"
2.0,One of the stones already fell out and it’s only been a week. Do like it that it’s stainless steel and won’t tarnish
2.0,"The shirt is cute.  Although the seller mentioned a few times that this is a light and flowy top... it is not. It is heavy a CD cru thick with a liner.  It would be great if market as a fall shirt, I would've been happier receiving this in October rather than May.... It fits true to size description,  shoulders fit on the small side and i am petite.  Wil be returning,  not as described as light and flowy, unfortunately."
2.0,"Received the mask and it was broken. No place on the mask to insert the stick. The color was exactly what I wanted. I ordered another mask, which I received today."
2.0,"These glasses were nice and dark, but they were so difficult to attach to my glasses that I actually returned this product!"
2.0,Very nice looking but the magnet does not hold well. I am constantly readjusting it. Would not recommend it
2.0,"This dress is just...off. The sizing and proportions don't work well together. The waist line should be about two inches higher (at least--I have shorter legs and a long torso), the straps are too long (but hemming them wouldn't work because the shaping for the chest area would be off), and the XS would probably fit someone a size 4, not a 0/2. I was hoping that since the seller updated the dress saying that the sizing was changed for American sizing that I could trust that an XS would fit like an XS and that wasn't the case. The whole dress just fits awkwardly. However, the fabric is pretty nice and the dress looks like the main picture."
2.0,This fits as expected BUT make sure you air it out before wearing it!  WOOF!  I cannot even explain the smell without offending anyone.  My girlfriend had the same problem.
2.0,"It doesn't fit very well, and the color seems odd."
2.0,Loved the color however not true to size .. material more of the stretch .
2.0,They broke within a couple of days. The hinge just fell apart for no reason. I'm not sure if these were defective or what but I was disappointed.
2.0,I ordered the white and there were stains all over it. Very disappointed as I was going to wear it this weekend to a birthday party.
2.0,This fit weird and was too small! So sad
2.0,This is a beautiful coat. Its soft and looks like it would hold up nicely. Woah is this thing small. I ordered a medium. And need an XL. I gave it to my mom who is 5'2 and 103 pounds and it's too small for her.. I'm trying to figure out what toddler could get into the XS!!!!
2.0,"Jeans that arrive are nothing like the picture at all. They are nice, comfy, fit good and everything but they are completely different then the ones from the picture. Not classy at all, look cheap like leggings."
2.0,hole in the pocket :-(
2.0,"The length of this shirt os too short. I am busty, but I am also very short. In a size.large enough to go around my chest, this shirt barely met my pants. It's too short dor me to even give it to family or friends. Just poorly designed in that respect. Returning."
2.0,Bright yellow just as advertised. Very see through and larger than needed but that's expected with a one size product.
2.0,"I ordered two different colors (both adult), but they were significantly different in size.  One of them fits okay (not very snug); the other is huge.  I'd send it back, but it's not worth the cost."
2.0,"Good length, kinda snug in the arms. I do have heavy arms however I lost 30 pounds and still feel restricted in the arms. Lightweight and comfortable"
2.0,I normally wear medium and these are really too tight! The length is a good fit for fingers. I don't know what they are good for since washing dishes is no good. I could order large but still that will not make them any longer at the wrist.
2.0,They are very heavy boots! Buyer be aware.
2.0,"Loved the styling, but the fit is WAY too small"
2.0,"Disappointing purchase-  too short, thin material, wider than anticipated."
2.0,"This dress is HUGE.  I'm 5'6/140 lbs, bought a small (I'm usually a medium).  Fits like an enormous sack,  Be warned - the straps are not adjustable.  Bummed but returning it seems too complicated so letting others know!"
2.0,would be great if i fit... im a size 2 in jeans and a m is too tight...
2.0,Too big. Poor quality.
2.0,Just think the measurements are off. Way too small and I ordered based on size chart.
2.0,The glue holding these sunglasses together is crap. Broke the very first day. Looks nice but u get what you pay for
2.0,I had high hope for these leggings but they were too small and sheer. I gave them away to my little cousin and shes rocking them (shes in middle school).
2.0,So small that i donated it to the Salvation Army
2.0,"These would work for kids. Adult men, not so much. And thin is an understatement."
2.0,I ordered a size up and they were still too small. Quality is okay but run very small. I’m upset because the sizing says it fits true to size and they don’t.
2.0,"Oh boy was I bummed about this dress. I loved the look of it from the pictures but the actual dress didn't deliver. The material was much cheaper than you'd except and the worst part was the shape of the skirt. I was hoping for a flowy wrap dress or at least a flowy faux wrap but this dress had no movement and the ruffles did nothing to hide the cheap cut of this skirt that just clung to all areas I wanted to hide. I will say that I was very impressed with the top portion - I NEVER find sleeves that fit my arms but the sequin mesh had some stretch and was roomy enough to be comfortable for me. For this, I give 2 stars. Purchased it in navy blue as well, and it was exactly the same."
2.0,Features a non-elastic side water bottle holder that is guaranteed to launch your bottle of choice across the pavement. There is no soft pocket for sunnies or a phone. There's a deep pocket on the front but it's covered by a seat belt strap so you can't access it with ease. There are much better options out there for the price.
2.0,Wrong band for my watch. It won't fit
2.0,"it's nice, but, much smaller than I thought it would be."
2.0,"be careful with sizing, ordered two and they barely fit my sister & i."
2.0,"The sky blue background on the buckle appeared to be turquoise (or at least the artificial turquoise used in the Far East these days). In reality, upon receipt is is either blue enamel/paint or maybe a low-cost plastic.  In other words, cheesy.  I strongly doubt that any ""Native American Western Indian"" had anything to do with this buckle."
2.0,Very thin Sox with very little cushion!!
2.0,"I ordered a black and white size L.  The design and colors are great, the material is soft and not too bad quality wise. However this is not made for girls with wider hips or a big butt. I'm 5,7 and fit but I have a butt and slightly wider hips, the skirt's waist fits me a bit large but my hips cause the slit of the skirt to almost reveal my underwear. Needless to say this is not for curvy bodies at all."
2.0,I have no idea how to use this thing to keep me warm.
2.0,I was really hoping that this were the kind of swim shorts that had the mesh inside. :-(
2.0,Several of the stones fell out after one month of light wear. I should have read the rest of the reviews after buying this and passed.
2.0,Got the right color and size looks good but wrong print. I wanted the LA one. NOT one that says killin it :( needed for tomorrow I am so bummed.
2.0,"They seem to work but will not stay in mask. I've tried double stick tape, superglue and even white glue. Nothing seems to stick to them."
2.0,It was great until I followed the washing instructions and put it in the dryer now it's a knee length dress and I'm pretty upset
2.0,Beware-custom molded shape for a high-eyed alien I guess. Not adjustable and uncomfortable
2.0,I have to say that right out of the box I was worried about these compression socks. For the price they seemed to be a great deal. I actually really liked everything about them but one thing. The material in the toe is very thin. After one trail run in these socks my toes tore through. I think these may be great for recovery but not for actually activity.
2.0,"VERY PRETTY, vibrant color, way small cut all over. I ordered 2 sizes up and should have orderd 3-4 sizes up"
2.0,The product that is displayed is NOT what was sent.. There was no watch cover only the band.. Not what I ordered or wanted..
2.0,"Had high hopes for these. If you're just laying on the couch, they look cute, but the moment you stand & walk, they fall down."
2.0,The white is no where near white. It is a light tan. It will go back.😕
2.0,These fit really weirdly. The inner shorts are too long and the material is really clingy and unflattering.
2.0,Not a fan of the side slit
2.0,Daughter is a 10/12 so I ordered up to 14/16.  She tried the top on and it barely went over her head - it wouldn't go past her collarbone.  14/16 would probably be a good fit for a husky 5/6 or slim 7/8.
2.0,"I’ve gotten a pack of nose rings from Amazon before and thought I’m getting a better deal than paying 10 for one or a couple but these are very cheap looking and turned my nose green and now the silver color has rubbed out remind you I just got them less than a three weeks , better off looking at other options!"
2.0,These were very thin and small.  Don't look like they will hold up to being worn for very long.
2.0,"The boitvis okay but, as another reviewer said, the shown color is misleading. I'ge got a very dark brown instead of the advertised picture."
2.0,Product gave me rust stains around my finger.
2.0,Picture came out real small. The writing was completely across the hat and big which I had set for it to be alot smaller and underneath the picture.
2.0,"I wanted to like this dress but it’s almost as if someone sewed everything crooked or at an angle. The seams are off, and the dress bulges up in the back near the zipper. The top half sits too low down. Wanted this for a birthday dress but I’m really disappointed in it, and the sellers aren’t customer service oriented."
2.0,"Doesn't hold for long and squishes me into a shape that isn't natural. I tried all sort of angles and couldn't get it too look natural. I'm a C cup and ordered the correct size. Also, I could feel them ""slipping"" in under an hour."
2.0,I ordered a size small and could barely squeeze my waist into it. My waist is 25” and it was super tight. Nice length though. I’m 5’7” and these barely touch the floor with heels on. Thin material.
2.0,The pants are as pictured BUT the string for the waist was missing...
2.0,"I bought these for my husband to wear when he rides his mountain bike.  He had tried 2 other brands before these and did not like the picture quality.  He really liked the picture quality from these glasses, BUT... they quit working after 4 months, right after the warranty expired!  The battery wouldn't charge.  He took them to a jeweler to see if the battery could be changed but it doesn't have a conventional battery, only some kind of little gel pack that's wired in so it can't be replaced.  He also tried a TV repair shop but they couldn't do anything.  They should make the glasses with a changeable battery."
2.0,"I have a pile of other Jinhaos; 992s, X750s. I enjoy everyone one of them. The nib on this one has a ridiculous barb on the tip. It'll take some significant polishing (grinding?) or replacement. I may just put a Goulet Jowo on it.<br /><br />But as it is, it's totally unusable."
2.0,"This sweater is very tight. There’s no stretch, it may be the material.  I’ve ordered from PattyBoutik before and had no issue with sizing. Like I said before it could be the material of the sweater."
2.0,Runs BIG!
2.0,"Ridiculously tiny. Based on reviews, I ordered the largest size they had (XXL -- I normally wear a large) and couldn't get them on. They measured about 12&#34; from one side to the other at the hips when laying flat."
2.0,They feel more than plastic so I will continue using zip-log bags for smaller items.
2.0,Runs small and uncomfy for baby's feet. This is chick but yeah uncomfy and small.
2.0,"For a medium, it was very small.  Also, much to sheer for me."
2.0,"Not the biggest fan.  It didn't fit right, and feels like cheap jewelry.  The pieces are light and flimsy.  I was disappointed."
2.0,The size Medium fits like extra small.
2.0,Clingy. Size up.
2.0,I bought a small and still too loose
2.0,"Hated it.  Returned it.  Too small, fabric felt cheap."
2.0,Cheaply made material pants too small and too short
2.0,Very thin material and runs very small
2.0,Bridge is too narrow; glasses won't stay on. Earpieces are just a little too short to catch my ears.
2.0,"This dress is adorable, colors are beautiful, material is soft, but it fits like a moo-moo if you are a size 0. I weigh 1<br /><br />This dress is adorable, colors are beautiful, material is soft, but if you are a petite person like me, 5'3 100lbs, size 0, it fits like a moo-moo, which is not flattering at all. I wanted this dress to fit me, it is so cute, but unfortunately I had to send it back. Wish they would make it in a smaller size, I would for sure buy it. It's beautiful on the model, but definitely not for small people."
2.0,"Cheap! Cheap! Cheap! The ring is plastic, it won't last.  Color is nice."
2.0,"these are not touch screen gloves. they have marks on the forefinger and thumbs but they do not work. I tried them with the screen protector on and then off. if the seller wishes to exchange them, i will review the replacement"
2.0,I seriously went to a known store. Went to men's graphic tees & bought a size 1XL & can still cut it up to my liking & only paid $10.00. Looks awesome with my canvas hi-top sneakers.
2.0,Works okay on flat faces. Puts a lot of pressure on my nose.
2.0,The size isn't what they said it was
2.0,"Design is fine, I have and still use the clear version of these. But the quality control is terrible. I owned the smoked lens version for about a month before the hinges in the middle broke. I don't really have faith in the clear ones either, though I've owned them for more than twice as long."
2.0,"The fabric is pretty ridgid and the color is much brighter blue than it seems, making it look pyjama like."
2.0,Received with holes on one side of the dress.  More expensive to return than what I bought it for.
2.0,"I bought it to slip into my LV Neverfull pouchette. It fits and services it’s purpose, but it’s cheap and flimsy. Arrived bent."
2.0,"The eyeliner actually cakes u,p cracks, and falls off with the lashes. I was super bummed about it. I guess though you get what you pay for."
2.0,The length was waay longer than expected.
2.0,The skirt is see through!!
2.0,Very light weight material. Not a lot of support
2.0,"My kids loved this shoe, I bought 3 pair, 3 sizes. This is definitely not an everyday shoe, at the end of the night my kids complained their feet hurt which they have never ever done before. So as far as long lasting comfort, this is not a great shoe to wear all day. One pair, the shoes was about half an inch smaller than the other. So they should be listed as slightly imperfect. The button to light up one shoe was missing, although we were still able to get it to light and lastly it comes with duel charging wires but it can only charge one at a time. Overall my kids love the shoes. (Because they’re gold and light up.)"
2.0,"I needed to replace all my pants and took a gamble on these and bought 5 pairs.  Was going to do a full write up review, but after the second wash, the stitching on all the pants are starting to unravel - One of the pants even came with a hole already in the side pocket.  It's a shame because there was a lot of potential here and would have gave this an ok rating.  I am going to try to salvage these some how because this was just way too expensive and hopefully get them restitched professionally or at least properly somewhere.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Rugged material (just poorly assembled).<br />- Fits and looks great/in my case they fit exactly like the picture.  Very relaxed fit, too. Who ever said these are baggy must have ordered the wrong size or has never been to a gym.  If they were more snug or tighter, kneeling or crouching would become uncomfortable.<br />- Versatile - I use them primarily for landscape photography.  The pockets are incredible for this use and so are the knee pads.  You can even put inserts which will save your knees a lot of pain or if you have to kneel in harsh terrain. I have to kneel in cactus often and the extra padding is incredibly helpful.<br />- They are somewhat more breathable than my last pairs of pants (wondering if this is a feature of ripstop fabric).  So in hot weather, there is a slight benefit here since they do not retain as much moisture/sweat.  I haven't been able to test them much in cold weather, but so far they still keep you decently warm.  My guess is they probably are more well adapted for colder weather though vs hot.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Poor stitching, will not last at all.  To give you an idea just how bad, the stitching on my cheap $20 wrangler walmart cargo pants lasted longer than these.  I am in the field all the time, so these things get tested thoroughly.<br />- Very loud pants, noise does not reduce after break in either.  Impossible to be stealthy (for example with wildlife photography this doesn't help).  You can't use fabric softener on these either as supposedly it will cause the colors to fade (personally I could care less about the color so will probably try it on the next wash to see what happens at this point).<br />- If you have pets, these pants will attract all your pet hair like a magnet.  If you get black, be prepared to buy rollers<br />- Velcro fly - anytime you go to the bathroom it sounds like you're taking off a diaper.  They really should have used buttons here, especially since Velcro fails over time.  Not impossible to fix though.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the terrible stitching, I would have given these pants an overall rating of 4.  If you decide to purchase anyways, I would recommend buying a sewing machine and going over everything.  With a good stitch job I can see these lasting 2 years with heavy use.  Keep in mind though, I wear these every day and they get used in brutal conditions and this is what my review is based on.  Because there are some good qualities about these pants, I will give them 2 stars - I imagine people wouldn't wear these everyday like me, so maybe these could still suit your purposes."
2.0,"Did not like the liner, would have preferred a more breathable compression type liner,"
2.0,It’s a pretty good skirt but the bottom of it was to tight it was kinda hard to walk/run in.
2.0,Amended. It’s not very good. Problem is that you cannot fill the water bags to 200 mL. Yes you can but it won’t fit in the vest slots. Now you could fill up to the 100 mL. The problem with that is you cannot lie those ice bags down because if they harden or freeze wide it won’t fit into the slots. Now even if somehow you’re able to sit the ice bags upright and they freeze I’m finding that the edges of the bags will tear the vest. One section already had come out because no matter how much I tried to squeeze the ice bag in it it just won’t fit. This is one of the reasons why there should be complete instructions and warnings because after the fact you were having to return it
2.0,And had a tear on one side of the pocket
2.0,"I wore these shorts 3 times and had 3 buttons on the fly fall right off. Seller isnt the easiest to deal with either, and located overseas.  The velcro that holds the pockets closed is next in line to fall apart. Good material, and they look good but horrible craftsmanship. So unless you enjoy sewing, Id keep scrolling."
2.0,"Well,<br /><br />* So, it reads to measure 9.8inX9.8in, but in actuality it measure 9.5in on three sides and the forth side measures 9in<br />* It is so small that seems to be more fit for a child or young adult<br />* The picture you see here (advertisement) will not hold up that way on a man's suit without aid, it will slip inside.  Perhaps a pocket sq. holder will assist, but personally to me that is like wearing a clip-on tie plus it will add thickness to that pectoral area.<br />* I did the most simple folding (meet all four corners together and insert them into pocket) and it slipped at bottom of pocket<br />* The actual texture in person is ok (not the best nor the worst), the image does a better job than live.<br />* The actual silk/material is thin, thinner than my other hankerchiefs."
2.0,"It's a very nice purple robe, but it had not belt included which was really disappointing."
2.0,"***I HAVE NOT GONE FOR A RUN YET - this review is based off of initial overview coming out of the package***<br />Definitely has a seam across the toe! - the SPECIFIC reason why I bought this was that it stated seamless.<br />The seam is a hard line across.  No effort to try to recede the line into the fabric for the ""seamless"" effect.<br /><br />The compression on the arch feels nice.  Colors are beautiful.  Fabric feels nice.<br /><br />Size small typically fits someone like women's 5-7.  I bought small off the reviews that they tend to run big.  They do feel roomy, as if they are meant for size women's 7.5/8-10.  I wear a 7 - 7.5."
2.0,"Was really cute for my niece. Color faded after one wash, matching little sister outfit way to big for newborn."
2.0,Well when you put the pieces together that last piece is in shape of first piece. It's whatever. If you are going to make somethg to tell. Make it right and with time.
2.0,Baby is right. This is a very cheaply made chain
2.0,This mask looks amazing until you put it on and the smell of the chemicals used chokes you. I left the mask out for 4 days and the smell was still strong enough to burn your eyes. But the biggest disappointment is the fact you can't see out if the mask.  The holes for your eyes are off. No matter who tried on our masks not one person could see out of the eye holes... the mask is extremely big and unpleasant to wear..
2.0,The material is very uncomfortable. Not breathable and too tight. It squeezes my toes and leaves a red line on top of my feet.
2.0,"It was easy to put in and very pretty, I got a lot of compliments. But after wearing it for a few months the bottom part of the ring started to turn green, and leave green stains on my face. I then found out that part of it was fake. My nose even began to be sore. I had to change back to my original nose ring, now I have no more pain."
2.0,"Im not please with the belt, doesnt look like the picture, the color is brighter than i pictured, seems like it would hold up but the color... sigh"
2.0,Much smaller than any other items that size. Return started of difficult but is being negotiated by the shipper. Final verdict is out. Depending on the return.
2.0,I thought it was bigger?
2.0,"These are really cute and soft but the material is thin and the stitching is very low quality-- a hole tore open in the toe on the first day I wore them, and I was just wearing them casually around the house."
2.0,These leggings are so cute and I went off the other reviews. However they were to small for me. Trying to just get them over my calves was difficult. They also aren’t made for short girls.
2.0,"I really wanted to love these but after wearing one just half a day at work, I had to ditch it for a regular face mask. These would be good for just a quick trip out where you don't expect to do a lot of talking, which defeats the purpose of getting these. If you do plan on doing a lot of talking, be prepared for some nasty condensation buildup after about 10 min. I took the mask off because it felt wet on the side of my face and when I did the whole plastic part was wet. I was so embarrassed."
2.0,I have bought several other shorts from various companies.  They all fit  I ordered the same size here and they are too small.  I am stuck in rehab so are unable to pack and return.  I ordered here because they had the only color I wanted.
2.0,"The &#34;stone&#34; fell out after the first day she wore it, but she loved it when she first got it."
2.0,"Color was orange yellow, not a true yellow. Every buttonhole was missing. Two on the pockets, two on the cuffs, and down the front. You couldn’t button this jacket if you wanted to. It’s like a step was skipped when it was made. This jacket should never be available to sell."
2.0,It doesn’t stay silver for more than a month.
2.0,"These are WAY small. Order , at least , 2 sizes more than you thing you'll wear."
2.0,this product didn't hold true to it name. I couldn't see any different in fact everything is yellow
2.0,"The band pulled away from the Fit Bit after about 2 weeks leaving a gap,  so I didn't trust it ."
2.0,"This item was nice, but I wish it had been made clear to me that it isn't real ruby. I wanted to get a real ruby stone and I do feel a bit cheated, honestly..."
2.0,Cute belt but definitely does not wrap around comfortably more than once.
2.0,The set is lovely but the gem popped out of the ring. I was able to easily put it back it but I lost it the first time I wore it!
2.0,"I love the style of this purse, as my old one is similar. The crosses on the purse and wallet did not match each other, as pictured.  The colors of the two items were two different shades of green.  Very disappointed for the price I paid!"
2.0,Material shrunk almost 2 sizes. Not worth it.
2.0,"This would have been a nice dress, except the skirt is see-through."
2.0,Appears well made but very small.
2.0,"As much as I want to love this, I can't. It's absolutely beautiful except for the face that the clear plastic part where your badge is displayed has writing on it. Poor design, it should be completely clear. And the saying is silly, &quot;all play, no work&quot;. Not professional. So, be aware when you buy, that the saying is on the outside of the clear plastic"
2.0,"After wearing this a couple days, the stitching is coming undone"
2.0,Everything was good except for the size I ordered extra large and it came in a medium. This is not the first time this is happened with me ordering T-shirts from Amazon
2.0,"Ordered an extra small for my 5’6, 125 lb body and it is about 3 inches too long. There was also a hole in the neckline. Had to return it"
2.0,I ordered a grey one and what came in was emerald green. But other than that I like the product.
2.0,This item is very cheaply made and is not worth the price. It’s made similar to silk ribbon. I will be returning it.
2.0,Very poor quality and smaller than expected
2.0,Very thin material. Feels and looks cheap!
2.0,"super cute bathing suit but the top is really big, baggy on the sides and no real way to adjust the straps so it lays without the extra fabric on the sides looking baggy (I have 34DD) too bad because the rest is really cute"
2.0,"This jacket looked and felt cheap. I really only like Logo Lounge clothing....it's made better than the regular Logo clothes. I just find the overall craftsmanship of her lines to be poor. They flatter only a certain body type....tall, flat chested women. None of her clothes look good on busty, short people. It would be nice if she'd create a line with more body types in mind."
2.0,Very sloppily made with poor stitching and unfinished seams. Unfortunately the yellow baby shark color is no longer available so I can't return for a new one so I'll have to fix it myself. I know the item is only $12 but whatever happened to quality control and manufacturers taking pride in their work?
2.0,"Leggings have thick compression-like feel to them. I ordered a L, which is my normal size. For reference I am 5’6. 170lbs and wear a size 30inch waist in jeans. But these jeans were sooo thick and tight I couldn’t pull them up! They have some stretch but not enough."
2.0,"Nice color and good fit,washes with no problems.The 3rd time I put it on the zipper broke,not spend your mony on this shirt,"
2.0,These are definitely meant for someone size 6-8 and below.
2.0,They are smashed down in the package and the brim is nearly vertically down it doesn't stick out forward at all. See photos.
2.0,made weird the pockets are not
2.0,"I ordered a small. The bag listed small, but the dress was labeled XL and fit as if it was. Tried a return and the same issue occurred. Beautiful color, but was also cut lower than expected with holes in the waist as well. Overall, it’s okay, but I would not recommend"
2.0,Tiny but nice quality.
2.0,Product arrived and package was damaged and opened. Watch band had scratches on it and required assembly. Disappointed in the quality.
2.0,Definitely more of a peach. Shorter than it looks but big in the shoulders.
2.0,"I bought this bathing suit to swim at the gym.  I'm very tall and always wear a large.  The bathing suit seemed a little large, but I thought it would be ok.  When I got into the pool, the bottoms nearly fell off and the top kept floating up.  Thank goodness I wasn't at the beach.  The top is also poorly made in the bust area.  I would not recommend this suit."
2.0,Return it back
2.0,After the first wash it lost it shape.
2.0,You can check the pictures
2.0,"Los lentes excelentes, lo malo fue que duro demasiado para el envío"
2.0,"The description of the product stated knit cuff, but when I got the jacket, it was regular with buttons. Either change the description to what you are selling or ship the correct product."
2.0,just didnt like
2.0,The look of them is cool but after like one time of putting them in and taking them out the part of the needle that’s supposed to click into the hoop stopped clicking. The needle just meets the hoop now and doesn’t stay in
2.0,Try something else. There are more sparkly ones out there.
2.0,Over rated
2.0,The sleeves are too tight.
2.0,I was very excited to purchase this since I have a slew of Ridgid tools.  Bought with the intention to use to keep warm while hunting.  Took a trip to PGH and wore it hunting to only find that the heater started to intermittently work.  The button showed it running but no heat being generated and when it did work it stopped heating on the front coils.  The other think I found is that the jacket runs slightly larger than others so be aware.<br />I submitted for return on 12/3 not realizing that had only 5 days to get to a UPS store to drop off the product and can't seem to get in touch with the seller to see if I can still return or exchange.
2.0,"It was a little smaller than I anticipated and the material was really heavy, but I plan to keep it and wear it in the colder months."
2.0,style is cute- fit is not.  The material is very very thin and not attractive unless you are maybe a size 2.  I am a size 8-10 and they look awful.  Will be returning.
2.0,"I ordered two pairs, but this pair pictured is defective. One of the straps is significantly longer than the other, looks funny/won’t strap to my sons foot as well."
2.0,If you want to loom like a fly... These are the glasses for you.  Maybe Halloween :)  fit good
2.0,It’s cute but the material is so cheap that it attracts all pieces of lint and hair that you never knew even existed. I cannot wear it and ended up throwing it in the trash. Very poor quality.
2.0,"I bought these because I wanted warm fleece lined leggings to layer with in the cool months. Not only do these leggings lack the advertised fleece fabric, they also have a very thin piece of fabric on the legs to allow for more air flow...which just makes me more uncomfortable and cold."
2.0,Looks great no where near correct sizing for fit
2.0,Very small and cheap. I should have read the reviews. I bought this for my six year old but even to little for her. Feathers fall put everywhere and the wings come packaged separately and say devil wings on them. If you're looking for a cheap prop for a baby photoshoot I guess it would work.
2.0,"Would have given it 5 stars but I was way way to small. I’m 5’10” and usually wear a 16-18/XL/1X so I thought I would be safe ordering a 2X. I took this out of the package and could tell right away there was no way it was going to fit. I have a daughter who is 5’2”/103lbs and it fit her perfectly. I was so disappointed because the material was soft the color was gorgeous and it looked so pretty, on my daughter, that’s 1 Star.  I returned it which was super easy and got my money back super quick so there’s star #2. Disappointing to say the least"
2.0,"The bars are definitely 16G, not the 14G it was advertising. Not impressed; I can't even use them."
2.0,Poor quality and drape
2.0,Was not what expected.
2.0,had to walk from gravel driveway to grass and that must have broken down the plastic since halfway through the party the grass walkers had broken and slid up the spike of my heels!
2.0,The gloves help slightly but do not last well. The cooper that is woven into the gloves comes off easily
2.0,These are very small for a little girl.  But ok for the price.
2.0,The straps keep popping off. The back band is not 36 and would not fit if it wasn’t for the included extender.
2.0,I wanted to use them for working out but they're a little too small
2.0,Might wanna go up a size . Top part is way to small
2.0,"Love the material but I got an xs fit like a small. I'm 5'7"" 118 lbs. With the price I'll keep the but just for lounging around the house not exactly what I bought the for."
2.0,I was under the impression that these were Rago shape wear and  they're not so I gave them to my sister.
2.0,I have to return this product due to The material being thin. You can see skin right though it.
2.0,"String is too small to really even wrap around more than once. Somewhat disappointing, but the price is cheap so it was expected."
2.0,I’m at a conference right now and I’m constantly having to reach down and resecure this damn belt.
2.0,they where what i wanted but the post was broken off the one earring
2.0,The sunglasses have good lenses but most everything else leaves a bit to be desired. The plastic the frame is made up of is not great and there is very little that keeps them in place.
2.0,They seemed to be decent quality but they didn't fit.
2.0,Was good for one use. The color changed quickly. The idea was good but the materials were poor.
2.0,The top is a bit small and the pants are too large.
2.0,Way to big to be called earrings
2.0,sent back because a stone was missing
2.0,ripped easily
2.0,Totally see through in the back! If I bend over you can see my whole behind. Also the lace sticks together and causes the leg to ride up on the side. Would not purchase again.
2.0,They look nice but after one use the sems started to separate!
2.0,"Nice & large enough to hold multiple passports,  but zipper broke during 1st use."
2.0,lasted 4 days
2.0,Very disappointed. NOT OFF THE SHOULDER. I ordered grey....it was a purplish-blue hue.
2.0,Legs were right length but length from crotch to waist was too long.  The result was that the legs were 3&#34; too long. I also found that the legs were too wide.  I liked the material and the looks but they just didn't fit me.  I returned them.
2.0,"This is a cute watch band. It looked great with my watch, however it would not stay tightened where I needed it to. Every time I went to put it on it would stretch bigger and it was hard to adjust once it was on my wrist. I don’t know. Maybe it was just me, but it’s cute!"
2.0,The material is not appropriate for intended use as a COVID mask
2.0,the leather strap was cracked when I got it
2.0,We're good at first but all but destroyed I'd 10 days of use
2.0,"The jumpsuit is super cute and super flattering. Although, the lighter colors are see-through."
2.0,These shower sandals seem well made and sturdy for the price.  Size was as expected and delivery through Amazon was very quick.  Unfortunately the post that goes between the toes was very uncomfortable for both my feet and I returned these.
2.0,"These are cute, but they don't keep time. I set them all, and by the end of the week they all dislayed drastically different times."
2.0,"Be careful. They say the size is 58cm, but the one I received seems smaller and doesn't fit. The cost of returning is about $17; so, doesn't make sense to me to pay that much to return."
2.0,It's small. I'm about a size 12 and it just fits; if I were bigger it wouldn't work.
2.0,I thought this was way to wide for a headband.  My daughter wears it though and loves it.  It covers her ears and keeps her warm...but whoa the static. Lol
2.0,"I'm 5-6 130 pounds and a large fits me like a wetsuit.  The fabric is gross, cheap and clingy, I can't even imagine wearing these in warm weather."
2.0,"Sadly, Today is the first day I have worn them, although very slightly snug, not uncomfortable, they already have a whole in the crotch and the seams are coming undone."
2.0,Fits rather small. Good luck finding bottoms that go with it mine were missing!
2.0,The yellow color is not at all what is represented in the ad on the website.  They are such a pale yellow as to be almost clear.
2.0,Veil is no bigger than the bow! Will return for another one.
2.0,This fabric is awful and it is not sewn very even. The neck line is different then pictured.
2.0,"The color has already started to fade away, I've got white spots on part of it"
2.0,Color scheme is off not like the picture very bright and they run big not as cute as pictured
2.0,Completely fell apart. My son wore 1 time to school before the top separated.  Looked terrific in the package but sadly didn't even make it to a single wash.
2.0,"I purchased this blouse, based on other positive reviews.  I don't know what I was excpecting, but I am not impressed.<br />It is cheaply made, and doesn't hang well.  Not crazy about the shoulders either.  I waited too long to return, so now<br />I'm stuck with it.  Hoping my daughter might get some use out of it, as it is too snug on me.  I purchased an up-size<br />due to previous reviews, but it was still too snug.  Oh well.  Better luck next time!"
2.0,Fit as expected. The material was of  very low quality.
2.0,Very pretty. I ordered two and since it was rolled and both put in a little bag for shipping. One of the rings was broken off the chain.. So now the set is worthless but very pretty if it was shipped better!!!! Not worth sending back
2.0,"The sleeves are crazy long but fits everywhere else. And by crazy long, almost a foot to long past his hands."
2.0,Not what I wanted.  Not enough thickness for me.
2.0,"Love the shirt, but I ordered a large and it looks like it would fit a 14 year old"
2.0,Did not like because the sil material was too hard to tie and slipped off too easily
2.0,"A little small on the feet, but the tightening above the knee sucks. It is constantly falling and there is no support in the shoe. Your feet will be sore after five minutes in these bad boys."
2.0,I was pretty disappointed by these shorts...they appear to be lightweight and have a relaxed fit in the pictures.  This was not what I got when they arrived.  They were way too tight (even ordering according to the size chart) and not flattering at all.
2.0,Cheaply made starts raveling after 1st wash
2.0,"The quality of this shirt is somewhat thin, does not feel like 100% cotton."
2.0,"bought two pair, the packaging is awful. bought pair received bent at the prong. tried to fix one pair but it broke. the metal is very thin"
2.0,"I actually like these bras, however, the bra that arrived was about 4 sizes off from what I ordered.  I compared it to bras I have on hand just to be sure.  The difference was huge. I am afraid to order another one. I don't know if it was simply mislabeled or if they run that small.  I am a 36B.  My granddaughter is a 32B.  It is tight on my granddaughter.  Do they run small?"
2.0,It looks really nice but there is 6 slash marks in each number so that's odd. Also it freezes all the time so.
2.0,"This is very cheaply made and very small. Every time I've bought clothes off of amazon, I have run into these two problems. I think I'll just stop buying clothes from amazon."
2.0,The diamond was so small almost thought it was missing. The black wore off quick but was a sturdy ring.
2.0,Un poco corto la talla xl
2.0,Too small and wrong color
2.0,Fell apart when I first held it up. Luckily I had a jump ring to fix it. My daughter loves these.
2.0,The belt appears very nice.  It was easy to adjust the size of the belt to fit. The appearance is full grain leather but it is oddly stretchy. While cutting the belt to the correct size I noticed that the outer most layer is synthetic material. I wanted a full grain leather belt and thus is not.  The belt does look nice but after a month of gentle use the black has chipped off on the outer most layer. Also the belt loop is not attached and falls off the belt without being very careful.  I imagine i will lose it soon.
2.0,Really liked the bracelet when it arrived. Only wore it a couple of hours a day for about a week when it just fell apart when I was walking down the hall. Never got it wet and it wasn't pulled on or anything like that. I was wearing a long sleeve sweater at the time that was covering the bracelet. The embroidery thread that was used to make it broke (defective? cheap? don't know) and the beads rolled everywhere. Buy something that will last more than a week!
2.0,Was supposed to be a gift for 1year old granddaughter (First Birthday) Does not look like it would even fit a 6 month old. Trying it on this week. May have to send it back )>:
2.0,Made for extra curvy
2.0,Odd-fitting POLYESTER top MADE IN CHINA. Tight in the arms. Too big otherwise.
2.0,"I normally wear a large, however after reading the comments I ordered an XXL which was still too small."
2.0,"way too big-it is cute, but should be more adjustable"
2.0,The picture is really cute but the actual cardigan is super short. Kinda disappointed.
2.0,"I bought a pair of shorts from this company, and they fit lovely and I continue to wear them on a regular basis. I decided to buy new capris in the SAME SIZE as the shorts and they're too small! Also, these &#34;capris&#34; wear long enough to be pants on me. Returning them."
2.0,not meant for women with big boobs:(
2.0,Kinda small & not stretchy
2.0,Hate the fabric. Seller would not take it back for refund or even credit toward something else. Not happy at all about it.
2.0,"Very cheap material, fabric"
2.0,They were too long for a capri pant
2.0,Orders this swimsuit was very disappointed because I did measure myself and compared it to the size chart and when it arrive it was falling off
2.0,I THOUGHT THIS WAS GREAT BUT HAND STRAP BROKE RIGHT AWAY.
2.0,Legs were far too short. V-neck too low. Returned
2.0,The neck line Is very high cut and the description doesn’t really explain that. I bought for exercise but had to return due to the neck making me claustrophobic
2.0,Short fits to tight and they don't have pockets
2.0,"Love the looks, but ahain same size i always by and it runs small"
2.0,"This is a poor product. Caused my camera's LCD cracking at the force needed to ""smooth out"" bubbles and to make it adhere properly. Cost me over $ 300 to fix my camera's LCD that needed to be replaced brand new..."
2.0,comfy and good length. Not thick material but after 2 washes the shorts unraveled pretty bad.
2.0,the fabric was thinner than I expected
2.0,Loved that it was two-sided. It had the stones on both sides. But was disappointed that I only had it for 3 days and it broke.
2.0,Hat came folded in half.. brim look like crap.. little cheap looking for the price
2.0,Pretty and seems to be decent quality but it’s way bigger than you would think. I bought it for my tragus and it covered that entire part of my ear and then some. Prolly the size of a dime roughly.
2.0,The pants were not true to size so we had to send back.
2.0,"A soft, cozy comfy and WARM shirt that developed two holes in the back after I wore it 4 times and washed it once per their directions (gentle, flat dry). Returned it."
2.0,"Not the material in the picture, it's a looser thermal material..I got this color & the maroon, which was not true to the maroon color..shoulder holes are larger than expected, material not as tight as expected"
2.0,I worn this product one time which was today and the pics attached is the end result. The boning around the back and sides are coming out after a 1 workout. i haven’t detached the tags because i didn’t have  scissors. I’m not happy about this at all
2.0,"Very cute dress, unfortunately it the small was way too large for my daughter. Will have to return it."
2.0,"I'm 5'5"" 230lbs 40D and pear shaped. This is not only see through but clingy and the seam is like mid torso into stomach. Even if you wear similar colors to the dress if you got a booty, the dress clings to undies. (even thong) and the top is a little too tight in boob region"
2.0,"Bought it for my 10 year old daughter, as she loves Stranger Things.  The sizing in the description says would fit a child.  It was way too big even for me!"
2.0,"The deer head broke off a day after I had it. its really pretty though. But horrible quality, please fix"
2.0,[[VIDEOID:121a6e8e2a841840e92063bf8bf1489]] The lack of quality is visible. I’m pretty sure my 5 year old granddaughter could’ve made these with her bead and jewelry maker.
2.0,"Just doesn't look right.  Perhaps I don't know how to walk right to make it look like I'm actually on the shoulders of a very short gorilla.  Also, the material is very hot.  Perhaps ok for a Halloween fall night, but very uncomfortable in the summer.  The fit is really tight and I'm fairly average (5'10 170 lbs).  If I had an extra 10-15 lbs, I don't think I could fit in this thing.  So let's review - doesn't look good, doesn't feel good, doesn't fit well."
2.0,This dress is way oversized. I ordered a small and it was still way too big. I am 5'2&#34; and wear a 6 pant and small to medium top. I also wasn't too impressed with the material in terms of appearance. The color was very accurate and the design idea is cute but it wasn't up to my standards. I ended up giving it away.
2.0,"I am 5'3"", small chested and these are almost like tank tops they are so narrow.  SUPER thin material.  No impressed."
2.0,love the design. Unfortunately shrank significantly on first wash - and shrank further on second -  despite delicate wash setting. So these no longer work.
2.0,"Dress is very cute. WAY low cut, if you’re not into that, you’ll have to wear a tank top underneath. Kinda loses its color and design when stretches. Wouldn’t buy again, will only wear for Halloween at night, so you can’t really see the the discoloration when stretched."
2.0,They came in bent up due to packaging.  Poor quality and after wasting twice they are peeling.
2.0,Look cheap.. I have to return
2.0,ended up sending back. not flattering and tight in the arms.
2.0,"I used this bag for the first time today.  It's a nice compact bag, but the waterproof section isn't waterproof, I wouldn't even say it's water resistant.  I wrung out my bathing trunks pretty well and placed them inside the waterproof lined section.  By the time I got home, the whole bottom of the bag was wet...more than just damp.  I like the bag, but my trunks will be going into a Zip-Loc from now on."
2.0,"I liked them until I started walking, the pants just  kept riding up. Not very pleasant."
2.0,I have only had this bracelet for about a week and it is already fraying. I have other similar bracelets that cost less that are better quality. I would not recommend.
2.0,"One connector came missing a pin, one had bent pins, and one was molded improperly so as not to have the proper pin length."
2.0,Too expensive for simple blue socks.  Nothing special about them.
2.0,"A little big based off measurements, and the elbow patch wasn’t sewn all the way around, I am going to return."
2.0,Overall it's decent but for the price I don't want to struggle for five minutes each time with the zipper.
2.0,A little wider than i expected  they are cute
2.0,"Pants were very soft and comfortable, but the fabric shredded in the side seem after two or three washes. They're no longer wearable and the shredding is so bad it's not fixable."
2.0,"I purchased two pairs of these shades and I liked them. Unfortunately, the first pair broke when I tried to pull them off my head. The arms were under my wool cap which was over my ears and one of the arms stayed right on top of my ear and pulled completely away from the frame."
2.0,"Single Watch Winder With Japanese Mabuchi Motor<br />Sold by: Watch Winder Boxes<br />Shipped: Aug 25, 2014<br />Quantity: 1<br />This item is no longer eligible for return.<br />The return window closed on Sep 27, 2014."
2.0,The replacement met size requirements and delivery was good; but the color faded to pink within 3 weeks in the Florida sun
2.0,"Ascot Tie was advertised as 50"" long<br /> When delivered it was merely 45"" long? Quality and Design is satisfactory...but Tie is more suitable for a kid with a small neck."
2.0,Beautiful dress and fabric and the color was perfect<br />Still waiting on refund
2.0,"Very cheap looking. Terrible quality, returned product."
2.0,Broke immediately and color faded fast. I should have listened to the other reviews.
2.0,"I like the comfort and slimming ability but the top does roll down and bunches up at the top of my slacks.they require adjusting several times a day. All in all, not worth the price or frustration."
2.0,Great shirt. The the material is great but I wear a XL so that's what I ordered and it fits like a 3X. My Husband wears an XL as well and it was very large on him as well.
2.0,I felt disappointed about the product.
2.0,The picture does not accurately represent the product.  It is not flowy nor is the ruffle full like the pic.... kinda cheap
2.0,Very cute sneakers and the light up feature works well but the blue outer material started to peel off within a month of wearing these. My daughter still likes them but they look worn and &#34;old&#34; after just three months of average use.
2.0,These fit on the small side and they were thin the first pair I put on they ran like a pair of nylons.
2.0,after first ride with these they started to come apart at the seems
2.0,"I wear a 38C in VS bras, and i ordered the larger size, the imprint of this was very obvious and i couldn’t lift it up much or it’d lose its hold"
2.0,It held my Gun but I lost my extra clip while hunting really pisted me off now I have to go and buy me another clip
2.0,Not great... Stained and cheap.
2.0,"Love the fit of these, but they do not last  through washing and the straps broke before a washing."
2.0,"I would have returned this but just missed Amazon's return window. Sigh. I get that this is a swing dress, but that still suggests some fit at the top. I bought an XS (I'm usually an XM or a S), and this is like a sack. Material is soft and colors are true to the picture."
2.0,"I returned this item because it just wasn't a flattering fit.  Because the neck is a V, both front and back, I couldn't get it to hang right."
2.0,This dress was uncomfortable for all of us. We got dressed right before the wedding and on the way to the aisle we were all saying I can’t wait to get it off.
2.0,"Pretty, but broken. I have to reglue it."
2.0,"The pendant shipped well and the energies are good. Its sturdy and seems like it will be a while before I need t worry about it breaking; however, I realized post purchase (my own stupidity), that it doesn't fully spell out abracadabra, it is missing several rows of letters.<br /><br />The design is nice and I plan to keep it. Its about the size of a US nickel."
2.0,"Too big for my nose, the ends didn't line up either. One was longer and it looked ridiculous. I threw it away."
2.0,"This was a bit of a disappointment as I found the materials to be cheap looking and had a hard time with it staying on. Sadly, I had to send it back."
2.0,"Bought Sep 2021, by Mar 2022 both pairs have broke.  Good while they lasted."
2.0,It was tarnished and dull. I thought at least for sterling it would be polished and clean....Disapointed.
2.0,"Sweater is bulkier than it seems in the picture, also an off color grey. It has become something more for wearing around the house than wearing out."
2.0,"Feels and looks cheap, although width is good"
2.0,"The material is cheaply made, do not waste your money."
2.0,Was too small for my wait. BUT the seller accepted a refund so its all good.
2.0,Nice slippers but left shoe fits funny like not supported. I returned them.
2.0,"The skirt was shorter than the shorts, looked weird, but not all that bad for the price."
2.0,Bought these and they were not of the quality you would expect for the price.
2.0,Looks like a pack of bullfrog not what picture looked like
2.0,Seems new but there were little cracks in the seams
2.0,"I've had my belly button pierced for 10 years without any irritation, but this plastic immediately irritated everything."
2.0,"every tassel needed fixing, they were all over the place, fringe was totally folded, wrinkled, and tho' the offer was a good one for the money, the smaller ones, looked dirty or just disheveled to the point of unusable, the longer ones were nice, had they not been ruined by being bent, and going in all different directions, the blue ball pair , and burgundy pair (long) were just ok, who wants to iron, or go to that much trouble to fix?. the only thing I like was I can take the tassel off and make some other earring out of the blank. I have no experience with tassel, but I wasn't fond of these, they were mushed, crushed, and smashed."
2.0,"These were not true to size i ordered a 2x and I would have needed a larger size if I wanted to breath, like wearing a spanx, not comfy work out pants"
2.0,I'm sending these back ASAP - These jeans had someone else's used lip gloss in the front right pocket and the tags were in the rear back pocket. WTH? I'm paying for NEW jeans not USED.  Do better. With that being said - they fit great and I'm hoping to reorder and receive a NEW pair!
2.0,"Meh, cheap materials, cheap product but fun for Halloween I suppose."
2.0,"WHATEVER METAL THESE ARE MADE OUT OF, GIVE ME AN INFECTION IN MY EAR PIERCING. CANNOT WEAR THEM, SUPER CUTE, BUT HAD TO THROW THEM AWAY! (AND IVE HAD PIERCED EARS FOR 40 YEARS! NO PROBLEMS!)"
2.0,They go rusty right away. Very disappointed to have bought this.
2.0,Cute but way bigger than expected
2.0,"It's cheap. I mean, what do we expect, right? for this price? I have purchased necklaces from Amazon in this price range before, however, and they didn't look as cheap as this one did. I don't see myself keep this."
2.0,There is not enough room to fill all pockets and still be able to easily remove cards when needed. Disappointed.
2.0,"I liked the fabric even though it fit better than expected. I washed it once, and now it's covered in black spots, unlike the other clothes in the same washer."
2.0,Honestly..was not what I expected
2.0,Wore one pair over night and woke in the morning to find the sewn together panels had become unstiched. First time wearing the product after washing it once of course. Always wash new clothes before I put them on. Very disappointing.
2.0,Low Quality of material
2.0,A large is not a large it fit like a small
2.0,"I love hue leggings and jeggings, this pair i love the color but they were defeated, but Amazon refunded my account, so I will be ordering them again.They fit to size ."
2.0,"too tight and clingy. For anyone with a bulge, it highlights the fat."
2.0,Posts were cheap and bent upon arrival. Color isn’t as vibrant in person. I’ll be sending back.
2.0,"The blue color pictured is accurate, and it appears to be well made. It fits nothing like the picture. It's tube shaped like a long tank top, small for the measurements in the size chart so it's tight from top to bottom, with no flare to the skirt like the picture at all."
2.0,The pendant is not truly &#34;kiss&#34;ed shaped. Kind of disappointed.
2.0,"So, I am short and small... 5’ 3”, 110#, and this suit is too short. The top cut into my shoulders and the leg elastic left red marks it was so tight. It just isn’t cut properly. On the upside, the cup support is great and the back is full coverage. Win some, lose some. This one is going back."
2.0,Too small. Had to return.
2.0,Not worth the money .
2.0,"Design is only on front of earring, but backside shows so it’s very unappealing look. Also very difficult to secure closure."
2.0,Doesnt stay on
2.0,"I bought this in an 18 month size, it's too large for my 3 year old."
2.0,On one of the earrings the post was bent.
2.0,Please be very careful before ordering this item if you are woman. They run very large and a good fit moreso for a man. Disappointed. 😣
2.0,"Ugh everything about this jumpsuit was perfect BUT there were makeup stains(smh, must have been a return or someone wore prior :/)  on the straps and the zipper was broken. I was super salty, as I ordered this to wear to an event and received it the day before. There was no way to have stain removed or zipper repaired so I ended up returning. I'm really disappointed because the jumpsuit was so glam"
2.0,"I was really looking forward to this bracelet! as someone with a metal allergy, finding beautiful metal free jewelry that doesn't look cheesy is difficult. This bracelet really looked like a home run!<br />So here are the pros and cons:<br />Pro:<br />1- very beautiful and neutral colored<br />2- looks just like photo<br />3- The only metal is the metal washer/&#34;button&#34; to close it. great if you have an allergy<br />Con:<br />1- Very strong smell! (underlined and italicized). I suspect it is the pearls as some of them have green stuff adhered to them. I'm not sure how to clean them without ruining the leather...<br />2- the bracelet is either painfully tight or too loose<br />3- several of the pearls appear to have cracks and i'm worried they will fall off after a few times wearing it.<br /><br />Update: a jewelry expert told me this smell was moldy leather and unfixable. :("
2.0,"Great mask, but no good based on scientific data which at one point did not offer an opinion and now says the masks are not good to be worn in public.  So much for scientific data or a rather scientific opinion not based on science but opinion."
2.0,Most jackets have adjustable cuffs this one does not so the arms just hang out too long
2.0,"Suit is cute but not made for the flat chested. It’s was literally all big cups and looked awkward and too much space, but I could see it being good for those that have big bust."
2.0,This is not the correct sign for “B”.
2.0,Why is the crotch in these pants so low??Was MC Hammer the inspiration for these?
2.0,Impossible to open the casing. Used the included screw driver which only wore out the screw. Tried 2 other screw drivers with no luck. 2 of the buttons for the chips keep getting stuck so I cant program the light pattern I want. The lights look amazing if only I could customize it. The string tension is also smooth but wont matter if the batteries die and I cant change it.
2.0,Dress is beautiful was so excited to wear it but the zipper is defective and wouldn’t zip up
2.0,This is made of cotton not really got for a formal occasion. It also runs big.
2.0,very cheaply made.  I gave it away bc I couldn't stand the cheap material
2.0,Socks faded after wearing them for 2 hours.
2.0,Disappointed.  Paint and glue are everywhere!! Very  noticeable. My 3 year old could have put this together better.  I plan on gluing rhinestones where all the glue has bled through.
2.0,It’s literally a cheap cheap cheap tshirt and barely has the scissor made slits.
2.0,The tail busted off the day after I got it...
2.0,"The picture for the item I purchased showed a ball chain, recieved a link chain that doesn't look as cute. Some of the other colors have the link chain, but not the one I ordered. The company needs to fix the pictures to match what you actually get."
2.0,I love the idea of this fin but unfortunately it does not stay on feet. My daughter who is 7 in shoe size 2-3 was constantly getting frustrated because the strap would fall off and hurt her ankles. It's worth the money to order from finfun.
2.0,enormous  -  make sure you order 1 or 2 sizes smaller than you normally wear
2.0,"What came is not what's pictured. It's still cute but it's an open back halter top.... Runs a little small, too."
2.0,"I hated this :( it fit much to small, which made it unbearably uncomfortable. I gave it to my little sister who it fit on, and she was not a big fan either. Neither one of us would recommend it."
2.0,Said it fit my watch brand (Garmin) but it did not.
2.0,The bottom piece fell off within days of wear. It's cute but severely lacking in quality.
2.0,Cheaply made. Very disappointed
2.0,"Way too stiff trying to put on one arm,keep good time. It took way to long to get to my address."
2.0,Bought it for an adult. It's rather cheap looking & very hard to read. Maybe ok for a child.
2.0,I wear a size 9 shoe the tag said fits 9 to 10 shoe size. I recommend going larger. The slippers feel as if they are an 8 1/2.
2.0,Comfortable material but it stretches in the wash and the length shortens. I used cold water and hung them dry. Once they're floods I don't wear them anymore.
2.0,"I received a damaged item. Cute, but damaged. It was also made in another country other than Africa so it did not feel/look traditional."
2.0,Belt broke last week when trying to rotate the buckle to the other side.  It was also ungodly hard leather and was painful to wear if I was going to be sitting for an extended period of time.  I like Wolverine as a brand.  This was a cool belt.  But such a let down in the end.
2.0,While I'm excited about the colors and the fact that they arrived in a timely fashion. I am disappointed that one of the watches is cracked. If I didn't need to use one tomorrow for school I'd be sending them all back.
2.0,Back of band is already discolored and its only been two weeks. Disappointed some times the latches pop even though i wear it a little loose. Not worth it it my opinion.
2.0,Loved it very lightweight and breathable BUT the 3rd time i put it on the earpiece come off from one of the stitching so it was unwearable
2.0,makes the shoes feel too tight
2.0,Dislike not true to size! Purchased for my daughter wears a small or a size 4 !  Size is way off!
2.0,It turned me green on no time!
2.0,"It broke in less than 6 months. Sent my watch falling onto the asphalt. Before it broke though, it worked fine."
2.0,"The aesthetic is what I was looking for, however they came in with bent posts."
2.0,"This item runs way to small, sad that u need a 4x or 5x if you wear an xl. I was very disappointed."
2.0,"Very disappointed, very thin, grip bottom does not grip and they are small.  I should have believed previous reviews."
2.0,"Its doesn't really look like the pic. They said it run small so I got a large BT I am a,medium so it doesn't fit right. It's baggy in the front mid section."
2.0,"I ordered this ring and i wear a size 7 on my ring finger. This ring came in as a size 5. It fits my pinky ring, very disappointed. Hopefully my little sister can ware is someday. But besides all that its a really pretty ring, its just the size."
2.0,Terrible fit and comes all kink led in a mess
2.0,very stiff material
2.0,"NOT KIDS SIZE!!! Got a 7/8 for my child, and they are like a size 6-8 adult pants in women's."
2.0,Got extra large and they feel like medium because they are so tight. Would never get them again.
2.0,Great ring…Did not come with display box as pictured.  They stuffed it into a too small ring box with no cushioning (See pictures) I was lucky the ring was okay. JJL 😠
2.0,"I'll take part of the responsibility......I should have cafefully read the print, but who would have thought this price was per bead.  $2.65 PER BEAD.  100Silver.com ......the company name.....made me think I was getting 100 beads for $2.65.  It's just a very misleading name & I should have verified  before ordering."
2.0,"I’m 5’6 and normally wear either a small or medium. I ordered a small, and despite sizing down found the fit on this cardigan roomy. I’d have to agree with the other reviewers that this thing looks like a lab coat.  I wouldn’t go so far to say that it’s UNflattering, but it’s not doing anyone any favors.<br />Also not thrilled with the color.  I ordered beige, and was hoping for the soft, deep off-white that’s shown.  Mine has distinct yellow tint to it.  In bad lighting it looks almost dingy. Giving it two stars because the construction of it seems solid so far, and it is comfortable.  I’m not going through the hassle of returning; I got it cheap, and it’ll do for wearing around the house.  If I had paid much more for it I’d be sending it back."
2.0,Lol can’t even see the image
2.0,"It was ok for a basic t, but nothing special."
2.0,This does not open. My son went to open it and sprinkle some to “fly” and it broke. It’s also super tiny
2.0,Very poor quality. Very thin leather and no lining inside. Would tear easily after a short while. The strap for the crossbody is not so sturdy. Nice to look at but not so durable.
2.0,color is not the same as on the website ... much lighter blue
2.0,"Ok, the dress that I received was not exactly the dress I received. The tie is right under my breast—NO! The sleeves are 3/4. There is one thing I never understood is WHY 3/4 sleeves? Either long or short. The 2 of the 3 things that encouraged me to purchase are a big NO. The material is very nice. Soft, not scratchy and not thin also the stitching is very very good. I think I got 1 that should have fell in reject bin. It’s a RETURN for me🤦🏽‍♀️"
2.0,They look like they do online in person
2.0,I purchased a pair of Secret Treasures pj's last summer and loved them.  I then purchased 2 pair of winter pj's.  So I was looking for another pair of summer pj's and ordered these.  They are no where close to the quality and fit of the ones I ordered last summer.  Very disappointed.
2.0,These earrings are very nice to look at but they are poorly made.  I had to use additional force to pry them open and then the wing to snap them into was way to tight.  I would not recommend anyone buy these as their manufacturing process is flawed.
2.0,Too small<br />Material thin & cheep
2.0,The material is cheat but the dress was cheap so you get what you pay for with this item. It served its purpose and I looked cute.
2.0,Very cheap material.  Was pilling after I'd worn it 6 hours.
2.0,"Although this bag can hold a lot, it's cheaply made. The color is worn and the zipper broke almost immediately. It's really not worth more than 10 bucks."
2.0,"I ordered this Kezef Creations bracelet along with the Amazon Collection one to compare [[ASIN:B009OYO5R2 Platinum Plated Sterling Silver Round Cut 4mm Cubic Zirconia Tennis Bracelet, 7&#34;]].<br /><br />It's not even close: the quality of the Amazon Collection one is fantastic; it's a beautiful bracelet that feels and looks significantly more expensive than its actual price ($50).<br /><br />This bracelet, however, is not good. The CZ stones are nice and I didn't see any flaws with them. But the actual metal bracelet is clearly mediocre quality and construction, you can see imperfections in the form of the bracelet. Low tolerances evident of an inexpensive product. The clasp is the worst part - it only secures via the two security loops, missing the latch mechanism that is present on the Amazon Collection bracelet. But most importantly, the two loops are extremely flimsy and cheap, and when I received the bracelet they both dangled at odd angles and only one would actually stay attached to the post on the other end of the bracelet. I would not trust this clasp at all.<br /><br />This bracelet also comes in a cheap plastic baggy that looks straight from China, whereas the Amazon Collection one comes in a quite nice jewelry box, inside another nice black box.<br /><br />At $20 or so, I wouldn't rate this bracelet so poorly, but I paid $80 for this bracelet. Definitely overpriced. I returned it for a full refund."
2.0,Run little small
2.0,Top of slipper not smooth leather as in previous  Tamarac slippers I’ve purchased.  Will cause slippers to stain easily & be more difficult to clean.<br />Very dissatisfied !
2.0,This dress has a foul smell it Smelled like fish
2.0,Runs very big & looked like pajamas. Not worth the money. Cheaper optikns kn department stores
2.0,"the bag is smaller than it looked. when you say faux leather, it really is faux leather and it looks  like it"
2.0,It's not pink. it's beige.
2.0,"Once you get this on, it’s great but it is so difficult to get on and off and I threw mine away after wearing it several times"
2.0,"I don't know how this UOVO Boys Shoe got such a high rating. My 6yr old wore the ""Black/Orange5"" one for only one day, and the orange plastic pieces at the bottom of the soles are falling off. See the photo attached! I glued half of them back on, but two pieces are already missing."
2.0,"Small and compact, this wallet lives up to its description as being ""blocking anti-theft"". Problem is, the ""anti-theft"" technology is to keep the wallet tight, presumably to prevent fingers from extracting a credit card or two. The unfortunate result is that it also prevents the owner from extracting cards. Card slots are way too tight for everyday usage. Compounding this is the small number of slots which forces multi-card slot utilization and event tighter card holding. Side benefit is reduced number of times one wants to wrestle with card extraction means less spending!"
2.0,I ordered size XL thinking they would be a lil big but at least not too snug. These are small! I have small but stubby hands. Im going to try and stretch them out. They do have an odor to them if you smell close up.
2.0,It said 2pk and I only received one.  Also there was not a pump with it.
2.0,NOT SILK. FALSE ADVERTISING.
2.0,"Not sized as stated. Had to sand it down quite a lot in order to fit. Much lighter in color than pictured. If you apply oil, it might be dark as pictured."
2.0,"Looked exactly as pictured,  however wad Brown during shipping,  post was broken off so I sint know if it was comfortable or not."
2.0,"These are really pretty, but look obviously fake. Way too clear and shiny."
2.0,"I bought two sizes up after reading other reviews for how small this was, and the shirt barely fit me. It was big enough for me to button, but the buttons wouldn't snap in! I had to use safety pins to close the shirt. Needed it for a Halloween costume so thankfully I won't need to wear it again. Waste of money unfortunately :("
2.0,Looks really strange the way it ties up on the one side. It pulls the other side so much that it looks lopsided.
2.0,"(To be fair, I am wearing a sports bra) but the fit is NOTHING like the picture. The waist is significantly higher. (Which is saying something, because I have a fairly high waist). I got my normal size. (A small, which is supposed to be 4/6) and it feels a lot more like a 6 or something. Not form fitting.<br /><br />The only reason I’m giving it 2 stars is because it’s well made."
2.0,"Not supportive, feels like cheap hoses"
2.0,It is a cute dress but the back is shorter than the front (not evenly cut).  Clearly no quality control
2.0,On description it says up to 48&#34; but it is way shorter than that
2.0,These dress was made of a cheap material and was too large at the bust for the size.  It just looked cheap but I guess you get what you pay for.  I would recommend for a simple evening party but not for a formal occasion.
2.0,"This medallion  looks very nice, unfortunately the metal buckle arrived snapped in half, rendering the item not useful."
2.0,"The unit is very tight and doesn't fit well on my head, even my daughter finds it too tight. It also has a lot of trouble staying connected."
2.0,Cute but cheaply made.  Chain broke after 5 minutes of wear  Flea market type jewelry+
2.0,Cute and surprised by how comfortable. The problem is that after wearing 3 times the heal is separated from the back.
2.0,"I bought the tortoise gt sunglasses and after having them for a few weeks, I am very disappointed. At opening, I was very excited because they looked great and the metal piece holding the lenses seemed reliable. I noticed some lines across some parts of the plastic frame, but I didn't think much about them. In less than two weeks, one of the legs of the frame broke off! I didn't even apply much pressure. I placed it on top of my head, and while I lifted it off, it just fell apart. I wanted these to be sunglasses I didn't have to be worried about breaking but something that could hold up during the summer. These weren't it."
2.0,I fly fairly often and was looking for a larger shoulder bag to carry  essentials for longer flights. The picture gives the impression that this is made from a somewhat softer PU leather but able to stand upright. Wrong on both accounts. The material is very stiff. The bag was folded flat for shipping  creating a crease on the base which prevents it from standing up. All my attempts to even it out have been unsuccessful so far. The front zipper was already broken and the one on top difficult to operate. It is a nice looking bag but poorly made. Would not recommend it.
2.0,Not what I expected.  I didn't realize the material would have a shine to it.  There was also a smell when I took it out of the zip loc baggy it was in.  I immediately had to wash it.  I guess the lesson would be &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34;
2.0,"Sizes run extremely small, had to gift it."
2.0,gatta lose at least 10lbs to get in this dress! :-(
2.0,Cool SHIRT. NOT a sweatshirt as the picture shows.<br />Still a cool addition to the wardrobe for any Vacation fan.
2.0,Not the best at all the chain seemed like glitter was put on the sh*t.
2.0,"I was hesitant to buy this product at first, but I find that the cat print isn't as sloppy as I thought it would be. It took a month to get here. I still wear this, but I can't recommend this to anyone else. Bottom line, it doesn't have the body and volume the pictures make it out to have."
2.0,"Leg openings too big, not snug enough around upper thigh. Amazon made the perfect mid rise but is no longer available. I have now returned numerous underpants for the same reason, both low, mid and full rise. Can u suggest a mid rise brief that is tight around the upper thigh?"
2.0,"very, very thin fabric"
2.0,"Initially pleased but ultimately disappointed, as the CR-V started scratching off after just a few weeks.  Need to look for something better."
2.0,"I ordered the “army green” I expected it to be the same color as the picture. when I opened the package, I was so disappointed. The color was more like a light pastel green, not the fallish olivey army green :("
2.0,Not for women with curves.
2.0,Way too big. Expected to be much smaller.
2.0,Dress fit true to size but the front “V” elastic made it lay weird across the chest (almost like a pucker)<br />Had to return
2.0,Not length described and too thin.
2.0,There were not dark purple the way they they were advertised. They were actually more of a light purple.
2.0,very tight on sides of head
2.0,They were to big
2.0,"The metal rod that attaches the band is too long to fit in the watch itself. You have to take the rods out and replace them with the rods from the original bands that came with the watch. Also, the band itself is a bit too wide, making it difficult to fit on the watch."
2.0,"Very delicate, broke very easy. Looks Great, feels good but very weak."
2.0,"The tights are very soft and feel good. I ordere a large and I usually wear a medium and I had to stretch them pretty good to get them on, so they run small. Mine ended up having a defect on one leg, there were around 5 spots where the fabric was thinner and it was very visible. I returned mine. They are also not opaque. You can see through them. And my leg is not very thick. They looked perfectly opaque out of the package. I’m disappointed. I’ve looked up so many products and all of them have reviews where people say they’re not opaque."
2.0,It is a great looking belt but it was difficult to take off. After a couple weeks of wearing the belt a pin came out in the back making it impossible to unbuckle the belt. I had to take it off on back end of the buckle. It is a nice buckle and belt when it worked. But now its garbage. After my experience I would recommend not buying this belt and buckle.
2.0,Poor quality. Rhinestone fell out before I took out of package
2.0,The bottoms fit perfectly but the top is two sizes too small.  The two don't even look like they're the same size.  Disappointed in my purchase
2.0,"Very small and thin.  Not what I wanted.  Pattern is pretty but because it's so narrow, you can't see much of it."
2.0,The dress was too long and very see through and the piece that comes with it to tie a bow was not sent.  Otherwise it's ok
2.0,"The clasp broke after two weeks. Otherwise, it was an excellent watch."
2.0,"Way too thick of a headband to work out in, it does not lay flat against your head,, has a very thick ""sticky"" to keep it in place.  However, once you wash it, even if you air dry it, the stitching and material becomes twisted.  The headband becomes unwearable after washing.  I do not recommend."
2.0,"I was expecting a jogger, but these were tight like a legging."
2.0,I bought this shirt on large and it is not true to size. It may have been a little better had it come in an XL. The fabric is cheap and the arms were a little short. The quality of this shirt is for a teenager.
2.0,It’s made of the super thin material and some people like that slinky thin feel but I found it just felt a bit cheap. Also the stitching on mine was uneven and overall I was not pleased. I would have not minded the irregular stitching if the material would have been just a touch thicker.
2.0,"Feels and looks cheap. The links are very poorly finished. They don't connect seamlessly closed. Instead there is a 2-4mm gap in every link causing the chain to lay horribly. If you close the gap with some pliers, it makes the link misshapen.  This looks like poorly made hardware store chain."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:62556e4e58191b79b2a64195bf82876e]] The mask in the box will come with an N95 filter that you will have to insert into the mask but there is no way from my experience, to know when it's fully charging. I don't see a charging light or a green light that is fully charged. I wish they will have thought of this because it's also important.<br /><br />I don't think this app that I had to download has been updated in a long time. which leads me to believe that this product is all about sales and not making people happy as end-user/ mask users. Even on the app, I would like to see a charging meter or battery meter but you d not. I would like to stand out from everyone else but that is my only cons and pros about it."
2.0,"Little too heavy made my nipples feel like athletes foot, super sensitive and fiery. If they weren't so heavy it'd be better."
2.0,This is not the bag that I order. It does not have the middle part or the zipper on the outside of the bag as the picture shows
2.0,"These do not fit well at all, therefore poor protection"
2.0,wish the part that connected with the bill came up a bit higher. good hat though for the price
2.0,"Product was pretty and functional, but broken after two weeks. A waste of money."
2.0,Returned. I'm a size 10-12. Ordered the large. Very awkward fit with bust placement at my collar bone.
2.0,"Really wanted to love these compression socks, they’re super cute & although they didn’t feel overly tight they definitely left their mark making them uncomfortable to wear.  The interior pattern design imprinted this bad on my good leg that doesn’t even have swelling issues and I have fairly slim legs.  Would not recommend this particular design."
2.0,"I have washed this bra four times and no matter what I do, I cannot get rid of the terrible smell. I wish it was just a chemical smell, but it's much worse than that. I am sad about this because it is actually very well made and fits very nicely. I'm not sure if it is just this bra, or if they all come with the smell. But, it is enough that I cannot recommend it."
2.0,One shoe is not charging! Great disappointment for my daughter. The shipper has to check them before shipping. It is not a lot of work to press the button.
2.0,"These fit like skinny jeans and the material is very noisy. I’m not sure exactly what they are made of but it is not normal blue jean material. That being said, I would order other styles from this company because it is extremely hard to find jeans that fit. I have no hips or butt and these fit perfect. Size was true to fit for me. The reasoning for the lower star rating is the description is highly inaccurate."
2.0,The fit was great but the colors were off. The top part of maxi dress was a completely different shade of navy than the bottom chevron pattern. It does not match and doesn’t look good together.
2.0,These are crappy.  Granddaughter wore with insulated boots to do horse for approx 2 hours and her feet were still very very cold.  Do not recommend if colder than 20 degrees outside
2.0,"the only reason i give it two stars is because, I think i got a used item or a displayed item, it had some spots around the front of the frames, and it looked worn out. I order the same style before and it was perfect and brand new, this time don't know if it was the seller but somehow i got bad frames not to my standards of quality."
2.0,to large to wear
2.0,"The idea is better than the execution. I really wanted to like this respond, but I just don’t. I have tried to use it many times and it’s just not comfortable and it does not hold the watch close to my skin in a way that feels usable. Oh well, at least it was not expensive."
2.0,Another Chinese piece of crap of course
2.0,"I received 6 pairs of individually wrapped undies. The problem was they are not true to size - meaning they run small. When compared to each other, there were actually 4 different sizes among the 6 pairs. Very disappointing. The material is very thick. Some may like it, but it felt more like shape wear to me. Of course, they were too small. I ordered briefs. The legs come down lower than the natural crease of your leg and upper torso."
2.0,"This thing is ugly. In my opinion, it’s the type of thing that can only look good on a very thin person. It looks cheap. The outside is quite soft, and the inside is lined with an imitation silk material. Waste of money. Overpriced in my opinion."
2.0,Kinda see thru if you are large busted
2.0,Cheap.  I have one that was a giveaway at a convention that is better
2.0,EH
2.0,"The band is nice and good quality but I am in between sizes so had to return. The small was too tight, large too big. I was bummed!"
2.0,The bands of these plastic slippers came pressed in odd shapes and they have not yet returned to their originally-intended shape. Pity. Not worth the trouble and expense of returning them. Two stars plus.
2.0,The color was perfect but the sizing was completely wrong! I should have followed the reviews not the sizing chart.  It looked like a plus size women's dress. 2 of me could have fit in it. Smh
2.0,Started to tarnish quickly but with the price I really should complain
2.0,"Very disappointing sizing is wrong, they were very small for my daughter."
2.0,Super cute but didn’t hold up. Was only able to wear a couple of them a few times before the posts broke off.
2.0,to late to send back
2.0,"My husband bought this for me for Christmas. One of the snaps would not close and the bottom ripped within one month. The company sent me a new one and it is better, but one of the snaps comes undone easily. Not built the best."
2.0,"I wish to return it. Unfortunately the time is over. Really bad design. The neckline is awkward, doesn't keep the shape. The material is thick and soft though."
2.0,Love it but warning there is no stretch in fabric and it tends to be cut small across the middle.
2.0,"I downgraded my star rating due to the edges of the band being rough after a short period of wearing this band.<br /><br />I purchased this 2 months ago and have been wearing it daily. I was totally in love with it and while I do still love it when I wear short sleeves, it is not ideal to wear with long sleeves. It snags on every single long sleeved shirt, and everything it gets close to. So so sad the edges hook and snag everything."
2.0,I was excited to get this dress I liked it for my friends wedding next weekend I opened it to try it on and guess what it’s just a giant shirt and no belt. The belt is what makes this dress beautiful in my opinion and nothing.
2.0,A dress for someone under 5’2 on me it was a shirt and an ugly shirt....
2.0,Not as pictured. &#34;Lace&#34; is just itchy embroidery and is an odd mix of silver and gold. Tulle overlay is white-ish making the dress look grey. Top fits smaller then the skirt. Black fabric is thin and slippery...not at all what the picture shows it to be. Thankfully with prime I'll be sending this right back.
2.0,They’re nice except I only got 10 out of 12 colors 🤦🏽‍♀️
2.0,"They are not tight, but the seams are pulling.  They probably won't last a year."
2.0,"I've been a loyal Rocketdog wearer for about 7 years now. Their shoes have always been very comfy for my wide feet and I've always worn a size 8 from them. Size 8 has always been slightly big and my feet have had wiggle room. Recently, I started buying 7 1/2s in other brands and they've all fit perfectly (goodbye 8s?). I decided to order the 7 1/2 of these cute boots and ...they hurt so bad! The toe is much more narrow than the usual fit of Rocketdog, and these boots just run SMALL. ...too bad I didn't read the reviews beforehand. I just trusted that the brand I love to wear and have been wearing wouldn't let me down :/"
2.0,This shirt is nothing like other “untucked” shirts. The tails are way to long and swoop up like regular shirts. Also the fit wasn’t right. The arms were way too tight.
2.0,The black dress that I received was not the one in the picture. Very dissapointed.
2.0,"Figures, it fit like a large and I'm a 1x-2x depending on the brand and store."
2.0,"Shirt does not really look like the pic, material is thin... not the best off the shoulder shirt 😕"
2.0,Bad material with small sizes
2.0,"Paid 18.99 for a set of 2 straps; Product seemed good quality but the velcro that holds the poles came out in our very second use and that too on both our straps; the stitches to the velcro is very weak quality, just single thread stitch;<br />The strap that holds the ski are holding good and can be wrapped around tighter even for a kids skis;"
2.0,Sizes are much smaller than described in the size chart describing the product.  The fabric does not feel like jeans at all.
2.0,"Thought is was a great buy for the amount of geodes you get but they were all very dense and the same solid ones over and over. It was nice they threw in an additional blue geode but it was already smashed. Downside to our specific case, it was cracked and chunks missing when we unboxed for my son's birthday."
2.0,Cute but simple and cheaply made ...material is thin and feels like that of a costume you'd buy at Halloween time
2.0,"Okay...<br /><br />I bought this dress and I LOVE the color. I love the dress however... the hem, it’s weird. I mean I guess it’s my own fault looking back at the pictures now. In the pictures I thought it was a low, high type deal. Like low in the middle and high on the sides.... No! It came exactly as it looks in the picture. It is one length on the left front side and another on the right front side. It’s weird. Lol"
2.0,A lot smaller than it looks.
2.0,The buckle release button is difficult to use.
2.0,This face mask is gigantic. If you are on the petite side dont even bother.
2.0,"Bought 2 different salwars neither came with sleeves like advertised. The ""button"" on this blue and green one fell right off while taking it out of the packaging"
2.0,Really thin material and xxl size was small compared to my other xxl tank tops.
2.0,Thin and tight. More like leggings than pants.
2.0,Fits my 5 yr. old great. I rated it with 2 stars because the hook won't stay closed.  It comes loose very very easily.
2.0,"Beware. Image was not centered on shirt. Very noticeable when I tried it on. Then even though it says free returns, it’s not. I have to return through a carrier of my choice and they will only refund $4 even though it costs more than that to return. I do not recommend buying this."
2.0,"SO they either took random scraps of things laying around for these or they designed them horribly... The stones in many places don't even go where they are, they're simply glued on and look out of place for their spot they're in. Many little stones have the same issue. Seems like a very poor design which is sad because other than that I love the glass stones on these and the design. It could have been amazing but instead it just looks lazy or thrown together."
2.0,This is more of a long sleeve shirt. Not a sweater. Ran smaller than expected
2.0,"Didn't want to bother with a return but this is a stiff, no giving cotton material and the neck part is not adjustable. It was way too big around my neck and no way to make it smaller without cutting and resewing it maybe somehow but I don't do that so not sure. I am very disappointed that it is so long. The person would have to be taller than me and I am 5'6&#34;, not short and I got a size small. I thought it was a softer stretchy cotton. It does look well made otherwise but it won't fit me and I&#34;m not sure I can find someone it would fit on."
2.0,I gave it 2⭐ because they got the colors right and the size isn't to far off but the fabric is horrible it doesn't lay well when you move the shirt doesn't move the fabric isn't soft but it is light weight I would not buy this shirt again but I'm not going to go through the hassle of returning it so save yourself the time and money and get something else
2.0,"Coat was so so cute, but value was poor ripped the first time worm.."
2.0,The quality of these tanks sucks so I’ll definitely won’t be wearing them.
2.0,Neither my daughter nor I really care for this belt. Comes u done. Doesn’t sit comfortably if you have a belly
2.0,material was not as good as I expected.
2.0,Color is very nicebut It's too small and uncomfortable.oh…
2.0,These aren't the greatest cycling glasses in my opinion.  I have bout 6 pairs of different designs that both I and my kids use when riding and so far these have the worst fit.  The nose bridge piece is not adjustable and forces the glasses to sit too far down on my nose.<br /><br />The yellow and clear lenses are ok but that redish/yellow lense which I thought was going to actually be red/yellow is just a darkened lens which is too dark to use when riding in the shaded forest.  Overall I would recommend you pass.
2.0,"CHEAP JUNK - Used for 3 days & over 1/2 of the pockets had ripped.  After one week, taping several pockets & the snap breaking, it went straight to the garbage.  Should not known wish the cost of $2.59 that it would be cheap!!  Live and learn....."
2.0,Nice medallion but chain to short.
2.0,"I needed a costume quickly this past week since I’m an actor in a local, popular haunted attraction and it was opening weekend. I did read the reviews so I pretty much knew what I was getting into. But due to the fact that I needed something fast, it’s cheap, & since Momo is terrifying, I purchased this. Granted the purchase shipped and arrived FAST, that was great. Right in time for my first evening of scaring patrons at Nightmare on 19th Street. But I couldn’t and didn’t wear it, except for when I tried it on. The mask smells distinctly bad (quite an unappetizing scent). There are eye slits on the inside of the eyes, but that doesn’t mean anything because you cannot see a thing when wearing it. It’s small. Prepare to get overheated when wearing it - there’s no functionality with that, no breathing holes. I would recommend you buy this only if you’re going to wear one time, maybe not even then. Returning it as I type this review."
2.0,Way too stretchy. Seems like 6 inches at least. Not what I want in belt. Plus the burnt sealed end of the braid is on the front of the belt resulting in an ugly black spot
2.0,I did not like this jacket.  It was very small and had a strange smell.  I wore it a few times but ultimately asked for a refund.  The seller was great and issued a refund and didn't even ask for the jacket back.
2.0,"The shape/cut is flattering, BUT the stripes don't match up on the sides making it look very cheap! I returned the product."
2.0,The shirt itself is cute.  I purchased black and a pink shirt.  The necklaces that come with are nothing that I would wear.  Very gawdy and cheap.<br />The shirts lasted 2 washes before the seams in the shirts came undone.
2.0,"The color in pink looks light pink, not the color that was expected, had To return."
2.0,would love the correct size 33<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WJ12OS4?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
2.0,Run small. XL fit my size 6 daughter.
2.0,"The shoulder pad is coming apart, staining my shirts"
2.0,I bought the Hoenn badges as a new product but it was obviously used - two badge have that rusty-faded paint look as seen from my picture. The rest of the badges were in better condition.
2.0,"Comfortable but not durable , one snapped in half already"
2.0,All three of the bow ties have broken apart under no duress. Fortunately I can use them as pocket squares now.
2.0,"When I first received the earrings I was initially disappointed as they were NOTHING like the earrings I actually ordered. I decided that because they were colorful and large, I would try them on and maybe just keep them. When I went to put the earrings on SEVERAL of the beads completely fell off of the earring, which was a sign I definitely needed to return them. On a positive note, once the $ I spent on this pair is credited back to my account, I may re-order as I like the colorfulness and size and hopefully the next set I receive will actually be true to the colors that are shown in the photo."
2.0,I returned this band. It was extremely big and aside from that was very thin and cheap looking. It looked tarnished and felt like it would bend very easily.
2.0,These pants are made of real cheap looking material. They don't look like picture.
2.0,"No shape, not flattering"
2.0,"The dress is cute but unfortunately I had to return it. I’m 5’2 and I ordered size 12, and I usually buy 34D from Victorias Secret (I hope this is helpful). I couldn’t zipper up around my chest whatsoever.  The dress is really long even with 5 inches heels so you’ll definitely need to have it hemmed if you’re short like me."
2.0,They are cute but the sizing needs to be fixed.
2.0,"My normal size is a 16-18, I tend to have trouble finding tops to fit my arms and I'm also wider in the shoulders then I guess most women. So I always try to size up when buying a shirt. I purchase this in the XX large size. I probably would have been safe buying just a standard extra large. The shirt is very roomy but in a bad way as there is no shape to it. I returned it immediately. Overall the quality of the shirt wasn't bad and if you want something big and baggy and you don't care if it looks boxy than this is the shirt for you."
2.0,"Bought this as a gift for my sister.  Took about a month for her to get and she says it is really small.  She likes the jacket, but can't wear it and there was no return info in the package for her, so stuck with a jacket she can't wear.<br /><br />So basically, good jacket but go up at least one size and don't expect it to be there quickly.....  Gave it a 2 star just because of these 2 issues."
2.0,"I really wanted to love this item. I originally gave it 4 stars when I first put it in but moved that to 2 stars. It was super cute but within the next few days it fell apart. The diamond part does not screw on so it doesn't have grooves for me to even try and glue it back together. You can purchase it, but know it will not last even a week."
2.0,"These earrings are cute; however, the closures do not work and therefore cannot be worn.  Note:  These are not practical for women - definitely for young (8-12 year old girls)."
2.0,I Did not get the order it was lost by shipper and decided not to reorder as it may get lost again from the shipper and I have purchased a more expensive one from Pandora
2.0,Pants way shorter than I expected
2.0,They were a little big.  Ordered her size  so she used the strap ripped off the shoe
2.0,The sizing runs very small.  My child was unable to wear this and it had to be returned.
2.0,ordered two similar dresses in the same size. the other pattern fit great.This one was MUCH larger on top. will return.
2.0,"Good customer service. Although,  I ordered a 2XL and it fitted like a Medium."
2.0,They sit right under my eyes and they are very uncomfortable.
2.0,"Purchased these in white and they were perfect but when I went back and purchased these in black, they were significantly shorter (same fit otherwise, but, shorter)."
2.0,Does not match ad- ad have red lettering and I recieved white lettering. Please advertise the correct product!
2.0,"I was THRILLED to discover these goggles after days of looking for the perfect ones. They looked perfect. What I received was sadly nowhere near the photo. I got a pair that is a dirty silver color, has hot glue strings everywhere, the lenses are scratched and the cogs are glued to the lens itself, making them Impossible to actually see through.<br /><br />Now I don't have time to return them and find a better pair. Very disappointed."
2.0,"I really liked this earring but it was obvious from the beginning that it wasn't meant to be kept long. The clasp doesn't hold well. A few times I was fortunate enough for it to fall out while I was at home but last time I wasn't so lucky and lost it while I was out, never to be seen again. Really sucks because it was the perfect size for my daith."
2.0,The quality wasn’t that good
2.0,"Please be aware that this product is much more fragile than advertised, and since it's a cheaper material watch, most repair places don't consider it worth their time. It is still very pretty and unless you are not careful with winding it, it keeps excellent time."
2.0,Way to long of a bar.
2.0,"These are ok but, not the best quality. One of mine doesn't work at all , and the other three are very hard to get to light up. I wouldn't recommend them for gifts"
2.0,"They fit well, easy to change band, good colors, but Broke within a couple weeks and I had to return them."
2.0,"Despite ordering the suggested size, this bra does NOT accommodate large breasts at all. I am a DD cup and I still spill out from the sides and underneath."
2.0,Did not like material at all I thought it was like a cotton blend and it's actually similar to spandex but more flowy if that makes sense.  The hem was all bunched up too.  They did package it decently and it was mailed promptly.  I think if you want this for a strip club it's perfect but for daily wear it's not the right material it also shows every flaw lol and way too long
2.0,The sash was beautiful!  The packaging was beautiful but the 1 is definitely backwards on the tiara....  so disappointing.....  she wore the sash but opted not to wear the tiara
2.0,Doesn't really look like the picture and it's not exactly very comfortable. The white layer on the bottom is stiff material and doesn't lay soft and nice. If you're curvy at all it's unflattering to the figure and you may need to wear with leggings and not tights.
2.0,"What I like about these sunglasses:<br />- The price.<br />- The frame size.<br />What I don’t like:<br />- The blue coating on the inside of the lens causes a glare when is exposed directly to the sun light. The glare is very irritating for the eye, and it limits my visual field... All I can see at the periphery of the visual field is a shiny blue reflection of the sunlight. For instance, in the morning, when I drive North, and the sunlight is very strong on my right side, about one third of my visual field on the right is just an intense blue glare.. It is quite difficult to describe, I hope I’m using the proper words.."
2.0,"The Selene Women's Lightweight Robe V-Neck Knit Soft Kimono Sleepwear in size medium was both too large and too small for my 5'3"", 116 lb body. The shoulders were too wide and it felt like I was wearing a size large. However, the rest of the garment was too small and could barely accommodate my chest or wrap around my waist. It is made with a thin ribbed t-shirt material that does not feel suitable for a robe. The stitching was uneven with puckering along the sides. The overall look is shabby and cheap, and at nearly $30, I would have returned it had I purchased it."
2.0,Extremely large.
2.0,Stones fall out way to easily.This is my second band. Will not buy again
2.0,I waited it seemed like forever for this. It fits somewhat small and a button was missing!!<br />I was not too thrilled and may rethink purchasing anything else. It is super cute and works for a casual outfit for work but I'm pretty bummed I had to sew another button on.
2.0,"Looks cute online and the fabric is quite soft, but it's rather bulky once you put it on. Ends up looking like you just got out of the shower and put on a turban."
2.0,Only worn twice and it faded already
2.0,I wished this was designed better.  It’s super cute and what I was almost what I was looking for.  The only downfall was it didn’t close together in the front.
2.0,"Gooq quality,  thou they size these for very small people, try an 8 yr old. At this time i cannot recommend these for your next purchase."
2.0,"It's off, way off. When you put it on, a part of the left top seam pops out (basically above the letter E). The lettering is raised, grossly. Not a big deal if you like that, I didn't."
2.0,"As soon as I saw the material, I was disappointed and returned it without trying it on. Material is not what I think of when I think corduroy. It was thick, chunky stripes of a very shiny polyester material. Maybe okay for some people, but it didn't meet my expectations, although I like the style a lot."
2.0,"Got this for my friends birthday and I have to admit that I'm a bit disappointed. For the price you shouldn't expect to be blown away but you still expected at least one pro, besides the price.. First the packaging. It comes in a pouch. It's a bit of a let down when little is done for how an item is presented to you, regardless of price. Second thing is the weight. I expected it to be a bit heavy but not this heavy. It felt like a man's watch. Also I would definitely have to remove one or two links. Lastly and most importantly, the appearance is not good. The watch I got the face is a bit discolored making it look a little bit brown."
2.0,Not what expected. Very thin and brittle. Do not waste your money.
2.0,These are very cute and I like the gray color (which is actually more taupe) but I have literally washed them 5 times in a row and they still have a strong chemical smell. My daughter has sensitive skin so she likely won’t be weuthese at all.
2.0,"I didn,t like them that much, they look kind Of cheap, i guess the material and the sole are not as nice as in the picture"
2.0,"I am 5'8&#34; and I ordered a XL because I am a busty lady. The material was soft however the dress was not floor lengh, It came to my mid calf. Not cool. Sent back."
2.0,The fit wasn't what I expected.
2.0,This is not real leather. I returned them.
2.0,"So....<br />The people who made this do not know how a humans head or face is generally shaped.<br />I was able to make it work for a photo shoot sort of, but I'll never wear it again and will be buying one of higher quality."
2.0,"I have purchased 2 other dresses from this same company. The first one fit me perfectly, the second one was large on me and this one was small. But the thing I was most disappointed in is the other dresses were made with a nice material while this one was extremely sheer. you can see through it.  very disappointing."
2.0,Did not look like picture. Color was darker more brown than orange.
2.0,very tight around the toe area and I don't ever order a wide size. going to return them.
2.0,"I bought an 3xl and it was too small. The neckless was great! The earing was broken before using it, but then I end up having to fix it."
2.0,"Very thin, worn material. Very awkward fit, not loose as expected, definitely made for a tiny Asian frame"
2.0,"I had high hopes for this shirt but was not impressed with it in person.  It was bulky, the stitching on the applique was not very good.  It just hung wrong."
2.0,"The girl in the pic must be little, cuz that didn't fit me like that. They really should tell the size of the model. Very flimsy material, see thru.  I gave it away to a smaller person."
2.0,cheaply made and cheap looking
2.0,"The quality was nice but it was way too large in the torso. Very very long. But the cup size fit great. I'm a size 4or 6 usually with a 36 DD size bra if that helps, I got the large because it said too with my cup size but it was too big on my body. But the reason I marked it two stars is because of the closure at the bottom, they close with hook and eyes instead of snaps or velcro? Who does that?? It's hard enough taking off a dress or skirt that uses just one or two hooks and eyes. But this bodysuit has THREE down there, all I could think of is being in a bathroom stall at a bar trying to pry that thing a part HARDPASS. So I'm returning it to look for something else. Bummer."
2.0,Cheap material. The buckle makes a clicking noise when you walk. It sort of sounds like you have your own little soundtrack. Perhaps thats a plus for some?
2.0,The flowers are not for regular sized nipples. I have pretty small nipples and they didn't fit around them. Ended up just wearing the bars alone.
2.0,"In addition to the delivery being delayed, once received, the design/words on one of the gowns was backwards. The one that is correct is so cute and the other would be too if it was correct. The material is a soft poly material and gown is true to size."
2.0,"These are good until you try to work out. They look and feel a lot like lululemon. They have that buttery soft feel but when you start to work out you’ll notice the difference because they start to move around too much. I used them while hiking and they kept moving down from my waist to my hips. By the end of the hike, I got so tired of pulling them up and adjusting them that I literally grabbed the fabrics and just held it in my hand so that it wouldn’t keep falling. I’d say these are good for lounging around and they do feel and look like lulu but don’t make my mistake and take them to a workout session."
2.0,Really like it but afraid to wear....one of the little magnets fell out somewhere.....and I'm afraid I'll lose fit bit flex two tracker....wishing they will send new silver Henoda bracelet
2.0,"The foam pad between base and slipper is too thin, creating awkward feeling on stepping.  Base tore away after2 uses.  Not real happy, especially for price, but will wear them until they fall apart (which I hope means through only this winter)"
2.0,"It fits as expected for an Asian XL. The size isn't my problem, it's the material. It's very poly-blend and hot! I don't like how small the neck opening is either. I DO like the pockets and shape of the bottom half, so I will probably use it for a sewing project. It was cheap, so not going to return. I think my &#34;sorry I have plans with my cat&#34; t-shirt is going to be the top half of this dress. Lol!<br />NOT breathable- terrible on a hot day. Enjoy!"
2.0,"They were long enough to go from ankle to just below knee, but stretched out and would slide down. They seem to wash/dry and go back to original shape, but I wouldn’t buy them again"
2.0,"Even though the images show 2 sets of 3 briefs, this item is only for ONE set of 3."
2.0,The fabric was it a soft as I would like. I had to send it back.
2.0,no stretch at all....very tight socks
2.0,Too large had to return.
2.0,Heavy material which is great! The length is way shorter than the picture showed
2.0,"I have gotten this bracelet as an arm candy for my watch, the bracelet came with missing rhinestones and the little hook thing hurts!!"
2.0,"The description says it fits babies 0 months. This is false, it’s huge on my 1 month old. I would recommend these hats for babies 1 and up."
2.0,It's beautiful...it just hurts. If you don't get it in the exact right spot it hurts so much. My ear was sore the next day too.
2.0,These might look ok on a very petite woman but they look like clown pants on me!
2.0,"Fit was disappointing -- loose at the hips (bubble hips); had to return!  Quality was good, price good and good length.  I usually use a size 6 in Gloria Vanderbilt jeans/capris, but these just didn't work."
2.0,Cute but chain broke after my daughter wore it once
2.0,Way smaller than pictured. Fits my kids.
2.0,The photo for this bra is misleading. I thought this bra had some kind of padding in the cups. It does NOT have any padding in the cups. However to those with back problems from heavy boobs this bra is a dream come true. Unfortunately for me the shape of my tata's make this bra rather unflattering. (Far apart pointy shaped things) This is going to be returned.
2.0,"These are way too thick to be able to breath out of. Without the filter, you still can’t breathe through them. The only reason I have it two stars is because I like the filters and I use them for my other masks that are breathable."
2.0,"Eh it’s ok. It’s a cute styled shirt but the shoulders come to an odd point and it fit small. The bust is tight when you raise your arms and the sleeves are pretty short. The material is alright, kinda thin but that’s what I wanted. Also, the button on the back of the neck doesn't even come sewed on, it was taped on.."
2.0,"Sometimes you think wow that might be a great idea. This is not one of those times. This is a flat piece of plastic that makes racking the balls very time consuming. The little cut outs that are suppose to keep the balls in place simply don't. My brother laughed at me when I showed him this thing and I wanted to prove him wrong. Sad to say he was right and nothing beats a traditional rack. Maybe others like being frustrated trying to rack the balls with this thing I don't! Some people may like this over priced piece of plastic but it was one of those regretful purchases for me. This is simply my opinion maybe you will like it, I don't."
2.0,"Nice fit and comfy but after 1 wash, there's already a hole in them, hence the 2 stars"
2.0,"These aren't true to size. Barely fit my grand daughter and if her foot grows any then they will be a total waste of my money. If anyone order these, order at least 1 to 1 1/2 size bigger."
2.0,Hat came quickly and as described. The depth of the hat was deeper than I hoped so the hat sat really low on my forehead/close to my brows. Perhaps I have a smaller head than I thought but it unfortunately did not work for me.
2.0,What is nice looking but it broke as soon as I put it on
2.0,Too large and I ordered a small!
2.0,Does not look like the picture at all. Way tighter than a normal tshirt! Very disappointed
2.0,"They are just not what they say they are, night vision, not exactly, plus they are really way too big."
2.0,I got these thinking they would be cute but they look ridiculously cheap — as in a cheap shoe you buy at a dollar store and then take home and craft to add tons of glitter onto it. I can't seriously put these on my daughter. They'll be for costume parties only if she wants to go as a princess or something like that.
2.0,Thin and cheap. Poor quality. I would not purchase again.
2.0,The strap keeps coming undone
2.0,"This was bought for a fancy dress event. It has been driving us crazy because every time we take it out of the bag it drops not only feathers but lots of small bits. it will serve the purpose, but I now wish I had bought a boa in a store where I could see the quality."
2.0,"These don't sit high enough to feel comfortable, keep sliding down. Also the legs aren't long and roll up."
2.0,"I expected a much thinner material for something intended for sunny outdoor use. I will probably never wear this one. Still looking for a cooling gaiter with a mask slot, until then I'll keep using my thin polyester UV gaiter with a mask underneath."
2.0,"The slot to hold the Fitbit is difficult to open and requires a special tool enclosed with the bracelet.  This will surely get lost.  It looks pretty, but the quality is cheap."
2.0,"Shoe trees fit well, but mine arrived with a large crack on top (not the split toe)."
2.0,Great shorts until they tore at the pockets almost instantly. Got them replaced and it happened again
2.0,"See through. Literally, wouldn’t recommend wearing as shown in the photo above<br />This product shall be used with a bathing suit underneath if you plan to wear in public."
2.0,This runs very small. Nice dress but order up.
2.0,"Everything is great, except for the dim display."
2.0,"Not as shown and not even standard sizing. A cheap facsimile, very, very tiny threaded beads with no casings around them and less than 7 inches (6.75 inches )for the bracelet and 14 inch necklace, Each have a flimsy 2 inch unfinished extend. Afraid to put them on because they will probably break immediately. Not made for an adult, not sturdy enough for a child or an adult. Will return,  very disappointed not worth 3 bucks all totaled!!!"
2.0,Opposite of the criwn is just a weird hole for no reason like are they trying to save a dolkar looks weird wont buy again.
2.0,It’s not what I expected
2.0,"The strap to tie is too too small, needs to be much longer"
2.0,"These glasses were vertically than my glasses, so they don't fit as well as others I have had"
2.0,It's not what I expected but I'll still use it until it no longer works
2.0,"This was great, from the bottom up, right up until the straps.  For whatever reason, they twist and slip, and definitely don't want to stay on my shoulders."
2.0,"Material would be to hot to wear as pajamas,also fit to low on the waist for my liking"
2.0,"The fabric is thin and flimsy ...<br />Without a bra, the nipples stick out.  With a bra, you see the bra straps.<br />Sorry ... I had to send it back.<br />A different fabric would have made all the difference in the world."
2.0,Cute but material was to thin and tooo small (I'm 5'6  purchased L ) i gave it to my mom 5'2 and fit her perfect
2.0,The fabric pilled quickly and was not flexible. It’s cute to look at but I’d pass on this.
2.0,"This mask is adequate, but I had to put a dot on one side of each, as it's impossible to tell the front and back of this mask. For those who don't wear this mask constantly, (i.e. take it off in the car, etc. ) this will be a problem."
2.0,really nice but soon small
2.0,Not very sterdy
2.0,"tight fit, and stiff.  And don't like the wide open (personal preference).  I wear straight cut jeans.  But good leather construction."
2.0,Silver coating faded off and copper undercolor shown through after a couple of meanths of light wear.
2.0,"I needed a pair of knockarounds for a boating trip.  One of the arms broke after the second time using them, but they looked fly as hell doing so.  I may try and glue them, but for $10, I won't be devastated if they don't fix."
2.0,"I was so excited for this dress, but it was a big let down. I ordered an XL and it was more like an extra smedium. It's a cute dress but it does not run true to size."
2.0,"The saying, 'you get what you pay for!' could not be more true with regard to this bag. The color was beautiful. Unfortunately, the quality of the bag is not what I expected.  Before I even opened the plastic packing bag, I could smell a very obvious plastic/chemical smell.  The material is definately not leather (not that it was advertised as such), but it looks very cheap and screams 'i am not leather'.  I am sending this back.  I wish that they made it in real leather, it is a lovely design."
2.0,This kimono is very short. I am 5’9” and it barely came to the bottom of my bottom. Almost looks like a child’s piece of clothing. I like a long flowy kimono so am returning it. The fabric is nice and if it fit at all I’d keep it. Would have saved me the time if there was a picture of this item on a model.
2.0,It is not the same as the picture. Cant wear it
2.0,Fits small bought a large and was snug.
2.0,"The picture is misleading, making it look like a slim fit. I felt like a dorky soccer coach wearing this, and it blouses horribly when tucked in. The design itself is also much more black and white than the picture makes it look. I would highly recommend going a size or 2 smaller than you normally are because this shirt is huge."
2.0,Didn't like a fabric
2.0,"Wish it had a battery back up like the last. Fan goes on and off when going into a little shade...would rather go without because of that. In FL it is hot even in filtered sunlight, but the hat has to have direct light, literally to be working."
2.0,"Only giving these 2 stars because, although we loved these so much (very cute), they snapped very soon after buying them.  We ended up having to throw them out.  Cheaply made."
2.0,This is designed to fit a teen not an adult.
2.0,Very pretty!!Sizes are way to big to start stretching for the first time. I had a couple of duplicates too. Never got anywhere will seller so returning them.
2.0,Damaged: one of the earrings diamond stud came off as it arrived.  Pictures attached.
2.0,I had really hoped these would be the ones to replace the ORIGINAL ORIGINAL Teva Mush.  No.
2.0,"It is a t-shirt, just a t-Shirt. There was no side drape. It was waist length, not hip length. Thin material and no fitting or shape."
2.0,Zipper broke in a few days!!
2.0,Smaller than expected. To tight and the belt isn’t flattering. I returned it.
2.0,DESCRIPTION IS 100% WRONG IT DOES NOT COME WITH BOX I EVEN EMAILED THEM THEY ARE AWARE IT SAYS WITH BOX BUT ALL THEY SAID WAS SORRY BUT BOX IS NOT INCLUDED.
2.0,Much thinner than I expected.
2.0,Do not like the quality of this product
2.0,"This is actually the first review I've written on Amazon.  I usually don't wish to take the time, but I figured I would in hopes of sparing others their time and money.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this a one star is the fabric.  It's actually better than &#34;t-shirt&#34; quality - it's nice and soft.  However, the color, the way it's made and the length are deceiving.  The color is not as deep as the picture indicates, nor is the length quite as long.  I'm 5/6 1/2, weigh 135, and the large I ordered was snug, unlike a lot of reviews stating how big this top was on them.  And then there's the collar.  What a mess!  I tried every which way to get this collar to lay in a way that I could even possibly wear, and to no avail.  On it's way back..."
2.0,"This is a comfy enough house dress.  It runs plenty big.  I ordered a Large, because I am busty, but I still could have ordered a medium and gotten away with it.<br /><br />It is reasonably soft, has pockets (for those who care about that) and is modest.  And that would be all well and good...except it isn't what it claimed to be.<br /><br />It is NOT what the seller claimed to be selling.  Specifically, the listing indicates 65% cotton.  That is WHY I ordered this.  Turns out, it is 95% polyester and not a DROP of cotton!  UGH!  Polyester sleeps HOT!  I NEVER would have ordered this had the listing been TRUTHFUL.<br /><br />This is not the first time I have encountered deceptive listings that out and out LIE about the fabric content!  Amazon should BAN sellers who blatantly LIE about their products, plain and simple.  STOP LYING about your product!!!"
2.0,Button fell off during first wear.
2.0,"There is something to be said for buying a dress when it doesn't cost much, you won't get much.  Purchased this for a wedding and the fit on it was SO odd.  I can usually wear dresses like this just fine, but it was like the waist of it was right under my chest, which looked odd.  The material was not good quality either.  I returned this item."
2.0,It's super thin and i think only kids could wear these.
2.0,The good: Belt mechanism works well.<br />The bad: Belt buckle itself finish wore off in spots not even a week into using this belt. Maybe it's just the one I received but the finish / coating is paper thin and wears off much too easily. Shame because I really liked the belt.<br /><br />So buyer beware: the belt works well as a belt but the finish of the buckle is less than satisfactory
2.0,The material isn’t great. When you stretch it you see through it
2.0,I got a way cheaper version on this!! I was pretty disappointed.
2.0,"I have a 40 waist and 44 hips. I bought the 2x large and rhe are too big, very loose. I thin i could have gone with a large."
2.0,"Fabric is  polyester feel , brown in color , not cream and is VERY short."
2.0,Pedi un size 10/12 y me enviaron 12
2.0,Unless you’re amazing at putting these kind of backs on or someone will help…it was impossible for me. The only reason why I bought them is because of the backs. I’m wearing them but with the traditional earring back cause I couldn’t get them on
2.0,"Found the missing eye for one of the owls and glued it back. These are actually pretty long. Otherwise, ok. I haven't found an opportunity to wear them yet"
2.0,I was looking for something less warm. this was too warm & soft to the touch I found that a less jersey knit feeling polyester breathes better & wicks moisture away better. see haralee pajamas
2.0,These look very ugly with no curve or appeal to them at all!
2.0,Too small to read
2.0,Appearance is as pictured and arrived on time.  Product is much smaller and is more of a wallet than a purse. Material and straps are not durable.
2.0,"The material looks nice and the magnets are not weak (although not as strong as other bands I've tried, both OEM and non-OEM). However, the main problem is that the two straps will not lay flat against each other, no matter how I attach them. The outer strap always has a part that wants to create a bump/space. I don't know if I got a defective strap or if they all do this. Either way, it looks warped when I wear it, so I am returning."
2.0,Not at all as advertised. Just plain Old sunglasses
2.0,"These are pretty earrings BUT 4 days after my return window, I noticed that 2 stones have fell out. Only wore them 2 times."
2.0,Pretty. Very lightweight.
2.0,"Guess its my fault for buying more. The first gray large was\is great. Navy is big, white and maroon are huge. Hanging on the same hanger there are inches in difference, all size large."
2.0,I wear my earrings all the time.  They come unscrewed and fall out.
2.0,"To tight ,i kept one pair and sent two of the three Pair's back Please Process My Refund ,Thank""'s"
2.0,Gloves dont fit well. They smell weird. Returning mine.
2.0,"Overall, I find this strap underwhelming. Nothing about this strap looks or feels ""premium"". The material is nice, but nothing spectacular. The hardware is cheap (and looks it). The strap came packaged in a cheesy plastic sleeve reminiscent of chinese made dollar store goods. I have ordered many less expensive nato and zulu straps from Amazon that were superior to this one. If this had been a $10-$12 strap, I'd probably keep it but at $20, I am disappointed. I'm planning on returning this."
2.0,"It is a cute cut, but extremely thin fabric. It's see-through. I can't wear it anywhere, so that's disappointing."
2.0,Looked better in picture.  Too long and small at waist.  Returned.
2.0,Looks cute online. If your thinking to size down don’t it already fits snug in fact size up. Legs are very long! Has a itchy feeling and will not protect you from any type of cold. Mine came with loose thread so return!
2.0,"Too small, too cheap. That's those Chinese again. They must think we're all dwarfs."
2.0,This is not holographic.  It's only glitter.
2.0,"Broke as soon as I put it on my wrist, stone feel out.<br />Packing was very poor, plastic sleeve for bracelet in a very thin padded envelope."
2.0,It’s tight.... but it sucks.... It doesn’t make you sweat much. Your better off just wearing the faja.
2.0,"Not included in the image of the bracelets is the additional &#34;charm&#34; that reads &#34;chubby Chico charm.com&#34; on one side and &#34;hand made&#34; on the other. My intention was to give a gift of a personal importance, not advertising for future jewelry purchases. Otherwise, the bracelet is lovely."
2.0,"I expected better quality for the cost. I wore them two days in a row, the back end of the top broke while I was putting on the piece that secures all  the pieces together. Super cute earrings, but they are not worth the price, I expect $5.00 jewelry to break, not $50.00 earrings..."
2.0,It two sizes up
2.0,"cheap poor quality , ordered a small that  was definitely not the right fit for a standard small in any country"
2.0,"This shirt is WAY shorter that expected as in the photo, the sleeves have very small shoulder holes, and it has faded from only two washes."
2.0,Way too small not not sized appropriately
2.0,I purchased this purse a month ago and used it for 3 weeks. The shoulder strap came off the side from the stitching today. I would like to know how to replace it or be refunded. The purse is nice but not if it falls apart before using it daily.
2.0,Within a week the pocket stitching came apart.
2.0,Very cheap and thin material. Only the Zipper is nice quality
2.0,I did not like the heavy clinging material.
2.0,"These glasses are cute and would have been perfect, but they were missing the nose pieces. Not just broken off, but missing from the entire package. I tried replacing the nose pads, but they ended up being too small and now the glasses won't fit as properly."
2.0,"Although more comfortable than compression socks (since they don't bunch like socks), the bands at the top and bottom are not wide enough, so are as constrictive there as the bunched up compression socks. OW!"
2.0,Thin material and under shorts does not make the outfit look nice.
2.0,look very fat in the stomach
2.0,Wasn't what I had hope for.
2.0,"This is great if you have a long torso, but if you're petite like me, find another dress."
2.0,There is a problem with the sizes. I got a 5T for my 4 year old and is way too small. I also got a 8T for my six years old and while the top fits perfectly the pants are way too short. There have average height. I already washed them and cannot return them. My boys are so disappointed.
2.0,The edges of the anchor catch on stuff
2.0,Sadly this was too small and not true to size. I ended up giving it away to a teenager. While it is for woman they are more like kids sizes
2.0,"These run small so order at least a half size larger or if you plan to wear socks, definitely a order full size larger than your normal size! The quality is just okay…they’re called “snow booties” but unless you want wet feet, I’d stay out of the snow!"
2.0,Dress is cute but white color is see through.
2.0,"Personally, I just didn't like the fit. I felt it would be more suitable for an older woman, not someone in their 20-30s. So I returned it. I originally bought because I liked that it had sleeves and I was going to a November outdoor wedding."
2.0,"You get what you pay for. There is a reason the listing has a graphic of the product and not actual photos. The tint is average. The blue mirror front is light, people can see right through. The material is obviously a cheap plastic. These are designed exactly like Pugs brand sunglasses but made very cheap. Do yourself a favor. Pay $20 for the Pugs. You'll be happier in the longrun."
2.0,Fit was not right.  I returned them.
2.0,Very thin material and you need 2 to make them work as boot cuffs.
2.0,Good earrings. Fast delivery....<br />Edit: one was bent wouldnt unlatch got it unlatched and now it wont latch... Kinda a pain in the butt really.
2.0,"I loved the look of this band. It fit my large wrist well, and elevated the look of my watch. But after a few days of use it started to get discolored and the edges began to fray. It also has a weird smell. I stopped wearing it. Gross!"
2.0,"Too skimpy for a man.  Not good quality nor fit for anyone but a child.  Not enough material in front, back and shoulders"
2.0,Doesn't look like pic. Shorter than pic.
2.0,"Length is fine, but the fit in the crotch and hips is very awkward and tight. Im a pretty thin built guy wasit was fine but my legs were being held tight together"
2.0,The design is great but it is cheaply made. I fell apart when I used for the first time.
2.0,way too wide if you wear a regular width shoe
2.0,Makes your bottom looks bulky. The skirt bottom is from very wrinkly material.
2.0,I used my luggage the first time and the rubber wore off the wheels in chunks. I’ve tried to find replacement wheels but having a hard time figuring out what to get. I’ve now used my luggage about 3 times total and the handle has broken off the large and medium suitcases.
2.0,"I'm unimpressed with this cap.  I don't believe it's as long as the original from the film, which is really disappointing.  And the material is awfully flimsy, i.e., thin.  It's a nice oddity but not if you really want to keep warm."
2.0,These shirts I think run about 2 sizes too big. I prefer a slightly more tailored fit and found that I could order 2 sizes smaller. Overall great shirt.
2.0,"I am giving this a rating of 2 because it IS a cute dress. However, per the norm for clothing made in China, it's too small.  I'm trying to find a way to identify the country of manufacture prior to buying, but have yet to be successful, a reason why I am cutting way back on ordering clothing from Amazon. It's a scam and I've already lost money."
2.0,"The socks are nice except I'm not satisfied with the fit. The listing doesn't specify the size on the socks which is odd. However, when they arrived they were clearly marked for size 9-12. I'm a size 6 so I was pretty frustrated. They still fit with some compression but would have preferred knowing what size I was truly ordering before purchasing."
2.0,These WILL bunch up. The material is nothing special so I still go back to something else.
2.0,I ordered Masks with the picture and the text. They came with the picture bigger than I wanted and the text was not there. The masks are advertisements for my books. These masks don't tell people where they can purchase the books. I'm very disappointed.
2.0,Cheap material and cheaply made top like a 5t while shorts a 3t
2.0,Rips off a little everytime you move your legs
2.0,I ordered this because it said and the pictures showed it lights up... it has no means to light up.  Ripped off!
2.0,"I've been buying Russel Athletic sweat shirts for years, and this one is thinner, cheaper feeling, than the last ones I purchase from my local sporting goods store.  This shirt is acceptable, but not as warm as the other shirts I've purchase ... OK for warmer days, but not for the colder days we sometimes get."
2.0,"This is a very gorgeous dress! I only wish that it would fit. It runs at least two sizes smaller than the chart states. Again, after reading all reviews and seeing photos I chose to size up but it was not enough. Great dress, great value though."
2.0,The sleeves on this are super weird. The fit is ok otherwise but definitely not as cute in person.
2.0,The dress was a nice style and looked okay but ist really is cheap. I got it to wear to a Roaring Twenties party and that is the only time I will be able to wear it.
2.0,"Everything but the shoulders fit, i’ll make it work on for the small time frame i have though"
2.0,The dress was too short and does not fit as full shown. Runs small and short. Didn't look as good it does in picture.
2.0,"The ring on the strap came off the first time I washed it, before I had even worn it. Super disappointing."
2.0,THe braclet does not accomadate the size of my hair tie so I must twist it to fit. But I love theconcept of having a place for it when I swim or just need your hair pulled back
2.0,To small in the bust area and sleeves were short from my under arm...love the color and material but didn't fit properly. :(
2.0,Cute earrings but they broke after day 2.
2.0,Works ok. Just not real high quality. I wore three times and they got kinda foggy. I cleaned but still foggy.
2.0,I ordered an XL knowing it woukd run small. When it came out of the pkg it looked like a dress for my 4 yr old granddaughter!  Very disappointed.
2.0,"Loved the dress and fit. After first wear, the material started to pill. After first wash, faded tremendously. I’m disappointed in overall quality."
2.0,"Return window closed on Jan 31, 2019<br />After 2 months the loop to hold belt leg after buckle broke and the belt in general looks like a belt I have had for years"
2.0,"Fit at expected, but poor quality."
2.0,Very pretty in the picture but cheaply made.
2.0,This necklace is a lot bigger than I expected.  The low rating is for the quality of the item.  I know this was very inexpensive and you get what you pay for.  The beads were falling off as soon as I opened the package.
2.0,Idk why you would not just sell in a pair. That’s pretty pointless. But good product none the less.
2.0,The fabric is what I expected but the size was way off...too small! XXL was more like a Medium.
2.0,"I have used Theraderm for about 10 years. I liked the idea of a tinted face cream for some color in the winter. My problem has been that no matter how much I shake, knead or squeeze the tube I still get clearish liquid coming out first, which has wasted a lot of the cream.  I am still trying and then mixing the colored cream with my Theraderm moisturizer.  Won't be buying again."
2.0,The material was very thin yet soft.  I didn’t like that the end of the shirt got really distorted after the first wash.
2.0,Feel free to size down.  item does come bigger.  Also the buttons don't snap.  Both sides came the same so I was not able to button them up.
2.0,"I have a 14 yr old that has the body of a 11/12 year old, 5ft and 87 lbs.  I got the 14/16 so he could grow into them....what a crock.  They were so small he could barely get them on and needed help getting them off!"
2.0,Crystal falls out of nose studs very easily. It’s a nice piece but the crystal isn’t pressed in good enough. This is the second one I’ve bought and it’s the second time the crystal has fallen out.
2.0,The fabric is awful. It looks like a dish towel up close.
2.0,"I purchased a similar cardigan from the same manufacturer and I love it, especially the way it fits. This one was much bigger and just didn't look right. I returned it."
2.0,"I thought it was my old eyes, so I gave it to both my daughters to read for their opinions.  They both said the same thing - it's very hard to read."
2.0,"The material is very thick and heavy and because there is so much of it, it is much to warm to wear in the summer. It also runs very large and has a very frumpy cut, not flattering at all."
2.0,"Not what I expected, the shoe I ordered was an 8 when I received them it was more like a 7 to 7 1/2."
2.0,"the sweater looks nice upon arrival, but the left jacket pocket had a hole in it... don't wanna go through the hassle of sending it back, I guess I'll pull out the needle and thread!!!!!"
2.0,To small for extra large .
2.0,"Very cute and cozy, I bought them in the summer for a great price so just started wearing them recently. Yes cute and cozy but they do not wash well. I will be lucky if they make it through the winter. They are falling apart after every wash. They will be see through by Spring!"
2.0,"Pretty bra, runs a little small in the band size (I like to wear my bras 2-3 hooks in), cup size true. However I wore it once, handwashed it, hung it up to dry. The next time I went to wear it one of the eye hooks was broken. I bought this color especially for a dress I have that you can sometimes see my bra straps and this is almost the exact same color but now the bra is worthless. I paid a lot of money to wear it once. 4 stars because it was pretty on and made my breast look good. 0 stars for craftmanship = 2 star rating. Would not recommend"
2.0,Arrived with a few crystals missing so I was disappointed and am returning for another pair.
2.0,"Followed the guide for finding the right fit, but they turned out to be too small."
2.0,"I'm 33&#34; and got the M/L, it was like wearing a boat sail, hard to tie around my waist and I can't imagine working out in these."
2.0,Made very cheap ! It’s like a trash bag with a tie!
2.0,The material was of very poor quality. The style was not what was described in the listing.
2.0,El logo venía despegado la caja en muy mal estado parecían usados
2.0,"i never wear them, wish I hadn't bought them"
2.0,Run very small and low quality
2.0,Didnt really fit or say on they kept fallin😭 they look fake. :(  looked like a horse mouth+😂 lmao!
2.0,"Although it is cute. The lace was cheap looking. I’m usually a large but ordered an xlarge, glad I did. Otherwise I’d probably be returning. Even though I’m not impressed with it, it will be fine under a cardigan or blazer"
2.0,"My 91 year old Mom wanted a shirt that said ""Merry Christmas"" and liked this shirt except it was way too large for her even though it said size Small."
2.0,"These MISSJOY High Waist Yoga Pants with Pockets Soft Stretchy Active Yoga Leggings Tummy Control missed the mark.  First, the good part.  Phone pockets!  I love a yoga/legging with a phone pocket for working out so that I can go for a run or walk without having to carry my phone in my hand.  This way it doesn't slip out of my sweaty hands.  That's why this got 2 stars.  However, for everything else, I can't see myself ever realistically using these for exercise.  First of all, as a 5'10"" tall woman, these hit me at my mid-calf, so they look more like capris than a 7/8 legging, which is what the picture looks like.  These are stiff and don't really have a great stretch.  However, they aren't really great at tummy control or support.  Additionally, these are not high waisted.  I understand that I have a long torso, but most of my quality HW leggings stretch and hold to my torso.  These did not.  They sit below my belly button and do nothing for tummy control.  If I were to pull these up, they'd just slide down and give hella camel toe.  These are also not squat proof, which is a fancy term for they will be see-thru if you wore things to a yoga class or out running.  Therefore, I would say there other HW yoga/running leggings out there worth your time."
2.0,This dress was beautiful but it was just too tight on the arms even below my elbows
2.0,"Had to send them back once because they were not even close to the size they say, for a bigger size and now have to break out the sewing machine to adjust them because I'm spilling out of the top of them."
2.0,Ordered 2 sizes up. Still not loose. Pretty color and soft material but a bit thin.
2.0,"fits the way the arms are supposed to but length wise it fits more like a t shirt it stops just above my butt not past my butt like the photo predicts it would. thong fit perfectly, great material id recommend you order 1 size up"
2.0,"Nice price....well not really, two of them broke before I got to try them on."
2.0,I ordered several of these head wraps and found the cheapest ones were the most flattering. This is way too expensive for what it is. I should’ve returned it.
2.0,China quality. Look like they're painted this color.
2.0,Shirt gets smaller around the belly. Hard to stretch out to make bigger. The material is already looking faded and cheap after only one wash.
2.0,"I am 5'5, so pretty average height. These sweats were short on me when I bought them and after washing them, they are way too short. Will be donating them to someone."
2.0,Material is very very soft
2.0,The top part didn't come down to my waist. It just came down right under my boobs. On the model it looks as if it should hit my waist and then flow down.
2.0,Arrived bent and dented.
2.0,"I loved the sleeves and the general look of the dress, but the neckline was a strange sort of angular v-shape that was not flattering enough to justify the cost of this dress for me.  I returned this dress."
2.0,Its not as long as pictured. Its short and wide. Returning it
2.0,Hate cheap things? avoid this
2.0,I love a simple conservative dress for work. Unfortunately this is just not flaterring. It would have worked good when I was pregnant with my twins 😬
2.0,"Unfortunately this headband runs very small. It's extremely tight around my head. It barely covers the very top of my ears, and half of my forehead. The woman pictured wearing the headband must be very petite. The headband I received is so much smaller. If you are above average height and have thick hair, this band will be too small for you. The manufacturer would sell more headbands if it were made in 2-3 sizes."
2.0,the one i got was way to big for some reason<br />i was shooting for a 14-16 this thing came in a 4xxxl and it has to be a 18-20 its much to big<br />i don't think my wife will ever wear it and i'm not much on returning stuff so i'm just stuck with it whatever
2.0,"I got this for my partner who wears a 32/34, these pants are more like a child's size and most definitely does not fit a man, they were incredibly short and extremely tight. I will say that the fabric was nice quality and the pants themselves were really nice it's just very unfortunate that these run extremely small!"
2.0,"These are great in concept, but the laces were too small to fit my size 10 shoe. Overall length was incredibly short, very disappointing."
2.0,The mask is very hard and the fur covers up part of the eyes. The holes to see are not lined up and are partical covered by the red netting. It was almost impossible to see as it came. He removed the red netting and clipped off some of the fur around the eyes to make it work better.
2.0,"I do not like this dress. I would hae to wear a fill body slip underneath to be able to wear in public. But even then, it would likely still show my slip underneath. Also, the material is very slick and has a lot of static. It does fit as expected. If only it was made with different material. I will be passing this one along to someone else."
2.0,Way bigger than I thought it would be I’m about the models size and got the smallest possible. Still didn’t fit right also was see through
2.0,Very small like little children  :(
2.0,2xl fit like a large.  At least the wife is happy she got the shirt. Material is good thick cotton.
2.0,"I didn't expect great quality for the few bucks I spent, but breaking the first day a wore it was a tad disappointing. Its very nice though so I shall try to fix the darn toggle that holds it on my wrist."
2.0,"Boob squisher!!! These look great online but when I put it on, my breasts were flattened! I don't need that. I'm a 36B and the large didn't work for me."
2.0,Wanted to use the lenses for my Spider-Man costume that I'm making but they were too small to fit.. cool glasses for kids otherwise.
2.0,"These boots are nothing like they look in the picture.  Actually they look cheap, feel cheap and are cheap material.  I understand why the price."
2.0,These pants did not come with any tags. They are tight in the legs and big at the waist. They also smell awful. I am returning them.
2.0,"The fit of the shirt is good. However, the print is way smaller then pictured or described. I only ordered a large. It is also oval shaped instead of circular."
2.0,"I bought this ring for xmas and loved it.  I loved the size and thought it looked really nice on my finger. However, after wearing it a few times the stone fell out. I was very disappointed. So I have decided to send it back."
2.0,Se ensucia con facilidad y algunas partes cambian de color luego de pocos usos
2.0,"This is a lovely bag.  But the measurements are misleading because the top is quite a bit narrower than the bottom.  The strap was rather long and the end curled when I shortened it.  More of a problem was that both sides of the strap were made from some kind of sticky material (maybe old plastic?  I don't know).  I happened to have an old strap that I substituted, but I would've returned the bag otherwise."
2.0,"I returned this, a medium would fit a 6 yr old an no larger size avaible"
2.0,It's very unique but not well designed. Each point has very loose fabric that will absolutely tear off in 2 mph wind. It was sent is a glorified envelope without protection.
2.0,Had to return. Ran small
2.0,Doesn't work good for night sweats.
2.0,This watch is just so pretty.. However after 2 wears the strap broke.<br />I was very upset because it’s very pretty to look at and it was making its way up to being on of my favorites.
2.0,"I love the color, but the item was defective. The clamp in closure was too short to be used. It wasn't long enough to be used."
2.0,dont like quality of style on inspection
2.0,Was not what I expected it to be when I got it. The proportions were different then it looked in the picture Pro was bigger and the chain cement like a gumball machine chain
2.0,Too small and uncomfortable for my 6 year old
2.0,It looks nice but once installed the pin makes a clicking sound when the buckle is moved. It seams like the pin is not seated well in the buckle hole. I was very disappointed with this because I put this on a custom leather band and it looks good but does not function well.
2.0,Order a size up. It was a bit tight in the arms and shoulder area. Also the shirt is much more sheer than it looks like in the picture; it definitely needs an undershirt.
2.0,The frame is too tight and the arms are flimsy; only using for cycling as dirt shield so ok for $12.
2.0,"The metal on the claso matches the watch band and isn't rose gold like the face, which was disappointing. The band also doesn't like to stay put under the fasteners, even though there is two of them. Pay a few more dollars and get a better version."
2.0,"Very disapointed in the Russell zip front sweatshirt<br />The zipper did not lay flat even before washing - it stuck out from the sweatshirt in an odd way.<br />Sweatshirt shrunk A LOT after washing, and now the zipper is even worse.<br />Fabric is soft and a good weight."
2.0,Dont know what the material is but it's cheap. Bought for my daughter as a Christmas present. This is a good example of why it's best to buy clothes at a local store
2.0,No happy with the sizing. Really small.
2.0,"Unusable. Was in a large padded Manila envelope buuuuut was folded when packaged OOPS. I’ve used Magic Billiards Racks with my pool team and wanted one of my own. They make racking the balls much easier, simply letting the cut outs guide you, and keeps them touching. Do recommend them when stored properly."
2.0,Light weight. Good for one night out.
2.0,"This was a lot larger than any photo appeared, it was fairly cheap quality... No that I expected and the latch will fall open and the charms can just fall off."
2.0,These socks dont feel like they are the 20-30mcg. Also I feel very little support from the compression which is the main reason i purchased them.
2.0,Super cute. The inside is a knitted cross cross pattern and uncomfortable
2.0,WRONG COLOR -- its beige and not brown.
2.0,It fit around my arms and everything but was way to short your could see my bra
2.0,I am not gifted in the bust area and this was very unflattering on me so I decided to return
2.0,la pagina me dijo que me serviria un  size 8 1/2 pero realmente es 8.
2.0,"**The nose piece is not adjustable.** And therefore, I’m pretty disappointed with these. Other people may find them fairly comfortable, especially if they have wide set eyes. I wish I could return them after one use."
2.0,I will probably end up keeping them bc I'm out of time to find an alternate.  The first pair I ordered which should have fit per he sizing was way to loose. I sent those back and ordered side down which fits okay however the zipper pouch they came in looks like it's been through some rough times and one of the shoes has a stain on it... would not recommend ordering unless you like a gamble.  They are nice and flexible though and should pack easily.
2.0,Looked good online but when I tried it on it was small and fit lopsided. Quality was poor. Would not purchase from this customer again.
2.0,Not what I expected. The model in the image is wearing the Tiffany small heart tags but my order was mini. Way smaller than expected. Tiffany makes small and mini heart tags. This is the mini version.
2.0,Order a men's medium. It's more like a men's small. No tie. I only received shirt and shorts.
2.0,Fits awkward not impressed at all
2.0,These wore out fast! Within 2 weeks they looked like they saw one too many playgrounds.
2.0,"Anyone wishing to order the Mama shirt will be disappointed, as you will receive a shirt that reads “Mamaw”.  Graphic is pretty but very stiff..returned for a refund"
2.0,Too big for my husband
2.0,The picture of the dog doesn't stand out on the ring like it looks in the picture. And the writing on the sides is way too small.
2.0,The material is not a good one. Very light and you can almost see through the black! I won't recommend it to anhyone to buy this dress.
2.0,They are nice but realistically there is no way they fit any baby.  They run way to small
2.0,Back doesn't stay on very well. Doesn't wrap around top of ear and stay well either.
2.0,I bought two of these and both were more cheap looking than I was looking for. Would be really cute or a beach cover-up.
2.0,I don't know what it was but the scarf smelled horrible when it arrived. It smelled like really bad incense. I had to wash it a couple of times to get the odor out.
2.0,Dislike the cut level between the pattern and solid color. Was too high to fit well.
2.0,I have worn it like five times and the sliver clasp keeps coming off.
2.0,Not durable.  My son wanted this and it broke within 2 weeks.
2.0,3 of the 5 are noticeably smaller!!!!  Very disappointed!!!!
2.0,Had it two weeks and broke already
2.0,Too small didn't fit
2.0,Looks like a dress pocket make it flair out on the sides.  Just not what I was expecting.
2.0,"It could be better, I had it for a week and the paint was already wearing off. I paid way to much for it."
2.0,Fabric was cheap. I didn’t like it. Doesn’t look like they picture...maybe she has a better figure than me. ;)<br /><br />I liked the color. Got Red & light blue. Red was better
2.0,These are not as described. They are not anti-fog. They are not blue light reducing. They are clear plastic glasses that catch the glare of light in the corner of the frames and make you think there is something there that is not. I ordered them to replace the plastic shield I have to wear as a nurse at work. They are a bit tight on the frames and hurt behind my ears. Not very comfortable to wear. Do fog less than some of the other ones I have but diffidently not anti-fog.
2.0,They don’t stay in your heel.
2.0,Nice looking ring but please keep in mind the picture that you see online is extremely magnified. It looks much smaller on your hand it even looks small as a pinky ring. Other than that it looks nice. My biggest complaint and only complaint related besides the perception I had of the size was that I asked for a size 10 (The invoice even said size 10) however they gave me a size 9..... I don’t know how you messed something like that up.  Regardless rather than the return of the week for the new room which took about a week to get here maybe a little less I went to the jewelry store and had it done for 50 bucks which sucks but what are you Gonna do.
2.0,Nice but looks like it will tarnish after a couple uses so I'll wear it en then toss heavy too but I don't mind
2.0,Seems flimsy.
2.0,The coat was very nice but way too small. It fit like a medium and I ordered an XXL.
2.0,"Nice shirt, really comfortable but shedding wayyyy to much!! No worth it"
2.0,The very first band I used broke while trying to put it on. You get what you pay for I guess.
2.0,"This item runs small, so please order three sizes larger, a chart showing sizes would be helpful"
2.0,It's a compression shirt plain and simple but I've bought more comfortable ones from Walmart and paid less. Didn't like the feel of this.
2.0,They look cool but they broke the first time I wore them
2.0,"Two days of normal wear and the painted buckle is chipped and scratched.  I'm retired, not doing any hard lobar or anything just normal wear. Other than that I like the belt webbing and closure, just wish the buckle held up a little better."
2.0,"Maybe I expected too much but, the thorns on my tree were way too big to not go through these. Maybe they work better on smaller thorns."
2.0,"No problems with the watch, but was surprised with an additional customs fee from FedEx. Should have stated this before I got this surprise. Maybe buying from overseas wasn't a wise choice, if I would have known."
2.0,the material is so itchy....dont like it at all
2.0,I bought this for my son for Christmas.  The zipper was stiff so I just thought he needed to break it in . The zipper breaks apart all the time . I wouldn't recommend . Its very cool and he loves it . So if your willing to get a new zipper put on then you'll love it too .
2.0,Much larger than I thought they would be.
2.0,"Too heavy to carry,"
2.0,"They are cute but very poor quality, cheaply made and slide off your face. I would not recommend purchasing these."
2.0,Made my boots too tight.
2.0,Don't stay on ears
2.0,"This is a cute looking dress in the Amazon pictures. But not for me. I do not like the material at all and it makes too much noise. Some polyester clothing is ok but I don’t like this one, definitely will not breathe. The sizing was too big for me. I ordered a small and it was too loose on my 26” waist. It sagged around my 32” bust area. I felt the shoulder area made me look too wide. Sending it back."
2.0,"This dress was a weird fit, the pockets made the dress flow out at the hips and it wasn't flattering. I liked the length and the top, but the pockets ruined it. I have to return."
2.0,Lights dont work in areas after one wear
2.0,"Very small, fits a kid"
2.0,"Cute necklace design, but I after wearing it once it has turned the gold into a bronze-ish type of look. So I don’t even consider wearing anymore.😪"
2.0,Cute style but the quality is poorly. Get what you pay for. Fit is a little body but okay. I kept it but would not purchase again.
2.0,They are huge!
2.0,"Bought this for my granddaughter in a 9-10 yr. L this is definitely not a child large more like a woman L or even bigger it is however, a really cute shirt for someone."
2.0,These run small and the waist sits too low. The material is not very soft and they look cheaply made.
2.0,This band is very thin and for me it would not look good on any watch other that a small dress watch. Returned
2.0,"They’re pretty but it’s almost impossible to attach to the belt, even when getting someone else to help."
2.0,"Very sheer material, doesn't flare like shown in picture"
2.0,The product is okay but the length is a little short and the fit is not a tight as other brands I have worn.
2.0,This was bright pink instead of coral. It is made out of very cheap material that wrinkles very easily.
2.0,The fabric of this shirt looks nothing like the picture.
2.0,"The earrings are overall not terrible...which is the only reason I gave this two stars...definitely not the most durable earrings...but that is expected given the price. However, they were poorly packaged and severely bent (not only the posts but the snowflake itself). I was able to somewhat reshape them by heating them with a blow dryer as instructed by the seller. They could have better packaged them to protect them. When I contacted the seller, I was basically told it was an easy fix and they were apologetic about the condition they arrived...this seems to be a pattern and something they have been previously told by previous sellers based on the reviews."
2.0,"Doesn't hold shape well, finish scratches easily."
2.0,"Its not the best. It works so-so. Thus, 2 stars."
2.0,Worth what I paid
2.0,Super unflattering if you're not really skinny. I'm average with hips and it just makes me look like a box.
2.0,The quality was not great. But I guess you get what you pay for. The top was too big and bottom was too small and I am average build. I returned it right away.
2.0,"Very cheaply made.  While convenient, they don't fit right at the bridge of the nose.  Also, the gold colored caps at the end of the glasses promptly fell off upon opening the glasses.  I ordered three pairs and this happened to all."
2.0,"I was initially so pleased with this wallet - the size is perfect - it fits in my bag but I can easily use it alone as a wristlet. It has perfect compartments for all of my cards, checkbook and money. It appears that my phone would also fit, but unfortunately I never got to really use it.  The first one I ordered had a stain, which looked as if some dye had run or dripped on the inside of the wallet. I ordered a replacement and when I opened the box, immediately saw that the zipper wasn't stitched properly and was coming apart from the wallet.  I'm so disappointed because I looked long and hard to find a wallet that could hold everything as well as having RFID protection. It also looks great, love the color etc. It's too bad the quality control is so poor - anyone could clearly see these (not minor) flaws. Neither of these wallets should have passed inspection. Oddly, they put a nice effort into the packaging which is very nicely done,  It's too bad the same effort wasn't put into the product itself. I'm tempted to try a third time, because the wallet is otherwise perfect for what I need, but don't think I will."
2.0,Great for someone with a tiny torso.
2.0,Not a great fit very loose thought the product would be more elastic and spandex
2.0,"So I got the shirt yesterday and was so excited to wear it! I put it on today and literally the stitching was coming out on the shirt. Made super cheap, and such a disappointment!"
2.0,Every S I've XS
2.0,"Runs small, see through fabric, no liner"
2.0,Way to material at the ankles. It bunches up. Cheaply made. Its cute.
2.0,"I wore this once for a 30 min bike ride and 1 hour bouldering and it already has a hole near the seams on the back. Fits well for me, I’m 5’6” and 123 lbs. Quality is NOT what I expected."
2.0,"The fabric is ok, the print is ok, the style is not very flattering."
2.0,"The shoulder bag is what I bought, 1 red and 1 black. Even tough it was only $4.99 each, it is not worth it. Very cheap quality and it is made of rexine material. I will not buy this again. I would pay $10 and buy something that looks good and feels good to carry outside."
2.0,"They were very small.  I had ordered them as a gift for a first Communion .  I thought they would be bigger, so have ordered a bigger size."
2.0,Bought set for grandson since picture shows family with boys wearing set that had crew neck. Pajamas that I received had a scoop-neck.
2.0,These are just too big for my liking. They got caught on everything and I lost one the first day.
2.0,"Love the style and color, but that's about it.  The skirt material is very heavy and cut too large, so it weighed me down and made me look heavier. Had to return."
2.0,The shorts were nice but run small in sizing
2.0,very poorly made product.
2.0,I ordered the size 36 for men thinking that it would fit my size 28 female wasit and it would leave room for growth however the size did not even fit me. If i had to order this for my husand I would have to get almost 3 sizes bigger to fit him. The belt is thick and does have the 100% leather stamp on it but in terms of how it feels to wear it I cannot say because I cant fit .
2.0,"I couldn't wear it, it is kind of tight on top of my foot and It didn't fit right and I was going to return it but I decided to make it a gift for someone for Christmas."
2.0,"I ordered these hoping for a smaller fit. I received them in the mail. One of the pairs was the wrong size, and the material seemed cheap and scratchy. I definitely wouldn't recommend these."
2.0,Way too tiny to have to deal with this item.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:eb70384a0932c64a4ec06de0fc05330d]] I ordered two long sleeve shirts like this and I love them they are my go-to tops. However the short sleeve one disappointed me. It looks like a pajama top. I'm not a fan.
2.0,turns to quickly
2.0,"Not durable in the least. The eyes fell out after I was wearing for a month. The only thing good about this product is it was cheap, you get what you pay for. I would have asked for a refund but could not be bothered."
2.0,Not very sturdy.  Fell apart quickly.
2.0,runs too small. i ordered for my 5 yo and it could only fit my 1.5 yo.
2.0,"Sizing is way off, description said XL was a 12, but when they arrived they were clearly marked by the manufacturer as 10-11.5.  Sure enough my husbands size twelve feet did not fit in these.  He wears a solid 12 in every pair of footwear he owns so if these were truly a 12 as the shipper continues to insist they are why do they not fit?"
2.0,SHIRT WAS NOT AS DESCRIBED
2.0,"this was purchased as gift. had hole in the front, size of a dime. my wife sewed. hopefully it will last."
2.0,I like the band but it's already turning silver
2.0,Very beautiful but it will tarnish so easy. After wearing it for the first time my finger was green and the ring was turning colors s well. Horribly
2.0,"I attempted to wear these socks yesterday, for the first time and couldn’t. I was able to put them on, with another person’s assistance and with a lot of effort. They were tight and barely stretched. I couldn’t keep them on because I was too uncomfortable.<br />Also, they seem to be disproportionate; the front almost went over my toes, which would defeat the purpose...<br />I have another pair of these socks and they are not as tight. They fit me well. This new pair, on the other hand, was very disappointing."
2.0,"The color is beautiful, but the material is very cheap. Also, the collar looks asymmetrical in the picture, that was one of the things I liked most. The collar is actually symmetrical in person. It also fit a little large. I ordered a Medium, I'm 5'7&#34; 135lbs. I'm returning it."
2.0,Multiple pairs got holes in them my first time washing/wearing them
2.0,Cute but it runs small and I had to return it.
2.0,There are better selections I’d pass on this one
2.0,"Got it as a gift. Looks great, but stopped working after about 2 dozen uses. I took the cover off of it to see if I could isolate the problem but no luck. It'd basically just try to light, I could hear the click and the hiss of the fuel, and nothing. Oddly enough it'd hold a flame after it appeared to have used up all the fuel, right before being totally out.<br /><br />For a brand new torch, that sucks pretty badly. Hopefully that's just a fluke as I don't typically believe things like this are just made to fail, but I'm not getting another from Vector now that I've been burned once already (see what I did there? LOOOOOL)"
2.0,"I am 5ft and 118lbs, ordered a Medium and its very big on me, plus the lace isnt as nice as it looks on the screen. Had to return :("
2.0,Ran way to small in the arms so I gifted it
2.0,Not the length promised
2.0,Way too big! I’m 5’2” and the arms don’t even touch my head! Sending these back.
2.0,Had to return. I ordered a small so I couldn't return it for a smaller size. It should have been large. This is a cute dress but just didn't fit.
2.0,"I liked the color of the dress, but felt that the material was too thin to wear to work. Also, the styling just didn't work for me."
2.0,"The ring is nice, but it doesn’t glow it the dark. That’s really upsetting."
2.0,The quality is cheap. I returned
2.0,"After waiting for a long time I finally got the necklace. I was very Disappointed, very flimsy not long or big enough ."
2.0,"Product is functional. Overlooked in the fine print, that this U.S. Military item is produced and shipped from China (no concerns about Chinese products, I just should have caught this.) The MP Emblem is printed on top of the material, and this decreases the aesthetic appeal. All said, this mask is functional, just not what I was expecting."
2.0,"This is a noticeably fake pearl, unlike what the picture shows. It is big and clunky. Also, the card I received does not say the exact thing as the picture. Not great."
2.0,Pretty dress in pictures.  Long and saggy in real life.  I'm 5 9 and 160. The package said size xl. Fit  good.  RIP in the bust where the material turns to lace.  Returned.
2.0,"One arrived with a hole in the ankle right in the seam but I wore them with boots so I said 'eh whatever', then got another hole a couple weeks later in the upper thigh. That area doesn't really stretch so not sure how it happened! Also very see through for me, you could see the tag on my butt."
2.0,I liked it when it arrived even if it looked a little cheap.<br />I didn't like it when it broke and couldn't be fixed.
2.0,"Simply hate it, despite buying a size  bigger."
2.0,"Very tiny bag and bulky for over $100, not worth it"
2.0,I got this for a vacation.  Wasn't able to wear it.  It was extremely small for a 2XL.
2.0,Color is not as shown it looks black but it really is a navy blue . The shirt is also not a good fit just a basic t shirt from the store .
2.0,"Not what I am wearing right now. Pretty, but this doesn't look like mine."
2.0,"These jeans look awesome, but unfortunately I returned mine. I'm 5 feet tall, weigh about 120 lbs, and have a 28 inch waist. I first bought the size S hoping they ran large. Turns out the size S is more for people who wear size 1 or size 3 in pants (and I'm a size 5). Then I exchanged them for the size M and they were still a little tight on me, but not so tight that I'd consider myself a size L in these pants. The thing is, the denim is thick and not that stretchy. Lifting my legs up put strain on the pant legs and crotch areas. Plus, they're not as high-waisted as I'd like, so I was muffin-topping. To their credit, they look really cool and seem durable, but alas, the cons outweighed the pros and I returned them."
2.0,"I am 5'8"" and take size 32 32 the length is perfect but the waist is tight and from the back end it looks like girls pants because it hugs my a$$ other than that there alright"
2.0,I was looking foa a bigger bag
2.0,"3 bracelets arrived damaged and not working. 2 others were not in the best shape, plastic ripped, led off center."
2.0,"I've purchased similar belts from a different vendor in the past and have loved them. Those are adjusted by means of a metal loop that lies flat. This batch has a metal clasp that sticks out a bit, and I find it pretty uncomfortable. Unfortunately I tossed the packaging before I realized this, so I can't return them. But I'd recommend getting the other kind of adjuster--much more comfortable for just a little more money."
2.0,Shoe is okay. Is not a true white but off white.
2.0,"These glasses were super cute on my toddler.  I loved the mirrored lenses. However, the two-star review is due to the fact that they lasted only about a month and maybe 5 times of gentle wear before the plastic piece broke that holds the screw in place. It is not possible to fix them. Very disappointed."
2.0,"I WEAR SIZE 16 PANTS-WANTED ELASTIC WAIST FOR COMFORT, ROUND THE HOUSE, PULL UP SLACKS.  THESE FIT AS IF THE FRONT AND BACK WERE SAME WHERE IT FEELS I HAVE THEM ON BACKWARDS BUT DON'T.  THE RATE FEATURES DOESN'T ILLUSTRATE MY ISSUE."
2.0,"The main reason I got these suspenders was the Union Jack design.  The quality is not the best.  The leather parts that attach to the buttons on your pants is very thin and weak.  I was going through a door backward because my hands were full.  The leather somehow got caught on the door knob and with very little effort, the leather broke."
2.0,"As far as looks go, these are very cute. Comfortable as well, but can't say much for the quality of them. 2 stars only due to the fact that it was made very cheap and say 1 started unravelling. It's knitted so hard to stop from unravelling any further. It's hidden in boots so I just wear them."
2.0,"After 3 wears, the usb attached to the shoes broke!!"
2.0,"I’ve bought these in the past and loved them. Still have one pair actually. But my last two orders haven’t held up (one original one replacement) I lost a gold earring as a result. I thought the first was a fluke but am pretty infuriated it happened a second time. I’d caution those against using them on expensive earrings, which is why I purchased them in the first place"
2.0,The costume’s suspenders weren’t attached to the suit itself which left it for an odd fit for a man’s suit. It was bought for a man who usually wears large in inclusive sizing and i was very shocked to find out the xL didn’t fit well. Ended up returning because the fit was poor… also there were no pockets??
2.0,"Can't use them at all.  The lenses are too small, I guess, so when I find the right spot for looking at something in focus, I can't shift my eye even the tiniest bit and still see clearly.  It's like looking through a pinhole.  If I want to read the next word, I have to turn my whole head and keep looking through the one tiny spot where the page is still in focus.  I've been able to adapt well to other progressive lenses, but these are simply not usable."
2.0,"Like the shirt, it was just too small.  Returned."
2.0,Mkar sure you go up a siz when ordering because it runs small.  Material ok.. but disappointed in the fit
2.0,"I purchased the recommended size 3x, based on my measurements.  They fit but feel like tight shapewear instead of underwear.  I purchased another style in the same size and they are fine.  I would not even feel comfortable purchasing these in one size larger as I think they would be too small as well.  They are  well made so I gave these 2 stars instead of onee"
2.0,Had this delivered to my hotel room.  Did not like this at all.  Top did not adequately cover the breasts even though it was too big.  Om a c cup. Crochet material for the top was hard.  Would definitely need nipple covers for protection.  Was very disappointed.  Didnt even bother to bring it home.
2.0,"I'm sure these work but they're are very stiff, and move off the nose when you talk. Not great for any kind of long-term wearability throughout the day."
2.0,I usually wear a size large. I van usually wear One Size fits all..but these were just not the same. The fabric is very thin. The waist part doesn't had any added elastic or reinforcement. I had to keep pulling them up even just walking. I do have large thighs. So I can't really blame these leggings for being a little snug on the thighs. But just a warning to any other bigger thigh/hipped customers. These don't reinforce or &#34;hold in&#34; anything. I wish these were a thicker material with a stronger waistline. Maybe after I lose a few pounds these will work. But you get what you pay for. The green splatter design is very pretty though. They look just like the picture. I think these would be nice for anyone who wears s size small and possibly for those in medium. But large or x-large probably not so much.
2.0,As for size-deceiving-gave it to my smaller in size granddgt
2.0,I’m so embarrassed. Ordered this as a gift for a friend across the country and when it arrived it had fallen apart. It looks pretty from what she sent me but obviously not wearable.
2.0,The middle part Is all scrunched up And you can’t hide them I really wanted to love this dress but unfortunately it’s a big no because it made me look like a sack of potatoes
2.0,This fit well and looked like the picture. The problem is that it was very poor quality and fell apart the second time I tried it on. It now has 8 inch gaps along the seams down both sides of the dress. Guess I need to break out my sewing kit :/
2.0,"Nice quality ties, just wasn't the same pattern as the picture"
2.0,Washed in cold water and hung to dry and still shrunk.  Thanks but no thanks.  Gave it away.
2.0,"Sigh! I was so excited about this swimsuit. I've lost weight & I wanted a sexy swimsuit. This was going to be a great compromise.... because I don't like my stomach especially after having a baby. This swimsuit does do a great job concealing your stomach but still showing a little extra skin. I am short, BUT this swim suit is made more a VERY SHORT person or someone with a VERY short Torso. I ordered an XL... I knew I had to order a much larger size, but it still wasn't enough.. I am 5'2 I weigh 140 lbs. So maybe if weighed 10  or 15 lbs less it would fit better, but I don't think it would be Long enough.<br /><br />So if you have a long torso... don't get this suit.<br /><br />if you have Very Short torso, this is the suit for you.<br /><br />oh yeah, the bottom part doesn't have a lot of give.<br /><br />I had already planned on wearing this with a race-back bra for support. So, I can't tell if this suit would be supportive enough or not. I need more support than the average person."
2.0,Cheap. The colors are not pretty and vibrant.  It's very blah. Disappointed.
2.0,Not near the size it's supposed to be runs very small
2.0,I love this bag but the mesh is ripping away from the seam. I wouldn’t buy again.
2.0,Fits was disappointing
2.0,Solid plastic mask.  Very hard plastic.  Nice big foam cushion for comfort.  BUT!!!  Very cheap and flimsy elastic strap.  Opened box and strap was already broken and detached from right slot of mask.  Left side attachment looks like it will come apart.  Both sides can be tied up or replaced with new and more durable strap.
2.0,Zipper kinda flimsy
2.0,Good color and design. But it was not able to return for a large size even I order 2 vest.  but different color both does not fit. Still possible to exchange. for large size? Please let know
2.0,The dress is cute but unfortunately the lining of the skirt is VERY short...to short to wear. I had to send it back
2.0,Too small. Contacted company inquiring about larger size . No response
2.0,"these don't hold up in the wash at all, they shrink and fray"
2.0,Mas grande de lo esperado
2.0,Tooo small... thought it would be bigger
2.0,"It came in a little bag, took the belly ring out and it was already broken. I suppose it is still wearable but I am not very happy about the quality of the it."
2.0,i ordered larger than my size and still small
2.0,"I was happy to be getting shoes that I expected would be wonderful. With this type of shoe I wear padded walking socks and therefore I get 1/2 size bigger. I usually buy Nunn Bush and they are fine.  When I got the postal walking shoes there were two problems. First the top lace two-eye has openings and neither one was able to be laced. I tried an icepick and still could not get it through the material. I took them to my shoe repair shop and they had a larger icepick and finally were able to pierce the material and lace the shoes. There are other reviews where the buyer had the top double eye not able to be laced, so I was not surprised, just disappointed. Obviously New Balance quality control is lacking. When I got home the shoes were way to tight; very uncomfortable. I have worn the Nunn Bush 9 medium for years. I put my walking shoes against the New Balance and the New Balance were obviously narrower.  I am still unsure of the fit. I returned the shoes to Amazon."
2.0,"Very small, will not fit if you are large chested."
2.0,Both buttons have popped off. Have to sew  them back on.
2.0,"I purchased this band for my Fitbit in August. It quickly went from snug to loose. I had to keep pushing to up on my arm for the sensors to work. By November, it was unusable. It’s pretty, but not practical."
2.0,Sizing chart claims fits sizes 39 - 42 but would not fit me a size 40 waist. ended up gifting them to a thinner friend.<br />very disappointed.
2.0,"Too large overall. Bust is saggy as well as in the armpits. Bust line too low. Description says compression, but size is overall too large to offer any compression and material seems a little too thin to be able to offer said compression. Disappointed as I really like the colors offered. If you just want a colorful tank top that is not too tight you will be happy. If you need compression, look elsewhere."
2.0,"I thought these slippers would be like the slides that look the same, but they are not as comfy as the reviews for those state. The upper part is like vinyl, the sole is very stiff and doesn't flex well. Even though they looked enormous on my feet, they didn't fit as expected - I usually buy shoes in a EU 38, because that size gives me enough room for socks - so I ordered these in a 38/39 and my heel was right at the edge so no way could I wear a pair of socks. The lining is soft, but doesn't add any cushioning. I ended up returning them."
2.0,"The fabric seems acceptable but the image on the chest and abdomen is poor quality printing, like it’s out of focus. It’s not worth going through the trouble to return it but I won’t be purchasing anything else from Red Plume."
2.0,I have many pairs of these. Some I got a while back like almost 2 years and still going strong. Got 2 packs for my boyfriend for Christmas. All have holes already.
2.0,"The design of this sweater is great! It being one size just makes it more cripped, but my absolute least favorite part was how itchy the fabric became. The material itself is no high quality, but as the day went one the scratching of the fabric became unbearable."
2.0,It's not the best it came kind of deformed. It doesn't seem very warm.
2.0,"Buy a size larger than your regular size.  They run super small, and I had to exchange for size up."
2.0,"My daughter is 31/2 and wears a 2-4 in every other mittens, but these were way too big and &#34;puffy&#34; because she refused to wear them.  We kept them because I had ripped the tags off, but I don't think I can convince her to wear them. They are cut very large and she finds them uncomfortable.  So much for a snow purchase."
2.0,COLOR IS KIND OF DULL
2.0,Not good quality at all. But easy to return. So I have it 2 stars
2.0,"Cute , but received broken"
2.0,And it looks cheap and feels cheap and its hard to hit the side buttons with this case. I would not buy it again.
2.0,sizes waaaaayyyy too small
2.0,Not what I expected. The shirt wasn’t solid. Very sheer. Returned.
2.0,Fabric is too rough on my face. Itchy
2.0,"Pretty, but too loose.  Even large sunglasses and another pair of glasses fall right out."
2.0,Ordered this one in a 3XL knowing that it would run small and it was smaller than the 2XL I ordered from the same company. The sizes on these are way off.
2.0,Cute but pants are long.
2.0,"They are comfy and okay for sleeping or around the house.  They do not pass the ""squat test"" so make sure you wear a long shirt with them."
2.0,"Although this ring is beautiful, and looked super cute on!  I could not wear it!  I wore it for 2 days and I had small cuts around my belly button from each point on the bow.  I think the bar was too short for my piercing.  I was disappointed because it is so adorable."
2.0,Too small and weird fit. Felt like I was going to trip over them.
2.0,These pants are smaller than expected which means even if you order a size larger they may still be too small. In addition to fit my pants started to unravel at some of the seems after the first wash.
2.0,"length on torso was good, but arms way to short for my liking.  Fabric a bit scratchy"
2.0,The model is shown wearing it as a halter with two straps-a strap on each side meeting to tie in the back.  That’s how the suit is designed. It came with one strap which causes the top to have a weird gape in the middle since the two sides are forced to lay in a different position than they were originally designed for. It would have been much better fit if it was sent with both straps as it was advertised. I am returning it.
2.0,Got them less than 24hrs ago.. literally Walked 3 NYC blocks and the left heel broke. I was sooo excited about them until this happened 🙁.
2.0,The fit and material were awesome. My complaint is the design is not what was pictured. The design shown in the front of the mask on the picture was just stretched around the entire mask. The word and faces in the design were stretched and distorted. The wording is not readable when you’re actually wearing it.
2.0,Like them easily fall off though
2.0,"The glasses seem nice, but it is almost impossible getting them back into their cases."
2.0,"This necklace does not have a secure closure on the pendant that is on the chain.  So, on the first time that I wore the necklace the flip flop was lost.  The flip flop needs to be placed on an “O” ring, something that is completely closed."
2.0,More like spandex underwear than shorts.
2.0,"Thin and cheap materials which feels like it won't last long. The fit is perfect. It's been difficult to find small, fashionable belts since I have lost alot of weight. The belt is okay for the price, very cute."
2.0,Material is OK but one size fits all theory is not the best thing. It means you end up with a bigger model.
2.0,Didn’t like the material. Would have to iron it every time and the size was way too big
2.0,This bracelet is very easy to break. The chain is very flimsy and weak. It gets caught on everything.
2.0,They do not stay on.
2.0,"The band arrived on time but the product was not in an unopened package, which in my book is not considered “brand new”.  The band is in good condition but I can't give this as a gift and I can't keep it as a collector’s item.  This was very disappointing!"
2.0,"We loved the nice looking sunglasses at first. However, my son only wore the blue sunglasses 3-4 times during the a 3-week period. One arm has fallen off already. I contacted customer service and was told that &#34;it's been detached from excess force from stretching&#34; and was offered &#34;a coupon for future purchase of $3&#34;. The glass did not experience &#34;excess force from stretching&#34; at all (as you can see from the pix). My son was a very gentle kid and only used the glass occasionally, in a normal way. In fact, we live in Seattle, and he didn't have much opportunity to use the sunglasses! It's never normal for a pair of sunglasses to break in such a short time."
2.0,should of sent them back
2.0,"Liked the design and look, but once I put it on it did not want to come back off. It ended up coming apart first. Very disappointed."
2.0,Super super small.
2.0,Would work great if it was stickier. Covers nips but does not stick for long. Came off a bit during the day I wore them. I could see it through the dress I was wearing and had to keep sticking them back on.
2.0,"I bought these shoes at the end of October 2018, and started using them in early December, when it started to snow. You know, because they're supposed to be SNOW shoes. Anyway, I used them for about 15 days in December and Jan each, and most of Feb. Not that long, you'd assume. But yeah, no. The shoes have started to wear out. I stepped in a puddle yesterday that barely hit the heel of my shoe, and immediately my socks were wet. And this is Boston cold we're talking about. So yeah. Wouldn't recommend for long-term use."
2.0,it doesn't feel very durable. .. it is definitely a &#34;will do for now&#34; kind of belt.
2.0,"Doesn't fit in the chest when it fits everywhere else. The body looked great, but having it baggy on the side of the chest area (which was surprising having a large chest) made it unable to wear."
2.0,Product was too large. Seem like a Xl fits like a 3XL
2.0,zipper keeps coming down
2.0,Thin very thin uncomfortable material.
2.0,"Good as a swimsuit cover-up but not a summertime dress. Low-quality material. Slightly see-through (colored undergarments will be visible). Has a slight plastic feel. More like a low quality robe -- from the waist down, the front of the dress is actually just two overlaying pieces that will show too much with the slightest breeze."
2.0,"I think this has a weird shape.  the fabric is not flowy and the dress is too  boxy - yet puffy at the hip where the pockets are.  if you have any sort of extra baggage in the hip area, I wouldn't suggest it."
2.0,Glasses let in to much wind from the nose area had to squint to see. Don’t like at all!!
2.0,Not as described. Not as brilliant or as deep in color
2.0,"I loved this bracelet. The description says it holds up to being wet. I've had mine for four months, and the string broke today."
2.0,"This nightgown is okay, just not as nice as I expected."
2.0,It has a weird shape to it and runs really big. I will be doing some alterations to it
2.0,Its very pretty but the color changed in one day of use.
2.0,I loved the necklace when I first opened it and then it went downhill from there. It broke before I even left my house. I managed to fix it but it broke several times in several places over the course of the day. Finally I just threw it in a trash can as I passed one because I was so frustrated!
2.0,"The blue is that shiny blue, the stitching is not the worst but certainly not good. Fit is ok"
2.0,Not sure if size was just off or the way it was made but the bust line was waaaaay too high. Fabric had zero stretch and was really itchy & uncomfortable.
2.0,"The style is great. However, the fabric is poor quality and the color is NOT as shown on Amazon. Dress also has holes. Very disappointed."
2.0,"The hoops will need to be replaced, very cheap!"
2.0,I first want to say when I got this I was excited because the jewelry itself is beautiful and sparkly... that being said... I did not think about how this was going to stay in place... I guess I just assumed it would. So I paid $20 for it and could not use it. I hope to wear it eventually but am looking for some body tape maybe... it fell all over.
2.0,I think the above says everything. I did keep the tunic but....
2.0,"Looks good and fit well, but it developed a hole just under the hem near the top after 3 weeks of use. Unfortunately, I missed the return window."
2.0,I really loved the design and the look of the bag. I ordered Gray but it had a funny greenish tint to it. Also the inside lining in the pockets was like plastic so to me it seemed kind of cheap looking. The leather look texture wasn't in my opinion that good and you could tell right away that it looked very plasticky. I was excited to get it but I was disappointed overall and sent it back. And I agree it had a very strange odor to it.
2.0,It’s cute but thinner that I thought it would be. The cats are also printed upside down
2.0,Too fake
2.0,Worlds softest socks aren’t that soft like they used to be
2.0,"Cute. Its a print on stretchy material. The design isn't aligned properly on the material. I am 6'1"". The torso cut is NOT for us. I simply re-gifted it. Very unflattering. It's prettier on my computer screen. Hope this helps!"
2.0,Does not fit the same as the three others I purchased. Material feels different & not as forgiving.
2.0,"Why I love the look of this ring (very beautiful) I was under the impression that the middle stone was 1ct while it’s next to my great grandmother’s 1ct and maybe it’s the shape but it’s just not the size I imagined it to be, however it’s still very beautiful. The edges of this ring continue to rip out my hair they are so sharp. Also my middle finger is a size 5, this ring is a 5.5 and still doesn’t slide down all the way so it runs small. Also on delivery they didn’t follow my instructions and said it was handed directly to resident and it was shoved in my neighbors mailbox."
2.0,I received the item with a broken wand.
2.0,"Comfy, but color does not match pictured item"
2.0,They did not help at all very desapointed
2.0,Did not care for handbag. Zipper opening too small. Did not care for it. Will be returning
2.0,Product is not adult size. Quality and coloring is cute but my 9 year old is still in children’s sizes and couldn’t wear them so there is no way they work for an adult woman
2.0,This is very low quality
2.0,I thought these were the magic gloves that are little and stretch to any size hand. I got them and they were too big for my or my husband's hands before we even put them on. I returned them.
2.0,"I am a 34DD chest. I usually wear a large and I carry all my weight in my middle. I ordered a large. I was excited about how thick the fabric felt when I was pulling it out of the packaging because I hoped that I would be able to wear a nude bra under it and not have to layer. Unfortunately, once it was on you could still clearly see a nude bra under it- both under the white and pink. This was a deal breaker for me. Otherwise, the quality of the shirt seemed pretty good and I liked the look. The fit was a little more slim than what I like, but that might have been fixed by ordering an XL. Super disappointed that this won't work- please make fabrics not see through!"
2.0,"Meh. The faux fur arrived flattened in places, and won't fluff up. Not round and fluffy like the picture, but sort of misshapen and strange looking. Tried wetting it down and fluffing it, didn't work. Looks as cheap as it was. Serves me right.<br />One the plus side, it makes it really easy to find my keys in my rather large bag."
2.0,"Sleeves and shoulders fit as expected but much tighter around abdomen, not flowing as pictured."
2.0,"I loveeee the fit, but these are wayyy too see through :-( I tried the blue and purple and it just didn’t help :-( . For size reference though,  I’m 5”11 250lbs and I got the XL. Maybe black would be better?"
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:2a3bd4ade29c4435e62c2377ac63855c]] It may have been an error, it maybe how they do it. Either way not satisfied but I can’t exchange them only return. I love the leggings, comfy and cute but I don’t particularly want my size tag for the whole world to see. Does anybody really want it printed on their back side, negate  the size?"
2.0,Size runs really small and it’s made cheap
2.0,"Oh my god this sweater is hilariously ugly. The “red” color looks nothing like the photo - the photo appears dusty rose but this sweater is neon orange, and the fit is awful. It hangs off the body like a giant robe. Not the oversized chic look that you are probably looking for."
2.0,Received it slightly broken. Link was unattached and hard to adjust back on -seems like it is not well made. The price point is okay for what you get.
2.0,"First off shipping was terrible kept getting lost or delayed idk, they look like they will fit but very cheaply made will not buy again"
2.0,"I usually wear a size 8 or 10 in wetsuits, or women's size 5/6. I couldnt even get this past my elbows. Runs very small and is more of a diving material versus wetsuit material for surfing. Returning and will stick with the major brands."
2.0,They did not cut enough of the sun glare or nighttime glare for me to use them for their stated purpose.  I will be able to use the daytime sunglasses as regular shades however.
2.0,"This don't do anything except change the color of what I see. I really didn't notice a difference in glare from oncoming headlights. And at nighttime when the roads are wet and there is oncoming cars, I couldn't see the road lines any better. They may be ok as safety glasses or for shooting at the range, but I'm sad to say I ended up throwing them away."
2.0,Pretty band but the color fades.
2.0,Color rubbed off onto white part - not a fan.
2.0,"You can feel the wires in the ears, and they are flimsy. Hard to keep adjusted.. overall cheap"
2.0,"I was so excited to receive the omega chain after the reviews i had read about it.  But..was shocked to see how tarnished it appeared.  It really did not look much better then the old chain I was replacing. I would have returned it but did not have my original carton, etc.  Learned my lesson- do not buy unseen."
2.0,"I just received these lovely peep toe boots, and I must say that I am very surprised at BCBG and disappointed with the quality of the leather they look more like pleather,so not worth 90.00 bucks!!!!"
2.0,The dress is nice. I love the color. I’m just a little disappointed that the bottom of the dress we’re the slits are has not seams.
2.0,looks and feels cheap
2.0,Too large for number of earrings it holds.  Leaves could have been larger to hold more earrings and better spacing.  Butterflies just for looks. Returned item for refund.
2.0,I'm not sure about this soil tester. My soil ph is the same in areas that I think should vary. It always read about 7-7.2
2.0,"Generally I love a smartwool sock, but this pair had tp be returned because there was a tear in leg portion."
2.0,I thought these rings were open... that way I can custom them to my fingers.. when I received the product they were close and very small way too small for my fingers.
2.0,Happy with product! Customer service was odd to say the least.  Read description carefully! They followed through with complaint but not without a fight leaving me very upset.
2.0,These are not what was pictured. These are flat pieces of plastic.
2.0,Super adorable and fit great but first time putting it on her the strings from the seems were coming out. Returning item for full refund.
2.0,necklace discolored after wearing 3 times.
2.0,Nice looking but way too short
2.0,The sleeves are much too large.
2.0,Lots of unraveling of waist and leg bands with every wash. Disappointed in that.
2.0,Fabric ripped just trying to open the snaps. They are very tight on the garden model. We have two others that did not have this issue. Also the legs seem longer on this one than the others of the same size. Seems like a manufacturing issue.
2.0,"I was looking for some postpartum brief style underwear and ended up returning these. You definitely get what you pay for - cheap cotton, trim around the waist and legs that cuts into your skin, and a smaller fit than usual. I would rather pay a few dollars more for Hanes or another bigger brand that's still inexpensive but better quality.  And probably will go for a higher quality material like a cotton/poly/nylon blend that's more comfy."
2.0,Color isn’t wine definitely bright red. Shirt is baggy and arms are too tight for the looseness of the shirt.
2.0,I don’t like the size. I’m small and it falls down
2.0,There was no way I could wear this with a boob falling out no matter how I wrapped it. I ended up giving it away because there was no cute way I could find to wear it. But it is a very cute dress.
2.0,Muy grandes no me gustaron
2.0,"It doesn't really look like the picture, it's not cotton, it was smaller that I thought I would be, I bought a medium but I don't feel comfortable with it."
2.0,"I order the 0 gage because that is the size I have worn for 15 years. Did not fit, too small. So I wasted more money and bought the 00 gages because I loved them and just want a size that fits. WAY too big. Much bigger than 00 gage. I have spent a lot of money on these plugs because I just want a some stones that fit properly. I have ordered these a few times now thinking they can’t mess up all the time. Nope now I have a ton of stone gages that don’t fit. They are gorgeous and worth it if you get your proper size. But for me it has been a lot of gambling that I lost."
2.0,Broke after a couple weeks of use.
2.0,"The finger loops broke within an hour of putting on. Also i was under the impression that the neck line was black, it wasn't it is an awful jeweled fabric that totally clashes."
2.0,"T shirt material. The blue was vibrant but the material is like a soft t shirt dress. Not what I wanted, doesn't look dressy enough for business casual work dress."
2.0,I liked the thick material but it was not very comfortable and did not have any stretch or give...so if you have a large or odd shaped face it will not work for you.
2.0,Straight up and down! Doesn't fit anything like the picture shows :(
2.0,"Another made in China product that bent the very first time I used it. Amazon should label this as a light duty item, it should punch a hole through a thin imitation leather belt."
2.0,"Unfortunately, my use has a piece of wood just inside the hole that prevents the strap from clipping on completely."
2.0,"The bears patch is so rough, it’s not very flexible at all. I can’t give this as a gift it’s not right"
2.0,Cheap.  They break easy
2.0,"It looked nice, was cheap, and the pins worked well. But after a couple of days the metal started bending UI around the edges. The points are sharp and scratch it snag anything and anyone they run across. Not worth it."
2.0,"I did not like the length on this, not really for tall girls."
2.0,I was disappointed to find that this item is not entirely made of stainless steel. It rusts.
2.0,I bought this for eyeglasses and it was so stiff I couldn’t use it  Very disappointed
2.0,"I liked the leather, but it's too wide by the connection to the tracker, it's just about as wide as the pin itself. I'm returning this. It gets 2 stars for how nice it feels, but it's useless since I can't get it into the tracker enough to secure the pin."
2.0,"From top  to bottom of lens is too short. I can see out from under the lenses. I suppose it's fine if you text and drive. Other than that, they are fine I will not use them."
2.0,"Not the same as similar Dearfoam slides I've purchased in the past.  Top is narrow from back to front so more of toes are viewed and, more disturbingly, after wearing them for a few days the foot slides through and out the front.  I would not purchase this style again even though it is difficult to find the Dearfoam slides I like."
2.0,"But, it's so small and the material is thinner than I expected."
2.0,Sent the shirt back because the colors weren’t has shown. The white is more like off white and the black is more like dark brown
2.0,"I could put this on, but the cups were too small and too close together."
2.0,"The print was good and the fabric is what you’d expect for a basic t shirt. But the proportions are so odd. The shirt width was much smaller compared to other t shirts of the same size, and was so long it went down to my thighs. Practically a dress length."
2.0,"Color isn't as expected, plus the top was so small and doesn't even cover my breast...I'm a size 38c ,and it was so tight and flatten my boobs."
2.0,"Runs small, make sure to size up."
2.0,"It was an amazing and beautiful gift that read highly treasured. But regardless of the caution and care taken, the bracelet on its own without use began to tarnish and develop many different colors. It is now put away only for the memories and its special meaning. Highly disappointing!"
2.0,Kinda too hard to use. Big and cheap.
2.0,... not a 'quality' product.
2.0,It's an alright little cardigan but it doesn't look like anything in the picture... It's very thin and not very long.
2.0,Like parachute material
2.0,This bathing suit is beautiful but the top just doesn’t fit. It’s to small.
2.0,Beautifully printed but sleeves were waaaaaaaay too long.
2.0,The Velcro is coming off and the strap is too short.
2.0,Doesn't fit or support like it should you need to use straps for more support which is not what I bought it for
2.0,"These slippers are made of very cheap materials, bootie and sole. Very narrow, and not much indication of right or left foot. Not at all worth the ""marked down"" price."
2.0,Really? I have to unscrew factory parts because y'all wont fix it so it works right? Lame.<br />Color is pretty.
2.0,"First of all, it comes in two pieces. I ordered the large. You get a small tank top then the lace over garment. I should have ordered a XL. I’m 5’11, 170 lbs. The large is pretty small on me..it’s a cute lace but eh"
2.0,"Lower quality then expected, still kind of cute"
2.0,"It fit, but I wasn't happy with it. The material is much rougher than I would have thought and it has little-no stretch so it wasn't easy to get on or off. I could hear the hem making tearing noises as I fidgeted with it. The shipping took a little bit but wasn't that bad. The inches seem to match, but normally I wear a smaller size than what I bought. However, since the material had no real give, getting it over my head and arms caused the thread of the hem to break in places."
2.0,The bottom fabric is kinda stiff and feels like some table cloth. Super uncomfortable and not very flattering as it just looks stiff.
2.0,Large is like a medium as another user said. They fit. Their other shorts that said to order up in size I did and those are a little loose... these are a little tight.
2.0,"Waist was too tight,  I have a 33 inch waist a medium and that is what I ordered,  the item was well made and other than the size it was very good."
2.0,More suitable if you're long-waisted and are looking for something low cut.  Not really supportive as an undergarment.
2.0,I find the clasp very hard to open
2.0,I don’t even know how to describe the fit of this. The bottom was cute and a great length but there was literally no way to tie the top to make it work. I’m small chested and can normally get away with low cut or plunging necklines easily. I couldn’t figure out a way to tie this dress to make it even remotely wearable. Disappointing because the quality was good and the colors were so pretty
2.0,Wasn't what I expected looked looks/fits better on the model....
2.0,"I have ordered from other companies, t shirt dresses and have had very good results.  This dress is shorter and smaller than what I expected.  Will not buy from them again."
2.0,it was a little small
2.0,I would not have purchased if I knew the letters were glittered.
2.0,"This is just a regular beanie, not any slouch to it.  very disappointed"
2.0,"Inside of tubes is very coarse and has some sharp edges. I'd be reluctant to use them for fear of ruining a scarf by pulling threads. Took 12 days to receive but I wasn't really worried about how fast I got it, so I'm not docking any stars for that. Just thought I'd mention that as the description mentions fast shipping."
2.0,"No good quality and one of the earing was broken unable to fix it. They are also too big for me, just the little ones are fine but the long ones are way too heavy."
2.0,Very light weight. Not what I expected at all.  Sorry
2.0,"Buyer be AWARE!!! You will not get what you have ordered, the earrings, gloves, cigarette stick and head piece were all The wrong items. My wife is very upset because this is for her birthday. Pay very close attention to the reviews! Will not purchase from this vendor again."
2.0,Material was not what I expected. It will not be durable. I will be sending these back.
2.0,At least 2 inches smaller in the waist than advertised. I had to return them
2.0,The black mask turned green and I’m sad about it
2.0,i work outside
2.0,Runs very small. Ok quality. Wish It fit. Gave It away to a friend.
2.0,"I did not get the nice colors shown on Amazon. No green just one Neon green.  Also, was alarmed as a sticker on outside of package is a warning ""these scarves contain chemical that is cancer causing and are banned in California""!!<br />I have not washed them yet. Does this chemical remain after washing????"
2.0,"Tail is not the right color, or removable. I had to cut mine off and it left wird grey bit on the back. the long glove sleeve does not stay up, and stretches out easily, short glove is not fingerless. The mask is not made to fit a face, it comes out too far and slips. The body suit came unstitched after wearing it twice and im real sad about it.<br /><br />The colors are nice but I personally prefer a less purple color for the legs.<br />It is my first real cosplay purchase and despite the awful quality, I love it.<br /><br />I think if you can get it fit to your body and set the seams it will work fine.<br />Alterations to the costume would fix it right up.<br /><br />Overall, it's not well made. It's not cannonically correct and falls apart easily.<br />Despite this, if you have a large budget it can be easily fixed if you have experience in sewing outfits.<br /><br />I love mine anyways."
2.0,"What's the point of Dog tags if you can't get them engraved , they have a poly face not metal , more of a kid's piece then an adults piece , was going to send them back but it would cost the same to return them &#34;CHINA &#34; as to  keep them , so in my junk jewelry they sit .if your looking to engrave your  DT's  look elsewhere"
2.0,Hard to put in your ears
2.0,I only got two of each color when I was supposed to get 4 of each. I think there were two colors I got three of them.
2.0,Soft but cheap material way too loose
2.0,This hat would fit an elementary school student but not a grown woman. Way to small and no slouch at all. The quality is good but it was too small for me or my 13 year old granddaughter. Not worth returning so we donated it.
2.0,"I actually am a little disappointed. While the quality is decent, I really liked the movie look, but this one is red and not pink at all like the pictures. The mask is pink but the rest is red, which looks kind of odd. I honestly wish I would've returned it but it's much too late now. Overall though the quality is good, although I could see the zipper giving trouble. It's quite difficult to put on by yourself because the zipper is hard to reach and grip."
2.0,I've never owned compression socks but I got these to check them out. I am not a fan. It says unisex but they were huge on me. For reference I'm a size 8 1/2 in womens. They came past my knee and were so hard to get on. I dont know how tight thwy are supposed to be but they were really tight on me so I cant imagine on how they wpuld feel on a mams bigger leg.  I will say they were good quality though. This product just wasn't for me.
2.0,"I guess the pin locks work, but since there are absolutely no directions on how to use them, I haven't found out yet if this is a good product or not."
2.0,"This was for my wife, a Rescue Mom. She's small and found the mask surprisingly on the skimpy side. Between its small, tight fit and tight, thick fabric she doesn't like it, feeling too suffocated."
2.0,"The model in the photo must be only 5'-0&#34;,<br />as the dress hits at her ankle. It hit me just below the knee - I am 5'-8&#34;. Not what I expected, so I returned it."
2.0,"This looked so cute in the product photo but upon arrival the material felt like what they make Halloween costumes out of. I’m 5’2, 160lbs and I ordered and XL.. to big."
2.0,Began unraveling after first wear
2.0,"These glasses are advertised as polarized, they ARE NOT. They give you a picture to look at to see if polarized, and you can not see the fish unless you put on real polarized glasses (which I did).  If you take two polarized lenses and look through both, it will turn black.... I did this test too, and it FAILED."
2.0,It was very pretty but if you are an extra large you need to order 2 extra large
2.0,Not what I expected. The 95% rayon in the material makes it look very shiny and would not wear it with leggings. Returning tomorrow.
2.0,Inserts don't stay in place at all.
2.0,Looks Nice but is too fragile.
2.0,I ordered them and my delivery was late. My son wears a size 6 I ordered a 6 1/2 and my son isn't going to be able to fit them for more than a month. I would suggest buying a size bigger
2.0,"I've written one review about how the crystals aren't as vibrant ad pictured,  now my thread is frazzled and coming un braided .... don't waste your money"
2.0,"The top fits true to size the pants run big. Super comfy and would have loved to give 4 or 5 stars, however the pockets are backwards as you can see in the picture."
2.0,This dress is  the size for a child or a doll not an adult.
2.0,Poor quality garment
2.0,These were great at first but quickly turned like black from the silver rubbing off. I have weird skin that turns green to certain metals but I don't think it did that just tarnished.
2.0,"These cut into my waistline creating an unattractive bulge. I'm 5'6"" 118 pounds 36"" inch hips 27"" waist.  I ordered a size small based on the size chart and it's not a good fit for me and I am returning them.<br /><br />I have a long waist and straightish figure, someone with a lower and more hourglass waist line may not have the same issue.<br /><br />I'm also not crazy about the fabric. The fabric is very thick."
2.0,"Get what you pay for--I tried it on and the zipper immediately broke. It's a small, very cheap plastic zipper."
2.0,Sooooo short! I’m 5’7” and they were literally high waters on me :(
2.0,"I loved these but two days after wearing them one of the stones fell out.  Also, the stems should be made shorter so there isn't so much distance between the back of your ear and the screw-in backing."
2.0,Nice arms are larger bell than expected.
2.0,"it a good price for anyone that is looking for something cheap but there were a lot of issues after 6 months of using it.<br />the letters were rubbing off and keyboard keys would stick depending on what you were doing. the light on the mouse and keyboard was bright and looked beautiful but at the same time the mouse light would never go out even when the computer was shut down, very annoying. Not recommended for hardcore gaming or every day use."
2.0,This jacket sucks it's like wearing a plastic bag. The coat makes so much noise I couldn't wear it anymore.
2.0,"I ordered dress based off the photo on amazon i choose the dark blue dress. When it arrived it was black. Went back to check order, and the black dress photo was above the navy blue and the navy was above the black. I needed the navy and ended up with back because photos were switched. I was disappointed. The dress was also very thin. I had no other choice but to wear the dress. I really do not need a black dress. I needed the Navy for an event, but it was to late for me to go find a new dress."
2.0,"The elastic band on the bottom ruined it for me.  I was looking for a 100% cotton bralette.  The elastic band right under the breasts holds in the moisture right where I don’t want it to be moist.  Bralette itself is wonderful but the elastic band was uncomfortable and held moisture. It was downright wet after a good workout.  I wanted 100% cotton to absorb the moisture. The band even rolled over on Itself, making it uncomfortable to wear"
2.0,"good polarizing lens for the price. they are fairly cheap so they have scratched already, and frame broke within 2 months. Was Mart glasses last longer. I did like the polarizing lens. just a cheaply made product"
2.0,Package came wet. Eggs didn’t hatch.
2.0,Would buy again if it was better quality.
2.0,Surprisingly good quality for the price but for my body the fit was way off. I'm 5'4&quot; and it was SUPER long. The armpit holes were awkward and flared out. I'm 110lb and the small fit but had extra room in the hips (and I have big hips). It was just wrong all around. I'm sure there is some body type this would work for but unfortunately not me
2.0,Dont waste your money. They smell awful!!
2.0,"After 2 days the rubbing began, I don't wear it any more."
2.0,Used to be made of better quality material. ..now they break within a few weeks. Will NEVER buy these types of aviators again.
2.0,These boots look like you are wearing spats. They were returned.
2.0,"It’s not true to size. The top felt like cardboard and didn’t fit well, didn’t adjust well, nor wore well."
2.0,Did not defer water well wore fairly quick and touch screen barely worked
2.0,"THIS DRESS FIT VERY LARGE, ORDER SIZE SMALL IT FIT VERY LARGE I'M 5.5 WEIGHT 125LBS"
2.0,The crystal is very muddy and was too big for me. (00g)
2.0,This is a cute suit but the torso is very short. A large or xl in swimwear usually fits me perfectly. I'm 5'3 around 210 38 C and pare shaped and it does fit but the straps roll back off my shoulders because the torso is too short. One size up would be xxl but it stops at xl so Cute swimsuit but I had to return it the straps rolling back was too much for me.
2.0,"Dress is beautiful but I ordered mainly bc it has pockets. Dress arrived and only one pocket is usable. The other is sewn shut, otherwise i would have given 5 stats."
2.0,"Socks are nice enough, but these are NOT compression socks!"
2.0,"While it is a working watch, it's entirely plastic and the inner dials are just decoration.  While I didn't expect a high quality time piece (a Dr. Who souvenire, after all) this should be about a $10 item designed for a kid."
2.0,"There are a lot of nice, cute, fun socks out there!!! They aren't mink.  For the price, sorry gang.  I'm with reviewers who complained about the wording only on the right side.  Ridiculous.  They could have put it on both sides of both socks... Embarrassed about giving as a gift...."
2.0,It looks purple and not royal blue so I will return it. But it is cute and fits perfectly.
2.0,I wear a medium and ordered an XL based on the reviews that it ran small. The XL barely fits!
2.0,Runs very big. I ordered a 6-7 for my 5 year old and when it got here it ended up fitting my husky 8 year old. They are not tiny boys either. I had to run out and buy another one for my 5 year old.
2.0,"These looked and felt great until I washed them and then they pilled and looked awful. For the price, that never should have happened."
2.0,Poor quality product?
2.0,It's a little small I have to add bra extender<br />Other than that  nice thanks
2.0,This XL fits like a MEDIUM in name brands like Hanes or Fruit of the Loom.<br />I’m honestly disappointed.
2.0,I love the pin bc it's favorite character but the colors they painted Lady wasn't right
2.0,The metal on these earrings feels SO cheap and thin. You can probably just bend them in half with very little effort. The look is appealing but they are CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!!!
2.0,"Got them very disappointed like canvas not suede, color was uneven & they run at least 2 sizes too small. Returned them. Now the pink ones were good so exchanging those for 2 sizes up"
2.0,These mittens feel really soft and fit well but are a lot thinner than I expected. Kind of disappointed.
2.0,Too large for my granddaughter.  She is 10.<br />Had to return
2.0,"Pretty design, color and concept....just VERY thin."
2.0,It falls off a lot. Good material you can breathe in
2.0,I’m 5’0 115 pounds and material was extremely wrinkled and baggy. And the thread was coming out of it before I put it on. Color was exact though.
2.0,Fabric is really nice along with the length is perfect and the colors is amazing but it was really loose in my shoulder and on my chest.
2.0,"Drags your earlobe and cheap backings, so the earrings don’t stay on properly."
2.0,"Not true to size,not for youth more like toddlers."
2.0,"This shirt looks and feels really cheap. I am 5'5&#34; 125lbs. I bought a medium and could barely stretch it over my arms. The rest of the shirt fit, but it was like a balloon in the middle and the bottom hem fit, but was tighter than expected. The shirt is also shorter than the picture. It looked very bad on me. I will not be wearing this ever. Waste of money. I cannot believe that this shirt has such good ratings, because it is not the same as the picture and very cheap."
2.0,This is very cheap material ..thin
2.0,Cute but did not come with backs.
2.0,"not much of a slouch, fits more like a beanie."
2.0,Cheaply made and the velcro strap had odd placement.
2.0,the bottom is pretty big and the material is pretty thin. So when it gets wet you can see right through it..
2.0,Fit super small
2.0,"They were a bit large but I tend to order larger than I need. Very comfortable and I was so happy with them but then, those nasty pills started to form almost immediately. I was bummed"
2.0,Had them for around a year and they are already falling apart 😡
2.0,Too large and the quality is awful. The fur lining looks like an old stuffed animal. You can see the lining in the hood. Waist of money and returned.
2.0,Tarnished just hanging in my closet. Cheap material
2.0,Dress is silkyish swimsuit material. See through. The sleeves and neckline were different on the dress than on the picture.
2.0,"the sticky pads stick on the yoga mat just fine, but then your foot shifts inside the sock. otherwise pretty"
2.0,Product was wrong size and not happy about it would like something done please I specified 2 3x shirts and both were to small.
2.0,Very pretty and arrived fast. Order a size 5 older kid. My kid is 11 yrs and wears size 4.5. Length and width are a lot smaller.
2.0,This looked like someone cut off a shirt sleeve and sent it to me. not tight at all. useless.
2.0,It has that weird long drape in the back that's unflattering.
2.0,Snug through bust. I’m a B cup so would suggest going two sizes up as I usually wear a small (& ordered a medium because of the cut)
2.0,"definltey longer on the bottom than expected. it didn't quite fit as i thought it would, i don't think my torso is longer than most or shorter than most. but i don't believe that this should fit the way it did. such a shame because it looks really beautiful until i put it on. the slits on the side are not as high cut, and the shorts part is way longer than it should have been. i'll probably return it. i couldn't even wear it :("
2.0,"The website description and “certificate” that comes with the ring states that the stone is 3 carats and measures 8x10mm. It is only 2.6 carats and measures around 7x9mm. The cut is not symmetrical and hinders the brilliance you would expect from an oval moissanite. The stone is clear and the setting is one of the nicest option via Amazon,  but the head setting is slightly crooked. (You can see this in the picture.) It is disappointing, but one of the better options at this price point. Their actual stones are always perfectly clear and colorless. Hopefully I’ll find a keeper soon!"
2.0,"It's cute but 1. the purse is not leather as advertised 2. It is not ILISHOP, but some off brand with no markings. I wish I'd have read the other critical reviews. Only keeping the bag b/c it's functional."
2.0,This tuxedo shirt is VERY narrowly cut in the waist and chest. Most 19 inch necks would easily fit my body (3XL). No way. Had to return this shirt. It is OK quality; not bad but not top of the line. The material is a little thin but would be fine with a white undershirt. Stitching was fine. Just too darn slim cut. I could not even button the shirt across my chest. Definitely very European cut. Big American guys....look elsewhere. I eventually had a custom made shirt from one of those online shirt makers. Cost a little more but was a higher quality shirt that actually fit me!
2.0,I returned the item as it was too small!
2.0,It good for wear once every other ;but it pops easily && color comes off; dont take to pool or beach
2.0,The bottoms are so thin they don't last long
2.0,"I USUALLY TAKE A XL SO I ORDERED IT AND IT WAS TOO SMALL AND RETURNED IT. RE-ORDERED XXL AND IT IS STILL TOO SMALL, RETURNED IT AND ORDERED AN XXXL HOPE THIS ONE FITS WHEN I RECEICE IT. THE JACKET IS WELL MADE BUT THE SIZING IS WAY OFF YOU HAVE TO ORDER IT 2 SIZE UP I LIVE IN CANADA SO THE SHIPPING IS NOT REFUNDABLE SO THAT MAKES THIS GARMENT EXPENSIVE.  I DID PICK IT UP ON SALE BUT AT THE END I DIDN'T SAVE ANYTHING AND IT ENDED COSTING ME MORE THAN WHAT IT'S WORTH AT FULL PRICE. TO ME BECAUSE OF THE SIZING ISSUE MY SHIPPING SHOULD ALSO BE REFUNDED ., BECAUSE OF THE SIZING THAT IS WAY OFF I ONLY GAVE A 2 STAR EVEN IF IT'S A WELL MADE JACKET."
2.0,didn't expect it to be so small
2.0,"I should have listened to the reviews for this product. The rubber band is crazy tight. I tried stretching it out for a week to no avail, can’t use this product at all. And I have  small head!"
2.0,"Very disappointed with these. I bought them for my sister.  Her birthday is in January. She described them as watermelon colored. Garnet is supposed to be a deep, red color, not pinky red.  So it’s rose gold with pinky red kind of a clash.  For 60 bucks, I expected more."
2.0,"Returned first pair due to lens imperfection, 2nd pair better, but still off. Will go back to my old Bolles"
2.0,"First off, let me say what what I received is high quality and looks exactly like the picture.  Very cute.<br /><br />However, I misunderstood the description and thought it was a pack of 8 glasses.  This is my fault, however they should be more specific in the item description.  They also came without the carrying case that IS laid out in the item description."
2.0,I have 44DDs and I ordered the aize that is supposed to fit. It was horrible. They kept unsticking and I spent the day fidgeting with them. These might be great for small bokbs but they are NOT good for big boobs. I'd not recommend this product at all.
2.0,I had to reorder it runs small at first it was great but after wearing it for awhile it starts to poke into my sides so uncomfortable. Steel boned? More like thin wire when i sit it bends an doesn't hold me in you can see it under certain clothes. 😕 oh well onto the next
2.0,"The white is see-through, and the lining is only on the front panels. Even on the lined panels, it's still a little see-through. It was larger than expected, and even if it fit, it feels shapeless. This looks like a lab coat. This is not a blazer for an office outfit. It doesn't look like the pictures."
2.0,Did not fit as &#34;flowy&#34; as it looks on the model. It was tight fitting.
2.0,"The fit is great (I’m a 34DD), but the lace is super itchy. I’m not sure whose idea it was to add itchy lace to a breastfeeding bra when your breasts are already sensitive."
2.0,not very sturdy - caught it on something and a small tug (done a hundred times before w/ the original band) and it tore right through the pins at the Fitbit face.  I was surprised
2.0,"I purchased these in an attempt to get by without a bra in a fairly thin dress. Unfortunately the adhesive does not last and didn't stay in place during my &#34;test run.&#34; Additionally, for ladies with pierced nipples, these do not conceal the adornments."
2.0,I but this belt for my husband and he didn't like it because it's not leather Looks too sheep I going to return this belts
2.0,Button placket color didn't match shirt material.  Material seemed thin.  Not impressed.
2.0,One of the reasons I bought this item was for the pattern. I got an ugly substitute. Love that it's longer than others. The collar was pretty cheesy. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!
2.0,Huge slit in the side made it unsuitable for work. Normally love this brand but this was a let down.
2.0,"The size I ordered was too small, but I didn't return them because they are motivating me to lose weight."
2.0,The band is stiff and scratchy. The pins are hard to install into watch.
2.0,Lovey item but too tight fit for me
2.0,The first shirt I ordered was very tight in the chest and sleeves. I had to reorder it in an extra-large. It's long in the sleeves.
2.0,My daughter wore these one time had an accident and she might as well have been wearing nothing they did not work as advertised
2.0,The clasp on this necklace broke on the 2nd use.
2.0,This is not an authentic Adidas shirt. The material is not black black - it looked like it had been run through a washer first and lost some of the black dye. But the material IS soft. The actual logo looks badly adhered to the shirt and looks ready to fall off once washed. Giving it 2 instead of 1 stars because the material is better than expected.
2.0,"Yes it hides very well, but it fell off and I didnt even notice. Get the ones that are curved. This one falls off entirely to easy. Won't last you a day."
2.0,Does not fit 1 pant size than you are. Its stiff and not flexible. Gave it to my son instead and he complained about it.
2.0,"My mama wanted these earrings. I got them for her and they were stunning. Then...the first time she put them on, the back broke off from the earring. They're just not made well enough to wear.  We had to send them back. Boo-hoo."
2.0,The color I ordered is not the color I received. I ordered a darker color and received hot pink.  Misleading.
2.0,Runs very small fit. Love the pattern.
2.0,"I purchased so I could go as Daddy Warbucks for Halloween. Luckily there were 2 included, I pick up the first one to try on and it rips right down the center of the forehead. I carefully open the second. It did the job but as you can see from the photo, I look like I had a penis on my head. I had to keep pulling it down all night. They should not fold them down the center!!"
2.0,Material is then but it is a Halloween costume!
2.0,They're okay but not worth 17.00
2.0,Sound is mediocre at best. Easy to use.
2.0,the dress ran smaller then advertised which was very disappointing. Other wise I love the dress and will work to fit into it.<br /><br />Jody<br />Edmonds WA
2.0,I really wanted to like this shirt- the quality of the fabric is great. After the very first wash in nearly shrunk two sizes and doesn't fit. Be sure to buy a size up.
2.0,I am giving this to my 2 year old granddaughter to wear when she is with me. I will add a baby charm and all that's who thin and small this chain is
2.0,I do not have the watch. I returned it.
2.0,Lenses way too small for frames. You can hear them rattle around with quick head movements. Very easy to pop out and don't feel secure. Ordered FUSE lenses and they are a perfect fit.
2.0,"this would have 5 stars but the ""clip""  that adjusts the drawstring  is to big so it doesn't work at all. I would expect more from an ""Amazon choice"" product"
2.0,"I was really disappointed in the chain. I thought that it was going to be a bit more thicker. It can barely be seen. Thee chain really does seem as if it will break at anytime. I believe most ppl  will be happier with at least a 2mm. On top of that, the clasp was broken. I could not recommend this item for an adult."
2.0,Has a button but no button hole on pants
2.0,"The goggles worked fine for me, but after about 2 weeks of use the clasp on the black goggle broke.  Must be cheap plastic.  I'm wearing the blue goggle now and they work fine. Just wish they would last longer."
2.0,I was quite surprised that the bottoms of this set was actually just a skirt. I expected a typical panty style bikini liner to be built in (like my other swim skirts have) but no.... there is nothing. It’s literally a skirt.<br /><br />Also the description says straps for the top are included but there were no straps.<br /><br />The size is true to size. I am 5’3 and about 115 lbs and a small fit fine. That being said I don’t know that I would actually wear the bottoms. I think you would be able to see separate bikini bottoms under it. And I’m not a hoochie mama. I’ll probably wear the top.
2.0,"They are too big for a KeyChain. It’s good they can make them that big for such a small price, but not definitely for a KeyChain."
2.0,"Although these shoes are not real animal leather (they're pleather), they are stylish and comfortable; plus, the price is great.  They served their purpose for our needs ... black non-athletic shoes to wear with slacks for a recital.  I didn't want to spend too much money because I knew it is / was highly unlikely my son would wear these again ... they just aren't the style most kids wear for their everyday shoes & / or for running around outdoors, just being a kid."
2.0,I ordered this dress in blue. The picture in the listing is a gorgeous royal blue. The dress that arrived is much more navy blue. It's a cute dress but I'm not a fan of navy so I'll be returning it.
2.0,This shirt is not loose fitting as picture makes you believes.
2.0,"love the design and look these have, however they are cheaply made. i have bought them several times due to the ear arms breaking 6 months after i started wearing them. they break at a spot on the arm where you can not fix it. but if u want to waste money buy them, but i would recommend looking else where for a pair of polarized sunglasses"
2.0,very poor quality looked and felt like a jersey t-shirt hated it sent back immediately
2.0,Bought this as a birthday present for a friend. She loved it and was going to put it on immediately. Chain to clasp ring is broken. She handed it back after I promised to try to fix it. Not the greatest birthday present after all.
2.0,Zipper broke instantly
2.0,This dress is beautifully is made but way too small!
2.0,Just out right poor quality
2.0,The plugs had rough unpolished edges that irritated my ear.
2.0,BEAUTIFUL -----BUT ALL THE BEADS ANS THE SEQUINS GOT STUCK ON MY LACE DRESS I WAS WEARING AND MADE PULLS ALL OVER THE DRESS :(
2.0,"This shirt is very comfortable! However, the color bleeds after several times being washed and it rubs off on to your skin."
2.0,"The belt itself had an awful smell, I tried washing it, setting it outside. It literally made the entire house smell"
2.0,"Bought a Small based on size chart for 29"" waist.... received Small, but really... its a 33-34"" waist... so Large/X-Large.... The  boy can't use, luckily hubby can so we are keeping it but really... size chart is WAY OFF"
2.0,I have a 34&#34; waist and am 6 ft tall. I purchased this in Large size.  They are so tight they almost cut off the blood supply.
2.0,The Product quality is good and fits as expected but after using it 5 times the stitches around the waist started coming out. Unhappy!!
2.0,"It's a really great and pretty shirt but as a girl who normally wears mediums if you have big boobs or broad shoulders I would recommend sizing up also if you plan on trying to put it on yourself don't buy it, it's a waste of money"
2.0,Cheap gave it as a gift on Oct 15 and already ripped. she doesn't wear it much very disappointed
2.0,"I loved the color! I got pierced with the same color, but I wanted to size down. I found this, and thought it could be perfect. I put it in, and it sticks out really far, and looks like an earring. If you don't mind it, it could be for you, and it does seem to be good quality."
2.0,The lenses were slightly larger than the original. They fit into the frames but they changed the way they fit my head.
2.0,"The neckline was too low for me, and the fit was weird. The belly was fine but the bust was tight and odd. I ended up returning it."
2.0,Beautiful shawl! However item was advertised as a pull over which I wanted. Item received is open in front with a hook at collar line. I would return it but need for a wedding in just a few days. Afraid may not receive another in time. I am very disappointed with item and seller.
2.0,i was a bit worried about the &#34;one size fit's all&#34;… i'm a 10-12 and it's to snug!!! i would recommend it only for sizes under a 10!!!!
2.0,"Shoes were not memory foam, or even remotely soft. They were hard as rocks. Would not recommend."
2.0,Hair falls out can't see out of eye slits very uncomfortable no way to stay on
2.0,"The material is extremely cheap, and the fit is very odd. There were threads dangling from the sleeves as soon as I opened it. The front is a little too short, and the back is long. I noticed that after a couple of hours, the back kind of stretched out and was even longer. I decided to keep it because I really liked the pattern, and I only paid $8 for it."
2.0,"The price is very good for the amount of bracelets. BUT, they are for a larger wrist, and the magnets are not strong enough. I have to wear each color at home, with a snap on the bracelet, before I can take a chance and leave the house with one on. A couple of them are worthless, due to they fall off my wrist without even a sleeve touching them...Think twice..."
2.0,"I am unable to zip this dress.  The bottom fits fine but the top part of the dress is two times too small.  I'm a size 8 and wear a M in most cases or a small.  I'm totally disappointed.  The material does not stretch so keep that in mind should you decide to order.  If I order an XL/14-16, I'm afraid the bottom of the dress will be overwhelming!!  Not a good buy!"
2.0,This band was too big for my wrist and no way to adjust it.
2.0,Cheaply made item with fake pockets.
2.0,It is a cute ring but more wiry than solid like the picture
2.0,"I wanted to love this ring, but the quality wasn't there. I know, for a sub-10 dollar ring I shouldn't have expected much, but such high reviews raised my expectations. Right out of the package I was put off; I had ordered a 6, the packaging said 6, but the tag on the ring said 8. My largest finger is a 6.75 so an 8 would not work. Good thing I was actually sent a mislabeled 6.<br /><br />The center stone is more orange than anticipated, and a different shade than the 2 side stones. The smaller side stones are how actual morganite should look. The very large center stone on mine is mounted off center and not flush. It’s lower on one side, higher on the other. One of the prongs isn’t pushed down as far as it should be, and I could see the stone falling out at any time. I am returning this ring and spending a little more on a higher quality one."
2.0,Wheel broke after first travel. But company was easy to return.
2.0,My daughter loves this BUT... the strap broke off very easy... hopefully someone can sew it ;(
2.0,"The hat itself is great - sewn well, good graphics and the Among Us on the brim is actually  embroidered. Why just two stars then? Well, because this is an adult sized hat! As a grown woman, it fit me perfectly, just as well as some of my baseball/trucker caps. A few of the reviews stated that the hat was way too big and not a kid's size, but a few said it fit their child great so I thought I'd take a chance. NOPE. My son will be 8 in a few months and this was huge on him! I thought maybe I got an adult's by mistake and contemplated sending it back and ordering another one to hopefully get a kids hat but then I noticed one of the images has all the dimensions of the hat so I measured it and guess what? My hat had the EXACT same measurements shown on this page - proof I didn't get an adult hat by mistake but that in fact, the seller is selling adult hats marketed as kids/youth! The reviews that said it fit their child must have a preteen with a huge head because this is definitely an an adult size. My son was SOOO disappointed!  Now I sew, so I got a seam ripper, removed the lining band and added two darts to each side (4 total) and sewed it back up with my sewing machine . It looks great and you can't even tell it's been altered and it fits him fine now BUT...it took quite a bit of work to do that and I shouldn't have had to if it had been an kid's hat AS STATED! Hence, only two stars. Consider this a PSA."
2.0,"I love the variety of colors, but these aren't very sturdy. One burst open at the seam when I tried to slide it into the glasses. Oh well."
2.0,"I hadn't realized that the card slots would make this wallet so long.  While it is a very safe RFID wallet, it was too large for me to use and carry about just as is.  I had to return it.  It just wasn't functional for my purposes.  Thank you."
2.0,Thin and small! Not worth the money
2.0,Only 1 of the shirts fits correctly. the other 2 were maid so bad they are not even usable .
2.0,Looks like a moo moo
2.0,Very dainty and will break easily
2.0,"The style is not true to the picture, for the dress is display of having a lot of plate and that's not true &agrave;nd the material is a bit heavy, I am 5'5', 145lband my stat is 35,29,42, my normal clothes size is medium, and that's in every clothing, and to my disappointment upon ordering my dress in medium, on receiving it much to dismay its too big."
2.0,Shoes is cute but not very comfortable
2.0,The neckline was much too big so I returned it.
2.0,it is cool looking but the arms are smallish so fit higher on boot heel and really sharp edges so cut the leather on boots...rust on backside of metal...cheap cast product..don't recommend except as a door stop...not worth returning so I will try and put some hose pieces on hands so don't wreck shoes otherwisw will use as doorstop lol!
2.0,"Rather disappointed as I thought it had the tilt option and it didn't. Also for a steel post, it seems too light. I have gotten them at Oldtime Pottery for much better price and much better construction(tilt option, heavier pole,  better fabric). Will go back when I can and maybe give this one to someone else."
2.0,Was very disappointed on these so gave to my granddaughter and her did not like them? sizes are like for kids!
2.0,I had two swollen ankles after 10 miles hike during July 4th weekend and it hurt for days! I am not wearing these boots anymore!<br /><br />I would like to return them and get a refund.<br />Please help with the refund!<br /><br />Thanks a lot for the refund consideration in advance.
2.0,Very cheap material more like a tee shirt
2.0,I am sorry to say this dress runs so small I had to return it twice. We are very disappointed.
2.0,Awful. Cheaply made and way to small.
2.0,"Man, I could not get these to clasp. Perfect for people with tiny noses and extremely strong hands"
2.0,They lasted a day. Very cheap. Stretched out easily.
2.0,Just week it was working great but I have to charge it everyday and now the battery dies out 2-3 hours into the night overall a waste of money for something that should’ve been better quality
2.0,"The soles of the shoes were warped, so they aren’t flat. I also ordered half a size bigger than my son currently wears, and these shoes are way too small. Since they are overseas, the cost to return is too expensive so they don’t offer that, they only offer partial refunds"
2.0,"Le doy 2 estrellas porque el vestido no es como en la foto.. el escote es distinto y tiene mangas, en la foto parece ser con los hombros a fuera y jn escote más pronunciado. Luego, lo demas está bien, la tela es delicada y tiene muy bonito color."
2.0,"Poor quality,  seems poorly stitched, strings hanging out, part of the garment stitched inside out. Took too long to receive"
2.0,It is a cool color and  good looking strap. This is a strap for people who love gear and use it.<br /><br />Yes my Weekender looks dope in it...... but for how long?
2.0,"This product is cheap and cheaply made.  The zippers constantly pop out of alignment when you are trying to zip it up, even if it isn't completely full.  The material feels like it will rip apart easily.  If you want cheap little bags to store stuff long term, they would probably be fine, but I was hoping to use these to organize my daughter's clothes while traveling and they aren't going to cut it.  Would not buy again."
2.0,Nice but delivered ripped
2.0,Shorts are super long almost to my knees.
2.0,Way too big and also cheaply made for the price
2.0,The qualit feels very thin and a little cheap so unless you're skinny... this isn't the dress for you. If you have any rolls they show right through. Also I'm 5'7&#34; and it was about 5 inches too short. I know sometimes they are intentionally made short but I think that looks ridiculous. Would not buy it again.
2.0,The straps on these where extremely loose. Iv had multiple pairs of Olukais and they are always tight until break in. These where slightly shorter than my last pair of the same size and felt like they where just poorly made. I'm chalking this one up as just a bad quality control team. Other than this pair every other pair has been amazing.
2.0,Not cotton except elastic thread. Made in & Imported from China.  Polyester does nothing to protect.  Very disappointed
2.0,"After wearing one of the piercings for 3 days, the bottom half broke off"
2.0,This is a cheapa$$ terry blend thing that isn't lightweight but sure AF isn't a sweatshirt. This will not work with winters north of the mason/dixon.
2.0,This was given as a gift. Didn’t turn the finger green which is good. Looked a little gaudy but that was ok. The stone fell out in 3 seconds after opening.
2.0,"The hoop itself is gorgeous. i would wear it every day, if only i could. there is no possible way to insert this hoop to wear it looks right.."
2.0,It's see-through and cheaply made. I kept it because I needed it for a flamenco class. Otherwise I would return it.
2.0,Two stars because arrived with dirt on the sleeve
2.0,More sheer than expected. Scratchy material. Not what I was looking for so I returned it.
2.0,too small for the imagination!
2.0,It's a fake the green light sucks it's suppose to say maid in China in the back not Thailand
2.0,"I've been using this for a month and the top compartment already ripped after the 3rd use. I suppose I can sew the edge back, but I know it's not going to last much longer. If you actually fill up all 3 compartments, you will have trouble closing the bag since it's held together by 2 magnetic circular clasps. The outside material feels good enough, and the overall bag is simple, clean looking. However, I don't think the mesh will last if you use this heavily or pack a lot of items. I'd recommend this for someone who packs very lightweight, no bulky items, and who uses this a few times a year for light travel. Otherwise, there are better bags out there for travel and daily use. For my use, I'll look for a wider travel bag with stronger mesh, so I can pack more products and be able to close the bag nicely."
2.0,This was too big so I had to send it back. No issues with return at all
2.0,The padding on the legs is very bulky and does not bend/fold well as you move.  It is like wearing pants with thick pieces of cardboard in the shins.
2.0,"These are beautiful HOWEVER, they are extremely large and since not flexible, you can’t shape it to your face. Never wore them because they don’t stay on and can’t size."
2.0,Bonito diseño pero talla demasiado pequeña
2.0,"Not as big as I was expecting. It's almost like a big placemat. It's cute, but I have no idea how to use this as a scarf"
2.0,"The top is cute but the cut edges are dropping lint all over the place. I took it of because the top was making a huge mess on my skirt, shoes, floor, couch."
2.0,Bought this as a gift for someone overseas so I didn’t notice until it was too late to return that the tank said resting REACH face. Cautioning others to not make the same mistake- open it right away to check what you ordered!
2.0,"Ordered back in October and was surprised at the &#34;quality&#34; of the belt with its genuine-ish leather strap and separate ratchet belt buckle. Disappointed today as one of the pins in the buckle seems to have popped out at some point causing the whole buckle to fall apart. Seeing as most folks I know don't buy belts often, I don't suggest you make an investment in a belt with a better buckle so you're not buying a new one in a couple of months."
2.0,"No lleno mis expectativas,  la talla es más grande de lo que debería ser."
2.0,"The belt looks really nice in the beginning, but the colored surface peeled off after a few uses. The metal buckle is either too harsh for the surface or it's not well polished to avoid scratching it."
2.0,Not very durable. Tears visible after gentle hand washing.
2.0,"I bought this for a particular watch and only wore a few times.  It's coming apart in this hot and humid weather.  Cannot recommend, even though I bought this last year."
2.0,Lays really awkwardly. It's not a typical cotton t-shirt. Meh.
2.0,Looks very cheap in person.  Never wore it.  Waste of money
2.0,Cute but fit is all wrong i sized up from a med to a large like most of the reviews said but all that did was made the sleeves very baggy the cardigan it’s self is very short the points in the front came to my ribs and the side points came right at my waist. Not like the picture it’s not long like it’s supposed to be at all.
2.0,"The sound is okay and that’s about where the pros end. The beanie itself is way too big. But the real con is that the Velcro on the speakers to hold them in place is just a small little dot that is cheaply glued to the back. I took one tumble while snowboarding and now this thing is unusable. But even before that, I was constantly having to readjust the speakers and even had to put new glue on the Velcro dots to help them stay in place. Something else that made me mad was I bought this for 35 bucks and then the price decreased to 20 the next day."
2.0,"The shoes are super cute in the  picture but they are uneven and cheaply made. My fault. My Momma always said ""Good things aren't  cheap and cheap things aren't good""!"
2.0,"I honestly don't understand why y'all even bother because, if you can't control the item once it leaves your hands  it's not your date to promise. If your shipper gives you a promise to deliver timely then why not find a shipper that can. The runaround gets old just as the blaming everyone else. Either find better shippers or stop making promises you can't keep. Thank you"
2.0,You can’t really tell what is on the bead.
2.0,"Horrible Quality, not soft at all and poor fit. I bought Ivory color which is hard to find, and it it pretty see through thin cotton. Wouldn't even buy in another color."
2.0,"Meh, nothing special, and they feel cheap. They make creaking noise when opening and closing them. A little tight on my temples, but I have a big head. I'd be okay if they were half the price I paid."
2.0,"This product was sent to me from the Amazon store. Earrings received were not so attractive as on the photo, besides I have got the one with a production defect. I do not recommend it to buy."
2.0,"The dress color is dark emerald green as described, a little tight on the bust, the hem, awful, it sticks to the body by static, the fabric too cheap and the dress definitely not for the huskier body types. Could fit well women with huge hips and/or really skinny."
2.0,Love the boots but very deceiving on title. Theses are not actual Harley Davidson boots.
2.0,"Quality of the strap is okay. It doesn't really feel to much like actual leather and has a very matte finish. Since it's a matte finish, the actual alligator grain doesn't really pop out. If someone else was wearing the strap and I saw them passing by, it'd probably just looking like a plain black strap instead of a black strap with an alligator grain. The thing that bothered me the most other than the authenticity of the leather is the deployant clasp. If you bend your wrist slightly, the clasp will pop open. If you press one button, you will hear a click. Then if you press the other button, the clasp will pop open. The clasp should only release if you press both buttons at the same time, not when you press them separately. To see what the problem was, I took a closer look and I figured out that the problem is due to the fact that the two notches that lock on when you close the clasp are not level. This allows for one notch to be released when you press a button on that same side and for the notch on the other side to still keep the clasp closed. However, this means that if you press the button on the other side, the entire clasp will pop open because the notch for that button is the only thing keeping the clasp together. I believe this is a quality control issue with many of these types of deployant clasps. I've ordered a strap from istrap that works perfectly, only opening when you press the buttons simultaneously. However, I've also had another clasp from istrap that has the same problem as this one, though not as severe. So I'm guessing that I just got a bad clasp. I'm only knocking down stars for the bad clasp because I don't amazing quality strap material for 15 dollars. However, I do expect full functionality which is why I'm taking stars down for the clasps itself. In addition to that, the part where you can adjust the clasp to the holes on the strap was very loose. I had to hammer the sides of the clasp to make sure that it'd close tightly after I attached it to the desired hole. I've attached pictures because I know the explanation is probably confusion. I have it on my Orient Mako USA. I don't wear it much because the alligator grain doesn't really show too well. However, the main problem is the clasp which has made me almost drop my watch a few times."
2.0,Had the ring for a little over a month and two of the stones popped out. Big bummer
2.0,It looked really nice but It already broke
2.0,"When putting these gloves on they are very difficult, when taking them off the lining comes out with the fingers."
2.0,Tight through bust
2.0,"My husband had a similar aviators hat but it was well worn so I decided to buy him a new one. 1st the sizing is wrong and it is bigger than what the company told me. 2nd the leather is paper thin. 3rd the peak at the front is not even half the size of the one in the photo making it off no use to cover your eyes from the sun. 4th it has flaws.<br />I am very disappointed,<br />the company is in England so .....<br />I upgraded to 2 stars because when I contacted the company they tried to help me"
2.0,It’s not shaped to fit your ear
2.0,"I ordered this shirt in two different sizes.  I am 5'3"", between 140-145lbs and typically wear a Medium in tops and size 8 in pants.  The material is thin and clingy and doesn't lay right.  I also didn't like the cut/fit of the shirt.  It was too big and baggy on top (arms and chest) but fitted around the hips and mid-section.  Very unflattering."
2.0,Too short and cheap looking
2.0,"I loved my goggles when I bought them. But 6 months later the anti fog wore off and I can’t see a thing. I was told 5 months ago by Customer Service to use baby shampoo on the inside, others said saliva. Well, why have anti fog. Can’t see a thing $55 gone."
2.0,I upsized 2 suzes a_u
2.0,It ended up fraying/breaking after only three months.  Get the Apple ones on clearance as they are WAY better.
2.0,"Fyi this ships from China, I just thought people should be aware because I wasn't before I purchased the product so it took several weeks to arrive. Also quality is very poor and the paw prints are just felt glued on, I am disappointed especially as an owner of a original spirit hood. Overall fits well and works if you don't have the $ for a real one."
2.0,Way too small in the chest area.  I'm a B/C cup and usually wear a medium but this didn't work for me.
2.0,Found the pajamas to be rather scratchy and the small size I ordered was quite large.  Color was  nice. Would  not order again.
2.0,"This dress is adorable. The quality was okay. But it was very boxy. It didn't taper at all at the waist. I'm short, so it looked horrible on me. I returned it.<br />But the color was very nice."
2.0,Didn't fit well not long enough.
2.0,"I ordered purple for an upcoming dancing school performance where everyone is required to wear a different color. Since pink was taken I went with purple. The product I got was NOT purple! It was completely pink, light in color, faded and looks almost old and washed...the material is not as soft and flowy as the pictures had shown. I wanted to return but it seems like a complicated process and I'd have to pay shipping to mail it back."
2.0,Backs can come off easily.
2.0,The kundan had fallen off and it was broken when the package arrived . Rakhi couldn’t be used for the intended purpose .
2.0,Gold comes off in pool. Chain is very cheap and breaks easily.
2.0,"Loved the style, but returned it because the sleeves were incredibly itchy."
2.0,I was not expecting to have issues with this product aince it has pretty good reviews. I purchased a size 10-12 for my tall 7 year old and the shirt is smaller than I thought. He can wear it but its very uncomfortable. I even measured him before. So if you're looking to buy one of these go one size up to fit comfortably.<br /> The hat is super small. I guess its a one size fits all kids size but not every kid has the same head size.
2.0,Not well made. Cheap material. Came squished
2.0,"Very cheaply made, easily broken. Not sturdy at all."
2.0,"I will preface this with the comment that I may have received a dress that was incorrectly labeled- said large and may have been a small. I loved the look of this dress and was recommended a medium actually, but I ended up getting a large just in case. I got it and it looked like a nice dress, but when I put it on it didn’t fit AT ALL. I am around 190 lbs, 5’6 and have DDDs. I thought it would be fine because the stretching was listed as really good and technically it was, but the seam for the waist hit right under my bust. I let a few friends try it on because it honestly is a nice dress just not on me, and it only ended up fitting my little sister who is basically a stick figure and weighs less than 120 lbs.  So, I’m not sure if I was just unlucky, it doesn’t like big busts, or that it actually doesn’t fit true to size."
2.0,Garbage. The links break at the slightest turn of your head. I know it's cheap jewelry but they're not worth the little I spent for them.
2.0,Smaller that expected gave to my daughter
2.0,"I guess they do what they’re supposed to, but the lenses are a bit bigger than I expected. And after wearing them for only a couple hours, I took them off to find a rash around my face where the frame had skin contact..."
2.0,its really cute..but it fell apart after a couple days
2.0,"Material more like a nightgown.  Cute style, but I would not wear it out.  Not good for an evening dress."
2.0,These tarnished quickly. I only have 3 that haven't yet & I have only had them for a month.
2.0,I have a size 7 1/8 head for hats which is a small so most glasses fit my face. These fit but the shape of the heart was a little bit of a miss. Also I found where the sunglasses weren't completely painted. The pink color was cute too
2.0,"These socks are not OTC, like advertised"
2.0,Cute but the outside short stood out a bit over the inside bike short. Its too hot to wear polyester bike shorts. I felt quite constricted in these. Returned.
2.0,For kids only right?
2.0,Item loomed like it was put through hot several washes. It looks old and faded. Not as soft but at least the fit was just right.
2.0,Again Asian size it’s for kids and the material is very cheap
2.0,Cheap quality. Tried two and the zipper did not work well on either. Also I wear medium and even the XL was short. Spend more and get a merril or north face.
2.0,The skirt could be a little bit longer for a one size only skirt
2.0,The only reason I keep buying these is because they’re the only glasses out of the 437 I’ve tried that fit my ugly mug! These things are babied. But within a year they always break at the bridge!
2.0,"Much too small, I returned."
2.0,Love this thing but gives off a lot of lint. The elastic band along the bottom Id prefer it not have. And worst worst worst by far is the purple tag on the arm. Just why?
2.0,"I do like the skirt but the color is not at all as described.  It says teal on the site but the label on the packaging says “mint” and its very minty green, not teal.  I put a teal colored shirt on for comparison (my watch band is also teal)...It looks light blue against the green skirt.  The fit of the skirt is nice but the material isn't the best.... Its fairly heavy and rough(ish) but tolerable. I like the pockets and the way it sits on the hips, isn't bad. The waistband would be better if wider about an inch or so.  The color definitely ruined it for me.  I might try a different color or see if i can lighten the green to an actual teal.  I got a medium, I'm 5’8” with a waist of about 29” and it fits pretty good."
2.0,"My ring didn’t want to close shut and seamed to be extra sharp around the edge of the hinge which irritated my piercing a whole lot. Love the segmented idea, but wouldn’t recommend:("
2.0,It’s pretty BUT runs really small!!  I can’t wear it without it popping off my wrist 😫
2.0,"This wallet is perfect in size and storage that i was looking for and is just as described EXCEPT for the color. The advertised color, that i chose and wanted was a bright, bold yellow. Unfortunately that is most definitely not the color I received. The color isnt yellow, it is a pale green. I wish it would have been the color shown, it would have been perfect."
2.0,"very cute, but sizes are not at all true to size. I got a  large what I wear was like small."
2.0,poorly made. Very cheap looking product
2.0,"Had to do an update, I guess you really do get what you pay for. I  ordered 2 hat's the tag in one of the hat's said it comes with a scarf. I'm assuming they're selling the scarf separately when it was originally intended to be a set per the tag.<br />The other hat was used, no tag and after hand washing them according to the care instructions, the seams are unraveling. I thought I had clicked on an American made product(which I always support American businesses) and i guess the name should have been an indication that they weren't produced in the good ole USA but in fact they came from China.<br />Buyer beware......."
2.0,"When I first took it out of the package and felt the material, I knew there was going to be a problem but I was going to test it out to be sure.  I'm normally a medium.  It did sort of fit but was a tiny bit small. I figured that was ok since it was advertised as compression workout pants.  The main test I normally do to determine whether it's a keeper is to do the bending test.  My gut was correct.  It was see through when bending. Like you can clearly see the white tags in the pants including what I wore underneath as a test.  Disappointed."
2.0,"This product, while comfortable and really warms your feet, is built from really poor quality sewing. Once you put your feet inside the hole one of the slipper's back portion tore open, so we stitched it up. However after being in use only during the night for 2 weeks the back of the head portion also tore open.<br /><br />I would not condemn the sellers selling this product, but rather the makers (Wishpets). Please proceed with caution when buying these slippers."
2.0,Stones fall out too easy and too soon
2.0,no rear pockets runs very small
