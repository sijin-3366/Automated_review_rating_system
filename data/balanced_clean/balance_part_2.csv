1.0,"The whole set is amazingly cute! My 9 year old daughter LOVED it.<br />But the dang pants are way too thin. The butt area is so thread bare you can see her underwear all the time. Very disappointing. One picture is with the pants draped over my daughter's hands, the next is with obvious slack in the material so you can understand just how thread bare these pants are. Totally unwearable. Completely inappropriate for clothing to be so thin.<br />I ended up getting her a pair of Target sweats to coordinate with the sweatshirt."
1.0,"Runs very small.  The XL shrunk to either medium or large in size. Two of the 4 shrunk to medium, while the other 2 shrunk to large.  Would stay away from this product.  I'm XL and these do not fit."
1.0,Sweater was very itchy so I returned it.

1.0,"Hello, I Bought These Insoles To Replace Insoles In A Pair of Sandals. The Insoles Inside Had A Moldy Mildew Smell. Will Not Be Using, Very Disappointed."
1.0,Ordered a medium. It Fitz like and extra large and when I tried to send it back for a different size they told me it would be $105 for shipping to China. So now I’m stuck with a dress that I can’t wear.
1.0,You only receive one sleeve. This was not made clear in the product description. Would not buy again.
1.0,Its not like the one in the picture
1.0,These pants were nothing like the picture or description. They also stunk like moth balls!
1.0,"way too pricey for what you get. Ive only worn once and only because i wanted variety in my weekly wardrobe. it has no shape, its bulky, and heavy. not a flattering fit. Im 5'1 140"
1.0,It's too small in the upper area and the fabric feels cheap.
1.0,Garbage don't buy
1.0,"Ordered XL, sleeves are way too short."
1.0,The color is a camel color
1.0,"This runs small especially in the derriere area. If you have anything there, this will not fit. Cheap quality as well. Disappointing purchase."
1.0,they look tacky.
1.0,"I went by the measurements to order my size.  However, upon trying it on, it was at least 3 sizes too small.  It fit like a 14-16US."
1.0,I needed this dress for a wedding. Dress came with the zipper broken. Don’t have time to reorder. Thanks a lot
1.0,"Very disappointed in these. The stitching between the fabric upper and rubber sole came undone after only 2 months, and there is a crack in the sole of that same slipper."
1.0,I loved it......the ONE time I wore it. The second time I went to wear it the claap broke! Very cheaply made!
1.0,Bought to wear under gloves while working in very good weather.  Very dissapointed. There is barely any liner in them. Wouldn't recommend.
1.0,"I ordered this bikini twice, once in medium, once in small, neither fit so I'm just gonna sent it back for a refund. Their bikinis just don't fit me."
1.0,Product runs large and not true to size.
1.0,This was a beautiful bracelet but turned colors after 6 months
1.0,"Shirts were hard after one wash, holes after 6 months"
1.0,Not as pretty as the picture. Colors kind of garish. Gave it away.
1.0,"The online pictures make the lenses look much darker than they are in real life. They were much,  much lighter in real life. Kind of misleading."
1.0,Very poor quality!
1.0,Way to long for any average person
1.0,"Oh no! This doesn't work! Sad face, sad face, sad face. Looks good for the price but does not attach to watch correctly. Terrifying moments where band was stuck halfway on. Honestly thought I'd ruined my pricey watch for several minutes. Boo. Do not recommend.<br />Unexpected bonus: I got to learn how to make a return using Amazon Locker."
1.0,Just got these. They look shinny but also look cheap. Clasps are very cheap. Don’t expect them last.
1.0,Tried putting these on and the candycane part is too small. It ripped apart where it's sewn to the briefs. Good for a laugh though.
1.0,The backs bend very easily. I expected better quality.
1.0,I was sent a very tacky looking fake leather skirt. The pictures and description led me to believe I was ordering something more like a soft-touch spandex.
1.0,Poorly made. Very thin material.
1.0,Product looks attractive but the buckle broke after only 2 wearings.<br /> return in process .
1.0,Great socks but I am very disappointed that I paid 20 bucks for 1 pair of socks!!
1.0,So disappointed I saw a picture of 5 pairs of socks that looked cute so I promptly bought them without reading closely. It is only 1 pair even though it shows 5. No longer a good deal. Returning. AND DEF NOT COTTON
1.0,Too short if you have hips and butt
1.0,no second hand and impossible to put on
1.0,"I bought two sets of these.  Within two weeks two pairs were broken in the exact same spot...same side.  They are defective.  AND, of course, they have a no return policy!  I can see why!  BOO....HISS!"
1.0,"These were terrible. The lenses were fine but the arms were not bent right. The left side was completely straight like a Popsicle stick. I returned and got another of the same because they do look cool and wanted to have them the way they were advertised but the next pair had the same exact problem, but it was the other side.<br /><br />I kept them because I could use a heat gun on the plastic to form it to the proper shape, but it's absurd that I had to do that. Most customers wouldn't be able to."
1.0,Cheap material that does not feel goo
1.0,"I loved the watch and the easy belt application...but don't bump or sneeze on it cause the crystal dosn't live up to it's affordability!...I got 3 months outta mine, good luck with ""yours"".http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CS6Y1M/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
1.0,never got both just 1???
1.0,Size was misleading.
1.0,"Bought it twice, first one broke, then i bought another one, and same thing"
1.0,"Not a tunic length, it held up to one wear. Its was just very cheaply made."
1.0,"I have other Polo hats that I purchased from  Macys but I needed Blue, this hat I got is nothing close to the quality I was expecting and was willing to pay almost $50 for. Poor Quality , thinner and cheaply made. waist of money."

1.0,Muy pequeño para las manos de un hombre.
1.0,Was not made like the picture. The picture didn't show that the dress was 2 pieces
1.0,I’d give this zero stars if I could. Cheaply made. No English instructions and damaged box. I paid expedited shipping for this with a minimal $10 refund.  Do not buy.
1.0,Super cute but very cheaply made. I only got to wear this for a few hours before it broke :( it  continuously got tangled and then it broke
1.0,Very low quality glasses. it is all scratched in 6 month inside protective case. Consider this before buying.
1.0,Lenses pop out very easily! Poor quality.
1.0,it's cheap quality
1.0,VERY cheap quality!
1.0,"These look cool in the pictures but they will make you look like an alien. You couldn't pay me to wear these in public, because they look like they came from a costume. Once again the pictures are very deceiving!"
1.0,I had to throw it away half an hour into a costume party.  It was fifty percent bald by then.  It shed all over my host's house.  I'm still finding feathers at my house - I can't imagine what my hosts have.
1.0,Too small kids size
1.0,The size is small too much
1.0,"This product worked for 30 days, and then stopped working the day after the 30 day refund(which is a very short time period) was up. Paid way too much for it to break and not be able to return."
1.0,"It looks pretty in the picture but in reality it runs small, very wrinkle after first wash.  Plus, the collar seam came apart and I had to return it.  I had a mastectomy revision and could only wear button down pajamas so I wanted to wear something pretty.  So disappointed!"
1.0,I returned these - they are so small you can't even tell what the shape is - they look like flecks of glass. the on-line representation is not even close to what you get.
1.0,Much much much too small. Had to return. Tried to give to a friend who is super skinny but it was too small for her as well.
1.0,Have to double wrap the hair tie which stretches  it out
1.0,I soaked a pair in alcohol prior to use and the finish and color came off. I never wore them because I can only imagine the coating coming off in your ear hole.
1.0,"These are the biggest pieces of excrement I have ever seen in my life. Just thought I'd share...  My fiance bought these for me for christmas, and there has not been one time that i've tried to wear them that havent got staic build up within 5 minutes of being on my body. I absolutely HATE these chinese made static generators. Tried every kind of static reducer on the market. Nope these are just garbage. I am going to burn them and am never buying anything that says Nautica on it again.... Save your hard earned money."
1.0,"I must have received a bad version of these wallets. The wallet is pretty loose and does not lend itself to minimal carrying. My cards always fall out of either side and now I have to stuff the wallet with extra cards, sometimes two to a slot, just so things don’t fall out."
1.0,"Horribly itchy material, cheap material you could see right through, and not even the shape as shown in pictures. Don’t buy!!!"
1.0,Terrible material and not as shown in picture.
1.0,"Doesn't do much, so my daughter never uses it."
1.0,Blouse very small.
1.0,Mala tela!! Low quality!<br />Bad printers!!<br />I just returned it!
1.0,"They dangle, can't figure out how they crawl up your ear???"
1.0,"After over an hour of attempting to remove a couple of the designated lengths to shorten the band, only one pin could be removed out of the 6 marked. The pin on the tool was bent when it arrived and I noticed that when I replaced it with the provided spare, the pin when attached to the tool did not line up properly with the indention for the pin in the band. It sat much lower and when I attempted to gently pry it upwards to align with the hole, it broke off. I've adjusted a couple very similar watch bands in the past without issue. The one pin/link I did remove was rusty and when I reassembled the band , the rusty pin fell out, so even if I had successfully removed the links, I am not certain the links would have remained secure. I suspect that the quality is not consistent."
1.0,Wish I can give it no stars.  These are tights not leggings and they run small.  I ordered a 2xl. And they don't fit. I have them to my 11 year old daughter. Pretty sad....
1.0,I've owned this belt for 7 months and have loved it. Then this morning I went to put it on and noticed the belt buckle's pin had snapped off. I don't know if this is a common issue with this buckle or an isolated instance. I'm hoping Amazon will choose to replace the belt. Photo attached.
1.0,"I was excited to finally find a leather band for my Fitbit Luxe. Unfortunately, this one misses the mark. It fits the Luxe, but is really loose. It has a lot of play in the connection. I figure it can’t be good in the long run. I was afraid it may come apart on its own."
1.0,"Cheaply made, very thin, a large was super small."
1.0,So I was wanting a Jersey style gym “with a satin/silky feel?” “mesh” pants for my husbands Christmas “pjs” these arrived just in time and when he put them on the texture isn’t the same it’s more like a cottony and it has a lot of static and feels “cheap” it is nothing like what I was hoping for I am really disappointed in what I for the price of 20 I expected to be able to get a quality gym shorts
1.0,The cups on this bra are very oddly shaped. The stitching in them were too tight while the very thin unpadded fabric for the cup was very unsupportive. The cups on the bra look nothing like the bra in the picture. The fabric is rough and itchy as well.
1.0,Bought in May and zipper broke August. Poorly made. The window for returns is no longer open so I’m now stuck with a broken zipper purse.
1.0,This is like a piece of fabric. An xl didn’t even fit my slim tall niece! She’s 12! Don’t buy it’s a waste of time and money!
1.0,It’s HUGE
1.0,"i loved wearing this dress. unfortunately, i had it hanging in my closet and forgot i bought it last year. so i found it last week and wore it- then i washed it and HUNG IT UP to dry- no dryer. the dress shrunk SOOO MUCH. now i can't even wear it. i'm extremely upset. i truly loved it and now it is a rag. i wish i could get my money back!"
1.0,"Fell apart while trying to screw on back, before it even got tight."
1.0,It’s not 00
1.0,"I am 4'11, 110 lbs, 34D, this was huge on my chest...i could barely zip the back up...super tight! Does not fit right, but I missed my return window."
1.0,"Disappointed. These had good reviews and I was excited to try them. Unfortunately, even with ordering a size larger than normal they are still too small. After a lot of effort, I got them on but they did not fit well. At all. Maybe the package they came in was marked wrong. The item itself didn’t have a size tag."
1.0,Don’t like it too thing
1.0,Don't buy. pretty but broke right away
1.0,"Letters are all stuck together & different sizes, armholes are TINY."
1.0,It’s not the same mask that’s  shown on Amazon
1.0,Very cheaply made. Strings were hanging from the items and the buttons weren’t even together. Only kept bc my daughter really needed it the next day
1.0,It's very bulky and cheap feeling. Not lux at all. It also has an extremely unflattering waistline (at least on my). Wish I returned it before It was too late...
1.0,"Beautiful color and I love the way it fits.  However, the entire front top arrived unraveled.  I have sewing to do.  I’m not happy"
1.0,"This looks really cheap, esp the chain. If it weren't for the cost of return shipping, i would return it."
1.0,"Thought they'd have a slim fit via a stretchy material. But they're bulky and unwieldy. I ordered a size up as recommended and overall they fit ok, but the fingers are a good inch too short. I usually wear a small; these are a medium."
1.0,"This item arrived and it wasn't even the watch that was ordered. It's as tiny as your thumbnail also. What a waste of money and big .joke, of course I'm returning immediately!"
1.0,The thumb webbing was strange and hard to move. And I got a rip in the glove the first time I wore it.
1.0,No me llego
1.0,Nothing good to say - it was returned
1.0,"If I could give this product 0 stars, I would. I received ear muffs instead of these and I am incredibly disappointed."
1.0,Sleeves are really weird and large
1.0,The glasses do help but very little.
1.0,So ridiculously tiny. It was the size of a dime!
1.0,I was so excited to receive this but now i am so dissapointed.  They do not fit my nipples at all. Would not recommend for people will smaller nipples.
1.0,"Do not keep time, stops about 7 plus times a day have wear it for a week, junk to me"
1.0,These broke in less than a week. Very disappointed.
1.0,"I’m sure they would have been great, except i received clear glasses instead"
1.0,"This watch is intrinsically expensive, so no regrets about the price, albeit the date and day of my ""new"" watch don't work and if I were you, I'd run from this seller."
1.0,It was bad quality. Fitting was very bad. Fabric is T-shirt like. Buttons were all inside.
1.0,One of the rings broke just as I was trying it on and the only finger that they fit on was my pinky.
1.0,The hat looked like it had been balled up and put in a small bag. Horrible way to ship a hat.
1.0,It took FOREVER to receive the product and the quality was very poor. My daughter doesn’t even wear it because the material of doesn’t feel good.
1.0,"Size is way off.  Tiny tiny stone, falls right out.  I’ve tried many brands and sizes. Very disappointed."
1.0,"I am senior, medium size women. Why does everything have to be fitted?"
1.0,The material is cheap and the dress looks cheap. Save your money. It runs about 3 sizes to small. I would not recommend this dress.
1.0,Not as it appears.  The material is super thin and cheap like childrens dollar store pajamas.  Coloring is not as vibrant as in the picture. Sending it back for a refund.
1.0,"One word: GARBAGE. But really what did I expect I guess? Seriously it’s plastic. Don’t waste your money. And I accidentally ordered 2 some how and one came already broken. Very professional China 👌🏻 Zero stars, gave 1 because I had to."
1.0,"Received One Size leggings yesterday, normally I wear a size 2-4. Put them on carefully to try on. They fit, so I removed tags for washing. Then discovered runs in the bottom/crotch area."
1.0,Missing several sets of earrings. Only received one of the fake diamond stud sets.
1.0,They look good but one of the latches was broke on the pair I received so I couldn't even ware them.
1.0,"The skirt was not full or it was rather thin, and lifeless. We ended up buying 9 more yards of tulle and hand sewing them in to make the skirt we received look like the one pictures… the one we purchased looked like it came from Wish"
1.0,"cheaply made, i threw them away"
1.0,Costume runs VERY small!!! Small was same size as medium?!?!
1.0,These glasses are terrible!  I can’t see anything with them on.  They are distorted.  Amazon should not sell them. Waiting for return to be approved?  Amazon should take care of this!!
1.0,"Very cheap, did not look like the picture."
1.0,Very cheaply made zipper pulls loose from purse
1.0,Ran small. Cheap material
1.0,Do not buy this watch.  Had no instructions and the time  doesn't remain on. I had to throw it away.
1.0,Arrived broken in pieces
1.0,This is false advertisement. I am a size 20 which is a 2x for this costume. It os NOT a size 20. It fit me like a t-shirt. When it didnt fit me i was curious so i had my mom try it and it was only 1 size too large for her. She is a size 10. This is not Plus sized i am so disappointed. I want my money back including the extra i paid for shipping.
1.0,The band broke with in first week. It’s supposed to stretch and stay together. The other end is in tact.
1.0,I love the dress.  Had it pressed for an event. Put it on and the lace is unraveling on both side of the cheat area.  No time to exchange so I had to find another option.  Hate that I spent money on something I can never wear!
1.0,"We waited quite awhile to receive from China and after a few uses and a trip through the washer and dryer, the two we purchased are falling apart. We would not purchase again."
1.0,the prduct came broken the string for the hair net was compleatly out
1.0,"Pics show day three of outdoor camp with a 5 year old (dirty yes, but serious hiking that would break a shoe down, no).<br /><br />Wanted to love these shoes for outdoor summer camp as they get great reviews, but after three days they are falling apart. So disappointed in quality."
1.0,This was a bummer that I didn't try to return it within the window of possibilities.
1.0,"cute hand bag, but look cheap."
1.0,This was nothing what it look like. You get what u pay for. Very unsatisfied
1.0,I HATED this onesie i love indie and don’t get hot easily but this felt like a was in a sauna when i put this on. The fabric sucks. I was in aC and I was sweating so bad I had to take a shower after I wore it. It’s also way too expensive for its price and the sizing chart is horrible. I also looked online after and most of the costumes like this were $18 and this was 42 in total with shipping and handling! SCAM!!!!
1.0,"Bought &#34;Nike&#34; Free men's running shoe.  It looked nothing like the real Nike Free shoe.  It had a Nike tag on the insole but, not the shoe.  It came in a Nike box!  It was a very sophisticated knockoff.  Would not buy from Limelight Fashion, Lexington, Kentucky seller.  Coincidentally there is another company in Lexington, Kentucky called Limelight Promotions.  They design logos."
1.0,"Zero stars. It came rusted, and missing one of the balls at the end. It honestly looks used.  Worst thing I've ever bought on amazon."
1.0,It came with holes in it. I will never purchase again
1.0,This dress was costume material. Not what I expected.
1.0,"Um, well, the print I was received was a blue and white stripe. BUT, it looks nothing like the item pictured. I expected a contrasting neckline, but the item I received is striped all the way to the neckline with spaghetti straps. And the material...oh my. it is more like swimsuit material than anything pictured on the model. Remember the old Disney cartoons featuring Goofy wearing a swimsuit? Yeah, that is the closest explanation I have to this sorry excuse of a garment I received."
1.0,This bootie doesn’t stay on at all! The Velcro is easy for my 7 month to open and doesn’t get tight enough for his ankle. Definitely wished I would have bought the more expensive brand! The actual bootie is a good fabric and style but worthless if they won’t stay on
1.0,Wouldn’t liked burgundy color as advertised not red.
1.0,My xoxo is more like a medium.
1.0,I did not purchase Amazon's custom t-shirt. Why would anybody pay $30 for a plain t-shirt? Releasing this over priced novelty service seems awfully gratuitous during this struggling economy.
1.0,The back of the watch fell off because the o ring degraded and broke. Of course is outside the return window and is a total loss. Don’t bother even considering this watch.
1.0,this is not as pictured. Color is off. Not made the same way.<br />Cheap material like pyjamas
1.0,Sizing must be from some bizarro world because XL fit like a Small. Had to return. Looked like it could have been a nice shirt otherwise.
1.0,"This is a size Large, I’m a 30DD<br />This bra actually hurts it’s so tight! I can’t return because I had to have a white sports bra for a certain date! It was nearly $20 & I was hoping for a cool light summer sport bra. For sizing reference I’m always a large in CK sports bras. I’m 120 pounds very athletic build. This bra is definitely what we’ve all come to know as Asian size. I held this up to an old Walmart sports  bra that was a size small & this is actually the same size!"
1.0,Pretty earrings if they were so tarnished. Now I know why so low rating.
1.0,I don't like，it is so bad
1.0,Broke after like a week 😩
1.0,Doesn't fit loose.
1.0,Did not receive what was advertised. What I got is a seamless two piece swimsuit from a secondhand costume shop. Nothing at all similar to what other reviewers have shown.
1.0,Buyers beware!!!! I bought 3 pairs of these leggings for workouts in a size 2X. I ended up giving them to my daughter who wears a small and is 108 lbs and they fit HER well. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Material was very poor quality and transparent.  Not the look I was going for.
1.0,Honestly the hoops was to small not wide enough to fit in my nose so had to throw them away only so I can only use the studs that came with it
1.0,Looks great but not durable did not last the winter.
1.0,"The whole body jumper Was see-through, the material just didn’t feel as I expected it was going to be. I ended up going to Charlotte ruse and buying a super cute jumper for half the price and better quality"
1.0,8 sizes too big
1.0,I ordered a medium (usually I wear a small) and the medium way way too small for an adult.
1.0,The band wore out within 6 weeks.
1.0,The weird pleating at the bottom makes it look like there is a baby under there....really ugly.
1.0,Too tight and uncomfortable.
1.0,"Advertised as a nice purple on black, came as a red on black."
1.0,it is very cheaply made and the material is cheap also.
1.0,"I really want to like the dress, it was absolutely perfect. Exactly what I have been looking for and the quality is great for the price. BUT I ordered black every single time. First time I was like ok it’s an easy mistake. Sticker on the bag says black but it’s very RED and came in a clear bag. Very easy to notice as soon as you open up the amazon bag. But the fit was great so I returned ordered another black and guess what..yep RED. Same thing black stick but red dress I really liked it so...yes I know I did it a 3rd time. I bet you can guess..RED. AGAIN! My fault clearly for trying so many times. But I really liked it. Tried to reach out to the seller to hopefully exchange and let them know it happened 3 times. No answer, so I’m left with no black dress and leaving a bad review."
1.0,Toooooo tight couldn't put feet in. Plus they charge you to restock them🤬🤬🤬
1.0,Pant size is inaccurate.
1.0,Crap!
1.0,"The fabric is fine, a little clingy. The fit is fine. The top itself is a little long/doesn’t make sense with the fabric. The color is completely off. I ordered the OMGreen expecting a teal shade transitioned to black. This is more of a sky blue to grey. Disappointed."
1.0,And not nearly as pretty as the picture presents. I sent it back
1.0,"Unfortunately, it was so poorly made that it came apart in no time at all. Stocking stuffer quickly was a complete disaster."
1.0,It was nothing like the picture! Very disappointed
1.0,Falls down constantly.  DO NOT BUY THIS
1.0,"Nice dress, just didn’t fit my breast size."
1.0,No support at all
1.0,"smaller then description, did not come with leather wrapped mallet &#34;  this was the reason I spent more money for this one .&#34;Cheap paint. Bad loud pitch sound."
1.0,No quick release!  I was looking for the quick release that you can pull off using your thumb nail.  This item does not have that.  I will definitely be returning it.<br /><br />It looks fine other than that though.
1.0,"The product is a foam very flimsy helmet, not as pictured at all. To return it, it would cost more than the purchase. Extremely disappointing."
1.0,They where really cute but broke almost immediately ( as I was removing them from my face the arm broke off ) don't waste your money.
1.0,"I buy dresses from Amazon all the time, where I wear a large. This dress had it owns sizing. It was a bit to small. I shipped it back"
1.0,"After having the necklace for a little under a week, I went to take the necklace off only to have it fall  into my hand. The actual chain links broke and I’m unable to repair it.<br />R, Mckinnon"
1.0,"Very short chain, more like a choker"
1.0,Very cheaply made. The leaf one broke the first day I wore it.
1.0,Dislike it’s too small
1.0,It was very slinky material which is not flattering if your a short curvy gal. The material is almost like nylon rayon material.
1.0,"I am very disappointed with these socks. Purchased a pair for my wife for christmas. After only an hour or so of wearing them the non slip treads started falling off. (we have very smooth, engineered hardwood floors.) Was hoping for a better quality product from Dr. Scholl's."
1.0,"Not what i expected..this is not even fabric,  feels like plastic,  i cant even wrap around my hair, waste of money and my time."
1.0,This product was made in China..The sizes are smaller that what it is listed
1.0,The gold color looks nothing like the picture. It’s too bold and orange.
1.0,I bought this dress a size larger to ensure that it fitted. It perfect not too tight but as it should fit. I had the dress on for less than 4 hours mainly sitting down and the zipper broke. I was able to zip it back up and it kept splitting apart. The zipper is very flimsy and lacks quality. I wish I would of read the reviews prior.
1.0,Sheds too much lint snd stitches coming off.
1.0,NOT what the picture looks like. It’s a strange Velcro head strap mask that doesn’t come down adequately over the face.<br />I would return it but it costs more to return it than I’d get back.
1.0,"Wow! What a Nike disappointment. Material is too tight no matter what the size, it’s thin as paper and just is not flattering. I hate it . I’d give them no stars if i could"
1.0,Not very good material heart looks very faded
1.0,This pearl set looks very tacky and is obviously cheaply made. This would be good only to give to a kid for dress up and is not deserving of even one star :(
1.0,"Did not fit well, looks cheap."
1.0,was about 3 sizes off from what it said .was cheap polyester the print is terrible .the pictures look like a big cotton sweat shirt .don't waist your money
1.0,The ring looked really fake. Like something out of a quarter machine. Would be great for kid's play jewelry but not as elegant for adults.
1.0,If I could give it no stars I would. Misrepresentation of the product. The corsages are half the size they appear in the picture. They arrived crushed in a small plastic bag. Do not waste your time.
1.0,"Cheap, too small, and wouldn't keep anyone warm..Didn't realize it was coming from China I would never have ordered it...Looks good in the pic, but believe me ugly and doesn't look like that in person.. Not worth the cost sending it back to China.  Will let my cat sleep on it. Would be too embarrassed to give it too the poor, and wouldn't keep them warm anyway."
1.0,Very cute but they do not stay laced.  Had to glue the ends to wear them for a longer time other than just one hour.
1.0,These are extremely cheap house slippers.  There is very little padding - you can feel the floor when walking.  They are so big in width that they won’t stay on my feet.  These are the equivalent of dollar store quality.
1.0,Item was never delivered.
1.0,"This is the most annoying bag ever.  The pocket in the middle just lays on top of all of your stuff, and you can't find anything in here...hate this purse"
1.0,Cheap! Don't buy!
1.0,"I am average height and this dress was still very big on me.<br />After getting it tailored and wearing it once,  it was a disaster being that the material is 100% NOT breathable what so ever!!!<br /><br />Would never recommend or buy again!!!"
1.0,The metal in the dress is horrible
1.0,Was surprised. Have to think about your sliver? Sliver
1.0,This dress is not the same! The flowers are hot glued on and i am 5’5 & 135lbs and I look pregnant in this giant dress. It’s puffy and looks cheap
1.0,"I ordered my normal size of a medium; however, the top was way too big. The top is also not shapely. Disappointed with this purchase—so I returned it for a refund."
1.0,"Wanted for Halloween. Item arrived a week late, after Halloween. Would not have worn it anyway... does not look like the picture advertised. Color is a sherbet orange, not the nice rust fall color shown. Very thin cheap material; not like what is shown. Looks like a child’s nightgown. Plus, it’s huge. Trying to return, instead am offered 20% refund.<br />I Do NOT recommend this item / seller."
1.0,Such mixed feelings about these.  Comfort level - great!  Material - fantastic!!! Cut - what happened???  There is a strange flap/wing/extra material which makes the shorts stick out on the side.  I can’t figure it out.  I certainly don’t see the issue on the model!
1.0,Received an octopus not a violin
1.0,Wayyyy too long and the material was not what I expected doesn’t look like the picture to me
1.0,"Beautiful, but doesn't protect your phone. Before the first week was broken and lost all the embellishments. By the way, I'm a very careful woman. I don't recommend this product."
1.0,The white was completely see through.  Like I could only have worn it as a beach cover up at best.  I returned immediately.
1.0,Super cheap quality item. Very disappointed!
1.0,Material was too thin so it made the dress clingy ... Shoulders did not fall like picture...
1.0,"clasps were so cheap, they won't stay closed."
1.0,Bad product.
1.0,Broken on day two
1.0,"First, one star review for deceptive listing. Multiple times the company name, Shenmr-US, is used and claims of being the only authorized Isopho dealer on Amazon, as well as claims of ""fulfilled by Amazon."" This is not a US company, product shipped from China and was a week late.<br /><br />Vest has no brand name on the tag and is not 100% fleece as the posting claims. Sizes are stupid small. Size chart is ridiculous. I wear a large to XL shirt. I had to order a XXXXL vest. It fits snug. This is asinine. Half the clothes at Walmart are made in China and they have the correct sizes on them. I don't know why sellers on Amazon all have to reinvent the size chart.<br /><br />Now, if you are still with me through this, the vest actually works pretty good. Used it twice so far, lowest setting under a flimsy wind breaker and kept me toasty so far. I'd give it 4 stars for function. Word of warning, do not wear directly on skin. I had a thin undershirt the first time and got a little too tasty on the heating pads."
1.0,"I ordered this cover up because I loved the beautiful floral pattern and it looked long enough to hide all my problem spots in a swim suit. BUT the one I ACTUALLY received was 100% not the one pictured!! The pattern isn't even floral AT ALL and the length is about half of what the one pictured is.  The only up side is that the ugly one I received fits, so I'll at least have SOMETHING to wear for my vacation next week."
1.0,"It doesn’t have Any material around the neck.<br />It is advertised as polo shirt, but it is not a polo shirt."
1.0,Looks better online. Mine came with no gold around it.
1.0,Took forever to get here. Then by the time it did it was past the time I would be able to return them. Size is WAY OFF!! I could barely get them past my knees and I ordered my normals size 12. Looks like there is fabric under the rips....yeah nope.
1.0,It damaged my pillow case .. it leaks color .. I want a refund asap
1.0,Cheaply made lasted 1 day. U get what u pay for😢
1.0,It arrived in shambles. Literally broken everywhere beyond repair. I was really disappointed
1.0,Fit weird. Poor design. Should have returned it since I've never been able to wear it.
1.0,Returned. Fit awkward even going by manufacturer's size chart.
1.0,The shamrocks stretched and looked weird
1.0,I ordered a 2-3T for my daughter and the top that arrived was so large it fit me. (5’6” 107#) ridiculously off sized.
1.0,I don’t even want to rate! It said for sashes! This is so misleading! I will be returning ASAP! I should have read the reviews first!
1.0,That colors it's not come out like what I see on the post!
1.0,Cheap. I'll give you a dollar for them.
1.0,Came super late and was TOO BIG
1.0,reALLY SMALL
1.0,This is a knock off do not purchase. The material is super thin compared to actual 32 degrees
1.0,The neck lining was way too large. I never wore anything like it. I didnt like it.
1.0,"I was excited to receive these earrings as they are simple and work well with anything.  However, one of the earrings won't close when it is in my ear without a real fight.  I am just not using them right now.  I hope my husband will be able to fix them so I can start using them!"
1.0,"These gloves looked lovely, but the quality of the suede was very poor and thin. I wore them only three times before several holes appeared in the suede."
1.0,love its made well too bad im too big im 5'9 and it just too small its big on my niece so im keeping it but if this is the largest size i will not order clothing again.
1.0,"Very bad quality, braked first day"
1.0,"The order came on time which is great...I could say that's enough....<br /><br /> This product is junk.<br /><br />Not what I was expecting at all. Put &#34;case&#34; on my phone, it stuck to my window, after two or  three times I tried to put it on a surface and it would not stick. Cleaned it with alcohol pad that came with it, it still would not sticking"
1.0,"Neck to small, unable to get over child's head!"
1.0,The item I received is not the same as the picture.  The garment is shorter with a band across the bottom. The lower part of the sleeves are very tight and it barely pulls off the shoulder.  It’s very thin and see through.  The shirt in the picture is very cute and far from looking like what I received. The style is different. Disappointing.
1.0,The photo shows the product too different -;;
1.0,NOT HAPPY WITH THIS. VERY THIN
1.0,All the straps ripped off within 2 months!  Horrible!!!!!  DO NOT BUY THIS PURSE!!!
1.0,"Not pleased, way to tiny to even see the dolphin or zirconia stone. Wasted my money & I should have listened to other reviews."
1.0,Unhappy with this purchase. Falsely advertised as genuine leather. Most definitely not. Strong chemical smell. Very disappointed
1.0,The opening of this boot is too wide. They dont stay on while walking or being carried.
1.0,The product didn’t arrived only the bag was opened wen pick up at the mail box
1.0,worst purchase ever
1.0,Do not purchase this item.  Very poorly made I donated it immediately.
1.0,Is not that same like the picture
1.0,Pretty but very itchy
1.0,I only got one pack with 10 mask nothing else . I would never order this product again
1.0,I was looking for a simple cotton/rayon beachy dress that flows. This looked like it might work but the description lists the dress as Rayon and the tag on the dress I received reads Polyester... The fit is loose and unflattering. Material feels cheap. Returned.
1.0,"NOT WORTH ALL THE MONEY. BOUGHT FOR MY DAUGHTER AND THE MATERIAL WAS WORN THRU TO THE PURPLE LAYER WITHIN A FEW MONTHS, STARTED LOOKING VERY SHABBY AND RAGEDY,  NOT THE QUALITY I EXPECTED FROM UA.  THEY NEED A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT WITH THIS ONE."
1.0,"Beautiful and looks just like the picture, but it didn’t fit and was too delicate to be bent. I tried to do it gently anyway and it broke :("
1.0,Brought to you by the worst deal in MMA history. Buying this shirt ensures that you hate fighters and support corporate greed.
1.0,Looked good for a little bit but then it turned a dull greenish gray not worth it
1.0,Shape is round not oblong as pictured.  Way to big and heavy for necklace.  Extremely dark so that it looks black.  The clasp can't hold the weight and is flimsy.  It  was not what I expected and not really appropriate for a gift.  To big; no chain; clasp too flimsy; too dark.  What I received is not suitable for a gift.  Very disappointed.
1.0,I totally wasted my money.
1.0,very cheap. feels like you're wearing a diaper. Cheap quality wouldn't recommend.
1.0,"I returned these. The sizing was off, the length was too short, the  denim doesn't stretch and I felt they were just all around cheaply made."
1.0,Very flimsy and weak. Not worth the money
1.0,"Cute bag, but stitching gave way after 1 week."
1.0,"The eye holes of this mask do not line up with eyes of an adult or child (eye holes are too narrow for any face)....there are no other holes to allow air in and out.... I don’t think it is going to work for my 11 year old for halloween😢.  Plus it does have a heavy plastic odor.  I would give zero stars, but the minimum to leave a review is 1 star."
1.0,"These glasses are enormous. I've had many aviator glasses in the past, but I've never seen any this big. I wouln't recommend them."
1.0,No buy this bracellet because no close. I lost My new warm.<br />Regards<br />Itzel
1.0,Need really small tits for this
1.0,This product is wayyyyyy too small :(
1.0,This item I got in 3XXX it was so small it didn't even fit my daughter who wears a large.  Cost more to ship it back for a refund so just ate the money.
1.0,"The tunic posted is not what I received. The one I received has a tight bottom edge and tight arms from the elbow to the wrist. I am extremely disappointed since the picture clearly shows the full bottom, which is what I wanted. Now I know why it was on sale. Don't buy if you are expecting what is pictured."
1.0,Size not in proportion and way too short.
1.0,Broke while talking them off.  Only had them 2 weeks.
1.0,Size was not at all accurate
1.0,Poor material....looks like a costume
1.0,VERY POOR Product. After just 4 months the soles of both slippers have split open and the toe of one just ripped from the sole.  Would NOT recommend this product!!
1.0,Horribles mala calidad
1.0,This is not the original team India cap. Even the stitching is defective.
1.0,Loved this watch for the first three years I owned it...then the “glow in the dark/easy to read” numbers started drying up and falling to the bottom of the crystal case.  Contacted Luminox and was told it was a common issue but my watch was outside warranty.  Would love to buy again but just do not sequentially buy “expensive” replacements every 3 years.
1.0,Tough to read instructions
1.0,They were both the same instead of opposites so I have two horns that fit one side of my head.
1.0,"The design is cute but the shirts they use are terrible.  None of the seams are straight so not only does the shirt sit poorly on your body but it's a pain to fold.  Also, they want you to pay almost $4 to return and item that is defective."
1.0,"I ordered a mask with the Totoro character, but it never materialized, I do not recommend this company I got something the really was nothing similar that ."
1.0,Some strings where longer then others
1.0,Thin almost see through material that is very uncomfortable. Fits very small.
1.0,Looks as advertised but it has an awful smell I haven't been able to remove. Unwearable.
1.0,terrible quality Definitely a knock off
1.0,The cross is nice enough but I misunderstood it to be gold and black from the picture.  The chain is not a good choice as it does not have a good hooking system.  There was no way to know when ordering this was from China which makes returning a big hassle.
1.0,The inside of the buckle is very abrasive. One day with this belt and the leather is scratched badly and looks terrible.
1.0,"When I first put the band on my fitbit, everything seemed fine. I gave each half a tug and both seemed firmly in place.  However, after wearing it a few minutes, it popped apart.  Upon closer inspection, the pins are a milimeter or two too short. Very disappointed."
1.0,Cheap not well made at all
1.0,This is very difficult to manipulate and size by yourself the style is nice but I had to send it back. Very disappointed
1.0,yea these were nothing like the picture theres no way for them to go up the ear like that they look like weird dangly earring. when i try to make them turn like that they fall out. at least they were only $2
1.0,"The wearable length is shorter than any of the tunnels I have. The actual flared part isn’t really much of a flare, if I had these in for maybe 2 weeks of my ears being stretched they would push right right like nothing."
1.0,Discolored after wearing it twice! Nice design but plan on getting only one - two uses out of it
1.0,"I bought this purse in June 2017 and the zipper broke in December. It is a very pretty looking purse. I contacted Ilishop and they emailed me &#34; your item was fulfilled by Amazon, please contact amazon to solve the problem.&#34; Unfortunately, there is no return or replace option 6 months after purchase. Another complaint is that the interior vertical pockets are too shallow. If I put glasses or a phone in the pocket, I can no longer zip up the purse--that is, if the zipper worked anyway."
1.0,The outside shorts are a large that fit like a medium. The highly elastic lining inside is at least a xxl. The phone pocket is so big there is no way it would hold a phone. There is absolutely no support from the lining.
1.0,"The item came in a timely manner, was packaged well, and was easy to return. The item I received was not at all what I wanted. Or what was pictured and sold to me."
1.0,stones so tiny cannot hardly see what color they are.
1.0,"Cute but they broke three days later, very disappointing"
1.0,I knew images on these items are always fake but I expected this to at least all be the same color. The thread is not the same color as the rest of the beaded piece. I waited 5 weeks for this... Do not buy these.
1.0,"Look very cheap and old, some parts are rusty."
1.0,Doesn't even fit the watch properly. ok item
1.0,"this is not rayon. this is linen. it is stiff, wrinkly, and not flowy AT ALL. I was so disappointed because i really wanted to like this but it’s garbage to be honest. hard return."
1.0,I liked the way the boots fit every time I wore them. What I did not like about them is the cracking of the leather or fabric over the feet area.
1.0,Skirt came defective
1.0,We got 2 of the wrong item. It was supposed to be pinky promise necklace. but instead was 2 circles. I will return and reorder. Hoping to get the correct items next time. Thank you
1.0,Fit way too tight. I cant Even put it on my body. Waste of money.
1.0,Very cheap material and runs very small. Looks nothing like the picture.
1.0,This shirt was more like an XL.  Not at all what I expected.  Will definitely have to return.  Looking for return information now.
1.0,The strap broke the second time I went to wear it.
1.0,just not very good quality
1.0,"Way to small we Ordered a XXL and my husband is usually a L and it was way to small! Couldn’t even get his legs in the legs holes! If you order, order 3 sizes bigger 🤷🏼‍♀️"
1.0,I bought 2 pair of these and both didn't last long. On one pair the coating peeled off the lenses on the other the arm broke off the ear piece with very gentle use.
1.0,"I hate giving products poor reviews, but these were definitely not Sterling silver. Very misleading."
1.0,The coat is nothing like the last one I purchased a few years ago. The down comes out all the time all over my clothes. The sleeves are open  so the cold just rolls up your arm. I would love to send it back because I am not happy or wearing it at all.
1.0,I should have looked closer at the picture.  The hour hand is not over the luminous ring.  You won't know what hour it is.  Why would anyone design a luminous watch like this.
1.0,Way too small and thin. Work okay as underwear only.
1.0,3xl should fit women's 24. That's what I normally wear. But the sizing for these shirts are more like a size 14.
1.0,"I bought this as the recommended 2T/3T size. My 2 1/2 year old is tall but not chunky. This outfit was too small in the butt area and didn’t stretch tall enough to fit over her shoulders. Definitely not true to size, as most 3T clothing is still big on her."
1.0,"I hope you don't have muscular calves. If you do, the stretch on these make the logos look absolutely ridiculous."
1.0,100% polyester No linen or cotton!
1.0,These are not the glasses shown in the ad!!
1.0,"Color was nice, but bodice was stiff not comfortable, and had to pay $48 to USPS to return to company in China, overall very disappointed."
1.0,"Cheap and poorly constructed. Ripped at first wearing, don't waste your money."
1.0,"Thin and flimsy and fell apart with one wearing.  What should have been fun for at least a whole season, was not."
1.0,"They look cheaply made. When you decide you would rather just return them,you can't.  The return label does not include shipping which as it turns out, is the same as the price of the pants."
1.0,"This fits really bad, the seam comes to the front across the bust line , looks bad. will not wear it."
1.0,SUPER THIN see through!!!Don't buy it.
1.0,"The sleeves were awful bat wings, but too short!"
1.0,"Ordered a size 28, they sent me a size 42!!! Like they heard I had money to waste!! The suit has no use to anyone close to me right now!! Waste if money and was so expensive on top of it!!!"
1.0,"What you will notice about my order (see photos) is that the actual item was missing. I got a blank envelope! So disappointed, was supposed to be a gift for the nurse that helped me with my cancer treatment!"
1.0,Ripped in 2 days....better to go to walmart and buy their dollar ones.
1.0,Product is very big for size advertised. Spelling makes no sense. I'm kind of embarrassed that I even purchased this.
1.0,I did returned this items because it was loose
1.0,"I'm 5'1&#34; about 105lbs. I bought a pair of XS in Raisin. These pants fit amazingly and are very comfortable. However, there is a BIG con. While exercising, the sweat is VERY visible; Therefore, I would not recommend these pants. I'm so bummed!"
1.0,"This dress is huge. I ordered a medium, and I could have easily fit into a small. The fabric is horrific. The only positive thing I can say about this dress is that it was cheap."
1.0,It is not possible to use a low quality taking a long time to delivery in China. garbage!!!
1.0,The actual pants don't look anything like the item pictures.  The style is completely different. The fabric is very thin and very poor quality.  Just horrible.
1.0,"I received the wrong item. Bag said black ombre, inside were long blue earrings."
1.0,Cheap material  save your money
1.0,Plastic is super shoddy. Used the ball hoop ring in my lip and within one week the ball snapped in the middle of the night when it was bit down on. I am lucky that I woke up and did not swallow the piece that broke off.
1.0,"Have bought from this company before and loved them, this pair is horrible, ugly, misshapen, nasty looking, have grease on one knee, are garbage, the fit is awful, very disappointed, will make a great cleaning rag I guess"
1.0,Felt cheaply made
1.0,Great belt. Just not nickle free. Come on?
1.0,cut some what small
1.0,broken necklace
1.0,Was too big and bulky and broke after two days don’t recommend.
1.0,I used to like these boots a lot.  This was my 3rd pair.  Almost immediately the grommets where the laces go through started popping out.  I'm now missing 3.  Very disappointing.  Didn't bother returning them because I had already thrown out the packaging.  Don't know if I'll buy this brand again.
1.0,The quality sucks. I had it for one month and all of the stitching came loose.
1.0,Fragile breaks fast even without dropping
1.0,Cheaply made. Absolutely NO support. Don't waste your time or money.
1.0,Turned black
1.0,"Tuve que regalarlo, porque el size que pedi, no me quedó. Muy pequeño."
1.0,I like the shirts but the size is smaller than experted I'll re buy a size bigger
1.0,"Really cheaply made - if you dropped these things one time or sat on them, they would probably snap.  Looking through them feels very strange, the color or something is off, and I couldn't drive with them.  Will never wear them."
1.0,"not enough room for the eyes, too tight, looks creepy"
1.0,Very cheaply made. Wore them for five minutes and the heel broke off from the boot. Was not impressed. Super cute but could be made better.
1.0,"I wish I could give this product zero stars. Horrible wig, bought 2 adult size for my 12 year old daughter & friend to wear, it fits like kid's size. Fullness & color are nothing like the picture. If I could return it, I totally would have, but it's too late. Save your money."
1.0,Otherwise it's a great style of buckle/belt mechanics and the material the belt is made of is great so I will be replacing the buckle to extend the life of the belt.
1.0,way too big<br />a lot heavier and bigger than I thought<br />not dainty or feminine.
1.0,Both my girls had infected ear holes within 3 days of wearing these. I don’t believe they are stainless as advertised.
1.0,Go up 3+ sizes if you want it loose
1.0,Broke right off.
1.0,Product looks nothing like the picture. Has a horrible smell as well.
1.0,Very poor quality. The surface is smooth and hard resulting in foot sliding around.
1.0,The 23in wheel broke the second I received it from the luggage pickup belt. Then as i went to open the luggage the zipper broke. All in one trip. Save your money ! Only if I can get a replacement for the medium size. I can’t believe all that damage for one trip.<br />What a hassle.
1.0,Doesn’t fit anyone in my house hold.
1.0,"They're so cute in the photos, but the reality is that even though the description said 'adult' and 'mens' in multiple places... these are for VERY very young children - maybe age 6-7? And once you put the on and they're even slightly stretched... they lose the image and look dull/gray/worn. They have now become rather pricey barbie sleeping bags!"
1.0,I'm so sad that it was broken when it arrived...It fit perfect and was really pretty...For the price I knew it would be the best quality..but I thought I could get at least 1 wear out of it...
1.0,The print of this shirt has a silhouette of a man's buttocks and penis.
1.0,This watch is garbage.
1.0,This was supposed to be a size large. It was very very small. The white denim one I purchased fit fine.  This one is definitely mid sized. I need to figure out how to return it
1.0,Item did not fit like shown in picture.
1.0,Not the best quality. Don’t recommend. Cute color though! Would have been nice
1.0,Item arrived and the resin was separated at seams/broken item.
1.0,"Although these are exactly what I wanted, I am disappointed in the quality.  The pulls are double sided and the imprint is just a sticker.  I have only had them a couple months and there is a sticker missing on each one.  I realize this isn’t a hi dollar item, but I would still like it to have decent glue."
1.0,"These are made for people with bird legs. So, so small and tight in the leg. And I’m not a large person. Just an uncomfortably tight sock."
1.0,The lace was torn prior to wearing.  Would not buy again.
1.0,The watch was broken out of the package with the minute hand flopping around freely inside the watch face.  Very disappointing.
1.0,Wow. The &#34;pearl&#34; is almost as big as my palm. Nothing of what I expected it to look like. Will have to get another gift for a friend. The &#34;pearl&#34; isn't even glued on straight.
1.0,Very disappointed. Broke within a month.
1.0,"If I could give zero stars I would. Maybe all the good reviewers got lucky and actually got the shirt in the picture but I didn’t. I got a cheap knock off. It is poor quality,has a slight sheen to it and material is not as pictured. It  took forever to get here and what a disappointment"
1.0,DO NOT PURCHASE! The Phillips Screwdriver is crap. The screw they put into the fittings are so tight they strip out and the screwdriver stripped the first turn. I used one of my own and by the time I tried taking the screw out it was also stripped out. What a bad purchase this was...
1.0,"It was too low cut for my girl and the bottoms were a bit too big. She loved the color, just wished it fit better"
1.0,Not good for the money.  Didn't work with voice
1.0,Irregular fit and run small even the hood which usually fits is too tight
1.0,It fits great but turned quickly.
1.0,I swear I ordered a small but received a large. There was no where to double check to see what size I ordered. So I sent it back and I am hesitant to order again.
1.0,It was not attractive on.  I am an apple shaped woman so this look just made it worse.  Plus it ran Really big in size!
1.0,"Came broken - very unhappy about that. Actually broken is inaccurate - it was not broken in shipping or anything, the eyepiece was entirely missing!"
1.0,The dress arrived almost four weeks afterwards. Too late! No free return shipping! Size was way smaller. I wear an 18. Couldn’t even get the buttons to come close to buttoning. Almost $30 to return. Wouldn’t recommend.
1.0,i hate it!  i've never been able to wear it -
1.0,Had problems with the product and reordered three times. Would not order again.
1.0,It arrived defective two times. I really like the product but I ordered it the first time and found that the bra hooks are not there so exchanged it and the same thing the second time too.
1.0,"Small sizing is the least of the problem. This is a very uncomfortable franken-fabric that itches, smells and promotes sweating. It is an altogether uncomfortable bra. The crossover back is quite nice, unfortunately it is useless with fabric that promulgates rashes and heavy sweating with the least effort.  Sizes run quite small, I saw in the reviews so I ordered a larger size than I would normally, it was still small for me. Pricey in any case, this is not a worthy buy for your hard earned money.  I handwashed this with expensive cleanser for lingerie but that did not make a difference."
1.0,Cheap and broke within the first day of having this item.
1.0,Too small not US XL and not worth paying to send back postage  to high.
1.0,"I have had good luck with other ROMWE clothing but this one was a dud. Much too small and the fabric was thin and scratchy. Also, the seams on the bottom were a little uneven. It's not super noticeable though so I gave the dress to my stepdaughter and she wears it sometimes."
1.0,This is very cheap.  I expected much better quality.  I returned the item and got a much better belt at a big box store.
1.0,I want the full refund
1.0,i’m 5’3 and these pants were high waters on me. they looked sooo bad. they looked like capri’s on me. they’d be perfect for anyone under 5’3
1.0,"Horrible! The material is beyond cheap- its paper thin. I have never felt ""jean cotton"" like this. I feel like before the summer is over I will accidentally snag on something and these things will be ruined. Will be returning. Also, not high waisted- just badly made."
1.0,"I'm pretty disappointed in this bench.  Aside from how it looks online and the fact that there are no logos on it, I have nothing good to say about it.  First it took forever to be delivered, then when it finally arrived, I opened it and saw that the cushioning was damaged.  It smelled very strong and awful.  The quality of this bench is probably the worst I've ever seen for workout equipment.  The board for the backing of the cushion is so incredibly thin that I could bend it so easily and likely break it.  I wouldn't even sit on the ends that don't have the metal support directly under it.  It's simply not safe."
1.0,"This is the same picture that was used in the previous orders i placed from Tom Cat so i thought great I will get one more.  Well is wasn't the same.  This one is cheaply made!!  It is not the same material at all or the same color.  It you can get the one on the Tom Cat page get that one for sure.  I am returning this one it is so bad.....no stars.  I am giving it one star because the system will not allow me to not give a star.  It is not right that they can use the same photo, beware."
1.0,This boot is gorgeous but the size is not accurate at all. I order a 11 my sister wear an 8 fit her perfect.
1.0,Not good quality .. looks  cheap
1.0,"My daughter wanted this for her & her best friend, one of the magnetic charms fell off after removing from packaging"
1.0,Never got the &#34;free&#34; american flag head band
1.0,Did not get the ear rings
1.0,"Unbelievably bad quality, and it looks Nothing like the picture. This might be one of the worst products I've gotten from Vine, and the fact the listing shows $19.99 for something I would pass up at the dollar store is really something.  Here's a rundown of why this is junk:<br /><br />Fabric: cheapest kind of chiffon available (I am a costume designer, so I know, and I would never use this fabric for anything), completely sheer (NOT like the photo), and so light that it has no flow.<br /><br />Design: again, not like the picture. The photo shows something long and flowing, with a nice wide hem that tapers to tie on the side (or wherever). This is not cut the way you see in the photo. It is almost a rectangle, with very little at the hem, and therefore no flow. Also, it is not &#34;One Size&#34;. It is a small. I am a large (not XL, and not even a bigger large), and even if I wear it WAY too high on my waist, it still gapes open, covering nothing at all. Also, it will be too long on shorter women. I’m 5’4, and I don’t wear heels at the beach, and this drags on me. Not that I’ll be wearing it out.<br /><br />See photo for how high I’m wearing this and the huge gap still there because it’s definitely not one size.<br /><br />Overall: This is not the product in the photo, and it is Very poorly made with junky materials. Do Not Buy. Zero stars if I could."
1.0,But wire came out
1.0,Broke in 2 days
1.0,Horrid.3 sizesatrocious Too small and ugly.

1.0,Dont like the of the jeans its really weired
1.0,"The glasses did the trick, however is very fragile as it broke once it fell to the ground."
1.0,Once I got them I realized this ARE NOT BluBlockers but are advertised as blue blocking.NOT THE SAME. Returned them post haste.
1.0,I tried each of the extenders in the pack of 3. The hooks on these bra extenders do not stay fastened to the loops on the bra itself. I wouldn't recommend buying these.
1.0,Didn't quite fit the glasses. Also weight down my glasses had to keep putting them back up on my nose.
1.0,"I am an average sized American woman... size 12 5'6.5"" tall. This sweater was sized for someone about 5 foot tall or shorter. If you look at the photos, the sleeves are a bit longer than 3/4 length, the actual sleeves barely covered my elbows. The length of the body is shown on the model at mid-thigh, the actual length was grazing my hips. I think the product was grossly misrepresented by the photos!"
1.0,1 for one day so its gonna last 4 days
1.0,"Okay um no.  This was not cotton and they smelled like burnt plastic.  no matter how many times I washed them or how much perfume I sprayed on them the smell never went away, just go to forever 21.  They're the same price and the smell won't make you wanna kill yourself."
1.0,"Bought this for a gift. The printing was not very good at all. Went ahead and gave it to my nephew so he could wear it, but not so happy with the purchase."
1.0,Didn't fit the bracket I had the hook is to small.
1.0,These glasses are terrible....they break so quickly that you may as well not even wear them!
1.0,"Material looks so cheap, which gives your skin an itch when you wear it. There is not even a label on the dress. Somebody must have rushed doing the dress, it was poorly made. It’s a waste of money."
1.0,"Reading reviews prior to buying, I saw mixed reviews on how these fit. To be safe, since I wear a 2X, I ordered a 3X.  Nope, no way.  It's like trying to stuff myself into a sausage casing.  These definitely run SMALL, or at least the ones I bought did.  I'd guess them to be an XL, at most."
1.0,To small to small
1.0,I am not satisfied with this product within 3 months the bag zipper broke
1.0,Absolutely LOVED the shirt!  Decided to wear it over a swimsuit to the beach….took it off and tossed it into my bag. When we we’re getting ready to leave I grabbed the shirt to throw on and the DESIGN MELTED TOGETHER!  I can not get it unstuck. I read the care instructions and it said do not dry in dryer….never would’ve thought that it would melt together outside.
1.0,"The fit and material quality of this cap is very good.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the cap also has a 3/4 inch, completely purposeless metallic badge attached at the right front -- which is hidden in the photos.<br /><br />Whose idea could it possibly have been to add this to the design (?)<br />It's stupid. It's an added manufacturing cost. And I can say unequivocally that it HAS to cause more people to NOT buy the cap (or return it, as I have done) than it could conceivably cause people TO buy it.<br /><br />What  a shame . . ."
1.0,It broke while I was placing it on my ring! Very cheaply made..... U get what u pay for!!!! Never again :(
1.0,"The material is very thin, thinner than most dresses I ordered."
1.0,Very dangerous.  Button batteries.  Kids can easily  get to and ingest
1.0,"The pants look and fit nicely. However, the material is very thin. I wore the pants for a week and washed them one time, already growing holes in the seat.<br /><br />Don't buy these shorts!!!"
1.0,rough bracelet
1.0,Fogs up and creates condensation
1.0,I burnt my arms wearing this outside for only a short time!!!!!!!  The fabric must have something that heats up when exposed to the sun!
1.0,I opened 3 out of the 5 and all of the clasps were stuck closed and broke when I tried to gently open them. I didn't even bother opening the other 2. I know they're supposed to be cheap but I didn't even get one wear out of them. Waste of money.
1.0,Love the hoodie but not true to size. I ordered a 3xl and doesn’t fit
1.0,"Thick, heavy, bulky.  I'll keep it in the trunk of my car to give to someone who needs an umbrella some day.  In the meantime, I bought my favorite, a Totes umbrella, which is what I've used for many, many years.  I don't know why I even considered another brand.  Guess I was enchanted by the silver lining - but I never have the occasion to stand out in the hot sun in the middle of the day in Texas summers and I doubt this would be any better than anything that provide shade (including a piece of cardboard)."
1.0,"The picture they show is completely misleading.i needed the color they show, bright pink, but it is actually absolutely purple. I went with the photo. In fairness they do call the bright pink, purple."
1.0,"Wife wore this- cheap, cheap, cheap! Too small for average size head. &#34;Hair&#34; was coming  apart before wearing."
1.0,It looks like it came out of a quarter machine! Junk!
1.0,"Ordered 3 russell hoodies from amazon, all in XL. 2 came XL this came in medium didn't realize until I started wearing these during sports season. Now stuck with this item and had to buy another black XL locally. These kind of problems really make me second guess making online purchases"
1.0,"The fit was great, but the material was thin & see-through"
1.0,All my other cookie fits fitted nice this one was small
1.0,Horrible color!!<br />I purchased this blouse because I thought the pale pink was such a pretty color. The pink blouse I received is a hot pink! Yuck!! Not what I wanted.
1.0,I like that it came on time but I ordered a small and the dress and hat fits like it's supposed to be a large but the leg warmers are suffocating i could almost not get them off.. I am swimming and suffocating in this thing and I plan on returning it. Not to mention it is made out of some of the cheapest costume materials I've ever seen.
1.0,"I always wear XL in shirts but this one was way too small. The color was not true to the picture. I got an ugly, dark, camo green."
1.0,Received an item that looks nothing like the picture

1.0,The padding and shape is horrible!
1.0,"They don't get as dark as the add shows, lenses fall out when you try to clean them JUNK!"
1.0,They feel too tight on my head but they don't stay in place. If I just move my head around they move out of place and I have to adjust. These are very uncomfortable. I tried giving them to a friend thinking it might just be my head. But she tried them on and had the same issue. These will be going to Goodwill.
1.0,This is labeled 3x and fit terribly small other 3x sizes fit fine!
1.0,These pants feel like pj pants vs yoga or workout pants.  Also the left leg of the pant is at least 1- 2 inches shorter.  Terrible product !!
1.0,You must have small  fingers don't like
1.0,"I loved this sweater when it arrived. It was a bit thinner than I hoped for, but the fit was cute and I liked the waffle detail and zipper pull. However, after two washes the sweater is pilled and looks awful. I'm super disappointed that I spent $30 on a sweater with such a short life."
1.0,"Doesn't go all the way to the knee, pulls on toes during 12h shift and causes feet to hurt. Cute styles, but that's it 👎"
1.0,The product is made of flimsy cheap material.. not at all as pictured.  I opened it and handed it to my little sister and said you can have it.  That'll teach me to buy cheap stuff..
1.0,"It smelled horrible, like mildew or mold. We tried a vinegar soak overnight, then we tried leaving in baking soda... nothing worked. We threw it away."
1.0,"Ordered a size up and it is still too small, not what i expected"
1.0,"this product was in the freezer 2 days, so completely froze. it lasted no more than 5 mins and it was completely warmed up. complete and utter waste of money. at this point it feels like there could be a lawsuit for fraudulent advertising."

1.0,"I threw this item away don't worry about a return, it just wasn't worth returning&#34; no disrespect&#34;it look like it came from the dollar store and it was poorly made."
1.0,Not even close to the website description
1.0,"I have thin wrists and these bands were still so loose on my wrist even when it was tightened all the way, my watch just spun on my wrist. I was a little disappointed because I thought it would tighten more. If you have twig wrists like me, it's definitely not a good buy."
1.0,Its too tight and it hurts my ear. Totally not comfortable at all.
1.0,Ordered a women's large and what I received was a child size!!! Would not recommend
1.0,Product is very uncomfortable.  The buckles are huge I would not recommend sitting down with them on because they are uncomfortable.  The straps would not let out far enough to accomodate an average length shirt tail.  I threw the box away too quickly or I would return them.  Totally useless.
1.0,Shoes were most uncomfortable - returned. Did not meet expectations as described.
1.0,This was sent to me unfinished! No clasp and the ring was cracked off from the bracelet!  And now I have to go through the trouble of returning it!!

1.0,Super cheap quality. Lesson learned for me. Eay smaller than I expected. My 3Xl fits like a regular large. PI will be reading the reviews for all purchases moving forward.
1.0,"Upon receipt, looks very cheap; rose gold color is not flattering. Also, I ordered multiple colors (so I could wear together for 2 of my pets), and this one was half the size of the other one. I do not recommend this color or this specific piece."
1.0,Not for high impact activity. Offers almost no support.
1.0,Only 7&#34; tall

I've not had a problem ordering boots online before, but I don't know how anyone could wear these..."
1.0,"Fits right, looks beautiful but the material itches a lot. I just can’t wear it.  I give it one stars ⭐️ because it looks nice but in my closet because of the material."
1.0,threw it out just this morning-way tooooooo tight
1.0,This fell apart literally the first time I wore it. The hot glue was not enough to keep the ball on top or the bow on it. The clip also ripped out hair.
1.0,It taste really awful..: (
1.0,I got an extra large but the bus would have to fit a woman that has a's are very small B cup I have a Dcup and it was only a nipple guard for the top very disappointed

1.0,It smells terribly!
1.0,"Usually, when I purchase food handlers gloves, it comes in a box for easy access. These come in a pouch of 100 each. Basically, my workers have to fumble around just to get a pair of gloves. Gloves are very short and small considering that I ordered large size gloves. Waste of time and money. And, these come from China."
1.0,Empty envelop came
1.0,I don't have big calf muscles and these are to small and tight. They're really hard to put on and I have bought every size even the ones for big calf muscles and none of them are comfortable.
1.0,"This is overpriced at twenty-five bucks. It looks and feels like something that would be at home being sold on a blanket in Times Square or Central Park. The band is flimsy, the clasp is hard to work, and the band is almost impossible to resize. The watch itself is not even remotely accurate....I think the hands are loose, because I was constantly having to reset the time. Way more hassle than it is worth. I wouldn't even give this to my ten-year-old son as a starter watch."
1.0,I had to return wrong phone size I need for iPhone 5S will have to reorder
1.0,This product should get 0 stars bc it does NOT match what's online: red shirt with black trim was chosen. I am so disappointed. My husband will not be able to wear red in our family pictures tomorrow.  I received a polyester see through red shirt with a tan trim.
1.0,😠😠😠😠way to small
1.0,"Beautiful lace but it was stitched so tightly that there was absolutely no give. Needless to say, I am not small but I was transformed into looking like a man. And then who needs such heavy padding when you are already endowed, a light lining would have been nice. Why do bra companies insist on using such thick padding?<br />After checking out the bras I decided to removed the pads and cut off the lace, and then I got a much better fit. Not as pretty but now they are wearable. Also on the next order I will go up a size.<br />Wish I could have exchanged them but it wasn’t worth the hassle to send them back."
1.0,Thin material and really small. Would fit a child or teenager- not a woman.
1.0,Way too small. I got a 3x and I usually wear a 1-2. It doesn't even have a chance to close
1.0,This mask is junk. I ordered two thi king they would be good. They aren't. They are so cheaply made they do not seal properly. You can smell everything through them. No protection what so ever.
1.0,Lookes Cheep
1.0,The worst ankle socks ever. They’re thin and flimsy and I’ve had them for 1 month now. Maybe wear a pair or two every week at most but two have already ripped at the toe seam. Awful quality.
1.0,Not real but more like real fake. Thank you…
1.0,Waaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy too small!
1.0,"Okay, so the leopard is lovely but the necklace broke (the end came out it one of the clasps) before I even had a chance to wear it.:( Also,  the ""jewel"" is more of an orange-tomato than ruby color as indicated in the photo. The leopard spots are not really noticeable like in the photo as well. Overall, I am disappointed in this piece. Had to fix it with jewelry tools and the color is wrong. It is not expensive, so I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,The band broke the sameday
1.0,I purchased four of these hats for myself and my daughters. They are not slouch hats. They fit very tight and would fit a child better. I might return them. STOP BUYING FROM CHINA!!!!!!!!!!!

1.0,The fabric quality is bad and look bad too. It also runs very small. Overall it was bad purchase. Would not recommend it.
1.0,"Weak magnet closure! Never stays closed! This purse looks beautiful, but is NOT functional! I bought the red one.  It is an orange red, not a true red,  although it is still beautiful."
1.0,"My recommendation is to measure the rise (zipper length) of the pants/shorts you normally wear before ordering.  These have a 6&#34; rise.  I don't know who these are made for, but certainly not a male adult."
1.0,"As most skirts and pants fit more around the hips I figured this would fit.  the hip size for XL is 41.3"".<br />This is not close.<br />SheIn Women's Button Front Denim A-Line Short Skirt<br /><br />**I would like to return this, but it does not give me that option.  I purchased it in January, thinking I could wear it in the summer.  Decided to try it on now with some other clothes that did not fit.  I cant even wear this if I tried.  Very disappointing to not be able to return!!<br />Michelle"
1.0,This looks ridiculously big and it is hard to bend.
1.0,"Flimsy, thin material. Strange color. Will return."

1.0,My container came broken I was disappointed. And some piercings were not complete.

1.0,Not as expected<br />Too slim
1.0,Broke both pairs in a matter of hours.
1.0,Do not buy this watch. I bought one and it came in a very bent up casing. The watch stopped working in two weeks and I am left without my money.
1.0,"Love the cut & style but was not true to size chart. Had to return it, Which, for me is a hassle that I choose not to do again therefore, will not order from this company again."
1.0,My baby wear only once.<br />The threads seeing at the back were all loose out.<br />Dissapointed
1.0,The suit was too small.
1.0,Ordered 2 sizes larger than I wear...got stuck inside it trying to get it ever my head!  I could wear it as a hat.
1.0,Followed ordering advice but the bottom was way too tight and the top was too loose. It was a weird fit.
1.0,did not stay on.
1.0,"Terrible fit, not able to install."
1.0,Dress did not fit as the measurements were not as stated in the size chart.  Zipper was not sewn straight and the sequins were sewn into the zipper closure causing the zipper to immediately rip  as we took the zipper down.  Never again will we purchase something like this online
1.0,"These shoes are VERY cheaply made, and I expect they'd fall apart in a few months.  They're also extremely uncomfortable.  The tongue has an obnoxious seam that grates on the top of your foot.  The seams on the inside were already coming off when I took it out of the box."
1.0,Horrible quality! Flimsy! These are cheaper than cheap! The sides were broken on these glasses and they bend VERY easily! Don’t waste your money!
1.0,Really stretched out
1.0,Shirt look cheap.
1.0,"Let me start by saying I’m a huge RL fan!  Clothes, shoes, purses, housewares, etc. I love all things RL. This is first time I’ve ever questioned quality with this brand. The blouse is short and see through. Major disappointment, it looks nothing like the picture."
1.0,The material is very sheer and feels flimsily made. The sizing is also quite small. Don't recommend.
1.0,Esto solo es una falda nada que ver con la imagen por 90dolares en serio ???no puedo decir más que esta página es un robo .
1.0,I got this dress during the winter.  Perhaps in the spring/summer there is no static but boy oh boy this baby was shocking me left and right. Not good material for the winter.
1.0,Normal size was too small. So I reordered it next size up: Too big. Also after 2 washings it pilled.  Save your money...don't order this.  It isn't worth the time and effort.
1.0,"Unfortunately, these rolled off my heels from day 1. I'd hoped they would work better as they specify being fitted for up to size 13, but sadly, they run smaller. I have others that also roll off because of size -- same brand as a few pairs I have that are in a larger size and don't roll off -- so I'm pretty sure that's the issue. Really wish I could find the brand/size combo I have that works for me. The interior non-slip part of the heel on these is a series of small lines rather than a solid patch, which may also be the culprit. There are 5 or so lines, each about as thick as a line of white glue from the bottle."
1.0,Turned out to be a RAG in a month of casual wear. Became a PILLY mess. The scarf was hand washed 2X & line dried. Item had a mixture of poly & cotton fibers. Save your money!
1.0,"I bought 3 pairs of biking shorts on amazon, this one being the most expensive brand.  The padding on these shorts I found to be absolutely inferior to anything I have ever worn.  I was completely &#34;torn up&#34; after wearing these for 25 miles.  I had to wait 5 days just to heal.  The padding just does not measure up and is not substantial enough to provide sufficient protection.  I was extremely disappointed.  I will never wear them again--so a complete waist of money."
1.0,Broke in one week. Looked great for that one week...
1.0,Didn't fit right. The holes at the bottom were so small I couldn't get them over my heels/ankles. Biggest size they had.
1.0,"Very disappointed, sized for a child not an adult."
1.0,CHEAP JUNK _ BUY A HANKS
1.0,Buying options sizes 38/40 my watch is a 40 band comes saying 38 and doesn’t work and pun os broken
1.0,"If you have curves this is not the skirt for you. So disappointed. Has a bad smell as well, but sometimes frantic does that. I wouldn’t say it’s too small the fabric is just cut straight down so there is no room to fit ur curves and I’m not even that curvy so that says something."
1.0,The fit is very uncomfortable
1.0,The pants were to small and the material was not as expected
1.0,If I could give zero Stars I would. Within three days three out of five of the Rings have broken. One broke before I even wore it. The rhinestone fell out. Another one the rhinestone fell out while I was wearing it and the one with the clear balls crumbled from each side. I will never order this product again.
1.0,"Sad to say the sleeves were disproportionate, incredibly short. I Attempted to return but it came back to me saying the return address was incorrect."
1.0,Wasn't the right size
1.0,Not the right color and see through and it would fit a toddler
1.0,The minute needle is loose and keeps spinning when you move the hand around. The strap broke on day 3. Not sure if I got a faulty product.
1.0,Cute dress but not for those who like to wear undergarments.
1.0,ordered this on November 18. it said expected by December 22-January 5. its currently February 14. do not waste your money.
1.0,These are way to big for a average size nose ring.
1.0,Suggest go a 1/2 size down
1.0,Cute dress but really bad quality ☹️ First wash and this happened.
1.0,"I ordered 4 hats making sure that they would be able to stack them together to avoid wrinkles WELL NO in their weird thinking process they roll each individual hat separatly , &#34;burrito look&#34; they are obviously all messed up and now i have to spend time figuring out how to fix them<br />So upseting"
1.0,It doesn’t have a window to pee!....
1.0,"The earrings showed up and they were filthy, the silver was actually more like brown/gray and I had to wash all of them and scrub them to make them look halfway decent and then they were impossible to get clasped after I opened them up to put them on. I would not buy these again."
1.0,The fringe pieces were coming apart after getting wet. Would not buy again.
1.0,This outfit is very cheaply made and is NOT true to size. I could barely get the shirt on my 3rd old and the pants were way too short. I DO NOT recommend you buy this outfit!
1.0,"This fell apart as soon as I out it on, cheap cheap cheap save your money"
1.0,Battery ran out in two months.
1.0,"The picture has a shimmery, glittery, shiny mask (I got the purple studded one for my mother-in-law) - BUT when it arrived it is just a boring screen printed mask which they may have written in fine print but pictures are very misleading."
1.0,Arms are too long. Waist band too tight
1.0,"Frame failed at 3 short months.  After spending $300 plus dollars on the umbrella and weights, I would expect a better product.  Essentially $100 a month is what this product costs."
1.0,"Seriously as thin as a napkin, completely see though not even big enough to use as a face mask"
1.0,"If you live in a place with snow, DO NOT buy it. It gets wet so easily even with one step into the snow/puddle/mud."
1.0,". Very small, one was already missing a gem. Would not order again. Even though you get several pieces it not worth it in my opinion"
1.0,It's exactly what it looks like. Didn't come with directions. So not sure if I can cut apart or what to do with it. So I just slid it into my travel wallet. Just not worth $10.
1.0,cheap.-Not worth the money. Very disappointed.
1.0,"They are not what I expected.  Poor shape.  Hole in them and stain’s.  I would have sent them back, but my husband burnt the bag by mistake.  I’m an not happy.  They look nothing like the picture and worn"
1.0,Material is cute but a little thin and cheap but i could live with that because of the price. The color is beautiful but they literally sent me a dress with two different length straps. It’s super obvious in my photos. The thing is if the straps were both short I could wear it without crossing in the back and would have fine with it. But there’s literally maybe and inch and half to two inches different in the straps. It’s terrible. The right strap just falls off my shoulder while the left strap is nice and secure. Terribly made and not as pictured at all! Very disappointed.
1.0,Used it as a rag to wipe the floors and tossed it
1.0,"The garments arrived as described. I put the black shorts on to wear for the first time today after having washed them. I got in my car to go to work and as I sat down behind the wheel of my car, the crotch seam immediately popped and ripped out. I'd had the shorts on for 10 minutes.Had to run back in the house and change. I am not happy. I can't return them as they have been laundered so I have a pair of shorts with the crotch ripped out and one pairm however comfortable, that I am worried the crotch seam will rip out of as well. Don't buy these."
1.0,Great product at good price<br />Thanks
1.0,"This was a lot smaller than I expected, so I'll be returning it."
1.0,Fell off first day
1.0,"Not oversized at all,lens area small. Clear view .Colors are nice.<br />Updated ordered second set,lasted less than first set,All break at hinge,the plastic and all.Also get foggy after few minutes of use,Will not buy these again."
1.0,"Runs large, not a comfortable fit. Crotch ripped first use. I was so excited for these, but ended up disappointed."
1.0,The cleavage design popped as soon as I put the bra on. The material was very delicate and not securely sewn.
1.0,"take a look at the pic, looks great, ""wow"" after receiving it i was upset due the fact it was light as air, ""waste of time"""
1.0,I bought this for a Christmas present for my boyfriend. It was so embarrassing after only using it for a week and the speakers stopped working. Don’t waste your money!
1.0,Nice and thick but nearly impossible to get on and the child has to have really small hands.
1.0,Small in legs but loose at waist.
1.0,"The shoes look cute in the picture, but the design is flawed. It is truly unsafe to walk in these and they don’t fit properly. You have to pay to return them and the cost is almost the price of the product. Not worth it."
1.0,Looks NOTHING like the shirt on the model & took forever to be delivered. Buyer definitely beware!!!!
1.0,Was supposed to be a large 12/14 and was similar to a small 6/7. Purchased for my son.
1.0,So disappointed ☹️
1.0,Much too small - ordered a large and it looked like a small
1.0,"In person it looks cheap and is about 2 sizes too big, I ordered size small. Would not purchase this item agin, I am am returning it and would not recommend that anyone waste their money on this ! 👎"
1.0,The tie is too short to tie up in the back. It should be longer so it won’t be so tight around your eyes
1.0,"very disappointed. The hats are very small, almost to small for my 2 year old head and 2 of the hats fell apart after the first wear"
1.0,"This dress is super adorable, don’t get me wrong, but the zipper is beyond small and broke before I even wore it, same with the neck buttons, those just fell off, and the material is cheap and see-through."
1.0,Cheap. Don’t bother buying these.
1.0,Very pretty but tight then the band fell apart in 2 days and beads went all over the place so sad
1.0,I returned it. You can see the side of your bra through your armpits.
1.0,They look good the nose rings were excellent sturdy looked just like the photo HOWEVER the septum rings are total garbage they fall out of your nose non stop they look fake overall if you wanna wear the septum rings use them for a quick picture THAS IT !! My nose is tiny though if you have a bigger nose thease may be for you !
1.0,"Material is very low quality, cheap and itchy. So I went to return it apparently this product return is not free and costs me more to return it than keep it. So be extremely careful before you order it, its not worth your money!!"
1.0,Fell apart fast!
1.0,There are large printed words (Deauty) all over the back side of this strap. This makes it look awful (and cheap) on a bag.
1.0,"It's a weird fit and based on the extra buttons it must be a flawed attempt to copy another design. Buttons are ther but matching  buttons are to nonsensical places. Fabric is thin, cheap, synthetic. Logo on back seems to be a print. Plastic feel to it. Bought 2, 1 is a gift. Luckily it's for teens who are just happy to have some kind of anime merch...<br /><br />Plus it was on the slow boat from China. Ordered first week of Dec. Arrived in this last week of January (it said it would be here by dec 27)"
1.0,They are huge and don’t fit the average woman’s hands. They were even almost too big for my husband. They were also not close knit so it let the cold in
1.0,This scarf leaves thread all over you and your clothes. I would not recommend buying this item.
1.0,I never received this.
1.0,Dress is nice but giving 1star because the off shoulder drop is different from the picture
1.0,I have bought many shirts but this was the lowest quality I have ever received.
1.0,I too was fooled by the picture of 4 pens. Also shows 4 pens in the 3 items frequently bought together and it shows 4 pens when comparing these pens costs compared to other single pens. After receiving both orders with one pen I realized I should have read the TINY PRINT below the pens. Fool me once lose a customer for life:)
1.0,"The only person these pants are fitting is Humpty Dumpty, literally. My son could barely get his legs in the pants they were so tight and when he did he had 2 extra inches of space around the waist. Don’t “waist” your time."
1.0,"The color is good, but its so huge and now I've wasted too much money on a shirt not even close to worth it. And I think only the model could make it look good, Im not convinced it looks good on any real person ever."
1.0,Trash can liner now because it will take me more to drive and return than it’s worth
1.0,The pants were fine but the jacket was not as advertised & very small for a large
1.0,"These earrings are for a baby not women or teen girls as stated. The delivery was on time, but may not order from this seller again."
1.0,Way to small I usually where an XL this fit like a medium. I couldn't wear it at all
1.0,Description was not clear that it was a set of different sizes. Only one of which worked.
1.0,"Waste of money the watch  shutting off andcit misses time alot. Dont buy it , I am dissatisfied and disappointed."
1.0,The stone is way to small
1.0,Loved the pic. It is very small. girssong the fact that it was shipped from china is why. I can't wear it.
1.0,Within 1 month the memory foam was worn down to nothing.. won't order again
1.0,Didn't like the fit... cheap looking
1.0,"Very cheaply made, I should have known better."
1.0,Because all the edges touch the screen it keep pressing things without you even touching it. For the price they were asking is not worth it. Disappointed in this as i was really looking forward to a new watch band. I will have to dispose of this one. Dont waste the money. Keep searching
1.0,"Was disappointed... alot larger than I thought, they do not hug your nostril at all. It is impossible to try to adjust the ring without a strong plier . Don't waste your $."
1.0,Too small - will return. The material is flimsy
1.0,Smells weird.It came in a vacuum sealed package so tight I wasn’t even sure what it was. When I opened it up I realized how cheap it was. By American!
1.0,I like the color material seems cheap
1.0,Fell apart after not even 2 months of use
1.0,I haven't been able to use it.  Refund please
1.0,"Decent price, and looks pretty good. Product is almost impossible to put on the watch, and I had it fall off several times while wearing it because it did not have a strong grab on the watch. Just disappointing when you order something and it doesn't work out the way you would like."
1.0,Ordered large came in like a small
1.0,"I’ll break it down by piece:<br /><br />Suit over all extremely stiff and itchy.<br /><br />Blue color is really nice.<br /><br />Shirt: Shirts that come with suits are normally too small but this one was too big in the chest and arms. Length wise it was right on.<br /><br />Vest: Seemed almost too small as though my son would grow out of it within a few shorts weeks.<br /><br />Coat: Same as the vest. I know coats are designed to be a little snug in the shoulders but my son could barely lift his arms. The sleeve length seemed smaller than I’m use to. Not sure if this is part of the style/design or part of the sizing being a mess. It was a pain to get a real idea since the shirt sleeves were so huge. It was difficult getting the coat over the shirt sleeves.<br /><br />Bow Tie: I thought the tie was navy blue. It’s black and looks ugly with a navy blue suit. I think it would look nice with a black suit though.<br /><br />Pants: The biggest disappointment of all. My son is tall and skinny. It’s difficult finding pants that are long enough but don’t s swallow him in the waist. Adjustable waist is a must. These pants have them but they were so long we had to hike them up past his belly button to look nice and the waist was huge, even when at the proper height. Adjusting didn’t help.<br /><br />I know my son is a tall, skinny kid but the sizing shouldn’t have been so off with length and width in arms, chest, waist, and legs.<br /><br />Returning."
1.0,Got this product before and was fine they change something because the shirt shrunk material is not the same
1.0,"Even though the description says “set of 2”, there was only 1 in the package."
1.0,"I just bought this package at WalMart, I always wash clothing before waring and one of the sock's hems unraveled. Don't bother. Not sure about how they'll stay up, the elastic doesn't seem strong.  Trying to find how to get in touch with the company. No luck so far."
1.0,The top was super small I ordered a medium. He measurements were nothing like the size I received . I am a 34d
1.0,"PLASTICKY CHROME TYPE PLATING FLAKING OFF RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX, NOT STAINLESS STEEL. Another ripoff, fake, lying and deceptive thief trying to take your money and send you garbage. I am so sick of sellers like this, that get away with it.  Luckily they have changed the description and less people will be robbed."
1.0,"I've purchased these exact models from Invicta directly. The rubber DOES NOT do well in HUMIDITY.<br />First purchase: 3 days in Florida (2016) -> Band straps began to crack<br />Second purchse: NYC (2019), band cracks during commute in the subway.<br /><br />Again, do NOT purchase if you live in a HUMID region."
1.0,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. It was described as a silicone sandwich holder, and made no mention of the fact that that they use plastic as the base. I do my best to avoid plastic, so I do not plan to use this item anymore."
1.0,Too small and I ordered up a size.
1.0,Not impressed by the quality.
1.0,"Resulta muy incomoda, es demasiado grande!"
1.0,"Do not waste your money. The watch band is very cheap and thin. It's very narrow, not wide at all like the original apple band. And it is a pain to install and remove. Find another seller!!"
1.0,"Everything about the dress is cute except the entire top portion of it.  I am usually a medium and got the large because of how small it looked. When the dress came , was perfect except the entire top portion was horrible too big. Like they took a xxxxl too and sewed it into a small skirt. Can’t even express how disappointed I am"
1.0,"first of all the material is totally different from the image.  The second I ordered M size dress, but I got a dress with handwriting M on the tag.  It looks like  S size."
1.0,Not true to size. Too small.
1.0,This product fell apart. It is impossible to put the pieces back together after you take links out. Do not buy !!!!
1.0,"Way too small, and cheaply made. They keep coming loose also."
1.0,This is crap. I only got one out of 6. Do not buy!!!!!
1.0,Does not look like the picture.  Cheap fabric and sized small
1.0,This shirt really sucks! The fabric is horribly thin!! They just put fabric together. String hanging everywhere!! RETURN!!!!
1.0,"Very cheap, nose piece moves brakes move around, and gets caught in your hair."
1.0,"Ordered 3XL ... Chest fits like an XXXS, everywhere else was okay. Just awkward measurements all around. Cheap material"
1.0,"The manufacturer lied,  this dress is NOT cotton at all.  The tag inside the dress states 95% rayon and 5% spandex, and thdrwss feels like rayon. DON'T buy if you want a cotton dress. Because there is No cotton anywhere in this dress"
1.0,"Extremely poorly made, ripped when I put it on, breast area was made without room for breasts."
1.0,I received a small wallet instead of the item that was advertised
1.0,"I made sure to read the reviews and see the customer photos of this item before I purchased it, and it seemed like it would be a good choice because it was very similar to what it should look like. But the mask I received isn’t at all like the ones other people got, or the one that was pictured. Mine has a zipper on the nose which shouldn’t be there. It makes no sense, and now they won’t allow me to return it so I can get my money back and buy the right kind of mask. So you can imagine I’m super pissed off. It’s disappointing because the material itself is pretty good, but if the mask doesn’t look like the Tokyo Ghoul mask should look then there’s no point in having it. What baffles me is that why would anyone think to add a zipper where a zipper doesn’t belong? That’s literally more work for no reason 🤦🏻‍♀️"
1.0,"The cutout dug into my thigh and I have a really bad impression bruise. Also, I wish I could adjust where the straps land. It digs into my inner arm near my underarm."
1.0,My husband loved these but they broke after the second wear. Seller won't respond to message.
1.0,Packing not good . Looks like used dress. Too small I ordered large .
1.0,Ichy. Ichy. Ichy. Wore once for a dance performance and gave them to goodwill.
1.0,its cute but looks nothing like the picture and fits okayish (im a 38C) but there’s no top clasp :(
1.0,The material is a very  bad quality. Is not is not worthy. Do not waist your money on it
1.0,"This dress was way too small and was very cheaply made. Didn't look a thing like the photo. Too short, too tight, too thin."
1.0,Didn’t like the material!  Certainly not standard sweatshirt material!!!
1.0,This looks nothing like the image displayed online. The dress is very short and the sleeves are very ugly. The sleeves were a different shade of green than the dress.
1.0,Not true to size. Awful quality.
1.0,This item came super short and wide. It looked like a Winnie the Pooh shirt. The material is also scratchy and not at all soft or like a good golf polo. I will 100% be returning.
1.0,The poor design and the claw-like shape makes it hurtful to use for more than a few minutes.  Sending them back for a refund.
1.0,"We've had this product for two days and after tying it twice, the stitches came out. This tie is definitely a piece of junk."
1.0,"came with stitching undo all the way to the armpit & I ordered an XL for a baggy result, my 115 skinny daughter can even fit into it. Very dissapointed"
1.0,"These rings fit true to size and look cool in the description. Once they arrived everything went downhill. Both rings have major bubbling of the silver coating. Both rings have the coating chipped off in several places. Both rings will turn your finger green in record time. You can barely see the symbols on them and those are bubbling off too. I posted pictures. Those are not glares from talking the pics, it's bubbling of the coating. They look, feel and wear incredibly cheap. I got what I paid for even though I really feel like I overdid for this quality. Expected better from a BBC product. Will be contacting company for return and refunds."
1.0,Fell apart within one week. Thru them in trash!
1.0,This a replacement of the exact same bag my husband used for almost a decade.  The replacement didn’t last 6 months!
1.0,I expected this to be sturdier. The case is very flimsy and not protective at all
1.0,"quality tomorrow, when you wash it it loses its color, a bad buy"
1.0,"I was excited to get this; it was to arrive on or before election day and even though I wasn't voting in person I wanted to represent.<br /><br />Sadly, when I opened this, the necklace was broken. The main link connecting the collar to the chain had broken and it was disconnected.<br /><br />:(<br /><br />The earrings look fun; I haven't worn them yet, but now I'm extra concerned about quality.<br /><br />Extra bummed I didn't get to wear it this week."
1.0,"Poor quality tights, gave them away"
1.0,"no breathability, the zippers and pockets fall apart. don't waste your money"
1.0,"The picture looks better than the actual product. The bracelet sent, was a purplish color. It was all one color, there was none of the white highlights to accent the queen's  head. I would not order from this company again. The bracelet is poor quality"
1.0,Not even close to the size it said it was.
1.0,The shirt had a hole in it.
1.0,LED lights stopped working after first day of use
1.0,Extremely unhappy after first wash.. pls don't buy it..you will be disappointed
1.0,"Don't waste your time.  I ordered a small 27-31 inches.  The belt I received said small, made in China.  It measured 40 inches hanging and 54 inches stretched."
1.0,"Size chart is way off.. bought a 2xl, I'm normally a large.  Wouldn't button up my chest. If you're a large or bigger,  don't purchase.  This blouse is for tiny girls"
1.0,For everywhere EXCEPTaround the tummy!  Won't stay up-slides down.  It's a shame because I love how they look. Can't wear them. Wasted my money. Very disappointed. I have had the regular ones that tie and they are great.  Will have to go back to those.
1.0,These are very uncomfortable. The toe seam area is very bulky. I am a hand knitter and circular sock machine knitter of socks and I am very familiar with how machines construct socks. In this company's case they put too much fabric in the seam area. The elasticity of the socks is not comfortable and they do not stay up well. Would not buy again and have not worn more than once.
1.0,This is not a Kappa cane. This is two Christmas candy canes that they are marketing as kappa canes.
1.0,It is not made very well. I wish I could return it.
1.0,"Cheap, disgusting fabric. Looks like the cheap Halloween costume fabric."
1.0,You can get the same item from Disney store at 11.99.  I don't know how is the product because I didn't open.  Low rating is on Price.
1.0,One of the worst package I ever ordered. I want to return it but can’t rn because of the corona virus
1.0,Fell apart after one wearing and washing
1.0,Very thin floppy material. Buttons are not aligned well. Unflattering fit. Barely reflects displayed picture.
1.0,I bought these because Amazon no longer sells the brand I usually buy. I washed them when I received them and the very fist pair I put on ripped. Then the second pair did the same thing. These are garbage. I won’t ever buy this brand again!
1.0,"This shirt is horrible! It is made out of some weird fabric that is odd to say the least! It has a very boxy look, it's thin,and see through and looks nothing like the picture!"
1.0,Have dozens of ear rings and for some reason this pair made her ears itch
1.0,Poor breast support
1.0,"The shoe looks like a real Nike shoe, but once you touch it, it's all down hill. The material is man made; there are no markings on the tongue; the stamps inside don't match and one is placed very off center. There should be a SKU inside the shoe that matches the box. Not! The label that is inside doesn't say &#34;Nike,&#34; it says &#34;MADE IN VIETNAM&#34; in all caps. Our family has been through dozens of Nikes through the years and these are clearly fakes."
1.0,Not to good quality
1.0,Cut very small! No pleats at all. I ordered a size larger than normal and it was still to small. Looks nothing like the picture
1.0,Logo isn't centered.
1.0,Aweful fit. I even bought 3x for him because I saw it ran small. It’s more like a size small
1.0,Cheap....made in China
1.0,Way too big. Falling off my neck.
1.0,"fast shipping, but not good quality.  The lights on one shoe stopped working completely and the shoe came apart at the seem"
1.0,I bought these because they were cute. I wore them for a day and it turns out I am allergic to whatever metal this is. So I can't wear them.
1.0,The picture really looks like this is more 3 dimensional and cut metal.  It is just a flat/smooth front surface that is essentially a picture.
1.0,"Terrible! Bad fit, itchy material, bad all around!!!"
1.0,"More than large, I sent it back today."
1.0,"The brown cloth (strongest material present) peeled away at every belt loop day one. By day 3, the “leather” had broken and it was held together by the cheap cloth"
1.0,Another waste buy
1.0,"I thought the earrings were beautiful when they arrived, and decided to wear them that night.  I picked out an outfit that would match them.<br />I got ready to go, and put on the earrings last thing.<br />Imagine my surprise when the post broke in half the FIRST time I attempted to screw it in!!  I had no alternative but to find another pair of earrings for that evening, and throw out my new, beautiful, BROKEN ones.<br />I have purchased from you in the past and have never had a problem, but this situation may change my mind about ordering from you again.  I want to know that when I buy something new, it will function properly, to say nothing of my disappointment in not having a new piece of jewelry to wear.<br />Cheri Hoog"
1.0,"I received my underwear and they smelled musty and gross! I can't get over how disgusting these are…what person is going to wear new clothes that smell like a wet basement???? I mean, underwear????"
1.0,"I was really curious to see what I could get for so little of a price and honestly it’s the price you’re paying. It’s see through and thin and very short , could be used for a swim cover up"
1.0,Terribly sewn! Sent it back!
1.0,Cheap and smells bad!!
1.0,"My son purchased these with his Christmas money. They are made of some kind of cheap plastic/vinyl. They have a terrible chemical smell out of the box. They have a crease down the middle of both boots from being smashed down and not properly stored after being assembled at some factory in China.<br />Since he ran outside right away to show them off to us, they are not in ""new and unused"" condition so we cannot return them. He is stuck with these boots that have a hard crease down the middle of the boot shaft. I spent an hour trying to steam and iron the creases and now we have towels stuck in them in attempt to smooth it out well enough that he can actually wear them UNDER his jeans and not tucked in like the odd style in the photos from the seller.  Absolute waste of your money. Poor quality."
1.0,"Looks great.  Exactly what I wanted.  Problem is that the very first time I tried extending the retractable cord part, it broke.  I've had it all of 5 mins and I'm packing it up to return it."
1.0,pin broke on the second time i used it
1.0,Even if I was a brand new baby it still won't fit but am an adult... beanies way too small..to fit an adult
1.0,I’m so disappointed in this dress. I’ve been wanting one of these and was so excited to get it but it’s tiny and extremely thin and see through. I’m not sure what I thought I was going to get. It fits my arms but that’s it. Not for curvier women. I ordered an xl to be safe and was still small.
1.0,False ad.  No wool listed.
1.0,Not as sparkly and colorful as it looks at all
1.0,Came with seams loose and threads hanging loose. It looked like a poorly made shirt that was very low quality. I returned it and was refunded for the entire purchase.
1.0,"The maker needs to get sizes right.  This top is about 3 sizes too big, and the material used is too stretchy, causing it to hang and stretch."
1.0,these areas are impossible to class back together. Once you put them in your ear I’m not really sure if they’re even meant to be worn on your ear like they’re literally impossible. Do not purchase.
1.0,"I bought these to replace the “ same ones” I bought at that big red retailer with a bullseye. I love the ones I got there for the reason that they don’t fog my glasses and fit very comfortably. These that I bought from Amazon are not the same quality or fit that I had before. They fog up my glasses , don’t fit snug and are a totally different material."
1.0,"I ordered this set before (a set of all solid colors) and I really like them and my son said they are very comfortable. I just wanted to order another five and picked a set with a mix of solid color and the camouflage (whatever the official term is) print. It turned out the two camouflage ones (out of five with 3 others being solid color) are much smaller at the circumference by the thigh (about narrow by close to an inch). That is a total no fit. The kid complained too tight. By then I already took off all the packaging and washed them, so I can't return them. We just had to throw away the two camouflage ones and only keep the three with solid colors (that still fit well)."
1.0,Fake converse broke in less than 3 months... had to trow it the trash. Suck.
1.0,Support tight and zipper inn my broke within days
1.0,"Although they feel very comfortable and fit well, you can see through them and clearly see the underwear underneath. I’m returning them. They’d be good for wearing with skirts or under jeans to keep warm."
1.0,Can’t leave a decent review on a item that has never worked.
1.0,terrible fabric
1.0,"la tabla de tallas no corresponde a las tallas que se pide, segun su tabla mis medidas son XXL pero el vestido llego y es extremadamente grande"
1.0,If you have large breasts this may not be for you. The wrap pieces are straps that cross over your boobs in the most awkward way which leaves areas exposed.
1.0,They look like a sex toy that’s been adapted. I’m embarrassed to even use.
1.0,Terrible fit and the material is really rough. Pants feel and look cheap. Returning.
1.0,...Disappointed!! The print is way smaller than it shows on the add.. it small for a XL as well.. Im 5'9 and 165 pounds.. The only reason I keep it and not returned it was its the only MGS shirt I could find with the original logo.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:9225c0e14168b1378f76f8c3ce4810ce]] I didn't like it because it's too small. I bought it for my 3 year old daughter and I think it's too small for her.
1.0,"These came in a cheap and flimsy plastic bag that was torn, which defeats the purpose of the mask.  It looks like someone just pulled a handful of them out of a larger stock and stuffed them into a plastic bag.  I want my 3 year old nephew to wear them, they are cute, but god only knows who touched them and breathed whatever germs on them before they got to me, which kinda defeats the purpose of ordering them.  Doesn't seem like they are hygienic."
1.0,"It was pretty flimsy. The one side of the lace kept folding in itself, and the torso part didn’t seem long enough. I’m typically a medium and bought a large as other people suggested. Still just didn’t fit right."
1.0,Not happy with this item.
1.0,TSA master key could not open theses locks. TSA reps destroyed and disposed of my locks.
1.0,The neckline in this shirt doesn’t look anything like the picture and it’s definitely not for the plus size ladies. It pretty much looks like a normal tank top with a weird cut. I’ll wear it around the house or to sleep in but I’m not wearing it out anywhere bc I feel like it’s not at all figure flattering on my body type.
1.0,Product was tarnished and ugly rough.
1.0,"Like several other reviewers, my shirt is not at all as pictured. The sleeves and colors are... weird."
1.0,Not happy with the quality so I returned it.  Ran small.
1.0,"This is not chiffon, which was the description. It is satin."
1.0,It is really small. I knew it wasn’t real but I didn’t think it would change colors so soon.
1.0,bracelet not a necklace
1.0,Sizings are way off. The large size was too loose for me and will even show my boobs out. Its just way off. All the other i bought in amazon that are size large are ok though and fits me.
1.0,This thing sucks!! I got it on the first day and the strings came off so easily I just wasted $3
1.0,The stud wouldn't stay pinned in the base.  I don't know if it's the bioflex material or the way this is made.  The 8mm also seemed very short.
1.0,"First, I couldn't get the original band off. Once it was off, I tried to put this one but it looks junky to me. I think I'll spend more and get a better quality one."
1.0,Not worth it!! Broke the first time I wore them! Made from cheap material!
1.0,Way to small. Even for a toddler.. Joke..
1.0,It does not fit my ear no matter where I place it. N It's the size of a toe ring.
1.0,I have never seen more cheap material than this
1.0,Not as described!  The seller argued with me over it instead of amending the problem!
1.0,Horrible!!!!!  DO NOT order this dress!!!!  Looks so beautiful in picture--but it was NOTHING like it after I finally received it!  I can't sew at all. BUT I could have done a better job that what was there!!!  Looked as though a small kid made it and it was so small that it wouldn't even fit a 10-year-old !  I was so disappointed and angry!!!  This piece of crap had to have been so deliberately cheaply made!  What a huge rip off. I didn't even waste my money sending it back!  I threw it into the trash!!!  This was supposed to be my beach wedding dress!  Thanks for nothing!  You should be ashamed!!
1.0,"Did not get the item pictured, very disappointed"
1.0,"I'm giving this dress one star only because it arrived ripped. The material is thin. It's a nice dress, knee length, and very attractive. I wish I could have worn it."
1.0,"I ordered this skirt because it was described as cotton, linen material. Even though the plastic cover it came in describes as cotton, linen the tag on the skirt says 100% polyester.<br />Not sure if it is a mistake or an intentional misrepresentation."
1.0,Not good cheap lock system opens up very easy I lost my iPhone watch because of this 😡don’t buy this product
1.0,"Worst bag ever, do not buy this!!!"
1.0,Came frayed and wrong color. Looked more blue than purple
1.0,I returned item bcuz too large Item was not received I was charged
1.0,Size is way way small XXL=SMALL SIZE
1.0,Not a class 3 as needed
1.0,Not worth the money spent.  Made my granddaughter happy.
1.0,The concept is great but all three pairs broke within a month.
1.0,They are for baby and not for an adult<br />You should say what size there are
1.0,They are not meant for any type of human feet! I’m a 7 and that’s pushing it for my shoe size. These are almost like a 5! The point on the toes are so small that even people with narrow feet can’t put them on. Waste of money!
1.0,"The material does not look like the quality in the picture, its of a cheap poor material, i would normally purchase a 2x in clothes so i buy a 3x to allow me space and it does not fit.<br />the plastic package it comes in is of better quality, when i opened the package i was so disappointed, this was a waste of money would not recommend"
1.0,terrible
1.0,"Super thin, super lint attraction, super terrible. Ripped almost immediately"
1.0,I got a large. I wear a medium and it didn't fit st all.
1.0,Not very cute
1.0,Super small heart. Very deceiving picture in item description. I would not call it a pendant if it is a size of a charm.
1.0,It's a really cool shirt but the image is waaay smaller than the advertised picture and is crooked.
1.0,Some of the buttons popped off before i ever wore it and it’s a lot more pink than i had expected.
1.0,Item arrived broken.
1.0,It does not look good like the photo.  it seems and looks very cheaply made.
1.0,"I had a physician friend of mine that highly recommended these compression socks. While they were quite comfortable, one of the socks ripped the first time I pulled the socks on. Pretty disappointed in the quality."
1.0,i know it was only 99 cents but i expected it to last more than 1 hour  my daughter loved it cause she loves cats but cheaply made
1.0,Left pocket is ripped
1.0,This hat split between the brim and the skull part. So the foldable part is highly incorrect. It was only taken on one trip. It's really cute if you're not going to take it anywhere.
1.0,It’s cheaply made
1.0,"Liked the ring, but didn't last a week of normal wearing before it caught in something and broke in half.  Do not recommend if you plan to wear for more than an occasional event."
1.0,Sent kids size - just gave them away ….
1.0,Unfortunately this fell apart very quickly. I got it for my boyfriend as a present and after a week it was starting to fall into pieces. Would not recommend this wallet for anyone.
1.0,These look like glorified leggings. They aren't flattering.  They don't look professional and I wouldn't recommend them for an office environment if you want to be taken seriously.
1.0,Not worth a penny!!! Doesn’t clean well and not comfortable at all wearing it.
1.0,This item is so misleading in its advertising. In no way is this outfit fit for a plus size woman. It barely fit my size 10 daughter. Plus the product is so poorly made and basically see through. Buyer beware do not waste your money.
1.0,"Very disapointed, I sent out a question before ordering these, asking if they were tiddker size 9-11, and received a yes response that they were defiantly small. I opened them up, and they were defiantly large! My 2, almost 3 year old grandson is obsessed with ACDC, and has enough shirts, he would have loved these. I will change my review if the problem gets resolved!"
1.0,Returned. Very cheap quality. Poor fit. You can find a better blazer at H&M or Zara for less or about the same price.
1.0,poorly made and sized incorrectly!
1.0,Half of them came not sown together on the waste band.
1.0,Didn't like they are so cheap and turn to brass color!
1.0,I ordered a 2X that's 2 sizes larger than what I normally wear.  It was still too small.
1.0,These are super cute but yes they are very small! They only fit just past my nail!
1.0,"There was stain on the fabric,like it was worn by someone,the dress was dirty."
1.0,"I don't know in what world an XL would fit like an XXS. If you don't have any boobs, then go for it. If you don't have any curve to your body, go for it. I ordered up two sizes because it said it runs small.<br /><br />Find a different dress. This won't fit you."
1.0,"Feels cheaply made, especially for $75."
1.0,The hat is cheep with no support. Loco is i sticker. I was going to return it and they want to charge me to send it back. When you spend this much for a Challenger Scat Pack why would you wear this piece of crap. Going in the trash.
1.0,reviews do not match item being sold. reviews are for shorts set.
1.0,"Not at all what I expected, returning it"
1.0,What a waste! Size is definitely incorrect & quality doesn’t exist.
1.0,Not what I expected. Cheaply made and the measurements are off. It's big in areas it should be small and small in areas it should be big
1.0,This isn't  a face covering. Its a kid size whatever it is. Don't  order this merchandise. Very disappointing. -5stars!! As a G.I.Joe fan SMH. It wasn't $3 it came up to $11. DON'T BUY IT!!
1.0,This does not look like this in person.  The cut is completely shorter and does not fit true to size. The material is very cheap. Don't waste your money.
1.0,I was surprised to find 3 silver  chains for such a low price!  And it turns out I didn’t. They darkened very quickly and left a dark ring on my neck. Very disappointed.
1.0,"very cute, but very thin"
1.0,"Took weeks for these to arrive and was very disappointed after the wait. Mine weren't thin like some people have commented, but had a horrible chemical smell to them. Put them through the wash three times hoping it would go away, but the odor was still so strong I couldn't wear them - they actually made me feel sick to my stomach.  Asked my husband to smell them thinking it might just be me but he took one sniff and said, &#34;Throw those in the garbage now!&#34; Wasn't worth the shipping and envelope to return, so this purchase was like throwing money in the trash."
1.0,The fit is bad. The fabric is not soft and comes really small.
1.0,Not flowy at all like the photo. I'm 5'2 and 150lbs. Ordered medium and it looked terrible. Returned.
1.0,"Not what I ordered. The original posting had:<br />1 closed circle<br />1 open circle<br />1 open oval with dark bead<br />And what looked like a basket criss cross closed circle. This actually turned out to be 3-d so it looks like a large hat. Fail.<br /><br />And they sent 2 closed circles, no open circle. Fail.<br /><br />No time to return them - arrived Thursday, needed for a weekend event.<br /><br />Dollar store quality, but for a weekend away/beach - won't be worried about theft or loss. They look enough like the expensive trendy version, that will be untrendy in a hot minute, to wear a handful of times."
1.0,Actually the fit was ok. But the condition of the hat when i got it was Horrible. It looked like someone had it folded up in their pocket. CRUSHED!!!
1.0,It looks cheap. And abit larger than the picture. The gold color is yellowish. I didn’t like it
1.0,"This sweater said RED it’s totally bright ORANGE, and I ordered a L and it’s clearly a very small large. More like a sm-med!"
1.0,They were not worth $32. Stitching was amateur. Quality of the Jean was cheap. They were too small. I wear a size 14 and got the XXL according to chart. The seller did respond quickly to my request to return...but I also had to pay for shipping.
1.0,Was excited to take out the sweater to wear since cold weather is here and yes looks nice.  On the first wash (delicate cycle) it came apart and the worst part is that  I ordered 4 other colors and I am afraid of wearing them.  Waste of money nor do I recommend.
1.0,Product works when it doesn't break. the last few belts i have bought broke before i could even use them. trying to put the button through the hole is hard enough and then when it goes through the holes splits and its no good. ive even had belts tear all the way through. i have at least 15 belts that are no good.
1.0,Sizing off. Did not really like this product.
1.0,Had to return because suede was all wrinkled. Didn't even bother trying them on.
1.0,Terrible quality. The product can not be dried or it will no longer fit
1.0,"Band is too big, too stretchy."
1.0,So damn short. I mean the slit shows my bits... Ordered a size up. Very disappointed
1.0,I usually wear a medium and I couldn't even get this dress over my head to see if it fit. I waited to long to return it so I took it to the cleaners to see if I could have a zipper added and I was told the material was to cheap to add a zipper.
1.0,NOT true to size!!!
1.0,I ordered a large and they were still too small :/
1.0,"I ordered the size xl and I am m and all the arms are tight, the fabric does not give way and the part of the cenos, they are very small and below is square, very misshapen."
1.0,"I ordered my regular size and they were very see through, very soft, but very see through."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:40c183262ef4f5b69c8744434620b19e]] If only they can fix the sole problem it would be great. Unfortunately the soles come out as you walk
1.0,"Even less than 1 star. This product is very misleading. The quality is horrible and it is definitely not as advaertised. It doesn't flow, nor does it reach the ankle. Waste of time. It's like you cut a piece of cloth and wrapped around your waste, even a basic wrap is better than this. Waste of time"
1.0,My daughter wore them once and crotch ripped out had to sew them up. Otherwise ok just a pain to deal with.
1.0,The bottom detached while opening the package. Poorly made. Don’t buy it.
1.0,"Cheaply made copper bracelets. Pin connecting links bent with little pressure & no extra included. Unless you have a precision drill bit/drill and/or have jewelers in your family, do not waste your money and time. Spent 1-1/2 hrs trying to release pin. Watched video online and procedure did not work. No offer to reimburse my time! Now have to spend more time and money to return. I rarely write negative reviews, but need to warn anyone who is thinking of buying from this company."
1.0,Weird shade of green!!!
1.0,"It was beautiful when I first received it and later on, it started to change color. See attached picture"
1.0,"Unfortunately this watch did not work, I LOVE the simplicity and style of the watch but the clasp will not stay closed, therefore it just keeps falling off my wrist. Truly a waste of money, and of course this would happen RIGHT after the return window closed."
1.0,Shirt is really small
1.0,Stuff is not good ..dull color
1.0,"Ordered two pairs, one L and one XL. The large were meant for me and the other pair was for my husband. L fits more like a medium, and XL is even larger than expected, so I ordered another XL for myself and shrugged at the loss for the L. They were comfortable when we tried them on, but we always wash clothes once before officially wearing them. The seams at the crotch and hips of both pairs fell apart after one wash.<br /><br />NOT RECOMMENDED FOR REGULAR USE<br /><br />Only good for maybe a photo shoot or costume piece, something meant to be worn once or very infrequently."
1.0,Poor quality and not what was expected. They were not the size that what i ordered. I returned them and got a refund.
1.0,This item is garbage. It says it’s a blouse on Amazon. It is actually a very very thin poorly made I can hardly even caught a sweatshirt. This is bad
1.0,They are a little short for work boots. I can get them laced and tied but not as long as the ones I get locally. Nice laces otherwise.
1.0,"I bought two despite the other comments. I bought a gold and a silver one. I opened the silver one, tried it on and it broke while I was walking to look at it in my full length mirror. It fit fine before it broke. It wasn't too tight and draped well. Just know that you get what you pay for."
1.0,Dress is not what is pictured. Is a child size not for adult. Took over three months to receive and now I cannot return because of time that has passed.
1.0,Don’t waste your money on this junk
1.0,The hat fell apart first day a wire came loose and cut my ear not a good hat at all one day use onlyb
1.0,What the devil is that little flashing devil doing on my daughters Christmas gift??? I am returning this immediately.
1.0,New??? This has brown nasty spots all over it straight out of the package 😔
1.0,"Very cheaply made, poor stitching & material. I returned it immediately. It does NOT look like it does in the picture, either; it's red & white, not burgundy."
1.0,"Skirts too big ,shirt sleeves too small  looks nothing like the picture"
1.0,"disappointed. This is the LARGEST face mask I have ever purchased. It is almost too big for me! My daughter is very sad. Quality is good, just way too big."
1.0,Was much smaller than shown on chart and the material was extremely thin.was not well made at all.
1.0,The underwire and fabric goes up to far under your armpit.  So you're constantly irritated in that area.  Very uncomfortable and straps are way to wide.
1.0,These glasses only darkened to a light gray and that took 2 minutes.  They did not turn clear after 10 minutes of waiting.  The label on the left lens left a rectangular discoloration on the glass.  I returned this item the next day.  You have to pay the return postage ($2.50).
1.0,"Awful shoe.  Coloring terrible and it doesn't fit.  Cheap, terrible shoe."
1.0,The bow came off and there was a little tear in it and first day using it the strap broke
1.0,This looks a lot nicer in the picture than it looks on. Material is cheap and doesn't lay nicely.<br />Looks like a cheap Halloween costume. I would return but I missed the return window. Damn.
1.0,It is a cute and unique piece but it was broken upon arrival. Email to see if I could get a replacement but they never sent one
1.0,I expected more for $9... But it just looks and feels like cheap junk! It doesn't look like the picture is advertising.
1.0,I used this for three days when one of the sides of the strap broke completely off.
1.0,Gave to nephews
1.0,They don’t fit the frames. Lenses seem clear. But just don’t fit the Oakley crossranges.
1.0,So disappointed looked so cute in pic but when received them they were too way too big in hip stomach areas and way way too short
1.0,"Nice material but the &#34;XS&#34; I ordered was really more like the size of a large. No way will I fit this. I'm disappointed. I'm 5' tall and ended up giving it to my son's girlfriend, who is 6'1&#34; tall."
1.0,"I wanted to love this purse as much as other reviewers have, but after ordering it on March 22, 2018 with an estimated arrival date of April 12-May 3, 2018 and still not having it as of May 10th 2018- I honestly can’t say this is a good purchase.  I have heard nothing from the company.  This is inexcusable.  If you want a great purse- don’t trust this company to ever get it to you.  You would be better served taking your money and flushing it down the toilet."
1.0,"Flimsy material. It was super cheap,  so I took a chance for a 90s costume (would never be able to use this is my regular clothing rotation).  Didn't end up wearing it at all, but perhaps my teenage daughter can use it for a costume party eventually,  so I didn't throw it away yet."
1.0,The bracelet was broke
1.0,Pretty much the title. I will be returning this item. Waste of time and effort. Too bad I won't have a mask for the masquerade Christmas Party for work.
1.0,They are not soft or comfortable.
1.0,"I put a coating of this on my goggles and got in the pool. After only 1 lap, the goggles had fogged up. I reapplied 2 more coatings and tried again. This time, they fogged up after only 1/2 a lap. Totally useless. Waste of money."
1.0,Fabric is not good. Very cheap looking and feeling.
1.0,band was too small and I have really small wrists
1.0,The gloves are super cheaply made! Thinner than 1 ply toilet paper you can barley get the gloves on without them ripping!
1.0,Poorly Made broke after one wear
1.0,Flimsy at best
1.0,"I usually wear a size large. So I ordered a size X large to make sure that it would fit. That was too small! I could not put it on! love the pants but how about selling true American sizes,"
1.0,"Disappointment-very cheaply made, can't even describe what the material is. Waited 2 months for junk."
1.0,Lot shorter than the picture
1.0,"When I requested to return item, Hemlock emailed me it was poorly written and didn't even make sense or have correct grammar. They only offer partial refund because of shipping, I will never order from Hemlock again."
1.0,Says leggings but the product clearly States on the packaging pantyhose…. not freaking happy
1.0,Runs small and the material silky and cheap!
1.0,One pair of glasses were completely scratched up on one lense straight out of the package
1.0,"Way too small. I normally wear a M/L and ordered the Large. My 12 year old fits in them, they barely came up over my knees. New shorts for her but definitely not women’s shorts. They fit like an XS/S women’s if not children’s XL"
1.0,Mask material was too thin in all the wrong places.  The breathing portals were open.  I have to wear this mask with a surgical mask underneath.  Do not waste your money on this mask.
1.0,"Unfortunately my waste is significantly smaller than my hips, which the dimensions of this dress did not quite fit. The small left a lot of room in the torso area which made me look frumpy."
1.0,The clip to connect the strap broke as soon as I opened it.....
1.0,The jacket was great it felt well for a costume a little better made than I thought it would be but we ordered the jacket and shirt combination and paid for both but did not receive the shirt.
1.0,"I was looking for a good pump cover for the gym and this was calling my name!<br /><br />As a woman who purchases men’s Ms regularly, I went with that size originally. Received it and I had a feeling the material would shrink so I returned and repurchased in a large.<br /><br />UPDATE: washed the large and it shrunk two if not three sizes. Can’t even wear it now. Don’t waste your money."
1.0,"When the first order of this item left my watch falling off several times, I thought I received a defective band. Since I really like the look and feel of the band, I exchanged it.  The second one does the same thing. I have been diligent at making the watch to band pins install correctly. The slightest bump on the band edge takes the pins out. So far, that has been around 6 times in the last two days alone.<br /><br />I went back to the Garmin band (Vivoactive 4S), and it never falls off.<br /><br />This band is a guarantee to lose your Garmin or at least have it fall off and get scratched."
1.0,Way too large on the top and tight elastic waist. The fit was wrong in all the wrong places
1.0,Poor quality. Like a spandex material. Does not look good.  Runs big. Was hanging off my body. I am 5’6 and 120 pounds. The small was way too big on me. Retuned
1.0,"Pros : cute comfy stylish<br />Cons : No sun protection, makes clicking noise<br /><br />I went to Burlington and bought some Jessica Simpson sunglasses and they do a better job .<br /><br />I would like to try a different pair for free just to see if all there sunnies are the same or different"
1.0,"Not genuine leather at all, it's pure plastic. I'll return it."
1.0,"Looked at they size chart, ordered using bust size. Do not know if the bust would have fit because the sleeves are way to small."
1.0,I'm so disappointed about my order from fun daisy - the item has dark spots all over the chain and the gold part on the bottom of the pendant. And the item looks old.
1.0,"This was awful, bought it fir my son and it broke in 2 days. Very upset because he loved it."
1.0,I  have had it for not even a week and it broke.
1.0,The sizing was soo small
1.0,The inner filter is small and uncomfortable.  Wore once and never again.  The inner part makes the outer part useless as it can’t conform to face anyway
1.0,"So much potential, so disappointing. As the measurements are in the title, I am not sure why others are upset by the size of these. The smallness was exactly what I wanted, so that is not what upset me. These look very nice at a glance and I was initially pleased. Then I tried to put them on. The first one I picked up broke the moment I opened it. It looked tarnished at the hinge and the end had just crumbled away making it impossible to fix. The second opened okay (much less tarnish), but still felt very flimsy and I worried that additional handling might bend it out of place or break it if not extremely careful. These would definitely not stand up to any pressure or repeated use at all. The smaller pair were equally delicate, but without tarnish so I was able to use them with less issue. I still wouldn't recommend them to anyone who changes earrings often. I really liked the idea of these and I am sad they did not work out. It is hard to appreciate the beauty of something I cannot wear. :("
1.0,This Itty bitty purse SUCKS!!!!!!!!GROSS MISREPRESENTATION
1.0,The size is not right. It should not say plus size . Their idea of a 2x is about the size of a medium. I didn't sent it back because my daughter who is a medium wanted it.
1.0,DO NOT BUY IT STOPS WORKING AFTER A MONTH AND THE BATTERY DIES IN LESS THEN A DAY DO NOT BUY IT WHAT'S WASTE OF MONEY
1.0,I expected a lesser fitted tee shirt that I could wear to Yoga.  These would work fine if they were made of a natural fabric that would allow some drape.  I detest spandex....I am elderly and very active
1.0,"This dress is awful. It has mixed reviews but It looked SO cute and I thought it’d be perfect for engagement photos, so I gave it a shot anyway. Lemme tell you, I made a mistake. The pictures are photoshopped AF. If that model is really that slim and flat chested (like me) there’s no way it would have fit her that well. I ordered a small and I was swimming in it. I’ve never looked so frumpy before. The waist was huge, the titty area was huge, and the skirt did NOT look the same irl. The whole thing was bad. Do not waste your time."
1.0,"Had to take it to a jeweler to pry off the back because i thought the battery was dead when it arrived. They said there was a fiber wedged in the gears and it couldnt be fixed without breaking the mechanism. 2 stars because while it still is pretty, it is useless as a timepiece which is why I bought it."
1.0,The dots are actually huge and don’t look at all like the dress in the picture.
1.0,Quality of this dress is poor. Looks like it’s been already worn.  One wash and it will be all bally
1.0,very poorly made.
1.0,I got these Sunday and they didn’t last 2 days. Didn’t stay connected at all unscrewed so easily!
1.0,"they are very good quality boots, and the style is really nice.<br /><br />unfortunately, they are not truly wide calf. they may be a little wider than normal, but really that's nothing. I'm a plus size, I have wider than average calves and these boots barely zip up at all on me.<br /><br />the boot itself is also cut really small in the foot. I'm normally a size 10, but I got an 11 so that I can wear a gel insole in it. I still had a hard time getting my foot in, the boot is cut so narrow. I've never had that happen in a size 11 boot.<br /><br />if you are an average-to-small enough size to fit these, congratulations. I'm pretty sure they will be lovely boots to have. but if you're a plus size, don't let the description fool you."
1.0,This dress isn’t what I expected. I wouldn’t purchase again
1.0,The line on the progressive was far out of where it should be.  Trying to return.
1.0,Fits ok but the material is poor
1.0,For kids. China crap.
1.0,"Day one i went outside in these socks and the temperature outside was about 40 degrees. I stood on the concrete for 10 seconds and my feet got very cold. The claim for the socks was you can stand on A BLOCK OF ICE for one hour and not get cold. What the heck! I was on concrete 10 seconds. EPIC FAIL !!  Now I'm trying to send them back and fighting for them to cover the 10.00 postage . I should not have to pay to send their faulty merchandise back.  Week 3 of trying to get them to comply (Its the principle if the matter, you should stand behind your product and your client the customer deserves the truth) ."
1.0,Received it on Thursday and it was broke on Friday
1.0,Very badly put together.  Feels cheap look cheap.  Nothing like the pic.  Extremely disappointed
1.0,They loose color
1.0,Product was way too small around the neck to wear comfortably.
1.0,V cheap and poorly made handbag. Can’t use or gift!
1.0,Stoped working after a few days
1.0,It looks nothing like the picture. It was so heavy and unflattering. Too much fabric.
1.0,bad !!!! I should give no star . well you know they dont have no rating .
1.0,Way too small...and not the design she ordered. Not worth the hassle to return it
1.0,I’m so disappointed in this product.<br />For the amount charged it is very poor quality and looks cheap and nasty. I will be returning it as soon as possible
1.0,"Poor quality. Shape, ultra thin material, an absolute joke. Do not waste your money. Awaiting return approval."
1.0,After 1 week... these look awful.  They stain easy and scuff easy.  Worst wearing Shoe ever and stride right has never failed me before.
1.0,"Other than the color, these don't look like the photo.  They are much longer.  They look like those really long shorts the NBA players used to wear.  Very disappointed."
1.0,Stone  fell out!!!
1.0,Logo started coming off first wash and just poor quality shirt in general.
1.0,Not even close to fitting. Very disappointing. I will not buy from this company again.
1.0,Ripped in one wear
1.0,Sleeves to small
1.0,This dress is way too long and quality is cheap it don’t match what I purchase I want a refund
1.0,Lo regalé y fue un error se le puso negra a la persona
1.0,The Seller provided a return shipping label so I give them 5 stars...but the product does NOT fit like the beautiful picture. The shoulders are extremely small. It didn't even fit my girlfriend (3 sizes smaller). Definitely not like the sizing in the US (and I didn't know that by the description).
1.0,Size small looks like it was made for a baby doll! She couldn’t even get it over her head. It would have been great if it fit.
1.0,super small and thin
1.0,Boxy look once on
1.0,Too small and cheap shiny fabric.
1.0,"I wanted to get this look for a quick work and church so I ordered an XL and I couldn't get it over my thighs! my niece fits it through. She is a size small. Returning this shortly, good luck"
1.0,This was so poorly made that there was no hole to wrap the strap into.
1.0,They were cute and what I was looking for except the size is way too small....I normally wear 10/12 depending on the brand and I ordered a large....not even close to fitting...
1.0,Fell apart within a week of wearing it
1.0,Doesn't stay on your ear.  Product to &#34;Heavy&#34;.
1.0,This is junk.
1.0,It’s cut small
1.0,ordered a size large but it was tight on my size 0 teenagers!
1.0,Not thrilled with this.. Already had a Pandora butterfly one.. Thought this was identical match..it wasn't..alot smaller n nowhere near as durable as Pandora..I unfortunately ended up buying a Pandora one.. Should've returned this one.. disappointed...
1.0,Clasp broke the first use. Junk. Avoid.
1.0,"These socks are nice looking, but the quality is not good.  One pair had extremely tight ankles, the other had mismatched heights (1 ankle the other calf) and the third pair had a hole in the foot.  I haven’t tried the fourth pair yet and hope that I will be surprised with a good pair!"
1.0,I didn’t like the material. It was too thick and not stretch like women’s t shirts usually are. I also didn’t like that the cut is not shaped for a woman.  It’s looks very unflattering and boxy
1.0,It’s small for 3 month old .
1.0,"cheap material, didnt fit"
1.0,This bra is getting a 1 star because of the zipper that digs into me constantly. Plastic zipper on skin is NOT okay. I have given this about 5 tries Hoping it gets better but NO it does not. Make a bra that doesn't have plastic digging into you please
1.0,The faux “fur” was so incredibly itchy and made my skin on my wrist break out. I couldn’t even keep it on for 10 minutes. Save your money and do NOT go with this watch band.
1.0,"This was a huge disappointment and I can not understand Amazon selling this.  I was  horrified.  I don't think it would last the first wearing.  The packaging was also a shock, so awful.  It wasn't cheap to buy either.  I will not give it any rating."
1.0,It looked horrible and cheap. I thought the style was cute but when I tried it on- I looked like a librarian. It’s a no- go for me
1.0,These are not sterling silver earrings. They are cheap earnings which made my ears irritated and itchy. I don’t recommend these unless you can wear whatever in your ears.
1.0,Broke within 5 mins of wearing it
1.0,The entire red part of the shoe (the soles) comes detached from the rest of the shoe. Got them this afternoon and they're already broken and my son literally only walked to the end of the drive way. He didnt even have them on 1 total minute. Dont waste your time or your money. Thankfully they were not pricey but even still- junk!
1.0,"So cheap, not durable at all, but I guess you get what you pay for. Pin bent after a few days use"
1.0,"I really like the fabric on these neck gaiters, but they DO NOT have ear loops. They have a slit in the seam on each side for small ears to fit through. While it does keep the mask up, they’re uncomfortable on the ears, and since the slits are below the top of the gaiter (instead of separate loops), it rides very high on the face. You may need to frequently  pull the top down out of your eyes.<br /><br />This is a great idea very poorly executed. Definitely money wasted. I guess I’ll turn them upside down and wear like a normal neck gaiter."
1.0,Looks nothing like the photo. Top is faded material with little detail. Fabric is thin mesh.
1.0,"I am not support this product, inside rain protection layer not durability,it’s tear very fast . I bought in March it’s tear in may last . Water starts goes inside all my dress wet even wear rain dress"
1.0,This product didn't fit well at all on my back up valve...
1.0,This dress was pretty when it arrived although a bit larger than I had hoped. I wore it once and the seams in the dress just disintegrated one by one over the course of the evening leaving gaping holes that had to be camouflaged with a jacket.
1.0,"I love this brand and actually own several bras, but this style did not hold up. The straps are really pretty but it is best for occasional wear and not day to day."
1.0,"This shirt isn't like the picture at all.  Instead of the unfinished waffle knit, the pockets, shoulders, cuffs and the buttons down the front have a satin material.  The color is more of a yellow tone. And the sleeves are not an over sized dolman cut.  Just a regular button up shirt with a very small scale waffle-ish weave."
1.0,The size was way too small I even ordered a size 1 up :(
1.0,It is sooooo thin. The fabric is see through. It looks nothing like the picture. There is no fring and it is really small. All I received was a rectangle very sheer peace of fabric. I have no clue what to do with it 😔
1.0,The shirt is defective. It has two left arms.
1.0,I dislike the fabric to my outfit and would not by it again at all.
1.0,Shoes were so big. Could fit my 2 year old niece not my 10 month baby. But what 2 year old would wear soft soles???
1.0,The hook was not included!!
1.0,This looks nothing like the item looks online. When I got I was highly disappointed. Very cheap material!!! Very disappointed.
1.0,Was very thin material
1.0,"Don't buy these. The hats in the picture are not the same as the ones you receive (the ball on the end is a third of the size & the hat itself is way smaller). Also, there is a glob of dried glue on the end of the hats that appears to be holding the ball in place. I ended up returning them and buying $3 hats at Walmart that were of better quality. I never write negative reviews but this is false advertising. DON'T BUY!"
1.0,The jacket. Is nice the issue is I am on my second time wearing and I see has all those little fuzzy balls on it!! I hate that so it’s cheap !!
1.0,womans size large not mens. Advertized as mens.  False advertising.
1.0,Returned because they came defective. One lense was silver and one was gold
1.0,Do NOT order they have gone down hill on their standards.  Don't waste your money
1.0,Great cut but itchy fabric
1.0,These  are way to large
1.0,I opened these and they stayed flat!!! Don’t waste your money.  Dollar tree has light up plastic noses for $1.00!!
1.0,Cheap quality of material and no tags on item
1.0,Looks like a large nihhtgown. Very unflattering.
1.0,Pretty to look at. Took over a month to get.  Came from China  junk . I wear a 1x I ordered 3x and they were tight.  At 15.$ they are very poor quality..
1.0,Daughter did not like how thin the material is wish to return order.
1.0,I ordered a small size and it seems like a large.
1.0,Love the way the watch looks but thats it.  Digital light not bright at all.  The clasp doesnt hold closed.  The digital clock gains 30 minutes a week and the analog loses 10 minutes a week.  Very disappointed!!!
1.0,Does not work. After removing from the charger the scarf doesn’t work however it comes on while changing 🤷🏾‍♀️ I purchased one for a gift as well and was embarrassed.  Trash.
1.0,I love the style of these readers but the lenses were 2 different lenses. So I can't wear these. They are useless to me.
1.0,Not one but both pockets on the shorts ripped after my first wear and wash. Not worth the money by any means.
1.0,"Only came with top, no bottoms"
1.0,The length of the bar is way too short. The piece screws inside of the gauge part itself making it even smaller & too tight to wear. Other than that they are cute but def wouldn’t recommend if your ears swell sometimes
1.0,The dress is beautiful but the sizes are off and the fabric is much stretchier than I expected it to be.
1.0,it got off
1.0,Wayyy too small.. not recommend it!
1.0,"It took 3 months to arrive. The pink color was ugly. I took a picture of my friend in it, she is 5’8” and 160lb. We could’ve both fit in it."
1.0,"it is too fragile, it broke while setting it up."
1.0,Loved these glasses..They only lasted for two weeks..Both of the arms on my glasses broke off..Cheaply made.Very disappointed with the quality of the product... I would advise buyer to beware.. Not a good buy. I will never order from this company again
1.0,Literally could’ve made it at home for less money. Lettering is cheap and will crack and peel after washed.
1.0,Won't fit unless your a stick...
1.0,Didn't keep the correct time but was refunded quickly!
1.0,I am about to send this back. The quality is nonexistent. It looks like a piece of plastic wrapped in black sewing thread.
1.0,"TERRIBLEEE!!! it is nothing like the photo, does not even reach the waste..... it is not loose like it says.... it is a fraud"
1.0,The feathers were falling off. It wasn’t worth the price.
1.0,"I’m not pleased with this purchase. The band itself looks as advertised and seems well made. However the tool shown to easily remove links from it, was NOT included! I’m livid! I’ve been trying everything I can to remove the extra pins, but nothing is working. This has been a total headache!! Save yourself the trouble and order something else!"
1.0,This was given as a gift and it turned the recipients wrist green. Cheap. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,I used the companies size chart and it was too small.<br />Additionally the buttons were all loose and had threads hanging from them. The color was definitely more just orange than orange/red
1.0,I have a small frame and a big chest (36D). The small wouldn't even go over my chest and wouldn't have fit my waist anyway (33). I returned it and got the large...went on but totally squished my boobs flat. So uncomfortable. Returning.
1.0,"they were supposed to be the IT short for butt lift, did not do it for me at all!"
1.0,"It’s long sleeve , not short sleeve like photo"
1.0,Cheap and runs small
1.0,"The bows are held onto the gloves with hot glue, and fell off within 5 minutes of my daughter wearing them.  I had to sew the bows back on very quickly before an event.  We were not happy.  Very cute gloves, though, if you don't mind sewing.  ;)"
1.0,This product was a lot smaller than other retailers size 14/16.
1.0,One lens keeps popping out!
1.0,No beltloops
1.0,My son loved the item when he received it however after washing it several times the material makes weird little baby piling balls on the backside of the hoodie. The material is not a normal hoodie material he cannot wear anymore because the way it looks waste of money Honestly!
1.0,For 8 and 10 yo - Too small! Stretches over head but is too tight around neck! Don’t buy!
1.0,The material is sad like a cardboard box<br />Dress fits perfect<br />Was ordered for a formal dinner so disappointed<br />One move even after having dry cleaned and your a wrinkled mess
1.0,Looks like cheep plastic.
1.0,"Clothes were much, much smaller than labeled"
1.0,The top way is smaller than the bottom which makes no sense
1.0,Broke on day two!
1.0,Sizing is ridiculous!
1.0,"Bad product, I can't return because my daughter think Santas send it ."
1.0,"They’re for adults, I got them and they are too big for 6 yrs and 8yrs."
1.0,Dress is entirely too long. The cost to send it to a seamstress outweighs the cost of the dress.
1.0,Mis -labeled sizes
1.0,They were of poor quality!  If they are washed they will fall apart.  I bought gloves before and they were great!  I guess I ordered them from another company.
1.0,I don't know if this was defected but my 4 year old could not make the braid pop up and she is very strong. Her mother threw the package away and can not find out how to send it back. Avery disappointed little girl
1.0,"I bought them for my brother, who has red-green color-blindness, and he said there is no difference whatsoever."
1.0,Too huge for my ears
1.0,"Muy mal producto, mala calidad y no encaja"
1.0,"It looks pretty but it's very thin and cheaply made. I went to put it on and the clasp broke so I never got to wear it! Cheap price, cheap quality."
1.0,Difficult to fit over sneakers and I bought the largest size. They ripped after a week.
1.0,"I read the reviews that indicated to order larger, and that was not the case - I wear a small, and the medium was huge on me - order to size.  Most disappointing - it looked nothing like the photo - the material, color, design - all different. I returned it because I did not like the look or fit. If it had looked like the photo, I probably would have exchanged it for a small."
1.0,"I have a blouse that has cherries all over it, and thought these earrings would be a nice addition to wear with it. The “red” cherries were not red at all, they were actually orange. Don’t waste your money!"
1.0,I'm not sure why they would pass this on as wool but it is light weight and NOT warm. My feet are freezing. I was better off with my cotton socks.
1.0,I'm not over weight I ordered larger than I thought but this shirt would fit a small child
1.0,Transparent
1.0,"I liked the color, but wasn’t the brushed cotton that my other tee shirt was ( the same brand)"
1.0,"Ordered it while it was on sale last year, stored it until Easter when she could wear it, opened it this morning and BOOM. No skirt. Ruins the whole outfit. Thanks a lot jerks."
1.0,You can barely see the picture unless you look at it just right. Not to mention how blurry it is. Their “design team” clearly did nothing to fit it properly. The picture isn’t very clear. I’m extremely upset with this gift for my girlfriend going overseas for the military.  Waste of $25...
1.0,The 2 shorts were supposed to be a pack of two same size ahorts. When i opened the package one was big and the other one small. My daughter can only fit into one of the short. So disappointed and will definitely not buy from this seller again.
1.0,Absolutely terrible!<br />So cheap looking and super long!!!<br />NO STARS<br />Sending them right back
1.0,Still waiting several weeks; didn’t receive
1.0,"I couldn't tell you how this fits because I never got it.  I emailed them 3 times with no luck of them getting back to me.  I don't have the hat, nor do I have my money back. Will not order from them again!"
1.0,did not meet my expectation.I wanted everything zipped for security to avoid dropping off.It has just a partial zip
1.0,go a few sizes down
1.0,I am not one to do product  reviews but this item is AWFUL!  I have had Halloween Costumes made with better material and quality.  This looks nothing like the picture.
1.0,Looks and fits awful. I was very disappointed.
1.0,Run small; not warm.
1.0,"Avoid! These sizes are wildly inaccurate. I usually wear a 1X or 2X depending on the style and quality. My inseam is regular/average. Based on the reviews, I bought a 5X to be safe. They barely fit width-wise. There was an extra 9 to 10 inches (no exaggeration) of fabric passed my ankles.  Rolling the hem looked ridiculous. They were terribly unflattering, even for overalls, even if they did fit. The fabric is tough. Do not waste your time or money."
1.0,Some stitches had caught up part of the bodice.  crap sewing job
1.0,No crown comes with it
1.0,"Of course I wasn't expecting much when I ordered a cheap watch, but I never even got to wear it.  The clasp broke trying to open it.  I guess I will get a new band but the band will cost more than the watch.  I guess it will go in the trash!"
1.0,"Broke after first use. Purchased an American Tourister strap set for my wife at Wal-Mart and was much better quality, they did not have black straps in stock so thought I would try these. Very disappointed."
1.0,My wife used it for 3 weeks and it snapped on her. She doesn't run or sqaush them. It just broke off. I wanted to get her a nicer pair of house slippers as she had a pair of chancletas that was with her for 5 years but clearly we need another replacement.  We might as well go to the dollar store for another one. What a waste of money.
1.0,I got the right size but the shirt is short as s***. it's more of a tank top!! word of advice DON'T BUY!!! UNLESS UR 11 because I have to give mines to my niece
1.0,Way too small.  Returned them immediately!
1.0,This item not as described. This is not 925 sterling silver. Ring started to change color. Disappointed on purchase.
1.0,"Very poor quality.  Arms are so wide and hit at a very awkward place on the arm.  If rolled with button it's too high, unrolled to low and so so wide.<br /><br />Just don't do it!!!"
1.0,"Really cute but the strap broke after a few days of use!!!! Good thing I can sew otherwise I'd be even more mad. If you want this purse use it with only light stuff, dont stuff it full."
1.0,This dress was awful! It wasn’t a v-neck and didn’t have pockets. Awful quality... the material was so stiff and had no swing to it. Will be returning.... overall really disappointed
1.0,Received the wrong item! Obviously quality control is lacking when you order one thing but get another.
1.0,The elastic bands were way too stretchy. It made the masks super loose for my 6 year old. Definitely not worth $17..
1.0,Rings were very tiny
1.0,"I ordered the small and I’m returning it. It is not flattering at all. The extra fabric looks awful in the hip area and it’s not even my problem area. By way of reference, I’m 5’4 and 125 lbs. An extra small MIGHT be more flattering, but this isn’t something I want to spend money on as the look just doesn’t work. The material almost reminds me of swimsuit material as well- not what I expected."
1.0,"These are adorable,but the heel strap breaks quickly.  I grave my grand daughter one pair which were broken in 4 days.  I decided to order  a size larger.  I was so disappointed when these also broke in 4 days.  We had to wait  3 weeks for the second pair.  I thought maybe they wold have been made better, but no.  I  wish either pair would have lasted, they were so cute!"
1.0,This fit was to small
1.0,Like two sizes to small I ordered XL even my size medium mom couldn’t fit in it
1.0,The strap on a left foot broke after just a few uses. It might be because it came with a crease in it. So I can't recommend these.
1.0,"These do nothing but make everything blurry unless you stand one foot from the light, even then the effect is poor. Complete waste of money!"
1.0,This dress was waaaaaaaaay toooo big... I was very disappointed and angry...and the color was way lighter than what I saw...
1.0,"These glasses broke at the lens frame.<br />Figure that one out. Seems to me that ""unbreakable "" glasses should be covered for at least a couple of years .... right ?"
1.0,"These must be sized wrong.  I ordered a M, they might be a child's medium.  Thankfully my teenage daughter can wear them or I would have definitely returned them."
1.0,"I’ve bought these gloves for years. They provide nice comfort for my arthritic hands. The most recent order 2/2023 has a very inflexible opening so I have to struggle to get them on or off. I wrote to tommie copper. No response, time to move on."
1.0,Product is very flimsy. Right leg is on the verge of breaking. These won’t last long with a 2 year old toddler. Don’t get these glasses.<br /><br />I will be returning them ASAP.
1.0,Not true to size also the bottoms are cut in a very reveling way.
1.0,It was too large. Didn't fit.
1.0,"Only received one hdobappens a lot,timeline trinkets ordered 2,got none!"
1.0,"Off in size , It doesn’t feel like a linen feels very cheap"
1.0,I believe I would have loved this item has the correct color been sent. I returned this item.
1.0,"I had returned this item as the material was too thin, abrasive, and the size was larger than expected. The fit was quite square on my body. I am a 5'1'' 95 lb. petite female."
1.0,"I will have to return them.  My daughter recently grew to a size 7 shoe.  She had jelly shoes and loved them, but outgrew them, so I was glad to find these.  Unfortunately, I ordered them in a 7, but they are exactly the same size as her size 6 shoes.  Size up if you plan to order."
1.0,"terrible quality, broke easily."
1.0,they didnt look nothin like the pic and they were waaaay too small on me
1.0,"They’re cute. But the size chart is WAYYYYYY OFF!!!!! I bought the biggest size, and my DIL (who’s a size 4) couldn’t even pull over her hips!!!<br />You need to list these as CHILDRENS SHORTS! Not for women!"
1.0,Don't know how they got such a great picture.  I requested a return
1.0,These glasses did not work at all for night time glare from other cars headlights. I was very disapointed. A waste of money.
1.0,"You can either cover the front or you can cover the back, but you cannot do both! 🤦🏼‍♀️😂 For reference, I have a 27” waist and usually wear a 4/6/small. This one is going back!"
1.0,I have ordered these type of bands for my husband from another company and he wanted another one so I bought this one because it is the two colors. He could not even slip it over his hand like the other one I got him. We missed our return window because it was a gift and by the tone I gave it to him it was to late. I would say these are more for women not for men maybe a teenager but not a typical mans hands. My husbands hands are not ginormous either. Smaller than expected
1.0,too small in the arms and chest.
1.0,Way to short for me.  I'm so disappointed!
1.0,My finger ripped a hole in these the first time I tried them on.
1.0,"Not gradient, just tight all over. Skip this product.  Have other brand for work but wanted these for use at home, but these left me in worse shape. Didn't help with swelling, just left imprints all overt my legs."
1.0,This is definitely not women sizes. Ordered a large it is very very small.
1.0,The plastic pieces that make the shirt resemble a corset tore through the shirt immediately. The fabric is super thin and cheap.
1.0,not at all as described and cheaply made.
1.0,thin and see through
1.0,Is not a product I see and different side<br />Complete wrong item<br />I very disappointed 😔😔😔
1.0,"This is the vest I bought for my daughter, but I didn't expect to receive a very dirty and worn-out clothes. It was really my worst shopping experience ever"
1.0,Very poor quality. Broke on first wear.
1.0,Bottoms fit okay. Top was huge!!
1.0,"I usually wear a size medium. I'm 5'5"" and about 135lbs. The mediums were way too baggy in the crotch area. Going down a size would not have helped enough. (BTW, I'm the wife of the account owner, so I am a woman who ordered womens shorts)"
1.0,"Fit was fine but they did get my feet wet after one wet trip also one of the eyelets came off, good for a few trips but spend the extra money on a pair that will last you more than a few hiking trips.."
1.0,"This is a beautiful boot! I got my original size 7.0 however they we just a tad bit big so in askin if I can exchange just for a 6.5 I could, however I wouldnt get it for the same price I Bought them for at 86$. The seller will refund the money but if I buy again I'd pay full price instead. Not to happy about that. Its just size change. **** beware if they dont fit and price changes**** you'll be disappointed. I really did like the boot though, it's unfortunate."
1.0,"The iPhone replacement strap is beautiful, however I can’t use it because the tool it came with to remove the links is NOT the correct size tool and it did not come with instructions...what a shame to have something you can’t even use.  I will have to spend EXTRA money to a watch repair shop/jeweler remove the necessary links.  The 1 star rating is because I can’t remove the links with the tool provided.  If I were solely basing my review on the replacement bracelet strap (look/quality), I would give it 5 stars, BUT I can’t because I have no use for it until I can get the links removed.  If you buy it, you better hope you get the correct size tool or plan on paying to have it adjusted:("
1.0,This run too small it also has a rip on the side
1.0,"A waste of time, the rings wasn’t the correct size they claimed, super small and with the balls don’t even come off....I’m so mad I will never buy another damn thing from this website it always something."
1.0,Ad says it 100% cotton. Tell you what they think you want to hear. The ad is false. Polyester and spandex
1.0,Didn’t fit at all. In normal clothing in an xl and got this in 4xl and it was still too small!! Biggest size is like a large
1.0,"Turned out to be a little bit tacky. Unfortunately, no way to tell by the limited pictures available when I bought it. It is now past the return window, so I ended up spending money on a belt that I will never wear. Note to self- do not buy clothing products on Amazon that I haven't yet seen in person. #primedayequalsthrowurmoneyinthetrashday, #igotrippedoffonamazonprimeday"
1.0,Way to small and it looks like a $5 jacket.  If you have ever ordered from wish you know what i mean.
1.0,"Instead of closing tightly and requiring pressure to open, the clasp is difficult to close, and randomly opens up while being worn. It has fallen off of my bracelet several times already. For the price I would have expected much better quality.<br /><br />Very disappointing, especially as it is such a pretty little charm."
1.0,Way too small and extremely cheap fabric. Not impressed. :(
1.0,"Just received it now. I took it out later it on my bed and noticed that it was ripped at the seems both in the front and the back. It’s also rose gold, not gold as it is stated. Very disappointed!"
1.0,The silver sheen shown in the picture is actually a dull grey when it came....supper disappointed in the product.  The gold color on the wings is also muted yellow.
1.0,The black portion is completely see through. I ordered up a size (from US sizes) and it's too be. Thank goodness it was only a $10 waste.
1.0,these are cute but the tie never stays together and my daughter ended up tripping all the time on them. Also they were way too wide and slipped off her feet
1.0,Cheap material.  The first day I wore them and 2 that are wrap around bands broke just from the force of gripping and pushing a grocery cart
1.0,Doesn't fit and adhesive works only the first couple of hours.
1.0,"This band lasted less than 12 hours before breaking.  The material is very soft and comfortable, but nowhere near as sturdy as the OEM Garmin band.<br /><br />You get what you pay for."
1.0,"I ordered a XXL, I'm 5'8"" and 215LB. I couldn't even come close to zipping it up, it was hard enough just to get my arms in the sleeves."
1.0,In the beginning I thought this necklace was beautiful and everything I was looking for. Until I wore it for a week. My neck had turned a greenish brown color and would not wipe off at all. This necklace is made very cheap. I will never buy another
1.0,"No me gustó, demasiado grueso no se puede respirar 😕, si usted lo que quiere es que su hijo pueda respirar bien no lo recomiendo"
1.0,Arrived broken and hard to access the quick release tabs
1.0,"Smells terrible even after airing out for 2 weeks.  Leather had some greasy spots in random places, doesn't look even.  I don't recommend this bag.  Buckle is also not functional if you need access to the main compartment frequently."
1.0,Really small for an X-LG.
1.0,I bought two for my wife and my daughter. One of them get scratched in the first day of use although it was handled with care and covered in its covered so being away of any hard materials. The second one after two days got broken from the plastic lock in the rubber that hold the glasses. So sad of wasting money in such poor quality products.!!
1.0,[[VIDEOID:1f5fc9119e873db444e0ea89e80d0f63]] Flimsy 99cent store quality
1.0,I work 12 hours and these socks just aren’t up to the task. The material is too thin and already showing some holes after only two months. I have to wear moleskin bandages to make sure I don’t get blisters. Not moisture or odor resistant either.
1.0,I usually wear size L so I ordered XL just incase. and it still fitted extremely tight. Probably a medium. You need to go about 3 sizes up. I think it's a waste of time to order...
1.0,The picture of the item is deceptive.  The item is tiny.  Doesn't even fit around my ear lobe.  This was useless and a waste of money.  I can't even use them.  Buyer beware.
1.0,It said Has glitter shiny  has not glitter is just a purple  Overpriced piece of cloth
1.0,This cannot be an extra large!
1.0,"The backs were bent, couldnt use them"
1.0,"Cute dress but arrived damp, stinky, and moldy.  Straps are kind of flimsy, but would look adorable with a short shrug sweater or light, summer blazer.  Such a shame.  The entire back of the dress was stained with mold.<br /><br />Needless to say, going back."
1.0,These are HUGE. Not what we thought. More like the funny glasses at the fair
1.0,creo que se encigio
1.0,"Horrible , the size is not accurate at all"
1.0,"Very cheap, large tag on outside of glove not inside as shown in the picture, faded color, washed out, exterior is a rough material."
1.0,"These leggins are pictured with a high waist band.  They do not have a high waist band.  It also does not include high waist band in the description of the pants, but it does not specify either that the waist band is simple your typical thin elastic band that stretches under the belly button. I would have loved these pants if the waist hand been thick and high, because the fabric is nice and the design cute."
1.0,"This mask can be described as a lot of things. Purple, which is what I wanted. Different, which is want I wanted and with a pocket for filters, which is what I needed but Sparkly? ABSOLUTELY NOT!  And there is nothing ""gold"" about this mask. For $16 and a 3 and a half week wait for this mask to arrive it is definitely not worth it. The picture gives the illusion that this is a glittery mask or at least has a sparkly or ""blingy"" element to it. It does not. It is a fabric mask with some kind of purple and white abstract pattern on it. Which is what the color of this mask should be called. ""Purple Abstract Pattern"". I requested a refund and got a message saying ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience.<br />We stated in our product description that our product is digitally printed. "" One question do these pictures match their picture?"""
1.0,"The little car broke off after about an hour and I thought ""oh well"", there is still one on the other foot and I can live with it. Then a week after wearing them the strap broke and now the return window is closed. Would rate zero stars if it would let me."
1.0,the jewels were cute but the hoops are extremely to big for my nose
1.0,I like the size but the color is not as bright as other pins.
1.0,WAY TOO SMALL!!!<br />If merchandise is being sold in the USA use proper American sizes. As soon as I took them out of the package I knew they wouldn’t fit. I’m returning them for credit
1.0,Was month late. Did not look anything like the picture. Broke the day I got it. Very disappointed.
1.0,"These shoes look super cute, but they broke after the second wear!"
1.0,It’s not waterproof
1.0,"STOP! Don't buy this! Absolutely a waste of time and money. Beanie? No, thin t-shirt material. Adult size? Hardly. It doesn't even fit properly on a dolls head! I bought this for a gift for my 7 year old!"
1.0,terrible quality for the price
1.0,Broke within two months of barely using it
1.0,"I did not like that the length of the belts was not 50"" as stated, but was actually less than 44"" so they did not come close to fitting."
1.0,It looked horrible on me and it's more like two pieces vs one. It's one dress but it's a weird fit.
1.0,Cheap material very thin does not work very well at all
1.0,"Very low quality, pleating in front does not lay nice at all!!! It says do not iron but almost impossible to get wrinkles out, I washed it three times just to get the package wrinkles out."
1.0,"Trashy, bulky and cheap looking. they're METAL :("
1.0,Very poorly made- stripes across the whole dress don’t even line up! Seam right down the front with mis- aligned stripes as your first view!!!
1.0,Not what I wanted to small
1.0,"I keep getting emails in my inbox asking me to review these...so here it is. I loved the color and lightweight nature of these cute packing cubes but they are NOT durable. They don't compress clothes like other packing cubes. On my second trip using them, the seam broke on one of the bags. I imagine the others are not far behind. I would return them--but apparently the time has passed for that. That's unfortunate since in travel--you might not use these enough times to see the wear before the return period is up. Hope this review saves others the hassle."
1.0,Not worth the money doesn't even have diamonds like ad said do not buy it's only like 50$ watch
1.0,I ordered this sleep set with the intention of using the top. I ordered in the largest size offered.  It ran very small and was very clingy material.  I also thought it was cheaply made.  I returned it.
1.0,"The clasp fell off before I even got it on my wrist!! I need to return the piece of garbage, What a disappoinment."
1.0,i did not like it at all . did not get what i ordered looks different from the picture. Very misleading
1.0,"Arrived broken , won't screw on properly . Dissapoontied and frankly wouldn't recommend."
1.0,These are absolutely terrible quality.<br />Not as Described.
1.0,A 3 year is sewing their coat. Oh it's not a coat. It's a sweater.
1.0,"Was excited to buy this top , loved the open shoulders and how it was flowy. And when it arrived I was extreamly disappointed.  I even bought a size up just in case. I put it on and it was skin tight and didnt look anything like the picture."
1.0,Just way to small...XL fit me like a medium
1.0,"It looks horrible very big and wide , bad fabric I never wore it and threw it away"
1.0,Bought them for my mom and she wore them for 3 days and noticed a hole in them where they weren't stitched.
1.0,Returned it. I looked like I just threw on my bed sheets.
1.0,Very thin and broke only two weeks after using it
1.0,The zipper broke after 1 wear..I would appreciate a replacement coat and I will return the other one..I hope it doesn't happen again. It's a little pricey..this shouldn't have happened..I'm disappointed..but it's a warm coat..dissatisfied customer.
1.0,I recieved it today and around the twisted part it shows the seam and it messes up how the shirt looks and lays. It isn't a sweater like it shows. It's a thick uncomfortable type material not soft at all. Doesn't look like the picture at all! Completely unhappy!!
1.0,"I followed the directions to a T putting these on my bran new red-bottoms, and the first night I wear them (a week after fully curing them/ making sure they fully set, as the directions specified) the protector immediately began slipping off my shoes, and leaving a sticky film behind, which pulled off the red paint. I had to endure a wedding rehearsal and dinner with street debris, dirt, and anything else I came in contact with on the bottoms of my shoes. They would have been better off unprotected. My shoes are now ruined.  I normally do not leave negative reviews, but I would NOT purchase if you wish to protect and preserve your shoes."
1.0,"If they would have been the correct size, they would have been fine."
1.0,This is a terrible product. Don’t waste your time or money. I did. Asked for a return and got a run around. Stay clear. An update - the seller provided a 50% “goodwill” refund which is appreciated. Half is better than none.
1.0,Cheap and doesn’t look like the picture
1.0,it was way too big.... now it's too late to return it. :(
1.0,Heads were way to small..kept goimg into my pircing hole
1.0,Hi I didn't get the right size for my watch it's too small I would like a refund. I ordered 5
1.0,"So far, about a third of the gloves I've used have had tears or holes.  Not an acceptable level of quality. They also feel smaller than other Large size gloves I've ordered."
1.0,Like the color and the fit but it has holes on both sides.  Would not waste money on this.
1.0,The material was cringy feeling
1.0,"The image in the thumbnail is not the same as their mask. That mask is available on Etsy for over 500.00. Also, their video showing the mask has this horrible strobe so you can’t clearly see it. If it smells like a scam…"
1.0,"Less than dollars store, Straight to trash can. Don't,"
1.0,Drawstring missing
1.0,they fall off and dont screw in after a couple uses
1.0,Don't remember using it
1.0,don't know never got them
1.0,"Bought this and a coral top in the same order. Boy! I wish I bought one alone cause they both are a huge disappointment. Material cheap, transparent and big!"
1.0,"I only own Olukai sandals as they keep my foot from hurting after long walks and I love their products.<br />This one is also a perfect fit and keeps my foot from hurting, but the material on top mildews after a day in them and stinks."
1.0,"This particular band broke within 3 days of receiving it. Would not recommend! Is not flexible, a bit stiff when wearing."
1.0,Was not at all like the picture and was way smaller than what I had ordered
1.0,It does not look nothing like the picture
1.0,"I’m obligated to add a star, that they don’t deserve. Please I want my money back!  Look at the pictures of the pour quality of this bathing suit.  Both parts has threats everywhere.  The mistakes are huge!"
1.0,"I'm 5'11 and 125lbs. I wear a size 4 and or small in all my clothes. I've purchased similar panties before and knew they ran kind of small. Therefore, I purchased a medium instead of a small per the size chart. The panties were so tiny that I couldn't get them on. In fact, they were so little that I doubt a 6 year old could've fit into them. There's, obviously, a flaw in either (1) the labeling or (2) the product.<br /><br />It's truly disappointing because these panties are ever extremely sexy and super cute. I wish that my delivery had gone as well as everyone else's because I had been looking forward to wearing them this weekend.... For something special. I'm sure you know what I mean. 😔"
1.0,"Arrived LATE and box was crushed. If I had known that it would arrive AFTER Christmas, I would not have ordered. Quality of the boots, well cheap is cheap and you get what you pay for. Not well constructed, light weight, not at all soft."
1.0,My son has naturally curly hair. The band that connects to the frame of the glasses gets caught in my son's hair. I wouldn't buy this if your child has a lot of hair.
1.0,Fit 3 size smaller. I gave it to my daughter. A 12yr old
1.0,WAY TOO SMALL!!!!<br />I ordered a 24 (3×). The blouse is labeled 24 but its probably a size 16.
1.0,"The description says “Super Long” and the picture displays length to the ankle. However, the cost arrived to the knee. Sooo disappointed. Do not purchase if you want this one very long."
1.0,If you are looking for a sweatshirt don't buy this as all it is is a long sleeve t-shirt. Well actually I think long sleeve t-shirt are even thicker than this. Not happy with this product whatsoever
1.0,"I loathe spending more than $15 on leggings but I needed a sturdier pair for hiking. These were perfect! I was so pleased! I bought them because they had a zipper pocket so I don't lose my phone on steep hikes and rock scambles. On my second hike wearing them the zippers broke mid hike. I've contacted the company but no response. I won't be spending more than $15 on leggings again. Ridiculous.<br /><br />Follow Up: I finally reached the company. They asked for a ton of information which was a pain but I provided it. Then no response. I reached out again and they asked for the same info I already provided. I copied and pasted. This happened another 2 or 3 tines before I received return instructions, which I followed. They informed me it would take 3 to 4 weeks for a refund. 6 weeks later I reached out. They asked me for the same info AGAIN! I provided it again. I waited a week and nothing. Reached out again. They asked me for the same lengthy info yet again. I provided it. No response.<br /><br />Long story long....don't buy anything from this company. If you do, don't expect a refund for anything. I'm shocked such an expensive and reputable company has such abysmal customer service. Now I'm out some $60 plus the cost of shipping and have no leggings either."
1.0,very poor quality material and printing
1.0,SEQUIN LEGGINGS WERE WAY TOO SMALL! 😩 I'M A SIZE 4 IN JEANS & I COULDNT GET THESE LEGGINGS ON! UNLESS YOU ARE A SIZE ZERO DON&#34;T GET THESE LEGGINGS!
1.0,Definitely does not hang naturally like it does in the picture.
1.0,Recommend going up a size
1.0,"The only good thing was that it came in time. This purse came broken. The latch wasn’t attached, the bottom at latches weren’t attached, the inside is coming apart, you can see in between the fabric and I can’t even use the purse."
1.0,I ordered a XXL according to the size chart and it was too small. I normally wear a 38DD/40D. If you’re heavy chested I wouldn’t suggest it. Returning both colors (white/sage green).
1.0,Bought as a gift for my wife. Bought the XXL and it's the size of a medium at best.
1.0,Much too small for any ankle. Pretty but can only fit on wrist. Not ankle can not force it or will definitely break
1.0,por favor  que engañooooooo.
1.0,It is like getting that white fluffy packaging from inside shipping envelopes everywhere. The faux white shearling is similar to pillow stuffing that gets everywhere and on everything. So disappointed.
1.0,Disappointing. It broke the next day :(
1.0,"These socks don't even expand barely to get over your calves. If you have any body at all to your calfs, they won't fit."

1.0,Tore after first use

1.0,"I did not received the COLOR  that I ordered, it’s way different!!!..... but fits fine"
1.0,"I received the boots on time, unfortunately, the right boot arrived with a tear at the outside seam. I have another pair of the DAWGS  boots in the camel color, and have loved them. I was very excited to get another pair in black. I am so disappointed as I wear my boots constantly and was looking forward to having them over the holiday."
1.0,"After only 24 hours, the top of one of the slippers had already separated from the sole.  There is a four inch gap and likely to become much longer."
1.0,"If grips on the bottom of these socks are important, don't buy them.  They don't have them.  They are really cute though.  I kept mine, but I am unhappy they don't have grips."
1.0,Ok. Got these because I love Smartwool products. I received someone’s used underwear - tags cut and smelling of a really gross heavily perfumed laundry detergent. Come on Amazon! Deal with reputable partners.
1.0,Not comfortable really cheap
1.0,"As for me, this style fit would have never fit my body the way it is meant to. The waist fit. Little bit tight around the belly. I am 5'6&#34; and 130-135 pounds."
1.0,junk do not buy. grandson start complaning about his heels hurting. thats where the batteries are located they worked there way up and was digging into his heels
1.0,"Didn't fit as expected, white changed colour and it was very uncomfortable. This was after one (1) wear so out the door it goes. Very disappointed."
1.0,"It went from a shiny silver coat to a &quot;rose gold&quot; in a little over a month, I kept on wearing it, last weekend it finally snapped. I would love to order it again, but I don't feel like throwing my money out the window again"
1.0,Only received two of the 5 rings.
1.0,Too big for my face. Had to send back
1.0,I liked the color of the dress but it was ill fitting.  I wasn't a fan of the fabric as it wasn't the greatest quality of linen.  The sizes are off by a size.
1.0,"So disappointed, way way way too small. We couldn’t even get them halfway on her feet. Im thinking they fit more like a size 2-3 because of all the fluff."
1.0,Three pair in set. Red pair balls came off first time worn. Black pair balls fell off 4th time worn.
1.0,1 star because horrible quality
1.0,"It doesn’t fit the way the picture shows.  Only one strap around your midsection which causes most of your midsection to be out and not covered.  If you pull it down to cover your midsection like the picture shows, the thigh straps will not cover your thighs. During my workout the thigh straps get loose.  And the thigh straps rub together while I’m walking on the treadmill, which is annoying."
1.0,"Do not purchase these glasses, they are flimsy, and the lenses pop out."
1.0,"While it got to me on time and fit well, there is a sizable void in the print where it is just a white line. So if I wear it you just see this jagged white line through the pattern. Not impressed with the quality."
1.0,Too small and very see through.
1.0,Description says 6 pack but only received one shirt.
1.0,Turned my finger green
1.0,"This does not represent what it means to be an Alabama fan. What updyke did was disgraceful. As much as I hate Auburn like the rest of em, there is still a level of class which must be upheld."
1.0,"Got the shoes 5 seconds ago, opened up and VERY disappointed 😞.  The shoes looked worn and beat up. I bought NEW NOT USED. sending back and adding pics"
1.0,I returned for refund.  It arrived with scratches on the band and a poor looking face.  Perhaps we just received a terrible one and others are great.
1.0,"Literally, I just wore it not more than four times and one of the glasses fell.<br />( it's not a joke.)"
1.0,This ring was really beautiful but unfortunately the crystals fell out after wearing it for only two days and I had to return the product.
1.0,The slippers are a safety hazard.  You will likely break you neck trying to walk in these.  It is cheap and not at all functional. Super disappointed. The material of the robe is extremely cheap. Not at all worth it.
1.0,These were some of the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn in my life! They made my feet hurt so bad that I got a headache. I took them on vacation with me but I did not bring them back home. I put those things in the trash where they belonged
1.0,I read most of the reviews on this shirt and what a good fit is was been wearing medium shirts my whole life got this shirt and it would barely fit on a 12 year old boy
1.0,"This “shirt”, if you can even call it that, is poorly made, see through, and nothing like the pictures. Previous shirts were a lulu lemon dupe then the company got too many orders and had to switch suppliers and they cut every corner in the book. I wish it didn’t take $4 to ship it back Bc that’s half of the cost of the item. Do not buy this at allll. It’s a wast of money and a huge disappointment. I will not be buying with this company again."
1.0,"I had it for about a month and it has lost it gold color.  Now it is silver, which I didn’t want. Don’t buy"
1.0,"The twist is on the side, not like the picture. It is badly sewn and made. You might as well wear a cloth over you."
1.0,The picture led me to believe that the band was reversible but it is not
1.0,Was not pleased with this product!
1.0,Itchy material on face<br />Just a cut out sleeve<br />Faded designAnd color<br />Definitely not reversible
1.0,"I have been using my husband's gym bag for the longest time since he doesn't really use it. It was too big and bulky... I am 5ft tall and the bag would hit my knees awkwardly. This small gym bag is perfect for my needs AND it fit everything I needed from my husband's bag. So far, so good. I love that it has a loop to fit on a luggage. I live in Europe and I can easily use this bag as a carry on in addition to my gym needs!<br /><br />***UPDATE: There is a 6 inch tear at the seam of the main zipper after the first couple uses. I am so disappointed. I loved this bag so much and I wanted it to be durable. Unfortunately, there is no way to contact the seller.***"
1.0,I am SOOO disappointed in these DG Hill Mary Jane slipper socks ! I always but Muk luk slipper socks before I found these for a much better value! I was excited to get them and tried them on right away and they fit as expected so I washed them and started wearing a pair well after about 20 minutes of wearing them my feet on the bottom started to hurt every step I took from the way to hard and big round rubber skid resisters on the bottom ! Ouch they are SOOO uncomfortable because of them rubber circles on bottom that I can't even wear them anymore ! Unfortunately I threw away packaging materials and doubt I can return them ! I guess you live and learn cheaper is not always better ! I won't even donate these to goodwill because I don't want anyone else getting sore souls ! Other then that they were very soft and fit well !
1.0,"These fangs are cheap and TERRIBLE!! They don't mold right, they don't sit well in your mouth at all. They actually broke when I was trying to mold them in my mouth!! Buy something better, do NOT waste your money on these things!!!"
1.0,Had high hopes for this. Broke within a month of use.
1.0,Broke after first wearing
1.0,"I gave this to my best friend as a gift for xmas and a short time later it turned yellow and tarnished. This is what I would expect if I paid 5 or 10 dollars but, not for this price. She absolutely loved it and was heartbroken it was un-wearable."
1.0,It came as 5 feet of fabric that u have to make into a dress
1.0,Not well constructed.  Looks almost like a fake shirt - instant return.  Love Prime!
1.0,Fit so small I returned it. It also didn't fit at all like the picture showed.
1.0,This isn't even close to being sized correctly.  The quality seems decent but it's completely useless as it's at least 2 possibly 3 sizes too small.
1.0,I repeat not touch screen compatible.
1.0,All the ice packs a person has to put in the vest is just poor design. We sent it back
1.0,I'm still trying to get return labels ad refund.
1.0,Muy mala calidad..muy Delgado el material
1.0,My wife said she couldn't even put her phone in this purse. It didn't look like the one pictured and it is extremely cheaply made.
1.0,"Cheaply made, runs small and not the shirt pictured in the ad.  Very disappointing. Letters ironed on and David would have never sold this quality shirt!  Too bad, really wanted to like it, but ewww."
1.0,"Idk who sizes these, but these are not Boys’ pants, they’re Toddler pants."
1.0,Too small. Couldn't even get wrists through the sleeve.
1.0,"Cheap material and they don't hold up to exercise, they tore the first time I ran in them. Don't waste your money.I was really disappointed because they were a cute design just not well built."
1.0,I didn’t like how thick the plastic was because it was difficult to breath and the ear piece hurt my ears
1.0,"These are terrible. They fit poorly, one is missing a button on the side, and they're shaped in a very odd and ugly way."
1.0,This is literally the worst. Looks nothing like the picture. Says it has a metal coating but it is 100% latex that isn't even attached to the foam frame.
1.0,"Demasiado grande, y la tela no es como se ve en la imagen.."
1.0,"I love the fine detail on these earrings but I'll never be able to wear them. The end of the piece you are supposed to put through your ear is bent so that it will catch and fasten the back of the earring. The problem is its bent in a U shape that is impossible to put through a piercing.  Normally I  would just use pliers to unbend it so they are wearable,  but when I tried the metal snapped off.  DO NOT BUY."
1.0,"I have already returned the pearls.  They were not 11-15 mm<br />I worked in Fine Jewelry at Bonwit-Teller and know pearls.<br />I was not expecting great for the price, but these just were not the<br />advertised size."
1.0,Rubber falls apart
1.0,"Doesn't fit like the picture at all. It's not fitted at all, its like wearing a bag."
1.0,"I purchased this thinking it was true to size it definitely was not, sometimes I can swing a M if it’s leaning more on the L size . I’m 5’5 150. And 3 of me could have fit into the L. I recommend if you’re normally a L so maybe try the S."
1.0,I didn't like this dress......AT all!!!! The ruffles do not look like it does in the picture......there was no information on how or whom to return the dress...😡😡 I am looking for a full refund!!
1.0,Multiple buttons were missing from the dress when my order got delivered. Poor quality
1.0,I ordered a small and received an XXL.
1.0,It’s incredibly thin
1.0,Very cheap quality. Started to fall apart with one use.
1.0,"Bonita pero malísima, no me duró ni tres días, hay mismo cambio de color"
1.0,I have only had this ring for one week and it is already turning my finger green not impressed !!!
1.0,I must have been having a mentally bad day to buy a dress this inexpensive. Way too small. Only good thing was the color
1.0,Pissed off. These rings are plastic!!!  I want a refund on these. I'm beyond ticked off!!!!
1.0,"I own two other TNF Women's black glacier 1/4 zip fleeces. Both were bought in store. This one arrived marked regular M which is my size. However, the chest measurement was more suitable to a small and the arms had a length that was 1/3 longer than my arms! Also, the tag was torn in half, making me believe that this was a second... Sorry, but returned for a full refund."
1.0,Bought extra large. I need to roll them to put them on. After about 45 minutes of 30-40 degree weather my finger tips are very cold. Gloves are a very sloppy fit and they are so puffy I need to take them off to clip my dog leash to his harness. I don't know how they got good reviews these gloves are hard to put on because the ribbing is tight and so short it makes it cumbersome to put on.
1.0,Too small.. No way anyone could fit in them to wear.  Bought as a gift very disappointed.
1.0,Pedí la talla más grande y ni así me quedo de el pecho ni de los brazos.
1.0,Horrible.  Broke within 3days.
1.0,"The product description says eco-friendly, non-toxic but the label says 100% PVC which is one of the most toxic plastics. If you look above the bar code it says in English. I don't trust things I can't read and the only thing I can is toxic. PVC is different because of the addition of chlorine.  Chlorine is a major health concern associated with PVC, but it isn’t the only problem.  The Institute for Market Transformation to Sustainability discusses the full effects PVC which can effect reproductive, immune, endocrine and neurological systems.<br />Return!!!"
1.0,Way too small for my purposes
1.0,Baby suit for my grand baby.too big I sent back awaiting refund....on May 23nd
1.0,Really cheap flimsy material.  Has a metal hinge in the side which doesn't show in pictures. And pictures show a more solid stiffer mask. Not happy with it. But you get what you pay for.
1.0,The draft they sent me was not the one in the picture I was so disappointed because I had at a special event to go to where I stay at and I have to cancel it
1.0,Totally disappointed. Wrong size. Poor quality.
1.0,"After reading various reviews it seemed this would be a quality belt, yes the price was very low, but with amazon you never know. At first glance the belt was perfect, was stiff, well build, and the rivets seemed quality. After a few days it began to fall apart. The rivets began to bend and deform. What appeared to be nice quality leather proved to be a solid leather core, with fake leather stickers on the front and back to give the look of quality (have already began to peel) the spring loaded reversible mechanism came apart at the buckle, (10 min before I had to leave for work) I managed to disassemble the belt remove the spring piece and put in a permanent screw to keep the two parts together.<br /><br />If you use a belt for more of a look and less utilitarian this might be the perfect belt, but for those of us who actually use it to keep our pants up. look somewhere else."
1.0,Please do not buy this blouse. The quality is unbelievably poor and you can see right through it. It is so poorly made that it does not have a label on the back to show you what kind of material it is made of.  I am embarrassed to donate this shirt to the homeless. That is how poorly made it was.
1.0,these are worthless/my son is a paraplegic obviously he dsnt walk/these fellapart in a week terrible merchandise
1.0,"Purchased this bra in what I thought was my size, but when it arrived it was a completely different size, if tag size is different than what is listed, make it more obvious in the description."
1.0,I am giving this 1 star as this product did not serve the purpose of No Show Socks. The socks were visible
1.0,These were terrible.. I didn’t try to send them back because thats kinda weird but i will most likely throw them out.
1.0,"poorly constructed, neckline was just cut into fabric, not sewn."
1.0,The product arrive very late and damaged. I also noticed that it was very poor quality. My wife was not at all happy with it. It was returned
1.0,Very shear and runs super small!
1.0,So junky don’t buy<br />Worst quality looks nothing like picture
1.0,Didn’t receive all the pieces
1.0,Buenas estoy esperando todavía me producto desde que lo compré el 11 de junio y aún no me ha llegado aparte de eso me enviaron uno de obsequio por el inconveniente de tanto esperar por mi primera compra y ese si llego pero solamente el estuche vacío sin gafas adentró y lo único que pido es que por favor me llegue mis gafas que fue la primera compra el monto se fue de 155.51$
1.0,Broke minutes after I put it on.
1.0,Nice color. VERY stiff.
1.0,Only holds 2 credit cards.
1.0,There is a huge hole in the arm after one wear. I haven’t even washed it yet. Very disappointed because it looks very cute on my pregnant bump.
1.0,Small. XXL is more like a M/L.
1.0,These were way too small. I wear a lg and it wouldn't even go over my legs!
1.0,"Loved the look of the slipper , but I wear a brace on my foot & slipper wouldn't fit over .; so had to return it."
1.0,"The skirt on this is so short and cut so that if you walk or the wind blows the right way, the skirt blows open and the whole world can see your crotch. This dress could work as a tunic with leggings and flats circa 2006, but as a standalone dress in 2020 it's just a disappointing wardrobe malfunction. Returned."
1.0,Received my product and it was horribly made. Just two holes for the arms. Stitching is visible. I'm returning this.
1.0,They look as pictured but they are made cheap. They broke after wearing them a couple of hours.  I was disappointed because they went well with my outfit. I wont buy earrings online again.
1.0,"I bought a couple pairs of these 2-3 years ago, liked them and thought it was safe to order these. Shouldn't have. Twice the price and the sizing is MUCH smaller now. Can barely get them on my feet and then they're too tight in the toe area. Good Will or the thrift store will be getting these."
1.0,Weak material. But it fits good.
1.0,I HATE IT. it has ripped twice under my armpit... its very thin fabric so you can see straight through it like a window. but seriously it gets ripped so easily. do not buy this!!!
1.0,they were bigger them I thought they would be
1.0,Very cheaply made! Seam falling apart & took almost a month to receive it. So unsatisfyied that gave it took good will & never wore it!
1.0,This thing is so small I couldn’t pull it up my leg. It’s like they sizes are for kids instead of women.
1.0,The colors didn’t line up. The stripes were uneven
1.0,I unfortunately didn't check the quality of the dress when I received it until recently.  the stitching on one of the straps was frayed and half off.
1.0,"The shirt is not cotton as it appears in the picture. Also has a straight hem, not curved as pictured. Will be returning."
1.0,Didn't care for feel of fabric and much thinner then I expected.
1.0,Looks different from the picture and is awkward to put on.
1.0,Unfortunately the item has started to tarnish after about a month.
1.0,"I am disappointed in the sizing. I ordered an x large and it is more like a medium.  I can wear extra large in any other brand of tanks, etc but this one is very very narrow in the waist.  I am thinking this is a junior x large but not women's.  I prefer some looseness to tanks so heat can circulate when I run, but sadly this was too snug."
1.0,Did not work at all. I had this sitting in direct sunlight all day and it never glowed at night. Stains material white. Sprayed it outside on some landscaping rocks. They never glowed and stained them white.
1.0,"Too fat, cant put in the ear"
1.0,Gave this as a gift to a friend and within the first day it came apart!! Can’t even put it back together.
1.0,"I bought this product thinking it will relieve the pain in my shoulders due to tendinitis, but it did not help me at all, I tried wearing it for few days, but I saw no improvement. Waste of money. I do not recommend this product."
1.0,Cheap material and the belt does not align with the dress as pictured. The length is also much shorter than it appeared.
1.0,It took a very long time for it to be “ delivered “ I never received my items
1.0,Very large up top but very very small in the hips.  Can not use this at all.
1.0,"This is an awful product not worth buying it looks like somebody previously purchased the item and removed the comfort lining in the middle that insulates the irritating places where it will rub against the skin and chafe leaving red skin burnmarks, claiming that the shaped form is a padded push up bra, but that isn't the type of format the posture bra is supposed to have offered so you should go back to the Victoria Secret company and stop harrassing people who are seeking to relieve their personal discomfort. I'm reached the limit of my patience, and if you're wondering why I'm so suspicious is because this person in particular has not ceased hounding the local shopping stores by leaving no remaining suitable sizes because she thinks she's superior in silicone size to other people who simply want to be comfortable and aren't trying to compete for attention but merely seeking proper breathing facilities as well as the immediate end to constant back pain that the assigned medical team has ignored for numerous years. I know they are reading this because this is yet again another prevention by them in order to excuse their incapability to provide the expert treatment they have advertise to give to other customers, but now they're nervous since they've been paid for over a year and now they know that they will become exposed as fraudulent so they just had to interfere yet another time and I have no more limit for this type of behavior. If you spent less time deliberately bothering another person by ruining their purchased items then you wouldn't have to feel so embarissed about yourself and just buy the cheaper bra shapers, they're not size increasers but made to not be so obvious which is what you really need."
1.0,Don't waste your money. Horrible horrible quality.  😫
1.0,Fabric is cheap. I will never wear this.
1.0,Still cannot remove the weird smell from this item.
1.0,These really irritate my ears and hurt.
1.0,really weir shape. Not at all like picture. Sent them back
1.0,"Order at least a size up or two<br />This is on the very small size, especially if you have a longer torso<br />Great material though"
1.0,This was a size 12 extra wide.  Not extra wide for my husband and I have returned the product.
1.0,This product claims to be hypoallergenic and nickel free and it is not. I've worn plenty of jewelry with the same claim and they all were totally fine and worked very well. This specific jewelry made my ear swell and become infected even. its pretty though
1.0,I would not recommend buying this. It fell apart within the first week of owning it. It looks nice when it's staying together though
1.0,"No, no, no, no!!!Couldn't even try it on seeing as I couldn't get my arms into the sleeves!! Only other thing I have that fits this way was made, sized and shipped from China!! Guessing the same is the issue with this cardigan. Definitely would not recommend"
1.0,"Very disappointed. This dress runs super small, the material is not pretty up close. Waist of money, will be sending back"
1.0,Chain was took out of bag and 5 minutes later after trying it on it broke.
1.0,Nothing like the picture at all!
1.0,"Not for a dark or brown skin, look really bad in my skin."
1.0,Ordered a size bigger<br />It was two sizes too small<br />Loved the shirt
1.0,Bought this for my mom for Christmas. 2 weeks later and 3 of the 4 charms have already fallen off just during normal wear.
1.0,Works great fits well
1.0,Material is a very bad fabric.  This fabric is a joke. Can't even believe there can sell something like this.
1.0,The top is pretty but the bottom crochet was completely lopsided; not sewn straight. Returned it immediately and won’t order another.
1.0,"These are comfy, but ripped the first time we washed them."
1.0,These didn't stretch at ALL. I always size up and they barely went over my feet let alone my thighs. So disappointed
1.0,The overall costume was ok. The material was thin and cheap. The sizing is way off (too small).  I have ordered this costume twice and both times my son was extremely disappointed because I had to return it.
1.0,"The main reason I purchased these luggages were due to high ratings & good reviews. I understand these bags claim to be lightweight yet sturdy but when we received them they were so flimsy! My wife & I were so nervous to bring them to our international flight to Japan. However, that was not the issue. The top handle on the largest bag had broken when we received our baggage at our destination! So disappointed these bags did not last one trip and it created a terrible travel experience during our trip."
1.0,Buy a real belt that can't open at the touch of feather.
1.0,"I got a small but this is so long I could wear as a dress. It’s too long to tuck in! The material is rough also, it felt scratchy!"
1.0,"I am upset that this item didn't come when it was supposed to. I requested a refund and they asked me to wait for it longer. Now, it has been almost 2 months and I finally got it yesterday. Low and behold it doesn't fit and conveniently the window closed to return this item. SO RIDICULOUS! The sewing is awful, it fits extremely strange. You have to have really skinny arms and torso with boobs. I am not an Anime character!<br />I want a REFUND."
1.0,"Vino dañada la borla, pague tanto para un producto defectuoso"
1.0,Too small and not as pictured!
1.0,"Ive ordered this now twice in 2 sizes.  Im very familiar with Amazon off- brand sizing so even tho im a size 14 and normally wear an xl on top l on bottom i ordered xxl the first time.  Couldn't get it past my waist.  Reordered in xxxl. Got it on but it squishes your fat on the back straps so bad it wouldn't be suitable to wear in public. 44-38-42,  I usually wear a 40 in competitive swimwear the xxxl is maybe a 36 or an american medium. I just wanted a tight suit that had longer legs so i wouldn't have to shave to go swim laps. All the other reasonably priced off-brand swimtards are baggy and meant for water aerobics and not lap swimming."
1.0,"Extremely thin. Super tight. Not worth the money spent. If you do purchase this, get some long tight slip to wear underneath.<br />Update:  it is so cheap that I can not justify the money spent on this dress. Looks pretty. But threads are hanging from the hem line and even with a slip you can see through."
1.0,"I am a guy reviewing this.<br />(Purchased for girlfriend)<br />We are in agreement on this review:<br /><br />1. Flat.<br />2. Old looking, and not in a good way like antique or well oil rubbed metal.<br />3. Girlfriend said &#34;We need to give this to Grandma Ruth&#34;. We don't have Grandma Rut! Looks like belongs in a nursing home<br />4. Bottom looks like thin sheet metal was spun on a machine and bent forward. as a matter of fact thats exactly the tecnique that was used... kind of like when they make pots/pans for cooking. there are ugly stretch marks all over it.<br />5. Looks like an ugly ash tray a metal worker would make in his/her shop.<br />6. I wouldn't feed my cat out of this. Looks like would release all kinds of lead/mercury (this is not confirmed, so dont take this part seriously) but does look shady.<br /><br />*For people that think theirs arrived W/O a screw to connect base with the &#34;tree&#34;. Check the bottom of the tree. They scree it in there. All you need to do is unscrew it, and then screw back in with the base. Now if its not there, then yes, its missing :)<br /><br />If you buy it and will keep, i recommend bending the brances to the side to make the tree more 3D like and realistic, but this may cause the branches to snap as they looks cheaply soldiered/welded in place. This thing looks flat like a spatula or a fly swatter.<br /><br />I looked on amazon for similar items and this one looked like it had the most potential, which is kind of sad as it turns out. I am discouraged from buying this particular product on amazon, BUT I think Amazon is awesome and have bought hundreds of items over the years.<br /><br />This thing is tiny... only the size of a standard kids' school ruler (12&#34;) I knew this going into this purchase... but just reminding you guys."
1.0,Fake. Not worth time or money because it’s hard to use and very uncomfortable :(
1.0,"So bummed.  This broke less than 24 hours after my wife put it on.  While it says ""adjustable"" I wouldn't recommend it.  The metal is very thin and the stress point in the bend simply breaks instead of actually bending.  A novelty gift at best - completely non-functional as wearable jewelry."
1.0,Very Very small. This earing is only for children
1.0,"Quality of garment was very good, but unmanageable for me.  So, it's probably my problem."
1.0,Only got it because I saw a coupon code which made it and $6 or $7 other then that not worth the money and for sure not worth the asking price
1.0,it shoud it come with a band or something
1.0,"So cute!! Broke right away, cheaply made. Such a bummer because my daughter loves it. It broke when I opened it, so not even being rough with it. Don’t waste your money!"
1.0,My bras wouldn't fit in the case as shown. I would have had to fold them in half if I kept it. Not what I was looking for.
1.0,This dress does not look like the photos... I may need a smaller size?
1.0,Put this mask on for two minutes and two hours later I can still taste/smell the chemicals.<br />Returning them.
1.0,"Cheap , stiff"
1.0,I got this for my husband but The ink out gasses to the point of making my husband feel nauseous-  it's been raining so much where I'm at there hasn't been enough sun it out wich usually removes the VOc's in vynal bags and belts I'm not sure f it will do so for this ink though-  I've washed it three times dried it twice but the Heat enhances the smell - I then let it air dry but smell is still there - I'll wait till there's a sunny day to see if the sun removes the smell if so I'll change my review but juts wanted to warn anyone with chemical  sensativities that this could  effect them. Even though the design and fit were great -feeling like your going to throw up ruins it .
1.0,Cute bathing suit but not for the big busted girls like me. The top has no support at all! I am a 40D and can't use the top.
1.0,Belt looks fine but smells horrible!  Like a combination of mold and chemicals.
1.0,No! Not even close.
1.0,"Just like the picture, these shorts bag strangely in the front while riding up in the back. It’s like whoever designed these thought women don’t have butts and also thought that we have “junk in the front”. Complete waste of money"
1.0,This thing arrived broke very disappointed
1.0,A mi particularmente no estoy muy satisfecha con el producto porque aún me sigue dando estática cuando toco las puertas trabajo en clínicas que las puertas son de metal por donde tengo que abrirlas y el reloj enciendo en rojo pero el corriente o me da a mi 😞así que no le veo la función. Quería saber si ustedes tienen otro producto o quizás este está defectuoso
1.0,Material feels like plastic and is crinkley and fits really small. I ordered one size up and it wouldn't even go over my shoulders.
1.0,"The size and measurement are horrible, not proportional at all. The quality is very POOR.. REALLY LOW QUALITY"
1.0,The material was cheap and the color was off. It was cheap material and a patch job.
1.0,This was really big for my face kind of bulky it also really looks cheap
1.0,These shorts were not what I had come to expect for Wrangler Shorts.
1.0,I paid alot of money to have it sent to me and was not pleased with this product. I wear an XL ordered 2x and it doesnt fit. Way too small and it s m elled. Now i have to go out and buy a xiat whoich i should hav done before i leave for my trip. This item is made for junior or petite woman.
1.0,This bracelet came broken.
1.0,Does not look like the picture. Does not fit the face not even a elastic band to hold the mask in place. Then the wig is on a hair net. Almost forgot can’t see through the mask. Waste of money. Was forced to give 1 star
1.0,Description says they are polarized but they are not. Will be returning
1.0,the fit is weird.<br />Returned it - the refund took  a long time
1.0,Turned green after being in pool water
1.0,Terrible pure juke.  Hands collapsed after setting. Not even working. Pretty much worthless.
1.0,"It fits fine, but it is not as breathable as my cotton masks. Not buying it again."
1.0,"I have  bought several of these in the past and always bought Large since I like a loose, baggy fit.  These are a very tight fit.  Advertised as a large, marked as a large, but probably between a small and medium.  I compared theser to my other Large pants (identical brand, size, etc) and they are two or more inches smaller."
1.0,The band isn't big enough to screw into place.  This is the second band that I bought that doesn't fit.<br />I will try it one more time....
1.0,They do not fit well and slip down into your shoes and off your feet.
1.0,I wear a 2 xl and I have lost over 60 pounds and this did not fit city too short.
1.0,This dress is at least 3 sizes smaller than what was ordered. Hand written size in the tag. Don’t bother this this dress.
1.0,Received shoes that don't look like the picture.
1.0,The watch does not stay closed. It constantly falls off.
1.0,I received this item broken. And also didn’t know until I received it that it’s a kids mask. No where in the description did it state that.
1.0,Fishing string was used so they were very stiff and broke right away! Annoying to wear.
1.0,Expensive product you can get better an cheaper don't buy it.
1.0,"Cheaply made material and workmanship .  Do not recommend .  It is suppose be a gift but too ashamed to give it as gift .  Amazon should stop selling  fake and cheap, imitates stuff .  Also have to pay to ship for return.  Waste of money and time."
1.0,Didn’t fit as expected was too big and color was off
1.0,"Its the color thats not real.  I  received a St Patricks Day green.  The picture was more like hunters green,  I returned it, Waste of postage,"
1.0,"They are cute, but for that much money they should have been all silver. Rip off. Returning"
1.0,This is false advertising. The umbrella is not nearly as small as depicted in the hand. It is also very difficult to open and close.
1.0,"This vest is awful. Terribly cut, substandard material (too thin), bad construction, and item is not the same as shown in pictures. See pics.<br /><br />A standard chest size for XL is 44-46”. This vest is about 48” because the sides flare out in armpit. The vest is shaped to be flattering but because of the oversizing it end up looking like a crumpled box.<br /><br />The fabric is too thin and is practically see through in areas, which may not be an issue with darker vests.<br /><br />I expected the back to be the same off white color shown in picture but instead it is black. Quite misleading. I’m very disappointed in this vest."
1.0,Not happy at all! Wore it twice and all the seams have ripped! Pretty sad I have to spend the extra time now to fix it.
1.0,The chain looks great but soon as you try to put it on the links came apart. Wish it was made better is was a very cute necklace.
1.0,This is for little girls and not for adults.
1.0,"Too big for most faces. They look ridiculous, like costume glasses."
1.0,Pretty shirt but on the front it looks like it got hung in the serger. Going to return it. I also have to pay for shipping!😟 but too damaged to wear.
1.0,Not even 10 minutes after  receiving this package I put it on and the zipper  fell right off like it was never even attached in the first place also they feel kind of weird like they’re just made out of some really cheap Chinese material definitely not cotton and  definitely  not nylon.
1.0,"Cut slim at hips, not suited for a curvy figure. Would be perfect for slim, boy shaped bodies."
1.0,Really worthless
1.0,"Not true to size, but it’s a pretty dress! I’m 5’10 and it comes to my ankles. Form fitting at the top"
1.0,This was not wide enough to to wrap around me and keep me secured that folds coming out
1.0,This was a very cheap looking and feeling product it didn’t look anything like the picture and it arrived broken which gave me just one more reason to send it back. Not worth the buy.
1.0,Cuter online. Bummer.
1.0,"Definitley not as I expected. It for weird, had no stretch to the fabric, and overall just was a fail. Super unflattering too as I just had a baby, this dress made me feel more insecure."
1.0,"They are novelty, for sure."
1.0,i bought it for my husband we live and very sunny state and he said didn't protect and many many years i bought for him same brand and love it
1.0,[[VIDEOID:8ec6930d3d06dc966cd9cc37e75b49ce]] DISAPPOINTED!!!
1.0,"Terrible quality the arrow came off immediately after wearing, cost more to return than to buy"
1.0,Tooo short bit like the belt wearing It as a necklace
1.0,[[VIDEOID:ead21e51c4433104207fd60bcd6cec95]] I bought these to use for hand carving wood and found that they are not cut resistant. I ran a wood carving knife lightly over one glove to test for safety and the fabric opened right up. Unfortunately I tried them after the return date so they are going in the trash.  Do not purchase these gloves if you want to prevent cuts.
1.0,Only one thin layer of polyester material so unusable.
1.0,Too small and poor quality.  Complete waste of time and money.
1.0,"Not “easy on, easy off” at all,  it’s a struggle trying to get them on, and they tore the first time I wore them.<br />Don’t bother getting these - it’s a waste of money!"
1.0,"The paint used in letters wore off from hand washing, only 2.5 months old. Note it's an all black ring, defeated the purpose."
1.0,"I LOVE the look of these sunglasses. BUT, within 24 hours of purchasing, the wood on the side of the sunglasses totally broke. I did not put any weight on them, the wood just snapped. I have had other sunglasses similar to this with wood arms and a plastic frame, and these are FAR less sturdy.<br />I love the style, but they are FAR too fragile, even with minimal use.<br />I used wood glue to hold the wood back, and then it cracked in another place as I was screwing it back onto the frame. I glued it again, because I do want to use these, but I would recommend finding a pair with thicker wooden arms for stability."
1.0,I brought one of these over a year and a half ago.  It was durable and lasted with no problems. Just brought a new one and ive had it a week.  Carrying the exact same itwms in it and it ripped?? I brough two so id have another when this had worn out..now im not sure if i ahould keep it if they arent made as well as the used to be.
1.0,"I did buy size S (that’s my size normally), I couldn’t lift my shoulders, is too short in the arms, have no stretch and the material is too thin."
1.0,Made for a slim person whose neck is about 14-16 inches.  I unable to slip this on my neck.  It is not flexible at all.
1.0,It was a very pretty ring but it broke 2 weeks into having it. I was very disappointed in the product.
1.0,"Did not expected to be that small, they were baby small"
1.0,"Really wanted to love this dress. So disappointed.  Stiff, not flowy, pattern is NOT cute in person."
1.0,I did not like it at all....
1.0,"The styling is nice, and the rain jacket had many features common in more-expensive products.  I wanted to love it.  However, these significant issues prevented that:<br /><br />-the stitching quality was very poor. A one of the hook-and-loop (a.k.a. Velcro) pads was missing.  Near where it should have been was a pattern of off-angle holes where presumably the missing pad had originally been sown.  Next to that was a similar pattern for a bad seam.  Another Velcro pad had stitching over the edge of it, resulting in a loose end which ripped open further with use.  The stitching around the hood front lip was incomplete on one side.<br /><br />-the Velcro pads are of very cheap quality, such that the hooks have already begun deforming, pulling out the tips from the act of opening the joined pads.<br /><br />- it smelled a little off, and the smell didn't go completely away with washing.  It was sort of like a mild scent of mothballs.<br /><br />The smell and the stitching craftsmanship may vary from garment to garment, so I can certainly understand some positive reviews, but the quality of the Velcro pads will not change. Keep that in mind if you want this to last."
1.0,"given the wrong dress - received a black sleeveless dress! Very upset,  need the dress for vacation."
1.0,Too small. Did not provide any slimming effects and constantly rolled up. I returned them!
1.0,"It did not look like the picture, and it was broken when I received it.  I will give credit for the easy return."
1.0,"DO NOT LISTEN TO THE OTHER REVIEWERS! I bought an extra large because the reviews say that you should buy two sizes bigger. I shouldn’t have listened, I should have bought a medium, because this is WAY too big! Also the fabric looks soft in the picture, but it’s actually very stiff, scratchy, and rigid. I don’t recommend it."
1.0,Missing belt… no back pockets
1.0,Fell apart. Very poor quality. Threw them away.
1.0,"I really don't like this apron, it is to short it is nothing like the chief apron, sorry I had to pass this on to a co worker"
1.0,The main picture of the listing shows a buckle. I have similar bands with buckles and you can customize your fit. Not these so they are going back. Very disappointed.
1.0,Tiny... Very light weight
1.0,"I have an ordinary size 8 foot and not a fat leg--just a slightly swollen ankle following an injury some years ago.  I first reported I couldn't get the socks on.  But with great effort and hard work, I did get them on.  Then I couldn't get them off!  I worked very hard and was just about to call in a neighbor to help me remove them when I found my late husband's old very long shoe horn and used it to push my foot out of the sock.<br />This effort took a great deal of time and maneuvering. I even bought a large/X-large and still had all these problems.  A waste of money for me."
1.0,"It leaks! I'm asian, even though I have a big head, this goggles still leak. I have to stop again and again to let the water go. It's so frustrating."
1.0,Not constructed well at all. Came with loose threads all over the place. Fit kinda snug for a medium considering I bought the large and had to return it because it was too big. Overall just not worth it. Pay more to get a better quality skirt.
1.0,"Useless, cheap and tacky.  The ear cuff is very flimsy, it is plain and breakable.  These ended up in the trash!"
1.0,"Sorry, did NOT like this product. I read reviews and went one size up just in case. Number one, it is just plain UGLY, it was as long as a slip, the arm holes were HUGE, could not adjust. It did have compression and I was ""wrinkle"" free but in all the wrong spots! My original flexees shapewear was nylon and spandex, light weight, light compression, ok for all day wear. Now the intent seems to be, make the person one or two sizes smaller, this requires a diet, not<br />compression that can crack ribs and dislocate organs! Just my opinion."
1.0,This boots have no zipper and they are just straight. I returned them to the seller by mail.
1.0,"Horrible, quality is bad. The butterfly is huge and the overall look is cheap"
1.0,Way to small...order up 2 sizes
1.0,"This dress was too large in the upper bust, sticking out from under the arms even after adjusting the straps. The bodice fit oddly and didn't lay flat. The fabric is too thin and a little see through. The dress was dirty on all of the creases when it came out of the package."
1.0,The waistline is not at the waist.  It was not what I expected. I sent it back.
1.0,Broke in my ear first time wearing and felt cheap-
1.0,I threw it in the trash. It was broken.
1.0,No me agrado .De muy mala calidad
1.0,Bought several for serving costumes and they are as big as a loin cloth. Unable to use and see no option for returns.
1.0,"This is not a functional clock, it does not keep time,also about the size of a nickle. Very cheap."
1.0,the product received was different than what it seemed like it was sending. i had one pair in one size and it couldnt even connect properly without almost breaking
1.0,"Too big, had to return it. Didn't like the way it looked on me."
1.0,The screw that allows the key holder to bend came out on the second  day I used it
1.0,"These are so tightly sewn in other words, they are so snug that you have no room, too tight on the sides of my fingers and I am a petite woman!"
1.0,Very heavy plastic smell...overwhelming. They do not look anything like the add.... totally different. Unfortunate. Disappointed!!
1.0,"Do NOT buy this product. It's a poor quality of fabric. Raw edges, and a waist of money."
1.0,"These are honestly terrible. But it’s true you get what you pay for. The velcro doesn’t last long. The heel placement is so weird, and makes my 4 yr old walk all wonky. You can barley see the colored lights on the heel, they should be white instead of red blue and green. Wouldn’t recommend at all, or buy again."
1.0,"This was the worst fit I've ever experienced.  I am 5'4&#34;, 120 lbs, small B cup.  The bottoms were too tight for me to squeeze into (they might fit a 10 year old) and the top was so big and floppy it was sized more like and XL.  I promptly returned this swimsuit."
1.0,"Very thin, slips off head. I had wanted to give them as thank you to the staff at our vets office but would have been embarrassed to do so."
1.0,No me gustan hilo muy grueso
1.0,Save your money. My daughter wore this a total of 5 minutes and it broke. The actual loop that is supposed to be attached to the locket and hold the chain just broke off.
1.0,"I am trying to put this strap on sunglasses. The edge of the strap on the ends, are sewn along it's edge to form a tube. One end of the strap fits so loose it slides right off the glasses. The other end is IMPOSSIBLE to slide on.  Also the sewn ends are sewn backwards. If the strap were to slide onto the glasses, one end of the sewn part would face down and the other end would face up. I wish I could give a negative star rating, but I'll have to accept giving a single star rating. This strap is a complete waste of your time and money. I am returning it. Shocker."
1.0,"Very cheap, break and fall apart."
1.0,I ordered bc I wear a 22/24 in leggings everywhere. I put these on and the immediately ripped on the waist band. I was like ok whatever I’ll wear a longer shirt to cover that up at least for today. I then get to work and luckily i thought it would be a good idea just in case to wear shorts underneath because the entire right side of the butt area was ripped open. Terrible. Do not recommend.
1.0,The orange T fell off the 2nd time I wore it and it's gone. 😁
1.0,The dress looked nothing like it did online very very very cheap looking
1.0,"These earrings were nothing like the picture.  Bot :stunning&#34; at all. No shine, and very very thin. Back they went. Never even tried themon."
1.0,One was broken when I got it and 2 broke while I was trying to get them in. They're so cheap and my skin broke out. Don't buy these!
1.0,"What I was sent is not onyx,  not multi-colored  and is probably pale blue dyed quartz at best.  I have not the means to send it back ,  it is way not worth $12. , but I sure will complain.  Be wary with these people!"
1.0,Horrible. Not only was it broken but whoever made it didn't finish making it because there were tons of peaces completely missing from it.  They weren't even loose in the packaging just missing so I would not recommend buying this item for anything
1.0,Chain is too weak it broke the first day I wore it.
1.0,It was beautiful and looked like quality BUT it broke approximately 10 minutes after I put it on. The connecting side (not the clasp side) broke slap off from the rest of the anklet. I can’t recommend this anklet.
1.0,Looks like a pair but it's only one anklet
1.0,Not good like the pants. Sent it back
1.0,No muy grande
1.0,Pure garbage.  By the time I was asked to write this review the watch had already been in the trash for days.  One piece came off and that triggered the rest of the pieces.  Obviously. It was put together by wishful thinking..  I can't por a zero I supposed because it's not worth 1 star. A kids play watch is stronger.
1.0,"Took forever to receive, the length is waist length not as shown, pj material, description of contents on package stated &#34;Underwear&#34;. Will wear as lingerie since it's not acceptable to wear out of household. Only positive thing is the price."
1.0,Not at all happy! I rushed my order because my birthday is tomorrow. Not only did I pay extra for shipping the earrings have some type of malfunction going on. They are stuck in one weird position. I brought 2 pair from another company and definitely not what I expected. The earrings are definitely smaller and really thin is probably why they don’t dangle as well. I’m very disappointed
1.0,"I have a watch collection of about 30 watches. When I saw the black and silver band, I knew it would be perfect for the watch in the photo. It looks like the watch come like that, matching so perfectly. But it actually came with a bland silver band. See photos.<br /><br />EDIT: The locking mechanism broke after two months. :|  1 star."
1.0,This bracelet broke after wearing it once. It’s so thin! It also looked different from the pictures … please give me my money back and stop selling junk.
1.0,I love the energy of the beads. But the string is weak. It tore way too soon. I am very disappointed in that.
1.0,It fell apart after my daughter tried it on
1.0,Ew. This was just ew.
1.0,It looks super cute but otherwise useless product. The strap is very stiff and itchy. Also it keeps popping off metal frame. Will be returning
1.0,"Terrible. They do run small so I did order larger but these are just terrible. Cheap, bad material and not flattering at all. Unless you have a flat stomach and skinny legs, they just don't work."
1.0,When we received the package the suspenders weren't in the box/bag.
1.0,"Not sure if we received the wrong size, but it was way too small. Ordered size 5-6 year, and what I received was equivalent to size 2T. Will have to return."
1.0,This skirt was nothing like the picture. The elastic was all messed up. The pattern on the sides didn’t meet up nicely.  Looked horrible.<br />Wouldn’t recommend to anyone!<br />Also I got a L it fit like a XXL
1.0,Poor quality!!!!
1.0,"Neck collar was wrinkle and did not fit properly.  I purchased a different color shirt of the same material.  That shirt fit fine, but, the white shirt did not."
1.0,"Too small, must be a child's size."
1.0,"You know that saying . you get what you pay for. if I could give it a zero star, I would"
1.0,This poor quality lens can damage your vision
1.0,Tooo small.  This should be a set for children not women.  The necklace did not connect as a choker should.
1.0,"This dress is made out of a cheap polyester fabric that looks like party rental table cloths. It is not a beautiful wedding dress fabric.  didn't even try it on, and returned."
1.0,Earrings have turned only wire twice
1.0,I couldn't even try the hat on because it was so crushed
1.0,"Sizes run small, even for women. Does not come with a battery pack and does not indicate that it doesn't."
1.0,The green color is barely green at all.... it’s mostly navy blue (which isn’t even shown in the pic) and the little green that is on the jacket is nothing like the color pictured. Should say blue/green instead of green. Looked at color and didn’t even try it on
1.0,I wanted a black and red dress! This dress is red black white and navy blue. The description and picture states rang the dress is red black and white.
1.0,I bought an XL and it fits my 8 year old who wears size 10 in kids.
1.0,This product didn't even last one trip. The so called discount you get so you only pay $100 is not worth it.
1.0,It was very cheap looking and to big it was returned
1.0,It fit so small I couldn't even get it over my arms. It's a cute shirt if it wasn't made so small.
1.0,Keeps popping off when I bend my wrist. Can't wear it. Looks neat but not functional
1.0,"The product has serious quality issues - the sewing was uneven and with puckers. Unlike other amazon purchased items, I can't just return this. I had to go through an email process with the seller for a refund. They offered to give me 50% off if I just keep them - the pants are so poorly made you couldn't pay me to wear them."
1.0,So incredibly heavy. Returned
1.0,This was broken. The silver piece off. Cost more to return.
1.0,Cheap. Worn out after 14 hours
1.0,I ordered this product and only half of it came. I only got the scarf/bottom part of it and not the hooded part
1.0,"Don’t like the print, feels like rubber"
1.0,"I received an orange/pattern piece. It’s not rose, gold, rosegold and it does NOT have glitter. It’s horrible."
1.0,That’s not even a grammatically correct phrase.
1.0,The item looked nothing like the pic..the color and metal is much darker..very disappointed ☹️
1.0,some stones fell out the very first day
1.0,"It was very beautiful, however the whole dress is completely see-through I mean you can see my tattoos under the material clear as day. Maybe if your planning on wearing something under it would be pretty but that see-through isn't my thing"
1.0,The fabric part of the strap separated from the metal clasps that actually attach to the Fitbit
1.0,"This hurts the top of my ear, and it got so tight it made my ear loose circulation Never get this such poor quality"
1.0,Sorry this was not the correct fit at all for me l wish to send it back..color perfect..
1.0,Came Broken ugh!
1.0,The blue are not even close to what is pictured. They're more like an ugly teal. I will be returning them. Hideous.
1.0,"I bought this in wine red, and the pattern is NOT as pictured.  The pattern that arrived is like the blue floral pattern, and it is a lighter red, not wine.  Not at all like pictured, very disappointing."
1.0,It says it's 100% cotton but the package says 55% cotton. >:(<br />The package is very poor.
1.0,I received my sterling silver bracelet but it was broken and it wasnt stamped sterling silver either. I know the price is cheap but still ... dont sell counterfeit products :(
1.0,Falls off your head in every movement. DONT BUY.
1.0,"Don't fit, had to make hole to put my arms in.  The cape kept sliding off my shoulders.  Not flattering at all but the kids love Santa's wife."
1.0,"The 24 month jammies don't fit my 19 month old child, she is on the small side but the jammies are too small for her."
1.0,Very cheap material and poorly out together.  The lace is so crunchy it looks like a hoop is underneath.
1.0,It’s so bulky to Frank it’s unflattering it’s so puffy I haven’t wear it. & it’s very heavy.
1.0,This dress is super pretty but it tore the first time my daughter wore it. We ordered another and it tore everywhere again! Pretty disappointed! 😩
1.0,What size fits who?? Doesn’t fit anyone in this household
1.0,"Purchased in November, already worn through the sole at the toe in February, wearing on weekends only.  Not worth the investment for three months of wear."
1.0,Turned fingers green within 48houra
1.0,The material wasn't up to par
1.0,The socks are to thin and run small.
1.0,Very disappointed. Bought it as a gift but both keychains came oxidized. Item not as pictured!
1.0,Fits well and looks cute. Did not survive 2 washes. Small micro holes after 1 wash and had many more large holes after 2nd wash. No known exposure to chemicals or trauma to shirt.
1.0,Nothing like photo super see through got for my grandmother we had a good laugh way too sexy and see through in the light blue .<br />Did not look anything like picture when tied. I put black where it is see through .

1.0,Made me look like a huge jumbo flag...
1.0,"Dosent work on really cold days well , finger tips are cold!!!! I would not buy again"
1.0,"It looks like water stains are all over the heart.  The bead doesn't hold, it just falls down to the heart.<br />I need to research how to clean it without staining it more.  Just a hot mess."
1.0,"This product was replaced once, it broke on the sides, the part that goes on the ear... well the replacement broke pretty much on the same area"
1.0,Very unhappy with this product bought for my wife for Christmas this morning when she opened her gift shirt was dirty there was something black on the coller and there was a big stain in the front of the jersey this is not cool I order from Amazon all the time and to receive faulty merchandise I amvery dissatisfied now I have to wait till tomorrow and take to the cleaners and see if they can remove stain
1.0,"The goggles are garbage.  Have an unusual side lock to tighten which falls off and breaks immediately.  I thought it was our fault after happened with the first pair, but turns out is just the design (I ordered others since my kids need.)  Waste of money."
1.0,Not real  Compression sox.
1.0,I am so so so disappointed I bought one like this before and it was perfect but it got messed up so I decided to repurchase the same one but the one I received this time is totally different nothing like the picture. I am extremely disappointed
1.0,I opened them out of the package and the top pink pom pom fell right out. I needed these for a theme party today. I don’t think the piece was attached when it was put into packaging. Poorly made.
1.0,"This is so small, it only fits my size 1 niece! If any bigger than that other plus size, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!"
1.0,"Very disdisappointed with material thin shapeless, could use as a handkerchief"

1.0,I had to return this product as id was very very small
1.0,Very bad fabric quality
1.0,SSSSSUUUUUPPPPPEEEEEERRRRRR JJJJJUUUUNNNNKKKKK! BAND BROKE FIRST DAY!!!!!!!!
1.0,"Runs so small, a lot smaller than anything else I have ordered. I ordered a 2xl and fits like a large"
1.0,I can’t believe I missed all of these reviews for this mask! Had I seen them I would NOT have purchased this item. They have a huge gap in the sides and do don’t cover your face like they are supposed to. They don’t have a flap and are a complete waste of money! Please buy something else!
1.0,"not what I had expected, would love a refund"
1.0,"Itchy material, not sparkly like the photo. Top is too small for my breasts, no stretch at all."
1.0,Stopped winding after a couple months
1.0,Very cheaply made and not a good fit.
1.0,Super cute socks. Love the silicone grip around the heel. I’ve had this pair on for 30 minutes and it’s already coming loose. Luckily I can sew. Don’t like having to repair brand new clothes though
1.0,I can everything through the outfit. It fits only a tiny bit small.  Not small enough to be able to see my skin. Almost completely sheer.
1.0,"Third time we used this product, the strap broke at place it is bolted to side of bag. The bag wasn't even heavy.  Don't waste your money."
1.0,"It is extremely short. It fits, but it is not a dress. It fits as a shirt."
1.0,Does. Not not work!
1.0,"Screen printing is very blury. I bought the freddy mask, cant even tell its him. And the mask itself is very large. Even Too big for an adult male."
1.0,Very narrow & the straps are tight
1.0,"Not impressed with product at all, however the extras were okay."
1.0,This product is garbage they claim it is stainless steel but I had it in my ear three days and I had to take it out because the sea turtle was tarnishing and I was highly allergic to the metal quality I almost lost my piercing because of it
1.0,"Nor sure if the company decided to cut corners due to the lightening deal, but definitely had to high expectations set on this garment. The supposed “sweatshirt” is thin as paper and you might as well be outside naked as a newborn. The seams do not line-up as they should and the finished off edges which are supposed to help the garment maintain itself have definitely been rushed and have strands hanging in multiple places. Luckily for myself i can go it and re-do the seems and whatnot properly. The product pictures definitely portray an item of more quality and attention to detail…NOT what I received."
1.0,"Unfortunately I received one shoe in a size 6 and the other was 6.5--I ordered a 7.5!  They were only slightly tight but I decided they wouldn't work so they went back.  Quality was poor, cork looked cheap, poor construction.  I will not be getting an exchange.  I have other Madeline shoes that are great, these just weren't."
1.0,Did not git my  hat pins
1.0,Way too small and I'm I a size 6!  Order up ladies not good quality as I see it! My grand daughter is 12 and it fits her!
1.0,The pin clasp on the back doesn’t stay on.
1.0,i have to always remember... ya get what ya pay for...... its tiny and clingy.... I wear a size M-L and ordered the XL. it fits me like a Small...
1.0,Item and description not the same
1.0,This dress is nothing like the picture it is dull. Poorly made. No pockets. And took 1 month to arrive.
1.0,These boots were TERRIBLE. They fit fine very cute  HOWEVER  the smell is so bad I can not wear them.  They have been sitting outside since I got them.  I will never wear them.!!!
1.0,Wasn't what I expected to get. Totally different than what was pictured. I returned them and never got my money back!
1.0,"I didn't look closely at the picture of this particular size (since each size had a different picture and I chose a different size at the last minute).  But, they do not function to replace backpack buckles.  They only have one slot and therefore are not adjustable and would not function at all unless you sewed them into place or provided some sort of secure closure.  This is partially my fault (although confusing since each of the size choices is a different style), but also, what could these possibly be used for??  I'm sure it's my ignorance, but since the description was just what I was looking for, but the product was useless for replacing a backpack/bag buckle, I am sure it could happen to others."
1.0,Too small and I always get a large these pants are not true to size and the do not stretch I gave them to my 16 year old daughter
1.0,It was virtually impossible to attach to the watch
1.0,Cheap plastic not rose gold more like hot pink it sucked
1.0,This shoes are extremely cheaply made. Not recommended for older kids playing sports.
1.0,"Before I start this review please know that this item was given to me for free so I can give an honest, unbiased review.<br /><br />I was actually excited about this item when I found out about it.  For a few years now I've been thinking about getting a Therapy Bracelet for myself as I like to work out and I am interested in generally keeping healthy.  I wasn't sure what to expect so when I was chosen to review a Magnetic Therapy Bracelet I jumped at the opportunity.  It didn't really live up to whatever inkling of an expectation I had.  First, the company that sells this says that it is for both men and women.  Now I am a guy.  A 225 pound guy but I have some dainty wrists (a weird byproduct of losing 140 pounds).  They are pretty slim for a guy and this thing is sadly, NOT for men.  It barely fit around my wrist and needed to be bent just slightly to accommodate.  However, bending the bracelet proved to be unwise as now it was slightly uneven and lopsided on my wrist.  I finally got it on to where it fit &#34;okay&#34; and proceeded about my day.  Now here is where things get weird because I am not sure if this was psychosomatic or an actual byproduct of the bracelet being on my wrist.  I felt nothing after I put it on.  It could have been a rubber band for all the good it did me.  I kept it on until my wrist started feeling weird; like heavy and uncomfortable.  I had to take it off, I didn't like it.  It lasted on my wrist for about 4 hours.<br /><br />Honestly, I really wasn't all that impressed with it.  Which is a shame because I really wanted to like it."
1.0,Belt started to crack after a few months of use. I normally keep belt several years. This one will not last longer than a year.
1.0,Wore for the first time today the tore up while I was wearing them . The waist band come apart also the upper leg in thigh area disconnected from diamond pattern came apart a real mess. Don't waste your money on product. Wouldn't recommend you purchase. Java Ellis
1.0,So fake looking
1.0,"Like always, I ordered two sizes because I never know what size I really wear with Amazon clothes sellers unless its a known brand. I ordered the small and medium and they both fit terribly (I'm 5'4"", 145 lbs). The top half was way too big and the cut was weird on both of them and I have an average size bust (34 B-C cup). I felt like the top might work for someone with a large bust. The bottom half was also weird at the waist and was not flattering at all."
1.0,Very thin. Smaller than expected. I wear a medium ordered 1x still a little shorter than I thought
1.0,Wasn’t as the picture showed. The shirt is wide.
1.0,"I wanted a PG I could wear to walk my dog in my neighborhood without it looking too much like a pajama, I wore it to bed last night and the bottom and top fitted right but this morning as I was walking my dog, the sleeves were hanging over my hands and I checked the tag and wrong size.<br />All I want is a jacket the proper size!"
1.0,"Set up and used once.  Next time the string was broke and unable to open,  Looks to be very poorly engineered."
1.0,Fabric cheep and doesn't look like the picture.
1.0,"i Really really like this watch, however, the inside of the glass is dirty so no matter how well I clean it, it looks a little cloudy. you can see some of the spots in the picture below"
1.0,"I am 4'11"" and this dress was toi short."
1.0,"About 2x not 5x. And the print on the shirt is not professionally done, definitely not worth the price or the wait. Sorry not sorry."
1.0,Sweater runs much too large.  Quality is very poor.
1.0,Doesn't light up as stated
1.0,Didn’t like it I really want a refund it look like it’s more for the nose the damn bar hurts. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,Things lame the back of the neck is really the only spot that gets hot on the thing. Don’t waste your money on this one. Maybe I got a busted one. Not impressed
1.0,"I wore the bracelet three times and the beads at the bottom of the wrist have worn and changed colors. One of the elastic strings torn and I had to change bands so it would not break. Very disappointed I really liked the colors, ease of wearing, and style. Will return"
1.0,I ordered a size 16 it wouldn't even go past my thighs so it was probably more like a size 12. The dress did look somewhat well-made but upon return I never received my refund and had to pay for shipping
1.0,"Believe the reviews that say it is difficult to peel the backing to get to the adhesive.  For me, it is impossible. I have now shredded the foam, cut small pieces to try and find something to pull, and still have backing that I cannot remove.  It does size the hat.  If left on, the backing would seem to not let the hat band breathe properly.  Buy something else.  It has to be better and less frustrating."
1.0,I received this item with alot of scratches
1.0,"I'm a size 12 and ordered a X-large, had to return it and get an xx-large."
1.0,"This dress was way to small, the color and material was cheap... Not happy about this at all"
1.0,Many of the sunglasses broke soon after opening :(
1.0,This shirt was way too small and I even ordered up a size. I am so upset and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
1.0,These pants are pretty thin and they tend to stretch out.
1.0,I thought this hood was going to be fun. Once on and your nose and mouth are lined up with the tine holes you can breath but the hood fills up with air as you breath so it looks like a frogs throat inflating.<br /><br />If there were nose tubes inside the hood and a mouth tube to help with breathing it would make it a hood worth buying.<br /><br />I regret buying this hood.
1.0,I appreciate the craftsmanship on this mask but you have to be able to breathe to sing.  I was super hot and found it hard to breathe.  I was better off with a paper mask.
1.0,"Guess I should have expected that. Was expecting a swing fit, like the photo. Instead it was skin tight around my hips, and very unflattering, very thin, feels like cheap, sweaty material. I bought a large. I am returning it."
1.0,Very bad material .<br />This is totally different what is showing in image
1.0,I was excited with this product until I received it. the material on the side is awful!!!
1.0,Absolute waste of money. Not only was it a waste of money the directions were wrong I have a ton of holes in my wall now and it’s the most flimsy piece of crap ever. Look elsewhere I saw plenty of options online.
1.0,"Very slow shipping. Even with the $30 upgrade for shipping it was a week late. Dress was plenty large but the sleeves were tight, and the bodice was like a corset. The dress was very heavy and uncomfortable.  Never worn, except to try it on, and unavailable for return. This $85 mistake is going to the thrift shop."
1.0,Looked / worked fine at first but after a couple weeks it came apart and my keys went flying everywhere. I managed to put it back together and it worked fine for a while longer. Then it came apart again and I had to spend 5 minutes searching for my keys under my car in a parking lot. I couldn't find the little screw to put it together after that and now its worthless. Not worth the money and risk of losing your keys.
1.0,To big and we’re broke
1.0,Copper wore off and discolored my skin in less than 2 weeks
1.0,[[VIDEOID:1e609355f6b30f97718d153b572d09b5]]
1.0,This is not for a adult head&my head is small i have a long face.it is tight&uncomfortable on a adult&will cause headache
1.0,Wasn’t for me but it’s a good  material
1.0,"Haven't ordered this ... but just looking at photo of the product ... not a pitbull, more like a retreiver."
1.0,Dress too small.
1.0,Broke while trying to put it on. NOOOOOOOO!
1.0,"Unfortunately I will have no use for these. If I put them on around my ears like the picture, the masks covers my entire face. I simply can’t figure out a way to put this on that works."
1.0,A little too crop for this old mom.
1.0,"This dress stinks so badly that when I tried to wash the awful b.o/chemical smell out it absolutely RUINED the entire load of laundry and still smells. It has actually smelled up my entire house and I had to shower after trying it on. It's horriblez also, I ordered an xl after reading the comments (I normally wear a large) and it's still snug. It's also the cheapest, scratchiest fabric imaginable. Don't waste your money on this one."
1.0,Not as advertised. Earrings are not huggies. Received different cheaper ones not the ones advertised.
1.0,"It isn't chocolate like the one on the pic, i feel misled 👎"
1.0,you cannot see the time on watch unless you put directly under a light have to return to amazon very disappointed
1.0,Material was very flimsy..more like sleep wear..
1.0,was not a charm as described.
1.0,what a piece of overpriced junk! I Expected leather with some heft to it for about 5 bucks but this is so thin I could tear it with my hands. All moot as I am stuck with it now.
1.0,Mala calidad no volvería a comprarlo
1.0,"Poor quality, my husband only wore once and they are falling apart."
1.0,"very disappointed.  kit and contents are miniature size,  like for a dollhouse or something.  Expected way more for the price!!  And it is not returnable."
1.0,Disappointed in the sizing.
1.0,"Strap broke on second use.  Luckily I had a firm grip on my camera otherwise I would have lost it.  The stitching on this is crappy, that's where my strap  broke."
1.0,It’s cute but it’s very small
1.0,Fell apart after 1 month. Only wore the watch about once a week. Very disappointed
1.0,I bought this as a present of a three year old.  I ended up returning it.  The ribbons are just present wrapping ribbon and the gold middle part was just a sparking pipe cleaner.  There wasn't even a piece at the bottom holding the pipe cleaner in.  There was a plastic zip cord attaching the Aurora face to the wand.  At first I thought it was the cord attaching the wand to the packaging but nope it was holding the plastic face piece on.  There was a big piece of plastic on the back where the plastic cord zipped in place.  I felt like the plastic zip cord could be a safety hazard since it stuck out past the wand and was a bit rough!  I realize that this was cheap but it wasn't worth the cheap price I payed for it!
1.0,"Returning them. Too small. No give whatsoever. Color was off, not khaki."
1.0,"At first it seemed like a great watch for the price everything seemed good, but I’ll say that if you plan to wear this watch while doing more than sitting at a dinner table then I’d reconsider buying it. I’ve been wearing it about a week, while working and other things so I may have been a little rough on it but no more than a watch should be able to handle. The band is connected to the watch with very cheap pieces of metal that snap out under slight pressure, I’ve had them pop out when simply bending my wrist while the watch was apparently in a bad position, and just now it popped out and it’s lost, so there’s that, also the onion knob came out and won’t go back in, even before it came fully out it started to fail to wind up here and there. Pretty disappointed overall, not a very durable watch, just for display I suppose"
1.0,My son loved the bag but it fell apart within 5 minutes of putting it on.
1.0,Don’t buy this dress it’s really bad and the buttons are so cheap the whole thing is so cheap... you get what you pay for
1.0,It doesn’t get you warm. Don’t buy this.
1.0,"The shoes smell horrible, strong chemical smell, and aren’t remotely comfortable.  Nope."
1.0,"Where do I start to begin with all the problems of this product. First of all the dress was way too large.  Although the material appears to look like it is thicker material,  it's paper thin. And because it has long sleeves,  it works out for very few months of the year where I live.  Also,  it smelled horribly of chemicals.<br />It's important to note that this product took forever to get to my doorstep,  and was way past the month and a half deadline to arrive.  14 dollars plus shipping! Really??? Next time I will just head to Target and get two outfits for this amount.  Save yourself a headache and pass."
1.0,"So  I would like to say that this is the first review Ive ever posted on Amazon but I just couldnt stomach the the high average rating and the lack of poor reviews for this product. Ill go ahead and start with the positives. The band was in a nice looking package and it was easy to install to the apple watch. Thats it for the positives. So first off this is not genuine leather. Not even close. Its got a very rubbery plastic feel. Definitely a very synthetic leather. Secondly the ""metal"" strap connections are also not even close to being actual metal. They are about as plastic as you can get. The feeling when you attach the strap to the watch just feels gross. Given that this is faux leather and has plastic attachments I just cant imagine it being very durable. The comfort is also awful. I only wore it for about an hour and had to take it off because all the plastic on your wrist is very uncomfortable. I understand that this is a relatively cheap item so expecting real genuine leather and metal was probably unrealistic at this price point. But that is what the description said so I figured Id give it a shot. It will be my quickest return ever. This just feels like something youd get at the dollar store. Ive seen bands purchased off AliExpress that are better quality than this. Please save your time and money and look elsewhere."
1.0,Where is the label? I bought this shirt in whY should have brand new condition.
1.0,It really sucks.  Does not fit at all
1.0,I also expected there to be more than one charm. I definitely would not have paid that much for 1.
1.0,Color doesn't match photo.  Is a gross yellow color.  Material is similar to what they make kites or those cheap plastic like table cloths out of.  Is really strange.  Glad I only paid $8 for this.  Went straight to Goodwill.
1.0,I guess I should have read the reviews before purchasing this stuff. It's made of thin flimsy polyurethane sponge.
1.0,"too wide in the nose, doesn’t look like real septum ring at all. It looks really weird."
1.0,"The sizing is not in American sizes, so the product was several sizes too small."
1.0,These pants were huge!! The size chart was completely off. Had to return the small and the medium that I ordered because neither even almost fit.
1.0,"Shoe rubber is basically some sort of slick foam with no grip, shoe has no shape and comes squashed flat, and Velcro strip is thin cheap fabric material that looks like it will rip in a few weeks."
1.0,They are very nice sandals but they are heavy on your feet when you walk and it feels like you have weights on your feet...I totally wish I never got them..
1.0,The pants fit like high waters. Not quite short enough to pass as gauchos. I am 5’4 so I’m guessing it’s for the extremely short. I also washed them once and noticed a hole in the crotch of the pants. By the time I received the pants I literally forgot I had ordered them because it took so long to get to me.
1.0,It is made from a material That would have made a leisure suit in the 70's. Just awful.
1.0,The balls weren't threaded very deep into the bar and came unscrewed daily.
1.0,The material was thin and cheap and the suit does not fit like it should. The breast area is extremely small while other areas are baggy.
1.0,Omg does not even looks like the pics
1.0,"I ordered a size large even though I normally wear a medium because I wanted to make sure they fit comfortably, but they are incredibly tight through the thigh and loose below the knee. I have had this same problem several other times purchasing this brand - but my very favorite leggings that fit perfectly came from them so I keep trying. At one point I purchased two of the same size and the same style and you could visibly see the difference in size between them. I think at this point I will stop trying and move on to a different brand."
1.0,The product arrive broken and don't give a choice to return
1.0,What a waste of money....complete disaster!!!!
1.0,Waste of money! First off it took me 2 hours to install this watch band on my watch! Secondly it was huge on my wrist. Lastly it didn’t even last 2 days before it broke. Don’t waste your time or money!
1.0,"I'm SO disappointed with this shirt!  Yes, it fits perfectly, and the material is so soft and comfortable. However, the first one I ordered arrived with stains on the front. Large, obvious spots. I requested a replacement.  You can't imagine my disappointment when the second one had the same stains; only on the back of the shirt this time!  At that point, I requested a refund.  The one I ordered was blue. There was obviously something wrong with the material they made the shirts with, but it wasn't caught by the manufacturer.  Or...they just didn't care.  You might have better luck with a different color."
1.0,Although the item did fit it looked like something that you would get in a costume bag. Super thin material not lined at all and an awful smell radiated from the material. Definitely sending back.
1.0,"After you wear it once you have to give to the cleaner,Not For Me. I’m Returning it,<br />Returning it,What do I have to do to return it,Do I need a return slip,"
1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS REPLACEMENT BAND! Replaced band on Garmin X10. GPS does not work. Called Garmin and have been informed that GPS antennae is located in the band. Old band was discarded and now the X10 is inoperable.
1.0,Description says 12  and yet you only get 1.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,"I agree they are pretty, but the quality is poor.  They broke the first time I tried to wear.  you get what you pay for!"
1.0,Very very tiny charm and weak chain
1.0,"I ordered a large , they looked like an extra small"
1.0,I did not order or receive this item. Would like money returned to my card
1.0,Save your money - these are junk
1.0,"The pants fell apart after one wash, poorly sown together"
1.0,This dress was way too tight at the chest. I am a 34DDD and bought an XL. The rest of the dress fit well. It just pulled across the bust. I would avoid if you're busty.
1.0,Second day I wore these jeans the material split from the crotch to the knee as I was getting into my car. Material is very light weigh.
1.0,"Es horrible la tela es muy aspera, aparte de que no corren pequeños los size como dice la descripción, cometí un grave error al pedirlo midion es una perdida de tiempo"
1.0,"Purchased this quartz keychain less than three months ago, and just realized today the quartz crystal is missing! The silver chain remains, but the crystal fell off and is nowhere to be found. Very disappointed, poor quality.... would not recommend."
1.0,I purchased a 2x. The skirt was thin. No stretch or elastic band. I could not zip up the skirt. Was not as long as I had hoped. Fell and flowed right above my ankles. It was a last minute buy for an event... I had to pin the skirt to make it work. Maybe I'll get it tailored into something different.
1.0,It serves the purpose but everyone comments that it’s Too bulky and the color is horrible.<br />Get it in black and not green.<br />Make sure you get screen protection.
1.0,Umbrella was broken
1.0,Not sure exactly how these are supposed to be stainless steel because they began to tarnish.
1.0,"I thought this blouse looked really cute in the picture,  so I ordered it. Since it was Asian made, I ordered two sizes larger than what I normally wear.  Even with the upsizing, the blouse is still a little tight around the hips. The quality of the shirt is somewhat poor and I will never wear this blouse. Very disappointed."
1.0,I love the dress but it didn’t come with the belt!! :( :( :( .  I don’t see how I can wear it without the belt especially since I sized up from the reviews...really disappointed
1.0,Bottom area broke within two weeks of wearing it.
1.0,Xxl is about the size of a large.
1.0,What I received does not match the the product pictured.
1.0,Clasp was defective.  Tried to return but missed window.
1.0,I read reviews and saw this bra had decent reviews however I was extremely disappointed. I ordered an XS as I have smaller boobs and I prefer my strapless bras to be tighter so they don’t slide so I even size down on strapless bras. This bra was extremely big and very awkward fitting. It was uncomfortable and very stiff and again just really awkward fitting. Really wish I didn’t buy
1.0,The quality is bad and the design on the back and front look like a sticker placed onto the zip up sooo buy something eles itsnot worth your money.
1.0,"I didn't like it, I like for my long dresses to touch the ground and this dress came to my lower calf.  I'm only 5'7.  I didn't think I was that tall but this dress made me feel other wise.... Yes, I did return for my money back."
1.0,Material is very thin and the front top part is made weird with the rouging areas. I did not care for the design
1.0,Not a fan...look cheap
1.0,"Aside from being too long, i think the fit is small. I didn’t end up using this dress because it also is see through."
1.0,Nunca me llegó
1.0,The fabric is so thin that it’s see-through. I love the pattern though so I bought a long slip and hope that it works.
1.0,Don’t buy if you aren’t a tiny human.
1.0,way too big looked nothing like pic
1.0,"See through, extremely thin and boxy. I never wore this."
1.0,They fit awful and they are an awful material. I would not recommend these at all.
1.0,I ordered the above item and was sent a charm with one white cat and one black cat. The fact that this type of error can occur despite ordering from a website speaks to the vendor's inventory control process.<br /><br />I would not recommend ordering this product unless you could be guaranteed to receive the correct item.
1.0,The silver plating was already peeled off upon opening the package.
1.0,Wore one day and my wrist swelled and turned red from whatever is in the plastic!!
1.0,All the seller has to do was keep her real belt  is far from leather and it’s more like plastic
1.0,I’ve had this purse for about one month and it’s already coming apart.  Strings are unraveling and the crossbody strap has broke.  Very poor quality
1.0,Wish I could leave no stars. Ordered an extra large and it didn't even fit my sister who is a size medium.
1.0,"Although smallest size, it's way too baggy for me. The color is way off, it's not the pastel pink you'd think it is. The texture itself is thin as well, I'm returning this."
1.0,"It wasn't cotton. The shirt may  be ok for someone who doesn't mind the synthetic material. I thought it would be a snug fit, but it was just a little looser than I expected. It was MUCH longer than I expected."
1.0,Nothing like the picture! Its a piece of metal clump together!
1.0,"I got a painful sunburn on my scalp from the material. I have a full head of hair. The top of the hot got uncomfortably hot and I had to pinch it off my head so there was no direct contact. A burn developed. Insane. Had I not worn it, I wouldn't have gotten burned."
1.0,It’s very poorly made and have lots of white strands/treads all over it.
1.0,"Ya es la segunda vez que pido este vestido, la primera lo pedí de mi talla pero me quedo muy pequeño,  ese se lo regalé a una amiga! quedó muy contenta porque la tela es de muy buena calidad, bueno está mono, así es que como me encantó lo pedí de nuevo, esta vez de la talla más grande y entonces me envían una aún más pequeña... Decepcionada., Ya desistí 😳, me sale muy costoso devolverlo, así que me lo pondré en el dedo meñique."
1.0,This is definitely not a blazer.  The material is more of a stretch fabric more fitted to be a shirt not a blazer.  It does run small so size up.  Very flimsy.  More like a cape for a super hero not a blazer.
1.0,My husband saw no difference
1.0,Very poor quality. Item lasted 2 months before it started falling apart at the seams. Was being used as a light gym bag.
1.0,It is not possible to see in the photograph but this bag has the word Florida written across the bottom of the picture. The bags also arrived folded in half so they were not presentable as gifts.
1.0,They say that is .925 but it is not they turned colors the very 1time I used them and the silver color one they came in for the same ear
1.0,It fell apart after using it for only a month. Now it’s too late to return it. Bummer
1.0,Not pleased with the product I would have to stretch my ear larger than I want just to get one plug in they aren't as giving as you would think.I'm not pleased with my purchase and I would at least like my full refund of the product. The lip on the outsides is like a 4g it's double the gauge I have already an I have to stay at the gauge for work policies.thank you I'm not recommending anyone else to purchase this product.
1.0,"If you are looking for a shirt that goes below your belt line, keep looking! This shirt is WAY too short! The bottom goes to my belt line. If I raise my arms my belly is exposed. I would have preferred it to at least cover half of my butt. Cute shirt but too short. I guess this would be better for younger thinner women."
1.0,Had to return it.  The fabric was scratchy and smelled like plastic.
1.0,Watch band rusted in all metal areas after about 3 months. Seller would not honor warranty because I contacted him too late. Poor customer service from Yeago. Buyer beware and be ready for rust to occur if you sweat with your watch band.
1.0,So nice but didn't fit😕
1.0,Going to return. Ordered an XL. It runs VERY small. I have another that's a pull over...same size and it fits. I would say it looks like a medium. Love these things but be careful on sizing.
1.0,The reviews were not helpful at all. I got tired of purchasing over and over to get the right fit. Returned and received Amazon credit.
1.0,I ORDERED A SMALL AND IT FITS LIKE A MEDIUM
1.0,I was very disappointed to learn how small these were when I got them. They came all the way from China just to go in the garbage! A child could wear the XL size.
1.0,"I liked the concept and appearance, but it didn’t last a day."
1.0,I ordered it because people said it ran small but I ordered the smallest size and it was still huge
1.0,This looked terrible. Can't believe Ugg made this.
1.0,"Runs Small<br />My normal shirt size is a xs/s. When I want to layer for winter, I usually go with a size large which is plenty big on me; creating a nice pocket of warmth. I ordered this sweatshirt in a large. I wish I went with an XL. It is roomy & very very warm which is great, but itw not as long as I'd hoped. I can just pull it down to right under my butt. When I sit, I cannot pull it down over my hips & thighs. My upper body is snug as a bug in a rug, but my hips & thighs are chilled.<br /><br />I am a petite 5'2"" Irish lass who lives in a tiny historic log cabin (think Abe Lincoln) with only a wood stove for heat. Warm winter clothing is a necessity for my lifestyle. While my husband doesn't like my bum covered in winter, I do. If this was just a little looser & longer, it would have been a perfect addition to my large winter sweaters. This doesn't mean I wont use it. I happen to be wearing it right now & yep, my legs are cold, but the rest of me is snuggley.<br /><br />Cancer Chemicals<br />After wearing it, I looked for the washing tag & under that tag is a tag that says, ""Warning this product can expose you to chemicals including lead and cadmium which are known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects, and other reproductive harm."" (I've included a photo of the tag).<br /><br />I googled this wondering what on earth could be in a cotton/polyester sweatshirt that could be dangerous. It appears that the most common culprit for this warning in clothing is thanks to the dyes used. Seriously WTF? Manufactures can't choose non toxic dyes!?! So what about when this is washed? What does that do to the environment? Or how about, making it clear on the product page that this article of clothing has this warning label so folks can decide if they want to buy it or not? Ordering it & not knowing, wearing it, then seeing that tag is just wrong. I know some people thing the P65 warning is nonsense. I've learned enough over the years, that it concerns me. If it doesn't bother you, that's your right. Me, I'd rather know up front, so I can avoid such clothing."
1.0,"I bought these clips to secure my jeans over boots. I got about 4-5 wears out of each before the springs went loose and would no longer hold their shape, making them useless. They're very cheaply made. Do not recommend."
1.0,This product is horrible and does not line up or work.<br /><br />I know it doesn’t work because I change bands all the time with no issues so I am an advanced user.<br /><br />I tried to attach these for 2 hours. I finally gave up and put the original bands on in 5 seconds flat. Why because they are molded correctly and fit.
1.0,This suit fits like a child’s suit. I misplaced it and forgot to return it. Money wasted.
1.0,Piece of crap would fit a child
1.0,Never received the order
1.0,I have ordered before and do not like these at all. The sizing is different and they fit like an xlarge. On t he inside where the crotch is it looks like they tried to put a patch in or something. These will definitely go in file 13.  And to think how much I love the other 2 pair I ordered.
1.0,I ordered the one with bright colors and got brown ones. Sad.  I don't wear brown.
1.0,I can't even fold this in small enough to make it even look like a hoop! I don't know if mine is just pierced up to high or what but this doesn't work at all for me.
1.0,the pin is too weak
1.0,"Absolutely horrible material, as soon as I pulled it out of the package I knew I would never wear it in a million years...but you get what you pay for, so I will probably eventually cut it up and use it for some sort of cleaning cloths."
1.0,earrings are too heavy falls to one side looks crazy on my ears
1.0,I'm disappointed in this manufacturer. Why aren't there women's sizes? we are up to no good as well. Let women be kids again.
1.0,Wish it came in bigger sizes
1.0,Received purse and outside pocket missing piece to be able to zip closed purse also has horrible smell not a new purse smell
1.0,"I forgot I had these and they tarnished - badly - I decided to clean them with silver cleaner - paste. The end result is they looked really dull. It looks like it may have had a very thin coat of silver plate that came off after the first cleaning. That is also why they tarnished so much. I had them in the regular packaging. Never worn. Silver plate tarnishes far more than sterling. The wires may be sterling, but the dangling part definitely is not. I find that very MISLEADING and the item extremely overpriced!"
1.0,"I ordered the XL since I am a 40 D the band was too tight. The inserts in the bra to cover your breast  from  showing through  lace was lie a very small,flat shoulder pad. Straps difficult to adjust. Don't  recommend."
1.0,Never received this t-shirt! Twice I recieved an ugly red sox hoodie with butterflies on it. I returned it the first time and said I didn't receive what i ordered and then the second time I got the same wrong item. I gave up and just got my money back.
1.0,"key chain for dog collar does not stay on, comes off without the dog even moving.  very disappointed"
1.0,If I could give it 0 stars I would
1.0,The description said the item ran small so I sized up.  It was still too small.
1.0,They were to tight in the leg and they are no way over the knee tbey hut below the knee
1.0,Very pretty colors but TOO small.  I ordered a large and they look like a small.  Didn’t even bother to try them on because it was obvious they were too small just holding them up.
1.0,Cheap a horrid flimsy mess
1.0,These are NOT Gay Pride bracelets....They don't have ALL of the rainbow colors in ANY of them....Rip off!!!!!!
1.0,They broke when I went to put them on. Really disappointed because they are so cute. It was not worth my time to do a return.
1.0,"This was horrible. If you like a baggy, boxy piece of fabric this is for you. I immediately returned. Clothes on Amazon are always such a hit and miss."
1.0,I have bought what you might call a bunch of Dassari Straps.<br />This one went out of the quality contro line. The sides of the band peel off about the first day<br />Of use. Big Strike with this one.
1.0,USA SIZING CHART APPARENTLY NOT BEING USED WHEN MAKING THIS PRODUCT....THIS WILL FIT A SMALL TEENAGER...
1.0,it is to  large
1.0,These are cute but they didnt come with backs
1.0,Had to return since the clasp was broken. The bracelet fell off my wrist twice and I almost lost it with the all my charms.
1.0,Comfortable material but they all shrank in the wash and are now not long enough to tuck in.
1.0,"The neckline wasn’t sewn properly, very obvious since it’s right in front. Also I wear xl or xxl normally. The xl was swimming on me."
1.0,Watch looked nice and made a great gift. Unfortunately the watch stoppped keeping time and unable to wind after 1 month.
1.0,"I was not expecting what I received. It says sterling silver, but looks & feels like tin.  It is not even marked sterling silver. I used to sell silver & this is beyond awful! It looks so cheap and came to me in a small manila envelope with writing looking as if it was scrawled by a one year old. Just poor quality from the envelope to the product. The only reason it deserves one star is because the picture is nicely detailed. Too bad it was not done on what is, in my opinion, a piece of junk. If this was hand done by an artist they truly need to take more pride in their work. Details do matter."
1.0,"I could’ve made this hat. The fact I paid for this is upsetting. Trashy looking, barely fits."
1.0,I did not like the neck straps. They are uncomfortable and feel like they are choking my neck.
1.0,"Loved them so much but the nose piece fell off. Think ill just buy another pair though, no other glasses compare to these. Would recommend.\<br /><br />Update:  Purchased again....they fell apart AGAIN only had them for one day.  NEVER again."
1.0,"The shape of the cat-eye glasses are cute. However, I could not see out of them they were so blurry. Defeats the whole purpose of having them. 1 ⭐."
1.0,I ordered these workout leggings... Twice. Once they came in and had marks on the leg where it looked like they had been folded immediately after they were dyed. Second I was hoping for a better quality... But no... Second pair came in with marks also. I'll be returning both pairs and not repurchasing. Disappointed.<br /><br />Update: non-responsive customer service. TERRIBLE. DON'T BUY
1.0,Runs big. A large will be XXL. Medium is L  Small is M. Must pay $6 to return and drop off at UPS. Credit will be of amount paid for product only.
1.0,The stainless steel clasp fell off after wearing for one week. I could not find the clasp to reconnect to the spring pin on the band. I will try to get a replacement from Amazon.
1.0,I don't care to wear masks and I am not excited to have you but one like some of these people are . I'm tired of these things. I only bought it because I had to for work.
1.0,"initial impression: beautiful watch, it looks expensive for the price.  very elegant looking.  Ordered last weekend and received it today, Friday.  Will update once I have worn it longer.<br />29March2016:  it is now very erratic.  I have not worn it continuously, I have used it three times and only during working hours, so I expected to give it a gentle shake to get it going overtime i put it on.  Yesterday when I wore it for the third time, it became erratic and no longer hold charge.  I guess it is too good to be true to get a beautiful watch this cheap.  I am now changing my rating to a star (Zero if available). this is not worth the money. I do not recommend it to anyone."
1.0,Looks like a doctor's gown.
1.0,Way too small!! Gave it to my daughter who weighs 135 pounds..material was very thin. No stretch to it and the cuffs looked dirty.
1.0,"broke day one, they sent me a replacement which also broke after a month or so.  Sad, because it is pretty!"
1.0,These are adult sized masks
1.0,Material was cheap and size was way too small
1.0,Thin and runs small
1.0,product very cheaply made. necklace is plastic. arrived broken.
1.0,"Makes mask wearing too uncomfortable .  Tiny clips  aren’t big enough for mask.  I stitched one to the inside of a mask, which was keeping the bracket in.  It did nothing as far as giving “air space” or making it cool"
1.0,"No give in sleeves, very tight"
1.0,different size- won't fit.
1.0,Too small for my parent!
1.0,Returned. Broke after second use
1.0,"Clamps uneven, chain flimsy, completely unsuable."
1.0,The photo of the dress is way too good to be true. It's a super cheap Halloween costume fabric and the slit is really bizarre. If it was a ribbed Cotten like the photos portray it would have been great
1.0,Very upset- package missing all of the cups
1.0,"Only partial delivery. Never recieved the children's shirt!! Got the Adult shirt and washed it so it would be ready to be worn. I read the tag and washed accordingly. The letters stuck together and when I tried to separate them, I lost half a letter. Would not recommend or buy again..."
1.0,"Wish I could get a refund, their garbage. They don't screw into each other correctly. It's annoying and like all other said the width of it is so small even for small ears. Do not recommend."
1.0,"I feel like they sent me the wrong shirt.. it looks great in the pics or on others,  but.. not for me..<br />Just a very odd shirt, it flares out at the sides, and doesnt ""tuck in"" leaving my entire bra showing on the sides.. I am 5'4"" and 118lbs.. it sat at my belly button..(not flattering)."
1.0,Pearl came off the first time I wore it. Very cheap product.
1.0,"Ribbon isn't attached, is way too short and is rather cheap feeling. The tone it's self is soft but not what I was expecting."
1.0,"They don't really compress and they unravel. The first time I wore one the thread on the hem kept unraveling until there was no hem. And when I washed them, they unrevealed even more."
1.0,This is not a sweatshirt.  It is super thin polyester weave that feels more like paper than fabric.  The embroidered bear does not even look like a bear.  Thankful for Amazon's fantastic return policy!
1.0,The snaps buttons could not close.did not work at all. Didn’t button t jacket couldn’t close jacket.
1.0,Horrible. Only wore for a couple days and one of my ears got infected and the other side turned green. I have bought cheaper earrings that I wore for months and didn't do this. Very cheap and not gold plated at all.
1.0,Not stretchy and too small. Definitely not a regular large. If I had known they were made in China I would know they were too small.
1.0,"This does not work. It cannot work. It is a total fraud aimed at separating you from your hard earned cash. Check out the ideomoter effect and/or Confirmation Bias. Just so you know a frequency can be measured but it can't be captured and put in a bracelet. And even if it could, SO WHAT! The videos they use to convince you are straight from Huckster 101. They were fined in Australia for false and misleading advertising. They have gone bankrupt from lawsuits and bad publicity. Don't be fooled and don't be a fool. Save your dough."
1.0,Too small and I purchased a large.
1.0,This dress was NOT what I expected at all. The quality and the look of the dress was equal to that of a dollar store  dress rack..it was so ridiculous and horrible. It was ugly and over the top with huge cheap looking sequins. Just not anything anyone would wear unless it was a costume. The dress didnt fit either..it was way too big.
1.0,"These earrings backs work exactly as described. You can feel the click lock. Shipped fast, well packaged<br />update: about a month after buying these earring backs one fell off and I lost one of my grandmothers diamond earrings."
1.0,"The name/title listed on the product is very misleading. For one, it does not allow for us to choose any other size. Apparently it is supposed to be newborn size by default. I was really disappointed that it looked big enough for a 6 month old. I was hoping to use this as my baby girl's outfit when I brought her home. Sure, we can tie the bottom of it to whatever size needed, but the sleeves would have been way too long for a newborn. Even if I did save it for when she was a little bigger, she would be too big for me to tie the bottom and limit the movement of her legs and feet. Personally, I don't think this product is worth the purchase. It's a shame because it's so cute. I had to get a refund."
1.0,"Didn't wat to rate but I had to cause it wouldn't let me submit without a rate, TRUST ME ALL 100% PURE CHEAP BABY DOLL $2.00 TEASET PLASTIC."
1.0,"The clothes suck. really bad material the “males” shirt is female buttons are on the wrong side and is tapered in (my husband complained about it). my dress i wear an xl normally and was hoping to get an xxl and they didn’t have the size so they need a bigger size range. The baby clothes run big i got my daughter (99th percentile for both height and weight, 2.5months old) a 0-3 outfit and it was way to big. overall bad choice when choosing a family theme for pictures."
1.0,Very very small. Only  for small  girls😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
1.0,"Very thin material, flimsy buckles re-enforced by cheap velcro. Not near long enough for kilting style. Will probably wear out in no time, was hoping for a nice kilt to exercise in that I could pop in the wash. This won't last."
1.0,This top was about 3 sizes smaller than the label.
1.0,"Jacket doesn't look like picture. Too long, not recommended for anyone shorter than 64in I'd say to get the look in the picture. I am 61.5in and it looked funny on me. The material isn't the best of quality it kind of felt like cheap felt material."
1.0,Poor quality and no response from seller.
1.0,When you thread them together it and if you pull on the diamond part a little it pops off.
1.0,"watch is off 1 hours, now off 4 hours. bought in 3/18. after 2 months of used."
1.0,The product had damages. Waste of $.
1.0,These fit snug at first and then  got so out of shape the first week that I'm sorry I wasted the money. When I sit in my lounger they are constantly falling off. Don't try to lay on the sofa with these. One always seems to fall off. Not a good option for me.
1.0,"Waist too long, pockets way too far down the skirt. Fabric a different color from picture."
1.0,The hat came wrinkle
1.0,This is HORRIBLE product. Very cheap and poorly sewn. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
1.0,I expected to receive the shield with the tinted visor.  The ad clearly shows someone's face behind the shield ... the hat I received is reflective silver.  No one can see your face ... and I imagine it would blind someone looking at you with the sun behind them.  Returned
1.0,"I love the fabric and the sizing was accurate. However, the armholes are cut just so bizarrely.  They're really big, and they stick out in an extremely strange ""point"" to the side that looks so bad.  I ordered the grey top and the black and white double pack.  All three tops are cut exactly the same way.  I tried to alter them myself, just so I could actually stand to wear them, with enough success that I'll use them to sleep in, but no one is going to be subjected to actually seeing me in these tops.  I should have returned them, but lesson learned."
1.0,"They said this fits size 14-18. I'm a size 8 and it barley fits. Plus feathers flew everywhere and are almost all off and I haven't even worn it yet. Plus, it didn't come with a tie! Nothing holds it together. Awful. I'll planning on returning."
1.0,"Not polyester, not able to sublimate on it with they’re directions. Making temp higher melts the fabric. Worst product I ever ordered and received!"
1.0,TERRIBLE! Nothing like the picture at all!
1.0,Cheap material.  Smaller than advertised.
1.0,I tried attaching it to my fit bit and the pins are so small the band pops out of the holes and it won't stay together.
1.0,These are way too big for the nose.
1.0,Sending back due to holes in back.
1.0,"I bought this as part of my husband's birthday presents.  I don't think he likes it - he didn't say that, but he has yet to even try it on or wear it!  I don't know what the patch on the sleeve is for - it looks like Velcro, but it's not - don't know what it is.  Too late now to return it now!"
1.0,Not a true 22g nose stud. It feels more like a 20g.
1.0,"Returned item, was not pleased with fabric, it was screen printed onto knit.  Did not like, it also ran small."
1.0,Extremely small. The pair I received was half the size I ordered. I compared it to my other pants and it was much smaller. It was so small my sister that was 100lbs could not fit in them. I would not recommend
1.0,This was not anywhere close to the size I ordered!  Way to small.
1.0,"Awful...arm holes were exaggerating large! Exposed my breasts. Poor quality, they want me to send back to China! Right! In the trash it goes...not happy. Waste of time and money. (Took forever to receive just to be disappointed)."
1.0,Such a gorgeous piece. Shame it broke after just 3 days of wearing it. Definitely not worth the noney
1.0,I ordered the red wine color in a small for my daughters middle school dance. She is typically a small or medium in women’s. The dress arrived and is way too big and is very very thin. I’m returning the dress and ordering from another company. I do not recommend this dress for anything fancy. More of a light weight summer day dress.
1.0,"It's very dull and looks cheap, which I guess it was."
1.0,These shoes are worthless without the cleat nut that goes inside the shoe.  This is the part of spd shoes... not the cleat kits (since it is a part of the shoe).  THESE SHOES DO NOT INCLUDE CLEAT NUTS.  These shoes are useless.
1.0,Way too big. I've never had an issue with my shoe size. I'm a 6.
1.0,these looked as advertised- the shipping took forever- the big problem is - these are earrings are very heavy- you put them on wires normal size but the bottom part is so heavy you can't leave them in your ears- I tried again a few days later still very uncomfortable for me- I tried to give them to my daughter but she said same thing- nice looking but too heavy to wear comfortable - so wasted money
1.0,Returned. Too big of a stone
1.0,Opened the case and proceeded to open the arms when the frames snapped right near the nose piece.
1.0,"Terrible quality!!!!!! Horrible. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.<br /><br />Strange plasticy fabric with multiple issues:<br />FIRST: material is PRINTED on the surface of the fabric, not woven, so when the sock is being worn, the design is gone and all the white shows where the fabric is stretched, and you know socks are stretched out of their tight flat ""not being worn"" shape when you put them on.<br /><br />Second: the printed pattern is fuzzy, not clear - like they took a low quality image, enlarged it and pri Ted it on fabric.<br /><br />Third: note I keep saying fabric... Because these are not made with sock ""material"" but more like very cheap plasticity sports sweatshirt material."
1.0,Poor quality. Literally a sticker wrapped around metal earrings.
1.0,Pants to tight & pants way to short. I am giving to my mom. She is smaller & shorter than me.
1.0,Received this looks great but it is in gold not silver.<br />Waiting for response from vendor. If cleared up I will give five stars.
1.0,Description say 3 pack. Packaging says 3 pack. I got ONE bra.
1.0,Smelled bad
1.0,Not was able to lock due to deformation of braclet
1.0,1 can was half empty??? what the what??
1.0,They are listed as 20 gauge in the headline.  I purchased them and they are bigger than that.  Looked at the item again and down in the description and they describe 18 gauge.
1.0,"The item was described as ""Pink and Green"" umbrella.  It is actually pink and blue."
1.0,Muy anchos
1.0,"I was so disappointed when this dress arrived.  Sure it was inexpensive, but it is made of the cheapest, crappiest, thinnest material imaginable.  It's an almost sheer polyester and the straps are like thin plastic that looks like cheap, fake leather.  The straps look like they'd probably break the first time you wear this thing.<br />I'm returning it.  Better luck next time."
1.0,Faker than a 17$ bill. NBA emblem guy was short and wide. The name on the front by the Mitchell and  ness sign looked like a 2nd grader sewed it onto a piece of felt
1.0,...and stop playing with amateurs like this company.  They have NO IDEA what they're doing. What a crappie sock.<br />TRU FORM is what you want. Stay away from toeless though in any brand. They'll pinch your foot like crazy
1.0,"I ordered a Large, my usual t-shirt size, but these are more like a very tight Medium or even a Small in fit.  I gave them away to a smaller friend."
1.0,There was a stone out of it when I received it just junk don't waste your money on it
1.0,"Upon opening the package I noticed the soles are separated from the shoe, very poor quality.  The glue is only applied to the center, horrible quality."
1.0,Not good quality material
1.0,Worst made product flower not attached poor sewing
1.0,This mask is straight junk. Made of a legging material. Just get a pair and cut them up. And they are small.
1.0,All the rose gold is gone after less than a week. Disappointing.
1.0,Runs very small. Cute design but America is spelled Amereica on the fabric
1.0,"Ordered pink and gray. Its a white t-shirt basically with orange and grey print. Back doesn't go below waist. Cheap made. The only thing great about this item, was the ability of the photographer!"
1.0,"The top was too big, and the cups too small so the top was folding over, sliding down, meanwhile my breasts were falling out of every side in a very unflattering way. Not proportional at all."
1.0,I loved all the options. I ordered a 2 gauge and they were smaller like maybe a 4 gauge. They kept popping out of my ear.
1.0,Product is defective.  The handle broke after carrying the handbag approximately 6 times and was pass the return date.  I'm stuck with a handbag that is unable to be carried.
1.0,Had to return size Medium fit like a 4T
1.0,Did not like the synthetic material. Immediately returned it.
1.0,My wife likes the dresses but they run small.  We have made requests to exchange these but have not received a response after several requests
1.0,This mask is very thin and offers no protection at all. I could made this better. My kid would have to wear two of these. They're see through. I want ti give them zero stars. Amazon won't even allow me to return them unused
1.0,Very cheap quality and cheap looking. Returned right away
1.0,"Nothing like the picture, same material as sweat pants.<br />You will be greatly disappointed."
1.0,"The material is cheap, it has rips in the seems, kinda see through. I am returning."
1.0,Has an awkward fit.
1.0,"I wish I read the reviews before purchasing this. I'm 5'7, 238lbs, and ordered an XXL. This thing is right and barely touched mid-thigh."
1.0,I had this band for less than a month before replacing it. I bought the Rose/pink band. The color started coming off within a week which gave the band a dirty appearance. I would not recommend.
1.0,"When it arrived, I knew I wanted to return it right away. The material looks and feels very cheap. The bottoms are high rise sitting right under my belly button. Won't be ordering from them again."
1.0,"Really poor quality item. Bought because I saw someone post it on IG so was expecting a bit than what I got. Would say it runs pretty TTS but definitely not an oversized fit. Material is a cheap poly fleece - think the kind of shiny, spongy type. Cuffs & hem are not made from traditional ribbed material but are self (same material as the sweatshirt). Screen printing looks like a super cheap heat transfer print - like something you would get at the local mall custom t-shirt shop. And was printed crooked on mine. Just looks really cheap all around, pretty disappointed with the purchase but not entirely surprised since ordering clothing from Amazon can be a bit of a gamble."
1.0,Product didnt fit at all!
1.0,"The style is absolutely gorgeous and the print looks exactly as it did online.  However, one of the folds on the breast-line was not finished...the edges were frayed and not sown."
1.0,The fabric quality isnt worth the price. It's too cheap
1.0,Didn't stick at the top and sides . It didn't tie like it said it would and I think it would work fine for small busted women. It didn't cover& lift like it said it would. Very disappointed .
1.0,Don't even bother with this. If I could give this product 0 stars I would. The product came broken. It's cheap material. The clasp does not function. I feel like I completely wasted my money by buying this. I would not recommend.
1.0,"This is the worst purchase ever.  I have ordered this shirt twice trying to get the shirt in the picture.  Not sure what the fabric is.  Epic fail.  They need to take the picture down and put an actual picture of the shirt up!  I have never heard of this company, now I know why.  DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1.0,Fabric is very thin .
1.0,The mask are all wrinkled bad quality very thin plastic.
1.0,"Great for the first few days then doesn't seem to stay in position, elastic moves and stretched out fast :("
1.0,You get what you pay for. They do no come in a box but a bag. They were bent when they arrived. Tried to bend them back but never fit correctly. VERY VERY CHEAP!
1.0,Very poor quality. Broke within hours of buying.
1.0,Didnt like it. It is a cheap plastic. Its so thin
1.0,Didn’t like the material and runs small
1.0,Don’t buy...sizing doesn’t match. We loved how beautiful this swimsuit is.  we got the size for 13/14 yr old for my 10 yr old daughter. however it’s not for that age group. More like a 5-6 yr old can fit in it. It’s Way to small. Not to mention customer service sucks. When I wanted a refund they kept running me around only wanting to give me part of my money back. I had to file a claim just to get my money back. And they were still rude in the last email.
1.0,The shirt feels like a paper bag. It's so thin and see through. It's worse than what you would get in a Halloween costume. The colors were correct and sizing was fine. I'm returning this shirt.
1.0,Crap material - ugly.
1.0,worked for about two weeks before it started intermittently stopping and starting.
1.0,"The images on the swim suit were hardly recognizable. The swim suit feels nice in the water, but it looks solid blue. Item was not as described!"
1.0,"The &#34;gem&#34; is so miniscule that it is almost indiscernible to see. I have a hard time even telling what color it is, it is so small, and I'm the one that ordered it."
1.0,It is very non stretch and the 2x is more like a medium. It was waaayyyy too short and definitely not as imagined. I can't even take a picture of this. Let me go to UPS to return this lolol
1.0,Horrible not at all like the picture
1.0,It didn’t last one day! Seriously
1.0,"If i could rate this 0 stars i would, i bought it and everything and it never even showed up. What a waste."
1.0,I don't like them. They are too big for my taste.
1.0,I thought these gloves would be decent for the amount I payed but on the first wear they ripped!
1.0,they break really easy
1.0,"Cheap material. Cheap packaging. Old lady print. Just a big no. I'm5'9"" 138 lbs and it made me look dowdy."
1.0,This bra extremely uncomfortable. Do not recommend it.
1.0,Did not fit my gear s2 classic as advertised
1.0,Bought this before and this time it's not even close to the first one .ripped off.I posted four photos and the last one is the chain I brought first looks way better then the other.
1.0,I think this if a junior size or something! I ordered a large and couldn't even pull it on!! Returned
1.0,"Rarely do I not read the fine print but this time I did. This smells exactly like rubbing alcohol that has been diluted with water. Reading the label it says. ""contains isopropyl alcohol"" I didn't read that and paid 7.99 for what is probably 50 cents worth of alcohol. Specially formulated product my arse."
1.0,I did not like this item in any way shape or form it is just not what I expected and I believe I paid way too much for it.<br />The zipper gets stuck and the material is just not a good material and I cannot really use my phone through the plastic cover on the outside
1.0,"The sleeves are extremely small and there is an excessive amount of material at the bottom of the dress. It wraps in the back of the dress so there is no type of support to keep the dress up and it weighs about 5 lbs. When I tried to return it, you have to pay for shipping to be returned to a China address which makes it cost more to ship than the dress cost."
1.0,"I'd give it zero stars if possible! Looks homemade, does not look like the picture and the sizing is off!"
1.0,"The quality is sub par, the fly zipper is always showing because there is a permanent crease in the denim that will not iron out.  This is the first pair of ""David Bitton Buffalo"" jeans I have ever experienced problems with."
1.0,These dresses run small!!
1.0,This is a joke right?  This shirt is huge for starters and I ordered a small.  The fabric is cheap and thin and threading coming apart on sleeves. Worst purchase ever.
1.0,Sized for a child's hands
1.0,The bag had only earring it.
1.0,I bought these with high hopes the first pair for tight but I was able to get them on so I decided to try another pair and they wouldn’t even go on my feet at all way to small THESE ARE IRREGULAR IN SIZING in all I tried three pairs on none fit the same as the other and the one that did crunches my toes up horribly
1.0,If i could give 0 stars i would. The description is lying. Only 1 pair of these glasses were mirrored and only 2 colored. Most just came with black see through lenses. Dont waist your time.
1.0,I tried these gloves on immediately and decided that these were not going to be for me.<br /><br />They were extremely uncomfortable. Now this might have been mitigated as time passed on but they were way too uncomfortable for me to break in.<br /><br />I returned these immediately
1.0,The flag was placed inside the metal quite sloppily. It is crooked and not aligned or as straight as it should be or as it is shown in the product pictures. It took a while to get here so imagine my disappointment that they saw this and packed it as if it was good quality to send to a customer. Careless. I have already started a return for a refund. I'll get my Cuban flag accessories elsewhere.
1.0,"not long enough, was digging into my skin from both sides. it's beautiful just not long enough"
1.0,Very disappointed!  So much smaller than  depicted!
1.0,This bag did not include the outside pocket on back nor did it include the inside pocket.. I'm returning this bag ASAP. I have several of these Lily Bloom Hobo Bags and never have I been disappointed like this. I don't think this is an original Lily Bloom. And the stitching was crooked also. Not impressed.
1.0,As soon as I put the pants on they rip.i bought 2 pairs of pants.same thing happened
1.0,Lenses do not fit snug in frame. Couldn’t even wipe lenses clean without them falling out. Had to return.
1.0,Not the best quality. TTS.
1.0,Didn't even get to try it on before it broke on me! Cheap.
1.0,"ETA on 1-22-18: I'm changing my five-star review because the friend whom I gave this to as a gift tried cleaning it because it began to tarnish, and the silver finish came right off. So completely embarrassing. I've promised to replace it with something of higher quality.<br /><br />Original review:Bought this for my bestie for Christmas. She loves it and wears it daily on her own chain, which is not as long as the chain it came with (which was VERY long). Great gift for the price."
1.0,Looks great but broke in about 2 weeks
1.0,"Didn’t fit, material is see through. It’s the length of a shirt, not a dress."
1.0,"Don't buy don't waste your money it's black for a week<br /> after that color starts to fade away to fast to soon and it gets ugly, plus it's flabby and limp."
1.0,"This is not a ‘3D’ mask as promoted, simply a mask with multiple seams to form fit a face. While we singers still are required to wear masks indoors in church, I thought this would work but it was a waste of money as it is just a regular mask. Buy the Resonance Singers mask online elsewhere much easier to sing through and no sound muffling because it sits away from your lips allowing for full movement in true 3D."
1.0,The slippers were not very comfortable and so I returned them
1.0,The string broke off after just a few weeks!
1.0,"I knew it was viscose, but I hate it! The front is all viscose and the back has some elastan. It feels horrible. Do not recommend!<br />Not how imagined Ulla Popken quality…"
1.0,Shipping with UPS was an error. This was the first time am buying from you guys. Will never ever buy again. A cheap
1.0,I had ordered a large and recieved a &#34;one size&#34; so in reality they are a one size fits all. I do not recommend this product for sizing the patter is cute but they fit my size 2 sister better than they would a size 8-10 woman if your curvy well don't get this product it unfortunately won't fit :(
1.0,This band was extremely stiff and hard. Not very flexible and would scrap my wrist. Also not as vibrant as it shows in the photo.
1.0,It fits but the top gathers thinking on returning!
1.0,Returned it the same day I got it. The chain broke off as soon as I revived it.
1.0,Cute print design but cheap quality material and too small.
1.0,"VERY thin and SUPER short. And, I’m not afraid to wear a short dress. Using this as pajamas."
1.0,Terrible design that is not the way it is shown.
1.0,Bought a small and I swim in it.
1.0,There were no tags on the shirts so I had no idea of size nor if there was sun protection.....I feel I should get either a refund or two shirts that have appropriate tags that are visible
1.0,Only came with one hook! Very disappointed!
1.0,Product did not match sale page photos. I threw them away. I would not recommend this to family or friends.
1.0,"Very poor quality, it is very thin. Looks different from what advertised."
1.0,Did not recieve adult shirt!! Just baby!!
1.0,"Very thin material,  poor quality would not recommend"
1.0,Under sized
1.0,Chain to short.
1.0,Earrings are too large look very strange on
1.0,I'm a muscular 510 195 pounds. I received a poor quality black T shirt that looked like the sleeves were cut out at home along with a note letting me know that I could receive another shirt for free buy giving a favorable review. My wife laughed at me. I used mine to change the oil in my truck.
1.0,Too thin to offer any protection. I returned it.
1.0,As of right now this will stay one star!!
1.0,Ordered new nose piece and ear socks for M frames. Received bright pink tape measures. WTF? Buy anywhere else.
1.0,This didn't work upon receipt. My teen bought this with a birthday gift card and was disappointed.
1.0,I read reviews about these pants being short but i bought them anyway for my 5’1” son. They were soo short on him and he’s not tall.
1.0,"I was so excited when the boots came but they was too big.  The sites themselves look like the picture and very nice and new but even worth ordering my normal shoes, 8 is too big. Wish I had gone with a 7."
1.0,I thought I ordered silver!
1.0,I really liked this blouse and I ordered it!  The buttons on this blouse fell off after the first wash!  I do not recommend it!
1.0,"Unfortunately, these were too small for my 6'6"" husband.  He really liked the style and they are made well.  The nose piece was too tight and when we tried to adjust them the arms were not long enough to provide a better fit.  Added Sept 16, 2021; arm snapped off.  It did not just come apart but the metal broke.  There didn't seem to be any reason for it to break (it was not handled roughly)."
1.0,Super cheap stretchy material
1.0,"This picture is the same long sleeve robe one in large the darker one in extra large.<br />I ordered this robe is every single size as it was for my bridal party. I ordered the moms the long sleeve version that’s shown as an option. The large delivered and it was a lighter grey and was not the same shade as the rest of them nor the other long sleeve robe. I assumed it was an error and ordered another large robe only to have it delivered the same wrong shade. Moreover, one size is a different shade than the rest. My wedding is in one week and the mother is going to have to be not matching the rest of us. Very inconvenient."
1.0,I did not like the fabric and I also did not like the coloration
1.0,The fabric material on the details of these shorts says polyester and spandex- the shorts are very still and even say 100% cotton on the tag 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
1.0,Very cheaply made.<br />Don't waste your money
1.0,Too small in width
1.0,Does not look like a Tahitian pearl
1.0,It looks nothing like the picture.......it will be returned
1.0,The zipper broke on first use. Using it to travel internationally - very inconvenient
1.0,looks better on the picture of the girl
1.0,It was way too small for a xxl and I did not like the material sent it back
1.0,Don’t waste your money. The ones fell out some and all of them turned a green/bronze color within weeks. Stick with stainless steel!
1.0,"Neither pair would stick to sunglasses, waited too long to return, my loss. Would not recommend these to anyone"
1.0,This is a terrible shirt for 3 reasons: (1) You’ll pay postage and wait months to receive from China and if you need to to return it it will cost you the postage back to China; (2) The quality is TERRIBLE with the white being ITCHY AND STIFF (3) the arms taper to a very tight fit starting at the elbow and below which the picture doesn’t show. I would have avoided based on the photo alone had I known. AVOID BOTH THE SELLER AND ITEM AT ALL COSTS!!! Not worth the risk!!!
1.0,Gloves were very cheaply made.
1.0,This dress is sewn weirdly. The ties go over the chest when they should be going under and around the waist. This forces you to pull the dress forward causing and extremely low neckline.<br /><br />It's also unlined and very see through
1.0,fabric smell bad after use for some time in the sun.
1.0,It is broken after the second time of using...
1.0,Broke the moment i took them out the packaging. Cheap
1.0,Mine came see through. You can see all hardware in back of earrings. Not like picture at all. When I asked the seller why they are like this...they replied &#34;cheaper to make clear&#34;....so this is nothing but false advertising. Very disappointed. Beware of this seller!
1.0,"Durable plastic. Solid frames. But, only one problem, they werent the ones the picture showed like i wanted. These are way different than the ones as shown."
1.0,"This bolero is much too short, like a couple of sleeves held together with a band of cloth across the shoulders. It was returned  immediately. The sleeves ""fit"" if you don't consider that it was so short it was useless as a bolero."
1.0,I wear the bottom piece as a girdle but the top-JUST NO
1.0,Much cheaper looking fabric than picture
1.0,"El modelo, diseño y material muy bueno<br />Pero, uno el broche se abre sólo. No pude devolverlo por que tengo una cirugía grande de espalda y no manejo aún."
1.0,Pocket Square is literally the size of a Folded Picnic Napkin.  The Bow Tie is Child size....Total waste of money...Unless you're buying it for a 5 year old.
1.0,"Gloves arrived and when I opened the package, a pink glove is covered in dirt and missing a white glove from the set. They are obviously not NEW like it stated when I ordered."
1.0,"Honestly, the sizing is a lie. I ordered a Large and it fit like X-Small. I couldn't even put it on at all. I am extremely disappointed."
1.0,"Material is so hot, and doesn’t fit the way it’s advertised.. way too big."
1.0,"Nothing like the photo, looks like a sack and the fleece is more like a towel."
1.0,Very small.  Nice color.  Kind of boxy. Material is thin.
1.0,"The top and skirt fit great, possibly a tad small, but the bottoms are huge. It would be years before my daughter could fit into them. The thigh opening is about 5” bigger than any of my daughters other bottoms and the correct size was on the label."
1.0,"I got this shirt to practice embroidery. It’s cute and light fabric, but it has a strong chemical smell even after washing. I’ve taken a number of classes on the fashion industry and that has made me weary of chemical smells because it can lead to cancer. This item is NOT SAFE for anyone in my opinion."
1.0,"This is only the second full week of school. The Velcro strap is falling apart already.<br />Yes they were inexpensive, but expect more than 2 weeks out of a pair nod sneakers."
1.0,Very disappointed! The hat band is all twisted and rippley.  It will not smooth out.  The thin fabric over the cardboard brim is wrinkled and bunched.
1.0,my eye doctor said they do not have a blue light blocking filter i would give them a zero but that is not possible so i give them a 1
1.0,Love my boys but this made my wrists turn green in a matter of days. Disappointed
1.0,This was cute but broke after two weeks of use (the decorative part broke off from the ring).
1.0,These locs are not dark at all they are very cheaply made and easy to break. I've only had these glasses a few days and the lense has already popped out! These glasses are junk!
1.0,The description does not match the item.  It fits more like a bolero style than kimono cardigan.  It is open on the sides and the sleeves are more like 1/4&#34; than 3/4&#34;.  I received a defective item also.  Returning it now!
1.0,Fit was too tight on my bust line. Skirt flared too much on my hips made be look wide. Normally qear a 4 but maybe the 6 in this would've been better. Lace  design made the outfit look more like a lace tablecloth so didn't like that either.
1.0,Made-in-china garbage! Sat on face unevenly. DO NOT BUY!
1.0,"When I tried to put the boots on, the zipper on one boot wouldn’t go down....at all....no matter how hard I tugged and pulled. The boots are completely unwearable. I reached out to the company’s customer service and they gave me a run around and then never followed through after I messaged them again."
1.0,Quite possibly the worst thing I've ever ordered on Amazon.
1.0,El vestido llego roto deshilandose... Defectuoso roto no me pondré ademas demasiado largo. Y pequeño para la talla que pedi. Aun no me responden que va a pasar.
1.0,I just received my pants yesterday and I’m very unhappy. Do NOT buy these I should have listened to the other reviews. First of all I received the wrong size unless an XL is a 1X because I normally wear XL but these are hugeeeeeeee. I had the black ones on yesterday and it’s thin material but good enough to wear them around the house. Upon putting the navy ones on today there was a hole on the seams inner thigh. Really....... waste of money don’t purchase.
1.0,"This is extremely small. If you want a work pant that is so tight and shows every flaw, then you'll love this. I've gotten other pants that were good, but this was so disappointing."
1.0,It ripped me off- it was silicone and not plastic and i thought it was real bc it had the actual pictures and it said moveable jaw but it was not like it said and it was moveable but with silicone so i got a refund
1.0,This product broke off within the first 2 hours of wearing it. Definitely cheap and a waste of money
1.0,the back strap broke the first time we put them on my son. We cut the other on off so they matched and they only lasted a few weeks after that. Not worth it.
1.0,No guste
1.0,"Ordered the purple zircon heart..I did not receive it. Instead, I received the mother/daughter charms pictured here. My mother has passed away and I have no children, so I would never order anything like this. They are pretty, but useless to me."
1.0,I was hoping for this product to be cute and comfy but the material just looks cheap. It’s extremely tight and within two days started looking just awful. I would not buy again.
1.0,"Bracelet is not good quality, it’s cute but broke the first day my daughter wore it."
1.0,"Broke when I touched it. Seriously, I picked it up out of the box and the post fell off.  Lol..you get what you pay for."
1.0,"The toy looks as cheap as something you find at the Dollar store.  Over price and cheap materials, no especial effects."
1.0,They are cheaply made and DO NOT WORK AT ALL. Very disappointed<br />This was a give to a 60 year old man who has never seen the colors in the sky. I feel like I was lied to when I bought these
1.0,This was as thin as tissue paper. I couldn't wear it.
1.0,I have a 14 and half cafe and about a foot long. I was send. A sock. About. 3 inchs wide and. 4 inches long which wasn't. Big enough for a kid. Are. You. Kidding you about. Asking me lf i was please. With. This. Item
1.0,What a waste of money. I bought this for Halloween and it stopped working the day before. We put in the battery to test it out. Turns out there was already a batteries inside and they were leaking battery acid. It corroded the entire thing. Do Not Buy this!
1.0,I purchased 6 to 12 mos considering the consumer ratings indicating size runs small.  Our baby is 4 mos old and I cannot see this hat fitting her for longer than a month or two.
1.0,"Don't waste your time, the zipper broke the first time I used them."
1.0,"If you wear an extra large hat, these bands will be too tight.  I bought these based on one reviewer's five star Amazon review, but perhaps the specifications have changed since he received his bands.  These things are so tight that they fit snugly on my calf.  I tried stretching them out, but no matter how hard I pulled they popped back to their original size (this speaks well for the quality of their construction, if not their design).  They may be OK for people who have smaller hat sizes and/or those who can tolerate very tight constrictions around their heads.  I have already cut mine and spliced them together in order to get one usable sweat band out of my purchase.  I won't buy these again."
1.0,"This was a cheap off white acrylic sweater, nothing like the white Cotten sweater in photo.  Terrible purchase"
1.0,This dress is way too small and see through. The fabric is very cheap as well. I would not recommend purchasing.
1.0,No me agradó la talla. Demasiado grande.
1.0,"The quality of this shirt was equivalent to something bought from Dollar General. It looks nothing like the picture and the size is WAY off.  I ordered the size I usually wear, adult XL. When I opened it I could tell right away it was way too small. My daughter wears an adult small and it fit her perfectly. If it was made better I would have kept it for her, but ended up returning it."
1.0,"What horrible quality. Another Amazon dud. Too small, see through. What a waste. I have ordered others from G2 and they were great. This one well pass. I sent it back the day I tried it on."
1.0,Didn't work and they wouldn't fit over my glasses.
1.0,I don't like at all.
1.0,"I have purchased bombas socks before but these were my first ""no show"" the fabric is so thin that within a couple of wears I had holes in soles."
1.0,Cheap material and is not flattering. It went back.
1.0,Can't be used for prescription glasses.
1.0,The earrings back SNAPPED off the first time I tried to put the multicolored ones on!!! Absolute JUNK
1.0,The yellow font is too light against the pink and it’s not noticeable until your up close
1.0,"one strap was short, returned was easy and quick."
1.0,Way too small and hard to put on and even harder to remove. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,Picture and description showed barely below knee length.  Skirt delivered  was to the ankles.  I did not order nor want a ankle skirt.  Material also a little too heavy.
1.0,Large fits like small
1.0,look nothing like pitcure.not for me
1.0,"If you have saggy, flat boobs, these are not for you. I hate bras and thought I'd give these a shot. No way. When I tried putting them on I had to 'gather up' the girls and squish them in there and then when I taped them up they looked like a sad sausage because they just spread out side to side once the thing was in place. No bueno!"
1.0,Thought this was a hard plastic mask and it is flimsy latex.  Definitely looks nothing like the picture when on.  Don’t recommend unless that’s what ur looking for
1.0,So cheap. Basically sheer and could see right through.
1.0,"poor item. they sent my wife the wrong color, the chain was broke  .no clasp. very cheaply made. very unhaappy."
1.0,Material thin and generally not to size
1.0,"Absolutely horrible sizing. Usually wear a 1x, I ordered 2x. Pants fit like a xl around the waist they are long though and sweater fit like a medium. Terrible sizing. Returned it the same day I got it."
1.0,I have cold feet during winter. The socks didn't help at all. Very skimpy in design. Not happy at all. Would never order again. Ordered large. That is a joke.
1.0,They were ripped/torn on the right side
1.0,Didn't fit my daughter. Way too small. Very disappointed.
1.0,Sizes are way off from reality. Masks I received were too small to cover nose and mouth.
1.0,faded real quick
1.0,"Purchased this to wear with my wedding dress.  I put it on for a little and was initially impressed, it seemed to fit great and looked amazing.  Wore it for the first time for my dress fitting.  During the 15 minute drive from my house to the bridal shop, I became fully aware that this was actually a torture device in the form of underwear.  Everything shifted in the most uncomfortable of ways.  My boobs ended up very crooked.  Also, whoever thought it was a good idea to put an inch+ bra strap like thing in the crotch was straight trippin.  Not even a little comfortable.  Constantly aware it is there, and not in a good way."
1.0,"This shirt is a JOKE! It is waaaaaay too small! I’d say buy 4 sizes larger, but that is not an option. It appears to be a child’s shirt.<br />BUYER BEWARE! Do NOT buy this shirt."
1.0,Not off the shoulder. To small
1.0,"I love the look of this kimono! However, on the first wear, I lost nearly half of the fringe. It was falling off everywhere. Everywhere I walked, I left a trail of fringe. It was a huge disappointment because I really do love the look! This will be returned for sure! :("
1.0,Isn't what I expected
1.0,Ordered a size larger and still didn't fit right. Very disapointing
1.0,Almost impossible to get the balls unscrewed and even more difficult to put them in your ears.
1.0,"cute in hand, feels weird on the ear. feels like its going to fall off any second! the clip is hard to get just right, it ends up either being too tight or not tight enough. I gave up on it and gave it to my daughter. She wasn't impressed either, so she cute it apart and now its two earrings."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:e9b1c3e9ece5840199afe93b50624edf]] Women’s Necklace doesn’t have the half heart design, fast shipping and love that aspect, bracelet for my wife is the size of a child’s wrists and doesn’t fit her it’s the one on the right side in the image above, on the men’s necklace the half heart is upside down completely, the whole purpose of buying these were to have to half hearts join together and they can’t if one necklace doesn’t have a half heart and the other is an upside down half heart, I literally hate the product I’ve received."
1.0,Yuck. Sent back<br />Uncomfortable and Blurred my vision
1.0,"Cheaply made, broke in 1 month"
1.0,"The picture along with the item page is intentionally deceptive ‼️  Picture shows a PILE of “diamonds” but only ONE, ITTY BITTY, TEENY, TINY STONE 0.01Ct (do you know how SMALL this is?  1.4 × 1.4 × 0.84 mm  SO small it can’t be measured by America’s measurements.  SMALLER THAN A PINHEAD‼️  The picture of the merchandise is EXTREMELY DECEIVING ‼️‼️‼️"
1.0,The left leg was tighter than the right leg.
1.0,"Description is false! I waited a LONG time to receive this cheesy apparel made of cheep polyester fabric with ridiculous 'arm patches' that are top-stitched on with unfinished edges. It's about 3 sizes too HUGE! NOTHING like pics or description; crocheted, really? I will now never order any clothing from Amazon that doesnt yet have any reviews! Live and learn. This is worthy of a minus star."
1.0,Loved the colors!!Would have given a 5 star review until today...3 days after receiving this...it broke and I almost lost my whole watch!!
1.0,Material is cheap and runs very small in size
1.0,it does not look like the picture and is not a sweater its a nasty fabric that feels aweful
1.0,Real poor quality for being super soft. I sent them back for a refund.
1.0,Awful. Broke after one zip
1.0,"Don’t even know where to start. It’s too big, it feels like a cheap bathing suit AND it’s see through. Feels like something you would buy off wish for $5."
1.0,"SO bummed. This is a really ugly green, not black! I am disappointed in the color and quality. It just looks really cheap. I'm definitely returning this item. Not worth the money by any means."
1.0,"All I can say is, if I had to truely rate this, I wouldn't have the option to write the review about it."
1.0,"When I had had it only three months, the fake leather started peeling off. It is really cute, but not well made."
1.0,"These don't work as you'd hope.  I found a way better solution.  It is a reusable insert you can find by searching WesGem ring insert.  They make different sizes, and different ring thicknesses.  I've found them to be very comfortable.  [[ASIN:B007KB9B0W Ring Sizers Wes-Gem Plastic Ring Guards Assortment 27pc]]"
1.0,when I touched the chain to accommodate it broke. I’m very upset with this. I never happened this before.
1.0,Stones were out of place
1.0,Very cheap and flimsy.  I have small hands and they are very small and very short.  Won't use them and not worth returning.
1.0,"we have wide feet, this didn't even make it into both shoes, they were not working for us at all."
1.0,"They were a gift for my mom but were way too small, the 2x fit more like a large"
1.0,"These were terrible, cheap plastic and smelly, made your feet sweat and stink. Wore maybe 3 times and then tossed."
1.0,Glasses are burry.
1.0,"Love the look, just did not fit!"
1.0,Never even wore it. Extremely too small. I think wrong size was put on the ones I received. I wasted my money.
1.0,"LMAO is this supposed to be a joke??? This shirt looks RIDICULOUS! I can't believe anyone gave it a good review. If you want to look like a boot leg version of Eric from The Little Mermaid, by all means, buy this shirt."
1.0,Very itchy
1.0,This strap was very thin and it was a pain to clasp and unclasp. It's also on the small side and it only comes with the one size strap unlike the Apple product that includes two different sizes in one box. The leather was soft but very thin. I would not buy this product again or recommend anyone to buy it.
1.0,I’d not true to size
1.0,I need to return this
1.0,The leather was not as advertised. It was thin and the wallet was poorly constructed. One of the seams was poorly glued and one half of the wallet could be easily separated from the rest. Not usable and discarded. A waste of money.
1.0,Every single hat was bent.
1.0,Hat is small and also while wearing the plastic mask fogs up making it difficult to see out of. Do not buy not worth it
1.0,very confusing to use and you have to do a bit of math to get your date and time
1.0,"I ordered a size up after reading other reviews, I usually wear a medium. What I recieved fits like a poorly sewn baby doll dress. Very long, with the bottom very wide, yet the sleeves are shorter than my average sized arms."
1.0,"The ring is cute, but it hurts too much to wear. No matter how I tried to adjust the ring, the leaves dug into my finger and the points were actually pretty sharp. After an unexpected hand squeeze caused the metal leaves to puncture my skin, I threw the ring away."
1.0,"Pants feel weird, they are too long, and not cut in a flattering way"
1.0,Way to small! I usually wear a small and they were extremely tight. Get two sizes up.
1.0,"This product didn't pull any blackheads, it didn't remove any peach fuzz. One star giving because it shipped quickly."
1.0,"It’s way thinner than I thought, and it keeps rolling up at the bottom, it was not what I expected it"
1.0,It’s was cute but just fit funny.
1.0,Fell off first day of wearing it without my knowledge and now I don't have a fitbit.
1.0,"It's big... and cute... mine broke, but I got a refund."
1.0,Do not waste your money with this item. It does not deserve any star.
1.0,The first clip in front was too long to pull down shirt and keep down.  It was adjusted to its shortest setting and it made no difference.  I have a different brands Y-style shirt stay and it works but not this particular 3 clip style does not.
1.0,Turned color only after a few weeks of my daughter wearing it.
1.0,"Cheap, bulky, larger then it looks"
1.0,The metal holding the clip on the strap pulled out of the slot it belongs in & will not stay in the slot.  It continues to pull through the slot.  This happened the 2nd time I carried the bag.  Very disappointed.
1.0,"It was okay, but the colors and the fit are nothing like the picture. It is like a big T-shirt. If you wanted to tie the bottom in a knot, like picture, you would not be able to. Sent back."
1.0,I loved it - but it broke after two days.... :(
1.0,"The worst ever, poor quality . I need buy another one because this one it’s not worth it."
1.0,Didn’t fit around neck correctly!very cheap material! Very cute style but poorly made
1.0,Its isnt water resistant at all! Fits fine but wouldnt buy again!
1.0,"Bought this for my husband for Christmas. The design looked neat in the description but when I got it, it was peeling off, looked like a seem by the handle and yellow around the base of the handle where it fastens to the cup. and in one spot on the side near the bottom of the cup the design was a little boogered up. I had to return it. I figured if they could do this bad of a job I definitely wasn't going to re-order. I just got a refund. Too bad because I really wanted this design."
1.0,Pedí color rojo y me enviaron rosado y los necesitaba urgente
1.0,"Great little purse, holds smartphone in outside pocket, so easy to reach when it goes off!! Even though it's small, it holds a lot!!"
1.0,Was broken one side where glusses ar closing and opening.
1.0,"Ugh!! I wanted to like these!!! They do not fit quite like the photo. They are like a pair of Bermuda shorts. I actually liked them, I just can't do those wrinkles!! I put them on around the house before heading out with hubby... I looked in the mirror to check out my new digs one more time before exiting... Oh my gosh!! Really!?! I had to change, it was only going to get worse. I hadn't even left the house! I wish these were in a different material, I would buy several pairs."
1.0,These hats are nothing like the picture. They’re very cheaply made and shed terribly. Think dollar store quality...there’s nothing plush about them. Perhaps I got a bad batch? I ordered from BiBOSS. Perhaps the good reviews are for other sellers? I’m returning and DO NOT RECOMMEND buying these hats.
1.0,not comfortable.  will definitely return them
1.0,Only wore it once and it broke.
1.0,"Very uncomfortable shoes, you don't know this until you wear them, then you can't  return them.  Total rip off."
1.0,They are 14 gauge... they do not fit my 16 gauge dermal archor
1.0,Too small for her
1.0,Tarnished/ cheaply made. Ordered one necklace in rose gold and it came with a tarnished chain and the necklace clasp was loose/cheaply made. I opted for a replacement and the second one came looking the exact same way. Save your time and money- do not buy.
1.0,The hat was huge. I looked like Elmer Fudd.
1.0,The back of heel split immediately
1.0,Thia bag was not strurdy at all. It ripped on the 3rs day of use.
1.0,They look awful. They sag in odd places. Glad they weren't expensive because I just tossed them.
1.0,They broke as soon as I tried to put them in my ear. Save your money. DO NOT BUY. And the gold looks really cheap
1.0,Terrible quality! This product is not a “sweater” at all. It feels like cheap felt for a kids craft project. Terrible cut of the “sweater” and had many imperfections like the one pictured. Don’t waste your time or money!  I’m very disappointed.
1.0,Not a good boat.  Useless without waterproof
1.0,I took a chance on the mixed reviews.  Well the bad ones were correct.  I ordered up in size to compensate. Didn't help a bit. Once washed and dried on a delicate cycle this shirt became a size medium in a skinny fit. Think Ralph Lauren skinny polos.  In a skinny polo I need a large.  The fabric is cheap and thick.  I thought by ordering up in size it would work out it didn't.  It's going into the Goodwill box.  $20 wasted.
1.0,Really cheap material and came out so wrinkled like as if it’s been taken out of a washer and crumpled up and left to dry in the sun. Ironed it to see if maybe it’s wearable but it’s not and I waited too long to return it so I just threw it away.
1.0,I ordered a 7 which is what I wear…..yea no!!! This is WAY to small
1.0,"With both masks assembled, it is way too heavy for a child to wear, therefore impossible to play with."
1.0,"Cheaply made, were very different from the other DKNY pants I purchased at Dillard’s.  I suspect that these were not really DKNY."
1.0,They came broken in pieces.
1.0,"I should have gotten a picture of me holding these up to my legs when I took it out of the package. They were absolutely MASSIVE!!! I’m 5’ 9” and weigh about 175. Depending on the maker, I can wear a size 8-12. Since the description was that they were like yoga pants, and stretchy, I went with a size 12 to be safe - but the size 12 is like some super + size! I could have fit 4 of me in them!!! Definitely returning and MAYBE trying a size 4 instead?!?"
1.0,This outfit is as definitely NOT what I expected from the looks of the picture. Very cheesy and cheap looking. I order a large and it fit like a small. I returned it back to them today. Almost 45 dollars to be that thin
1.0,"I’ve seen Velcro straps on shoes that are sturdier! First off, I agree with the other reviewer than the stock photos are misleading. I purchased this strap in Seashell, which appears to be a metallic silver-toned thick nylon strap. What I received was a flimsy grey Velcro band with white trim. I’ve enclosed photos so you can see what the product looks like in real life, as opposed to the enhanced stock photo. Thankfully, I was able to return this strap, as I wouldn’t recommend."
1.0,"Bad, bad quality is turning black in few days"
1.0,"I couldn't believe how oversized these shirts are. Bought two XL, both are HUGE must be XXXL at least. My Champion and Columbia sweat shirts are great.  I'm very disappointed, had no choice but to return them."
1.0,Very small!!!!!
1.0,"The bag looks fine. However, the zipper broke after about a month. I contacted the seller and never got a response."
1.0,Do not buy. The material is rubbish and so is the colour. Cheap stretch materials and bad stitching. Does not look like the picture at all
1.0,"The earrings were totally cute, and I was happy when I opened them.<br /><br />However, one was put on backwards - when I put it in my ear the metal backing was facing forward, not the snake print.  I tried to open the little gold ring so I could re-attach the hoop forward facing, but the thin piece of metal broke.  I never got to wear them - they went right in the trash.<br /><br />The seller was fine -- shipped to me on time as promised.  Product just not well made."
1.0,"I actually liked the umbrella when I originally received it, but the handle broke during the first use.  I tried to re-attach it but it kept falling off until I lost it. Apart from this issue, I liked the compact size (can easily fit in my tote without materially adding to its weight). In addition, the construction seemed sturdier than another similar sized umbrella I previously owned."
1.0,Again a sizing issue.  Would not purchase again until I hear the sizing is correct.too small.  Typical of overseas sizing.
1.0,"The light up chest did not work. I tried two different sets of batteries and couldn’t make it work. The wiring around the box that holds the batteries was rusty looking and loose. Other than that and my son being upset about the “cool” part of the costume not working, the costume robe was okay."
1.0,"Broke on day 2 at the attachment oh pendant and chain link. Terrible quality, font buy."
1.0,I left the return at the door for pick up and no one came to get it
1.0,"Terrible quality material, see through, too big."
1.0,"Out of my hats this hat is of the lowest quality. It doesn't even look like the photo. Wish I didn't get it now. Of course, it is going back."
1.0,Was not the color it stated in the advertisement.
1.0,"While these earrings are cute,  they are hard to open to even wear and they have broken already,  will not purchase from them again"
1.0,I didn’t like how some words on the dog tag are faded or not printed very well. I would either like a new tag or print them better for the people who’s spending money on your product.
1.0,Purchased 2 of these for my daughters and they both broke the first time they wore them.
1.0,Cute but broke first time I wore it
1.0,it was made of  poor material? Very thin and not flattering<br />On. Did not compare to jackets similar to the ones I tried on in stores.
1.0,way too small.  Had to pay postage to return
1.0,It was too lose
1.0,I’m returning it. The fabric was scratchy and the zipper was very flimsy and caught on the fabric immediately. It’s boxy and shorter than expected. Enough said.
1.0,The material is not of good quality and itches your skin
1.0,The design is cute however tarnished badly.
1.0,The loop “keeper” broke just after a few uses. Not happy with the purchase. I have to use a rubber band to keep the wrist band from flapping.
1.0,"Although it looks very nice, this was the second one I bought and the truck of the tree broke off on both. wouldn't recommend this one."
1.0,Lo siento Es muy incómoda la tela<br />No es como lo esperaba
1.0,They looked used and cheap. Not usual quality of Bebe frames.
1.0,I ordered an XL and it fits like a small. I was so excited to get this shirt but when I put it on it was WAY TOO SMALL
1.0,I had it just for 2 days
1.0,Bead showed up and looked very cheap. Didnt look like picture at all.
1.0,This might fit better if I was shaped like a short little Barrel with no waist or torso......UGLY
1.0,"I always wear a 38B. The cups of this bra are way to large. If you have breast implants - this is for you! But if you have regular boobs with an A or B cup size, no luck. My boobs couldn't even fill it up the bra cups."
1.0,"I was so excited to get this and when I did, I was sorely disappointed. Not only does it look like a giant pimple or cold sore when it's in, but the ball came loose at least 10 times. I kept having to tighten it and by the third night, I lost it in my sleep and couldn't find the ball again. Worst lip piercing ever."
1.0,"Unfortunately, the person who sewed the credit card slots sewed them too narrow and cards don't fit in there. I was hoping this purse would replace a wallet; but it doesn't and it's too small to fit a wallet into it."
1.0,I returned this necklace. Too small and necklace was flimsy.
1.0,It advertises as a 4x but looks like a large
1.0,I am 170 cm tall and 64 kg weight this sweater was too large
1.0,The face was very small so hard to view at times. I was willing to wear it but it broke about a month or 2 after I bought it. I tried to get it repaired but Amazon simply refunded me so guess it's not worth fixing and this was recent. I bought it late 2018. Trash.
1.0,Faded the 2nd day worn
1.0,Very big and too long for a shirt but too short for a dress
1.0,The bracelet came broken
1.0,Very cheap and too small to even look cute
1.0,"oh lawd this ring is so uncomfortable. it's just too thick and the prongs jut out a lot, so it hurts your other fingers. i wanted to like it but just knew i could never wear it."
1.0,"This mask was too small, and does not fit my face at all.  It also rough cut, and the fit is uncomfortable.  The mask also seems very thin."
1.0,I understand boxed singles in fives but all but one was the same yummy world.  Kind of a disappointment.  Great product tho<br /> Just wished wasnt same item
1.0,"This hat is so cheaply made that it is absolutely unusable.  First of all, it had a hole in the crown.  The &#34;felt&#34; the hat was made of almost looked like it had been sprayed onto a mold and that the spray missed a big spot.  It came very wrinkled and I thought that the wrinkles would come out if I stuffed it full of soft clothes for a week.  That didn't help at all so next I steamed the thing which didn't work either.  Don't bother."
1.0,"This tank top feels like the cheapest material you could imagine. Like polyester mixed with single ply toilet paper you'd find in the 98 cent store. Itches my skin, ran them through the washer to see if that'd help, but it didn't.<br /><br />Uncomfortably tight around the shoulders and upper back, very loose on the chest.<br /><br />I can confidently say this is the worst tank top I've ever tried in my life."
1.0,These are the worst Jumbo Sunglasses out there.  They break as soon as you try to wear them.  Avoid!
1.0,"I wouldn't recommend these gloves.  First' the said they could used to touch screen your phone. When they arrived ' I had 2 friends watching me test them as they failed.  I live in SOUTH FLORIDA so I really don't know what material keeps gloves soft. My mother got a great pair of gloves many years before she passed away of cancer way too young. My right hand get colder than the left especially at night either because I leave my right hand out, or because of nerve damage, the way I sleep or because of my autoimmune disease, Lupus has developed into Raynaud’s.  My hand hurts until I am able to get my hand warm and the pins and needles go away. I prefer gloves that are soft than gloves I can text with.  These gloves are uncomfortable because they are poor quality.  They keep my hand warm and after washing them one time I could text. I just don't like then texture, at all and they dry my hands out. I can't stand the texture. It's as if my skin is crawling.  Yuck."
1.0,It’s too big look like it been over stretched
1.0,It tarnished after 2 weeks!
1.0,Its a size or two smaller and it isnt padded. Also said it was amazon prime and was not. Highly disappointed and dont recommend
1.0,This is ridiculously small in the band and the cup size is as well. Order at least two sizes up.
1.0,"But....... sizing is sooooo wrong. I bought a large and it barely fits over my boobs. Not sure who they are sizing this large for. I won't be able to wear outside of house ha, if your bust is 34 and up it won't fit"
1.0,Love the look of product when received but my daughter has a constant black ring around her neck and she always takes it off before showers etc like it stated. For the price we paid it should be Sterling silver.
1.0,"Plastic trash, broken to pieces upon arrival"
1.0,"Will not fit onto my g shock DW5600. No matter what myself or eventually a jeweler did, the spring bars would NOT fit properly. Do not recommend."
1.0,"I wasn’t happy at all with this ring, when I received it the side stones were part way out and it looked terrible. I attempted to return the item but the cost was 1/2 the price of the ring and pointless to even bother."
1.0,It shrunk about two sizes after washing the leotard once! Absolutely terrible. Waste of money. It seems to be very cheap quality material.
1.0,Absolute NO.Completely ripped after 15 min of gentle wearing(pushing shopping cart and loading it with groceries).Waste of money.It literally peels off your hands like your skin.<br />Look for something else.
1.0,Chain broke immediately
1.0,I am 5 foot tall.  These run short and big.  The top runs small.
1.0,"Poor workmanship. I had ordered 2 different colors for my vacation. Neither one was wearable. On one of the shoulder straps was not sewn at all, no way of attaching it except a saftey pin.  The other the other one the back strap was looped and sewn backwards. And the circumstance was nowhere near the same size at the other one. I was expecting a full coverage bottom and  weren't. I'm 5'3 103 so not like I was expecting a miracle. I had requested return and refund information but, after vacation forgot about it and I had missed my window to return both useless suits."
1.0,"These socks while obviously will built, should say VERY FIRM.  I had a hard time just getting these socks on my sock assist, once on, it was impossible to get my foot, much less my entire leg up to the calf, into these compression socks.<br /><br />I have worn Dr. Scholl's Diabetic compression socks for the past 5 years.  They wear well and I need to replace them about once a year.  I think these socks, not this make, but the cotton socks that are over the calf are truly life savers.  So I'm not knocking the product just this socks compression ratio."
1.0,It’s either made for a child or (more likely) an Asian.
1.0,"Did not like the matterial, very cheap. Not flatter, ran large. Definitely returning."
1.0,It’s has a small face not like the one on the picture and it has a poor quality
1.0,Ridiculously small- at least 2 sizes too small.  This large is the size of a womens small and even then it would be tight.
1.0,Ripped on the first wash. Cheap stitching.
1.0,"These were terrible, was never even able to wear one earring bc they were impossible to unscrew to put it my ear, then impossible to screw in.  Very disappointed."
1.0,I love the shape ie feather but it is turning my finger green and I thought it was sterling silver. I'm not happy at all!
1.0,WASTE OF TIME! Looks like a child could wear these... way too freaking small..
1.0,it has left a green ring on my wrist...
1.0,cheap. the part that connects to the watch face came out and my watch fell and broke. don't use with watch
1.0,Cheap broke in a day.
1.0,"No one  answer  i try to contact with someone!!! Still waiting for my refund. Not recomend at all and is so difficult to return , the dress doesn't have no shape at all looks so cheap and material are not good"
1.0,"Super cute but upon the FIRST WEAR, the weld on the ring broke and it was unwearable. 0/10"
1.0,I am very disappointed with this product cause it is nothing like the image. Disappointed customer!
1.0,The bust and waist was a tad bit too tight which made the fabric over the shoulder big. The cups in the dress seemed lopsided which is the main reason I’m sending it. Ack. Stinks I paid for shipping and it seems like I will have to pay to return the dress. Due to this I wouldn’t recommend buying.
1.0,broke after 1 week :(
1.0,"Almost off white.. it is so wrinkled that it is impossible to iron..<br />Sending it back.., any picture I have looked looks different from the one I got:-((("
1.0,It's not properly done. corners are kinda loose!
1.0,I brought two and they broke within two weeks
1.0,"Horrible fit, Poorly made. I checked &#34;Somewhat small&#34; in the fit box, but that doesn't quite cover it. It was huge in the neck/shoulder area and very straight through the hips. There is no way to accurately size this. The material is coarse and scratchy. The seams looked like that would open with the slightest pull. I sent it back."
1.0,I got these for my daughter at Wal-Mart for $10 After day 1 they were ripping after day two the canvas was pulling away from the rubber.
1.0,"very cheap looking, thin material...maybe ok for a bathingsuit cover up."
1.0,It’s my second one. Won’t link with chest belt
1.0,"I guess it is a return item as the product is not wrapped, the handles, the zipp, the accessories ...not like the other one that I order from the merchant also thru amazon ...everything is wrapped and cloth bag is included. I just don't want to return this cause it takes times to wait for a new one...but  not so happy with this one."
1.0,Needless to say this is being returned.  I bought this product previously for my daughter and it was cute and she loved it but outgrew it.  This is what they're selling now.  Yikes!
1.0,"The zipper broke in less then a month. I bought it back in March 21, 2021 and broke may 5 2021. Cheap zipper."
1.0,I ordered 2 pair. Both fell apart after light use
1.0,The fit was great but there was absolutely no way that I could wear it and not be fully flashing my crotch.
1.0,The product came broken without even opening the packaging it came in.
1.0,"Dress is ripped and it’s close by the zipper.  Also, it had a funky smell liked old perfume.  I don’t know if what I got is used because there’s no tag at all."
1.0,"Ordered size small, wear a size six:  One was only 20"" long; the other almost a yard long.  There was some type of tool in the box, but no directions on what to do with it.  May be for punching more holes in the long one or taking off the metal pieces to resize it, but know for a fact that it couldn't help the short belt anyway."
1.0,"Poorly made, waistband looks cheap"
1.0,"I went to put it on and it broke in my hands. Never got a chance to wear it. if I could give 0 stars I would, very disappointed. The worst part is I couldn't even get refunded because I didn't use it right away and the refund timeline closed. Couldn't be more unhappy!!"
1.0,I absolutely loved it!! Until it broke..  only was able to wear a couple time and the metal arm broke in half and doesn’t seem like it will be able to be fixed.
1.0,"This was some BS.... It looked like it was real denim,  but when it arrived it was like polyester material with a pic of a denim pocket on it.... 🤬"
1.0,Poor quality. Water came out of front and trigger without doing anything to cause them to shoot. Contacted seller for refund. Only received refund for 2 instead of 4. Won’t be buying again from this seller.
1.0,They feel like a tire tube!
1.0,lenses had fallen out and would not stay when reinserted.
1.0,Very dissatisfied with this product. My son hasn't even had the shoes for a month and the front part of the soles are worn down paper thin and a whole is forming on the one shoe. I am very upset that i bought these shoes and now i have to go and spend more money on another pair. They are cheaply made.
1.0,"It came broken, looks better in the picture."
1.0,Waaaaaay to small. I have been told I have dainty wrists but this bracelet almost looks like it's more for a child and not an adult. Looks flimsy and cheap and like it will easily break
1.0,"I wanted it to wear to the gym. I love the color, the ease of slipping it on and the stretch. The metal is rusting because I sweat while working out. Terrible quality."
1.0,0 stars!!! This shirt is horrible in every way. Not at all what I expected. Returned immediately.
1.0,Broke after about 6 days... tried to add to my ankle bracelet collection with this beauty.
1.0,"Horrible, scratchy material and way too large. I'm returning it."
1.0,We ordered once and the hoodie was to small. Do I ordered another one a size bigger. The second one came with label stating a larger size but it was the same size as the first.
1.0,It was very small and it broke within a couple of hours wearing it. Very poorly designed.
1.0,"The crystals fall out, its a complete waste of money, i never even wore it and the crystals are everywhere. The metal is cheap , do not buy!"
1.0,You. Have. Got. To. Be. Kidding. These shoes arrived totally bent out of shape. The liner seems to be I'll fitting and is bending out of the shoe. So disappointed because they are cute. Packaging was a HUGE fail. I don't think they will ever be able to be corrected. Sending back.
1.0,"Way too small, the size is so far off that it will only fit my 8 year old niece and I ordered the size 13-14. The material is thin, I regret not reading the reviews."
1.0,"This was cheaply made.  Instructions on this watch is poor and printed small pice of paper(hard to see)<br />I wished I did more research it, before I brought it. Stay alway from this prouct."
1.0,Slighk
1.0,"Ordered 3 masks and they didn't arrive after a month, so I checked the tracking number and it was fake. Company was unresponsive."
1.0,Fit is small and not proportionate.  Material feels slimy and slick and does nothing to help with the heat.
1.0,Haven't figured out how to attach the tail. Has a ponytail type end but where do you put it on a leotard?
1.0,Don't even buy. Fingers and rings green after one wear.
1.0,"Love the dress, but it's waaaaay too small.  Darn it."
1.0,This vest works but Ive had it a week and the edge of the sleeve is already coming off
1.0,The frames are way too small for my head and I have small head compared to most people. The sides would squish the sides of my head and give me a headache. They were also crooked and didn’t have the best texture. Packaging was cheap too and they didn’t feel like they were worth what I paid for. The company usually makes great sunglasses but I don’t know what happened.
1.0,The way it felt and the tail had a rip.
1.0,Poor fit. NO push-up at all.
1.0,Very disappointed I wore it three times and it is broken!!
1.0,Lovely when arrived.  After three weeks goldstone chain has turned a dull silver color......such an obvious contrast to circle that can not be used.  VERY disappointed.
1.0,Too thick to penetrate nostril hole.
1.0,"It's a shame because it's soooo beautiful, but can easily break within 10 minutes of wearing it. After mine kept breaking and I kept fixing it (with other jewlery tools I have) I once was able to make it last a full day. Then it broke again. Twice. I give up."
1.0,This is not a real copper snake ring. It's not heavy like real copper rings and this is a fake picture of the ring. If they use the real picture no one will want to buy it.
1.0,"The dress is cute, but way too small. I ordered according to my measurements and I couldn't even zip it up."
1.0,Way smaller than expected! Barely fits my 7 yr old
1.0,"Uncomfortable, poor material and poor fit"
1.0,"Blurry & cheaply made.  Just threw them in the trash because I purchased a pair of Cyxus which is rated the 3rd best blue blocking glasses for a very good reason, they are fantastic, crystal clear viewing. Yes, they cost 3 times the price of these, but so much more worth it. Don't make the mistake I made, get a better pair the first time!!"
1.0,The material feels like rubber and is very flimsy. Difficult to feed behind duty belt.
1.0,watch out for sweat it ruins peace
1.0,"Too big, not what I expected."
1.0,Broken pieces - the jewelry literally fell apart. When I was trying to secure it and even while wearing it. The plastic ends just came apart. It's not really useful if it's not secure. Would not recommend.
1.0,"Poor quality, wouldn't fit on my ear."
1.0,Under sized. Order a size larger. Fast delivery.
1.0,"I like color, quality, but size. I order XL and XXL. Size XXL is smaller than XL"
1.0,Broke within the first week. Very disappointed because I really loved the design.
1.0,Very very cheaply made bows were held on by one piece of thread look like they would fall off at any minute and Tutu was very itchy on legs
1.0,"Bought this to wear on a babymoon in May but was also hoping to get wear out of it the rest of the summer, as I’m not due until September.  Unfortunately the stitching came out less than an hour into wearing it and there is now a hole in the belly area.  Very poorly made."
1.0,"Sleeves were much shorter than shown.  V-neck much shorter.  Top, in general was short, not long as shown in picture.  Cheap material, probably fades easily.  Not worth the cost."
1.0,This blouse is cute but poorly made the stitching on the shoulders show and there are flaws in the material!
1.0,Definitely NOT the same dress. It was supposed to be longer with a curved hem at the bottom.
1.0,the links pinch...  tiny hairs getting ripped out makes it an uncomfortable wear.  The links are easy to add and remove though.
1.0,They were not as pictured.  The opals were not three different colors as pictured and metal was silver and not gold colored.
1.0,No me llego al courrier d Miami!  Me hubiese encantado usarlo. Pero no llego y por ende no lo tengo..
1.0,don't waste your money half of them arent threaded correctly and the outside jewel or ball eventually just falls out and you have to keep replacing. not worth it
1.0,Item very tight. Needs to be loosened to fit comfortably.
1.0,"Do NOT get this shirt! Never buy anything from trendy tree, worse service ever! And very rude on top of not caring about customer. First when i opened package there was a very strong chemical smell!<br />I got a large, i am 160 lbs and the leng5th was good but shirt was very tight in arm pit area,( got a rash from just tring it on!),  and there sleeves barely went over my shoulder! Was like wairing sand paper, not soft in the least.  I told trendy tree they just said no returns, nothing else and wont respond to my secound email."
1.0,"I'm ordering this nice blouse, But the problem is running too small, The Material for the price is good, I ordening XXL but really looks like XS This Blouse is Not USA Size"
1.0,WAY too small. I wear a medium in everything and these are so tight I can barely move. Disappointing. I am definitely not a large.
1.0,Was unable to fit this replacement on my x40.  The side with button did not fit.
1.0,"Trying the first pair on, got snagged and tore a hole across it easy like tissue paper. Haven't tried on the tighter knitted ones yet but I'd imagine the material isn't any more sturdy."
1.0,It broke in 2 days
1.0,order med its to small
1.0,YIKES another one I should have researched (you get what you pay for)~detail is lovely but they are designed and made for a women in a different culture with very tiny FEET!  I could NOT WEAR!<br />But I did get my money refunded-THANK YOU!<br />SLPHarmon
1.0,The picture clearly shows a Venom costume. What arrived was black panther. We also ordered an XL but it wasn't even close to being large enough for most children over the age of 5 or so.<br />Not sure what happened here but not the right costume at all
1.0,"This was too large, more like a size 11..."
1.0,Got chafed
1.0,These are too tiny to wear - much smaller than pictured.
1.0,Was really excited about this dress. Runs small. And has numerous holes from insects or something everywhere!!!!! Had to return!!!
1.0,Save your money.  Sizes are WAYYYY off. These things are tiny
1.0,"Fits weird, found a better one at H&M."
1.0,Not for use on small dainty necklaces. The holes are to thick for anything to fit.
1.0,"I am not sure how or why other buyers left such great feedback. Item is very cheap in appearance, states amethyst but it is not. It appears glued together, I purchased more than 15 and I am forced to toss them out. The pictures are far nicer than the actual product, not a proper representation. The seller extremely unhelpful. I would recommend purchasing this from another seller."
1.0,It does not stay closed. Fearful I'm going to lose my Fitbit.
1.0,Very cheap dress.
1.0,This product is sized is for an infant. Waste of money.
1.0,"Extremely flimsy material the rubber cannot hold the lenses. I had to take it 3 different shops. They all refused to put in the lenses in this frame. I finally found a local optician who install the lenses but with a slight movement the lenses come out, My son already lost two lenses."
1.0,"Too tight, not as flexible as other ones."
1.0,"Some of the balls won’t come off so I can’t even wear them, and some of the bottoms were loose before I even put them on."
1.0,"Poorly made… Hat is wrinkled, and the logo looks like it is just barely ironed on"
1.0,Disappointed with this product. When assembled it is crooked and the necklaces fall off easily.  Would not recommend this product.
1.0,I purchased this poncho in a med/ lg. I don’t recommend this poncho at all! Poncho is way to short and doesn’t look at all like the picture. Totally disappointed. I’ve returned the sweater and never received my refund. Save your money!
1.0,Way way the wrong fit
1.0,Disappointed to find this bag in a damaged box and seems have been opened and used . Very upset
1.0,Awful cuff links!  Ordered twice and returned twice.  They arrived scratched both times.  Waste of time.
1.0,Cheap gold painted plastic
1.0,I’m pretty disappointed with this product it’s nothing like the white in the picture it is yellow and the collar doesn’t fit like the picture either I’m pretty bummed because I was super excited:(
1.0,"Not happy with product, it is not what u see on line in color and thickness. The man's ring is to thin"
1.0,To tight and not wide calf.
1.0,"This item is not at all as pictured. It's not in any way a sweatshirt. The fabric is a cheap, shiny and thin synthetic, and the colors are way off. The pink sweatshirt I ordered is closer to orange and the stripe colors are garish and bright rather than muted as shown in the photo."
1.0,"Cheaply made, none of the backs fit the earrings.  They were all too small.  I'm returning them for a gift card credit.  Don't waste your time and money of these."
1.0,Got these for my teenage granddaughter. She hated them!! They are cheaply made. The inside is scratchy and the hearts are falling apart straight out if the package.
1.0,Beware. Don't buy this. This is a piece of crap. It doesn't fit at all!!! Not able to use it. I don't know who the heck did this thing.. Not able to wear it. Lost my money on this crap.. I can't fit my chest in it!!! This is not a dress!!!
1.0,Way way wayyyyy too dark. I guess some people like that midnight look but no thanks. I couldn't see a thing with these on. The polka dots also wore off with a light rub of the finger. CHEAP
1.0,After a few washings there is no more elastic & they a rolling down.
1.0,Will not fit adults properly. Super small
1.0,I pretty much bought them for the cute little hoops.. which were so cheap they either were already broken or broke first time trying. Save your money.
1.0,"1) Length of glove is too short.  It rides down, exposing your hands while in use.  2) The glove is just too thin, breaking too easily."
1.0,"Stones too dark, look black not blue. Am returning."
1.0,"I really wanted to like this. But it's stiff and awkward and completely unsalvageable. It's too big to be a beanie, and way too stiff to be a floppy hipster-wearing hat. Had to return it."
1.0,It looks amazing on the model but when I tried it on I'm 5'1 and I had to trim 7 1/2 inches off. It's also a little see through. Over all.... I wish it was better than it is and it sits more in my drawer than on my body.
1.0,The item came earlier than promised.  It is not true to size.  Much too small
1.0,"We received the watch and the lights worked, but the clock wasn't displayed.  Where is the quality assurance on the watch.  My 3 year old was very disappointed that she couldn't wear her watch."
1.0,This is not at all a winner jacket. Very thin and appears to be cheaply made. Didn't even bother trying it on when I saw and felt how this it was.
1.0,Did not help my feet at all very disappointed
1.0,"The material was awful! To thin, almost can see through it. not at all what I expected. Poor quality. Not nothing like the picture."
1.0,Way too small in length. Returned
1.0,"IGNORE the useless, misleading ""sizing chart"" in this listing! What appear to be Euro sizes listed ARE NOT! They are the cm measurements or something. I wear a women's US size 10, Euro size 40/41, so heel to toe about 9.5 inches. What arrived measures SIX INCHES heel to toe, with an ankle opening CLEARLY only usable by small children."
1.0,The straps are horribly mangled and looks like someone ripped then off and tried to sew them back on. 0 stars. So disappointed bc its a cute bag
1.0,"Received this product in a scuffed up,ripped, dirty plastic bag. No box, no outer wrapper. This coat was grossly misrepresented.<br />Thin scratchy outer material, polyester lining for pockets and the ruff looked like wet road kill hair. Was not at all as pictured."
1.0,"A little saggy reminds me of a nun , I returned it"
1.0,Order a XXL based on the size chart however it's not accurate at all.  The XL would be more appropriate  for fitting.  The look of it though is amazing
1.0,This was way to small.
1.0,THIS PRODUCT TURNED COLORS WITHIN 3 DAYS ON MY WRIST! Also it was very difficult to get on and off!
1.0,It’s huge doesn’t even fit me
1.0,Dress is nothing at all like shown or described
1.0,"was nothing like I had ordered, would fit a child the sizing was completely off"
1.0,It did not meet my expectations.
1.0,They’re huge and cheaply made<br />No way<br />Don’t waste the time trying to return it either<br /><br />Aweful
1.0,"These are awful. Super thin, don't stay up and run very small. I wouldn't recommend these at all."
1.0,"The ""statement necklace"" broke within a few minutes, thought i could wear it for just a day but guess not, (was for my beyonce in formation costume) 😣😣😣"
1.0,"Fitting chart is horribly incorrect, these things fit so loose that they give zero compression, the surrendering them absolutely useless"
1.0,These do not fit true to size I ordered an extra large and it fits like a medium so just be forewarned they do not fit. I cant even wear it wasted money.
1.0,"I was expecting a belt that would hold my pants in place, whether I was wearing thicker-heavier """"bluejeans"",light travel pants, or in between.  This is not the belt. It came in a generic length, which in my case meant that there was an extra 6-7 inches of length not needed and therefore had to be tucked away through belt loops. Further, the belt would not maintain the set length if I was engaging in an activity that involved bending and stretching, and it is a pain to reset the desired length. In short. You can do better in a belt and at much less cost."
1.0,These were highly recommended to me by a friend. The crotch seam unraveled on the 1st day I wore them & was sad to have to return them as defective. I immediately ordered another pair & again they unraveled in the same spot. I loved how they felt & fit - but cannot recommend them.
1.0,"Cheap material didn't even hold up when I tried packing it the first time. Also, unless you wear very small bras, they will not fit in this bag."
1.0,It was a gift and broke the first day
1.0,"The top was too short, the bottoms fit fine, but the fabric is so cheesy that the moment you get in the water and move it just creeps up your bottom. Cute in the photo, but cheaply made and not comfortable at all. If I hadn’t worn it to swim in I would definitely have returned it. Before getting in the pool it seemed like it might work, but once wet, it clearly did not. Very disappointing."
1.0,"The material is cheap.  Also, the cut of the dress was odd.  I am 5'3 and weigh 130 pounds.  My arms and neck were swimming in this dress."
1.0,Wore them once. Washed on hand wash cycle.  Hole at top band.  I have purchased multiple compression socks from multiple vendors via Amazon and have never had this happen before.
1.0,"The sleeves are hemmed a few inches above the wrist, which is strange.  If you roll them up to mid-forearm they look okay, but you'll need to add a few stitches them hold them in place since the fabric is so thin.  The length of the dress is fine with 2-3&quot; heels and will drag a touch in flats (I'm 5'7&quot;).  I love a summery floral dress, but this seems a bit matronly on.  The flower print doesn't line up on the back seam, which makes this unwearably sheer dress look even cheaper.  If you have a knee length slip to go under this dress, it might work.  If not, please don't even think about it.  The fabric is so thin and clingy that even without one, it was a nightmare for static.  So much for a cheeky, flowy, summer dress.  It's not worth the effort."
1.0,Sizes don't match! I ordered a small and they send me XS so then I ordered a Medium and received a Small.
1.0,wasting of money.
1.0,Those silver pieces come off very easily and thought I'd might lose them and they are very flimsy. It even looked like someone cut out the Cowboys star by hand and stuck it to the case! Returned for full refund!
1.0,polyester.....YUCK...returned.....also came with tag cut out and waited 3 weeks to receive.
1.0,Too hard to get on & off
1.0,Material is cheap and once you figure out how to put it on it does not line up and is super I’ll fitting. Wouldn’t recommend and wish I would’ve returned
1.0,"This outfit was way too large and the baby couldn't wear it for Thanksgiving. This should really be sized for at least 6 months, not 0-3."
1.0,The female mask is a nice simple lace mask but the male mask is a harder mask and it was cracked up the middle.
1.0,"I can't give this low enough. It didn't work and after order was complete and received, I have an inappropriate bondage picture for that product on my account. I have never ordered anything like that."
1.0,"It looks great but it's way too big for a 5 yr old, It was in the kid section and he will have to be 10 or 12 before it will fit him"
1.0,The pieces wouldn't stay hooked on to the watch and now that we got it to the pieces to take it off broke off now its stuck on my watch !!
1.0,Came out of the package already broken.  So flimsy they are destined to break
1.0,This dress is beautiful but is made of very poor quality. The zipper broke the first time I tried it on. I was super bummed because I loved the way it looked on.
1.0,As soon as u sweat it moves all over the place and unsticks
1.0,"I wish I had seen Morgan's review before I bought this.  It is a train wreck!  The picture shows something with gradient color.<br />Plus, I have NO idea what the lumpish growth of cloth is on the right hand side (under the model's hand).  It doesn't show on the picture but was a real shock when received!  Since caftans are often purchased by women trying to hide flaws, this is a major &#34;design flaw&#34;......it adds a LOT of weight to the hip and thigh section."
1.0,Way too small! It would only fit a child. Would not reccomend getting it unless it is for your little girl.
1.0,"This is by no means a chiffon style. The fabric is rough, itchy, heavy and just overall weird."
1.0,This shirt runs extremely small and is very thin.  However the dealbreaker was the horrific chemical smell!!!!  Even after trying to wash it it’s still lingered. It was nauseating and the shirt was bagged up and returned
1.0,Did not care for fabric and the dress did not fit anywhere.
1.0,"These are advertised as ""gripper"" socks but there is no grip. Disappointed - that is why I ordered them."
1.0,"The blouse is beautiful, just as seen on the website, it is literity paper thin and runs in very small sizes."
1.0,Don’t like it. It’s itchy uncomfortable!
1.0,This hat is made for a child.<br />Not comfortable  for adults.
1.0,"I don't even really know what to say here. Honestly, I didn't even get one wear out of it. It literally could have fit my 7 year old. The picture depicts it as a loose fitting tank. No. Lol. No. It wouldn't even be loose on my 7 year old. Also, no tags, no seams, strings hanging off it. Horrid. It looks quite literally like someone took a piece of fabric a cut it with kitchen scissors into the basic shape of a tank. I realize it was very low priced, but I would have felt like a thief charging a dime for this. Unbelievable. I'm so disappointed."
1.0,I loved the look of the shoe.  Very uncomfortable after 4 hours on feet.
1.0,It says small but is big and you make it appear as if you get both mommy and me dresses but you don’t. Cheaply made
1.0,Earring fell out of my 8 year old's ear and got lost after only a week. Clasp does not close strongly.
1.0,"The velcro wore out in a couple months, and they aren't the main shoes worn either. Worn maybe 10 times."
1.0,not a fan WAY TOO SMALL i got a size medium and the cups are so close together and prob would fit a a/b cup.
1.0,Product was too small and the fabric stitching was coming undone before I even tried it on.  I was very disappointed because I thought it was so cute!
1.0,This dress is horribly/poorly made!!  Returned!!!
1.0,Would not stay up on ear.
1.0,Cute but not worth the money.
1.0,The bow and eyelashes fell off within days of wear. Dont buy.
1.0,cheep product it is very cruddy. and irritating on the skin
1.0,Ordered a 3XL to get a loose fit. I am 6ft 210 lbs with a broad chest and usually wear an XL - however this shirt although labeled as 3XL is really a large size for normal men. The quality of material is superior but size is not what is advertized .  Decided to give them to my son who is 5'11 and takes a medium shirt.
1.0,This sucks its so cheap ...iv gotten better ones at flea markets ....just horrible
1.0,The buckle on both shoes are defective! Seriously?!
1.0,It's cut very small.
1.0,"No shape at all, fit like a bag or a prison uniform"
1.0,Unfortunately this was a waste of money and it went straight to the garbage.
1.0,Looks really cheap!  I love inexpensive but have spent less for better looking products.
1.0,Way too small for adult. Ordered Ex-Large. That’s what it was labeled. But it was way too small maybe it’s for a child.<br />Also the customer service is poor. They wanted me to jump through hoops. I said refund my money and they did. I really don’t like being demanding
1.0,"Dress didn't look like the picture, was dirty and smelled terrible."
1.0,One shoe arrived not working!
1.0,"In order for the straps to fit comfortably on my feet, my heel has to hang off the edges."
1.0,I received it with clasp broke..
1.0,"To big for my face ,"
1.0,Brand new Apple 7 series 45 mm watch was damaged when my husband tried to close the cover of this band. Silicone piece that you have to put around the watch in order for it to fit makes it nearly impossible to close it. Do not buy!
1.0,Posts are extremely LONG. Uncomfortable.
1.0,"looks very cheap, returned"
1.0,This belt completely peeled apart the second time I wore it so I would not recommend it .. I went to DDs discounts and got three that was true leather and they've held up for three months now and I only paid $15 for three of them
1.0,It says it works for a daith earing and it doesnt.
1.0,"It was really stylish, but only kept time for 1 day. I guess you get what you pay for!"
1.0,Not how the picture looks. It is boxy and Cheap fabric. Returning it.
1.0,Not a fan of these. Did nothing for support for my breasts. It held them together and kept them from looking opposite directions...but ZERO lift.
1.0,These appear nice but gems dont stay threaded and I lost em all n just got em they are too loose and dont stay threaded not happy
1.0,Quality not remotely comparable to the original apple band.  Thinner and not sturdy.
1.0,I bought the largest size and it would only fit a size 10-12 adult according to US sizing.  This is Chinese/Asian sizing.
1.0,Translucent and hard fabric
1.0,I'm very disappointed. I received these earrings--which are beautiful--as a Christmas gift and wore them often. Today I discovered that a pearl had fallen out of the setting and is lost.
1.0,Sizes are mislabeled. I ordered a 3xl and it fit like a large.
1.0,Just not tight enough to work on my wrist
1.0,"Price too good to be true for a reason. When I got them, they smelled like some petroleum product (kerosene). Even after washing a few times, the smell was still there. I shouldn't have been surprised by the incredibly poor quality when they shipped from China."
1.0,I was too late in returning but won’t have my child use these. They don’t cancel noise enough.
1.0,This is NOT true to size. Very disappointing.
1.0,VERY BAD QUALITY...GUYS DONT BUY IT VERY CHEAP QUALITY..!!
1.0,"See my other review under the Wolf designs deep jewelry tray.  These products are overpriced and better values on in-drawer jewelry storage can be found on other websites. (Search for a set of 2 in drawer silver safekeeper and you'll find a better value product.) This lid didn't properly fit my deep tray enough to ""seal"" it, which means the anti tarnish lining won't be very effective. lame."
1.0,"Poorly made. Feels like a rip-off. They took wire and put material over it. The ear muffs are poorly made, they don't adjust so they don't fit....I want my money back."
1.0,Fell apart after the first hand washing!
1.0,The bars are conglomorous things that are severely uncomfortable to wear with or without a bra... They catch on everything from seatbelts to your own arms and shirt
1.0,Very very small would fit a child.  Very disappointed !
1.0,"The product description states the Primitive Wing Foldable Polar Fleece Earmuffs are foldable and adjustable. The pair I recieved are neither. They cover pretty well, but I can't fold them and put them in my coat pocket and they do not adjust.  They are a little bulky compared to my others. I don't know if I got the correct product because the writing on the package was all Chinese."
1.0,Tight in shoulder area does not look as presented on picture
1.0,The clasp on this necklace is terrible. I think is backwards. Beautiful looking terribly made. Will return
1.0,"Cheap,came crushed"
1.0,"I was not impressed with the quality of this dress. the material was super thin and felt cheap. I’m a 36DD, 5’3, 145lbs, so naturally I size up with anything with functional buttons. It was way too big in the chest area so I probably could have done a medium. The length came to about my knees. I expected it to be a little shorter. However, I did not repurchase due to the quality of the dress."
1.0,"Did I even get the right item?? Its way short, completely see thru, the neck isn't even hemmed? Very disappointed and returning.  I feel like I can usually trust the reviews but not on this :/"
1.0,I got this outfit for my grand daughter’s end of the school year celebration...I was very disappointed in the quality of the manufacturer and quality of the material and it was not true to size ☹️
1.0,"The coat was too big thru the chest and stomach area,but the arm holes were tiny.Could not get my arm in at all.I think wrong arms were sewed into this coat.I was not able to return because UPS would not accept package after I went on line and got return code to print label.They said take to Post Office.They had closed for the day and time had run out.Oh well  I am out $$$$$$."
1.0,Go too fast . 10 seconds a day .
1.0,Received product that was worn. Scratched on leather and dirt on the heels. Picture shows a contrasting brown for the lines on the boot. The ones I received had same color for lines. Fits true to size
1.0,These fell apart so easily. Probably the worst cheaply made shoes I’ve bought
1.0,"Not as pictured, seams are different. Material feelslike 1970s polyester. Elastic rolls in the waist band. Not impressed at all...I was just looking for quick and easy and I can't wear these out of the house."
1.0,"I’m 5’2 and 115lbs. The bottom fit fine, but the top is WAY too big. I ordered a small, and the top said small on the tag, but it was absurdly large. Another review said the same thing but i had hoped they corrected the problem. Will have to return."
1.0,All of the Bracelets were too big  bracelets were too big. Just would fall off my arm.
1.0,super odd shape....
1.0,Cheaply made and it did not fit properly. Ordered a medium and it was a medium through the torso but a small in the arms. I would not recommend this product.
1.0,I'd love to know where parents get the necklaces that look just like these that actually last for more than a couple of weeks. The two I ordered here were absolute pieces of trash. Do not buy.
1.0,Defective. Even if you're over 6' tall and wear 6&quot; heels this would still be too long.
1.0,"This would have been a nice set of rings, but had a stone missing on my favorite ring. Very disappointing"
1.0,Perfect!! I also have the T-shirt to match!! Dave Chappell Rocks!!
1.0,"It was too big , I didn’t like it ,,"
1.0,"We like the shirt, but once we removed it from the plastic we found a hole in the shoulder were the seam wasn't seam completely in the section.  I don't know that I have time to return and place an order for a new one (exchange not an option) before Christmas.  I am going to try to sew the section myself.  This one slipped pasted quality control.  :-("
1.0,"I have bought 2 of these, had to return 1. It is ahead and does not keep accurate time."
1.0,I could not get this out of my nose. I had to go to a piercer and get it removed. Horrible.
1.0,"Ordered this because it was mentioned as highly adjustable. I’m a 46ddd and this didn’t fit at all. Couldn’t even get it on to zip it up.<br />Material was much more flimsy than I expected. I thought it would be a thicker material for support, but it’s like a satin stretchy material."
1.0,"I love my Apple leather magnetic loops, but also want a nice cheap band with the durability of silicone, so I thought I’d try this. The listing does not make clear that it’s not made up of two straps. It’s literally a loop, which makes it extremely ill-fitting where the loop folds. Worse yet, the magnets are WEAK.<br />Do not buy this."
1.0,This product is very big and uncomfortable.
1.0,"Son bonitos,pero realmente de muy baja calidad,y bueno no se puede esperar más con ese precio!!"
1.0,"No pockets, one large opening"
1.0,Started to peel and fall apart in less than 2 months.
1.0,"Maybe it's just not made for a petite frame, but this was nothing like the picture.  It was huge, cheap, had no drape, just baggy."
1.0,Was cute but more for a teen. Too small
1.0,"Not wearable out of the box, all button threads were loose, and some button slits were not stitched so it was just a small tear in fabric for button to go through, hood is useless as it fits like a yamica, absolutely Terrible waste of money, didn't get a chance to wear or wash so I can't comment on that, unable to return as my dog chose to lay on it and fur stuck to it so looks worn...oh well, at least it was cheap so wasn't like wasting a lot of money."
1.0,Returned clasp did not work. The sad part was this was a gift.  Vey embarrassing
1.0,The earing was so cheap by the look plus it had scratchs ...I wanted to do a return but I jst threw it in the gabbage.Not worth the trouble.
1.0,Item is a lot smaller than advertised.
1.0,Did not get what I was expecting. Very unsatisfied.
1.0,I bought this for my wife and when i received it it was torn and the stiching was coming apart.  I have tryed to reach amazon about an exchange but never heard anything.  The package said new product but i feel it was now a waste of money.
1.0,"Although I looked really cute for a night on the town, this choker limited my ability to move my head up and down. It was such a problem that I couldn’t look down to see the menu. Also, it’s very hard to connect to the clasp in the back of the neck.  I would not recommend this item!"
1.0,"Not worth waiting for. It took about a month for it to get here, and then it didn’t even fit and one of the gems fell out as I put it back in the package."
1.0,Do not order<br />It won’t come.  I’ve ordered this twice and both times it supposedly got lost.  At least they refunded my money back.  Very sad as it looks so cute.
1.0,"I do not like the red color, it is not bright as in the picture"
1.0,"Shirt is baggy with thin fabric. The description says slim fit, but this fits like a regular fit. It reminds me of an elementary school art class smock."
1.0,"The graphic on the back feels like solid plastic or rubber, like a tarp. And sounds like a tarp or thick flag flapping when you touch it. We laughed in disbelief. No joke. Literally. Do not buy. You will be returning."
1.0,Only have the watch for a few days and its gorgeous however the box it came in was destroyed and the face is actually a pale baby pink instead of white.<br />Update: The links of the band have turned green/black. Yuck!
1.0,"I was extremely disappointed when I received this. It looks like it is sparkly/bejeweled, and even the name of the item says ""glitter store purple gold bling"" which implies it will be glittery. This was the whole reason I bought it. But it is simply a really blurry image of sparkles (white spots) on a dark thin cloth - looks kind of like a crappy looking starry sky.  Not sparkly or brightly colored as pictured. Very false advertising. In addition, it is really thin and tiny, should be labeled as a mask for children, not adults. I contacted the seller twice to ask about returning it, and they never contacted me back. I filed a claim with Amazon - not sure if it will do any good. Crappy product, crappy seller. DO NOT BUY."
1.0,They are too flimsy. Not exactly what I would call a shoe or even a slipper  Wish I remembered to return them
1.0,"Cheaply sewn, not a normal size. Long and skinny"
1.0,My daughter was very disappointed with this necklace. It started unraveling only within a few wearings.
1.0,Too big for my feet
1.0,Battery life is about an hour
1.0,I had one of these bags in a soft brown and got this to replace it.  This one looked like plastic.  There was nothing stylish about it.
1.0,"I really liked this dress when I got it.  The fit was as expected, it had a cute print and it was a nice style.  I would have rated it five stars at that time.<br /><br />Two washes later and I have to throw it out.  Completely pilled and it looks awful.  I wish I had a better review to give....would have loved to have been able to keep wearing this one!"
1.0,Sheads
1.0,They’re nice but one wash and they’re broken
1.0,No valen la pena
1.0,Falling apart straight out of the package.
1.0,"They where to long also they had a big black spot on leg, I thought they where new"
1.0,"They shipped us the wrong colored watch. It doesn't seem to want to keep time accurately even though my husbands winds it up faithfully. Seems rather cheaply made, yes it's a cheap watch. You get what you paid for."
1.0,"Very cheap material. Sewn cheaply, printed cheaply, and colors are not as pictured. I would have taken pictures but, this suit didn’t cover anything!!!!!"
1.0,False advertising!  Watch is not a Russian military aviator and the band is not leather. Don't waste money.
1.0,Didn’t get a chance to enjoy my project that I was so excited to try. It’s unfortunate but I was sent a used/ returned item. This so upsetting. Buyers beware and inspect your packaging.
1.0,Not good burst easily
1.0,"The sleeves are hardly sewn to the body of the sweater.  So is the neck part. Haven't been able to wear it even once, it is so cheaply made."
1.0,This is cheap product not worth 6 bucks!
1.0,Loved the visor but it is large and does not fit properly.
1.0,"I ordered one of each color, and ordered a size larger than usual - an XL vs large. I usually wear a medium to large in shirts being a 38c. I didn't want anything tight across my breasts and wanted to also account for any shrinkage in the wash. The XL is definitely more of a medium right out of the bag, not a bit of give at all, either."
1.0,"This is cheap and plastic feeling. Don't waste your money, there are much better options out there."
1.0,"The jacket is very pretty, but the size is outrageously small. Ordered a 2X, and it is a men' medium. Crazy. I could give it to my grandson (5 yrs) but sleeves are too long."
1.0,"The pants are very good except for the small, cheap zipper, which gave up after first 2 days - no longer stays closed. I was on a long trip & had to wear my shirt out to hide open fly. The zipper is perhaps appropriate for a girl's skirt, not sporty 'rugged' men's pants. I would return them if I could."
1.0,They are too small for an adult face..  the fabric is very rough
1.0,"I was so sad to get 4 sets of these in the mail only to realize the “champagne” is not champagne at all, it’s pink!!!! So frustrating"
1.0,Ordered extra large which I ordered up way to small material horrible cheap sleeves so small my arms could not get in.
1.0,"If you need a close to the neck t-shirt don't buy these.  I received these yesterday and immediately realized that the neck has a European style cut to it.  The shirts sat off my neck and onto my shoulders by about 2 inches and the top of my chest was exposed, again by about 2 inches.  Not a big deal for most people but when worn under a uniform shirt is looks like crap."
1.0,This first time I put it on the seam came completely unraveled. These aren’t the quality I was looking for in a tank and I would not recommend them.
1.0,"Poor quality. 1 broke immediately, another within a day."
1.0,Not happy with this product.
1.0,Way to small not at all fitted correctly or flattering to my body
1.0,It looked Cheap looking.  And even though I bought the right size it ran too small. Such a waste of money. I'm really disappointed. :(
1.0,These sandals fell apart the first time I wore them.  They were returned & replaced with another pair.  The second pair arrived already defective...the Velcro strap stitching was loose.  This pair will be returned.  My refund has already been issued.  Thank you!
1.0,"It's so tight it practically touches your eyeballs. If you have an average ""adult size"" head, you really can't blink. Do not recommend, even for a small amount of time as a costume."
1.0,For a sports bra it fit in some aspects but provided no support for a larger breasted woman.  I ordered a 4x because I’m a 40DDD. It was extremely loose and bouncy in the front. Particularly the straps. Had I went down a size it would have been too tight around.
1.0,"These were very badly made, crap quality."
1.0,It's said that it's water proof; not at all! My daughter had an accident in the middle of the night and peed all over her bed. I bought those in case something like this had happened to not have a lot of mess but the pants did not help at all. Waist of money!
1.0,not nice
1.0,"I bought these on the recommendation of a friend to keep the mask off my face.  When I got them, they seemed small and they were, its like they were made to fit the face of elementary kids. My teenagers didn't like them and said they were too small for them too. Pretty disappointed, I actually threw them away."
1.0,Looks like it came from a candy machine
1.0,Very disappointed!!!! My son was very excited to get this! Only to find that the pendant will go onto the necklace because the clamp is too big go through the loop! Giving it a one star because the pendant and the chain are of great quality! That’s the only reason! Contacting the seller hopefully we can work this out.
1.0,have to return its just too small.
1.0,"I wanted to love it, but I've only worn it for 2 days and already the elastic is fraying. I will probably have to restring it.<br />UPDATE - within an hour after I wrote this review, it broke.  I'm sorry to say I have requested a refund.  I have previously purchased another set by another seller which contained 2 bracelets (one tiger eye and one lava stone with tiger eye - both Chakra) and my grown boys have been wearing them daily for weeks and they have held up - I think I will buy another set for myself."
1.0,Product not made very well and has already broke
1.0,"Not the best quality, does not do any justice as a pair of sun glasses when out in the sun."
1.0,"I’m so sad, I really wanted to like this shirt. In my mind it had the perfect mix of neutral colors (the beige and white), a cute pattern (the stripes and leopard 🐆 print) and a casual fit. Unfortunately this shirt is anything but perfect. The color is the weirdest shade of beige I’ve ever seen in my life. Can you tell from the photos I’m sharing? It’s almost too light to be brown and too dark to be a real beige. The stripes and leopard print are cute, I think they surprisingly work together... BUT the sleeves of the shirt are sooo long. They’re not made for a woman with average sized arms. Finally the fit is so weird too. Almost too baggy in the chest area and too tights towards the bottom of the shirt. Weird! I got it on sale but I still returned it because I knew this was going to be one of those shirts that go to die in my closet and I’d end up never wearing."
1.0,If I had got the leather shoe I ordered it would’ve probably got a good rating. The shoe that I got was a vinyl shoe and I can’t even find anybody that wants it very disappointed. The picture is not what you get at all.
1.0,"It was over-sized, sleeves were too short and 2 buttons fell off the first 2 times i wore it..."
1.0,These glasses look nothing like the picture. The lens is black not smoky brown and the are plastic looking. Not my style.
1.0,It wasn't like I expected at all once it came it was too big!!
1.0,Order a large first time. Was to small so I returned and ordered an x-large. Seller sent a large again. Returned and tried  again for an x-large. Again seller sent just a large. Contacted Amazon and tried again. Received top today. Yep. Just a large🤬 I give up!!!
1.0,Poorly made. Thin.
1.0,"Runs large, which wasn’t the big issue. The white fabric is completely see through to the point that we will only be able to wear it as a beach cover up over a bathingsuit since I’m not going to put a bra on my 4 year old who is 40” tall and weighs 31 lb. definitely not worth the price for the quality of the fabric."
1.0,Nothing that comes from China EVER fits 😢 I have had to stop buying clothes on Amazon
1.0,"I wear 34"" waist size normally and bought XL. Still too tight."
1.0,Not at all comfortable
1.0,"Quality was not good, was more of a coral color than red, was pretty much a belly shirt."
1.0,We wanted to long to return it so we ended up giving it to someone else. I bought this for my dad who has wide hands and they were to small
1.0,Returned. Very bulky
1.0,"I purchased thejumper in yellow, it was suppose to be tight around the midsection, (like leggings or a bodysuit) unfortunately it is the SAME size from the foot part to the shoulders. Just too wide. Not like the photo. I was hopping to wear this but it looks like a clowns suit."
1.0,Bought a small and literally did nothing when placed on. My stomach looks no flatter so I’m not even going to bother wearing for 30 days as it’s already not doing what it’s supposed to
1.0,The color bleeds on my clothing runs small
1.0,"The material is very, very thin.  The back is also not as pictured.  When I opened the package I was struck with a strong chemical smell.  Even if the top fit as described, I would return it because of the smell.  I was disappointed."
1.0,"Terrible, the reflective strip has zero flexibility.<br />It’s like having a belt under your chest👎🏻"
1.0,It is freezing in CT right now.  I got these gloves to walk my dog.  I put them on outside and there was literally no difference from when I had bare hands.  ZERO PROTECTION FROM THE COLD.  ZERO.
1.0,The suit fit my body but the bust section was so small that it felt like my breasts were going to pop out if I moved.  I will NOT be wearing this suit in public! 😳
1.0,Tore after one wash
1.0,Broke as soon as it arrived and looks very cheap.
1.0,Turned my granddaughter arm green
1.0,To pricey and not what expected.
1.0,The way it fits on the shoulders is not correct it’s cut really Boxee
1.0,"Tried to return this because either did not fit, they said the delivery fees was higher than the item and to give it to family/friend."
1.0,The Ohio Flag is wrong - the circle colors are backward.  Unsure how someone can make that obvious of a mistake....
1.0,Very Cheap Material. I was expecting something totally different.
1.0,"I ordered these glasses because I got a new prescription, and my eyes are filinally identical -- so readers should have worked for me.  These don't.  The lenses are not clear, but blurry!<br /><br />NO RETURNS, so I can't send them back!"
1.0,"Very poor quality.  Solid pieces have metal casting marks.  Chains are flat(!) and stiff, and will not lie down on tie.  Loops that connect solid part to chain have sharp, exposed ends."
1.0,Crap. I am leaving feedback on this and 1 other item from the same seller. The nice little gem in the middle of the stone came off when my wife opened them for the first time on Christmas. The stone for this one was no where to be found.
1.0,"Way too small, I have thicker tee shirts."
1.0,The clip that attaches to the face mask is too difficult to open and doesn't hold in place.
1.0,Made every adjustment possible and still got an instant migraine
1.0,I was told i was buying 12 pairs but only got delivered 6 pairs 😡
1.0,Design was not true. Zipper broke first day we got it.
1.0,Sleeves were too tight
1.0,This is not the Ferguson tartan. As you can see in the photo I uploaded the Ferguson tartan has red that is missing from this product
1.0,The top was perfect .. the bottoms were way to small ! I got an XL and they fit like a M/L
1.0,Product was not as described.  It is not a sweat shirt and had a weird cut.  I was looking forward to wearing this shirt but was extremely dissatisfied.
1.0,These are not hypoallergenic. They made my ears itchy and red.
1.0,"There is only 1 cuff which is located at the bottom of the ear. The top is suppose to rest on your ear, but it doesn't. It constantly falls & will not stay in place."
1.0,Got the small US measures but felt like large
1.0,Wayyyyyyyyy to small. You better order three or four sizes larger
1.0,I did not realize that it comes without the buckle pieces.
1.0,"Poor quality! Fit odd , shirt in length 🤷🏾‍♀️"
1.0,I'm 5'9 210 and this shirt was still to small for me. Plus the color of the shirt is lighter than what is shown in the picture.
1.0,"Horrible material, wasn't a nice snug fit. Made me sweat more than usual."
1.0,Mens XL was more like a Womans S
1.0,The  size was not as described! The largest was only 14&#34;x10&#34;. The color was not as nice as photos. The quality is poor. Very disappointed all around.
1.0,Will not order this top again.
1.0,They are almost like one time use only.<br />Disappointed.
1.0,Felt cheap. The material was terrible.
1.0,Fan didn’t work even after trying so many times.
1.0,Fell apart first day I used it....
1.0,"Already falling apart and I haven't even worn it, snags everywhere."
1.0,ThusFar Midi Dresses for Women - Cute Bowknot Short Sleeve Solid Bodycon Dress Yellow-Large<br />awful fabric
1.0,"These bras were like trying to struggle in and out of a straight jacket.  They were not the wrong size for me, they are made having to go over your head and shoulders even when the clasp in the back is open."
1.0,I bought this leggings and I love it but in this particular case the scrunched part it's bad sewed and almost the elastic ripped and unfortunately I can return it so I stuck with this legging that I can even use!!
1.0,No no no. Very cheesy looking in this color of blue. Maybe go with black.
1.0,These cardboard cut outs are very flimsy and rubbishy. The price is very expensive for what they really are. Do not waste your money buying this.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:3b498dca6f67920a2cd324ede594a09b]] Arrived broken
1.0,"It took me a long time to find an Apple Watch 3 (42mm) strap that would fit my large wrist.  This one purported to be long-enough to work, and I was very careful about the measurement of both my wrist AND the measurements listed for this particular strap.<br /><br />As it turns out, what arrived is exactly the same length as the original, very-nice-but-far-too-short, silicone strap that came with my Apple Watch 3, so I’m disappointed and back to searching for a decent, XL strap—a very difficult item to find for my particular watch.<br /><br />I will say that this is a really nicely made strap for the money.  The dark brown color actually works beautifully with my Space Gray watch.  I like it.  It’s quality seems surprising high for the amount I paid.  It attached to the watch perfectly and is quite andsome to look at.  The padded leather appears to be of a quality that’d be both durable and quite comfortable to wear, if it happens to fit you.  (And it will fit anyone with an ordinary sized wrist.)  I seems to have extraordinary wrists.  Too bad."
1.0,I ordered this item and received a black turtleneck!
1.0,It is NOT round..It's extremely uncomfortable and oval..Large oval..Definitely will not be buying another..Unless you have a giant mouth keep it moving lol..👎👎👎👎😏
1.0,Bad material! It is like a toy.
1.0,I will loved to buy but doesn’t include the battery !
1.0,"Got the size that was SUPPOSED to fit, but the dize is not as advertised. Disappointing!"
1.0,Way smaller then expected will not work for either piercing bought for.
1.0,The description states that it's 925 silver if it is it's only plated. It's hard to see in the pics but I only bought about 3 months ago and it's already changed to a rose gold color. If I had known I would have worn it accordingly but now it's going in the trash very disappointed. Definitely wouldn't give as a gift
1.0,I ordered this product in a two extra large it wouldn't fit in my eight-year-old niece who is small
1.0,They come off easy and it doesn’t work on big boobs
1.0,Product ate way to small
1.0,I'm not sure what this shirt is made of! Never felt or seen before...Terrible!
1.0,This must be sized for children or real skeleton like folks .  I am 5’2” 150 lbs and this fit like a body glove.  I read reviews that said otherwise and that is the only reason I wrote this! Quality is great but sizing is way way off!
1.0,Sheer...very thin..necklace is nice
1.0,I was so excited to open this. Only to find out it's too wide to fit my watch. Extremely disappointed
1.0,"Doesn't provide the slouchy look, small, and is falling apart."
1.0,This item is nothing like the picture. It's just a (very stinky) black cotton mask. Don't waste your money.
1.0,It his children I guess cuz you can't get it around adult neck and it's not wide enough and not sturdy enough
1.0,Completely broken
1.0,"Nowhere near the description, embossing was off center and the cuff wouldn't even wrap the top of the arm much less wrap around, made for a little kid not adult cosplay. Not recommended."
1.0,The color is more grey than plum in an ugly way. The zipper fabric is an odd pink color. The straps are too short on the one attached upon opening and way too long with the strap included inside the bag. This purse was a huge disappointment.
1.0,I wore one twice and the band strap that holds the little end down broke<br />So I switched to the other band and the same thing happened along with it peeling the color off.  Very cheaply made!
1.0,not as pictured.  very small = for a child
1.0,Whoa this is itchy and VERRRRY small. I have a regular length torso and it was tight. I’m 5’4 130lbs and it was incredibly small. No stretch!
1.0,These shirt props were uncomfortable and also didn't really do the job of keeping the shirt clean looking
1.0,Large holes that cannot be fixed.  This is what it looked like when opened
1.0,They do not look like the photo. The photo shows a solid purple and these have white bands. I ordered them because I thought they were a solid purple color.
1.0,They were tight on my arms and I might have big legs but I surely do not have large arms. Great for 10 year olds I'm guessing? Complete waste of money as I couldn't find anyone to give them away to.
1.0,Straps were small- wouldn't fit- had to return them
1.0,Fits hella weird and look cheap.
1.0,when i opened these the first thing i noticed was the paint on the silver part of the sides was already messed up and was peeling like they were years old and worn out. not at all what i expected...
1.0,Clips are too small to fit in cloth masks.<br />But beads are very pretty
1.0,Too small. Very disappointed.
1.0,"This was not a flannel shirt at all, this was an ugly polyester shirt with odd sewing and irregular lines. Do not order this shirt."
1.0,Runs small and fabric is slinky like a slip
1.0,This wristband does not fit the Gear Fit 2. Sent it back.
1.0,The ugliest earrings on the planet!
1.0,Lobster clasp does not work
1.0,Wasn’t moisture wicking or a compression top. They were too short. I sent them back.
1.0,One of the two gloves was almost entirely unraveled at the seam when i took it out of the box. It needs about four inches of sewing to be useable. It’s beautiful and soft but entirely not useable.
1.0,This product is does not seem stitched together well and does not appear well made
1.0,These shoes are horrible.  They are nothing like their other shoes.  They hurt my feet terrible.  The tongue of the shoes has so much material it hurt the top of my foot
1.0,Fits like a large shirt no pleats in it and it looked nothing like the picture
1.0,"Watch not working upon arrival. Can't set time, unable to move hour and minute hands"
1.0,Cheap looking and drained battery so I cannot rate this watch no more than one star!
1.0,"I think these types of sellers misbehave the reputation of Amazon as you receive an item with low quality or slightly different from the image on the website, it is acceptable but if there is problem in item or  does not work as this watch that  is not acceptable at all and is considered fraud Commercial and must stop dealing with these sellers"
1.0,This product said it was for women but is so small there is no way it will fit an adult ear.
1.0,Loved the look and fit of the shirt. But the logo and lettering started fading after just 2 times of wearing. I ended up being rather disappointed for the price I expected this shirt to last much longer than that.
1.0,These do not work at all! Such a rip off . DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. This company can suck It
1.0,Material was very cheap and thin. Returned immediately
1.0,Flimsy and not supportive at all. Returned.
1.0,This is WAY to small for a belly ring. Save your money. This is twice now Amazon has fooled me on size of jewlery. Shame on me. I’m done trying to order jewlery from Amazon.
1.0,Gaudy...this thing is so huge I am not kidding; it's going back ASAP! On the site it looks cute but when I go it I would be embarrassed to wear it in public...I got matching bracelet the bracelet it doable!!
1.0,"Very poor quality, and very flat looking in color and sparkle. Extremely fake looking!!! Very disappointed, going straight into the Goodwill pile."
1.0,"Earrings bend while being fastened.  I'll be surprised if earrings don't break while being fastened.  Earrings not worth $23, in my opinion -- more like $5...  Earrings looked like quality in the picture.  They are not quality."
1.0,Very disappointed. It says take to dry cleaners and yet this still happens. Images disappeared the lady at the cleaners apologized and didn't charge me but this is ridiculous
1.0,Horrible the pins don't come out. So crappie.
1.0,"The shirt definitely does not match the description in the posting. It is not tie-dyed - the material is a print that emulates a tie-dyed pattern (reading the one visible review - odd how I can’t see the other 3 - and hearing how it worked for the other buyer I figured I wouldn’t mind it either, but it just looks bad in person). The listing says the shirt is a cotton blend so I was expecting a soft cotton with a little stretch. It’s 30% polyester so it’s very silky & attracts a ton of static. The listing does not indicate that dry cleaning is recommended as per the care label. Additionally, sizing runs a bit small. I ordered up for an oversized fit that I could tie at my waist but the shirt is not oversized enough to allow that. The overall design is so great so I’m very disappointed with the product in person."
1.0,Very poorly made.  I’ve worn it once and it has started unraveling in a lot of areas.
1.0,Poorly made.  Broke just trying to open and close for the first time.
1.0,"This material was terrible and the dress itself was oddly sized, too small in some areas too large in others but all in all a total disaster. This dress should be at least half the price due to the terrible material."
1.0,Completely disappointed. Online it looks like it has multiple layers to the skirt. In reality it’s one single layer of tulle. Making it completely see through. The reindeer and the color are great but for this price I could have found something better at target. You get what you pay for.
1.0,It is beautiful but the chain broke after one day! Very disappointed!
1.0,"I gave this dress the benefit of the doubt when I ordered it -- because I was absolutely in love with the print pattern on the dress.  However, when it FINALLY arrived, it was absolutely horrible.  The material was like a cheap Halloween costume.  Th e colors are great -- but the material is horrible.<br />Mind you, I've ordered plenty of dresses from companies that ship from overseas and have LOVED them.  I pay attention to the sizing and order correctly.  This was not one of those dresses that I loved.  I hated it.  I'm happy to be able to return it.<br />Don't waste your time ordering it.  You will only be disappointed."
1.0,It is very cheaply made and the lining needs to be much longer. The lining was much smaller than the outer dress making it fit very weird.
1.0,These are clownish to me.... I thought they'd be compact and cute but there not big enough to be funny and not small enough to be cute. Their just ridiculous looking.
1.0,"Very bad material,very bad quality"
1.0,"So disappointed, extremely poor quality and didn’t look like the picture :("
1.0,"One of the earrings seemed to be filled with something on the inside, which gives it the appearance of being dirty. Makes me wonder if I’m fact they were new..."
1.0,"Sorry but it was very cheap plastic material.  Not worth $40 for sure.  The only cool feature was the red light up eyes.  Also, the studs around the head are a waste they all fell off and got lost.  Would NOT recommend it."
1.0,"I ordered the 2T-3T white nutcracker print dress for my daughter (2.5 yrs). I had to come back to my orders to make sure I didn't mistakenly order a shirt instead of a dress. Nope, no mistake on my part. This dress is WAY TOO SHORT. She could wear it as a peplum, but that's not what I ordered."
1.0,It looks very cheap. I have it to my 8 year old niece. Did not like it
1.0,Time stopped every night
1.0,"Shrinks so much after washing, doesn't stay on the feet at all after washing, keeps sliding off"
1.0,Not true to size details posted and pads don’t stay in place
1.0,Item was very tight across the bust. And I have had a mastectomy and have no busy! Very wide at the hips. Returning item today.
1.0,Very cheap not happy
1.0,fit two sizes too small
1.0,"They are sending t shirts worth about $7..00 and charging $22.99. Then when you return the misrepresented item, they only credit you $19.99. Sounds like fun, huh? This was my 3rd and LAST attempt. Congratulations to the few who may have actually received this shirt be cause the 3 I've received are very much miniature versions made out of polyester."
1.0,Very small case that doesn't fit my tiny eye glasses.
1.0,Terrible. The dress arrived with a bunch of white stuff all over the front of it. Not happy with this purchase
1.0,This looks so cheap in person. I really needed the bracelet to work for an outfit but I just can't justify keeping it. The gold plating is the type that looks like it would chip right off if bumped.
1.0,Broke the first time I used it. Very cheaply made/
1.0,Both were broken.damaged.
1.0,"The clips that attach to the shirt slips off constantly. On top of that, the leather looking part here all three elastic garters meet has a pointy hard spot that irritates the skin. I had to place tape over it to remedy this."
1.0,"I got these for an upcoming  festival,  and they are so rad !It came wrapped and packaged well, and with a cleaning cloth and soft sunglasses case .Good quality from what I can tell, but will see how they hold up at the festival.<br />*Update *<br />The middle pieces that sit in your nose dug into my nose so much it bruised it , they don't adjust at all and broke off so now these are useless."
1.0,"The three packing cubes are so flimsy. I'm not even done with my vacation and they will not make it to the next one. Broken zippers, punctured mesh, torn fabric. The non-cubes are better but the zippers are terrible. I DO NOT recommend these. Terrible quality. I've had some from a different manufacturer for 40 years. I only bought these because I needed more."
1.0,"Extremely inaccurate sizing, got a size bigger than usually and still extremely small"
1.0,"This hat runs very small. It fits like a junior child size, not a men size as expected."
1.0,The back of it breaks off to much. This was the worst thing I have bought off here. they need to find a better way to keep the back together.
1.0,The socks was awful. Had a very bad odor.
1.0,"I've bought this watch before and loved it. Unfortunately, this second watch was sent to me without a working battery and I cannot find a way to replace it without dismantling the whole watch."
1.0,"Way, way, way WAY too small.  Ordered two (tan and navy) in size XL for men and got shirts sized for a smallish medium female.  It is very badly sized.  Don't waste your money.  If there was a way to give a negative star I'd be rating it that!"
1.0,When these are hooked around the ears...it’s cuts across their eyes.
1.0,Cheap !!
1.0,"Totally not the right size, even the hair tie was way big. My adult sized wrist couldn’t even fit it without it falling off. I used measurements to determine size and it was completely wrong."
1.0,"It was too long for a 5'4"" woman.  And it came w/ a paint stain on the dress.  Returned."
1.0,"This was the worst thing I ever ordered. The material was cheap, both the dress and cape ripped when trying on. Very poorly made. I had to go out to a costume store today to have a costume. Very disappointed!"
1.0,If you have a tummy or bulge at all don't get the dress with the horizontal seams. You will look like a barrel of monkeys.
1.0,Smells weird and folds up awkwardly. Also the design looked cheaply printed.
1.0,Exactly like leggings nothing work appropriate about it.
1.0,Sizing chart is incorrect
1.0,So smalll you can barely see it
1.0,Bad quality and finishing
1.0,I realize this is cheap but less then a week and it’s already turning his finger green.  :( won’t buy again
1.0,"The description clearly stated the dress is COTTON / SPANDEX... I’ve ordered dresses like this before and received quality dresses! However, the dress I received is cheap, thin, and 100% polyester. The size and length were true to size."
1.0,The dress fit as a medium but the cups ran as a small or XL and one of the padded cups is flipped and with a folded crease and can’t be taken out without cutting the dress and cannot be stitched flat
1.0,En el primer uso se rompió la cadena.
1.0,I got this about a month ago and about 2 weeks later it started falling apart. I used the carabiner to hook to my bag. This case could not handle the constant rocking back and forth while attached to my bag during my commute.  The attachment of the carabiner to the case fell apart.
1.0,Too bad! Cute but delivered broken.
1.0,Lies lies lies
1.0,"Liked them at first, then realized they are very poor quality.  Then lens kept falling out!<br />I had to return them"
1.0,"If I was a bit younger or had more of a petite figure this may have worked. Too short and deep V did not cover my assets. More like an open V. I would use it as a beach cover up but material does not breath so way too hot for that option. I am 5'7 36D, 28' waist, 37' hips."
1.0,"The watch itself is beautiful however the tool to take the links out is a piece of junk. It broke the first time I tried to use it. I then tried the old, pin and hammer method and that still didn’t work. Now if I want to wear the watch, I have to take it to someone with the right device to take the links out. Very frustrating!"
1.0,The masks are not for kids. Which is the reason I purchased them. They are too big to fit an adult face. They fall off the face. Not recommended
1.0,The sf is extremely small  and the rubber is thinner quality than I expected. I’m going to contact amazon as far as a return .
1.0,Returned. Very poor quality
1.0,"The band came off theFit2 Pro twice causing the tracker to fall on the ground once and scratching the face.<br />Today, the band and part that connects to the tracker came apart making the band useless.<br />Save your money and your tracker and don't get this band."
1.0,Muy mala calidad y pesados. No hay forma alguna de que se vean como en la fotografía de Amazon
1.0,Trash
1.0,Truly the ugliest garment I've ever worn
1.0,It's nice fits all my stuff but it fell apart. The threads came out and the inside pocket fell apart. I paid 39.50 for a wallet that last less than a year. That price and that nice of leather it should have last me years. I'm disappointed.
1.0,these didn't fit my ear right
1.0,Bad quality bad I really not recommend it
1.0,Liked nothing about this item.  It is a hot mess
1.0,"does not meet quality, does not look like picture add, disapointed"
1.0,It does not stick at all to the skin. Constantly just falls right off if wearing a lose shirt. I bought this so I can wear a bra after I have back surgery but it’s literally useless.  I’ve tried others of this shape and style before from wish.com and they were CHEAP and completely fine! This bra though when it does stick you can ~feel the stick~ like it feels like you have just STICKY all over your boobs
1.0,Buttons are just decorative they don’t actually work. Needed dress to open in the front.
1.0,very cheap and is not worth the money
1.0,So generic<br />Basically see thru<br />No seams<br />I actually couldn’t believe somebody would sell this
1.0,"This would be great if it fit adults. I put it on my husband and was unable to use the velcro and therefore it did not curl up into a bowl shape to catch the hair. I used it anyway since he needed a haircut and it worked to keep the hair off his shirt. I decided to try it on myself and it still didn’t velcro, on my kids who are smaller adults and it didn’t work. I didn’t have small children to try it on, but unless you have the neck of a mannequin, I don’t think this was made for humans. It would have been great if it had a larger opening with longer Velcro to accommodate larger adults.  I do have to say that it packs up easily and stores in a small area."
1.0,"Tengo cuatro faldas de esta marca en diferentes colores, medium y large.  Tienen un largo midi y mucha tela.  Lucen eldgantes.  Esta color gris tiene poca tela, poca calida y luce como small short, que este modelo no viene en short.  Al parecer trataron de economizar tela.  Se me hace difícil devolver, la regalaré."
1.0,the strap broke off on day one....very cheap - I guess hence the price.  Sending back
1.0,I got the front zipper version as recommended  because of shoulder pain. It came after long delay due to back ordering caused by high demand after a lot of publicity. It had a very strong medicinal chemical smell. I washed it several times according to the directions but could not get the ordor out. I hung it outside to air for another week. It finally was ok to wear. It is just a compression shirt all over. It did little to nothing for posture and was too long so it rolled up. I was amazed that this product had gotten so much publicity for something it did not deliver and was unpleasant to use.
1.0,Does not fit. Barely tried it on my gear sport and sad it does not fit. And now I cannot return or get my money back.
1.0,BOTH RUSTED WITHIN 2 WEEKS OF USE. IM VERY CAREFUL WITH ALL MY BELONGINGS AND I OWN A JEWLERY SHOP I KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF SENSITIVE METALS. THIS IS CRAP. FOUND IT ON SHEIN FOR 2$
1.0,Clasp broke after I wore it once
1.0,This is disappointing. It has no neck and the eyes barely show up.
1.0,"Imagine looking at your wrist for the time, only to see an open space. I almost lost my watch with this band, luckily it had popped out in the car, so I was able to find it through the app. There's no notch to keep the face from falling out. You insert the watch from the back and it flips right through the front. Nothing to keep it firmly in place."
1.0,Doesn't stay on. There's no support in these leg warmers and falls down/off after like 30mins. Don't waste your money
1.0,Not sure what they base their sizing on??  They need to keep it in China.. Sizes are so ridiculously off..  XXL is at best a medium..  Very disappointed
1.0,cotton is cheap and scratchy
1.0,Cheaply made. Returned it.
1.0,"This total plastic glasses are not blue like in the picture, they are actually a light turquoise color. Cheap plastic, good for fun only."
1.0,To small and to short
1.0,"Received this late but due to Postal delivering to wrong address. Neighbor delivered to me. This runs SMALL. Normally wear a XL ordered XXL, its tight. Not only tight but the buttons do not line up with the button holes from the waist down and the second button hole was not there.The coat itself is well sewn. I will have the missing button hole made and gift it."
1.0,"It looks like poor quality screen printing on the apron. It also says for men and women, but it looks more like child size. Fortunately, it's for a teenager so maybe it'll fit. I'd return it but Christmas is in just a couple days. Would NOT recommend."
1.0,Too tight make feet hurt worse.  Cannot return them back.  I am missing a pair.  I have looked everywhere for them.  Which I can get my money back.
1.0,Took forever to get it and than the material is awful. Its more like a slip than a dress
1.0,Awful waste of money and to return it would have cost way more then item so I threw it in the trash
1.0,SEE THROUGH FROM THE FRONT..... don't buy. Very thin material!!
1.0,Couldn’t see through the mask
1.0,Not as pictured. The front of the blouse is tooooo short. Do not buy.
1.0,"This product fits as expected. First time wearing and working out in this was great as the material is very soft and cooling. After one use, I washed it and the cheap material is not durable. As you can see in the pictures, it is not wearable after the first wash. Will be tossing it in the trash as I can’t donate damaged goods.<br />The last picture is of the inside. I would not recommend this at all. Worth investing more $ into durable workout clothing. I’ve learnt my lesson for sure."
1.0,too small and the bottom part came undone after couple of use.
1.0,the stud part is exactly the size i wanted and they look nice however the post is not a normal post it is very small. They are to small for normal pierced ears. (thin) and the back to them is TINY!!! I can't even wear them don't waste your money
1.0,"Purchased size 6 but they are quite larger than her regular shoes. The shoe itself is a UK 5 which is a US 6 but, no difference, slipper is too big. Still tried them on as the padding was super comfy and soft, but she couldn't walk in them without walking on the sides of the slipper- no stability and/or support. This is something I would suggest for older children."
1.0,"light on one of the shoe only worked for 2 seconds, and then stopped working"
1.0,Tiny mouth kids not adults
1.0,"No good at all, extra big was (small)<br />Materia l soooo cheap.."
1.0,It broke on the first day I used it horrible quality
1.0,"Too short, not what I thought it was. It looked much longer in pictures. Very uncomfortable to use. Do not recommend🤬"
1.0,Do not order this it came the size of a child and horrible quality
1.0,"It just didn't hold water very long, and didn't stay cool any longer than a standard handkerchief.  Don't bother."
1.0,"Way to small, material and quality not great."
1.0,The color is much lighter and it wasn't navy blue.<br />It was more vivid blue and very light material.<br />You pay for what you get.
1.0,Returned mine.  Fit was small and the pumpkin was bulky for the shirt.
1.0,This looked really tacky and cheap in person. This is more for a costume in a play or at a party.
1.0,It was damaged at the seam.
1.0,"Way too big! Not big like a comfy lounge cardigan, but just a massive doesn’t fit properly cardigan. Material felt extremely cheap."
1.0,I ordered an XL and it is more like a small. There's no way I can fit in it! Very disappointed.
1.0,I loved these when I first got them. However after one wash on cold they faded to dark purple.
1.0,Do not purchase. Hour hand is not in correct position.
1.0,feather fell off within half hour of wearing
1.0,"It looks well, but after some weeks usage the metal weaving broke in areas of bending and kept snagging in my clothes, resulting in threads pulling etc.<br />I threw it away."
1.0,"These have been my favorite go to leggings as I have bought the ankle ones previously. I thought I would try the crop ones with pockets and bought them in the same size as the ankle leggings and they run much smaller than the ankle style leggings and the diameter of the bottoms of the crop pants is different in each pair I have purchased as well. They seem very stretched out on the bottom. Also, two of my crop style pants have started unraveling  after the first wear. I have previously bought the ankle leggings and have loved those. I wish the crop ones were as good."
1.0,ZERO I buy 7 big kids and was toddler kids omg
1.0,"It was not as described, I contacted the seller twice, and got no response. Extremely disappointed"
1.0,Great.....until in broke In 10 months! Warranty?
1.0,"The absolute worst! If I had not received it as a gift for my daughter, I would have burned it already. I vacuumed this dress for 30 minutes to try to get rid of all the glitter. It is still dropping glitter. Do not buy this dress! Seriously the worst! Globs of glitter, you'd think it would stop eventually. It has not stopped. I am writing this as I contemplate having a bonfire party to burn this dress alive. I would rather have pet hair all over my clothes than have glitter all over my house."
1.0,"Crap product, but you get what you pay for. If you want a pair of ultra cheap sunglasses I guess this is for you"
1.0,wish I could put zero stars. shirt is COMPLETELY see through...got an XL (usual size) and ti fits like a medium. very disappointed.
1.0,Feels like cheap plastic covered in silver. I have no doubt this is gonna turn my skin green. Extremely disappointing
1.0,Cheap the clip isn't great.
1.0,Product arrived damaged. All photos were folded and punctured from the same area.
1.0,"i ordered xl they fit my 125 pd wife just right,i ordered the same item in a differant color before in xl and they fit ok,you don't know what you will get."
1.0,Im guessing I need two sizes larger than a small because I could barely fasten them and I normally would wear a 2 or 4.....waah!
1.0,"This merchant doesn't guarantee their workmanship. I was given a pair for Christmas. I blamed myself forwearing them with the mask for Covid<br />I was unable to purchase a single earring.<br />I saved up bought this new pair . Before the end of the day, lever back was wide open.<br />Don't waste your money.<br />Shotty workman's shop!"
1.0,They are missized and cheaply made. I am returning them.
1.0,If you raise your arms it will lift all the up to your neck. Highly recommend wearing with a shirt underneath.
1.0,Super cheap quality. Came as a crushed mess and unwearable.
1.0,"This was very cheap looking, small and the material smelled like a chemical. Wouldn’t recommend."
1.0,One didn’t work - had to wiggle the wires. Hard to get your hands in.  Not well made.
1.0,"Way to much $$ for what it was.  Looked cheap, not good metal, thought it was 3D but was flat."
1.0,"As soon as I wore the necklace, I noticed that it tangled easily. A couple of days later, It fell a part while I was untangling."
1.0,"I was so happy to get this on my door step today. Sadly, when I opened it out of the plastic bag it had a TON of loose threads in the skirt. It really looked very worn and as if it was wearing out. The fit was OK, but not flattering for someone like me who has a long torso. I am just going to return it since I got a defective one and will wait to try on clothes in the store, where I can actually see the material before hand."
1.0,Worst product...material is not good
1.0,"White is see through, I ordered a medium and it did fit at least. Tag was on the wrong side, you can see where it was sewn it then cut off on the outside"
1.0,"Only one case came, just the red. And where the ""handy"" clip thing is sewn on makes it impossible to fully zip closed."
1.0,This product was not compared to what the model was wearing very disappointed with item.
1.0,"Haven't tried it on, but it is clearly nontrie to size. This is not burgundy, its more candy apple red. There is also a seam right down the middle of the dress that is barely noticeable in the product picture, but very obvious on the product. This is not at all what I wanted."
1.0,Love the bracelet but it's way to large so I'm not able to wear it.
1.0,"Overall this is a really adorable set. However, i noticed some of the thread was coming out after the first wash. So the quality just isnt there. Size seems pretty accurate but I have a small baby. He's about 24/25 inches long and weighs 13 pounds"
1.0,"Disappointed. didn't look anything like the picture, like the colors were different and way to small and narrow."
1.0,Not really what i expected material to thin
1.0,Waited forever for this product and once It arrived this was what I got👎🏾
1.0,[[VIDEOID:d0c8ed9c2e4da544c0b63680dc6cb822]] Was supposed to be .925 sterling silver and it was not...not happy at all...
1.0,These did not work well for me at all.  They pulled by bra straps back and twisted them.  I found them very uncomfortable.
1.0,"Was so excited to order this for my granddaughter for Christmas. When I received it today the package contained only one earring. Too late to return will give the necklace and bracelet. Very pretty just wished the other earring would of been with it, cute set"
1.0,Way too small. Almost unwearable. Disappointing.
1.0,The clasp on this bracket did not last. Broke less than 2 months after getting it. What was disappointing is I had a copper plate put on the bracket with a quote about my daughter. Now I have to have it removed and put on another bracket. Cheap product.
1.0,"I am furious about these cheap glasses! I would not pay a single dollar for these! They are made of the cheapest, thinnest plastic I have ever seen. I received them with bent nose pieces and crooked, lopsided ear pieces. These are absolute trash and it is ridiculous that I now have to buy an envelope to ship them back. SAVE YOUR MONEY, DO NOT BUY."
1.0,These fall off your face - way to big and cannot even use- we ordered these as a back-up and the “return window” is closed - ugghhh
1.0,They keep breaking I have to keep changing the tips no good..
1.0,Nice quality pants just fit tight
1.0,"I hate to give it a 1 star. Great looking product. Feel great. Unfortunately, The first time I was able to go snowboarding, I had a hour wait to get on lift because they were late getting lifts running after a big snowstorm. While waiting, lenses got moisture between the layers, and caused a huge fog/moisture spot between lenses right in line of view. I contacted seller to try and see what could be done in Feb, and still have not had a response. Writing this review in hopes of catching attention and getting issue resolved so I can make a better review.<br /><br />Still a year later, no response<br /><br />Years later, no response... just hundreds more dollars spent on goggles..."
1.0,So I didn't care for the material is kind of like tape made they wouldn't hold up Mom
1.0,These socks were a present for my 10 year old FSU fan. They were piling before we even washed them once. These are pictures of them after three washes. They didn't even last until January 25th. Very poor quality!
1.0,The 1st pair I ordered had defects so I returned and ordered another pair...same problem...disappointed
1.0,"I hate this dress.  The dress was misrepresented as cotton.  It is not, it's polyester, fits like a paperbag and overall ugly and hot!  Not bad enough that the dress was misrepresented but the seller was trying to charge me for postage.  I called Amazon and they credited me.  BAD DRESS, BAD SELLER, STAY AWAY!"
1.0,"The dress (shirt) was really cute and seemed as though it would be comfortable, however, upon putting it on, I realized the sleeves were a bit snug, but the shirt was loose in all other areas. Although I ordered a size up, the shirt was still too snug to wear. When trying to remove the garment, the right sleeved ripped. :( Not sure if I can return it, but I would really like to. $23 for a thin shirt dress is a lot of money. If the material were a little more durable or had a little stretch to it, it would be perfect!"
1.0,"This was so small, the shoulder seams were off. And I am not broad by any stretch."
1.0,These pants are not made like the picture the legs are not made correctly.
1.0,It's a very thin chain..................... would not have bought if I have seen it first.  It is not worthe what I paid for it.
1.0,"These caps are huge, even after washing and drying."
1.0,Too thin and clinging. Did not fare out as in photo
1.0,"If your a plus size man/chick PLEASE order as big as you can! I got a 3xl because that's what I usually get, and I couldn't fit my arms in the sleeves much less wear it. My sister, who is a large at best, tried it on and it fits her like a glove. It also looked like it was inside out when she wore it. (Yes we turned it inside out to make sure we didn't have it on wrong) We plan on sending it back, hopefully for a refund."
1.0,"This is a piece of junk. I guess I shouldn’t have expected much for the price. I never write reviews but I am so upset by this purchase. The tiny metal loops in the band has snagged on multiple pieces of my clothing as I take them on or off. This has been ruining my clothes. Also, the color on the band is not fade resistant at all. The black color started coming off after only a few days of wearing it. I guess I learned my lesson… don’t cheap out on a watch band."
1.0,"This cannot even be called a dress. It is a shirt, based in length.  Save your money."
1.0,"Does not work! It looks okay, but it does not work. I just did not want to bother sending it back since it was cheap."
1.0,This dress is a mixture of polyester and cotton.
1.0,"I washed washed on a gentle cycle before having my daughter wear it ( like I always do with new clothes) and the bottoms came apart. Disappointed, my daughter didn’t get to wear it at all. I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,broke easily.
1.0,Cheap material and did not look like the photo
1.0,Extremely to big go down a size...
1.0,"I ordered a 3xl thinking I’d have a little wiggle room. It fit like a small 2xl until I washed it in cold water and it somehow shrunk, a button fell off, and a seam came undone."
1.0,Disappointed.<br />Poorly made.<br />Broke after I wore only a few hours.<br />Waste of my money.
1.0,"Very poor quality, When buying XL you really get XS. You can't get the money back."
1.0,"Chose this one because it came with the finger sleeves and the peelers, but it does not."
1.0,"Really beautiful bracelet but, it keeps coming apart from the links. started to come apart in around a month. had to repair it myself because it literally broke on me a day after my 30 day return was over. pretty bumbed out because for the price i expect something that can hold up to even light activity. After i repaired it it broke from another link. guess i have to keep repairing :("
1.0,"First of all, the hat came smashed flat in a small plastic bag.  It is tiny and poorly made in China.  I cannot wear it so I am giving it to my granddaughter for dress up playing.  I would send it back but to much of a hassle"
1.0,Ordered a navy blue one...GOT ANOTHER BLACK ONE....Second one has a small hole in the front left tail.....Nice discovery when you're ironing it for work.....not happy.
1.0,Disappointed description inaccurate
1.0,Fits very really tight
1.0,didn't like at all.  Looks more like a headband.  Very disappointed.  Item returned
1.0,Top too small n i wear a 38dd in bra size and i orded a XXL .. but great material it doesnt feel cheap
1.0,These were so cute but they hurt my feet so bad!!!!!
1.0,"I bought this jacket last year & only wore it a few times before I had to switch to my heavier coat. I got it out again this fall & have been wearing it every day for a few weeks now, and this is what is already happening. The fraying started almost immediately & there are huge holes where the seam is ripping without warning. The jacket is comfortable & the color is nice, but other than that I feel like I wasted my money & will be throwing the jacket out at the end of this season. EXTREMELY poor quality & would not recommend :-("
1.0,"It was too small for the arms. I have big arms.... this would be great to wear for summer if it had a longer length to it.. it would make a cute TUNIC top, but not my style had to return it!"
1.0,I posted a review about these earrings before...not in a good light either ~ but I did say it nicely. But they didn't even post it for me. Why? Because I didn't like them? You should be happy I didn't return them. I don't wear them...so I'll probably give them to my Granddaughter one day. Way too small for the price!
1.0,"The sizing is ridiculously small...  I normally wear a Junior M in tops, I ordered an XL and it was still way too small.  The XL must be a childs XL. I returned it."
1.0,My Apple Watch flew off when I was changing clothes. I broke my watch within 24 hours of wearing it.
1.0,Second time wearing the dog charm bracelet and it's tarnish already.
1.0,Shiny material. Not comfy.
1.0,"Hands don't work, cheaply made wouldn't even give to a one year old."
1.0,Product too small. Sizing descriptions incorrect.
1.0,I’m a US 22/24 or 3x so I ordered the 3x and wasn’t even able to put my neck in it. Entirely too small and was sent back same day.
1.0,This doesn’t fit like it’s supposed to and zipper keeps busting open.  Extremely thin material almost see through
1.0,Don't waste your money<br />Cheap looking looks like a part of a costume very bright red<br />Made from Cheap Material.
1.0,The fit is fine but the photo shows a mustard which is actually canary yellow.
1.0,Orange and black made me look like a big pumpkin
1.0,"Fit around arms was inconsistent with top size. I typically wear a large comfortably, but this top's cut is not proportionate."
1.0,"Purchased a XXL since the reviews said it fit small, and they weren't kidding! The XXL barely fit like a medium."
1.0,El pantalon vino roto
1.0,"Have reordered multiple times over several years. Mfg has changed material and pattern. Material is uncomfortable and fit can only be described as ""wonkey!"" I'll be looking elsewhere in future."
1.0,Too Small!!!! Cheap 🐦Cheap 🐦Cheap 🐦 Birds Chirping Never Again Will I Order From This Company.......
1.0,It broke as soon as I opened it just got it today!! Do not buy this is very cheap!
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:f3cc77f05e1e680f639e790d266e0bdb]] Dropped my watch! Spring bar is  weak, it detached to my watch it gave my watch scratches. I would given this NO STAR But the lowest is 1. Check the video<br /><br />Update: bad customer service, told me to just put the original springbars. It defeats the purpose of the easy spring bar. Totally ignored that my watch was scratched because of their spring bars. Jeeezz thumbs down!<br /><br />Yeap blame the watch for the lugwith. great customer service. NOT! returned the strap!"
1.0,"It’s way too big, smells awful, and had some nasty foam glued to the inside. Huge waste of money, you’re better off without a mask than buying this."
1.0,Mine came with dead batteries. Now I have to buy the batteries. I hate to spend extra for something that’s supposed to work right out of the box.
1.0,"The hoodie came on time, but it was the not the one i ordered. The one i ordered had the cursive writing on it, but i received the one with just the plain lettering. The hoodie feels like the the thermal material as described and along with the matching pants i ordered, its a very comfortable outfit.  Its a shame they sent me the wrong one because i would have rated it very high."
1.0,Waste of money for just 1
1.0,"This is the cheapest looking dress my daughter owns. It looks like it will fall apart just by looking at it. I would not buy from this seller, looks nothing like the picture"
1.0,1. Let’s start with it be a long sleeve & not the short sleeve one that I ordered.<br />2. Cheap T-shirt material not the material shown.<br />3. Cheap vinyl decal. Looks like an amateur with a Cricket machine made this.<br />4. Tired of taking time out of my day to return the crap that Amazon allows to be sold under their name.
1.0,"Wore for a few minutes and the jewels fell out, awful product"
1.0,"These sunglasses are total garbage - incredibly flimsy and cheaply-made. Like something you'd buy at the dollar store for a buck. And the pink lenses look NOTHING like the picture, they are not pink! Will be returning."
1.0,Other similar skirts it as further size this to ask if it like a medium
1.0,To small it’s more like a child size I ordered 42-44 Apple Watch band and I always do never had problems.  These stretch but tight in few minutes shows the marks on wrist.
1.0,The material tore easy and wasn’t the correct size
1.0,The edges are roughly cut and unfinished feeling. Thinner material than others as well.
1.0,way too small...I returned it
1.0,The money it don’t work k for this shoes is to bad I don’t buy it again for sure
1.0,I exposed this item to artificial light and natural sun light. However the item would not glow in the dark.
1.0,"Much too high and at too sharp an incline. It literally throws each kid into their face each time they go into the air. My 2 and 3 year olds did not do well. Maybe ages 4 and 5 would be better, but it seems thin enough to snap in half with too much weight. Poor design."
1.0,I bought this dress with high hopes. I guess it only fits very specific body types. I looked like I was wearing a hospital gown. I don’t have a large chest so the entire upper part of the dress hung off of me. The lower half wasn’t much better. Not flattering at all.
1.0,Not an attractive skirt....
1.0,$3
1.0,Not true to size. And its a weird kind of fabric. Had to return it.
1.0,Needs a thermal layer.  Allows cold air to go through.  Burrrrrr!
1.0,The only piece that arrived was the circle part you’re supposed to attach to your bracelet. I have no idea what happened to the glasses 🤣. Maybe someone wasn’t paying attention while packaging the product. My daughter was looking forward to this as a birthday gift. I’m reluctant on reordering it. 🤷🏽‍♀️
1.0,Worst mask I've ever bought and used. The straps attached the the ears come loose and hang below your ears. It's very uncomfortable and wears poorly
1.0,I’m 5’6.5” 120lbs I was swimming in a size XS. So sad because it’s sooo cute
1.0,Vent buttons already popping out after less than one month of use. Fits a little snugger than described. Not satisfied with product and will seek refund for sure.
1.0,"I was soooooo disappointed, plastic container filled with water."
1.0,"Terrible slippers! I should've listened to the other reviewers.  I received this item on August 4th, 2017. I'm not a constant slipper wearer,  just at night and in the morning. Had these for approx 3wks when the liner wore holes in it and the &#34;memory foam&#34; bunched up under the liner. Awful slipper! Save your money!"
1.0,To tight Across the shoulders
1.0,"As soon as I opened the green pair, the earring post snapped off."
1.0,Terrible piece of jewelry way too small to fit any ankle or wrist
1.0,"They fit my husband great.  However, when you wash then, they totally disintegrate....  Not like lint, but actual LINT DUST.  They make a total mess of my dryer.  Poor quality.  They will not last even 6 months.  Very thin material.  I would not purchase again."
1.0,Rip in sleeve. Very disappointed
1.0,"I wanted to love these so bad, because they're super comfortable, but unfortunately they're also completely see-through."
1.0,I fell in love with this dress and belived the reviews on here that it ran a little too big. So I went one size Larger according to what the  sizing chart said I was.  WAY OFF PEEPS! I am a solid 16 and I ordered a XXL which would be for 18-20W.  It barely fits my niece and she is a USA size 10.  Very disappointed in my purchase!
1.0,Worst made bra I've ever bought...it mskes ur boobs pointy like bullets.and points ur boobs out wards I don't suggest to anyone...
1.0,"Do these fit too small, as expected, or too large?<br /><br />Answer D: all of the above.<br /><br />Everything is labeled the right size, but each pair of shorts is different -- some significantly so.  But if you are looking for a family pack, this might just be it."
1.0,The design is not right down the middle as shown
1.0,Was not waterproof at all. Don't know why someone would want to wear this just for the look. You would wear it for its purpose (keeping hair dry) and the look is a bonus. Would not purchase again and would not recommend.
1.0,Waaaay too big for the size marked.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture I
1.0,"Lenses do not fit in frame,  they aren't snug at all in frame and fall out"
1.0,It’s like a slip... I can’t see anyone wearing this in public. Returned.
1.0,"They worked well for a few months of intermittent use, cycled them in every other week or so. However, one of the legs is separating from frame more and more with every use. Tried super gluing, didn't work with the grease-type adhesive used to attach the leg in the first place."
1.0,n reality this necklace is way smaller than it looks on the picture online. Im disappointed in that.
1.0,"When I opened the package it smelled so bad.. Like fish food!!! I tried hand washing it, wiping it with disinfecting wipes, and finally just put it in the washer. Came out still smelling so bad. I'm really sad cause how cute it is and its just making everything it touches smell disgusting."
1.0,It's heavy watch and the oval round shape actually hurts. It's right on your wrist and you can't do anything wearing this.
1.0,It look cheap and it does not stay. The cross part comes out very easy.
1.0,Insert was broken and unusable. Requested return but no response.
1.0,When shoes arrived one was charged and the other shoe we plugged in. It however never worked even after trying to reset it under the sole insert. I tried to email company as they sent info in case there is a problem. Email was unable to be delivered. So frustrating as it's for my 7 year old. He's upset I have to return them and wants to just keep them even if only one works.
1.0,"Go way smaller! Sizing is way off! I went by the size chart to the T “Don’t do that !!!”  The dress was way off !!!!! I’m gonna gift it to some one else, because I’m to busy to fool with sending it back I’m never home and don’t have the time. So warning go smaller , that’s my experience!"
1.0,My son is 13. Ordered it for him. Chose the size (in years for some reason). It showed up with the tag saying 3X but it is actually closer to a small or medium youth. Ridiculous.
1.0,The earring is so heavy and the clasp is so flimsy that it won’t stay hooked.
1.0,The robe came without a belt as shown
1.0,Two of the hooks broke the very first time I wore it.  Not worth it.
1.0,"the picture of the product is a lie, the neck warmer is another one Alpinestars more cheep."
1.0,The wires top is awful.  It doesn’t fit and looks really weird.  Worst design ever.
1.0,"Did not like, pulled my hair when taking off."
1.0,This is is stitched so poorly that mine tore within days..complete junk
1.0,Worth the price for teenagers.
1.0,Too Small - From Asia and run Small
1.0,Got these for my husbands birthday this week. He is on his feet all day from work and needs lots of comfort and arch support. I went on the companies website and chose these specifically for their arch support. When they arrived i didn't take them out of the box but had a quick feel of the insole. I thought it was a little stiff but i let my husband try them to be sure. They have no arch support and hurt my husbands feet. He said it wad like walking on concrete. After his painful grimace he had to put his own orthotic insoles in them just to tolerate the slipper. He shouldn't have to do that if they are advertised the way they were. Very tempted to return them. Not happy
1.0,half the socks start developing small holes after a day or so of use.  My toes are sticking out of the ones I'm wearing right now. Other then that flaw comfortable.
1.0,billed and shipped this back.  never was reimbursed
1.0,"The fabric texture was not at all like what was pictured. Though the color was correct, the fabric was stiff and rigid to the touch. It felt more like textured paper than a shirt."
1.0,She won't fit these until she's 5. And they're kinda ugly.
1.0,Took forever and was not as nice as thought it would be be I got one out of two of my delivery's
1.0,"I purchased this dress to wear to a professional society dinner (navy irregular hem pencil dress).  I had not worn it prior to that dinner and put it on one hour prior, tried to zip it up, and the zipper split.  I can barely get it zipped back down to try to re-zip and then if it does zip, it just splits open again.  Wasn't even able to wear it one time.  I had taken off that tags and tossed the packaging.  If you do make the poor decision of ordering this, size up one, too."
1.0,unable to unlatch the watch in order to put it on.
1.0,Out of the 4 charms. 2 are placed facing the other way which makes it unwearable and useless
1.0,I love it I can dress up my watch for a fancy engagement it’s so elegant! U may have to remove a few links I removed a few
1.0,"Runs very small and when I tried to contact the company to return it I got no where, so I'm stuck with it! Also, the material was very cheap and no comfortable."
1.0,"Amazon really needs to inspect the items that's returned before shipping out the items. Not only was it used, it was dirty with charcoal powder residue all over. On top of that issue it smelled like some child's Axe body spray. I don't understand how you can miss such thing when the moment I opened the box that the first thing I smell. But the sweater felt nice and decent quality."
1.0,Took 2 weeks to get the boots and when I got it the zipper was broken and their was a noticeable tear on the boot! Returned it and waiting for refund
1.0,"I ordered this dress back in September For my stepdaughter to wear in my upcoming wedding. After receiving the dress and trying it on her, it was way shorter than the picture described and not the color I was expecting . Not inappropriately short but nowhere near the length that it shows. Once my soon to be sister in law showed me her daughter in her dress and I saw it was what I was expecting, that’s when I realized we ordered from 2 different companies advertising the same dress. The dress on the left is what I was expecting, the dress in the right is what I got. And what’s worse is that I’m past the deadline for a refund so I’m stuck with it😒"
1.0,The clasp on this chain is stupid. It’s a ball on one end and a straight pin that goes through the the ball. Everytime there’s any slight tug on the chain it becomes disconnected and falls to the floor. The heart is tiny and adorable but not worth it because of the chain design.
1.0,"The belt and dress were two different shades. There are no fasteners to hold the wrap, no ties, no nothing!!! This dress is totally not up to Acevo's reputation.  I have purchased lots of Acevo dresses and Have gotten lots of compliments.  This one makes me never want to get another one.  Is there a Zero star rating?  I am sending it back."
1.0,"None of these earring clasps work.  You cannot open them to put them on and if you can open them, they not longer seal shut.  I returned them and was given a full refund."
1.0,"Fabric is un forgiving, very tight and very short if you have a booty."
1.0,Wasn’t happy. 2 came with a hole in the side :(
1.0,They hang off the ear too far . They need to be more flush
1.0,Beyond cheaply made.
1.0,Garbage. Washed one time in cold and the decal stuck together and would not come unstuck. Threw this away and was not happy.
1.0,"The product is made fairly well. There are elastic bands inside both halves to allow storage to be kept in separate areas. The chrome plating is extremely shiny and looks cheap - at least for a man to carry this... NO WAY. As far as a women to carry in her purse, I suppose it would be fine. I ordered it along with about 5 others to see which I would like to use myself. I am keeping all of them, as It is not fair to return things like this. I certainly will not use it. May give it to a grandchild to play with."
1.0,The criss cross didn't function correctly and the suit looked really cheap.
1.0,I received this belly button ring and its very pretty BUT it was already missing a little diamond out of it. Kinda disappointed but not returning for $2!
1.0,I know it’s a natural stone but I received one with a big whole on it. I figure it would come with little imperfections but mine looks really bad. I will not buy another
1.0,Earring so thin its badly made..
1.0,These glasses came very uneven. I rarely use them because they're uncomfortable.
1.0,Cheap and cant put on or remove without help....
1.0,Did not look at all like the color I ordered!  Would cost more in shipping than product did so I painted it with nail polish. Looks all right.
1.0,"The material was not quality, and it was just frumpy looking on."
1.0,Item came one part only and broken earring suppose to be two came only one for one ear and damaged
1.0,"Material is horrible, wayyy to large"
1.0,Item should be marked medium
1.0,"Mala calidad, pobres materiales, no vale la Pena, es un pésimo producto"
1.0,"I have a 34&#34; waist, and bought a 40&#34; belt, but it's too short. Maybe they included some phantom inches? Seems pretty scammy."
1.0,I’m 5’7 and weigh 178 lbs right now. This was WAY too big on me.
1.0,I am very dissatisfied with this as I received the item already torn and marked as such with arrows taped to it when I opened it. It is upsetting to think that this was either used or failed qc and then shipped to me.
1.0,"Poor quality material, cheap looking will not order again"
1.0,"I have this ring in sapphire and love it, but I was extremely disappointed to receive the ""rainbow"" moonstone only to find that it was a poor quality ordinary - not rainbow - moonstone. The silver portion of the ring is as lovely as the sapphire version but this ring should never have been advertised as ""rainbow"" moonstone. There IS a difference between regular moonstone and rainbow moonstone and this isn't even remotely in the rainbow category. It isn't even a nice looking regular moonstone and I cannot imagine wanting to wear it with such a poor stone. Really, I cannot express my disappointment adequately enough. I'm rather disgusted, actually."
1.0,I have a shirt from the same company that was great. This New York shirt in navy blue order in a large looks like a small woman’s. The fabric is similar to sports jersey material. The sleeves were short and so was the rest. This was not an oversized tshirt: it was a soccer jersey that said New York. Returning.
1.0,"Beware that this bracelet has a very dull, matte gold finish -  see my attached picture"
1.0,Absolute junk and any price!
1.0,Not what I expected... It's thin lace lingerie. Threw it out because it wasn't worth the cost  of returning.
1.0,"Ordered a size (7) receive size (4) .Returned same day ,had to rush to get another"
1.0,Didn't even order this product was supposed to be something different.. so upsetting
1.0,"This is scratchy,bulky is not this gorgeous turquoise color but a disgusting kelly green. I do not like Kelly green esp .with my coloring. The texture and weave look nothing like the picture. I will be sending this back. It does seem warm  but if you  want what you see in Picture you may be greatly disappointed. And not sure what the other colors really are be cause mine was 100% not this color I ordered.There is also what appears to be a mistake in weave around the neck! Sad as I was really looking forward to a nice sweater in this cold weather."
1.0,Did not meat my expectations. It arrived broken.  I had to fix it as I needed it right away.
1.0,Size ran way small
1.0,Las huellas de perro que trae incrustadas no se visualizan
1.0,There's no way this was 95% cotton and 5% spandex -- try 100% polyester! It reminded me of the cheap Halloween costumes in material. NOT AT ALL what I expected. Very disappointed. Goes right back.
1.0,Design print not to my liking.
1.0,"I give this dress a no star, the quality of the dress is pathetic and cheap.its so thin that you can literally see everything. The stitching was so poorly done that it looked as if the dress was going to break. I ignored the reviews but if I was you I would not recommend this dress to anyone. Waste of money."
1.0,Way too small. Returned product.
1.0,Horrible. Returned for refund.
1.0,"Name and description say bamboo. The label printed on the waistband says cotton. They are soft, but this is false advertising."
1.0,Very disappointed it came see through. I was really looking forward to this.
1.0,Pants too short
1.0,"JUNK.  They are rubber/plastic, so when putting them on there is a lot of give that makes the lenses pop out.  Too light to stay on.  Lenses smudge and scratch easily. Broke the first day.  I have nothing good to say about them."
1.0,"While I love the product, I decided it was a bit too large for my needs.  Sometimes it's hard to visualize the actual dimensions.  However, when I went to return the bag, the seller wanted me to pay a 20% restocking fee which I did not know about previously and which I consider exorbitant.  So NO, I'm not happy!"
1.0,"The bag is cute, however upon opening it, the clasp broke. I superglued it for the event I purchased it for.. an hour later the chain broke. What a waste."
1.0,Thin and flimsy. The ends are rolling up and they are so loose they won't stay on anyone in my family's face.
1.0,"Returned! Cheap!,,"
1.0,because that's all these are.
1.0,"This shirt did not look or fit as expected. The sleeves were loose and not tight fitting as shown in the picture, and that goes for the actual shirt itself. It took too long to get to my house and once it did I was very disappointed that it was low quality and I don't even think I would wear it at all."
1.0,Light stop working
1.0,"The material is super cheap, there is no lining and it has a small plastic snap at the chest so the whole thing gaps."
1.0,"LAS TALLAS NO COINCIDEN CON LA TABLA DE EDADES, ELLOS MANEJAN EL TALLAJE MUY GRANDE, PEDI PARA MI BEBE DE 02 AN'OS Y ME LLEGARON PARA UNA BEBE DE 04 AN'OS."
1.0,"The price was definitely good, the product on the other hand, was subpar. They are very stiff and won't even fold up all the way. The lenses are aligned straight across meaning they don't have any bend to shape around your face. Personally that irritates me because I don't want the sun coming in from the sides of the glasses like I'm not even wearing any. I guess I should have figured the defects considering the price but I'll never buy sunglasses again without trying them on first."
1.0,There were no holes for the buttons. I haven’t worn the shirt yet but there was a tear in it when it arrived. Disappointing. Cute shirt if it was wearable.
1.0,"Trashy, awful dress and completely different pattern, fabric, length and style from what I thought I was purchasing, based on the pictures. The dress I received was a flare, super short, exposed midriff and tie up back dress.  Would not recommend."
1.0,"Too short..I have a 34"" waist. The next up would've been 36"" . .I thought that would have been too long ...wrong !!!"
1.0,This necklace was pretty to look at but wasn't wearable! After putting it in it would tag in a matter of minutes! Highly disappointed
1.0,My daughter didn’t like it.
1.0,"I usually wear a size 4-6 and ordered a medium. This sweater top fits very snugly right to the waistline, showing every lump and bulge, then flares out only on the sides, accentuating my hips.  Unless you are very small breasted with slim hips, this will be unflattering."
1.0,"Next time I want to go to a 70s hippie party (or wear a faux bling necklace), this might work.  Otherwise it's way too big and cheap looking. I obviously didn't look at the size in the description.  My bad...."
1.0,"These didn't even rate a star..they are that bad. I am a size 12 , so I ordered a large. The leggings ran so small they fit my son's girlfriend, who is a size 0 . The leggings are also extremely thin."
1.0,Everything just rolls around in the bag; the divisions are useless.
1.0,Good idea. But doesn't work like you would think. Band needs to be wider then it is. Does not stay in place it just all ends up in the middle of your waist.
1.0,Again for the 3rd Time there is no place in the watch band that the screw with take hold.  You provide the screw (the male) but not the other part (the female).  I give up I am sending them all back.
1.0,Child wears a size 5 in shoes. This size five fit more like a 7. They were really cute. Hate they were too big. And according to size chart even the 4 would be too big.
1.0,"Cute idea, but it's not over size unless you buy the largest you can."
1.0,"Maybe I had too high expectations given the 4 and 5 star reviews. This is not 5 star material. This is a case of you get what you pay for. The plastic mesh material is scratchy, the clear plastic insert that is supposed to keep the hats form is garbage. It feels too shallow. Adjusting the strap clasp to keep it on my head while running just makes it uncomfortable to wear. I was going to toss it in the trash but I don’t want this to end up in the ocean plastic mess so it’s in the goodwill pile after a single use."
1.0,I would not buy this product I've been using it for two months and the clip that holds it together broke now it is worthless
1.0,"I've bought these socks for several years and always loved their fit and softness, but this batch is a mess. They shed small balls of material with every step and I've tossed them in the trash. Whatever you did to change up this sock, you ruined a good thing."
1.0,"I do like the product but, what i really wish it had a pocket inside as well inside. The change does is not too strong it very light."
1.0,"Guys, this looks like an old faux crushed velvet pajama shirt.  It's hilarious!  Do not buy this!  Although I got a good laugh, it's going back.  It runs really small if you like the faux crushed velvet look, so size up.  It was too awful to take a picture to post."
1.0,The color is not as shown.. too dark and not bright at all!
1.0,"Not at all what I ordered! I bought the same dress in 3 different colors and I got 3 different fabrics and shapes. Only one (Black) was as described, which was great, but the other were dinky fabric with thread hanging from every seam and the dress had no shape!  beware!"
1.0,I ordered this for my sister for Christmas and they lost the first one had to ship another one and when I received it I wouldn't give it to her because it was about the size a ten year old could wear and it was a large.
1.0,This piece of jewelry left my lip green within 24 hours. What a waste of money. I should have returned it.
1.0,Crappy waste of money.  Not even worth my time to review.
1.0,I haven't had the ring 1 month and already 2 stones have fell out. Very dis satisfied with this product. Won't order from this company again.
1.0,Al ponerla no quedan bien no comprar
1.0,"Recibi una talla mas grande que la que queria , la banda del reloj le queda muy grande y los protectores de pantalla tambien"
1.0,"As others said, the watch does look good. I’m not sure if I received a defective one, but first day wearing I noticed a huge chip in the glass that spread as you can see in photos. Very cheaply made and upsetting this happened first time wearing."
1.0,"Totally confusing with the sizes, I ordered a size 1 for my 6 yr old and recieved a pair of shoes ment for a baby. Other than the inaccurate size the shoes look like decent quality."
1.0,Totally not like!  It won't clip to my eyeglasses.<br /> Over and over again I tried.
1.0,"Listed as a suede boot with twinface sheepskin but I received a velvet boot. Not as listed, not as pictured. Completely useless"
1.0,"The quality is so poor. First of all, it’s a single layer of thin, silky feeling fabric. Secondly, there’s no panty liner like most bathing suits have. This is problematic bc the seam looks to be in an unfortunate area. Very disappointed."
1.0,First one came with black spots... so I requested to be exchanged... second scarf came with a hole!!!! For real!!!!!!!?????!!!!<br />What a shame!! I really wanted it!
1.0,"I still have baby pouch, so I was looking for something cute and comfortable! I’m about a size 8-10 so I ordered an L which is slightly bigger than recommended.... also the description says for plus size or “curvey” hahaha yeah right! I would t get it past my thighs I returned it, wasn’t even gunna try an xL"
1.0,Too thick to get in my baby ear
1.0,"We got these for my son, and after only one month the velcro came off one of the sandles. We were 2 days outside of the 30 day return window, so we are stuck with broken sandals now."
1.0,Absolutely awful. The chain fell apart as soon as I opened it. The picture looks a lot better than the actual product. I would not recommend this seller.
1.0,"Horrible quality basketball shorts...  Waist was cut too small, shorts fit more like capris, crotch hem was practically down at the knees, material was paper thin, etc.  These were just overall crummy shorts.  What's worse is the seller had my original review taken down! (nothing like a fascist to silence a bad review of their product in order to decieve buyers)  Amazon should be ashamed of allowing that to happen."
1.0,"Very cheaply made and very short, to short. Bottom shows. I’ll be adding fabric and I hope it will look cute and cover things"
1.0,Poor quality. Wouldn't buy again.
1.0,It was not made properly and tangled easily
1.0,Way too small for a man to wear. Cheap looking plastic frame.
1.0,I thought this would be tee shirt fabric. It was more of a polyester. Ugh.
1.0,They broke in less than a half hr horrible
1.0,"I only received one pair of glasses and the ones I did receive remind me of children’s play glasses. There’s a slightly shaded lens, but nothing looks extraordinary."
1.0,Did not fit. Does not stretch. My wife is 5'9 and could not fit it. It is sheer a lil thick
1.0,"My band came in today. I hooked them onto my watch. I went to put my old one back on but this band would not come off. I tried gently to take it off and it ended up breaking the latch on my watch. So now my watch is ruined. Please do not buy this. You will not be able to switch it out. Once it's on, it's on forever if you don't want to break not only this band but the entire watch. I can no longer use my watch again. Very upset. This company should have to replace my $200 watch"
1.0,They feel and look like pajama pants.
1.0,"I received this Saturday and now on a Thursday, it broke between the hearts. I liked the design, but it would be nice if if lasted longer than 6 days.😞"
1.0,They fit very weird and they're not comfortable. I bought petite and they're way too long.
1.0,I bought two pairs and they were both broken (lights didn’t work).
1.0,1. The necklace wouldn't even fit around my neck.<br />2. The dangling pieces were facing opposite directions.<br />3. The chain was broken near the clasp.
1.0,I have charged these shoes 3 times and now they do not work at all. My son is very disappointed that his shoes he recieved for Christmas do not work in February.
1.0,"Horrible, horrible shoes! I wish I could give this negative stars! Wore this for traveling and within 1 hour of walking around, my feet were killing. The side and back of the shoes rub up on the skin. The shoes are my actual size and do fit but the material is so rough inside it seems and it rubs horribly against the back and side of feet...DO NOT waste your money on these!"
1.0,"very small..barely fits over earlobe, just surgical stainless steel hoop, no Cubic Zirconia stones"
1.0,Poorly made.  Very thin.  Almost see through and I bought the blue.
1.0,I was very disappointed with the poor quality of material and the size not fitting.
1.0,The dress is super rough fabric and it does not stay on the shoulders. Honestly it looks awful on my 3yo.
1.0,"Bought my size when i recieved them n put them on they were way 2 small n i didnt like the color either felt extremely uncomfortable in them, immediately took them off"
1.0,"Purchased for brother, normally wears xl, these look as<br />If would fit a medium. Can’t even get on. What a disappointment.  To much of a hassle to return. Donating to Goodwill"
1.0,"Cheap. It's a cardigan, not a blazer. Don't buy this crap."
1.0,The small metal clip that closes the band wore out and broke a month after I purchased it.
1.0,"From the description: ""Lightweight - Acetate rims, bamboo arms and polycarbonate lens means you won't be losing these in the ocean.""<br /><br />False.  These do not float, in fact they sink right to the bottom.  Bought these for use in the water and nearly lost them the first time out.  Luckily I was only in a few feet of water and was able to grab them right away."
1.0,Strap broke quickly
1.0,A little big i would recommend going down a size.
1.0,This is for ONE pair of leggings. Don’t be fooled you will receive all of them.
1.0,Here’s my shirt after one washing it is completely pilled
1.0,"Feels like rubber, does not slide on and off wrist easily."
1.0,Stiff and didn't work well.
1.0,Very small thin sox from China. Returned
1.0,"Bought 2 of the same top in different colors. One was a child size and one a women’s, This was a waste of my hard earned money as I had to donate it and look elsewhere for a replacement. BEWARE!!! Do not buy!!!"
1.0,Hooks fell off during delivery
1.0,"Ordered navy, received black. Also, will not stay up."
1.0,I ordered the watch specified in the description and picture. Black with white letters. And I got the one in the picture. I’ve seen this issue in other reviews. I’m disappointed I got something different to what I ordered.
1.0,Its a tank top. Not a compression shirt. There is no compression and I ordered a size smaller.
1.0,This was the worst thing I had ever received.  The top button is missing. The size small is actually a  size xxs. The length is too short.<br />I'm returning  this item  but they are  making me  pay to return.  Don't waste you time and money it's not worth it. Worst product I had ever bought.
1.0,To small to the size. Not good quality like the picture. Disappointed
1.0,Obviously it's a fake. But as far as Knock offs go it's on the higher end of fake merchandise. Has a made in Thailand tag. Coach has never manufactured anything in Thailand. Other tell tale signs in the details as well. Does not have the Coach feel.  What do you expect buying anything over the Internet though!
1.0,Chain was broken when removed it for package.
1.0,Fell apart. Only wore 2 times.  Very disappointed with the quality
1.0,Watch arrived in two pieces with the spring that holds one side in a bag.
1.0,It’s too small and material is too stiff and I got the  biggest size when i only wear 40/8 it didn’t even pass my toes and it had weird smell. I threw immediately !
1.0,This jacket looks cute but the quality is horrible so itchy and not good fabric would not recommend.
1.0,Purchased this item the beginning of this calendar year and the buckle broke already.  Disappointed as I purchased due to positive reviews from friends.  It will definitely buy another ratchet belt but I'm now leary of buying this brand again.
1.0,Do not buy these. These are the lowest quality plastic you can find. They came in with scratches and dirty. Plastic bottles would provide better protection.
1.0,"Extremely small, especially in the arms."
1.0,Very ill-fitting. I followed the measurements and it was at least two sizes too small. The material is so cheap looking and feeling. It’s not an expensive dress but you can find much better quality for the same cost or less elsewhere.
1.0,"As mentioned numerous times above, this products comes with no instructions.  That is ridiculous and I would not recommend it."
1.0,Very poor workmanship
1.0,"Love the color but for a large in men's, it was too small. No wiggle room. Would buy again but in an x lg."
1.0,"I used to work for Fossil and am well trained on taking links out of watch bands, and I have the proper tools to do so at home. But this watch was my match, two of the link bars broke and now I can't even wear it until I can purchase a new band."
1.0,"I am allergic to anything but 925 sterling silver, these are not real. I had a reaction.  Thanx"
1.0,"Even though the item was in a wrapper, it was soiled. It was on the smaller side and didn't stretch much and was rather tight...very unsatisfied."
1.0,"Broke the girdt tone i put i5 on. Cheap , cheaply made, I got what I paid for. I complained about it breaking  no response to this day."
1.0,"I wish there were women's tshirts. Im 5'4"", 115, wear a women's size small. I got size small and it fit so oddly. It was long. Halfway to my knees. There was a ton of room in the arms and chest. It was tight around my belly. As cute as it was, I had to return."
1.0,Takes 5 or more minutes to get these shoe covers to lay flat. They continually snap into a tight curled ball and you must<br />fight them to lay flat. It's quicker to just take your shoes off and put them back on again. Good idea but not well executed.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!
1.0,clasp broke within hours of first putting it on.  Not well made.
1.0,This band lasted a month. It tore at the top where it clips into the watch. Very cheap and my son almost lost his watch due to this.
1.0,"Bootleg product of poor quality, undersized and over priced, save your money"
1.0,I have bought three different pairs on three different orders.  Every pair has loss their stones after only wearing them twice.
1.0,Be sure to check if it is European sizing. Wasn't even close to fitting.
1.0,I ordered a Woman's Large and got a shirt that fits my 10 year old daughter.
1.0,Need bigger size no contact information to see if possible
1.0,This is not a rain jacket. It’s a wine jacket. I got soaked in the rain
1.0,Color is far from the one in the pic and looks really dirty
1.0,I ordered an XL and received a small from what it appeared. Wouldn't even go past my hips.
1.0,Waste of money and tossed in trash. A low quality image printed on masks and colors were dark and mask shown in picture was unrecognizable.
1.0,Does not fit.  The sleeves to short and not long enough.  Still waiting for UPS to come with the return lable.
1.0,"Arrival of package, item was stained, out of the package. Plastic wrapping was tore. Not sure if this was a return or want. Fabric is very sheer and color is much literally then picture"
1.0,My daughter wore these maybe 5 times and they look like she has had them for a year. The sparkles come off and are all over the floor. They look run down and scuffed. The inside of the laces are coming out. She is 4 years old and runs around a lot but I still expected these to last more than a week.  Don't waste your money unless your child plans on staying still in these.
1.0,This sweatshirt if definitely not worth the price. It is not as cozy as it appears in the pictures. The arms are really short. The hood color is completely different than showed in the pictures. Save your money.
1.0,Do not buy this I did and it broke in less than a week the single Top zipper broke and bag wasn't even 80% full. Don't waste your money if i could give 0 stars that would be the rating.
1.0,Okay so I know I have a big head like just a massive noggin but this thing was tight. Like way too tight.
1.0,No glitter or sparkle.
1.0,"The light didn't light-up the face at all.  So I asked to replace it, which was done.  But he light for the second one was worse that the first.  I'm going to order a different brand."
1.0,"Though a watch is supposed to be Swiss Made, it has not tag that assure that,<br />I am not returning because I have no reason as described , but am not happy with it.<br />The description did not mention where it was manufactured ,and we did not find any clue  of the place it was made."
1.0,One of the gems fell out. Just opened delivered package.  Dumped it out of little black bag it came in and the gem fell out along with the earring.
1.0,The material feels like flimsy thin cardboard. Mine arrive squished. Pretty though.
1.0,It’s small for a child’s neck or head
1.0,Within the first couple of days bracelet broke while sitting eating dinner.
1.0,Came apart with in a month
1.0,"The breeches I received were not Horze brand, in fact there was no brand labeled on the pants anywhere. I would not purchase these."
1.0,It fit weird. Not flattering at all. Cheap material. Looked better in the picture
1.0,Description inaccurate.  It is 95 percent polyester 5 percent spandex.  Description says 95 percent cotton.  Wrong texture and material for what I wanted.
1.0,The picture looks beautiful. The cut of the dress in the picture is beautiful. What I received was a potato sack. No shape whatsoever! It was very Disappointing. I bought two colors the pink color is gorgeous but the cut is horrible. I returned them both.
1.0,I ordered the largest size and it ripped as soon as I went in one leg. I can say it’s not that stretchy on the thigh. Normally I’m a XXL in shorts but that was like a size L
1.0,"Bought these thinking the wedge would be comfortable but it is one of the worse shoes I have had.  I bought it a year ago and forgot it in my closet it and just recently found it in the box.  Within 1/2 hour, it was hurting my feet.  The front is narrow and the 7 1/2 feels more like a 8.  Not happy and I can't even return it."
1.0,Broke as soon as I put it on.
1.0,"The seam on the thumb opened up the first time they were worn.  Since they were a Christmas gift and ordered in November, it was beyond the limited time of return.  Embarrassing and very disappointing...."
1.0,Didn't last long. Very disappointed
1.0,Purxhased for my niece. Very pretty but broke before she could wear it.
1.0,Hate it!
1.0,Was like a nightgown
1.0,Only 11 headbands came with hearts. We have 2 headbands that don't have the heart attachments. The description was misleading stating 24 pieces.
1.0,This was not a scarf. Just a small plain piece of fabric with unfinished edges.
1.0,Gem is much smaller than the 1ct advertised. Pictured next to a .75ct earing for comparison.
1.0,"If I could give 0 stars I would. There is a reason it is so cheap, it's a crappy costume! The material is see through, with strings hanging off it, the colors don't match from front to back, the ears are just a thin felt!!! Please don't waste your time or money. This would not even make it through a few hours of trick-or-treating. I am returning mine tomorrow."
1.0,The material is very cheap and the shirt does not look nice at all.
1.0,"I was so excited after reading the good reviews. But, unfortunately, they gave the sides of her feet blisters after the first use. We played at the park on the splash pad for about an hour."
1.0,Smells funny
1.0,Barely wore this band a month and it tore at to top of the band. I really hoped this band would last a few months.
1.0,"These are super cute earrings! But unfortunately the quality is terrible. They are too flimsy and do not keep their form at all.  When trying to take them out, the whole earring unraveled and is now unwearable. The color started to change extremely quickly as well."
1.0,This dress is super cute but such cheap material and see through.  I wish it wasn't because I was going to wear it to a wedding.
1.0,"I really like this upon arrival! Looks a little cheap, but you knew that. Where I don’t agree with the cheapness level is how the little “latch” the band slides through broke after a couple weeks. It’s comes with a second “latch” otherwise I would be very upset with this purchase. I would spend the extra 5-10 for a better quality band I wouldn’t have to replace as often.<br /><br />Update: lowered to the minimum stars. Strap completely broke apart...while walking. Garbage!"
1.0,Too darn small...ugh
1.0,La calidad mala perdio el color como en 3 posturas
1.0,"This is cheap looking, did not give it to my mother in law to embarrassed....not a good buy at all."
1.0,The picture says it all. Worn 3 times and the bottom cracked off.  I emailed the company and they wouldn't exchange or refund without receipt even though I sent a picture of the tag with the company name. They were a gift.
1.0,I couldnt not wear this because the boa was shedding horribly.
1.0,Way oversized. Arrived with arms broken off.
1.0,"They are so difficult to reattach that you end up loosing all the tiny heads. Plus it turned my ear green, which shouldn't have happened if they were really stainless steel"
1.0,Very flimsy mask.
1.0,broke after wearing once
1.0,The thin wire does not secure the stone. It’s bends and the stone falls off. I’ve purchased twice and it happened both times. Other than that I loved it but it breaks too easily
1.0,Were just too uncomfortable.  So I returned them.
1.0,Be careful with him to bring extremely easily
1.0,"I ordered an XL size because I am a medium.  I understand ASIAN clothes are much smaller, but seller sent a kids size and expect me to keep it.  WAAAAAAAAY TOO SMALL and cheaply made.  Seller scams buyers.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER>"
1.0,Too much padding in the wrong place!
1.0,"Ordered the green ones, they look super cool but my son is 1 1/2 years old and wears a 7, which he is growing out of, I ordered an 8 but wow it is about 2 sizes way too big!!<br />Going to keep them until he grows in to them but please note the size difference!!"
1.0,I had to return the product because it broke after one day.
1.0,Was not aware it was slim fit now have to return
1.0,I ordered a XXL and i received what appears to be a M.  And the material is awful. Honestly feels like ribbed paper towels rolls. Awful product. DO NOT BUY
1.0,Was severely disappointed with this. The crystal has a weird metallic glaze on it and is missing the Star Wars writing (basic). The picture is very deceiving. Do NOT sell this as a movie replica (and you did as there's a pic of Jyn in with the product) if you're going to cut corners and send me something that looks nothing like it.
1.0,Received a turtleneck not a v-neck like in the picture
1.0,False advertising ! The add said it would fit the versa 2 . Not even close ! Way to small to fit ! This is the second one I have had to return because it said it would fit the versa 2 .
1.0,Not as presented poorly made
1.0,Cloudy and cracked
1.0,I ordered these in black. They fit well and look good but they have the opaqueness of regular tights as soon as you bend over. As in you can see EVERYTHING straight through them. 0/10 recommend
1.0,This was a complete joke
1.0,FYI POLKA DOTS ARE HUGE! The picture makes the print look way smaller than I think actually is. Looks horrible.
1.0,Item was small
1.0,"It fits and stays on my waist but if it is tugged lightly it will fall.<br /><br />I wore this skirt ONE time and all these lint balls appeared. I have skirts that I've worn for years that this has never happened to, and the fact that this happened after one use is utter crap!!!"
1.0,"Very thin material, severely faded after one wash..."
1.0,"Absolute garbage this is weirdly shaped, poor quality, the snaps broke the first time I put it on him. Don't waste your money!!!"
1.0,Ridiculously long wait and the masks are way too small for an adult face. Seller won’t even respond to my inquiries. Don’t even bother. Horrible seller
1.0,"These looked nothing like the photo, way too light and you can’t see the pattern at all. I ordered the darker color so hopefully that one looks better"
1.0,These shoes offer no ankle support at all. The soles have worn down very quickly.
1.0,These are very pretty but extremely delicate.  They broke as soon as I put them in my ear.  I returned.
1.0,"Cheap, flimsy, looks nothing like photo"
1.0,"Don’t buy these shoes. It took two adults to get them on our 2 and 4 years olds.  They were the right size once on, but so poorly designed that it was a good 20 minutes of wrestling our kids to get their feet into them.  No one has time or energy for that."
1.0,"Ordered size 7, but received size 6. The item looked used, some stains on the shoes and dirt at the bottom of the sole...So disappointed! I felt scammed! such a waste of time!!!"
1.0,"I own other dryers by PEET and am a big fan. This device, however, is faulty by design and seems destined to become a fire hazard. The issue is that the wires enter the shoe dryers from the heel, which means the wire connectors are flexed each and every time you insert the device into your shoes. Over time, the plastic wire housings will form tears and eventually separate, leaving the wires being unprotected and vulnerable to chafing and, eventually, to shorting. See the attached photos. We owned this device for three years and it was used lightly; we were always careful to not bend the wires any more than necessary; and we never pulled on the wires when removing the device from our shoes. The problem is the design. Functionally, they work great, but I'd highly recommend AGAINST buying this product."
1.0,"Don't buy this. The smell when you open the bag is just terrible. I don't even want to use it, but $6 to return so I am stuck with it."
1.0,It fit more like a maternity dress. No where did I see this was a maternity dress. I had to return.
1.0,It's such a pretty ring.. It broke after wearing it one time.. Wish the quality was better..
1.0,My cat knocked one of the earrings off the night stand and it literally broke in half?  Disappointed.
1.0,"The headline is that the strap became completely detached from the sole with less than 4 months of use.  I've had other brands of slide sandals and this is the first to fall apart this quickly, by a large margin.<br /><br />There is an additional issue with the sandal.  The numerous holes or pores in the sole run from the bottom to the top.  If you are wanting to get your feet wet with any liquid you step on, this shoe is for you.  The pressure of standing on any wet ground will squirt the water up thru the pores in the sole and right onto your foot."
1.0,we didn't even try the sunglass lenses because the yellow ones did nothing.
1.0,Returned due to uncomfortable & unflattering style as well as hot fabric
1.0,Totally wasted my money. Not working after 1 month
1.0,Pockets stick out
1.0,I love the design of the necklace but is way too short. Far from 22 inches
1.0,This is made for a child’s wrist.
1.0,Came apart at the seams
1.0,Very thin and poor quality construction.
1.0,Cheap crap. They were all very low quality and there were sooo many duplicates.
1.0,One of the ear pieces came off really easy
1.0,Material was see through
1.0,This umbrella faded immediately and now is a light beige. I bought two and they both faded. Not recommended to purchase.
1.0,Very pretty but runs very small
1.0,"Cheap stretchy fabric that is very very heavy for a summer dress. There is no lining, except for 2 inches or so at the top which starts to slip out as soon as you move. DON'T DO IT!!!!"
1.0,"I thought these were so cute when they came in. I put the first one in and it was really hard to thread. I checked and it seemed to be solid, however it fell out within a day and the gem was lost. Over less than a week I put each of them in and within 1-2 days each of the charms fell out. One while I was sleeping and one while I was out shopping. I've had my medusa for over a year and used all 3 styles of labret piercings; ball screw on back, inside thread and outside thread. These ones fell out super fast as opposed to the other style. Very disappointed, especially for the price. Now I have no earrings for Christmas..."
1.0,I bought 2 of these. Only 1 arrived and was the correct item. The other was a pair of swim trunks. I bought the biggest size I could go as I'm a bigger person. It literally fit me like an xl. It saddens me that the 1 didn't fit correctly and 2 that they didnt even send the correct second item.
1.0,"The strap is too long to allow you to play comfortably.  I am 5'7&#34; and find it too long.  it will not adjust to be short enough. I also get a buzz sound when playing because the plastic clip vibrates when uke is being played.  My honest advice is to save and get a proper strap, even if you need to install strap buttons to your uke."
1.0,I was not satisfied with this top at all.  The material was thin. It was not complimenting at all.  I put it on and the zipper would rub against my skin.
1.0,Way too big for a child's hand!
1.0,"This shirt looked really awkward on in my opinion. I always stray away from women's cut shirts and stick to men's cut because I know what to expect, but I decided to get this one anyway (in a size up than I usually buy) because I thought the material would be a little thinner and fall nicely...it looked like I was wearing a box. I wore it once to workout in and HATED it."
1.0,Impossible to latch you'll help and a flash light
1.0,This bracelet arrived broken. It is extremely cheaply made!
1.0,Do not buy. They are deleting the bad reviews. Cheap material. Nothing like the pictures!
1.0,"If you don't have pencils for legs don't bother buying these. I am norml size 5'5&#34; and 130lbs, normally proportioned and these things squeeze my things so tight. Disappointing."
1.0,only received a star because I had to rate it.only received a star because I had to rate it.
1.0,"I didn't like it because it falls off really easy and if I tighten it to hold better it gave me a headache, so needless to say I stopped using it."
1.0,"This is a cute top and it was great for post-op when I couldn’t get a shirt over my head. Be sure to inspect it thoroughly though. I have this in another color so I took the tags off and threw it in the wash, thinking it was fine. Later, I discovered that someone had written in black sharpie on the inside and it bled through on the back. Unfortunately, this top isn’t good enough to wear in public. I emailed the seller with pictures and I never received a response."
1.0,Was a 3x n it’s small
1.0,This broke three days after I got. It was cheap so I guess it was expected.
1.0,Pants not finished. Not happy with the product
1.0,"You get what you pay for. It arrived quickly but the box that it came in was for a sex toy which is completely inappropriate. It quality is very poor, it has bubbles in the “metal” they dipped it in. It’s cute though"
1.0,THE COLOR WAS WAY OFF~RETURNED.
1.0,Cute shirt but runs small. Sent back
1.0,I would have been ok if it was not Fake. It is fake and not happy about it. I guess Chinese are pouring fake stuff in to Amazon.  Wish Amazon would put stop to fake stuff.
1.0,"This is possibly the worst blouse I have ever bought.  I loved that look of it in the picture and it did fit as expected but, once I put it on, I could hardly wait to take it off.  The material feels like plastic, more suitable as a placemat on my kitchen table than something worn on my back.  I would strongly recommend that you think twice before buying."
1.0,"Way too small, gave it away."
1.0,too short and weird fabric.
1.0,These are very gawdy and the earings are not identical to eachother.  One hangs much lower due to manufacture defects.
1.0,Ship looking Low quality not what it looks on the screen
1.0,"This shirt is comfy, but CHEAP. The material pills after just a few washes. Good for just wearing around the house. Lost a button after a couple washes and an extra button is not included."
1.0,"So the white suit is listed as green, ok whatever. Problem is it’s actually black! I’m so disappointed in this suit! I even ordered a white cover up to match that has to also be returned because the suit is neither WHITE OR GREEN. SMH! And it runs super slim to boot. I guess I should’ve expected all this by the price.. Needless to say it’s going back tuhhhhday!"
1.0,The material is thin. Not my style of wear. I returned them.
1.0,It didn't have different sizes so it pulled on my nose
1.0,"No support whatsoever. I thought the underwire would give a good lift, but it didn't do much of anything"
1.0,My grandson wanted this. The chain broke within 30 minutes.
1.0,"I was so excited for this however literally 3 months after I bought it, The bear & my keys broke off randomly ! Super disappointed but I guess you get what you pay for"
1.0,"I bought these undershirts for my two granddaughters, ages 6 and 8.  I liked the overall quality of the material and detail however they couldn't get them over their heads!!  I purchased size medium but there was no give in the neckline to stretch at all.  They are average size girls without big heads.  Because we were leaving on a trip without time to purchase replacements, I had to make a cut on the shoulder strap on each of them so they could get them on.  Once on, they fit nicely but what a time we had with them.  Would not recommend these for that reason."
1.0,Same as the other letter p way way to small.
1.0,"I bought this product because the description seemed it was a set of three different sizes. That is not the case. There is no select a size button so that is why I assumed that. When received I only got the 1, 3mm piercing. Was told through correspondence that is the only size they have. Also they won’t be refunding my shipping charges. DO NOT BUY HERE SEEK ELSEWHERE."
1.0,"No words, just see the photos"
1.0,I got these as headbands to wear and they were just awful. They were so tight on my head I couldn't wear them. I tried cutting them in half to see if it loosened up (less build up of fabric) but they were still too tight. For something that is supposed to be versatile it should be more stretchy. I just can't do anything with these now
1.0,I loved this bracelet till it broke today.  I purchased it on the Aug 5th and today is Sept 10th and it didn't last much more that 5 wearings.  I am in the process of seeing if they will extend the warranty but it says it expired on the 8th.
1.0,My watch broke. The windinbmechanism came out and I can't set time.
1.0,Where is the rest of it. Waste of my time and money. Nothing like what is shown. This wouldn't even cover a toddler.
1.0,"The jacket was weirdly tight in the shoulders, with short arms, and super fat in the body part, like extra fat, no shape to it. I'm under  the impression this was made without an understanding of how the human body works. I'm not one to write reviews but it was so bad I  feel like I should warn anyone considering buying it. I got an XL for my husband, he's not a huge guy 6' 175. I got the large size for the sake of his long arms. We did what looked like grayish blue but it was brighter than expected and a really ugly color."
1.0,Not protective AT ALL. It's pretty thin and flimsy actually. The only thing nice about it is the color. Just pulling the pop socket I placed on it pulls the back of the case off. Will have to buy another case.
1.0,Not in the shape I wanted it to be in.
1.0,I ordered this for myself. Woman size Large top. The shirt came and it didn't fit at all!! Tiny!! I ended up giving it to one of my students.
1.0,"Cheap, clingy.  Don't buy this."
1.0,cheap fabric and not flattering
1.0,Very disappointed in this jacket.
1.0,Too small and not stretchy material for my 4 yr old<br /><br />So disappointed<br /><br />Material is not soft
1.0,Too big. Not really midi or knuckle rings. Not as advertised. Had to return.
1.0,Cheap not worth the money
1.0,Quality is pretty bad! Didn't survive even one wash! Skip it!
1.0,"Paint is peeling, once installed home/crown button is unnusable due to fitment. Not a great item"
1.0,I bought 2 pairs of these one Small and one extra small. My daughter and I are in a parade and we wanted matching Christmas leggings. Below are the pics Small was RED WHITE AND BLUE and this awful shiny stretchy material the extra small is cute hot pink black and white & different material. Super pissed...it's like they are 2 totally different styles.
1.0,I guess for price I should not be surprised but not buying stuff from out of country again
1.0,To carry my cell phone<br />But whas to small<br />So I never used it
1.0,Ya ordered this product for my watch and when I received the product it was to small for my wrist they don't tell you what size they are very dissatisfied with the product
1.0,Came broken :/
1.0,Item arrived with a huge stain all over the butt. See attached photos.
1.0,"Terrible quality, this shirt was spandex not the waxed cotton cloth dashikis are typically made from.  Great price for an inferior product."
1.0,Super big
1.0,"I bought this sandals based on the good reviews not minding the complaints on the buckle, I just thought it couldn't be that hard to buckle up a pair of sandals, well I was so wrong, first of all the buckle on this sandals could not even allow a good fit around my ankle without it popping out, and I have a smaller ankle, I waited almost two weeks to receive this pair of sandals only to discover the terrible design on this sandals, I'm so pissed that I purchased this, total waste of my time. Definitely going back to seller!"
1.0,"I ordered an XL after reading the reviews about it running small (I'm a size M normally) and it's still Too Small (unfortunately, I figured that out after I took off the tags and packed it for a trip).  The colors are pretty but the material is Very thin.  I would not buy this again."
1.0,"It was so small I think it was mislabeled. It was falling apart when I opened my package. Sadly, it only looks nice in the picture."
1.0,Hand to return cause it broke after 2 months.
1.0,"Opened box to find mask broken at the nose. Couldn’t return due to party that night. Super glued it but it didn’t hold all night. So if you order, check it as soon as it arrives."
1.0,"the &#34;gemstones&#34; if you could even call it that, are cheap. ya get for the price what do you really expect, but as previous reviews mentioned, not quite as advertised. i wouldn't even say its decent fashion/costume jewelry. very disappointed."
1.0,Sorry to say I ordered the XL wore it but it ripped.  Did not return but should have
1.0,It didn't last very long the plastic broke in 3 weeks.
1.0,Don’t order you won’t get the package
1.0,"quality just isn't as expected nor is the size,(Seriously huge compared to what we ordered and needed) but we waited to order them for a trip so I guess they will do."
1.0,Only 2 weeks. It is broken. So bad......
1.0,Absolutely horrible quality. Item received with a hole in one leg. Very thin material. Wouldn’t waste my money on this item.
1.0,"I was so excited to get this for my Zelda-loving 9 year old son.  I ordered the ""7-9 years size"".  When it came in, it just said ""Small"" and it was an Adult Small, not a child small.  It was WAY too big for him.  Very disappointed."
1.0,"Shirt was WAY too small.  I ordered a 2X.  I got a shirt that looked like a Medium.  Also, the graphic on the shirt was poor quality."
1.0,"These come with all the bells and whistles and appear to have a lot of bang for the buck. However, after 3 weeks the arm snapped rendering the entire kit useless. I thought user error, so I purchased another set... 2 weeks pass and the new ones snapped in the exact same spot. Now I have 2 cases of useless lenses. You get what you pay for."
1.0,"I was so excited to wear these, but I was unable to fit them into my lobes. When I measured them with a ruler, it was apparent that they're significantly larger than 10mm in diameter. It's really too bad because they're beautiful. I will be returning them."
1.0,"Earrings are flimsy.  Clasp broke the first time I tried to put them on.  It's a shame, though, because the gem is quite pretty - with a better clasp, these would have gotten a 4 or 5."
1.0,Cheap material and way smaller. Feels like a high grit sand paper wedgie. Not worth it.
1.0,One of the wheels is missing:/
1.0,These jeans would have been perfect if they weren’t to tight an the button thing was sewed together so couldn’t button them
1.0,This shell jewelry was for my family.  I am 75 and may not see them again as they are from Ks.  I received 1 bags of shell items 7 of them had pastel thread and daisies from shell on them.  I was trying to buy a tourist memory from their gram.  It was for 7 boys and 3 girls ages 4 to 16.  I received 7 pieces of daisy jewelry not even pictured.  We will all be at my daughter's Jill Morgan 3700 2700 ave N.  St Petersburg Fl 33713  I know I waited till the last minute.  I did receive 12 pieces total.
1.0,Bleh
1.0,Poor quality.Smachet
1.0,Unfortunately it had no stretch whatsoever and was small for me so it wasn’t good for me but it was very pretty as it looks in the picture. If you manage to get the size right I’m sure it will be nice
1.0,Very flimsy material. Looks and feels cheap.
1.0,Super thin and see-through. And it looks super cheap. I wouldn’t wear it. 20$ is too much of a price for this.
1.0,"It's too long so I had to cut it. Once i cut it, i couldnt put the ball back on. Wouldn't recommend this to a friend."
1.0,This outfit in the green color....I felt like I was a nurse in the army back in the 20's. Not cute or flattering. Returned.
1.0,This thing was so cheaply made; it was fraying at all of the credit card seams and the zipper on the coin purse was broken. When I sent it back for a refund the day I received it I was only given a partial refund for this poorly made product. would not recommend to anyone at all.
1.0,"My expectations weren't very high due to the price. I knew I'd be getting something cheaply made but I didn't expect it to be this bad, even for the price. The most egregious part is the lace. Not only does it not partially cover the eyes as shown in the photos, it doesn't even come half way down my forehead. So wearing it makes it look like I have little short bangs instead of lace draping down. It wouldn't have cost that much more for them to make the lace front as long as it is in the picture. The headband itself is also very tiny, looks to be a child's headband.<br /><br />Additionally before even unwrapping it the lace is coming apart from the wire ears and headband. There's also strings of glue from the hot glue gun all over it. This I would have been able to work with and fix up had the lace at least somewhat replicated the photos."
1.0,Pretty dress but small is so big.
1.0,"I was so excited to purchase this for me and my friends and I am embarrassed to even give them their shirts.... its so cheap, boxy, fits too large and looks like a mans tank top. $17x5 has been wasted. So disappointed!"
1.0,"Loved the material, but wide and short. It also did not have the lining like the picture. I am OK with that, but it was too short."
1.0,Didn't receive my item so disappointing!!!! Expected gauges instead got a ring
1.0,Loose threads off buttons and near hems.
1.0,"The material was itchy and snug fitting. I am 5'5 and a good 3 inches of ankle showing. I like floor length, breathing room, and soft."
1.0,"The dress looks really cheap and is none flattering also too long,not worth the money .I sending it back."
1.0,Wash and wore them one time and the button broke. It completely ripped out of the side no way to fix it
1.0,It turned my finger green and I only had it on for a few hours I don’t think any ring should change the color of your skin
1.0,HORRIBLE. Do not order. They literally fell apart within 10 mins of putting them on
1.0,Fabric was nice but this dress was not flattering at all. Was baggy on the arm and under arm area.
1.0,"These were completely uncomfortable. The stickiness wore off, and they rolled up. I could honestly say these were a complete waste of money, I threw it all in the trash."
1.0,Beautiful but VERY flimsy. It broke as I was attempting to put it around my neck. I'm a pretty slim girl and it fit my neck like a choker. Not a &#34;flat-lay on the chest&#34; as I hoped.
1.0,The pearl is not botton shape it's like a standing nipple so disappointed 😒 but I guess bcoz the price is really cheap.its just a waste of money.
1.0,"Knit cardigan? It looks more like a woven t-shirt. Definitely not a sweater. Very thin, and sewn together like a t-shirt. I'll show it to the wife, but I'm fairly certain she'll want me to send it back."
1.0,"meh, not that comfortable and just plain broke the frame first day i wore them"
1.0,Cheaply made colors don’t match photos. Product was way too big in the chest and two small in the waist.  nothing to support or hold up the top. If you went out in public you would be asking for wardrobe
1.0,"Horrible product, fits terribly, material is SUPER heavy and uncomfortable. The vendor also charges you to send it back. Terrible product and experience."
1.0,"The chain is so short, it will only fit around a child's neck and you cannot switch it out."
1.0,The red top doesn’t match the red color at the bottom. The bottom fabric is super cheap
1.0,Wrong color sent. Dres is silky materia very long (mid leg) not spreading out nicely lk a scatter dress should esp if you intend to wear a peticoat lik me it wont work!
1.0,"This shirt fit ok. BUT, DON'T wash it!!! Like ever! The design sticks together and you will ruin the shirt trying to pull  it apart! VERY disappointed."
1.0,"Says one size fits all but they sent me an xxl. It does not fit, way too big. Disappointed"
1.0,"Ordered Florsheim Men’s Belfast Wingtip Oxford Smooth. Although the photo looks like the shoes are brown, they are actually a beautiful shade of burgundy. That’s the only thing about these shoes that were acceptable. The left shoe came with a major flaw on the toe (see photo).  The flaw covers an area of 1.5” x 3/4”. Where the quality control was when this shoe was made is beyond me. Paid $124 for these shoes and they came looking like that. Very disappointed. Ordered a size 11 D and both shoes were too tight across the toe. Will be returning. Ordered another Florsheim brand called Allis Cap Oxford in burgundy. This time in 11 Wide. Fits beautifully and burgundy color is dark but nice."
1.0,Received shirt with hole on side where stitching is.  😕😕
1.0,"ordered  a xlarge and wayyy to small, could  fit a kid"
1.0,I hated the material! It looked cheap.
1.0,I ordered in red but color is actually burgundy. Returned for refund.
1.0,I ordered the purse in Nov. and received it in February.  Then when I did finally receive the purse the handle was not even attached it was just a string.  Was very disappointed.
1.0,sent back back because elastic and too small
1.0,"This is clearly made in China. Size is twice as small as expected.<br />I totally agree with some of the other reviews. Very loose weave, very thin. One of the Buttons was falling off.<br />And I'm pretty sure that it is illegal to sell a garment with out a tag, for care instructions and allergy concerns. This had NO tag what so ever!<br />A FLY BY NIGHT manufacturing special!<br />I should have looked at the reviews better.<br />If you are a seamstress and want a summer sweater, - This might be OK.<br />AT HALF THE PRICE."
1.0,"I bought 2 different sizes of this ring. They arrived with two different finishes and neither one are truly sterling, even though the one is stamped 9.25, it's an overlay and I can see the brass/ copper coming through. The stones are also set totally different. I bought them to be a matching pair but that isn't even close to what I recieved."
1.0,I was very disappointed with this watch winder. After one day it started to squeak when it was turning loud enough to hear in another room. The watch pillows are too small for mens watches. I returned the unit to Amazon for a refund.
1.0,Not happy not at all what I expected it looks like a potato  sack. . I just opened it and wish to God I could send it back !!!! What a waste of my hard working hours
1.0,I can't review this item for I never purchased it or received it. Sorry
1.0,Magnet is not strong enough to use anywhere but thin cartilage.
1.0,"This is not an acceptable product . The anklets  are tarnished, broken and mislabeled. Truly disappointed and do NOT recommend buying from this seller. The pictures I posted are proof. I will definitely be requesting a refund"
1.0,Didn't fit right. I went ahead and ordered a larger size to see if going larger will make it lay right. Otherwise this dress does not fit well at all.
1.0,"But very not well made, despite the very good cotton fabric the seems where not sewn well the came apart from each and everyone from the packet. I am genuinely disappointed from this as Hayes is my goto brand!"
1.0,Pictures are stolen from another designer that doesn’t sell on here. Manufacturer should post pics of their actual product.
1.0,I did not like this wallet. It looks cheap.
1.0,This ain't leather...
1.0,"Way too long, poor sewing, very large and mis-shapen. Looks like an Amish dress."
1.0,It’s not what I wanted I’m gonna be sending it back I actually ordered two of them by accident I wanted a better quality and the way it was written up it look like it was but it’s not. Also the inside when you open it up it’s that cheap plastic it’s not a good sturdy leather wallet which is what I wanted and the way that it’s designed it doesn’t give enough space in between for the cards and notes and paper money to work
1.0,"Received a different set of sunglasses. I think they are the foster style. Luckily fit our 9 year old, but would not fit an adult. Won't reorder the correct pair, seem to be made of plastic."
1.0,Overly big for even an adult.
1.0,Very yellow
1.0,lo que enviaron no tiene nada que ver con el diseño de la imagen.
1.0,I ordered the outfit for a trip. When I received it I tried it on and it was what I was looking for so I put it at the top of the closet. Trip comes a few months later and I’m ready to wear for the first time. I put on the pants and the tread is coming out in 2 different places. I tried to snip the little threads and the pants just fall apart at the seams… literally! But now the window to return has closed.
1.0,I order based on measurements from the size chart. Ordered a Lg and it fits more like a small to a medium. I ended up selling to a friend of mine.
1.0,"I was skeptical of this suitcase when I received it as it seemed flimsy and cheaply made, but I decided to give it a try. It worked fine on the outbound leg of my trip, but as I zipped it up yesterday for my return the zipper broke! It left me scrambling for a quick replacement so that I didn’t miss my flight.<br /><br />My bag was only 40 lbs and was not overstuffed. I’ll be returning it ASAP."
1.0,"At first sight they look very nice, but very disappointed with the quality , they were a gift for a friend and one of the earrings broke on the first attempt of usage."
1.0,"I wish I could leave no star...there is no quality, actually looks like plastic. I requested a return months ago, still waiting for the sellers approval."
1.0,I ordered this dress according to the measurements on the site. It is at least two sizes too large. Disappointed also as the dress in the photo looked nothing like the ugly dress I received. DO NOT BUY THIS FROM THIS SELLER
1.0,They don't stay on and when she talks they would come right off. Nothing i would purchase again.
1.0,I was under the impression that I would be receiving a gold pair and a silver pair based on the picture. This is not the case. I received one silver pair. The posts are a little bent because the packaging was a small envelope instead of a box. The earrings are larger and heavier than the zipper earrings I was trying to replace for my daughter. One pair of large bent earrings was definitely not worth the price I paid. I included the smaller earring I was trying to replace to show the size difference.
1.0,NOT true to size AT ALL. I normally wear a large in athletic style shorts and I ordered a size up which is XL and they fit like a pair of underwear. They are super comfortable but I wouldn’t recommend these at all. Sizing is definitely not worth the hassle.
1.0,I have ordered different style and one black and one brown. I got two brown and the different style the metal part.
1.0,"Awful. Arrived broken, and they are not alloy. They're plastic. Not even worth a quarter. Emailed seller so we'll see if they make it right."
1.0,The band's fall out of the gear fit. A bit disappointing
1.0,DO NOT BUY THESE! THEY ARE MADE OUT OF REAL FUR!!!
1.0,It turning black
1.0,"I was very excited to receive my earring. However, once I received it, I was disappointed in the size and color. It was much larger than expected. Also, the color shown is a light pretty purple but the color I received was a dark purple almost black. Had I at least got the right color I could have tried to work with it..."
1.0,Its a wet suit with lace!!!!
1.0,"These look nothing like carbon fiber, they look like a checkered flag. Lenses are nice though."
1.0,Another questionable vendor used by Amazon. Poor quality no tags made in China. Returned it after Christmas.
1.0,"The material on this little bathing suit is the worst! It is NOT swimwear fabric. It is a weird, shiny, polyester looking fabric that would be better suited to a cheap, licensed character, nightie for someone who has poor taste. I wouldn’t be caught dead with my toddler in this embarrassment."
1.0,It’s a beautiful mini handbag. But i gove only one star because it’s too small is most like a party handbag
1.0,This sweater does not go off the shoulder. This is a med snd fits fine except the neckline is wrong. Which is why I bought it. Off the shoulder
1.0,Yes it is small! And very cheaply made. I would not recommend buying.
1.0,Did not receive item ordered.  Sent replacement.  Cheaply made.  Sharp edges. Unattractive.<br />Would not order from this company again.
1.0,Horrible quality !!!! Sizing is wayyyyyy too small. My husband was SOOOOOO excited to give me this as a gift for Christmas. It was very very late. Wayyyy too small. Horrible quality. 😒😕😠😡
1.0,These headbands are huge! They fit my head! Did not fit my baby's head at all.
1.0,the band is NOT compatible with the 38mm Apple Watch
1.0,"I have ordered many rompers from amazon, and have never had a problem. This one was awful.  The material was heavy, the fit was odd, it was too tight,  and was awkward. I can not even wear it😐😐"
1.0,Lost it’s color in a few days
1.0,To expensive for size and quality
1.0,too small for an adult and tail shorter n not as pictured. returned
1.0,"Even though it was a good price, it looked cheap"
1.0,"I haven't even had this beanie<br />for a month yet and the stitching has already come apart in two separate places. I'm not doing anything crazy, just literally wearing it. I wouldn't recommend buying this product, you can get other Beanies for cheaper with better stitching for cheaper."
1.0,Did not fi
1.0,Es un artículo muy costoso para lo que es. Entiendo que fue una mala inversión. No lo recomiendo. Se puede conseguir otros similares a un mejor precio.
1.0,The pants would be amazing but they came ripped in two places. Fit is nice
1.0,"I tried to plug it into the charger and the wires broke where they probably used wire cutters to expose the wire. Solder was fine, but useless due to wire being cut."
1.0,"Like others have mentioned, the smell of this item is extremely strong. I left it outside to hang for 2 days and the chemical smell did not go away in the slightest so I ended up returning it."
1.0,cheap not wearable had to return
1.0,"I am the typical 6ft volleyball player, long arms long torso. The sleeves barely came past my elbows but length was awesome I could have worn it with leggings. I ordered my normal  large and it was pretty tight I would want a size bigger. Will be returning, Michigan winters require long sleeves not quarter sleeve. Sad since it was a nice flannel"
1.0,"Sacred Heart / Saint Michael scapular. Though it looks very nice in the picture, it is very thin material, and the pictures are likely some sort of coated cardboard. Not well made at all, unfortunately. This is for looks more than for daily wear."
1.0,"Super cheap looking, total crap"
1.0,The clear bar never got soft enough to mold to fit so I couldn't even wear them.
1.0,Disliked the hole in crotch!
1.0,"DO NOT BUY!!!  I ordered this dress in a medium,  it looks like extra small...also IT IS COMPLETELY SEE THROUGH...I dont know where they got the pictures that show on the site, but they are misleading...SAVE YOUR MONEY.  The seller is from China and it costs more to send it back than to throw it away"
1.0,Worked for one min then something broke inside.  Would not stay running no matter how much watch was worn or shook.  Own several automatic watches.  This one is not so good.  Returned for a refund.
1.0,Any ordinary sock will work. This price is ridiculously high
1.0,I purchased these pants a while ago. I then saw them in a department store and gave them another try. These pants shrink about 2 -3 inches after washing them every time.
1.0,Cheap not worth a dime!
1.0,Leaf broke the same day.
1.0,Not a fan of this product. It’s so small
1.0,"This dress is 100% not as in the pic from the fit, color, fabric.  I was so excited about this dress but had to return it at my expense, then had to get in touch with them for my credit!  Even though it was a Prime seller with free returns.  It was very disappointing!"
1.0,"Sucky quality and completely see through, also sizing isn’t great, size up 1 or 2 sizes if possible."
1.0,"The top fit too loose and the bottoms were cut funny didn't compliment my figure. Tried xxl since someone said ran small, xl still too loose on top, and large fit ok but it felt like everything was too far in the middle of my chest I weigh 160 with 38c top. Not my cup of tea"
1.0,THE WORST QUALITY EVER!! It feels and looks like cheap Halloween costume material !
1.0,Was not what I had expected.
1.0,Looks nothing like a the the picture the the material feels like silk and you can see right though it the stitching is terrible. ..I would really like my money back because I was tricked  and I'm pissed
1.0,Dress was not sewn well. Very uneven. Unable to wear.
1.0,These are not at all what they are described to be. They don't look like the photos  and I'm not sure what they are made from but not jean material.
1.0,"I received these less than a month ago. I do all my laundry in cold water, on permanent press, and hang to dry. The seams are already ripping apart -- not just loose stitches, but 1&#34;+ holes in the armpits, and not just on one shirt but at least a couple of them. I have older Hanes t-shirts that have held up better -- they are ruining their brand with cheap quality shirts like these!"
1.0,the item came in a different color and shape and it was poor in quality
1.0,"I suggest only slim/ petite females order this item, cause its very snug on a plus size female like myself.."
1.0,This thing is tiny! I couldn't even get close to closing it. It was a few inches from my armpits. I had to return it.
1.0,"Description is misleading because it says 4"" -- but that means 4"" in LENGTH, when you hook them together, the DIAMETER is only about 1"" -- not 4"".  On first use, the threaded end popped off one of them.... making it useless.  Poor quality, in my opinion."
1.0,I wore this bracelet one time and it broke in about an hour don't buy it I was very disappointed
1.0,Let me try and keep this short and sweet with the most important points.  Band looks good and links are very easy to remove.  The trouble is sliding the band in and out of the Watch slots.  Extremely difficult and I thought I was going to ruin my stainless steel Watch.  When I managed to finally get the band off it went straight in the trash.  I worried I damaged the Watch band slots so I’ll stick with soft sport bands or genuine apple bands.  If you’re not worried about possibly damaging your Watch then I’d recommend it because it looks nice and very easy to adjust the length.
1.0,These are the weirdest fitting product I have ever received.  The pants are fine but the  is strange.  The torso of the top is loose and nice but every piece of the sleeves are way too tight.  I could barely get my arms in.  really strange.  This is the kind of thing that has me never want ing to clothes shop on line.  If I'd have tried these on in a store I would have never purchased them
1.0,Pretty dress but was way too small! It said extra large but fit like a medium
1.0,The ear loops need to be a bit longer and I wouldn’t recommend and I can blow out a match with this covering my face. There’s no slot for a filter so this was useless to me
1.0,"Beware:  LIGHTS DON’T WORK!  I had seen others say similar things, but I assumed it was one that was faulty. Nope!  None seem to work. The on/off button is close to the eyes, and the battery pack is on the forehead. I’m not sure how that will feel on the forehead."
1.0,"I hoped an XL would be comfortable and even loose but it was way too tight and way too short. And it said Velveteen and it was a shiny material. Very disappointed. I am 5'7"" and 133 pounds."
1.0,“One size” — not exactly. It is really about a size M. I am a size 14 (usually XL) and I could not even get it on my body. I gave it to my sister who is tiny (size S) and it was baggy on her but she kept it anyway. Do not buy if you are bigger than L. I would even be skeptical about that.
1.0,These are cool to have to play on your phone and remote but they’re hard to get hooked on your remote. I’ve broke 2 already trying to get them on & off my remotes. They aren’t very sturdy or well made. Do not recommend.
1.0,Pants way too small sent them back got a refund.they looked awesome just to small .
1.0,"Very stiff material, size runs small. Washed several times and no difference in the material."
1.0,"The tab for the Zip was broken when I opened the package.<br />My husband was able to use a plyer to tighten the opening and it works fine. But want too happy to open the package like that.<br />I’m sure they would have replaced it, but I couldn’t wait for a replacement. So that’s maybe more on me.<br />It’s super cute tho. My son loves it"
1.0,Not strong enough the hearts bent
1.0,Great material and fit but soooo disappointed- the checkered print is crooked at all the seam lines and its super noticeable when on- the entire dress looks crooked and cheap because of it. Assuming all of them are made this way and would cost me way too much to have seamstress realign the print so will be returning.
1.0,Bought 00 and they are only 0 and cannot return them.
1.0,Basic and not worth the price.
1.0,Not what I expected.. kinda small.. not very soft.. feel cheap.. would NOT buy again.. feel the other reviews were misleading.. The seller promised refund... but has not made good on their word... horrible experience on Amazon.. EBAY ... better than Amazon
1.0,"I had high hopes for these but was sorely disappointed. I am by no means a ''skinny'' woman, but am also by no means ''plus sized''. However, these masks do not sit flush on the face and they do not stay up at all. They slide down off of my nose and there is literally a 1/2 inch gap between my face and the masks. There is no adjustment on the ears so either they will fit you or they wont. This is by no means meant to be rude, but if you don't have a big head then they will not fit you well. Returned."
1.0,The logo is a harder plastic and this runs SUPER small! The &#34;rips&#34; in the shirt are little cuts made by a blade or something. Do not get this shirt. I could have made it better than buying it.
1.0,Pant legs are completely different sizes.
1.0,The package contained an empty ziplock bag
1.0,Cheaply made and size is not accurate... need to order one or two sizes up from normal.. the material is slick and not like a sweatshirt...
1.0,"Beautiful bracelet but I just received it with a missing stone and bent. I purchased this to wear to for my wedding and My wedding is in 6 days! I’m pissed.<br /><br />Edit * my replacement came 2 days later and it’s perfect, just in time for my wedding!"
1.0,Cheap chain. Can not remove pendant for a better chain.
1.0,Not winter boots. And the sole is so thin you feel the outer rim of the sole of the shoe. Do look very cute but no way anyone could wear there's boot and not have blisters and achy feet. And to top it off I have to pay return shipping. So shoe $12.99 + $15.99 SH $$ + $ 5.99 R SH fee in total I will get about $6 back but spent over $45 to get nothing. Don't waste your money.
1.0,One sleeve is not hemmed and the seams are unraveling in two places
1.0,Color is nice but the dress wasn't assembled
1.0,"Essentially these are disposable boots, bought them for my daughters birthday and she wore them inside, the first time she wore them outside they began peeling so I'll be returning. They are comfortable, so I suppose they could make a good pair of inside slippers for someone."
1.0,Broken up<br />No good
1.0,"no stretch at all, short, way too tight even extra large is tiny child fit maybe"
1.0,runs small and see through
1.0,"I would not recommend, but you get what you pay for."
1.0,They are way too heavy to wear!
1.0,It keeps coming a loose
1.0,"The material on this dress was awful and very heavy. Cheaply made, I returned it because it was not as described. Fit was not flattering"
1.0,"I was so disappointed with my purchase. I have bought Sarah's Silks before and love their products. The wings arrived with frayed edges, a hole in one wing!, and strings coming undone. Don't know how long that will hold up for a young child. Bummer because it was for a Christmas gift."
1.0,Sent back - very heavy and it fit like a mans tshirt!
1.0,"belt was shipped with a slice in back,should have shipped back but didn't, will not order again,poor quality control, no excuse"
1.0,This thing was too small for any normal tie
1.0,Was stained when I received it :(
1.0,I order a M size but size they send me looked like a XXL tag said M but it was to big for M size was really disappointed
1.0,THE WHITE STRIPE ON THE SHORTS CHANGED COLORS AFTER WASHING IN COLD WATER TO A GRAYISH BLACK.  THE BLACK DYE IN THE SHORTS RUNS.  BEWARE
1.0,DOES NOT fit as shown in the picture.  There was not enough slack in the collar/neck area to allow the &#34;off the shoulder&#34; look that I was initially attracted to.  Runs small.
1.0,"It was already dirty, stained, and fraying upon opening the package."
1.0,Way too big on top area. Better for well endowed women
1.0,Had to return-didn't work. The battery is probably dead but I am not paying for a new battery in a watch I've never worn. Disappointing/angry.
1.0,Exact as advertised on Amazon but you can clearly see the difference from the real product (Coach website)
1.0,"I don’t know if they make them so small to make guys feel bigger than they are, but these things are freaking tiny they make me feel like my modest package size is actually ginormous... also no pee flap is a deal breaker... do not buy these tiny flapless briefs just awful"
1.0,Saler was cooperative with return
1.0,"It's only a little big bigger than I expected, but size isn't the problem... the quality is worse than one would expect... buttons and sewing are cheap, I've only worn mine once since I bought  it and the threads are loose and two buttons broken.. it's not made for warmth at all, and is easily ripped. Be aware when buying."
1.0,"The dress itself was nice, but the slit in the back went all the way up to my butt. I tried a larger size to see if it added length; no go! If you have a longer torso I’d say this is a NO!"
1.0,This item is garbage it's not even any type of crystals. It should be put in the gumball machine for 25 cents. Ridiculous garbage. Will NEVER purchase anything from this company. Will share it on Facebook.
1.0,I bought this band for my husband as a Christmas present. It looked like the picture but the band is way too small for a man’s wrist. Very disappointing!
1.0,They arrived broke
1.0,Didn't even send the right product. Just a rose gold hoop without the flower diamond
1.0,Chain was broken.
1.0,Package lost!
1.0,I usually wear a large but I had one up one size so it would be more roomier but it's not they run extremely small not happy at all waste of money
1.0,This product does not fit how it is advertised.  The pants is discoloured and the top is pink and though ordered small came way to big. Not a good buy.  If you're considering don't.  It's not worth your time and money
1.0,This is definitely a female bag. Should state in description that it is for females.<br />It cost me $6.00 to return this item.
1.0,Came way to small.
1.0,"Absolutely,do not get these. Its stuck in my left ear and ive tried everything to get it out probably going to call my doc and get her advuce on what to do, please just please dont buy if,you like your ears."
1.0,Pretty but poorly made. The necklace literally fell apart around my neck the first time I wore it.
1.0,Unfortunately it got “loss”
1.0,"I bought these goggles in hopes of having a large, clear, dry field of vision.  Wow, it was not what I hoped for.  I'm so disappointed!  Please take my word, these goggles will fill with water maybe a min or so into wearing."
1.0,They are tight around the ear
1.0,They are NOT for toddler or small children. They are to big to fit into the holes. Dule I'm color. Would NOT recommend them.
1.0,I am 5’51/2 and weigh 93 pounds. This size small is even too tight for me!! Just a warning.
1.0,the description says they can be used on infants 8+ months. My son is 11 months and does NOT have a small head.  they fit me comfortably but will not work for the intention we had them for which was for the baby to wear them at some of the outdoor concerts we are going to this summer.
1.0,Got these for a Xmas gift and opened the case and no glasses were inside. Very disappointed.
1.0,"I was really looking forward to having the basket for an easy dipping apparatus but it was missing from my package somehow. Also, the seal of the solution was broken and it looked like some had spilled out."
1.0,"Edging fell off after first run through the washing machine.  Also, velcro pads are waayy tooo  small.  Would not close around my mother's neck.  The loose fit allowed food + toothpaste to leak onto her clothes."
1.0,Not sure where you would wear this.....to bed maybe? See-through material
1.0,U was so upset when I got this shirt I don't like it
1.0,"This is the poorest quality swim suit I have ever seen. What a joke. It is thin and see through, I can't believe they even try to pass this off. Returning immediately."
1.0,This Ekouaer Mens Robe Lightweight Bathrobe in black is made of 60% Polyester 35% Rayon 5% Spandex.  The robe is extremely sheer and you can see through it. It does not feel like cotton or have a cotton feel to me.  I didn’t like this robe at all and would not recommend purchasing it.
1.0,Fit my son perfect... but after 3 washes the seams started to unravel and fall apart.
1.0,"Not a fan, at all. Slot is way too high and the fit is not flattering on anyone above a size 2. Super disappointed."
1.0,"Last I checked, cotton wasn’t a stretchy material. 95% cotton, 5% polyester. Feels like plastic and stretches like its 100% elastic. Not breathable at all, I wouldn’t have my daughter wear this even on a cold day. Low quality and misleading description, but seller denied a refund."
1.0,"UPDATE:  Seller contacted me about the poor review.  They apologized, refunded the full purchase price and did not require me to return It.<br /><br />It is supposed to look like an optical illusion of deep holes. It just looks like spots."
1.0,Fabric is very thin when I opened it it had a rip in the front.
1.0,I ordered a XXL and it doesn't even look like a kid's large.
1.0,This is a cheaply made bag. Theres actual cardboard in the back of the backpack to make it stiff. The compartment for the pens was sewn together terribly. I'll be surprised if this bag lasts 6 months.  This bag should not be priced at $30. It should only cost about $15. Wish I could send it back but I can't.
1.0,Hated it and returned it. fabric is of Bad quality.
1.0,Extremely disappointed by this product. Only one of the two shoes light up. The battery on the one that light up doesn't last more than 20 min. This was a birthday present for a 5 years old. You can imagine the disappointment!
1.0,This tie is very low quality and the threads are terrible.  The tie bunches up because it was not sewed properly. Will not purchase the brand again.  Was not even worth wearing one time.
1.0,"I knew these wouldn't work out the minute I tried to put one on: I got the sock to fit over my first three toes (though it snagged on the third toe), but my fourth & pinky toe were nowhere near the toes of the socks. Problem is, all 5 toes of the socks are exactly the same length, evenly straight across! I defy you to find an adult human foot shaped like that. My pinky toe is so far below the sock's pinky toe that it doesn't even go partway in. I opened the package, so I can't return them; but I doubt they'd fit anyone else so I can't even give them away."
1.0,Doesn't fit around my neck. Not enough slack. Neck size 17.
1.0,Very disappointed in this item.  How can a hat looking like this that was just delivered be worn??  It’s trash..
1.0,Hem is uneven . Very see thru
1.0,I really hope they aren’t selling second hand shirts or something because mine came with an unidentified brown stain on it 🤢
1.0,"I ordered a extra large , I do with all sweatshirts I don’t like them tight but this one (I’m not a large person) was so small I could barely even get it on!! Super bummer cause I really like it but it’s just so small"
1.0,"Cheap material, super shiny and gross."
1.0,I ordered a 4xl thinking they would fit. Well the 4xl is more of a size Large USA Size.
1.0,"This bucket purse is so unusual from what's on the market that I am getting many compliments on my find. Quality is good but it needs a stronger base since it tends to collapse when put in a standing position. I expected better than this from Guess who is known for it's quality.<br />01/13/2020: Update: I gave it 4 stars to start but I'm revising - not only that it lacks a base, but the zipper isn't working even though I hardly use the purse and the silver has tarnished!!  What a waste of my money!!  GUESS DISAPPOINTED ME THIS TIME AROUND!!"
1.0,No. too small sent back. Thank you.
1.0,"They stretch out really fast, and then don’t stay up.  Poor quality."
1.0,Is warm but not a good fit at all the color black looks faded
1.0,"Product was under sized for size purchased, plus the material is not that good"
1.0,Three sizes too small.
1.0,Trash. Buy literally anything else.
1.0,This thing was on my cats collar for less than 48 hours before it turned into a rusty mess on the inside. Clearly it’s not waterproof.
1.0,Size chart way off
1.0,Product not as shown in picture.<br />It’s thick and fleece like
1.0,El material es muy sencillo
1.0,had to return<br /><br />way too small and I even bought up a size
1.0,"Extremily cheap quality, made in china thing."
1.0,The product arrived out of the package like this!!!! Totally pissed. I really liked this purse.
1.0,To straight and tight
1.0,"Read the reviews prior to my purchase and they daid &#34;size appropriate&#34;, but it didn't work out in my case. Purchased a large for my mom's birthday and was very disappointed that it did not fit.<br />I will not go throught the effort to return, as I have a friend that wears a small and this will fit her perfectly."
1.0,Way too narrow in the calf
1.0,If your going to buy this make sure you go at least two sizes up especially if you are a D or more.
1.0,Beautiful colors but didn't fit my daughter.
1.0,It was horrible looking so I tossed it in the garbage... Not worth the money.
1.0,You would need to order 5 sizes larger than you normally would to have them fit. I’m not kidding or exaggerating!!!
1.0,"Love the outfit,  but after one wash the waistband curled up"
1.0,No quality. Very expensive and dont match the picture with the product.
1.0,The material feels like paper and it’s shaped like a box not fitted at all
1.0,"To anyone,<br />I bought this product and it is wayyyy toooo small. So I tried to return it and it gave me a label to Fu Juan Sheng, meaning it will cost a lot to return this. I will contact amazon about this tomorrow . A warning to everyone else !<br />Quality of this item is another issue<br />Also it says to contact seller if there is an issue with label for return.<br />The phone number they give is 000000 NICE<br />Good luck with clothing from Asia!!!"
1.0,"I don't think you can ware this out, unless you are in a play.  I don't recommend it if you plan on we raring this out in public."
1.0,"No instructions, no charger included, did not heat."
1.0,Not meant for busty ladies. Awkward think padding. Cuts into the girls and doesn’t really look flattering at all.
1.0,"These jammies fit great and are super soft. My daughter with sensory issues approves. However, after one wash the fabric along the backside Seam is already Tearing."
1.0,La talla L es como un xs
1.0,Broke the same day i got it
1.0,the bottom seam is sewn up (is not shown in this manner on the photo).<br />The Button hole is sewn up<br />Inside pockets are poorly sewn.
1.0,I give this 0 stars! It feels like paper and looks like the flowers were punched out with a hole puncher. The sleeves fit really tight and definitely wasn't even worth $5 dollars.
1.0,These were much larger than I had thought
1.0,Liked shirt...way too small for 3X
1.0,This was probably the worst possible scenario for shipping a hat band. Absolutely impossible to make this thing look good on anything. The quality of the cheaply Chinese made band was so awful that I cannot think of anything I can do with it. Poorly manufactured along with cheap materials used in the construction makes this by far the worst purchase I have EVER MADE ON AMAZON. STAY AWAY. IF THEY HAD 0 STARS THAT WOULD BE MY CHOICE.
1.0,Im sorry it just was not comfortable at all....
1.0,I have no idea what the heck they sent but this crazy looking item is for a baby. Who's baby? I have no idea who would even dress a kid in it! Refund requested! That's just sad. Although I did have a good laugh.
1.0,Very disappointed. I ordered them along with other items & I wish I hadn't. They're cheaper looking then quarter machine kids jewelry . I guess I won't pat attention to others comments. & stick with store purchases for cute rings. Not worth 1 star.
1.0,Completely untestable.  The strap on one side slipped out of the holder every time I tried to put it on. It is hard to imagine anyone could produce goggles that either had such a bad design or such bad quality control.
1.0,Was supposed to use it for my socks but not a very good item
1.0,Too tight at ankles
1.0,"finally received the watch....took out of packaging put it on and fell completely apart!!! rivets that held timepiece fell off 2 hours after i put it on!!!"" no longer can wear it!! will never buy from this company again!!!"
1.0,This item is so cheap. It broke when I tried to put it on. Sterling Silver my behind. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!! I have bought better quality jewelry for a dollar from WISH!!! Do not waste your time buying this item.
1.0,Order a size or 2 bigger this 5x fit my 1x friend
1.0,Inaccurate description. There is nothing “bling” about this. It’s just cloth and barley purple. Disappointed.
1.0,"These sunglasses are crap. I ordered them to wear over glasses after eye surgery. They came with the lenses popped out which are almost impossible to put back in. The frames are pretty cheap plastic and they don't fit snug against my face so light enters from the sides and bottom. They almost look like they were previously worn. The darkness of the lenses are just so-so, they seem just a little bit darker than regular sunglasses."
1.0,"The sleeve tore at the seams in two places when he tried it on. I stitched those up, but didn't last a few hours when he actually wore it. That time the vest came apart in the front. Flimsy and won't last a day. Save your money."
1.0,Bottoms do not lay right and top is too small
1.0,Too big for pandora bracelet.
1.0,"Wasn’t expecting it to be so small thought it was an actual sword not dagger, my son was playing with hit a pillow(yes a pillow smh) and it just snapped like it was made of styrofoam."
1.0,"Comfortable and like the grey color, but they started to fall apart in a little over a month.  Can’t return now.  For $50 they should last longer."
1.0,My daughter used this for 1 week and the shoulder strap started ripping.
1.0,This product is complete trash. Soon as I received it I knew the quality was garbage. And guess what? It broke within 2 hours of my girlfriend wearing it. The turquoise doesn't even try to look real. There are much much better quality jewelry for the same price. I'd pass on this one.
1.0,"When I first saw this watch, I thought it was made of pewter. Which for a Dr. Who fan, would seem wonderful to have a replica of his pocket watch. When it arrived, and I oped the box, I was sadly disappointed. It looked like a child's toy, a pretty expensive child's toy. It was a Christmas gift, and I decided to let the receiver decide whether they wanted to keep it or not. They chose not to keep it-they were as disappointed as I was.. I guarantee, that there are a lot more Dr. Who fans who would be willing to pay a higher price for a true replica made of metal. If you have a child who is a big Dr. Who fan, then this would be the gift for them. But for an adult, it's not suited at all."
1.0,"This is cheap plastic. Not even close to glass, let alone Murano."
1.0,Horrible fit. They were so loose you could see my underwear standing up
1.0,Un mal artículo
1.0,"If you've ordered the full-length leggings from VIV, please be aware that these do NOT fit the same! The torso is way too short (and I'm only 5'2!). Unfortunately I've already removed the tags. Try them on before you take the tags off!"
1.0,"Very bad quality ,Buy this for my daughter, ended up in the trash, lost money."
1.0,Cheap material. Zipper broke after one use.
1.0,"I bought this shirt knowing it was fully synthetic. Some synthetics are fine. This one sparkles like it has glitter all over it, which looks ridiculous. Maybe that's because the shirt is black, but it was absolutely not what I was expecting. F-. Would never have bought this shirt if I had known it would look this bad."
1.0,This watch never worked or charged. The cord that came with it didn't fit into the watch! Defective.<br />Had to return it to Target and bought a watch from a different brand.
1.0,Can't even wear them - too thin and unshaped- should have returned but missed the window.
1.0,these are nothing like the picture. the beads are blue and the trim is gray. super disappointed.
1.0,"The old saying &#34;You get what you pay for...&#34; -_- Item arrived in great shape, fit well, maybe a little on the small side but anyway after wearing the belt once it is now broken and useless. The belt has a small ball that fits through the punched out leather holes, when I was taking the belt off the ball that maintains pressure (holding the main metal piece in place against the leather) broke off completely. It's basically the size of a plastic bb or small plastic bead. Once that piece breaks off you cannot use the belt at all. Again, the  product runs small but I had two or three options for my waist size and it was not overly tightened or putting too much pressure on the product."
1.0,The face covering slips down constantly during a run.  These didn’t work for us at all.
1.0,"Horrible fabric, very cheap looking, very large and shapeless, returned of course, looks nothing like the pic"
1.0,To small for 3xl
1.0,The inside &#34;power beads&#34; if you will are already falling apart. Does not take well to medium duty use. Scratches very noticeable. Would not buy again
1.0,Didn't even have this band for 2 months & discolored in less than a month. Did not get it wet. Stainless steel does not discolor. Very dissatisfied.
1.0,"While tie dyes are cute and colorful, the fabric is a very cheap, thin, polyester.  Not really suitable for our needs.  The mask is also very small."
1.0,Dress looked great but stained immediately by anything that touched it. Wore it once and by the end of the day it was destroyed. Tried cleaning many different ways and nothing worked. Disappointed I only got to wear once.
1.0,The dress itself is pretty… the color that came is not the color that was advertised for purple. I needed these for bridesmaid dresses but the colors weren’t the same. I tried to return and they seller said they would give me $20 and I can keep the dress. They refused to give a pre-paid label even though it says free returns. When I brought it up they said they were in China and don’t do that! I had to contact Amazon to get my refund. So if you know the exact size you need and are more flexible on color… it’s a nice quality. But CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NON- EXISTENT!!!
1.0,Over priced I have bought 3or 4 different traps over the last few years kids are tough on them this is the worst I've seen not worth $5
1.0,The stitching is coming out after wearing twice.
1.0,This fabric is super stretchy!! It said it was true to size but I ordered a large and could easily fit in a medium. I was hoping it would shrink some after washing but it seems to keep getting bigger! They are  Really big and not as cool as I had hoped either!
1.0,"The gown itself was lovely, just huge.  Too long (on 5'7""), too big and requires an attendant to put on and take off.  Unless you plan to be buried in this gown, I would move on.  Free Return Shipping is stated on the listing.  Seller said that I had to pay return shipping, blaming Amazon for not having free return shipping.  I sent it back via USPS Priority mail on 6/21/22, RMA included, and the shipping confirmation states it was delivered on June 23.  No refund has been issued, and the seller is stating that I need to prove that it was sent back in order to refund me.....again blaming Amazon policy.  I order from Amazon all the time.  This is not true.<br /><br />They lied about their free shipping, why they won't/can't honor it, and now about not receiving my item."
1.0,My 8 year old Grandaughter wanted this bracelet.  I ordered a set of 3 and the blue one broke the third day she wore it.  Glued it back with super glue and then had to glue it again with locktite super glue. I spent more on glue than on the bracelet. The camo colored one had the circle on the white bead fall out within a week. Guess it was the little plug that held the water from Mt Everest. Would not buy these again.
1.0,El plastico del dibujo se quedo pegado en el papel con el que viene envuelta la blusa y cuando lo despegue se despego pedacitos del dibujo malisima calidad
1.0,It's a cute band but it's already peeling off.
1.0,Had a day- lens’ already losing color
1.0,It’s a scam the fabric and the design is different it’s nothing how it looks in the picture
1.0,"the top stones fell off the same day I got it,"
1.0,"its ok, doesn't​ fit tight,  doesn't compress, not really liking the product."
1.0,"These earring had a really sharp setting so they cut into my ears and they took over a week to heal! Also, I don't think they are cubic zarconia they are really cloudy."
1.0,My niece had these for about 2 weeks before they broke! They are not flexible like they say. Definitely not something to buy if your child likes to bend the glasses.
1.0,On the floors it's not picking all small dust particles again we need to keep vaccum clearner it is not serving my purpose.
1.0,"Not knee high at all, came up below mid calf.  I have small feet and never have a problem with socks being small but these sure were."
1.0,The sweater arrived badly frayed and the neckline is horribly crooked. Will be returning
1.0,"Written by Nate's wife: this dress is not true to size! It's so oversized, I felt like a beach whale when I tried it on! You will need to order a size down, maybe 2 sizes down, depending on your weight. I'm so disappointed because I leave for a cruise next week and I was planning to take this as one of my outfits...now, I'm scrambling trying to find something to replace it."
1.0,"The biggest problem with this dress is it shows a huge amount of side boob. For some reason the cut comes too far inward. Never seen anything like this before.  I am a size DD bust,  but I have never had this problem in a large dress or top. I recently bought several small dresses that fit very nicely. It also hugs too tight around the stomach.  It comes to my knees in the front,  but barely covers my bottom in back.  I got it on sale for $7 so I opted to keep it. Hopefully I can figure out something with the top, especially as I love this cut and it fits me well when the top isn't cut too short like this.  If it's on sale, go for it, if it's $20, I wouldn't bother"
1.0,"Not as described at all.  Starting with the background color which is more of a pink color and not tan.  Second, the images of the bee are just black bee-shaped smudges.  They almost look like something a tattoo artist would do if it was his first day and there was and earthquake that made the lights go off but continued to tattoo in the dark with his eyes closed.  Sending it back."
1.0,Broke as soon as I put on. And I have very small hands
1.0,Item missing the bottom. to return.
1.0,"Way too small it sits right under my boobs, waste of money"
1.0,Watch hands broke after the first day.
1.0,"Is that a joke? I didn't get it. Pants fit fine waist and hip wise, but they are crop pants. Not as pictured. Very short. I'm 5'6. Returned."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:3f459c65dcad5edfb459523b269d492d]] I like the concept of the glasses but one lens won't stay up & I just took them out of the package..Not too happy about that.
1.0,All for my ex boyfriend. He loved them
1.0,waste
1.0,"Unless you have extremely large ears, then you're going to hate this! The part that covers your ears is so large that it will move anytime you move your shoulders. Just save your money and get something geared more towards women."
1.0,very small CHARM
1.0,Terrible design and not for full figures (the ones who needs support the most!) I'm a 34DDD. This I suppose would be for someone who is extremely flat. The accompanying picture is a joke.
1.0,"The pink color was definitely see through. Size on my teen daughter fit just fine, but the material was thin and she said a bit itchy. Definitely could not wear them and she's not picky about leggings. Had to return."
1.0,"it fit my 12 year old, it was suppose to be for me! Way too small"
1.0,"I loved the color and print. Unfortunately, it was too small even though I ordered 1 size larger than I am."
1.0,i ordered a 3x it fits like an extra small
1.0,Cute look but very cheap material. Returned.
1.0,Denim was hard they fit like an xxl on me way too big
1.0,Don't waste your money! This sweater is a rag and very poorly made! The edges are horrible! I can't believe INC would make this sweater!
1.0,I normally wear a large in shorts and I ordered an XL and these were skin tight! Definitely go up a few sizes!
1.0,These slippers do not have any anti-skid. My son is falling all over wearing them. Awful product.
1.0,VERY flimsy.  It is small and so thin that its like a piece of paper.  I was deceived.  Please do not throw your money away.  A terrible buy.  Almost like a scam.
1.0,Didn’t go around wrist correctly
1.0,I wanted this shirt to fit so badly but it was too big need an xs
1.0,Broke as soon as I took it out of the package; the heart broke off of the bangle.
1.0,"It looks awesome beautiful watch was removing the watch and it pulled out, I emailed seller and have gotten no response. Edit still no response from seller"
1.0,This ring is nice enough if you are a giant and have huge hands. And don't be lulled by the name thinking it will be easy to return and get your money back. 4 attempt and still no response on how to get my money back for a ring I will not/can't wear. HORRIBLE SELLER! Will NEVER buy from Dallas Prince again.
1.0,Made to small and needs nose support. I like the design for a postal worker but size disappointed me. Little over price aswell.
1.0,Nice looking bracelet. The stones fall out the moment you stretch it out. Itsnags your clothes too
1.0,"I REALLY wanted to like these shirts, as they're a unique cut. However, I was already skeptical about the order when it arrived loose inside the envelope without any new tags or packaging. At least they looked like they hadn't been worn.  When I tried these shirts in, they were extremely right around my chest, and the arm-holes were digging into my armpits. Realize that regular Fruit of the Loom t-shirts in size L are fairly loose on me.  I figured I'd try them underneath my scrubs that I wear to work, but first I decided to wash them.  Big mistake !!! They shrunk to a kids's size! But I liked the style so much that I thought about buying them in XL before I saw that XL size is over twice the price of L!  Ummm...what ???"
1.0,"Beautiful ring, terrible quality. Wore it once and rock fell off!"
1.0,It fell apart after one day of using it.
1.0,Highly highly allergic to pendant and chain. itchy and red with in minutes of putting it on. left marks for two days after putting on for 10 minutes. Not stated anywhere what it is made of. Very cheap. Most likely nickel.
1.0,"The soles started to come apart within weeks. Grand daughter loved the shoes, but did not last 8 weeks"
1.0,Cute but big and doesn't fit as expected. Very boxey looking
1.0,Bought two pairs for my kids.  First pair broke within a couple days.  Plastic snapped above lens and can't be fixed.  Avoid these.
1.0,Please change your picture as it comes across as fraud. Your mask is not fully purple. Your mask is purple with white trim. Stop creating a misconception that your mask are fully purple. This is very frustrating and I'm going to look to return and or get a refund. It is not what I ordered according to your picture that was posted.
1.0,I finally got around to installing this and both make a troublesome &#34;popping&#34; noise. I'm not willing to risk leaving them installed and amazing is telling me it's too late to return them as I had to do it within 2-3 weeks of purchase. Ridiculous. The company either stands by its product or it doesn't. Not allowing me to return it is bad business.
1.0,Not worth buying
1.0,"Nope, not even close to fitting."
1.0,Stretchy and comfy. But the dress is so short and hugs in all the wrong places..
1.0,"Ordered a size up as advised. Nope. Still to small. Even if it had fit I wouldn't wear it. Stitching wasn't symmetrical from side to side, and it looked like it buttoned in such a way that the &#34;center&#34; would be diagonal instead of vertical. Granted, it was very cheap. But even for that, it wasn't a usable product."
1.0,it was much smaller than we expected
1.0,"Broken hearts that say “never again”. These are anti Valentine’s Day, not Valentine’s Day."
1.0,"Does not fit even remotely as pictured, armholes are not large, back is not deep, and cut is not loose. Model is likely wearing 4 sizes too large."
1.0,Gets sweaty on wrist and had it for 2 months and strap catch (round loop holding extended strap in it broke. Now loose strap hangs out & gets caught on things. Cheap silicone?
1.0,Came way to big and the material felt kinda cheap.
1.0,"Cheaply made, all tags were cut out, was not as pictured!"
1.0,It broke when I try to adjust to the right Strength
1.0,Too small but super cute! Buy one size up.
1.0,"Don't look like the picture and can, at best, used for costumes."
1.0,The band was great then it separated from metal top and plastic band area.
1.0,I own this same top in a different pattern (grey with snowflakes) and it's a completely different quality. This is very thin and actually sheer. I wanted to return it but the shipping for return makes it not worthwhile.
1.0,The rings I received were NOT vinyl coated. Not as advertised.  Disappointed.
1.0,AWFUL THE SIZE WAS SO MESSED UP iT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SIZE 12 THE TOP WAS ABOUT A SIZE 8 THERE WAS NOT A LABEL OR ANY INFO. ABOUT THE GARMENT NOT EVEN A LABEL TO LET YOU KNOW HOW TO TELL THE FRONT OR THE BACK OF THE PANTS VERY POORLY<br /> MADE. I NEVER WANT TO ORDER ANY THING FROM THEM AGAIN
1.0,"I CANNOT find the hole that you are supposed to use to tie the dress closed! I’ve tried running my fingers along the seams, holding the dress up to the light, but no luck. Any photos of exactly where to look would be helpful, but I am convinced the dress is defective."
1.0,The size is too small and it’s not as the size that appears in the picture the length in the picture about 31 but it’s just 26 to 27
1.0,It broke after two days a little upset
1.0,The little shovel fell off the first time I wore it
1.0,Zipper broke the first day.
1.0,Terrible looks nothing like the picture at all the material is different the crowl next isnt even on this hoodie its terrible
1.0,"Absolutely HORRIBLE. The magnets are so weak, they barely stay together before even going in my nose! Definitely returning and getting my money back."
1.0,My pair arrived with runs in the polarization on the right lens. Really messes with vision. Cannot wear like this. Not satisfied at all.
1.0,Broke the 2nd time she wore it.
1.0,"Jacket was nice at first. I washed it as directed and after the first wash the lining got two different 6""tears in it.<br />Would not buy agian. Plus no returns after 30 days, but most jackets don't get washed till after 30 days. For that reason I would not buy off this seller again."
1.0,It fit wierd across my back.  The material was very cheap looking.
1.0,"This blazer looks so cute, but it’s 3 sizes too small for me. I could barely put in one arm. It was so tight. I had to return :("
1.0,Did not like buckels
1.0,"When you go to put the item in, the ends don't match up so the tip is pointing one way and the bottom part of the arrow isn't aligned. Would not buy again -- ended up going to the local Spencers to find the exact same one."
1.0,The heel on one of the slippers was not properly sewn in and has already broken free of the sole in less than two months time.
1.0,I literally took the band out of the package and tried removing the protective tape from the end of the band. The magnet that holds the band together came out of the the end of the band.
1.0,All four slips smelled like fish. I woul not buy or recommrnd
1.0,I bought an xxl which is what my son wears. It was so narrow I don't think my daughter who wears a medium could even wear it.
1.0,The magnet fell off right away...but it is a sturdy product orherwise
1.0,Total waste of money. I just got it in today and put it in. It went in fine but then it got stuck and I couldn't get the clasp open to take it back out. My work doesn't allow them and I work early in the morning so I had to go to a piercer at 11 at night and pay $10 for him to use pliers to pry the stupid thing out of my nose. So basically I'm never gonna put it back in and I wasted money buying this dumb thing.
1.0,Completely fell apart with the first wash.
1.0,The ring came filthy
1.0,"The material is not  a quality rayon, might not be<br />rayon. In the photo it looks great!  And the cut<br />of the garment, below par."
1.0,I know it was inexpensive but the chain turned green and rusty after the first day worn.
1.0,They look cheap and the back broke right when I put it on!
1.0,Really bad... Nver buy it.. very bad quality...
1.0,Product advertises adjustable ear loops.  They are not.
1.0,Loved it and fit great but the butt is a bit see through and there is a hole in the calf! So upset. Very cheap.
1.0,It already broke and got lost
1.0,Too big not as small as I needed it to be.
1.0,"The sleeve split on the arm, and not on the seam. It was a birthday gift. Very disappointing. Will not buy this brand again.l"
1.0,Absolutely Garbage
1.0,"I wanted this watch to work out so badly. The face looks pretty cool I think. Unfortunately, the first one arrived with a dead battery and a broken bezel around the face. The second one works but also has a broken bezel around the face in pretty much the same spot. Which is odd to me because I have other wood watches that have decorative wood bezels that haven't cracked or broken even after two years of every day wear. Also, the links don't seem like they'll stand up as there's damage from inserting the pin from the factory. Everything about what I've seen screams ""poor quality"". If you want a wooden watch, try Bobo Bird. They're not perfect either but I've had mine hold up after years of banging it on every metal door frame I walk through"
1.0,"Rather than clarifying the screen image, these glasses are for seeing at a distance.  This received 1 star since this item is not eligible for return."
1.0,Don't bother buying. No quality
1.0,Too heavy. The weight pulls down your shirt.
1.0,Cheap piece of you know what.  Do not waste your money!
1.0,"The color is quite different that shown on the picture, I can not use it as color is more eggplant then red"
1.0,This was insane i ordered a large and it looks like it is for a 5 year old i will never order clothing off here again.....
1.0,Today I put this jacket to the test for the 1st time. I was soaked inside of the jacket. This jacket is no better water proof than a regular wind breaker.
1.0,Very cheap. Already looks used and worn. The metal coating is peeling in spots.
1.0,She could fit and took s long time to receive
1.0,Not worth the price. The wrist band is a cheap fake leather. It feels like a costume plastic band that will break if worn too frequently. The watch then popped off when I was setting the time while it was on my wrist. Both pins were on the ground. Not worth your time;
1.0,it very cumbersome and it does not hold cash well. Sending it back.
1.0,Received after a month all rings were broken and split.  Save your money better quality at the dollar store.
1.0,Didnt like turning fingers green and toes
1.0,"Just felt sloppy, the seams are inside out, maybe the look they were going for? Didn’t like it didn’t look flattering at all.  Really wanted to like it!  I’m switching to amazon wardrobe, there you can try 8 items with 0 down, try it on and keep only what fits and you like! Items are limited but not too much.  I'll keep you posted!"
1.0,Didn’t care for material.
1.0,"Easily falls apart,  band drys out<br />And cracks and when it breaks<br />You have a lot to clean up,<br />On your hands and knees."
1.0,"Cheap thin see through fabric.  I am returning all 5.  If it was made in China, that explains it!"
1.0,These were very bad quality and don't even really fit on my head. I was really just expecting to get something that looked like it cost more than a few cents to make. But you're not going to get that with these.
1.0,Cute sweater but this is no where near accurate to size. I typically wear a large and ordered the XL to have a higher fit and it fit more like a small. Very disappointed. Will be returning.
1.0,"Not cashmere.  By weight, smell and feel, it's not a natural fiber.  By price, also, so shame on me, but I was hoping to get something cheap to hack into something else."
1.0,Ordered the Sailor Moon pack for a birthday gift and received random super heroes instead. Have no time to return the items  or exchange because it arrived the day of the party late at night (today)
1.0,"At first I was very happy with these clip-on shades.  They fit exactly as promised, they're easy to install and remove with just one hand, and they don't take up much room so they're easy to carry when I don't need to wear them.  But after a month of using them, I discovered that they scratched my glasses right in the center of the lenses.  Now I have to move my head up, down, or to the side because I can no longer look at anything that's right in front of my eyes."
1.0,Unable to get rid of static cling.  Would be cute if you could.
1.0,cheap product.
1.0,These seem like nice socks and the tag is nice. They seem decently made. They fit. But my 3 year old is very disappointed  that they don’t glow in the dark. That is why we bought them! I’m not sure if we got a bad pair or what.
1.0,Two rings were broken on arrival. Terrible.
1.0,Unfortunately arrived with a bent post  I am returning them but will order another pair. They are small but beautiful. They will be appropriate for my work.
1.0,The fit is great but the strap runs really bad under the armpit and it’s very uncomfortable 😣. I literally had to stop at JC penny’s to buy a bra so I could take this bra off. I donated it hopefully someone can use it. Literally wore it maybe less then an hour. The wire digs into the armpit
1.0,Horrible dress
1.0,Such a bummer. I was so excited! It fit! It looked cute! Then I noticed discoloration on the front. I took it off to observe and there was some knitting in the seem on the back.<br />I requested a replacement but they are sold out!
1.0,Super cheap plastic that was too tight behind my ears. It also came with a warning sticker that the glasses contain a chemical known to the state of California to cause cancer. More specifically reproductive cancer. I know they are just a cheap pair of glasses but wow.
1.0,The fabric was good but overall the dress and service was not the best.
1.0,"Probably like so many other Amazon shoppers, these tops pop up on your search bars. Well, this time, I chose to click and buy one. I read the sizing and materials thoroughly (so I thought) and was eager to get the top. A hoodie this style is right up my alley. Well, to my surprise the shirt was too small. The arms were easily 2"" too short and cut under my arms, which made the body of the top rise up awkwardly. I had to return the top to Amazon. I would be cautious when you buy this top, possibly by large."
1.0,"These are my THIRD pair of Quay sunglasses, and I have to admit I'm done with them. The sunglasses are cheaply made, overpriced and not good quality. In my opinion, it's better to save up and buy an actual designer pair. Ugh, I wanted to love these so badly."
1.0,The sizing chart is still small<br />The leather-like material is thin and cheap.<br />It is not steel boned
1.0,It fit wierd the body was tight but the arms were very loose. Also the material seemed cheap and scratchy. And even though I ordered the gray it was more of an off white. And then after one wash with only other white clothes it turned pink. Nothing else in the white load turned pink......I would say go ahead and skip this one.
1.0,Doesn’t fit
1.0,Both bracelets broke within one day. Super cheap and cheesy
1.0,Terrible product. Too small of a diameter for anyone's nose.
1.0,The blue is not the same as pictured.  Quite large and stands high. Don't like it.
1.0,Some reviews state that it runs big. Thats what I was looking for I ordered an xl to account for shrinkage as I wanted a larger size. It fits like a medium not an xl and the IMAGES ARE MISLEADING THERE IS NO WHITE SHIRT/DRESS INCLUDED OR ATTATCHED!!! *VEST ONLY
1.0,"I bought these because it says surgical steel. I have tons of rings and studs that are surgical steel, these are clearly not! Within a few days it turned green. Now my septum is in a ton of pain and super irritated. DO NOT BUY!"
1.0,"If you have no intentions of moving or doing anything at all, these feel nice I guess. In every other aspect of being gloves they're underwhelming."
1.0,"Loved the band, but not the way it connected to the metal. It separated and the fit bit fell off, lucky it wasn’t lost."
1.0,They dont have accurate size their xl means medium very funny siz
1.0,"I was disappointed that this was not of sweatshirt material.  When you think of sweatshirt, you think it will be made of a warm fabric. This is not a warm shirt at all. Very thin silky like a material. So, so disappointed."
1.0,"I am so disappointed. I received this purse on February 23 and today April 6 I noticed the purse becoming detached and falling apart on both sides (see pictures). I only have my wallet and glasses in the inside of the purse, so it is not weighted down. For $45.99, I would have expected the purse to last longer. I rarely buy things other than books and gifts for my nephews  on Amazon; now I remember why. Very disappointed.<br /><br />***Update: although the purse I received was not quality, the seller went above and beyond to make things right. I was given a refund. Although I do not recommend this purse, I highly recommend this seller."
1.0,"Lovely pattern, but lining is already separating from the outside of the case. Only been using the case for light use. Will not be re-purchasing."
1.0,Broke within a day.
1.0,Ear piece broke on first day. Made out of foam.
1.0,They were very small and fell apart and they will not let me return them
1.0,Terminacion muy mala mala calidad para su precio
1.0,"Cheap Chinese Crap, Useless as hell! Broke the second i unfolded the arms...."
1.0,Had to return because the plastic sleeve that the metal jewelry is supposed to slide into was cracked on both of the pieces I ordered.  Complete trash right out of the package.
1.0,Item is very cheaply made and was about 2 sizes smaller
1.0,The clasp on these were not good and bent when I wore them.  I lost and earring the first time because of the flimsy wiring.
1.0,"Loved this, at first 😕 I bought it to wear for 4th of July weekend and it was great for about 4 hours...then the underwire poked through the fabric and rubbed my skin raw. Tossed it after that one wear."
1.0,Product described as 16g but is really 18g.
1.0,"The interior material of the shirt was very cheap. I liked the design, but the shoulder seams were in the wrong spot which made for an extremely awkward fit."
1.0,Mine came with no adhesive what so ever
1.0,"I was excited to receive this dress because the image makes the dress look flowy and soft, which I thought was perfect for spring. However, after trying it on, the dress poofs out below the upper breast portion in a way that is unflattering on the stomach. Also, the material is not soft or smooth, but is plastic-like, reminding me of cheap tablecloth or party city costumes. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this dress."
1.0,Terrible the skirt was very cheap the Zipper was already broken material felt like the cheapest denim like a paper sack will never order again
1.0,Didn't do a single one of the things promised.<br />Just yellow tinted plastic.
1.0,"Cheaply made, and incredibly flimsy. I immediately returned them."
1.0,Not worth it's weight in dirt.  It didn't fit the recommended hard hat liner. It's made for a child. It's tiny...
1.0,Terrible. Not even worth my time to send back.
1.0,Well made...for someone who is 34 D....<br />So what???!!! I needed and purchased the largest size...This Company has deceived me for the LAST TIME!!! SHAME ON YOU!!!!
1.0,Way to small and don't have any stretch in them at all.
1.0,"I loved the design and verse, but...my son wasn't even able to wear it, the first time I picked it up, the clasp broke off in my hand. VERY disappointed."
1.0,This product was disappointing. I ordered an xxl and the tag says that but the actually size was a small. No charger nothing just a vest from a company that looked like it was made in china. Don’t order. I am returning this asap and getting my money back. Not worth one penny.
1.0,These socks are like soccer socks… maybe if you’re really short they would be thigh high I’m only 5’7
1.0,Rings poor quality. Come apart and charms come off. I repaired myself. Deer antler broke within the first week. Pretty much wasted our money. 😡
1.0,Broke after wearing it two times
1.0,Love the shirt but within a week this shirt had a hole in it
1.0,Didn’t last that long before stitching ripped
1.0,"Returned. A ball of lint, horrible fit. Might be better for girls. Not for American athletic men."
1.0,"DO NOT waste your money on this product! The plastic pairs get stuck in your ear. I thought it was a defect with the first pair and then it happened with the second pair I tried as well. I have to go to my piercer to have him remove them since pliers, gloves, nothing is loosening it!"
1.0,"don't buy this band, the overlap of the band will not stay seated into the main band."
1.0,Cheaply made and u can tell...
1.0,They run very small and they are very thin material
1.0,"Small Bobby pins attach pins to clothing briefly...they fall off and get broken.  Also, only about half our pins worked."
1.0,Ordered the white one it is extremely thin
1.0,"This product is not as described in the title. It states it's strapless, it is not. The material is cheap and thin, stiff, and see through.  I am returning it."
1.0,I ordered US size 6. The sandals were marked size 6. They were easily an 8 or larger. They were nearly 2” longer than a US 6. The quality is nice but the sizing is way off.
1.0,"The sizing was so off on this cardigan, it made it hard to even be able to rate the style or quality of the fabric. I always wear an XL, but this was closer to a 3-4XL. It was so ill-fitting, it would be hard to tell exactly how much someone would need to size down to make it work. Really liked the color blocked look, so I was bummed it didn’t work!"
1.0,Buckle broke before it was even worn.
1.0,Doesn't work at all
1.0,"Love the chain, hate the plastic loops for the glasses!  Within one hour the plastic fittings stretched out, and despite my attempt to re tighten the metal clasp, it stretched back out again.<br />Waste of $$ but I will take the chain to the bead/craft shop and see if I can find a better solution for the eye glass holder."
1.0,I bought this because in need a ID205 watch band but this was way to big and dose not work with the watch.
1.0,"If I could  give the packaging 0 stars I would  because I didn't know  wat was wat and half the Crystals in their was the same , they was nothing of what it said that was in their"
1.0,"I was excited to get these glasses but soon realized they only changed the bright headlights to yellow instead of white, so there was no reduction in the night glare.<br />The second pair of glasses arrived broken (as shown in the picture). Guess what? I have to pay to return them so they'll replace them. Oh brother! So, now I've sent an email about returning both pair. There's probably something in the fine print about not being able to do that..."
1.0,This item did not make the oil and water mix at all. I had even contacted the company and they recommended this item for making my home made foaming hand soap. So I just wasted my money!
1.0,Very Cheap looking. and cheaply made.
1.0,I should’ve read the reviews this isn’t holographic
1.0,One was broken and could not be worn. Rhinestones were already falling off when I opened them.
1.0,It is awful a waste of money.
1.0,"I usually wear a size 14 in jeans. But I got a 16 because I wanted these to be a bit comfier.<br /><br />Well, they were at least 2-3 sizes smaller than what I needed. I was shocked when I tried them on and I was unable to even zip them up. I needed at least 3-4 more inches in the waist to even get it buttoned up.<br /><br />These were EXTREMELY small. Idk if it's one of those amazon seller things where depending of the color you choose they fit different but based on the reviews I was surprised by how inaccurate the sizing of my pants was.<br /><br />Do not recommend. I'm returning them"
1.0,was broken when received.
1.0,"Its too small, i wanted it for my birthday but it couldn't fit"
1.0,Material is too rough and scratchy.  Definitely not like the pic.
1.0,Was sewn so terribly that I couldn’t even get it over my head. Horrible quality.
1.0,"Do not buy these. I couldn't get any of them to actually go on the ear, and because of how hard I tried, my ear was sore for a week."
1.0,These rings are made of cheap material they look and feel like something you get in a quarter machine. They will immediately tarnish after one wear.
1.0,Right when I got them they broke like the metal piece just broke
1.0,"No stretch to the fabric at all. Very cheap, sheer fabric. Horrible."
1.0,"I swear that the sweatshop these came from actually made them backwards.  The size was a little smaller on mine but they were also fit very uncomfortably.  Every time you bend your knee...even to walk, the fabric in the back is pulled down off your waist.  Just wearing them while standing still they have a ""pull"" to them in the front.  I may be 6'3"" and about 250 but when I order a TALL size I expect a longer inseam as well.  I didn't measure it when I got them but that had to be off too because the very bottom of the crotch was pushing into my inner thigh and making my privates REALLY NOTICEABLE but they where sitting on my waist the same way I wear everything.  I would take a pass on these.<br /><br />NOTE: I'm a white boy with a booty and happy with my booty but please know that these shorts have NO butt room.  This is the strangest most uncomfortable pair of shorts I've ever worn.  Also the material was really low quality and poorly sewn."
1.0,"Deceitful description, not made for very long dreads!!"
1.0,Badly made. See through
1.0,These are very thin and bendable. Not happy with the quality.
1.0,"Not what I expected, color was way off .material look cheap, thin, very disappointed"
1.0,Horribly made. I'm returning
1.0,Dislike! It's for a kid
1.0,The quality of the material is bad. My girlfriend felt itchy after wearing it.
1.0,Actual ring looks nothing like this photo. Ring is very thick and the stone is not the same color as what's pictured.
1.0,Arrived with a strap already torn off....
1.0,small and cheep
1.0,"I've been trying to tell you for nearly a month, now, that I want all the money my daughter spent on 2/11/15($111.0?) returned. You have so far returned only about $35.00. I would accept partial credit, but need money always in the second half of the month. Please do help."
1.0,I know it's a cheap price for a skeleton watch but this very very poor quality. I have seen watches at dollar stores that are of higher quality than this. To make matters worse the watch was not even functioning when I took it out of the package. Will be getting a refund
1.0,"I did not receive the dress pictured, I received an entirely different dress. The dress that I received was still cute, but doesn't seem all that well made. Also, glitter is everywhere."
1.0,I have now owned 2 pairs of these. BOTH ripped in the crotch within the first few times wearing them. The first time I thought it was a fluke but NOPE. Garbage pants. I would recommend looking elsewhere.
1.0,"Dont waste your money, the material is cheap and the dress is not up to the knee as shown in the picture.It pains me that i even paid for shipping"
1.0,"Somewhat small. Very loose on top, really tight on the bottom. Poor quality."
1.0,"This band was too big for me, I ordered small received a large they sent one instead of 2. The band did not fit or have have the proper clips, on one side was too big."
1.0,Hips are extra extra big! shaped weirdly.
1.0,This was nothing like the pictures. It was huge and fit very boxy. It was not flattering att all and is being shipp
1.0,Hugs the body nicely and isn't a bad fabric but it was so short on me about 1/3 down my thigh
1.0,"The item came faulty. The lighting bolt would show the proper lights when double tapped but not shock would follow. $140 would have been wasted, thank you Amazon for the refund! I was super excited to use this too."
1.0,"Received the shirt today.  Ordered small/ packaging says small, but the shirt that came with it is a 2xl. Disappointed!"
1.0,"My baby hat had a hole in it a week later, and I'm not sure how it happened."
1.0,"It loses and gains time from day to day. It scratches fairly easy. Links in band kink often. Getting remotely close to water, makes inside of bezel fog up. It looks good though."
1.0,It looks like the arms are embroidered... they aren't.  Looks cheap... and it was.. I would not recommend.
1.0,16 months in and the motor died
1.0,These are not original Levis jeans
1.0,False advertisement
1.0,Will be returning unfortunately. My fitbit keeps falling out.
1.0,"I really wish I would have kept the package to return this, its flimsy and the green is not an army green, more like booger or puke green"
1.0,"Not worth the money,<br />It last just a few days. Very Poot quality"
1.0,"I have 14.5"" calves and ordered the large. I couldn't even get them over my foot it would never fit a 16"" calf.  Materials seem good but I had to return them due to sizing issues."
1.0,It didn't even come at all...what a shame
1.0,Right out the box. I adjusted it and then it broke.
1.0,Too small& tight. Orger one size up unless you like extremely fitted ones. Great colors
1.0,"Not what I was expecting, cheap :/"
1.0,Absolutely NOT a plus size.  I am a 2x and not even close to fitting me.
1.0,"Not worth the price, holes after first wash!"
1.0,Returned it back
1.0,Crappie! Cheap cheap
1.0,"The shoes looked great, but the soles started falling apadt adter 1 month of wear. The zip tie instead of velcro was terrible for my 4yo. I couldnt secure them snug enough, and when i dod the string touched ground. And the would loosen after a little time wearing. Would nor recommend."
1.0,I know you get what you pay for but this picture was pretty cute. Irl it looks super cheap.
1.0,Very poor quality product. I am so disappointed
1.0,"Horrible socks!!  I thought that spending a little more I would get a better sock, not the case here, they are really thin and it feels like I am walking without socks, I didn't want to send them back so I just double them up, that way I can at least use them!!"
1.0,Pretty but don’t last. The ball fell off while I was taking off my shirt last night. Will be returning. Had less than a month.
1.0,These broke the second I put them on. Very poor quality. They are also ridiculously heavy for your earlobes. Not happy. I'm bummed because they looked as if they would have been perfect to wear to a wedding I am in.
1.0,Second time ordering first time it was way too short . Ordered again and it looks the same . Very cute just too short
1.0,Way way smaller than size chart guidelines.. and flimsy material. Wear size 10 and their size “US L” looks like tiny person clothes.
1.0,Every single one were broken when they arrived
1.0,"Poor quality, rips hairs, very loose (band moves side to side even when removed links). Super dislike and would never purchase again"
1.0,"This is a beautiful watch, but it doesn't work. I took it to a watch shop to see if it had a dead battery, but the battery was fine. He said it would cost at least $40 to repair, and since the watch only cost $16.99, I was unwilling to pay that."
1.0,I was so excited to find a plus size version of this style bra. Unfortunately when it arrived I was horribly disappointed as I stared at what I can only describe as a training bra. Double checked tag thinking they must have just sent the wrong size. But no such luck. Don't bother wasting your time or money on this if you truly are anything larger than a B cup
1.0,Package was empty
1.0,It has a label that says not to be used in winds above 5 mph. Today the wind was 7 to 8 Mph and it broke right at the pole piece that holds the arms. Aluminum pole is far too weak.
1.0,"Minus 2 Stars: I did not use these shoes for anything, they walked straight to the round file. I could have wrapped my feet in paper bags and they would have been a higher quality shoe than these ""shoes""."
1.0,"i was really excited to recieve this really cool ear piece. As soon as i had recieved it, i tried it on. its mad from reallly bad metal and bends to easy. it did not fit my ear. unless you are a person with the ears of a 7 year old. please do not waste your money on this."
1.0,Do not buy this thinking that it is one of those supportive bras because it’s not and it is very cheap fabric and the strap that goes in the front doesn’t give you support at all. The strap that goes in the front is pointless if the bra has no secure support itself.
1.0,"And it really is a plain, and ugly wallet. The inside is lined with a stiff nylon type material. It also has a little piece of material hanging from it like you see on leather products, but it isn't stamped with the word &#34;leather&#34; on it, or anywhere on the wallet for that matter. It looks as if it was painted (and smells like paint), it is not dyed. The tag might fool people, but I know leather and this isn't.<br /><br />The texture of the tag should look and feel like suede (tanned leather is always like this on one side), and if you don't know leather well it can fool you. This is to soft, so I scratched the &#34;suede&#34; side with my fingernail very lightly and the material came right off in a fuzzy ball, (leather doesn't do that) it was a fuzzy kind of material, like felt.<br /><br />The smell is unbearable to say the least, it smells like a very strong paint. I didn't even bother trying my cards it it, I put it back in the box and am sending it back. This will be my first time ever sending anything back to Amazon. It seems like Amazon will sell anything these days without checking out the actual product. I am very disappointed in this wallet, Amazon, and the company who made it.<br /><br />I have a beautiful gold (dyed leather) zip around, well made leather wallet with the company emblem on it (in metal) and a extra pocket on the back of it. I have had it for about 10 years and it is still like new. But I decided to get a RFID wallet and have been looking for awhile now and finally decided on this one even though it was plain. The company name is stamped on the inside of the wallet instead of the outside, which is very odd, and nowhere is there a tag saying where it was made like you see on ALL wallets. The box says made in China though, which I honestly don't care where it was made, I would prefer USA made, but rarely can you find that these days. And I have gotten some beautiful, well made products from China.<br /><br />For those of you who buy something and don't want to mess with sending it back, that is what the company is hoping, and expecting you to do. Don't ever hesitate to send it back. This is a cheap wallet, the cost, and the material. I should of known better just by the price alone. So off I go to find a RFID Leather wallet elsewhere, I won't buy one on Amazon again. I love pretty much everything I get off Amazon, but as I said before, it seems that many of Amazon's products aren't as good as they used to be."
1.0,Fake. Get the real one made in the USA. Rip off.
1.0,I ordered a plus size costume and it fit like a large.
1.0,They may fit a child.<br />Way too small for an adult.
1.0,They had holes in them
1.0,This company is a fraud. They send sweatshirts that run small. Poor quality material. No labels on product to indicate size. Not matching the picture. Will not return or exchange after purchasing and wishing company return policy guidelines. Contact several time and was told to regift to someone and given a 10% discount on reorder. Asked to return and I was given Vietnam address and the Hong Kong with the intentions of just sending my item to a fake address to get lost. Don’t waste your money. Unfortunate to see Amazon promote such company.
1.0,"Iam an average size person and this necklace makes for a better bracelet than necklace. Too small even for a choker,<br />What the heck!"
1.0,When I order the shirt it said it would be delivered from Amazon and the next day. As soon as I placed the order it gave me a delivery time between 15-24 days. I wrote the company and they said it will take 15 days to deliver. Then when I got it was way too small and the tag was cut out of it. The shirt looks more like a size 8. Definitely going back! Amazon needs to be checking out these companies out!
1.0,Dress too small and ordered in my size - per size guide amd other reviews. Return policynis a sham. This was previously another company. Keep changing name to avoid customer service. Bad business.
1.0,Sizing is a joke. Order 2 sizes up.
1.0,"I ordered 2 size Medium (4-5T) skirts for my 3 and 5 year olds, who are average sized. These skirts literally look like their made for about a 12 month old. They are tiny. I took a gamble ordering something that only had 1 review, and it did not pay off. Don't make the same mistake I did. Yes, they are super cute, but not functional as the size advertised. I'll be returning promptly tomorrow, and ordering a different skirt."
1.0,Will not buy again very poor quality one pocket smaller than the other no pockets in the back fit too tight in the groin area size was not xxl
1.0,"These gloves suck! They aren't even warm, and they call them &#34;extreme winter gloves&#34;! These are also false advertising cause they don't allow me to use my phone. Horrible!!!!!!1!!T"
1.0,Fell apart after a day! Though id be able to get at lease a little more use than a day! The part that holds the screw for side broke completely off. I take acre my things and keep them in cases and it look like it disinigrated or something.
1.0,this is 24mm extremely big would not purchase again.
1.0,"I have a feeling this runs in women's sizes and not men's. I ordered an XL for my boyfriend and when it arrived it looked like a women's medium! The sleeves are incredibly short, as well. Don't expect this to be anywhere true to size. You'd have to order 3 or 4 sizes up to actually get the right fit."
1.0,"Wore it for about 3 days before taking it out. It has very sharp edges on it, which my husband described as feeling &#34;like a fish hook raking my skin&#34; during a ruined intimate moment."
1.0,I have small breasts (34)  so I ordered a large dress to relax around the house in.  Probably not going to happen.  The dress is too tight across the breast area and the armholes bag open to expose more than I care to show. Not even going to bother to send it back. Not worth it.
1.0,Looked like kids jewelry from the DOllar Store!!!
1.0,Smelled & fell apart before even opening the pkge!  I  gave it to goodwill
1.0,"Looks good at first but leather is so thin.  See picture where a small hole has developed.  Even though this is cheap, I would apply that money to something nicer."
1.0,These are not sock they are more like xmas stockings they are huge not true to size . There are something you wear around the house as slippers
1.0,Poor quality. It broke the second day I wore it.
1.0,The straps were not usable they were too small to attach
1.0,This belt is totally useless.  The cheap plastic buckle kept falling off of the belt.  I returned it to Amazon.
1.0,Not even close to being the same color as pictured.  Its more like a christmas green.
1.0,"Horrible misleading pictures, so tiny should cost .69 cents not $17.99"
1.0,"I don't advise buying this.. The way you close it is sucks.. It annoys me everytime I put my hand in my pocket, the bracelet opens by itself."
1.0,Not good quality at all! Disappointed.
1.0,"I ordered 2 pairs of these in size M and the sizing varied widely! The black pants did not fit and were too small, but the grey pants would barely fit a small child. Make sure to get at least 1 size larger as the fabric is ungiving and rips easily."
1.0,"Do not buy these, they are too fat and do not stay on"
1.0,It has a STRONG STRONG chemical smell even after washing it twice. Very unpleasant!
1.0,I did not receive the product pictured. They were not braided as the product describes. They were just straps. Most of my shoes are 7.5-8. My feet were spilling over all edges of the shoe. There was also damage to the left shoe.<br />Really disappointed because I wanted to wear these on my trip to Hawaii.
1.0,"I bought this product for my wife, it looked like itwas a nice set, the second time wearing it the bracelet broke! The earrings stones fell out on one side. Would not recommend this set"
1.0,broke the day after I put it in!
1.0,"WAY TOO SMALL!!<br /><br />I'm typically a XL/L shirt guy and I ordered a XXL because I read the reviews saying they run small. The shirt that arrived said XXL on the tag so all good there. However, I couldn't even get this shirt to button it was so tight! I would say its more of a small than XXL. Also the material was very thin and transparent."
1.0,The band doesn't keeps falling apart
1.0,The dress had a huge whole cut out of the middle ... A big scissor slip
1.0,"Good fit for a toddler, at best...."
1.0,Not as sheer as the image suggests it’s heavier more like compression wear. Poor craftsmanship it arrived with a small hole in the neckline and in the armpit area so disappointed
1.0,Lost what litte stretch they had within the 1st time my daughter wore them. I'd rather buy the basic super stretchy ones for more money.
1.0,Disappointed thought that the pants had sequins all the way around and they're only on the front of the pants.
1.0,I ordered this skirt but received one that looks nothing like the photo. No pockets. No zipper. No bow. It was an elastic band with fabric. I could have made it myself at home for cheaper. Was very disappointed.
1.0,"Product did not look like the photo, ring was bent, and inscription is very hard to read."
1.0,The color is not the same as the picture and ran way smaller than expected.  Had to give to my sister.
1.0,One side of the band would not stay fastened and the other side would not come lose. I had to push and pry until it broke into little pieces to get the watch band off of one side after the other side kept popping off when I was wearing it.
1.0,"Upon arrival, I tried to put this on. It took me a while to realize that the links were backwards. It wasn’t fixable. Even if I removed the link, the connection link to the rest of the band was also backwards. So, I returned it."
1.0,"Found cap to be crooked, middle stitch not centered, and the leather on the button (on top) coming off....maybe I just got a bad one!"
1.0,I can not use it . Have not tried it and don't have desire to screw with it
1.0,Knock off. Not the real Gen 7
1.0,"I bought these little red shoes for my Granddaughter.<br />The shoes are very very small!<br />I cannot get the seller to respond, because I want to return them."
1.0,When I first put it on zipper came up smoothly but could not unzip it. Zipper was stuck and no amount of maneuvering or manipulations could get it back down.
1.0,The picture
1.0,"I just finally decided to use my band after receiving it a few weeks ago. After a few hours, it just popped off. Then, the item wouldn't re-engage or connect. I attached it again to my original Fitbit band and that works fine. Then I put it on this new one again and it engaged. I am really hoping that it doesn't pop off again as I could easily lose my Fitbit. The comfort of the band is nice though."
1.0,I ordered a large and I think was it meant was oriental large which is really a USA small. They are rough to the touch and I'd never buy them again.
1.0,Tab our broke on both sides Lenses wont stay in the frame
1.0,"These goggles are not anti-fog, nor are they leak proof.  Both of these leave to NOT clear vision.  Epic fail on this order"
1.0,sizes are HUUUUUGE
1.0,"I used this strap for one day. I attached it to my wallet and wore it as a wrist strap on two errands, and by the end, the grommet that held the whole thing together had broken. I got what I paid for, and it wasn’t even worth the hassle of returning."
1.0,"Look at them and knew they wouldn't fit, they look like pasties"
1.0,"You get what you pay for I guess.  It looked so bohemian and free spirited in the photos, but it's just a really cheap crappy necklace.  Don't waste your money."
1.0,Cheap and ripped when opened
1.0,Looked pretty good but After two weeks watch stopped working. Can’t even open it to replace the battery. I guess for $12 you get what you pay for. Wouldn’t recommend it. Waste of money and time.
1.0,"This shirt is not as pictured. It has a band on the bottom. If you try to return it, you have to pay shipping to CHINA. I do not recommend buying this shirt. It took a long time for me to receive it."
1.0,It was so small and the art work looks very shadowy... I ordered a 5x
1.0,I ordered according to your size chart but the dress is way too tight. Now it's too late to get another.
1.0,"The dress is exactly as described on the site. Two huge flaws tho.....the lace is very scratchy and the chiffon is very thin. I returned it for these reasons. This is not the dresses fault but it also looked terrible with my skin tone. I am of Irish and German descent, blond and blue. I hope this helps :)"
1.0,"Order this if you too, enjoy feeling like a Willy Wonka gang member Oopma Loopa or an exotic potato sack with a bow. Short girls, as you can see, it really enhances your height and flatters your curves like a BIG fluffy storm cloud! After being so excited to receive this, I was even more excited to NEVER wear it in public or anywhere... ever."
1.0,"Bought this for a work Christmas party, it was extremely thin. Did size was really small, and the back was missing the button closure. Suoer disappointed and returned immediately."
1.0,Product is cheap and thin. Bottoms have pink/ brown in them and top is an ugly green color nothing like the photos!! Don’t waste your money
1.0,"I love Fossil products but Fossil has THE WORST customer service. I ordered and paid for this wallet for my husband's Christmas present, which never came, and still as I write, Fossil says they know nothing of the order. I've contacted them multiple times and they refuse to help. An Amazon representative attempted to contact them for me, she too got the run around. I did, however, go to the mall, on Christmas eve, and buy yhis very same wallet so my husband wouldn't be without for Christmas and it is a very nice item. Too bad Fossil employs a bunch of heartless Grinches!!"
1.0,"This top is, I kid you not, made with a pattern for pre-teens sizes. It is smaaaall in a ridiculous way, not in a short, cutesy, cropped kind of way. Sent it back so that an 11 year old can purchase it."
1.0,The material is cheap and it fits too loose.
1.0,Definitely not fluffy like before. :(
1.0,This item was smaller than expected. The material is shiny and not exactly what I expected.  Would not recommend.
1.0,"The material is quite inexpensive feeling and the size is very, very small compared to what it should be. It will barely go on..."
1.0,Horrible. Very disappointed.
1.0,The bracelet is beautiful however this is the only thing that I can say good about this item. The ankle bracelet broke the very first day. The ring on the clasp came apart and it fell off. I put 2 stronger rings on it for my wife and put it back on her. She has been wearing it with no issues for 3 days now.
1.0,"I bought this for my daughter to wear to her 3rd birthday party and it was significantly too small.  My 3 year old is tall for her age and about 30 lbs.  Honestly, the size wasn't clear in the description.  The title just said &#34;3rd Happy Birthday Girl two piece&#34;.  I assumed it would be big enough to fit an average sized 3 year old...  but no.  So don't be fooled by the title of the product."
1.0,"Not only are these not waterproof, they seem to absorb water and transfer it directly into your shoes. Worse, they take forever to dry. Good for maybe 5 minutes of light rain and then you might as well stick your feet, socks and shoes in a bucket of water. Total trash."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:c11d6e80cecb560bf65a6a30ca736786]] I wish there had been an option to specify that it was a high school graduation
1.0,The clasp wold not stay closed.
1.0,Product is too small for me I thought 2XL is for big guys like myself but runs two small didn't have any three XL and I'm just thinking the three XL would be two XL so very disappointed in product probably will give it to my grandson and will order again thank you Charles Etheridge
1.0,The sleeves were very itchy
1.0,I washed these socks and had them on for a couple of hours inside and then I noticed a hole in the toe area. So disappointed that I returned for a refund and don't even want to try a new pair.
1.0,"I liked it when it first arrived, but the flag started peeling off after a few weeks."
1.0,Earring was broken in package upon arrival. Not good quality.
1.0,Size is much smaller than with other brands.  I ordered 2 sizes larger than my daughter wears and these didn't even come close to fitting her.
1.0,"Unfortunately not as advertised, ordered a 14g size labret piercing and got something much smaller. Seems to be a 16g. The spike is a true 14g labret piercing stud from a piercing shop. Not worth what i paid to be honest."
1.0,I love the look but tired of ordering clothes that are too small than described.
1.0,"We've been wearing masks for 2 years now. It's not like we don't know how to take them on and off without breaking them. These masks stink. Sad because I purchased due to the ""made in USA"" hype. I think we as Americans should be able to do better"
1.0,Cheap does not even begin to describe this robe.
1.0,I was just started the large task of organizing all my purses. I went to put hook on top of closet door and it snapped right off. Terrible.  I have the one sold prior to this one and it was great quality. It wouldn’t snap even if u tried. Don’t buy this. It can’t hold your purses if it can’t hold it’s self up!!! $10.00 in the garbage.
1.0,"I recieved the necklace and thought very highly of it, then 2 weeks later the paint from the chain had worn off and gave me a rash around my neck. Waste of money."
1.0,The lehenga seems used and old
1.0,Runs very small even for Asian sizing. I got the correct size based on size conversions from Asian to US but it was still like 4 sizes too small. The material was weird also.
1.0,I was hoping this would be the heavy weight Telnyashka that I bought in Russia that the military actually wears .It is not .<br />It is very thin -a light weight cotton.<br />I hope they get the real thing instead of a product made for export for tourists !!!! ????.<br /><br />The real product - military Telnyashkas are amazing in the winter -keeps you warmer than UnderArmour or Helly Hansen<br /><br />a summer Telnyashka is a sleeveless muscle shirt
1.0,"USELESS, THERE ARE ZERO INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO PUT THIS MASK TOGETHER. IT IS NOT INTUITIVE AND AS ANOTHER SAID NOTHING SEEMS TO LINE UP. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY."
1.0,"Such a huge disappointment! The image is light, faded and just a screen print on hat. I paid way too much for this poor quality hat. NOTHING like the picture!!"
1.0,Queda muy mal. Parece de maternidad
1.0,My daughter tried it on. Did a squat . And it ripped. Not good in my opinion.
1.0,Very unhappy what I saw was not what I got I thought the pants were red and they are orange the pants look nothing like the picture I will be returning them very disappointing these pants don’t deserve a rating
1.0,"Received on 8/11/2020, wore it a few times, then stopped for five weeks while I was out of work for surgery. Started wearing it to work a couple of weeks ago, and last night it BROKE when I was taking it off. DON'T BOTHER!!!<br /><br />*Update* First, I originally gave this a ONE STAR rating because of what I stated above. When I looked back at it, it had mysteriously been changed to FIVE STARS!! I was going to change my rating to two stars because I contacted Amazon and they were able to get the seller to allow me to return it and give me *most* of my money back, plus Amazon said they would also give me a $15 credit. However, since they changed my rating, I'm sticking with the one star.<br />This explains all those times I saw people give five-star ratings with bad reviews."
1.0,"wayyyyyyyyyy too small. This is my fault for ordering anything that comes from the US unfortunately, I even ordered a womens size 12 just in case and it was still too small.  I wear a 10.5"
1.0,"If it were just the leggings for half the price I would probably give it 5 stars. But since it is a set for over $30 with low-quality it gets one star. The sports bra is awful- NOT a sports bra. It has no support, the band is loose and the cups do nothing. Even if you are small busted it is not going to work. Then the design is awful and not accurately shown in the photo. The straps come up from the middle of each breast instead of on the sides- so it is less supportive and makes everyone look like a line backer wearing a weirdly-designed bra. Its just awful. Save money and just buy yoga pants on their own from another cheaper cheap amazon seller."
1.0,Returned. Not 100% organic cotton.
1.0,After only 3 or 4 wears and NEVER putting it in the dryer it looks very worn out. So disappointed because it's a really pretty top.
1.0,"Cute,  I and my daughter would have loved it... but the back doesn't stay on the pin. We were both disappointed and even more so even I realized I couldn't return it anymore."
1.0,Please do not waste your time or money. The quality of this dress is absolutely awful. Material is thin and poor quality. Fit is nothing like the picture. Awful.
1.0,Its 2 small
1.0,I ordered this coat on December 18th 2015 and FINALLY got it  YESTERDAY!!! So I'm like &#34; Whooo hoo I can finally wear it before the winter is OVER.&#34; I open It and it's the WRONG COLOR.... 😡. I ordered WHITE and got a BEIGE one!! Grrrrrrrr... Soooooo disappointed!😏
1.0,"This windbreaker is not what I expected.  It is extremely thin and unlined.  It arrived a wrinkled mess.  The fit is fine, but longer than I want."
1.0,I liked the material because it was light and flowed well... but the dress had a noticeably uneven hem and there were loose threads everywhere. I expected the colors to be more muted and neutral and and sleeves puffed up at the top making it look less natural than I had hoped. Not worth the price.
1.0,It fits too high from the head.
1.0,"False advertising! “EXQUISITE PACKAGING: This beautifully designed premium gift set conveniently arrives in a rich gift box with beautiful artwork on all sides inside and out.” This is absolutely not true! The gift box is a black cardboard box. Mine arrived dented, with one side completely ripped apart. I might have blamed it on having been damaged in transit, however, the box lid had been held together with Scotch tape! (see pictures). The filling is brown shredded tissue paper.<br /><br />They claim, “Every small gift is perfectly placed.” I bought the set with the rose gold watch, which I had to dig for because it was not on the small black velvet pouch as pictured. I almost thought they’d forgotten to add it.<br /><br />The contents:  Dollar store quality. All cheaply made. For instance:<br />The card is some “pressed” flowers stuck on a brown cardstock card with a cheap label.<br />The eye mask lets in light through the nose cut-out.<br />The cosmetic bag arrives folded so that when unfolded it is creased.<br />The rose soap claims on the back of the packaging to, “help improve the dull yellow gas” -- What does that mean?<br /><br />What a disappointment. For $60, this is underwhelming and would be an embarrassment to give as a gift."
1.0,Do not orden this item. Theyre very cheaply made overseas. Take a long time to ship and the quality is very poor. Sizes are off! I ordered an 8 and got something close to a 9 but no way to confirm since sizes for the product are no where printed on the shoe nor material list. They get shipped in a bag and when arrive they're misshapen.  So disappointed!
1.0,Very delicate. I wore one time and switched bands. Took it out of box yesterday to wear and it was broke. Very disappointed in how cheaply this was made.
1.0,Lens was inverted/inserted backwards. Waste of money and time. Such cute glasses but poorly assembled
1.0,I paid $20 each for three clubs and two of the three broke immiediately.  Way too much for cheap plastic.
1.0,I ordered the blue and white flower dress but it arrived as an entirely different product than pictured. I received a shapeless mumu and it's hideous.
1.0,Not good quality material. Ripped after 3 washes
1.0,Feo
1.0,"Straight Chinese junk , looks nothing like the pictures. The case may be so but the band is cheap aluminum with the worst clasp I have ever seen . Opened the clasp and it broke , I have 25 or more watches,  some only cost 20 here on Amazon and they are better quality than this"
1.0,There is no shape to the outfit. It is not flattering at all. Looks like it was home-made more than store bought.
1.0,"This dress is super cute but it was clearly used, there’s obvious pilling all over the upper half of the dress. I also got the matching dress for myself and it came stained, just disappointing."
1.0,"First let’s talk about the fabric, it’s thin and not soft. Its not stretchy at all either. It’s clearly not the same product as the picture. The sleeves are too short and doesn’t even have the thumb holes. The sleeves are also too baggy. I’m very frustrated with seller. Why are you sending something different from what is listed. I will definitely be returning this ASAP."
1.0,not enough support in the top piece and the bottom was tooo big
1.0,Broke first day wearing them
1.0,Shoe fit was to small and heel support was terrible.
1.0,Don’t stick AT ALL...Useless
1.0,"I really loved these shorts when I first got them.  My 3rd time wearing them, the seam came completely undone in the back, exposing a big ""rip"" where my bottom is. Very, very unhappy with the quality of these shorts. I can't even return them!"
1.0,Color faded:(
1.0,Extremely poor quality!  Charms all fell off one by one within very short time of having this bracelet. .  Very dissatisfied.
1.0,The necklace arrived missing a stone. The back of it has sharp points that would snag a sweater or knit top.
1.0,I guess they ran out of the color on screen cause mine is bright red and salmon text. Nothing close to the real colors.
1.0,El tamaño no se corresponde con la medida indicada
1.0,"Very cheap. The &#34;gift&#34; was just a bunch of strings tied together. Not all great at all, but yea you get what you paid for."
1.0,I can’t believe they call this large it is the smallest shirt I have seen need a human size shirt please
1.0,Rubbish. !
1.0,Too bad it isnt like standard shirt sizes. I wear a 3x-4x and this fits like a 1x
1.0,Cheap product.  Uncomfortable.  Returned.
1.0,Large sock world barely go over 9y.o 65lb. Daughters leg.
1.0,Cheap look and cheap made! In the videos look different
1.0,"DO NOT PURCHASE if you want a bag that has zippers that work.  3 of 4 main zippers blew up after 2 uses.  2 of them, when the bag was empty."
1.0,Terrible cheap flimsy
1.0,Muy disconforme con todo<br />No me llego el cinturón el lazo que rodea el cuerpo
1.0,"I really want to like these, but they ear piece falls out, gets caught in my hair, and cuts me every time I try to wear them. I give up."
1.0,"No good , the heart was to big covers my entire side of my nose , the diamond stud one broke in half , very disappointed !"
1.0,bill is not much bigger than a standard ball cap
1.0,Dirty mask! This thing is scratched to hell and is completely dirty on the inside! Picture shows kind of but it doesn’t show the magnitude of the dirt and scratches. These other reviews have to be lies.
1.0,"Dead on Arrival!<br /><br />I'm an avid Amazon Prime member who has gown accustomed to the quality and price of the items that I have purchased online. So, when I saw a reasonable price for an automatic watch for women (after reading the online reviews), I went ahead and ordered this watch as a birthday present for my wife. I brought the watch into our neighborhood jeweler to adjust the watchband, and he noticed that the the automatic watch mechanism was defective when he tried to set the time.<br /><br />After I quietly shared with him what I paid for the Starking watch on Amazon, he suggested that I could buy a better quality quartz watch for the same money (and just have to pay to replace the battery on occasion). Perhaps I will should have taken his advice."
1.0,Strap thread came apart after using it for 2 weeks.
1.0,"This item is nothing like the picture.  It fits like a tent.  Super narrow in the shoulders and wide around the waist, not slimming at all.  The back rides up and the front hangs down longer giving it a look as if it is completely not meant to be.  Had I known it was coming from China I would have never ordered it.  I'm a regular size medium and slim and although it's stretchy material the shoulders are a small and the waist and hips are extra large. If you want to hide your lower end this might work for you but be warned it's not an attractive fit.  Completely dissatisfied and returning."
1.0,Es malísimo
1.0,Should have read the reviews. They were right in saying that the face shield had permanent creases from being folded in shipping. Washing it didn’t help.<br />Just have to use the hat without the face shield. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Ordered the 55mm, but received the 52mm.<br />The case my Matte Black sunglasses came in was light brown, not black as shown."
1.0,"Washed once and both bras tore in the washing machine, on delicate cycle in a garment bag. Garbage!"
1.0,Definitely need larger size can't wear the one i got
1.0,"It wasn’t anything like the picture. The lining was completely different, and the material is the jacket is woolly and worn looking."
1.0,I ordered an S and an M to try. Got an S and an L. And they both fit exactly the same! Too baggy and no shape. Plus the S has a big stain on it.
1.0,Received an empty box.
1.0,Wear 2 days and broke waste of money<br />Cheaply made
1.0,paper thin - you can see through them. The adidas emblem is on the wrong side of the shorts. Took at gamble and bought because price was cheap...I lost the gamble.
1.0,"Masks came in a pack of 10, not individually wrapped and certainly not 50 as described.  Mask fabric mottled with gray and surface is flaking off, which risks being breathed in.  Did contact seller."
1.0,"besides it's too big, cheap material, I can't say what kind of material it is because it doesn't have a tag. made very poorly"
1.0,"This jacket (I ordered the Olive green) arrived a bit later than expected -- which turned out to be fine. I opened it and it looked like a mop. A dirty mop. The material looks old (it's just the material itself, not the product or seller issue). The cut is a bit strange, not really a flattering jacket cut, more like an outdated boxy blazer cut so it just would never work even as just a jacket to throw on occasionally. I tried to pass it off to my teenager girls and they would normally love it, but said the cut was just not cute or flattering at all. It looks very cheap and dirty. I requested a return and the seller told me they wouldn't cover the return shipping and asked would I keep the jacket for 40% off? Again, this jacket wasn't worth the $50 I spent, let alone another 40% off that even. They claimed it was too expensive to return however I insisted (this is why we order using Amazon). They finally sent me a return ship label and their facility is in Chino Hills, CA (so it's NOT quite as expensive for the return lable as seller suggested -- I'm also in CA). It would have been fine if the seller just simply allowed for an easy return as they stated. I was turned off by the 40% offer (I'm sure they thought it was generous --- I didn't as I would never wear this coat after seeing it in person). Anyway, buyer beware. I was eventually refunded my money (about 2 weeks or so but I also had to email to ask them about the refund AND supply the tracking number on my end in order to get it). This was fine except that it took me an extra step to call my UPS store to ask them to look it up for me. Even the UPS wmployee said it was highly unusual for a business to ask for a customer to supply the tracking number when it was clearly received on the seller end without any complications. Just one more step in the process of not making it easy on the customer. My experience was not great."
1.0,"Second time I ordered from this company and this time the diamonds were tiny. First time was perfect and took a year for diamond to fall out, I loved em so much I reordered but this time diamonds were so tiny so sad"
1.0,Earrings broke after first time wearing them.  Very disappointed.
1.0,skirt should match size of tights
1.0,this was SO BAGY IT WAS HORRIBLE.. and it came from china or somewhere crazy= so to ship it back would be a waste of money- don't get it.
1.0,Poor material quality. Clingy.
1.0,wow what a disappointment! not true to size as the large was way too small ( I wear a 10) and the fabric was so cheap!! sent this back immediately!!
1.0,"Loved these...EXCEPT on the one side the pattern isn't lined up correctly and looks stupid :( super bummed. Other than that they are extremely  flattering and LONG, which is amazing since I have a 35in inseam. So heart broken they are jacked up."
1.0,"The sides of these pants have adjustable grommets that allow for you to make the pants any size you want, no belt needed. (Thank god, that's why they have no belt loops.) After two months, the grommets on both sides tore out of the pants. Pulled right through and no 'event' caused it to happen. Pulled on the pants, adjustment ripped right through the fabric. Noe they fit like a pair of too-loose sweat pants with no string.<br />Contacted ScotteVest, they said yep, they are covered for 24 months. HOWEVER, if you bought them from Amazon, you have to return them to Amazon. So far, after 3 weeks and 3 emails, Ive got NOTHING back from Amazon.<br />Dont buy these pants. And whatever you do, DONT BUY THEM FROM AMAZON."
1.0,Incredibly flimsy and cheap looking. Looks good here but they look more like crudely painted prop sunglasses.
1.0,Just 1 star to post - ever hear of &#34;You get what you pay for&#34;?  What do you expect for $2-$3?!
1.0,Feels weird in the arms
1.0,Too big and looked maternity. Not like the picture
1.0,This item looks great but it stopped working after about a week.  A disappointment at best.
1.0,This dress was not the same at all as the original Al dress. It did not have a corset and it did not have sheer at the sleeves . I do not recommend the dress
1.0,I ordered a large and usually wear a medium. It was still too small so I gave it to my daughter who wears a small. It was a little big on her but she will wear it. Ridiculous sizing.
1.0,Clingy- not what I expected
1.0,Broke within seconds of opening package. It does look like the picture but who cares if it can't be worn. Extremely disappointed. And it wasn't due to poor packaging it was just a broken watch.
1.0,The product was way to small to even get over my foot it probably was ok but this was an exl in mens sizes<br />and it was not large at all. I would not recommend this product unless you have very small legs and feet.
1.0,did not like fabric at all
1.0,The quality is not good. The zipper is easy to break.
1.0,"This product may dazzle your eyes, but the construction is like a toy. I wouldn't give this to an older child, let alone wear them myself or to give as a gift.  Photo hides what is uncovered by holding it.  Its heavy. The ""  metal "" appears to be plastic and the pieces are connected by an incomplete piece of plastic that one would be afraid to push together to avoid both pieces separating and getting lost or broken.  I buy some inexpensive jewelry banking on the greatly reduced price being a product of cheaply purchased raw materials. This item definately doesn't belong in this catagory. Buyer, beware."
1.0,"The ring doesn’t look as good as the photos, dissapointed in its appearance."
1.0,Product arrived in poor condition with loose threads and unravelling edges.<br /><br />Padded insert is one piece (not the typical 2 individual pads) that was made for A-B cup. Does not work for larger chest.<br /><br />Straps are set very far apart - on the back side it attaches at the base of my armpit instead of center of shoulder blade. This makes it impossible for straps to stay up on shoulder.
1.0,"Firstly, this watch and its name has nothing to do with famous Italian carmaker, Pagani! This is Chinese made watch with Chinese movement. Expect quality issues! Never mind the eye-pleasing look and low price."
1.0,"I wrote a tracking review and posted it 3 days ago regarding the fact my carry on bagcame locked and there's no way to get it unlocked without being a TSA AGENTbecause I don't have a tool that will fit in the lock and I never took the bags out of the larger bags until I got rid of packing crates.  I requested a tool to unlock it or a new bag.  BUT, I received no response.  RIDICULOUS!!!!"
1.0,I love this skirt but once I put it in the washing machine it tore up
1.0,I never received the item when I e-mailed regarding getting a status and tracking number I was given two different numbers and courriers to check with stating that I should have recived the item. Only to find out that the tracking number I was provided with was invalid with both. Contacted vendor again to be informed that for some reason the item was returned to them and they where refunding my money. Why not send it again over night or something? refunding come on!
1.0,My toe rings has broken after just 2 months.  My others have lasted for years and years.  I would not recommended Boruo brand.
1.0,"Horrible, stay AWAY"
1.0,"BUYER BE WARE NOT AS DESCRIBED<br />I PURCHASED 3 of the jumpsuits leopard, snake and another pattern. These were 2 piece sets not jumpsuits. I did not buy the bodysuit style. I bought jumpsuits. What I received was 2 sizes too small for the tops."
1.0,I don't feel I can give your company a 5 star rating. Didn't fit too big. Sorry!
1.0,Rusty after one day
1.0,Very poor quality. I used this for less then an hour at work and it completely fell apart. All the stitching where the belt loops through came out. Very disappointed. Will be returning.
1.0,They shrunk in the first wash she cant even wear them
1.0,Very cheap. Like I got from a bubble gum machine
1.0,To cheap looking and thin
1.0,I received the watch and I was not able to size the band because the pin that goes in to resize the band broke. So now I have  watch I cannot wear. Can you send me a pin to resize my watch or can I send the watch back for another one?<br />Thank you
1.0,Material looks very cheap.
1.0,Crap. Arrived broken
1.0,Horrible quality. It was stretched out and very poorly made
1.0,"It broke after two weeks.  The mechanism to set the time fell out and putting it back in place did nothing to solve the issue. I took it completely apart to see if I could do something about fixing it but sadly I could not.  I understand that if I wanted a sturdy long-lasting watch I would have to pay much more than this, but this isn't worth any money whatsoever."
1.0,This watch arrived broken and I would not recommend this purchase.
1.0,"Runs smaller than regular size, material looks cheap and collect lint quickly."
1.0,"I purchased these because of a recommendation from a plantar faciitis sufferer.  However, I have extremely high arches.  I can tell they have some arch support, but even though I purchased a size that should easily fit my usual size 8.5m, the top z strap has no wiggle room and is so tight it pushes my foot backward and makes the shoe very uncomfortable.  If you have high arches and a high top of the foot, these shoes will not fit well."
1.0,Looks great not true to American size. Runs a bit small.
1.0,I wear an 8-10 in clothes sizing and 36D in bra sizing. I ordered a large and this fit like a small. This swimsuit runs very small.
1.0,"Made in China Crap.  If you are looking for a cheap pair of shoes, these are it.  But save your hard earned money. First of all, I ordered a size 6 1/2 but received a size 7. Huge pair of shoes. No point in sending the shoes back to China. The costs to send back far exceeds what I paid for the shoes to begin with.<br />Second, the jewel toe brooch is beautiful and the reason why i purchased these shoes. However, 2 of the blue stones fell off. Not happy, but l guess l can glue gun them back on, again save your money. They arrived on time but the quality is poorly made. Service, well if you tell them what you need, pay for it and they send you something else..... How can you give them more than a star! Save your money."
1.0,This case cracked very easily and the corners broke off after one minor drop. It arrived on time but the butterflies on the back were not a clear as the picture shows. Not a good quality case.
1.0,These glasses are of poor quality and it fits extra large.
1.0,"Packaging was very brittle, looked like it had been stored near the sun. I was ok with that considering the great price however, I had to  request  refund. Product was smaller than advertised."
1.0,This scarf was torn when I received it .. the cost is too much to send back .. I would appreciate it if you could send another scarf!
1.0,This is probably the worst quality jewelry ever. Don’t spend your money! It’s a waste. Looks cheap and doesn’t bend for adjustment at all.
1.0,"Horrible, fit does not resemble the photographed shirt at all. It is poorly cut, an extremely awkward drape, and the color doesn't match what was shown. Steer clear. For $8 I won't attempt a return. Straight to the donation pile."
1.0,My daughter is a pretty solid 7/8 so we did the 3xl and it fits her perfectly. Material is very soft and stretchy and she’s in love with the dress. Very pleased with the quality for the cost especially for such a hard to find pattern<br /><br />Edit: dress was worn twice and only washed once (hung up no dryer) and all the seems are ripping out from the armpits very disappointed in the quality
1.0,"I was so excited when I received this hoodie today.  I agree with all the comments about the size of the hoodie.  There is something not right about the sleeves.  I was able to finally get the hoodie on but the sleeves were so tight I could not wear it for very  long, also the front of the hoodie only went to right above my waist line.  Pretty disappointed and will be giving the hoodie to someone  else.  I ordered a 2 XL.  Fabric is very thick and soft."
1.0,The infinty symbol does not stay connected to bracelet.
1.0,"I’m in love with this hoodie, the colors are vibrant and beautiful but it does not fit at all like the size I ordered. I got a 4x and it’s like 3 sizes too small. I’m super super disappointed."
1.0,Design flaking off before it was even washed.  I returned it.
1.0,"Ugly as sin, and hard to tell from these pics. My wife hates them."
1.0,Se desprendió la piedra muy mala calidad
1.0,i am sending this back.  It is a very poor quality
1.0,"Super cheap quality,it came with this 2 dots in the plastic that look so bad and cheap.<br />I did pay 26 dollars for this,definitely regret it, this are not more than 12 worth ."
1.0,I ended up returning the dress because the waistline didn't fit right.  The dress made me look like a box.
1.0,Poor product!zero quality! Don't have quality !! It's not worth $0 cents disappointed
1.0,Upon opening this pa mage the first thing I noticed was a bad odor cannot Ming from the sweater. It is a sweet sickening smell. This stunk up my closet and bedroom. Besides the bad smell this looks nothing like the photo. It is  the size of a child and I ordered an extra large. The sleeves are nothing like the photo. There is no bell sleeves it’s just below my elbow. The package arrived days late. I cannot say anything positive about this sweater. It was money wasted as well as my time.
1.0,"the design is beautiful but it is thin, the chin that it brings is very ordinary maybe if it had brought a firmer one it would be fine"
1.0,2x fit like a Large
1.0,This is not flatter not is it high quality.
1.0,Cheap and sheer material.
1.0,My girls complain of the shirts rubbing their legs abd irritaying them.
1.0,"Ordered these for my wife, way to small, she wanted to exchange, option not available She used provided gift receipt QR, for return/credit to her account. The return was received back over 2 days ago, but has not been credited with the ""Gift Card"" Amazon says will be applied to her account within 2-3 hours. She has tried to contact seller, twice with no response. These sandals run small –don’t buy them, the seller is not responsive."
1.0,This didnt last a month. The the wrap that holds the bands together came off. The leather smelled moldy not like leather. Would not buy again or recommend.
1.0,"This scarf is soft, but not not 100% cashmere.  I work with fabrics and know how to distinguish a natural fiber from one that has synthetic fiber.<br />It's a very simple test, I tested it and it is not pure cashmere."
1.0,Nice love it but can't Wear it.
1.0,It has so many pockets. I love it.
1.0,"I received these accidentally when ordering a different product- the summer bra with removable pad. It took weeks to arrive, perhaps 6 or more. The size that arrived was XXL. Am normally about a 42C. I decided to give it a try and perhaps avoid a return.<br /><br />The fit was way off. It was way too small for a C cup yet the armhole was cut out so large that it did not cover the sides of the breast tissue. The straps were way too long and the lace wrap-over did not lend any support. All it did was irritate my skin with the hook and eye closure.<br /><br />I received a return authorization and sent it back but strangely enough, it was not accepted. In fact, it was marked ""return to sender"" and arrived back in my mailbox. Meanwhile it was refunded to me by Amazon and the seller contacted me offering to ship me the correct order. I accepted but the order I received was again, incorrect. The seller seems very customer focused but unfortunately I think they are dealing with numerous supply chain issues."
1.0,"Extremely disappointed, I was so excited to get this just in time for vacation, but when I tried it on, it’s way too long and it’s too short to wrap around twice, not happy at all!"
1.0,"Uncomfortable, doesn’t stay in place and horrible how you adjust the size"
1.0,I can't see out of these glasses
1.0,This suit is super cute but is already falling apart. I wore it once! Very disappointing
1.0,"This product was so cheaply made, I didn't even use them.  Went right into the trash. Ordering a different set from somewhere else."
1.0,There is literally no size stamped or printed on the shoes.  How do they distribute them.?Someone measured wrong.  I need a 9.  Hope they make it right.
1.0,It's sturdy but tarnished after a week of wearing. It stated it is 925; I wear 925 and it never tarnished.
1.0,You get what you pay for. This is NOT a workout set. It is extremely sheer
1.0,If it didn't cost so much to return it I would have. The fit is way off to what it says. I think that I would look better in a paper bag than this dress. Just awful!
1.0,The straps were so low. They came down so low they were in the middle of my breast.
1.0,"The watch although beautiful and I'm sure very efficient had a band that I've had trouble in the past getting used of. Therefore, I had to return it. I'm sure it's a good watch, but not for me."
1.0,Los lentes vienen por separados..si quieres estar adentro te cambias los lentes claros si estás afuera los obscuros...pero no si fitocrospoticos
1.0,I really wanted to love this item.. It was easy to put together and looked great initially. The color started to peel off the very next day of wearing it and the clasp Simply wouldn't stay on. I dropped my fitbit 3 times before I decided to take off of this band. do not buy
1.0,The picture showed a long sweater. It was really short. Totally disappointed.
1.0,I never saw where it said these were like safety glasses.  They look stupid when I wear them.
1.0,Sizing is off. Specifically the shoulder Area Despite of sizing up. I am 120Ibs got size M. color is ok. Its going back.
1.0,Ordered this for a class project for school. The material is so cheap and the minute I put the paws on the rubber bands snapped off. Returning product for sure
1.0,Not what I had expected at all honestly
1.0,Doesn’t fit together what a rip off!!!  Wish I read the reviews!  Do Not Buy!!!
1.0,"I got this to see what it was and to compare to my regular glasses. The design has a threaded plastic bolt for each eye that changes from right hand threads to left hand threads. Each eye has two lenses. The lenses move in different directions when each bolt is turned. Having threads on just one lense for an eye might be a better design for strength.<br /><br />One side was broken for me out of the box. The other side might have worked. If the plastic threads did work, it looks like pupillary distance is not adjustable."
1.0,"I purchased this item in  Large and when I opened it, I had to give it to my daughter.  I couldn't even fit anything in it."
1.0,This item is not sized with standard sizing. It was ordered a boys size 5 and fits like a 3T. I am going to have one very upset 5 year old on his birthday!
1.0,I really like these but had to return them...😦 the length was perfect however if you have a narrow foot the strap is very loose and the is no way to fix that... thought that maybe I could put something that would raise my foot up but no luck there... so disappointing
1.0,not good quality.  Disappointed in merchandise
1.0,These glasses almost make you dizzy when I look through them. Seems like the lenses are ground wrong or something. Next pair will be from the store where I can try them out.
1.0,Glasses were crooked.
1.0,Bows fell off immediately.
1.0,"this product is NOTHING like the picture, the bottoms are the same front and back as in size, and the top, there is nothing there to hold your boobs in. No elastic horrible"
1.0,"The figurine that arrived was not the one in the photo.  It was similar, but was not the one specified by the item number in the description.  It's cute, but I was looking for the one advertised, not the one I received.  I will be returning it."
1.0,These earrings wouldnt even fit a childs ear.
1.0,Terrible material. Very thin and see thru.
1.0,I did not like the way that it rides up.
1.0,No Good
1.0,This shoe was amazing at first but three months in holes developed in the mesh. I'm very disappointed!
1.0,Just look at the attached picture.
1.0,"Will never wear this. Material is not hoodie Material, nor is it breathable. Horrible quality."
1.0,The stone had wave in it .. And the metal had sharp edges.... I had ordered before the  first ring i received came to me in good condition But wrong size i ordered a size 9 it came in a size 6... I will not order again...
1.0,After today it broke
1.0,These pajamas were terribly uncomfortable and not at all soft.  My wife said it was like putting on a burlap sack.
1.0,Feather part of the piece is huge like the tail of a boeing 747 coming off your ear
1.0,This is cute for a one day at the park outfit. This is far from a bathing suit. The shorts don’t have protection and the sewing is awful. I wouldn’t do it!
1.0,Horrible. I wore these bracelets once. After removing it from my wrist the color has tarnished. I was very disappointed. Will never purchase this again.
1.0,They fall apart quickly
1.0,Posts are too large for short earring. Not a fan
1.0,Hands down the worst yoga pants i have ever bought. They slide down with every step you take therefore you have to constantly pulling them up.. I would definitely NOT recommend these to anyone.
1.0,CHEAP.. I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! WILL BE RETURNING! NOT EVEN THE RIGHT SIZE.. ITS MADE IN CHINA NO WONDER!
1.0,"I can not rate this item.  Much too small, size advertised not honored"
1.0,"These are a GREAT idea!  Glasses most anybody could use in an emergency ...but an idea that didn't work out so well, at least for me.<br />The first pair I ordered was lost in the mail.<br />The second pair arrived damaged and was returned.<br />There will be no third pair for me."
1.0,The upper part does not leave enough space even for a flat chested person. The seam is about a 1/4 in of that from the top.<br />Horrible.
1.0,Changing my review. My belt just brought on me and it’s only 3 months old
1.0,Got these for my husband for Xmas and he wore them for the first time today. Fit is great and very comfortable but within 10 minutes the zipper pocket ripped and all he had was his phone in it. Not great quality if it can’t hold the weight of a small flip phone. Unfortunately our return window has already closed so I would advise against purchasing these pants!!!?
1.0,"Doesnt fit, shirt runs really small."
1.0,Too small csnt wesr
1.0,Broke on third use. Button to release stopped working & umbrella would also not retract.
1.0,Hard to do since I ordered wine colored top. Got freaking ugly multi color garbage
1.0,I was so excited to try these out since I always get headaches in front of screens. As soon as they came I tested them with a few different websites made to emit blue light. They failed every test. I do not recommend these at all. Not worth it. Especially when there are better quality glasses out there for a lower price.
1.0,Way to large size i2d in correct!
1.0,Arrived missing a zipper and was ripped
1.0,El size corre muy pequeño y la tela muy fina
1.0,Broke after just a few hours of wearing it...
1.0,Purchased a variety 3 pack. Received one pair of three. Total scam DO NOT BUY
1.0,I ordered this product as a gift. Firstly it is not the same colour (royal blue & yellow/green) as the picture. The colour I got is a regular blue. I took measurements for my husband and looked at the size chart and choose 3x just like I do when purchasing other products. I am now stuck with a shirt that cannot wear...disappointment.
1.0,Crappy brand and fit like a bag
1.0,Faded after a month
1.0,Swim suit was way too small! The ring was pulling on my neck when I tried to put it on.
1.0,"Super thin material. You can see my nose and mouth through it. I was super excited for this because I love Alice in Wonderland and have a tattoo with ""We're All Mad Here"" It was a waste of money. Doesn't look anything like the picture. The print is so big and placed so low that you can't even see what it says when you're wearing it. Doesn't look anything like the picture of it on the women's face. Super disappointed."
1.0,Worked for about 5 wears. Now one show don't work. It charged and wouldn't turn off when unplugged but wasn't as bright as the other show either. Died out and Now wont turn on at all. And can't contact seller. Bull S**t for the price.
1.0,Watch made for kids<br />Not recommended at all
1.0,I read the reviews that said it runs smaller so I ordered a 3X! I am a size 1X 18/20. I wanted to use it for a Halloween costume so I went larger just to be safe as I could tuck the fabric if it was to big rather than risk that it would be to small. I could not zipper the dress! The belt was two inches short. The sizing on this product is way off!
1.0,"Cheaply made and looks it.  Lens separates from nose piece when sides are switched, this is not mentioned in product description.  Difficult to work with dealer.  I would give zero stars if I could."
1.0,I WILL HAVE TO FIX IT MYSELF TO MAKE IT FIT PROPERLY
1.0,"This is described as a sweater. It is not. It is a very lightweight waffle material. The pattern on the shirt is the same as pictured. If you’re looking for warmth, this is not the shirt for you. If you’re just looking for something to cover your arms, this will help."
1.0,"I bought a size 9 and it is way too big, no way I can wear this shoe. Now I have to pay for return shipping"
1.0,Ugly. Cheap looking. I ordered two sizes. Got one and the other item they sent a pleather top instead of the shorts.
1.0,Recieved wrong glasses
1.0,The shoes are terrible wide.
1.0,These lasted two months before the sole of the foot wore through. Soles on the bottom will not hold up long. Not worth the money.
1.0,The product tore at the seam the first time I tried it on<br />It was the right size but came apart
1.0,"Color fades easily and I can no longer wear with a white shirt underneath.  No matter how many time it's washed, it continues to stain the undershirt."
1.0,I never post reviews but I felt obligated to for this item. I’m usually a medium but ordered a large just to be careful. When I got this item today I thought it was a joke because this sweater would be too tiny for even a kids large. There’s no label on the sweater to check for size. Absolutely do not buy this item. I’m 160 lbs and I would need a XXXL to fit into this because it runs so small.
1.0,Very cheap material!!!
1.0,sizing is a joke.  For the price I didn't have high expectations for the quality of the fabric.  BUT the large size which was suppose to fit a 37 inch bust measured 31 inches .  You would have to be a OO or a child to fit.
1.0,Tarnished right away and diamonds fell off within a few days of wearing it.
1.0,Very disappointed<br />Wanted this for my pandora bracelet<br />It was so cheaply made👎🏾<br />I was in a cast on my hand during the time to return it so I have given it to out 9 year old granddaughter<br />So not a total waste<br />Would not order from company again
1.0,I have seen similar quality in the 99c stores
1.0,Bought this as a gift. I took it out of the bag and it broke immediately. It also looks super cheap. Do not buy!
1.0,Material is not quality like most pjama grams
1.0,Broke in 15 minutes.
1.0,This is a pretty color but cheaply constructed. Would not recommend.
1.0,Both broke within two days! Waste of money!
1.0,These are super thin. The colors are way off from what is pictured. Stong smell of formaldehyde even after washing several times. The ear strap frayed in the wash on 3 of them.
1.0,This was poorly designed or made.  Somehow we could not get his foot in the boot.  Had to return it.  Terrible product
1.0,So disappointed the shoulder strap broke the first hour I used the purse.  Other then that the purse is okay for the price.
1.0,"Arrived in a small bag and was bent in two places. As you can see, it’s crooked when you put it on and there’s no way to fix it or fix the blended parts. I’m in social services, around a lot of elderly and needed it to go into nursing homes. Waste of money."
1.0,literally watched it fall apart as my son stood on stage during his concert. It was adorable otherwise.
1.0,Arrived broken and missing 2 gems.
1.0,If I could give a zero I would.  Cheaply made looks nothing like the picture.  I do not reccomend purchasing these boots.  Highly disappointed!!!
1.0,They are so difficult to adjust you can actually hurt yourself while trying to do it. There was no way to make it fit to my Huawei watch and not look weird. Such a bad product!!!!!!
1.0,The design and the full color was nice but the size is for a 3-7 year old.
1.0,👎🏽
1.0,Looks like exactly what it cost. So cheap and fake looking.
1.0,"The sizes are very small. I usually wear a size 14, so I ordered the largest size but it was still tight. The torso is very short too, which causes the seat to ride up. Also if you have a larger chest size, the buttons won't close."
1.0,"That Batman symblornlooks nothing like then pick and is literally glued/stuck to the barbell, not able to slide it or remove it"
1.0,"Bow broke first day worn, within the first couple hours.  Cheaply made"
1.0,The present Pope of the Roman Catholic Church is Pope Francis the First.  Not Francis the XVI.  There were no other popes name Francis.  He picked his name after St Francis of Assisi.
1.0,Do not buy it. I bought it for my wife with Samsung Gear Pro. The pattern looks printed on the band. The color becomes pale and the design becomes worn after two-week use.
1.0,Hello I put first mask on at work. Ten minutes into my work day one string came off mask. Put another one on (hour into the day) another string came off!! Not a Happy buyer!!
1.0,"The bracelet is beautiful but very flimsy and broke twice. Returned, don’t waste your time."
1.0,Horrid quality
1.0,Very cheap material that felt like it would have fell apart after one wash
1.0,Some places it was too small. Other areas too bulky. I’m thin and I couldn’t even tie the sleeves all the way around. Was not flattering and seemed uneven in some places. I’m returning it.
1.0,This was the biggest joke ever! It looks like a clown suite honestly! The straps... WERE SOWN ON THE WRONG SIDE! I got played! It looks like a cheap Halloween costume honestly! Don't waste your money like I did!
1.0,You get what you pay for. Received and chain was linked.
1.0,"Very misleading representation, quality of product poor value for cost.  problem with image (# of items and colorful images), what I received did not even resemble one of those images (what I received was mostly white and not colorful at at).  Also states &#34;6 packs cotton underwear and images show six rows, with three items each.  I expected 18 items, (six packs of three) based on the picture and statement of &#34;6 packs&#34;"
1.0,"Price definitely reflects product here. No issues with the seller, just my own fault for buying junk. This thing is thin as hell and not worth the time spent anticipating its arrival."
1.0,Cheaply printed on and way too small
1.0,"Too many black rocks, not enough smooth stones. Leaves black rings around my wrists. Will not purchase again."
1.0,"Too small in the bust. By the time I got it to fit over the top comfortably, the bottom was pulled so far up that it was like wearing the highest thigh, most uncomfortable panties ever."
1.0,Wish I would have listened to the low ratings! They are almost completely see-through! They are snug....they are so stinkin' soft....they are comfy....and they are like wearing a pair of nylons for all the coverage they provide. :(
1.0,Not as it seems on the picture.  the pink its light not even close to the color on the picture.
1.0,"First, there was only 18 in the package not 20 like it says and the first two broke putting them in. They are not 16g like they say either. At best these are 22-24g. Super super thin."
1.0,Didn't fit my ears at all
1.0,No it leaks but it works ok
1.0,I was Bougth XL
1.0,Poor quality<br />This is perfect if you like to wear asa PJs
1.0,"Ran small, minimal foot bed support. Returned."
1.0,Unpatriotic and disrespectful
1.0,This band is a piece of junk. No instructions.  I found out after I wrestled with one side that the GPS antenna had to be &#34;gently&#34; pealed off the old band and placed in the new one. Had to take it off and start all over.  The band side with out the buckle doesn't fit AT ALL.  Will not go on.  Tried heating it up with hot water and still wont work.  An absolute mismatch in size. Don't waste your money on this.  Its useless.
1.0,So upset about it
1.0,Cheap looking and cheaply made
1.0,Wish I had read the reviews that said it was not shiny at all because it's true. It has no shine and actually smaller than I imagined.
1.0,What a joke!! Don’t believe the other reviews!! Super uncomfortable!! Super weird fit!! And it is not a one size fits all!!
1.0,Wast of money
1.0,"5’5, 36B, 146 pounds. Size small was so big, I was drowning in fabric."
1.0,"&#34;Polar Fleece&#34; must be a trademarked blend of tissues, morning dew and spider webs.<br />These earmuffs arrived with a tear in them nearly three inches long.<br />Seriously, the material is so thin I'll give CCenterprices LLC  the benefit of the doubt that it probably happened during shipping.<br />I would have been warmer wearing earmuffs made by capturing a few moths and knitting their wings into pirate patches then pasting them to the sides of my head with the dried tears of smoke fairies.<br />If there was a way to give this product negative stars I would.<br />If Amazon had a turd scale I would pick the one that still had steam coming off of it.<br />These are quite conceivably the most ineffective and worthless winter product I have ever purchased in my life."
1.0,I wore it once and it broke. :(
1.0,Poor quality. No returns.
1.0,These are listed as women's shoes and I ordered these in my size but I received men's shoes that are way too big.
1.0,Picture is 100% misleading. It is so tight I can't put it over my head. Think of a sky mask with only the bottom portion. Will be returning.
1.0,Loved the papillon dogs on the socks but my wife ended giving them to my 3 year old granddaughter because they were very short
1.0,Really not worth it!
1.0,The sweatshirt was cute but it smelled so horrible it went back immediately. I thought about washing it but the fabric also wasn’t very nice so decided it wasn’t worth it.
1.0,Too small and very very thin. Had to return
1.0,The Description says three necklaces for the price I only received one and I only kept it because it was a birthday gift and I did not have time to return it
1.0,Ordered 2. First one zipper was stuck. The replacement came... it had a whole in the side.<br />Both sent back. No thank you.
1.0,Looks like a womens purse.
1.0,The stitching and seam placement was horrible. The collar was stitched on backwards.
1.0,This is how my box arrived. They were supposed to be a gift.
1.0,These were NOT clear on the top which is what I need; no correction progressing down the lens to a 2.50 reader.
1.0,Queda súper pequeño
1.0,The material is like bathing suit material. So it’s shiny. Also the fit was horrible. I’m only 5’5 and the dress came to my mid shin area. I was horribly disappointed. I read the reviews looked at customer photos and I got to say I didn’t get the same cut as some of the customer pics. I don’t know. I wouldn’t chance it.
1.0,"This picture is NOT accurate. Unless that display is an infant, this necklace is T-I-N-Y. And complete crap. It arrived broken and not fixable in the package. All of the connectors were open and the entire item was in pieces. Save your money, this item isn't even worth 10 cents."
1.0,"After two uses the gold on the shirt starts rubbing off everywhere and it just turns into a ugly yellow shirt, good for one night of a Halloween costume but nothing more."
1.0,The hearts come out of the ring and it falls off
1.0,Too weak and chain too lean and weak!!
1.0,The zipper refused to work so and it smells so strongly of harsh chemicals.
1.0,These masks were terrible as far as quality.  They buckled on the sides. Thay smashed my face.  They fogged up pretty bad.  I have since bought a different brand that are great.
1.0,"The decal looks awful very cheap looking, the decal looks as if attached in reverse, I would return but not worth my time.<br />I will never wear"
1.0,"Not made for black people or people with dark skin tones, so if this is you- don't waste your money."
1.0,"When the package arrived, 2 of the hoops were already broken. A 3rd set broke when I tried to wear them today. Total junk."
1.0,Received something completely different
1.0,Runs big & no support. It was like having a dangling piece of fabric on face.
1.0,Aweful way to big and baggy not form fitting at all and way to much strong handing down never wore them
1.0,Broke less than a week after having it.
1.0,returned them

1.0,Poorly made. Not a NF look ! Disappointed and returned
1.0,They advertise XLarge but the size wouldn't fit a Baby.  Don't Order---Rip-Off!!!!  Wasted $61.00
1.0,These are not like the pictures. They sent me the wrong size and the rings were scratched up. No free shipping cost me 7.00 to ship back for a product that was damaged and u able to use do to them.
1.0,Received empty package!
1.0,Terrible little stickers with Arizona logos that were already coming off when I opened the box.
1.0,This was ridiculously too small for me . I’d suggest getting a size up
1.0,I read the reviews so shame on me. There is elastic in the back.  The color is beautiful and the buttons are very pretty. I would definitely size way down
1.0,"I thought these would be cute with a summery top, but the volume of fabric is ridiculous! Like VOLUMES of fabric, enough for 2 more pairs of pants! Unfortunately, I waited too long to return them, so they're going to a donation box."
1.0,"Absolutely beautiful! As soon as I took it out bag it was missing a rhinestone and a link was hanging. So beautiful for nothing, I couldn't wear it."
1.0,"I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas. I couldn't even give it to her because when I pulled it out of the package, it was so so tiny. Not a belly shirt even, it literally comes just under the boobs. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Bulky, heavy and not recommended for<br />extended wear.  Cute, but that's it."
1.0,it is not his real nuber his real nuber is 18 not 19
1.0,"Looks good on her,  slow shipping"
1.0,"First of all, this hat is made out of PAPER!!! Not straw, as indicated on the material type of the product description. I purchased it with intention to take it to a water park for shade, but alas I couldn't because PAPER hats cannot get wet. The seller did give me a slight ($2) discount for this false advertisement, but 17 days later and it hasn't been fixed on the material information details on the site.<br /><br />Secondly, the hat was too big for my head. I thought with the velcro back it would be easy to adjust. Unfortunately the velcro does not extend to the area where I would need it to fasten to the other side. I'm very dissatisfied with this product."
1.0,"Bought this item in silver and black to wear on special occasions, however it was too cheap looking for my taste, returned both. Will try to find fitbit band with Swarovski crystals."
1.0,Bad quality too small.
1.0,"Not the hat that I purchased. Yes the same design but a totally different hat was purchased than received. Hat is supposed to be full mesh all the way around, no mesh in front part of hat."
1.0,Very disappointed shoe wouldn't charge after a week of having them!!
1.0,"I've bought these at a well known large retailer, so I know how they should fit. The blue pair fit perfectly like mediums I have bought before. The striped grey pair fits like an extra small, the waistband width is thicker and not as elastic. THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY NOT THE SAME SIZE. I feel like the seller is just throwing whatever random size in for the 2nd pair, as other reviewers have stated that the grey pair was huge. I'm angry that I paid for 2 pairs and only got one pair of the correct size."
1.0,It had holes in the pockets
1.0,This is very cheap and low quality. Returning.
1.0,I ordered a kids size 8 for a toddler and got an adult size 8. Cute but wrong size
1.0,The chain arrived  broken and without even wearing it  turned green in 5 days ! Dont waste your money
1.0,"Material is cheap, wide and short.  Would not recommend."
1.0,There was no Greek flag on these masks - they are very cheaply made and only blue and white stripes and NO Greek flag. Very disappointed. Contacted seller and got NO response!
1.0,DRESS ISNT TRUE TO SIZE. AY SMALLER
1.0,Dont waste your money
1.0,low quality product probably will fall a part in couple of weeks
1.0,"Not sized correctly,. I went and purchased a sports bra in my normal size so I do know my size. This is supersmall."
1.0,"This shirt was so HOT,  the threading was pulling away causing the shirt to fall apart at a night club.  I've never been more embarrassed.  You can send a 2x in a completely differed short sleeve or ill send the straps of this back for a full refund."
1.0,"This handbag is very, very stiff. I have to use both hands to get my wallet into it. Also, the cellphone pocket is so large that it extends into the center of the main pocket, so I have to push it out of the way to put in my wallet. I also expected a little more space inside. My wallet and glasses case and maybe a small pill bottle, and that's it. I'm guying a bigger bag."
1.0,Fades very fast
1.0,"This skirt has a very pretty pattern, but the sizing is way off. I had a feeling the sizes were going to be off so I sized up to a large. Not even the large fit. The band was extremely tight, would be suitable for like the size of a 12-13 year old not a grown woman. I am 120-125 pounds and size large was very uncomfortable to me. I am glad I was able to return it."
1.0,Didn't like the fab to and the fit was odd
1.0,DVD's wouldn't play on any of my DVD players. they did play on my computer.
1.0,Muy pequeño..
1.0,Wouldn't close so couldn't wear them but pretty
1.0,"Literally the first time I picked the bag up to put it on with 8 pounds in it, the right shoulder strap came apart from where it attaches to the wing of the waist strap (photo 4). I was able tonuse some spare acrylic web strap and a clip to attach it to the MOLLE strap on the bottom of the bag (photo 5), but now the bag's MOLLE strap is coming away from the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />ALL STITCHING IS RIDICULOUSLY CHEAP AND INSECURE.<br /><br />Witihin 1 week of using, the ENTIRE second (main) pocket of the bag tore. The entire seam just came away from the fabric on the other side of the zipper, leaving the zipper itself attached but the entire bag hanging open, rendering the bag completely totaled. (Photos 1-3)<br /><br />DO NOT BUY FROM GONEX, they admit their products are trash they write it right on their tags: ""WE AREN'T THE BEST BUT WE ARE TRYING TO DO BETTER!"" (Photo 6)<br /><br />...Yeah well you're still failing because this was a complete waste of money. Just shut your company down if you know you sell worthless products."
1.0,"this blouse wasn't for me and i didn't like it, i already returned it and now they are charging me for it again because they are claiming they didn't receive it. Itchy material, and bad customer service"
1.0,Looks good. Fit is terrible in one lens and good in the other . Pops out way to easy with a touch.
1.0,Not a fan. Not easy to install and it squishes the whole sneaker together.
1.0,"First day of wearing the glasses, while I was walking on the beach, they fell down  from my face because one of the legs broke suddenly, it was embarrassing. Even when Amazon gave few days to return, I wasn’t able to do it cause I was already in Mexico. 😔😭 cheap some times means expensive."
1.0,"My first ring was missing the Root Chakra when it arrived. I sent it back,  the replacement Throat Chakra fell out while I was at work...I have a office job.I sent that one back also. Waiting on my refund now."
1.0,Classic example of crappy purchase. Was falling apart when it arrived. Cheap and not worth close to the amount spent. Very disappointed!
1.0,Bought three pairs and within one week an arm came off two pair. Absolute junk.
1.0,"The necklace broke right out of the package.  I can fix and really like it so will still use but come on, how cheap."
1.0,They don't work so please sent them to Chinese friends to see the time when they go to work in the morning to make new more improved watches for the USA. Thanks a lot China&#34; we appreciate your business&#34;.
1.0,magnet popped off when we first connected them
1.0,Tarnished after a month
1.0,Found these in the charms section yet after I received them I see they are for pendants which renders them useless to me. Showing the size in measurement would be helpful. Edges are not finished making them look cheap as well.
1.0,Crazy tiny would only fit a toddler.
1.0,"It did not match the picture as the sleeves were missing and the color not as deep.  When I wanted to return it, the cost was $140, as it comes from China!  I'm super disappointed,  and will just donate the dress to a charity."
1.0,Flimsy material. Used as a pajamas.
1.0,RUNS SMALL ORDERED AN EXTRA LARGE FITS LIKE A EXTRA SMALL
1.0,"They broke very quickly, very dissappointed."
1.0,Too thin to be usable.
1.0,When I bought these caps I was looking for Satin Caps that will stay on all night.These caps comes off so I wasted my money.Not Satisfied.
1.0,It was nice when put on but it kinks up. It snapped in the first week. Would not recommend this anklet
1.0,I received the 3 pack of leggings 6 days ago. 2 of the 3 pairs had a hole within one time of wearing. I've attached a photo of what the black pair looks like after 1 wear. (They also have a hole.) I purchased these in a m/l and they are plenty roomy. The waistband isn't very thick (like a highwaisted legging should have in order to stay up). I've asked to rerun/get a refund. I had high hopes when I received these in the mail because they were so cozy and soft upon first inspection/try on :-(
1.0,"WORTHLESS!!  Only acceptable for an expensive pair of children's play glasses.  Purchased at Walmart for $9.99 to use for deer hunting at 100-yds; blurry, not 40x magnification as advertised (my cheap 10x binoculars did a much better job).  I hope Walmart didn't pay much for the inventory, cuz took mine back for credit - suggest you do the same.  Please don't waste your money!<br /><br />Actually less than 1-star in my book."
1.0,These are not big enough for my mother in law. Small enough for my 9 year old
1.0,It did not look anything like the picture displayed.  It was very cheaply made.  It was a joke.
1.0,Loved the product. They fit well and stayed where I put them. But my package only included one set versus the two advertised and I didn’t realize till after the return window closed. Disappointing.
1.0,The SPF rating is false. Gave me sunburn while hiking. The material is made of flimsy cotton and thus the shape do not hold after one wash.
1.0,I have ordered lots of tops from Spiral in the past and they fit. Lately I have been having issues with the sizing though. This is the second top I got that was to small. I ordered a XXL and it seriously fit like a medium. I usually wear a L or XL in clothing but this line runs a little small so I size up.
1.0,I got these for a gift. Upsized x2 and still too small
1.0,Fits fine but everyone I’ve asked said it’s definitely purple lilac. I ordered grey to be part of a costume but decided to keep the sweater anyways. Even the inside tag says grey but it’s not! Just disappointed that I had to order a different sweater and spend more money.
1.0,"The waders were comfortable till they don’t start leaking at stockingfoot. I surf fish 1-2 a week and I wear them with Shimano Evair wader shoes. THEY STARTED TO LEAK, My feet started getting extremely cold and wet. Made them Uncomfortable, Cold and and not recommend for the value of the money"
1.0,I will be returning this as it looks cheap.
1.0,The foam liner fell off after my first use. Very poor.
1.0,"Fabric was ok, they definitely felt “homemade” and not commercially sewn. Biggest complaint is they have no room for your bum. I don’t have a huge bum and I definitely don’t have a flat bum either. It’s like they were sewn with two fronts instead of fabric that was cut for the front and for the back side."
1.0,You can totally feel the wires and they are uncomfortable to wear with shoes.
1.0,My daughter wears a 14 and my niece wears a 7.  This suit fits my niece although I bought a 14 for my daughter.  It runs way too small.  Cute but poooor fit.
1.0,Fits very tight around the neck and shoulders.  Uncomfortable.
1.0,Wore it one time and the bottom bottom tore the skirt as I was getting out of the car. Then during dinner same night I went to adjust the skirt and it rip down the side of my leg. Very poor quality material and tears very easily.
1.0,Probably would have loved it had I received it. All other jewelry came but not the bracelet! :(
1.0,The image is clearly of a knock-off.
1.0,Xtra large is pretty small...  Gave it away to a skinny daughter-in-law.
1.0,"skirt WAYYYY too long and im tall 5&#34;6ish. The top was ok and cute, but the fabric was cheap, woulda prob kept if skirt wasnt too long, but it was too cheapy fabric to keep and re-sew."
1.0,"I bought this because all the product reviews were good. It is easy to use; everything else other reviewers wrote; I didn't find to be true. It's not powerful. After two hours of trying to dry slightly wet gloves, it only got them 75% dry. The manual I got with the product says ""Sports shoes or boots aprox 20 minutes"", I don't think so. Return."
1.0,"Cheap, neck and zipper does not work right. Shirt will never be worn."
1.0,Says for kids adults. But mostly fits only adults
1.0,great shoe but too small
1.0,"This was such a disappointment. The fit was absolutely terrible - skintight, sleeves way too short. I didn’t know it was possible to get a t-shirt this wrong, but they found a way. I don’t know if the technology is off or what, because I followed the instructions exactly for taking my photos."
1.0,It was horribly made.
1.0,These shoes did not last.  They ripped on both sides and was only worn for 4 months.
1.0,Very poorly made. The flowers started to fall apart by themselves. Apparently they used old or bad glue. Total waste of $$$
1.0,These are not as advertised. There are no logos on them anywhere. Just plain black sunglasses. Very disappointed!
1.0,Worst Amazon but EVER-<br />This towel is cheap fabric and so small it could only fit a stuffed animal.<br />Awful
1.0,The sleeves are lopsided
1.0,Sending these slippers back.  Had hoped to give them to my grandson who wanted silly slippers but the two slippers didn’t match.
1.0,"It took a month to get the tool, and when it did arrive it didn't have any of the plastic tips to push the hands on with, by then I'd already bought the same item from another company and with &#34;Prime&#34; I had it within two days,  NO DEFINITELY DO NOT BUY THIS TOOL FROM GO CAROL AND SODIAL!!!"
1.0,I’m generally a large. Bought an extra large and I couldn’t get it over my shoulders! My 14 year old couldn’t even get in it! Tragic.
1.0,"Colors brighter than shown,  fabric was loose and stretchy and oversized,  Poor quality,  not true to size.  Did not look or feel like expected."
1.0,Had plenty of room to put a lot of credit card but It’s not durable.  I looks nice but not worth buying because it only lasted a couple of months and the snap broke.
1.0,Almost see through fabric. Just poor quality.
1.0,Crappy product. Just polished metal.
1.0,Mouth is too narrow and too expensive what aomg
1.0,I ordered the gray style too in the same size and fits ok but this pink one is so small it fits my 9 yr old daughter who weighs only 65 lbs.
1.0,"Already fallen apart! Very disappointed, will not buy from this company again."
1.0,Suit was too big for my 5 year old hope he can use it next year
1.0,"I bought 2 packs of the same size and same kind. Every pair is different in size. Some fit, some are too big. I will not buy these again! And I hope nobody else does. For how they are made, they should only be $5 for 10 pair. Rip off!"
1.0,Awww! I fell for the 'Plus size' on discription. It's not! Its maybe a Lg- Xl but slim in the waist. Cute top but sending this one back. 😕
1.0,Do not buy these sandals!!!! So cheap and only wearing them a few times they are trash!!!!
1.0,I received a jacket and not a hoodie. It has the eagle logo on the back and the cheast. No UNSC on the front and no logo on the arm
1.0,Don’t like this outfit at all! Got a size 1-2 years for my kid pants are like capris! Won’t be purchasing again!
1.0,You find at Walmart better quality for less.
1.0,Did not like to tight in the chest . Black is a dulll black not flattering at all looks like you are wearing a black plastic bag.
1.0,Wore them for 3 days & they fell apart!!! If there was any way I could enter 0 stars I would.
1.0,I got each of my kids a set of fluffy zip up pajamas. They arrived yesterday and I was so excited! Upon having my children try them on  (even before washing) we find that they have holes. So sad for my kids! They were so excited
1.0,The material is way too thin.<br />I was expecting better quality product and so I'm not pleased with this purchase.
1.0,This is horrible. I wish I could give it 0 stars. I bought this for a party next week. It has slit marks in 3 places. Its not like its something I can hide its in the front. Will NEVER order something from them again and I hope no else does too.
1.0,Stopped working due to water after only two weeks.
1.0,Received to left gloves and didn’t realize it until it was too late to return them🤬
1.0,There is no way there is any tummy control in these yoga pants.  The material is very thin and flimsy.  I would never wear these out of the house.  The only reason I am not returning them is that I will wear them around the house.  I purchased the size according to my measurements and the size chart and they are too big.
1.0,"It's loose, it's soft and the material doesn't pull. I love the neckline as I wear the collar more down on both shoulders and don't try to fuss with it as a cowl. (to each its own I guess). I ordered 2 sizes bigger and I love it. I ordered Red and now I'm going to order another color.<br /> The first sweater I ordered (Red), is beautiful. I ordered another one in the Orange color. I was disappointed with this one as the Orange color turned out to be wrong for me. I also returned this because the neck of this sweater is not the same as the Red one. The neck is finished off in two different gauges and the end of the collar is cast off and machine stitched (unlike the Red sweater) therefore it is puckered all the way around the cowl edge. I ordered a green one to replace the Orange one, so we'll see."
1.0,Pass on this top…it does not look anything like pic
1.0,These suck. No way were they XL
1.0,There is not a hundred in the bag
1.0,It’s super small expected something more bigger and expected it to look more decent
1.0,"The back of this charm is awful. I have many charms and this one is by far, the cheapest made. The front is super cute but it’s not what I expected."
1.0,Fake Chinese Knockoff for Coogi luxe shirts. Cheap material and missing authentic tags. Avoid fashion king! Took over three weeks to ship and I needed to get matching shirts for a gig my band had and they didn't arrive on time. Been wearing Coogi for over ten years and every other item I own has the same authentic tags that are missing on fashion kings scam fake shirts.
1.0,Don't look anything like the photo and was going to return them but my husband got sick and time slipped away.  Very large and gaudy looking.
1.0,"I didn’t realize it until after I wore them, but the coloring is off on the back legs. I have purchased about 9 pairs of pajamajeans and have loved them. But my green ones are faulty. There are whitish lines across the legs as indicated on the pictures."
1.0,The stone had fell out as I was washing the dishes.  This occurred with all 6 of the rings I purchased from them.  The stone is not &#34;set&#34; in.  It is glued in poorly.  Not for average wear!!
1.0,Wouldn't fit an adults neck
1.0,Made irregularly. One cup was bigger than the other.
1.0,Shrunk after one wash
1.0,"Very cheap, it feels easy to break when used, and is particularly fragile."
1.0,Do not like it all HOW DO I RETURN THIS ITEM ?? PLS LET ME KNOW
1.0,Very disappointed with this purse...the coin area is not good and zipper broke upon first zip!<br />Returning it
1.0,"The outfit I received was not as it was pictured. The material was cheap and it was poorly made. My biggest complaint is that the scarf/wrap didn't match the dress. They were 2 different colors schemes. The scarf was the pattern that I ordered pink, green and orange. The dress had the colors of blue, red and orange."
1.0,"I bought this from fanatics.com (who sells this shirt).  I had previously purchased one in BLUE last year and the logo and lettering was embroidered.  My girls ordered this for their dad, and it is a HUGE disappointment. This version is all IRON ON, and after one wash--and hang dry--the lettering is coming off.  This is not worth the money.  The old version, with embroidery, has held up very well."
1.0,These stones pop right off the base. Didn’t even last 1 day
1.0,Not at all what I thought they would look like or be. Kinda cheesy...
1.0,No instructions on how to change lenses plus I found out they were from China and I dont want to buy anything from China anymore.
1.0,Returned didn’t fit
1.0,"Cool my kids wanted one so ordered them all one! Unfortunately the battery dies within a week and not sure how to change it. Also, my other sons clock part completely came out of the band and he lost that. Not happy with and a waste of money. For us anyway. For you it might be different."
1.0,"Poor Quality, looks old after first  wash, the sleeves are too large."
1.0,"Like a number of these reviews suggest, this bracelet is utter garbage. My first one broke in less than a month, the replacement one broke five minutes after I put it on. I wouldn't trust any of the reviews saying this is a quality bracelet."
1.0,Go to a dollar store and get one. This is no better than one from there.
1.0,The shell was already open  order five only three inside of the shell  not shining there look like plastic  pearls
1.0,"It runs very small, the buttons do not open and it's very see through, static right out of the bag, had to return.  I normally wear a size10, 5'3"" 165lbs ordered at 12-14 and it was too small"
1.0,Earnings came flatten and broken.  Shipped in a small plastic bag . No protection for shipping.  Awful!
1.0,"This item does not work. I was so excited to get them, it fit my son perfect but did not work"
1.0,"There's a reason they are cheap, thin,tight, sweat runs past them.  Just colorful, not functional."
1.0,These are 20$ sunglasses that are 70$ due to the Nike swoosh. Bad bad bad
1.0,The top is made awkward so its big and small if you can understand that. I hate it. The underwear look like granny panties. The cover up is cute lol.. I have to cover it up!
1.0,I put this good on my keys and it lasted about a week before it fell apart. Cute but not worth the money.
1.0,The zipper doesn’t connect at the bottom correctly. I loved the material…but I couldn’t or wouldn’t fight the zipper!
1.0,I hated it.Not easy to read or set time or date.<br />I sent it back!
1.0,"I bought these thinking they would be like Zutano but cheaper. Well, they were cheaper but as we’ve learned with baby stuff... you get what you pay for. I returned these, never even put them on my son because they were scratchy and thin"
1.0,Muy corrientes me duraron una semana sele despegó la suela los tuve que tirar ala basura
1.0,They look super cute but I got super allergic after wearing them for half a day. Not worth the price maybe if they were only 8$. Definitely not gold dipped.
1.0,"It's a shame, i liked this non-fancy little watch but about a week after owning it one of the buttons came off. I didn't expect a Casio to be this delicate.<br />I still like Casio in general but i don't recommend this watch."
1.0,Much smaller than expected! Disappointed
1.0,They are super cute but they have already broke my daughter put them on for the first time and they are broken.  So cute but not worth spending money on if they are just gonna break.
1.0,These shorts are a joke. It says it stretches and by no means do they stretch and I bought an xl and it wouldn't go up my upper thighs. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this crappy product. For the price you're better off buying name brand on clearance.
1.0,White is NOT white at all!!!!
1.0,"These are so cute, but they are so so so so small.  I mean I love the size, but they don't fit large ear lobes.  Be cautious.  Also I believe the gauge of the post is thicker than usual, so I had a hard time getting them in my ear as well."
1.0,"The measurements said it would fit. I was so excited to have a cute summer dress. Basically, if you have any sort of curves, torso, or are above 5' 2&#34; this dress will not fit. I have no idea who designed it, but the shoulder straps were too long, the torso was too short, and the skirt was too full. Everything was the wrong dimension on this dress. Seriously. I cannot recommend it."
1.0,Cheap flimsy material; very see thru and the cut of the top is just awful.
1.0,"Ended up sending this back because it wasn't just a little too small, it was way too small."
1.0,This is not for an adult. Very cheaply made for the price. Would expect this to be $10 less for the quality.
1.0,Doesn't match samsung Galaxy Active smartwatch Rose Gold. More like gold.
1.0,The watch runs fine during the day but the automatic winding doesn't generate enough juice to keep it running when you're sleeping. I wake up in the morning and the time is more than THREE HOURS slow. I bought this because I liked the styling but it turns out to be Chinese JUNK.
1.0,waist of money
1.0,"Does not look anything like this, it is a very miniature scale in a very rose colored metal as well.  Was not happy with this item at all."
1.0,Watch came damaged and had to get a refund. Sounded like good idea too
1.0,"Sucks, it broke in the way to me, easy to thin and delicate."
1.0,My son has had these approximately 62 days. He does not where these everyday and they have literally fallen apart. I’m a single mom who can’t afford to just replace shoes every 2 months. I’m soo upset over the poor quality
1.0,I have bought Relipop dresses in the past and loved them. I wear a size large in the other dresses from them and decided to size up to an x-large. I couldn’t even get this dress on.
1.0,embarrassingly low and bad quality<br />very disappointed<br />i was hoping for a bit better..i mean how hard can it be to get it looking a BIT better!
1.0,pin popped out of the band twice and today the dam thing stopped I need shipping instuctions
1.0,speedy delivery but will be returning. I have writing all over one end of this scarf. That isn’t in pictures you advertise.
1.0,"These socks have numbers on their backs, like athletic socks or something. Very unattractive and unnecessary. They were not shown in the product description or I would never have bought them. They are not cute! They are ugly!"
1.0,Did not come with a new battery so doesn’t work
1.0,"Material is much cheaper than expected. Under-dress looks cream in the picture but is actually white,  which is misleading. Someone stepped on my dress as I was walking and although there wasn't much tension, instantly the corset part snapped. Disappointed in the quality of this item."
1.0,It is very sheer! The light hits it and you can see straight through it.
1.0,"Ordered this as a sort of gag anyway because of the unicorns but the coverup I got was rainbow tie-dye with no unicorns on it. The fabric picture (with unicorns and ""I Believe"" on it) was actually only used on the edging not the main body of the garment."
1.0,"Ripped in few days, cheap material."
1.0,Terrible!! Plasticy bubblegum quality junk! Very disappointed.
1.0,It never worked on ear. I want refund . its junk.
1.0,Rusted frame
1.0,"I was not pleased with this skirt. It didn't look at all like the skirt in the advertised photo, it didn't have any spandex (5%) which made the fit extra tight. I didn't return it bcuz I was too cheap to pay the return costs so will sell it instead."
1.0,Wrong lenses. I ordered Logan’s and got Frazier’s and the color was red not black. Very disappointed
1.0,"A waste of money! so thin and floppy it won't hold its shape, plus it has creases in it from laying flat."
1.0,"I ordered this in hopes that it would be great. Alas, on the first (and only) journey, the rickety handle would not de-telescope. As well, the wheels are such that they stick and skip even on a smooth surface and finally, I missed my return window on this piece of garbage by a day. I travel 50% for work so I can honestly tell you about a function travel item. Sadly, this isn't it. I wouldn't waste the money."
1.0,"These appear cheaply made and ill-fitting.  Not the quality that I've had with Guess products in the past.  One of my favorite eye glasses frames were Guess brand and they lasted for years and were cute, light-weight and well made.  Not words I'd use to describe these."
1.0,"I didn't like how sheer the dress was. Super cheap material and the wrinkles are impossible to get out. Beautiful dress, and flattering. I didn't like the material. rougher than it looks."
1.0,"It looks great BUT the size is too too small , it is more for a 5 -years old girl AND NOT FOR 9-10 YEARS OLD GIRL !!!!! My other, little daughter tried it on, she is 6 years old - and it was also for her too small!!!<br />This is a shame to sale that for a bigger girl!!<br />Thank you, good joke .-("
1.0,This skirt is TINY! Ended up giving it to my 5 year old daughter for dress up and it fit her perfectly.
1.0,I was hoping this would be the heavy weight Telnyashka that I bought in Russia that the military actually wears .It is not .<br />It is very thin -a light weight cotton.<br />I hope they get the real thing instead of a product made for export for tourists !!!! ????.<br /><br />The real product - military Telnyashkas are amazing in the winter -keeps you warmer than UnderArmour or Helly Hansen<br /><br />a summer Telnyashka is a sleeveless muscle shirt
1.0,It Broke after 3 weeks using it
1.0,Very small you can't even see the eagle
1.0,"These glasses change the bright, glaring headlights from bright white to yellow -  the headlights are still bright and glaring, just not while.  Big deal."
1.0,"I’ve bought two of these.  After about 20 uses, the little end falls off the buckle pin, which means the buckle will no longer stay closed.  I thought it was a fluke at first, but it happened both times."
1.0,Great for polyester. Returning due to poor quality. Reminds me of 1970s leisure suit.  Purchased in red for a fun Christmas party look.  Not happy with the material at all. Gold buttons.
1.0,Material is very rough and easy to wrinkle. It also fit smaller than expected.
1.0,I knew it was a cheap watch but holy crap; its a POS.  It literally rattles as you move notifying everyone that you are wearing a cheap POS.
1.0,It broke when my daughter opened the package.
1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS SWEATER! It is a complete ripoff. Cheap material and small. Not “womens” size- it fit my 4 year old.
1.0,When they arrived and I unscrewed the ear ring they was some kind of dead bug in it!!!!!
1.0,"While these gloves are technically waterproof, in the sense that no water reached the lining or my hands, the warmth of the glove was seriously compromised when the outside layer got wet, as the exterior is not waterproof, but water resistant only. Several hours after getting wet, the outside of the glove has not dried (despite being inside a heated house), and the inside is noticeably colder than the still dry glove. My conclusion is that these gloves cannot get wet and still keep my hands warm."
1.0,"I wear between a small and medium, usually more on the medium side unless I really want a slim look. Size was a bit large in medium. Good if wearing a hoodie underneath.<br />Quality was very un impressive, material was typical wind breaker very thin. Interior print was.. Interesting. Interior pocket threads wear open rendering pocket useless. Returned"
1.0,"I bought for my Fitbit HR, and I cannot get the band to stay on. The pins seem weak? The band will attach and then fall off with the slightest nudge. I have been able to put other bands on and have tried with this one several times, so I don't think it is human error."
1.0,Very poorly made. I think Zippers should begin and end within the purses top part  not having over 3 inches of the tail end of the zipper hang outside of the purse.
1.0,"Cheap fabric, snagged VERY easily.<br />Returning"
1.0,Fell apart second time I was putting it on my glasses
1.0,They are comfortable but they stain really easy so if you don't want too get them stain don't walk in them
1.0,"Returned...the ones I received were clearly used.  There was grass stuck in the wheels and they weren't even in a box,"
1.0,"i am so disappointed in these boots.  The toe seam is sewn sideways on one of the boots, i started a return request and had to go out of town so i missed the return date.  I thought it could be a fluke and ordered another pair. SAME issue!  so now i am stuck with two pair of boots that are not wearable, and i can not return. $80 down the drain!"
1.0,its broken i need a replacement.
1.0,Fits loose in the bust area and snug in the hips area. Not a good fit.
1.0,Came used/Dirty
1.0,"The blue is really more of a robin egg blue rather than a pale aqua as shown, so i will never wear it. Also, the shoulders puff up at the seam-80's style which look goofy."
1.0,"As a Gemologist, I bought this just to see if it was real... didn't have my hopes high but had the money to spare and was bored.<br /><br />Did some testing on it... here's what I found.<br /><br />Refractive index came up  as 1.54 and tested as single refractive with no pleochroism. I'll run some more tests when I can get back into my lab and check specific gravity.<br /><br />Topaz tests in the 1.60 to 1.64 range, is double refractive and shows pleochroism. Also, a big red flag, synthetic topaz is quite rare due to the stone being widely available, therefore expensive.<br /><br />All the tests come out to this very likely being glass, albeit a pretty piece with excellent facets. I'll give the artistry a pass and I would have bought it just for that, there was no need for deceit.<br /><br />Seriously though. You're busted by a gemologist. Try some truth in advertisement.  Four stars for quality of the cuts, minus five for lying about it.<br /><br />I bought two of these around the same time from this company, the other soon to arrive. I'll test that one as well, but after what I've seen here, I'm expecting similar results."
1.0,ONLY SINGLE SIDED PRINT VERY CHEEP CHINESE
1.0,"Face fell out within 24 hours. I was in the subway, so of course I never found it. I wish I were kidding."
1.0,This is so incredibly racist and exploitative that I don’t know where to start. If you wouldn’t dress up as a “sexy blackface mammy” don’t dress up as this. You’ll thank me later.
1.0,"Although I had read the other reviews about the poor quality and small sizing, I still couldn't resist buying them and so regret the decision.  There are many fashion jewellery rings in the market, but the quality of these are amazingly poor.  Within the 2nd time of wearing them, there was discolouration and chipping.<br /><br />The sizing is also very small.  I have slim fingers and even I had difficulty wearing them.  Wished the seller listed the ring size.<br /><br />Anyways, I have now threw all the rings away.  They were an eyesore in my jewelry box and I'm happier not to see them...."
1.0,Horrible! It is huge. I tried it on and it looks like a worker overall.  Shiny material. It is horrible. I really will try send it back and get my money back.  There is nothing sexy about it. The price need to be adjusted for this
1.0,Cheaply made! I’m 5’8 not long enough. It looks NOTHING like the picture. I’ve purchase other dresses like this and they were way better. Save yourself the headache and buy something else. Waste of money and it took forever to come in the mail.
1.0,"I'm so disappointed with this company. I've purchased several items from them over the years and each item has been worse quality than before. This time, the pants were a cheap, thin material that was see through and rough against the skin. It was like the cheapest fabric you could buy at a fabric store. The crotch was too short, giving me a permanent wedge and the ankle cuffs were too loose and slipped down to my mid foot with every step.<br />I wouldn't pay more than $15 for something like these at Walmart. And yet, I spent $16 on shipping, $6 on return shipping, and then a $7 restocking fee. $29 to try on a pair of unwearable pants? That's dispicable, Lotustraders. I'm finally giving up on this company."
1.0,"Didn't work for me, I don't believe they are polorized, but not worth the time and money to return."
1.0,Very cute but cheap and ripped
1.0,only printed on one side
1.0,"Sent these back immediately.  Not dark enough, didn't keep the glare out enough (I wear contacts so they have to be dark) and didn't fit properly."
1.0,Too thick .
1.0,"Would love these if they was the material shown in the picture . Order a burgandy and came more purple . Order a gold and it came peach . The material looks very nice in picture , but is just tee shirt material. No multi colored material . They are very dull material. Wanted to returned but cost more to send back . Not worth returning . But would love if the material is described in the picture."
1.0,Pom Pom is half the size in real life comparing to the picture!  Not nearly as cute.
1.0,I have worn this brand for years but this purchase a disappointment. Socks run large I wear a 7m and material very thin and cheap. Not what I hoped for
1.0,I received a very nice peice of hematite not magnetite. Red streak test confirmed.
1.0,"The snaps are nice, but after washing the fabric is not soft anymore. There is major pilling going on. Very disappointed!"
1.0,I am not leaving a message here because i do not want to. I gave you one star because you made me.
1.0,"Extremely poor quality material, so much so that it’s see-through. Color is also not as pictured. I had to return."
1.0,FYI Product received was “Prime Neatsfoot Oil Compound” not the 100% Oil shown.
1.0,Very bad quality product and not recommended  to buy. I will be returning this product. mirror plates coming out.

1.0,i washed it once and the pockets fell apart it was a waste of money
1.0,My shirt came to me with stain on it.
1.0,"I was surprised at how poorly made these gloves were. I read the reviews and spent considerable time looking for mittens for my toddler.<br /><br />I was not only disappointed by the packaging but that they were already unraveling before any use.<br /><br />Normally I would return a product like this but with winter right around the corner, I just wanted some thing on hand for her.<br /><br />Would not recommend. Will not buy from again. Waste of money. Overpriced."
1.0,"Way to small I returned, the return process was painless at least."
1.0,"Very thin and short in length, even for a child size. Very disappointed"
1.0,The WORST...........
1.0,Buy at your own risk. The product fit is definitely smaller than US/EU but they are exactly as pictured.
1.0,"Tarnished in 2 months, shame because I loved the style"
1.0,"What you read about this product is:  Note:Suggest hand wash and Hang dry this cute sweater for women. THIS IS A LIE, I did it and now the sweater  is all frayed and looks old.  When you check the instructions that come inside it says Dry clean… So disappointed. I just waste my money"
1.0,Cheapest possible T-shirt material tight in the arms and much shorter than shown here do not buy
1.0,Size does not match description.
1.0,"Way Too Small, and paper-thin material that feels fragile and cheaply made.  Also,  this shipment got tied up in customs and was a full week late arriving, or more."
1.0,I wash my tshirts first time and the decal got yellowish spots started appearing on it now is a work shirt. Very disappointed 😞
1.0,Never Received the Jacket. Could be the best or Worst. I'll never know.
1.0,The color . The fit was horrible
1.0,fall off
1.0,Tiny...more like child size
1.0,Got a hole the first time I put it on and I am only a size 16. Terrible quality. I am getting my money back.
1.0,Beads fall off easily
1.0,3 out of 6 have already broken and my 11 year old daughter has only had them 4 days. Boo. Very cheaply made.
1.0,"after 3days of wearing it, it broke."
1.0,"We bought a few of these for our luggage, and initially were very happy because they are well made & durable.  The problem is that the writing smudges and fades overtime. It’s as though the plastic is slowly absorbing & spreading the ink,  until it gets to the point where the writing is illegible.  We’ve tried fine tip permanent markers and ball point pen’s, and had the same result with both.  The tags did work fine for the first 6 to 9 months, but after that it was impossible to clearly make out the writing."
1.0,These are made in China. Ugh
1.0,I didn’t like these earrings at all for one they is to little for 7.99 i was expected something bigger than these this my second time bad experiences on some earrings never again will i order earrings from you guys
1.0,The front straps were not wide enough for my feet. I really loved those shoes but I was very disappointed. I even got it a half size bigger so it would be wider but it was no use.
1.0,Slips down on hips when it was tied and the sequins make it hard to tie without destroying the pieces- and I definitely have hips!
1.0,"I ordered the Sage color and it does not look anything like the picture, not even close.  It's more of a light brown.  Very disappointed."
1.0,"Upon opening these gloves, the smell is bothersome and unpleasant, telling me that the quality of these gloves are not great. The stitching was not great, especially on the fingers."
1.0,"I ordered an extra large and the label said xl but trust me, it was a small."
1.0,MADE VERY SMALL
1.0,I should have read more reviews. I'm a 36D and the large was too tight and an odd fit.
1.0,"Very poor quality, lens fell out after about 3 uses, would not recommend unless you are looking for cheap throw away sunglasses."
1.0,It was super cheap. One came shorter than the other. Only one tie was provided and there's no way to tie it through. It was basically a big beer cozy
1.0,"Material sucks, not off the shoulder as in photo and colors not the same as photo"
1.0,IT DOES NOT FIT ANY APPLE WATCH AND IS SMALL AROUND THE TOP EDGES CAUSING NO REAL LATCH. AND THEY LOOK USED TERRIBLE
1.0,Nothing like the image advertised.
1.0,"Does not have room for the girls. Maybe if your flat chested, but I’m not and it was hard to wear."
1.0,The arrow has flaws and is not aligned with the tail.
1.0,"I've ordered the boots twice, and each time I received the wrong color:-(. The picture shown online is not what I received. I am so disappointed because I love the style of the boot"
1.0,I never got the peanut butter and the jelly didn’t really look like jelly
1.0,The handles were twisted on the bag
1.0,These shirts run so small. I bought them for my 9 year old daughter who normally wears either M (8/10) or L (10/12). Normally the larges fit her loose and when she got the size 10 for Christmas they didn’t fit her. So I returned it and re-bought the size 12 and they’re still too small. I’m very dissatisfied with this product but she wanted them so bad I’m letting her wear the shirts tight. Otherwise she won’t have the one thing she really wanted for Christmas. I don’t recommend this product unless you can size up.
1.0,"When my boots finally arrived I was so disappointed. They looked so different then the pictures shown. Too bad, could have been super cute"
1.0,Poorly designed
1.0,"The side seam already ripped off only after a few days wearing. Style is cute, but thumb down for the quality. Not worth the price."
1.0,And it only cost a buck more than buying a brand new watch (which comes with a new band)!
1.0,"This is a KNOCK OFF.  I ordered this shirt in gray.  And, the top panel was gray cotton weave - fine.  The bottom panel was made of some sort of polyester (like a cheap nightie) and had black/navy stripes! It looked like it had been shoddily tossed together - not even made of the same fabrics let alone the same color.  Order this shirt from the REAL vendor. RETURNING."
1.0,"Product arrived with packaging opened and in exceptionally poor shape.  Clearly a used product.  Shame on the vendor and Amazon for this.<br />The tongue itself is crap, cheap rubber, but didn't expect anything more.  Mostly disappointed in the vendor with this one."
1.0,Very unhappy tiny on me and too late to return
1.0,Horrible choice. Didn’t come with anything in the picture for a costume. Just a generic cloak
1.0,It was slightly larger than advertised. I sent it back.
1.0,My womens &#34;one size fits all&#34; fits my child who is 2 perfect. I wish it did the same for me because I was looking forward to this shirt. I'm typically a size 6 and it was like slipping a sock over my head.
1.0,A waste of time.
1.0,Got the right size and all just way to thin. Barley flare so they fall out while sleeping.
1.0,"Way too small, it says 6XL. I gave it to my sister in law  who is a size 5...it barely fit."
1.0,Not as expected. Did not fit right and the material is a horrible cotton.
1.0,Attractive design very poorly engineered. DO NOT BUY.
1.0,To confusing
1.0,Runs really big. Not very good quality.
1.0,I bought these for my husband for Christmas. Unpackaged 12/25/2017 and the have already broken on the side. Very disappointed.
1.0,In less than 5 hours just around the house on Christmas my daughters strap broke. Not durable and gets dirty and easy
1.0,"They band looks nice, no issues with it functionally(yet) but it does fit very loosely and makes clicking noises due to poor connection design."
1.0,Looks cheap and runs small
1.0,Too smalll and had to pay for return
1.0,Three of the tassels had fallen off by the time I tried them on for the first time.
1.0,This is what they look like after wearing once. Nothing else needs to be said.<br />Don’t waste your money.
1.0,Terrible one of the lenses was broken
1.0,No lo he recivido
1.0,"Hated it, the necklace was made out of cheap plastic and a rope..."
1.0,The collar has some weird yellow irregular stitching. There’s no way of fixing the stitching.
1.0,"Slightly small, higher heel than expected"
1.0,It broke very easily
1.0,The mask has poor quality. Can't even see and read the word merry xmas and that's what's important. Will not recommend to buy these
1.0,Bristle brushes came deformed
1.0,"Sizing is children sized! incredibly small, I gave it to my daughter. See through fabric. Must be used with a cami underneath."
1.0,"It stopped working the next day, and the charger it came with didn't fit right"
1.0,Arrived with a broken clasp
1.0,I wear costume jewelry all the time but these changes after the first wear and it's the first time earrings actually make my piercing feel sore. But they're cute :)
1.0,These fell  apart within two weeks. They came with two burn spots in the foot bed and glue was coming through I tried to wipe that as good as I could with alcohol because they were so cute and soft. But within two weeks of wearing the sides had begun to tear away from the sole of the shoe . Don’t waste your time or money on these .
1.0,"I got these for my husband to use at his place of work.  I waited a very long time to get these, then we disappointed to see how cheaply they are made.  I don't see these lasting him through these troubling times.....I'm sorry to say but just wanted to be very honest. I had to wait far too long, customer service was no help in tracking the package"
1.0,I thought the mask was made of rhinestones but it's a screenprint of the image.
1.0,Was not expecting the best quality for the price but I was very disappointed in what showed up had to go last minute and buy something in person because I refuse to give this to my daughter
1.0,I buy a lot of dresses on line and this was by far the worst. The fit was terrible and the over all quality of the dress and design and material was bad. Like a kid did it as a project in Sewing 101.
1.0,"all the sizing was really weird the base fit perfectly then the blue part didn’t at all, very flimsy material, no instructions on how to put on, very cheap. I was putting on my costume just to try on and the vision broke. I would buy a size down for sure! Not to mention how half of the pieces were messed up"
1.0,I don't like the cheap quality of this top and it fits horrible
1.0,It doesn't work. My hair slips and doesn't stay in the tool. It did come with three but they are non usable.
1.0,"The size chart is not accurate. Definitely runs a smidge smaller....  I bought a large originally and it was way to tight up top, so I sized up one to an XL and ordered again, NOPE.. Still wasn't fitting right in the chest/arm area it was small across the chest but wear the V neck is was tight in the armpit area...  Decided I was done, the Large dress flowed out great if it weren't for the chest being extra small... I normally wear a large in dresses or a US size 12, i'm 5'2.  The dress is a beautiful color and the material is good, but unfortunately the dress was too small across the chest area (My girls are not large at all) ."
1.0,I thought the case would be linen like material. But it is cheap polyester
1.0,"This one is tight at the bottom, Lose at the top. No proportionate."
1.0,"Looks cute like picture, but is made of the worst material. It is stiff even after washing. You can't wear it without layers as fabric will definitely be irritating skin"
1.0,"Poor quality, runs very small.  The return center said the company would email me a return label but they only sent and authorization slip.  I can't find any address or phone number for this company!!!!"
1.0,I usually wear a Medium but this dress run very small.
1.0,It was not a compression shirt. It was too thin more of a fit dry shirt
1.0,"Received this product around the 20th of June, broke in the last week of August with normal use (just wearing it to the office). For nearly $40 I expect it to last longer than 2 months but the &#34;leather&#34; is more like cardboard. I knew it wouldn't be great but I hoped for better. I would stick to the silicone bands when buying off brand."
1.0,fake looking and broke right away
1.0,This jacket was so thin I could put it into my evening purse it was thin and poorly made
1.0,No woman of Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority Incorporated will ever wear this.
1.0,"Way too small, even when I ordered the largest size possible it's then too short, ripped when I tried pulling it above my chest :("
1.0,The bracelet arrived tarnished in two spots. Very noticeable.
1.0,Ordered this in navy first and then the black. The black is a totally different material and doesn’t even compare. It’s flimsy and flat. Don’t order.
1.0,"I wanted to love these for my son. They are easy to get on and off and looked sturdy. We live in the snow belt region so I wanted something he could wear to school on those days he does not need a huge snow boot. After what I would say is completely normal wear of just a month or so, they are totally ripped on both sides with the fronts tearing away from the sides of the shoes. I would not recommend if you have an active child who loves to play. Theses are not going to hold up for you. I would try something else."
1.0,did not fit.  Had to return this
1.0,"The top I was sent was very poorly made.  The V neck was significantly off-center, the stitching was poor, and the cross over was sewn crooked.  the material is thin and clingly, and the cut was not flattering"
1.0,"The person on the picture must be extremely tiny.  This is a great gift for children,  but will not properly fit any average adult. The arms were very short on my teen; if you attempt to buy order big."
1.0,Pic looked cool of course. Material cheap and WAY too small!
1.0,"I thought this item was supposed to be white , it is cream , i thought it was to be cotton , its rayon, not happy at all."
1.0,"WATCH BROKE ON THE 31ST DAY SO I CANNOT RETURN IT, PARTS OF THE FACE FELL OFF"
1.0,Item broke in one day.
1.0,Poorly made cheap material
1.0,Too Small glove do not fit
1.0,Received defective set of earnings. (See picture)  I cannot find the hole from the back of my ear to put the other earring on.  They were very inexpensive but I did expect to receive a functional product. It's not even worth the time to send it back.
1.0,"I am so sad , because this hat it’s exactly what I was looking for but it was packaged horrendously all folded in that small bag next to it so the visor was ruined with the folding . There’s no way I can straighten it"
1.0,Given cost didn’t expect much. But this was disappointing.
1.0,"Mi evaluación es de 1 estrella ⭐️ porque es la tercera vez que los ordeno porque amo las mariposas 🦋 y esta última, hoy, ahora no vienen bien protegidos la envoltura de los tapabocas 😷, tengo dudas de usarlos 😔., que sucedió a diferencia de las 2 veces anteriores, mi ultima compra de este producto fue en enero//2022."
1.0,They seem very wide and run large. Not what I was hoping for. I .ended up donating them to charity
1.0,Very cheap material. Second I took out of package I put it back in. Sorry but my opinion.
1.0,"I was anxious to get these two shirts to keep warm in our over-air conditioned office.  However, taking them out of the package, I immediately saw that the red shirt color had bled all over the white.  Looked horrible!  Immediately sent them back for refund.  Also, the red was not dark or wine colored at all, but a medium color red."
1.0,The quality has of this blouse was substandard to say the least. It literally disintegrated as attempted to put it on. No one should buy this blouse or you will be disappointed as I was.
1.0,I was expecting a large bag. It was more medium small and stiff. Shoulder strap short. The burgundy color was pretty but I returned.
1.0,Did not realize they were clip on too tight on lobe anyway to wear .
1.0,Poor quality. Couldn’t choose color upon checkout. Not worth the price
1.0,"I received the above dress. I was greatly disappointed because it was not only to large with the V neck, but also much to short to wear. I then returned the item as directed and have been waiting for nearly a month for my refund. I will not be purchasing from this company again."
1.0,"The size is quite adequate.  However,  the stitching around the edges is poor and puckers the entire edge.  The material is very thin.  The colors are not as expected.  The beige is rather dark and the black spots look more brown than black.  Wpuld not purchase again or recommend.  Donated scarf to Goodwill."
1.0,The shirt just barely covers your underboob upon exhale.
1.0,They slip off the glasses...ironic.
1.0,No good.
1.0,Half the items are missing.
1.0,"Fit and color are conpletely different than the description. They take forever to ship, and communication with the seller is hilariously frustrating. Would not reccomend to anyone for any reason."
1.0,Didn't fit my watch at all
1.0,Never received the shoes. Got damaged.
1.0,"Says 2t-3t but closer to 3t. Much longer and bigger than expected. The dress is not nearly all fluffy as expected either. Also, I got the blue for a Dorothy costume for my toddler and was shocked to see how dark the blue was when it arrived. It’s like a dark denim blue."
1.0,"To small , it’s not what I specked"
1.0,"The size was actually a small size.  My petite wife liked the shirt (she is 5' 1"" and weighs 100 pounds,  fits her perfectly.  If you wear medium, get X-Large"
1.0,"I’m 5ft2 and 110lbs. These pants were HUGE on me. The length was almost perfect, but the pants were baggy and there was at least 3 extra inches at the waist."
1.0,"I would never buy this item again. very small hair bands. Not even usable for adults.  Terrible trickery in the photo!  You got me this time,,, not again."
1.0,Fits too smal. I am a size 9 fit too small.. I had my daughter size 7 try them and it was too small for her. Seller doesn't give you paid postage either to return.
1.0,Zipper was broken cost too much to have it fixed
1.0,Comes folded into fourths and the creases are impossible to get out.
1.0,"No matter what size I got they were too tight.  I’m 5’6 135, got s, m, l, they were all super tight! So frustrating!"
1.0,The sleeves are uncomfortable with all those strings
1.0,This product isn't what it states...kid can't even wear them and they are as thin as a sheet of paper. Sorry Amazon this is a very bad product.
1.0,Poor  fit and quality - uncomfortable
1.0,Different style was delivered
1.0,Cheap looking .
1.0,"I loved how this purse looked, but the liner is cheap and started coming out soon after I began using it. After just four months of use, I've had to throw it away and buy something else."
1.0,Worthlessly thin. I walked around our backyard for two minutes and had one rip and both get full of holes. Tie a plastic grocery sack around your foot and it will be more durable than these.  I regret spending $17 on this product.
1.0,"1000% counterfeit! while these socks are as thick and made just like Wigwam super 60 they are NOT authentic and they are NOT 83% Cotton. They are NO WAY near as soft as real Wigwam super 60 socks!! You want real wigwam socks buy them directly from the Wigwam website or from an authorized retailer.. You will not get real socks here on amazon, and they are being sold at the same price as the real ones! Buy a pack from an authorized online retailer and compare them yourself if you have any doubts about what I'm saying."
1.0,"The first day I wore it, the opal fell out. I'm so disappointed, it looked so pretty on my finger."
1.0,ZERO support. Went on the small side for me a medium. They are so loose and so unsupportive. Okay as a little shirt under something but other than that forget it.
1.0,It fell apart within the first week
1.0,Got an Xlarge it still would not fit.  I wear a medium. This is way small. I really think is children size.
1.0,Skirt is too small I never order it again. I wish I had sent it back for a refund. No stars
1.0,They were great for about two months but then they seemed to scratch way easier than the original Oakley lenses. I’ve had them for four months and now I need new ones. For the price I would like to have better scratch resistance.
1.0,"i am awaiting for a replacement. too small,"
1.0,I am sure other people are satisfied with these blankets but here is why i put a 1 star. Carters use to make blankets whith a big tag with washing instructions on the blanket. My son who has a sensory disorder loves to rub his thumb and finger on the tag and plays with the tag to soothe himself to sleep hes 2.5. I have always just bought carters brand because i know they have this tag. I tried carters just one you for walmart. And simple for amazon and they have a small thin tag. So I purchased this set. It arrived after 5 days and I had prime 2 day. It also had 3 tags 1 being small and 2 others under it. I was so disappointed that this changed. Now I am on a hunt for the recieving blankets with tags silk. I tired tag blankets and he dont like them have to be a recieving blanket.
1.0,"Very cheap quality. You would need a slip for und Ernesto. Also, the blue on the top half didn’t match the blue on the bottom half of the dress. Sent it back."
1.0,"The top was received with a hole or tear in it.  Highly disappointed as it was bought as a present for our vacation this weekend.  It's a shame, because it was her first choice and she loved the colors and design."
1.0,They were very little and I ended up not being able to use them!
1.0,2 of the 3 were definitely worn and smelled like someone did their workout in them before returning them.
1.0,"This dress came with rips in it, also runs very small!"
1.0,"This thing runs large, short, and wide. It makes me look like I'm wearing a potato sack."
1.0,Beautiful but you would need to be partically flat chested to wear this thing.
1.0,The cut and fabric were not at all as depicted. Feels like a soccer jersey
1.0,Does not work!!!
1.0,These are NOT PREMIUM COTTON.  They aren't cotton at all but 100% polyester microfiber.  What misrepresentation.  Gotta read the small print with these folks. Amazon should not allow vendors to do this.
1.0,Very disappointed. Dress is nit fitted. Collar is straight across and not low. Sleeves are huge and not as pictured. Took over 3 weeks to receive.  My event is this weekend and now have nothing to wear as it is too late to find something else  Also have to return everything I bought to go with this dress.
1.0,"what I received was a 41 ...too small... I have returned the shoe . I am awaiting a refund or the correct size........the shoe looked good ,but this process has taken way too long!!!"
1.0,Looked awful on...like a sack of potatoes with a belt.  Returned.  Beautiful color though.
1.0,Poor quality. They are light because they feel like they are made of styrofoam.
1.0,Not as cute on as they look on pic
1.0,"Worse case ever, used one day and nobody could hear me thru the case. Charger cords and headphones do not fit! Very disappointed"
1.0,"So, I got this leather band for free when I bought a metal loop band. It was as reliable as the cost. A tiny screw in the bracket that attaches to the watch came loose and even after screwing it back in, it continued to back out and fall off. I threw it away. I'm glad I didn't pay."
1.0,The second time I used this product it broke.
1.0,"These are suppose to be an XL in adults, these leggings are n XL in a small child's leggins!"
1.0,The color of the gold is shimmery and metallic gold it is not just a golden straw hat.
1.0,This skirt is constructed in what looks like a rush. Instead of using a yellow thread that would match their is white thread all over the skirt. It has no shape and is made out of a silky material. The bow hangs limply from the skirt and is not at all like it was depicted in the picture. Will be sending it back tomorrow.
1.0,"The material is just horrible. It feels & looks like bathing suit fabric. Also the red looks more bright tomato instead of a rich blue base. I immediately returned it, still waiting on my refund which I’ve yet to receive."
1.0,"This looks so sharp in the ad, but when it arrived I found it to be very cheap looking and made of some very low-quality vinyl or plastic. It isn't the color advertised and looks like something found in a 99cent store. It doesn't hug the watch face as it appears to do in the ad, in fact the silver section keeps popping up over the FitBit face and scratches the corners. It's a bit hard to explain. I'm real disappointed, but based on the price I should have known. It's not even worth this price. I also, unfortunately ordered a red one that is just as poorly made."
1.0,"poor quality .received it defective . the rubber inside wasn't sewed to the clip, the mesh part was though."
1.0,Don’t waste your money. After opening once the latch that keeps the circle together broke. So I got another one and the same thing happened
1.0,"I had high hopes for these boots, but they run VERY small. My 8.5 is more like a 7.5. They run narrow and don't appear to be well made. The heel is not a heavy material and the stitching on the boot is loose. The style is cute and the shaft height is perfect, but I can't wear them."
1.0,"The zipper is not working properly.  It is unbelievably hard to zip up and down.  We almost had to break it to get it on.  Then could barely get back out of it.  Very disappointed since this is a expensive dress, a designer label.  Also just sitting at dinner, all the beads/sequins kept falling off.  It is a gorgeous dress but shouldnt be such a poor quality zipper and falling apart just from sitting.  :("
1.0,To long in the waist
1.0,I gave it away it wont fit my ear no matter what I try oh well at least someone is happy with it jusy not me note to self do not buy jewelry on amazon..
1.0,"This product did not arrive as pictured. I returned it because it the clasp method was the typical impossibly difficult wire you're supposed to stick into the end of a tiny tube, which never works on this small size of hoop."
1.0,We were really excited for these dresses they didn't fit.  They're too heavy and sizing is so off.
1.0,Runs easily very thin poor quality
1.0,Didn't hold glasses. Too short.
1.0,"This dress is poor quality and disproportionate. The shoulders and chest were too tight (think Chris Farley “fat guy in a little coat”) and there was way too much extra fabric in the skirt.<br /><br />My biggest issue with this item is that when I requested a return , I was offered a partial refund due to high shipping costs. To me, this is a bit tacky.<br /><br />I ended up returning the dress, which makes me sad because I had been eyeballing this dress for a very long time!"
1.0,The necklace did not have a catch and it came in two strands and the twist knot was undone. I had to send it back for a refund .
1.0,"It was suggested that I order an XL which was consistent with previous Amazon orders. Since there was an elastic waist I assumed there was room for error. In trying on the cargo shorts I was at least 5 inches short of being able to button then, let alone zip them up. I cannot imagine what size I could have ordered that would have fit. Not worth the time and effort to attempt a return."
1.0,Shoe fell apart after wearing them twice
1.0,fell apart while wearing it the first time.  (embarrassing!)
1.0,Worse ever
1.0,"The actual dress does not look much like the picture. The waist comes up super high - right under the breasts instead of at the natural waistline, and the belt was long enough to wrap around me almost three times. I returned it immediately."
1.0,broke as soon as my youth put it on.
1.0,No se queda en la posicion correcta y<br />No lucen asi como  se mira en la foto !!
1.0,The flare is way to big I got them in and now they are stuck in my ears
1.0,"Very disappointed, It fit my nine year old sister!!!!"
1.0,Socks do not fit. No compression.  Very loose.  Not satisfied at all!
1.0,"If you want to turn your expensive sunglasses into cheap hunk of plastic, go ahead and buy. They do not fit into frame well. They wobble, and allow no support for the outer lens frame like my original Costa lenses felt. I bought this product in hopes to save my beautiful Costa lenses from harm. I watched the replacement video given by the manufacture and thought to give a lens replacement a shot. The video looked easy enough. It is by all means a difficult task. My lens broke during the removal. Now I’m left with expensive cheap plastic broken lens and a whole lot of remorse. The replacement lens creek in the frame. The new lens smudges easily and then the light glares directly from the surface. I will now be buying original Costa Lens to replace this crap. Do not buy. Spend the extra $50 on the Costa website. I regret buying. ***update*** customer service was not helpful. They stated there warranty policy without much coarse of action. They then stated I had processed a refund and there was nothing they could do. I had not done that. The lenses are also marketed for scratch resistance, but scratched on the first day of work."
1.0,Lousy construction.  Looks like a tutu sewed to the bottom of a t-shirt.  Does not fit a human child.  A chimp perhaps.
1.0,Requested refund. Never received it. Poor quality product.
1.0,"Be warned: THESE SOCKS ARE NOT OVER-THE-CALF LENGTH.<br /><br />Also, only one of the four has an argyle pattern, and it is so subtle as to be barely noticeable."
1.0,Returned. My granddaughter didn’t like the color when it came.
1.0,These broke within 2 days of use! Do not recommend at all.
1.0,I thought this was a sweater.  It's like a slinky spandex material.
1.0,The skirt did not have any elastic in the waist and the description stated.
1.0,It showed a longer style. It was tooooooo short.<br />But I still liked the lightweight-feel.<br />Cape Verdean colors.
1.0,Very small. More like American medium.
1.0,"As a favor to your customers PLEASE take these awful shirts off the site. They are REALLY POORLY made and the fit is BAD !! I bought them to wear  around the yard while doing chores; they are not even good for that. I knew, for the price, they wouldnt be much, but, they are really awful. I wouldnt even return them, I threw them out!!  This is not a reflection on Amazon, I enjoy your site and doing business with you !!"
1.0,"The pictures suggest it's teal, but it's definitely green and not at all as flowly as the picture suggests. It fits snug against your body and is not very attractive."
1.0,Pierde el color en la primera usada
1.0,"Do NOT order this top. The top I received is not beige with soft colors as depicted in the picture. It is white and the colors are ugly. I don't believe that they photographed the actual shirt that was delivered because it does not look anything like what I received. Very disappointing, as the actual top in the picture is very cute."
1.0,My  order was for a x large was to shall.
1.0,"Not sure which blog linked to these as the ""perfect winter cycling glove"" but they are definitely not fit for cold weather. Also, the large was about the size of a medium. Typical cheap import fabric."
1.0,Came apart after first wear. Also back of shoe caused blisters on back of ankle.
1.0,Sent this back twice. It runs huge. I finally gave up. Looks like maternity wear.
1.0,Do not buy this product if it is offeres through ''QINGSHUI'' the glasses I received are a fake/ cheap plasti/ junk/garbage. Sent in a maui jim case. Rip off/ scam/ They would not did not authorize a return.
1.0,"I purchased this in an XL. I'm only 5'3 1/2, so it should have fit fine. The dress itself did fit, but the length was terribly short. If I'd have bent over, you'd have gotten an eyeful.  On top of that, it came out of the bag smelling AWFUL!  It smelled like a skunk was in the bag with the dress. I returned it immediately."
1.0,"I like this brand pretty well so I took a gamble without seeing any customer photos. It is not like the dress pictured. On the model, it looks loose and flowy. What I received was very structured and thick. It reminded me of scrubs a little bit. It had no give to it and the neck would tape open if I turned. It also tapers in slightly at the bottom creating an unflattering bell shaped effect. The sleeves are also not nearly as large as they look on the model. Over all, it looked boxy and unattractive. I’m 5’6, 125lbs, and have a 27.5 inch waist for reference."
1.0,"One star because I had to...This was ill fitting on me, it doesn't have stricture because it's so thin. Not what O expected 😩"
1.0,"Pretty pattern. But the retracting handle is a joke! It only collapses the canopy, then you have to really press hard with the handle against your body to get the handle to telescope."
1.0,This shirt is ruined after being worn twice. Washed on a delicate cycle and dryed on low heat. No tag on shirt to describe best washer/dryer settings.
1.0,"It worked fine for the first week, after that it started becoming unlatched on its own, very frustrating, you do get what you pay for with this thing!"
1.0,"I don't suggest this product at all.  The material is a cheap, shiny material that halloween costumes are made out of....looks awful!  If you are hell bent on buying this and want a baggy fit then i suggest going 2-3 sizes up."
1.0,My 7 yr old daughter wears a size 1 and I bought a 2 which still turned out to be WAY too small so I decided to just go with an entirely new brand .
1.0,"These are too big.....feels like a pillowcase on my head.  Maybe I will try to use it for a satin pillowcase, otherwise they are useless."
1.0,Esperaba mas ajuste.
1.0,Product gets really thread balled and doesn’t look good after only 2 wears... followed all washing recommendations
1.0,Bought a XXL tall to have an oversized T-shirt.  It was better suited to a size 6 female nightshirt.
1.0,Didn't like fit - bottom more revealing than expected
1.0,"I'm so disappointed! This is such a cute shirt! I'm 5'9"" and wear a medium. It's skin tight and fit me like a belly shirt! No way, I can wear it."
1.0,"They are too small, and I have small hands. The thumb section was positioned in the middle of the palm, and made it difficult to move my thumb. The wrist openings were fine. I would not recommend these gloves."
1.0,Product was much smaller than a large
1.0,I was excited for these shoes to fit my nephew. However the velcro straps don't work and the shoe slips off my nephews foot. I wouldn't recommend this shoe to any child.
1.0,"These socks are poorly made. Pure garbage. Visible snag and loose threads near the toes. The toes sleeves are the exact same length which means none of the toes fit properly. The big toe sleeve is very narrow so it barely fits on the actual toe. Plus, it’s too small for me to wear, returned it right away."
1.0,Is to big and looks nothing like the pictures
1.0,Didn't like at all looks very cheap! Sending it back
1.0,The dress is not made right and looks defective
1.0,"Yes, I bought these on Amazons recommendation, & they work OK.  However, the elastic portion from the hand to the end of the glove is only 2 1/2&#34; while the Atlas Showa 760 from Amazon is 3&#34;.  This means that my watch is uncovered and susceptible to dirt and scratches on the crystal.  Even more puzzling, after wearing the gloves my hands were covered in a gummy substance (the same with 2 pairs).  Truly, a waste of money!  Sorry, Amazon!  Update:  the rubber coating comes off after an hour and they are worthless for pruning roses.  Terrible!!!"
1.0,"Took me 20 minutes to get them on and off, sent them back!"
1.0,"It is nothing like what the model is wearing. It’s so thick and feels like a wool coat. Very boxy looking, thick material. It looks like one of the thick flannel shirts my grandpa wears in the fall as a coat. Horrible. Thankfully it’s Amazon, so I was able to return it."
1.0,I ordered a 2x and it looks like it was made for a child
1.0,"I order grey on grey instead received a tacky looking bright silver pair. I did a return and reorder again for grey/grey. Again same tacky bright silver color. Box is indeed labelled properly on both pairs. Otherwise good quality, and good choice if you like bright shiny silver frame."
1.0,"Odd fit, cheaply made"
1.0,The socks were not easy on easy off. The socks were terrible and caused my leg to bleed when removing them
1.0,Looks good but too thin.
1.0,Poorly made broke the 2nd time I tried to wear it.
1.0,By the reviews the socks looked liked they would keep feet warm. They did not. They are also too thick to wear with a shoe
1.0,"I was really excited by the picture of these jeans, but the actual product is a cheap knock off of whatever brand they are trying to replicate. The holes are in the right spot, but clearly not done in the same style as pictured. The wash also isn’t the same color, or as rich. If you’re spending this much already, go to express when they have a good sale and actually get true quality for just a little more money. No more amazon jeans for me!"
1.0,"The product was missing two pieces. Only the pants arrived at my door step, never received the shirt or sweater. Also the pants had a hole in them from poor stitching."
1.0,"It was thin, not like Beenie material"
1.0,"The analog part of the watch stopped working after 3 hours, took it to a shop and they checked to see if there were 2 batteries (1 for the analog 1 for the digital) and there is in fact one single battery which means the thing just came broken. I was excited because it looked really cool and now it's a distraction whenever I look at the thing.... it's a piece of garbage.<br /><br />I'm a 6-foot tall adult and it fits fine for an adult, it'd probably look ridiculous on a small child though"
1.0,"I was disappointed, the XXL did not fit at all. very tight... I won't buy from them again."
1.0,We plugged it n and charged it but can't seem to get it to work.😞<br />I think it's a great idea though.
1.0,Very very chintzy and even says to not bump it it’s Cetera because the stones will fall out.
1.0,Way too cheap
1.0,"Not. Sturdy product. One of the pins where the band transitions from rubber to leather broke, now I'm back to wearing the original band."
1.0,"horrible, why ? BECAUSE YTHEY STINK SMELL..Washed over and over, but nothing could get the rotten smell out..<br />probably comes from china..DONT BUY, GOD  ONLY KNOWS WHAT THEIR MADE OF OR WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN STORED.<br />PROBABLY SOMETHING DEAD IS WHAT THEY SMELL LIKE..<br />TOO BAD, because I always used to wear these."
1.0,I bought 3 and all didn’t fit. They are Asian size. Ordered XXL but was more like S-M. Disappointed.
1.0,Says they are xl but they fit like a small
1.0,Ordered and only got one out of the 2pc.My wife was disappointed.
1.0,"Omg... I looked forward to getting this bag, and when I did I was soooo disappointed. The material is so thin and cheap. It came crumpled up, and I'm still trying to get it to stiffen out and get it's shape. I had to stuff it with clothes and hang it. The strap was even crumpled up. Ugh... I'm considering returning it, it's that bad."
1.0,Zipper gets stuck and smaller than expected
1.0,"It was bad the material smelled bad and the shape was bad, Also very small.  I would not ever buy anything again from this site"
1.0,Material is cheap and lousy. Don't buy it.
1.0,Cheap look don't waste your money
1.0,"Doesn't fit well, not flattering to your figure."
1.0,"My husband ordered these JJWELL ZX888 C1 reading glasses on Amazon and in no time the glass lense was popping off of the frame. For the price he paid for the one pair, you would think they would last a bit longer. No more of these and I wouldn’t recommend them."
1.0,This dress looks nothing like the images<br />It fits like it’s meant for a child<br />The length was mid knee and the sleeve openings were super small
1.0,it doesn't smooths the carum board. it also leaves crumbs.
1.0,"Don't be duped, bootleg products ya'll."
1.0,So disappointed not as pictured the small stripes are supposed to be red not light blue!😣
1.0,Una porqueria súper transparente
1.0,Never received.
1.0,"I ordered ""these"".... I received ONE full face lens. Waste of time, energy and money."
1.0,"This dress runs at least 3 sizes smaller then you would normally wear.<br />I’m having a problem with getting a return address for this product and feel I’m going to get stuck with 2 dresses that never fit.  Tried to contact Amazon but they did not help me at all,  staff was very rude."
1.0,Never got my necklace I don’t recommend this to anyone
1.0,"This purse is very thin. It might fit a notebook inside of it. I was very disappointed in the purse. I ordered it as a Christmas present, and I am not giving it to its intended recipient"
1.0,Turns your finger green after about a week.
1.0,Didn’t even close to fit the watch. What a piece of junk!
1.0,Too long. Waist line not very wide or controlling.
1.0,"Worst pair of thigh high stockings I've ever owned.  Couldn't return due to mangling the box when I opened it.  Horribly uncomfortable, scratchy and they would not stay up at all.  Would never buy again."
1.0,Very big material is super stretchy. Cute
1.0,You need 2 people to get this swimsuit on. It’s really a pain.
1.0,There is no way possible that this a licensed product.  Be ware.  Probably Chinese kid labor manufactured.
1.0,"Awful, it came and was a dented and bent all up, came in a plastic bag, I was very disappointed, DO NOT BUY"
1.0,Smells chemical even though it has been used for swimming & washed too many times
1.0,The product doesn't work. It attaches to the finger and it's not thick enough to make the ring smaller and because of that it still twirls around on my finger. Save your money. I wish I had. Maybe that's why they don't give refunds...too many people are unhappy with the product...can't afford to give everyone their money back.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY! NO WAY ANY OF THE MODELS IN THE PICTURES WAS WEARING WHAT I RECEIVED. These are SMALL, LIKE FOR A CHILD, cannot get over our head to put on. I took a picture of an actual adult size gaiter, and put it next to the bandana gaiter. The pictures show it draping and covering neck, into chest, WRONG barely covers the neck. FALSE ADVERTISING!"
1.0,I have ordered other items from this company and have been satisfied. However this time I received a top that looks nothing like the one pictured. So disappointing!
1.0,To thin and I don’t feel safe wearing them poorly made as well … I could’ve bought a Easter decal and a mask and probably made it myself! Wasted money!
1.0,This was a huge waste! as a huge waste!  No sized correctly . return at your own risk and expense.
1.0,My daughter wore these sneakers 3 times and the left foot doesn't light up any longer - it won't charge.
1.0,"I ordered this hat earlier in 2022 and it was a high-quality embroidered logo.  When I hit ""buy again"" the product I received was a cheap iron on image.  The product description claims it is embroidered. TRIED TO RETURN BUT THEY WANT ME TO SEND TO CHINA AT MY EXPENSE - DON'T BUY THIS"
1.0,jacket is like plastic paper and its small and the scarf if usable once. Don't mess up or you can't use it again
1.0,Doesn’t fit 5600 properly.
1.0,Very cheap. The lettering was smudged.
1.0,Nose piece on this is way to big
1.0,"REALLY cheap materials. Terrible fit and they need to be ""put together and glued"" before you could wear them. They don't look like on the website picture. GARBAGE!"
1.0,The ones I got were obviously for adults and one of masks’ elastic piece that hooks onto the ear broke almost immediately. 0/10 do not recommend.
1.0,This is what i got and i order a gold one and it does not even have a cover so disappointed
1.0,Awful poked me in the back all day long.
1.0,The bracelet broke 2 days later
1.0,"nothing like the image. different material, different fit,different color shade."
1.0,Color of earrings show a blue color.  I got  white.  Why do you have blue on the image.???????  I want a refund.  I have enough white ones.
1.0,Very cheep looking - fabric very thin
1.0,Material feels cheap and they are a weird length. Returning.
1.0,I wore these to a party and they broke within one hour. Not made well at all.
1.0,"Defective pot burner, it’s poorly attached making it unsafe to use, I’ll be returning this camp stove unfortunately."
1.0,Not a mirrored lens as it says in the description. No tinting to the lens at all. Doesn't say the lens is clear. Very disappointed. They are novelty so we will pass them out on vacation but they will not shade anyone's eyes 400uvb or not a filter doesn't do it.
1.0,POS. There are 2 seams that run the length of the barbel that are so sharp they cut open a healed tongue piercing. The balls themselves are threaded so shallow that they just fall off within minutes of putting the jewelry in. Total trash. I threw them away after the first day of wearing them.
1.0,Broke apart after a few months !
1.0,Cheap and not worth it
1.0,"Disappointed because this was my second attempt at watch band replacement and this was pretty. It was difficult to use the separate pins. It is easy to get the links off and on but as tight as you need to have it to avoid it slipping under the watch, it was impossible to do by myself. The side metal slips under watch and breaks connection."
1.0,Ordered what I thought to be a common size and was much smaller than expected.
1.0,"This is actually the worst. I order cosplays online all the time, but this— this was garbage. The pants fit right for a small, but the tunic was loose and frumpy. The belt was enormous, and I have big hips for a size “small” so that’s saying something. There’s no redeeming quality. The armor is laughable (pictured: a “leg” piece— for whose leg, I don’t know). The head piece is also just... the worst. The actual worst. It’s not even proportioned accurately.<br />Also, the whole thing is this really unimpressive spandex with poorly printed details— so for $140+, you get quality that Party City and Spirit Halloween would laugh at.<br />If I could give it 0 stars, I would.<br />This is not the way, the force is not with this one, blah blah blah.<br />It just ain’t it, chief."
1.0,"Runs a little small, uncomfortable fit."
1.0,It says it's stretchy in the reviews. It's not. It's a stiff horrible meterial with a cheap zipper on the back.
1.0,This tunic is too clingy and the pockets make 2 small lumps at your hips right where you don't want extra lumps.  I wouldn't recommend it.
1.0,"I liked the look of the ring, but it is junk. The main diamond fell out and was lost after only 10 days of receiving it. Hopefully Amazon will take it back.Amazon did let me return it but am still waiting to see refund."
1.0,I couldn't get them to close and stay closed.  First lost within 2 hours.  Second one I found on my shirt.  Gave up after that.
1.0,Too small too tight
1.0,"This dress has no give, As soon as I put it on I heard the stitches rip. There is no flexibility or give in this dress. When trying to return the whole amount isn’t refunded. I should Be refunded the entire amount for a item that did not stretch as described. I am lucky if I weigh 105 and 5’7”, a small has been the size I have ordered from three different sellers, this one does not come as promised."
1.0,"Wow. I've never experienced a size misrepresentation nearly as bad as this one for a product.  The extra large fits like a medium. I'm not a large man, but we all learn over the years to buy 1 size up when it comes to underwear. The 2 size difference for this product is fraudulent even for the style these are."
1.0,"Dramatically too small.<br /><br />Based on the reviews, I bought 2XL --. trying to go 2 sizes larger than needed.<br /><br />These &#34;2XLs&#34; are, at the very best a small or small/medium.<br /><br />Unwearable."
1.0,"I have always liked oversized shirts and I like cotton shirts. I wasn't expecting that strange piece on the back. What is the purpose of that ugly add-on I have no clue. Maybe it was conceived for women with ample buttocks? If so, why not make the shirt wider instead of sewing that pleated sown-on piece of fabric that turns the shirt into an eyesore?<br /><br />I never saw a photo of the back. If I had, I wouldn't have ordered."
1.0,"This shirt is nothing like what the picture shows. It’s very tight on and in the photo it shows a more flowy shirt. I wear a large, ordered a large and it was too small. I’ll be returning."
1.0,It is very cute in person however after wearing it for a few weeks it broke in half. I have very small fingers and switched from pinky to other fingers it gave in and snapped in half 😞  Had to return for credit.
1.0,Threw them away<br />Chemical can be harmful to my kid no no no
1.0,"Hi, I'm writing today because I sold a nice jacket but very badly drawn up until this day could remove the jacket with you purchase, shipping was timely but today was that I could hold her in my hands, I I put the jacket and then when I went to unbutton, brooches fell off, that shoddy not like to do with this jacket that because I live in Venezuela forwarding of clothing is more expensive even than the same jacket, with all the respect they deserve, you sold me crap, I expect an answer from the buyer to try to see how to resolve this situation, I feel cheated"
1.0,Wore 1 time for MAYBE 5 hours and the fabric was pilling like crazy! Extremely sad since they are super cute and fit good!
1.0,This dress arrived no where near resembling the brown in the picture - I am returning it - it is a beige color!!!
1.0,These earrings don’t even open wide enough for a baby’s ear. The image is so deceiving!  The are “tiny.”  Not worth it!
1.0,Sharp rigid plastic edges that will cut your feet up.
1.0,This dress was horrible. Looks cotton in the pictures but it's not... 100% polyester and looks terrible on me! I am 5'5&#34; and weigh 220lbs and got a 2x and it's SO tight! Super uncomfortable and not flattering at all. Would not recommend at all.
1.0,hard to use
1.0,Item is not as pictured and they won't authorize the return.
1.0,Beautiful print this says adult sizes but would only fit a  child.
1.0,cheap quality. buyers beware.
1.0,I purchased these and within 2 weeks the plastic part of the side of the goggles broke. I contacted the company but I never got a response back. I won't be buying this again.
1.0,The day after wearing them for the first time the zipper disconnected from the shorts.
1.0,Don’t
1.0,I want to return item
1.0,"Material looked like old lady silky underwear.. not awful it’s just the best way I can describe it. Very slinky stretchy material. THIS IS NOT a maxi dress and I’m 5’3’’. I ordered the pink which looks mauve in the picture but what arrived is HOT PEPTO BISMOL PINK. I am returning this dress. For the price of the dress, I expected much more."
1.0,"Returning today.....this material is about as thick as toilet paper, and feels as though it will tear as soon as I put it on.  The colors are pretty, but it is SOOO THINLY made, and poorly stitched, that I don't see me wearing this...GARBAGE..."
1.0,"Polyester look to fabric, thin material.<br />Size is some what small. Shipped from China, so return was not cost effective."
1.0,"Just got this personalized necklace out of the mailbox. Although it's a nice item, it was supposed to say ""Angela,"" and it instead says, ""Sophie."" I don't know anyone named, Sophie , so it's an unusable piece of jewlery."
1.0,There is nothing to like about this product. . A Total waist of money and time.
1.0,The finish wore off after a month.
1.0,So unreal small
1.0,Shoes were to small
1.0,See through top. Very boxy
1.0,"As is the case with most clothing from China, way too small."
1.0,"My order was &#34;returned&#34;. Still unclear as to why. Best I can tell it was an issue with Mudder, not completing their order issued through Amazon? Maybe?"
1.0,"Totally useless wrap, so small and no adjustment, might fit very small kids"
1.0,The quality of this product is absolutely horrible! Satisfaction is not guaranteed because sell will not let you return it. I would not buy from this seller.
1.0,Material is thin and badly sewn together the waist band is uneven and part of the zipper is sewn shut
1.0,"these things are awesome!!!.....mind you I was not expecting much for $20.00.... but when these guys showed up and they fit my FAT head  I was more than excited!!!...sound quality is good enough for walking,jogging , do anything outside ...the only thing left to see is if they will last very long...I have had sound bot products in the past that were not the greatest....but so far these are a bargain, and by the way i wear a size 7 3/4 fitted baseball cap ....so if you have a big Brain like I do , these will fit fine:).....Update review to follow soon....UPDATE 1/16/2016.....so disappointed two days later won't power on.....should have known better that soundbot= garbage and zero quality ....really fell in love with these but serious let down after working for two days...I will try and implement my own blue tooth head phones into the beanie and salvage something that way hopefully :("
1.0,These gloves are too tight and i have small hands i was very dissapointed. The smell of these gloves is very strong and will linger after you take them off. I recommened to pay a little more for better quality.
1.0,In less than two months the dial cover fell off and moisture got inside the watch. Now it doesn’t keep the correct time.
1.0,"Do not purchase it if you can escape the misleading picture, material is very very cheap and not very well made. Just awful...."
1.0,Item keeps coming coming apart an keep tearing up my clothes  and everything it catches on just horrible
1.0,The thing part that hooks the loop broke off same day I got it
1.0,"Earring are beautiful, but when these arrived the earring post were completely bent out of shape!"
1.0,"Color is great ... as far as showing every detail of your body, uh very much!  I’m 5”3’ 127 lbs and I still felt like every detail of my upper thigh and booty were enhanced in all the wrong ways.  That and they show sweat in areas most would prefer it to not show.  Don’t waist your money, put it towards a product that’s actually worth it, sadly.  I usually go for Under Armour, but opted for these due to such an amazing price.  Yes, I read the reviews before purchasing, ended up getting 2 pairs (hot pink and turquoise).  They are very comfortable, and might even be good for a cool fall/spring morning run when sweating is at a minimum and less people are around.  However, gym goers beware!"
1.0,"Nice casual dress but waaaay too long! Even at 5'6 with 4"" wedges the dress still on the floor covering my shoes.  It's too late to return and not worth it to alter so guess it'll be a nightgown :/"
1.0,I ordered both a 4x and 5x and both were way off in size and did not fit. I normally wear a 2-3x The material does not give. Terrible!
1.0,"I gave this one star because of quality. I don’t understand why anyone would bother making a swimsuit out of cheap thin material unless it is fully lined?! I ordered one size bigger than I normally do (Large) as I have a long torso, and it fit well. Just a tad loose as short as it’s probably made for shorter torsos, but I was ok with that and it fit well enough. The problem at hand, is that the front is lined but when I look at the back it’s CLEAR! As in not lined and my full bum crack is on display. If I wanted to show some cheek I would have gone with a cheeky swimsuit. But a full bum coverage swim suit should not be see through. This problem would have been fixed if the back was lined like the front or if it was made out of better swimsuit material."
1.0,"These lasted two months, and the back of the boot came apart at the sole."
1.0,"What else can I say?  This is very, very cheap.  I've had many ear cuffs over my lifetime but this is the first one that has ever crumbled.  Not impressed."
1.0,I ordered a 3T for an 18-month old child.  The shorts are well-made & fit as expected.  The blouse was flimsy & had no relation to the reality of the anatomy of a child.
1.0,Looked like pop corn very cheaply made doesnt look like the pic
1.0,"While the shoes fit as expected, the inside lining came off after wearing them only one time for 30 minutes. Then the entire rubber part came loose from the fabric within a month of wearing them. Note: they were only worn inside, no running. VERY POOR QUALITY"
1.0,"Wayyyyyy to small!!! I got the XL and it fits like a medium I'm 5,11 205 and can't put it on.."
1.0,Worst clothing item I’ve ever purchased online. Nothing like the picture
1.0,"Looks nothing like pictured.  It is pink and gray not melon, white and blue."
1.0,"Always foggy, Goggles broke around nose and got no response from retailer, despite one year warranty. Totally interrupted my daily routine."
1.0,No me agradó el material ni la terminación muy corriente
1.0,The goggles is broken in 2 uses
1.0,Too fluffy. It’s nice but not for me.
1.0,"If you want a shirt, or if you are vertically challenged, this is the dress for you!"
1.0,Poor quality and bulky.
1.0,I do not like it is horrible
1.0,Measurements are off. Way smaller than what it says...
1.0,Exageradamente pequeño usual mente estoy entre m-l y esto no me entró no de chiste muy buena la tela pero es muy muy pequeño
1.0,was expecting something a little bigger it is very very tiny!
1.0,"Such a cute shirt. I'm generally a size 12-14 and I'm 5'9' 140 and definitely should have been able to get into the size 12 but it was so skin tight. Disappointed, seller should mark everything down two sizes for a more accurate fit. Because it was only $10 it's not worth the hassle of returning, I'll just donate it to Goodwill."
1.0,"Hockey charm set--  came with Baseball players, not hockey players. Very disappointing"
1.0,Well everything was runned vere small it will fit a toddler not a junior boy 8yrs old
1.0,Did not fit as expected and I did not like the quality of the material
1.0,"The matte black ball is very nice, but the stone ball looks like a Q-tip with stones stuck on.  Very cheap looking.  I realize they are inexpensive, so you know the old saying, you get what you pay for!"
1.0,This apron is very cheaply made  and not durable at all!!
1.0,"Just received my watch yesterday, opened it today and noticed that the band is ripped. It looks like whoever or whatever put it together made a new hole to attach the base to the band. Other than that it's a beautiful watch, would love to wear it!!"
1.0,FAKO bad quality.
1.0,I ordered the correct size but it was definitely not the right size on the tag
1.0,"It has a nice look an incredibly lite but it certainly has flaws.  The band is painful to wear.  The stitching used is sharp and digs into the undeside of my wrist and the black version bled dye onto my skin also.  On a good note, the time has been perfectly accurate."
1.0,The shorts weren't like the picture.  They were too short and too big.  Their return policy sticks.  There was no free return.  I will not buy a product from them again!
1.0,This turned my finger green within the 1st week
1.0,Threaded end snapped off after only days.
1.0,need two size up.
1.0,I always bought a small size from other brands.  The pajamas were not sized correctly. They were tight in the waist and had to be worn at the hip. The distance between the waistband and the crotch allowed very little space  and was tight. The top was tight too. Cheaply made.
1.0,Way bigger than I was expecting
1.0,Charm is much smaller than displayed in the picture. I gave this a 1 star because it came broken. Given the price i was not too upset but it was definitely not worth paying to return to seller.
1.0,"If you are looking for soft, comfy pajama bottoms,  this is NOT for you. Even after laundering with fabric softener, they feel like you're putting stiff parchment paper on your legs."
1.0,"I ordered this for my tall 4 year old. The prints were very cute, but the fabric and fit of the bathing suit were way off. The fabric on the top didn’t seem to be true swimsuit material. It was sort of see through in the arms and didn’t seem like it would offer any sun protection at all. The sleeves were 3/4 length (not sure if they were meant to be that way or not), but overall the top fit her. The bottoms had way too much fabric. They would have fit a small adult. It was very strange."
1.0,Cheap flimsy and low quality
1.0,THIS IS FROM CHINA A CHEAP PEICE O CRAP NOT WHAT IS ADVERTISED - THIS IS A PENNY ITEM @ BEST-GOOD LUCK
1.0,They were pretty but 2 stones were missing when they arrived. I wore them anyway but then 3 more fell out after the first time I wore them. They are crap and not worth 26 dollars.
1.0,So the description says specifically that they are 16 gauge bars and they clearly are not. I got kine and they were to large to even be so they looked more like 14 gauge. They are super cool looking and looks like they are great quality and sadly I can’t use them.
1.0,My daughter worn it only one time and it start tearing off see picture
1.0,Amazon suggested size 12 after ordering 11. Guess what! Too big!
1.0,The seller never contacted me to see if they can exchange it the zipper doesn't zip up either bad customer service.
1.0,"I actually really like this product and want to keep it if there was no design flaw. Like other buyer has mentioned it has a threaded bolt that unscrews to easily attach your keys, but the big problem is it will somehow unscrew itself during normal use. I only used it for a week, the thing came loose and the little screw was nowhere to be found."
1.0,"I never got a chance to wear these, due to the overwhelming chemical smell. I have washed them several times. Kept them outside for 1 week to get fresh air. Let the sit in baking soda. Sprayed w/ vinegar. Nothing got the smell out. I ended up throwing them away w/o wearing them once."
1.0,"My son is a size 5T ordered a size 6T but it fits to tight, need to exchange to a 7T but there isn't any available 🤦‍♀️😫"
1.0,"They didn’t stay on well. I thoroughly cleaned the eyeglass nose pieces with alcohol so I don’t think it’s me. I used all the pairs, with the same results. I would love to find thicker, more padded ones, but I didn’t find any. These weren’t good for me."
1.0,The first time I tried to put this on it broke
1.0,I ordered a large cause i wear a 38 DD  but yhis bra only covered my nipples  and i couldnt get it to go around me  so if your ordering go aleast 2 sizes up from your size
1.0,Extremely see through and does not fit body well.
1.0,"Returning the second watch delivered with the same defect. Second hand is not properly attached. Flips about in either direction making accurate time keeping, impossible! Looks cool, but not functional."
1.0,"Way to small, returned the item.  Don't bother if you have a chest larger then a C cup"
1.0,Came with a hole.
1.0,My son purchased this product through Amazon.  He used the product on his brand new white Nike shoes.  His shoes are not ruined.  They turned a horrible color after using your product.  His shoes cost him $135 and are now ruined.  I would like this company to fix this.  I have pictures of what his shoes looked like before and what they look like now.  I fell this company needs to replace my son's shoes with a new pair.  This is a horrible product.
1.0,Cheap trash
1.0,Very cool when purchased . Way too hard to put on. Looks nice but .. The wires are actually coming out and I literally have worn it for two days.. Definitely not a good buy
1.0,Not a good Value
1.0,"I bought this to use on my silicone adhesive NuBra & frankly, the push down-pop-top is stuck in the closed position. In order to use it I have to unscrew the lid, and pour/dribble a small amount out. The product seemed to work up a small amount of lather, which is fine and good. I'm just peeved about the potential for waist when having to &#34;pour&#34; this to try and equal what should just be a couple of drops from the pop-top-lid."
1.0,broke the first week i had them they broke in pocket while getting in my car
1.0,"For $10 you don't expect much, but wow, this is something you'd be disappointed in if you got it free in a cereal box.<br />Might be a good gift for a mother-in-law though."
1.0,They are really big and cheap looking. I will not wear them ever. Bad bad purchase
1.0,Dress was too small and it was a hassle trying to return it. And personally I would never buy from them again.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:2bbc4c0a08631c573117823b5cbc6c36]] Shirts weren’t Linen as advertised
1.0,I couldn’t use these and I tried but the upper lenses distorted at every distance. The reader portion in the lower portion of the lenses was ok but I gave up trying to adapt to the rest of the lenses. Unfortunately I went past the return date so just wasted money for me
1.0,These earrings were not in a metal tin with that saying. They came loose in a cheap bag with some letters on it. No tin at all. The earrings themselves were awful. They had bubbles and damage to the metal. I purchased the exact same ones from another vendor the same day and those were beautiful. Returning.
1.0,The package was not sealed it was empty
1.0,"Feedback I got was, &#34;Looks like a dead animal!&#34; I  returned it."
1.0,Not one of them were shipped to me that didn’t have a defect… The crystals fall out very easily and the clips are not strong!
1.0,I only got to use this one than u wash it not sure but was all rip apart and I had the same washer fore 2 years know never happen again
1.0,"This was probably the most useless tool I've ever bought from Amazon.  The tool attempts to push a plastic pin through your material (shirt, blouse, small mammal) and through a button, and the pin unfolds at an angle to hold the button and the material together.  AFTER ABOUT 785 pins, six holes in my thumb, and screaming MOMMY for an hour, I finally attached TWO buttons.  Useless, totally useless."
1.0,"Super small pin, read description! Ha!"
1.0,"These shoes are way too small.  I ordered a size 10 because I have worn size 10 in all kinds of shoes for over 30 years.  These cheap pieces of garbage are so tight they cut my circulation and make my feet colder than if I don't wear any shoes at all.  The manufacturer probably saves a few cents on every pair by making them smaller than they should be.  (and yes the label says they are the size I ordered, so that is not the problem)"
1.0,"It's ok, small, you are only allowed 3 lines with 10 characters only and spaces are included in those characters. Whoever obtains the information you want engraved is not at all personable."
1.0,Disappointed at the quality of the stitches . I will let the picture speak for it self self .This happened after washing it for the first time .
1.0,The watch stopped working a few days after  I got it. Appears to be very cheaply made.
1.0,Not for curvy girls I guess. Everywhere was too large except the crotch area was oddly tight giving me a moose knuckle.
1.0,"The shirt had multiple areas where the stitching came apart and a hole was created. The material is nice, I really loved the shirt but it developed a hole in the side after one time wearing. The stitching completely came apart."
1.0,"It has holes in it....I prefer to think it was snagged and not nice, but regardles.. HOLES!"
1.0,The frames are kind of small. Looks Almost like a childs size
1.0,"The fabric was horrible, heavy polyester-like.  It took forever to get, granted I ordered before the virus and know shipping was crazy.  It was probably 4 sizes smaller than it should have been.  Am really going to start watch companies...  I guess the bottom line is you pay for what you get.  Don’t bother."
1.0,"I really couldn't tell if this item was supposed to be a sweater or just a thicker top. The material is confusing. It's textured, but a little thicker than a normal top. I dont like the cuffed sleeve look, it doesn't fit this type of shirt. The colors were okay, but they seem a little more faded than the advertised picture. The fit was somewhat big, which I like, but the overall fit was not flattering."
1.0,The shirt was very see through and the fit smaller than expected. Will not buy again. And to return it is such a hassle.
1.0,"My lymphatic therapist recommended Bioflect products to help manage my lipo-lymphedema. Since I was enjoying the Bioflect capris, I decided to add this vest to my collection. HORRIFIC decision. After ONE wear I noticed a snag in my FIRST one. I shipped it back and got a second one. After putting it on, as directed, above is what I looked like. I sent it back, requested a refund, and will never purchase this vest again!"
1.0,Luminous hand and figure not working as shown in pictures. Always after setting time it goes 1 hour advance. Very strange...
1.0,Would like to return for refundyes
1.0,The material of this dress is awful. It feels like a tent or a wind breaker. I was so sad because it’s so cute.
1.0,"I purchased a small but it fits like an extra large. Shoulders hang off, sleeves are ridiculously wide and long. Boxy isn't even the right word. Product images show the fabric is the same color inside as outside, but it's cheap white printed polyester. I had to clean up several loose threads. I'm not sending it back bc I do like the print and I can modify it to make it work, but want others to know what they're getting into before they purchase."
1.0,Cheap crap and way too big
1.0,The fit was horrible....way too long and the elastic at the bottom was too tight.<br />It was tight around the back and too big at the torso
1.0,Received this umbrella for a gift and the center bar that holds the umbrella was bent above the handle makes it impossible to hold the umbrella.  Its going back.
1.0,"The glasses look great. I bought 5 pairs. Incredibly, 3 of the 5 cracked in the frame below the lens in roughly the same place. I contacted #izipizi about it a few times and they will not replace the glasses. They do not stand behind their products at all! After doing a little research online it is clear I am not the only one who experienced this precise problem. Clearly there is a manufacturing or design defect and the company refuses to publicly acknowledge the problem. Never buy any eyewear from #izipizi because it's a waste of money no matter how inexpensive if they will just crack. Better to buy quality acetate frames. #izipizi is rotten."
1.0,This should've been a little to big.  She couldn't even get it on and normally wears 1X.
1.0,The sizing choices did not work well and it broke today
1.0,Cheap and not worth the money.
1.0,Material to thin and cheap made.Hate it.
1.0,"this bracelet is very cheap, waste of money, don't buy this!"
1.0,"It would have been a great purchase, but all broke within a few days. And no, our lifestyle is nit crazy."
1.0,Was already pilling when it arrived and now it’s even worse  I’m shocked about the quality of the product. I would like to return it but missed the window. Online shopping is tricky for that.
1.0,This dress looked cute when I bought online. I thought it would fit looser since I went up a size. This was not the case. It was extremely tight from the chest to waist and extremely unflattering. It was also slightly see-through which it does not look this way in product photos. It was a lot shorter than expected as well. The fabric itself feels cheap and thick. Don’t waste your money on this dress.
1.0,Washed in cold water and shrunk like crazy!
1.0,Already turned
1.0,Super small I'm sending them back
1.0,Poor packaging and rhinestones were missing.
1.0,"Cute little bag, but the nose/whiskers piece fell off about 10 minutes after my daughter opened it.  The metal piece on the back fell off the nose.  No way I could get it back on using that.  Craft glue was also not an option. Luckily, I am a quilter and a crafter, and I had gold thread in my stash which I used to sew the piece back on by looping the thread through the whiskers.  My daughter will still use it, but we shouldn't have had to go through all that.  Super cute, but cheap crap."
1.0,The ribbons on the inside were not symmetrical so it didn't stay on my face. Hung there crookedly. Some of the gems must have fallen out and were replaced with dirty looking jewels. Couldn't wear the mask. Will be returning.
1.0,"These are assorted color AND size.<br />Ordered medium, and recived 1 small, 1 medium, 1 large, and 2 XXXL.<br /><br />The quality is below average."
1.0,One leg came apart with only one week of use.
1.0,I just received the Product and open the Box.  Guess what it was &#34;DOA&#34; Woo Hoo
1.0,Poor craftsmanship. You can see the stitches below the knot.
1.0,There is no reason to put 'set of 6' in the title.  You only get one pair of glasses. Very deceiving.
1.0,I thought it would be like gauze material but its a very stiff cotton.
1.0,Cheaply made. Design concept is beautiful though
1.0,The band was too short. No option to get it in a long.
1.0,WARNING!!!<br />THESE GLOVES MIGHT BE THE MOST CHEAPLY MADE ONES I HAVE EVER SEEN. THEY SEEM TO BE UNRAVELING STRAIGHT OUT OF THE PACKAGE. THEY ARE SO THIN AND FALSELY ADVERTISED AS HAVING A WARM LINING. THERE IS NOOOO LINING. AMAZON SHOULD SCRAP THESE FROM THEIR INVENTORY. THESE GLOVES DESERVE A MINUS STAR REVIEW IF IT EXISTED.
1.0,"The tag says 100% cotton, but this is the strechiest material (and fairly scratchy, too). It is obviously polyester and spandex. It feels like a swim shirt, not like a cotton t-shirt. I wouldn't recommend, especially for the summer."
1.0,Very thin see through fabric. Don't waste your money. Runs very big.
1.0,Larger than we expected and cheaply
1.0,"Got here late. Not at all what the pictures describe. Way to small to hold anything even though the picture shows it holding a tablet. My wallet almost doesn't fit. I bought because it looked rather big on the girl in the picture. Not even close to what the picture shows. I got it carry my walley, planner and tablet for work, they don't even fit enough to zip it button it shut."
1.0,"The size is too big, and the Velcro on the shoes doesn't match the size.  Not recommended at all."
1.0,I got medium size but too small
1.0,"Trash, fell apart within 5 mins if putting it on"
1.0,"After about six months the mechanism to release the buckle, in order to take the belt off, jammed.  I had to cut the the belt with heavy scissors in order to get it off.  The  ""release mechanism"" jammed.  I have a second belt from the same company, with a similar buckle..... I'm hoping it doesn't jam  also."
1.0,"I would have given this product 5 stars if it wasn't for the pants being too short. I LOVE how they fit elsewhere. I am 5'3,118 lbs I ordered a small and they were too short (to my ankles) I ended up returning them.....  they were perfect everywhere else except the length."
1.0,"WAY to small. I took a risk here as a sizable thick woman and lost. This set is way to small and I even ordered two sizes up. If you have a larger body, don’t even bother ordering this."
1.0,This item smelled horribly like fish. I have washed it 2xs and this still didn’t help!  It’s horrible
1.0,Has a cheap clasp. Its in the garbage.
1.0,I have flat feet and this shoe did not work for me ... Very little arch support ... did like the thinness and breathable material
1.0,"The post is off-center, making the pin hang upside down. The enamel is fairly cheap and might actually be a sticker; I didn’t want to ruin it by testing."
1.0,My son wore this to church 1 time and the chain broke.
1.0,Sloppy work done! Looks like a child did it. Red paint is all over the chains! The paint was in any way applied with care! VERY DISAPPOINTED!
1.0,Disliked.
1.0,These are not warm nor comfy! Air blows right through the thin material and does not provide any warmth at all. They are not comfy and are actually pretty stiff and rough. I do not recommend these at all and wish I never would have wasted my money on them.
1.0,Simply didn't function as stated in the product description.
1.0,"Sterling silver does not break me out.. This has given me a bad rash on my neck.. This should have not given me a rash, I am not allergic to sterling silver.. I ware lots of it."
1.0,Followed washing instructions to a tee and the color on The sleeves still ran on to the white part of the shirt
1.0,"Ordered a WOMENS size small for a 12 year old girl. For reference, women's smalls are too big for her, but she prefers the fit. The shirt was laughably small, like could fit a small child small. The picture of Toga is a fraction of the size that's pictured here, the only plus is the fabric was very soft. So if you want to waste your money on this shirt, go up like 3 sizes and HOPE the picture of Toga increases with the increased shirt size."
1.0,I was very disappointed in this item. I ordered a 2XL to insure the item fit well due to some of the reviews saying it runs small. When I received my package it was packed nicely until I opened it to find out it was a 2XL that fits a little girl. I could not even get the pants past my thighs and the jacket would not go on my arms. I will never order from them anymore.
1.0,I ordered a 4xl size and it was even smaller on me than a 3xl.  I am in the process of returning the item.
1.0,This strap is not genuine leather. It's made like polyurethane or something. It's too light to be genuine leather.<br />True size.
1.0,I washed these and they look super funny!! tiny and they do fit a bit tighter :( im a 8.5 shoe n they feel a little too snug in the back after a few hours of use in my opinion. Maybe dont dry them in the dryer???
1.0,"Flimsy.  The photos make it look firm and sturdy.  Was planning to use as a carry on, but not sure if I am keeping it or not..."
1.0,It's very pretty but it will not clasp so save your money.
1.0,Gloves are junk.  Lasted 2 days and then ripped.
1.0,Wheels Broke during first trip. The large one can't handle 45 lbs of stuff. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
1.0,I am very dissatisfied with this product. The buckles are flimsy and look like they're about to fall apart before they're even used. The slides look as if they'll bend in the first wash. The face of the button dented when I attached it to the denim. If I wasn't desperate to wear my overalls I'd be returning these.
1.0,Product stated fit as should but actually ran small. Super disappointed
1.0,I ordered my normal size and while it could have been a nice shirt it was ridiculously small!
1.0,I ordered my normal size and they were a little too small so I ordered the next bigger size assuming they would be perfect and they fit exactly the same as the smaller pair I had before. I have spent the money twice for products that don't fit.
1.0,Made of a cheep almost halloween costume material.  SO disappointed!!!
1.0,"I'm a thin person and the socks are way too tight below the knee, it causes me pain and redness. Unfortunately they don't work because they cause more harm than good."
1.0,"I returned these tank tops because I didn't like them AT ALL. They are stretchy, but are NOT compression tank tops and they're way too short. Anytime I'd bend over, they'd ride up."
1.0,Cute shirt but not true to size
1.0,Color not true to picture!
1.0,"Very small, for men shoe size 11, this needs to be at least one or two size larger. Get size 12 or 13"
1.0,"Got the biggest size available for my 34” waist and 40"" chest.  Even the one that said it should fit my usual size (14) had a measured waist of 30”.  Sent it back."
1.0,"Thin, small and looks like something from the dollar store. I knew it wouldn’t be amazing at this price but this looks like something from the dollar store."
1.0,Broke less then a month of wearing
1.0,Smaller than I thought. This set is the perfect sixer for my granddaughter.  Wrong name on the bags. False advertisements
1.0,"I ordered the pineapple choice & was disappointed that one of the post backs was bent & not fixable. A thin mailing envelope just does not work, put in a box & protect the posts of the earring.  I would pay a little more to have an earring I didn't have to return."
1.0,Really bad product never get that again please be aware
1.0,"This belt looks really nice, but as many others have commented, it stretches a lot, I'm not sure how practical it will be for actually holding pants up. Based on other reviews I bought a medium as I wear a 38&#34; pant, but if I really needed to pull the belt tight I would have a lot of overhang. The other issue I didn't read about, is the belt end is fairly thick, it's a little difficult to get through the loops on some of my pants. All that said, for the price, I'm happy with the purchase.<br /><br />Update 6-2-17: I am no longer happy with this purchase. After wearing may 6-7 times, my medium is now 45&#34; long, and stretches to over 60&#34;. It is no longer wearable for me. I will return if possible."
1.0,Awkward fit not long enough any where
1.0,It is warm but the material feels cheap. The sewing is badly done. I’m afraid the zipper is going to fall off soon.
1.0,"Not what the description of the lenses says, they say Emerald Green but they are the Jade Lenses so they aren't the color they say they are. Plus they say there lenses is Mirrored finish on them which is false information I can see through the front of them which means there transparent. So another false advertising. This is the second pair I have ordered from amazon an have got false info told to me from Amazon about these kinda lenses."
1.0,Poor quality and does not look at all like the picture.  Planning on sending it back.
1.0,Don’t waste your $$$ this is horrible quality!!!! I can’t believe I paid that amount for a damn 5$ dollar tshirt !
1.0,Terrible lost stones 2 next day.<br /><br />Feel ripped off!
1.0,"Got it today and it was scratched when I opened it. It scratches very easily, it definitely doesn’t feel like leather.  Did not fit the apple watch well and it was loose in the apple watch frame. It also was uncomfortable to wear."
1.0,"Bag is amazing out of box.  However, once I reached my first destination, it all went downhill.  Bag was ripped upon first destination, piping/edging frayed upon second destination, broken zipper on third destination.  Think twice about lightweight....try a clamshell/ABS instead.  This is absolute garbage."
1.0,This is more like a child's toy than a fashion statement for any grown woman unless you have toothpick for fingers or buying this for a five year old I strongly do not recommended but as the saying goes you get what you pay for 😞
1.0,The rubber bands break almost instantly. Both broke in 24 hours of installing them. Now I use metal clips.
1.0,"ordered two skirts supposedly the same ....but they were not ..spend the extra money , this is very low quality, amazon gave me my money back thank goodness"
1.0,"Oh my gosh, I ordered a Medium after reading reviews that it ran small. I'm not kidding, this is HUGE. I made sure the size stated M on the garment and on the package. The material feels very stiff. Be wary."
1.0,"Runs at least a size small, order up size!"
1.0,I really wanted to like this but it just was not flattering at all. The material is very thick and comfortable but I just did not how it looked.
1.0,"I purchased these for party favors (in support of our friend who was diagnosed with breast cancer) for a Ta Ta to your TaTa’s party. Instead, of the bracelets pictured, I received bracelets that said We’re Praying For You, with crosses. So frustrating!"
1.0,it fits larger than expected for me
1.0,Poorly made and does not fit right.
1.0,strap broke on first use
1.0,"Might be a great pack, but this one is decidedly not camouflage. Dry earth color is brown"
1.0,"Hated these, they constantly slipped under my heal which made them worthless. Threw them out."
1.0,There is not much stretch and the outfit runs small
1.0,Pole is too slender to fit standard bases
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:57b4f1a102458a5ca93497c3d6338680]] It's much bigger than the original, doesn't fit the Garminn6 pro Solar, really disappointed."
1.0,"This suit was so tight, and wasn’t cute.  My chest slipped out, the side straps were suffocating.  I returned this."
1.0,Really hard to put together by yourself. Mine came missing one of the side pole covers and a rip in the net.
1.0,"Too big, fell off and lost it."
1.0,I changed my rating to 1 star because the chain is flimsy and brakes easily. The fist one came broken so ordered the replacement. After 2 days the chain broke.
1.0,Terrible watch! Way too big for my wrist! Tried to tightening it but it’s very difficult to put back together! Now I just have it in a box on my nightstand sitting JUNK!!! DO NOT BUY!!
1.0,"Zoomies is a complete disaster.  Should be a law about selling products that are total fraud as nothing is like they claim.  These are total GARBAGE and a Real Joke.  They don't work for hobbies or reading newspaper at all.  They have to be fully extended to even see anything at all.  They are not even worth the cost of making them.  No company should even think about selling them.  Fox News did a test on them at a ballgame, and like they are in their Hall of Shame, as they are what they are....pure and simple...misleading trash that should have been thrown out before it was even made.  Don't believe me go to [...]"
1.0,"the pants are of very poor quality (sowing, material) also they are very big in the hips"
1.0,"I really liked the look of this product  & thought the concept design was a really good one. Unfortunately  the look and the function don't end up being that compatible. The small triangular piece of plastic that the carabiner  clip is attached to breaks easily ( mine broke within a day out of the package) The whole thing became useless as the plastic triangle is thin, rigid  &#60;& sharp when broken&#62;. I ordered a<br />Carson Stuff-It Microfiber Lens Cloth as a gift for a friend recently & after seeing it, I'm going to order one for myself to replace this item as it is cheaper & I think it will last longer (plus it's easier to open & close) This product managed to break inside a mostly empty quilted purse in one day when I went out to the library & back...it broke before I even got a chance to use it, so I call that  &#34;fail&#34;"
1.0,"I don’t know what this creator thinks he is selling, but it sure isn’t a Leonardo DiCaprio face mask. It’s some blurry, pixelated, zoomed in travesty. And, it arrived two days after Amazon said it arrived. Don’t buy this product."
1.0,"The watch did not work at all, right out of the box. It was a birthday gift. Disappointed."
1.0,I won’t call it large<br /><br />Even few bucks that I tried to fit in were stuck out
1.0,Pretty dress but it has no zipper. It has a ribbon to tie up dress but it’s way to big and has so much padding in wrong places
1.0,"I have bought these 4 times, 3 from Amazon and once from the company. I have severe asthma and bought them because they had absolutely no smell unlike others. Then the company ran out. Months later they had them on their site so I ordered some. They came and were not individually wrapped and had a chemical smell. I had to throw them away. They came back on Amazon, ordered and no problem. Ordered more in Feb 2023. Glad I opened a couple right away, Horrible chemical smell causing my lips to swell. After all the negative reviews the first time they pulled a switch why would they do it again? Done with Ifly if they can't be trusted."
1.0,Some what small shorter then I would have likes but worked for 1 pic
1.0,Too big and thin
1.0,Cheap looking. Sent it back
1.0,Junk. Dont buy.
1.0,You never know what you’re getting when you order something like this off the Internet.  This is a great disappointment…..!!
1.0,Do NOT buy this! It looks like a bed sheet that has been sewn straight up the side to create one sleeve. It’s very sheer and you can see through it. Very poorly made. Does not look any where as nice as the photo displayed.
1.0,Size not accurate according to the size chart! ☹
1.0,Cheaply made.  Bad fabric.  Returned...
1.0,"Very disappointed that I bought this a size bigger, and it still does not fit"
1.0,it broke on the first day. Totally sucks
1.0,you can see right through them
1.0,"The backs are so tiny you can't even hold on them to screw them on.  The threading is too short so you can't get the backs on enough. And.....the post is too long, the earrings don't rest up against your ear.  Too bad too cause they are gorgeous."
1.0,Tarnished within a month. I threw them away. I would not recommend.
1.0,These were straight jeans. They are not flares. I sent them back.
1.0,"Such poor quality! Wire does not fit over locking wire, Much smaller than the picture. The only good thing about them is the color. Too bad."
1.0,Was supposed to be antique brass.  Was silver instead.
1.0,Zippers are very poor quality
1.0,I usually wear medium but these mediums were too small and after the first wash they started to have holes and tears.
1.0,It turned on me I should be able to get my money back 😭
1.0,The band on this frayed after one wear. Second time the band popped off and continues to do so.
1.0,Made with Very low quality. Not what I was expecting to get in the mail. Wouldn't buy again sorry !
1.0,"Item says dry fit, the shirts that arrived isnt. SMH!"
1.0,"Ordered 3 blue and white tie dye style as gifts, received pink and red rose style, not even an option in the choice of color, not sure who packed the items and where they got that pattern from, material is thin and cheap stitching,"
1.0,Broken right out of the package. Nice color. Functionality is a zero.
1.0,I ordered this bag because I needed something to carry my laptop. The shoulder strap is already broken (the metal brackets that connect it to the bag no longer close). All I put in this bag is my laptop and a small notebook (which it is designed to carry). I very much like the design of this bag but was very upset by the lack of functionality. If I hadn't already thrown away the box I would definitely return it
1.0,These pants feel as cheap as you would expect a $20 pair of polyester pants to feel. Kind of like a plastic bag.
1.0,my wife were a large and it would not fit her.. very badly missed sized.
1.0,Did not bring all the items
1.0,Esta bandana no sirve y no trae instrucciones de la manera correcta de ponersela
1.0,It looked nothing like the photo. Cheaply made and obvious.
1.0,"Purchased one pair with the back out and those were fine, but then purchased the green pair and the whole sole came apart, so I said hey maybe that was a faulty pair so ordered another pair of the same green ones and the sole came off AGAIN! Better off buying more expensive elsewhere if they’re gonna last long because these haven’t"
1.0,It's $1.99 for a reason. I don't know what I was thinking. I'd find the same thing in a 50 cent trinket machine in front of Walmart.
1.0,I got a refund. There was no way to fasten it. It was very pretty but it was either missing a clasp or was designed poorly. I was very disappointed because I really wanted to wear it!
1.0,Waste of my money!!!
1.0,Very small. Not correct in size plus looks & feels homemade. I’m usually a small & I bought a medium. I should’ve bought a Xtra large to fit my usual size 4 skirts. No tags. Nothing. Don’t buy!
1.0,No help from Bayleaf with problem
1.0,"did not fit well, too big and slid off my feet"
1.0,"Cheaply made, horrible product!! Don’t waste your money!"
1.0,I LITERALLY just opened the package and put this nose ring in about 5 hours ago and all it just broke and fell out while I was spinning it. Not very happy about this
1.0,Too loose from the shoulder
1.0,"Horrible heavy, hard doesn't seal<br />Save your money"
1.0,"ordered small since I have a 33 &#34; waist. but these are too long, and the length has very little compression or tightness. the  waist band is the only thing i feel that , and i have to pull it up over my stomach"
1.0,Poor quality strap broke I will not buy again
1.0,I really wanted to like this. However the material is so cheap and it wrinkles and I can’t even get them out after washing them a couple times and ironing.
1.0,"This mask is not black. It's a very very light grey, almost white. Not as advertised."
1.0,"I am sorry to say that, but these glasses suck. The sun guards are mad out of cheap material. Feel apart 2 days after they arrived. Not something I will buy again."
1.0,Beautiful when I received it but it tarnished and broke already. Wouldn’t recommend buying it
1.0,"Very cheaply made, the band wouldn't even adjust small enough for my wrist and the plastic piece to hold it in place is quite flimsy and I could foresee it breaking easily.  Was a quick return!"
1.0,Useless... unless you like ankle torture.
1.0,"If you're in a dish pit like me, better to spend more on higher quality rubber-like fabric to actually not leak through onto the outfit underneath.  Lesson learned, I get what I pay for."
1.0,Large and sloppy.  Irregularly cut.
1.0,I haven’t even been wearing one of these bands  two days and it has already started breaking a part. They’re poorly made. I wouldn’t recommend them.
1.0,These are entirely too short for a nipple piercing.
1.0,"This is not a Sweatshirt, its polyester."
1.0,Poorly made. The bra cups are flimsy and provide minimal support.
1.0,"Are they serious?  This is marketed as a Spirit airlines bag -- then when it arrives, there's a label that says &#34;Not for Spirit airlines&#34;.<br />Dimensions are listed as 17x13x9 -- which exceeds Spirit's 16x14x12 limits.  What the ...?"
1.0,"Big hole in one of the socks. Puts into question whether it has been used, or if they review their product quality before shipping it out. For how much we have to pay for it I expect a sock without a hole in it...rather just go to CVS and get a pair."
1.0,"These are undersized at least 2 sizes, probably more."
1.0,Soooo tiny! Returned immediately
1.0,[[VIDEOID:126a83d096221341126f303f5e8c54f1]] Poorly made. I wore it one time and the handle came off. Guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,"I am amazed to received this product in a terrible plastic package, both package and leggings inside got melted together."
1.0,"Sorry, these didn’t work for me."
1.0,This was nothing like the description said. I read the reviews and was very disappointed when I got the product. This is like seeing the posts don’t buy prom dresses online pics.
1.0,"It was great the first two times I wore it - and then the pom came off with no way of fixing it. Not worth the price, it's obviously very cheaply made."
1.0,They slip off my feet at every step. I tried to tighten them but that made no difference. Terrible return also. Have to take them to UPS store. No label to print out at home. Could they make it any more inconvenient to return them? I found a way to reverse that return. Started over and clicked on different things and I was able to print out a return label--thank goodness. Made it a lot easier. Good old USPS!
1.0,"This product was labeled 2X and was basically a men’s medium.  My husband is an athletic XL.  He couldn’t even get it on.  Nice idea, but not made to American sizing."
1.0,Perhaps this dress is only good for a super skinny individual.  It just did not look good on me and it was immediately returned.
1.0,Had to return too small I got. I walked out
1.0,"Pictures are deceiving, Material seems cheap but when my daughter can fit in it I'm going to test it out anyway and it comes big for the size. I purchased a 18-24months and have had it a couple months now and my daughter does not fit in it yet as its that big hope she can fit in it for summer 2021. Mind she wears a 3t in all other clothes now that I buy her and when I purchased this she was a 2t."
1.0,"This was a joke, the neck hole was so small I couldn't even get my head through it."
1.0,Too small. The soles are thin (card board). Not enough room to slide my foot in. SMH
1.0,Can was not at all like picture  just leather not leather and suede like picture
1.0,"I had decided that I wanted to update my winter coat.  Unfortunately, my favorite stores don't carry coats in the style / patterns that I like, so I thought that I would try Amazon (having had good success in the past).  I ordered the largest size available (3x), which should have fit just fine.  It took longer than usual, but I didn't have a problem with that.<br /><br />It arrived.  I put it on.  Sorry - delete that.  I TRIED to put it on.  Over a thin t-shirt.  Managed to get one arm in, the other half in, and I looked like a scarecrow that was overstuffed.  I think that someone who normally wears a 'large' may find it uncomfortable.  Especially if they're wearing winter clothing.<br /><br />Which leads me to the second problem - the 'lining' isn't really lining.  It is straight up faux fur - just with pretty colors on the weave side.  It is literally ONE LAYER THICK.  It might be great as a cold weather coat closer to the equator, but NOT for mid-west American winters.<br /><br />Final note - am I returning it?  No, I'm not.  I still love its look, and I love practicing upsizing items.  And, I want to teach myself how to add a lining.  So I'm keeping it and I'm going to play with it.  I can't say what the customer service is going to be like because I'm not even trying to send it back."
1.0,"The fit is a little snug so I would say this product runs small. HOWEVER- it is 100% see through. The white ""slip"" underneath shows everything. Not to mention that the slip does not even cover any of my lady business!  I am 5'4"" and about 135-140lbs, so fairly average, but the length is a joke! Absolutely no bending over. You can still see everything standing stick straight! I would have loved this dress for my bridal shower this weekend as it seemed perfect.. but I am not into peep shows :(. Don't buy."
1.0,"this bag is a old bag old old i don,t know how they can cell a bag to a costumer like that very old bag sorry i can,t never by nothing more by this seller"
1.0,"My son used these for lite practices for a few weeks. But once football practice started, the sole ripped away from the shoe after a week. Pitiful."
1.0,Very cheap quality not worth the money
1.0,"Was about to wrap these  on Valentine's Day, only to open the box and find black and brown tarnished earrings instead of sparkly silver ones. So I guess I have to run out and replace these on such a busy day! What a waste of my time!"
1.0,Three days. Exactly how long this lasted. Three days then total disappointment for my daughter. Chain is very cheap (not that I expected much for the price) but I would have thought a little longer than three days.
1.0,Very disappointed in the fit.
1.0,"Disappointed! Color of the dress is off, it did not include the tie around the waist, and overall hideous. The dress pictured had vertical wrinkles, the dress I received is more like squares. Not worth it!"
1.0,This band broken the second day. I watched my son take it off and he was not rough with it. Cheaply made.
1.0,It wasn't stretchy enough
1.0,"Product is a pain to get on and off. It doesn't match the size chart, runs small."
1.0,Cheap chain and metal
1.0,Extremely see through. Horrible stitching. The bottom part of the zipper came off before I even tried it on. They sent me a small instead of a medium. The graphics were off. Not worth the money at all.
1.0,"[[ASIN:B01F1TXB3C Copi Women's Simple Design Fashion Backpacks College bags Wine]]<br />I really like it, but the product I received was poorly made. I will be returning the product. I expected better due to price."
1.0,A lot smaller when you receive them then but they appear online !!!
1.0,Dress arrived without a box or an envelope to protect the dress. The dress arrived in a plastic bag with holes on it. The dress looked used.. All wrinkles with dirt smell. I didn't even want to try it on. Returning the dress.
1.0,Not what was picture quality was lacking
1.0,Fall out very easily
1.0,"It had a horrible smell, sent the product back."
1.0,The locket was returned because it wouldn't close.  Very disappointed.
1.0,"The item was way too small, arms were for a small person. I usually wear a large (loosely) order XL. It was a Prime order with “FREE” return HOWEVER the label and instructions say you have to PAY FOR RETURN."
1.0,horrible doesnt work a total scam
1.0,Not good quality<br />Strings from sewing are coming loose not even wore it for a week
1.0,When I received this item it was broken in half.
1.0,"This is the worst thing I ever bought. IT has stain on the inside . Yes it's cheap, but it shouldn't be like this."
1.0,The watch is nice looking however the hour hand doesn't stay where you set it.  It just spins around.
1.0,Slow shipping...very uncomfortable and huge
1.0,Too short and I’m only 5’6
1.0,The item I received was missing the key chain I pay for a bracelet and key chain set .
1.0,This piece is nothing like what's on the picture
1.0,Didn’t love the material. Not flowy at all. Looks like baby doll clothes. Will be returning
1.0,"I cannot wear acrylic, wool, mohair, angora or cashmere - it makes me itch uncontrollably. Because of that, I'm very careful to always check fabric content when purchasing clothes, especially sweaters. I was excited that this sweater was supposedly Polyester & Rayon. Recieved it today in the mail and I knew just looking at it, it was acrylic. Looked at the tag and yup, 100% Acrylic. Didn't even try it on - packed it up for return immediately! I wish there was more honestly in advertising on Amazon. Complete waste of my time to order something only to find out it was not as portrayed online. Big disappointment."
1.0,Material is horrible!!! Poor quality!
1.0,"Was too loose in the bust and shoulders, and way too tight at the waist. Fitted me more like a midi than an a-line which doesnt work with a pear body shape. The material is nice, the color is good. Just not for my body type. :("
1.0,Venía con una cortadura
1.0,I’m 5’6 and the pants were flooding on me unlike how in the picture they had xtra material at the bottom/ more of a stacked look. It also wasn’t fitted like the pictures either I had to return it.
1.0,It tarnished after a few uses. Complete crap. Cheap material
1.0,not comfortable around the waist.
1.0,"This wallet stinks so bad I might have to throw it out. It's not worth the hassle of a return.<br />UPDATE: Ended up returning it, Amazon made that super easy. Will never buy from Yaluxe again though."
1.0,Es un fraude total...es un plastic con un baño dorado.. no puedo creer que vendan esto como Oro
1.0,"A little too long for those under 5'4"". Nice dress"
1.0,"Zipper broke already , replace, Pleez. ?????<br /><br />Zipper broke within a week !!!"
1.0,"This outfit appeared cute online but when it arrived, there were several black stains along the hem of the white shirt???? I was able to scrub them out, but where is the quality control before an item is packaged?"
1.0,Fell apart and was ruined after one wash. Had to throw it away.
1.0,Way too small and very see through. Size up
1.0,They are way to big . I’m making them into Christmas tree Ornaments .
1.0,This tee looked very cute on the photo but the tie dye is printed on the t-shirt not really tie dye. This was unfortunately a return.
1.0,Fell apart. Pins fell out. Missing parts. Horrible.
1.0,"Looks better online. Has fabric lace, not all of it is chain."
1.0,"Shirt is VERY VERY short, cut VERY small and VERY see through"
1.0,Definitely fake. Not even clear quartz. Why you people by this? At least Google some Herkimer dimond picture on Internet... you guys will see the different...
1.0,"Piece came over broken, pretty but unable to use it"
1.0,I bought this outfit for use after my surgery. It is see though. Not great quality material. I sent it back.
1.0,The Xlarge would fit a 5 yr old.  Very cheap fabric.
1.0,shape is awful and I can wear ANY sunglasses and they always look good but these are awful and the lenses seemed to make me dizzy after. I wanted to return them but never received a reply.. so anyone who wants them can have them
1.0,"I have no idea what five year old would ever fit this. The leg holes are massive! She wears a 120 in all the Chinese clothes, so this must just be very poorly designed. The crotch snaps are awful. There is extra material after the end snaps that just sort of flop around. Definitely returning this. Don't waste your money.  I have attached photos and had my daughter wear white shirts contrast."
1.0,"It's very easy to break and crack.  Its make your phone looks fake, fat and ugly.  Couple weeks after put it on, it scratched and the corners cracked.  It a waiste of buying it."
1.0,"The straps are WAY too short. The bra would fit better with different straps though, so I may look into that, but even after adjusting it, they were too short. My arms barely fit in them, and I'm a relatively average sized girl."
1.0,The arms on the glasses were stretched and out of shape. These were obviously returned by someone else.
1.0,If I could give this 0 stars I would. Every single one of these watches have dead batteries. I bought one and it didn't work.. Probably the battery so I contacted them and they want me to send it back and they will send a replacement. The replacement comes and that also DOESNT Work!! They want me to ship that back to. So sick of this company. I wish they would be upfront & tell people that it's a really nice looking watch but you will have to try to pry it open and see what kind of battery it needs and then try to find one and it will probably cost more than the watch. Very disappointed
1.0,Trashie look is what you will get with this. They are nothing but leggings.
1.0,It's not like the picture fits like a shirt I wanted it to like like the picture
1.0,"I needed a facemask that was UV proof. When I used my UV meter on this mask, the fabric did not adequately stop the UVA/UVB penetration. It also did not provide sufficient coverage. The way the two sides were stitched together did not allow for a good fit on my head. Wearing a bike helmet plus cycling glasses over it, did not work for enough coverage from the sun. I had to return. I ended up buying the balaclava from Fishmask, instead."
1.0,"The only thing funnier than this bra is seeing a well endowed woman try to get it on!!  I'm a 36DD and talk about NO SUPPORT. As said in many reviews, this is for small breasted ladies. If you don't have a C or below, not for you. Decent price for the entertainment."
1.0,"The jersey actually looks really good,  but only after 2 times on the trail and 2 washes, the threading is starting to come out.  I thought it was just a fluke after the first wash,  but after the second, more threads have started to come out.  I would not recommend this Jersey."
1.0,***UPDATE***<br />I have now worn these for 3 hours and the inner thigh area has ripped and ran!!!!!!  WTH!!!!!!  DONT GET THESE LADIES ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A BOARDERLINE size 10 even!!!!!<br /><br />I am 5'6 and about 158# and have a booty. These leggings did wonders in my tummy area BUT if you have a botty they are a TAD snug.  :) nothing to deter me from wearing them tho!!!  Good enough product and for the $$$ totally worth it :)
1.0,I though for $5 I’d give it a try.  The hat is way too big for my head but it is also too shallow so it just balances on the top of my head.  I can’t be bothered to return it but I won’t be wearing it either.
1.0,One wash and shurnk 2 sizes
1.0,I really don't like this at all. Too tight and looks awful on me. Tried to re gift and they hated also. It is maybe made to fit a Barbie doll.
1.0,Not the same color as shown. I received mine and it’s multi colored mirror green blue and red.
1.0,Terrible sunglasses-made for kids maybe?
1.0,These pants are much smaller than advertised. Don't buy.
1.0,Really hard to put in and take out
1.0,"I was so excited to get these leggings, at first glance they looked perfect. However then I noticed they were completely covered in lint and holes all over. It actually looks like a mouse ate through these leggings all over. Either these are a defective pair or I got someone else’s returned/used pair. While they don’t have a lot of compression these would have been perfect for barre class. But I’m absolutely returning them, such a shame."
1.0,The shirt looked and fit great but I only got to wear it once.  After washing the first time the seam under the arms tore off and now it is useless.<br />Other Coofandy shirts have been of good quality but this one certainly has manufacturing problems.  Considering not buying Coofandy going forward :(
1.0,"Total disappointment and unable to use. I want a lot of Disney shirts for my Disney trip. Pinocchio was the one shirt that I really wanted the most, I was very disappointed"
1.0,This finally arrived but the chain broke third time I got to wear it garbage just like the other stuff that came showed up if it showed up was damaged broken waste of time and money
1.0,"Not even close to what is shown in the picture. Very cheaply made.  I am 5'1&#34;, and 125 lbs, and it fits me like a sweater, and not even a big sweater. Not worth the money spent."
1.0,"WAY TO SMALL, ordered 6Xl and the size was more like a 3xl. returning!"
1.0,"Ordered this winter jacket for my 15 year old son.  He loved it.  He wore it like 4 times and it ended up falling apart!  Seem split on the right middle, left pocket zipper broke and ripped, and another rip by the right front pocket.  He didn't do anything over or beyond normal use.  Very disappointed."
1.0,This is nut comfortable
1.0,Returned it had purchased for my mom
1.0,Too large. Ordered for a medium sized shirt.  Received a large one
1.0,"Terrible fit, quality poor!!"
1.0,Doesn’t move with your body.
1.0,Highly disappointed! Arrived torn at the seam. Also did not arrive like a gift box.
1.0,Measured myself and ordered according to chart . Way too small fit my 13yo son
1.0,"The sizing on this romper is terrible. My son currently wears 9 months so I bought a 12-18 months to be sure it fit for a while.  The body of it is very wide and the length it very short...it looks like he is wearing capris. Also, the snaps in the crotch keep coming undone.  It really is the most ill fitting item I’ve ever bought for my son."
1.0,immediately fell apart
1.0,Product quality was ok but watch was too big for my wrist. Was told I could return it but only at my own to vendor in China. Watch cost $26; not worth returning if I had to pay shipping costs to China. Will never do again. Lesson learned.
1.0,Broke within months! Not durable.
1.0,What a big disappointment these earrings are. They look hand painted & they're way oversized. More gaudy than feminine.
1.0,"Sent me a 6x instead of a medium. Can't wear it, can't find anyone who can. Wish I could great color, nice garmet!!!"
1.0,Not sure if these are authentic. I own a different pair of polarized designer sunglasses which I bought at a brick and mortar store and they are much nicer and &#34;crisper&#34; than these.
1.0,RETURNED!
1.0,These pants run extremely small. Not a good quality of material. Style nothing like photo. Sending them back.
1.0,Zipper broken. Not the quality I was expecting
1.0,"Got the wrong size, not 100% cotton."
1.0,This was 2xl for KIDS!!
1.0,Weird white underneath.
1.0,earring was quite small
1.0,I got 3 men's bullko belts for my boyfriend. He loves the other 2 because it feels like real leather but this one is very hard and does not feel like leather. Very disappointed  in this one .
1.0,Came as can xxlg but would fit a medium.
1.0,"It was so pretty and I was so excited to wear it till it broke. It was on my neck and I was adjusting it then one part snapped! When my friend tried to fix it, it was in a huge not and another part was broken. It literally fell apart 2 hours after me wearing it!"
1.0,WAY too big
1.0,Ran extremly small
1.0,No where near the right size. I had to give a star rating.
1.0,"The material used for the pants is paper thin and see through. The shirt is thin and rough feeling, doesn't seem like it would be comfortable!!!!"
1.0,I purchased this some time ago and just got around to trying it on and everything is great except I’m missing the G belt. Would be happy to leave 5 stars if I can receive the belt? Kind of kills the whole outfit with it missing.
1.0,The water got through
1.0,"These reviews are completely unrelated to the product, which is a bra. It's disappointing because I needed some insight on the bra before I can make a purchase."
1.0,"Very poorly crocheted, looked very not stylish like I was going to church. Not for bigger busts"
1.0,They run tiny as hell. I got a medium and I can't even get them past my knees.
1.0,Lace was scratchy
1.0,"Good size, pretty, but unfortunately came broken in the bag. The loop where the hook connects to was broken and the elephant was loose at the bottom of the plastic bag."
1.0,Don't stay buckled.  I installed them on a very expensive Gucci dog collar after the original buckle wore out... The collar was lost in a day.
1.0,This order was supposed to have 3 bonnets in the order …..My order ONLY CAME WITH 2.<br />I would like the third bonnet.
1.0,Much larger than the picture. I do not like them whatsoever.
1.0,If you need it for a quick and crappy “cosplay” I guess this could work but for wanting an actual product that looks like what’s on the show AND what’s used as the image on the product page  look elsewhere.
1.0,I bought this item 3 sizes bigger because it says it runs small and it still didn't fit! Very disappointed
1.0,"It's a beautiful rain suit, it's lined and the colour vibrant. My complaint with this is that I ordered the size 120 which is for ages 4-5 year olds. My daughter is 3.5 years and 38.5 inches tall. The pants were way too short for her. I'm returning for this reason. I was hoping she could get a few seasons wear out of this suit."
1.0,"Very cheap looking shirt nothing like the picture. I can not even wear it outside, I'm donating it to good will."
1.0,Runs larger than expected extremely short in length and in 5'5 not as good quality as others on site. Will be returning
1.0,"Thin, poor quality. Does not fit as expected. Returning for refund."
1.0,This did not come at all how it was picture. Awful
1.0,Already tarnished
1.0,I regret buying them. When I opened them and attempted to put one on it broke. I was very disappointed.
1.0,"I read the reviews and noticed a common trend were people reported the zipper broke.  I bought it anyway.  Well, the zipper broke after about four uses. I will not second guess my fellow reviewers in the future......."
1.0,One of the clips was broken when it arrived we weren’t able to use at all
1.0,I hate this. Looks nothing like the pictures. Fits nothing like the picture. The material is super uncomfortable. It looks like a night gown but a bad one.
1.0,This “packable” hat crushed when l bought it for vacation. It was wrinkled and misshapen and l couldn’t get it to straighten out. I sent it back.
1.0,Earrings came with a different size backing on each earring. One was too loose and the earring was lost the same day. :(
1.0,"The product itself is nice, just the size is way too small. Not able to put it on..."
1.0,"Not stretchy, Im slim/athletic built only 5'4&#34; and could barely get them to my knees. Do not look as pictured either, quality is poor."
1.0,"These are by far the worst Labrets I've ever bought. The fit of the jewelry into the post is so loose, they don't stay together when you smile. I was able to make it  work by crimping the end a bit with a pair of nail clippers. Also, the cz is just glued on and I've lost one out of its setting already. the base of the plastic back is quite sharp on the edges, and irritated the inside of my lip as well. Do not recommend to anyone."
1.0,"You get what you pay for .Colors are not bright. Quality is bad. Not satisfied with purchase, I don't recommend. (Pictures attached are with and without flash.)"
1.0,The colors are super bright and the hoodie doesn't look anything like what's in the picture. It's like I ordered it from Wish.
1.0,The pants is ridiculous long and the sweater’s zipper was broken when I received it so I can’t even zip it up. The only nice thing about it is the color
1.0,"Compre los dos llaveros porque me parecieron muy apropiados para regalar a dos amigos de mi esposo, estos llaveros debieron haber llegado cada uno en su caja, pero no, llegaron en una envoltura de acetato, muy mala presentación, así que tuve que buscar un sitio especializado en empaques para mejorar su aspecto. Respecto a la durabilidad, me reservo la respuesta, eso lo tendrán que decir quienes van a recibir el regalo. Me pareció buen regalo como un detalle por la presentación que visualice en la pagina, pero así como llegó NO."
1.0,Its cute but i followed the size review and the xl fits like a medium. The top had almost no coverage for my 36 Ds. And the bottoms fit weird small on the waist to big on the cheeks. I have a small butt but this was ridiculous.
1.0,Its been two months since i bought thses shoes abd the whole shoe is falling apart.  My daughter only wears them once every two weeks.  Dont buy!
1.0,LED lights stopped working after 3 weeks.
1.0,Absolutely horrible product it broke the clasp and extending rings almost immediately after i opened the package way to small as necklace in fact i couldnt even get it on my wrist as a bracelet. Will never purchase from the seller again completely dissatisfied with the whole item only good things was wrapped properly and shipping was really fast
1.0,Fabric was dull and pilled after ONE wash. Don’t buy.
1.0,These are transparently thin and once you put one on they’ll slowly get all sloppy and fall off your face do to weak material gets stretched out and doesn’t contract back to its original size. Disappointing.
1.0,"Not happy with this product, the quality is not as showed in the picture. I don’t recommend this product for kids that have to be full time in school and carry lots of stuff. The quality is very fragile and cheap. I prefer spending a bit more money for a better quality."
1.0,It broke less than 1 week. I was sliding them on my face and the screw fell off
1.0,Gloves ripped after first use where the kevlar palm meets the neoprene! The Neoprene must've been old or something. I contacted riffe and they replaced it immediately. Haven't had any problems with the new ones
1.0,"I loved this bracelet I gave my husband for Christmas. The first item was defective and I sent back. It was replaced in January and we were very happy. Now is only May and it already broke. For an item this expensive, this is very bad quality. My return window has closed. Nothing I can do at this point other than to put it in the garbage."
1.0,Very unhappy received today. And there's no flower it's missing very unhappy
1.0,"Product is horrible. It's not the same material as advertised, not the same style. I honestly believe that this person just grabbed a picture off the Internet to sell what they didn't want"
1.0,Cut is wrong. Super tight on thighs and huge in hips. Sending this back. Extremely disappointed
1.0,I'm returning this purse due to the cheap quality of the material. It has a great shape and design but the material used ton this looks and feels like sticky thin plastic
1.0,The were broken. I'd like to return them.
1.0,"much larger than expected, too big for any of my fingers. Plus i thought it was a simpler design, wish they didnt have that stupid skull? at the base."
1.0,I had these slippers less than 2 months and they ripped at the seam. That's pretty bad for $63 slippers. I don't see how these slippers have memory foam. They don't seem to have any cushion. I'm pretty disappointed.
1.0,I was not impressed with the quality of these shoulder pads and they are a lot smaller than I anticipated.  Will not buy these again.
1.0,Never wear them... the bridge of the nose is the ONLY bad part though. The rest are decent quality!! The nose looks awful though!
1.0,"If I could, I would give this product 0 Stars. It looked like someone tried to make a shirt out of a really ugly patterned muumuu. It was cut awkwardly, the material was garbage, it looks nothing like the picture. But I guess that's what I should expect for the price I paid. Save your money and don't even bother buying this garbage."
1.0,Just don’t.
1.0,GARBAGE - I bought one of these about five years ago and it is an excellent product - bought this one for my son - JUNK - JUNK - JUNK - not even remotely close anymore as quality goes - they are having it made over seas now and it truly is GARBAGE
1.0,Not that hot
1.0,"Just received this shirt and it is UGLY and NOT the shirt I ordered. I ordered the black shirt and the picture shows one white and one dark blue stripe on the shoulder and pocket. The shirt I received has light blue, dark blue and a brown stripe like the blue shirt shoes, except it's like the 70's gone bad colors. Really dissappointed. The fit isn't bad, I'm 5'10 and wear a 16-18 in tops carrying a bulk of my weight in my stomach and the XxL fits well. Not sure if I'm willing to try a different color or not based off how far off this color was."
1.0,it broke within a week. I was pretty disappointed.
1.0,Enough said!
1.0,"Very bad quality, i didn't use it cuz it's too bad to be used"
1.0,I am a small and ordered a large based on reviews. Could NOT even zip it. Returning. Pockets are also very small. Maybe for keys or a small phone. I could not get a water bottle<br />In.
1.0,did not look like picture
1.0,"I ordered this originally in navy blue; loved it. I ordered a second one in grey. The material was completely different. Original one was cotton, this one was like polyester or something. Hate, hate, hate it. It clung in all the wrong places. Was not flattering or comfortable."
1.0,"I bought these for my husband for vacation. Very disappointed, they barely hit the top of his pants. I now wear them to sleep in"
1.0,Not real copper. After one day of wearing it took on that dirty tarnished look.
1.0,Did not fit as expected. Way too small!
1.0,"Very fast shipping, BUT I am very disappointed that the post & stud are clearly 2 different colors! The post is bright gold & stud is rose gold."
1.0,The sizea are totally inaccurate. Any company that misrepresents sizes of items can't be trusted.
1.0,The fabric is too thick.
1.0,They fall off my face and can't be worn on the top of my head when I don't need them. I say &#34;boo&#34; to these sunglasses.
1.0,They looked great upon arrival. They shrunk 50+% upon washing. A rip-off.
1.0,Items weren't as described . Fit snug
1.0,"This is my second time ordering this set of glasses, and they did not come in as before. No spring loaded arms, smaller, and cheaper. DO NOT order these."
1.0,"I think I was expecting more of a cotton or polyester top, this was just totally bizarre.  I am not sure I can fully lift my arms in the dress, I might still wear it to a party as a joke but I would promptly change."
1.0,We CANNOT figure out how to get this to work!! How is it suppose to heat  up??
1.0,Size chart is completely wrong
1.0,Bracelet turned black and beads faded & turned white
1.0,"Battery life is highly exaggerated.<br />I fully charged the batteries. I let them preheat for 10 minutes before switching to medium. The temperature outside was 36ºF/2.2ºC, no wind. The gloves did keep my hands warm while cycling till the glove's shutoff at 2 hours 15 minutes. This is a far cry from the highly exaggerated 6 hours the seller proclaims when on the medium setting. I knew already from experiences with stated battery lives that they would not last. I highly doubt this is a 5000mah battery. This is my second pair of gloves this season. These Chinese companies need to be truthful in their descriptions.<br />Update: When I purchased these gloves, I also purchased the Anker PowerCore 10,000mah batteries as suggested by another user. I fully charged the Anker batteries and used them with the gloves under the same conditions as above. The Anker batteries lasted 4 hours. Here is the URL for the Anker batteries on Amazon. I have been using Anker batteries for a few years in various sizes, and they perform as expected.<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0194WDVHI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br />22 Dec 21<br />I only have one working glove now. I've worn these maybe 10 times. The gloves were working fine a couple of weeks ago. This morning, the right glove would power on, then shut off a couple of minutes later. Very disappointed in the poor longevity of these gloves. These Chinese sellers should be kicked off of this site. They do not honor their warranties."
1.0,"This top is irregularly sized. I ordered size large. Tag says large and large sticker on top. I could only get one arm in the whole top, that’s how small the top is. This top size large comfortably fits a three year old toddler. The top DOES NOT fit and nor does it look like the picture. Very cheap material!!!! The one star was only for the purposes of leaving this disappointing comment!!!! DO NOT PURCHASE. SUPPLIER MISREPRESENTED this product!!! Size listed by seller are inaccurate."
1.0,Bought cause the pic looks nice but they cost me $80 in shipping for a pair of gloves that cost $1.99
1.0,The top of this dress is almost purple and the bottom has the pretty blue shown in the picture. The stitching was also very loose/cheap looking. Returned!
1.0,very small and cheap looking the battery died a month later
1.0,"No shape, complete square and short as well."
1.0,Love the look but the link is very fragile  ..
1.0,"Way too small, never worn."
1.0,Ripped in the side and the back while wearing it for the first time.  Extremely fragile seams.  I would return it but I had to get rid of it that day.
1.0,This product is the complete opposite of what the picture looks like.  I ordered a 3xl it came in a med at the best quality is poor. You get what you pay for...... never again.
1.0,"Very disappointed, the bag that came looks nothing like what is pictured. Much smaller than I thought as well as not structured as appears in the picture."
1.0,Does not glow in the dark
1.0,Color fades quickly
1.0,"Very cute earrings. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to use them because the gage of the little stick is too large for a standard ear piercing. Disappointing."
1.0,I only used this a few times and it broke! Not worth it!
1.0,Looks absolutely nothing like the picture. The fabric was completely different than what the picture looks like. I ordered and extra large and it barely fit. I don’t see how it would’ve been able to be off the shoulder either. Very disappointing.
1.0,"This bra was bought for a 34 E/DDD. The tag on the bra stated it was the size that was purchased, however  it barely fit. It was too tight, even using the first hooks, and it dug in and caused excessive bulging and breast spillage. NOT the way any bra is supposed to fit. This bra was purchased for a drama production in which there will be dancing, and absolutely will not work for that purpose."
1.0,"I wasn't expecting alot considering the price but even $20 is too much. Very cheaply made, I got caught up in the net lining that hung out of sleeves! On top of it the hood was sewn together. See picture.  Not recommended unless you are using<br />it as a cheap, I don't care how I look/never going out in public, kind of jacket."
1.0,There were 4 sets of earrings in my order. One set looks completely different. The colors are different and the weave is different.  The only thing that is the same is the shape!  Of course the round ones were my favorite shaped earring! Two there pairs need one of the earrings turned around in order to look alike. The backside of one matches the front side of the other earring in the pair. When they were made one was attached backwards!  These are no longer available so I can’t return them for another pair.
1.0,"Item came just thrown in a box!!! There’s no tags, no introductions, and from what I’m reading in the other reviews- the vest STILL won’t heat!!<br /><br />Super frustrating!!<br />There’s not even contact information to the seller!!!"
1.0,arrived early but looks like it was worn.
1.0,"These dresses are so sheer you can see right through them. I ordered the blue and the red. The colors are so vibrant and pretty but I am not Rihanna, I can’t be in the grocery store in a sheer sundress. I returned both dresses."
1.0,Completely see-through and fit is weird. These will go to the thrift store.
1.0,The watchband was very light and therefore I did not like the quality of the watch
1.0,Returned immediately upon its arrival; tarnished and blackened.
1.0,Made extremely cheap and broke the first time I wore the bracelet. I would never purchaseAgain and certainly would  not recommend anyone to purchase it.
1.0,"Horrible quality, holes at the heels in less than an hour of wearing. Stay away."
1.0,"Actual items do not match photograph. What looks like enamel is simply paint. The cuff links I received had most of the red and blue paint rubbed off, so all that can be seen is a white design stenciled on steel.  I would return it if I could but don't have the time to go through the pain of shipping these back."
1.0,They do not stay on the ear. They fall off the sides.
1.0,"DO NOT buy these. Took 3 months to ship to the US and the fit was horrific. I just threw them away to save myself the headache.<br /><br />It's not that they were too small or too bit they just aren't made with human dimensions in mind. I have a fairly slim/average body. 5'8"", 130lbs, I normally wear size 4-6.<br /><br />AND there was no hole for the button above the zipper. I had to create one. Read the reviews that seems to be a common problem.<br /><br />The waist was a tad tight but the strange thing was the crotch. The crotch was short and huge. Like baggy around the crotch in the front, but gave me an immediate wedgie when I sat down. I just don't know what sort of odd body type that's supposed to work for...<br /><br />I guess if you have a tiny waste, and a softball where your crotch should be, and only a 4 inch distance between your belly and your vag, you might wanna give these a try. Otherwise, don't bother."
1.0,I was compressed and needed to close my current account and charge card.  Is it possible to have a refund check?
1.0,"sizing little snug: The removable pads are what ruin this, made too small and stiff that makes your boob look lumpy & wonky"
1.0,The outfit is cute but the first time I washed it (didn't even wear it yet) the hem came apart. I had to go around all the hems and cut the thread.
1.0,"I'm really disappointed. It looked so good in the review, when I got it the top of the lace is all torn up and undone. It's way too small as well."
1.0,Qulaity is good<br />But size is too big<br />Is not small as i gues
1.0,Definitely not squat proof
1.0,Pageant style. Huge and ugly. Will be returning.
1.0,"Fabric not as expected. Very much polyester, not cotton. Will be returning"
1.0,Ordered the black dress with red/pink flowers. Looked NOTHING like the pictures. Dress looked cheap and felt cheap. Colors were not as shown and much brighter than expected. Dress did not have pockets either. Immediately put back in the bag to return.
1.0,This was a disapointment.  Print is pretty but very small.
1.0,"This is not what I expected. Very thin, not comfortable and looks like it will fall apart the second it gets wet or needs to be washed.  I’ll be returning it."
1.0,They are cute but very small. For a infant girl.
1.0,Advertised as adult but barely fits a skinny 10 yr. old
1.0,"disliked the feel of the material and the way it sat on me,"
1.0,Very cheap and linty
1.0,"Sorry I can't give zero stars. My wife initially loved the ring, until it changed her fingers color. I'm both bummed and disappointed. Ring is stamped 925 but clearly not sterling..."
1.0,"It's not an easy task but these pants manage to be both too big and too small at the same time.<br />They are loose around the hips and around the thighs but they are also 1 inch short. I have a size S and I'm 5'6'' 120 lb with larger than average thighs.<br />The material is stretchy but given how loose they are, what good is that? They are soft and comfortable so they would make a nice pair of jammies but nothing more unfortunately. They are well made and good quality so it's a real shame"
1.0,Leaks smoke through the vents.  It won't fully seal when closed
1.0,"Color listed is pink, a peach color arrived. Not as long as in picture either."
1.0,Not good cloth
1.0,Washed once and shrunk from a large to a small. The image was horrible when I got it and is already fading. Waste of money.
1.0,Too small waste  of money
1.0,HORRIBLE! Thin and cheap material. Looks nothing like the picture. Gave a hard time returning blazer. 👎🏻
1.0,The dress is tearing off all around
1.0,This is horribly made and the fabric is bizarre. I wish they’d tell you that the clothes were made in Asia. All of the Amazon clothes I’ve ordered that are made in Asia are horrible.
1.0,Didn't say youth when I bought it. I went to women's sizes and ended up with a kids. Not happy at all. My daughter was very disappointed.
1.0,One word...aweful!<br />Dont buy.
1.0,"I first purchased the matching Spectator backpack from a Tumi store in person, which is about 99% leather.  I ordered this carry-on here to match it bc I love the backpack so much but when I received it, only the white was leather and the rest cloth or textile.  Which is fine, except the primary grey color is a different shade of grey than the backpack.  I'm not sure if it's the difference in material and they couldn't match it better or if this was a defective piece.  I haven't gone back to the store to compare but they don't look like they belong together so I returned it.  As far as size/function, the inside seemed extremely small and wouldn't hold as much as my other carryon of the same size."
1.0,"Sent the item back due to the jacket not being true to size. Needed xxl and the same size jacket was sent back to me, very disappointed customer!!!"
1.0,"Really dissappointing, I was so excited to use this till it came and won't charge at all, so having to return and get elsewhere"
1.0,After wearing for 2 days. The snap broke.  Will return for refund
1.0,runs SUPER small and cheap material!
1.0,I hated the material of the dress
1.0,If I wanted a belly shirt I would have ordered one. This shirt is unflattering and looks like it'd be long because it sure is on the model. It can't be worn with leggings because it shows all the parts modesty would have covered. False advertising and super poorly made. Come on Amazon your better than this..
1.0,"It was really boxy, completely hides my curves, and just ugly. But it has pockets so it gets a whole extra star. 🙂"
1.0,Ordered a 3x it fits like a large. I could not even button it together. This is NOT true to size.
1.0,"it havent a karat engraving on the chain ,and the description says in Quantity comes a pair but i just recieved one :(<br />what a crap!"
1.0,"smells terrible, and very poor quality, I do not like"
1.0,This is NOTa sundress it is a nightgown!
1.0,The diameter of the sunglass lenses are almost 3 inches. They are huge and made people look like fruit flies. Not worth the money and look ridiculous.
1.0,"The clipping part was broken, and  some of the fabric was already coming off before I even got to wear it."
1.0,This is not a dress it is even too small as a shirt
1.0,"I don’t know what you sent me but it wasn’t the dress pictured in the reviews or the stock photos. Horrible material, not a wrap dress, and the measurements given do not compare to the actual dress.<br /><br />I was going to wear this dress on an important date this weekend but looks like I’m back at the drawing board. Thanks for nothing."
1.0,Pretty buckle but broke after 2 weeks.
1.0,Says no ride up but all it does is ride up.
1.0,"Its both too small and too large. The fit is just awkward, it doesnt look good. Stear clear."
1.0,"It looks real cheap in person. I guess it's true, you get what you pay for!"
1.0,"I cannot comment on the rise, the material is nice, but the cit is ridiculously small. As you can see it’s only 13 inches across and 26 inches is not a large!"
1.0,I ordered adult large and they fit like an adult small.
1.0,every single one I bought broke. I bought around 5 different ones. Now they sit in a box waiting for me to buy something from a craft store to fix them.
1.0,Description is misleading
1.0,I purchased these super cheap and only got to wear them once because they turned orange and the chain broke. You get what you paid for....
1.0,"I got a XXL, it is skin tight on someone who wears a medium."
1.0,I'm a size 12/14. I ordered XL and was too small. You would need to go up 2 sizes. Very cheap material. Returning...
1.0,Smaller than expected and broke within first month!
1.0,Horrible fit. Does not fit true to size.
1.0,didn't work useless.......
1.0,horrible!!!
1.0,"Cute but the hens won’t keep it on. And they are very upset with it when you put it on them , but it did seem to frighten the mean hen away , but it just didn’t stay on them and I put it onto three of my hens .also made them so upset no egg for two to three weeks after it was on them"
1.0,"This shirt is awful! It is a rectangle with sleeves. The neck line feels like It is choking you and waist is not long enough. The fabric is cheap, thick t-shirt fabric. It shrunk at least two sizes washed on cold and dried on low. Dont waste your money,  this thing is crap."
1.0,Wrong size.  Completely useless for my need
1.0,Not worth the price. Looks tacky feels tacky. I expected more. Makes me sad because I really splurged by spending that much and now I'm stuck with it.
1.0,There was nothing in the shipping bag just the little cardboard square of the packaging.
1.0,"Too small, faded more than photo appears and feels uncomfortable"
1.0,Muy  pequeña
1.0,Really creepy is all I can say. Didn't really look like her on .... hard to see b/c it smashes your eyes in. Felt like a bank robber in it. The fun thing is no one had a clue who I was!
1.0,"It broke 2 weeks having it , just saw now u can write a review"
1.0,Listen to me! The ring may be pretty but the prongs are about the third of the size of a normal ring. The center stone easily fell out of mine and it can't be bent back into place because the prong is too thin.
1.0,"The quality is not as good as the original &#34;Bumpy Jelly&#34; rings. Though they all worked (but 1) the jelly materal is so very thin it rips, split or break very easily. Also the lites & on/off buttons located insides flips & moves around were it becomes so difficult to turn them off. When you try to turn it around or flip it to reach the button the ring tears or the button comes off of the batteries. Very disappointed! We'll go back to the original bumpy rings which is a bit more durable with less hassle."
1.0,WASTE OF MONEY.
1.0,If I could I would rate this no stars! This belly ring RUSTED while it was still being worn! I've never had this happen to me with any other belly ring!
1.0,Ugh. It is cheaply made. Doesn’t lay correctly.
1.0,This dress was not sewn correctly.
1.0,The insol are lifted from shoe. They are not glued. I can see the separation of the insol and the bottom of the shoe. Very poor craftsmanship
1.0,"CHEAP fabric, pills after 1 or 2 washings.  Disappointed in this product"
1.0,My 4 year old who wears 3t-4t could not wear the 4t-5t.. she’s below average in height and they came to her shins. So bummed bc it’s so cute!!!!
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THESE MASKS. They are paper thin and came in a generic bag with no identification. We all know that to combat omicron we need to be putting our kids in KN95 or the equivalent (KF94). Korea has better standards of manufacturing than China, and the price is always much better…hence why I was specifically looking for KF94 masks for my kids. A proper KF94 will be labeled as such. Not only do you not know how these are made (no package information), they are clearly made in China. Do not buy them. Instead, purchase the Dr. Puri Brand which have been vetted. I’m so disappointed and those who don’t know better could be putting their kids in sub-optimal masks."
1.0,"Sizing is way off. I ordered a medium, which is supposed to be 10-12. The tag said medium (5) and did fit like a 5."
1.0,"Waist and length are good but it's way baggier than the one illustrated on the foto. I look like a 90s rapper. I'm 5'10"" and weigh 185 lbs."
1.0,"Stiff, unflattering material. There is nothing to this dress. It truly is just a long t-shirt that ties up at the bottom. Baggy over the waist and chest. Not worth the pricetag."
1.0,This hurts my feet. Not a soft material as described
1.0,Not for warmth! Very thin and neck line is knitted directly to the front and back panels. Easy to tear. May use for bottom layer of several tops.
1.0,The bracelet I received is clearly not .925 sterling silver. It looks like it's plated. I am very disappointed with this purchase. Sterling silver doesn't fade red when it's dirty
1.0,"This dress is huge and shapeless. It swallows me whole. However, there is no free return. I wish I never bought anything from this company."
1.0,"The dress is cut very small, and it will not look the same is on the website. Unless, you are very small yourself."
1.0,"Can't set the date on the watch, had to spin the dial to set time forward. Only wore the watch for a few weeks and the hands broke and fell inside the glass face."
1.0,Fabric thin.
1.0,Not to good quality
1.0,Muy mala calidad sobre todo la parte de abajo
1.0,Fit was a little wierd. It was way to long and to blousey on top.  then the waist was too tight.  No crazy about the fabric.
1.0,It looks like my three-year-old niece made this. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,"As others have said, this dress is nothing as advertised, odd material, not the same pattern as shown, smelled funny, had stains by each button, and if you have any bust at all you have no chance of wearing this, the top is so small, and I ordered an XL. First order I've ever done that truly disappointed me in every aspect. Inexpensive or not, don't waste the time and effort."
1.0,I thought they would be 100% cotton-but there NOT. Was very unhappy with the socks. I hate them.
1.0,"When connected to the computer for first charge, it never turned on and a Trojan was detected."
1.0,Perfect fit but 100% see through.
1.0,Not at all like the pictures. Super cheap.
1.0,"These were supposed to be fleece lined, thermal and they were so thin and not warm at all. I was cold in 30 degree and they were bought for colder days than that. They were returned."
1.0,Warning this is not an authentic Pandora charm!
1.0,Fell apart after 2 hours of LIGHT wear. Don't bother with this one.
1.0,Worst quality!not worth it. waste of money. Silver color was gone JUST after one time using it!!!
1.0,Says size 10 however didn't fit at all.
1.0,It says these are full framed.  The pair I received are frameless
1.0,"I have returned this purse before due to the letters falling off and now on my new one, they are falling off again!!"
1.0,One is larger than the other.<br />Total waste of money. 😩
1.0,The doll fell apart as soon as I took it out of the envelope.
1.0,"the watch looks great, but it's impossible change the date and they do not have any website for better support the instruction are really small & not really clear about setting"
1.0,I ordered a 4x and they sent me a package that said 4x on it but was more of a size large. Fabric is beautiful soft and I’d definitely would have love to wear these but they apparently don’t know the difference between a size large or 4x . Very disappointed.
1.0,Ugly in real life
1.0,terrible quality. I had to sew back over it because the seams were not holding anything together. Child size apron. Did not return because it was a gift for a few days later. I just repaired it all myself ...
1.0,Did NOT fit. hardly even stretched.
1.0,Didn’t like the not enough support Abeo brand is THE BEST
1.0,This said “ youth and adult “. It’s for an infant!  Doesn’t even fit around an adult neck.  “
1.0,"My wife hated this purse, not as described..it is very small and flimsy"
1.0,"Very bad quality! I wore them for 3 days, and they started to rust in my ear hole. Don't recommended these earrings at all!"
1.0,The size was way off. I returned it.
1.0,Photo looks like yellow gold they are rose gold and description was deceptive
1.0,I have ordered five sets of pajamas and this was the only that didn’t fit at all. They were way to small - and I just gave them away to a friend of mine that is much smaller! All of the other sets I have ordered from this same site fit great - but these pink ones with the large shorts were no good!!!
1.0,This watch is simply not working. Dont waste your money
1.0,"Thought I was receiving Blue and Amber lenses, both were grey. Night vision is yellow as advertised."
1.0,I’m a 36C and I returned them twice because it was too small!  The last one I purchased was a 42D and that didn’t fit!
1.0,"These came extremely damaged and are extremely cheaply made. However, for the one or two wears you get out of them they are very very cute. My very petitie 10 year old mentioned she wished they were a little bit wider and they were by no means waterproof even the slightest"
1.0,The clasp above the zipper is barely attached and fit of the pants are not true to size. I purchased a large and I'm a size 8 and they are still tight.
1.0,"much too small, length ok, width not"
1.0,"Edit: watch screen filled with moisture and stopped working after it was on the bathroom countertop during a shower.<br /><br />Fantastic watch, I had one of these for over a decade before someone borrowing it lost it. Very durable, great functionality. Just the right size. The original one I had was black with a silver bezel. That one goes for over $100 so that's a non-starter."
1.0,"My daughter is ten, an athletic swimmer on a team with a sturdy muscled frame (not plus size in any way) and we tried all the way up to a size 16 in this cut, and she can't even pull it up over her shoulders it is cut so tight and narrow. Speedo girl's suits seemed generally sized for very thin children. I'm pretty disgusted they are sized this far off the mark; not a pro-healthy body image from where I stand. So my advice is order a range of sizes and don't discuss what sizes they are for your girl. If your child is extremely thin and you struggle to find good fits for her in leggings, then this will fit well - we gave it to her cousin, who falls in that camp, and she was ecstatic to have a swimsuit that wasn't baggy on her."
1.0,It didn't have the sleeves like in the picture it is just a cape
1.0,3 out of 5 the of them the elastic pulled out when you go to put them on
1.0,Zero stars!! They slid down and rolled down my leg. Too tight at the top and too loose in the ankles.  DO NOT waste your money. Very disappointing.
1.0,These gloves tear with lil use. Junk
1.0,"This necklace is purple, not turquoise!"
1.0,This did not work.  The baby literally ripped it off it 2 seconds.  This was on as tight as possible.
1.0,Very cute! Turned my daughters holes colors within a couple days backs would not stayed screwed on.
1.0,Did not like at all
1.0,"Ordered the polka dots socks, product was not what I ordered. Very, very dissatisfied."
1.0,"Only the metal ones are internally threaded. I bought this for the clear ones, but they are externally threaded."
1.0,Size was way off!! I sent pics to them of a red 2XL shirt with the 3XL size shirt they sent to me laying on top of it and they still would not give me a refund.
1.0,"So in terms of how cannon the cosplay looks it’s extremely accurate. However, you can’t ignore the poor sewing that was done for mine in particular. It sounds like nobody else had this issue with having holes, freakishly long fingers, and a wide thumb area. I don’t know if it’s just a specific thing with my cosplay but it’s still not good quality control."
1.0,"A bit deformed in original package, opened it to try and make adjustments so I found out that it has sharp edges and a some rust; do not know how if will be able to use it without getting scratched. So sad, it looked so beautiful on the pictures :("
1.0,I can’t leave a review because the size was too small and when I went to reorder a bigger size it said not available.
1.0,"the material is not as pictured...it's like halloween costume material, shiney and smells like chemicals. It did have a really cute fit but it was definately too long and cheaply made."
1.0,"It said junior Dipper, so I thought it was for kids not adult. In order xl and was xl adult but fitted like xxl. Sooo now I'm wearing it ugh"
1.0,Beautiful dress but runs very small. Had to return
1.0,"I got it and it didn't work at all, maybe I got a bad one."
1.0,Do not like the quality. Thought they would be more substantial quality
1.0,Too small and looks weird. I think it would look better on a very skinny person.
1.0,"I returned it, did not like the feel or fit."
1.0,Horrible quality and fit. Not as Pictures.
1.0,The quality is not great. Runs small especially around chest area. I ordered a large based on reviews and still was too snug around chest. Also it took almost a month to arrive
1.0,cold even in living room.<br /><br />forget this and buy some hockey socks or other solution
1.0,Will be returning the watch shortly. The clasp on the watch does not stay closed. If I move my arm the watch opens.<br />Do not know if the clasp itself is defective?
1.0,Way to small n all I need the 18m they be big but I look n u all don't have the pack like what I got so I got these for nothing now :(
1.0,These came apart after a couple of weeks...
1.0,They were shipped in a bag. Never will I purchase again. I would give zero stars if I could.
1.0,Didn't care for it  Way bigger than expected and couldn't get the links to come out. Never used.
1.0,If you order through Comfort Clothing be aware that returning it you'll be charged a 35% restocking fee and pay for the shipping even though it says free shipping and free returns. Said on the order page that it was 100% cotton for the charcoal but was 60% cotton 40% polyester. So it won't shrink which I thought it would since I've bought a Knocker before and it shrunk to fit. This one's going to Goodwill. I talked with Amazon about the incorrect listing and this is what they said:<br />I apologize for the inconvenience.<br />I will be sure to pass on the feed back to the appropriate team.<br />Thank you for bringing it up.<br />Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
1.0,"They broke as soon as I put them on. Be careful,  like where white gloves and don't breathe when you open them. I got some gorilla glue and tweezers and put them back together."
1.0,The necklace fell apart the first day.  The she'll didn't stay closed.
1.0,The skirt that arrived was lilac and not pink. Very disappointed.
1.0,"The photos definitely are misleading. The real product doesn't look nor feel that great at all! While the size is a good size, the material completely sucks! The front part of the bag where the design is, peeled off as soon as I got it out of the flimsy plastic it was contained in!!! I had to throw it out before I could even let my daughter see it! Extremely disappointed and frustrated as it looked so good in pictures."
1.0,Item is not as described. It doesn't have the little ball stop on the inside of the nose. Very disappointed. I think I'm done trying to order studs off this website because I keep getting crap.
1.0,Even small is a tent.
1.0,need a big belt so holster stays in place.
1.0,I have purchased this twice now. It breaks within 6 weeks of purchase. I am not happy with this.
1.0,It had many chips on it
1.0,AWFUL!!!!! It is thinner than a basic shirt. It's almost see through !!! It is not sweater material. And the sleeves are short and baggy! Terrible product!!!!
1.0,"Too small, not as shown on picture. Not happy how the material falls"
1.0,Runs extremely Small!!! I normally wear an XL I ordered a 5XL and it literally looked like a child’s size Small!
1.0,"Not as described and broken. Plus there is no refund on postage, the return label does not cover postage and it will cost $16 to return. Does not deserve even a half a star, but since I HAVE TO MARK A STAR, ugggg, it is not because I wanted to."
1.0,Dress  Closure makes no sense I can’t wear it out of the house it’s ridiculous the V-neck goes down to the belly button
1.0,pretty jacket. runs real small
1.0,The Frame It’s too big
1.0,I ordered a 3xl and it fit someone who wears a xl. It runs very small.
1.0,"These are terrible and are nothing like what the photo advertises. Very cheap looking, &#34;straight leg&#34; and no elastic/stretch around the top. If you're looking for real fluffies, stay away from these because it was a waste of money."
1.0,This shirt looks nothing like the photo on their website! I'm not happy! It looks like a barney shirt
1.0,wont fit
1.0,Poor quality.  Purchased 2 different sets and they have both failed after a few uses; most recent broke after I put them on for the second time.  Wanted to like them because I like the design but not worth it if you can only wear them a couple times before they break.
1.0,"Beautiful dress but runs extra, extra small:,)"
1.0,"Wish I would have read reviews before I purchased. The blue, is glued on glitter. Nothing compared to the description.  Cheap."
1.0,Meh. Tight around the ears. Would be better for youth than adult.
1.0,The bottoms were too small
1.0,Very thin fabric needs a slip under it.
1.0,The wristband was missing a piece for assembly attachment
1.0,This was way too small. I ordered an extra large because I like a looser fit. It fits my daughter who wears a small/medium
1.0,Too big. I thought I ordered a size extra large and received in the mail 2X.  2X is not my size.
1.0,The item came quick but zipper broke immediately. Came with missing apron and missing white blouse. Too bad the party is tomorrow and I have nothing to wear. Quality not great for the price.
1.0,We ordered a small because that's the size in all the shirts my teenage son wears- this arrived as a SP. the P I have never seen before- maybe it means small petite because it was too short in arms and length compared to size S
1.0,i dont have very big legs but these were horrible my baby sister could fit these. I hate them and will never get anything from them again.
1.0,Scratches when putting on rubber gloves. Not a worth the money.
1.0,"I’m normally a medium and that’s what I ordered, these are not yoga pant material, rather a slinky material. Terrible quality! And I ordered two!"
1.0,Fell apart first Time I used it
1.0,They run small I'm a 12 ordered a 14 and they are perfect.<br />Edit: had them about a month and worn only indoors a hand full of times and the sole has already come apart.
1.0,I liked the glasses but they broke after 3 days.  I'm pretty upset because the seller will not allow for returns.  I would like to try another pair.  Unfortunate
1.0,These are great except for the horrible mirror finish. They are blurry to see through and you can see the finish dried in a puddled/crackled fashion on the inside of the lens. I returned them.
1.0,Most of these earings did not fit. I wouldn't buy these ever again!!!
1.0,I ordered a size XL and the pants looked like a size S
1.0,I bought from kellyoyama and received a dress that has snags and an uneven hem. It was so bad the dress looked asymmetrical but is not. It was a defect that's not worth $10. Can't believe people sell this online. Returned. Do not recommend the seller!
1.0,"Too small, too short and buttons dont stay buttoned (could be because its tight but even the bust area, which is loose, kept coming open."
1.0,Turned my legs blue
1.0,Felt plastic.
1.0,"It was shapeless, and the back kept sticking out."
1.0,Way too small. Terrible quality as it is fake and screen printing looks terrible.
1.0,Elastic band is way too large and not the same color as the skirt. Ordered wine red and the band is a bright red
1.0,It arrived broken!
1.0,"No blue light blocking film. Just transparent glasses. I didn't order them to look smart, but to actually have protection from computer screens. Very disappointed."
1.0,Changed color and fell apart. Very poor product.
1.0,I ordered this item on 4/29/20 and it was delivered on 5/31 and the window to return it was 6/9/20.  That's unacceptable especially since it look over a month to receive the item.  Don't order this item from this company.  The emblem is screen printed and not embroidered and it's also off centered.
1.0,When I first got the bracket in it was pretty but unfortunately the finger hole is way too long and around my wrist it was also to lose so wasn’t holding the jams on the right side up and I have a medium wrist and this was still too big.  Towards the end of the night of the wedding party that I went to buy the rest and the jams the bracelet broke either I was dancing too much I just didn’t hold and contact for the strength needed to do physical activity and I guess.
1.0,This jacket is very warm and would’ve been a great buy if the zipper wouldn’t have broke the first time I wore it.
1.0,Disappointed this was NOT a real coach wallet and I paid coach prices.. Will never shop here agn. And could not return
1.0,Terrible. Don't buy. Waste of money. The thing is soooooo small its almost funny. Was so disappointed I returned it! Don't buy it
1.0,Good colors but the fit was way to small. Made for really skinny guys with no muscles! None at all!
1.0,Good quality and print but one foot was shorter than the other. I was excited when purchasing only to be disappointed upon receipt. Too much hassle to return.  I also bought 3t for my 3 year old turns out it was too short.
1.0,Not a good product did not stand up.to one day of use .. not very happy
1.0,The earrings are poor quality.  I only wore them once and the daisy is missing.  The wire for your ear bends and also fell apart from the spring to the ball.
1.0,These were awful. Not high waisted like described and the material felt cheap. Sent back immediately
1.0,Run small and don't keep your hands warm
1.0,the product broke in just two days after purchase
1.0,Came with ripped seams/not completely sewn
1.0,These are the cheapest quality leggings I've ever had.  I guess I should have expected it with their 3-package deal.  The blue ones had a hole in the upper thigh when I opened them and put them on for the first time.  The browns ones have a hole in the waist-elastic area that I noticed after wearing them once.  cheap crap!  I won't buy them again!
1.0,"Was advertised as cutting glare at night. Sad to say, I didn't notice a reduction in glare at all"
1.0,Liked this product if get a deal will buy more
1.0,It was to little and it doesn't make you sweat like in the picture.
1.0,"I know these shirts run small supposed to be tight . I got a xxx  large and couldn't get it past my shoulders , very disappointed . I ended up giving it to my son who wears  a large , and it's tight on him . Would not order from or give a good review to my friends now I have filled out review on all things I bought on amazon . I have only received a reply to one of them . Beginning to think amazon is being taken over by China as all the cloths are tiny"
1.0,"Ribs small, cheap,and itchy"
1.0,"The top is very pretty. The fit was just right,I washed it in cold water and it shrunk anyway . Currently un wearable"
1.0,Returned it. It looks more fashionable in the photo and it’s not. Looks like something an old lady would wear.
1.0,thought that this was a light weight work out tights. Tried one on just to see how they would fit. It had multiple runs before I got both legs in
1.0,"This product was not the drawstring backpack that was pictured when I purchased it. The bag is adequate, but not what I wanted. I'll be returning this. Just hate that I wasted money having it overnighted to me for a festival as it won't work for me at all. It would be more honest to have the actual item pictured."
1.0,Material scratches skin.  Don't look right
1.0,Beautiful colors but is too thick to be  lip rings hardtop put in & very uncomfortable a waste of money
1.0,My mom has dimentia and threw the pkg away
1.0,Cool to look at but it can pinch against your nose not much space in the middle and doesn’t really show the full design.
1.0,"Junk! For some reason, I received 2 necklaces, both in pieces. I managed to use parts of one to put the other together. Both will probably go in the trash. The epitome of cheap!"
1.0,"To say this dress looks nothing like the picture is an understatement.  I don’t know where they got the picture for the dress on the model but don’t expect that dress to arrive at your house. It fits as expected but WOW is it ugly. Cheaply made (which okay I get it, it’s a $22 dress so you get what you pay for) but geez.... this thing will definitely leave the room speechless. Lol return requested.<br /><br />Edit: they never refunded me my money. Even opened a case with Amazon for false advertising; they did nothing. Maybe one day I’ll find someone I hate enough to pass this imposter off to."
1.0,"This is not a dress or a tunic. It fits snug. It is not loose and flowing. I ordered according to the size chart(xxl) and it fit in the sleeves and the length was good but it is not a dress type fit. Even though it was a cheap price, you can't title it a dress when it's clearly not."
1.0,Not good quality at all. Very disappointed
1.0,"Absolutely terrible product. Do not buy I ordered 3 different sizes for my son. The sizing was inconsistent could not find a size that fit his feet. I ended up going to a brick and mortar store and they fit him for a size 11 in keen sandals. I purchased a size 10,11 and 12 in these awful dream pairs sandals."
1.0,Poor quality. Could not install. Retuned it quickly.
1.0,Something different showed up that what was advertised! Shady practices. Find something else to buy!
1.0,horibble  dont buy
1.0,They don’t look the same like in the picture I don’t like them
1.0,"I wrote a review before but it obviously didn't get published. I give ZERO stars for delivery (it took over a month) and quality. It is 2 very thin layers. I was going to use for Christmas pictures, thankfully it did not arrive in time as it wouldn't have worked anyway because it is so thin and cheaply made. Look elsewhere."
1.0,This is poorly sized overall - the bottoms are HUGE (too much sag in crotch area) and the top is too short - just a weird fit altogether.. I am between a medium/large and went with a large due to other customer feedback but was beyond disappointed.. don't waste your money or time on this one.
1.0,Waste of money. Poor quality and arrived bent.
1.0,Stitches coming off after one wash
1.0,Mal producto tiene un olor horrible
1.0,"Cheap material, tight on arms but loose on waist. Very unflattering. Don’t buy."
1.0,"I was attracted to the Eye of Agamoto since it was supposed to be a movie prop replica. Unfortunately it fell short. Although heavy, it feels cheap. It's not highly detailed -obviously it does not open. The green stone inside goes unnoticed at first since it has a dull color -obviously it does not turns on. I wanted it as part of my collection, ended up giving it to my nephew who had good fun with it, at least for the first couple of days, as it happens with all kids and their new toys. I was one, I should now."
1.0,"I am a large man. 6’8” tall and 350lbs. I wanted this vest for when I go I’ve fishing to keep me warm. I normally wear a US sized 5xl. Which is what I ordered. When the package came ( two months after ordering ) the package said it was 6xl. I thought I’d try it to see how it fit, hoping it would be just a little big but still useable. The product sizing is sooooo wrong that I couldn’t even get my arms in. I had my wife who is a size zero and 5’2” tall try it on. She normally wears an extra small. She put it on and couldn’t bring the zippers together to zip it up. If I had to guess the actual size of this product… it’s likely a US xxxxxxsmall … that’s 6xSMALL.<br /><br />I’m very Disappointed, I was looking forward to using it. It actually appeared to be decent quality… but the size isn’t even built for a human adult."
1.0,Feels and looks horrible. Not comfortable. Comes in a pack and after one I didn’t even open the others
1.0,"Zipper was inside out, sent back."
1.0,Very poor workmanship made on Friday
1.0,terrible quality.
1.0,Does not work for me
1.0,"These were cute, but they were so cheaply made that they broke as soon as I took them out of the packaging. Very disappointed in this product."
1.0,Turned green and little chains pinched skin!
1.0,For not buy for septum because they are super tiny
1.0,Poor quality would not recommend the stitching is horrible and the dress material is very thin.
1.0,"The fabric content on the actual shirt attached label is listed as 35% cotton, 65% polyester. The cotton content of this shirt is much less than advertised in the web page description. This shirt feels like it is made of cheap polyester fabric."
1.0,"Completamente inconforme no fue el modelo que pedi, deben ser mas especificos con las tallas y modelos. Recibi una blusa que parece de cabellero y el modelo no es el que aparece en la foto. Diicil de regresar por el costo que esto representa"
1.0,Make kinda cheaply but figured it was fine for a daddy daughter dance. Before my daughter even left she complained that the sequins from the bodice was irritating her arms. When she got home from the dance 2 hours later she had huge rashes on her arms from the material. I'd return it but it was a one time use dress for a dance. Would never put it on my child again
1.0,Very cute but Grip on heel fell off by the 4th wear.
1.0,"Out of the bag, the balls were stripped and would not thread on. Find a different vendor."
1.0,I did not like this product because when I tested it out in front of the Mirror I saw my granny staring back at me. It also wasn’t big enough. It was light until I put the necessities in it which I couldn’t fit them all in anyway. My phone  barely fit and it was just was not what I expected at all
1.0,These are massive! if your as small as the model looks then these are going to big enourmous on you.
1.0,"The chain links bend way too easily so the key chain fell apart the second day I had them. Also the decal has chipped considerably. Disappointment all around, after I was so excited."
1.0,Zipper broke first then buckles broke. Dont waste your money
1.0,"Didn’t fit per the size guide. And the material is so cheap feeling, it felt like a Halloween costume you’d get in a bag."
1.0,"I ordered this for a wedding in July.  I tried it on right when I got it and it fit fine.  I put it on in early July and the zipper is broken, without me ever having worn it or taken off the tags.  I have missed my return window."
1.0,The boots itself look like plastic and the top is made of felt. They look very cheap and should not be priced at $60 plus dollars. I couldn’t believe what I saw when I opened the box. Don’t waste your money on these
1.0,I WANT TO RETURN IT FOR A SMALL.
1.0,I received these and before I could put them both in one of the gems or the stud was stripped so never got to actually wear them. With out the “ball” falling off
1.0,The Shirt looks stupid
1.0,At first stunning! After one week looked like a cheap 25 cent necklace
1.0,This product is gaudy and just plain awful. Not as represented. F-
1.0,"They are way oversized, just wanted to return them, no cost. And order a larger size. Not worth paying $7-8.00 .  I did like the shoes!!!!"
1.0,"Change how it's  presented,these items are not sized properly too small for American  bodies!!"
1.0,Not what I expected.  The pair I tied on at DSW were totally different and it's the same brand and size but less expensive. These seem like a replica.. wouldn't recommend.
1.0,The pockets where the cards go ripped the first time I tried to add them. Not happy with this product at all.
1.0,"Huge. This thing was below floor length if wrapped around the waist, and I am 5’9”. The fabric is also extremely thin. I returned it."
1.0,The  caps look good and are well made. I bought One for myself and 2 as gifts. The problem is that they have a strong chemical smell. I aired them out for 3 weeks and the smell is still there. I believe that this smell is a health hazard. After wearing it for several ours my eyes were burning and I got a rash. I am looking for a lab o analyze  the chemical. Will repost when I find out.
1.0,it was way too small
1.0,I found three rusted staples in the back of one of the headbands! Not really why anyone would find that acceptable. No quality control!
1.0,Broke after less than 2 months :(
1.0,"The dress looks beautiful, fit gorgeously but unfortunately it was sheer. Not appropriate for a summer wedding. I purchased a small"
1.0,Well I had about 3 hours of joy before the left one shorted out and stopped working.
1.0,"While the material was thin, it was still cute.. until I washed it. Once washed, the scalloped edges on the entire shirt started rolling up. Even after ironing them down, within an hour the sleeves rolled up multiple times to where it looked like a plain shirt with no scalloped edges. As soon as I got home, I put the shirt in the trash. Wish I would have known it was going to do this before wearing/washing it."
1.0,The belt separated and the so called leather has peeled off . Unexpected.  I purchased it a while back.  Just started wearing it about 2 weeks ago. This is what happened.  I bought a blue one no problem with it. Abd an ostrage color I haven't worn it yet. But the brown one is garbage.
1.0,"I put them on my glasses one time.  In removing them, they snapped my eyeglass arm in two.  Let the buyer beware."
1.0,"This dress was really pretty with bright flowers and a lovely navy color for the base. However after washing it twice in cold water on the delicate cycle, the navy is really faded and the dress is already starting to get bally. If my daughter didn't like it so much, I would send it back. For $20 this dress should not do that after only two washes."
1.0,"Ugly and uncomfortable. They don't conform to the face at all, they are absolutely straight and unbending, so they sit far away from the face."
1.0,One size does not fit all. Cute but it's actually like a size small. It's not long like the picture shows it almost fits like a crop top
1.0,Very poor quality bracelet. I dindt like it at all
1.0,"These run very small. Couldn't tell back from front as there is no room for your genitals or your ass no matter which way you put them on!! They ripped the first time I wore them. I'm very disappointed cause they looked so good on the model and I was really looking forward to them. They looked sooo sexy and see thru! Sorry, they're garbage. I'll have to reconsider whether to order anything from the Tonsee company in the future."
1.0,Way too small. I usually wear size 2. Bought size M and it won’t even close on the front. I will be returning. I am afraid that if I order XL will be too lose on the shoulders. I don’t think I will buy it again.
1.0,Broke the minute I gave it to my brother for Christmas.
1.0,Good quality but it runs too small
1.0,This product gave me a rash on my nose. Now I have to walk around with this deformity until it clears. They use cheap metal instead of nose pads. Which I didn't notice until after taking the sunglasses off and seeing a rash on both sides of my nose. The pictures look better than what it looks like it real life.
1.0,"This shirt was not sewn well.  I like the color and the fit; however, it bunches at the button - I've kept it because it's comfortable and I can wear it around the house."
1.0,Cheaply made.  Extremely thin fabric.  Sizing is off.  Large fit as XS!
1.0,This came in a plastic bag. I have attached a photo. When I opened the bag I found the hat without a charging cord and one of the speakers inside the hat was detached. No instructions of any type were included!!! We went online to get the instructions. After using our charger and attempting to connect the Bluetooth it still doesn’t work!!!!
1.0,Product arrived broken and there is no returns.
1.0,They are cute but are too large and silky causing it to slip down your butt a lot. Tried to return it but seller refused.
1.0,"I bought the orange tie-dye one, and it was basically just a solid orange top without the darker streaks of orange and vibrant color you see in the photo. It wasn't even a nice orange; it was a washed-out solid yellowish orange. Very disappointing, so I'm returning it."
1.0,"Title of items is extremely misleading saying it is a ""Tray Pendant with Glass Cabochons"" then, in parentheses, saying bezel only.  Trays look nice but the glass cabochons were not included with my order.  Means customer has to go and order them separately which would have been very nice to know at time of original order."
1.0,I wear XXL pants but these pants weren't even close to fitting.
1.0,Cannot see the image; small and out of focus.
1.0,The dress was too small the split in the front two wide open
1.0,Cheap product. You would have thought it would have been in embroided. But it looks like it's like an iron-on sticker. But I guess you get what you pay for
1.0,"Wanted to have quality ""full waterproof"" pants that were wellade and stretchy. The quality 8 like but the main REASON I bought these was for a full rain like it is today to hike in. They get an F for Failure! Do not buy if as it shows in picture fully submersed In water. I will be returning. False Advertising. Amazon take note."
1.0,"My daughter had the kitty one and having to put the pump back together occasionally she loves it and it has held up well to daily use. I jumped on the Elsa one because she loves Frozen however after one wear it was coming apart in several places. Very disappointed,  now that they are a hit it seems like the quality has decreased I am sure in an attempt to increase the profit margin."
1.0,"These masks are too big for my 5 yr old , inaccurate description to fit from a 3-7yr old. The sizing chart should say 7 and up"
1.0,"Band does not stay on, does not lock in place."
1.0,I am afraid to try them because the other pair hurt so much
1.0,Description wrote 5 pack received 3 pair. Using their math I probably got one extra sock.  They run a little small
1.0,I bought the green one first and it was awesome.  The fabric was really since and the length perfect.  I loved it so much I ordered another in grey.  It is not like the green one at all. The fabric is really cheap and the cut is not even the same.  Too bad because the first one I got was awesome.
1.0,"At first I thought I didn't screw the thread in correctly , when it happened to the second and third one within a day I realized the thread is too small to fit the bar and it falls off"
1.0,Keep snapping off after one use. Seems like a good concept but in practice doest work
1.0,This band was horrible and broke as soon as it was attached.
1.0,Measure your waist and look at the size before ordering
1.0,"Very see through. Stitching poor in the bust. Pockets don’t fully close and is bunchy on one side. Also, you definitely cannot wear a bra with this because the strap are more midline then normal and sadly it has no boning so you can’t get away with no wearing a bra either; especially because it’s so see through. Lose lose situation. Beautiful color, Length was perfect and dress fit true to size. Unfortunately it’s just very cheap looking and unwearable without a jacket :/"
1.0,Terrible watch. The watch band came apart after 2 days and was unfixable.
1.0,"I got these for my husbands sunglasses. He uses readers around the house, but doesn't have prescription sunglasses.<br /><br />I was excited when I saw these, but was disappointed when we tried to adhere to his shades.<br />We followed the instructions of putting in warm water and waiting an hour after pressing them on, but they didn't really stay on well.<br /><br />First there were too many air bubbles and made it weird to look thru, then one just popped off and because they're clear... lost it : (<br /><br />You can try these on your shades and maybe they stick on different shaped sunglasses... I don't know.<br /><br />Good luck if you buy these. I wish they would've worked for my husband."
1.0,"My product arrived on time, but is cracked right where all the wiring comes together. It feels like it will completely break apart if you touch it or try to wear it. The plastic of the mask is razor thin and it will not make it through an entire night. Disappointed because it would have been a very cool piece to the purge costume."
1.0,Not like the picture- I wanted it distressed like the photo but it’s one color not at all like the presentation
1.0,"Bought the 1-2yr old size for my son who is 2yr3months. Still way too big. However, even when it's big it's impossible to put it on and have his thumb in the right spot. Missed the window for return so I guess I'm keeping these, maybe my son can try them again next winter?"
1.0,Very cheap material. Do not waste your money on this cheap crap
1.0,"El artículo quedo bien pero el material de la tela no me gustó , esperaba otra cosa y llegó otra"
1.0,They fall off your face.  Don't buy them I wasted my money.
1.0,The hole to put your head in is for a baby. Way too small. Not proportionate.
1.0,Worst fitting shoes I've ever had.
1.0,Size was not accurate.  It was easy too small despite ordering my typical size.
1.0,"Cute shorts however the fit is odd. They fit great in the waist but the balloon bottom portion was a bit too wide for my liking. Unfortunately, I’m going to need to return."
1.0,Cheap knockoff
1.0,Looks and feels like plastic. Returning it.
1.0,Too long in the sleeves and length and overall too big. Hard fabric makes the dress very unflattering. I've bought much nicer dresses for the same price...not worth it.
1.0,This product was jo where close true to size returned immediately
1.0,Stone fell off within the first 10 hours - received replacement and clasp was broken. Returning for my money back
1.0,This is a lot shorter than expected and is really low cut showed half my breasts.
1.0,"Piece of junk. I bought two bags from clinch gear, and both have torn and failed. Do not buy bags from CG."
1.0,It just was cut funny.  It didn't fit right at all.
1.0,"These were soft and attractive leggings, but the seam in the crotch ripped open while I was out jogging in them. It was only the second time I'd worn them, and I washed them gentle cycle and air dryed them! I even bought the larger size and had extra room in them, so it's not like there was stress on the seams. Very unfortunate, because I liked the colors and softness. I never write 1-star reviews, but I hope no one else wastes their money on these 😣"
1.0,I have the blue and black of this dress also and they are wonderful. Ordered red and the fabric is not the same at all. It's 88% Polyester 12% Spandex. Not what I ordered. Disappointed
1.0,The leather end looks weird. It's much longer in reality than the picture. Not what I expected at all.
1.0,Second time buying these and again neither one will unscrew!
1.0,CHEAP. IT BROKE TRYING TO GET IT ON MY TEN YEAR OLD.
1.0,Y’all! DO NOT BUY THIS and expect what’s pictured. I thought I was getting leggings and got boot cut flood pants. The entire outfit is something totally different from the picture. Ruined my travel outfit. Only giving 1 star because I can’t give 0 and still warn people to run the other way. Btw I’m 5’9
1.0,This product DOES NOT FIT Garmin Forerunner watches as advertised.
1.0,Did not realize that kids size = boys size. These ended up being HUGE on me. Make sure you do your conversion work if you're attempting to buy a style for women.
1.0,Scam
1.0,Expect to have 3 ornament pieces broken off when you open the package.  Avoid!
1.0,"Cute for the 2 hours it lasted, lol... Paid $1.50 so I wasn’t expecting much. Disposable ring is how I would describe it."
1.0,"very poor quality, and when I requested a return, this company was located in china! so if you buy one of this paper like boots, you are stuck with them, the price to return is much bigger than the cost itself."
1.0,to bad.
1.0,I don’t like it!<br />It’s seem very cheap!
1.0,The ones bought at Costco a few years back were great and lasted a long time.  These newer ones started to separate at the waistband on the fronts on almost all pairs within about a month of using them and washing them.<br />Very poor quality.<br /><br />Sad because they were so good before!!
1.0,"I think if you have a small bust and a less curvy figure, this will fit you better. The top part barely covered my bust area and it isn’t as flowy as expected, so it was not flattering or what I was looking for."
1.0,They are too big and bulky
1.0,Very cute when it arrived. Hand washed it and it shrunk so much I can't wear it again. Save your money.
1.0,Cord broke within a week
1.0,I  loved them.  But I received them damaged. One was broken. 🤷🏽‍♀️
1.0,Both pairs ripped in the first wearing at dance class.
1.0,Not the right size and it looks used.
1.0,Going back. Very poorly made particularly with the touchscreen thumb material sewn on the outside part of the thumb.
1.0,Cheap don't waste your money
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:f3ca988c9536b68c4cbedce58fece3]] The dress I received did not look ANYTHING like the picture. Dress was SHINY satin, bottom did not sit firm like picture and attachment on shoulder just flops. I purchased the dress because of the design and the unique shape as I am voluptuous and hippy.<br />Dress is also uneven in person at the bottom but floor length all around in Picture.  I  normally wear a L and just purchased said size for a Gala last month and it fit perfectly.  This time I  ordered an XL and couldn't get it past my hips. I purchased another formal dress the same day in my regular size and I received it the same day as thus one and it fit perfectly."
1.0,"The cream color was completely see-through, which is always a good chance in that color. However, the picture of the cute leopard print pocket is deceiving because it does not look as pictured. I should have taken a picture before I returned it. It looked like more of a camo design than leopard print."
1.0,One of the buttons won't clasp. I'd think twice about buying this product.
1.0,Micro small for price.
1.0,"I've only had this watch less than 3 months and I wore this watch 3X.  (I even pull out the stem between use to save the battery).  It stopped working today.  Hope I can return this worthless watch.  Sigh!<br />PS:  Amazon made it right and gave me a refund.  Thank you, Amazon"
1.0,"I wanted a cotton mask, instead I got an 80-20 poly blend. Currently  looking to see if I can return them."
1.0,These gloves fell apart after being worn twice
1.0,Dislike how it looked on me
1.0,"The shoes arrived with the Ariel badge torn off.  I had to glue back to shoes.  I would have just returned them, but my daughter saw them, and no guarantee the next pair would be better."
1.0,What i got was a different mask. Zelda design but not the same. No draw string at all. Image was where the neck would be so youd never see it when wearing it. It was so tight i had trouble putting it on. Felt like that watermelon with the rubberbands.
1.0,"Watch out purchasers....  Big promises, no follow through.  700+ unhappy people on Kickstarter so far."
1.0,This item is too small & very thin
1.0,"Product was flat and cracked when you will receive the helmet.  The plastic, specifically the base of the horns, is deformed and will crack further when you try putting it on your head. Return shipment back to China is more expensive than cost of helmet. Seller does not respond to return product issue. Bad product, bad seller."
1.0,so cheaply made both chains broke the first 5 minutes of wearing..
1.0,Very cheap material. Price not worth it
1.0,"The first dress I ordered was so beautiful and perfect, shipped fast and fit perfectly. So I ordered a second and was sent the WRONG design completely. I didn't care for the design I ended up recieving, which is why i ordered the other floral design instead. And i was sent this one which is pretty but NOT what I ordered. Now I'm worried the 3rd dress I ordered from that this will arrive in a few days will be the wrong design too! Be aware, the dresses are great but they may send you the wrong one!!"
1.0,"Not at all how it appears to be in the picture. One is just black, the other is just blue, and the third is a milky color. These are not worth it."
1.0,You can not miss this far on sizes.  Please.  Another waste of my money.  Will have to give them away.
1.0,"Distorted view.  They look nice, but they have a distorted view.  They are not clear to look out and makes them unusable.  Would not buy them again."
1.0,"The fabric is nice and they're sewn well.  Maybe it's just me but these wouldn't stay in place, the band either slips down over my eyes or the whole cap comes off before I've even fallen asleep.  I really wanted to like these."
1.0,"I did not realize when ordering this dress it was coming from China.  My issue, however I would highly recommend unless you know your size that you do not order from this seller.  The dresses are not true to sizes listed and it does not make sense to ship back to China if it does not fit so you then are stuck with an item you cannot wear.  A pricey lesson learned, but I will be more mindful in my purchases in the future.  Just sharing for others to learn from my oversight."
1.0,"While the fit is good, it’s pretty much a waste of money ladies. I wore a tampon with the panties on a regular flow day and bled through the panties. I got these to prevent an embarrassing event, FAIL."
1.0,Cheap.  Feels abs looks like a child’s cheap Halloween costume.  NOT what is pictured
1.0,Bought the navy blue band and after less than a month it started peeling off. Looks like there's actuall a denim band underneath that was covered with a sticky navy blue top. Returning it tomorrow
1.0,"I bought the ""Blue Glass Spray Bottles 8oz ULG 3 Piece Boston Round Cobalt Blue Scale Empty Bottles Heavy Duty Black Trigger Sprayer Mist, Stream Settings Refillable Container for Essential Oils Cleaning Products "" to apply a light coat of oil to to my skillet when cooking. The sprayer only shoots a stream of even the lightest viscosity oils, so it is useless for me."
1.0,Runs VERY SMALL!!!
1.0,We bought a second light bar due to it being faulty and within a week the second bar stopped working completely.<br />I would not recommend this product.
1.0,Within a week this bookbag broke. The strap completely ripped. Also the little keychain was broken upon arrival
1.0,This band was supposed to be a black cheetah print but the black was more brown/purple. It’s white on the inside and the white can be seen from the sides when the band is on. I returned it.
1.0,"Very hard to take off, had to use tooks"
1.0,Received 1 boot . Zipper is damaged
1.0,Is this onesie a joke?? The crotch is completely open and the snaps are nearly impossible to open. Avoid.

1.0,Laces broke in just one month of usage
1.0,"I ordered the snake pattern, what arrived was a different pattern and different colors than what was pictured on site."
1.0,Very pretty BUT not sized to fit American women’s shoe sizes. Very disappointed
1.0,"Ill fitting, shaped ""funny"""
1.0,Horrible quality wish I never orders this product. Product broke in my mouth
1.0,Shorter than pictures.  Doesn't cover the back very much. Shorter than anticipated.  Seams aren't very well done. First wash before wear actually seems to have it coming apart at the seams. Pq
1.0,Well over half the lights either don't work or barely lit.  Very disappointed with this pack of finger lights. Should have listened to the other reviewers.
1.0,I think these are children’s pants. I gave them to a 12 year old girl that could fit them.
1.0,Wen u put them on they feel uneven... n they slip off... but they are soft

1.0,Hat arrived without piece that secured and adjusts strap!  I needed it the next day so I had to sew it together!!
1.0,"COLOR GADED AFTER ONE WASH, LOOKED CHEAP"
1.0,ridiculously huge! Clown like
1.0,"These are advertised as being just right for a shopping cart. NOPE! They don't reach all the way across, but the main problem is that they are not deep enough to reach the ""floor"" of the basket. They are like they were made for the much smaller baskets from yesteryear. Or maybe for a different country, not USA. The only good thing was that when I was going to return them, the company said to just keep them and they refunded my money."
1.0,Too small. Size up at least 2 sizes. Once we washed them once (following directions) they looked like infant size.
1.0,"The leather was not of quality.  It got marks on it very fast.  The plastic coating on the buckle comes off, and it fit like it was 2 sizes smaller."
1.0,the hook that connects the long strap broke the night I recieved it....n a week later the hook on the short strap broke off......I've had the black one for almost a yr and used it alot n fine......i dont understand what's goin on with this pink one.....very disappointed.....🤨🤔😶<br /><br />update: i recieved a call from company....said they would send me a new shoulder strap.....will update again.....with hopefully a better review when i recieve it.....my black one like this one is still going strong tho.....thats a plus ig

1.0,"This dress is not as it is depicted. Once you go to the plus sizes, the entire design & dress change! We returned it!"
1.0,Recieved some craft boards not glasses not happy
1.0,"Smells like chemicals, runs very small, lacks a slit in the back thus you're unable to actually move."
1.0,The length is what I expected but it does not wrap far enough in the front like the picture. I was hoping to use this as sort of a jacket for my witch costume but it doesn't look like it will work.
1.0,The inner fur liner sheds. It was popping out around the edge of the sole because They were sewn poorly. Returning them ASAP.
1.0,"Returned upon opening, these looked cheap"

1.0,"This was so upsetting! We were extremely excited for these masks but once I open the package, our excitement disappeared!! The floral mask looks NOTHING like the picture!! So misleading!!!"
1.0,"Just don't like it, too big, too shiny, too short for dress. Too long to wear leggings. Very hot materiel."
1.0,"It was like I touched it and it broke...disappointing. Never buying this again,very bad quality and just not worth it at all."
1.0,"I have two pairs of these pants. The fabric is very thin and they are about six inches too short. I have washed them or I would send back, sorry I bought them."

1.0,One side came damaged
1.0,"I bought these boots for work and they are far from the most comfortable boots I'll ever wear.  I usually take a 10.5US boot size. I used NATS sizing chart and by their measurement, I'm a size 10US. The boots hurt my toes. I'm on my feet all day and need good boots. I tried them and now I'm out over 200 dollars. I don't recommend them at all or if you do buy them, go up a half size. Now I have a 200+ dollar pair of boots that I cant wear and cant return."
1.0,"I bought these earrings for a Halloween costume. To say they were a disappointment is an understatement. The bananas face the same way which is annoying but what is even more annoying is the horrible metal used to make them. The backs started bubbling up within one day and the front image also started peeling. So now I have to print a paper, box them back up and take them to UPS. Save yourself some time and money and do not buy from this seller!!"

1.0,If you a Rapper then I guess this is appropriate!
1.0,sizing incorrect
1.0,"I like the bag. But on the first day my son brought it to school the zipper broke. And no matter what I try nothing fixed. The zipper<br />Keep getting stuck, so I tried wd-40 and that didn’t work. Now I can’t return it and have to buy another bag for my son. Is was so disappointed."
1.0,"Pilled immediately.  Soft, but not well made."
1.0,The top is adorable.<br />The bottoms are ridiculously tiny and show too much of your bottom.
1.0,Horrible - I wish i could send it back.
1.0,"Fit my shoulder width, loose waist, loose arms. Constantly have this problem, athletic clothes made to fit someone with same size waist as chest. Even castelli, sportful etc., their size charts are sad."
1.0,Have had these less than a week and they’re already separating.
1.0,"The construction of these is very poor quality.  They are falling apart after a short time, under normal wearing conditions.  We are extremely disappointed in this product and won't be ordering from this seller again."
1.0,"This dress looks exactly as pictured except...it’s about 18” shorter than it looks on the model in the picture! I’m 5’11” and shop for midi dresses on Amazon regularly; sometimes they hit the shin and sometimes they hit the knee. This dress, though, hit my upper thigh and the slit in the back started at my lower back (hello, my entire butt is showing)!"
1.0,returned asap
1.0,Cheaply made and looked uneven to me. Very thin material. Ran small. Ended up returning
1.0,"Pearls are actually plastic and not painted correctly.  The paint came off of all of them leaving white plastic spots.  All oysters have been opened.  So unhappy with this purchase and will never buy outside of the U.S. again.  This is not the first time I have purchased these oysters.  The ones I got from inside the U.S. were fine, luster pearls.  These are trash.  Scam artist and not even a good one at that.  DO NOT BUY THESE FROM THIS PERSON AS YOU ARE WASTING YOUR MONEY."
1.0,When my sister got it it was already comming apart but she wanted a leather jacket so bad she didnt tell me about it until she wore it once and it started peeling!
1.0,"UPDATE: after looking at the ring closer and taking it off for a closed inspection I saw something that looked like tape on the inner band, a little picking and it came off WITH THE DESIGN! The cats weren’t in the resin! They were just tapped to the inside! Very cheaply! So disappointed! I canceled my other orders! Buyer beware!"
1.0,"Costume looks good but I wear large but when it comes to costume I like them to be loose, so I got 2XX It did not fit it was like a extra small. With a 2xx label. Don’t buy from this company you will be wasting your money and you will be very disappointed. Hope it helps FV"
1.0,Weird stitching line that happened to land straight across my boobs. Looked ridiculous. Sent back asap.
1.0,I would give 0 if I could. it broke and I wore it once. the gems all broke off....
1.0,"I should have done that too. These pants have some strange cut. I normally wear size M but these are way too small.  I will try to return and get a size L, so I can see at least how they fit. I think the fabric feels like what I expected, but these are way too small to be able to tell how they feel. Sending back."
1.0,This item would fit a toddler not my 9yr old daughter. Thankfully I ordered one from another company as well just to be safe and that one fit perfectly. Highly disappointed. I will be donating this item to the dance school for someone who can fit in it
1.0,"The first time I wore a pair, the stitching came undone and I was left with a drape cloth by the end of the day."
1.0,Bulky and not pleasant to touch against your skin.
1.0,"While the design is cute, the neck hole was massive compared to the rest of the romper. It kept falling off my son's shoulders. After only wearing it for the second time, one of the snaps broke. We decided it was time to toss it. Don't waste your money on this ill-fitting cheaply made romper."
1.0,Not comfort  not the right size
1.0,These boots are really cheaply made. They are very uncomfortable and have a horrible  chemical smell.
1.0,This feels so cheap and it is not something to wear in public nor is it comfortable enough to wear at home. Fits a little small as well. Made for the trash
1.0,"Was crushed. Unable to reform, disappointed gave it to my neighbor girl to play house with."
1.0,so see through yuck
1.0,"They are smaller than stated. I wear a 7.5 and they are tight and the heel rolls off when walking.  Shallow, tight fit overall. I will not purchase these again. I can’t wear them."
1.0,"La tela es suave y cómoda, se adapta al cuerpo, en la primera postura se fue la costura.<br /><br />Deben mejorar el producto.<br /><br />Por los momentos no recomiendo que lo compre."
1.0,Dissatisfied for sure. Given the fact that I did not receive the ring that is displayed. However I should have taken into consideration the price and known that it wasn't going to be up to par.
1.0,A complete waste of money. I was so excited to receive these socks. First time put on the Superman sock my toe went through the end. When you're wearing a pair you can see every detail of your foot through the sock. It feels like you're wearing absolutely nothing and they're very slippery. I would never recommend.
1.0,These are really heavy and extremely industrial looking.
1.0,"Way too expensive for it to not be a quality piece.<br />The product arrived for me unable to wear and there’s no option for refund or replacement. I was aware there was no returns but the only reason I purchased was because it said refund or replacement available. The glue on the band was coming off, on of the cheek pieces stabs me in the face, and it falls off my head. I’m unable to wear or use this product so I wasted my money since they won’t refund me"
1.0,Doesn’t fit my wrist not sure how it’s labeled as a unisex item if it can’t fit my wrist how would it fit a males wrist
1.0,"Ordered the poster at the size described (24"" by 36"").<br /><br />As seen in the photo, the size was much smaller, irregular size (20.5"" by 33""). It is faded and washed out, printed on paper instead of poster. Apparently with low ink.<br /><br />I don't recommend treating with the seller in the future. This is obviously a counterfeiter/scammer."
1.0,"Thin fabric, shows everything. Returned"
1.0,Zipper defective
1.0,ordered this over a month ago and still says it will be another 2 months before it gets here. I have ordered motorcycle and car parts from Japan and China and it was here in 4 days.<br /><br />After zooming in on the picture and reading more reviews the words are spelled wrong. The 101st is 101BT and the M is missing in the word screaming
1.0,"It has no stretch, the sizing is off, the mask isn’t hard shell it’s flat rubber!<br />I’m usually a M and got a L just besucase I wanted the extra space and it didn’t fit.<br />I tried to exchange it and they don’t accept returns!<br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1.0,"This came up under my ""100% cotton"" search. The listing doesn't have what type of material. The shirt does not state what material it's made out of, which is illegal in the US.  It's a high percentage (at least 60%)."
1.0,a necklace of very poor quality the first day I wore it broke'm very disappointed Product
1.0,"This fit as expected, but the material is awful and entirely impractical as a swim cover up - it’s almost linen-like. It arrived very wrinkled and needs to be ironed, is not machine washable, and needs to be hung dry. Style was cute but this just doesn’t work for its intended purpose."
1.0,"Don’t buy this. I ordered an xl and is barely a small. Extremely poor quality , so very terrible that it looks like it’s been worn before"
1.0,It broke after wearing it for approximately one hour.
1.0,"This jacket is extremely warm and the colors are so cute. It came pretty dirty though with some black streaks on the inner lining. The care tag was all in Chinese, so I looked at the Amazon listing which says machine washable. I threw it into the laundry machine and it came out with the stitching coming apart on the arms- there’s literally a hole now and I can put my fingers through to touch the inside of the lining. The stitching on the bodice is loosened as well, and I’m not even sure how well it will hold up with normal wear. Although I’m in love with the colors, I’m totally disappointed in this jacket. I was hoping to have my son wear this during the winter, but I’ll have to keep searching for a durable winter jacket."
1.0,is much smaller then the pic
1.0,Didn't look the way I was expecting it to look.
1.0,"Way too short, very itchy, and the straps on the shoulders wouldn’t stay put. Maybe a good dress for a skinny petite person."
1.0,i hates this case the charging and mic port were hard to get to ringer dosent work and the case was bad
1.0,To big for adult and kid
1.0,Crown of cap extra tall!
1.0,The title is all the information you need.
1.0,"The hook doesn't work well, and the space in which to slide in the bags is tiny.  Would not order again."
1.0,I fell in love with these boots as I was reading reviews for them and knew I had to own them! I waited close to 7 days for them and was thrilled when I pulled them out of the box. What a gorgeous Cognac color and they were so soft! Unfortunately the first night I wore them I noticed the &#34;leather&#34; was peeling off of the boot right by the ankle buckle strap!! These are cheap boots but now I will just use them at work behind a bar.. Next time I'll spend the extra money for real leather riding boots!
1.0,"The Item is well made and exactly as shown. The size however is not even close, I ordered and received a large which is supposed to fit up to a 42 waist. It would not even fit my daughters 26 inch waist. Measured it would fit a 24 inch waist but be very tight. Because its such a well made item my plan is to cut off the buckles and have attached onto a leather belt."
1.0,"No good. The straps fit in an awkward way around the arms, and the loops didn't break apart but the tiny piece of fabric holding the loop to the shirt came right off due to poor stitching. Awful waste of money. I'm going to remove the straps on mine and do a little stitching myself, to try to cut my losses."
1.0,"It was huge, but I really wanted to like it, so I washed and dried it (making it unreturnable) and it's still huge.  It looks like a sloppy night gown and after only 1 wash it's all pilly.  Also fits bizarrely around the bust.  The dress is huge, and I'm a A cup, so I cannot understand why 2 inches of my bra are exposed in front of my armpit on either side..."
1.0,Terrible fit and design
1.0,Very low quality fabric and it was like the dress was not done right
1.0,Very inexpensive so didn't have high expectations. Twenty days in it just stopped working. Reset stem several times and pressed all buttons with no response from it. Dead battery? I don't know. Hate to even hassle with return but will. Maybe my bad luck but I feel it needs the comment.<br /><br />Charlie
1.0,Horrible they were broken I ordered replacement they were broken as well.
1.0,"Ordered L, what I got is between S and M, very tight on me, specifically the mesh part at the end. I still wore them for a couple hours and the material at the bottom rubbed my thighs raw! 100% would’ve returned them but missed the return window. So mad. So disappointed. Please don’t buy them!"
1.0,"Gift for my nephew.  Seams ripped apart, cheap material & thinly sewed to start with.  Returning for refund."
1.0,Returned because they came very discolored. Was very disappointed with the product received.
1.0,Got it for my niece for prom... Ordered accordingly for correct  size and it was still too small/no support.  No lift.
1.0,looks different in person and isnt sized correctly
1.0,Very plasticky not impressed at all..very cheap looking .
1.0,"The description says 100% Polyester but the shirt I received, while it looks the same, is cotton.  I think I got the wrong shirt?"
1.0,I didn't like the fact that it has a drawstring on the top of it and is really tight fitting even when the drawstring is all the way loose it's still digs into your face and irritates. It did not say in the pictures or description that it had a pull drawstring I would have never bought this one
1.0,"The bag is super cute, but the hardware is super cheap. Clips that hold the straps broke within 2 weeks of use. Need something small for travel and fell apart during my trip."
1.0,"broke really easily, only had them on for 3 days until they broke. :(("
1.0,I was really looking forward to these but they came bent and broken
1.0,"3 sizes too large. She wears an 8.5, I ordered an 8.5, they sent an 8.5women/6.5 men. They were HUGE. returning. Got crocs, mor expensive but correct size."
1.0,"I loved these until one of the screws came out.  A few days after I put in a replacement screw, the whole arm broke off.  The problem appears to be the extremely light weight and cheap plastic.  Pity, I did like the lenses.  They were partially polarized."
1.0,"I received the rings on time, smelled weird and caused slight skin irritation. Cheaply made but the customer service was good. Refunded my money right away!"
1.0,Arrived with several missing stones floating around in package.
1.0,Horribly made.  First the pockets are on the boobs. Second zipper is horrible quality.
1.0,Impossible to set!!
1.0,"very bad quality, I do not recommend it 👎👎Not real gold"
1.0,garbage do not lose ur money on this
1.0,Loved the color of the shirt
1.0,"The most uncomfortable shoes I've ever worn.  I got them to work in the yard.  I'm now sporting a whole new crop of blisters.  I had to put in gel heel cushions in order to tolerate wearing them.<br /><br />When I took them off, my feet were covered in what looked like suds or foam.  Ugh!"
1.0,"I liked the color and style of dress but the quality sucked.  I am 5’8” wear a sizes 12-14, large to x-large.  I ordered an extra large since the dress looked like a pencil fit.  The dress was a very tight fit and I felt stuffed in it so I returned it."
1.0,These were way too big for my daughter and i wasnt too pleased at all
1.0,"I wore this anklet for about 4 days. On the fifth day when I woke up, one of the two strands had come off the anklet. Horrible workmanship.<br /><br />Hopefully I can return it."
1.0,Not even the pairs match in size.
1.0,the package was open and was only 2 of 4
1.0,They Wasn't the Size I Paid for I'll Stick to Buying Them From the Asian Stores that Sells Black Hair Supply's of All Kinds They Never Mess up In What You Want in Beauty Needs.
1.0,"slippers are too stiff and narrow.  they are mishaped, not at all like the nice picture making them look expensive."
1.0,"You get what you pay for. They feel cheap. They are cheap. Just invest in a nicer, pricier pair of glasses."
1.0,Gem fell out of body as soon as i opened the package. Has to super glue it
1.0,Did not like the color of the attached gems.
1.0,"Angry and disappointed. I wear a small/xsmall in clothes and am not especially tall (5’6) and when I tried to get the camel toe out (I was wearing underpants as well, so it shouldn’t have happened) it ripped lengthwise. It felt cheap but that’s a bit much."
1.0,Came without a buckle
1.0,"2 of the 7 gems arrived broken or unglued I should say, very cheap quality. The ones I put on my shoes 2 have already unglued."
1.0,The earrings appear larger and more substantial in the advertisement. So tiny when you open the box. You would not want to give them as a gift. Totally disappointed! 😩
1.0,Purchased in largest size and could not even get it over my head.
1.0,Fog lights<br />Portable air pump
1.0,This bennie was way too small. I bought it for my 12 yr old and it didn't even fit my 3 month old. I definitely dont recommend
1.0,No cushion whatsoever.  Worried my toddler would get blisters.
1.0,It was vacuum sealed when I got it and it reeks of some stench it literally smells musty it’s so sad because that shade of green is my favorite color but there was just too much drama with this purchase between the smell and how matted the fur was it just isn’t worth it I’d have to wash it like 80 times
1.0,"The mask is enormous. The image is not centered and is also too low. Very low quality, do not buy"
1.0,I want prayer complety.....how use amulet sometime?
1.0,This went immediately back. It was WAAAY TOO SHORT
1.0,Got a large size and is way too small. The shorts continue to ride up which make it uncomfortable.  The top is ok but really tight too.
1.0,It does not stay in your head!<br />Bad. Quality.
1.0,"I purchased a pack of these and 2 of 5 were already broken in the package (The rubber connector to eyeglasses was broken).  I sent an e-mail to seller; they responded a couple times, trying to make me happy and asked me to send a pic of broken items which I did, then promising to replace them free of charge.  I have not received any replacements yet for 2 weeks now!  I wore another and after it became dirty, I washed it, and that one broke too...these are advertised as hearty, but I have found the opposite, and would NOT buy again...buyer beware!"
1.0,"These are very poorly made, I wore them 3 times before the sole fell away from the shoe."
1.0,was expecting a little more to the dress fabric wise.. Didnt care for the fit at all
1.0,Won’t fit. I have Oakley frog skins (which do not have big legs) and they won’t fit. Notice the space between the stitching and the edge. Not sure which sunglasses have so skinny legs. I like the design and the quality but returning due to not fitting.
1.0,I ordered these for my nose and I knew the second they arrived they were going to be too short. I can't figure out what body part these would fit. They are the tiniest bars I've ever seen.
1.0,"Cute, but broke in about two weeks."
1.0,The seam in the back came apart the first time I wore it.
1.0,Whatever you do not buy it’s a knock off looks completely different from the  picture and the color is light blue not teal.
1.0,So cheap! Reminds me of a prize you would get in the bottom of a Cracker Jack box! Don’t waste your money.
1.0,"Hi,<br /><br />Although the quality of the boxers seems ok I am not happy with the fact that they do not fit and cannot be returned.  The legs are also too tight for the size."
1.0,Never received my purchase. Asked for a refund and they wouldn't give me one. Very disappointed.
1.0,Very uncomfortable in the upper body area the way the dress was sewn. Costly mistake! $40 to return to China! Ugh
1.0,I am returning these bands because they do not fit on my versa Fitbit.
1.0,"Didn’t fit!  Very disappointing, it was a gift!"
1.0,Wore them skiing on a very warm day and they fell apart. The finger tips had holes and the places where you touch electronics peeled off.
1.0,Made to fit on a baby head. Very poor. Will not be keeping this .
1.0,These say you can't machine wash them. I cannot be hand-washing my socks.
1.0,"The first pic is of the poor Weird angled connection from the sunglasses to the arm, the second is to show that the right side is a 90 degree angle but the left arms is stretched out a little further?  I mean what do you expect for 13$ I guess, they are polorized, but as far as QUality Control or maybe I got a return that someone all ready messed up, but check them over before you wear them.<br />  The thing is about items under $20 it's hardly worth the time and effort to return them, so got to be how some of these companies make money. I know I have a ""shelf of shame"" with ""too good to be true"" items I bought on the cheap and got exactly what I paid for and nothing more...."
1.0,Didn’t like to small and not good for winter
1.0,"way too big for my lip, the hand rolls around. and the back of the ring cuts into your lip. it would be cut if it actually fit."
1.0,"Had to return it, wasn’t adjustable like they side. The provided tool didn’t fit the watch band. Also felt very very cheap."
1.0,This dress was thrown together.
1.0,"Crap, gloves arrived with a tear in the seam of the palm. They are cheap (not inexpensive but cheap) and In no way will last the winter."
1.0,Beautiful dress but I could not wear it because the top was way too small. Tried to let it out but still didn't fit. I normally wear XL so that's what I bought. I was really disappointed because I bought this dress specifically for an event and can't wear it or return it as I live outside the US
1.0,"Definitely not worth $15.00.  It is well made.  Wouldn't buy again, and would not recommend.  Too much trouble to send back.  Chalk it up to experience."
1.0,Broke the first day we had it.
1.0,"It’s super cute, just gets tangled up within an hour of wearing it."
1.0,I am very small busted and am narrow around the rib cage area but the extra large size is tight and uncomfortable.  Pretty but the lace shoulder and bodice is itchy.
1.0,"The top fit very well, and was super adorable. My husband gave this to me as a birthday gift. However, it’s pretty cheaply made. The left strap came unthreaded on my first wear (within an hour maybe), which was extremely disappointing, as I looked forward wearing this to an upcoming dinner party."
1.0,False Advertisement I ordered a 6x and no where near fits me!! It will fit a 3x or 4x
1.0,"I’m not sure if these ripped when I pulled them up, or if they arrived like this.  I didn’t hear any fabric or stitching rip.  This would’ve been my 4th pair.  I have three other pair that were bought about a year ago and they have been phenomenal.  The fabric on these seem cheaply made compared to my others."
1.0,"I don’t like it , it too soft .<br />My shoes  fall off because of its softness"
1.0,terrible quality.  would love to give it no stars.  came apart in less that a week. Color faded off.  Waste of your money.  don't  buy.
1.0,Wow. I was NOT expecting this dress to be so cheaply made. It's unlined and made of some type of horribly uncomfortable crinkly fabric. Returning. Yuck.
1.0,"This product has not lived up to my expectations at all. I knew that I was going to be a tight fight because of the purpose for buying. But after I have worn it a few times I have been very uncomfortable in it. The straps either dig into my shoulders or fall off, there is no in between. It is horrible to wear while sitting. It rolls up at the bottom instead of hugging my hips. The zipper either unzips half way or gets caught on my bra. While wearing it I am always struggling to adjust it to fix properly. Instead of it flattening my stomach it just pushes it down to where it can be seen under the waist trainer. This is was not what I was expecting out of this product."
1.0,I purchased a large - should have tried a M but not willing to return again.
1.0,"I am very unhappy with this product. I purchased it as a gift ahead of time. I went to wrap it today (3 days after my return window) & realized it was not the 100% cotton that it is being advertised as (at least at the time of my order and as of today). I needed 100% cotton, because my son has horrible skin reaction to polyester, acrylic, etc. - not sure why. Anyways, the tag clearly states that this robe is 55% cotton and 45% polyester.  So, since my return window is gone (my own fault for not checking the label sooner), I would normally just use the robe for myself, but I don't need a new robe. Plus, I would never pay almost $50 for a $20 product. I am very embarrassed that I allowed myself to get ripped off like this, but I didn't check the label when it first arrived, because this robe had such wonderful reviews - not one person mentioned that this was not made from the material it was advertised as. It's also advertised as Turkish cotton, but I'm not aware of Turkish cotton containing polyester. Very disappointed. Will have to look for a new gift for my son. Thought I was being organized by purchasing ahead, but now I've got to come up with something quick for his B-Day."
1.0,"I should have known better but the elephant design was too cute I had the take a chance on the band. Pictures say it all, I'm not even taking them out of the box to see if the bands fits well... it's going right back to China."
1.0,Useless and not worth the money to return. Way too small.
1.0,Zipper broken 😞
1.0,Did not fit well. It was all twisted
1.0,The CDC says these are worse to wear than no mask at all.
1.0,"Broke in one use, to be expected with something this cheap though."
1.0,"No me gusto la tela, muy pequeño"
1.0,"This purse is rubbish, super rubbish. It is not as good as the description says. It's pale the quality of the material is cheap it is ugly and I want my money back .Amazon please take it off your website."
1.0,"Terrible shoes, not fit for working out. The soles are so thin that you feel every brick and pebble in your heels. If you were to use these as running shoes, you'd undoubtedly get a stress fracture in your heel in no time. The material that makes up the rest of the shoe is thin and bratheable, as it claims. It it a totally unsupported mesh that buckles and folds and rubs with your every movement. I tried wearing these shoes for a couple weeks to break them in, and they just as useless as they were on day one. I chucked them into the clothes donation bin outside the homes less shelter, because they are at least better than not having any shoes at all."
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THESE PANTS!!  I have purchased 8 of these and each one has been a nightmare!  Every single pair with the exception of 1 has arrived used with a pinned tag on them or no tag at all. Clearly had fuzzies on them from being worn!!  The material is cheap, the sewing is horrible, 1 washing of the only pair that arrived unused fell apart when washed once in cold water on delicate cycle! A Ridiculous joke!  And all I've gotten was sorry when I have to keep driving to ups to return because you now get charged to have ups come pick up"
1.0,"This is just a small 5"" X 4"" sticker.  Way overpriced for what you get."
1.0,The size is not accurate at all. I ordered an XL (I usually wear a M-L) just to make sure it was big enough and it fits like a small. I'm 5'2 and the top didn't even come to my chest properly and it was much shorter than pictured at the bottom.
1.0,"Didn't like. Too short, fits more like a shirt and it's see through"
1.0,This skirt looked nothing like the picture. I looked like I should have been trying out for a role in gladiator. I came with a million wrinkles and they pleats were all over the place and hard to iron. I returned it!
1.0,"Very disappointed.  Honestly, these are the single least comfortable pair of boxer briefs that I've ever owned.  Just angry you can't return under"
1.0,This is crap! The item I received is NOTHING like the picture-- it is sooooo short it doesn't even cover up my butt --<br />Silly.  I am in the process of trying to get a refund --
1.0,"Paid $1 at 99 Store and just as good, except for a minimal improvement in glare reduction.<br />$1 glasses have same 400 UV.<br />Wouldn't recommend.  You get what you pay for and this isn't it."
1.0,"Very oddly made.The shoulder straps let all the way out on a 4x cut into my shoulders and lift my boobs up to my chin,they don't need to be that high.lol Very small,I would normally be a 2x,I got the 4 to be safe cause I saw the other reviews of them running small,good thing,it barely hooks! The only good thing I can say about this bra is you don't spill out over the top like when your boobs are trying to escape your bra everytime you bend over but there's so many lumps and bumps sticking out everywhere else it takes away from that😞So disappointed,was hoping to have finally found a big girls bra.I wish I could post a pic but I don't see how I could without completely humiliating myself.You are gonna have to trust me on this one,if you have ANY body fat save your money,it will not look like it does on their plus size model."
1.0,My watch wouldn’t stay in the bracket.  Else it would of been super great!
1.0,Super BAD QUALITY. Just in one week got damaged. bubble at the tinted glasses.
1.0,Very bad quality I used once and it faded and turned all bad
1.0,The swimsuit was used and dirty. I can see the sands inside and also the white sweat! 🤢
1.0,"I cannot encourage people strongly enough to stay away from this product. There were other reviews that said that the band may not snap on correctly to the watch. They said that you may have to remove the metal plates from the old band and replace them on the new one. I read these, I knew this, and I ordered it anyways because the price was right, my old band had broken, and I was desperate to be able to wear my watch again.<br /><br />Sure enough when mine arrived today the new band didn't snap in to the watch. I braced myself for the annoyance of having to take the old band apart. I told myself it wouldn't be that bad, it was just four screws and I was mechanically inclined enough to handle that. I even had a toolbox with tiny enough screwdrivers to do it.<br /><br />It. Was. Hell. It took me two hours to get the plates off the old bands because the screws kept stripping. I finally ended up having to pry pieces of plastic off the old band to get the screws out and get the plates moved in to the new band. My fingers hurt, my shoulders hurt from bunching over to do this for two hours. In the end, yes the band is on and secured to my watch and my watch is on my wrist again but I will never again buy a band from this brand. Don't buy one of these unless you don't care if you have to work for it."
1.0,"62 size largest i can find anywhere. Fits, but tighter than i like. 64 or 65 be better for me, but can find any larger than this 62. Great quality tho"
1.0,"This is by far the most disappointing purchase I have ever made at Amazon. When I received it, i didn’t even know what it was. The material is so cheap that I tried to remember if I ordered a cheap scarf. Don’t waste your time or money."
1.0,Bought this as a birthday gift for my daughter.  She really liked it but it broke with less than a hour of wearing it.  Very disappointed!
1.0,"These socks are soft and comfortable; however, they started sluffing off with the first wear before washing. I was afraid washing would make it worse, so I returned them without trying any more pair. I’m not sure if sluffing is the appropriate word, but there was so much fuzz when I took my shoes off... it was terrible!"
1.0,"Fell apart after 2 weeks use, don't waste your money"
1.0,"Since I bought these belly button rings, I have lost a few because the the balls fall off and then the barbell fall out.  I have never had a belly button ring that has done this.  I thought after the first two times I didn't have the balls on tight.  I made sure I had it on tight this time and two weeks later the ring fell out again when I walking.  The rings itself are nice but I will never purchase again.  I am not too happy with this purchase."
1.0,Is not comfortable it did not fit as expected
1.0,"I wear these during 30-40 while on my bike doing 10 mph. Absolutely useless. If you ride a bike, spend the extra $30 and buy a pair of castelli gloves."
1.0,The chart say small chest size is 39. So I am 35 chest. So think it will run loose which is what I want. It fit just tight when you want to stretch your arms and back. the back feels it’s about to rib. Its thin . Not worth the price.
1.0,Didn't fit my Fenix so can't accurately review...
1.0,"This headband says ages 14 & up, but this is no way would fit a 14 year old. The headband just fit my 15 month old niece. Very disappointed."
1.0,Horrible and cheap
1.0,"Doesn't wrap around. Horrible fit. Im a medium or l. And, the xl was not cut correctly."
1.0,"ridiculously bad quality, cheap cheap fabric, not even stretchy or soft.  ewww and it smells, even after being washed. It has this faint fish odor, almost like it was wrapped with omega 3 fish pills.  GROSS!!!  waste of money.  It does not fit either,  maybe if you weigh less than 120lbs and are over 5'5&#34; it would look good."
1.0,This was gifted to me in advance of shoulder surgery. I wore it once and washed it twice (before wearing and after) on one of the snaps came off! The prongs are sticking out and I can’t wear it.  Very disappointing experience given how useful this could have been.
1.0,"After wearing this for not even 12 hours, my skin started to itch and break out in hives. Don’t know what this is made of, but it didn’t like me at all."
1.0,"Just awful. It doesn't fit and believe me I tried to make it fit. If you want a band you should go look for another because this one won't work for you. Also, you can't message them so you won't be able to get a refund."
1.0,"I always bought victoria secret yoga pants for years but when they quit making them I searched for a replacement and came upon this brand. After reading all the reviews I gave them a shot. I would not buy them again. They fit, but awkwardly. They are also very cheaply made. I wore them once and washed them once and they were already very faded and had multiple little holes in the seems. Luckily VS brought back their cotton pants!"
1.0,"I don't normally write reviews, but I was so disappointed in these pants that I had to.  I would give 0 stars if I could.  First off, they are crazy small.  I wear a size 10 and ordered the large pants; they seem like a size 6.  The waist is not very stretchy, so there is no way they will fit.  Also, it says they are mainly bamboo, they are not nearly as soft as other bamboo clothing items I own. I would even say they are stiff and probably would be uncomfortable if I could put them on. Don't waste your money on these."
1.0,"Chinese product do not buy it. Static to you body as soon as I put it on, very cheap synthetic poor workmenship. Fake front pockets to high for normal size person, on me it's near my clavicles, that's stupid."
1.0,"The color is not as attractive in person as it looks online. The material is scratchy even after washing. And you should probably buy a size larger than you usually do because of fit issues. It's more of an ""extra slim fit"" than just a slim fit."
1.0,cheap material. not the same as in the pic
1.0,These socks do NOT stretch as advertised and are just as difficult to get on as any other compression sock.
1.0,Got these to go with my daughter's Tinker Bell costume for Halloween. Immediately opened it to turn on the lights and see how they looked and they wouldn't come on. Battery pack is hot glued shut. Not sure if this is a product that had been returned and shipped back out or what but I'm very disappointed. I ordered them specifically because they lit up. I even tried putting in brand new batteries and they still do not work.
1.0,Horrible fabric. Looked nothing like the picture. The design was totally different.
1.0,So dark they are basically unusable unless you're staring directly at the sun. I can't even drive with them on.
1.0,The absolute worst shoes I have ever worn. They were like walking on a doormat. I threw them away after one wear. Horrible!!!
1.0,Bab quality
1.0,Ordered XL and it fit on a Small person
1.0,It broke the second time I wore my bracelet. Not durable at all.
1.0,"Great hat but the ball fell apart first use, I mean really fell apart it was just strings held together by 1 bigger string."
1.0,This company will not refund my money on a watch that does not function correctly.  Steer clear!!
1.0,Shrunk after wearing and washing one time
1.0,As a person the worked in the fashion NY industry... and For the brand... quality is very poorly make.<br />The waistline has no elastic. The shoulder sleeve end is poorly finished as well.
1.0,"For one this shirt is not the same material. It is a solid green, not a heather green. The image is poor quality and looks bleached out and blurry. It looks absolutely nothing like the picture. Don’t waste your money! I will be getting a refund."
1.0,Disappointed the material is very thin see through. I purchased this same item from another seller and it is perfect.
1.0,"Lasted 6 months before the inflexible nature of the reflective material chewed through the rest.<br /><br />Probably the second time I've had a shoe outlast a shoelace, and the first one was because my puppy chewed it."
1.0,I can't say. Ordered wrong size and return
1.0,was to small made me upset
1.0,Save you’re money this is a pos threw it n the trash
1.0,I use to like this product but lately it's quality is down to zero.  I purchased one fold away and immediately broke right in the middle.  Zero quality.
1.0,Not what I exspected
1.0,Only a few of the fingers worked for about 2 hours. Not worth the money.  Do not waste your time.
1.0,"I don't know how it was packed but i did not received this item i bought this together with other items, but this is the only thing i did not receive."
1.0,Didn't get what was pictured.
1.0,"It says that I purchased the joggers, but I received the top, and no joggers. The top is poor quality and I paid 20 something dollars for it."
1.0,Dress looks better in the pictures. The fabric for the sleeves is much too long and drags on the floor. The cut outs at the arm are not well cut so it gapes and bags around the bust. Not cute at all
1.0,"holy cow this dress added at least 20 lbs on me. If you have larger boobs and broad shoulders, it's a no."
1.0,never received eye glass case
1.0,3xl fits my size small bff...horrible sizing
1.0,Way smaller than i thought it would be
1.0,Very cheap looking! Wouldn't even wear it. Very disappointed!
1.0,EXTREMELY TINY and one of them broke while trying to push the handle onto the scythe. Would not buy again or recommend.
1.0,"Seriously, these pants are not curvy friendly at all. They look like MC Hammer pants and make your belly look even BIGGER. Yikes!"
1.0,the quality is cheezy and the dingly-ball trim looked rediculous
1.0,Size is smaller than expected. It cut of the circulation to my hand.
1.0,Arrived broken with stones missing and bent to the point of being unwearable. Returned it immediately.
1.0,"Don’t even waste your time buying this jacket. It isn’t cut right, so it looks completely lopsided when you button it up. Returned immediately."
1.0,These look so cheap. There’s a gap in the middle of the fringe from how they were put together. The deal really is too good to be true.
1.0,"The sizing is way off!! Order twice and still did t get the right size, my son is size toddler 11, which their 11 is for babies, then The next size is 1m which is extremely big for a toddler. If you’re going to buy these shoes get at least 3 different sizes so you don’t have to be returning then waiting till you find the right size."
1.0,Didn’t like how it fit her! Too thin!’
1.0,"My son only wore these one time and on the first day it scrapped him now he’s in pain and has a scab on his feet . Wouldn’t recommend at all, i ordered anyway after seeing a review about it."
1.0,Save your money. The fit looks nothing like the picture! Basically looks like a cheap sheet
1.0,Pieces were already falling off as I opened the bag. Much of it is held together with glue. Just cheap-looking overall.
1.0,There was no tag on this garment so I was half convinced they sent the wrong size.<br />Also- this material was thin and scratchy.
1.0,cheaply made for the price!
1.0,The fabric was awful
1.0,Not happy with the fit or fabric!
1.0,"This robe is WAY WAY WAY longer than the picture or description.  It drags a good 7-8 inches on the floor.  I tried washing it, no shrinkage at all, so it's essentially not wearable.  It's super thick, so you can't hem it, and it's so huge and bulky that it's not worth finding a box big enough to package it back up and send it back (they send it in a bag).  So I wasted the money.<br /><br />If you are under six feet tall, do NOT buy this robe.  You will be very sorry if you do.  On the other hand, if you need to buy a nice gift for someone you don't like at all, this would be an excellent choice."
1.0,"The &#34;purple&#34; tie is absolutely not purple at all. It's pink, magenta at best..."
1.0,"The quality of this product was not what I expected with all of the other positive reviews.  The brace felt thin and cheaply made.  If I rolled my ankle wearing this brace, I wasn't confident that the brace would actually prevent the ankle from rolling.  It felt so thin that I was afraid the brace would tear/stretch when I needed it the most.  The brace also ran small.  I wear a size 14 and could barely get my foot in the brace.  Don't recommend for competitive basketball, but it might be better for lower risk activities."
1.0,Purchased this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter. I got 2 of the same necklace and 1 with the heart instead of 3 different necklaces. Returning this item as it was not as advertised.
1.0,"We bought a size 18 month for our daughter to wear at her fist birthday and while other venders we bought 18 month sizes from fit her with some extra room this outfit was tight on her. We were very unhappy that the tutu is just a belt and did not cover her thighs at all.  The onesie was very thin and you could see her diaper underneath.  Also the lettering started to peel off at the tip of the crown and on the word Princess.  We were able to put a sticker over the crown so it looked like a heart was on the top and we were able to put some sticker butterflies over the Princess area, but it was not the look that we bought nor were we happy having spent money just to redo it ourselves.<br /><br />we planed to have her wear the outfit to 2 different birthday parties for her due to COVID and one family did not get to see her in the outfit for photos which was a real let down.<br /><br />As a side note the tiara does not stay in place and it gets tied on as a flimsy piece of gold fabric."
1.0,"Maybe it's user error, but I can't use this to save my life. I think this would work best if it wasn't so rigid and somehow you were able to clip this to your hair and then start with the braiding. However, I can't say I am a fan! In addition, I was given these in a light purple color!"
1.0,Poked my arm and not comfortable
1.0,"Fits horrible,"
1.0,"Very misleading! Off sizing! Beware! Bought a size 4-6 for my 6.5 yo bcoz reviews stated that they run huge. But holy moly, they’re gigantic! They fit me! See pic! What a pain to return. Thinking on keeping under boots in the winter."
1.0,I washed the tops and shrunk so much I cannot fit
1.0,Top was stretchy and soft but too large and too short waisted.
1.0,cheapest pair of earrings I ever seen or had.  Save your money!!!
1.0,Too thin and smells soooo bad
1.0,COMPLETELY SEE THROUGH!!!!
1.0,Very thin and not true to size. They are so big and sloppy looking. I would not recommend this.
1.0,I would return if I could .
1.0,"I knew I was not receiving a great product, but I give it a try! The print is not like the picture and it’s a very bad copy! Disappointed"
1.0,Very low quality plastic pearls. I m returning them right away! I was hoping for  better quality than that.
1.0,"My family is doing a Beauty and the Beast theme for Halloween this year, and I’m playing the beast. I’m planning on making a “muscle suit” and some stilt shoes to make me look massive.<br />To complete the look, I found this costume on Amazon. I usually wear an XL, and can sometimes even get away with wearing a size L. So, I ordered a size 3XL this time to allow for the extra size I’ll be incorporating.<br />The costume arrived, marked 3XL on all the pieces… and it’s WAY TOO SMALL! 3XL Adult Costume?!? For who? Hobbits?!? I can’t even fasten the neck piece around my neck, or fasten the shirt closed… WITHOUT the extra bulk of foam underneath!<br />Save your money! If you’re an adult, this is unusable!<br />Wish I could give 0 stars!"
1.0,Clasp broke the first time I put it on....
1.0,Runs very tight in the shoulders and through the chest.  Not for curvy girls.
1.0,Too thin..
1.0,The watch is pretty but the time setting knob didn't work.
1.0,I measured myself to ensure this skirt would fit. I have measured myself before for other orders so I felt confident I requested the correct size. The skirt was definitely an inch smaller than what I measure.
1.0,Didn’t like the earrings they were small and not wearable at all . PLEASE DON’T WAIST YOUR MONEY !!!!
1.0,"I bought two of these belts and the love the look and the apparent toughness (well made leather and grommets), but the reversible part (a very thin pivoting pin) broke on both.  Now I have two almost brand new looking worthless belts.  Once the reversible pin breaks, the whole thing falls apart."
1.0,"I returned this item for low quality, it has been 30 days and I have not received credit."
1.0,Too pricey for poor quality
1.0,"These are tight across the face, even without the filter.  When wearing the ear loops, unless you can raise the back above the ear loops, the mask significantly impaired vision."
1.0,"Very disappointed. Small in some areas and large in other areas. Where the pants are sewn to the waist, the fabric bunches making the pants look sloppy. I returned them."
1.0,"Watch makes an audible ticking noise from up to three feet away. Ignoring that for a moment, I immediately took this item to several certified diamond jewelers nearby and they analyzed black diamonds around the bezzel. Not a single stone returned as genuine diamond, they showed their machine analyze several earrings and rings on display with black diamonds which all read as expected. This was returned for a full refund, minus return shipping."
1.0,SOI never worked. A waste of money. Don't buy!!
1.0,Broken doesn't lock together
1.0,Material is thin and see through also runs small
1.0,"Very disappointed in this purchase.  Didn't like the fabric, it feel like paper.  Not a flattering look.  The crochet part is LESS than 1 inch ... A super different product arrived."
1.0,It’s like buying an apron from Dollar Tree.
1.0,The same thing with this shirt I bragged on it before receiving it and was disappointed when it arrived I could not get an arm in this shirt. I want to have this shirt if it is made in bigger sizes please send me the pink colored one if you have it in bigger sizes.
1.0,"Ok,,,,so I ordered the largest size I could took out of packaging stuck on like directions said and my boob folded in half ! Way too small !! Couldn’t stick it on my chest like the models did, mine stuck on the top of my boob! No where does it say it won’t work on larger sizes, BIG waste of money I’m a 40/42C"
1.0,This is basically a crop top. The tank in the product photo must be a 3XL.  I'm 5'4&#34; and a L barely covers my belly button.  I could get past the awful quality & bad sewing if it at least fit.
1.0,Prongs are not surgical steel
1.0,It is HUGE!!! At least 3-4 sizes too big. Returning
1.0,Looks nothing like photo.
1.0,Terrible color! Cheap bright orange and not at all like the pic. I usually wear M-L. Got large so it would be flowy and couldn't get it over my chest. Awful cheap and ugly. Need to return.
1.0,barely had it for a week and it broke
1.0,"This thing is like a tent that you wear, it fits terribly and hangs off of you like it's soaking wet. Tight only around the stomach and the rest is baggy, and the sleeves look ridiculous. Waste of money."
1.0,Quality poor ! You can see every thing that should be left to the imagination
1.0,"this watch was a poor buy,<br />The glass  fell off for no raison<br />while travelling in Europe."
1.0,This is an example of people ripping people off. Its a piece of foam.  Totally wrong
1.0,ONE SIZE ONLY! I would not recommend this to short or flat chested individuals. Product arrived quickly and in good condition.
1.0,People say order size up - I’d say order ur size or down this was monstrous and what look like a knock off of the picture not satisfied at all
1.0,"Sizing is way off-I’m a M/L and ordered an XL to have some comfy wiggle room. First off, I could hardly get my little head through the head opening (and I wear kids hats), then it has these weird cuffs that extend almost to my elbows and are extremely tight. The body of it fit like a medium. Length is as shown, I’m 5’8” and it hit me in the same spots. The fabric is a weird shiny almost satiny sweatshirt material, and as a previous reviewer said, wine is actually bright solid red (I thought there were little black flecks mixed in on the photos). I wouldn’t buy it again unfortunately because it is really cute, just extremely uncomfortable in my opinion.  I won’t mention that it took a month to receive it after I placed the order."
1.0,This is a piece of junk.  I can't believe I had to pay for this item.  I could have made a better hat myself.
1.0,I was expecting something that would cling.  That was not the case at all.  It's way too large and no tag to tell me if it's even the correct size. I'd return if I could. It's so large it gives no shape to my body at all
1.0,Poor!!!<br />The earrings were broken upon opening the package
1.0,"My husband is not a small guy at all and he can not wear this hat, as he is not an ogre."
1.0,If you are looking for a cozy sleeper do not buy this one. It would be adorable in a different fabric.<br />I am donating it to Goodwill.
1.0,PIECE OF JUNK
1.0,Very poor quality. Buttons are loosely sewn on and button holes have many loose threads. Fabric is also of a very cheap quality.
1.0,"Horrible fit, the panels are crooked. don't waste your money, very expensive for what it is."
1.0,"This dog pendant is huge. The photos make it look smaller than it is. I’ll definitely never wear it, and there are lots of hoops to jump through for a return (including paying for shipping). I wouldn’t recommend it unless you want a $10 hub cap looking thing around your neck."
1.0,I'm 5'2 and 110 but with a very athletic body and thick thighs. I can only get them about halfway up my thigh and the band cuts into my leg. Speaking of which I ordered the tights with the solid black band (double and triple checked) but was sent the design with the lace band. On top of that the band itself is very thin and barely noticeable. I was looking for a thicker band to complete the look of a costume. No way I can use these.
1.0,Did not like it. Didn't look like the picture and fit is off.
1.0,The augmentation in this picture makes this piece look much chunkier than it really is. The earrings are chintzy  looking so I gave them to a child ho can play grown up with them. I still do not know if I'll wear the necklace. All in all a waste of money
1.0,"I like it because it’s covering and  protecting my glasses. But it not secured enough, it came  off and lost 1 cover already."
1.0,"The photos of this tankini are so cute, but in reality this is one of ugliest swimsuits! It will NEVER be worn outside of my backyard!"
1.0,Couldn't see at all at night.
1.0,"Do they help with glare, sure a little.  But these are not polarize as stated in description.  Not recommended and good luck getting a hold of someone who cares to fix the problem"
1.0,"Even after reading the reviews I still ordered in the hopes the company had read the reviews and fixed their problem. Nope. I got the exact same earring for both sides so they look weird AND mine are waaaay smaller than anything pictured. It’s my own fault for purchasing after seeing everyone else’s issues but still, very disappointed."
1.0,Cheaply made. Loose threads and already fallig apart after a few washes. Dont buy unless looking for something to wear one time and toss. Hopefully i just got a bad pair and this is not the norm.
1.0,"The design of this seems simplistic enough, but the issue is the screw doesn’t lock in place. It constantly unscrews itself just from the strap twisting itself."
1.0,"The pattern shown on the dress I received does not match what is shown on the model. It is similar, but the pattern is definitely different (the waist area really gives it away) and the color doesn't match either. As for the fit, I agree with the other reviewers with larger chests that the stretchy button loops don't work well. The waist was too big while my boobs looked like they were busting out. The length was right at the floor for me, so it would have worked well with heels. For reference, I am 5'2"" 130lbs 32F."
1.0,To sharp. And it’s Hurting my wrist. I am not werinig them.
1.0,Terrible product. Never worked right. Sent it back!
1.0,"Jacket felt great and had a flattering fit. At first it was an excellent purchase. But it says it can be washed, however after I washed the jacket it was no longer waterproof, it soaked up water. I was soaked and frustrated."
1.0,"I purchased this not thinking about the sizing, I started to sized it only to have the needle from the tool break. They have a back up only for the needle to now bend and I’m afraid to proceed because it may break again"
1.0,Took forever to come in. Were pretty. Wore them 2-3 times before they broke.
1.0,Wtf plastic!!! I though it would be like a bead type bracelet. Good present for A teenager NOT a grown woman.
1.0,Pros:<br />- good for one time use I guess (considering Halloween)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- non stretchable<br />- cheap material for $39.00 (not worth it)<br />- this is item isn’t returnable or replaceable<br />- if you have big hips and big butt (stay away)<br />- RUNS SMALL!! 1-2 size up if you are desperate to have the costume
1.0,"The material is so thin.  This is a nightgown masquerading as a dress.  Clothing purchases are difficult online, but the fabric of this dress is so unsuitable, it's misrepresented as clothing you can wear out of doors I feel cheated."
1.0,TOo heavy. I will donate to Thrift store.
1.0,Poor quality and not what was expected. It was too light weight. I will be watching out for these people and never order from them again. Amazon I think you should cover my loss. You back this company
1.0,"These were so cute, but they broke in half pulling them out of the container they came in :( so sad I didn’t even get to wear them, plastic."
1.0,"The clicking mechanism broke.  The parts that they are using are made from very low quality metal.  The metal just snapped, it did not bend.  This leads me to be believe that it is not metal."
1.0,"Ordered SEVERAL sizes up. TOO SMALL! Hassle to return, trying to find someone to give them to!"
1.0,Even on the thinnest material these pins won’t stay clasped and fall off. Waste of money.
1.0,"Tela corriente, no tiene forma la chaqueta ya que todo esta flácido cuello costuras la tela es como lickra delgada un gran fiasco. No lo recomiendo"
1.0,Lower quality than expecrted. Not comfortable
1.0,Fit is way too short.  I'm only 5'8 and it didn't get to my waist
1.0,Horrible I just tried this on.  Hold nothing.  Do not buy!  I want my money back!  I wish their was a no star option.
1.0,Zip broke before it was even worn the first time
1.0,This dress is paper thin!! Don’t waste your money!
1.0,No way the posts are white gold. I'm allergic to silver and as soon as I put them in my ears got sore and terribly infected.
1.0,In no way is this tie gold. It is bright yellow. Would not recommend.
1.0,Not the trendy rounds I thought. More like Harry Potter or a Minion. DOO BEE DOOO BEEE LOL (they work so I can’t say zero stars! Just fugly!)
1.0,"Too expensive for what it is. Its just a small metal tube, not worth the price point. Its really small, maybe an inch or so long."
1.0,Poor quality fabric. I should have known as made in china. So thin and almost can see through.  I returned it and Amazon refunded promptly
1.0,Does not fall as pictured or like up correct. Made me look like I had one big boob lol
1.0,Very disappointed that when these came the arms were cracked and you could automatically see that these were a fake. The logo was completely different as well as the screws. Was looking forward to these sunglasses  only to be disappointed and return them.
1.0,I received plan b pills instead of the sock. I’m sooo happy my fiancé didn’t open the package.
1.0,Never was in the box with the other items
1.0,The size didn’t fit
1.0,"The cut is off. It balloons out like a tent. Otherwise, it’s cute."
1.0,Crazy small.  Like child size small. Immediately chunked it.
1.0,"I wish I could show y’all some pictures, but that might be disturbing!! I normally wear a 2X, bought a 6XL and it only went halfway around me, even after studying their sizing chart. I was really looking forward to this only to be super let down once again by China and their sizing."
1.0,"Runs small in waist, I would order a size up"
1.0,"Poor fit, poor quality fabric."
1.0,My son is nearly 2yo. Average build for his age. These shirts are really nice quality and we were excited to pop one on. But couldn’t even get it over his head. There is absolutely no give in the collar. Obviously no one likes an over stretched collar that sags. Unlike cotton though there’s no flexibility without tearing the stitching.
1.0,"Looks good, but feels kinda cheap. They are super light in a bad way. Feels very plasticy.<br /><br />Update<br />Very little use and the hinge broke. Very cheap plastic"
1.0,It was broke when I got it
1.0,Very small size wish it didn't feel nd look to fake but it would be good for a little girl
1.0,It’s a very  cheap looking product. Didn’t work for me
1.0,The clasp  was broke when I pulled it out of the package
1.0,Came with some of the gems missing and other gems that are scuffed with black marks.
1.0,Wish they told you the how long the pants were
1.0,"Shirt arrived with a hole in it. New shirt, with a hole..<br /><br />UPDATE<br />Seller contacted me saying they stand behind their product and they would be sending out another shirt. Never happened.  AVOID."
1.0,The crotch is way too narrow. Super weird cut compared to Hanes or Fruit/loom.
1.0,"I ordered two shirts in different colors. One is long sleeved, silky material, and long fit. The other one is 3/4 sleeve, starchy, and can't be tucked in. Do with that what you will."
1.0,"Product just received.  Looks well made.  If it turns out to be as sturdy as it appears, it will be a worthwhile buy.  If not, it is too expensive, especially when you include the shipping.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After 5 months, the tab which holds the product in my wallet fell completely off.  Very disappointed.  Since I bought 2, I'm hoping that the second one lasts a bit longer. :(  I was very satisfied but no more!  And no, I didn't abuse the insert - probably less than average handling..."
1.0,"my earring got a big stain at the first week,"
1.0,It's not anti fog. And in sunlight the rubber around heats up. Feel very uncomfortable . It's too late can not return it.
1.0,The size right but I received the Dress ripped on a side and I wrote and sent a picture but nobody answers me back..
1.0,"Way too large according to American sizes. I tried to return, but the seller would not cooperate.  I am stuck with a blouse that i cannot use. Disappointed!"
1.0,Don’t get. All different sizes none fit and cheap material
1.0,"I bought several pairs of these because I have multiple piercings and the price was reasonable and the size was just right for me.<br />The quality has been less than I expected even for the price.<br />Of the seven pairs I purchased, 3 clasps were broken, one set the clasp would not “lock”,<br />Another pair the wire connector was too large to fit into the hole so it could not be worn.<br />Lastly, one earring broke when I was attempting to open the earring to wear.<br />So out of the seven pairs purchased, six pieces were unless. Leaving me with four pairs instead of seven.<br />Most importantly, my piercings became severely irritated and when I removed the earrings the next day, the piercings were infected and took several weeks to heal. One piercing was so infected that when it finally healed it was “healed over” and closed.<br />*** I have never had any problems with wearing even the cheapest earrings.<br />****Absolutely doubt they are silver."
1.0,I can't put them
1.0,I have this dress. It doesn't like the picture show. It dyed after with dharma poly. Can't be wear any more.
1.0,I have a similar band for my Fitbit and it's lasted for years. This band lasted my daughter less than 2 months and she is not tough on her accessories. I contacted the seller and they have not responded. Do not buy this product.
1.0,i saw this as a ok from my teans order and thought it was full sized back pack when we got it i came unglued it is one inch tall and the same price as a full sized back pack... what a joke
1.0,"Frame fell apart within a couple . Arm came undone. Very very disappointed. For the price these frames a long time. I know ther is return policy,  Hoping you'll find it in your heart to make this righ! Thank you  john seese"
1.0,"The clasps would pop open randomly, allowing my watch to fall off. I don't recommend it at all. It is pretty, but not worth damaging your watch."
1.0,Pants are too thin wore it one day for a workout . had holes in the stiching ..very disappointed
1.0,Es una Basura
1.0,"It is plastic... I am not sure if i read the description, but this is not fabric it is plastic. I will return this for sure. Dissapointed"
1.0,the sizing is too small
1.0,The sewing on this item seems off.  The too part is too wide and it fits oddly. I may be returning it
1.0,The earrings didn't come with it. The pendent was bigger than I expected. Since it was not Prime shipping I am stuck with a pendent and no earrings. I bought it because I needed a set.
1.0,Ring is only shaped like the photo.Stone is very very cloudy which takes away from the entire look.
1.0,"Returned this. The fit,and fabric were awful."
1.0,I wear a size 18 and by sizing guide I ordered a 6x which still didnt fit... I then tried it on my mom who wears a 14/16 and it was snug on her
1.0,I'm 5'10 138 lbs and ordered a XL since reviews stated it ran small. My measurements are 36 25 33 and I couldn't even get it over my hips. It's see through and poor quality which I could deal with for the price if it wasn't designed for a prepubescent 11 year old girl.
1.0,Delivery was fast but product was damaged. I guess it could have been a nice lightweight scarf<br />Writing was not hidden it was very visible the moment you look at it. Which means someone saw it and STILL shipped it anyway.
1.0,Not sure if I don’t know how to put it on or the dress itself is not as pictured. It has a huge gap on the top/breast area. Will return.
1.0,"The dress is made of cheap, see-through fabric and does not look like the picture at all.  I returned it."
1.0,"Couldn't even try it on all the way. The sleeves are TINY! There's no way a woman my size has arms that small. I passed it to a friend who had the same problem. By that point I'd procrastinated too long to return it, so I gave it to my daughter to use the fabric for doll clothes."
1.0,Will not buy again
1.0,Dress isn’t as flattering in person. It was a bit large in some areas and really irritating under the arms. I ended up buying a different dress altogether.
1.0,"Bare as if just sanded so I’m wondering, am I supposed to stain these. Dull and rough."
1.0,Does NOT fit on the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge
1.0,"As far as cheap jewelry goes, this looks incredibly cheap."
1.0,"Sparkly, lovely, flattering; however, the chain broke within a month of normal wear."
1.0,ordered an 8.5 which is my usually size and it was way too small never sent back due to them wanting me to pay like $24.00 to send it bak why pay the same amount of shoe to send back for a bigger size.<br /><br />NO GOOD
1.0,"Ordered an A-LG, fits more like a Y-M..very disappointed."
1.0,It is not the same sleeve or fit as pictured.
1.0,Broken strawberry post and missing beads.
1.0,Small and cheaply constructed
1.0,I tried this out for 3 days. It did absolutely nothing. The best thing a person could do if their pants are too small is just face the facts and lose a few pounds.  :)  oh well good try.
1.0,Looks cheap and feels terrible
1.0,"This product already lost the large pink heart gem in the center, 0/10 won't be rebuying it. Don't waste your money."
1.0,This arrived damaged. The drawstring for the hood is frayed. Very weird fit and cheap material. Returning same day it arrived.
1.0,It's way too long. it goes down to my knees.
1.0,"Just got them & was excited to try as my night vision is getting worse,  i saw absolutely no change or help by wearing these!<br />Was Totally disappointed !!!"
1.0,"Love this necklace, and the service was awesome."
1.0,too small for my taste
1.0,This lasted us about 3 months before the strap broke.  Not worth buying
1.0,"Loved the style, and color,  But it had a hole torn in the seamless"
1.0,really good price for 18.... but the balls are impossible to put in the ring. I literally have yet to get one in despite trying for hours.. really really disappointed
1.0,No good terrible design
1.0,The surface has almost no gripping strength ... soapy dishes slip out of my hands too easily ... useless for my intended application
1.0,Just lost a set of earrings with these backs.
1.0,Washed it before use and my son’s drool made the blue dye run. It also stained a nearby blanket. He was sucking on his foot and the dye came off. Extremely concerned about my son ingesting the dye. Do not purchase.
1.0,WAY too small
1.0,I could put two legs in one of them. Way to big and I got a medium. I was so excited to wear them for a date night. That didn’t happen. Waste of money and time. The fit is not what you would expect. I’d probably have to purchase a XD for it to be a small. I would of given this a zero star rating if I could.
1.0,Four buttons broke when I tried the shirt on the first time
1.0,"These pants have already ripped opened, I can't recommend them !<br />Update... I like a fool bought Two more shorts.....they also ripped apart at the  rear pocket  cloth of  the short is so thin just putting your wallet in these will  a cause a rip."
1.0,Not worth the price very poor quality
1.0,"After reading all the positive reviews, I thought that these gloves would be great, but they are not not so wonderful. The material is very thin, it does not feel like it would hold up well, and the insulation is almost nonexistent. The gloves also are short, so there was a gap between my coat and the glove that let the cold in.<br /><br />Be careful with these reviews. Many may be written by people who got a discount for the item in exchange for a review."
1.0,No go.
1.0,Too pointy for me .
1.0,"I really wish a hadn't bought these. The ends are horrible for your nose. They are not soft or rounded tips.They are indeed a just cut wire. I really wish I could get my money back. Though cheap indeed, it's just not worth it."
1.0,"These pajamas are stiff, no stretch..and I mean NO STRETCH! And they run two sizes too small. What he heck? This is a name brand. I also bought 2 pairs as Christmas gifts that I’m just sending back. Don’t waste your money. I’m so disgusted."
1.0,Cheap material. Zipper was broken when arrived. Hard to put together. Came in three parts and picture did not indicate that.  Cheap cheap. Do NOT buy.
1.0,"I've bought many from this band and the quality is deceiving.  Same dress, different color and one is shorter than the other and the top area is too large."
1.0,the product came in time but was not as pictured... it was a chained bracelet ring but not the one pictured at all.
1.0,Need to return it. It's to small
1.0,"Runs very small. I'm 5ft, 145-150 lbs, size 14 pants, large fits like a 2x or 3X. Good material but see-through. Very long bc material is heavy and hangs heavy."
1.0,"I am 5""8"" and 190 pounds. I ordered an XL. It was to big and the photo doesn't depict the your arm pit area is exposted quite a bit. If that area of your body bothers you, don't guy the shirt."
1.0,Wore these for 6 hours under an apron and the pants were damaged. I wear this material everyday with an apron and never had wear issues.  My new job requires dressier pants so I bought these. Very disappointed.
1.0,"It smelled horrible!!  I washed it twice, got the smell out but the wrinkles stayed in.  Fringe needs reinforcing as it is starting to fray.  It was shipped fast."
1.0,Very poor product. It is unlikely that this is even leather as a thin layer of color has peeled off around the hole that I use. This has extended to about two inches in diameter.
1.0,product is very small and not worth the money
1.0,Jacket showed up with one of the sleeves cut at elbow length and the other normal length! So disappointed!
1.0,socks are very bad very thin and have a bad design itself seam runs through the middle of the logo and shifts the other side so it doesnt even line up
1.0,"Absolutely terrible. Small is waaaay too big. Cheap feel padding like cardboard, and itchy material. DO NOT BUY"
1.0,Way too much shedding.
1.0,The dye used is garbage. I've ruined a shirt; like others.
1.0,"Wanna be Crox. That's all,"
1.0,"First one had a hole in the side seam.  Second one had an unfinished side seam at the top, under the arm.  Both returned."
1.0,"Not a good product, received damaged."
1.0,The zipper spoil and broke off before I could get to use it. I need a replacement. I'm very disappointed with this bag.
1.0,Horrible flimsy and turns your nose green don't wast your money
1.0,"Way too small. I even ordered a size up, and it's laughably tiny."
1.0,"Almost lost a costly gold earring due to this labret post not ""securing"" the earring post. Earrings are able to slip out with ease. Highly do not recommend. Also, the shipping label for returns prints REALLY big taking up two pages. USPS would not accept it. Wasted my time and money."
1.0,Fits smaller than usual size. Feels cheaply made.
1.0,"The dress took a long time to be delivered.  When I finally received it, I was disappointed to see that there is a weird dye discrepancy from the front hem up about 6 inches that does not match the dye color on the rest of the dress. Even worse, the discrepancy is not on the back so it is obvious that this is NOT a design choice. There are also 2 weird lighter splotches in the mid-front on the chest area of the dress."
1.0,One of the coils broke when I opened the oqnkabe and the heart came with scratches on it. Wouldn’t purchase again. Poor quality.
1.0,Very poor quality links. Chain broke before I used it even once. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1.0,"The knot is impossible to undo. It feels like the lanyard has been wound and glued. Too small to slip it on; only got 3 fingers in.  I ordered it because I have large hands and it‘s supposed to be for men and women but it’s barely big enough for a child.  It looked so beautiful online (as does in person), and I was really looking forward to wearing it on my upcoming trip. I guess it’s going to take a trip of its own as I return it to Amazon for an exchange.  Hoping that the second try is the “charm “."
1.0,Way to small. Elastic that goes around the ears to short. Not adjustable. Do not buy.
1.0,"So unattractive and such a disgusting color, not at all what I expected."
1.0,This coat's sizing is offensive to all women. I wear a 14/16 or occasional 1X in every brand I have ever worn. This coat is marked XXL and is very tight on me. The sleeves are tiny. the hips very narrow. The snaps are sewn on right through the down feathers! So the fabric is leaking feathers at every stitch. The coat is brand new right out of the bag! Avoid this coat unless you want white feathers showing at every snap down the front of the black coat.
1.0,Very small and super cheap quality
1.0,Got the wrong product!!! Done
1.0,"the lens came in a hard plastic container--good.<br />the center connection between the lenses was twisted & could not be straightened!<br />the two clips on the left side lens were bent so badly that one of the plastic protectors on one clip had broken.<br />in theory, the concept of this product is good, the product quality control sucks!<br />I am afraid to order another one...."
1.0,"I wear a size 2 in pants and xs top, but this bikini is extremely tiny, it almost looks like it was made for a child, it does not even go up pass my hips, extremely annoyed and dissapointed."
1.0,Size ordered was not size received. Needed for special occasion and couldn't use them cuz they were too small.
1.0,Was not compatible with my watch and missed deadline to return it
1.0,Not at all what was in the picture. The shirt I received was very cheaply made. Shirt was also torn.
1.0,first time wearing this and the one should is about to rip.....so disappointing
1.0,absolutely beautiful<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LJ00Y38/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
1.0,it does not stick to your boobs. the sides will peal off.
1.0,Awful. The fabric along the seams puckers it looks like the inside of Dracula’s coffin. Hangs horribly not flattering on the torso.The fabric is very very light weight.
1.0,"It suppose to fit my Swatch model. As I received it and open it, it looked smaller and a perfect picture of a CHEAP REPLACEMENT!!!! I haven't even tried to put it on, dumped it in the trash can and made myself a not NOT TO BUY AGAIN."
1.0,This outfit is not a fit. We ordered the XL and it was WAY TOO SMALL. I gave it to a relative that is a small and it still did not fit. The proportions are not realistic.
1.0,It was very large sizing and the quality was not good. The screen print is not straight
1.0,This is a tobacco pouch.  WHY would you put cardboard stiffeners in it?
1.0,I bought an extra large because I like a baggy denim shirt I couldn’t even get it to meet in the middle to button it. This absolutely was not an extra-large. Maybe an extra large little girl?
1.0,I’ve tried to wear it to work out. I had to take it off because it made me sweat a lot.
1.0,"Really should have read the reviews. This is NOT a set of earrings. Its a single stud, very low quality, and poorly constructed. You can't even make it what it's supposed to be."
1.0,Very bad quality. Color was awful. The fabric looked and felt extremely cheap. Had to return it immediately.
1.0,Less that totally useless
1.0,"This item is not what is pictured or described. The belt I received is not fabric - it's a shiny thin plastic - and it's definitely not stretchy, let alone &#34;super stretchy.&#34; I wanted a black version of my original navy stretchy fabric isABelt to wear with my work pants, but because this is not stretchy fabric, the plastic slides around too much on non-denim fabrics, and the belt winds up migrating over the pants' waistline, even though my pants have belt loops. The plastic belt also really needs a front button to catch on to - otherwise it will float up over the pants' waistline - so it doesn't work on pants that have inner hook-and-bar closures. (I had no such problems with the fabric version.)<br /><br />The plastic belt also needs to be adjusted precisely - if it isn't, it won't hold up your pants, or it will cut into you. (The fabric belt, with its elasticity, is more forgiving.)<br /><br />I'm not going to go through the bother of returning it - it's serviceable on jeans - but this belt was not what I wanted or needed."
1.0,"I sent it back, have not yet received credit on my credit card.  Inferior product.  The stone fell out of the earring before I could even try them on."
1.0,"Half of these did not work when received, literally. Either the batteries were dead from having been left on prior to shipping or the casings were broken/separating so that the batteries wouldn't make a connection.  Would not buy again."
1.0,"Worked great for the first couple of wears, did not slip at all, now it barely stays in place. Would not buy again or recommend."
1.0,Entirely too wide! This house slipper is meant for an elephant's foot
1.0,The bands are too heavy not what I thought it would be too heavy for my wrist.
1.0,"Loved the picture on Amazon,  the earrings were a huge disappointment.<br />Completely white, no color at all"
1.0,This is awful I ordered a xxl and I normally just wear larg or extra large this jacket although nice can only fit my 9 year old granddaughter I'm very disappointed as I ordered it to match some sneakers I brought very disappointed
1.0,"If I could give this purse zero, I would.  It doesn't really deserve 1 star.  I am going to return it.  The zippers are so cheap that I couldn't open them.  After a considerable struggle I managed to get one of them open but then couldn't close it again.  There are numerous zippers and none of them work.  I don't know how this company has nerve enough to sell this bag and I don't understand how it got so many positive reviews.  Perhaps some are made with good zippers and some with cheap ones.  I bought another purse a few months ago from Amazon which is also low in cost but is fabulous!. It is by Soyater and is described as a nylon crossbody handbag.  It is very similar in style to the one I'm reviewing.  Check it out.."
1.0,Super Cheap  Material I will not buy clothes here
1.0,"This was a total disappointment. I am 5’6, 185lbs, 38D, and typically wear a 12-14. I ordered an XL and it was waaaay too small. Waistband was extremely tight, and the outfit was just weird and ill-fitting in general. I’m sure, like most clothes on amazon, it would look great on a size small, but going off my experience specifically, unfortunately they haven’t figured out what larger sizes actually look like at all. Additionally, the button in the back was missing, so not only was this item not the size it was marked, it was also damaged right out of the package. Not cool at all."
1.0,This outfit runs really small seems like it's not for adults if it for kids but it's really cute
1.0,this dress is probably for children I'm size 6 and there is no way I can wear the dress size M waste of my time
1.0,"Ok. What the freak. Just Google how to spell English works. Instead of saying Sleep, Eat, Play.<br />We don't know what the hell they were spelling..a letter wrong in every word on the bottom. NICE TRY."
1.0,Pretty but those little side hooks don't help it stay on.
1.0,Poor quality and completely seethrough. I had to return it!
1.0,I bought this a size too big and it was way too small! Total waste of money. Had to give it away.
1.0,"These glasses are very nice looking and are wonderful when you first get them.  BUT, in a very short time, the side piece that goes over your ear will break.  It is made in two plastic segments, and the piece of plastic that breaks off, cannot be fixed.  Thus, they are useless and go into the trash.  I have replaced these glasses FOUR times, and they are not cheap, since I could buy readers in the Dollar Store for a dollar!  But I got these because I wanted really good ones that were sturdy and better made.  FOUR TIMES, the same thing has happened, with the side piece breaking off, and I keep them in a case!  I am VERY displeased with this brand, and I will never buy them again."
1.0,These are TERRIBLE!!! They looked worn after the first use and had holes in them a little after a week of using them (my toddler wore them for about 2 hours everyday at the pool) the JDX sport water shoes on this site held up much better. These are awful do not waste your money
1.0,"low quality polyester, its not even overlap as shown, the sleeve was short"
1.0,"The cloak is a mess. I honestly thought the fabric would be a little thicker. It’s very thin, so you can see threw it. Most of the fabric is just cut with a seem placed over the edge. The hood is huge. You can’t even connect it together because the clasp loop is smaller then the knotted ball it’s suppose to go over. Also the whole hood would need to be inside out for it to sit down on your shoulders how it shows."
1.0,update to previous review... Leabags has Superb Customer service. I had posted a review about how unhappy I was with the quality of my bag and a customer service rep reached and offered me a brand new bag free of charge. I chose a new style and they accommodated my new choice!
1.0,I felt the material was too thick for a crop top
1.0,The only thing that matters with a mask is that it works. This mask has an expiration date that is one year past expired. I have contacted the manufacturer directly. Beyond disappointed.
1.0,Purchase this a few weeks before a trip as I tried to wear it for the first time the zipper broke.. now the item is useless and because I've been on a trip I have missed the return window very disappointed in this product Will add this seller to my do not use list.
1.0,"This is NOT what I ordered , this is a champion and if you look at order it says BLUE 84 . The quality of the champion is seriously light weight ."
1.0,"Purchased in January and worn once....thought I hadn't set time correctly.  Didn't attempt to wear again until 3/27 when I noted it really was running slow.  Today, it stopped......so 2 uses and less than 3 months.  Unfortunately, it's not available anymore.  I love the style....but it's useless junk now."
1.0,I really enjoyed this item and wanted to purchase this item but it is not able to be purchased so now I'm sad
1.0,These aprons ar very small. I am not a big woman but the strings barely go around my waist.
1.0,The straps became loose too soon
1.0,I wasn’t sure what to expect with this item because of the mixed reviews. I ordered a small and a medium just in case the small was too small. I am 5”3’ and 135 pounds and the small was way to big. It was much longer than what is depicted in the image. Also the strap was broken when I received it. I didn’t even bother trying the medium because after holding it up it looked twice the size of the small. I am returning both dresses and won’t be ordering another. Very disappointed in the quality of the product.
1.0,Fit is terrible for a small to big
1.0,Fits better for a child
1.0,Me encantó la bolsa el modelo está muy lindo pero venía dañado y cortado al parecer con una navaja por el costado :(
1.0,"Stitching not sturdy... Would love to return it, but used the bag a few times. Oy..."
1.0,I did not like this product. It seemed that the materials where not as well made as other bands I have purchased.
1.0,We wanted a big one to carry towels and 2 life jackets for 5 grandkids. The load was bulky but not that heavy. The first day when the handle ripped out and we had to tie a knot to hold the handle inside the hole. The next day the other handle broke in the same way pulling the eyelet out of the bag. Pretty disappointing.
1.0,It broke the second day she wore it. She loves it but she just can't wear it.
1.0,"Muy mala experiencia, pedí un tamaño y me enviaron dos  en tallas más grande de lo que pedí!"
1.0,Beautiful but turned finger green :(
1.0,The wood pegs will not go through my ears
1.0,One of the lens came out the first time I wore them!  I was able to put it back in.  But it will pop back out very easily while even putting them on.
1.0,"Nice watch & I loved the owl, but the band came off right away.  I have to make the little hole the metal thing fits in deeper to hold better. It keeps time!"
1.0,is too small
1.0,Pésima calidad hasta la fecha de hoy puedo usarlos xq.Nunk le quedaron a mi Garmin porque las correas son duras
1.0,"Cheap textile, looks terrible"
1.0,"Not the correct color...not dark grey!!! I can still work with the glasses though, they are nice but not the color I was looking for."
1.0,Handle broke when we assembled it.
1.0,I received this beautiful bracelet but unfortunately two of the beads are cracked and missing on the string I am going through chemotherapy and this was recommended to me and it was so beautiful I ordered it with the lavender to help me get through my key chemotherapy and radiation unfortunately it’s broken and I can’t use it I’m so disappointed as such a beautiful piece but unfortunately mine is broken
1.0,"If I could select zero stars, I would. These were the worst flip flops that my husband has ever purchased.<br />My husband wore these around our house for about an hour or so, they were so uncomfortable that he has blisters on both his feet. He's had better luck with Target flip flops, that were a fraction of the price.<br />We sent the flip flops back, and received only a partial refund, because the seller said that they appeared &#34;used&#34;.<br />I would definitely Not recommend!"
1.0,"Honestly I didn’t expect a whole lot but I most certainly didn’t expect this! The robe itself is fine. It fits and with some steaming the fabric will look quite pretty. The feathers on the other hand... I’m gonna need to take a quick trip to Michael's and get some feather boas. It looks like they took loose turkey feathers and glued them backwards onto the robe so the spine of the feathers are sticking outwards and the fluffy end of the feather are tangled in glue. Pictures of before and after to come. If you need a good base for a robe, then this is great! If you want a feather trimmed robe that looks even mildly decent, spend the extra money elsewhere."
1.0,Extremely see through!
1.0,One size does not fit all....I am 5'7&#34; with an average to slightly heavy build...these are way too big
1.0,"Either I'm getting really fat (which is possible), or this shirt is just not designed properly (which I think might be the case).  All the other 2XL shirts are big on me except for this one.  Seemed to be an ok shirt, just not the right size"
1.0,For the price I expected it to feel rich and be beautiful. Save your money! Nothing like the picture
1.0,Belt started unraveling a day after wearing Belt slides and rolls want me to pay for return
1.0,This shirt runs very big! I'm a small and ordered a small.. it's the size of a large. The design is cheap looking. Stitching is basic. Not at all impressed.
1.0,These pants are not made for anyone with any kind of butt.  They're externally short in the waist. Automatic wedgie. Material was ok.
1.0,"Fit well, but have worn and laundered( gentle cycle, protected, no dryer). The hooks for the band are completely mangled and separating from band. Very poorly made, wrong gauge wire for hook and eye closure, and 1 week past window for return.  Purchased on or about march 12, am writing this april 22.  Dont waste your money."
1.0,"The material is thin, light, and very pretty. However, it is most definitely NOT a neck gaiter. You cannot wear it around your neck. It is like a regular face mask with a long bib in the front—I don’t understand the point."
1.0,"Im 5’7 215lbs. I ordered a large and it fit fine. However, the slip is short and doesnt go with the elegance of the long dress. That, and the sleeves have a “long sleeve tshirt under  a short sleeve tshirt” kinda look.. not flattering. I dont feel like I should buy a slip especially for this dress bc its like the dress costing extra. Returning it. Not for me. Cheaply made."
1.0,"Received it bent, did not fit my ear. Didn't cost that much anyway."
1.0,THIS NECKLACE DIDN'T LAST A WEEK. BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER AND SHE IS SUPER UNHAPPY
1.0,Did not like this shirt. I returned it. It had ugly patches on the elbows. In the picture it did not show patches. Disappointed. It also was too tight.
1.0,"I love monogram necklaces. The style of S is cute, but the chain runs really long, is pretty bulky,  and overall- looks pretty cheap when worn. I wouldn't buy this again."
1.0,This is a cotton T shirt with sleeves<br />One washing and it is not wearable<br />Poor quality<br />Not even a dress that is wearable casual.A Big disappoitment to actually recieve this item<br />The material is stiff<br />Like all cheap cotton t shirts it is clearly poor quality.
1.0,Item is too large.
1.0,"Ordered a small and it fits like an x-large. Way too big, loose. It’s not a fitted cop top."
1.0,Bad fitting
1.0,"Be aware, these are NOT leggings; they are tights. Will be returning."
1.0,This is really wrong!!! I received 5 not 6 of the underwear. One of the underwear was in a ziploc bag with a handwritten note stating that it was tried on. This is soooo wrong!!!
1.0,Dress runs extremely small. It does not fan out at the bottom as pictured. It is a a white shift dress that was printed on. Disappointed.
1.0,Don't waste your time. They were shipped in an envelope with very little padding. Both pairs were broken when we opened the bag.
1.0,I ordered this in a XXXL and instead I got something completely different and way smaller. I don't think it would even fit one leg
1.0,Broke after 2 months..metal clip came unattached
1.0,This item is nothing a person would wear outside for 100+ degree to block sun ..
1.0,The size is ok BUT the zipper CONSTANTLY comes down and will not stay secure. This happens in all the colors. I recently lost 27 lbs so weight should make this too big now and same thing happens. An XL should fit a size 6 woman with 38 c BUT it wont secure so beware
1.0,"Too cheap material not described right, stretch material that did not stretch very poor taste."
1.0,I ordered this dress on May 6 for an event I had in July .... it arrived today 08/12 !!!!! And does not fit as expected  too big!!! I’m trying to return and get a refund and they are telling me that it’s past the return date!!! I JUST RECEIVED IT TODAY !!!! I will never order from this company again & Amazon needs to make them refund my money!!!
1.0,Got an extra large and it looked like small. Once I tried it on the images stretched and was see through.
1.0,"I was so excited to find these stylish palazzo pants for the summer; the description bullet says ""cotton linen,"" which is exactly what I wanted. Today they arrived, much to my delight. However, after I shook them out I checked the tag. They are *NOT* cotton linen, they are cotton polyester!  I am allergic to polyester, so as cute as they are they are going back. I won't be reordering from a company that isn't honest."
1.0,"This ring is so small that I can't even make out what is on it. The ""sunflower"" is a red tiny circle. There is no yellow, and the cross is barely visible."
1.0,Looks cool on picture but just cheap thin cloth not good elastics
1.0,I didn't realize the whole shirt was ribbed. It is not a sweater like material. I am not sure what it is. I ordered and XS and it looks like it might be a medium/large. This is being returned. So disappointed.
1.0,"This was suppose to be a Stainless Steel ring! NOT SILVER!!!!  Seller listed it as stainless steel, but it’s PLATED SILVER. Will turn your finger green. Save your $$$$$$$$ I bought it as a gift. Now my friend is disappointed her finger turned green."
1.0,made for juniors
1.0,Was to shear for me.  It felt like it would stretch out as the day went on.  Returned.
1.0,"Worst product dont buy cheaply made broke on day 31, go figure."
1.0,Cute and shiny. But the actual stud is way larger than I thought so it looks a bit awkward used for a tragus piercing and makes it so ddifficultto screw and STAY in.<br /><br />Update. They dont securely stayed screw in. Lost twice now within 2 months. Had to throw away because I officially lost the other piece because of it not staying screwed on. To big of a stud.
1.0,It was smaller than expected.  Smelled dirty when I received it. It was longer than expected too.
1.0,DONT BUY!! Not because the size runs really small on bottoms &amp; top and the quality could use an upgrade BUT because when you return they will say they didn't receive your return and charge you for it! It's a ripe off BEWARE<br />DONT BUY
1.0,"They simply don’t work. Went waist deep in a river, came out wet. Very bad stitching, can hardly bend the knees. Sizing is very off as well. Invest in better waders."
1.0,This was not an inexpensive helmet compared to others but the quality and attention to detail is very poor. The string that holds the suspension broke the first time I wore. The sewn material that the string goes through came unsewn the second time I wore it. I regret this purchase.
1.0,"I ordered the 6 pack thinking it would be the 6 colors in the picture (white, nude, black...) they're all bright colors and no neutral like I was expecting/hoping. Don't waste your money."
1.0,"I took a chance on this shirt, and was highly disappointed.  It was just not right at all.  Way too large and didn't do anything for me."
1.0,"There was a pin left in it it snagged my finger… of course Amazon doesn’t allow chats anymore, have to send it back and make an extra trip. Also, it’s huge, didn’t snatch me at all… size down a size. And the color looks like grape, not desert rose. It’s pretty ugly and badly constructed."
1.0,"You're getting what you're paying for also there is a strong chemical scent, almost like the scarf was drenched in gasoline.  Ended up washing it but it only made the odor worse, imagine adding lavender to s###. Ended up using it as a fire starter."
1.0,Shorts were damaged when I received them
1.0,Necklace is larger than it appeared and it isn't traditional cameo.
1.0,Ran small.. plus calf with pants inside does not fit: I average size. But without tucking pants inside comfortably.. why buy
1.0,These are straight garbage. Over stretched images on very cheap fabric. No stretch at all. They just fall off your face. Do not waste your money.
1.0,Cheaply made and poor quality
1.0,Not worth 10.00
1.0,Itches and turns colors quickly
1.0,"I bought this dress for 35.99. Based on the quality, it should retail for no more than 9 dollars. Dress lining was longer than outer shell. Sparkles look like a kid glued them on. Many of the glued on sparkles were randomly glued to the dress. straps were paper then. I don't think this dress could survive even a gentle hand wash. I think you'd lose all the sparkes and it may just fall apart. I tried it on, promptly took it back off and started processing my return. Oh yeah, the zipper was off centered and buckling. Looked very tacky and cheap."
1.0,"When the description specifically has “anti Fog”, they nee to be…..these are not."
1.0,They don't click together. The looks nice. But its a lie. They're cheap.
1.0,"Very small, very poor workmanship.  A piece of junk never buy clothing from China!!!!"
1.0,"I seriously dislike the material, but I have too much going on in my life, so I'll let someone borrow it ☹️"
1.0,Super cute in the picture. Cute out of the package. Feel the material. Ewwww. It's paper thin. It's sad bc it's adorable. It also runs a bit small.
1.0,The mask are very thin. Very dissatisfied in thin purchase
1.0,Mine broke almost immediately.
1.0,Ordered a medium and it's too small.
1.0,"The wolf print is blurry, and the material is cheap, cheap, cheap. If someone offered this to me, I wouldn't take it after seeing it in real life.<br /><br />You are bound to be disappointed with this sweatshirt."
1.0,"I usually wear xl, I ordered a 5x so it would be somewhat loose, how ever it is even tight on my daughter. (She usually wears a medium. It is shorter than it is supposed to be as well, it is supposed to be past the top of your jeans at least."
1.0,Super small!!!! Like crazy small! I ordered the largest size like 5xl and when it came in my friend who is a large and it fit her instead of me!
1.0,Not as pictured at all!!
1.0,The plaids were not matched in the front and weren't even horizontal.  So I ordered a replacement and it was the same way.  Find a different brand!!
1.0,not useful
1.0,"Bought these to improve vision while driving at night, but it made they seemed to make the glare worse and added strange reflections."
1.0,Did not come with any instructions or adhesive pieces to attach picture or picture cover.
1.0,My daughter didnt even get to wear them before th back snapped off!
1.0,Try Prime Wardrobe before purchasing
1.0,The poorest quality shirt in the market
1.0,"Don’t waste your money on this item. The material was nice. I ordered my size but it was a little too big; willing to deal with this. The biggest disappointment was I washed the shirt in cold water (I wash all my clothes bed wearing) and it turned black; however, the length maintained its integrity lol. So…as for future purchases, it’s a NO for me."
1.0,No; y no taína hoja de devolución
1.0,"I ordered a 10/12 for my daughter. The package said 10/12, but the tag inside the shirt was 14/16. It was short - showed her belly and was right."
1.0,i ordered a 2xl as i wanted it bigger for workout- its more like a medium- super small and the quality was not great at all...
1.0,"They all broke.. worst quality ever. Wore one of them once, then broke. Tried waring another one and broke instantly. and so on and on"
1.0,More like a t shirt. Not a sweatshirt. Very light
1.0,Sleave was missing an ability to hook through cinch.  Also very cheap materials. Picture better than product.
1.0,"Watches were nice.  One did not work tho.  So..  beware of bulk.  Hard to send Jst one back !  So I took the loss, ,"
1.0,This needs to be breezy and flow and the bottom. Instead it was tight and short. Runs very very small.  And the material is slippery. It bunched up and was tight when you sit in it.
1.0,I ordered a xxl. Not small.  I don’t like the material the dress was made from.
1.0,"The sandals I received today were the wrong ones, I just want to ask to be careful with the customers request, since we are paying for them,"
1.0,Way too short. It didn't even cover my butt
1.0,as soon as I put it on it broke.  nope!
1.0,It was flimsy and not what was expected
1.0,Not good quality broke as soon as I put the earring on
1.0,Too big could fit a elephant
1.0,Looks like you're wearing the hippo's dress in Fantasia 👎
1.0,Bought as a funny gift fir my meat cutter friend had it on his keychain for 2 days and the knife fell off at some point
1.0,Very hard to put on. The clips won't stay clipped on. Very heavy that's why the clips are not strong enough to keep it on. Its beautiful but on a table not on eat since you cannot wear it! Had to unfortunately return cause I really loved how flashy and glamorous it looked. Just doesn't function.
1.0,After using them (3 lights on three different dogs) I wouldn't take them if they were free!
1.0,DON'T BUY IT. Waste of money!
1.0,The fabric and color are horrible
1.0,I have a whole lot of booty and it didn’t cover it. The cooch area had lots of space and looked baggy. The style is there but the fit isn’t quite there.
1.0,Arrived in a manila envelope with no support causing the bill to permanently be bent lopsided.  Will be returning.
1.0,Shirt was way too small
1.0,Don't order it's cheap and falsely advertising
1.0,Belts are not the length described and one was so short it would be more suited to an elementary student than the teenager they were purchased for. Really disappointed since I had ordered belts from this listing before.
1.0,"Do not order this item, you’ve been warned! Very small, it fits like it was made without a pattern!<br />Looks like pajamas and made very awkward. The back was missing the snap, button or whatever was intended to fasten it. You will be disappointed! Should be zero stars...."
1.0,I received this band today...also had many scratches and I felt the coating would not last a week...too bad because it is a beautiful band..immediately returning
1.0,"I would've given it five stars but the first one I bought broke within the week of my son using them and so I bought this again thinking it will be better and it's not, he charged all day wanting to wear them and now it won't light up, not doing this one again, I'm very unhappy and so is my son"
1.0,It’s made for a toddler
1.0,It was nice but both zippers were broken
1.0,Hard to fit your glasses in!!!
1.0,"Couldn’t tell ya what the actual dress would rate as because when it arrived it was wet…quite a bit wet…and smelled, whatever fluid was on it smelled like rubbish."
1.0,worthless!!! slid off my head.
1.0,They didn’t fit at all I ordered the smallest size and am not that small and the quality is very poor
1.0,Doesn’t look nothing like the picture
1.0,This is nothing but a screen-printed hat you could buy at a truck stop for $5.  Does not feature an STP patch - just a badly done fabric print.  Material is so lightweight it seems like it will fall part if it gets wet. Just bad.
1.0,"Doesn't hold much, won't stay locked and cheap material"
1.0,I found something at Walgreens and was amazed so I ordered these. Huge difference. These do not stay on. As soon as my shoe was on and I started to walk it slipped right off my heels. Don’t waste your money
1.0,Cheap. I ordered a M and got a 2XL. Do not waste your time.
1.0,"Fabric isn't soft or fuzzy, it's slick, plastic-feeling and very, very cheap.  It's 3-4"" shorter than I expected based on photos and description.<br /><br /> If you are over 5'2"" and want something to cover your bum, don't get this.<br /><br />If you want something soft and comfortable, don't get this."
1.0,Cheap replica bs
1.0,Broke as i was trying to put it on
1.0,"Ordered this through Prime but it took 10 days to receive it. Upon receiving it today, I noticed it was torn under the arm on the seem. Very disappointed!"
1.0,Can barely get your arms out
1.0,Was supposed to be a 3X but looked a super small
1.0,I couldn't even fit my arms through the arm holes.  I'm 5'9&#34; and 140 lbs.  Material is cheap.
1.0,They are much lighter colored than in the picture and the sizes don't match. I got these plus when I was at a 6 gauge and they were way too big. I'm now at a 4 gauge and they are still too big. I'll never buy from this seller again.
1.0,"The bracelet is cheaply made and the engraving is even worse.  The engraving is very small and half of it was inked, the other half was not.  If I was the vendor, I would have been embarrassed to let this leave my warehouse.  I believe this is the quality of something you would have gotten from WISH, well before QVC took it over.  This was just a huge disappointment."
1.0,These were not true US size. My niece had them now cause they are fit for a 13 year old.
1.0,These are not surgical steel they burn when I put them in till I took them out.
1.0,"Well, the one good thing is that it looks like its picture.<br /><br />The seat surface is very slippery plastic, I had to attach a neoprene cover to the seat to keep from sliding off.  The seat is formed in the shape of a tractor seat, unfortunately it is much smaller.  I have a 32&#34; waist, proportionally sized rear end, and the seat is about 4&#34;-5&#34; too narrow; my thighs overlap the seat and the curvature of the seat's outer edges cuts into my thighs.  The height adjustment  does have an upper limit of 32&#34; as described, but when I sit on the seat it compresses down to only 27&#34;.  It is not worth returning but I would not recommend anyone else buy this shop stool unless they are a very small person."
1.0,The jeans in the picture is not the ones I receive and the mail really pissed off.
1.0,"Went by the size chart and I should’ve had no problem with the large I purchased. However, as always (it seems), the size chart was not accurate and therefore my 16 year old daughter has a new lovely off the shoulder sweater!!!"
1.0,"I usually wear a small in tops but because this t-shirt looked like a tight fit in the picture, I ordered a medium, in two colors.  The mediums arrived but were way too small.  I returned them and ordered a large.  The large arrived and they too are way too small.  I have now ordered the X-large and they should be arriving in a few days.  If these don't fit I give up!"
1.0,Not as described simply just another pair of overprice  socks.
1.0,I won't buy a dress from a company that has waffle dick ice cream in the add. Dresses seem cheap anyway. Just like your add.
1.0,The hat came all smashed and wrinkled.  It is also extremely small.  It doesn't come close to fitting on my head.  Would not recommend!  Don't waste your money.
1.0,Awful and way bigger than picture.
1.0,The material felt very odd like double knit or nylon.
1.0,this should have been 4.99 or cheaper. this is not something any child could wear unless it is a one time joke
1.0,"I ordered these expecting the same product I had ordered a few years ago. I wanted a sock that was mostly all-cotton. All those socks I had eventually worn out, but that happens and was happy with them. These newer incarnations seem to have a different mix of cotton and elastic. They just feel tighter - sort of like compression socks almost. And the worse part? They've embroidered their name WIGWAM in huge lettering across the toes. Now when I'm wearing them without shoes which is common around the house in the cold months, I'm literally a walking billboard!  Marketing departments."
1.0,Horrible.  The material is very bad.  Seemed as if someone just took scraps and sewed it together.  No tags or anything
1.0,It was stiff. Not fluffy as described. My initial thought was this was someone's old couch. This nothing even  close to what I thought I ordered.
1.0,"Extremely sized wrong, at least by 2 sizes too small."
1.0,One band is off its hinges because the screw has come loose. Look how the band is askew in one of the pictures. Has to be taken to a watch repair shop to be fixed and I can't be bothered. Will be returning this. It's a pity because the watch actually looks nice and is exactly as pictured. Save your money and time and skip this one.
1.0,I should have read this closer. Thought it was a traditional sweatshirt but it’s not. More of a thin polyester. Sent it back
1.0,Terrible. Not even 4 months and the internal string snapped. Don’t shower with it so there’s no excuse.
1.0,Really tiny! My pinkie nail is bigger than the hoop!  And there's no way to put the CZ on another hoop earrings. The only reason I'm not returning it is because going to the post office is a hassle. I wish I could give it 😈 instead of a star.
1.0,"The bust, torso size and length are not aligning here. Don't do it. There are cheaper better fits else where on this site."
1.0,"Belt manufactured much shorter than stated.  Description says it will fit up to 42 inch waist.  Normally, one buys a belt that is 2 inches larger than your pant size, so if it would fit a 42 inch waist, then the distance between the last hole and the buckle would be 44 inches.  The actual distance is only 40 inches, so in reality it would fit someone with a 38 inch waist, not 42 inch."
1.0,Not impressed with the lack of advertisement/warning - yes it's REAL fur.
1.0,Was very disappointed that the dress was actually a ugly bubble gum light colored pink and not the fuschia color portrayed in the picture posted.  I returned it.
1.0,"the material is very thin, the dress has no structure and is borderline sheer. I would return it if I had not already worn the dress once."
1.0,The material has little support and was very loose around waist and bottom of top. Had to return.
1.0,Horrible too big
1.0,Never got items
1.0,The fit was perfect but you have to take it off ever time you need to charge your Fitbit.
1.0,"Like other reviewers, I bought a specific set and was sent the wrong selection of earrings.  So I returned them and waited for the correct pair to come. Nope! Same inaccurate selection came again.<br />Not only is the selection a gamble, but some are misshapen enough to make them unwearable.<br /><br />The cute ones are incredibly adorable,  but I wanted a specific selection and don't care for the selection that came, even if they are cute."
1.0,Extremely cheap and thin material plus no stretch. I returned
1.0,"This jacket is not the same as what is pictured when purchasing. Material is not as thick as it appears in the picture, the zipper is different, and the caps of the sleeves are not as wide. Overall I am very disappointed in the product I received."
1.0,Did no like. It made your face look like a COW!
1.0,Both sunglasses frame broke within two months of ordering them. If you are ok with buying new ones every couple months then these are good sunglasses  I was expecting them to last at least 6 months.
1.0,"Nice shirt honestly it is, but it is see through and made from really heap material. Don't get stains on this, because they are likely to never come out, in addition to that it might just fall apart in the washing machine (cheap material) but it looks nice, but it is also kind of big so order it in a size down from what you are."
1.0,The white part of the shirt cracked every where after one day of use. Pretty disappointed as I loved the shirt.
1.0,"Terrible!  The fabric is an awful, cheap polyester that makes your skin crawl!  It was way too small and the shipping took almost 4 months!  I will NEVER purchase from this vendor again. Buyer beware!"
1.0,"The add is missleading, they choose to word it as fit for skinny boys and the pants are extremly wide!<br />The material is not soft either. I will be returning them."
1.0,Wrong belt
1.0,Material not what I expected.
1.0,"The size says large, it fits like medium. So I returned it immediately."
1.0,"The material is very hard, rough and itchy. I literally scratched myself up trying it on. I’m returning dress, not able to wear"
1.0,"THIS IS AN UP DATED REVIEW. THIS ITEM IS BROKEN ALREADY, THE SNAPS CAME APART. VERY UNHAPPY. I HAVEN'T EVEN HAD IT A WEEK. WOULD NOT REFER THIS ITEM TO ANYONE. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
1.0,very cheap too big
1.0,Do not buy! Fits like a choker and rips so easy. We purchased a few for gifts it was embarrassing they all ripped. This item is not worth your money.
1.0,The suit came with these cheap crappy white buttons. See picture. The large white buttons make it look super cheap.
1.0,I’m a size 12-14 200lb so I ordered a large.  Babbbbbbyyy!  It’s like a 5x and literally swallows me.  You need to size down several sizes.  I’m going to return it and order a small in both colors.  Will be back to update review with pictures.
1.0,It was poorly made for how expensive it was...very disappointing..
1.0,POS. I can’t believe I paid $10 for a flimsy piece of plastic with elastic attached. This should have only cost .25 at the most. Rip off!
1.0,I ordered a xxl and it won't go over my butt.
1.0,"I purchased these pursuant to the listing stating that they were a Cotton\Polyester blend, but I just received and they are NOT--they're 92% Polyester and 8% Spandex, a completely unbreathable fabric that would be terrible for exercise. Disappointed!"
1.0,The nose piece broke right out of the package and the seller refused to do anything for me. Unfortunately by the time I opened them it was outside the return window. Apparently it is a common issue with these.
1.0,Extremely cheap!
1.0,Came broken. Starfish wasnt even attached.
1.0,The chain was just as expected gorgeous..the only thing I didn't not like was the quality of the chain..the chain itself gives a cheap look..I think it should been made with a better chain.
1.0,Very small!  Good quality but you have to order 1 to 2 sizes larger then you would usually wear.
1.0,they’re almost taller than me
1.0,cheap and about 10 sizes too small .
1.0,get fogy
1.0,"I have to be honest... I'm not a huge fan of the fabric used. While the listing says it's 100% cotton, it is in fact not 100% cotton. The shirt feels like it's mostly polyester or rayon. Definitely a blend of materials. This is very similar to a sports shirt as it's very stretchy and probably dries really fast. The cotton, if any, is minimal."
1.0,I received it and it wasn’t the right size so I gave it to my cousin . It’s just Chinese sizes not U.S.Sizes  waste
1.0,"Received the earrings, and one is 1/4 "" larger than the other. Listing photo doesn't show this. I would love a replacement set that are actually equal in size."
1.0,It was cute until I put it on and seen that the Screen print was NOT centered and it was too small.
1.0,"It was great the first time i wore it but yesterday tried second time - it broke at the buckle part it just broke, i tried to take it out and realized it was broken . Sad because its great hoops and i liked them, wish it lasted longer"
1.0,"Positive is these fit really nicely, I was happy until I noticed the smell-- like body odor.  How gross! I noticed what looks like a deodorant stain. I'm sending back bc I bought these new and it appears to be used. So gross!"
1.0,Lovely necklace.  However the strings keep dropping out and as they do... it starts dropping more and more.  They were NOT glued in so... it will slowly fall apart.  If you somehow glue.  It may make a fun necklace.
1.0,"The top I got, while similar, was not the top shown. The cut is completely different, and the sleeves are entirely crocheted and wide. I wouldnt call this a top, I would consider it a dress. It's very long. Still cute, but not what I ordered."
1.0,The chains pop really easily..
1.0,The balls would not tighten up on either bars lost the balls off both bars within days. Really disappointed because they’re pretty.
1.0,"Smallish and terribly wrinkled. I tried washing and hanging to get them out, but didn’t work. Tried to steam refresh in my dryer. Nope. Should have returned it as soon as I saw how wrinkled it was out of the package. Will keep it for around the house since it looks like a bathrobe anyway."
1.0,If you expect the XL to fit you and you have a very Shapley figure do not bother. Not scaled to fit women with curvy figures. I'm a size 10-12 in jeans abs the XL was pretty much a small for anyone looking for a good meaaurement. The should provide body measurements based on the country.
1.0,Returned this item. Terrible.
1.0,Their sizes are all off...  Their smallest size is HUGE on lean legs. Very disappointed.
1.0,Very cheap fabric. Not what I expected.
1.0,This extra large is so small if it's a size of a medium!!!<br /><br />I already own an extra large gloves without the lining inside so I wanted to buy an extra large gloves with Lining.<br /><br />Love you so small it barely gets over my hand!<br /><br />Waste of time and a waste of money the size is misleading!!!<br /><br />It'll be a disappointment do not buy
1.0,"Don’t waste your money, it came broken and the color is horrible. It’s this bright “gold’ color definitely not the “new apple gold” as advertised.<br /><br />BUYER BEWARE."
1.0,"If you're looking for a dress, look elsewhere. This sucker is a glorified nightgown. It does NOT flow down the front in the imagined pleats pictured, but hangs off one's body like a sack. It really has no distinguishing features to separate it from a muumuu. What a disappointment to receive and try on. Thanks but no thanks."
1.0,"Was disappointed in the fabric, low class cotton."
1.0,"Poor quality.  Sizing is absurd; I wear a size 2 and the Large was just short of tight.  The &#34;lace&#34; applique on the sleeves flops all over the place, as it isn't sewn at the edges."
1.0,The quality was NOT Great.
1.0,Fabric is too thin and sizes seem to fit more of a girl then woman.
1.0,"Not a fan. The zipper doesn't work well and it's not a total closure, so things can fall out of the gaps it leaves at each end- I will be returning."
1.0,"Dress was great..<br />But-<br />Excessive material hanging to my shins by the front of the knees.. (Not like the picture of the item where it is fitted, ruchted and above the knee) .<br />Same color, cool and beautiful.<br /> Kinda baggy in the back area where it opens..<br />Doing a return because I don't have time to do adjustments and alterations."
1.0,Made my short body look  puffy and big
1.0,Wore once and all of them have seams that are coming undone creating holes
1.0,not comfortable. gives back ache.
1.0,Worst material
1.0,"Looks cute, however takes time to adjust constantly, gets caught in wheels, not practical when you are usually in a hurry to get to your boarding line."
1.0,Bag is nice zippers are flimsy; they fell off the first day😡😢😡
1.0,"It’s disgusting, i hated it"
1.0,bought for work since I can't have lip jewelest showing. Problem is that the &#34;clear&#34; is more of a white and stood out super bad. The flexability is nice but color is a bad choice if buying for work
1.0,I got these for my son to use with his Sans Cosplay. The skeleton print was peeling off the hands and legs before the day was over.  He wasn't doing much more than walking around and looking at things so he definitely wasn't being hard on them.
1.0,"I don't know what happened but I didn't even recieve them!!! Shame, they looked cute."
1.0,Not worth it. Turns green within a month
1.0,The are too thick for my ear holes.
1.0,The small is huge. Baggy in the arms and waist and chest.
1.0,"I gave this a 1 star as when I ordered it, a completely different purse of a different color arrived.  When I called in they were out of stock.  I know it has to be very nice as all other evening purses/clutches I have ordered from Amazon have been nicely made and as described."
1.0,"I thought I was getting TWO earrings because the description says that’s what you get, but I only got ONE. I thought I may have received a defective package, so I requested a replacement. The replacement also only came with ONE earring. They need to make that clear in their product description!"
1.0,"The elaboration (termination) of the socks seams to be very deficient and bothers in the foot,"
1.0,Returned these the same day I got them. The box was beat up and had the correct product info but the complete opposite inside the box. I was super disappointed. I will stick to buying direct from Blenders.
1.0,"I loved the fact that the band was vegan leather. However, after only having it for a few days, condensation appeared under the face even though I never wore it around water. I returned it."
1.0,not at all good very painful earing.
1.0,Design started peeling after one washing.
1.0,"Cheaply made. runs very small, short arms, I would not buy again.  I am 5'2 118 lbs and this thing will not button around my hips."
1.0,"We loved these sun glasses at first. But after one season, they are useless. Only had them maybe 5 months.  The lens are bubbly and you can’t see through them. You get what you pay for I guess."
1.0,If your truely looking for a compression top this is not it. Has some elasticity but nothing compression. Was so disappointed
1.0,Very small dial. Looks more for a lady than a man. Pass this brand by if you like big dial watches 40mm or up.
1.0,Its not silver . Silver is not magnetic.
1.0,The toe area is too small and the heel area is too big. Can't wear them and too late to return. Disappointing...
1.0,"This is in no way a &#34;Necktie clip.  The appearance makes it look like it will work as a push-through collar bar or ascot pin.  This is not the case.  Both ends of the rod are threaded.  Neither is sharpened to a point that you could push through fabric.  You have to screw one end off, put it through pre-sewn pinning holes, and then rethread the end on.  If you have shirts with the pre-installed bar holes, great!  If not, don't try this bar as it will not work."
1.0,They appeared smaller in the picture I did not like the size of them how big the lenses was
1.0,Too fragile
1.0,"I was so excited to get these earring because they look absolutely beautiful online. Unfortunately, I should have listened to the other reviews because these earrings are very poorly constructed. The post had fallen off the back of the earring so that I can't wear them. These aren't even worth the hassle of returning for a new pair (I'm assuming those will arrive broken too). Save your money and look for a better quality pair of earrings."
1.0,beware .this is a horrible bubble gum machine necklace! junk totally.
1.0,"Had it on an important key, lost it due to chain not being sturdy enough."
1.0,We received two different shoe sizes. Disappointing on Christmas for my daughter.
1.0,Terrible terrible. I usually wear an extra small and and the medium didn't fit.
1.0,DO NOT BUY! After fourteen (14) successive nights wear the headgear started fraying and elasticity diminished as well as pillow case stained by fabric.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:86909a384b36968d272b9e9513a2227f]] Don’t buy look at video I posted. Horrible dress don’t waste time or money. I buy clothes off Amazon all the time and this is the first time that I absolutely hated something. False advertisement this dress is nothing like the picture that is advertised
1.0,"This ring is not as advertised. It does not have diamonds as the tri-accent, it's the same material as the band which is not 925 sterling silver at all. BUYERS BEWARE!!"
1.0,"Cheapest sunglasses I have ever felt. Seems like they would snap on the first drop. Returned immediately, would not recommend."
1.0,They fit 'on' not over glasses unless you're Ben Franklin.
1.0,Sizing sucks.
1.0,"Clasp broke upon opening, cheap clasp design."
1.0,"didn't hold up well, most broke after first time wearing,"
1.0,The picture is prettier than the dress.
1.0,Broke. Cheap
1.0,Not useful at all the ice packs fall out and the sides do not stay closed. It was very bulky feeling and a pain in the b*** due to all the little ice packs. I do not recommend.
1.0,"I've had my dermals for 10 years and never had a jewelry top that was so heavy... It makes my dermal sag.<br /><br />Also, the post is extra short/small so they unscrew constantly. I wore them for about 4 hours and they fell off more than 10 times."
1.0,"I bought 2 of these pretty little rings. I wore one for about 2 weeks. Within a very short time it turned my finger, hand, and ring itself solid black. The sparkled parts remained shiny, but all metal turned black. Not cool."
1.0,"Horrible quality. Cheap and flimsy, I guess you get what you pay for. Don't waste your money."
1.0,Product does not work on suede. Was advertised for it....but it doesn’t work. It has left weird patches all over my pumps. I do not recommend.
1.0,"Ordered a large, fits more like a medium"
1.0,"Liked:  It was cute and comfy.<br />Dislike:  If you wash by the directions, be careful the decal may stick together.<br />Dryclean: a possibility, if you want o spend that extra cash for a shirt that only cost 14.00"
1.0,Set bottoms are too smal but top is too big. Poor quality material
1.0,"Doesnt cover anything, need a shirt under"
1.0,Very cheap material. Shorts are baggy at the top and right on the bottom.
1.0,I did not know when I bought theis Glassed until I saw how long it would take to ship from China.  Just a few days after receiving them they broke and I only use them for reading.  When you liste this stuff you should list where they are coming from especially when they are comeing from China.  I really don't want to buy anything from them if I can stop it.  Total JUNK!!!!!!  Why should I buy from Amazon again when you will not list where it is coming from?????
1.0,"The pearls don’t look like the picture at all.  They are small, cheap looking, flat sided and look as though they were “poured” onto a cookie sheet and cooked, then painted."
1.0,Material is cheap. It’s not a woven fabric. It’s more like printed onto the fabric like iron on. It’s also slick feeling.
1.0,"I am very disappointed.......I have had these shoes for about 6 weeks, the bottom of the shoe is broke, a metal piece is sticking out of it, and they are past the refund/replace policy."
1.0,"I wear a hair tie around my wrist every day and was excited to disguise it, but this bracelet doesn't do the trick. It was way too big for my wrist. Plus the hair tie kept slipping off of the bracelet so I would just end up with a hair tie and ugly bracelet both around my wrist."
1.0,"The artwork seems to be on a waxy piece of paper that the seller glued to the shirt. The shirt makes loud crinkling sounds from the weird material that was used. Also, the graphics were placed lower on the shirt, on the belly rather than on the chest. It is very unflattering. The shirt itself is also very thin and poor quality. Don’t be fooled by the positive reviews, they are probably bots. It’s a shame because I thought it would be a cool gift for my husband, who is a big fan of the Strokes. It also took around 4 weeks to arrive, so it was too late to use as an anniversary gift anyways. Don’t waste your time or your money like I did!!"
1.0,"The print looks great and I had high hopes for this suit.  Normally I wear a large in swimsuits I even upsized to an XL and it fits the waste fine, but there is no room for the twigs and berries.  This suit is designed for men with vienna sausages."
1.0,"The shirt itself is cute, but the print on the shirt is so thick. I can literally tap it. Once it’s washed I worry it will crack and be uncomfortable."
1.0,Low. Quality they are losing the tint on the lens already.
1.0,"I ordered the red dress and I ordered my usual size large it was a little too big I should’ve ordered a size down. I’m 5’2, 36C and 163 pounds. It had a little stretch in the bosom and waste area. I’m returning it because of the size and color. It is not red but an orange. Orange clashes with my skin tone and I was disappointed when I saw the color."
1.0,"I had to return this, the fabric was beautiful, but scratchy and unpleasant. The V was unreasonably low, and it barely tied around my waist. Really weird fit."
1.0,"I received this just before Labor day weekend, the pattern looks like the photo but the style looks nothing like the photo.<br />So disappointed. I should've read the reviews before I purchased."
1.0,thin and smaller than it supposed to be. only shirt and no short/pant plus did not stated in item description neither.
1.0,"I really like the necklace, the reason I ordered it.. . Why is it almost black upon delivery?  I understand silver turns colors if it sits a while.<br />I was quite disappointed to see it was cleaned to be presented at its best.<br />Paz Creations, any suggestions?"
1.0,The sleeves only come to the elbow and it is very small across the shoulders. I ordered a 2XL and it was more like a childs coat.
1.0,This was a necklace not a bracelet and it broke the 2nd time I wore out. Really disappointed
1.0,Got my package and the zip is like this I’m<br />Highly disappointed!
1.0,"Returned, they were too big for my face...seemed ok otherwise"
1.0,Not at all like the picture. Very cheap and oddly shaped. Neckline came to throat and bottom hem went to knees. Very strange.
1.0,"The watch arrived with a cracked face, and the watch face also came off as soon as I opened the package because it was poorly glued. I expected a cheap watch for the price, but I was hoping it would at least stay in one piece."
1.0,Something is off in the making of the dress. It just doesnt fit right and its not about size.
1.0,I orderd and received my shirts Large<br />but actually its Medium fit<br />Now i am stuck with theee shirts that cant use<br />I WILL NOT RECOMMEND IT
1.0,"Broken, less than a week."
1.0,"I made the mistake of purchasing this through ALICE AVE and not Tactical Supply.  I had no idea, as it was the first time ordering these t-shirts for my sons. I thought it was on sale through them.  It was an outside seller pretending to sell this same shirt.  It is not the same.<br /> It is nothing like what is pictured or described.  It is not 100% cotton, it is polyester and shiny black.  It looks awful and not as pictured.  It is a sticky fabric that will be worse when worn in the heat.  We thought this was a 'grunt' shirt and it is nothing like theirs.  We are returning it and never buying from this buyer again. Do not buy from Alice Ave as you will have no idea what you are receiving."
1.0,It's no good! After three days it turned!!! A waste of money! Really no star rate!
1.0,"Very very cheap, like a costume you buy in a plastic bag."
1.0,These masks don’t work unless one has a really big head. They fall below the nose. They would work if there was a toggle on each strap to adjust for tightness.
1.0,"I was super excited when this arrived, but I definitely should have sized up. I’m a 36D and saw the other reviews saying it didn’t fit busty women well. I don’t consider myself super busty so I bought my normal size. I could put it on, but the sleeves were tight, the chest didn’t fit and there was major gaping! Definitely size up!! I had to return them."
1.0,"I ordered a size larger than I wear usually and I was so tight. The fabric is very cheap... very bad fit, especially if you have a larger chest. Returned."
1.0,"I ordered large and was sent xtra small.  Didn't see label until I took shirts out of package.<br />The shirts seem fine, but they are too small to use. A waste of money."
1.0,Wrong size sent .
1.0,"Don't buy can't return b/c the leaf broke off from the backing and fell into my bathroom sink drain while I was trying it on, too bad b/c I really wanted to love these"
1.0,Cheap and way to small
1.0,Lose and fits horrible does not look like photos
1.0,item is almost black presented as blue size is wrong
1.0,"The cheapest made dress I have ever seen. The diamonds are entirely missplaced. Going from the image, which is so faded ot looks old. The diamonds are on the ribbon as well which I am not sire why they wouldn't even sew that on? I have NEVER had a problem with clothing I have ordered beside this."
1.0,The elastic at the top restricts circulation to my feet and feel awful.
1.0,This looks nothing like the photo that was presented.  It is like they zoomed in on the face.  It is horrible.
1.0,Looks cheap. Waistline of shorts not like those pajama pants or shorts with soft drawstring that's super comfortable. Disappointed.
1.0,Received the product and immediately returned it.  The sizing for the strap was correct but the over strap was way too large and thus unable to actually hold the footware to my foot.
1.0,If your a child its great but def. not a extra large for the average sporty shaped  woman
1.0,Ordered Men’s Large pants and the actual size is like an Extra Small...
1.0,"I really wished this product was made of better quality. I noticed a small hole on the side stitching after I used it, threw it in the wash and now the hole is huge, I have to toss it after one wear."
1.0,I wear an XL so that’s what I bought and I couldn’t even get it past my thighs. I don’t even have big thighs. It looked more like a medium. Either the sizing is really bad or mine had the wrong tag.
1.0,It had a tiny hole in the edge of the brim & was bent/creased/crooked from shipping in a bag. I sent it back. The next day the creases were all gone because it’s a foldable hat. But it was not the quality I had wished for...
1.0,The plastic lens was distorted.  Made me dizzy to wear these!
1.0,Lo pedí de 18 meses y es como par un bebé de 3 meses
1.0,Not same as picture
1.0,"Cute but it has no closure, so it comes out all the time and I know I’ll lose it soon..."
1.0,"I ordered an XL because I saw one rating say that they run small. Once receiving them and opening them I automatically thought ""They feel very thin and cheap.""  I wear a M and they were still too tight. I asked for a refund and they told me I could keep them, gift them to family or they would give me a partial refund. I would not do business with them. I regret ordering these."
1.0,"I typically wear a M/L in jackets, but I wanted this to fit big so I ordered an XL. The jacket fit like a M and I couldn't move my arms because it was too tight in the shoulders. Pockets are important for me to have with jackets, and this was one of the only sherpa style jackets I could find that listed pockets in the product description. However, when I tried the jacket on when it arrived, there were no pockets. Also, when trying the jacket on, I noticed tons of fuzzies coming off of the jacket. It it shed that much with me wearing it less than a minute, I know it would leave behind lots of fuzz if I wore it all day. I'm returning it immediately."
1.0,I loved this dress so much I ordered it in two colors.  I wore the green then washed and it shrunk by at least 4-5 inches in length!  The black did the same thing!  I washed on gentle and hung to dry.  It went from knee length to mid thigh.  Label says cotton but it feels and reacts like rayon.  Very cute dress but shrinks like your man on a freezing cold day!
1.0,👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
1.0,Definitely not as described. Not true to size
1.0,Was not the fit that it was described.
1.0,"It's fake gold, it changed colors in one week. From gold to bronze. Terrible!"
1.0,Ordered these and was very excited to receive but I was sent an empty drawstring bag :(
1.0,"Very cute sweater, however quality appears to be quite poor. Side of sweater came apart while trying on."
1.0,The first time I wore one of the belt it immediately broke apart and continued to break apart throughout the day. Super cheap but I guess that's what you get when you buy something like this.
1.0,Terrible quality and fit.
1.0,"Im a average/small sized woman and I bought a size medium. When I received the product it looked like it would be a sing fit for my seven year old son! I had to make cuts on the chest part of this product to even be able to breathe with it on. And after a week of wearing, I noticed it was making indents on half of my upper arm because it was not long enough. So now I'm searching for another one. I wouldn't waste your money on this product."
1.0,"The jacket is in Asian size, not American. The plastic bag has the size. The jacket does not have any tags that has the size or any kind of tag, nothing. Random size jacket in a bag that has the size you ordered written on it. Also, the sleeves have no elastic band, so they will just hang on your side."
1.0,"I ordered my usual size and it was way too small. I would size up at least two sizes. It doesn’t fit at all like it’s advertised. Also, it was really itchy on the inside, not at all as soft as it looks. I’m bummed, this shirt isn’t worth the $17 I spent."
1.0,"Honestly, when I first saw this necklace I was so excited to wear it. It was extremely cute! But the clasp on my necklace was broken (and I didn’t notice) till it was too late and the necklace just slipped off my neck while I was walking around. I had trouble with the clasp before I put it on. Now I can’t get a replacement because it’s gone:("
1.0,"These were perfect before they were washed. I ordered several pair. I washed in cold water and hung to dry on one pair and washed and put in dryer on low heat on one pair. They both shrank so much that it was ridiculous. At least 4 inches. My husband is ill, but I’d still like him to look nice. I returned all. They said they didn’t get a pair so they charged me for them,,, so disappointed."
1.0,Cheap Cheap Cheap!! You get what you pay for. Turns finger green within 24 hours and falls apart within 72 hours...
1.0,Cheap looking. I refuse to wear it outdoors.
1.0,The way it looked on
1.0,"My daughter is very upset, because the mask was not included. Otherwise , it would have been a great costume."
1.0,Velcro stopped working within 30 days of every other day use. Wish it would have help up as the part that goes around the neck is longer then others I have.
1.0,"Spelling is incorrect. Thought it was a fluke, returned and reordered. However, the spelling was still wrong."
1.0,Unable to text using them. Plan to return.
1.0,Did not get the good.
1.0,The bag itself was a bit snug..it's fits right under my arm pit..not much space it's a bit snug.
1.0,This top was too small/tight on me. I am 155 and 5’7 and purchased a medium. The top is also not the best quality. It is very cheaply made... I returned it.
1.0,Scarf was very thick hard to wrap in my head.
1.0,"Don't waste your money like I did. These were poor quality, extremely difficult to try on, they bend and or break very easily. Can't believe I waited over 2 weeks for earrings that broke just trying to wear them."
1.0,Such a cute band but you have to have some tiny wrist to wear this!!
1.0,"Omg, came vacuum packed. I have washed and dried and sprayed wrinkle releaser. How the hell do I get the wrinkles out?"
1.0,"The dimensions are way off. I have a pair of sunglasses that I love that are 56mm and these say that they are 55mm, but these are strangely massive. There is no curve to the front of them they are completely flat. They honestly look an accessory that would come with an Elvis costume. The nose bridge is so wide that it will only fit on my nostrils.  So if your face closely resembles Sponge Bob then these might be the glasses for you!"
1.0,These come loose almost immediately. I wouldn't recommend them.
1.0,Rings break very easily. My 15 year old daughter has already broken several of them.
1.0,"I’m extremely disappointed with this product because it doesn’t rotate therefore it’s not comfortable. The person who designed this product didn’t even consider comfort, it’s not a ring specifically for your finger it’s suppose to serve a purpose they totally missed the point of this product it’s for comfort and versus ability this product is rather pointless when you take comfort out of the equation that’s the entire reason this product even exists especially at this price point. I ordered my son a 2 pack of batman rings for his phone and they are amazing for a fraction of the price this product should have been all that and more especially for $21."
1.0,Very cheap quality and material.
1.0,"I am extremely disappointed with these cheap chinese made slippers. I wear a 9.5 and ordered a 10. The fit is weird & sloppy with absolutely no cushioning or support. Heels won't stay in when I attempted to walk in them. The ties don't secure on the foot, top punched holes are 1.5 inches from the top. The tongue is not fleece lined simply thin suede that feels scratchy. Lastly, the fact I will be charged $6.99 to return them to Planetshoes is outrageous. Their website states free delivery over $49. & FREE RETURNS!"
1.0,"very low quality, doesn't latch well, easily breakable"
1.0,"Don't waste your money. The print is accurate, but it's not centered and therefore doesn't look like a unicorn. More like a rainbow horse with half a face.. .not quite what I was looking for. Do not recommend."
1.0,All but one fell apart within 2 weeks
1.0,"An appealing idea, but these make the fly of your pants look odd.  These are not near as covert as shirt neck button extenders."
1.0,Very cheap product. Will not ever order again
1.0,The white was as sheer as tissue paper. Had to return.
1.0,"Very large, quite misleading!<br />Gave them away.<br />Would be helpful to see a photo!!!"
1.0,Terrible!<br />They were too small for my stilettos so couldn't use them<br />Ruined my boots Halloween bc I didn't have the protection
1.0,Horrible. Way too big for anyone’s face. Even tried to wash it to see it would shrink and that still didn’t work.
1.0,"The taps are fine, but the nails are NOT. Instead of the ridged nails in the photo, I was given smooth nails which wear out faster than the taps, so that the tap falls off of the shoe but the nail stays attached and protrudes, ready to skewer an unsuspecting passerby!"
1.0,I love the ring don't get me wrong but it turned my finger green which I wasn't too thrilled about.
1.0,They were GIANT...absolutley giant. Ordered red shoes for myself and my daughter so we could match...these were so big we couldn't even make them work for one evening. So tears and an emergency trip to the store for not what we wanted happened.
1.0,"The design was completely uneven (too far to the right). And the color certainly does not match the color in the picture. I ordered ""navy"" which also looks like royal blue in the seller's pic."
1.0,"Too small, ordered a 4x. Which is about a large in size. Material is thin too.  Not impressed"
1.0,"Pretty disappointed, the color is off from the photos and video, also the fit is nothing like in photos or video. It does not have the range that it shows. It's very stiff and poor visibility. For $30 i expected it to look more like the pics and video"
1.0,This is not at all what I ordered or what I recieved. Ended up giving the blouse to my niece because it was too small for me.
1.0,"I USED MUG THREE TIMES AND IT BROKE!!!! THE FLIP BUTTON IS PLASTIC,THE HINGE HOLE SNAPPED OFF.I WOULD HAVE RETURNED IT ,BUT THE SHIPPING FEES IN ALASKA ARE INCREDIBLE,.BESIDES I WOULD NOT USE ANOTHER ONE MADE BY THIS CO..ONE STAR IS ONLY RATING POSSIBLE TO WRITE COMMENTS OR I WOULD HAVE GIVEN NEGATIVE RATING.COVERED IN HOT COFFEE  DOES NOT A PLEASANT DAYS FISHING MAKE"
1.0,"My son wore it once at the beach and that was it. Once they are wet, the material will rub against your achilles' heel, and will hurt like he..."
1.0,I had to return....I am only 5'3 and the length was so short. The ruching under the bust was much lower on the actual product.
1.0,"Terrible quality, very uncomfortable. Will never buy it again. Not recommended."
1.0,Only had one earing - very disappointed
1.0,Runs too small order one size up.
1.0,Rolls down. Does not stay on
1.0,I tried one after another. Every single one ripped from neck or completely in half. Embarrassing in front of clients.
1.0,The lunch bag is big enough to fit an apple or a very small snack and nothing else. The description of &#34;lunch bag&#34; should be changed to pencil bag pr something like that. Quality seemed to be okay but the fact that the phone bag is the same size is very inconvenient.
1.0,Very heavy and chunky in appearance. I still have not figured out how to set the time and there are no instructions.
1.0,"Very disappointed, will be returning! Does not fit or  look as advertised. Look & feel like pajama pants, very thin & no shape at all."
1.0,One star only because I actually received these.<br />They only lasted one day. I wore them to the river and walked around on the sand for 1/2 day and the soles were falling apart.  Do not buy !!
1.0,"Buyer Beware! This coat is nothing like the picture! It is cheaply made and runs too small or too large! I am so disappointed in both of my 2 purchases because yes I ordered 2 of these coats! On one coat, the zipper broke within 2 hours of wearing it! And the other coat showed up in the worst color! But that is the color I ordered! It was awful. Cheap! Cheap! Cheap!"
1.0,This is absolute garbage. It doesn't stay on my head at all. What a complete and total waste!
1.0,Way toooo small more like 5.00
1.0,"Actual length is 7-7/8&#34;, not the 8.38&#34; listed. It seems even smaller than that. It should be labelled as &#34;Child's&#34; rather than &#34;Men's&#34;. Not even close."
1.0,"This wasn’t right for my body type... would look best on a tiny petite girl. I’m average build, long torso, 5’7 155 pounds and looked awful on me."
1.0,I was so excited about this boots and they arrived defective!!! They are so cute and It would it be perfect if they were not broken.<br />It is So disappointed one of them is unglued so I need to take it to the shoe hospital.<br />Why the packers don’t check they are go to go?
1.0,This runs way too small! I ordered an XL to be a little baggy and it looked like a small.
1.0,Horrible fabric that feels stiff and starched even after washes and fabric softener. I missed the window to return so I just donated the shirt. I don't recommend this product at all.
1.0,"The worst part is that lens are very thin and such poor quality that I could feel the eyestrain immediately. That's why they are so lightweight. The wood seems like a good idea, but it has no flex. These would be easy to break. Folded they are 3.5cm thick and don't fit the pocket very well. On the positive side, the look is kick-ass. And they tested out as polarized.  I might have kept if they were $9.99, but not for $49.99."
1.0,"145 lbs 34dd bra size and a medium fit well in the chest size but very baggy in the stomach/waist area. Also, the material is strangely thin...for a brand name product at this price, I expected more."
1.0,You can barely see the initials and the chain is so short a complete waste of money
1.0,"Nice fabric, weird shape. I donate it without wearing. But it is my taste."
1.0,"I have nothing good to say good. Cheaply made, ugly, the top is just stupid, even having it altered didn't help. Very unflattering. I threw it in the trash."
1.0,"Scratchy and don't get any softer in the wash. First pair I put on ripped at waist. Roll up thigh, roll down at waist."
1.0,Seems were ripped upon arrival. Returned to sender.
1.0,Runs small and really short
1.0,Nice looking watch. I purchased this as a gift. It broke in less than a week. Very disappointed
1.0,I’m kinda upset I wanted this dress for Christmas and ended up with leggings which ruined my whole outfit. Merry Christmas to me 🤬🥺
1.0,Steel toe was too tight on left shoe created a cut in my toe. The first two days I should have returned them so I gave them to a homeless kid.
1.0,"Nice print but it too tight on the chest. I'm 5'4"" tall 168 lbs and ordered Large. Order a size bigger."
1.0,Wasn't anything I expected it to be. It's not cotton it's synthetic and the slip that was sewn only kind of underneath the top layer is just as flimsy and terrible stitching all over
1.0,Measurements are in centimeters. Bags are very small. Sending back.
1.0,"Very very cheap. Very narrow, gives me a headache in 10 minutes. Spend a little more for<br />Something better...."
1.0,Dress is very cheaply made.
1.0,The one pair that fit I really like- the problem is all 3 pairs are different sizes.<br />They are very soft.
1.0,They jacket was a silk material wich I was NOT expecting it to be! The pants were red when I’m sure we ordered BLACK!  We didn’t care for the fit either.
1.0,Got this and immediately knew I could not give it as a gift. The stitching was all doubled over and the material was paper thin. The stitching was in black so it stood out even more. Gave it to Goodwill.
1.0,You get what you pay for. Would not buy again.
1.0,It is so ugly but idk if it’s was because of the pants or if it was because of me. But the size is good
1.0,Looks like fake plastic. Waste of money
1.0,The zipper does not work properly and sticks and runs very small. Very disappointed as this was a gift.
1.0,The packaging was not good and my item was broken. This is the only way I could upload the pics to show proof. I wanted this and now I have to go longer without one.
1.0,Definitely not a small all my swimsuits are small and fit great. This one is big I wouldn't buy from here again.
1.0,Arrived broke but there is was are necklaces in the packaging that was also damaged and broken
1.0,The quality and print of this outfit was very cheaply made. The print is actually very different than it appears to be and the fabric is not the most charming on your skin
1.0,I bought this jacket to have a lightweight jacket that is waterproof for travel. Less than in hour in LIGHT rain and I was soaked through. I ended up having to buy a jacket on my trip and because there are almost no plus size brands in Italy it took a lot of time and ultimately a lot of money. I would return it if I hadn’t already worn it. I would like a refund because they lied about it being waterproof!
1.0,"Really nice, good material, just too small, n to return u have to pay shipping. Im usually an xl. Simetime even large. But because it has sizing they dont pay for returns."
1.0,Utter junk.  They either wouldn't open correctly or they wouldn't stay closed.  Several were badly bent and one of them had RUST on the supposed &#34;stainless steel'.  My ears became inflamed and irritated from them.  Not worth returning.  Threw them in the garbage.
1.0,"This item is way way too smal.would like larger item, short will pay for them, I really like the material and would like a way bigger item."
1.0,The cut/fit was really wonky if you have boobs. No boobs? Should fit great!
1.0,turn my fingers green
1.0,"I used this bag for the first time and the shoulder strap fell off…five minutes later I went to zip my bag and the zipper pull-tab fell off! I couldn't believe it! The pictures are right in that the bag is just perfectly apportioned and did fit perfectly under the seat in front of me. The quality, however, is not reliable. Unfortunately I purchased it two months in advance of my trip, and the return window has elapsed. I'll invest in a sturdier bag at Macys now."
1.0,Broke after about 2 minutes
1.0,"Fit good everywhere except Except across the shoulders, too narrow & Odd shaping made it uncomfortable"
1.0,Too small and cheaply made. Amazon prime so I want to return for a full refund
1.0,Nice and detailed. Unfortunately the weight of it is a bit much does not stay on.
1.0,"I had to return, because it only came in one size... 😩"
1.0,"Buyer beware!  We ordered this sweater, but it did not work out.  On the order page, it states free returns.  When you process the info for return they have you print a return form. We called Amazon and the rep said to pay the freight and they would reimburse us for the amount….. okay, sounds fair….. shipping is $250….. going back to China!!!  I guess we are stuck with a sweater that doesn’t work for us and I do not trust that we will get reimbursed ……  first time feeling ripped off on an Amazon order 🙁"
1.0,"This hat does not fit my infant. It is five sizes too big, I feel it would fit my baby when they are one or two years old."
1.0,Thought this was super cute. Normally wear a large. Ordered a XL to have it extra baggy. It fit like a shirt NOT how it's pictured. The neck hole was normal sized. Kinda short as well! Go two sizes up! I returned this shirt today!
1.0,I used this glasses carefully after the replacement but it didn’t help. The quality is awful. Want my money back.
1.0,Don’t waste your money. They are awful. They feel like a baking apron. Shorty and way small.
1.0,"the picture shows an extra long sweatshirt but it is NOT long at all it is only to the waist, and it is small and I bought a large.. I am very disappointed.. I would return it but it took weeks to get to me. I will not be buying from them again!"
1.0,I had got a few of these with different colors and when I washed it The button broke off before i even got to use it
1.0,It is not S/M! I have a 6&1/2 in. wrist and it is huge. I will have to shorten the Velcro portion by an inch to make it fit. Very disappointing!
1.0,"Cheaply made, material was thin and fit was not right. Wouldn't put these on my dog"
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:ff0bb3653e1b479aff02647d1cb77b5e]] NOTHING like what is promoted. It is not like the resin masks, please spend the extra money and order from the higher priced masks because they are the correct ones similar to the game. This one is made of rubber, oversized, missing details, smells like a Ballon in a party with a nasty clown dancing on it and doesn't even fit a smaller head. It was not worth my time."
1.0,I usually wear a small but ordered a medium and it was still way too small
1.0,Super cheap looking would never wear
1.0,The 1st pic is what I ordered. The 2nd pic is what I just received. Return! And a stop at the post office.<br />Not real happy!
1.0,"I've had this watch for approx. 5-months and have recently been swimming in a pool, not an ocean or a lake,<br />and the watch has water in it.  What a piece of garbage! For any you future buyers, definitely stick with the Casio dive watches.  Approx. the same price, but a 100 times better quality!"
1.0,IT DOES NOR HAVE ANY GLITTER TO MAKE IT SHINE
1.0,"NOT RED, like I wanted, it's more of an orange. I wanted red."
1.0,"I usually wear a 2xl, bought a 3xl because I wanted to layer. 3xl fit like a large and this 4xl fits like an xl, oh well."
1.0,My first thought when I opened the box was this must be a joke! The necklace string is about 6 in long and is not a slip knot and cannot be adjusted. I can't begin to pull this over my head to make it any kind of a necklace! This is unbelievable! I'm not sure if this is defective or someone doesn't know how to make a slip knot as the description says. Needless to say it will be going back.
1.0,They arrived broken. I was not happy considering it took over a month to get them.
1.0,"The material is super thin and cheap feeling. No tags on the top or skirt so it’s unclear what is the front or back. Overall the fit and print were fine, but returning because the material feels so gross."
1.0,Looks cheap like kids jewelry
1.0,The lights do not work! Will be sending back.
1.0,"Too big  doesn't look like on the website, in my opinion."
1.0,This is the weirdest apron I've ever seen. It's like a trap you can't figure out and if try to try it on you get trapped in this thing. Plus the sizing is wrong & is too small
1.0,"The pin is beautiful.  However, the eyeglass holder loop is not big enough to hold glasses."
1.0,I ordered a 3X the xox and items say 3X but the look like an XS
1.0,"I got this watch - the first time I used it outside (not in the water) and the light showing the time is too weak and I couldn't see the time. Next day, I took for a beach and it stopped working. It's a cute design but completely waste of money."
1.0,Hole in the toe trying to get them on. They are to small for my size 10 feet.
1.0,I bought this romper thinking it was going to be awesome on me. When I got it the material does not look like the model! Very cheap looking! Don’t waist your money!
1.0,I wear a 2X // Ordered a 3X // Flimsy poorly made // Not even CLOSE to being the size I ordered // This would fit a 5th grader not a full grown adult.
1.0,Cheaply made. I took it apart for the beads
1.0,Liked the product. Sizing is misleading. Run very small
1.0,Stitched unevenly to cause a strange fit. Lace edging it itchy and pieced together in sections. It’s too wide and too short with belt loops that are too low. Luckily I know how to sew and will be making major alterations.
1.0,Cheaply made. Won’t last long. Nice tool with it though.
1.0,"I ordered this t-shirt 2 sizes larger, because it states it runs small.  It was still to small. And had a bad odor. I tried to return it and said it would cost too much. They can refund me $2.00.  Totally unacceptable. They have not answered by dispute."
1.0,I ordered a large but it was way to small. Gave the dress to my mom
1.0,I wore mine probably 10 times and then it just broke. The string under the beads can’t seem to hold up the oils.
1.0,The fit was very unflattering with thin material
1.0,Its realllllly cute but WILL NOT stay on my watch it slides out without pressing the release button I thought it’d be okay bc I’ve had pretty decent luck with amazon but this is just asking for a broken watch all for $12. No thanks I threw it in the trash!!
1.0,A large was not very large!
1.0,"I bought these but after about a week the stone fell out and I'm on my 3rd one waiting for the better quality nose ring to come in. In addition, the ""ball"" at the bottom is so small that when I brush it wiggle my nose, it starts coming out. I do not recommend, not worth the money, no matter how cheap it is bc you're just going to have to replace it anyway with better quality"
1.0,"Disappointing, very small demut color. Return for credit. A 82 year old will not be able to read the print"
1.0,Not impressed - whatever the price.  Threw it away.
1.0,"I got these and they are blurry. After I'd gotten my eyes checked, I had the Dr. for a copy of my prescription and ordered my prescription for these reading glasses and they are blurry and I can not see with these."
1.0,The zipper was broken. Needed a purse so just using it like that
1.0,"The fabric feels so tableclothy! I expected something more delicate. That, combined with it just being a horrible length for me at 5'2&#34;, made it a hideous disaster. Too long for a midi, too short for a maxi. Very unflattering. Maybe cute on taller women? Sad :("
1.0,i bought this boot because my husband bought a pair of shoes and they were comfortable these boots are hard and not very comfortable the lining isn't very warm and so wearing these boots are very hard on my feet had to wear two pairs of socks in order to feel a little comfort
1.0,"Cheap not as described, damaged and excessive clumps of visible glue. Won't refund."
1.0,It looks nothing like the picture.&it did not come with the bracelet like they said on the add.it did not come with the bracelet as they show in the picture.I was looking forward to getting the bracelet. No more ording for a while for me.I would like to have the bracelet that they Said comes with it.
1.0,Was like a men's large not true to the dimensions.
1.0,Was way too small .. Runs small
1.0,"This was a gift. She said it didn't fit right. The seller questioned, instead of just ok for return, time delay. Pd for shipping to receive, (not prime), have to pay for shipping to return! Too much invested for unsatisfactory item! Will just keep and donate!"
1.0,"Do NOT buy them! They do NOT massage the soles of the feet. They are rock hard and just plain HURT. Also not eligible for return. Very, very disappointed."
1.0,The color rose gold did not match my shoes that are rose gold very disappointed.
1.0,"1st of all it is a false advertisement! I thought two wallet will arrive because it said twin and has two has pictures in it, but I got one. It is really small and too tight to put cards in it. I wouldn't have bought that if I knew I will just get one, because other sellers are selling the exact same wallets for cheaper price. I'm very disappointed..."
1.0,My daughter has worn the item 5xs since being gifted with them for Christmas and the buttons on the right shoe have come off. We have owned several pairs of the Bearpaw product but never with buttons and I dont recommend them as they are not tightly secured.
1.0,completely see through and terrible fabric.
1.0,"It's a shame, I really love of the look and feel of these glasses, but the frame was bent out of shape when it arrived. It is unwearable as it always goes crooked on my face. Very poor quality control. I will be returning these immediately."
1.0,Buckle broke after a few uses
1.0,"The unit did function at all, I attempted to test it out in different outlets and over a 24 hr period. It never started!"
1.0,Poor Quality. One of the arms was not attached when the product arrived. I reattached it but it came off again and one lens fell out after the 5th time I wore them.  NOT recommended.
1.0,Material made my ears irritated.
1.0,Very cute. But too small to wear as a dress! Super disappointing.
1.0,These boots were very narrow  I wear 9 but ordered a 10 so I could wear heavy socks. The boots were still too small. Paid 5.99 to have them shipped. Paid 10$ to ship them back I will watch for free returns next time. Lesson learned.
1.0,This item arrived on time and the second I removed it from the tiny bag it was sent in I had sequins all over my floor. These sequins are barely glued on. If you shake the shirt they fall off. The material for the shirt is so fragile - cheese cloth is stronger. I will return this product. Very disappointed.
1.0,Loved these shoes for about a week. Strap tore off and unable to repair.
1.0,"These earrings were pretty, but sadly the quality sucks and the store was fell out only 4 weeks after I got them! Now I’m wearing earrings without stones. Unacceptable product!"
1.0,These are not Women’s-they are huge men’s socks. Returned.
1.0,Worthless returned it same day⚠️
1.0,Too bulky:(
1.0,"Really cheap looking, basically looks like big round plastic on your ears. Don't recommend."
1.0,"I wear a 38D and there's no way this could provide the type of support I need. Yes, it does pull the breasts together and create cleavage but with no support from under the breasts it looked odd. I wore it around the house for less than 20 minutes and the sides were already staring to lift."
1.0,"Top way to big and boxy. Bottoms are snug. Color stained packaging, can’t imagine the dye it would leave on my body."
1.0,"Horrible quality. Graphics are dull, and don't live up with the hat as picture shows."
1.0,This layered necklace does not meet my expectations based on the illustration. When it arrived I didn't even have to open the package to see the chain looks very cheap. It would have looked very nice if the chain was a better quality and not so generic. Childlike toy chain. I am returning it. Its a shame because I do like the charms.
1.0,"This seller is charging me for shipping to return these shoes. They may be standard size 5, but they did not fit my child's size 5 foot. They were way too big. Even though she wears size 5 in other brands. I was not told that I would be charged shipping to return. I love Keens and would not purchase from this seller again!"
1.0,This dress is not good for women plus size
1.0,Discolored print
1.0,Wasn't like picture looked and wasn't a good fit.
1.0,i got this watch with broken pin
1.0,6weeks broken already junk Amazon should stop selling them
1.0,ordered extraarge and received small;
1.0,"I have about 5 or 6 of these watch bracelets that I purchased from 2-3 different vendors over the years.  Sizes are 22mm, 23mm, and 24mm (and mine all have the screw pins, not the rivet pins found on the narrower bracelets).  It seems like they're all about the same quality no matter which vendor you get them from - my guess is they are all made from the same one or two non-US factories.<br /><br />I primarily have them on Casios (prw2000, prw3000, prw6000, prw6600, stw1000, and I think one non-Casio that I can't remember at the moment) - (really) poor man's alternative to the Casio combi or composite bracelets (and yes, I had to mod most of them in one way or another to fit).<br /><br />For the most part, they're semi-OK but definitely not sturdy or hard use!!!  The main problem is that the screw pins (male side and female side screwing together inside the links) are Very weak/flimsy.  I've had two watches come apart for no apparent reason (and this is even after I tightened every single link upon initial installation and sizing).  In addition, it is Very easy to strip the screw pins (i.e. they just keep turning and never get any tighter) - even with a light touch using jewelers screwdrivers.  I think it's a combination of poor quality control and machining of the threads on one or both sides of the screw pin and soft metal (deforms and/or wears easily).<br /><br />For the one I just recently purchased through Amazon and received today, Every screw pin needed tightening - and when I did, 4 pins stripped out (and that was just keeping one side in place and turning the other side with just my thumb and index finger on the jewelers screwdriver).  I was only able to finally make it fit by reusing the pins from the links I removed during resizing (and btw, the pins are different lengths because the bracelet tapers).  I think that was the worst one so far.  I have considered going back and adding thread locker to each pin but it would be very time consuming, probably messy, and I have a feeling that I would lose quite a few of the pins just from the wear/tear of loosening and retightening.<br /><br />IMO, these are maybe worth $10 and the more I think about it, the more I'm probably going to replace them all with the $80-90 Luminox carbon replacement bracelets.  I shoulda stopped buying these long ago and gone with those Luminox or other alternative bracelets.  It's too bad the wider bracelets don't come with the rivet/push pins, I would be willing to give those a try..."
1.0,"The art work is very low resolution and blurry so much so you can barely tell that it's a phoenix. Not to mention the image is incredibly small, I'm actually going to return this necklace. For 7 or 8 dollars sure maybe it'd be worth it, but not for the price it's listed.<br /><br />There's better necklaces with phoenix imagery available."
1.0,It fell apart after 2 days of wearing
1.0,"Awful material, like sand paper.  Returned."
1.0,No de buena calidad no lo recomiendo
1.0,NOPE! I actually loved them than the frame broke.
1.0,The bracelet was gaudy and the charms too small.
1.0,Makes you look odd.
1.0,Where do I begin. It's neon yellow. Its too short and wide. Not even a little cute.
1.0,"It looks like the picture. It is not well made. It's color is<br /> perfect for my dress, but I don't think it will last."
1.0,Every single band has broken at the seams where the band sticks into the watch. Very dangerous if you are doing aerobics and the band snaps off. I am unsure what to do with all the accumulated plastic.
1.0,Bad purchase because it was cheaply made.<br />Would not recommend this purchase.
1.0,Did not like that it didn’t have belt hoops and it runs very small I am sending it back
1.0,My feet feels like it’s burning.
1.0,Horrible bra and super small. I ordered a D cup and ended up giving to my 9 year old niece who is in training bras and it fit her perfect. Will NOT be reordering!
1.0,"Sent me wrong size, but they looked cute and sturdy"
1.0,It’s was to small
1.0,Horrible... gave as a gift did not come with the smaller pieces to make it work
1.0,I wouldn't buy these.  I had bought 2 packages of these and I received one set of earrings out of the package and totally smashed all to hell.  Not to mention that they are made out of cheap plastic crap.
1.0,Better off dead.
1.0,"I really disliked the fit of this shirt, it was way too big and just baggy in all the wrong places. Will not be buying this brands clothing anymore."
1.0,I ordered XL and it actually fit my mother who wears a Med.
1.0,Frame broke in half at nose bridge within one day after putting on only 3 times.
1.0,One EarrOne came without a diamond requested a replacement no one has gotten back to me
1.0,Loved them until sunscreen took finish off lenses.  Waste of money
1.0,Too big missed return window so im stuck with it
1.0,I did not get enough arch support and would like to return them and I can’t find how and where to return them
1.0,"The picture is deceiving.  I was surprised that something that looked so nice could be so affordable so I ordered it.  When it arrived I was so disappointed.  It looks so cheap, the color is weird, it's really bulky and not thin or dainty like the picture.  Lesson learned. If you want something to look nice, spend more money."
1.0,It was way too small and it was thin fabric that was extremely slick. Yuck
1.0,I bought this for my husband and it broke in 2 months time.  Very disappointed!!
1.0,Much smaller than expected!
1.0,"Color was off and so was the paint in the packaging. These looked cheap and I would have returned them, but I missed the window. Do yourself a favor and save your money!"
1.0,"Bought this for my husband, he wears size  13 shoe and has muscular calves. This is made VERY small. I’m an a average size woman and they are even snug on me. Would only fit really thin guy with small feet"
1.0,Pants did not have stretch and were not even close to the size I ordered.
1.0,"The metal plates in the clasps of the bands do not fit the watch. You can try replacing them with the original bands' clasps, but they won't stay on. Very disappointing."
1.0,"I ordered this sweatshirt and loved it! So I ordered another one as a gift for someone else. However, the second one that came looked completely different. It was a darker blue and was almost t-shirt thin. I will be asking for a refund."
1.0,"While this thick, heavy vest is warm, it's not a practical coat as implied by the &#34;winter warm&#34; in the title. The outside is a fake fur that sheds easily and is itchy against the skin. The inside is a slick, satiny lining (100% polyester). The vest has two, large, plastic hook closures at the chest and torso (hooks are 5.25&#34; apart), and that's it. Worse, the hooks keep unhooking with normal movement. Cold air can enter all along your front, and your upper chest and arms are exposed to the air. The large hood has nothing to hold it in place, so it's just for show. And, in my opinion, the model makes the vest look much nicer than it is in person. It might impress kids playing dress up or maybe teenagers, but it didn't strike me as something that genuinely looks nice. (And a friend saw the vest in a pile and said it looked like road kill, so it's not just me.) There are two front pockets for your hands. The Large size did fit me as expected. But the fake fur rubbed against my neck when I tried it on, and I was itchy there for days. This isn't something I can actually wear.<br /><br />Care instructions were in code, but they apparently say, &#34;Do not machine wash. Do not bleach. Dry flat. Iron medium heat. Dry clean only.&#34;"
1.0,The back elastic already had threads coming out. It makes your hips look much larger and the fabric is uncomfortable.
1.0,Order up and it's big disappointment for sure
1.0,Way too big nicest snapback I have ever seen
1.0,One of the nose pieces fell off a week after I got them
1.0,[[VIDEOID:11b42432461cb1d41915e2c9538ad4c7]] It looks nice but it already broke and I hardly even wore it.  Don’t buy this watch. The hand won’t move at all looks like I’m out of time to return it.  If you want this brand watch get it from the dealer not Amazon
1.0,"They did look cool and worked relatively well for the first week, but shortly after they broke in my backpack(while all my other sunglasses were fine) You get what you pay for"
1.0,"Wore it one day and the thing quite, fogged up and is now DEAD!!!!"
1.0,It didn’t cover
1.0,"Please - if you order this dress, do not order in your regular size. I am a size 12 and the XL I ordered fit a friend of mine that is a size 4. Also the material is like parachute material very see through."
1.0,Broke first day my husband used it
1.0,Bought it last minute for vacation 32C and the small fit no issue there. I gave it one star and would have returned it if i didnt need this style of bra because right over the breast area the seams come together and form a point. Its awkward and thankfully the shirt i wore was loose.
1.0,The actual width of the band is wider than what the description says. The green one is what I ordered and should be the same size as the red one but it's bigger. Such a disappointment
1.0,The waist band has frayed on almost every pair and the printed tag is an iron on that peels off after 1st washing
1.0,The quality of upper area and form were lacking tremendously. The shape was not even so much so that it would not be worn.
1.0,The earring made my nieces' ear red - she must have an allergic reaction to the metal.  Is it really Sterling Silver?
1.0,I got a shirt rather than a dress. Not even the same brand as the one I purchased. I got some brand called Rae Mode. Very disappointed!!
1.0,"Not truly custom! don't fit, n fall out don't do it.<br />if u love vampires and want custom REAL fangs check out Horror Show Jacks fangsmith !!!!  his basic k9 fang that looks like this is 60$ but movie quality ...I'll post a pick of my hsj fangs"
1.0,Cute necklace. 2.5 months later.
1.0,Used for 6 weeks and the black coating is peeling off from around the hole. Lasts maybe 1 month then needs replaced with better quality belt!
1.0,"MASSIVE SHRINKAGE. The top is really cute and the colors are great.  First washing on delicate, cold water cycle and hang dry and it shrunk to the size of an 11 year old.  If you are ordering this, order it several sizes too big."
1.0,These shoes completely fall off my feet. I wear 8-8.5 and got these in an 8. Return immediately.
1.0,Run short and shrink. Not comfortable
1.0,"I ordered the Large gloves, but they didn't fit at all (my wife wears a small and she couldn't fit these gloves).<br />The box states that it's made in Malaysia, the barcode sticker states that it's made in China... so where were they made??  The sizing on the box has permanent marker on the Large size, but there wasn't any marks on the color section.  The sizing is clearly off; according to the diagram on the box, the gloves I received are XS but should have been large.  They feel and look a lot thinner than 4mil and there's nothing on the box that states the thickness.<br />I can't recommend these gloves at all.  Hopefully the manufacturer gets better quality control."
1.0,"I liked the design and the size.  The, the band felt good after 3 links were removed, but the display is so dark that it is useless as a time piece.  If it hadn't been so cheap it would have been returned immediately.  It was a waste of money.<br />keith"
1.0,NOT what I ordered.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- looks nothing like the picture<br />- has a strip of brown fabric running down each side with snap buttons<br /><br />Pros:<br />- lightweight<br />- soft fabric
1.0,How do I get this thing off!!!!!!
1.0,Cheap the silver is all rubbed off it would not recommend
1.0,"LOVED the face on it.  Hated the sizing.  I think I ordered the largest one, and it wasnt even close to fitting."
1.0,"Very disappointed in this sweater.  Sizes not accurately described and very cheaply made.  When I communicated this to seller, was told I would have to pay to return it (internationally)! I hope Amazon becomes wise to these cheap, coniving retailers and does not further support their business."
1.0,It was rough like sandpaper and the glitter fell off everywhere. I returned it.
1.0,"How I wanted to like this skirt. Alas. Not a match made in heaven. The material and construction don't feel well made and the material is thin - not in a good way, in a cheap way. I also was expecting a skirt that was knee length. This is definitely longer. I'm 5 6"". This reached mid-calf. Sayonara! Keep looking, ladies!"
1.0,"Love the necklace, but it broke within 45 minutes of first wearing"
1.0,Not worth the money. Unless u r a stick with an a cup.
1.0,The length on the dress was the only thing that was fitting about this dress for me. It was a super cute design and I was sad that I had to send it back just as soon as I got it.
1.0,The inside padding moves around and after the first wash will not flatten back out.
1.0,"So I guess I accidentally ordered a regular sized shirt instead of an oversized shirt, but I literally got a crop top. Who is this suppose to fit? I wouldn't buy again. Super misleading."
1.0,"These earrings are very pretty...but that's all they have going for them. Beside being extremely difficult to fasten, these earrings made my ears infected after only a few hours of wearing them! My ears are now red and sore and I have a horrible headache. Please, save your money and DONT BUY THESE!!!"
1.0,this seller keeps trying to block my review but there are many ways to stop unscrupulous sellers on amazon. my review was within guidelines but they want to block it. these are overpriced for poorly made flimsy cheap plastic sunglasses. period. i will be complaining about thids and post this review and their attempt to hide it online if you want to play that game!
1.0,This is no way should be classified as tactical pants.
1.0,What a joke.. Two nothing special rocks with one side sanded flat and polished. About 1-inch by 1/2 inch..For the money it was a total waste..
1.0,Broke within two weeks
1.0,Poco practico
1.0,If you’re a bigger girl this probably isn’t a great option. I’m 5’4 180 and got it on but the arms chest and stomach area were very very tight. The zipper was poor quality as well. If you’re smaller I would go up at least one size for it to fit comfortably unless you are petite.
1.0,they were to small did not fix they are not true to size
1.0,"Cheap and unflattering. The top half has a faux leather element in the &#34;lace&#34; part that is basically plastic and feels and looks like it. The high (front) part of the hi-lo cut hits me in an awkward place (I'm 5'6&#34;). This really only looks good on the model and in those flowy poses that emphasize the chiffon, but it's not a dress to wear unless you are very thin, tall, and are just wearing it to take photos in."
1.0,tried 2 neither one worked a piece of Junk!!!!
1.0,this looks like a stocking cap/beanie in the picture complete with knitted texture and embroidered symbol then you get it and its thin as hell Lycra with a screen printed symbol...cant even look good worn because the double layer of lycra flairs out on the top of the head and the symbol starts peeling off as soo as you try....
1.0,"Runs very small, I ordered an XL and couldn't get them up my hips . 5'5 190lbs"
1.0,why complain if your buying a cheap neck less online and your complying about it ? 😑✋you get what you paid for .
1.0,Arrived without the damm belt.  How does this happen?
1.0,I like the band however it is not secure and continues to pop off
1.0,I did not like the product it broke in 2 days and came with a small knot in it
1.0,The front clip to this bra came broken. It was snapped.
1.0,No limpia nada
1.0,I didn't care for the fabric and the buttons from top to bottom of the dress.
1.0,"Do not buy dress, it's super thin and is not worth it. Will return."
1.0,Was too small need better size chart
1.0,"I had eight of these in my cart with some other things.  My jaw dropped when I saw my total for shipping.  Deleted ONE of these and shipping went down by over $7.  Deleted another one, it dropped another $7.  So, for eight of these, all weighing next to nothing, and all shipping from the same company, they charged over $50 for shipping!  Kinda makes that whole one cent thing a bucket full of baloney!"
1.0,the fabric wasn't well made
1.0,The color was exactly what I want it but the material that it’s made out of isn’t very durable I was washing my hands got a little wet and found out that it is a sticker on the band that started lifting very disappointing
1.0,"Quality is not great. The stitching is off. Not very flattering,  and looks nothing like the pictures. I will be returning it."
1.0,the fit was horrible. the arm area up by my shoulders were restricting and i got bigger than i usually wear.i wouldnt buy this at all. i plan on returning
1.0,I'm not sure the material of the shirt. It says cotton but it feels like burlap. The stitching was made by a one arm drunk guy. Overall 1-star. Good for scrubbing hard surfaces but not safe for skin.
1.0,"Material is not knit, but a cotton-linen type fabric that wrinkles extremely easy. The fit is not comfortable nor does it allow for good movement in shoulder and arm area. I wanted to love this dress, as the pattern is really cute, but unfortunately I was very dissapointed in fit, fabric and comfort of this dress. I will be returning it."
1.0,Don't luck like the picture
1.0,"Item description fur lining received without. Also says leather ,but mine were suede or more like a cheap plastic . Returning!"
1.0,Cheap material! Look like someone just sewed two pieces of cloth together to make a sack cloth! I ordered xxl and the size look like  a small. Very cheaply made!
1.0,Cardboard shirt form was folded Three times for shipping. I would prefer the form not to have been folded. I will be creating a new form with foam poster board and used this as the template. Disappointed.
1.0,It already broke. Its cheaply made. I will not recommend this to anyone
1.0,I didn’t even use it … it’s completely unopened and I’m unable to return it. Bad description of the product. It is missing parks and the mask smells like bad chemicals. And I didn’t even try it on and I can’t return it. Practically new! First product ever I cannot return and it smells bad.
1.0,My son's shoes fell apart.  The bottom came unglued
1.0,Did not like this shirt at all. I expected the American flag detail to be an actual pocket and it was not. Very cheap looking shirt
1.0,It is ugliest cloth I ever seen.
1.0,The Dress Was Sprayed with ALOT Of Cheap Perfume..I Thought This Was ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE..WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS STORE AGAIN..
1.0,Too small did not fit
1.0,"This dress is poorly made. I don't even know where to begin. First the pattern is all stars.  There is a bit of a sun by the bottom side where the seem is. Everything else is just blue and white stars. I ordered a size 5 to just to make sure it wasn't snug and by looking at thes size chart. The top is ok in size a bit lose. The problem is the bottom skirt. The bottom skirt is very wide, with no shape and it reaches down to my ankles. There is a small 5 inch zipper on the side which I don't know what the purpose of that is and it is poorly sewed in that you it doesn't even zip up correctly. The material is very thin and stretchy, and over all the dress is poorly sewn. It was also shipped from china with a new york label which was very strange."
1.0,lacks quality
1.0,Maternity like
1.0,I thought this bracelet was beautiful and bought it to wear to church. Unfortunately it turned three days after receiving it. I didn't even get to wear and enjoy it. I would've been more happier if it turned after I wore it.
1.0,Hardly any color to these cabochons. Definitely nothing usable for wire wrapping.
1.0,Don't buy unless it's prime. I ordered an XXL and got a small. Very cheap material. Just don't order.
1.0,Got this watch about a month and half ago. Worked good until now. It is very hit or miss if it will even shock. This morning I woke up to it burning my skin while shocking it. Now I have multiple burn marks on my wrist.
1.0,"ZERO STARS! I should have read the comments, and the reviews. I was looking forward to a nice fabric tobogan for my 7 yr old who is a huge it's funneh fan. Was totally shocked to receive this in a greeting card sized envelope, looks like a sock beanie for an infant. Way too small, and the iron on print is cheap and will not last long! Will definitely return or replace. This item should be at the Dollar Tree! Took 21 days (3 full business weeks) to ship."
1.0,Perfect for a 9 year old girl. Our 14 year old with a 28 inch waste it did not fit. You can not have any boobs for this one.
1.0,Not women size.  Girl size.  Short. Barely hits the top of my jeans yet in photo covers her bottom...
1.0,Doesnt look like picture bad quality falls apart you can still see the glue looks like worse then something dollar tree would sell
1.0,"The material is thin. You would need to wear something underneath. Unfortunately, the dress was ill fitting and fit was too big."
1.0,Very see through! I purchased white and never wore it due to how sheer it is
1.0,Selling a child size shirt? Do not show an adult model. This was silly and a waste of my money.
1.0,Goggles we’re for a Halloween costume
1.0,To big and wgen i got them there was hair in my package.  I understand s*** happens bit it grossed me out.
1.0,ThiS is not a sweatshirt hoodie!! It's simply polyester!! There's no fuzzy warmth inside nothing like it at all!! Once again do not wish your money just cuz it's cute!!!
1.0,I don't know if I want to say it's not a flattering dress but it's definitely not for me. It just fits too loose and the bottom kind of flares out it doesn't go in like in the picture beautiful design ugly fit.
1.0,You get what you pay for ugh
1.0,"The jacket was not as pictured. The quality was much less than expected. The fur was very thin and flimsy. The coat itself was thin too. Overall,  it was not the quality was poor. This was a gift for my grandson, but I had to return it because of the poor quality."
1.0,"These gloves are so small my 3-year old couldn't get them on, no wonder everyone complains about seams splitting. It is obvious that the positive comments are fakes. They are not stretchy material. It is unbelievable that Amazon even sells this product, it should be removed immediately!"
1.0,"Product broke, cracked while removing it from a sunglass holder."
1.0,Just terrible
1.0,There is no way for this to stay on your ear
1.0,"Nice cardigan or light over jacket. I think the price was too high for as thin as the material is. I found a navy blue one, nearly identical at Ross for a third of the cost. Same weight fabric. Felt like I got a kick in the pants, cause this one is stylish, but isn't worth the price. Starting to notice things are cheaper at the store than on Amazon. Might be a trend we are beginning to see."
1.0,"I searched for the word ""linen"" on the page for this shirt and got 73 hits (including all the other linen shirts advertised on the page, some from the same manufacturer) but it is a conspicuous word in all the copy for this and the manufacturer's other shirts.  I searched for the word ""rayon"" and then the word ""nylon"" and got 0 hits, which is a shame since it's 80% Rayon and 20% Nylon which from my calculation, (and math isn't my best subject) means it's actually 0% linen.<br /><br />I'm disappointed as I got the shirt for an upcoming cruise and I was thinking of the light, airy feel of linen as I understand it; flax that is light, dries quickly and has an air-blown look and feel to it.<br /><br />It's not that it's an unattractive shirt, it's that it's NOT LINEN.  It's a synthesized blend of a natural and an unnatural fabric that ought to be marketed as such and was not what I expected.  My question would be as to why it is so aggressively marketed as a specific fabric that it isn't.<br /><br />It's a nicely crafted shirt, but the second I took it out of the bag it had a slightly nylon feel to it and not the cotton feel.  It was immediately apparent as a poly- or polyblend shirt.<br /><br />The inner tag tells the tale.  This is unlikely to make the cruise and I think the manufacturer ought to be obliged to say ""linen-like"" since it is disappointing to be led to expect something other than what you get,"
1.0,The sweater was very short and small. I put it in the trash.
1.0,"The Tailoring of this jumpsuit is God Awful. If you look at my pic, you can see how clumpy it is in the middle area and uneven around the neck and chest area. To add insult to injury, the color I received came in orange not yellow as pictured.<br /><br />How can they destroy a simple spandex and rayon outfit? This is my second incident like this with Amazon. I’m shocked they would sponsor a deceitful brand like this. I will be making a complaint."
1.0,"Thin material,arrived to late."
1.0,I want a refund one of the stones already fell out and I only wore it one day. Not at all what I expected even though the price was very inexpensive you get what you pay for.
1.0,I've had this purse in large for a year. I've not used it daily.  The interior of this bag has shredded. My keys and items in the bag get caught on these hair- like fibers.  It's annoying to deal with this.  This bag is not worth the over $30. I paid for it.  I wish I could issue less than one star.
1.0,"there is no problem with the fit, it fits me, the problem with the product itself , the material is that kind that makes you look weird, no i didn’t like it"
1.0,"Horrible, cheap material!"
1.0,Don’t fit right
1.0,do not order... this is a  very cheap piece of mess. Picture do not look like the finger ring at all.
1.0,This is a horrible necklace it may look absolutely amazing but just in 24 hours when I tried it on it just broke apart!!! money wasted
1.0,"I returned this item right away. It was made from cheap material and didn't look anything like the picture. Also the size chart was completely off. Buyer beware, don't waste your time!"
1.0,Waited a couple weeks for arrival finally arrived and can’t nobody put they head through this dress it has no zipper Smdh
1.0,"Very disappointed with quality. Hat is basic knit hat that can be purchased for under $5. Label on front, misprinted. Stamp is off and wording along top edge is cut off. Seller requested a written review with picture for reimbursement of funds. Not worth the money, very disappointing as this was a gift to my son."
1.0,"Looks like a space costume on me. To shiny! I ordered a large. I'm 5'4"" 150lbs. The top was tight in the arms and the pants didn't lay flat! They gathered from the waist to the ankles. It looked wrinkled!"
1.0,These had a horrible chemical smell. I had to take them outside it was so bad. Also they run really small. Didn’t fit my 6/7yos.
1.0,"Way too small, doesn't cover the sides. Very thin. There are many other brands that are better. I can't even use these. I was a refund"
1.0,"I was so excited to order this due to all the great reviews. I ordered the ""red 2"" color. What I received was bright orange and missing the top button! Strings hang off of every seem, all the button loops were different sizes causing weird gaps and it was overall poorly constructed. Pretty sure all these people claiming to love it received the item for free or were paid for their fake reviews. Either that or I just got stuck with a lemon. Anyway - it is definitely going back."
1.0,What was delivered was a completely different shape of frame from the item description. The size was also smaller than listed. I returned them.
1.0,"Nothing like pictures, bought 3pairs , trying on 2pairs they  fall apart , don’t bother to try the 3rd one just throw them in trash mad 😡"
1.0,returned it.  didn't fit right.  cheaply made.  don't advise purchasing it.
1.0,"I ordered a medium and the dress was still short and really thin, like you can see right through it."
1.0,"This product is an outright lie. The title says engraved and the picture clearly shows an engraved product, but what I received is just printed on. I have no faith that it won't be scratched off immediately. The big sis keychain also broke immediately. Not worth the money."
1.0,This review required me giving a star to submit...lol. I am an amazon prime memeber and a mother of two. So i shop online for myself quite often. This shirt is cute online but so cheaply made. I Tried to return and the seller never responded. Amazon denied my refund as well even after disputing the order. I have never had an issue before with returns..<br /><br />Cheap material and is the bottom seam is crooked.. do not buy!
1.0,"Cheep, see thru, scratchy material"
1.0,"Very bad fit. Rode up into eyes, and sometimes sliding off of nose. Too small , overall. Made overseas. Nicely made, just wrong pattern. I cut one to alter. So  cannot return them, or I would."
1.0,I don't like the material it's Chip
1.0,"Soooooo wrinkled. I tried dewrinkle spray, a light iron. Nothing works"
1.0,"major bummer... This hat clearly is described as having a snap back, in reality it does not, and it does not fit my head. Very disappointed in the inaccurate product description."
1.0,The umbrella looked great and the lights worked at first.  We always put our umbrellas down when we go in for the night.  After 6 weeks one of the arms broke while we were outside (so it wasn't bad weather or high winds). Very disappointing.  We duct taped it for now until I purchase a replacement. The wire inside was damaged when it snapped and the lights don't work now either.
1.0,I’m 5’5 And weigh 145. and I’m on the thicker side. But it shouldn’t be to the point where these jeans squeeze the hell out of my thighs but fit decently around my waste. They literally looked like skinny jeans on me and ended up ripping apart because they were so tight on my thighs. I ordered the wrong size and returned them and received an even bigger one. They still didn’t fit. It’s to the point where if I purchased the largest size that I could it wouldn’t even fit around my waste. I wore the new pair once and they completely ripped. I hate these jeans they are actually horrible
1.0,Really raggedy looking
1.0,Very disappointed. I was not aware that I had to purchase 2. Something like this should come in two automatically since most people have two feet. I take it that is why they call it the barefoot sandals and not the bare feet sandal.
1.0,Very poorly made. The charm was inside the bag broken into pieces. The sides seem to have been missing a piece of hardware preventing the bad from opening up properly. Very disappointing.
1.0,"The beads are very attractive, but there is something wrong with the blue dye. The blue dye keeps coming off and stains my fingers and my wrist. I used a damp cloth to wipe the beads off in the hopes of removing the excess dye, but it did not work. I'm returning the beads and asking for a refund - I'm really disappointed."
1.0,Way to small for even a 6 yr old
1.0,Sizing up just wasn’t enough. I wear a size 14/xl and the 2x was way too tight. Made me look like a sausage casing. Also the material was seriously cheap spandex. Nice print tho.
1.0,Did not have a lot of stretch. Pulled in awkward places when I wore them to work out. Will not buy again
1.0,Imagine strapping two bricks to your feet and walking around. Actually that might be more comfortable.
1.0,The cheap material irritated my nose and caused a rash
1.0,Awful product. I got them locking for something that would not cause an allergic reaction and after wearing them for not even a week I have a triple ear infection on each ear because there is cheap metal in the earring backs and the front section that holds the gem in. I'll be calling for a refund.
1.0,"bought these for my 15 year old son. 15-20 times he used them and they are falling apart<br />leather and plastic seam becoming quickly a gap<br />i am a TRUE adidas guy and i am teaching my son to be one, but after this i really wonder if i should"
1.0,It wasn’t fluffy at all too flat.
1.0,Too big. Flaps get in your view. Ear holders break before you get them on.
1.0,It broke right when I got it 😢😤 waste of money
1.0,Tough feeling and fuzz balls after a few washes.
1.0,Way to small. Material very thin like a slip
1.0,Turned my finger green
1.0,Loved it when I got it but only last two days and broke
1.0,I returned it. Made in China and this fact is NOT disclosed on listing.
1.0,The neck was stretched out and the fit was not good.
1.0,"It is pretty, but the core of the buckle is a cheap/flimsy spring loaded bar that broke causing the iWatch to fall and almost be lost."
1.0,FELL APART. OTHER SUMAJU ITEMS WERE NICE. THIS ONE. NO.
1.0,"I don't believe these are 18k plated, some of the gold finish was worn off on it.  Not impressed at all. Very small will only fit a child, came in a box in a cheap plastic bag."
1.0,"- The dress material is super thin/cheap and showed the outline of ALL undergarments.<br />- The top of the dress comes in too much around the shoulders. It’s almost like it’s a reverse racer back in the front.<br />- The dress made me look as big as a house. The dress doesn’t hang cutely under the empire waist like the picture, instead it poofs out so I look fat or pregnant.<br /><br />I am 4’11 and 120 and i ordered a small.<br /><br />Overall - there are much better options."
1.0,"The design is beautiful and looks even better in person, however the sizing is completely misleading. It took me about 10 agonizing minutes to get just 1 plug in, and it's almost blew out my ear. I understand that these are flares, but even the middle part is not true to size. I sadly have to return these as I am not going to damage my ears anymore even if the item itself is beautiful. Please be careful when buying!!"
1.0,"They’re ribbed and look more like long Johns. And are not true to size, nothing like the pic. I will be returning."
1.0,Waste my money look cheap and not good quality
1.0,It broke in 3 months. Expected it to hold out longer
1.0,"I ordered this in white. It’s more of a coverup than a dress. The fit was too small. The material was SO cheap, scratchy and see through! It had strings hanging off and just poor quality all around. It went right back!"
1.0,I ordered a 2X if it's like 3X. The waste comes up to Mid rib cage and legs are stopping at the ball of my foot. I'm a big girl and these pants sport a mean cameltoe. I was hoping for control top to hold me in while I exercise. These pants are on the stretchy side and it doesn't hold anything in. I will not buy again and I would not suggest to buy.
1.0,The line is not blue.  It is purple.  I won't wear a tie with a purple line.  I was planning on wearing it got the police memorial.  Disappointed
1.0,Are you joking? I wear an 8-10. I ordered a large. It absolutely would not come up high enough to cover my &#34;ladies&#34;. Total fail.
1.0,"Okay, there is like no support on the sole. If you step on a rock - you feel it. So definitely for climbing only. Seriously - unless your scaling a rock face - do not bother with these shoes. Not for hiking. Not for running. Not even for standing. But if you are scaling a rock wall - the padding around the ankles are excellent. The fit was snug. And it turns out - they were quite water proof!"
1.0,Very disappointed the frist one was small so i decided to order 2 a second one 2 size up still small its the same size as the other one. then its not jade its plastic in so upset.
1.0,Bought this for my wife. She says the watch is OK. But the catch is a little trickery. Her youngest son adjusted the length of band. It you don't have the catch just right it will fall off. The watch clamp is no good keeps falling off updated. She's afraid to where it because of the clamp.
1.0,"The right boot sags and bunches around the ankle but fits comfortably around my calf with a generous curve designed into the cut of the leather. The left boot fits nicely around my ankle but is REALLY tight around my calf and stretches the elastic and doesn't appear to have the same generosity in the cut - they look like 2 different boots. I thought it was my imagination (after checking the sizes printed in the boot - they match) but they must have terrible quality control... when I measured the shaft circumference, the left side is at least 1/2&#34; smaller than the right. I could live with the loose ankle, but not mis-matched boots."
1.0,Terrible fitting and material like sand paper
1.0,"Initially the shoe looked fabulous. It appeared to be leather but come to find out that was just a top layer coating. After my son wore them to school a week the top layer coating started to wear at the top of the toe of the shoe. This made the shoe look beat up and worn out, not something I expected after only a week. Additionally, Tye Velcro straps don't allow you to tighten the full length of the strap. Furthermore, the manufacturer only wanted to refund me $6 stating that the cost of shipping is so high. I don't care if their shipping is high I should get a full refund. After going back and forth they are now offering $10. I'm not sure how this will turn out. I'm probably at a loss."
1.0,Not as it looks like in the pictures
1.0,Fit was good but after 5 months the sticking has come loose and the material on the side has simply split! Saucy is usually better than this. Very disappointed.
1.0,This was too small and not flowy at all. I had to return it. I think you need to order 2 sizes up to have it fit like in the photo.
1.0,"Dont hold up after washing. Very light weight not good if you sweat which was the point all along,  yiur mileage may vary."
1.0,Only one of the 4 colors I selected was correct. Will be returning
1.0,"The sizing is incorrect as this is large for me, and it looks a bit different than advertised."
1.0,These suck Chinese sizes and not what they said by yoga pants or athletic pants at all you will easily rip them exposing yourself beware they smell like burnt plastic and rubber with traces of a masking agent like pinesol out of the box. Returning them for the price I can go to tj max or Walmart
1.0,"Fell off within two hours, the grass was completely dry too."
1.0,"Fabric too thin, see through!"
1.0,"THEY DESCRIBE AS &#34; Material:S925 sterling silver, white round freshwater cultured pearl. Elegant, generous, ladies essential&#34; .. INST TRUE , NO CULTURED PEARL AT ALL , JUST CHEAP PLASTIC . IM RETUNING IT , FALSE PRODUCT .. SHAME"
1.0,"The material was cheap and the dress was far too big, and I went by the size chart. Extremely long, not meant for shorter people."
1.0,It looks nothing like the pic
1.0,These panta are HORRIBLE!!!  They are completely sheer.  I expected them to a little thin but these are completely transparent.  I never tried them on.  Do not buy these pants
1.0,Very flimsy!
1.0,The quality of this product is very poor.
1.0,Disliked it
1.0,it was broke when i recieved it
1.0,"dress did not fit.  I spent $20 bucks to return on 08/12/21, and no refund .  Cheaper to donate and take the tax credit."
1.0,"I bought one of these white Nike hoodies a couple years back and loved it. After 2 years of heavy wear though, it was time to replace it with a nice, white new one. However, when this one arrived, it seemed to made of Halloween costume material, and it smelled funny too. The Nike logo was too high on the chest, which looked stupid. Additionally, the fit was different, and I did not gain any weight. It was very snug, and was clearly not made from the same under armor type material my first one was."
1.0,Omg .. the package I received was taped and poorly put back together to resale .. looked used so I returned them ..
1.0,They are pretty and great quality but don’t fit properly. They hang to lose from the earlobe<br />To appear to be ear crawlers
1.0,Don't waste your money on this shirt. It fits nothing like it is pictured.  I bought a medium size and it fits more like an extra small and very tight.  The picture makes it look like it fits loose.  I tired to send it back but was told that I would have to pay for the return shipping and only receive a $3 refund. They actually suggested that I keep it or give it to someone as a gift.  Looks like I'm stuck with a shirt that doesn't fit. If I had taken the time to read the reviews beforehand I never would have bought this shirt!
1.0,"I should have read the description and reviews more carefully. I didn't realize plastic would be weaker. It doesn't hold heavier bracelets like a full Pandora. It will hold a thinner, lighter bracelet. It does have a pretty, shiny design and I bought 1 as a gift but I'm a little embarrassed to gift it because it looks cheap."
1.0,"At the time the package was delivered I was out of country on business trip, however upon return yesterday, I did try them on and come to find out that even though the packaging indicated new item (not returned), one was about 2"" shorter than the other one! Return date has already expired and overall I'm not satisfied with the item."
1.0,Nothing. Way to short.
1.0,"No me agradaron para nada , se ponen negros desde el 1er día q se usan,  no son los mismos q he comprado siempre a pesar de verse iguales , estos no lis recomiendo,  lo q de ahora en adelante no sabré cuales son los buenos y cuales los malos,  pq son idénticos"
1.0,Its a piece that i out my drawer .u pay what y get..its not even good for a rag
1.0,"Very disappointed.  Ordered these bc description states no metal made of bio flex material, the bar is metal the balls are plastic.  Very disappointed in these."
1.0,very short.
1.0,"Completely disappointed! The pictures show a very flowy material. It felt very 70's TV show on. I'm very curvy and look almost identical to the body type of the model pictured. Poor quality so I would definitely size up one to two sizes depending on the look you're going for. The color was way off... I ordered orange and it was a high lighter neon orange not what was pictured or expected, and a crease is sewn into the pants they are not clean front."
1.0,"This bracelet is a piece of crap, i had it less than one day and the so called diamonds fell out. I checked the diamond because i did find it and it looked like a tiny piece of foil not a diamond at all. What are you people trying to sell anyway. Terrible quality!! Of course i returned it and will not buy from you again."
1.0,Cute way to large...look like pajamas.
1.0,Cheap. Dont waste your money.
1.0,"Very disappointed! Way too tight. Far too cheaply made and rolled like crazy after it went on. I did use the size chart and struck out. Be warned, the majority of competing items for this product come in different packaging but are the SAME EXACT MADE as the others.<br /><br />I do not recommend!!"
1.0,"Bought this because I'd purchased a Halloween version previously and it fit like a dream. Same company, same size supposedly, but this doesn't fit at all. Really disappointing that yet another company doesn't know how to size things consistently."
1.0,The jacket is not as nice as the picture. The color is not great and it does not fit well. It took forever to ship and recieve
1.0,The material is cheap and the jumper do not look like the picture. It look like a one's n it dont fall off the shoulder.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:ebf328b55cee5c79925c75f008af6c85]] I bought these to wear this winter. I use a wheelchair sometimes as I’m disabled. You can barely sit in them, there is ZERO range of motion so if you’re trying to walk, hike, frolic, play in the snow, work, do literally anything that one would do in outdoor gear-I suggest you go for the pants made by Gash Hao for a few more bucks they’re LEGIT. I bought a small, I have a 27” waist, 118lbs, no butt really, I guess I’m just blessed like that. I am a female but also don’t have those child bearing hips. I’m a long rectangle and these are also a not as long as I am rectangle so if you have literally any natural features for men or women such as skin, shape, curve, or if you’re taller than 5’5 with a human body, I would suggest ya don’t buy, unless you size up. And even then, if I wanted something without pockets I’d be wearing a snow dress. Or would have bought something that didn’t specifically advertise pockets. As far as how water resistant they are, never even made it that far because the zipper in the crotch split when I sat down and they’re not that tight on me just oddly made. If you want to wear a base layer definitely size up. I’m lanky, and light, and usually an extra small, but bought a small and they’re junk. I hate leaving poor reviews but wow, just wow. Maybe it was just this lot or this batch, but I ordered 11/22 and I just would avoid this product. I ordered Gash Hao brand for about $8 more and they’re fantastic though. Sorry to this company, but you need to put a legitimate product out as the economy is in the toilet and things are getting increasingly expensive and us poor folks are tired of having to have major carbon footprints because your products aren’t as advertised."
1.0,They came broken. Super cheap.
1.0,In three days finish was off. Could not be shined with a cloth. Too ugly and cheap looking to wear. I did not shower in it or wear all day. Please please don't order.
1.0,Muy mala calidad. Las piezas pierden su color rápidamente. No es una pieza de joyería confiable.
1.0,"This necklace is very poorly made and appears to have black paint on it. The description is deceiving, it is light weight and very cheap. I am trying to return it for a refund and it says it not returnable. VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
1.0,Keep it moving this my friend is not what you are looking for!<br /><br />Gone to the Thrift store and get you a real Silk or polyesterTwo-piece pajama set and Tie the top up in the front and boom there you go!<br /><br />Might only cost you $5.00 if you know you know😎
1.0,The shirt is really cute but it’s only been worn a few times and is falling apart. The rainbow is coming off and there’s a big hole. Really disappointed!
1.0,ill fitting and don’t look like picture.
1.0,Horrible. I ordered white and received khaki. It is very thin and made with a rough yarn. The knit is loose so you must wear something underneath. I was very disappointed. Definitely not worth purchasing.
1.0,I love the earrings but while wearing the dangle for the 1st time I lost the dangle. Apparently the jump ring wasn't tightened and the dangle slipped out.
1.0,"Nice design. That's way I bought it. The size I got should have fit, but it was way off."
1.0,Cheapest looking earrings ever!!  They are so heavy and weigh your ear lobes down.  You can get a better pair at the dollar store!
1.0,"These are definitely not 9/16 gauge. At best, they're a 00. Photo shows the size difference between my 9/16 plug and this plug (mine on the left, y'alls on the right). This is ridiculous and I'm very disappointed.<br />Edit: Lol. Y'all sent me ONE in the whole box that is actually my size. Not to mention the other in the pair isn't even the same size!!"

1.0,Instructions stated to irradiate the white square with a blue ray generator but it did not come with it. So how do I know the is a blue light protector eye glasses. The lens part is sharp when you to h it where it may cause skin laceration. It looks like the product was returned by another customer.
1.0,Definitely not recommend it. Horrible material. Not a warm hoodie at all.
1.0,Did not go well.on me dose not fit nothing like the photo was not happy with this dress @ all never use it

1.0,"Do NOT buy these bags! I used these bags twice and the bottoms ripped. It wasn't a small rip either, the whole bottom of the bag was gone! My groceries were all over the street. I'm just thankful there wasn't anything made of glass in any of the bags. Nothing in the bags were heavy or sharp either. There was no reason for this. They are just poorly made."
1.0,Cheaply made. Definitely not what I wanted. Should have researched this product a little more. You could more than likely get something like this at the dollar store.
1.0,dislike I ordered size9 and they were size 8-9  too small  also extremely expensive.  $10 for one  pair I thoought it was 3/$10  whew  never again
1.0,Fit tight in some areas. Sloppy in others. Not proportionate
1.0,"Shorts are not lined, so they are just shorts...a little too ""free"" to be worn at a swim suit alone.  Could be a cover up?"
1.0,"The logo is much smaller than the one in the pic. It's so tiny that it doesn't resemble the real NASCAR logo enough for people to get the joke. Don't buy, you won't be happy with it."
1.0,Broke immediately upon attempting to wear. Very thin and cheap material. Do not waste your money.
1.0,Way too small. I tried on exact one a friend had. Mine came and way small. Sizes obviously are not consistent

1.0,[[VIDEOID:46daab0bbd88707490520afb556f80af]] Me mandaron un color que no era pedi negro me enviaron rojo encima no vale la pena ese lente se ve muy de mala calidad para el precio
1.0,I wear a large in most BJJ rash gaurds. I ordered an extra large and it was still to small.
1.0,Zipper doesn't work
1.0,Just awful. Not an adult size. Just arrived and it was intended as a gift for an adult. Looks like a toddler could fit it. Terrible and falsely advertised. Soooooo disappointing
1.0,Had the boots for 2 weeks. Lightly worn but lining inside is already torn at the toe and the insoles are stiff ad a board. Not worth the money. I will be throwing these away.
1.0,There's NO WAY I will give these as Christmas gifts now that I've received them! They're AWFUL!! I'd be embarrassed to gift them! DON'T BUY THESE IF YOU APPRECIATE QUALITY ... IN ANY WAY! SO disappointed!
1.0,"I really don't even want to give it 1 star due to some issues..My review on this product is.... When I saw it, I immediately liked it, thought it was cute & I don't have to carry my phone in my hand anymore.<br />So.....<br />I placed the order & was supposed to receive it on Friday by 8 pm. That didn't happen. I ended up getting it on Saturday.<br />I'm like okay FINALLY... So I clamp the straps on, put my cell phone inside the purse and put it over my shoulder to see how it looked..... 🤔One of the straps broke before I was able to get to the mirror and see what it look like.<br />Sincerely<br />A Unhappy Customer"
1.0,The posts were bent upon arrival & completely broke off after one wear.
1.0,While we will keep this apron (too much trouble to return) and use 'as is' the edges have begun unraveling with just one washing!<br />Now the sides and bottom are 'mostly' curled up and 'fuzzy' with unraveling threads!
1.0,Too small. The color is NOT NAVY. It's more like an electric blue. The fabric is cheap and flimsy
1.0,"I used this thing once, maybe twice, and the frame on the inside split a part."
1.0,Is no the same like the picture
1.0,"Way too cheap looking, don't waste your time or money. The flowers are not cute & the stone in the middle isn't very cute."
1.0,"So this is the cutest cosplay only if youre planning on a single use item. its so flimsy its basically falling apart in the packaging. the straps are close to breaking out of the package. Shame, cuz it was comfy but it for sure wont last long."
1.0,This is a terrible buy. A scam. There is simply no compression at all. Fabric is extremely thin and stretchy . I wish it was possible to give Zero stars.
1.0,Wack. Its small and very thin. Not worth 9 or 10 bucks.
1.0,Me estafaron .. nunca llegaron los zapatos. Perdí mi dinero.
1.0,Item broke 1st week
1.0,Not well made....zipper stitching not sewn together in few places
1.0,fell apart after 1 try
1.0,I need these in black.<br />I got the four pack in black twice.<br />ordered third time and they came in color.<br /><br />I need them in black!
1.0,So ugly. The position on the bottom makes you look 40lbs heavier and prego. It also has a horrible smell.
1.0,Took the watch to numerous jewelers and watch shops and no one is able to remove the back to change the battery. Had to return :(
1.0,Bad fit on
1.0,I think the person that sow the dress need to spend a little more time to make the work neater. The threads were pulling out and the tulle under dress is not cut to fit under dress properly. Unfortunately I had to return and I'm hunting wedding dress again. 😔
1.0,There are no buttons on the cuffs as it shows buttons in the picture...wanted to return for this reason but it was past the return date.  You will have to roll the sleeves up since you can't button the cuffs.
1.0,"If I could give this zero stars I would. This is not true to size, a men's medium looks like a child's medium.  If you order this and try to return it, the company will tell you the return shipping is too high and let you buy another one in a bigger size for 40% off. The sweater is cheaply made and scratchy."
1.0,The magnets are hard to connect and stay in place. They slide and the band can fall off. I’ve had several times when the watch is loose and almost fell off.
1.0,I returned this item. The product description needs to specify the smallest the handle wrap can be closed. It turned out to be too large for intended use (briefcase handle).
1.0,This product ripped while it was on from a simple shoulder movement. It fit very well but disappointment on quality. I wouldn’t recommend for quality. Size is true however
1.0,Don't like the material<br /> either
1.0,"Very small and broke within a few hours, not worth the money"
1.0,If you want tits to show... then this dress is amazing
1.0,"This is a cute and perfect size purse for me, but dang!! the light color was almost as bright as the sun!! I know, it said light, but didn't say bright-like-the-sun light.... So, I returned it and got a red one - darker color so I can't see everything that scratched it nor attached itself to it. Downsizing is good, but let's not advertise it..."
1.0,Tarnished and want replacement.  This was a gift
1.0,more for a child
1.0,run really small
1.0,"These are very pretty earrings, if you like putting them on from back to front and have very thin ear lobes. The cab on the front completely screws off of the back so you are left holding this tiny piece and trying to line it up while your are putting the post through the back of your earlobe. Then try to screw all that together. Yeah right...."
1.0,Bad lanses
1.0,"Large is not large, more like medium"
1.0,Look bigger on photo
1.0,Watch screen was frozen and no way to reset it or turn it off since the touchscreen does not work. I had to return the watch the next day.
1.0,"The pants did not come in the color I picked and it came in an ugly bright carpenter blue which again I did not order, the material was very thin and see through and nothing like described or pictured. DO NOT BUY. Ugly pants!"
1.0,Size too big and fabric not all that great
1.0,"Like the other SCAM CHINESE PRODUCTS this too will take your money and will not shipped your item to your house, like they did to me. It is the same thing with the other low quality china products that I bought directly to china. BEWARE THIS IS A SCAM!"
1.0,Very disappointed!!  NOT true to size.
1.0,"This bag is TINY. If all you carry is your drivers license, one other card, and a lipstick, then MAYBE you can make this bag work. If you need a couple Kleenex too then buy a bigger bag."
1.0,No me llegó el producto a mi casa
1.0,"I returned it. It's not a heathered gray like the picture. It's more of a flat, weird gray. The sleeve colors weren't accurate either. (This is the gray body with sweater like styled sleeves). The sleeves themselves were tight. The fabric itself was some weird thick bathing suit like material - I'm fairly certain there is not a single thread of cotton in it. I've NEVER returned an item to Amazon... until this icky cardigan. :-("
1.0,The ring was pretty. A lot chunkier than I thought. Unfortunately the ring tarnished in a week's time and left a black ring/mark on my finger. Very poor quality
1.0,I did not realize were womens shoes
1.0,"This has only been tried on, not actually worn for any period of time, but the color is coming off the one arm."
1.0,Fell apart in wash
1.0,Not as pictured. Not even close to current logo. No way this is GM licensed. No hologram license sticker. Cmon man!
1.0,Buy 2 sizes up if you want it to fit more than once
1.0,Too small. Wasn't able to wear it.
1.0,Not only did it arrive broken it appears a few pieces are missing.  I wasn't expecting fabulous necklace but I expect to be able to wear it at least once.  It would have cute bauble for fun. Oh well!
1.0,"I returned this sweater. I ordered an XXL but it was more like a medium. The asymmetrical cut looked strange and was not flattering. It did not look like it does in the picture. It was not loose at all. For reference I usually wear a M or L in US sizes, but wanted the loose fit. It was snug and ugly."
1.0,"First of all I should have know better that a $1,200 item would sell for $400.  There is no truth in that advertising!  The 14k gold was probably not and my bad for not opening it before I gifted it as it had a stone missing - this is a cheap imitation do not fall for it like I did!"
1.0,Very cheap guess I got what I paid for. Doesn’t stay shut when you tie it shut. Almost gave a group a people a show.
1.0,Snaps broke off 1st time
1.0,Sizing is way off. Order up like 3 sizes. UGH
1.0,Looks like a woman's ring on and looks very cheap.
1.0,These earrings are terrible. Way to big for children. They are very dingy and do not look safe to be worn. Several pair are missing stones. Terrible!! Return immediately.
1.0,"The lock was hard to open, fell off a couple of times and broke while wearing it.  The fact of the matter it is cheap quality... Pretty to look at but that is all."
1.0,Tienen graduacion
1.0,"The suit is very cute and I loved the color, but the material is too thin, flimsy. When I tried it on I felt like it would rip right off if I jumped into a swimming pool. Additionally, I’m typically a medium, but I ordered a large due to some of the reviews and it still felt too small."
1.0,Size fits but medium calf is still more like wide calf. Returned.
1.0,Too big for my 7 year old.
1.0,Website description was way off! When you stretch them out you have a white backing...looks awful!!
1.0,only last a week
1.0,I wanted to use my new hat for riding my bike to keep the sun off my head  and face...the brim is way to flimsy it won’t stay down it flips up so it doesn’t help keeping sun out of my face
1.0,"Awful, retuned...super cheap no design on the leaf looked like a piece of metal just hanging, no back for the earring...I know it was cheap but this is made from the metal you find in quarter machines for kids"
1.0,"RAN ONLY A FEW SECONDS THEN QUIT AND NOTHING ELSE..ALSO, THE INDIGLO LIGHT DID NOT WORK AT ALL AND THAT WAS THE REAL REASON I BOUGHT IT TO BEGIN WITH..SO I SENT IT BACK."
1.0,Viene muy grande y no trae la etiqueta
1.0,"It must been designed by Chinese for Chinese ladies...it is simply about 4-6  inch tooooo short for pendant. Not sure it is REAL OBSIDIAN, looks more like plastic instead of volcano stone."
1.0,It was super tiny I had to give it away to a little girl.
1.0,Looks like something you could get out of gumball machine
1.0,They were way smaller than I thought. Don't under stand why they are oversized 😑
1.0,Beautiful shorts! One minor problem zipper broke on first use.
1.0,Ordered an XL and it fits my 10 yr old neighbor. Smh
1.0,This was a ripoff. The shirt was too small and the cheap iron on design is also way smaller and lower in quality than was is shown here. Don't buy this garbage.
1.0,Way too small! Have to send back
1.0,"It took the longest any product has ever taken to ship and once I got it I was ridiculously disappointed, it’s extremely huge for a size Small and it drags easily 12 inches off the ground, It’s like material was just sewn together with zero measurements. Trying to return but only getting $2?"
1.0,The key holder string is super flemsy. Lost my front door building key bc of it literally on the second day that I got these. Do not recommend unless you are willing to replace the string for a sturdier one.
1.0,I ordered what was supposed to be the right size for me and it was huge.  I'm already a big girl so it looks like a mumu on me.  Even with leggings it just looks ridiculous. I have yet to wear it.
1.0,I got my right size and it was twice as small
1.0,"This is probably the worst dress I’ve ordered form amazon. The waist is more “empire” than natural waist, which makes it fit like a maternity dress and it is not flattering. The color is more salmon pink than a red. And the length is below the knee and looks very awkward. Will be returning."
1.0,Quality not as expected. Do not recommend.
1.0,Labeled rose gold but was almost totally gold
1.0,The product is very low quality. The ear pieces do not withstand  any type of pressure..if you try to press hard to get to the other end of the ear. It bends. Very disappointed
1.0,Beautiful watch. Will definitely buy another orient. The only reason for one star is that it doesn’t work for more than an hour so I have to return.
1.0,"I washed it before I even tried it on. It was pilly after just one wash. The fabric is wrong and does not drape right. It is cut wrong and lastly;<br /><br />I shredded on my body upon first wearing. I cannot even use it as a rag, because it is so bad. The company refunded it without even wanting it back. This is the third clothing item I have gotten from an Amozon third party partner. They have all been crap. Stick to actual Amazon items.<br /><br />I only gave it a star so I could post a review"
1.0,I was not happy that all the letters were not included. I needed the letter R and it was not included.
1.0,"Had one for about a week until it broke apart, all hollow and not well put together"
1.0,"Unfortunately, these simply didn't work for me.  They did not help with glare -just made everything yellow and slightly blurry. If anything, they made my night vision worse."
1.0,too small; much smaller than what is seen here
1.0,I ordered this in pink and black chevron and it came multi colored chevron. That was a big disappointment.
1.0,Save your $ unless you want a bathing suit box Tunic dress. Fit is tight in arms with no shape whatsoever dress. 95% Spandex 5% as advertised & also says on the tag. No it is NOT ! I hate it will be returning.
1.0,"Skirt was long/big, top too small"
1.0,"Too small for me and not my teenager's taste...so, I donated to the hoomeless."
1.0,It looked really good when it came in. One was too small. Then one that was to be a little  larger was just right. Shoe strap broke after 2nd wear.
1.0,Very unhappy with the fit and it was much shorter than I expected.
1.0,The worse material in the world. I wore it one time not even washed it but all fabric got fluffy and fade it.
1.0,"It's small, which I knew it would be, but I can't get past the interior lining - there's too much of it and it the excess fabric takes up valuable real estate inside the bag. Plus, you go to grab something out of your purse and you're left holding a bunch of fabric. The outside of the bag is nice quality, the inside is terrible."
1.0,Not what I wanted. I want real linen. These should be described as linen LOOK. Linen is made of flax. These are cotton.
1.0,Every tassel fell out!  As soon as I opened the bag they started falling out and were all over me and my house.
1.0,"These arrived ripped up in the back bottom area, AND it looked like someone stitched up the other areas that were ripped.  I buy on Amazon almost daily and this is the worst thing I have seen to arrive in such bad condition.  Sending back obviously right now."
1.0,Broke after just a few uses.
1.0,Dress is as described and would have been happy but was sent wrong color and size! Not a happy buyer.
1.0,"I ordered an XL for my girlfriend, as it stated would fit her. Once the package arrived she attempted to try it on. All that fit was one leg. The other couldn't even get in the item."
1.0,Horrible!!! Don’t waste your money.
1.0,The sleeves are not sewn the same .  One sleeve is shorter than the other.
1.0,"The print is HORRIBLE quality. Not like in the photos. For $14 I would expect a high quality printed image. It looks like big, faded pixels. $14 for one mask that looks like it should have been less than $5. It's also really small! This is a gift for my 11 year old niece, I think it is wayyy too small. Unbelievable."
1.0,Frames sat crooked on my face arms were not manufactured identical therefore sits uneven on my face. Unfortunately they do not allow returns i can’t even wear these.
1.0,Tony little cheap keychain. Broke upon arrival to me
1.0,Too small. Crappy material.
1.0,"I love the look, but was very disappointed in the fit  The class fit more like a large."
1.0,"This zipped up sweater is very cheaply made with a cheap fleece material where I can poke a hole through with just my fingers and the zippers gets stuck a lot. The Pom-poms are hard and not fluffy or furry. Finally, this is false advertisement!!! This zipped up sweater looks completely different from what the model is wearing in their display photos. I am completely disappointed, the shipping took a month to get here too! Buyers beware!"
1.0,Didn't fit 10yr old.
1.0,This item was supposed to ship with invisible straps which is why I purchased it. The invisible straps were missing from the package.
1.0,"Made in Chian and definitely not US sizing.  Pretty dress but way too small .  Also, no sales slip and no return info in package.......?"
1.0,Do not buy this watch. Looks cool but you get what you pay for. 1st I ordered a red outlined black on black watch. They sent me a green one. I contacted them and nothing. Said screw it and just wore it. 2 days after wearing it the skull inside the watch broke. Now it’s sounds like I’m god dam Santa Claus walking around with this loud half skull rattling around inside the dial. Don’t waste your money. If you have to buy a gift for a friends kid that you hate this is perfect. If not don’t.
1.0,"RIP OFF AND A PIECE OF JUNK<br />THE PICTURE IS OF ANOTHER ITEM.<br />IT'S CHEAP, AWFUL AND BAIT AND SWITCH."
1.0,"This dress was true to size . However, I am a 36D and this dress  size 14 female and this dress did not flatter in any way. Lovely design but cheap fabric. My already short torso looks even shorter in this."
1.0,"I bought this to use in dental setting, so this is not something you want to hand wash. Machine washing it will cause it to become horribly wrinkled, unlike my Cherokee scrubs. Do not get this brand if you plan to machine wash."
1.0,No point being camo since anyone could hear you coming from a mile away they make so much noise.
1.0,"Do not get these unless you are very small, these fit like juniors clothing. I typically wear size 10-12 and ordered the XL and could not even get them over my thighs. In the returning process now."
1.0,"Horrible, se me rompió al ponerlo. La tela un desastre"
1.0,The eye mask comes apart after a bit of use. The thread seams come undone.  And the mask leaves purple stains on pillow cases.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Some screws were missing! Very disappointed.
1.0,Mask Has two layers of thin material.  Pack of 5.  Two are coming apart near the binding.  One was not sewn very well.
1.0,Super cute but very tiny. The bookbag broke within two weeks of purchase.
1.0,"Not comfortable at all, I am 5’6, i was looking forward to size 12, not flexible, caused my lower legs to go numb."
1.0,This product was very hard to put into the shoes. I would not recommend.
1.0,"This purse might look cute, but is not worth one cent. Right away it broke in multiple, unrepairable places.  The strap broke off almost immediately.  The inner pockets ripped; yes, both of them. The zipper for the inner pocket fell off.<br />This all happened with very gentle use and was not returnable.  Unfortunately this was a total waste of my money and didn't even last me a month.  Save your money and buy anything but this purse."
1.0,"This Jacket took a while to get to me and I was completely disappointed when it did. It shed like crazy, It looked so cheap and almost matted and it was tiny. Returning the jacket was not an option. Seller said I needed to pay for return, and if it was damaged on its way back to China I wouldn’t get the refund. I honestly ended up putting it in the garbage."
1.0,The sunglasses I got were cute but.... I Didn't receive the sunglasses pictured. Getting my money back.
1.0,Horrible product. My belly button was red and irritated within hours of putting it on. It also doesn't screw on correctly and came bent
1.0,Key cannot fit a Suzuki Samurai according to ACE Hardware. Waited for 5 weeks for delivery.
1.0,"I ordered a 2x (I normally wear xl), and it's so small that it fits my sister who normally wears a medium. 😳😩"
1.0,"These are not maternity style nor did they fit my sister who is 5'6 130lbs, she is very slim and they were very awkward. Seller never got back to me about a return and this product took about 3weeks to ship to me."
1.0,Difficult to put on and painful. I had to force open in order to get them on my nose and they broke as a result.
1.0,"I ordered this dress in two sizes due to my measurements being between the guide for Medium and Large (for reference, I am 5'9"", chest 35, waist 28 and hips 41).  I was immediately disappointed upon opening the package.  The material is very cheap, almost see through and feels weird.  The dress looks like a Halloween costume!  I decided maybe they'd look better on me, so I tried them on... I couldn't get my arms into the medium - I did read in several reviews that the arms fit tight, so I was not too surprised - so I moved onto the large.  The fit was HORRIBLE!!  Tight arms, tight chest, VERY loose waist and the ""belt"" detail hit above my waist making me look very wide/as if I have no waist or curves.  The length was AWFUL.  This is supposed to be a long/floor length gown but it only extended down to about 5 inches above my ankles - yuck.  I was disappointed all around with the look and feel of this product!  Needless to say, I put the dresses right back in their packages and am returning them!  (They arrived Friday night, it is now Monday morning).  Don't waste your time.  I am happy to say I found a beautiful gown for half the price at Charlotte Russe for the event I had ordered these dresses for."
1.0,"Suppose to be 2x, size said 2x, but had to give to a friend. This was NOT a 2x, more like medium"
1.0,These are not for wide calves. Way too tight.
1.0,It’s trash.
1.0,"Very poor quality,  one of them tore the very first time I tried to use them."
1.0,I love the material and the style.  The only problems I had was I had to order 3 sizes larger than what I wear.  It took 3mo. to get it and it was a 2 day delivery.[[ASIN:B072ZC6CJR ROMWE Women's Tunic Swing T-Shirt Dress Short Sleeve Tie Dye Ombre Dress Multicolor XXXXXL]]
1.0,So cheaply made fell apart INSTANTLY
1.0,"if you are going for the look in the pic, do not buy."
1.0,"Pretty flimsy, thin, and extremely short. Maybe it would work as a swim cover up but its really poorly made."
1.0,Wore it once and it ripped in the back while I was at work! Very poorly made.
1.0,"Beautiful,  but need to be polished every time before wearing"
1.0,"Somewhat small, and the quality is subpar. I returned it right away. Not a bargain at all."
1.0,"Received wrong item twice. Ordered silver and received gold both time, I have in rose and lived it and wanted silver."
1.0,"I don’t like it! I want to buy the thick one but it is very so thin! It doesn’t describe my expectations! In winter, it is so cold!"
1.0,Dosent fit right in the top to loose in the chest area and tight on the bottom
1.0,No es como la foto . Se mancho sin usarlo<br />Quiero reembolso.
1.0,"I wanted to like these glasses so bad.  I was actually looking for a Mui Mui dupe, but these are NOT IT!  The model's head must be extremely small or my head must be gigantic, because the glasses that I received are anything but oversized... My face isn't even that big, but whatever.  The most frustrating thing is that the actual lenses give me double vision in a blue color, which is ridiculously unsafe whilst driving.  These ended up being quite the bust and I really don't recommend them at all!"
1.0,wasn't very vibrant in color......too small to use as a tote
1.0,What it's worth. Likes to re-set itself at random. Super touchy.
1.0,Watch was not working as soon we took out of the box
1.0,"I just got it and was so excited to try it out, until the first try broke 😞 Disappointed ☹️"
1.0,charged it up and and was happy with it... used it as a &#34; find the poop light&#34; when i walked my dog late at night... i swapped for a better light (i have several) for poop patrol & placed it on my keyring instead... in less than two months i went too use it again i found the battery dead... so i charged it and no go even though this was only the 2nd charge to be given... charge cable is fine 'cause i charged up a different item earlier...
1.0,"first band broke within one day and when received second it broke within two days, just getting into my car. Both came apart at the pin where the band attached to the watch"
1.0,Dress cute but too small for me
1.0,Broke before I even wore it
1.0,Runs way too small<br />And fits even tighter
1.0,Horrible quality!! See photos above! Item was all scratched up on the back and front was very grungy and faded looks like it was used!!
1.0,fell apart in the water.
1.0,Fit was sooooo tight I cut the skirt off
1.0,"Super excited to get this, only to have the zipper break off in my hand. It fitted pretty tight even though I based my sizing off of the chart."
1.0,"Not like the picture. The jeans fit, however, the style was boot cut NOT skinny Jean fitting."
1.0,"I ordered the navy in a small last month, liked it so much that I ordered the green size small. See picture, the green way larger than the navy. Unfortunately, have to return!"
1.0,"Not same as picture, but breathable material!"
1.0,Pain in the ass to open and close
1.0,Love the fit. Love the pockets.<br /><br />Tore hole in back after 3 weeks :-(
1.0,Too good to be true. Very fake looking. Celine wanna be.. but miss the mark!
1.0,Gave to a friend instead of returning it
1.0,It's t-shirt material. I thought a cardigan was always made of yarn.
1.0,Thoroughly inspect this item! After laying it out I was hugely disappointed.
1.0,"This vest is extremely lightweight. Adjustments make it way to small or way to large. Unable to get a good fit. Upon activating the heat cycle, it did not appear to heat up as advertised. Had the setting on high as it was about 18 degrees outdoors and could barely feel any heat at all. Overall I’m disappointed in this vest. In the process to return it for a refund."
1.0,"I ordered two of these, in pink and blue. They were much flimsier than I expected, but they seemed like a good idea. When I went to pack with the pink one, I discovered that when you fill up the packing cubes, the thing won't close--you kind of roll it closed, and then it is too bulky to fit in the suitcase--and I don't have a small suitcase. Along with that, by folding it you create all sorts of unused pockets, that take up space. So I just used it for a garment bag, although I have a couple already that are much better quality.<br /><br />I gave the blue one away to a kid, thinking he'd have fun with it. But lo and behold, 3 of the 4 buckle things don't work - the clip is one size and the clasp another. I've written to RuMe about this issue, but haven't heard from them yet. Not that it matters, but mine is now missing a clip, as I gave the kid the one clip (from my bag) that would help fix his bag. I can't change out the other wrong clips, as they are not replaceable."
1.0,I do not recommend these unless you want everyone to hear you coming for miles because they make such a loud farting sound when walking. I also had to cut off a significant piece to make them fit in my shoe. Going back to the pink ones that fit right out of the box AND do not embarrass me when walking. Plus it is just annoying as heck to hear that while walking around.
1.0,The fabric was very poor quality.  And the size was much bigger than expected.  The product was not represented at all accordingly.<br /><br />I returned it same day.
1.0,Sizing bizarre!  Arms very long & ordered the XXL & I take a size 14 in us sizes. So if your over size 12 don't waste your time.  Very disappointed. Print is very pretty.
1.0,Way too small. Disappointed
1.0,"Cute hat, but the stitching came apart the 1st day. I'd really like a replacement!"
1.0,The mask did not work... needless to say my son was upset
1.0,"Very cheap material looking, too dark ugly color afraid to stain skin or cause an skin infection. Will not use them."
1.0,"I have never wrote a review before because I have not felt the need to. However I ordered this item for my daughters Christmas. They arrived promptly (Thank you Amazon!). However the first day we used them the stitching began to come out. Also the way they are designed there was nothing to hold the chap stick in the carrier:(<br />I ended up removing all the stitching and re sewing the material so that there was a flap over the top of the the chap stick tube. I also added a small patch of velcro so the flap would secure the chap stick. Now they work fine. I wouldn't buy these again, I'd jsut make my own at home!"
1.0,Pain in the a$$ to put on.
1.0,Just buy a box of garbage bags take two out and wear them.  Waste of money I could not return them fast enough
1.0,"Too small, material cheap"
1.0,"I was really excited to get this because it looks cool and it's nickel-free. (I have a nickel allergy.)<br />My ears are on the slightly larger side, so I had to manipulate it to try to get it to fit on my ear.  Even when I got the dragon's chin to fit on my tragus (the cartilage in front of the canal), it wouldn't sit right.  After multiple manipulations, it finally broke because it is so weak/thin.<br />I do not plan on ordering a replacement."
1.0,This is a very bad material I’m not happy with it 😢
1.0,I wore it twice and it ripped when I took it off.
1.0,They fell apart after wearing one time which was very embarrassing because they were gifts.
1.0,"This is not a cotton linen blend.  It is polyester/cotton, paper thin with a weird plastic feel and a chemical smell that is very strong.  Also, they are not draw string, as stated in the advertisement.  Returning today.  Shipping was 5.99!  Extremely cheap, stinky, and not as advertised.  Very disappointed."
1.0,It's cheap material
1.0,"This product says it fits an Inspire 3, does not.  Is too large to attach to watch.  Asked for a full refund."
1.0,IT TURNED BLACK IN 3 DAYS
1.0,The watch is less than one month old and has stopped working.
1.0,"The fit was great. They shaped my curves perfectly. However, not impressed with material/fabric. They look old and worn after wearing only twice."
1.0,"They are horrible.  The edges are raveling, some of the stitches didn’t catch the fabric, even after washing and fabric softener, they are stiff and thin."
1.0,The colors are hard to apply and not that creamy. Only the top is glittery.
1.0,Top of shirt is too big yet plaid area has no stretch to fit over chest.
1.0,Clasp keeps detaching from rubber cord!!!
1.0,This is very deceiving in size and quality. The earrings looks old and rusted but necklace color was okay. Disappointed.
1.0,It’s not a real Britton hat and the quality is beyond poor. Super cheap quality and looks damaged.
1.0,"They fade just after 10 washes. They are supposed to be tough (cargo pants) and they cost as much as any other but are cheap fabric. The seller does not respond either, you are on your own."
1.0,"Broke after first wear. First the second hand broke off and was floating around in the watch, then a few days later it completely stopped working."
1.0,Paint peeled off even before wearing the shirt. Had to return it and ate the shipping fee.
1.0,"You get what you paid for, cheap gloves. They really don't keep you warm all that much. And they form holes pretty quick. I would invest in ones that are a little thicker."
1.0,"cheap not a good buy, returned."
1.0,"Collar and cuff constructed with very cheap material, undermining quality and appearance."
1.0,Returned doesn’t look the same
1.0,"I actually purchased these at Tarjay, and they were on clearance for a reason. They suck. When I first put them on my 14 month old they were so cute, and I was relieved that she wouldn't be slipping throughout the house. At the end of the day, the seam that holds the sole of the sock to the rest of it was unraveling and the sole with the grips was falling off of one sock. So disappointing because these were really adorable and warm when they were intact. But seriously...ONE DAY of use, and they were done.  ONE DAY."
1.0,"It says good ""for little girls"" but I don't think they are big enough even for a little girl!<br />Do not waste your money on these tiny things!"
1.0,The material it was made with disappointed me.
1.0,This shirt was 2 cute but was to small..I order my husband size 2XXL and he normally wears this size in everything..this size is normally just a lil bi..please order at least 2 sizes bigger.
1.0,They broke within 2 weeks of wearing them
1.0,Way to gig and not a nice finish<br /> Not pleased.
1.0,"The glasses never turned on... :-(<br /><br />I still wore them and they were cool, but would have been really cool if they worked"
1.0,"Very poor quality, so cheap looking!"
1.0,"To small, cheap and not whats shown"
1.0,"The Jipin Alhambra Spinner has some wonderful qualities. The are exterior is surprisingly roomy with a great zipper separation with a small garments holder. It also has a longer than average handle that makes it easy for my tall husband to pull. Unfortunately, the reasons that i love this product do not outweigh its serious negative side. Your handles and unreliable and short lived. One our first trip using luggage, the large suitcase and carry on suitcase, they slowly fell apart. The carry on did not even make it upstairs from the garage with out loosing its side handle. The large luggage lost its top handle as it was being pulled out of the trunk in the airport garage. So, we are not even on the plane for the first trip and have broken 2 of the luggage handles. The other handles survived sitting in a hotel room for the weekend and their trip to the airport but when the large one came through baggage claim it was missing both handles. Let me tell you how difficult it is to get a 50 lbs bag into a car with out any handles. On a short weekend trip using 2 pieces of this 3 piece luggage set we lost 3 handles. I have never been so disappointed in a product in my life. Thank you Jipin for such a disappointing experience."
1.0,They won’t stick whatsoever. They just keep falling off my daughter’s ears.
1.0,"Not happy with purchase! Not the same color and clasp broke as soon as it was removed from packaging!! Top is one I received, I ordered the bottom one.."
1.0,Way more blue than black. Was almost a totally blue shirt.
1.0,"To small, my soon can't use it"
1.0,"This is not the color of this ring.  I have tried ordering it twice it comes as a black ring.  Don't waste your time, just order the black one.  I do like these rings though, everyone asks about it.  I like the size and the weight of these.  I would really like to get this color too but it seems impossible.<br /><br /> UM Jewelry Mens Stainless Steel Biker Signet..."
1.0,Why are all the stones falling out of my bracelet and now it's don't even look new I am very disappointed I really really like this bracelet
1.0,The material is worse than a cheap scarf. The color of orange 🍊 is similar to a Halloween costume. Not chic at all. It looks good in the photo but not solid wear at all. Poor quality for sure. I am going to return ASAP so I can get a credit for something else.
1.0,Not anything like the picture and what are the plastic things no instructions
1.0,Very chaeply made and cheap looking.
1.0,"This is an absolutely horrible product. It is very low quality and looks simply repulsive. I just opened and viewed it, and if the Post Office was open right now, it would be there instead of in my home. I believe that this product is an insult to consumers. I am obviously returning this sandals ASAP."
1.0,Top is beautiful and cute BUT Pants were way small for a size &#34;Small&#34; And they shipped me a damaged item. Pants had not 1 not 3 rips on it. Material is not that good either. Had to return it
1.0,Don’t get it. Unless you don’t want to be able to see anything and have a camel 🐪 toe from hell!
1.0,Not accurate in size
1.0,"Great fit, great look, super comfortable. Typically a 9.5 but the 10 fit great. I ordered the steel toe specifically for work. I ended up rolling a full tire rack over my toe. Thought it was fine because it was steel toe but I ending up breaking two bones because they were soft toe. Product cost me a few thousand in medical bills."
1.0,Tore within an hour of use...runs small
1.0,Con -<br />the dress came with no label and no tag. Like as if some one just stitched it and sent to me. I am hence giving it 1 star. Don’t even know if it is used or new.<br /><br />Pro-<br />I am like 128 lbs and around 5’3” tall and the dress fits well including height. Got size S. Not too long. It is pretty. The neck is also not too deep.
1.0,I bought a large. Usually wear a medium. It's to fitted. The zipper hangs down on your palm and annoying. I am 5'8&#34; 155pounds.<br />I would like to return it
1.0,"It did give me good support in my lower back, but it is way too bulky. it is not form fitting at all nor is it cute in any way shape or form lol."
1.0,Only offered a medium. It fit like a small
1.0,Colors was not what I expected. The yellow is tan with only one small yellow stripe in the whole scarf. I wanted it for U of M colors and it won’t work. Returned all 5 I bought.
1.0,"Unfortunately these are blurry and unusable.  The +1.50 set I bought from the same company work beautifully.  I wonder if pushing the magnification is the issue.  These are the +1.75 and they are like looking through a drinking glass - fuzzy, blurry, warped."
1.0,Junk! Save your money and go somewhere else! Screen cracked on the first day from installation!
1.0,"This is very pretty, but it twists and kinks a lot while it's on. Kind of a pain to untwist."
1.0,POOR QUALITY AND DOES NOT FIT AT ALL!!  I would not buy anything from this seller ever again!
1.0,"The rings does not have the round clip on each side, so the one side feels like it's piercing your nose. Don't waste your money."
1.0,I wear usually a xl to xxl if I want a baggie sweater.  I ordered a 3xl because I read it ran small...lol...well the 3xl is more like a size LG!!
1.0,"I LOVED this cardigan the first time I wore it, but the second time I wore the cardigan it ripped a huge hole near the armpit when I put my arms in it. It can probably be fixed but needless to say I was very sad. I’m going to try to message the seller and see if they have a recommended way to fix it."
1.0,"Just about had them for 2 months and the seam around the underwire is already coming loose, causing the underwire to dig painfully into me skin."
1.0,Didn't begin to fit and I ordered the same size I do with other brands. It's in the mail on its way back.
1.0,I bought 2 different sizes and neither worked. The elastic does not stay where it is supposed to stay and hold things in place. The top of bathing suit does not stay in place if you have big girls because there is no support what so ever. The elastic across the back doesn’t stay flat. Swim suit not flattering at all.
1.0,This product runs very small! It's not stretchy at all. I'm usually in a XL or 1x. I ordered a 2x and it still ws too small!
1.0,This could be so cute-- but order SEVERAL sizes up! I ordered a 1x because I wanted it loose (normally a med-lg) and I could barely get it on. I measured it and it is not to the measurements that were listed on the size chart. It's going back...
1.0,"I bought three pairs of these for our young children to replace ones that were similar but had a clip in the back (convenient for on and off, but broke quickly). I wanted these because they didn’t have that clip that broke so quickly.  Unfortunately, these goggles instantly fill up with water on all three children. The seal around the face is horrible. Tags are off and got wet from the pool water so I can’t return. Bummer."
1.0,Poor quality. Don't recommend for jewelry making.
1.0,I literally don’t know how anybody could possibly use this as a functional ear cuff. Does not serve its purpose whatsoever. I read other bad reviews & thought maybe they were just being dramatic. I thought I’d be able to maybe bend it to stay on my ear if I try hard enough. Absolutely not lol
1.0,Didn’t like the fabric seamed really short but very wide! Colors where nice
1.0,"Maybe it's because I have boobs, but it was so short that said boobs would show if I raised an arm. And I am only 5'2 on a tall day, so my torso is short anyway."
1.0,Not self supporting on its own (like the pic). Flops around whatever contents are inside. I returned mine.
1.0,"seam  was off center,cap bill crooked,was disappointed with the bad sew job,other wise it was a beautiful product,would purchase again if seam was straight down the middle bad job sewing it together hate crooked sewing seams!!!!! looks cocked eyed on head ........"
1.0,This was horrible. Didn't look anything like the picture. Color was totally different. Fit was horrible and so was the fabric. It was like stuff and almost plasticy. Returned it.
1.0,this literally broke a day after I bought. don’t waste your money.
1.0,"The item received was used and the fit was not as advertised, Way too small !!"
1.0,These are cheap chinese knock offs. They aren't actually surgical steel
1.0,Will not stay in mouth
1.0,Not the same size at all.
1.0,Not impressed.  The buttons hardly fit in holes.  I had to sew the clips back on on the sleeves to hold the piece that will hold the sleeve back the very day I received them. Would not buy or recommend.
1.0,Listen to the other reviews. Unless you have TINY ears this thing sucks &#62;. &#60;
1.0,Thin material.  Sent it back
1.0,I cannot figure out how to put it on.
1.0,"I’ve purchased several pairs of leggings and were all great, but recently they have changed to a terrible material and are nothing like the previous ones. And they want me to pay to ship them back! This happened with my friend as well."
1.0,The belt does not have Velcro on the inside. They are lying about the product and need to change the picture...... other than that the belt works great
1.0,"It broke! I guess it’s not a flexible string and I got this for my best friend and she said it broke. So read lol... and if you want the stretchy band, do not buy this one!"
1.0,I'm usually a 36B. I got this in a 36D and it fit. The wire fell out the second time I wore it and it is clearly extremely poor quality. DO NOT BUY
1.0,cheap quality<br />kept hoops only and tossed the rest
1.0,Chain broke after first use
1.0,This item was so small and tight a large fit my 13 year old daughter who is tiny!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,This was so thin and if you don't sew on another layer the bunched up sewn in spots rub on your face very uncomfortable
1.0,It's very big. I'm size small but this jeans runs like XXL.  Very disappointed with that
1.0,"Not happy about it, the shoulder is easy stretch down"
1.0,Bought this shirt for a retreat so I mainly wore it to the ceremonies (have multiple colors). It’s comfortable but the seams began to tear after the first use.
1.0,This was so tangled I never got to even wear it :(
1.0,"Very pretty. Broke the day I received it. I’m a professional beader and jeweler. Was so disappointed. But, there is nothing about the product that misrepresents. They infer that it’s cheap and it is. I’m fab at repairing and was able to use my glue process. But, ultimately trashed the whole idea."
1.0,"I was very excited when I received the belt.<br /><br />Unfortunately after a few days, the color on the edges began to wear off.<br /><br />I guess I will go with a higher quality belt in the future."
1.0,I gave them to my daughter who wears a medium. Returned the second pair I purhased.
1.0,I will be tossing these in the trash. So cheap looking. The tassels are glued to the metal.
1.0,"Look cheap, returning"
1.0,Runs very very small.  3x was more like a large.
1.0,Worked somewhat for a few months and then only ran sporadically.  Dead by 9 months.
1.0,Horrible dress. Fit like a bag. Actually gave it to goodwill.
1.0,"The earrings are light weight and appear plastic. That might have been ok just for a fun pair of earrings, but the pattern/colors did not match up except on the largest pair of earrings. As you can see in my photo, one earring of the small pair had no pattern and didn't even resemble a mate to the other earring. I rated this only 1 star because I'm surprised there was no ""quality control"" and these earrings were actually sent to me, the customer. A huge disappointment. Hopefully this was just a fluke because I would rate the packaging 5 stars (see photo). Definitely a nice presentation and suitable for gift giving."
1.0,"The day I received it, I processed the return. Very cheap quality I would not even pay a dime for it."
1.0,Very poor quality. Dont waste your money.
1.0,The material was too thin and the back was much lower than I anticipated.
1.0,The string to tighten the top of boot ripped on second wear. Don’t waste your money
1.0,Necklaces were too large.  We unable to make them as a choker style.  The string was too thin as well.  Returned
1.0,Not as advertised per &#34;size&#34;.
1.0,I got this for my wife and she only wore it for a week and it has torn
1.0,"Very disappointed.  It is 3MM, not 4MM.  I measured it as well as compared it to 4MM yellow gold rope necklaces that I had purchased for my wife."
1.0,Cheap looking and material
1.0,I have had one stuck in my ear now for a few days. Going to try and see if I can have it professionally removed so hopefully no damage is done to my earlobe. They’re cute but I will never wear them again because of this issue.
1.0,"Was not to fit a 2x,runssmall"
1.0,Way too small. The material is a little abrasive. Overall I was not happy with this socks.
1.0,I bought another animal print band on Amazon and it was super cute.<br />This one looks like l got it out of a bubblegum machine.<br />Look elsewhere!
1.0,The blue shorts were stretchy and felt great. The other two colors seemed a lot smaller and would not go up to my waist. They were tight on the booty area. Will not buy them again due to inconsistency in sizing/fit.
1.0,"Lenses didn’t fit entirely on the frame, there’s only one screw to adjust and nothing else could be done to adjust the section where the lense didn’t make contact with the frame."
1.0,The size was good but material pulled and ran on either side of front insert. Will not buy again
1.0,Received the Glasses and cracked with scratched lenses
1.0,"they were falling apart ! I wish they looked like in the picture, thank god I could return them, and get my money back - those are trash seriously!"
1.0,Came w a torn sleeve
1.0,"I never give bad reviews but I need to do it this time.  I had the pleasure of purchasing this dress same brand in early 2019 or late 2018 the material was a lovely thick cotton, and fitted my small frame perfectly, the knee length was just right.  So I ordered another one Dec 2019 to replace it as the colour wasnt nice and bright after months of heavy wear, which is fine.<br /><br />This is not the same dress that is bought just some months ago. To be clear this would be the 2nd purchase of the same dress from the same supplier. This dress looks like it was just someone who followed the pattern and produced the dress. The material is extremely thin and cheap, it is very large, it extremely long as in mid ankle, the material is definitely see through.  I shouldn't have bought a second dress obviously.  I wish I could I could get my money back, but sadly I am quite in the Caribbean and it would cost me more than I paid to buy and ship the dress here."
1.0,Hate it
1.0,The mask sucks just stop selling this garbage.
1.0,Me podrían ayudar ya que no me han llegado y le escribe a la boutique Melissa y me informaron que es directamente con Amazon
1.0,I didn’t even try it on - it smelt so strongly of gasoline when I opened the bag that I couldn’t even stand to try it on. Very disappointed.
1.0,The color on top runs off after about two weeks of wear.  Color rubbing off from putting hands in pockets.  Good for though.
1.0,The tiny frog 🐸 was broken! And after wearing the other two got discolored to light brown color after one day! I have pictures but can't include them because your app is not working properly 😒
1.0,They changed color not stainless at all.
1.0,"I really like this suit. Plus it fits awesome. However, I ordered one and it came without the swim shorts. So I returned it and ordered another one. This one came with the shorts but had a couple of stains that looked like ink in the white areas. One was very noticeable in the front around my belly area.  Decided to not try ordering a third time."
1.0,2 days after the return window one of the finger seams split and there was no path to contact the seller.<br />They really aren't any better than the pair of mittens over gloves that I was already wearing.
1.0,"When I received my package, it was Empty!!"
1.0,"I can't even give one star but to leave a comment I do not have a choice. The purse did not last two weeks of use! One strap came off, the brackets are pulling away with edges that are so sharp that when I attempted to fix the bracket it cut my finger. So not happy!"
1.0,"While the patterns and design seem to fit the description, these masks include a card in the box specifically stating they ""cannot be used for virus protection masks."" If you're looking for Covid coverage, move on."
1.0,Shirt arrived with a hole in the back like a tag was ripped off. Returned quickly. Very disappointed
1.0,These were not even remotely warm.
1.0,"the nose is cut too narrow, these dont even fit my kids"
1.0,"I loved this necklace when my husband have it to me for christmas, but after only a couple of weeks of wear the &#34;opal pieces&#34; started falling out and melting. I have a picture, but am unsure how to post it here. Save your money, look elsewhere."
1.0,Do not buy! China sizes run super super small! I ordered an extra large and received a doll looking sweater that fit my daughter who wears an XS
1.0,"If you want to loose your watch, buy this band. The clips that attach it to the watch will not hold."
1.0,The words are already peeling off and it just came out of the package. Lame!
1.0,Didn't fit me at all. I ordered my usual size and these just aren't true to size. Way too small and don't look like actual jeans at all. Uncomfortable and sized weird. Returned
1.0,De ponen oscuros y feos súper rapido
1.0,"Bought this as a birthday present for my hedgehog-obsessed daughter and she had it for a total of four hours before the shaft broke at the handle. For $23, one would think it would at least last a few months."
1.0,It was ok I gave it to my mom it didn't work for me but she liked it alot.
1.0,Awful.
1.0,"I'm a huge fan of Adidas sportswear. I own almost a dozen Adidas track suits. This is the poorest quality suits I've ever owned. After wearing the jacket for less than a week, the front already started to ball up.  It's not what I expect from an Adidas product - very dissatisfied."
1.0,"The fact that the description says “loose” is beyond comical. I ordered a size up from my usual size and what I got was a tight fitting t-shirt that hits about an inch below my belly button. It’s not even long enough to be an actual shirt!<br />I bought this for a semi casual rehearsal dinner and had to scramble to find something else because, clearly, the extra tight belly shirt I received wasn’t going to fit the dress code."
1.0,"This item looks to have a very low quality. Indeed, after one week in the drawer (yes, I have not worn it at all, or washed) the white written is peeling off. I cannot imagine what is going to happen when I will wash it."
1.0,"came fast , looked beautiful wore 1 day stones fell out"
1.0,One of these pairs has two different gauges.
1.0,"Very comfortable water sock/shoe, however, after half a day at the water park, my daughter’s shoes had a hole in them. They material didn’t withstand the concrete, water slides, and pools."
1.0,Does not fit as advertised runs very small
1.0,Sent back sized like for a child
1.0,The boots smelled so bad that I had to place them in a trash bag outside.  They still smell so bad that I refuse to put them in my car to take them to the UPS Store to return them.  I can’t imagine what is in the rubber that makes them so horribly smelling but it’s a complete shame because the boots are cute as can be.  I’m eating the cost because I don’t want to visit this odor upon anyone else involved in the shipping process.  I messaged the seller but never got any response whatsoever.  I found some nice garden boots on another site I’m quite happy with.
1.0,"The bracelet is nice, but I found the quality of the leather to be very poor. I also thought the bracelet was a &#34;wrap&#34; style, and it's not. I returned it."
1.0,Get 3 sizes to big. This does not fit at all correctly.
1.0,The little plastic nose guard fell of the first day and I was never able to get it back on so the glasses are completely useless to me.
1.0,"this belt is not as it looks .  its cheap, looks like and feels like dollar store junk. don't waste your money. also it took 4 weeks for it  to get here"
1.0,"Too small, the 3x didn't fit at all. it is more of a XL and labeled 3x. I found someone else who could use it."
1.0,Strings hanging off every stitch and every button. Sweet.
1.0,Fits but just try to unsnap it once and watch the snaps fall off! junk
1.0,Not a lot of people know how this hat was created but legend says that it is sewn on from the needles of compasses used by second lieutenants.
1.0,"I really gave these an honest try but finally had to remove them. They do hold your eyewear in place but unless you're bald, they will painfully pull your hair just above your ears every time you move or take your glasses off.  Basically just traded one problem for another.  Therefore, personally, I would not recommend...but for the price you might give them a try anyway if loose eyewear is a problem for you...good luck."
1.0,Belt would not latch.
1.0,"It arrived with a stone missing, the setting is lifting off, and after less than a week the black color is rubbing off. I am returning it."
1.0,Returned. Poor quality shirt.
1.0,"Broke in 2 weeks. To be fair, I'm a maintenance for a large church so I have about 20 keys to carry. If it's for casual use, it may be okay? Maintenance guys not good enough!"
1.0,Very cheap item.  Do not order.  Did not even include a keychain.  Takes FOREVER to ship also.
1.0,All of these have fallen apart in the few times I've worn them.  Buyer beware!  I also noticed some seams are stitched with orange thread.  How cheap can you be?!?  Yuck.
1.0,Rusted really fast. It’s cute but don’t get it wet at all.
1.0,These are terrible! The plastic is super cheap and flimsy. Returned!!
1.0,I would not recommend this bracelet. The leather loop that you attach the clasp to broke the first time I put it on.
1.0,"This was made of horrible material, it was very cheap feeling and looking. Not worth your hard earned money."
1.0,I received mine and the pieced of the metal was loose and break very easy. It is cute but not worth the money .
1.0,fell apart at 1st washing
1.0,"I ordered this for a trip to go to another state to see my Daughter and it came weeks after and it does not fit,cuz it's not true to size!! Most of All Shame on Amazon for getting anything from China!! Thanks a lot for sticking me with Crap!! I'm stuck with it and can't get my money back,so it's going in the Trash!! What a waist of my HARD earned money! You need to tell people where it's coming from, before it's ordered!! Shame on You.!!"
1.0,The reviews seem to be referring to a yoga mat not the vest....
1.0,Way too small for the arms.
1.0,"Totally disappointed...the words in the description, vintage and distressed, should not be used at all. This jacket is bright red. I've owned distressed leather jackets and this doesn't even come close to qualifying as one. Buyer beware."
1.0,Fell apart after 1 wash
1.0,"The fit was correct.  However, the navy blue dress I received does not look like the pictures.  The lace top part is one shade of blue, and the knit skirt is a different shade.  The lace insets on the skirt bottom are a third shade.  Looks bad.  Will be returning."
1.0,"Very low quality. Looks way cheap, nothing like the picture. Even though is relatively cheap, there are other options of better quality. It’s not worth the price"
1.0,Didn’t work.
1.0,I thought the wrong band was sent so I requested to return it and reordered.  Apparently the manufacturer thinks this off-white band is gray.
1.0,Not happy  with this item
1.0,"I started wearing these adorable festive watch bands shorty after Thanksgiving, and already, they’re cracked and fading! They’re also not the soft silicone but more of a plastic, so not as comfortable to wear. If you’re looking for something cheap and short-term, you’ve found it.  Don’t expect to wear them for more than a few weeks. Very disappointed!"
1.0,"it sucks, damaged on the way here, after 3 weeks at least."
1.0,"When I tightened it, the crown and button lost its ability to move, press down. Garbage fit."
1.0,Cheap and was broken upon arrival
1.0,"These were such a disappointment. My 8 year old could barely get it over his head and it was super tight and my 10 year couldn't even get it over his head.  And of course, I can't return them do to COVID."
1.0,Too small and not made very well.
1.0,They felt very cheap when they arrived. The side tore apart with 10 wears. Absolutely not worth it! I’m paying the extra money for a quality pair from a well known brand.
1.0,Super cheap. Red paint scratched off just from my handling it. Do not recommend.
1.0,Too small for my hand I have small hands as well and it still cuts off my circulation. It came broken in the mail also.
1.0,I was sent an throwback Tampa bay hoodie. NOTHING LIKE WHAT WAS PICTURED
1.0,Dont wast your money it looks cheap and i receveived it broken .
1.0,Thing showed up broken. Besides that it is FAR too small for a face.
1.0,Product runs very small. I'm a US 8 and the size L/XL was waaaaaaay too small. The leggings are VERY hot which would be great in the winter IF they had other sizes of leggings I could purchase...
1.0,I bought two pairs for my son. Both broke same day. Cheapest things ever. He didn't realize I could probably send them back so he just threw them in the trash. What a waste of my money. Lens fell out of both pair as soon as he put them on.  Ridiculous!
1.0,I like the dress and the material is good. Perfect for summer but I’m giving it one star because I don’t understand why it has a full length zipper but only zips halfway down. It makes absolutely no sense! I wasn’t about to fight with the dress by pulling it over my head when it has a zipper. I’m wondering if it’s a malfunction or if this is just how the dress is made. I’m returning it if it’s really  made like this. Too bad because it’s really a cute dress.
1.0,I couldn’t put it into my nose the ball at the end had some rough uneven texture that scraped my piercing
1.0,Arrived very small and I ordered sizes larger then what I normally wear. Shirt looks cute for a kid or an underweight adult.
1.0,Picture does not represent reality - at all
1.0,These shorts are not cut properly.  I’ve been more comfortable running naked.  These things are not appropriate for running. I sized up and still have issues with chafing.
1.0,I didn't know it was see-through...
1.0,Didn't fit right.  Cheaply made.
1.0,"This choker is stiff and curved for wear at the base of the neck, NOT high on the neck as pictured.  Do not buy of you're looking for a choker that stretches!!"
1.0,Bracelet goes loose<br />Does not stay tight on wrist
1.0,This shirt runs really small.  I ordered an xl I normally wear a large and it was way too small could barly get out if it.  Sent it back
1.0,THe necklace came broken... disappointed in the product.
1.0,"Most positive reviews in this product page are for a hat, not the luggage. Be aware!"
1.0,I was unable to use the dress as it was cut very small.  My intention is to return the dress.  It wouldn't fit my sister whose a size 16.
1.0,"This belt should be sold for $5.00,poor quality."
1.0,"I purchased backers a couple of years ago from this same vendor and they were great!  When I ordered them last week, I did not receive the same product.  The silver cylinder is shorter on the new product and does not cover the sharp points on the pins!  You have to carefully adjust the backer to cover the pin, but then the pins are too loose.  I wish they sent the same product as pictured!  Very disappointed!!!!"
1.0,"I followed the chart, and it was way too small!! So disappointed."
1.0,"See through material, poorly tailored.  Unflattering to any figure."
1.0,Necklace too tangled
1.0,The toe piece came off within 5 min of my son dancing.
1.0,Hated these hard to fasten and look even cheaper than they are
1.0,It needs a giant face not the normal one. It's very big. Take care before you buy it or you will regret. The worst thing is that it came without a case or even a cloth.
1.0,"it gets the job done makes you sweat but i was hoping it was more binding and waist training like giving you a figure, i still looked very squared. but i will continue to use it as it does make my stomach area sweat more."
1.0,Washed once and 3 seams are already coming apart. I know i picked a more affordable hoodie but it's still over $30. I can't believe this is classified as work wear... you can't build a sandwich much less work construction and expect this jacket to hold up. It's very cheaply made. Double your investment get the Carhartt and quit enabling companies like this to rip off the working man. Your products are insulting to those of us who actually work for our money.
1.0,I am a cold-footed woman and have worn these to bed every night since they arrived.  Thanks.
1.0,Terrible. Kept coming off. Not easy.
1.0,white is see though like tissue paper
1.0,There was no sash that came with the dress. Thank God I had time before my wedding so I could return it and look for something else...
1.0,The gray sleeves are 6 1/2 inches long. The black sleeves are 7 1/2 inches long. Neither pair will stretch so that is not a solution. The widths are correctly described. They are too short to be effective. They are being returned.
1.0,These were very inexpensive so just know they are not going to last long.
1.0,"Bought in July, used it for almost 3 months and it broke resulting in me losing my keys while walking thru the mall. My return window closed so I am stuck with a broken Keychain. Wouldn't recommend"
1.0,Sleeves way too long. Small in busy area.
1.0,Dont ever buy 32inch which is not true: it is one size bigger than what they promise. All is fake and false. Plus they dont accept return after 30 days.
1.0,Fit bit fell off
1.0,Lasted a couple months and then fell apart. Don't waste your money or risk losing your keys trusting this polished piece of junk.
1.0,Purchased the apricot one for vacation. Absolutely does not fit. It seems like its lightweight and the gold polkadots stand out well. The fabric doesn't feel overly breathable though.
1.0,This did not look like the photo when arrived. My girlfriend said it looked like something that my Grandmother would wear. 😕
1.0,don't buy it its junk.
1.0,Flimsy made. Cheap material
1.0,"Do NOT order! Dress fits fine. However as seen in picture that I attached I did NOT get the dress I ordered. It is completely different. I guess they got the color right, but the picture they advertise is not what you get. Do not waste your time!"
1.0,I returned this shirt. The color was nice but the shirt was too long. And the letters looked cheap with the way they were above the shirt. I felt they would come off or peel.
1.0,"what is going on with this shirt? is it a belly shirt? the girl in the picture isnt showing her abs.  the arms and chest fit great, the back was perfect, the front was HIGH CUT! what the heck?"
1.0,fake. Disappointed
1.0,Doesn’t glow in the dark at all
1.0,Super cheaply made and made for a child’s neck.
1.0,It looks like maybe once upon a time it could have looked that way but was melted down to look like a blob of a mess it doesn't hardly cost anything but save that little bit of money.
1.0,Poorly made product! Not at all like advertised
1.0,Not as described or pictured.
1.0,"fabric issue, rips easilyl not durable"
1.0,"Did not fit at all. Too small around the ribs, the straps are WAY too long, the top falls down showing everything. Overall pretty cheap material. Waiting on my return information."
1.0,bad material and cut
1.0,Item is smaller than typical
1.0,Was happy I was getting a great deal but that's all I got. I never got the package in the mail. I did apply for a refund and never heard back however if they are gonna run a promotion they should have better tracking on their packages too
1.0,"If I could give them zero stars I would, not worth the money. Garbage."
1.0,These leggings came with a hole already in them! They had markings on them. 😲 Photo of light side is the leggings flipped inside out.😦
1.0,"This has to be the biggest scam on Amazon.  The mask is 3d printed on a piece of fabric,the eye holes don't match the picture, and the fabric for the jumpsuit is paper thin. My wife poke a hole in it just by pulling up the jumpsuit. DO NOT BUY THIS..."
1.0,"This is not for anyone with over a 20&#34; waist line !  I had to cut it and add an insert to make it fit, I&#34;m a size 12.  The bottom hem was coming undone before I even put it on, so I had to turn up and hem the bottom.  I've worn it once and already the stitches holding the wires in place are coming apart. I guess for the 18.00 I got a one time use garment."
1.0,Only lasted a week or two..  waste of money
1.0,You have to be an extra small for this dress to work.
1.0,"The &#34;gold tone&#34; wore off quickly. The ring itself is nice, and I know I probably got what I paid for. I was just disappointed at how quickly the color changed."
1.0,"Pretty sure I was shipped a used Pavlok 2. so first impression is not very good. I was really looking forward to getting it to try it. It was NOT shipped with any directions. Just the “how to guide” which tells you nothing about how to use it, tried looking on their website to find instructions which was a fail. Finally found a YouTube video on how to operate it. Was a very frustrating experience! It was shipped with a dead battery so it’s charging now. I guess I will update this review later… so far less than impressed! UPDATE: spent an hour on chat with their customer service. Horrible customer service and experience. I don’t care how good the product is, I am returning it!"
1.0,And the material is cheaply made.
1.0,Cheaply made returned it as soon as it arrived
1.0,I paid 34 $ and only got the top it says top n bottom
1.0,Material is not good. The price is not good for the material.  This should sell in the dollar store.
1.0,These leggings are not full length.. I'm only 5'6 and they come to my knees... Hate them!
1.0,"Bought similar for my football team. I love them. They are a little small but totally adorable. I purchased this product, but never received it. It was for a gift and that didn’t work out great. So I can’t really rave about  this product the same because I never got it"
1.0,The buttons did not fit into the closures. You definitely get what you pay for.. a dress that takes 5 weeks to arrive and unwearable. Would not recommend
1.0,"They were just a tad small. I really liked that they weren’t push-up, and also were lacey with 3 hooks. Most of the time the 3 hook bras are frumpy. They’re not excellent, they’re a little cheap but great for the price. I even washed mine in the washing machine and air dried, and they held up.<br /><br />Update<br />I’ve had these for almost two months and don’t wear them that often I wore a new one the other day and the underwire was poking out under my armpit."
1.0,Do not order if you want the actual masks in the product picture. This is the second set they have sent us that is no where near the pictures items.
1.0,"Back spins around, doesn’t stay in position to match the anatomy of the front. Annoying."
1.0,This shirt is tiny. A large fit my 10 year old niece.
1.0,Loved this! But my daughter dropped her wand in the kitchen and it broke in pieces. The set is really cute just have to be extra careful I guess
1.0,"I read reviews and most said to size down so I did, I purchased a small instead of my usual medium. I had to return it because it was too tight. I personally think it is sized correctly. The other big issue I had was that it was see through, at least the white. I really don't want to wear a tee underneath my tops to conceal my undergarments. I had no issues with the buttons, they were cute. If the top had been a medium I most likely would have kept it even with the other issue."
1.0,"I got the 4 pack and so far 3 have broken multiple times. We tried wearing them a little loose and a just snugly. I put three to feather and wrapped them around my ankle and that lasted 2 days before breaking. The others have lasted no more than 3 days.<br />We are very disappointed and don’t know if they could make a difference in our general health because they won’t stay on.<br />Additional info…the silver one turned my husband’s wrist green before it broke. I took out the compromised link, cleaned it up, wire it for 2 days and then noticed a black ring developing on my arm where it slid up to over night."
1.0,Very uncomfortable dress
1.0,"This bracelet has only one thing going for it and that is that a true &#34;Directioner&#34; will probably like it no matter how badly made it is just because of the pictures.  This bracelet is little more than puffy stickers haphazardly placed on cheap tiles.  Most of the stickers on the bracelet I received are VERY crooked making the bracelet not even appear half as nice as the one pictured.  This bracelet for what you get is grossly overpriced at $15 and would be more reasonable at maybe $2, but I will give it to my niece for Christmas anyway, Only now I am going to have to get something else much nicer to go with her gifts because this item is just so junky.  If you want a better bracelet I would recommend one of the jelly bracelets because this one is most likely going to break shortly after my niece receives it and the jelly bracelets are far more sturdy and less costly."
1.0,There is a rubber/petroleum smell to the brush. I can't use it due to the fear I have of the smell transferring to my clean hair.
1.0,It was not a roll over waist as in photo.  It is an elastic waist and very small. I cannot wear it
1.0,"Arms are way too small.  Not in proportion to rest of shirt.  In order to have arms fit you would need to buy two sizes larger.  Just is not proportined well.  Also longer than picture.  Could be short mini-dress.  Not tunic length.  Material seems okay, but not as good as picture shows.  Would not recommmend going by size chart.  It is cut small and again arms way too small.  Will be returning and will not buy again."
1.0,"Zero stars,looked like a pair of scrubs that would fit a 5 year old and it was a 4xl. Looks nothing like the picture. Awful,awful,awful!!!!"
1.0,"Quality not near what I expected for the price, the fit was to large as well, still waiting on a refund to my card as well."
1.0,"I should have looked into the reviews.  My son loves the pajamas, but like many others that purchased this product they have a zipper problem.  It keeps separating and now it doesn't zip at all.  Not what i expected for the price."
1.0,Not for men?  Was supposed to be for women and was supposed to have pockets.  Not sure where the description comes from.  Anyway - no pockets - I am disappointed.
1.0,"THE ITEM SENT IS A CHEAP, CRUDELY MADE IMITATION OF THE ONE SENT!<br /><br />NOT WORTH THE PRICE!"
1.0,"Bands do not fit the gear fit 2, despite being advertised as so."
1.0,Porque ponen 50 y es mentira solo mandan 10 esto es fraude
1.0,Garbage they wouldn't even fit on my 5 year old grandchild.😠
1.0,NOT GENUINE LEATHER.  It went back.
1.0,"R. Vivimos does not make clothes for American women, period! The tag says XL, US 16/18... that's a load of crap! It is more like a US size 8, maybe a ten. I've never gotten a piece from this company that has fit so it's the last one I'll ever order. Amazon should stop allowing them to sell on their website. I'm returning it immediately!"
1.0,The dress doesn’t look anything like the photo it looks like a shirt
1.0,didn't  like the material
1.0,"Waiting for Summer to wear.  Not sending back, not worth hassle.  Fits ok"
1.0,Awful synthetic unbreathable material
1.0,Terrible leaked and now my phones ruined. Thought it was gonna work.  Dipped it in to test it slight leak now no volume or speakers 🤬
1.0,"I bought this as a gift for my niece and have kept it in the ring box they sent. I opened it today to prep it for my niece's birthday and it is tarnished. What a terrible buy, now I have to go get my niece a new ring. Sadly, I am also past a refund date since I bought it so far in advance of her birthday.<br /><br />Save your money, Don't buy from here."
1.0,Long lasting heat my ass. I purchased this in hopes of what it was said to do. Keep me warm. Even on the lowest setting it only last maybe 4 hours. When it is on the heat does not really work. I had much higher hopes for this. Now here I am a month later and it doesn’t work at all. Battery is fully charged and when I plug it in to the sweatshirt it shows it’s dead and doesn’t work. I’m sad to say I’ll be sending it back.
1.0,I went hiking a couple of times with these pants. I tried them once for climbing and evening fell apart with them. The drawstring broke and the knee stitching came apart.
1.0,I hate it!!! The color and fit was not what I expected! I wasted my money for I've never worn it! Never again!
1.0,"Well I don’t know how they screwed this order up since it says camouflage on the description, but they ended up sending me a solid black hat."
1.0,"Fits horrible, itchy material, can't return it... Don't waste your hard earned money on it."
1.0,terrible 😞 wobbly and hair fall out super easy save your money
1.0,Fell apart first day I used it
1.0,Do not buy!!!! Cheap garbage.  This item looks like it was made in a sweat shop!
1.0,"flimsy, cheap"
1.0,Don't purchase unless you don't care about sizing
1.0,"Really hated these sunglasses.. there's no two ways about it. They are super bulky, cheap looking, and despite that I still intended to keep them as a spare for the car. Well the frames are so darn tight they might as well be for a middle school aged child. I cant wear them comfortably for more than 5 minutes at best. I dont recommend this product."
1.0,"Seemingly cheap made, shipped in a bag….no shape upon arrival. Trying to reshape but so far no luck. I’ll keep trying."
1.0,"These gloves were supposed to be black, they are pale purple. They are supposed to be real suede/leather, THEY ARE NOT. They are fabric. Flimsy fabric at that. I don't even have time now to return/reorder, I am flying out in two days. Beware of this company."
1.0,Do not buy it. Very bad quality and expansive.
1.0,"Ordered XXL got a small, don't buy"
1.0,Very cheap made items and the photo is misleading. The logo is not stitched it’s like a silk screen or iron on so I’m very disappointed with the product. Amazon should be a little better at full disclosure
1.0,Seam on bottom of sock????
1.0,These gloves are huge and I don’t even know a women with hands big enough to give them to.
1.0,what arrived in the mail is not at ALL what the picture looks like.  This is the most terrible scam!  What arrived in the mail is cheap and looks like it was made by a child out of construction paper.  the toe does not flex so it can look like in the picture and the buckle is painted on like a weird cartoon.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,I has no glitter what so ever ! None at all . This is the only reason I ordered it.<br />It is thick and not breathable . This is false advertising . Says Glitter . NO GLITTER !!!!<br />Do not in any way recommend this !
1.0,Wore these for my wedding and they broke as soon as I stepped in the grass and then got stuck on my heels. Waste of money.
1.0,I don't have the words to describe how cheap this fabric feels. The print is nowhere near as bright as the pictures. There were holes in the pockets. It was absolute Chinese garbage.
1.0,Cheap icky nylon or some other type of fabric. If you live in a hot place forget it. You don't need your many sweaty and miserable in these.
1.0,"Color was great, sizing was way off."
1.0,Fell apart after 1 wear around the house. Seams coming loose.
1.0,"Very very cropped, and very thin. Size up at least"
1.0,Too cheap quality.totally waste of money.one of the ear ring was not closing.
1.0,"This isn't your everyday pendant. It's nice but exceptionally large. The eye that's described as pink sapphire is not pink, it's clear. You also need a very strong chain for this pendant. No chain is included."
1.0,Scratch extremely easy barley had a month and look worse then the prism ones that i had for over a year would not recommend these lenses
1.0,"Don't waste your money, even if you're only buying it for fun like I did (for Halloween).  It didn't work despite how carefully I followed the instructions, repeatedly.  The grill was an integral part of my costume and I was unable to use it.  They were also advertised to fit any set of teeth, even if they were crooked.  Not true at all.  Totally bummed."
1.0,"Purchased a large (which is my size on all my shirts) Woodstock Tie Dye Graphic T-Shirt from Prestige Apparel and paid for the item plus shipping. When it arrived, the shirt didn't fit... it was much too tight. I contacted the seller a few times for a paid return shipping label for an exchange to an XL or refund and was told I was responsible for returning it myself. If I had know this before purchasing, I would not have bought the item. As expected, UPS wanted more than the cost of the shirt. USPS was also expensive. I tried again to contact Amazon and the seller. I'll wait a few more days to get a response If unable to get any satisfaction, I will throw the shirt away since it is of no use. BUYERS BEWARE. MERCHANDISE IS OF POOR QUALITY AND RUNS SMALL. If I would be able to have given the seller no stars, I would have."
1.0,too small for my 4 yr old
1.0,"Unless your show has alot of coverage, these will show."
1.0,Tarnished after 2 weeks in the box
1.0,I ordered a medium and it fits more like an x small so now I am going to try an x large.
1.0,I dislike tge material it's made out of. It's shiny and cheap looking.
1.0,Too small need a bigger size
1.0,Slip away very easy.
1.0,"This was waaaay too small. Disappointing because the size chart was not accurate at all. However, the quality of the costume was very good! I wish I could have worn it."
1.0,These are awful!  Do not buy!  Clasps would not open in some. Two broke as soon as put on. Stay away from this product!!
1.0,I ordered this in an X-Large because I like my pants to be super big on me and I was very displeased when my pants came in the mail and were more similar to a size M. I will absolutely be returning this product. The color is great but the size is so far from accurate.
1.0,"Watch is gorgeous, you can customize it to the circumference of your wrist which is a plus however, the watch does NOT WORK!! no battery life whatsoever when it arrived."
1.0,"I went up a size per their sizing chart. I got the medium and it is HUGE! It looks like an xlarge on me and it looks NOTHING like the pictures! Super disappointed since I was really looking forward to wearing it. It looks so pretty in the pics, but in person it looks like the cheapest thing ever! I wish I could return it."
1.0,didnt quite fit how i was expecting it too!
1.0,"I hate bait and switch so this one is going back too! 😒 Listing said three, only got one! Not cool."
1.0,Only got to used for one week and it broke. Very disappointed.
1.0,Cheap.  Cheap.  Not the quality I expected.
1.0,I wire it about 5 times and it is falling apart. Not leather.
1.0,I’ve had magnet earring before but these are not good and don’t stay. DO NOT BUY!!
1.0,It's cool looking but didn't fit right and just wasn't what I thought it would be.
1.0,Ordered a 5X and it was the size of a medium. Buyers beware!
1.0,I purchased four hook extender for my four hook bras but the hooks don't line up so they are useless.
1.0,"So granted I understand how harsh living near the ocean is but I bought this item two weeks ago and have not subjected it to direct salt water yet the eye knife is completely rusted and the flint rod is so tight that it will no longer slide on the paracord. Depending upon where you live I would suggest thinking about how this item would look when you need to use it, or if you could use it legitimately."
1.0,Shoes look just like the photo and appeared to be great quality until I tried them on.  I wear a size 9 & ordered a 9.5 but the shoes were extremely tight in the toe area.  Coach sneakers are usually very comfortable  but not these...I returned them.
1.0,It looked nice but was not snapping closed like an original band. Earlier today it became undone in the water and I lost my watch.
1.0,"Broke the second day. I won't tell anyone not to purchase, I am just giving my experience with the earrings."
1.0,Not a good buy. Too short and make sure to buy 2 size bigger
1.0,"From the photo, this looks like a small version of the actual army public affairs branch pin. What I received was a cheap, plastic pin that looks nothing like what was pictured and has writing on it."
1.0,Does not look much like the picture. Had to return. Waist of my time.
1.0,Way to small they all got lost the feel out
1.0,You cannot use this as a mask I expect a refund also it came broken
1.0,"The design on the inside is pretty and all, but it’s really finicky and almost impossible to get it open in windy conditions. The release button is on the part you push up, so I have to be really careful to not touch it when opening it otherwise it will not lock in place."
1.0,It’s very pretty!!! But one side of the band was not able to be put on the watch tried so many times I had to return it
1.0,"What did I like most? The color. Sadly, I was quite disappointed with the quality... or lack there of. It's fricken plastic! The exterior is supposed to be &#34;leather&#34;...I'm not even sure that's accurate. The removable checkbook wasn't removable. Mostly I'm disappointed in myself for not returning it, since it truly &#34;wasn't as described&#34;. I've ripped out the &#34;removable checkbook cover&#34; and therefore I'm stuck with it. 😌"
1.0,"Very cute picture shown online, but actual product recieved is not so cute. I got a pair of plush cheap looking piglet slippers. Material and craftsmanship is very bad. Definitely not worth what I paid."
1.0,"are you kidding me? this product came already broken. awesome. sure it was cheap, but it does not by any means i should receive a defective product. don't even waste your time, go to target and get one thatll last."
1.0,"I wear a women's small to medium top/shirt. I read the reviews and decided I better order a larger size. I ordered the XL, and when I tried it on, it fit like a small shirt. The length came to my waist. I think this particular cover up should be reconsidered unless you are a petite woman with a short torso"
1.0,Reminded me of something that would be included in a children's toy set.
1.0,"I ordered this dress last year and I love it so much but to keep wearing it, i ordered a larger size, SAME DRESS. But what came in the mail was very much NOT the same dress. Very very disappointed. Quality is soooo cheap, the lace is super thin and in a shade of GREEN! Dont buy!<br />DRESS ON RIGHT: the one I bought last year<br />DRESS ON LEFT: what sadly came in my mail today"
1.0,Me aparece k se entregó el 15 de junio y no me ha llegado nada
1.0,Not wearable!
1.0,First wash Hand wash cycle cold on machine lined dried all 4 I bought are a mess those little fuzzy balls everywhere
1.0,The product was very small and thin. Not the quality I expected for the price. I returned the item.
1.0,Extremely small said 14mm but was more like 5mm they did not even fit my 7 year old
1.0,Breaks right away.  Poor quality
1.0,These are unsafe… metal strip in the mask have  sharp edges like a needle. My son poked himself and was bleeding. These used to have metal strips that were wide enough like a rectangle over the bridge of the nose and the metal edges were safe. I guess they are cutting back on metal material and making them too narrow is extremely dangerous for kids
1.0,Item was really short and small fitting.  I ordered a 7 but git like a 4t.
1.0,It didn't fix AT ALL.
1.0,Very cheap. They had holes in them before receiving/ trying on
1.0,Very cheaply made so we returned it.
1.0,"expected a sweater.  got a long sleeve tshirt with an open back.  unflattering cut, longer at the hips"
1.0,"We were heading to Mardi Gras, and this was perfect. Unfortunately, it’s not as pictured, or described. Please update to note ONE mask included. There were waaaay cheaper mask prices, exactly same product and It’s my fault for assuming for the $23 I paid, I would have received more!! Too much for this. I missed cut off date for returns."
1.0,"Only worked for 2 days, then started randomly stopping...<br /><br />Well made, looks nice, nice leather strap, BUT does not work."
1.0,Love the look but we've bought two sets of these now and one in each set has broken.
1.0,"Very small, very thin"
1.0,These are so cute but the posts are so short that you cannot wear them. Once in your ear there is not enough room to screw the backs on
1.0,Charm tarnished  after just a couple of days
1.0,Cheaply made with a flaw right in the front on seamline!
1.0,Not flattering to me
1.0,I ordered large so as to be able to layer . The garment was long enough but much too snug to layer it over another layer.<br />I gave it to another family member.
1.0,Liked the size but lettering was grey not white as advertised one*
1.0,"I initially ordered this blouse in a large & without first reading the reviews. Read reviews later & thought ""uh-oh."" But after receiving it, I was happily impressed. The vibrancy of the print which first caught my eye was better in person. It draped well, was well constructed and I like the quality of the material, even though it's polyester. Living in TX's hot humid weather, I'm always on the hunt for natural fiber material, but decided I would wear this blouse during our cool/cold months. The downer was the sleeves were too long (I'm usually S/M on top). Because I liked this blouse so much, I decided to re-order in size M. Could hardly wait to receive it. When I did, I was so disappointed and the reviews now made perfect sense. The re-ordered blouse was not a good version of the first blouse. The print was less vibrant, the quality of the material was not the same, nor was the construction. The facing around the neckline poked out & one sleeve was longer than the other. Needless to say, I returned it. From my experience, there seems to be two versions of this blouse. I do not recommend ordering, but if you do, I suggest keeping this in mind."
1.0,it came in a size i did not order
1.0,2 of these charms broke about an hour after my 15 yr. old granddaughter put them on her bracelet.  She was just sitting around at our Christmas dinner.  It was the one in the middle the two pieces came apart & the bottom left the center silver piece fell out.
1.0,Cheap wound up in trash
1.0,They weren't symmetrical and they don't stay adjusted properly in the ear. Pretty much just a piece of shaped wire and not actual earrings. The additional rubber backs don't even fit
1.0,Ordered these for my husband.  He’s normally a 36x32 so we got the XL.  They were way too big.  I would size down.  They also seem cheaply made.
1.0,Its just ugly the fit is horrible and the quality is poor as well save tour money
1.0,cut two sizes to small
1.0,"Plastic belt. Don't buy this product. It's not leather, it's just plastic"
1.0,Very cheap quality but it look good in hands but for the quality zero star
1.0,Much bigger than I thought  they would be and extremely translucent
1.0,"I have really sensitive skin and this top really hurt in the armpit areas - gave me a bad rash.  (Not because I did not wash it, but because the fabric was tight / thick in the armpits and would constantly rub)<br /><br />Otherwise, it looked and fit perfect. Just wish it was more comfortable around the armpit area"
1.0,After 2 hours in shoes I feel my feet sweating and that's not even a problem with any of my other socks
1.0,The clip scratches the lenses of my glasses. But I like the sun protection these sunglasses provide inside the car.
1.0,I checked reviews I did my appropriate measurements as a matter fact all my other pants came out perfect these ones came in like they were for a 12-year-old. I had to return them. I don’t know if somebody messed up my measurements but it was a disappointing purchase
1.0,"Not happy with these at all. Wore them one time and the cheap coating came right off and marked my skin. Now I can’t return them, so I’m stuck with my purchase. I’m very disappointed and will not buy again. Buyer beware."
1.0,The print of the material is upside down. It’s beautiful but made this apron incorrectly.
1.0,"I liked the looks of them, but when in my foot, I slip to the side. So not so good. I would return them if I saved the box."
1.0,Came broken and can’t return save your money.  Poor quality!
1.0,Runs about 2 sizes smaller. Really nice top but the top does not fit me. I ordered 3X and it’s more of a Xl. I can’t order up since the top I ordered is the largest size they have. But the material and top are nice. Just doesn’t fit me :(
1.0,"These state one size fits all which is not correct, also I purchased the grey sock with pink lettering and it is so faint in color you can not even read what it says.  Unlike what the picture shows"
1.0,This bag came missing 1 of the poms! totally disappointed! What a joke!
1.0,The inside of the bag has a hole
1.0,Strap broke one week after purchase.  The rocks are a bit too large for me to comfortably wear and I'm a big guy
1.0,Wore for a single snowy/rainy day and the gloves acted like a sponge.  Soaked up water quickly and dried very slowly.  Wet gloves are cold and worse than no gloves.
1.0,"Yes, the sizing is weird, as many reviewers have noted, but the material is also bizarre. It's some sort of poly material, but it has the texture of a thick paper towel and looks about as bad. It is stiff and wrinkly. The washing instructions say you can't put it in the dryer and I can totally imagine these dissolving to shreds if you tried. But maybe I'm wrong. Apparently, they are machine washable. For the price, they could be worth it if you just need them occasionally, but we live in New England and my kids love to play in the rain, so we need rain gear that is durable and easily washable. I am sticking with the more expensive LL Bean rain gear that is both breathable, durable, and looks good."
1.0,Cheap it broke in a week.
1.0,"Unfortunately it broke before I wore it.  Took it out of the package.  Put it on the dresser.  Picked it up and a very small u-shaped clip fell off.  Even if I am able to &#34;clip&#34; the two pieces together, it may come apart again unless I can bend the tiny clip.  Pretty, inexpensive, and not well-made---I guess you could say it meets what should have been expected.  Paid $8.99 for it. Oh! well!"
1.0,"If you’ve ever picked up a barbell, don’t bother. This was much too small through shoulders and too large through the torso. And i sized up because I know I have broad shoulders/lats. Waste of time."
1.0,So ugly. They go all the way up your ear with a clip on top. Not at all what I was expecting.
1.0,absolutely so awful I threw it away  worse craftsman ship
1.0,very disappointed in this produt
1.0,The zipper does not work well. The sleeves are too short. Seams are not tightly sewn. Want to return yet I am a few days past the date when I can do so.  I regard this jacket as defective. I would like to return.
1.0,"Order 3xl, can fit my 12 year old.  More like a small to medium.  Horrible!"
1.0,First time I wore a necklace with one of these it fell off three times before I got home.  Returned for refund
1.0,It doesn’t fit how it looks on the picture UNLESS you are built like the model ! It runs small & it’s short in the back .
1.0,"Developed random tears in the fabric after one wearing.  Looked great for a few hours, though."
1.0,not what the picture looks like. Stitching wasn't right.
1.0,They were bent when I opened the box.
1.0,The magnets are too small will stay on ear scam scam
1.0,To wide and to short I’ll shaped
1.0,"Not a good buy at all. Falls off every 5 seconds. Do not buy, very big.. Not practical"
1.0,my dress was sent inside out.. smelling like perfume... obviously worn..
1.0,Huge and the shape and color reminded me clown clothes.
1.0,"Altho the pattern was pretty, the fabric felt very polyester and did not breathe at all. Wearing it for just a few minutes made me hot and sticky. The dress did go down to the floor, but the pictured natural waist became an Empire, hitting many inches too high. The bodice was too tight."
1.0,"Ordered a medium, as Amazon said it would ""fit me best"" and the reviews said similar ""true to fit"" statements. I normally wear a medium or a large. This fit more like a XXL, came down almost to my knees, the shoulder seams sat midway down my biceps, the sleeves hung about 11"" past my fingertips. The fabric was not very nice, cheap acrylic or rayon plastic material and was unevenly stretched out in spots. This is the second item I've both purchased and returned from this brand. I will never buy Coofandy brand again, and I urge anyone browsing their products to go with a different brand."
1.0,"Material was very off, very high and tight in crotch area but sagged as well.. not well made at all!"
1.0,No idea where the glowing reviews come from. They don’t compare to the older versions. The material is not the same. It’s a cheap dense nylon that makes it hard to breath. I will never buy these again.
1.0,"If I could I would have given this item a zero, its a piece of trash and a waste  of money would not recommend for any type of use.  Don't buy."
1.0,I tested this ring for silver and it is not silver.<br />I like the design.  Ring was the right size but there is fake turquoise in the middle.<br />I returned it because I was expecting a ring that was gold plating over silver.<br />It is dangerous to wear rings where the metal content is unknown so I cannot recommend this ring!<br /><br />If this review helped you make an informed purchase please mark it as helpful
1.0,"Please make sure to order at least 1-2 sizes up. My girl is generally petite, so I ordered a 7/8 thinking she could grow into it. It was too small. She is six and normally wears a 6."
1.0,Cheap. Of course you get what you pay for. Will not buy again. Fell apart the first day.
1.0,"I loved this scarf when I first started wearing it...soft, nice color, etc. Within a few hours it began pilling, shedding and left a layer of fuzz on the top I was wearing. ugh! So dissapointed!"
1.0,"I would not recommend this shirt its entirely too small, I ordered a large & my 12 year old couldnt even fit this shirt...im not sure what sizing they are doing but its wayyyyyyyy off"
1.0,"Bought this wristband because it looked stylish. 1st band wouldn’t connect with watch, 2nd wristband came apart after about two hours. Seems to be a flaw with connection to watch. Sent both back- very disappointed."
1.0,This product is made with poor quality material. It is too big and it does not fit like the picture. More like a big sheet.
1.0,There’s so many things wrong with this order!! I was looking  forward to receiving this shirt and not only I received the wrong color but the shirt has a hole in it!! Im so disappointed!! I ordered a navy blue and received a royal blue. I ordered a 2XL / Im 5’7” / 210 lbs /size 16-17 and instead of looking like a tunic it looks like a dress but not long enough to wear with nothing underneath. Also the fabric is too thin to even attempt it. Nope!! Returning this “thing”
1.0,Horrible quality. It’s also bright orange and a dingy cream color. Awful. Also runs really big.
1.0,It did not fit my watch. It was the wrong band
1.0,"I put this shirt on, placed my iPhone into the front pocket and the corner of the pocket was detached, upon removing my phone from my pocket, the whole top of the pocket came unstitched. I’m sure I could fix it easily but, I don’t purchase clothing to have to work On them typically. I do not recommend."
1.0,Really cheap material and bad fit. Returned item. I blame myself for thinking $5item would be better.
1.0,Took forever to arrive. Not worth $20. Very cheap feel.
1.0,Did not stay on my ear.
1.0,"I purchased this watch for my wife for Mothers Day. She loved it until the band broke, the first day wearing it. I contacted Burei to get the band replaced. They were quick to respond to my first email asking for more information. Then nothing. I send an additional email to see what was going on, and still nothing. I do wonder if they are dragging their feet on purpose. After all, they don’t cover watchbands after 30 days. So I RMA’ed the watch. I can’t say if the watch its self is any good. But the band that they shipped with it is crap. And Burei needs to learn how to communicate with their customers."
1.0,I lost mine within the first week because the backs are too loose and easily fell off.
1.0,I`ve had many flip flops in my 72 years but never had a pair as bad as these. If you`re into torture these are for you.
1.0,Broke the moment I put it on
1.0,It s just ok. Not as pretty as picture
1.0,Fit too small. Normally I’m a medium and it fit too small. I returned the item as the quality and soft fabric weren’t there.
1.0,They are at least 2mm smaller than my current 00g plugs.<br />Complete waste of time and money.
1.0,Ordered the largest size available and it fits my sister who is a size 12.
1.0,"I sent custom measurements to have this dress fit me perfectly. NOTHING fit. It was too large and too long.<br />The beading is seen on with one continuous thread, some of which were 8 inches or more in length. I caught one of these threads in my FINGERNAIL and it ripped out of the dress sending a cascade of beads EVERYWHERE.<br />This dress needed so many alterations in order for it to fit I would have needed to remake the entire dress.<br />Do not order from these people. I did with high hopes after reading others reviews about how the item fit like &#34;a glove&#34;.<br />This item fit like a circus tent. I'm thoroughly pissed that I just wasted money for a dress that I can use as a pool cover."
1.0,Total crap !!! The logo came off after first washing.
1.0,scratched immediately. worthless
1.0,"Material is nice but the ""lace"" ran very tight on the sleeve. Had to return"
1.0,These shrunk up big time
1.0,Dress ran much smaller than stated. I ordered 8/9 years and what I received was more like 5/6. Very disappointed.
1.0,"It's unusual in style which is why I added it to my small collection, but it's developed moisture under the glass.  I have five other watches and not one of them has this problem, so I suspect the case wasn't properly sealed."
1.0,So I loved these the second I opened them. They got great and looked so good on (to me at least lol). I wore them on a date and probably about 30 min in they just would not stay up. I would take two steps and they would fall right down. Not a good look and so embarrassing. I had to throw them out when I got him because I knew they were a lost cause. Save your money ladies.
1.0,"I ended up paying almost $30 for these and they barely lasted a month.. and I only wear the. Indoors. The only reason I bought them in the first place was for the arch support but there is literally NONE. I decided to keep them because I thought they looked cute but I wish I would have just returned them. They stretched out almost immediately to the point to wear I have to drag my feet to keep them on. The fuzz has gotten all nasty and it’s not soft anymore. They are pretty much garbage. I was trying to avoid paying 100 for nice arch support slippers but I don’t think it’s worth it, at least not for these. Wish I would have just got the ones I really wanted the first time. Oh well. Like I said don’t bother"
1.0,I thought this was the perfect watch.  I had a similar pocket watch for a few years but it finally stopped working.  I bought this one believing it was like the other one but it was so disappointing!  It's tiny and feels like a toy watch.  I bought it to hang from my belt loop but I had a difficult time putting it through the belt loop.  It may work well for a child but definitely not for an adult.
1.0,After wearing two of the four.. all lost their small screw top balls. I wore the same belly bar for years and never had this problem.  Lesson learned.. you get what you pay for.. to good to be true..don’t waste your money.
1.0,I ordered this in the XL and it looked like it would fit my 11 year old niece!!<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!!!!
1.0,"The design was nice as shown on picture but it's definitely a 1 piece costume and way too small. You could see the whole molded shape of my manly parts and the event I purchased it for was a kid and family friendly event so not what I want to advertise. The hat was damaged beyond salvaging and I did not look at all like a mariachi. I looked like an old lady picking strawberries in a farm especially with that horrible hat. Didn't even get my money back the way I paid for it. Got my money back via Amazon gift card. I had to make a costume on the spot with one of my suits instead of wearing this or not only would I have been laughed at, 1 bad squat and everyone would see the whole show. Definitely planning my costume better for next year and it won't be this."
1.0,Not only are the MUCH smaller than described there are NOT even heart shaped.  VERY disappointed. Returning...
1.0,Fits right but absolute garbage. i wear for about a month and the seems are coming apart  Waste of money even though it cheap.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THESE! They barely made it passed my ankle, let alone my knee!"
1.0,"Weird fabric!  Stretchy and thin, like little girl pajamas."
1.0,Does not look anything like the picture ! Fabric awful ! Sent it back !
1.0,"This is cheap material, the tail looks like it’s flat in the photos to make swimming like a mermaid easy. No. It’s all cloth and does not fit like the photo. Honestly it’s pretty unsafe….basically your child will be swimming with her legs together with not tail to help propel her. Drowning hazard."
1.0,It’s not fair that I can’t get my money back for shoes I can’t wear.
1.0,they are too big for a woman's hand!
1.0,Awful! The amethyst fell out of the prong as I unscrewed it!  Never had a chance to even see how it looked!
1.0,"Very cute watch - loved the bright blue band and adorable black cat. Unfortunately, the band broke away from the watch the first time I wore it, so I returned it. Cute, but very low quality. Probably to be expected for the low price."
1.0,"It broken within the first 2 weeks of wear!! However, it did give me a warning that it wasn’t going to last when the elastic band started fraying IMMEDIATELY!!!"
1.0,Material isn’t thick enough and it was too big.
1.0,Very thin almost sheer so it is see through.
1.0,So small they're almost unusable for me. The cases are nice and the mag strength seemed correct.
1.0,"Well, you get what you pay for. Save your money on this cheapo. Not worth it. The fake stones fell out day one. Not even worth my time trying to return it. Very very low quality and not worth it. Have a great day. Metallica Rules!"
1.0,bought 2 of these for my boat keys.  BOTH of them snapped open the first day i had them. one was in my pocket and the other was when carrying the keys so i had to go look for the key that fell off.  total waste of money.
1.0,"I was hopeful when I purchased this item that it would work with size DD. It definitely does not. The cups are not big enough and even with the help of two friends, I couldn’t manage to get it on correctly. Id say skip this option and use tape instead."
1.0,This shirt ripped at the sleeves seem after two washings. I will not purchase from this vendor again
1.0,Very bad quality do not get this item
1.0,uncomfortable to wear on top of the other glasses
1.0,"The printing seemed it was lacking something.  What was supposed to look like Christmas lights were white stars which didn't show up well on a white shirt. I returned and bought a similar shirt from a different company,  it had colored bulb shapes were this one had white stars"
1.0,"I wanted this band because it is a close match to my Nighthawk band. But the clips do not lock the tracker in, I can slide them off without touching the clips. And the clasp keeps un latching."
1.0,"The size runs extremely small and the fabric was cheaper than expected. I would have exchanged it for a larger size, but I was told it was too late to exchange it."
1.0,"Nice, but not enough room for the girls."
1.0,It is not right and therefore no compression
1.0,"I got this bag specifically because it shows a bag that is 27.55"" x 7 ' wide but my 26"" by 3"" dive fins don't fit in this bag.  So sadly, I had to return it."
1.0,Not happy with the shoe shapers at all. For high heels you would have to wear a size 20 to have them fit. Lots of little pieces with no<br />Instructions at all as to what to do with them. Bad purchase
1.0,Never received them but they look really cute
1.0,I bought these underwear a month ago and they are already frayed. They have some holes in them too.
1.0,"The size was so off it was comical. I can only imagine how small a small is, it would probably fit a 3 year old."
1.0,"I bought this as a gift and I am extremely disappointed in the quality of the print. It’s blotchy, discolored in several spots, and already peeling off in a few places upon arrival. There is no way in good conscience I can gift this to anyone.<br /><br />The overall bag is rather cheap in quality as well. If the print was solid, it would have made up for it, but it failed in both areas, so there’s nothing redeeming to say about it.<br /><br />TL;DR Don’t waste your money on such a low quality product with non existent QC."
1.0,Only works for like 30 seconds and then stops
1.0,"The fit in this was perfect, however the material is dreadful. It’s shiny. My husband thought it was pajamas in the bag."
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THESE! I am a fool for not having read these reviews before I purchased:( They look beautiful in the picture but not so in reality. Mine were bent so out of shape I can't even close or wear them. They are also much tinier than the picture illustrates. Just because something costs a couple of bucks, doesn't mean you should &#34;steal&#34; a couple of bucks from every person that ordered these thinking they were getting something cute. I wanted them just to have a little something for everyday wear but sorely disappointed. What a waste!"
1.0,The magnet and astronaut both fell off in a short period of time
1.0,The small white ring that holds it together broke while I was putting it on :(
1.0,"This shrunk to about 80% of the original size! So about a half to a full size of shrinkage. If you go for this make sure to get a size up.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />Wife loves it! It's a simple single piece of nylon fabric, very soft and light. Not sure it's worth the $30.<br />In terms of sizing, a medium fits perfectly for her body/chest. For reference she is 5'3"" and wears a 34C.<br />I went through many of the previous reviews and people's reports on the sizing are all over the place. These reviews are older and I'm guessing the product may have a changed a bit since then."
1.0,"Day one of wearing it, the seam ripped. It's happened with each mask. After a few hours of wearing it starts ripping. Not worth the price"
1.0,"I would have given this 5 stars, but the color was not at all what I expected. It says white... but it’s definitely a creamy beige with almost a pinkish tint. The tag color said something along the lines of rose. I wanted Navy, but the navy took way too long to ship. Basically I feel like I settled by ordering white, and then didn’t even get the color I settled for. Otherwise, the robe is great. I am 5’5 and 170 lbs. It fits me perfectly... plenty of room to wrap around and some... sleeves fit to my knuckles and the length is almost touching the ground. And it is super super soft and cozy... hopefully it remains that way after washing. I’ll update this review if it doesn’t.<br /><br />Update: pieces of my robe are coming out. It’s cheaply made and already found shedding after only wearing one day."
1.0,"I put one star here because this is not what you get when you order. I ordered this and got a very unattractive watch ( just my opinion ), not the one pictured here. This looks so pretty , I ordered again thinking they may have just made a mistake? Apparently not as I received the same unattractive watch like I got the first time. And believe me or not it looked nothing like this watch. Big Bummer."
1.0,"I ordered a size 2X jacket it is marked XXXL, but is size small at best."
1.0,I held this shirt up and could see my television program through it. I am returning the item as I typically don't like my clothes to be see through
1.0,One star only because I had too! This is the worst purchase I’ve ever made on amazon. To talk about the quality of the bag would be a lie because there is NONE!  Do yourself a favor and do not by this set. It is EXTREMELY cheap and I’ve seen better quality at the dollar tree. I’m giving it to my five year old to play dress up. What a disappointment.
1.0,Did not like the fit. Should be made like real shorts. Not sure what they were going for
1.0,"I specifically ordered boxer briefs,  and they are just briefs,  normally I would send them back but package got destroyed so I'm forced to make my grandson wear them"
1.0,Decent material but these run small in my opinion.  Buy a size up
1.0,These earrings are pretty but the cuff falls off easily and then it just sticks straight out and looks dumb.
1.0,Me fue enviando una talla demasiado grande a lo que pedí
1.0,This product tarnished after 2 months of wear!!!
1.0,The older kids size runs way too small. My daughter at 4 could not wear the size 5. Way too small
1.0,"Edited to add photo: dime for scale, earring on left is defective, won't close 😔<br /><br />I received these as gift that I requested after researching for the best 24/7 sleepers. I was very excited as they seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately, the quality is not that good; while they are light, they feel flimsy and one of the earrings will not stay closed. Extremely disappointed!"
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:4b9896c46e1d85aed80e2201daf7b31]] Literally on the fence about this situation smh... I waited over 3 weeks to even open the plastic that this came in because I was out of town... I took it out of the package and put it in the closet.. I got back last weekend so I opened it up to try it on... I WAS SENT A USED SHIRT 🤦🏽‍♀️ It has lent balls all over it and some kind of stain or missing threads on the top left chest area... Fortunately it didn't smell bad.. It smells like its been washed.. My husband said it smells like perfume.. Because I thought it smelled like detergent I tried it on (I know I can hear y'all screaming lol.... I showered immediately after) It was a great fit surprisingly smh.. I'm shaking my head because had it been new this review would have been 5 stars.. It was great length and felt great... Sooo because I believe in second chances I'm sending this one back obviously, and ordering again... I will update with pictured IF I receive a NEW shirt the next time 🤞🏽🤞🏽"
1.0,"Buyer beware. Within 1 week of wearing pendant, glass fell out and then chain broke. Awful."
1.0,When I say that I read every review before buying clothes on Amazon because I've learned the hard way that clothes aren't sized accurately on here. I was sooooo beyond disappointed that even ordering several sizes up I couldn't even fit the dress over my head!! Terribly disappointed!!!! Even my sister who is way smaller than I am couldn't fit into these dresses (I ordered two colors since I fell in love with them when I saw them) DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!!!
1.0,"Trash!! Do not buy! Watch does not work. Cannot take out links or change battery without bringing it in. Very upsetting. Have it one star because I had to. Otherwise, I would’ve given it zero stars."
1.0,Looks like a much cheaper version of the picture. The material around the neck is smaller and short
1.0,Awful! Tried to clean these with peroxide before use and they became discolored and one of the stones turned yellow. Obviously so low quality. I wasn’t expecting much for the price but I wouldn’t even put these in my ears
1.0,I am very disappointed with this charm. The charm is dull and dark in color. I needed a magnifying glass to read the words DOG MOM.
1.0,Cheap POS.
1.0,The shirt isn't actually black. Not flattering at all
1.0,Wore it for 2 days and it broke
1.0,The photo shows white silver colored earrings. What I received are grey-ish colored. They won't match any of my other jewelry. They are going back.
1.0,"Es la peor orden que he recibido , no tengo tiempo para hacer devoluciones, lo regale , Nunca vuelvo a orden ropa si no conozco la marca . Gracias"
1.0,Don't waste your money. Purchased for my son to wear to school. These lasted 3 hours before the nose piece broke off. He can no longer wear them because he gets cut on his nose area.
1.0,"Loved the color and style, but shortly after using it..a week or so..the carrying shoulder strap kept falling off. I did not keep the receipt or box so I was not able to return it."
1.0,Article arrived with a hole in it
1.0,"My wife did not look like this after putting this on , was disappointed and did not use again. I was under the belief that she would become a hot blonde women. So disappointed."
1.0,"It doesn't wick away the Sweat.  First run at 22F my core was very cold, icy cold.  I took it off, my core was much warmer.  Might be ok for the office"
1.0,"Do Not purchase this item.  I am sending the one I bought back, you can not make out the symbol on the side of the charm, looks like a black blob."
1.0,Awful material. Very cheap. Returned immediately. Disappointing because the photos are so cute.
1.0,It doesn’t. Work
1.0,"Does not look anything like the picture specially the accents are dark brown, tried it once and the button holes stayed stretched! I was so excited to recieve it but then so disappointed to see it in person."
1.0,frame cracked
1.0,Did not look or fit as described but i was able to return easily.
1.0,"Super thin and light weight, but way too small for my 9 year old. Would work well for a toddler.  Unfortunately we cannot use these"
1.0,"Ordered a large, the fit is small! Very disappointed!"
1.0,The shirt was so small.Instead of an xl it looked like an xs.
1.0,The shirt that I got is NOT what is pictured. Cheaper to keep than to pay to send back.
1.0,I have just really began to ssed the bag and first one zipper broke and then the second one...  Not very happy with it...
1.0,Sad my daughter got to use it a few.
1.0,Not good quality. Seems to be more plastic than straw.
1.0,weird cut..colors are nice but I couldn't do anything with them..if you are shapely don't even try it
1.0,Poor quality. Returned
1.0,"They are wayyyyy too small, no stretch, not an adult compression sock. Maybe a kids but this is not for any grown human who is not sickly and stickly. What a let down!!!"
1.0,"I just received this pendant and was very disappointed.  I feel that the Seller misrepresented what the pendant looks like.  From the photo on Amazon, it look as though it is a medium size pendant, but is so small you can't determine what it is.  Very disappointed in the pendant and am returning the item."
1.0,The dress is beautiful. But it was extremely too big. I am definitely returning the dress. It's not worth alterations.
1.0,These did not look like the picture. They were sown together crooked so the front of the overalls is not centered to my body. The part that comes up over my shoulders to adjust is backwards as well. Overall very poor quality
1.0,"cute dress style but the two different navy colors did not  match and looked very cheap...top had a sheen and looked bad, bottom was true navy , but together not good"
1.0,Se me rompió el primer día que lo use
1.0,Into wearing the right heel separated from theboot
1.0,it would seem that an American inch is larger.
1.0,"Dress came dirty right out of the package, and poorly made. No free returns because it's from China which I did not know because my sister picked this dress out for a bridesmaids dress for everyone to wear."
1.0,The description clearly states 4 pair of earings. There's only 4 earings in the package total. And one was bent. Bummer.
1.0,"If rings are sold in different sizes WHY CAN'T bracelets be sold in sizes. The craftsmanship is excellent BUT they need to make different sizes. It is stupid to only make one size. As a result, I will return my product UNTIL this company WAKES UP AND MAKES VARIATIONS IN SIZES.  Again, EXCELLENT CRAFTSMANSHIP.  but, but, but...Size too small for females and the male version is just too damn large... COMPANY, when you have variations in sizes, you can contact me. you are losing money with only a one-size-fits-all nonsense policy."
1.0,"The picture was not what I thought it was.  I thought they were smaller, they look like clown glasses."
1.0,"I'm a size 14 and I purchased a large, I should have ordered a small.  Way too much fabric."
1.0,These were not as described.
1.0,Sizes are not consistent. I ordered an extra large - it was huge so I then ordered a large and I couldn’t get it over my hips.  I gave up!
1.0,Did not help me in stopping the snoring.
1.0,"These shoes look great. The problem is that when I put them on, they dug into the top of my foot where the criss-cross is. They looked so nice and I didn't want to accept these shoes were painful. I wore them around the house for 15 minutes and developed blisters on the top of my foot. I have really narrow feet and the overall size was fine.  This must just be a defect in how they are made, I guess. I didn't know how to answer the fit question since overall fit was perfect but top of foot they were really tight and really uncomfortable. So sad considering they look so nice."
1.0,After one wash the seam on the arm is already coming apart.
1.0,Broke after using them one time. Thankfully they were just for a Halloween costume.
1.0,The clasp broke and I lost the bracelet the 2nd day I wore it!
1.0,Runs terribly small and super thin.  Returning
1.0,FITS JUST AWEFUL!!!!  SAVE YOUR $$
1.0,Not happy with product at all. I will never wear these. It was a waste of money.
1.0,The ball just pops out and that’s the opening to insert into your hole. Septum should be off this list for sure. I guess I’ll try them for my belly button but i think the opening is still too small for that too.
1.0,After wearing this ONE time the knitting completely was smeared into fuzz.  Can not restore.
1.0,The glasses arrived bent and fit crooked. Very light and flimsy.
1.0,These were good for about the first week. I like to wear my stuff tight and they barely hold on to the shirt. I can't get in a vehicle or walk up stairs without one of them coming undone. I am so frustrated with these. I even have used tape to secure them with no luck.
1.0,"This dress is SO thin and see through! The fabric is really soft, get a big size, it shrinks in the wash."
1.0,This is not what came!  A robe was delivered
1.0,Nope!!!
1.0,Looked terrible on. Cheap quality
1.0,"Very disappointed in this item, it's the size of travel items and not worth the money."
1.0,Began to fall apart after first wash.
1.0,So small and fitted- not what I expected
1.0,Terrible quality.
1.0,"Terrible quality, ill-fitting material. They used the cheapest material that doesn't hang well on a body. The shorts were different sizes from one leg to the other and the seams were higher in the crotch area than the rest of the shorts. Really bizarre, can't believe these are allowed to be sold on Amazon. Do NOT buy."
1.0,"Completely disappointed, horrible packaging and the little stones falling apart. Thought it would at least be put together a little better."
1.0,Only received the jacket. I did not receive the pants.
1.0,It’s really cute but poorly made for sure. Check my pictures to see how the seams were falling apart already. I barely took it out of the packaging to try it on! Very cheap for a reason.
1.0,This sunglasses are lightweight well design is plastic but a nice quality I am happy with the sunglasses and I think they will be great for all the use in this summer<br />I had to returned the sunglasses they are really bad quality not what I thought and they broke
1.0,"Big and bulky, just like a bowling ball bag. Leather was not soft either and did not seem genuine."
1.0,I hate it.
1.0,Very cheaply made and most were so small I wouldn’t even wear them
1.0,These pants were 100% see through - I will be returning
1.0,The bow popped of when trying to put shoe on. Very flat footed.
1.0,iPhone 6 barely fits and doesn't fit with any cover.
1.0,Super cheaply made. Have barely used them. Yesterday I put them in my dash accessory holder and they literally split. The plastic under the eye frame just split. They're under so much pressure and so badly made they just crapped out. Would not recommend.
1.0,Not even close to pick advertised
1.0,Thin & cheap fabric.
1.0,These ran tiny; the proportion from front to back is not designed for a woman’s figure.
1.0,It’s way to large  I asked for a refund over a week ago and I haven’t heard anything
1.0,I know...pj’s are suppose to be lose and baggy but these are ridiculous.
1.0,"I was so excited when I got this dress!  It fit perfectly with a little room to spare, but then I hand washed it & hung it up to dry and it shrunk two sizes.  I have never in my life had this happen."
1.0,"Green color was nothing like I ordered, fit weird and was to tight in weird places. Had to return sadly."
1.0,"This item runs very small. The 3x I ordered, my 17 y/o daughter who is a size 14 wore it very well!"
1.0,Not the best copy.
1.0,"They were bigger than expected, and they were not as pretty."
1.0,"This is the worst t-shirt I've ever bought/seen.  It's a terrible fit, has a terrible feel, I do not recommend."
1.0,Extremely poor quality - bad fit - lining doesn't line up with the outer shell of the jacket.  Absolute CRAP!  Don't waste your money - the photo you are looking at is NOT representative of the actual product you receive!
1.0,This should not be sold as a mask ... it should be Emphasize that it carries no protection
1.0,"Shrank significantly after first washing. Flimsy, insubstantial fabric, and even after ironing and starching these aren’t suitable for everyday use (and frankly, not pretty enough to save for special occasions). One lace corner is itchy when it touches your nose, and looks like it was added on to justify the price of a marginal item. Not recommended, not a good value. Save your money and buy some really nice linen hankies, which is what I ultimately did, instead of this cheap alternative."
1.0,Love it cus it’s Mickey but it faded within a few days
1.0,"Many issues with this jacket. First, it is not as pictured. The colors are much more muted than the photo and the cut is very strange. When I tried it on (which I was hesitant to do because of the rank smell), it looked like a paper bag compared to the photo. Which brings me to my second point of the jacket smelling horrible. It is a moldy and chemically smell that is overpowering. Also, when I tried on the jacket, it was insufferably itchy. It really cannot and should not touch your skin because your skin will get irritated. Lastly, threads are coming off the edges of the fabric and shedding. Honestly, the shedding of the strings is the strangest thing I have seen on a jacket, and I cannot wear this in public, let alone to someone's house. I can't leave a trail of strings wherever I go."
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture. Looks like cheap plastic
1.0,"Red design is not embroidered, its printed! Horrible quality, read the reviews, it deserves every negative review it received."
1.0,Broke before I put them on like paper
1.0,Wrong had.. the one i received said FRIENDS instead and didn’t fit right
1.0,It’s worth the money u pay
1.0,Horrible. Totally not even wearable for me.
1.0,It showed up broken and is a complete inaccurate description. This item is complete crap
1.0,Band was cute but patten started coming off.  Band was very thin and limp. I cut it so it wouldn’t be so long. So I can’t return it.
1.0,I typically wear a large. Got a medium it's still too big on me..  looks goofy on
1.0,"When my husband was unable to put this replacement  band on the watch that it was designed for ( Casio Men's MDV106-1AV Stainless Steel Watch), I took it to jeweler to see if they could put the band on the watch. They were unable to to put this band on the watch! This is false advertising at its worse!"
1.0,"Incredibly small, fabric is cheap.  Not worth the price, will be returning for refund."
1.0,"the dress is too thin, can be seen through ... not a good quality at all."
1.0,"This is a top fit for a child. It is also extremely cheap. The hearts look like a craft project. They are not placed in the right spot, are fraying and are not even the same size. This top is not good."
1.0,Definitely not the color listed. Quality is lacking
1.0,El producto no funciona llego defectuoso
1.0,Wore it once and I can't tell why the color changed already
1.0,The transition supposedly that they have does not even change to help block sun or lights
1.0,"The shoes came in an Amazon box loose. They were ordered as new but were not in a Michael Kors box, the left shoe was very loose, the right foot was fine, I returned them and ordered the same pair from Macy’s at the same price and free shipping"
1.0,The material was very cheap.  The dress was too tight on my chest but too big on my hips and looked awkward on me.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY!<br />Arrived with two holes, one in the shoulder and in the back. Material is very thin, not standard chenille."
1.0,No es lo que esperaba dice plata 9.25 y no es cierto es mala calidad
1.0,"I love my Crocs and thought I'd buy the Croc Butter to keep them well maintained.  The ""Croc Butter"" is really nothing more than some oily substance on a sponge.  Once you use it, it immediately attracts any pet hair, dust, lint, etc that happens to be near the shoes!  That problem does go away after a few days but I wouldn't buy this again."
1.0,I am very very disappointed in this product and will be sending it back  unless another one is shipped in a 4xl size immediately.
1.0,Ring changed color! Very poor quality!!!
1.0,Awful material also
1.0,It arrived broken. Smaller than I expected. Did not return still may try to use
1.0,Queda muy fea
1.0,The bra is not at all stretchy and is far too tight. I am not exactly a huge human. I normally wear a medium but ordered up because I didn’t want it too tight. Well. I got it in but couldn’t get it off. I embarrassingly had to get help to get out of it. Fine possibly if you are more flat at the top but if you have some decent sized bumps then maybe choose another bra.
1.0,"What a joke.<br />I though this was going to be actually tie-died buy it looks pixel printed.<br />Not only that but the recommended size was too big.<br />Waste of money. Don't buy.<br /><br />Very unhappy, and I'm too busy to send back. Im really just going to have to toss the shirt."
1.0,"The sweatshirt is not what's shown in pictures. The pictures show a thicker type of material that could stand up on it's own, buttons are different colors, the drawstrings are not metal encased but a cheap flimsy plastic. It does run small, but that's most likely because they show one product, and then send you the cheaper version of it. Very disappointing. Look elsewhere."
1.0,"The shirt is not long, loose, and flowy as shown in picture. Instead it is very thin and clingy and short. Not a flattering shirt at all. I would return but I dont want to hassle with the return and the expense."
1.0,Beautiful print and goid quality but the top was too small. For a 2XL sized suit they shoulve made the area for breast more larger.
1.0,"It claimed to be 100% leather, it was genuine vinyl."
1.0,"This was NOT a t-shirt, it was a JERSEY!!!! I bought this for my brother but had to return it because of the material. Very disappointed."
1.0,Fabric is not breathable. Not suitable for a face mask.
1.0,"We opened this and within 2 minutes of my daughter playing with the cat, the stick broke from the string. What a complete piece of crap! I want a refund and I don’t know how to contact the seller, this is ridiculous."
1.0,"Liked it when I tried it on, however it shrinks in the washing machine (washed on cold, hung to dry). Super disappointed. Never even wore. Save your $$$"
1.0,Look nice but fell apart quickly
1.0,"This swimsuit will not stay up! I'm size B cup, medium build (130lbs) and it  just rolled off my chest. Open and loose around the breasts and would NOT stay! Cannot wear, it's useless.. You can tell before trying it on that it wont stay up. The cut & shape is visually obvious that it will just roll off. Not well designed. Fails as a swimsuit."
1.0,"If I could return this I would. I have many of these socks and they are great...however, wherever this came from they weren’t stitched correctly, and when I put them on they weren’t wearable...very disappointed they “aren’t eligible for return”"
1.0,These felt very cheap. Lightweight plastic. Would have loved the fit if they were made with better material
1.0,Terrible product. Everything liquid gets through them onto your hands as soon as you start cleaning or dying hair etc.  also very thin and tear easily so not good for dry messes either. Zero stars. Bummer
1.0,It was very cute and comfortable. But literally fell apart on day 2 thumbs down 👎
1.0,Too Big!
1.0,"They smell horrible...even after washing a couple times. I have no idea what it is...but it won't go away. I was really excited about these, the quality and colors are great. But can't get past the smell :("
1.0,It broke putting it on. Very cheap.
1.0,"These sandals are very awkward. They are definitely most appropriate for very narrow feet. I wore them for a few hours on vacation, thinking surely flip flops would be fine....6 hours later, I desperately needed to get them off of my feet, which were blistered to a point that has left a scar on either side of my feet where the straps rubbed into my feet. Disappointing because they are gorgeous!!"
1.0,"It was broken when it arrived. For the price, I was sure it would look cheaply made and turn my wrist green 2 days after use, but still I expected to be able to use it at least once. Not even. Don't buy this."
1.0,Too long in the fingers
1.0,"The material started shedding right away, like within a week. I buy purses maybe twice a year if that, so this was super disappointing"
1.0,Thin cheap and flimsy
1.0,Didn't fit  in need to.exchange to small er zize
1.0,"It's not a sweatshirt as expected. It's one of those dumb silky shirts that get ruined super easy and show every fat roll. Plus it is not oversized, I'd size it as a medium and I ordered an XL."
1.0,This is probably 3 sizes too small.  Very disappointed.  Reached out to seller and can’t get it resolved.
1.0,Not good quality. Velcro is weak. The nose fell off day 1. Do not recommend.
1.0,These are wildly uncomfortable. The material is too stiff and after a few minutes it acts like sandpaper.
1.0,White is actually lavender
1.0,Too small can’t even fit a wallet
1.0,what a waste of money. They break upon putting them on your glasses. Don't bother
1.0,The coat FIT but the pieces do not actually fit together. I was very disappointed that the inside fleece was not actually made to connect to the outer shell. 2 completely seperate pieces that couldn't even be put together. Had to find something else.
1.0,The pin that holds the strap on broke within 3 days and the leather is very stiff.
1.0,These glasses did not even last me 3 weeks. The frames are extremely fragile and crack very easily. Total waste of money. Don’t bother.
1.0,"If you buy this coat have many disappointments has I had, besides losing money. Actually, the bag pink indicated what it is VERY VERY SMALL COAT. Actually umbrella showing the deceptive image is almost bigger that the coat. If you wish to have the garment, just want to show a product that nobody need to recommend. I already assumed lost moneyfrom my purchase of this product. If you want to buy in blue tone ALSO will be disappointed."
1.0,Beautiful piece but not one size fits all.
1.0,the strap on the wall it bro first time I held. It is completely separated from the wallet. Very poorly made!
1.0,Used on a golf visor when playing golf.  Fell off within 15 minutes
1.0,Sleeves were not matching. One sleeve is too small. One sleeve is too large. I wish Amazon will step up the game on sizing and product quality esp when from China!
1.0,"Waste of money, You get what you pay for SMH.<br />Has a funny smell, and no print indicating it’s a KF94 mask."
1.0,Kiddie jewelry!! Way too thin and tiny. Not like the picture. Immediately returned.
1.0,The necklace came on time. But the decal is off set inside 😢. It shows white on the top right corner.
1.0,"Disappointed! The fabric is thin, like a light cotton T-shirt. I got the x-small and it is HUGE! It fits like a medium or large. I am pretty good at sewing and fixing shirts so I will keep it and alter it, but not happy with the product. Would not recommend."
1.0,The strap across the front hurts. Don't buy it. I ended up giving it to my aunt who has a narrower foot. The seam also hits right along the inside foot bone :( Look good but hurts.
1.0,"I ended up returning this item. The sweater overall was beautiful.... Unfortunately the sleeves were too short. Or I should say one of them was too short, the other was fine."
1.0,Color was not a rose gold color at all. It came in a dark orange color
1.0,The top piece was broken in half upon arrival
1.0,"The quality of the product is very cheap, and was way to small!​"
1.0,"This bag is so tiny. Crossbody??? Not sure who could wear this as a crossbody bag, maybe a toddler or small child."
1.0,This tie started to fray after the first time my son wore it. Look for a different item.
1.0,Product came broken. Snapped in half and there is no return option.
1.0,"It arrived broken,  and even after I fixed the clasp it still keeps breaking.  It looks pretty,  but the quality leaves much to the imagination."
1.0,"The material is very nice, however, they are not true to size. Purchased an XXL, however, they are not made for thicker thighs or a little extra on the backside."
1.0,Ride up your belly
1.0,La textura de la tela no era lo esperado
1.0,"I weight 150# and bought the medium compression socks, but they are too small, hope I can return the two pairs that I haven't worn."
1.0,This is very poor quality. It was coming apart in three different areas. I am very disappointed!
1.0,Cheap and clunky
1.0,"Too short, have to be short to fit normal"
1.0,"Didn't sit comfortably as an over the shoulder bag and didn't quite fit everything I needed to put in there (a day planner, a moleskinne notebook, wallet, keys, wipes, phone, etc.)<br /><br />And so much for ""free returns"" if you're not conveniently located near an Amazon store. They charged me $8 to drop it with UPS."
1.0,Well .....it was cheaply made and arrived 4 weeks later .
1.0,It would have been awesome if it was the true size a 2x was like a children's medium omfg that is ridiculous. My wife isn't a big women but the sizes run super small usually she wears a large but I went bigger because I didn't know how small it would run but this is beyond ridiculous
1.0,It's a really cute skirt and the quality of the fabric is nice.. However.. there is 0 i mean ZERO stretch to the skirt. If you have big thighs or a butt... DO NOT ORDER. It'll look like you were hit with a frying pan to the butt lol.
1.0,"The product title says grip, but the car socks do not have grips on the bottom."
1.0,Products ship directly from China. It will take 2 months to receive them. The shirts are not true to size or color.
1.0,Overall very low quality mask and design. Tape removes paint and marks. Messaged customer service and they said that issue is pointed out in the description which it isn’t. Buyers beware!
1.0,"It’s probably the worst thing I’ve bought on Amazon, it’s got a part for you neck and two strings. It’s not what it looks like in the picture to say the least"
1.0,"The size I got is not what I order, and it's from China. I  don't want to wait it again."
1.0,Came with the back button missing
1.0,Product was trash!!
1.0,Does not work... waist of money
1.0,"Did not come with all pieces. Came with gloves, tights, earrings. No choker necklace? Wrong head piece? Fit not as expected."
1.0,"I received this today and was excited to use it.  It's far too large so I followed the instructions to remove links with the enclosed tool.  The tool immediately broke into 5 pieces upon trying to push the pin out of the watch.  I don't think I've ever seen anything break so quickly from so little effort.  The watch band could be fine but since you can't remove links to wear it, I'll never know."
1.0,"These clips aren’t durable. One of the pair broke soon after using a few times, now I only have one, which is useless. It’s a hassle to return them for exchange so I won’t bother."
1.0,I've had this bracelet on for 1 hour and the hair tie has fallen off 3 times. Waste of money.
1.0,"Super short bar, would not fit though the piercing and out the otherside. If you have a shallow piercing would probably work well for you, but for those who do not this is definitely not the right bar for you."
1.0,Description and quality
1.0,"The black was not the same as what was in the advertised picture. It was a total disappointment.The black shirt in the advert picture had brown contrasting stitches down the front, button holes  and the pocket and was being worn by your model, with brown chinos for emphasis. What was sent to me had black stitches, same colour as the shirt and consequently, was bland."
1.0,Can not recommend these. The print on these flake off in the wash and leaves your entire load of laundry covered with tiny pieces of white paint. See photo
1.0,"I loved them when I first got them.  They fit perfect and looked good but after only a couple of wears, one of the made to look worn hole in the jeans ripped apart and basically tore the jean leg almost off, can't wear it. Would not buy it."
1.0,Was a gift for my wife. we sent it back. Many other brands that are 38's fit. this one was way too small.
1.0,"Don't under any circumstances buy this thing here! Worst piece of junk ever. Looks like a dirty rag, not fit for winter, or the fall!"
1.0,way small much tight
1.0,product is cheap quality and arrived totally crushed flat. Complete waste of time and money.
1.0,Glasses snapped into in less than 3 months.  Not worth $22.00!  I got no response from seller.
1.0,Terrible looks like I put on a garbage bag
1.0,"The shirt was too small and I'm almost always a small, which is what I ordered.<br />It was also short in terms of length."
1.0,Absolutely horrible. I wore the shirt one time and it got a hole under the arm. I wore it maybe two to three hours. I'm sending in back.
1.0,The hat slipped right off my straight hair (pulled back in a pony tail for a workout)
1.0,Plastic jewelry.  Not what I expected and would have cost me more money to return them.  I would not recommend that anyone buy this product.
1.0,Just received package. The bottle itself has been opened halfway and leaked out ruining the brush. And the case has some discoloration because of it. Very disappointed. Read a few reviews stating the same issue was still hopeful because of the star rating. But sadly I fall victim to it as well. .<br /><br />Have no idea how good or not so good the product in itself performs. Since I'll be returning this.
1.0,Nothing like the picture too small and looks cheap.
1.0,These were way to small at a larger size. The soles were extremely hard. No problem returning them.
1.0,"Really, Cost Guard?<br />Keep the beacons of honor and duty buring…?<br />Pay someone to proof read!"
1.0,Brocken
1.0,Broke super fast. Very bad quality
1.0,It is not over sized its actually runs small &  short ..barely covered my backside it’s a very light weight tee-shirt. I need like 3 sizes bigger to get the a bit of a baggy look. Do not waste your time!
1.0,"Way too large. Not fitted like the picture, at all. Looks like a moo-moo. Returned."
1.0,Not impressed.  The medium looks like a child's small
1.0,This item is a knock off. Not a Swarovski product don't waste your money like I did.
1.0,Arrived in pieces- completely broken
1.0,I bought these bracelets when I didn't have enough  for a daddy daughter dance and I didn't open all of them. Didn't think I have to. And one of them have an offensive message. Very disappointed.
1.0,I was under the impression that this came with 2 barbels. I’m upset because almost $10 is wayyyyyy too much money to spend on one barbel and now I can’t  use them for my nipple rings like I wanted to.
1.0,"The item they send you looks nothing like the picture. I bought this color and a black one. The material is this thin super shiny velour, not a nice velour but a cheap greasy track suit velour from the 80's. It's not the fuzzy ""sherpa"" look in the pics. I wouldn't even pay $1 for this item. Pictures are totally misleading!"
1.0,"Dislike, As you move the mask becomes loss and comes down off face."
1.0,These are so small I think they are unusable.
1.0,Ordered these for my 8 and 10 year old for school. They are way to big they fit me and my husband. Sad that they are advertising for kids. Waste of money 😞
1.0,"Any garments not made in the U.S.A. (like this one) you'll need to get two sizes too large in order for them to fit right.  Cheap fabric, uncomfortable."
1.0,You are better off using those chuck e cheese fake teeth because that's basically what these are.
1.0,Way to big  sleeves were way to long
1.0,It's to big if it was more small would be much better.
1.0,The grammar is awful and weird.
1.0,"We have had these for less than 2 months and on both boots, the toe is peeling back from the soles. Very dissatisfied that they did not last."
1.0,Not good...
1.0,Shipping time was on time like stated but size wise is terrible. I thought this is suppose to be medium in men size but it only fits a child.
1.0,They didn't go on as easy as expected. Got one on and it hurt really bad.
1.0,"These were not inexpensive earrings, but the post broke off within a week. We were careful not to over tighten them, and they were worn as intended day and night. They were a lovely design, but a terrible waste of money."
1.0,This is little girl sizes.
1.0,"Son got this for Halloween. Waaay too big for a twelve year. Too big for his mother, too."
1.0,The color looks nothing like what is shown! If you are buying based off the  color you see online  then I wouldn’t recommend purchasing these.
1.0,Do quality checks not exist?
1.0,Not a good wear not a wear at all
1.0,"Ew I hated this.  I have a decently nice body - I am not super thin but I am athletic with a bit of a mom gut, so this seemed like it would be nice to wear, but it was not.  I thought that it ran very small and that caused the cup/breast area to be very low, and it didn't make my boobs look good, it made them look very saggy and yuck - now I do have a smaller bust area B/C so maybe if you were more well endowed that it would look better, but I think then you would run into lack of support.  So all in all this is not good.  I like the mesh but just not the style of this"
1.0,"Do not buy! There are multiple merchants using the same stock photo of these tanks. This merchants tanks are not cut right (cut to low under armpit showing alot of bra, and they are much thinner and cheaper then other merchant’s material) I tried to return and was surprised to find I can only return if I pay $4 each (i bought 7) for shipping. Highly disappointed and will be reaching out to amazon customer service."
1.0,"too big, too loose. Worst ""fit"". sleeves are super long and big! the pink is more of a hot pink vs the light blush shown on the pic. returned immediately."
1.0,Pattern different from shown. Runs a bit large.
1.0,I didnt like the feel of the dress and how uncomfortable it made me feel. Everytime I walked the dress crawled above my thighs.
1.0,Not real silver. Stones fell out after 1 week
1.0,"I should’ve read reviews. This is TERRIBLE quality. It doesn’t even fit as it should it’s see through completely which just isn’t what I expected for the picture that came up it’s cheap and my goodness. I didn’t know what size to get but, I got the same size I’ve been getting in others. No these are not shorts they are like biker shorts like they are tight and awkward on the thighs and loose and bulky at the hips. Just not flattering comfortable or attractive maybe that’s just my body would never recommend"
1.0,This is not red!! I received it and it was a ugly rusty orange ugly
1.0,Cheap feeling and mine was missing buttons. A little too small as well.
1.0,The Material is see-through and the pants are not a great fit.
1.0,I bought this item's and is nothing like what you are watching in the picture above ....It called fashion jewellery look cheep like a child toy was very disappointed so pleased do not order this save your money
1.0,Why in searches for US size 16 does this swimsuit come up at all?  The largest size offered XXL says it fits a US 8-10.  Every search for a size 16 suit is cluttered with cheap chines suits for very small sizes.
1.0,Cardboard was very clearly visible between a handful of junky fathers. I sent it back because it was absolutely worthless. A 5 year old could do a better job.
1.0,gum ball machine necklace.
1.0,I bought this for my girlfriend and we said  we would never purchase this polyester mess again don't waste your money it's not worth it as a matter of fact it's not even cotton
1.0,definitely looks way better in the product photo. i couldn't even give these away.
1.0,"I bought this same swimsuit in white/orange. It fits perfectly, so I wanted to buy it in another color. The bottoms fit great, but the top was COMPLETELY stretched out! The sizing for the top was 100% different than the orange one. I am 5'2 and about 110lbs. The small bottoms fit me perfectly, but the top fit so funky. The quality of the material was great also, but the fact that the sizing was so different than the other suit and it was stretched out is a big disappointment."
1.0,XL was too small. Very disappointed...
1.0,"Solid watch with great looks and fantastic lume.  And that’s where it ends.  This watch is AT LEAST  five full minutes slow a month. Sometimes more.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but unless your watches are just for decoration, you’ve probably heard enough.<br />I am NOT happy with this purchase whatsoever"
1.0,Heats up for a few mins after putting it on but once your out of the house dressed it shuts off . Forcing you to unzip the vest then the little pocket on the inside just to get the power bank and then you have to unplug and plug it back in to get it to turn on again.  Idk if it's a safety feature to keep it from breaking or what but it's basically useless if you cannot stay warm longer then a few mins and definitely not worth the price I paid 21 for it 🤷
1.0,"Although I always order XL, these are cut too small, more like Medium"
1.0,"I had read the reviews and knew that it would run small but that's not the word. I'm 5 ft 11 and normally wear an extra large so I ordered a 3x due to reviews. This shirt was so short it went to my belly button without moving my arms and was skin tight so i couldnt button it if i wanted to. Also was more than see through and full of some dust of some sort.  I'm glad my 12 yr old 99 lb daughter can wear it for a few months as she is very tall so will be too short soon also has to wear another shirt under it, cuz I sure cant.  So disappointed. I recommend you don't buy this shirt at all."
1.0,"Ordered on Tuesday. Cart said it would deliver on Saturday. When I checked out the cart changed to Wednesday and never even shipped until Saturday. I needed it for Sunday so it was returned. I expect a delivery when it says it will. Not a bait and switch after you pay for it. Purple Color was right, material was a flowy swimsuit like material. Can’t get past the crappy delay on delivery."
1.0,Poor quality material/ not satisfied at all.
1.0,They were too small. I had to return them.
1.0,"Ugh.. 30 bucks for this?. Feels extremely cheap. The fit is weird, the elastic waist band hugs but the elastic band at the bottom is really loose around the legs. Looks awful and unflattering. I usually prefer to leave positive reviews if I leave one at all. But this was really bad. Don't waste your money."
1.0,I had to add links and clasp...totally disappointed
1.0,"This shirt ran incredibly tiny and I’m only 124 lbs. I had to get the large and I couldn’t even fit my head into the neck hole because of how small it was sewn. Beware: made in China. From my experience this means it runs tiny and is made cheap, which is what happened with this shirt. Don’t recommend this brand or shirt."
1.0,"Color faded after washing it few times, It be comes avocado color.. Not good."
1.0,This dress was trash. The fabric was so cheap.  Do not recommend at all. Returned.
1.0,The fabric is very bad and wont last at all it is very bad
1.0,Waste money poor material
1.0,Does not look like the picture and terrible material...
1.0,"I'm 5'6&#34;,  33 Inch waist and 167.00lbs...I specify this so seller can use weight or fatness as an excuse. I rcvd this a planned to ware it this morning for the first time and the buckle broke at soon as I try to adjust it!"
1.0,Dress hem came down and bottom of dress ripped at first use
1.0,Men's casual linen pants with elastic waist.... ummm yea I didn't get any of that. Title should be Small child's casual Khaki style pants with no elastic. No joke the xxl Might fit a 10 year old at best.
1.0,"Don’t buy this 🤮 There’s no scallop detail whatsoever. I’m 5’5 and I ordered a large, the bottom of the shirt goes to about an inch above my belly button."
1.0,Horrible fabric. It's a polyester knit like kid's nonflammable pajamas
1.0,Major disappointment.  This product was too short and too small.  Not what I was expecting at all!
1.0,Dress was not like in the picture it was also very see through had to put shorts under and it was way too small
1.0,Buckle malfunctioned and became locked in place. Had to cut the belt off of me. Awful
1.0,This dress is disappointing nothing like the pic have to return your sellers must gave the buyers their money worth..fake pictures and when u get the clothes is garbage..
1.0,The item arrived with a stain on it. I wouldn't order again
1.0,Do not purchase<br />Way to tight cutting off my circulation
1.0,Way to small. Not even close
1.0,Very unflattering...looks like a moo moo
1.0,It's way too small for its stated size. I bought a large but it fits more like a small. Material is also too thin. I don't think this will survive multiple washings.
1.0,"When I got my item for my daughters Halloween costume , it was broken . The chain was broken and tied together in a knot in hopes to not notice but they shipped it like that anyway . This is crap !"
1.0,I am so sad about this ring! It was so pretty for about five seconds. Then started changing colors and turned my finger green!
1.0,"I am not exactly a giant, but the lady wearing these earrings as we see them on Amazon must be really small or she just has very tiny ears! I completely did not get the impression that these earrings are almost microscopic. I received a pair of backings which are made of the same material as the earrings, and they are so small that it was difficult to pick them off the table, but that turned out to not be a problem because the holes on the metal backing is too small that the earrings do not fit into them. It maybe the reason why I also received two sets of plastic backing. I am sure the seller knows the metal backings won't  work,  thus the plastic back ups. I consider this a dishonest sale. Regarding the size, the seller should consider placing an object with a universally known size  next to these earrings. The seller should not send backings that the earrings do not fit into."
1.0,The hem is already coming undone after two wears. I sew & can fix it but it isn’t worth the price if you don’t have those skills.
1.0,"The bracelet is nice, but too small for wrist.  No adjustment can be made."
1.0,Size is not true sizing.
1.0,The glasses received were not even close to the colors posted. I bought these wanting NEON colored glasses and received mostly white and black with some muted green/orange ombré looking things. Very disappointed in the misleading pictures. I expected to receive a random mix of colors but of the colors advertised.
1.0,Did not work.
1.0,"Cheap, thin material. The sleeves are baggy and above my elbows and I bought the correct size."
1.0,"The one that came is a nice fabric, my only complaint is that it is hot to wear.  Also wonder where my 2nd one is??"
1.0,One star - finish had bad repair spot on front<br />One of the watch winders squeaks loudly and<br />clearly looks and acts like a second quality product rather than a first - very disappointed.
1.0,"Terrible lab coats! Complete waste of my money cheaply made, tear apart way to easily the pocket threads fell apart instantly! Would never buy again nor would I recommend buying these!"
1.0,I oredered BLUE ... it's PURPLE and the material used to 'knit' is not nice. really a disappointment.
1.0,"These are not good quality, they immediately turned my daughters fingers green and a couple of them broke a few days after buying them."
1.0,"Unfortunately they didn’t fit.<br />Disappointed, the lenses looked great"
1.0,"irst, the dislike.  The leather belt was inserted and locked into the receiver on the buckle slightly crooked.  Being a slob, that doesn't bother me much.  If it did bother, one would have to cut off a slice of leather, reinsert and lock.<br />  The leather is good and heavy, the two colors are handy (if one cares about color coordination) and changing the color is easy once one learns how or, in my case, does it accidentally.  So far, so good.<br />  After a month or so of use it appears that the material is not leather or has been glued and is not standing up to use.  Not good and not worth much of anything."
1.0,Just a sequined blouse with crap hemming & awkward sleeve length. Doesn’t even pretend to have a loose neckline or long slouchy fit :( it’s literally just a shirt. I’m not sending it back ‘cause I’m too lazy but it’s lame & NOT what I ordered!<br />Save your money (unless you want a sequined blouse)
1.0,"This dress has me bummed. It is very thin and see through. It has a very strong chemical smell ,  I'm afraid to wash it though because I'm not sure it would hold up  in the washing machine  just to even see if the smell will come out . The neck is very small and odd shaped so are the arms. It doesn't have a tag to tell you front or back. Very strange dress. I was so hopeful because I needed a black dress ASAP. And it has so much potential  who doesn't love pockets ?  But this is not the dress just keep looking . The price was right but that was all."
1.0,I ordered 2 sizes up and could barely get this over my head. It covered half of my chest... I'm a 34D. This was made for an A cup. No stretch whatsoever.
1.0,Not like described an runs extremely small
1.0,"The picture  versus the product I received  looks very different in size,fit and looks. It looks very ugly when I saw it firdt as oppose to the picture  displayed.the material  does not look like  the one in the  picture  and I ordered a small  and it is big"
1.0,I loved the way these looked but the latches were so fragile they would not have lasted through even one wearing.  I sent them back.  Company needs quality control.
1.0,"Very cool looking. But it is made from plastic. I found out the hard way when I was grilling. It started to melt and stick to my clothes. Be aware that for serving or working in the kitchen with cold food only. Otherwise, it could be dangers. Need to have disclaimer on the ad."
1.0,Material is thin and cheap looking.<br />Seller is from China my fault for not checking. Item was very poor quality. Seller told me it was to expensive to return and that they could offer me 20% back and that I could give item to someone else as a gift!
1.0,Cheap looking. I tossed them
1.0,Poor quality and one set of earrings don’t match. We got a pink and a purple as a set.
1.0,"They are very nice looking, but I was unable to get any of these to open.  Even my husband couldn't get them to open using tools."
1.0,Was not happy with the matetial claspe broke after 2 days
1.0,Way too small and way too sheer
1.0,"Hat was nice, was larger than my head..."
1.0,This is way overpriced. Especially when you can just go to Walmart and get it for half the price at 15.00
1.0,I received this dress and it had a hole on the side. It is not major and I can fix it but still I was hugely disappointed.
1.0,Polyester nightmare
1.0,Me and my children love the fact that they did come in early but then the ones that came in where way smaller than what was described you actually had to buy two or three sizes bigger than what you needed I should have returned them but instead of returning them I went ahead and gave them to someone that was at that size when you buy an adult size that is a medium it should have been able to fill an adult medium but only it fit it didn't even fit an adult small so be careful when ordering items like this the quality the item was excellent
1.0,They only stay charged for a minute! Literally. I have a very disappointed little girl.
1.0,Too short waisted
1.0,Cheap looking for gold plated!
1.0,Do not buy this item broken in one day. Wife has a pandora bracelet granddaughter wears some she wanted one of her own so we bought this piece of crap these are no good
1.0,They don’t work and unfortunately for me I didn’t realized this is not available for return. Money wasted!
1.0,"The slipper fit but I could not wear it because the thong between the toes hurt too bad, was very uncomfortable."
1.0,"So very, very tiny."
1.0,Ugly and bulky
1.0,The size on this is wrong top is a Medium and pant is a large.
1.0,Terrible quality.<br /><br />Washed according to the label and the dress shrunk.
1.0,"Way too small.  Ordered a large and it fit my tiny, 100 lb neighbor."
1.0,Blocked very little noise
1.0,Cheap fabric.....fits too tight!
1.0,I’d give this no stars if I could.  So disappointed it was made for a child I think. It was way to small didn’t fit
1.0,SAYS 24 INCHES it was barely 10 inches!
1.0,This shirt had disgusting stains on it.
1.0,"Terrible in every way. I'd give this corset zero stars if I could.<br /><br />I am no stranger to corsets: I own about 20 corsets and I know very well that different styles fit differently. So I made sure I followed the instructions carefully: I'm 34-27-38, which puts me solidly in size M according to the size chart. I had to remove a full 4&#34; from the back of the corset and sew in new eyelets - and it's STILL too big. THIS CORSET RUNS WAY BIGGER THAN THEIR SIZE CHART.<br /><br />Plus, stretchy corsets are, literally, completely non-functional. You CANNOT cinch if the material stretches when you pull it. You don't reduce in size, the corset just stretches and bulges around you and makes you look WORSE. I wasn't trying to waist train or anything (TOTALLY not the right garment for that), I just wanted to get a nice snug corseted fit. This garment was beyond useless for that. I'm fairly thin, with nice curves (narrow waist, wide hips), and this corset made me look like a straight up-and-down sausage. Horribly unflattering.<br /><br />I'd ask for my money back if I hadn't already altered the thing. I'll be able to make it work for this costume, but only because I'm wearing a DIFFERENT corset underneath me so I get an actual cinch. I shouldn't need ANOTHER corset in order to be able to wear THIS corset."
1.0,The pattern is very nice however the quality is very poor. The stitching is falling out and the wire pokes through the side into my skin.
1.0,"This shirt is orange, NOT red.  Very disappointed. :("
1.0,Did not like. Did not fall on my shoulders like it looks like in the picture
1.0,"Sadly, nothing about this top met expectations. It took forever to arrive, once it arrived it was the wrong color. Dark brown? Ummm nope. It is a pale taupe at best, and short. I’m 5’7 and it runs super short. I wouldn’t order again. ☹️"
1.0,"Not a 6g, these ended up in an 8g ear hole, instead. : ("
1.0,size is waaaaay off
1.0,In general this is what I was looking for.  However I’ve never seen a manufacturer put the care tag where it would be visible when the clothing is being worn.  If I had time I’d return it for sure.  As it is I need it for tomorrow so I’ll just have to try to cut it off.
1.0,Cute style but way too small. Even ordered a size larger... Chinese size chart incorrect.  Returned.
1.0,Cromer plated plastic? You get what you pay for with this
1.0,These cannot possibly be night vision glasses. The darker pair has darker lenses than the pictures shown and using them in the dark is like being completely blind!
1.0,Looks NOTHING like it does on the model. Very unflattering. You would need to wear something under the dress. Sheer
1.0,"I carefully read the reviews on this dress. I saw it ran small, so I ordered 2 sizes up to a 4X.<br />I wear a 2X but am pear shaped. The top part of dress in the shoulders, arms, bust and waist fit perfect, but tummy, hips and thighs were a huge NO. The material is like a satiny cloth with absolutely no stretch nor give and is cut straight down. If you are a curvy below the waist 2x maybe get the 5X? I end up giving it to my neighbor who is plus & near my size but is an inverted triangle shape. Sure, she will enjoy it as the print is pretty and vivid. This dress is not fupa, wide hips nor juicy thighs friendly."
1.0,it didn't fit well and looked very cheap
1.0,"Terrible quality shirts. 1 shirt came ripped, the other 2 were completely shredded after the first wash cycle.. waste of money."
1.0,Unable to attach bands to my Fitbit watch. Everyone has tried
1.0,These were the worst slippers ever they had no support at all and it was like putting your foot in a cardboard box like they had no size so needless to say I sent them back which is no problem as Amazon is great at refunding.
1.0,"What a disappointment. Here on Amazon they show a picture of a chrome looking plastic piece, what showed up was a bad printout on paper set in resin. After I read more closely, they admit (in the small print) it is printed out on glossy paper. Lame. Duped again."
1.0,Just got these elastic cords. I had hoped to replace the too short cords on my new KN95 masks. Not going to happen. Even with the 'buckles' removed they are the same length as the too short original cords.
1.0,Looks nothing like it is pictured! The fabric is so stiff it doesn't fall at all the way it should and it not even close to the length it shows in the picture. Returning this item given it is completely pictured wrong.
1.0,False info about a moon phase indicator.
1.0,Sizing info way off. It had to be retur n.v ed
1.0,I ordered two pair of these love fans leggings in a size XL. One pair without pockets fit perfectly while the pair with pockets was incredibly small. I would say they were a size medium at best.
1.0,Over price for its poor quality.
1.0,Very disappointed. It broke after wearing it two days!
1.0,way too small.  ick!
1.0,it s no the same size.
1.0,Nunca me lledaron
1.0,Quality is not as expected
1.0,This item is really cute but very cheaply made. The frame is so cheap and light that it doesn't position correctly on my nose. I called Amazon to send it back.
1.0,Do not buy! the post is too thick and doesn’t fit in my daughters ears. Extremely disappointed with this product.
1.0,"Looks very nice but cheap material, brake the same day that I weared,"
1.0,Terrible quality dress! It does not fit as expected and the zipper was broken. Super disappointed as I was looking forward to this dress for my vacation.
1.0,They r not clear as original<br />they wearout fast<br />They r for flake oakley not for flake xlj<br />Polarized word not written
1.0,"Not only did my items ship far later than promised, but they show up with these imperfections in the color. I had no choice to wear them as they were delivered 2 hours before the planned event. I would have returned these in a heartbeat if we hadn't worn them. Terrible product."
1.0,No boxer at all. Way too short to call a boxer.  No legg at all. Won't help stop chaffing when horse riding or motorcycle riding. Closer to a tighty whitey.  Needs 6 to 8 inches longer to be a boxer.
1.0,I was so excited to get these and was super disappointed when I opened the package and they weren't the correct glasses. I added a screenshot of the listing that shows what I was supposed to receive and a picture of what I got. I returned them. I'm going to re-order and see if I can get the correct sunglasses this time.<br />UPDATE: ordered again to see if I could get the correct glasses. If I could I would have given these 0 stars. Got the correct glasses this time but they were dirty with make-up and used (see photos). Don't bother buying these.
1.0,"If I could give this negative stars, I would. The snap broke on it when I opened it for the first time out of the package. It feels like it's made of felt. In this case, you get much LESS than you pay for. I wouldn't have taken it for free. Don't bother with this one - spend a little more and buy one that will actually work."
1.0,The shirts bleed black when you sweat!
1.0,"I put these in a couple pairs of my son's shoes for his preschool debut, and after the first day of wear, all of the print as well as my writing had been rubbed off and the stickers had scooted around in the shoes. I wish they worked. Now I'm stuck with a pack of them, and my son has some sweet, randomly placed white stickers with nothing on them stuck to the insoles of his shoes."
1.0,"I bought 5 of these dresses and when they arrived I had my niece who is the oldest of all of my flower girls try hers on. It was HUGE on her, so we went down a size and it was huge, so we went all the way down from an 8 to a 4 and it still didn't fit."
1.0,Not at all what I expected. Again polyester fiber and not like the picture at all. Straps on the shoulders were so thin and have already popped.
1.0,Did not fit my iphone as described
1.0,"Very high wasted, the front pockets are long, back pockets are set too far apart, thin material.  Nothing like the picture. I kept them to wear around the house."
1.0,"I’ve had a few G Shock watches, this one looks nice but it’s for children or tiny women. This should be specified so you don’t waste your time like I did. Sent it back"
1.0,SO SMALL...I ordered 1 size up. I didn't even try them on....however my size XXL fit my 13 yr old daughter who still wears a KIDS size 12!! Total bummer!
1.0,Not as the description says
1.0,Run extremely small for size ordered. Can't exactly return the either..
1.0,Cheap made in China rubbish. Very cheap synthetic that I can only imagine sweats like crazy. Looks like he has something dripping from his nose rather than beaver teeth. Disappointing for the price.
1.0,Looks like a bathrobe.  Edges are unfinished. It's not high/low at all and probably only looks good on slender girls
1.0,"So when I got this, I was in love. I've had  it on and the black inside of the lettering has started to come off. I wish it would last longer or I  could get some compensation for this ring, as it was cheaper than I had realized."
1.0,The material was stiff.  I returned this dress.
1.0,"I purchased this awesome hat based on reviews!! Listed as silver steampunk. i received it, its silver (the rhinestones) but the cap itself is beige/creme!! i would NEVER ever choose this color!!! i leave for a trip in 2 days, so upset!!!!!! The net back of cap in pic looks silver, grey or even maybe a white...But NOT THIS !!!! Far from white!!!"
1.0,Poor quality sent back. Looks like the mice got to it
1.0,Terribly constructed sunglasses. Earpiece broke easily. Only used it a few times.
1.0,"I was excited to find polarized frames that fit since I need very small frames for my face. Loved color, style and comfort. I was going to order another color. Bought 4 months ago, kept in nice holder with snap when not wearing. Last month I noticed edge of left lens changing color like it was separating. Like my IPhone screensaver pulls away when air gets under it from crack. Anyway now almost all of each lens is doing the same. Won’t be getting another pair for sure. I never dropped these except in my lap in car seat!! Tried to get good pic of lens—never got a scratch on them!!!"
1.0,"Wore the band for 4 DAYS, then the clasp just fell off."
1.0,It’s a real nice anklet I wish it didn’t poped
1.0,Most ugliest color ever
1.0,Very cheaply made.  Came with a 1&#34; hole in a seam.  Not going to bother requesting a replacement because the snap looks like it wouldn't survive a week anyway.  Took a gamble on something cheap and it didn't pan out.
1.0,The lens popped out ..hard for my son 6 year old to pull up to go to the glasses
1.0,"Bag fell apart after one week, had to trash it."
1.0,I bought the wrong polishing clothe! I meant to buy the Sunshine clothe which I have used for years. IT really gets the job done. Nothing comes close to the Sunshine. I'm sorry I bought this. It's terrible.
1.0,After a month having the ring its turning black
1.0,"This item is not a purse it is more like a tote ,it's not cute looking ,looks nothing like the picture."
1.0,"UNBELIEVABLY small. Super thin (which isn't too bad if you're running or wearing at the beach). Read the reviews and bought a size up for my friend, who is usually a medium, and it still fits too snug. Like not cute snug...I missed my return window or else I would definitely be retuning it. I haven't washed it either, but I think the lettering would peel off as well."
1.0,"Just received this today and the leather is cracked and flaking off. Would not recommend at all, and I will be contacting the seller."
1.0,Cheap fabric awful look
1.0,Not as appears in picture. Low quality. You can see the metal backing through the “gems”. One was chipped in mine.
1.0,Very unhappy with the quality of this. I ordered the same one last year and it was beautiful. This one was really loose and longer
1.0,Not worth waiting a month for
1.0,Material or cheap machine wash is not acceptable pockets are pretty much close to your armpit and I am 5‘1“ tall
1.0,It has a small opening to fit the sunglasses. It doesn't fit any of my pairs. Unfortunately the product is useless for me.
1.0,This is the worse dress I have ever ordered
1.0,Absolute crap
1.0,"The material is not as it appears in the photo. In person, it mimics what most children's Halloween costumes are made of. Unfortunately, these dresses were purchased as birthday gifts and weren't opened until after the refund expiration date had passed."
1.0,HORRIBLE quality! Got a run in my crotch the first day I wore them! They were also very long for capris might as well have gotten regular ones. Gott3n better quality at Wal-Mart for 5$
1.0,The color and it missing 1 set
1.0,"Prompt delivery. Great customer service. The dress was just too short. Which was sad, because it’s so cute."
1.0,"ok my daughter is 5'1"" and 115lbs we ordered her an XL and it is still kinda small on her but then the first time I washed this (I hung to dry, did not put in dryer) the one rose came completely off and the big rose on the back is starting to.come off after wearing and washing 1 time!! would not waste your money on this item, in my opinion!"
1.0,It’s like the have the wrong size I ordered these shorts 3 times each time a no go
1.0,"No glare help what so ever. And unless you have an extremely wide face, they are too big!"
1.0,"Had to return it, way too small"
1.0,I bought this and the clasp broke the first time I put it on.  Very disappointed.
1.0,They don't stretch.These pants are not even true to their size. I just stuck my legs in and couldn't even get them over my legs.
1.0,This suit is really cute in person.  The front has molded cups and underwires; unfortunately the back is just one thin piece of swimsuit material (see photo).  This means that the weight of your chest isn't supported by any sort of band. Think about a bra that's normal in front but just a loose piece of spandex in the back.  It makes the suit unwearable and I'll be returning it.
1.0,The fabric is cheap and very thin!
1.0,"I don like the material, and the size was not what I expected, quality is very poor"
1.0,This would be my 4th trainer. I replace them from time to time when they stretch out.<br /><br />This is not US size. Order up up up or maybe another brand.
1.0,"In the picture the face looks black. What I got was a weird tan or ivory color.<br />You get what you pay for I guess, the feel of the watch is cheap. The metal is more like hard aluminum and plastic and it's not very polished - the edges on each band link are rough and scratchy.  FYI: the band is also not adjustable!"
1.0,Cheap like the price
1.0,So the first time I ordered it was too big. Since the top feels very comfortable I went and reordered another one of medium size. Though the size is find the top cake with a hole! It was very disappointing and I'm not reordering it again. I don't trust them to send a good quality top.
1.0,Just metal.
1.0,Not sure it was the size I ordered. The neckline tag had already been cut off the product and all other tags were removed as well. What should have been a medium was very large at the shoulders and around the body yet the length only came to the belt line.
1.0,Broke the next day after getting it
1.0,I bought couple different shirts for a upcoming Miami trip and I didn’t end up liking him and I went to return them after the trip with tags And Amazon Kohl’s would not allow it because the return date had expired
1.0,"Too big, screen print not good, not worth the money"
1.0,Pretty.. but broke in the first 5 minutes. Not sturdy.
1.0,"Ordinarily I wear an extra extra small.  Since there was no xxs I ordered a small.  The fit across the bust was way too small.  The material is very thin.  The shirt is way too long.  I could not wear it in public.  Maybe I should have a medium, but I think I will pass this brand of shirt."
1.0,Its see through on the bottom half and cheaply made
1.0,Piece if trash
1.0,Didn't have the size on the page.  It was a size 30 and I'm in a 38/40
1.0,To small I returned them back
1.0,The box of gloves were crushed and gloves spilled out inside the uncrushed delivery package.
1.0,Looks nice but poor quality.  The seam of the underlay er began to split within the first 15 minutes of wear. It ripped about 8 inches over the course of that first (and only) wear.  Because of the grain of the silky fabric I doubt restitching will hold.
1.0,They were too b regular Reading Glasses NOT SUNGLASSES
1.0,The adjustable strap is too short. I do not have a big waistline. I extended the belt all the way out and it was still too short and the strap is cheap quality.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:540f0ace256c0876d8f08f4978295386]] I received this bag and used it less than 2 weeks. within the first week there was a large rip between the big back pocket and the small front one. then after a few more days i continued to use the bag and just be careful with it. Took anything “heavy” out of it and was using the bag to carry a gopro, wallet, keys, and skate tool. after about three days from the first rip on the top I was skating with some friend and as we were riding to a spot the bag ripped again on the bottom of the front pocket. I moved everything to the back pocket and rode to my car and as soon as I got to my car the big pocket ripped on the side. I was very disappointed with how long this bag held up because I really liked the design and wanted to use it for college."
1.0,The material looked cheap<br />I did not like the color
1.0,The order was not as the description stated. I was to receive 50 individually wrapped black masks and I only received 10 and they were not individually wrapped.
1.0,These absolutely do noy fit Oakley crossrange.
1.0,These belly rings are not worth the money Nor are the sizes the same the stem on all of them are Entirely too short but there is some of them that's even shorter than others I have a Shallow piercing and they still won't fit in it they're they're not made right and when I contacted the seller about this they told me thank you for the feedback that was it I spent $9 on these worthless belly rings. Do not waste your money.
1.0,Beyond disappointed I don’t even understand what I received it was like four times the size of the pictures horrible
1.0,"It's cheaper than OEM, but not if you need to replace it every 8 months. It worked originally but was a little crooked, which made it difficult to back up in a straight line. Now 8 months later it's dead again."
1.0,Wrong color wrong size
1.0,"Horrible, thin fabric, has no body to it, limp, wrinkles terribly in dryer. I do not recommend."
1.0,Not sure how well the pink glasses will work. I bought the pair for the black glasses and when I went to wear them the first time I realized one of the nose pieces was missing. It was not in the package. Total junk.
1.0,One day of wear it fell apart and turned color.
1.0,Product size poorly represented in ad. Smaller than appeared
1.0,"This basically looks like a pillow case with with arms that are too wide. I have had moderate success ordering less expensive clothing on amazon before, but this was unfortunately an epic fail."
1.0,Very flimsy and tarnished fast
1.0,"The old adage your get what you pay for is true. These were cheap but stiff and stink to high heavens, threw them out."
1.0,Tear after few days.
1.0,"no se parece en nada a la foto, pues  no tiene buen acabado."
1.0,Cheaply made<br />The back got loose after only 1 time use<br />And it doesnt stay on the cuff position Stably<br />Not worth $26!
1.0,"belt was supposedly small, was too big, still used and didn't lose any pounds"
1.0,Went bad within a month.
1.0,Acreage sunglasses
1.0,I wore it once and the straps came stitched while in the washer. It was a simple fix and I still wear it. Cute but not made well.
1.0,The bottom fit but the top was 5 sizes too small
1.0,It looks nothing like the picture. The v neck is higher and it’s shiny instead of a sweatshirt look.
1.0,DEFINITELLY NOT A YOUTH MEDIUM
1.0,They were so tight around my neck I couldn’t stand wearing them. My husband is a large man with a large head. He tried but could barely put one on. I felt I was being choked. Never used. Waste of money.
1.0,It’s nothing but a thin trash bag
1.0,Did not get to wear them. The back of the shoe ripped while putting them on for the first time.
1.0,"Broke as soon as I took them out of the box. 2nd try with these, definitely NOT worth it."
1.0,Strap that goes above the ankle was huge.  It didn't fit around ankle at all.  Way to big
1.0,"I really wanted to like this band, I love the bright colors. But the band just didn't work for me. First, the band wouldn't stay as snug as it needed to be. It would loosen up over the course of a day. Second, the adjustment D-ring sits right along the bottom of my wrist in the most uncomfortable spot for someone who works at a computer. My wrist rests on the desk and that D-ring is right in the way."
1.0,"Nothing like the pictures at all, such a bummer"
1.0,They are SHARP and no not turn into your nose do not buy!!
1.0,Tiny round not flat black rocks arrived. Three of them... not what was described at all!
1.0,"I gave this one star because a star rating was compulsor; however,  it isn't deserving.<br />This dress is way too large and has no value for money!<br />I ordered a small and it fits like a large!!<br />The sparkle is already falling off and i have not even washed it!!<br /><br />A complete disappointment!! DO NOT PURCHASE"
1.0,The dress came in on time. The color was true to picture. Upon opening the package a confection damage in the fabric was evident. I returned the item
1.0,Shirt had s run in the front. Returned.
1.0,Broke after a few times wearing them.
1.0,rusted like not very happy only able to wear a few times before that happened
1.0,First day wearing it and it’s all torn apart on the inside
1.0,Definitely  doesn't  look like the picture. The top part reaches half the head. The length is too small. Overall bad quality
1.0,Yes they were the right size for my daughters feet but I couldn't actually get them on her feet due to the affixed leather piece
1.0,"Band is very small size, for kids only."
1.0,"Just got this last week, wore once and the draw string with the clip to hold it in place broke off. Not durable"
1.0,Cheaply made! Don’t waste your time you can actually come out cheaper making your own shirt. At this point I believe people are trying to make a few dollars and don’t care who they get over on :(
1.0,horrible... red dye faded away
1.0,Very cheap quality. More like plastic than leather. Stitching is pressed and not hand sewn. Only thing good was the easy return. Certainly not worth the money.
1.0,"The color and length of these boas are great and I would have given this product a 5 star rating, however.... they SUCK! They smell so bad when you take them out of the package and they shed. The feathers fall apart so easy and they just do not last. I had to go buy different ones to use for my project. I requested a refund from the seller."
1.0,Flimsy and not a good quality. We used for days and almost broken now.
1.0,Not as cute in person and snap in front was sewn on backwards.  I'm returning it.
1.0,I hated it I will never use it. Poor quality and ugly. I am giving to the  used clothing store. I  bought a leather purse no made made material again.
1.0,Very disappointed. The pendant came broken in the chain. Braclet was intact.
1.0,The watch doesn't work
1.0,"These uggs are FAKE if you don't know how to tell here's a hint if the fur comes off onto your sock or with your hand easily pretty much like a shedding cat fake, if the material inside is rough,thin, an not very thick it's fake, tag inside should have a halogram (a shiny barcode) if not fake, and the material should be soft and shouldn't not be rough. All real uggs come with a booklet keep that in mind"
1.0,I Not impressed at all. The waist belt was so large I could wrap it around my waist twice. can be used on my hips but not for a waist. I am 5'7&#34; and 125lbs. This thing looked terrible...
1.0,Pants too long.  Refunded.
1.0,very low quality
1.0,Lights worked for 2 days on one shoe.  Trying to contact seller and it's been impossible.
1.0,"You get what you pay for.  Pretty bu., ropes unraveled first day of wear."
1.0,Pues no me agrado no es plata es plastico duro.tube que regresar!....y todavia no me regresan mi renbolso...es una patraña...
1.0,"Well the material felt less like cotton and looks more like slandex but it’s a looser fit. I’m not happy with the length I’m 5’6” and they’re too short but also the crotch to the top of the pant where it hits the hips I’d long. It’s almost like they were made for a short, fat person. I’m taller and muscular/lean. I got a medium and wished I’d got a large for length but then i wondered how long the crotch area would be... is there a tall fit maybe for a longer length??? That might solve the issue better. They’re comfortable but i look to dorky in them to care if they’re comfy.  So... sorry guys. Ya missed it on these pants."
1.0,Falls out.
1.0,"If I could give them less than one star, I would. They broke as I was putting them on for the first time. Really dissapointed."
1.0,"Earrings arrived broken, had to return."
1.0,This dress was flat and tiny with no movement. The breasts would but stay closed and I couldn't even wear it. Also super short
1.0,These are not as large as they seem in the picture on the model.
1.0,"I saw this necklace and thought it pretty so I bought it.  It was delivered and I was very happy with it.  Well that was until the chains all look tarnished not the gold colored as received and on the Amazon purchase site.  I have had it only a few months, never worn it in the shower or did anything to make it look tarnished.  I am past the return date so I have to keep it.  Also it tangles up all the time. To recap: You’ll be sorry if you buy it for two reasons 1. It looks tarnished after just a few short months and cheap just from regular wear. 2. It tangles all the time and you will spend an exorbitant amount of time trying to untangle. Do yourself a favor and don’t buy."
1.0,"My daughter loves Minnie Mouse. I thought this seemed like a good deal, and now I know why. It was likely meant to be worn once. It ripped after one time and the huge hole is not fixable! I guess you get what you pay for, here."
1.0,Upon arrival the watch looked good. After wearing it for one hour it stopped working. The second hand gets stuck and stops. After looking further I realized the inner bezel that is for the second time zone is loose and moves around under the crystal. Next problem is the vendor (not Amazon) will not allow me to return it because I took the plastic off and wore it. Then the manufacture is garbage as well and told me it costs $28 to evaluate it and based on what I described it would not be covered under warranty. This watch is a total waste of time and money because of it's poor quality and lack of respectable customer service. Do not buy a Technomarine at any cost.
1.0,Fell apart in several pieces like it was made of plastic
1.0,"Almost impossible to unclasp, then won't reclasp because the groove is too small. I managed to get one earring out of all of them unhooked and rehooked, got one more unhooked but not rehooked once I put it on, and the others I couldn't even get open! Such a waste of money"
1.0,Do not buy! I repeat do not buy!<br />This is very cheaply made hoodie. It definitely feels like Halloween costume material and should be sold as one. This is not I was expecting at all! I bought this for my son and I will be returning this item. I wouldn't even give this one star for how this cost. Geez!
1.0,"I like the mask, but it was done upside down..."
1.0,The fabric is good but the design isn't. Dress is big on the top. Pocket is not useful because things falls out when you sit. I had to resew the top and the small hole on the poket.
1.0,"I filled it with C oil, then tried to use it weeks later. When I push the button, nothing comes out. I do not see contact info for the manufacturer anywhere, so I can not inquire about the problem."
1.0,The ruffle is nothing like the image (far flatter and  less material in general) and the material is very thin. I had to reorder this because one came falling apart. I shoulda have not reordered because I got one wear out of it before it was done. Oh well. I call stuff like this disposable clothing. Def get what I paid for.
1.0,The posted picture is bigger in size than the actual product. Disappointed
1.0,"Didn't honor the prime claim for shipping, got re ones that weren't prime first . Order 4 pair 2 with prime and 2 regular shipping. Didn't honor the 2 prime orders"
1.0,"The fabric is very soft & they fit fine before the first wash.  After the first wash, shrunk so much in length, but you get what you pay for...  One review said you had to be 4'1&#34; to wear these after they were washed & he was right... Keep in mind I am a large man & was trying to find undershirts that didn't cost so much for 4x, maybe smaller sizes would be oK???"
1.0,It was dirty
1.0,"I'd written a review a bit ago giving a higher rating but it was premature. I wasn't expecting the best quality, it's a large pack for a ridiculously low price, but I was expecting some general quality - this has none. Every piece falls apart, falls out, doesn't tighten and consistently breaks. I've swallowed 2 tongue ring balls (once while eating pizza, the other while drinking iced tea), lost countless ends on my other piercings (I haven't a clue how, when or where) and have had more ends crumble without even touching them (specifically the colored ones). You'd think any company would put some effort into their product but it's clear the material used is as wasteful as the machines making it. The only reason they put so many in the package is because you'll go through them all just to keep your piercing(s) open. Sadly I'm not the only one with this issue, I shared the bag with my Mom and brother and they've experienced the exact same problems! Needless to say it was a waste of money, lesson learned. Don't make the same mistake!"
1.0,It does not lay flat like in the picture. It poofs out around the waist. Very unflattering.
1.0,Hand washed dress and hem completely unraveled and the white area is now spotted with pink dye.
1.0,"The fabric is a wrinkled mess that looks bad. No, it is not a crinkle linen or gauze where that level of wrinkled is “the look”. ALso the whole of fit was loose and flowy except for the sleeves, which were super tight. The one I got was cut very disproportionate."
1.0,do not buy .. not high-quality .... I'm sorry .. that I was spending money for it .. do not buy ..
1.0,Came broken and wouldn't refund unless I shipped it back which is not worth its cost. I wasn't expecting the highest quality based on price but I was expecting it to arrive unbroken
1.0,"These had short, thick posts that begin with a screw and end with some sharp pointed stars. I was hoping these would match the necklace I have but alas, they will not work."
1.0,"Poor, thin see-through material. Poor construction design. Very short, fit like an awkward shirt. Do not recommend. Very small. (Ordered size 12-14 . I'm usually a 10-12)"
1.0,Extremely tacky!  Shame on those &#34;fans&#34; for making a joke out of this.
1.0,"This product looks nothing like shown. This item had black fragments falling out over everything.  Just poor material, poor everything probably the worst purchase I have ever made  !!"
1.0,Ordered medium and fit like an XS.
1.0,The lens fell out
1.0,Nice material but way too small. I wear medium
1.0,"The pendant is great, till you flip it over and see the big dumb words “fire and blood” as if anyone WANTS to wear a billboard! We all know what the Targaryen slogan is, we sure don’t need it written on jewelry. If they got rid of the words, it wouldn’t look so cheap! This reminds me of something I would buy when I was like 10 years at Uncle Bobs Flea Market. Also the chain they sent with it doesn’t match the pendant at all, and is super cheap and flimsy. I’m very disappointed that they hid the words in the picture, kinda like false advertising. I don’t recommend this item at all."
1.0,"While wearing for the first time, one of the turquoise gems fell off."
1.0,"Just a cheap baby girl outfit. The material is awful, the pants are sewn weird and the bows on top slides right out of the tie."
1.0,Way to big. Can’t wear
1.0,These are WAAAAAAAAY too small and not even worth the hassle of returning. Highly disappointed. Probably won't be buying from this seller again
1.0,Runs small. Very thin material. You can see right through it.
1.0,Should of ordered them in Queen size.
1.0,"I ordered XL and they didn't even fit my wife, who weighs 145 pounds. Did they send me a women's or child's size?"
1.0,Super tight. Super small.  Super bright.  Super cheap looking.  I returned it.
1.0,The graphic is printed way to big on to the material. So you dont get the effect it's supposed to have. You cant even tell what its supposed to be when you have it on
1.0,very cheap materal scare to wash never by again
1.0,"My search was in &#34;plus size&#34; got XLARGE, which was largest size they had. I wear large in tops and 14/16 in dresses. Plus I like a loose fit It was skin tight, looked awful on me. Back it went"
1.0,They look adorable but unfortunately can’t get the zipper down to see how/if they even fit. These are definitely going back.
1.0,Bought these for my baby shower. They did not match my turquoise dress because they are actually dark see through green. One earring broke after 2 uses.
1.0,Super cute but the ties are literally paper thin!
1.0,My daughter and I both have sensitive ears.  These earrings are plastic but still irritated both of our ears.
1.0,I’m at the airport about to depart for the first time using this luggage and the wheel brook off.  My vacation hasn’t even started yet and I will be 15 days with a broken wheel!
1.0,"Falls off your ears, not warm, cheaply made. Do not purchase."
1.0,Ordered 3 different colors and the white one I received was not the correct one ordered.  Very cheaply made and thin see through material.
1.0,Turned color in three days.
1.0,"See through, small"
1.0,"These are so thin you can see through them in a dimly lit room. Unless you like wearing legging under your pants, these likely aren't what you are looking for. You definitely get what you paid for with these. I bought 2 separate kinds in different colors with the same issue. Just wow!"
1.0,"These are nice quality but the only thing they may work on is thin upper ear cartilage or finger nails.. The opening is so small they they will not work on earlobes, noses, eyebrows, nipples, lips or anything human sized. Unless you have super human strength or a stretcher to pull them open (they are strong) I would not recommend these. I am now stuck with a bag full of pretty metal rings as I lost the bag with the bar code during the Christmas morning mess and cannot return them. Bummer."
1.0,This is not a flattering dress at all. It is also not long enough. It falls slightly above ankles. Just not cute at all. The material is very thin and cheaply made. I will be returning.
1.0,"Do not buy this bra!  The cup are not properly shaped therefore, it does not fit the breast right.<br />The material is scratchy and iritating.  I did not make it 5 minutes before taking this bra off"
1.0,This item does not do what it is supposed to do. I am not buying anything from China anymore. None of their amulets work.
1.0,The strap frayed and broke first time it was worn. Returned it.
1.0,Too small not what I thought it be
1.0,I did not like this dress.  The fabric was too thin and slightly see-thru
1.0,The material is stretchy so the dress was to big and it just did not fit well
1.0,Very fake looking. You won’t be fooling anyone with these
1.0,Cork platform is made of tape the started pealing after I wore them once. The Velcro clasp are very cheap made. Faux leather is so thin.
1.0,If I pull it up to cover the top of my boobs the bottom are showing if I pull it down my boobs are falling out. Also this bra gives 0 support for bigger boobs which is what I thought it was for
1.0,Barely comes up past my calf. If it was make with a more elastic material I think it would be perfect but as it is it does not fit.
1.0,"My wife bought this purse and didn't even transfer everything from her old purse to this purse yet.  But 30 days later, the strap broke.  It came un-stitched.  The deadline to return the item was two days prior to the strap breaking.  Don't waste your money."
1.0,Very blurry underwater.
1.0,"Update:<br />These started flaking and one of the sides pulled out WHILE I WAS WALKING! I wear size 8 and ordered size 8, true to size.  These sandals fit like a glove. They are very comfortable and look pretty. The bottom is textured to prevent slipping and the feet cushion is soft and feels like a cloud! There is textured pattern that doesn’t bother the bottom of my feet but it provides a good grip so my feet doesn’t slide forward. The platform is great size for every day comfortable wear. They add some height without adding discomfort to my ankles. I am so glad I got these cuties!"
1.0,Been had again by China. Ridiculous.
1.0,"The material is not like the picture, I should have known and looked to see there was  only one review.  I did not realize this when I bought three matching dresses that I cannot return becasue the shipping is way too expensive.  So beware of only one review.  I think they must have the picture and try to copy it with cheap material."
1.0,Item looks and feel very cheap
1.0,"This is not cotton, but some sort of polyester.  The logo looks nothing like the picture and you can see burn marks around it where it was &#34;ironed?&#34; on.  Terrible product.  DO NOT BUY!<br /><br />I've bought dozens and dozens of products from Amazon.  This is the first one I've ever had a problem with."
1.0,"If you are willing to overlook the size marked on the shirt, these are a decent t-shirt to wear with leggings. Believe the other reviews that state these run small. They run really, really, really small! I am 5'7&#34;, usually wear a large. I ordered both an extra large and a 2 XL based on other reviews. Ended up sending them back to exchange for a 3XL. Which fits the same as a large from places like Loft. Soft material, good color choices, good length for leggings. I'd give it higher stars if the sizing wasn't so wonky!<br /><br />Update with photo after 1 month wear:<br />This does not wash well at all! the front and back no longer line up. It as is as if a corkscrew is at work on the bottom half of the garment. The seams are twisting so not only is the garment uncomfortable, it now looks sloppy. While I thought it was a bargain at the time, with only 3 wears it has become and expensive rag. Sadly, I thought I loved it so bought more than one color. The seam issue has happened with each one."
1.0,"One star for cuteness, zero stars for quality. Brand new water show had a hole upon taking it out of the package."
1.0,"Just go to dollar tree and get sunglasses. Way better quality than these. Fell off my face when I leaned forward, some are so hard to open and feels like they are going to break. They are worth no where near $10....I'd say they should be $2. What a waste"
1.0,"Not strong at all, the rip."
1.0,Ordered for my son and we did not like it. The gray is a weird sweat shirt material and the logo looks like it would peel off very easily.
1.0,I was charged for this item and I returned it
1.0,Returned. Too small and the slit was all the way up my leg
1.0,Very uncomfortable product. The bust area is oddly shape. Doesn’t shape your boobs. It’s sticking out. The width is uncomfortable and digging on my ribs.
1.0,Didn't last a week.
1.0,they are TINY and the backs screw on. not the normal sized studs you think
1.0,"Not at all like the picture! 2x IS NOT A 2X, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS U R SKINNY!!!"
1.0,Nothing flattering about it add a belt to it
1.0,"The top is completely different than the bottom! What a scratchy material , skin doesn't breathe at all, the colors are not as bright as they show. Disappointed !"
1.0,It was already broken when I received the package.
1.0,"Not as expected will never wear it, plan on refunding"
1.0,The bra cups are flappy and the whole swimsuit just fits cheaply. The material isn't as thin and sleek as the picture portrays.
1.0,"They did not really look like the picture, the red was more of a pink magenta type of color and I would say that should be a lower price for that quality of the glasses."
1.0,"When I was buying the bag, I didn't realize it would be so tiny. When the envelope arrived, I was perplexed. Oh, well, I am using it, and it is nice. Too much $$$ for a bag though."
1.0,Why bother to buy clothes from Amazon unless it's made in the USA. Anything made in China or outside of the USA will NOT fit an American buyer. What a waste of time returning SO MANY amazon clothes products.
1.0,Tiny and super cheap more like a choker
1.0,The shirts are short they are not long like description says!!
1.0,"I do not like these. I don't usually give a one star review to items, I can usually find some redeeming quality but eh.... These rolled like crazy because they were not tall enough for me to wear like shown in the picture and I'm 5'8&#34;. Every time my knee bent, they rolled. They are overpriced for what you really get. Sad these didn't work. I really need another layer for winter."
1.0,"Couldn't get it to fit a 44mm Samsung Watch 4. The package says Classic on it, so I may have been sent the wrong item."
1.0,"The picture shows a silver belt buckle, but in reality it is black. Very unhappy with the misleading information."
1.0,No flexable point . Burnt my eyes .
1.0,Theses are incredibly small I didn’t expect them to be as small as a nickel but the return process isn’t worth it I’ll throw them in our craft box for hopefully a idea later but definitely not useful for my current project
1.0,"The sunglasses look exactly like the picture which I loved, but the first time I put them on my head the side screw popped off and snapped the plastic which held it in place. I tried sending them back for another pair, but the man I spoke with was very rude and even laughed at me on the phone. I was very disappointed because I order often from amazon and have never had this kind of experience before. I would love to get another pair but would hate to go through the hassle of returning them and dealing with rude customer service."
1.0,"The  glasses  I got were NOT, I repeat, NOT polarized.  I contacted the seller and they said they were having trouble with the manufacturer and never offered to replace them, only that I should try another tint.  This is a bogus seller and no one should trust them."
1.0,This says gloves and it is only one pair.  What a rip off don’t buy
1.0,Connector sticks out past the edges.  Verified I ordered right size.
1.0,Cheap and shiny material.
1.0,Bought because looked sparkly like glitter and it’s a cheap quality shirt with cheap iron on decal
1.0,I wore it for less than a week and the stone fell off. =\
1.0,"The only lens that fit was the one that was on the frame when it was received.  All the others were cut slightly different, but enough so that they would not fit in the groove on the frame.  I returned it for a refund."
1.0,"The picture taken in the ad is taken of a ""Real Morgan Coin Ring"" (a Morgan Silver Dollar forged into a wearable ring) but what I got was a fake plastic mold painted in cheap chrome.  You won't get anything close to what the image above looks like.  I bought five (5) of these figuring just for the silver alone it was worth it and the day I got them I chucked them in the trash I was so mad!!!  Don't be fooled into buying from this seller.  I got taken by a couple other coin rings that were made with plastic and chrome (not a real silver coin) like advertised.  Ugggggggg I'm still so mad!"
1.0,"It's fits my daughter who is 13, definitely was not a women's large, which I thought I was getting , it's more like a youth size is what I received"
1.0,Do not buy.
1.0,"These are fantastic, buttery soft and opaque... however the plus size really will fit up to ""maybe a 14"" if you are lucky.  They really are nice but sadly i'm gifting them to a smaller friend!"
1.0,It won't stay open by itself. I have to hold it open so I won't get wet
1.0,Literally not what I thought it was gunna be. To me it looks nothing like it does in the picture. I do not recommend this dress. It's more of a silk material and looks like a night gown
1.0,"Pros: great fullness at the bottom<br />Cons: top boning is significantly smaller than the second giving it a unpleasant shape<br />Worst of all, it is severely asymmetrical not because of the boning, but because of the fabric construction.<br />Now to decide to send it back or repurpose the boning for a different project..."
1.0,Chain broke before I could wear it.
1.0,The piece broke off the key chain and it got ran over found it luckly . It broke my heart thats its ruin
1.0,Poor quality. Doesn’t even feel like a sweatshirt
1.0,Ordered 2. First was a large. Wayyyyyyy too small for my chest. Second was an XXL. Still wayyyyyy too small for anyone with a chest. These run SUPER small in the bust ladies. I actually think the XXL was smaller than the first one. I usually wear a size 12.
1.0,Dress is too thin and see thru. Great design but I wouldn’t be comfortable wearing it.
1.0,"This swimsuit is not made for plus sized women its misleading  terrible, not at all as discribed"
1.0,I returned it was $8.00 for just a few strings to tie around your ankle. Now worth it .
1.0,It’s not as simple as “just go up a size” - the sizing on these seems completely random.  Wasted my money
1.0,"Super thin!!!  It is advertised as a winter coat, and it is more of a fall jacket."
1.0,Look nothing like I expected
1.0,Leather was not really very good
1.0,return policy  is not good and you will be stock with item that is too big
1.0,I’m not sure what type of working out these are meant for but don’t run in these with anything in your pockets they will hit you in the nuts with a light jog<br /><br />That being said this item showed up not as pictured....<br />-The liner that is described and pictures as black tight to the thigh and has a cell phone pocket<br />-What shows up is really baggy and with a swimsuit liner that is meant for you to wear an adult dipper
1.0,"I could not wear this bra for a full day. My breasts were overflowing in every direction. There is no support, and it itched. I will be giving these away."
1.0,Way too small didn't fit at all
1.0,It's thicker than the backing.
1.0,"I purchased this winder, within 3 weeks I started to noticed round shaped scratched on my brand new gold Rolex. The scratches were all the same exact shape, grouped next to each other, and shaped perfectly round. I then one day while wearing the Rolex, noticed when I put it back, the other watch which was in its place, now had the same marks. I then looked on the winder cradle which holds the pillow, and there was a screw sticking out. As my watch was winding all night, this screw was under the clasp of the band. My gold Rolex clasp which is brand new, now has round scratches all over!!!! I will be buying a Wolf Winder for sure!!!!!!!!!"
1.0,Thought try would be larger. I will give to<br />Granddaughter for 13th birthday in May!
1.0,definitely meant for a kid ..
1.0,I could have gotten something nicer from the dollar tree! Product arrive and the bow and skull were unglued from the headband.
1.0,The cups arent snug & dont hug or hold the weight of a 38J cup. The straps r joke...
1.0,"I am so disappointed in this product. The size chart says a two XL is a 49 to 51. As you can see this is 23.5, or 47 inches wide. Not even close!<br /><br />And there is a graphic on the back of the shirt as well, which I really like. But sadly I have to return this product because it is teeny tiny!"
1.0,"received the item on time, however it was a gift for a 16yo requested to be delivered to him and received one for an 18yo plus quality not the same as in the picture, does not recommend this item."
1.0,Shirt was a smaller sized T Shirt and was tight.
1.0,The neck is very very tight. And the back is very long. I am 5’4 and it was past my knees
1.0,"I rarely write a negative review, I've been lucky and have actually liked almost everything I order.<br />This? Not even close.<br />First of all, I don't feel it looks much like what was pictured. In product picture, the pockets, inner sleeves and front side with buttons don't appear to be so off color with rest of material. Secondly, the material used on those attributes have the look of crepe paper, gross. I don't do frilly or anything remotely close to it. The material the ""cardigan"" is made of feels overly synthetic...and to be honest, flame retardant. It is not at all as soft and cushy as picture would lead you to believe. It is lightweight though, I will give it that much.<br />This may be right up someone else's fashion alley, but it is miles from mine.<br />I would have liked to remove myself from my feelings on it to at least write a review for simply what it is, but as the kids say, ""I can't even."" This is a hard pass for me and will be returning."
1.0,I would give this less than one star if possible. I ordered one size larger than what I actually wear after reading that they run slightly small. That was an understatement because I couldn't even fit my leg in it further than my knee. The material was thin. This is just a terrible product.
1.0,"This is definitely not a women's size. I couldn't even pull it past my elbows. I asked for a refund and the company was nice and gave me one. I can say that they didn't want me to ship it back, so I was curious to see if it would fit my daughter who is 9 and 80 lbs. It fit her perfectly. So would be cute for a little girl, or a very small woman. This is definitely  not true to size."
1.0,Received dress with big black stain on the chest
1.0,"Demasiado pequeño , mala calidad de tela"
1.0,"I GOT 2 COLORS CAUSE THEY LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL!!! BOTH CAME TOGETHER, AND BOTH ARE DAMAGED! THEY'RE BENT!!"
1.0,"Don’t waste your $$$! The very first time I wore it, 4 of the 4 charms fell off within an hour. Terribly disappointing!! Not happy!!!"
1.0,Shrunk up when washef
1.0,junk ... pay junk price get junk merchandise
1.0,"The product is fine. However, I received these tear drop pendants with glass domes,  and the dome is much smaller than the pendant tray. I emailed them and it seemed like they don't understand my problem. I even sent in a picture to show that the glass dome is too small. So now instead of 32 pendants, I  only have 27 that are usable.<br /><br />I order a second time, giving them a second chance, and cabochons had imperfections, and scratches, making almost half unusable. I will not be ordering again. Waste of money."
1.0,"This Bra fit perfectly in the front and I guess you could say perfectly in the back if you want it to look like you have lady jugs on your back!  The strap on the back is just too small and with all the support, it just squeezes your back too hard and you get back cleavage, not a great look!  I returned it!"
1.0,too small for an adult
1.0,I didn’t get the dress in the picture. I got a red dress but a different style. It was a disappointing purchase.
1.0,"Torso too short , order size up"
1.0,"So I took it out of the package, washed it delicate and air dried only to notice one of the poms on top had popped off. Hadn’t even had a chance to try it on my daughter. Cute though."
1.0,Too thin and fits weird
1.0,Don’t waste your money. The jeans get really wrinkly when you wear them. They don’t look nice at all...waste of money
1.0,I have received both pair of these! But it only says one pair was delivered
1.0,"It's so small it looks like it would fit a young girl. The crystals are nice, but geez! Not everyone has wrists the size of a half dollar."
1.0,The bra broke when I washed it :(
1.0,"While it looks like a good idea, this product suffers from poor design. The shield does not pull down over the bill to protect the face; it acts only to lengthen the bill. If the shield is attached under the bill, it rests against the face and fogs up on the first breath. The items came tightly folded and wrapped in a plastic envelope that permanently misshaped the shield, further impairing the design. When I requested a return and refund, the seller requested photographic “proof” of my complaint. My advice if you are considering this is DO NOT BUY — they don’t work to shield the face and getting your money back is a hassle (if it’s possible at all)."
1.0,"Cannot breath, not a good material"
1.0,"NECKLACE ALL BROKEN , NOT WORTH RETURNING, EARRINGS CAME TOGETHER , THANKS....please send another necklace"
1.0,This is a piece of crap. I have a daughter in tears bc it doesn’t work and it’s needed for tomorrow. 😡
1.0,"Had for only a couple months, and the crystal has already came out of the holder, and one of the chakra crystals fell out  :(((("
1.0,very see through like completely see though.
1.0,"I have this dress in black and love it, it is comfortable and fits perfectly.  I bought 2 more in colored designs and they are so tight in the bust I can't wear them."
1.0,My mom really liked it
1.0,"Very pretty, but it fell apart in less than a week."
1.0,Classic example of you get what you pay for.  Really cheap looking.  Not worth the trouble to return but it is going in the goodwill pile
1.0,No compression whatsoever! This is worthless. Overpriced tank tops.
1.0,"They were cute, but ripped easily and were in the trash right after Easter 😕"
1.0,"To small for the daith. Not worth returning after paying shipping, going to save for a helix, we'll see, but u bought it for my daith."
1.0,My daughter was able to pull them off
1.0,I bought this watch for my husband birthday. The self winder broke in the first 3weeks. Amazon changed there return policy and I can no longer return it. Would like to get ahold of seller to see if there is a manufacturer warranty.  Do not recommend this product.
1.0,"I was excited for these pants. They looked fantastic in the photo!<br /><br />Once I actually RECEIVED them, I was extremely disappointed. They were made of thin, cheap-feeling fabric and felt like they would fall apart if you put them in the washing machine. Although I followed the size chart, they were about two sizes too small.<br /><br />I found ZERO redeeming qualities for these pants."
1.0,Very cheaply made. Nothing like the picture
1.0,Does not fit stated serial number on watch; this one requires screws and not rods.
1.0,Las huellas de perro que trae incrustadas no se visualizan
1.0,Not happy about these leggings at all. They are way too small and isn’t giving me any option to return to get the right size. Really upset about this. I planned on ordering more from this company but won’t be after not being able to get my right size.
1.0,Garbage waste of money
1.0,Its hurts after a while didnt like it at all... hurts alot
1.0,"I have only have this backpack a little over a month, used it once and the zipper already broke. loved this backpack and thought it was good quality but not after it breaking so fast. hoping I can get a replacement, but as of now my review stays the same. Don't purchase unless u plan on buying a new backpack shortly after !!!"
1.0,Bands are of cheap quality. One even fell apart when I tried to use it.
1.0,"The band was hard to get on with the tool provided. I didn’t wear it very long until the band broke. Took it to a Fix-It place and they repaired it, but that didn’t last long either. I loved the style and got lots of compliments for the short time I got to wear it. I wish it was made better and stronger because I really loved it."
1.0,"The product wasnt the size i asked for, very bad"
1.0,"I will never buy anything else with CCEnterprises ever again unless you change your name and get me fooled unknowingly. When a customer orders an item with a 3-5 days normal delivery speed, they expect to receive the item in that time; they do not want to be given a bogus tracking number from which they cannot retrieve any information; they do not want to wait after the last estimated delivery day to write an inquiry and find out days later that the item wasn't shipped yet and that they have to wait another week or so to receive the product...weeks after it was supposed to get here already! people buy stuffs prompted by a specific need and receiving them extremely late is a betrayal of trust, a scam no matter what excuses you may have, I don't take any excuses! you take my money, you deliver! By the way, the pair of sunglasses I received is of bad quality and useless, one of the nose pad is pointing towards my eye because the pad arm is crooked...it doesn't seem to have been inspected before packaging in transparent plastic bag and shipping...I'll just put it in the trash and move on so that I can spare myself the predicament and huge emotional distress of dealing with you!You don't deserve even one star!!!"
1.0,Whoever made this didn't think. The shirt has a weird cotton feel to it and it just didn't fit. It fit my friend though so she bought it from me. lol
1.0,"It came broken, I just opened it, and the main necklace (reason for purchase) was broken"
1.0,LOL! The socks wouldn't even cover my heel they were so small. They might pass for footies on a small foot. I sent them back for an Amazon credit.
1.0,"Totally disappointed. This looks like an old kitchen floral curtain. I thought I ordered black, but green come instead ( which would have been ok). The green on the picture is bright and vibrant, what I received was a dusty ashy green. Now I have to fund another outfit for my 40th Birthday pictures."
1.0,The fabric on this dress was too thick. I ordered it thinking it was a thin flowing fabric instead it was thick and stretchy.
1.0,Have had difficulty using the locks???
1.0,"Not african, too small"
1.0,"These look nothing like the advertised pictures. They look like big, whitish-pink plastic circles with flecks of color. No way would anyone believe they are real fire opals. As soon as I tried them on, my earlobes began itching and got severely irritated. Poor quality and very tacky earrings. Returning ASAP."
1.0,"I saw this watch for the price listed and immediately wanted it. It's a really good looking watch in the pictures, and it looked the same in person once I got it.<br />However, upon receiving the item, I realized how small it looked on my wrist. To my knowledge, it didn't say how big the face was and the pictures made it look larger than it is. That alone was reason for me to return it, but it's not the reason for my low rating.<br />First of all, when I tried to adjust the band, it was very hard to get it to cooperate with me (and I've used this style of band before). Maybe it was just my unit but it was quite difficult to get it to clasp onto the band to lock into place.<br />After putting it on and getting it sized right, I noticed how cheap it felt. It's very lightweight and the face is made of a cheap feeling plastic. It's not expensive so I didn't expect the same quality as you'd expect from a nicer watch but I expected more than that. It honestly felt cheaper than a 15 dollar watch from walmart.<br />But the biggest reason for my low rating was that the watch wouldn't tick unless I wound the stem up fully and held it there. As soon as I let go, it would stop ticking. I will admit, when it was ticking it looked pretty cool with the gears turning visibly, but it only worked for as long as I held the stem in.<br /><br />P.S. Several people have commented about the ""Incorrect Roman Numerals for 9"" but it's not actually wrong, it's just cut off by the decorative circle that goes over it. If you look closely you can see where the X continues on past the intersection of the lines. It's kind of an odd choice to just cut it off instead of making the circle smaller or the Roman Numerals smaller, but it's not wrong."
1.0,The one size fits most is for someone who is a small or medium. Very nice material tho. Had to return it.
1.0,Stone fell out of the cross the day it arrived. I should have sent this back. Elastic was too large and shows in one of the bracelets.
1.0,This order is taking 2 months. Do not order
1.0,I'm not thrilled with these sunglasses. They are too big for my face.
1.0,This dress has a beautiful lace on the outside the color is bright yellow very sexy. Dress is size 8 .
1.0,Does not have UPF 50+
1.0,"Muy lindos pero no son antiresbalantes...el niño en la primera postura se cayó en el parque de agua! Deben tener cuidado, yo no se los pondre mas."
1.0,"Not only was the shirt excessively small, but the pizza is printed off center from the pocket.  I purchased two, and they were both printed poorly.  Returned."
1.0,"Chinese cheap material, a 2XL is actually a small or a medium, buyer beware do not buy"
1.0,"Giving this umbrella 1 star is being generous! Obviously bought this for travel, used it once & it jammed! Couldn’t get it to close without force! Sorry but it’s not worth the purchase. Extremely disappointed."
1.0,Don’t buy. Not even half of the rings worked.
1.0,"Nice band, but would not stay attached to the Gear. We ended up returning this band as an exchange was not offered."
1.0,"Never got to wear it. The strap came off because the flimsy, round strap holder in the back snapped in half and broke and the strap with it. Not a happy camper."
1.0,Like the style of this dress but ...the material was cheap...
1.0,They fit good but do not keep your toes Warm even with socks over them
1.0,Maybe for a child. Terrible
1.0,"Perfect in size , great  until 2 days of wearing. Bought for my fiance & became ""linty "" real quick & color bled pretty easily."
1.0,This top is too short and not tailored as picture indicates. Flimsy fabric! Does not do anything for a persons figure. :(
1.0,No proper instructions.  Difficult to apply. Did not stick properly. Was a complete waste of money and effort for me. Such a shame because they are very cute.
1.0,"La tela de muy mala calidad, todo el vestido es un asco"
1.0,Poor material. Too much material - the skirt was too full
1.0,Tight and not vibrant colors
1.0,"The filtration is not only ineffective but I find it very annoying since it's graded from nearly zero at the bottom of the lens to too dark at the top. I can never get a view that is all one density when looking toward the normal (middle) of the lens. I learned from this that there is some small value in a yellow-tinted lens for reducing blue haze and glare, but that unless that tint is consistent and at the right density for me, glasses of this type are useless."
1.0,"Wow! I am disappointed! I am 5’8” and 165 lbs. I carry most of my weight in my butts and hips, & I have a small chest. If you have small breasts- well, keep looking! This is NOT the suit for you! I got a size large, which fit my butt. However, the top part looked like I had wings next to my armpits. Additionally, the midsection part was very loose and baggy- almost like it wasn’t sown correctly. I thought about sewing it to fix it for my large butt and small, but the middle part was so baggy and strange in conjunction with the wings on the breast- just no way it would work. Big butt, small chest = don’t buy"
1.0,Post broke after a little over a month.
1.0,The small size was not really small and its extremely uncomfortable.
1.0,"I bought 3 of these off the Siren Song website.  NONE of them worked well--as another viewer mentioned, I could scream louder than these!  Also they start charging you a monthly membership fee of $8.95 that you never signed up for.  The emails from SS went to Spam so I didn't realize what those charges were for a few months.<br /><br />AMAZON, you're better than this--take them off your product list!"
1.0,Poor quality. I Could not give this as a gift. It's a piece of junk.
1.0,"If they came with the smaller “O” rings like it was supposed too, I bet it would have worked great😣 how irritating ."
1.0,NO NO NO! Material is sooooo horrible. Not anything like shown in picture. Definitely size up!
1.0,Ordered a size XL...gave it to my 9 year old granddaughter...fits her perfectly.
1.0,This tank top is very short in length.  I bought an XL.  I'm 5' 10&#34; 190 lbs. muscular build.  Returned.
1.0,Product was stained and way too small.
1.0,Broke in 1 week
1.0,Through the past few years...I have just hit repurchase...was always happy with these sunglasses until this last pair.... These newest glasses are much cheaper feeling than previous pairs I have received. Looking through the lenses the world is slightly out of focus! The first time I went to clean them with a cloth one of the lenses partially came out!!! The prior glasses were nice. The ones I just received are BAD.!.!.!
1.0,I bought this for a friend. She wore it everyday for a couple weeks. Within that time it broke. We repaired it. She started wearing it again and it broke in 2 different places. The charm fell off and so did the Pearl's. I wouldnt recommend this.
1.0,This product is laughable.  I bought a 4x and it is that of an extra-extra small girl.  Like a child.  I'm a size extra small even though I bought it for a 4x male.... it was too tight on me!!!!!  Trust me.
1.0,"Highly annoyed. This was advertised as a SIX pack and only received FIVE. I was splitting this with my boyfriend but its an uneven number.. its apparent whoever is packing these cannot handle counting.<br /><br />Also, like others have said, not cotton like advertised as well.<br /><br />Would not reccomend. What a rip off."
1.0,"Worst tie I ever bought, Very wrinkled and the colors are much more vivid than shown in the picture.  I'm sorry that I can't give it a zero star rating!!!"
1.0,"The tail is awesome but it was VERY DISAPPOINTING,(ESPECIALLY TO A 4 YEAR OLD) that there was NO ears in our package! Thanks alot"
1.0,Ring destroyed my eye cartilage piercing. The clasp would not stay closed and caused constant wear on the piercing. My ear became infected and I developed a large blood blister on the back of my ear by piercing. It has been 2 weeks and the blister is just starting to go away. Do not recommend.
1.0,advertived as a $100 watch. It has alwayes been a $10 watch seller is a LIER
1.0,"I wear a 2xl, sometimes can wear a xl.  Ordered this in 3xl for work and could not pull it up over my hips.  Had to return.  Not as flexible as shown."
1.0,"They rip real easy, box was shredded and no good. If it wasnt cause they arrived the same day i needed em, I would of returned em. Not recommended. Its better to just pay the extra $10 at BJ's"
1.0,Received wrong case my daughter is completely disappointed and leaves in 2days so no time for a return. Completely let down.
1.0,"This bag should not be considered an “Extra Large” anything, I have just over 200 pins and took up 4 of the 5 pages with no room left to spare on them it should at least 2 inches in both directions"
1.0,no muy
1.0,This dress could’ve been really cute if the neckline wasn’t uneven and it didn’t shrink when you washed it. Don’t waste your money
1.0,"I bought this because I wanted something that would like nice with my work cloths. As other have stated, its very small. I have a small wrist so fit isn't the problem although I would prefer it a little larger. My problem is I cant open the stupid cage that the fitbit dongle goes in. It comes with a small plastic guitar pic but I have no idea how to get it open. Im not wasting my time trying to figure it out. If its too hard to open and close then its not worth it for me since it has to be charged every few days. Save your time and money and skip this."
1.0,"(I generally wear a 2X but went up a size as it recommended.) There isn't much to like about this shirt. It's peasant style fitting is too small in the chest (DD) then it pillows out like a tree skirt Yet the shirt is somehow too short despite the enormous amounts of fabric,  and I am a very short person (5'2). I can't imagine how it would fit on someone tall or even normal height. The arms are billowing and scrunched up at mid wrist I feel like I have been haphazardly hit on the head by an un-motivated fairy godmother. I guess the color is pretty but the fabric feels like something purchased at a pop up Halloween store."
1.0,Really terrible fit - and when I finally got it right the snap thingy broke. Quality = 0. Wish they had negative stars.  No way to put plastic back on - tore when it came off. Bet a man designed this :/
1.0,"returning it, it was nothing like it looks or what I expected."
1.0,"Really wanted to love these leggings. Super cute, vibrant color and nice material. After having for only a month there is a huge running tear in the back of the leggings. I have only washed twice, and hung to dry both times. Very disappointed."
1.0,The latch constantly keeps coming open. Such a pain in the rear trying to wear this without constantly fixing it. I would not recommend this at all
1.0,The style was cute.  But the size was way off runs extremely small.
1.0,I liked that out covered you from the train. I did not like the fact that it kept getting pulled into my tires and about cooked me out. Not a safe product.
1.0,"it run to small. I got it for my son, he use large so I order an XL but is was to small."
1.0,"Ordered xl, which is my normal size but it was to small."
1.0,"It was missing All the accessories . It runs extremely small. My daughter is med /large  and I order the 2xl. And it was still really hard to close. Thankfully, I'm a bit Handy and I was able to do some adjustment and it fit better. The item has no stretch at all.  And if you have a booth the shorts are going to fit very snug. I think, for the price is really foolish not to get the right size or all items that are suppose to be included.  Unfortunately we can't wait for return or replace as it won't get here on time.  Very awful experience."
1.0,Did not hold up very well.
1.0,listed in wrong category
1.0,This dress looks nothing like pictured. I  returned it.
1.0,Cheap and gets dirty very quickly.
1.0,Garbage... and that's where they ended up.
1.0,I purchased this with an Evie outfit as a Christmas present for my granddaughter.  Wrapped it without looking inside the velvet pouch.  The stone was loose in bag.  So she was upset to get a broken necklace.
1.0,Not leather. Very cheap. Not at all as described.
1.0,Didn't look right
1.0,I was so excited to have found skull sunglasses with bling and skulls and as soon as I saw these  HAD to have these. I waited for 2weeks and they came in. They looked so awesome wirh the rhinesones around the frames and 3D skulls on each frame. So I tried them on all excited and they would fit a child. They are very small and I can still see out of the botttom. Great for kids or very small headed adults.
1.0,its really long. i needed a shorter strap for my bag
1.0,"These were horrible. Out of the pack there was a perfume chemical smell so strong that my eyes watered. The smell did not dissipate after one quick workout where I tried them out. Rinsing also didn’t help. The smell also triggered an allergic reaction. The color is garish, the fabric thin and there isn’t any real grip to the leg band to keep in place. But honestly the smell was the deal breaker. I actually had to bag them separate from my trash and put outside."
1.0,ARTICULO DE MUY MALA CALIDAD.
1.0,Poor quatlity!
1.0,Design is horrible!
1.0,Bought a medium. Top fit but bottom was way too large. Bottom almost came to my chin. Not happy with this purchase. Didn't return only because I like the top and am going to use it with something else.
1.0,Awful scratchy material. Has no drap. Just looks like a big box. Not even good for lounging since it's so scratchy.
1.0,TOO LARGE SEND ME A NEW ONE
1.0,"The hoops are plastic, could never get the catch to lock.  One earring didn't even come closed and never did.  The ""pearls"" are dipped something or other, probably plastic.  I did keep them as I bought new findings and created my own earrings.  Just don't expect the ""real"" thing."
1.0,This broke in the first five minutes of wearing it. - my husband
1.0,These look great but they already have a hole and are past the return date. I would like a refund or replacement.
1.0,Too small and the material is not breathable.
1.0,My band didn’t even last two weeks before the edge ripped and my watch fell out. Disappointed because I love the look. Maybe mine was defective because my boyfriends is still ok but I had to go back to my old band.
1.0,Not what I was expecting. The material is not soft enough and needs ironing. It doesn’t look good on me.
1.0,The most terrible cut you could imagine the material feel so cheap and it's not styled anywhere near what the picture looks like epic fail 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
1.0,the picture is much better then the actual blouse. I could not get the buttons open so I tried to pull it over my head to try on. I couldn't even get it across my shoulders so I give up and am returning it. Normally I wear a medium and so ordered that. I find most products made in China do not run true to size. The fabric also seems cheap.
1.0,The tassel became unattached to the hook.
1.0,It was very tricky to hold the dishes with these gloves on. I really had to grip them to keep them from sliding out of my hand.
1.0,Boot had a HORRIBLE odor. It smelled poisonous. I returned immediately.
1.0,This was a piece of garbage. It broke the minute I took it out of the package. It’s cute but can’t even use it! Returned it and got a refund so I’m still searching for a good keychain that can hold all my keys.
1.0,Muy caro para ser un solo álbum
1.0,BAD MATERIAL
1.0,"My shoes fit snugly with the elastic laces in the eyelets provided by Nike. When I installed these fittings, the shoes were no longer a snug fit, and to that extent no longer comfortable. Overall, not any improvement but an impediment."
1.0,I wear earrings that don't come out. Though these would be a great addition to my ears. They tarnished and broke.
1.0,They heart my fit
1.0,[[VIDEOID:cb404198048275c4a5a294a33e04d58a]] They look old and dirty and tarnished.  You can see the glue on the inside of the tunnel where they glued the two pieces together.  I was going to give these as a Christmas gift but they look horrible compared to what is advertised.
1.0,This shoe did not fit well. hand to return the shoe.. On top of that I had to pay the postage to return the shoe. Insulted...I mean really I loved the look. Your charged postage to get the shoe and then your charged again to return the shoe. Would not deal with this company again.
1.0,Chain broke and could not fix grand daughter was upset
1.0,The dress does not look like the photo.  It actually looks like the work of a seamstress who is has just started sewing.<br />waste of money.
1.0,Way to big for both mother and daughter. Daughters broke the first day of wear. She was so upset. After giving such a special gift it was very disappointing
1.0,The worse product i have ever ordered an waited so patiently nothing about it was like it showes . Looks awful on should not even have 1 star .i am going to be so much more careful what i order from Amazon a lot less i promise you.
1.0,"its ok, if you like see thru dresses."
1.0,"Love the look, but within a few mins I could tell these gave a holographic look, almost like 3D glasses. My left eye had a white spot when I removed the glasses as if I stared directly at the sun, then got a headache. Returning these, something isn't right"
1.0,"Too small, sent it back"
1.0,Not good either
1.0,Does not look like the picture. Colors are off and the holes in the back look like they were put their by the sewing machine by accident. Returning.
1.0,"We bought these as favors for a 1980's themed birthday party. We expected them to be cheap, but you can't even see out the lenses! The will be returned!"
1.0,Vet cheap and runs 3 sizes too small. Ordered XXL and normally wear a jrs lg and still way too small. No hem On the shirt either so just a matter of time until it all falls apart.
1.0,I opened these yesterday and they already look like this. Do not buy. Save your money. Horrible.
1.0,"A warm, super soft fleece cardigan would have been great.  The lining, throughout the torso and tight sleeves, mentioned nowhere in the description as of this point in time, strongly detracts from that, making this, along with the button placements, much more a coat, as it's quite stiff.  A cardigan it's not.  I'm not sure it's really a jacket either, though, due to the floppy fleece.  Had the maker just used fleece, I think I would have liked it.<br /><br />Fit was a bit tight.  I got XLg because I have wide shoulders, expecting it to be a bit loose elsehwere, and it's just wearable.<br /><br />Handwashing?  Meh!  If it were more sweater like, sure, but the bulky body and sleeves will make it hard to get this into a sink."
1.0,"Ordered in a size 2/4 (I'm 5'6&quot; 35 25 38) and it was too small to even get on. I sent it back and ordered the 6/8. That was still too small (and I've never worn anything larger than a 4 in my life) and had a hole in the side. To top it off, the bra padding was lumpy, stiff, and uneven."
1.0,I got my first pair of tangerine leggings in Costco and absolutely fell in love with them but after four years The seams have started to undo themselves between my legs I still use them to wear them around the house but not to go out or go to the gym. I thought that buying these online they would be exactly like the ones I bought in store but I was wrong not only are they too small But the stitching is extremely weak. In fact they sent me the black/black version which has to textured stripes on the front and those are not the ones that were featured in the photo
1.0,they all riped the first day I put them on. it didnt matter how they fit quality was very poor.
1.0,"The edge of the cape is not cut smoothly, making it look very unfinished.  Also, the material is slightly more substantial than pantyhose.  I wasn’t expecting perfection at this price point, but the flaws right in front make it unwearable."
1.0,"Had to send it back for a refund. The top is made out of a stretchy material, while the skirt is a very stiff and plastic like fabric. The skirt had no give and was very unforgiving for larger hips and thighs. It's a mismatch of materials and the photo hides the true nature this Frankenstein of a dress."
1.0,Horrible craftsmanship! There are pulls and incomplete transitions in the fabric all over!<br />The only star I can say that it gets is for fitting okay.
1.0,Looks super cheap.
1.0,"MAGNETS WAY TO SMALL DO NOT STICK AT ALL SAVE YOUR MONEY DO NOT BUY,not even worth 1 star"
1.0,Too small and tight fitting
1.0,I thought the band would be similar to what I had on my fitbit versa. This band is very floppy and the band doesnt stay under the strap.
1.0,I bought these pants in the right size should have gotten a smaller size.
1.0,This case with flimsy and also broken. So was never able to use it. Bad purchase. Gave 1 star just because it wont let you give 0.
1.0,"Very cheap, polyester fabric. This cute dress is miserable to wear, it felt like my body was wrapped in plastic wrap because of the nasty, cheap polyester fabric."
1.0,Even for costume jewelry they look cheap and are way bulkier/bigger than I anticipated. Not for me.
1.0,BOA ...is a gross overstatement .When we opened the cellophanne bag all that came out was 'Fluff' all over the place . It apparently is made of the lleft over pieces of feathers that they scopped upped and tried to glue to a string . It is absolutely worthless!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Buyer Beware !
1.0,I ordered 3 sets which states that its the earrings AND necklace but we only received the necklaces. Would really like the earrings for my grands.
1.0,Broke within the 1st week.
1.0,This item is a s c a m. Does nothing but illuminate a light.
1.0,It was a fake. The cap was not reebok.
1.0,No belt loops. Very thin.
1.0,"Itchy, uncomfortable and does not fit well."
1.0,horrible.
1.0,I received it broken.  Had my husband fix it.  I got to use it one.  It completely fell apart.
1.0,fits about 2 sizes smaller.  size up
1.0,"Cheap fabric, never have worn it, looks like a bad bedsheet"
1.0,It's not like the picture at all
1.0,"The cuff of these pants are huge. They look weird, and I'll probably noybwear these very much. Also , they are very long, covering my entire foot."
1.0,This item is not a sweatshirt. It is a t-shirt. It also runs small.
1.0,"poor quality, I wouldn't buy again."
1.0,Broke easily stones from the crown kept falling off.
1.0,Feels like and sounds like a trash bag
1.0,"Not what was delivered, Not zipper on the neck part at show in picture."
1.0,They are way over priced!
1.0,WAY TOO SMALL!<br />I ordered a large and it won't too much farther than my knees.
1.0,These are cheap some kind of tarnishing metal rings. The description says they are silver. Not just misleading.... A lie. I knew the price was too good to be true! Still disappointing!
1.0,Packaging looked to horrible to give as a present. Buckle needs to be bigger for male.
1.0,I'm not active so I just do the normal stuff I always do and it fell off at 11 am eastern Time. I'm upset because it was so beautiful
1.0,Described as &#34;5 double-sided windows for cards or photos (10-places)&#34;.<br />I ordered two sets for a total of 4 inserts.<br />All four inserts only have 4 double-sided windows for cards or photos (8-places).<br />Product is not as advertised.
1.0,Too small and too long
1.0,Way too small for an adult wrist. Would be good for a school aged child.
1.0,The part for the boobs could of been bigger and the material  looks cheap just as it fits cheap .the color wasn't the one i order either will never but from these ppl again
1.0,Very flimsy...not protective at all! Hard to use your scrolling features of the phone with this case
1.0,Tried to clean the lenses and wiped off the UV protectant rendering the glasses useles. Cheap quality for a cheap price.
1.0,"I was so disappointed, couldn't change them to fit, and ended up breaking while doing so.One star rating is way to generous about these sunglasses"
1.0,These may last longer than the $2 pairs that you can buy at Wal-Mart but they will definitely hurt your feet. These are extremely narrow and made for a person with incredibly long yet extremely narrow feet. You would have to be a mutant for a size 12 in these to actually fit your feet. I have never in my life heard of a person who has a size 12 foot that is less than 2 inches wide. These are strangling my feet and cut off circulation.<br />Also they are full of major defects that can dig into the top of your feet causing severe pain.<br />Good news is after weeks of causing painful blisters these will actually eventually stretch to fit your foot.
1.0,Arrived broken and three days later the letters fell off. Don’t waste your money. Spend the extra $40 and get the real thing. Fake.
1.0,"I measured the cup that we purchased from a local store and then read the measurements on this before deciding to try this one instead. The measurement me say 8x 5.2. This is 6x3.74. I chose this one also because one of the review said it was great for a 9-year-old, which is my son's age. I will be sending this back this weekend, this is more for a 3-5 year old."
1.0,Cheap. Much too big. Arrived weeks late which only soured it further by being such an inferior product.
1.0,"Of all the masks I bought, THIS is the one that I was really looking forward to.  This doesn't say that it is a kids mask yet it will only cover a child's face.  This is not going to cover an adult's face.<br />REALLY disappointed."
1.0,Shirt look cheap. Is not v shape
1.0,Too large 😁👎🏻
1.0,This dress was NOT as pictured above. The fabric was cheap and see thorough not to mention totally different from what I expected. The fit was large and baggy and I do not recommend buying unless you want to be disappointed
1.0,"These are lovely but I wore them once and as I removed them at the end of the day one of the earrings broke leaving the post<br /> in my ear. I am very disappointed, I bought these to match the brooch I had purchased a few weeks earlier."
1.0,Tiny picture is not true to size
1.0,"My daughter is 10 years old and true to size for 10-12. I ordered 14-16 to be safe, didn't want the hassle of returning. They are tight on her! Small. When you return you have to pay for shipping also. It does not clearly stat that anywhere, so heads up."
1.0,"Very flimsy product, nosepad were already off the glasses when i received it."
1.0,"I was really hopeful that these would work, but they don't do anything except make your private area sweaty.  I know that is TMI but it is the truth.  Doesn't reduce the CT at all. Very disappointed, was hoping for a game changer."
1.0,Broke putting it on
1.0,It is very difficult to put on and it did not come with a face cover like shown in the picture.
1.0,"Love the design, but it turns your neck green."
1.0,Some parts look yellow as if the fabric was too old
1.0,"These are extremely small. They do not completely cover your bottom portion of your face. I will keep them and give to my child to use. However, for an adult when you cover your nose it falls on your bottom lip. It does not have the metal nose bridge for a snugger fit."
1.0,"Minute hand broke after a month of wear. Contacted the company and they wanted a video because they thought I was winding it wrong. I wore it for an entire month, pretty sure I know how the watch works! Long story short, can't send videos via Amazon email just pictures so.... they have my money and I have a broken watch that no longer keeps time."
1.0,"Well, I can't review the opaque compression legging/pants (open foot) that I ordered because I received closed toe compression pantyhose.<br /><br />If you look at the picture you can see the barcode sticker is for footless opaque leggings/pants, but the other sticker is for closed toe pantyhose the package actually contained. I'd re-order, but I'm afraid I'll end up with the wrong item again!"
1.0,"washed it and air dried, started falling apart at the seams."
1.0,"Fabric is really stiff, has no stretch. It's too small and looks cheap. Get what you pay for I guess..."
1.0,Returned kept coming lose
1.0,Way too small and links constantly get knotted up.
1.0,The plastic edges are sharp and rather disconcerting to have near your eyeball? IJS other wise it does what it says and is what it is.
1.0,The dress was way too small. The sizing of the dress is inaccurate.
1.0,"This dress was way too short, and the material was too thin. Don’t buy it if you are big busted."
1.0,"I order this for a trip I had. My shirt had been used before, it had deodorant stains and probably the nastiest and strongest armpit odor I have ever smelled. It was gross and unwearable."
1.0,2 of the chokers I got out of plastic bag they literally broke as I touched them
1.0,noo. don't buy
1.0,"I thought these were very pretty...but after wearing one of them my piercing started to hurt. I thought maybe it was because it was a straight bar so I tried a different one of them, and my piercing hurt, bad. It was absolute torture to get it out and when I did it had turned green in my nose. My piercing was fine before I tried these, I have never had a problem with septum jewelry.<br />I'm still trying to heal after but it got much better after I removed"
1.0,"So disappointed! This necklace is so pretty but arrived broken and I am unable to wear it. When I contacted the seller, I received an email failure saying the address was blacklisted!"
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture and smells like a Chinese factory. Cheap fabric and very sheer. Returned.
1.0,Nice material but way too high up on the belly and way too long past knees<br />. not a flattering cut for bike shorts
1.0,I don’t really like this wrap because it is confusing to use. The wrap is way too long and I can’t seem to wrap myself tight enough by pulling on to it.
1.0,"It is rather cheap.  The green charm is extremely thin.  But, you do get what you paid for.  I have had it for quite awhile and have never worn it."
1.0,Didn’t even work when I tried it. Didn’t magnetize in my nose. Waste of money.
1.0,Unfortunately this vest has poor snaps that come out easy.  Will not buy again.  Ended up going into the tradh
1.0,The stockings slide down my legs when I am walking. I have another brand of stockings that do not do that so I know it is not normal.
1.0,"The dress is definitely not the length displayed in the photo for the same color/style. The burgundy polkadot dress in the photo hits mid-thigh, however, in person it is actually a longer dress that hits mid calf. Unfortunately, I did not read through other reviews that asserted the same until after ordering the product. Extremely disappointing."
1.0,not true to its size
1.0,I have 2 pair I’m very disappointed they tear easily
1.0,I just like it
1.0,The watch is attractive but completely useless as the clasp falls open easily.
1.0,Not what I expected. Looks super cheapy and gets tangled.
1.0,This was super thin and bad quality unfortunately
1.0,"I sized up based on reviews that I had read. I should’ve done two sizes. It was still so small. If you have any sort of bust, the top isn’t going to fit you. This looks like it was made for children. I would spend a little extra money and get something that actually fit properly. Really disappointed."
1.0,They had the wrong waistband! Not like advertised!
1.0,"This worked for about 5 min. Not sure if it's broken or just dead batteries. None the less, disappointing."
1.0,Stones missing
1.0,Very cheap looking!
1.0,Not quite what I expected kind cheaply made. I realize I only paid $13 but it Look 👀 CHEAP..
1.0,Both come in adult bigger size. Beads fell off as soon as we put it on. Adjustable string comes apart very easily
1.0,Not a fan at all. They fall weird and don’t move with you at all so they feel awkward. Material is odd. I got on a super savers page - if I had paid the real price they would have been returned in a heartbeat. Donated to a women’s shelter because someone else might not be as picky as I am.
1.0,A cheaply made mess
1.0,The instructions say to &#34;Lay the long edge of the Jeweler's Sizing Ring Guard across the bottom of the right&#34; but they don't show what the &#34;long edge&#34; is.<br /><br />The picture on the package shows what the ring looks like AFTER the guard is installed.<br />In the &#34;You Tube&#34; video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xypmpVcQ7jU  the guard is placed on the OUTSIDE of a WIDE band.<br />In the &#34;You Tube&#34; video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IekYblN8bIw  the guard is not placed on the NARROW band.
1.0,"Poor quality, flimsy construction, don’t waste your Money even for a craft project"
1.0,Got the watch in time but the battery was dead
1.0,Way to big compared to photo! Disappointed
1.0,Fro the price of these shorts they are way beyond cheap quality and practically sheer.
1.0,This was the most awful cheap looking jewelry I have ever seen. I threw it out. Wouldn't even give it to my housekeeper to wear. So small too.
1.0,"I like to wear bonnets to protect my hair from getting tangled or dry. This bonnet does absolutely nothing but cover your hair. You’re better off wrapping a T-shirt around your head, and saving a few dollars. After two nights of wearing this my hair felt matted and dry. This material is not satin and will not protect hair."
1.0,"No me agradó en lo absoluto,  la calidad estaba muy por debajo s la que se mostraban en las fotos"
1.0,"Did not fit nose right. Opening in the wrong place, it just moved around alot. Felt like it was going to fall out."
1.0,If I could have given this item a zero I would. I was so excited to find a shirt that was in my size would fit me and flatter me nicely and instead of getting what should have been a very super cute shirt I get the most ridiculous shirt I've ever seen in my entire life. Poorly made strings are already falling apart there's little pieces of it just it's horrible...
1.0,"Very disappointing. Very different from other face scarfs I have ordered that have plenty of soft fabric with snaps, lined masks with pockets for filters. These are 2-3 inches smaller and very thin, almost to the point of transparency. You cannot use the mask as it has a distinctive chemical smell that I do not want to breathe in. These masks are useless and not even useful as a scarf as they have no snaps to connect the fabric behind your neck and are too small to tie even though I am a small person. Big mistake."
1.0,I ordered this dress in a 3x. What I received must have been a child's 3x. I don't know what this was. I had to give it to my child.
1.0,"Ordered two outfits, and only received ONE."
1.0,"Does not last. Got it on June 9, 2019 and trashed on July 20, 2019. We swim daily and the suit was washed every week. Can see through it and the arms are all stretched out and cover the hands. Hole in the shorts... Would not buy again."
1.0,Sizes are incorrect and I ended up giving a 4x size shirt to my daughter who is about 150
1.0,"This is a really pretty earring, but the hook broke on the first day of wear. Way too expensive to not last :("
1.0,The arm holes are cut too tight while the rest of the top is too big.
1.0,This watch face cracked five minutes after my granddaughter charged it and put it on her wrist. I can only deduce that it was defective when it arrived.
1.0,Fabric did not feel nice. Almost like those cheap reusable grocery bags.
1.0,"This dress for one thing is NOT an American fit at all. The model is wearing an x-l. I know because I ordered an extra large and the dress looks like it will fit my daughter who is a size 4. Also be very careful because I was going to give it to my neighbor whom daughter is also a size four but it did not fit because shes a size 4 but her back is wide. (hopefully you understand). The dress also is not floor length. we are all about 5 5 and it was a bit high, really high. Above our ankles high."
1.0,Looks very cheap..
1.0,They aren't matte they add just regular
1.0,"I am not even a plus size woman and these are way too small! I am 130 pounds, and I wear size 6-8 pants. I can't imagine someone that is actually plus size try to put these on!"
1.0,I have some other socks that were these brand and identical except for when I ordered these they were extremely thin and the material kept picking on everything. Very disappointed and definitely not worth the money. I would not purchase again. And I do not suggest anyone else spends this kind of money on these you will be very disappointed as well guaranteed! Plus some of the socks didn’t even cover my heel they were all the same size but fit differently each one
1.0,Absolute garbage.  What good is a handkerchief that is so thin as to be non-absorbent?
1.0,This is a different item then what I ordered. The picture looks totally different than the actual rings that you get. Don’t waste your money. The rings look cheap and it’s not the same image. The image is very deceiving. I bought this for a birthday gift for my daughter and she is OK with it but I am not. I will be returning.
1.0,Pure waste of money. Thanks China.
1.0,"Stopped working almost immediately, hands were just hanging and watch band became discolored with one day of wearing. Returned it"
1.0,It's a cute tutu for dance but unfortunately the strap came broken my daughter was so sad
1.0,I bought this in hopes of keeping this on my work keys. Within 3 days of work the front face broke off and within two weeks the back broke off. Dont buy this if you need it to be any kind of heavy duty product.
1.0,I don’t loke it
1.0,"I don't know if this is Asian sized or what, but it was wayyyyy too small for me. I couldn't even get the buttons fastened. Also, it is NOT a dress, it is a tunic top that should be worn with pants or leggings. But if you plan to wear this as a dress, plan to have &#34;all your business&#34; showing. The material is very thin, hard and wrinkly. I am definitely returning!"
1.0,It doesn’t look like the pic. It’s very cheap made.
1.0,"The worst ring set! Don't waste your money, the big stone is cloudy and the other stones look like they have a film on them. The only reason I gave it one star is I  had to in order to write my review."
1.0,THESE EARRING CAUSED A RASH ON MY DAUGHTER EARS.
1.0,This product has an elastic waistband that cuts off the circulation to the lower half of my body. It’s not cute at all. If you’re normally a size medium order large or xl
1.0,"It’s repackaged and being sent back tomorrow. This dress was absolutely ridiculous. I read then re-red the sizing chart and everything runs down was huge but the chest part was so horrific it was comical. The inner lining wasn’t lined up behind the front material so the lining is exposed even on the hanger, once you put it on it looks even worse and the slit is lol more like a gash. I have triple Ds (exactly why I went over the size chart multiple times) and the “slit” was literally opened from nipple to nipple lol horrible just absolutely terrible and cheap in the manufacturing of this dress"
1.0,"Tacky, the material is inferior. Total waste of money"
1.0,JUST RECEIVE THE ITEM FOR FEW DAY I USE FOR THE SECOND TIME IT BROKE IN HALF NOT REALLY RECOMMEND
1.0,"Too small, color is bright yellow and looks cheap.  My teenager did the shopping for these.  I personally would not have bought them, but it was her Christmas money."
1.0,Had it for less then ten min. Put it on once. Fell apart. Wtf. Not worth it. Paid for overnight to. Pass.
1.0,"I got this for my girlfriend from some arbitrary holiday.  It was not at all universally fitting, and it's not like she has some crazy elven ears, their just normal ears and this thing was all over the place."
1.0,I dont like
1.0,"So disappointed. Wore once, washed it and the seams have ripped."
1.0,Caution: Order a size up! Dress is beautiful but not true to size!  Sizes run small and waistline is extremely tight knitted.
1.0,Not well made.  One of the lenses is all wavy like it didn’t quite fit in the frame.
1.0,It did nothing. No light no eye opening. To expensive.
1.0,Very cute suit but if you have boobs then this is not the swimsuit for you. My XL top fitted more like a small.
1.0,"The package was already opened upon my receiving it. Moreover the glasses were very crooked and bent outwards, they didn’t even fit on my head without falling off (I think I have a normal head??). Will probably be returning :( really cute though"
1.0,I've worn it twice and the second time one of the strands of beads broke and fell off. Super bummed because I loved the bracelet.
1.0,Arrived  not working and the brand name just floats inside the face.  Will not purchase again.
1.0,This product looks good but the magnet to hold the strap on your wrist is incredibly strong and the strap constantly gets caught in your hair.
1.0,If you have smallish calves and big feet dont buy. It will fit those opposite of what I said. It's not what I expected.  It's a no for me.
1.0,Showed up out of battery. Useless!
1.0,Oh my GOODNESS. I should've gone through the reviews for this one. I bought this without thinking and was surprised when it came in the mail. The V-cut is NOT even a &#34;V&#34;. It's more like a &#34;U-cut&#34; lol. The crisp cross strings didnt even help. It was loose and I'm a 32D. It was not flattering and very see through. Threw it away. Couldn't make something out of it like a tube top and couldnt bring myself to donate this sad fabric.
1.0,I ordered this for my daughter for her confirmation and it broke when she tried to put it on.  😥😥
1.0,"This is a lot smaller than I expected order at least 2 sizes up, otherwise it’s really fitted."
1.0,"DON'T buy it! Counterfeit item. Different design from the photo on the amazon, doesn't have La Sportiva logos on the sleeve and back, wrong color (bright yellow), cheap fabric and has a strong chemical odor! And if you decide to return it, they will want you to pay for the shipment to return address somewhere in CHINA!!!"
1.0,piece of junk.
1.0,Material was itchy and size down. Purchased smallest size but had to return was still almost 2 sizes big cute dress though!
1.0,The dislike of the product is that the moisture of breathing made this mask wet on your face
1.0,"Not only was the S more like a L, but I washed it once and the seams are cooking apart. Don’t buy this."
1.0,Piece of fabric with velcro on it not sure why advertising anything about headphones with it there's not a slit or anything in the fabric to run your own headphones through much less headphones coming with it
1.0,The tights were way too long. Material looks cheap
1.0,"This broke before I even got a chance to wear it, I had to use an extender from another piece of jewelry in order to wear it."
1.0,I bought the large as well after looking at the size chart. When I tried it on I found it very hard to get the top on and off. The day of the party (Also bought a mask and shoes) I went to put it on sat down and busted the seat out of the pants. After putting the top on I busted the armpits out trying to turn the fringe button to the back. When I leaned over to tie the shoes the middle ruffle split. This material is not patchable and the outfit is not in any way flexible. I loved the look but as I never got to wear it out I would not buy it again.
1.0,They straps are very short and super small.
1.0,"Material was misleading. Looked like it would’ve been a good quality soft kinda shiny material. Arrived super paper thin, very ugly for $35 plus. Should’ve been $5. Wouldn’t wear it if someone paid me. Returning it now"
1.0,I suggest yall I can save your money for the real one.
1.0,"The ad said charms pins plural but I only received one and there is no option to pick one. Very disappointed for $9.99, $10.81 with tax!"
1.0,I wanted them to wear under light weight slacks. They were much to small. I gave them away.
1.0,Cheap the clip isn't great.
1.0,"I bought 2 pairs in 6 months but the inseam on both came apart. I assumed the first pair were my fault. They lasted 3 months before they ripped. The second pair lasted 1 month. Nice fit and look, but dont last."
1.0,"Pretty disappointed.  I followed the below reviews to get a larger size, however the bathing suit I received looks nothing like the pictured bathing suit and is barely high wasted."
1.0,WAAAAYY too small and short for me. I was looking for something that would work to wear with leggings and even at 5' this only came to my waist. Even the large was too form fitting for me. I returned it
1.0,This is a stiff leather belt which has been coated with a plastic finish. The belt is hard to buckle due to the stiffness.  Wore it one day and the plastic coating has started to peel off around the belt hole. Very low end and not worth returning. Get something real leather and avoid this waste of money.
1.0,Too thin. Cold polyester feel. Not for me.  Wanted cotton socks.
1.0,"Update: took it down to one star because the return actually isn’t free - it has to be packaged a certain way - so it’s really just an overall inconvenience.<br /><br />Pretty color, wrist fit, and material, BUT, even though the band technically fits the watch, the quick release pins are just slightly too short when fully expanded/so loose that my watch fell off with the slightest pressure when wearing - searching in my bag, walking and brushing my wrist against my body, reaching arm through a jacket sleeve. Returning and would not recommend."
1.0,Didn't like the color or the look.  Too cheap and plastic looking.
1.0,Broke with in an hour.
1.0,Very still and scratches
1.0,Horrible scratchy with weird color flecks throughout.
1.0,Desafiado grande no coincide con la tabla de medidas
1.0,"WAY too small order an XL and the top MIGHT have fit a b cup, maybe."
1.0,"Dissatisfied.  Had a rip in side seam of dress, split was in front of dress, not on side as shown. Size runs small & is too long"
1.0,It was broken in the package..... I never even got to wear it.<br /><br />Very disappointed.
1.0,Shorts were way too small. Return to Vendor costs as much as the product .Don't buy this item or anything else from them
1.0,Each piece is like the size of a penny. They are MUCH larger than i was expecting. Cant really wear them at all
1.0,"DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE LEGGINGS!<br /><br />For reference, I’m 5’1 and weigh 143 lbs.  I was looking for leggings/tights that would provide quite a bit of compression as I’ve recently been diagnosed with lipedema.<br /><br />These leggings were recommended by one of the staff at my doctor’s office so I purchased based on her rec.  Perhaps I received a different version/style than she has ordered before, but these leggings are more of a footless tight since the material is too sheer to wear as a legging.<br /><br />As for compression, the only pressure was on my calves, the fit on thighs, tummy and hips was extremely light making the fit uncomfortable with a weird silhouette under dresses or pants.<br /><br />The worst part of these leggings is the awkward “boy short” style underwear inside the legging. I didn’t see anywhere in the description that mentioned internal underwear. The material of the internal underwear is polyester-type and baggy making it quickly creep up your rear and provides no breathability in the crotch area.<br /><br />I would send these back for a refund however I placed so much trust in the recommendation I had received that I washed them immediately after delivery so I could wear them under a dress I planned to wear for dinner that night.<br /><br />Very dissatisfied and a waste of my money!"
1.0,"False advertising.  States 3pcs/lot but only 1 of them ships.  Bought for daughter, wish all items would have arrived."
1.0,"Fabric did not stretch, band did. Can't wear it. Waste of money and effort."
1.0,"The fit was very small, fit like a kids medium"
1.0,Disappointed. This is not a silk screen shirt. Front decor is like a plastic sheet…..
1.0,The product is light and silly looking. Don’t waste your time. I don’t even know how to describe how cheap it looks and feels. Super disappointed.
1.0,"The cut is too curvy, if you have small or regular derriere like me they will not fit you well. You will have a set of crumbled lines below your butt. I do not wish to wear butt extenders to fill them up. I returned them."
1.0,"For years I've been buying tons of real and fake gold and brass jewelry from all over the place.  I love it all.  It's only since I've been trying out ""gold"" jewelry from amazon in the past year that I've encountered this electric sunflower yellow color of metal.  It is absolutely ridiculous looking.  It literally is yellow.  You can see how cheap it is from across the room.  It looks like something that would come out of a gumball machine.  Why is this becoming so common?<br />Overall, this is well made and seems sturdy, but I just can't get past the yellow color."
1.0,Too big all over for a petite size. Sleeves 3 inches too long. Has to be ironed.
1.0,"These pants have no side pockets. There is one slit pocket in the waistband. I don’t think that counts because it is not even useful.<br />Other than lacking pockets, the pants are comfortable. However, I selected these pants because the description claims they have pockets! I’m very disappointed. I didn’t realize there were no pockets until I put them on. I just assumed that the description was accurate and didn’t check when they arrived. I will not buy these again."
1.0,Did not realize this dress was shirt in front long in back
1.0,Most cheap material it’s so I soft and not breathable I hate them
1.0,Just don't bother.<br /><br />Poor quality fabric and offers no support or coverage.<br /><br />Design is not attractive.
1.0,"Nice shirt, but it come with aw hole in it. I paid too much for this shirt to have a whole."
1.0,"They don’t look anything like the picture, they do fit to size though. The colors don’t look like the picture, they look cheap. The fit isn’t flattering whatsoever. Definitely returning them"
1.0,"The picture shows very different from reality<br />When I tried it on, it didn't look the same"
1.0,Foggy shield couldn’t see
1.0,I was disappointed with how this fit me. It runs small on the arms.
1.0,Cheaply made and black mold on handles upon arrival.  I do not recommend at all.
1.0,"When it came out of the box it smelled terrible.  I charged the battery plugged it in held the button down for three seconds to turn it on and waited.  It has three small heating elements 2"" x 4"".  One in the back a few inches from the top and two in the front at the pockets.  It might keep your hands warm except one pocket is for the battery.  You can see from stitching in images how small they are."
1.0,Can't breathe through these. It's like a tight polyester jacket material. Very cute though. Should have been a lighter weight material.  These are like waterproof!  Returning.
1.0,"Hats fell apart on one cycle of delicate with dreft. Not worth the purchase, if you don't have to wash them (not sure who this would apply to since you really have to wash everything you put on an infant) than it would look cute for a wear or two before they fall apart."
1.0,Hole in the crotch right out of the package :( loved the idea of these- wish they weren’t damaged
1.0,Wrong item false advertisement.
1.0,Second time I ordered this item is noting close to the picture. Shame on u.
1.0,The card looks like something I could do on my own computer and the keychain was bubbles over the writing. Poor quality!
1.0,It broke when my son put it on his Keychain it didn't even make first shift. Smh
1.0,Yes the bow in the back is all saggy and hangs down. I ordered a medium and its HUGE.. I'm hoping it'll shrink..I'm 120 lbs 34 DD and am 5'1&#34;. Definitely wouldn't recommend.
1.0,They don’t work well with large boobs
1.0,"I had to return the watchband. It was a tiny fraction wider than the lugs of my Moto 360 G 2nd generation 46mm smart watch. Even though the listing says it fits the 2nd gen Moto 360 watch, it just wouldnt go in. The 22mm watch band was the tiniest fraction wider than the watch."
1.0,Poor poor quality.
1.0,Lower part of necklace was way too loose
1.0,I dont know how they are receiving high ratings. The colors are pretty but not for wide calfs. False advertising!
1.0,Ordered green and received black. There is no black option. Fit is extremely large.
1.0,Had is barely a month and it’s already ripping. Very disappointed.
1.0,Poorly Made<br /><br />(AWS)
1.0,They are so small you need a magnifying glass to see them.<br />Not satisfied with them at all.<br />Priscilla Gocha
1.0,I ordered this item for my wife as she likes the zebra print but when it arrived the case is NOT black and white but is black and dark grey. We figured it would be too costly to return so just kept it
1.0,Completely disappointed waited and waited for so long for them to come broken.
1.0,They dress actually separated at the seems on several places after one wearing it for a few hours.  Cheaply made.
1.0,"did not receive what is pictured, very ugly what I did receive now I have to send it back not happy!"
1.0,The part that goes in your ear is way too thick.
1.0,"Poorly designed closure , It sticks out and I can't see the purpose of the extra part, besides it is a complete disturbance in anything you do.<br />It was a gift, and can't use it."
1.0,The coat is pretty but the quality  not that much.It came with one of the sides stitching open .
1.0,The shoulders are too small. I wouldn't recommend this item because it's not produced very well
1.0,"It was a very pretty dress, but it was way too small.  I ordered a Large (I am a size 10-12). It wouldn't meet in front.  I double checked the size - thinking it was a Small - or a child's Large.  Couldn't even wear a camisole under - just wouldn't work."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:52550aac47decf9e8fdd993bde465d89]]
1.0,"I Honestly don’t get all these positive reviews. This shirt is very cheap looking,  see-through and clingy. Save your money..."
1.0,Fabric was thin and the size ran very small.  XXL fity daughter who wears a small.
1.0,They were shining material look nothing like the picture
1.0,Too big. The pads inside fall out bc they’re not secured in. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,"I love the concept of this product as a gift. I got this product for my husband as a Father's Day gift with a picture of our son on it. A few weeks after, the picture faded which is a grave disappointment. I do not recommend this product at all. It's not worth the money!"
1.0,These earring were cute and I loved the color but they were poorly made and the back detached from the clasp the first time I tried them on :(
1.0,It didn't work for my Dad. Guess he is in the 20% bracket 😞
1.0,"I left these glasses under a lamp and then in the sun, so I could see a change. The glasses pretty much stayed clear, at no point did they turn dark, so disappointed."
1.0,"Now as one can see from the pictures a Men's 12 is not a TRUE statement. The orange set were the first pair purchased at a Men's 13, clearly is not the same as the blue Men's 12. The metric on the bottom is 44 for blue and 46 for the orange."
1.0,Zipper runs down
1.0,"There no back part to the war ring so how Ian I going where them , just a waste of time to wait in the mail and no back piece"
1.0,Bought the largest size for my women's size 12W feet and normal size calf.  These did not even make it to the ankle no matter how much I struggled.  Returned immediately.
1.0,Pésimo
1.0,Terrible product. Easy to put on and take off. Ringer button can barely be adjusted on/off. The bottom cover for the power and headphone jack does not close. Bought 2 of these and both are impossible to shut. Don’t bother.
1.0,"I applied and waited as directions said but it doesn't seem to make any difference in waterproofing. I even tested by splashing some water on it and rubbing the boot with a towel, and the black coloring from my Thursday boots came off! Also, the spray doesn't spray well and it leaves white splotches on the boot that don't come off. Disappointed in this product."
1.0,1 day is all it took for seams to come apart.
1.0,These undies are very comfy and look great but they are just plain junk.. 4-6 days of wearing and the corresponding washes(front load washer on warm) on each will see them coming apart.. too bad.. my wife really liked them
1.0,After using gloves only a few times the coating started to crack and split open.
1.0,The look was nice but make sure you purchase the one with hooks… maybe there<br />For making designs for people who like<br />Creating? There going back!
1.0,Weird - weird - weird fit. Don’t recommend.
1.0,"I have a really small neck, was very tight"
1.0,"The material is not light and flowy as it seem in the picture it is a bit stiff. I have bigger hips and it is tight for me. The picture looks like a it is bigger on the bottom, but it actually goes straight down with no give."
1.0,"There really was no way for me  to rate this sweater anything other than 1 star. I would have rated it zero stars if that option was available.<br /><br />The reason for the low rating is simply this: I received a sweater that was obviously used and worn, and badly stained. (See photos I included with this review.)<br /><br />I won't address whether or not the sweater ""might"" have fit. It was so dirty I didn't even try it on.<br /><br />Nor will I address any details about the fabric weight, stitching quality, etc. Again, because of the awful condition in which the sweater arrived.<br /><br />All I can say for sure is: be careful if you are thinking of ordering this garment."
1.0,"I was hoping this would stretch a pair of shoes, but it did not have enough tension. The attempt was good, but not enough to make a difference."
1.0,TERRIBLY made!! The quality of the cloth itself is good. The design looks awesome but I wanted to ask whoever made it what they were thinking?!?! The boobs come out on the sides and there’s absolutely no way to hold them in. It looks like a 3 year old cut the whole bust part. I hope I can get my money back. DO NOT BUY.
1.0,BOUGHT A PRODUCT BEFORE THAT I LOVED IT SO MUCH. BUT THIS ONE IS TOO SMALL.
1.0,"The product itself came later then expected, upon arrival and inspection it was clear that it was cheaply made, the product had very little stretch if any, and the sizing was far from true. Felt like it was a child medium. Will be returning."
1.0,This mask is red and blue not orange and blue. It’s not even a reddish orange as it looks in my picture—it’s crimson red.
1.0,Didnt like it at all sent it back
1.0,"Another sock maker that doesn't have a clue! Why would I want a sock that balls up on the bottom of my sneaker after 5 steps?! What a waste. These socks are for size 12.5 to 16 more like 8.5 to 10. Not all socks are the same size also, out of the 12 pairs purchased, only 4 come close to fitting. I don't think Reebok knows what quality control is. These socks are garbage"
1.0,Way to small also they look super cheap glasses I didn’t like the style looks different on the pictures
1.0,"It was made completely wrong.  The straps were sewn so close together, you can't fit your head thru. It's also paper thin and see thru so you have to wear a strapless bra even if it were made right.  It's not wearable because you cNt put it on.  Reminds me of when I tried a sewing class in HS."
1.0,"These  things are worthless, can not keep them on, they slip forward, no mater how they're buckled."
1.0,Cute and fits well but the material makes it difficult to breathe....I worked in Healthcare and wore n95s with sheilds....but this Xmas mask is smothering.
1.0,The shape is not as pictured. Square rather than curved.
1.0,IT’S NOT A SLIM FIT!
1.0,terrible material and see thru.  It runs extra extra small too.  returned.
1.0,had size issue  returned
1.0,Runs very large. I used them on the beach and sand was so thick in the sock and my feet were soaked. There’s no cushion on the bottom so you feel every rock or stick on the ground
1.0,"BIG, CHEAP METAL"
1.0,These were so cheaply made and fell completely apart after wearing them only once.
1.0,Fell apart within weeks of owning it. I do not recommend this product.
1.0,I bought 3 of them for Christmas. They broke 2 days after having them. Cheap braclets. I contact the seller so far i havent gotten them replaced.
1.0,"painted on one side. wood on the other. if you like that, this earring set is for you."
1.0,My daughter was very disappointed when she received this.  She obviously didn't read the print and bought based upon your ads pictures. Please change your images to show the actual items buyers will receive (3). Product was very expensive for what we received.
1.0,"I ordered a XL, but it fit like a medium. I usually wear a medium but wanted it to be loose but it was way way to small. I will not be purchasing this brand in the future."
1.0,Would have loved the skirt if fit!  Ordered an XL and it looks like it would have fit a young girl!
1.0,They were falling apart
1.0,"Lo devolví porque no es cómo en la foto,muyyy ceñido en pecho labtela no estira,y tenia una costura que quedaba entre el cuello y el pecho que deberia de haber quedado debajo del pecho"
1.0,Don't create heat like described
1.0,Fabric very sheer and runs small made in China sending back. No room in shoulder area fir movement and it rides up
1.0,"Poor quality, runs small if you have large breasts. I returned it."
1.0,"Fast deliver , would not buy again. Cheaply made , very heavy on my head ,fell apart after first wear . Not happy with item"
1.0,Top ran small and bottoms ran big.
1.0,"Arrived broken. Lobster clasp was missing. Returned next day.<br /><br />Color was more copper than rose. Very dainty/tiny (yes I reviewed the measurements before purchasing).<br /><br />Regardless of damage, this wasn’t going to be a keeper.<br /><br />Seller refunded quickly and without fuss."
1.0,"First of all it is not what I saw in the prom picture. The chains are tangled and it is a mess to untangled them.<br />Second it is disproportionate, some chains are hang my neck very short size ,,, other two are too long... it looks unbalanced. I really don't like how it looks this way. But the worst is that after used it the gold color became in black very very dissapointed!"
1.0,"Wasting of money, such a poor quality, Amazon should check quality before selling it"
1.0,"Ordered and received a different pattern than the elephants shown. Sent back and ordered again weeks later thinking it was a fluke. Got yet a different pattern. Since I really wanted the skirt shown for sale, I am definitely dissatisfied."
1.0,"Junk, First watch came and the reset button did not work, they replaced it and the second watch the hands do not work. Somebody there needs to do some QA. Bummer cause it is very nice looking."
1.0,I didn't like it. It's nothing like the picture. You have to look at it from the side to see the design.
1.0,"I was so disappointed when I received this, its absolutely gorgeous but completely unwearable! It's super heavy and doesnt bend to your face what so ever, it also came with tons of jewels missing."
1.0,Definitely too small and veryyy chunky/ugly.  Did not like.  Do not recommend buying.  And if by some reason you do buy this ugly cardigan...buy at least 2 sizes up!!
1.0,"The picture of the mask in the ad is deceiving. I've included pics so you get the full story before ordering. Also, initial shipping stated we would receive in 3 weeks...took 5. Glad we ordered two months before Halloween so we could order a better mask. Buyer be ware."
1.0,This was a waist of money. I ordered a xxl and it more like a medium.
1.0,"I ordered the ""red fox"" animal hood, and already have 3 hoods, all bought from different sellers on amazon. Upon the arrival of this hood I was SHOCKED to see what I had received was NOT what I had ordered at all. I received a bright RED hood with a horrible silky liner. It was thin, flimsy and overall poor quality. There are 4 different pictures of a FOX hood, yet the item I received is a tacky bright red hood. I am not happy whatsoever and will not be purchasing from this seller ever again."
1.0,"bad quality, Unpleasant smell, DO NOT buy it!!"
1.0,Hardly any silicone on sponge--nearly completely dry!! Would NOT recommend
1.0,This shirt is poor quality and not size fitting. Super sad!
1.0,The chain broke in the middle as soon as I put it on.
1.0,"Waste of money, broke within days. The ball came off the post of the earring"
1.0,The product itself seems decently well made. But we ordered a XXL (my fiancé normally wears a large) and he couldn’t even get his arm in. If they made larger sizing I suggest sizing way up when purchasing
1.0,Heavy on my neck and so cheap looking i guess that’s what you get when you don’t pay much however pic of item looked nice they tricked me
1.0,"This is not true to size. It is very small, I could not even get it on and I ordered the size they suggested."
1.0,A lot bigger than anticipated.  I won't get my earrings online ever again.
1.0,"It looks nice in the photo, but it is a very cheap and thin fabric in person. Might use it around the house over my pj's. Wouldn't wear it outside."
1.0,This product barely lasted 3 months before the support vanished making it painful to walk. There is a reason why they include an extra set of insoles...the product doesn't last!
1.0,Fits really awkward. It has a big top so small heads don’t fit well in it. It ended up fitting my boyfriend better than me lol. I returned it but maybe a lady with a larger head it would work?
1.0,It looked nothing like it did in the picture!  It was also very large.
1.0,Material is great but Size runs extremely small . My XXL is like Target size S . Im disappointed
1.0,When I bought this I thought it would be a nice thick cloth. It's very cheap and falls apart after the first time you use them.
1.0,These came as wedding gloves when they were marked MENS Gloves. I know no man who wears white wedding gloves. They also had runs through them while still in package and the Large is small for a Large. If you wear a Large buy larger by atleast 1 size.
1.0,Shirt came with a snag in it. Very cheaply made. Doesn’t fit anything like the picture shows.
1.0,"Horrid smell, material is too flimsy, and this mask does not wash well."
1.0,"Ordered a Medium, per size chart it runs small. Im 5'4 and size 7 in jeans so my lower body isnt that big. When the product arrived, I thought it was a joke lol. The bikini bottoms were TINY, looks like they belonged to a 10 year old. I mean I know they say they run small but that is ridiculous. Im a 34 D the top was a little tight but not too bad. They should really re-evaluate their sizes!!  Overall the bikini was ok quality and cute, but their sizing sucks. Be safe rather than sorry and get the next size up or 2."
1.0,Don’t bother. The ring with one little stone lost the gem in a matter of days. Not worth the money.
1.0,"No. Just NO!!! Super, duper UGLY."
1.0,Fits big and way too long. Hated the thin material.
1.0,It's really nice sweatshirt just a bit small really disappointed didint fit me even. Do I reed and doble check the size chart 😓 Am usually a size small I order a size M and still didint fit me
1.0,"The fit of the product was represented to be &#34; skin tight.&#34; Ad suggested buying one size larger. Wrong, and wrong again. Item was represented as a compression shirt. Again, not as represented. Poor product. Poor choice for Amazon."
1.0,the black on the sleeve area was small with no stretch to get up my arm
1.0,I bought these glasses I. December 2019. It took awhile for to adjust to the progressive lense but I did they were great. The plastic hinge broke last night to my surprise. I can’t imagine having to replace every 6 months. So I would not recommend these to anyone.
1.0,The quality was awful!
1.0,"I am an extra large.  I am 5' 10'', weigh 210 pounds and have always worn extra large sweaters, coats, sweat shirts and so on.  When I picked this thing up out of the box I knew it would end badly.  I put it on and was so disgusted I literally threw it into the back off my closet.  It said ""extra large"" on the tag but it fit like something a small 12 year old would have worn.  ""fat guy in a little coat"" would be an understatement.  There is no way this was an extra large.  I still now, weeks later, haven't even touched it.  I should have returned it but didn't want the hassle.  It took 3 weeks to get here, it would be spring before I got another one.  At some point I'll mark out the extra large and donate it to GoodWill.  But I would give this a negative 5 Stars"
1.0,Shirt is nothing like the picture.  It's half that side and not comfortable material.  Tried to return it but you have to pay shipping back. Total waste of money
1.0,Horrible.  Handles broke the first day.  Cheaply made.  Wheels don't roll evenly.  Stay away.
1.0,The size was way off. I bought it 2 sizes bigger and it still didn't fit.
1.0,Because it wasn't like I thought it would be it was a sticker under the glass
1.0,Didnt  fit right
1.0,Cancelled shipping
1.0,"These panties looked very nice. Well made and the colors were very pretty. However, saying these panties have a bad smell is not being truthful. They actually STINK. I am in process of washing them for the second time with all kinds of laundry additives, but I am skeptical. Since I have tried washing away the offensive odor, I don't think I can return them. Too bad, I am disappointed they are so pretty.<br /><br />4 HR UPDATE:  I have washed these 3 times. The last time I added vinegar to the wash water. The smell is still awful. I simply cannot wear these. I wanted to return. Tho I can somewhat understand the return policy, it seems unreasonable under the circumstances. I am going to be forced to throw them away. Too bad.<br /><br />NEXT DAY UPDATE: Washed again....used Fabreze...line dried. They still have a strong chemical smell. If anyone figures out a way to make this product useable....please let me know. I want to like them. Also, if you decide to take a chance, be aware of the return policy.<br /><br />* We do not accept return due to hygienic reason.

1.0,"Too short, imit looked longer on the picture but it is not flattering on me because it's more of a choker. I gave it away."
1.0,"I really like the material and looking of this sandals, anyway for a size 13 it is really narrow and uncomfortable. It would be a better product if a little wider and true-size."
1.0,Not very warm in sub 32 temps also ripped already.
1.0,"My son put it on, went outside, bent down, and it just snapped"
1.0,"This shirt came up under a ""fitted"" search. This is a medium.<br /><br />I'm 6'1"" 185lb with an athletic build. These shirts draped like an oversized curtain.<br /><br />The quality was questionable with poor trimming, unraveling, and pulling threads.<br /><br />The arms look like they are like from a 2x. Open, wide and boxy.<br /><br />Really a poor shirt. Avoid. I got it for $10 on a Prime deal and still feel ripped off."
1.0,"Was hopeful these would be a good replacement for Oofos. They are NOT. Hard arch support as opposed to the heavenly clouds of Oofos. And the company I ordered from sent the wrong size- strike 2. Despite being 3 (!!) sizes too big, I’ve worn them around the house to get a feel for them and they HURT - they’re way too hard to be “recovery footwear”. :P<br /><br />Sending back and just paying for for dang Oofos; I figure my body deserves to be treated well and these aren’t it. Major bummer."
1.0,Not stitched properly
1.0,"WAY too large! Also disappointed - some of the reviews and pictures have this as a true wrap dress, in which case I could have likely wrapped it tighter, but it wasn't. It had a zipper. Will be returning this dress.<br /><br />Size small, 5'4 120lbs"
1.0,"sent me the wrong set, nothing like the picture! :("
1.0,Wrong size!!!
1.0,"AWFUL!! Does not look like the picture shown whatsoever. It is a weird, shiny, very CHEAP material and has SPARKLES. I can't believe I wasted $30 on this sweater. I will be returning this asap. Such a waste."
1.0,Very long in back
1.0,Items arrived broken.
1.0,I don’t know where this came from but it was dirty looks like someone had wore it and it had them little balls on it I was so disappointed with this item
1.0,"This is without a doubt the worst purchase I've ever made through Amazon.  The hat is made of paper, comes wrinkled and folded and the bow is adhered with glue.  Don't even think about the positive reviews, they must have been paid for them by the manufacturer.  Looks adorable on the site but believe me it's horrible."
1.0,Not what we were looking for.  Wanted bands like Apple stretch Velcro that she had on watch.
1.0,"despite saying nowhere on the website that it was a zip up hoodie, advertising a front pouch pocket, and the pictures showing a pullover hoodie i received a zip up. i ordered an ash xxxxx-large hoodie and while it is still a nice sweatshirt i am extremely disappointed as i had bought this specifically because i thought it was a pullover. i am very disappointed by the false advertisement."
1.0,this was something i got to work out in..don't waste your time. The material is so cheap and see through. It doesn't even have tags inside to see the difference from back to front.. waste of money
1.0,Do NOT order you are better off wearing slippers with nails in them!
1.0,No strap
1.0,"Cheaply made, cut too small. Woman in picture appears to be plussize but the dress I received will in no way fit a woman her size,  I ordered 2 sizes larger than I wear and it was still too small"
1.0,I cannot get the watch to reset. I cannot fix the time or anything.
1.0,What a piece of garbage!  The reel broke within the first 5 minutes of wearing it AND I hadn't even used it yet!
1.0,"I ordered this for my baby brother for a Christmas gift. He saw it on TV and fell in LOVE. But when it finally arrived (three days AFTER Christmas) he was so disappointed he cried! First of all, I will tell you the one pro: the hat itself is pretty thick, warm material which is a plus but it fits weird and doesn't quite cover his ears. The biggest disappointment though was the fact that only one of the wings goes up when you push the button, and it only goes up about half the time and it doesn't unfold all the way. The other wing doesn't go up at all!"
1.0,"Super fake. Huge pearls, really fake gold, heavy, strands don't stay tangled together so it hits at weird lengths. I've never worn it and am looking forward to giving it to my niece for dress-up."
1.0,It has a weird shape to it. The bra area is off and the elastic was tearing when you stretched it even just a little. I feel like it’s poorly made.
1.0,Small for size. Order a size bigger.
1.0,"I needed a new winter coat, I got 2xl and if it were any smaller it would not fit at all. Secondly the hood does not come off in description they say it does. I will never order a coat over the internet ever again. Don’t waste your money."
1.0,"the jacket made with very poor quality<br />the stitches look terrible, not sure if i can ever wear this<br />Quite dissapointed."
1.0,"The suit was half out of the packing bag and looked like it was worn, was very wrinkled and stuffed back in the package - in fact there was a Lable with a different name next to mine on the outside package!"
1.0,Para lo q vale no es la mayor cosa se ve de mala calidad ya mi hijo lo rompio
1.0,I was completely disappointed with the product they weren't at all what I though they be .
1.0,The package was missing earrings! Beautiful bracelet but very disappointed the whole product was not included!
1.0,Looks cheap when you get it. Mine broke a few weeks later. Also when you try to adjust the band it is off by a few so it is either to right or to loose looks cool in the picture
1.0,"This apron was cute on paper, but when I received it, it was so hard that it didn’t bend, and the top strap that hoses around your neck broke immediately, so I’ve never even been able to wear it. Don’t waste your money."
1.0,"Fits...as a shirt! I am 5'10&quot; and unless I want to show off my derrière, I absolutely have to wear something with it. Literally sits just below my hip."
1.0,Daughter super small and it looks cheap
1.0,"This was a 2x and my wife wears 1x and it was way too small your size chart is terrible she purposefully ordered it too big so she could make adjustments but a 2x came way too small that is not good,"
1.0,Cute but seam in one sleeve came unraveled completely with out moments notice.
1.0,I bought two. Very disappointed in the quality and doesn't look like the photograph. Material is cheap. Returning both.
1.0,Not thrilled. Chain broke (and not at the clasp!) when taking off a shirt. The tug was incredibly minimal yet it broke the chain in half. Previously it had been used lightly and never in the shower. Chain was the 3mm. So not happy.
1.0,1st dress arrived with a stitched up hole on the rear backside. 2nd dress also arrived damaged with another mend by the side.
1.0,They were not ripped jeans
1.0,Too big :-((
1.0,too big...too short...too thin
1.0,"Wanted to love this because it’s super cute & great fit! However each time I wear it then hang to dry it bleeds the color all over the sink, tub, lanai etc. No matter how many times it’s wet. I even hand washed it w/delicate soap & not only did the color bleed again but now there are dark streaks through out the top & bottom. And it’s passed the return date so I’m out the money."
1.0,Horrible sandals. Cheap material. Bought these to wear to my sisters wedding. Not worth it.
1.0,"Returning, extremely late arrival. Insane"
1.0,I buy this for my daughter birthday and she can use only one day than it's dead can't charge or turn on it
1.0,May be kids eat ring.. too too small
1.0,very flimsy
1.0,"The design is nice (length, etc.) but arrived with a link missing and an extremely thin gold wire wrapped around two links to hold the necklace together. Returned. Unfortunately, the same or better quality can be found for $4.00 or less at your local Walmart."
1.0,"These are one of the worst pairs of leggings I’ve ever gotten. I’m 5’6, 28 waist, 35 hips. Size 6. Normal legging size small. I looked at their size chart and ordered a medium. These things are incredibly tight. I was able to pull them on but never ever would I even try to wear these out. They’re just way too tight. The shaper band on these is super restrictive and just pushes your fat out to the sides. No way these can be worn reversible as they claim either. It would be a obvious. Just terrible fit, design and material. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼"
1.0,This dress was a joke. I am a true size 10 and I ordered a 12 for wiggle room. However this dress for like an 8.
1.0,They make everything look super green. Very disappointed. I will be sending them back.
1.0,I got the crappiest selection of rings possible. They were all hideous. Not a single ring was one of the pictured examples.<br />Rip off.
1.0,"Washed pants in cold water with detergent for delicates and hung to dry. Color completely bled out and left white blotches throughout. Looks awful and are unwearable, don't waste your money!"
1.0,Junk Junk oh did I mention JUNK
1.0,"They don’t fit correctly, unless you are a specific height and weight. (No good for someone 5’3” weighing 105#.)"
1.0,Doesn't fit well on the body and the pockets always comes out...
1.0,Nice looking but the XL didn’t come close fitting her. Way smaller than actual size.
1.0,"The material is silky, this dress is absolutely hideous and it was an instant return. It looks like a tablecloth, nothing like the picture… skip this one!"
1.0,I’m wear a 36dd and have a pretty small waist and this made me look like a giant poof 😂<br />My mother is a 32A with a small waist and also looked like a giant poof 🤦‍♀️<br />The cut just seems completely off
1.0,The seam isn't 35.5 in. It is a few inches shorter.
1.0,Not for humans.
1.0,Gave as a gift. Had to reorder item too small. Sent back for bigger size. New item torso was bigger but the sleeves were even shorter than the first one and you can’t even use the frog hands they are even smaller. Please don’t buy this item.
1.0,The ring is beautiful but tarnished so quickly..
1.0,This is American.  Not China sizes r at least two sizes too  small<br />.
1.0,"So disappointed. Ordered same dress in blue and fit was perfect. Ordered this color in same size and it's huge. Due to personal medical problems, I missed the return window so am out the cost."
1.0,I am just trying this on it not off the shoulder as pictured or described it has a button loop at top of neck area which is missing and my return window closed 29 days after receiving it. Unfortunately I just decided to wear it today  which would be 3 months from receiving it and I didn't make it out the house because without the button my back would be out and suit would not stay up and on. Sucks because the quality of material seems okay and the fit is good but button defective. Even though it wasn't as pictured I still liked the pantsuit. I will try to reach out to the vendor for a button that I can sew on or go to the fabric store and get one.
1.0,"Cute, but this is pink not red."
1.0,I ordered these shoes on 9/7/2022 and they were never shipped. There is no way to message the seller so I finally cancel the order even tho I love the shoes .
1.0,Does not look like photo. They are poor quality and not very cute like the photo.
1.0,The top is way too small!! It fits my 8-year old. That’s it! Where as the bottom fits my 12-year old! Material is not bad.
1.0,Junk... fell apart in my pocket 3weeks in!
1.0,"Turns your finger green, low quality metal"
1.0,Way too small!! And it was pitiful quality! Nothing like what I expected 😕
1.0,Never buy these jeans. Bought them and we’re nice. Wore them onetime and wash them on cold and delicate and the all black part shredded off all<br />Of over the whit part.
1.0,"I’m 5’1, 125lbs., and this dress is not flattering at all. When you have it on the torso area puffs out (you can use a belt but that wasn’t the look I was going for). Order a medium ! Not a large."
1.0,Wouldn't buy again or recommend it
1.0,"these shoes are so cheaply made, they stick up all over, never even touching my feet!! they look so bad, i have never worn them! I will give them to good will i guess! : ("
1.0,I don’t suggest these. I bought them for my daughters but they come lose almost immediately after putting them on. One was lost within the first few minutes.
1.0,I think most of the reviews are a different sweater - without the crisscross trim on the sleeves.  The one I purchased has this trim. The sweater is stiff and cheap feeling.  It is also darker tan than pictures.  More of a boat neck and very short.  It is not flattering and I cannot wear this.
1.0,It’s mad cheaply and the size is off
1.0,Soooo disappointed with this item. Looks like a toy coin purse for a 3 year old. Thought it was bigger. Don't let size fool you it is way to small for an older person.
1.0,LOOKS AND FEELS VERY CHEAP!! CHOOSE SOMETHING ELSE OR SAVE YOUR MONEY!!
1.0,This item was way too oversized and the straps are not at all what was in the picture.
1.0,The clasp that holds it together to rope broke off within a day
1.0,"was meant as a gift however i believe they where stolen. they look nice tho, may try to order another pair"
1.0,Bought two. One was fine but ran small. The other had a rip on the side.
1.0,"I should have known not to buy this, the picture shows a distressed looking blackish sweatshirt, what I got was a polyester dark grey without any tonal aspects at all, no details on the sleeve or color -- just plain meh ick. Going back tomorrow!"
1.0,I was disappointed that they sent broken suspenders. Missing the claw clamps to attach to the jeans. No time for return. It’s for a first birthday party.
1.0,"I thought this was a woven pattern, but the pattern is on the material."
1.0,I always wash everything before putting on my child because you never know what a product may have been through before it gets delivered or what the child could have a reaction to. So I washed these and they all ripped and came apart the material and fabric is very cheap like and I wouldn’t recommend anybody buying it.
1.0,"The shirt is soft, however it looks like a pajama top :-(."
1.0,I ordered an XL because I wear a L and didn't know how the clothing run ....shirt is EXREMELY small
1.0,It came with a few huge stains and they gave me a hard time to refund my money in fact it was not refunded. DO NOT BUY
1.0,I returned too large
1.0,"Does not fit as shown on the picture, the chain piece is way too big and the adjusting piece does not help."
1.0,Broke right after return window closed. Company reached out and sent me a replacement!
1.0,Do not order these. They are very pretty but the post separated from earring the first time I took them off after only wearing them for a few hours. Very disappointing.
1.0,This belly button ring broke randomly within two weeks.  Very dissatisfied.
1.0,they are super tight for US men size 10.
1.0,"Poorly made, very cheap, flimsy and thin. You can see glue strings all over it. Very hard headband, not even comfortable. Pass."
1.0,No wonder people say these are comfortable - there is no tummy control at all. I tried them on for a whole 5 seconds and immediately started my return.
1.0,"There were some negative reviews for these, but I thought I'd give them a try. I mean, how bad could they really be? And the answer is VERY!<br /><br />When I first put them on I noticed that the left shoe felt much more snug than the right, but I didn't really think much of it. After about an hour I took them off and held them against each other and the left was a good 1/2"" shorter than the right. After wearing them around the house for a bit I also started to notice that I could feel a seam under the middle of my foot on the left shoe. Not only is the left shoe smaller, but it's also sewn together crooked and the sole isn't quite under my foot, it's off to the side. After a day of wearing them indoors the inside fabric started to fall apart. Every time I take my feet out all the fabric lining gets pulled out too. And today I noticed that the stitching is coming undone as well.<br /><br />Garbage slippers if you actually plan on standing or walking in them. I guess they would be awesome if you just want something to keep your feet warm while you sit on the couch.<br /><br />Lesson learned, they're going in the trash where they belong."
1.0,This is not cotton nor linen !  It is a synthetic material !!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,Runs small and first time I washed it got hole in it. Not worth purchasing
1.0,Did not wrap like the picture
1.0,Don't buy!
1.0,"If I could leave zero stars I would. There are SO many things wrong with this item I don't know where to start. Based on reviews I ordered the largest size available, which when arrived said 2XL. Ha! I'm a medium at best, but usually order small. This would not fit a 12 year old properly. The arms were too short and too tight. The button holes are so small there is no way to button, let alone the fact that the jacket is not wide enough to accommodate closing. There was a noticeable discoloration to the back of the coat that makes it look like a bleach stain. This is obviously a BAD knock-off of wherever this jacket comes from. Do yourself a favor and don't even think that you'll be lucky enough to get a good one."
1.0,"They got me! These do not darken like the pics/description. They barely darken at all, and they will not darken in a vehicle because most of auto glass already has a UV film. Waste of money to be honest."
1.0,I loved the first Doublju sweater I ordered. It was a nice high quality poly/rayon blend. I ordered a second one which ended up being 100% acrylic and is very thin with a cheap feel. (Neither sweater had the fabric blend that was described.) The labels are also different on the two sweaters. Very disappointed with the second sweater since I was ordering the same exact product. I give the first sweater shipped 5 stars and the second 1 star because I don't know how to give zero.....
1.0,Flimsy like a T-shirt. Not at all what I wanted or expected.
1.0,"Really disappointed.  Has to cover your whole face, not a beanie like I expected.  Looks pretty stupid too. Dont buy it."
1.0,Half of the button holes don’t even exist. Will be returning. Ordered a medium and a large was sent. Might have still been cute and fit find but what the heck with the missing buttonholes. Do better. Be better.
1.0,"Wrong pattern, cheap, Not flattering I now use it for a house dress"
1.0,"I really wanted to give 5 stars because the two shirts that do fit look fantastic.  The problem is the black one says 2X, but it's not.  It's way too tight compared to the other two.  Besides that they are nice stringers for the $.<br /><br />*** Edit- wow one time through the washer and dryer and they went from a 2X to a tight shmedium!  I do not recommend and will not buy again!"
1.0,Runs extremely small compared to typical us tshirt sizes. Very disappointed.
1.0,"The sweater itself is really nice and well made. However, it hits above the belly button….waaaayy to short."
1.0,Took a week to turn my finger green. Cheap all around
1.0,"Came in random colors, lime green, blue,white"
1.0,Very small for and adult and smelled horrible (chemical smell). After I washed it the smell went away but it became even smaller. Would not recommend
1.0,The sandal's quality is so bad that I can feel deckle edge on the surface of the sandal.
1.0,It’s trash material like a cheap costume
1.0,Will not stay on ears
1.0,5x fit like a large sizes isn't true to fit
1.0,This is a beautiful skirt but small - due to this returning.
1.0,"As soon as I put it on my ear, it broke.."
1.0,"Just, NO."
1.0,"This was such a great little bathing suit cover dress.  I was so excited and happy about it.  It fit great!  I wore it once and then washed it.  After washing it one time, it did not even fit anymore and instead of a dress it was too tight in the arms and fit like a tight shirt showing my entire bathing suit bottoms.  Heed my warning and don't buy.  I even wrote to the seller and explained really nicely what happened and asked for an exchange or return or even a partial credit if i sent it back and they said because I wore it once they would not honor any kind of anything, and I was out of luck.  Im really sad because I loved it so much.  I think my 4 yr old can wear it now though so hopefully its not a complete loss.  Hope this review helps someone!"
1.0,"This was not put together right, no way able to wear it"
1.0,Looked sturdier in the picture was quite thin and definitely not unisex!
1.0,Muy mala calidad y llego de diferente color de lo que originalmente ordene.
1.0,Horrible quality! Waist band stitching caught skirt fabric. Returned.
1.0,Sizing is way off! This was too small and the fabric is cheap. It looks cheap and it feels cheap. I was not pleased with it at all.
1.0,Sleeves are very small. Couldn’t get them past my elbows. The entire dress runs very very small.
1.0,I received this bag today.  The zipper is sewn on crooked and in such a way as to pucker the bag on one side.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Doesn't fit perfectly. Not good enough. Packaging was very poor and cheap.
1.0,The belt literally stopped at my crotch.
1.0,Editing review - it is cute. But I just noticed a big rip between the layers of colors. I’m so mad. She hasn’t event worn it yet.
1.0,"Very tiny, expected them to be larger"
1.0,Disappointed as ordered a larger size (XXL) than normal and find legs are good but waist/hips too tight. One washing and I doubt this will still fit. Returning item.
1.0,In a constant state of tangle...
1.0,these were way to strong for the 3 people i have gotten these for and me also couldnt wear them but thanks for your price
1.0,Junk too hard to get cards out of it and it is not adjustable
1.0,This band is really poor quality. Leather broke off connector after less than two months.
1.0,it is hard and does not move on head properly.
1.0,"terrible. Floppy, no structure.  Cheap.  no good"
1.0,The shoe is quite comfortable but when I tightened the laces for the first time ever the lace ripped right through the eyelet.  Very disappointed that I have to return these shoes.  The material is very fragile and I am sure more eyelets would have ripped out.
1.0,I ordered xx large and my daughter that wears a size 6 was able to wear.
1.0,One of the pickets was sewn weird so it sticks out and doesn’t lay flat like the other one - I should have returned it
1.0,"I am really bummed out about this, because I was so excited to receive this. The color is really nice and It is so warm and fuzzy, but the cut is super small. I would say it is about 2 sizes too small. I had ordered an xl and I couldn't even zip it and it was skin tight on me."
1.0,"Kinda looks like a robe, unless you pose like the model"
1.0,"It saddens me to write this review because I wanted to love this brand sooo much. I previously purchased an item from the brand and fell in love, but this time I’m very disappointed. My first impression of the shirt was that is was poor quality and not worth the price. The sleeves are disproportioned (they were really small and tight for a large) the buttons were very cheap looking. Loose threads all over. Very disappointing. Returning."
1.0,These are see through. Have to wear leggings under them
1.0,"Received the right dress...wrong pattern.  Read all the reviews and opted to size up one size...that didn't even do it.  This dress is very, very, very small and I'm thin!  For very petite 5'5 and under who don't mind gaping dress, top and bottom"
1.0,no happy at all.
1.0,I only received a 3 pack when I paid for a 6 pack.
1.0,"Will be returning these earrings.  They did not match at all.  One was a dark gray, the other white."
1.0,This was not as expected in anyway. Very boxy not a deep v that was described and what I was looking for. Just a plain boxy vneck undershirt not stylish in any way whatsoever and cheap fabric. Returned item for refund
1.0,"The shirt felt great! Slightly more loose than I expected for an Arcteryx medium, but overall a very similar cut to most of their t-shirts. The material is nearly mesh-like, so much so that the light grey color is see-through, which is why I returned it. I would opt for a darker color if you are considering ordering."
1.0,"I ordered two and receive two different items. The black is exactly as advertised. The nude is a completely different item. I will return with an update after I try the nude item out. As a woman were always in search of the best shapewear and I'm going to reluctantly give this item a try, as I don't have time to pick up the proper item-wish me luck."
1.0,"Very thick, on the small side, overall not comfortable."
1.0,Watch didn't even last 6 months.
1.0,"Smaller than expected, poor quality. It arrived with a stain on it"
1.0,This did not fit adults like it said it would
1.0,"These are inexpensive but they are pretty flimsy.  After a few uses, some have bent springs, some flex and spring open beside the clasp.  Don't buy for anything critical."
1.0,Box arrived crushed and was opened. hat looks used. Can’t give This as a Christmas present.
1.0,"I was frustrated to find that there were only about 7 masks inside of the package instead of the 60 that were advertised. If they were off by a few I wouldn’t mind but to be off by 53?!?! Too much. Very disappointed. Fortunately, Amazon is processing a refund but save yourself the trouble and just don’t buy these."
1.0,The glasses broke after wearing twice
1.0,"Too small, it's more for a child."
1.0,Product was sublimated with a heat press and it burnt the bag.  Unable to return so I am stuck with 24 bags.
1.0,"This dress has absolutely no stretch.  So if you are like me , bigger chest, wider shoulders it won’t fit!! I went up a size (xxl). Nope! It was so tight on my upper area of body.  Definitely do not recommend if you are shaped like me."
1.0,"I don’t have a big tummy, but this makes it look like I do. I’m a size small, and always have been but this dress just the way it falls is not pretty."
1.0,I don't know why I thought this watch will be durable when after less than a month of having it the band broke
1.0,The two bands only lasted 8 months. I even had to mix and match parts to make it work. The colors were nice and the comfort level was nice but they just didn't last with normal everyday wear. The screws tend to come out of the connectors. At one point my watch fell into the dumpster without me noticing. Fortunately I was able to find it. I can not recommend this product.
1.0,to flexible will not stay on my bra
1.0,"total utter crap, disproportioned hand made in some sweat shop doesn't fit at all. My wife is a size 7-8 and there is just no way. If it wasn't all out of shape and it was made out of spandex it may have fit. Guess I should have known for a few bucks."
1.0,This item was much smaller then expected
1.0,Nothing like it looks like an way smaller.
1.0,"The earrings look great-however the back is a non-functional construct. It’s a tiny ball that has to screw on and after many attempts to get them in my ears, they didn’t sit right.  The ball does not allow a tight enough fit and they kept falling. When I tried to unscrew the tiny ball to remove them, it was near impossible and required the help of my husband and a pair of pliers as I could not get a grip. I’d recommend the seller designs these with a better earring back for future sales.  I will not be attempting to wear them again."
1.0,"The top itself is fine... fabric is nice, super soft, and sizing seemed fine to me. But the bottom is just stitched over the raw edge - no hem. It looks ridiculous and cheap."
1.0,"This a really weird fitting product. The sleeves are too long and baggy, but the body is too narrow and small.<br /><br />I'm 5'8&#34; and 175lbs with a noticeable belly and the small size looks horrible on me as my stomach sticks out. If I had bought the medium, the already long sleeves would just be comical.<br /><br />Also, the material is very stiff and not that comfortable. Not impressed."
1.0,"Does not stay up, weird material, barely stretchy. I returned it."
1.0,I wanted very badly to like this but it fit all wrong and was extremely see through even though it was very loose and baggy in many places.
1.0,Received the shirt last night opened it and the strings are already coming out of the top 3 buttons .. I’m afraid to even wash it now and it hasn’t been out of the bag more than 10 hours
1.0,"Loved the color and the belt however, I had to return it due to the fact that the sleeves were so short. It didn't match up with the length of the coat... Too bad, I really did like it."
1.0,"I ordered a medium, which is my normal size and this was waaaaay too big. The seams are on the outside and look weird. The pocket was basically in my armpit and the color was a pale yellow. I definitely wouldn't recommend this shirt. It just looks like a cheap poorly made shirt."
1.0,"Just got the shoes a few days ago. My daughter wore them once and the straps are already falling off on one shoe.  Do not buy, it is not a quality product."
1.0,Was very cheap and broke easily
1.0,"They look great.... BUT they don't work, my glasses keep slipping out, I constantly have to check them..."
1.0,"This product is awkward in size and shape, smells funny and leaves a grittiness on your hands after handling and took almost 3 months to arrive. Huge disappointment and I feel like I need to wash my hands a third time after handling the product."
1.0,"Washed one time, air dried and ripped."
1.0,"This dress is darling and modest! Sadly, it falls apart.  My daughter has worn this twice a month for 7 months and every time she wears it more of the seams fall apart, creating holes in the dress.  If the dress didn't fall apart, I would give this dress a solid 5 stars.  Very dissapointed."
1.0,"This dress is polyester and loose. I bought it for Christmas, but did not like the look on me at all. I bought a medium and am normall a medium. I returned it and bought another dress that was more what I was going for."
1.0,Honestly this can only be for little girls not women the packaging wasn't anything to write home about.Moreover I have purchased costume jwlery before for less which had a more heavier look and feel was sore disappointed when I saw the earrings I am still trying to wonder if the seller forget to send me the rest of the earrings. The life OK of it is flimsy and cheap looking hm people read the reviews it is helpful the picture is very deceptive won't recommend or will be buying again .
1.0,"too small, not long enough, maybe I chose the wrong type for a single piercing dangling earring."
1.0,"Waste of money - cheap and color turns quickly. You'll be lucky if you can wear it one day, if that."
1.0,Doesn't fit my ear. Doesn't bend to fit.
1.0,"The skirt is nice, and the wings are ok, but the bodice is terrible.  It is not attached and comes in several pieces, leaving the buyer to spend 45 minutes to lace up the front and back.  The silver is scratchy and cheep looking as well as the fake roses.  The tulle is nice, very fairy princess-like, and I tried another corset top to match a better looking outfit, but to no avail.  It was well packaged and arrived on time, but if the top were a little better quality, it would have been good for a Halloween costume."
1.0,Put this item up on Tuesday after a received  late and it literally just broke and fell down. So if I could give it 0 stars I would. Really crappy quality and not with anything
1.0,Too small<br />Cheap!
1.0,"The faceted charm itself is pretty, but the ring is dull and looks tarnished. I am returning it."
1.0,"Did not like these shoes. Ordered an 8.5, my regular size. They were a little too long in total length, but too short at the front - did not cover enough. Very uncomfortable also. Sent back."
1.0,"Costume jewlery, and the cheapest, ugliest kind."
1.0,Very small fit. Tiny on my chest (the elastic part didn't even cover half of my boobs) and the shirt itself was several inches shorter than I wanted.
1.0,These masks run too small! They barely got my 10yr olds face! Not as advertised!
1.0,"Nothing about this product worked. I received them on time but they were useless for runway style earrings. The shape is not easy to hold on , they are too small to help balance a larger or longer earring. That is the point, right.?"
1.0,This hat is awful... the first time I tried putting it on it broke and completely fell apart.. never again will I buy this hat from these people.. if I could give it no stars I would..
1.0,"poor quality, got what i paid for"
1.0,Was not right size.
1.0,The World Series decal is toooooooooooo small.  It looks like someone took a 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch logo and placed it on the dark black hat.
1.0,chuncky bottom and they are too heavy
1.0,These socks are really annoying because they keep coming off as you walk. They refuse to stay on your heel.
1.0,Mine arrived damaged
1.0,Insecure. Lost valuable sunglasses.
1.0,Paying for a product that says silver and arrives rusty is horrible I will never buy it again I hope you are not a robbery either
1.0,way to small but what did i expect for the price
1.0,Way to small. I’m usually and an 8-8 1/2. Bought an 8 and I couldn’t get my feet all the way in. Definitely size up one or even 2 sizes for comfort ! I retuned.
1.0,This picture does not reflect the item. It’s very small and very short. You would have to order four of these items to make it look like the image.
1.0,"It does look like the image online which I was excited about but the minute I pulled it out of the bag pieces fell off and the ring detached from the rest of the piece so the look fell apart. I had gotten it specifically for a themed gala which was later that night so I didn't have time to find a replacement.<br /><br />As accurate as the picture makes it, it was either not made well of I got a defunct one so it was a waste of money sadly."
1.0,It is definitely very cute but the quality of it sucks. The pin broke inside my galaxy watch so now I need to take it to the jeweler to be able to take the strap off. Not convenient at all. I had been using it for only 2 weeks.
1.0,This shirt is just an overall odd fit!
1.0,"Size was way smaller than advertised (like 2 sizes smaller), had to return. Zipper seemed cheap as the bottom clasp had hard time seating to even zip up."
1.0,It’s nothing like the picture. All the ruffles were on my boob it didn’t go to my belly button. The fabric was good tho. And if you buy too big it will be super baggy.
1.0,Shaw was huge. So you think the jersey would feel like a jersey. I got the youth size. I’m a big fat guy. Gave it to my wife
1.0,"In all fairness this swimsuit is extremely cute and seems to be well made. But the sizing is completely off. I did go by the size chart and I have a 56 I ended up ordering an extra large, and I can't even get it pulled up over my hips. So unfortunately I am having to return this item. I did receive this product at a discounted rate for my unbiased and honest review, but my opinions are my own. Please note that this review was helpful if anything that I wrote it all was of assistance."
1.0,I returned it.  It was very thin and felt and looked cheap.  I do not recommend.
1.0,Not linen. The label doesn’t even specify the fabric.
1.0,This item is expensive and useless. Dies nothing for keloids. Better buy nice earrings instead that do not fall off.
1.0,"Bought these for my son. Third time he wore them, the heel came off. The heels are just glued on. Quality is rather poor for the price. Unfortunately, by the time it came apart we were past the return date.<br />The extra glue on the boot ""leather"" in the pic was my son's attempt to repair them."
1.0,No fue el producto que esperaba! Un tono muy claro
1.0,Dress is completely transparent. More like a swim suit cover up. I have others that are a different t material and great but the black with white polka dots could not be work without  another dress underneath
1.0,I got a broken one in the mail but the box itself was unopened so I’m not sure if something happened in the mail or manufacturing process but I ended up wasting a tone of money for the saber I was able to get a refund thankfully and I ended up not needing it at all actually as a friend from Florida sent me one as a birthday gift
1.0,Does not stay in place as you sleep.
1.0,I hate it because they came really small. None of them fit on my fingers. I was very upset and i was actually scare of buying jewelry online because of that.
1.0,"This won’t work if your boobs are big. It isn’t sturdy at all, it is actually in the trash because it is useless."
1.0,not an xlarge.  gave it to my niece.
1.0,"#1 it is not a set.<br />#2 it is not a sweat shirt, it is a long sleeved tshirt.<br />#3 the sizes are not accurate. They run small."
1.0,"The middle of the sunglasses was scratched, looks like it’s broken.😩☹️"
1.0,It Is not off the shoulder more like a weird turtleneck 😆 lol I do not recommend!
1.0,"Don't waste your money. They dried out immediately. Resoaked, tried again. Not cool!!"
1.0,One earring has blue lines on the feathers. Looks like knock-off quality or just ones with defects.
1.0,There are only 48 stars on the flag. The graphic is stiff and makes the shirt fit awkwardly. Small size is way too big. Returning immediately.
1.0,"Looks cute online, but it comes in 2 sizes too small and it was very see through. Couldn't wear it..."
1.0,"These seemed great and my daughter loved them. I purchased on March 1st. Quick delivery however, they lasted for a month, that's it. The strap to tighten them unthreaded and they are now un wearable."
1.0,I ordered a small it was too long and wide for myself.
1.0,Poor workmanship
1.0,Hat say black when ordering it is not its black an silver which messes up my outside hat itself is made very well but wrong color
1.0,The XL is quite small in legs and buttocks. The waist gaps terribly.
1.0,Not happy with them.  They arrived bent and I can't wear them because they look crooked
1.0,It was supposed to be a nice mostly solid forest green. It's green and white striped. Disappointed.
1.0,Quality not what I expected. I will be returning it
1.0,not the best bag I have ever purchased.  Kind of flimsy for the money.
1.0,TOO SMALL! NOT EVEN CLOSE.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,"Very thin, like tights with pockets."
1.0,This shirt is not as pictured.  The actual shirt is very big & the material is thick & loose.  Not fitted as shown in the picture.  I ordered an XS and it was huge.  Quality is very poor.
1.0,Doesn’t stick at all. A waste.
1.0,"The buttons are terrible. They either fall apart, the guts fall out, or they can't be pried open at all.<br /><br />The material weights a ton! Very heavy for a pair of athletic or rehab shorts."
1.0,"Horrible quality, ridiculous fit<br />Too big and too short and cheap as can be<br />Garbage, very disappointed"
1.0,Material was stretch out in some areas
1.0,These gloves are very thin and had holes in them almost immediately after light use. I returned them.
1.0,"China made, enough said."
1.0,They are to big. Won’t order that style again. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Unfortunately, I bought 3 packages of these for my elementary-aged kids. After washing, Nearly all of the sewn in nose wires had migrated off-center and it’s impossible to push them back without poking a hole through the fabric. If you decide to purchase, make sure to anchor either side of the wire with a stitch or two. But I honestly wouldn’t bother with these."
1.0,The sizing is wrong????  The measurement includes the closure too small
1.0,"Not impressed and will be returning. The design was very clearly just ironed on, and not even ironed on well. The design has a weird texture and the shirt smelt odd. The checkered pattern on the truck was faded and barely there."
1.0,"I'm a fuller DD and this thing was ridiculously small.  Also the sticky stuff didn't stick at all.  I've purchased NuBra in the past, and though it's also too small, the sticky stuff on that product was WAAAY better.  Don't waste your money on this product unless you're an A cup.  Could work for that."
1.0,Shoe was great but these people are ridiculous! They charged me $64.99 restocking fee because I returned the shoes because they were too big! DON’T BUY!!!!
1.0,The sewing where the seams are joined is very shabby.  This vest is cute - and I was able to make some repairs to the shabby seams myself.  I will keep this vest - but I would not order any more of them.
1.0,These are cute but definitely way smaller than the pictures show.  They are tiny.
1.0,"Had we received the tie,  I may have been able to give it a good review. But what came in the mail instead was a box of miniature wooden maracas.......  our best man can not wear maracas during our wedding ceremony.  I will keep this item in mind, though, if we ever decide to have a Latin music night at home."
1.0,Small flemsy and a bit painfull.  Very loose it fell out and i lost it the frist two hours
1.0,"To small, more like a large than a 2XL. Second time you have done this to me."
1.0,Looked good taking out the box fit ok.they are supposed to be scratch and fog proof that is the reason I bought them which was to be used with my ATV. So I put them in my storage box  on the side of my ATV. I opened the box to get them out and low and behold the lens were scratched all up so needless to say they aren't scratch proof I didn't see anything in the box that should have scratched them they way they were. So I still have the clear lens okay they still have a use to me not to fast it had rained during the night and the ATV was in the rain and come to find out the boxes aren't water proof anyways moisture and dampness got on the goggles and well let's just say that they aren't fog proof either the lenses are dual lenses and the dampness got between the lens so now the goggles are completely useless to me I would not recommend them for anything other light use I'm very disappointed with the purchase of the goggles
1.0,There's a liner in the neckline that keeps creeping back out. The seams are not lined up well. I was hopeful but will be returning. Bummer.
1.0,"Material is fucken chip, I know the price is low but damn, this is 0 quality"
1.0,"Looks cheap, very poor quality."
1.0,Sizing was way off. Much smaller than expected.
1.0,"Socks NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN !<br />I tried them on and they are too big. I wanted to return them but it is not allowed.<br />Unbelievable ! First time EVER in many years of Amazon purchases that I am not allowed to return an item.<br />If I had known, I would NOT have bought them.<br />DO NOT BUY as you cannot be certain they will suit your needs unless you already own a pair !"
1.0,Instead of Marijuana the heart said Marlijuana
1.0,Followed the directions for washing and color bleed all over white. Dress is pink now not white. Terrible.
1.0,This just didn't fit too small at the waist too large at the top.
1.0,I would really like a replacement since the ones sent to me were very sub par at best. The arms to the sunglasses were &#34;peeling&#34; off some type of black paint or something as soon as I got them out of the pouch. I wore them one time. and I feel that was a waste of money.
1.0,"I really wish I would’ve taken a photo of this trash before I sent it back… so for that, I’m sorry. These slippers are nowhere near the same as the photo. They came flat and lifeless in a vacuum sealed bag, but once they came out, they didn’t come back to life. I was honestly shocked when I got them. Shocked AND depressed. 😢"
1.0,This hat is made in china and that's the reason for the 1 star rating...it's also not adjustable at all
1.0,Huge. Not as pictured.
1.0,"The color is just right but the fabric is thin, the fit is awful to the point where the front is on the side. The pocket points need to be reattached.  Very disappointed."
1.0,Misleading!
1.0,"I recieved this package, it was soggy wet. And stunk"
1.0,"Loved it for two months, but now even the slightest bump disconnects the pins on one side and the watch falls off. Wish I could return it!"
1.0,Did not fit wrist
1.0,"I do not believe this has much, if any cotton."
1.0,No give in the material and will not go on my daughter's foot!
1.0,Fits wayyy to tight!!!!
1.0,"Very strong toxic smell! I didn't let my daughter to put it on, smell like a poison! In other review I see somebody say it's smell ""a little plastiky"", no it's not a little it's smell very strong, don't buy to your kids this boots! There are many other boots available!<br />I left the boots outside of my house, even in 10 days it's smells so strong from a few feets away!"
1.0,"The fit is not what you see in the pictures, didn’t like how it fit, too loose and long, liked the color but didn’t like the style, and the waistline, will return!"
1.0,Too much money for a cheap product
1.0,Turns my finger green :-(
1.0,"They look like Slenderman hands, made from material thinner than pantyhose. Do not buy."
1.0,"This ring is nothing like the picture, I sent it back right away. The so called ""diamonds"" are very tiny where you can barely see them, and fake. The ring is definitely not sterling silver, and has a fake appearance. Very light in weight, too light...The design is mushed into one blob and the middle diamond is no bigger than the smaller ones. I could seriously go buy a better ring in a quarter machine. And to top it off the shipping took forever so by the time it arrived I was no longer excited. I'm disappointed you waisted my time."
1.0,This purse is very low quality.  Zipper does not always work its hard to open or close.
1.0,Never worn. Washed once and all the straps broke.
1.0,HORRIBLE!!  I purchased the right size but they tore on the first wear.
1.0,Did not like the material and poor quality. Some seams started to give after a few times wear.
1.0,Poor quality and material. The size was much smaller than expected.
1.0,Runs extremely small.  Returned it.
1.0,Very cheaply made and material looks cheap. The bottoms are two sizes smaller than the top. Would not recommend.
1.0,The item I received was NOT a dress: it was a mid hip tunic! I ordered according to instructions and still wound up with something I could not wear
1.0,The concept of the earrings were cute however they are very cheaply made. The gold areas look tarnished and you can see all the glue used for the rhinestone.
1.0,Never worked out of the box.  I suspect I need to buy a battery...
1.0,Was extremely unhappy with the shipping time on this item. From day of order it took 2 months to get to my door. I ordered a larger based on previous reviews. The body of the jacket is definitely sized large.. but the arms are extremely short and tight around. Don’t buy this. Not worth the frustration and disappointment.
1.0,"I’m not sure if the seller changed manufacturers but I was beyond disappointed in this item. Looked NOTHING like the pictures. Cut was super short, turtle neck was not chunky, material was scratchy and overall it was just poorly-constructed and made. If it looked anything like the pics I would have kept it. What I received looked like crappy doll clothing."
1.0,These would be ok if my head was twice as big as it is.  The clips are so far apart they cover the middle of my lenses.  They’re even too big for my husband.
1.0,The bracelets were great but one fell apart after just one week.
1.0,received the pedant but no necklace
1.0,"I loved this coat, super warm, soft, fit perfectly but the zipper was very cheap and broke in a week!"
1.0,El cheapo deluxe.  I wouldn't wear this in public.
1.0,Broke before I could even wear it. Very disappointed.
1.0,does not fit according to size. runs very small. waste of money.
1.0,Ordered this shirt according to the sellers size chart and what I got was a tent! Not worth sending back as a trip to the post office is a REAL pain so basically I just the away the money I spent on it.
1.0,"Did not work, it was not accepted by the Keuring coffee maker. A message popped up that said that it was not a Keurig recognized product."
1.0,Too small;  I had to return it.  Material is very poor quality...Polyester/Shower-curtain...
1.0,"Lovely finish on a stainless steel band, but the latch failed, and was repaired by my local jeweler, but then it came apart at the mount to the fitbit and is unrepairable. Seller closed up shop before the return window closed and I got stuck."
1.0,I read the reviews and bought 1-2 sizes up. Received the dress and it’s still waaaay to small. It actually fits my 10 year old daughter who wears a child’s size 14.
1.0,"I ordered them for my son, school project. way too big for him and way too big for anyone. I do not recall seeing the oversized when I placed the order."
1.0,"This is not a mask for any use. It is a single ply piece of cheap material, two pieces of cloth sewn together with an opening at each end. This must have cost them 10 cents to make. Raw edges. Stretchy but not really breathable. Easily falls down on hair in back of head.  NOTE:  you must have at least two ply of material to be a mask you can wear in a store. Otherwise there is no protection for the other person. Additionally it is not good for dust either as the dust would cover the cloth and you would, because it is a single piece, breath the dust into your mouth. A total rip off  which came a month after the 20 day maximum."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:87f32764f239b2ec7eca1db3952f02a5]] (Please see video to see extra little floppity-floop of material.) Perhaps the Gods bestowed this tank upon me thinking I was a legendary warrior of old, impervious to mortal wounds and wielding a dime-sized-third-nipple that glistened in the sunlight and distracted my enemies — alas, I am but a two nippled mortal so the extra material on this tank just looks like shi. Bummed because I actually love lifting in the other two that came in this pack."
1.0,This device does not hold the fitbit securely.  I lost my fitbit within a week of wearing.
1.0,"You can see straight through this dress, idc how busy it is, and the material is hot."
1.0,This dress was terrible. Similar to picture but fit nothing like the picture. Waste of time and money. Don’t bother purchase
1.0,Dont reccomend
1.0,Package says 20 inches but measured 16. I bought to wear under my scolibrace. Impossible to get on. Must be for children but wasn’t indicated on description. Trying the Large and says for adults but measures are still small in size chart.
1.0,Overpriced!
1.0,The only thing that resembled the picture was the color. Thin and not meant to be worn as a stand alone sweater. Returned expeditiously!
1.0,This skirt was really tight at 2x and really short.  I was so excited to receive it and so sad when I tried it on.  I'll be returning it today.
1.0,"Terribly quality, sleeves too short, and very cheep looking."
1.0,The glasses did not meet expectations. They offered no magnification at all. Bison was the same with or without them on.
1.0,"This dress ended up being way too big. I'm 5'6&#34;, 120 lbs, 32 inch bust, waist 26, and hips 38 so I got the small. The waist was too loose so the dress looked really baggy on me, it gave me serious granny dress vibes. I also found the shoulders to be really constricting, and I don't think my shoulders would be considered particularly wide. I put it though the washer and dryer hoping it would shrink, but alas it remained the same size."
1.0,Now I bought these a while ago and forgot to do anything about it. I could not figure out how to get the backs off or they just gave me a pair that couldn’t separate.  I do not know I should’ve done something at the time but I forgot.
1.0,Fragile. Cheap build cheap appearance.
1.0,"Fits just right , needs better cushion, but working on the yard my socks did got weat."
1.0,"After very little usage of this belt, one of the pins completely fell out of the buckle assembly and became lost.  This caused the belt to come loose and fail to function while being worn!!  Reliability of this belt is EXTREMELY suspect. I still have multiple old belts from other belt manufacturers that have held up for many, many years.  I wanted to try a 'click' belt which offered some more freedom to click to perfect length, but this belt didnt even last a couple months!!<br /><br />I guess I have to go back to traditional style belts which offer RELIABILITY and wont FAIL to work while being worn.  This issue could have become very EMBARRASSING had this occurred in an important social setting or during a meeting/presentation at my job!!!!!"
1.0,"Don't bother, these are cheap material, don't stay in and are not worth the money."
1.0,The fabric is cheap and it turns white when stretched the pockets lay weird and give a odd shape
1.0,Poor quality not worth your money.
1.0,As with all of the other reviewers... the fit is way smaller and the chain length and quality are poor.  Not a good use of money.
1.0,This thing is tiny and doesn’t blend up things like celery
1.0,Nice watch. Too bad it doesn't work. No instructions on how to get it to work properly
1.0,It is far too short for average persons usage. I will be returning it.
1.0,"It aint a 3 pack, got one shirt. Change title of product"
1.0,Watch band is constantly coming undone where it clips into the watch. Cannot use because I'm afraid it will come undone and hit the ground or get lost.
1.0,Material was thin and the size was 3/4 sizes smaller than anticipated.
1.0,"I really wanted to love these earmuffs! On the GOOD side they are very cozy, fluffy and warm feeling. Unfortunately the particular ones I received seemed OLD and if not worn then worn-OUT! The fabric on the outside was supposed to be pink but this was clearly FADED and DISCOLORED all over. Also the binding was not well sewn and was coming loose in places. I've posted pictures. What I'm describing doesn't show up as well in the pictures as what I could see but you'll get the idea. I believe if you get a pair that is NEW and ""FRESH"" then you'll be happy but I had to send these back as they seemed like they were the bottom of the barrel...literally! TOO BAD, because otherwise they were OK!"
1.0,Tela orrible no la compren
1.0,Bought these for my daughter who got to wear them twice before turning her fingers green and the ring itself discolored. She did NOT wear them in water. Altho it shouldn't matter they are supposed to be stainless steel. They are NOT. Cheap material waste of money.
1.0,"Not durable, perfect size but zipper broke before muy first trio ended needed to pay to wrap it at the aerport."
1.0,Solo recibí 10 no era un paquete de 50<br />Como decía
1.0,Very very large and not easy to tell it's a wing. I was very disappointed in it.<br />Edit: The wing came off the stem. Another review said they had the same problem.
1.0,There's a reason they never just show the jacket without being adjusted it looks like a cat attacked the sweater and when you put it on it was a rag very disappointed
1.0,Cheap look and feel.
1.0,Fits really strange on the boobs. Made me look pregnant
1.0,To short of a chain
1.0,No me llego estoy muy triste por que yo e ordenado y no me llega lo que ordeno
1.0,Don't wash it it fell apart!!!!
1.0,Chain was kinked and also had a sharp link that cut your skin. Returned for refund.
1.0,Para adultos está bien pero para niños no
1.0,This band will not reach around your wrist even if you remove the skin first
1.0,Very disappointed with the fabric. Was all wrinkled upon arrival. Time consuming to get it to look presentable. Could not give this dress as a gift.
1.0,"Weird cut, the bodice should end just below the bust, but it ends above the bust."
1.0,The Large was not a normal large size.  Would not order again.
1.0,"They are made for small figured people apparently. If you are athletic at all or have any kind of size in your arms, they wont fit."
1.0,This didn’t even hold up for a one hour kids Halloween party.
1.0,Absolutely  horrible the dress in the picture is nothing like the dress received except it is white lace. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.
1.0,"The headline says set of 6, you will get one pair of over priced junk that broke upon the first use. Do not waste your money, keep scrolling to get an actual set of 6."
1.0,"Had to throw away after first use.  Much smaller than the size stated.  Inexpensive, so did not return."
1.0,Poor quality changed color after 1 wear
1.0,I ordered a men's 2XL raincoat.  It appeared to be a woman's coat as the zipper was on the wrong side.  It was too small.
1.0,Ended up returning due to being too small. Buckle was in a very unflattering place
1.0,I dont want it shipping is long not worth it
1.0,I sent it back.<br />The ring doesn't look gold or sliver.
1.0,Very thin and not a true white.  Had ad pink hue to them.
1.0,"Unfortunately the band is bent and don’t fit the watch, it also came with a rip on the side. I was so upset since I bought it to wear on New Years"
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:4ed9ac1ea4378d1b5ba37399d8be9aec]] The leather is of good quality, but the zipper constantly locks and gets tangled with the fabric, which is extremely annoying. Both inside pockets are too small to hold a phone, and the overall inside organization of the bag is not well designed. The customer service is horrible. I contacted Augus multiple times via whatisup and e-mail. I sent them pictures and videos but never got any response. Overall - big disappointment."
1.0,The product was too small and there was no return label.
1.0,These are not padded like it states!!! Total waist of money.
1.0,You have to be kidding me - I ordered and XL for myself for my arms and my 10 yr old can barley fit her shoulders in it.....this needs to be marked as a petite tiny midget small person shirt not women’s .... return!
1.0,Ran TTS<br />STRIPES WERE CROOKED
1.0,"The first time I tried to wear this necklace, the pendant came unglued and fell off of the small silver piece that hung on the necklace.  Not happy."
1.0,I specifically paid more for metal because of the amount of use they'll get on fleet vehicle keys. But they are made of plastic which will break much faster!
1.0,I only wore them for about 4 hours before I noticed a tiny hole forming... by the 8 hour mark there were probably 6. So disappointing bc I was so happy when I first put them on.  They were soft and think enough that you couldn't see through them at all... and then destroyed before the day was over bc of how cheaply made they are.
1.0,"Terrible fit, discoloration, poor look. Waste of money."
1.0,If your foot is as wide as the narrow side of a 2x4 then these are for you :)  The sides of the heel were digging into my heel.  Way too tight and too small even ordering up.  Returned immediately.
1.0,"Cheap, flimsy material. Would never buy from this vendor again ."
1.0,Mother still ain't used !
1.0,2XL HA!! maybe in munchkinland
1.0,"buyer beware, it maybe a good product but noone in the house ordered it.  Received numerous orders of the product"
1.0,Way way to small my  niece loves them but there even midis on her
1.0,This shirt looks nothing like the picture. It's very dull looking. I bought the wine colored one. It just looked frumpy. I returned it.
1.0,Bought this for a wedding.  During the wedding noticed that the fringe was literally falling off.  Lost half the fringe and haven't worn it again.  Regret buying it.
1.0,Returned. Fit was terrible.
1.0,It does not fit on the ear! Very disappointed
1.0,I read the reviews... I said &#34;theyll fit me&#34;... they didnt.  XL must mean extra lean.... Fools like me must be keeping them in business.  Bought others from a well known brand here that are perfect.
1.0,the  spring load that holds your watch broke in the first few days of use. I now struggle every time I use it. Next time will look for a more durable winder.
1.0,the lens chipped easily. disappointed!
1.0,"The shape is off and the sizing is off. The sleeves are disproportionately small compared to the cost, and I ordered an XL but it fit like a small, which U.S. what I normally wear. Trash product"
1.0,"This is crap!!! It looks like a child made this. Material is cheap, not even flattering! Super disappointed!"
1.0,These charms were broken just like the first order.<br />I am tired of ordering them so I just brought glue and glued them myself hope it work out
1.0,These were horrible quality! I ordered two pairs and both zippers were almost impossible to zip/unzip. The fabric and cut wasn’t much better. The quality was so poor that I returned both.
1.0,"Horrible shipping, product and return time. Save your money and dont order this bag. However if you feel you must have it order directly from the wish app where this along with many other bags currently being sold on Amazon are sold at a much cheaper price."
1.0,Cheaply made costume....didn't hold up a week
1.0,Awful see though and cheap. Not even worth $5. They are t-shirt fabric. Not meant to be worn as pants at all. Disappointed
1.0,Cheap metal made my neck break pit
1.0,"Not at all like pictured, dress was short and cheap material."
1.0,I was very unsatisfied with the quality... it pilled before I even put it in the wash. I would not buy this again :(
1.0,This was see through
1.0,Way too huge
1.0,I liked it till the pin came out and I can't find it to fix it. Lasted maybe a month. Ugh.
1.0,This dress is nothing like the picture. The fabric is pretty weird also.
1.0,"Very cute, but broke one day after my return window closed. 😟 I’m very careful with my jewelry no matter how much it cost. Very disappointing!"
1.0,I was supposed to get the 2 ok deal and only received 1 pair
1.0,Tried on two different shoes. Over night soaked both of them for at least 10 hours. Nothing changed. All it did was leave more yellow water marks than before and the stains didn’t budge
1.0,I was disappointed it was not the color like the one above! It is very small and not very good quality!
1.0,After the 1st wash this item had holes on the lower part of the leg - had they not already been worn & washed I would have returned -
1.0,No way these are mens sized
1.0,Although the quality and look is great the fit was way off. It wasn’t deep at all and looks like a beenie on my huge head.
1.0,Cute!! but lost the opal within ten minutes of having on
1.0,Broke right after I walked down the isle.
1.0,This dress is not as it is picture. It was the cheapest material and very shiny. It was ill fitting and I would recommend purchasing another dress.
1.0,This was a bit too short on me and way too itchy. It also smelled weird
1.0,"I washed the hat after I received it as I do for nearly everything new - due to COVID - on gentle cycle and it tore to shreds. UNBELIEVABE!! This is a piece of crap. Don't buy it and certainly never wash it!!!!!  It was described as a winter hat and the fabric is thin and good only for warm summer weather, of course as long as you do not wash it."
1.0,Came with black spots and not accurate measurement.  Taking it to pandora dealer to see if its fake or not.
1.0,This product is not of standard sizing.  I measured them against my daughters youth xl shorts and they’re the same size.  Not honest in description.
1.0,"Way too big, fall off my face"
1.0,"Don’t fall for the scam. They are NOT 2 carats. They are puny, cheap quality earrings, not worth $10.00<br />The stone itself is nothing to write home about. They are so small and the prongs look like those cheap things you’d see on cheap earrings at a thrift shop. In fact, I’ve seen better quality at those stores come to think of it. Can you tell I detested these earring?<br />The metal was a grayish, tin looking color. The backings were a joke, good luck trying to get them on, I had to force them on and wondered if I didn’t bend one of them a little, also loosening the stone on the left side trying to get them off again.<br />This is false advertisement for sure because what you see is quite the opposite of what you’re going to get.<br />If you desire a little quality pass these up! Obviously I am returning them tomorrow at first light of day. Good riddance and I’ll never take another chance with this company."
1.0,Item runs extremely small! Attempted to return item and was offered a small fraction of purchase price from seller.
1.0,"Check size chart and measure under. Ordered my usual bra size and when product was delivered, even with size extender, the bra was too small. Go up a size, or two or three."
1.0,Not stainless steel. Plating came off in less than a week. False advertising.
1.0,-not corduroy<br />-horrible material in inside<br />-pockets feel like crap
1.0,The color of this shirt wasn't even close to what it should have been and it isn't eligible for returns.
1.0,The cut and color was ALL wrong.. Returned
1.0,"the item i got was a poor fake, and was not even the same style. the leather was fake, the buckles were<br />smaller than what is photographed, the dimensions are 1 inch smaller than stated, and the lining is some plastic fabric.<br /><br />sent that crap back. i suggest you dont buy from this company."
1.0,"Terrible material, funny smell, poorly constructed!  The seams that separate the color blocks stick out and are super itchy. The pink/mauve color was more of a light, pale pink. Not even close to what the picture shows."
1.0,Poor quality. Stitching came undone. Wrinkles easily. Essentially a square piece of fabric with a hole in the neck.
1.0,The pant or made of a shine fabric and badly made
1.0,"This is kids sizing. Ordered a small for my size 2 in juniors daughter. It is more like a size 8 in little girls clothing. I then sent it back and ordered a medium, and it was still too small and like a little girl size 10. The other big issue is that Prime made me pay to ship the medium back to the tune of $6. Unacceptable and I want my money back!"
1.0,"I ordered this looking at the sizing in the table.  IT it 4"" past the floor and I am 5'9""  the material on the top doesn't lay flat it is puffy and poorly sewn.  There were no tags, no sizes anywhere on the garment.  It is not worth $10.  Sending it back.  Terrible quality item."
1.0,I am unhappy one of my legs is broken bent in
1.0,I give this product 1 star bc the left slide came apart after a week of wear !!! They were very comfortable and are true to size but poorly made !! I am very disappointed that I only had them for a week but hey that’s why i should of just got the Ugg’s in the first place instead of being cheap
1.0,"Had to give away.😏 Needed a large. Didn't hear back from company.It arrived in a timely fashion. Material , color and pattern looks and ferls of quality and length was great. I am 5 7 1/2 over 200lbs ordered a extra large. Was to big."
1.0,They’re fake
1.0,I bought twice I'm very disappointed
1.0,"It looks dull, rusty and extremely small. Would return if my sister hasn’t tried to put it on. Would not buy again."
1.0,I bought this necklace a few months ago. I LOVE this necklace however it turned BLACK I researched online and found a suggestion to clean it with toothpaste. This worked however EVERY SINGLE time I wear it....it turns black. I have plenty of other silver jewelry that has never tarnished or turned black. I have no idea why this keeps tarnishing. If the necklace didn't turn black I would rate it 5 stars. I wouldn't recommend buying this product.....I'm looking to buy one in white gold instead.
1.0,This is the most flimsy piece of material I ever purchased. Further the window for return should have been extended because of #covid. I would pay no more than 5.00<br />DO NOT BUY THIS - YOU can spend the same money at Macy's and get something nice.
1.0,"These fit the guns but they hurt like hell to get hit with. If you have young boys, they WILL shoot each other, even if you tell them not to and these bullets cause more problems than the good price is worth."
1.0,"Cheap material, I definitely got what I paid for!!!!"
1.0,The shoe material is defective.  After one half day of school Sept.4th this shoe totally started peeling.
1.0,I order this coverup in pink. The fit was correct but the cost of this cover-up doesn't match the quality. The material it is made from is pretty normal and I don't feel that it was worth spending $35 on. I wish I could have returned it but I needed a cover-up desperately for a trip and there was no time to return and reorder one.
1.0,I couldn't put my foot in it
1.0,This was much larger than expected.  Thin fabric
1.0,"They don't heat at all. They are good socks, but the heat bit is fake. Am returning now."
1.0,Unless you plan to have them custom make to your sizes they’re going for a one size fits all. Price is good but if spend double that for alterations to make it look good. The tie defies in back Instead of zipper gives corset feel. Don’t waste your time or money.
1.0,When receiving the order the socks where damp with moister inside the sealed package . When opening the package you could feel the wetness in the socks .The paper band on the socks was wet also . I also noticed when looking at the 5 pairs 2 pairs where a different size compared to the other 3 pairs ... Socks where not too small there was no correct box to click on how the product actually did fit  . Socks where returned ..
1.0,"Three hoodies, graphic IRON ON defective on each! Was described at “EMBROIDERED”. No embroidery at all! Cheap iron on I could have done on my Cricut."
1.0,The shirt fits great except for the shoulder length. So if you have tiny collar bones this is perfect for you. Unfortunately I (and most people) don't so the shirt becomes pointed lady Gaga shoulders whenever you lift up your arms. If I sized up the rest of the shirt would be too large.
1.0,"Got these for grandkids, way too big, and would not work, mechanism to make ears flip was smashed"
1.0,very disappointed in the sizing. the quality and look are very nice but I ordered a large and it fit me like a small or extra small would normally fit. This purchase makes me skeptical of buying clothes from Amazon now.
1.0,It was not true to size as stated. I like color but so disappointed with the dress. I can’t show a picture because the item doesn’t come close to fitting.
1.0,"I am 5'1&#34; 115lbs, petit frame. I was lost in it. It is a very heavy fabric. I don't recommend it unless you have large frame over all."
1.0,I could write all day how disappointed I am bought these for my husband and he couldn’t even fit his big toe in these…so obviously being sarcastic but you get the point..literally a child age 5 can fit these socks!!!
1.0,Diamonds extremely small. Was very disappointed ended up returning the ring. Size is definitely off.
1.0,These are more or less worthless.  The shine or reflection make them nearly impossible to see through.
1.0,It was not very well put together
1.0,It came in a box which was two inches shorter than the hat and so narrow that the hat was so crushed nothing could get it back in shape.  If that was not bad enough the hat is so small it could not fit a child's head.  Sent back
1.0,Not really a mask. It's nothing. A very very thin layer that doesn't really stick to your face. It's kinda loose in the air. Wouldn't recommend if your safety matters to you.
1.0,"I wore this shirt literally 2 times, now it is no good and its going in the trash. All the letters are peeling off as you can see in my photos. I loved this shirt when I originally got it and I love what it said but unfortunately it didn't last very long. This was a big waste of money and I do not recommend this item."
1.0,Fits very loose on my head and screw has already fallen out of arm
1.0,I had these sunglasses for a week before they broke. They literally broke when I was putting them on. I was not rough with them or anything! Very disappointing as they were very cute.
1.0,Horrible quality. Also insanely difficult to put on because of the double layer. Very annoyed!
1.0,I was very unhappy with this dress. It's hard to tell the front from the back and it's too big all over. I will be returning.
1.0,I ordered the 2XL size for shoe size 13-16. I couldnt even put my toes in them.
1.0,Fits poorly; just a shapeless t-shirt with long sleeves.. Rather cheap looking .Not worth the package it was shipped in!
1.0,The product didn’t arrived only the bag was opened wen pick up at the mail box
1.0,"This was supposed to be a women's medium- it's more like a CHILDS medium.  Very thin, almost indecent fabric anc CHEAP.  comes from Hong Kong.  Don't buy it."
1.0,This is not compatible with the fenix 6 it is made for a the garmin vivio active
1.0,This belt was not true to size.
1.0,"I weigh 115 lbs and am 5’2. This was way to small, I ended up giving it to my 10 year old. I haven’t even washed it and dried it yet, so let’s hope it does shrink. Kind of disappointed."
1.0,Fabric is very flimsy
1.0,shrek green and felt like a dive suit.
1.0,Did not work as claimed.  Will be returning product.
1.0,"I ordered the green pair for my daughter to be a Luna Moth, but they are NOT green. They are teal."
1.0,Fell apart after one use.  Seemed like a great idea and worked well for that one use but it is cheaply made and came undone at the seems.
1.0,I give it zero stars.
1.0,Dress was too loose at the top hung off me never have problems with wearing a small especially not it not fitting right low quality cheaply stitched very disappointed this was supposed to be worn for mother’s day now I don’t have a dress.
1.0,"Need to wear long shirt with them, can see underwear."
1.0,"Too thin, fragile."
1.0,"Looks cheap, the single horizontal strip was sewn crooked..."
1.0,I loved the look and feel of material. But after I wore it one day it pulled all over. Very disappointed.
1.0,Will return. Not what was expected.
1.0,only about 50% work. Believe either the on/off button is triggered in packaging or batteries are depleted.
1.0,The lens popped out after one week. Very cheap.
1.0,"Was not what was advertised, cheap poorly made and doesn't fit ANY bracelet.  Do not order from this company - go with Pugster"
1.0,I bought this to clean some spots (from water/oil/who knows) on black nubuck boots. It did nothing.
1.0,Washed these once and all of the bows fell off! Awful quality.
1.0,The item was huge!! Like 3x bigger<br />😒😒😒
1.0,At first I gave these pants a 4 star because of the size BUT now after a month of purchase I have to give it a 1 star. The pants have turn in to a mess after a couple of washes. Unbelievable I can’t even get my money back because is past the month 😩
1.0,Hole torn near pocket.  Just slept in one night! This is unacceptable
1.0,Very unattractive and cheap looking.
1.0,"terrible work, ordered the silver and you can see the discoloration when the cut it.  i dont recommend buti"
1.0,"I had these for a month before they started to fall apart. I walked over an icy snow bank and the treading began to chip off. Also, they were not warm. I'm very disappointed in these. I went to Kohl's and got some Totes boots that are warm and it only cost an extra $25. I'll be asking for a refund and posting a picture."
1.0,"Ordered these and received white sunglasses with wings, which really wasn't the look I was going for. Probably just a one-time packaging mistake, but still very annoying."
1.0,"Worse than silver, rusted in a week, looks obviously fake, didn't fit straight or stay in place, horrible quality."
1.0,It broke within the first week....don't get it wet at all
1.0,Didn’t like quality so I gave it to my great granddaughter to play with!
1.0,"Pieace of junk fell apart upon trying on.  Chain popped, dropped an earring and the pearl fell out.  Got what I paid for I guess."
1.0,"Broken when arrived. Couldn’t even give it to my daughter who was so excited for her new umbrella. If I could give 0stars, I would!"
1.0,These are not lite and I wore them once and the beads started coming off one of them.
1.0,"Save your $50+ and purchase the Disney version which is far superior to this one. The shiny one in this photo looks off only because it was photographed at an angle. I received the shiny one as a gift AFTER I purchased this one off Amazon so unfortunately, I'm past the return window."
1.0,Pin broke on install. This had to be the cheapest band I've ever tried. It's horrible
1.0,Ripped the first time I tried to put them on. Was disappointed they were so small as well.
1.0,These were very cheap looking... totally not worth what was paid for them.
1.0,The worst smell imaginable. I have tried everything to remove the odor and it still smells.
1.0,Too big waist was way off
1.0,"Would never buy again, obviously"
1.0,Came in crunched. Had a crease in front because of it.
1.0,Bought these for Nike sneakers. The laces are so wide they would barely squeeze through the shoe's holes.  Then to tighten laces was a pain. Do not recommend.
1.0,It fell apart when I opened it... Don't waste your time and money
1.0,"I usually fit into a medium but knowing SheIn is a store from China I sized up to a large. I finally got the jacket, everything fit comfortably except for the sleeves. It felt as though the sleeves were made for size xs or s. I was really disappointed since this was the only tweed jacket I could find in a nice style on amazon."
1.0,"Beads were broken, returned for refund."
1.0,Product was poorly constructed and too small.
1.0,can not be cleaned.  took it dry cleaners and the red bled
1.0,"Gave this piece of junk as a gift,<br />didn't even last 4 months.<br />AVOID!!!"
1.0,"I received it on a Friday, and when I wore it Saturday and Sunday, by Sunday morning it was torn from the seam at the bottom of the band of the shorts . I’m returning them."
1.0,Wayyy too big for a one year old and the snaps don't stay closed. Looks like it was drawn on with a Sharpie. Bought this as an alternative to a party hat for a first birthday. Useless.
1.0,This is the worse product I've ever bought on Amazon. Very cheap. Too small even after sizing up. The material is horrible. Disappointed
1.0,"I bought this product for 2 reason:<br />1) to have goggles that allow to wear glasses<br />2) wanted to protect the glasses and/or goggles from fogging<br /><br />Both failed, miserably.<br /><br />I timed it. 10-15 min into normal paced walk (no glasses, wearing contacts) - and you can remove these and throw them in the garbage. They fog, and are useless after because you cant see where you going."
1.0,Rabbit fell off first day of wearing the bracelet.
1.0,"Looks super cheap when I received.  Both were bent in different shapes.  Not cute, would not wear or recommend."
1.0,"It looked like a returned pair , sock did not look like a new pressed sock, it was poorly repackaged into a small plastic bag,  and had no makers  package information or name.<br />Cannot comment on wear -- I did not try it on--"
1.0,Had this for 2 months and it statted coming apart. Not happy and of course I can't return it. False advertising cause it's definitely not leather. Amazon should watch the products they sell.
1.0,"Used this for a vacation -- going through busy airports, scanners, etc.  Seemed to work from that perspective, however, it is very small and does not open wide enough to easily access items.  The pockets for putting bills out of sight are very tight and fit very few bills.  Very limited capacity and inconvenient to use."
1.0,Just collecting dust I don’t have time to send back or I would have
1.0,Very soft shirt but advertised as red as is it should be. Ordered this to wear to a picnic on the 4th of July. This shirt is actually HOT PINK. Needless to say I did not wear it. Used as a lounge shirt now.
1.0,Very very stretchy thin material. Cheap quality. Not as represented in photos. I will not wear this.
1.0,"Great shoe, but came defective....I was about to use it for a trip and unfortunately, due to this issue, I will not be able to keep my shoe...What a hassle..."
1.0,Product was wayyyyyy too big and very thin
1.0,"This dress seemed well made and was very pretty, but high neck was very tight, almost unable to breath. I am a 5'2, 130lbs with an athletic build so I was not impressed by the small fit of this dress. I normally order a medium in most clothes but ordered a large based on reviews and yet still was too tight fitting. Disappointed."
1.0,"This product fits horribly. It’s nice material comfortable, but the fit is so distorted it’s ridiculous. The length doesn’t go with the width."
1.0,The most ill fitting garment I have ever purchased on Amazon. The length does not cover my booty: I am 5'6. The fit is like a child size XL. Terrible terrible sizing on this garment.
1.0,"Was sent the wrong size for starters. The fabric is very thin. The zipper is almost non functioning, poor quality. Pretty color but Returning."
1.0,This is NOT a KF94 mask! Very cheaply made. Looks like a mini-pad with wings! I doubt very much if this cheap mask would protect ANYONE from the Covid or Delta Virus. No not buy these. These are obviously fakes. I am returning them. The company IK-Tech Co Ltd in South Korea doesn't even sell masks!!! This is a bogus company!! Buyer beware.
1.0,Returning this dress because it is nothing like pictured. It’s completely see thru and made of a cheap uncomfortable material. Tried to make it work but it just looks like a see thru table cloth.
1.0,"Just got this item. It didn’t have a smell to it, but it is not high quality. The inside pockets are made of some sort of very thin plastic feeling material. I’m not wanting to put a pen uncapped in the pockets in fear of tearing them, it’s that thin.<br />The measurements are for the outside of the item. The inside is smaller than advertised.<br />Due to the high temps here in Arizona, I don’t think this item would last very long. Aside from all the plastic it uses, you’d have huge sweat stains from where the bag was preventing your skin from getting air.<br />Did the manufacture change the materials used on the newer version of the bag? I can’t really understand why people are saying this is a high quality item."
1.0,Bad color if your undertone is pink
1.0,Nice material but too small
1.0,That's is too big don't have opportunity for change a small please i need only middle calf
1.0,Inferior material inferior product
1.0,It has bad smell of plastic used in mask
1.0,I bought 2 as Christmas presents and 6 months later they are both breaking apart with normal every day use as a Keychain. The screws are coming out and the spring loaded clasps are going wonky so they don't line up to fully close anymore.
1.0,"Received them too late to return, since it was a birthday gift.  Hardly any turquoise!!! In the pic, the turquoise is evenly distributed throughout the hoop, but the ones I received had very little, mostly the other bland material. Will never buy from this source again."
1.0,It was a crop top not as pictured not what I wanted
1.0,I am 5’8” and it came just past my knees. Not at all what thr pic looks.<br />Sending back
1.0,Tried many times with other people and non of us could see the difference.
1.0,Plus size but still runs too small! Disappointed
1.0,This is not what I received.  I received silver clips that are heavy and small
1.0,It broke a month after I purchased it.
1.0,"Wore them at night and the only difference was that the headlights are yellow instead of white.  Does not reduce glare.  My wife tried them in case it was just my eyes, but she agrees."
1.0,Faded after washing first time!
1.0,"The material wasn't as nice as I thought it would be..very short an I'm 5'5"",  3-4"" off the floor. I'm a large but the large was to big ..<br />170lbs"
1.0,Thin and smaller than other socks I’ve bought in this size
1.0,The material is stiff and size runs really small. I ordered a size up and it was still way to small. My 97 lb 10 yr old daughter couldn't fit into the xl It's just like cheap Halloween custom fabric.
1.0,Not at all as described. Very cheap and peplum too high.
1.0,I liked the look of this watch while it was still intact but it only lasted a month. Very convenient that the return window was 1 month long.
1.0,"I really wanted to like this shirt, but for those who wear standard bras, there is no way that it doesn't show through in the front and where the open gaps are located.  I opted to use the free returns and sent it back."
1.0,after wearing watch three times it started changing colors !
1.0,Not the same colors as pictured. Very disappointing.
1.0,Much smaller than it supposed to be! If you want a medium order a 3X.
1.0,turned my rist green in a day
1.0,"Horrible quality, cheap, paper thin and completely see through."
1.0,The shirt I ordered my husband was a large and it is way too big. Seems to be an XXL by the way it looks and the  material is very thin
1.0,Very cheap metal
1.0,Broke second time I carried it.
1.0,I really liked the look of this but after two months I have a pin that keeps wanting to fall out and I have already lost a key. Just doesn’t keep the keys secure.
1.0,Very low quality. Delivered smashed
1.0,If you got boobs then it's not for you. I bought it when I was a 36 C and I was spilling everywhere. Now I'm a 36 D ha forget it
1.0,"This product is terribly made. The armholes are just raw edges - they are not bound with fabric to hide the raw edge as they should be. There is just some light stitching on it. When you open it, it looks as if a child took a scissors and cut holes in the fabric. It's awful. I bought it as a gift but of course would not dream of giving such a poor quality item to anyone. I am returning it. Thank goodness this is a Free Returns item - I would have been upset if I had needed to pay to return it."
1.0,"Soooooo, though it's somewhat cute. The dress online does NOT come close to what you receive. First, the colors are not as bold. Second, the dress is straight, not long a flowy. Third...it comes to my ankles. I'm 5'6"" and weight 190. I was disappointed as the plan was to wear it to a wedding I'm singing at on July 3rd....will keep, maybe for work.....but  won't be wearing as planned."
1.0,This lasted 2.5 months before it lost it's finish.  Would not recommend for daily wear.
1.0,"Stripes look nothing like the picture! Stripes are made of material that is like shoe strings, not fabric. Returned it."
1.0,Really awful quality
1.0,Too small and poor quality
1.0,The lens popped out the second time I wore them. Disappointing indeed.
1.0,Not a very good fabric.  Also saggy.
1.0,"I wore these shoes a couple of times and stored them in my shoe bag....when I took them out to wear today the entire heel had deteriorated!  Literally crumbled!  The other shoe seems okay....they were stored in a shoe holder hanging up on my closet door.  All other shoes are just fine.  Is there an explanation as to why the heel would deteriorate? I bought them at a shoe store...same brand, same color.  Size 38.  I could cry!😂😟"
1.0,You get what you pay for. It's a cheap knockoff of Vancaro. The ring looks nothing like the picture cant see skulls and it is poor quality. Cant see any deatail.
1.0,Broke wuickly. Not well made.
1.0,"I love the look of these earrings. Unfortunately, the very first time I put them on, one of the earring's hooks snapped off and I could not wear them. If the earring backs had been made of stronger material, I would have loved these."
1.0,It’s not what you see on the picture. The color  on the pucture  is not same . Also they put earings  as bonus in the box . The craftmanship on the  jewelry  is not enticing to wear easy to get fade
1.0,El audifono derecho paro de trabajar tiene garantia por tres años como me pueden ayudar
1.0,"Yes, if it fit it would really be cute."
1.0,"Would not stay on my head. Kept sliding off. Super thick hat. Great concept, but nowhere near what I imagined it would feel like. Tried to return it and they wouldn’t accept returns, so make very sure you want it before you order it"
1.0,These glasses arrived with a deformation in the glass in the left eye they were unwearable from day one. A total waste of money
1.0,Cheapo
1.0,Pendent is very small
1.0,They didn’t have the hook part close so the charm is missing. Waste my money
1.0,"super low quality. if you kid is going to class regularly, you should get them a nicer one if it is in your budget. shrinks unevenly, which was strange. kimono isn't very soft. pants have a gusset, but still don't allow for great mobility. I ended up getting a nicer one for day to day and we donated this one too the jiu-jitsu school for kids who are taking a trial class."
1.0,Fell apart soon after I started carrying it.
1.0,"Super cheap, straps have ro be tied on."
1.0,"Update: Because I had sincerely hoped I received a bad batch, I went ahead and ordered a 4th set of tanks. Of the 8 tanks from the last 2 orders, all but 2 of the straps have broken. There is no way to contact the seller. Unacceptable.<br /><br />This is the 3rd set of white tanks I’ve ordered in the last couple years. I LOVE wearing them every day under clothes, but after several months, they start to get worn out. I wear them every day, so this is expected. I ordered new tanks on May 3rd and two of the tanks straps have already broken from the new batch! Really frustrating."
1.0,The light weight polyester material doesn't wear well and doesn't hold a blazer shape. It's more like a thin cotton shirt with no buttons.
1.0,"Mine faded the 2nd time I wore it, just from wearing it!  Also got it wet once, and the chain and all tarnished!  I won't buy from them again."
1.0,"Horribly small. I wear an XL so that is what I ordered, the sizing is pathetic this must fit a child not an adult, the material is thin. To put it on you, the only way “in” is through the chest opening. Tried to return this and seller wanted me to pay for the shipping to return it and if I kept it seller would only pay $1.90 for return. I kept it and I threw it in the trash. horrible experience and I do not recommend."
1.0,"I ordered this dress for a cruise. What I received was very disappointing,  not at all as shown in the picture. I thought this was a light, flowy material with a firm but loose fit. It is a stiff, cheap looking polyester. The sleeves had a fake cuff and the inside material is white... it's horrid."
1.0,"I ordered a woman's XL. The top came wadded up like a rag that should be thrown in the trash. I opened it up. It was labeled Women's XL. It looked like a Child's Medium or Large. The fabric was so thin,even if I could have tried it on, it would have been like a second skin. I had been looking forward to wearing this on vacation. What a terrible product."
1.0,really thin material & shoulder pads were very obvious and awkward. returned immediately
1.0,"The glitters are coming off the dress, not suited for little ones they might eat the glitters or might go to their eyes."
1.0,"The only good thing about this shirt was the color. The material is HORRIBLE like the disposable hospital gowns. Just kinda hands there with nothing flattering about it. I am going to attempt to return it, but based on previous reviews, sounds like it may be more trouble than it is worth! I DO NOT recommend!!"
1.0,Only got the number “9” the picture is very misleading.<br />The description says 9  I thought it meant 9 ea numbers.
1.0,This was very small.  I have it to a friend who is a lot smaller than my granddaughter.
1.0,Returned! Too thin to wear outside the bedroom!
1.0,I returned one and ordered another and they both broke instantly
1.0,"Pretty, but not to warm. Since not even a soft liner, it sheds all the time on to your inside clothes."
1.0,Nike sign fell off after a few weeks
1.0,Very cheap material!
1.0,Top was okay at best. Do not purchase unless you are flat chested. Bottoms were crafted for a small child or stuffed animal; guesstimating about 18 sizes too small.
1.0,"This shirt is extremely flimsy and cheap, with loose threads hanging out of the seams. It's dingy looking on top of that. It's also about two sizes too small. I wear between a L and XL. This XL shirt fits like a medium. I can't even get the buttons together. Its skin-tight on my scrawny arms. I dont know who these other reviewers are, but they clearly didn't receive the same shirt I did.<br />I don't review things lightly. This shirt is truly awful. Save your time and money."
1.0,Too small for XL size
1.0,Does not fit toddlers.
1.0,To heavy to wear
1.0,looked and felt cheap
1.0,Very uneven.
1.0,No. No me<br />Agrado la tela
1.0,This watch broke within 2 days of me wearing it.  I would NOT suggest buying from this brand.
1.0,Fell apart after one gentle use at community pool
1.0,"Way too small, ordered 2 sizes and BOTH were wayyy to small! Won’t rebuy & there aren’t many sizes available on Amazon. Website has the same shoe for 4x the price."
1.0,"This dress has a much higher waistline than pictured, very unflattering."
1.0,Haven't even had these a month and they are coming apart. Haven't worn them 5 times!
1.0,This comes up in a search of plus size belts and the information and reviews only give a total length.  This is not made for a plus size.  I wear a 16 woman's size and it looks like I'm trying to wear a size 8 belt.  The details and beads end way too short for this to look normal on a plus size waist.  Only the thin end string (which in the pictures are shown as dangling down) allows it to reach the loop and then very little is left dangling.  It just looks bad.
1.0,"Picture very deceiving, ordered 3 pairs. In the picture they look like linen-cotton pants, in reality it is a wrinkled gauze, material poorly dyed, looking like gauze diaper material in the 1970-ies. Shipping right back!"
1.0,"Wish I had read reviews! Material and quality are fine but it is NOT a scarf or a gator. I bought this with the intention to wear it as a scarf around my neck and be able to pull it up on my face when I needed the mask, but this does not go around the neck as a scarf. It is just a mask with a front bib on it and it does not go around the neck to be worn like a scarf, as it is shown in pictures. Mine also seems much smaller than in pictures, the bib is not long in the front at all, maybe goes to my collar bone. Definitely not longer as pictures show."
1.0,Never buying again. Too small. Not worth the money.
1.0,I forget I even ordered this .... when I finally got the package it was empty.  Really not fair for me to rate as I never got to try :(
1.0,Material is thin and flimsy and stretches out more than the previous pants I bought.  Get back to the quality material you used to use.
1.0,I Paid a lot of money for this as a gift for an 8 year old and it’s doubtful he’ll even be able to wear it. Letters are already peeling. I’m very disappointed in this item.
1.0,The sleeves on this are extremely slim and made for a bad fit. Returned the item and cancelled order for a second one with different pattern.
1.0,The elastic band on these shorts is infuriating. Every time you pull them on or off it gets bunches up and I had to spend minutes adjusting it through the fabric to make it flat and untwisted again. They go all the way up to your belly button and and the waist is pretty tight compared to the looseness of the legs. The styles not bad and quality of linen isn’t bad either. But I only wore these for two days and was done.
1.0,"I usually wear a medium, so I ordered a large because of the other reviews and the sizing chart. When I tried it on, I could barely get it over my butt. It also feels really cheap, and the zipper is super flimsy. I felt like it was going to rip off as I was unzipping it. Disappointed!"
1.0,Does not work as a bottle opener. Broke it first day we had it
1.0,The bathing suit is a gift for my daughter i am giving it to her when i go to VA. I just opened the box and to my disappointment it is black instead of brown.<br /><br />Kim N.
1.0,I did not like it. The material felt cheap. The metal was bendable. The lever did not hook on strong. I had to return it.
1.0,"No stars. These were like the cheapest made boots. No even wearable.  Do not waste $$. I had to give it a star rating,  but it is not even a one"
1.0,Earrings look just like the picture and would have loved to wear them but they arrived unglued to the clip part of the earring. I don’t have time to return them so I will try to glue it back together.
1.0,Pin was bent in the back
1.0,Material it’s almost nylon and the construction was bad. Definitely one of those cases where they saw the model pic and created something to resemble what the picture is… bad replica.
1.0,Didn't send sets only one earring per size.
1.0,It broke the 2nd day
1.0,"Terrible, the strings were falling off and the top of the dress is for something with no chest."
1.0,These gloves are made of cheap material and run small. Very disappointing for price.
1.0,"The frame is beyond large for any face, and the lenses are so cheap. Very cheaply made.. just terrible. I threw them in the trash"
1.0,I’m giving this a one star because they did they job that I needed it too but they didn’t stick very good. I constantly had to grab my boobs and re stick it looking like an idiot.
1.0,Looks nothing like what is shown... awful
1.0,Not the right size and poor quality
1.0,Purchased these for my son and while the waist measurements were accurate the rest of the pants were EXTREMELY tight.  He has pretty muscular legs but usually is fine in slim cut pants.  Not these!  Not only could he hardly walk in them but EVERYTHING was noticeable.  EWWWW.  Promptly returned.
1.0,"Muy mala la calidad, a la primera lavada hay que votarlo. No lo compren"
1.0,not even close to kelley green. awful.
1.0,Quality is going to be very low instead put 6$ more and buy Puma
1.0,it broke in half after I wore it one time
1.0,This product was a lie the description and the way it looked. I recommend nobody buy this you will be disappointed.
1.0,Mine showed up slightly bowed inwards. They should post how wide that they are.
1.0,this product fell apart a couple days after i bought it.  Not worth it.
1.0,Measurements not accurate but cute. At least a size smaller then marked
1.0,"The description says it is for the HR+, but it is not.  It for the HR.  I'm really disappointed as I was looking forward to changing out of the silicone band to something more professional looking.  Now I have to deal with the hassle of sending it back."
1.0,The stars fell off the stem
1.0,"This coat smh I have no idea what to say about it there was something weird going on with going with the arm like something was pulling, was excited about it"
1.0,"It's not glittery, just a purple printed mask, that fits just ""eh"" at that......Super disappointed. It's cheap, and for over $10, so NOT worth it!!!!!"
1.0,These are not good at all and I can not return them? What BS. They are not the strength they say they are.
1.0,The inside is not silk. It is a cotton lined mask
1.0,"There is no red anywhere on this hat, even though the color is called “red”. It is mostly orange."
1.0,The material is Too thin and see through.
1.0,"The dress looked very promising.  However, the back was awful.  The zipper was sewn in incorrectly, giving it a puckering effect which was not flattering, to say the least.  I had purchased this for an event, but now I have to scramble to find something else...sad."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:d22728af81eff38b6b05b359d87ecf1c]] Comfortable. But terrible quality. Both socks ripped in the same place after just the 4th use.
1.0,Broken already!
1.0,purchased 1st watch 4-11-19 liked it ordered 2nd on 4-14-19.1st one stopped working 7-29-19 replaced battery that didn't work. put 2nd one on 7-29-19 stopped working 9-5-19. sent it back to amazon just got refund for 13.59 and not $16.99 the price of the watch due to a restocking fee. restock something that does not work!  do not waste time and money. this is junk.
1.0,"Material is cheap and the print is awful. You can see right through each bandana. The material is not soft. The bandanas are so large, you can’t use them for normal wear. Waste of money."
1.0,the fit was horrible and I had ordered a size up
1.0,yucky polyester.  I returned it
1.0,Unable to get them on.
1.0,Sad thing I did not try them because I have probably 30 pair and this is my first pair that didn’t fit They are huge and short. My fault but I’ve never a too worry about the fit before. My opinion is not to buy. Buying down 2 sizes would not even work.
1.0,These earrings broke after the first time wearing them. They also won’t stay up on my ears and kept falling. I contacted the company and they wrote me an email saying they will send out a new pair but never did. I don’t even want a new pair I just want my money back. Don’t reccomend!
1.0,"Earrings are very, very heavy and are not gold.  They are made out of some type of medal.  I wouldn't recommend these."
1.0,Broke after wearing two times !  The second one broke as well here is a picture as I did not save the first necklace to send a pic
1.0,Broken and missing stones upon arrival. Would not recommend.
1.0,These were so small. I even ordered a couple sizes bigger just in case. I won’t order any clothes like this again. A total waste of time and money.
1.0,dont fit my ear
1.0,Very poor quality. Too small for two average sized adults. Looks nothing like bacon and eggs.
1.0,Way too small not true to size
1.0,Slippers were way too big. Had to send them back.
1.0,Too small... Not true to the size... Had to give it away...
1.0,I didn't like how they looked and they were too long for me. I am a short person. I did give them away though and the person loved them. They did look good in person!
1.0,The dress is made from cheap material and the color was totally wrong. I ordered the blush pink and I got a bright orange dress
1.0,"Love the color and style but runs very, very small"
1.0,"I guess I got a defective one, a plastic layer on the inside was peeling off. I think it's also disproportionately big for the cuff and looks cheaply made. I'd look elsewhere."
1.0,I think they sent the wrong size.  Looks like a pajama top.
1.0,Was not customized as advertised
1.0,"This hat is super itchy and thin so it won't keep your head warm at all. Over 50% of your body heat is lost through the top of your head, so you need a hat that will actually stop that and keep you warm.<br />The design is just alright but it wasn't comfortable to wear at all.<br /><br />Sent back for a refund."
1.0,It has no shape to it at all. Other than the color and a v-neck it looks nothing like the photo.
1.0,I can't even put it on it's too small. it fits a little girls arm...
1.0,"I purchased this watch in mid July 2019, went to adjust the time for daylight savings time and the knob just came off.  Now, I cannot adjust the time even when trying to snap that knob back on.  Not sure how to get in touch with the seller but pretty disappointed.  Watch was nice and seemed good quality for the price until now.  Any resolutions is much appreciated."
1.0,I ordered three of these jackets. Two (green and solid black) had a very nice lining and a bag for packing to travel. The black and white one has mesh on the inside! It’s scratchy and itchy. I ordered when we found out a a rafting trip was going to be colder than expected. I really hope I don’t have to wear the black and white one. So uncomfortable and made from different material from the other two as well as a different lance completely. The other two ordered where for my girls and they like the how they fit because it’s lined with a soft slick material. Only up side is if I have to wear it I tested the sleeve and it appears to be water resistant. That’s almost all it has going for it. If I don’t use it it will be returned as soon as we get back. The mesh is stiff and rubs the skin giving your hat nails again the chalkboard feeing.
1.0,"Gloves are very cheap, after 2 months they are falling apart"
1.0,Cheaply made hat with a barely discernable iron on applique.  It doesn't look like it will stand up to a decent rain.  Avoid.
1.0,This is absolute garbage. Do not waste your time or money. This belongs in Party City right next to the dime a dozen Mardi Gras beeds.
1.0,"gold? haha o ya ... , the color is losing so f fast... i no wll buy anymore"
1.0,I did not like the material and even though I ordered large its to small.
1.0,Ordered the black with yellow swoosh and received these blue ones - now the shirt doesn't match that I bought.
1.0,This pair actually does not look like the pair advertised. There's no shading on the lenses. Is the exact same pair as Birches large classic retro
1.0,"very, very inexpensive polyester fabric. must be very easily damaged if they come out of the pouch damaged. also an irritation that i must print a label and drive to return something so flimsy. it doesn’t work out cost wise to buy this item."
1.0,"This product had so much potential but the materials used to make it are cheap.  The zipper broke after 2 days of use, and the stitching came unraveled.  Not impressed."
1.0,Weird fit. Looks like something my grandmother would wear.
1.0,"My first attempt at buying these belts resulted in getting belts that would be too big for Andre The Giant, and I ordered the XL. Not true to size at all. My next attempt, I ordered Large. Don't know if they would have fit, because I was shipped used belts. Gross. Folks, I'd pass on these. Spend a bit more and order from a real company."
1.0,Latch broken within days of using it.
1.0,Ďid not have a nose wire
1.0,1 Band broke after 2 weeks of use so far the others have held up but I am very very careful since my watch hit the pavement
1.0,Is sooo thin... material is not good
1.0,Crap. Don't buy! Material weird and fit is weird. Also NOT A FREE RETURN!!@@ UNACCEPTABLE!!<br />I am a prime member too. Not happy.
1.0,Really nice looking but I can't really wear it because it irritates my belly button
1.0,its very pretty but to bust was for a woman with larger breast even though the bottom fit ok.
1.0,Hips and booty is a no on this outfit! And the shirt runs really small
1.0,I wore 2 of them 1 time and they literally fell apart off my neck. The others broke while I was trying to latch them. I feel totally ripped off.
1.0,Order blue came black material isnt soft at all
1.0,"My kid broke it in 2 hours. Cheap quality, for the price I suppose it's worth what I paid."
1.0,Shirt arrived with a small hole near the bottom.
1.0,Chain was all tangled couldn't use
1.0,I ordered the pink and white long dress with cut outs. It runs VERY small in the skirt portion. Up top fit perfectly but the bottom was WAY too tight.
1.0,It's beautiful but it fades quickly. If u want it for one wear it's fine.
1.0,"I ordered this in 2 colors.  The striped ones looks like a multi color stripe in the photo, not a July 4th Red / White / Blue.  Description says that it's 'A bit sheer', it's COMPLETELY see-through.  There is no lining, and there is no way to add one.  I also ordered the green floral.  The sizing was totally different although the tag also said size S.  The waist was 34"", which slips over my hips without unzipping.  Don't waste your time, unless you want to gamble on sizing and wear as a nightie or beach cover-up."
1.0,"I returned this dress as it was not made well. It did not fit well and I did not like the fabrics it was made of for an evening gown. Even at a size 2, this dress was gathered on me, the collar did not lay flat, the finishes at the seams were lacking (note on both sides of the neck and along the left side under the arm), the fabric is like swimsuit material, and the glittery part is see-thru itchy fabric, which would require undergarment that leave a seam at the waist in order to be presented appropriately and after a few hours that itchy fabric could become intolerable. The dress just did not lay on my figure smoothly and elegantly, unfortunately."
1.0,For the price of this item you would think it would hold up longer than 60 days.  I have hardly used this item and bottom of interior pocket has already deteriorated to point that items fall through.
1.0,It’s made very cheap. I wouldn’t give it any stars. But it told me I had to
1.0,When I got it I was very exited. When I took it out of the package I was disappointed to see that the buttons weren’t full attached and the bottom of it was poorly made.
1.0,i couldn't fit any of my lenses with the hood
1.0,"It was a nice watch except it died in a little under three months. Liked the vibrating feature for my son to have on so it didint disturb his classmates in preschool.  I would no recommend though because it died under three months.  It did not get any water in it or anything like that, I just was not able to set the time or anything anymore.  Do not buy this watch. I paid too much for it to not even last a year.  Very unhappy customer."
1.0,Too small even for Asian bodies.  Maybe elementary school girls?  fabric was also cheap quality.
1.0,"Advertised as within size of over 7"" but in reality it is only 6.5"" my safety glasses did not not."
1.0,Trash.........can't get a real model to represent
1.0,can not use; needed support of the calf like most other compression socks
1.0,They were not Big XL wide frames as labeled. They are too small. I had to rate it with at least one star to submit but I would not give it even one star. Description is misleading.Feel cheap and flimsy. Absolute junk and any price!
1.0,This romper was extremely huge on me. It had no shape and the legs were not fitted as shown. I returned this item for a refund.
1.0,"Bought 4 various color glasses. One  lens broke from frame straight out of the box , second frame broke two weeks later. Don't take others out anymore. Save your money."
1.0,Horrible! Only worn 2 times and the velcro already broke on both shoes.
1.0,"awful tights completely synthetic - cheap, thin and poorly made do not buy these ever, there is no cotton in these at all"
1.0,"I am SO DISAPPOINTED - this was my second shirt . . . same brand, same size . . . but didn't fit.  It was either mislabeled or manufactured improperly.  I gave it to my size 8 granddaughter and it fit her.  I LOVE my other shirt and was so excited to get a second one . . . but it simply didn't fit."
1.0,Useless. All rot even being stored in good conditions. Cheap
1.0,"Watchband lasted less than one month - rugged, masculine looking watch WAS NOT rugged!"
1.0,This product has been worn twice and it’s turn colors it’s supposed to be sterling silver and it went like crap even one of the stones fell out
1.0,This jumpsuit looks like it is homemade. It is poorly made and the sizing is off. I returned it.
1.0,The product was printed upside down. It was also really unclear.
1.0,The fabric is so cheap that makes it look like part of a costume.
1.0,Cheap metal earrings. I got these as a gift for my Girlfriend and in a day they showed signs of rust  before they were even worn. ended up tossing them out.
1.0,"Beautiful bracelet, sterling silver; but even clasped all the way in to the closest clasp it is still way too big. It’s really too bad, because the bracelet is beautiful."
1.0,Pic doesn’t do it justice but let me just say these pants are GINORMOUS. Current pregnancy weight is 155 at 29 weeks and I ordered the medium according to pre-pregnancy weight. You could’ve literally fit 2 of me in these. At least I got a good chuckle. 🤣
1.0,"Very disappointed, The Unicorns look weird.<br />My daughter does not like them."
1.0,One of the seams wasn’t completely sewn.  Right out of the bag there was a gaping hole in one seam.  Otherwise the material seems good.
1.0,They rust within days. Bad quality.
1.0,Broke within 2 weeks. Don’t waste your money
1.0,"I ordered this shirt in black and white because I loved it so much. It LOOKS like it is so comfortable, and I imagined it would be great for cooler days with some cute jeans. The shirts came today and I am returning them. I even sized up TWO sizes because of the reviews. Looks great in the pictures; but, they run terribly small and they seem like they are poor quality."
1.0,"I have bought a pair of Hawthorn Athletic leggings at the beginning of the year and they were the perfect Lululemon Align dupes HOWEVER I ordered two pairs in March and they were the CHEAPEST feeling leggings I have ever seen that came from QiaoBa999 NOT Hawthorn Athletic. I’m not sure what happened, but I won’t be ordering again because the return process seems like a nightmare. They want the package sent directly back to China not utilizing one of the main package carriers. A nightmare."
1.0,The adhesion of polymorphic plastic to the teeth don't work at all.
1.0,Very cute bracelet but after a few weeks of wearing a charm broke and fell off and was lost.  Quality of product is very poor.
1.0,"This was such a cute bra, but it was incredibly difficult to get on and was wildly uncomfortable."
1.0,I liked the shape but they were very flimsy and came with one pre scratched lens.
1.0,"Do yourself a favor and don't wear this. Firstly, the chemical smell from this could make you sick immediately.. it is so strong, I developed a headache and I could smell it all over the house.<br /><br />Decided to soak in water with a rose oil to make it smell better. You see, by the time I checked the water after 1 mins, it was as brown as muddy water, deep brown with strong chemicals coming out(the black one)<br /><br />I poured the water out 6 time, still same color..I could count at least 10 times of changing the water..same.<br /><br />Finally gave up and air-dried it. I woke up and can still smell the chemical in the house.<br /><br />On the white one, I could see many strands of human black hair coming out. If it wasn't white, I probably won't have noticed.<br /><br />If you wear this chemical on your head, I feel sorry for you.. dangerous to health. Do yourself a favor and don't.<br /><br />Returning these ASAP"
1.0,Sides are cut too low so things aren't covered well. Disappointed as the fabric is very soft and comfortable. Unfortunately the stability is not there.
1.0,"Well, just got my rings...bought set of 6 with the crystal ring being the one I bought the set for....got five crappy rings with the flashing not trimmed so I cut myself opening them, and no crystal ring. Should have known with the name Cougars Choice, tape on the box was so old and yellow must have been packaged in the 80's. Never again...these are definitely going back"
1.0,Not worth the time to return will not recommend this brand
1.0,Wayyyyy to small and very thongy
1.0,Thread hanging everywhere. Two different materials clashed.
1.0,Watch band only lasted 30 days before breaking!
1.0,I like the design of the mask. But I dislike that they are hard to breath in.
1.0,Puffy in the wrong place
1.0,All are very very cheap quality and totally mismatch with picture posted here.
1.0,The fabric was beautiful but this was waaay to big. This is suppose to be one size fits all but it looks like a 3X. Not happy a waste of my money.
1.0,"I ordered hoodie, cotton, and got a polyster,"
1.0,This I had to return this dress it is super cute!!!! I ordered a small and it was still to big in the chest
1.0,It came with stans an rips not happy
1.0,This item looked so cheap I took the horrid watch face off and just use the leather as a bracelet. Looked way better online !
1.0,"These are really cute. Runs small. Unfortunately, that's about it! Arrived today. My daughter wore them for 2 HOURS & this happened, that quick. DONE! FINISHED! GARBAGE! Don't waste your time throwing your money away on these!"
1.0,Cheap. Tarnished quickly. It’s not really high quality. It turned my neck green after a couple of wears. Would not recommend.
1.0,"So the picture on this listing is a rendering. The actual ring I got was very obviously stamped out of a machine. There were bits of metal from where the mold didn't release properly between the bands. For the price of this ring, I really expected it to look better than an awful piece of costume jewelry from a teen jewelry chain. I was printing the return label within minutes of opening the package. Very disappointing."
1.0,Doesn’t look anything like the picture very large
1.0,What I did not like about this product was that it was so tiny that maybe it would of fit a baby’s septum. Horrible descriptions but nice looking ring.
1.0,Purchased suit a size bigger and it is labeled as such but cannot wear because way too small.
1.0,SMALL SMALL SMALl
1.0,This product said 60 pcs all I got was 10 mask and I've been waiting on the rest that was promised to for a while now.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:99a9c9178185770408f34b46a2b82580]] Horrible design, the sleeves kept falling off."
1.0,Horrible quality. Gems had fallen off and the rings themselves were bent.
1.0,Hassle to return and I didnt like
1.0,"I got this visor to use as a shield. I wore it 2 times, for only one hour the first time, then about 10 minutes into the second use it broke. The bolt holding the visor part in place popped off (without me noticing) so it’s not salvageable and has to be thrown away. Such a bummer because I really liked the visor but the quality of terrible."
1.0,"Mine was for my granddaughter, Mine was in bad shape , I threw it away. I was hoping for one that was not tangled up and pieces broke, Must just got a bad  defective one.  Not happy with the product,"
1.0,These arrived just fine however they are too small in the ankle opening. I have a size 6b foot and it was too difficult to get them on. Disappointed.
1.0,"wore these maybe 5-6 time and both soles split open on bottom and shoe is basically worthless now, don't buy these sole is as thin as paper!"
1.0,Smallest 38 ever (should be a 34). Keep in mind does not say where it is made & you have to pay for return. Nothing remarkable about the belt. Returned it and cut my losses.
1.0,Terrivle mente feos i mala calida
1.0,The product arrived with both necklaces saying &#34;to infinity&#34;. Bought as a gift so not worth the time to try to return and replace. Big bummer!
1.0,I have never had a band that keep unsnapping. Luckily I was able to caught it before it hit the floor!
1.0,Little metal pin is riveted to one of the straps.  Rivet came apart and I pressed it back together and thought it was OK.  Came apart again at the beach and I lost my watch.  Will now have to replace watch.<br />Silicone strap also causes sweating and chafing.
1.0,Not true to size. XL should be labeled S.
1.0,"If you look closely at the picture you can see that it has been photoshoped. The skirt if much fuller in the picture than the one I recieved. You can see the the lace pattern and folds in the skirt have been copied and pasted to make it look fuller. The dress was nice, but it was not as advertised so be aware of that. I bought a petty skirt/underskirt to make it fuller but it only helped a little. There is just not the same amount of fabric on the dress that is in the picture so no matter how much you try to make the skirt bigger it will never look like the picture. This is false advertising."
1.0,Size doesn't match
1.0,"Defective band, returned and given credit. Poor customer service.  I do not recommend this watch."
1.0,It was so closely curved that it touched my eyes.<br />I tried to reduce the curve by bending and it broke very easily!
1.0,When I opened the plastic bag the smell was absolutely gross!  It kind of smelled like burnt rubber.<br />I want my money back but the seller dropped the ball.  The jewelry was also very cheap looking.<br />I will never buy anything from them again.
1.0,These were yellow.  Not camel or beige.
1.0,"I bought 2 of these .one for my husband and one for me. My husband is 5feet 6inches, 200lbs I am 5feet 1inch 130lbs So we are both a little ""fluffy"" I was hoping they would stretch to fit since the description said up to a 50 inch waste. Well it was a waste of money! The suits cost 19 dollars each.  They came out of the package and were so flimsy more like umbrella nylon material. The size was actually more a Youth Large not Adult Large. I am returning them for a full refund. I saw the same suit for only 6 dollars on another site. Now i know why.. Poor quality .. not large enough.."
1.0,When I got the bracelet it was broken.  I am very upset and was really looking forward to wearing it.  Very cheaply made!!!!
1.0,"First off, the material is weird. The legs are soooooo wrong! They’re HUGE at the bottom, one side was even bigger than the other. I’m 5’7 & large btw so they’ll probably swallow anyone shorter than me."
1.0,Terrible. Don't bother. Everything was distorted. I couldn't use them.
1.0,Dislike!  Did not help with glare at all!  Only made the glare yellow.  Disappointed.
1.0,Cheap coating that covers part of the hollow area. Doesn't even look like razorblades.<br />One picture shows my other razorblade ring that barely cost more. By comparison this one is a joke. (Ring on middle is better quality and ring on pinky is this ring)
1.0,Is this a joke??? They aren’t anything like what was described. A waste.
1.0,"I returned this right away. The fit was in Normas, and the material was extremely odd. Very heavy and stiff."
1.0,"I ordered my size and I can't even get it on, its like 5 times smaller than what it should be, so I had to give it away. I'm not sending it back cause it took over a month to get it. I don't suggest ordering this shirt or any others like it."
1.0,Theres a warning on the book which is concerning. And the page opening to insert the bills are upside down so the bills fall out of the bottom of the pages . Gave it to my son for Christmas and now I have to take from him due to the warning that I had no knowledge of until after he got it for Christmas and started looking at it.
1.0,The necklace is cheaper material than you would think and was WAY bigger than I hoped for.
1.0,"Love the color, but these are thin. The pants roll down, and don’t have an elastic band around the waist. These pajamas also don’t have stitching on the ends on the shirt or pants, making them more likely to roll the fabric upwards."
1.0,Necklace snapped first day of wearing it.... extremely disappointed I would not buy again...
1.0,"Bought a size up as advised, but the shorts are near see through and poor quality. Have only worn them as pyjamas."
1.0,Had to return all as they ran extremely small even for a stretchy short.
1.0,This watch is way to small for me
1.0,"One star for ok fit. The size worked for me for Med and 5'4"" @145lbs. Normally size 8/10.<br />The dress is CHEAP and made of cheap thick nylon feel material. It's probably polyester but feels like a bathing suit or shiny cheap halloween costume. The pattern and colors don't match the pics. Def NOT tie dye. Ordered via prime and still took over a week to arrive. It's so bad, I started the return the moment I took it out of the package.<br />Maybe the other colors could be cute but the red is TERRIBLE!"
1.0,There is no way this was the correct size. I compensated and actually got a larger size and it was at least 3 sizes too small.
1.0,Seemed like a cute set - broke even as I was taking out of the box - too fragile.
1.0,Returned them already Did not fit well
1.0,IT IS RIDICULOUS HOW COMPANIES SELL THINGS THAT THEY KNOW IS NOT SIZED RIGHT! THERE IS NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM THAT THIS SMALL THING IS A 2XL MORE LIKE A SMALL. I BOUGHT IT BIG LIKE I DO MOST THINGS BECAUSE OF THE SIZE FACTOR AND THIS GOES BEYOND!
1.0,"Not good. I ordered an X-large to make sure it would not be too small. I gave it to my 14 year old Granddaughter. It was so small, it was ridiculous. It was beautiful, but make sure to wear under clothing because of how shear and see through it is."
1.0,"It’s ok, just not what I was looking for. I didn’t realize it went over the head and also doctors say if you can see through your masks then you are not getting the protection you need, and I can see through this. I’m not happy with it but have no choice but to keep it as I having shipping issues."
1.0,Way to small and see threw. Not impressed at all.
1.0,In some lights you can see a hint of green. But you should only order this if you want a gray T-shirt. Photo on amazon is misleading.
1.0,Did not work when I received it. Yes it is cheap and yes it is made in China. And no I would not recommend buying this.
1.0,"does not fit Samsung gear S2, other selling it cheaper. asked for return got approved but i have to pay shipping . do not buy . i'm stuck with it."
1.0,"I always order medium. A little big for me but they fit the guys. However, this item the medium are too small for my hands. The guys cant even get half their hand in."
1.0,Even with ordering a larger size these just didn't work at all.
1.0,Please don’t waste your money and time. I will be returning this item. I would give a zero star is I could. Poor material and not denim at all.
1.0,The dress that I received was a totally different style dress !
1.0,Every single one had a sharp piece of plastic jutting out that would make putting it into a piercing painful and would create micro tears.
1.0,Don't waste your time and money.
1.0,Zipper broke. Wore a handful of times. Don’t waste your money this product is not worth it. Its cheap Chinese made.
1.0,It broke way too easy. Pretty disappointed. I put it in my back pocket and then when I reached for the lanyard it broke. 😔
1.0,They seem great until you wash them then you can tell how cheap they are and they don't look as nice anymore
1.0,The straps on this red shirt are way too long.
1.0,"After 2 months, and our boy wearing these a few times a week, the Velcro has ripped off the back. Didn’t even make it through the summer!"
1.0,"bought it as a gift,it broke on the first day"
1.0,this was not for &#34;this&#34; large busted woman...no support whatsoever.  Hurts my neck.
1.0,They are massive. They made anyone who tried them on look like a bug
1.0,chain broke  the first day I wore it
1.0,"Oh My ! ! absolutely Beautiful, Here comes my Friends Amazon  ! !"
1.0,I ordered an xl even though I usually wear an large. I wanted it bigger for layering purposes during the colder months and it fit to tight
1.0,Not at all what was on the picture.
1.0,"Terrible. Doesn't hold anything anywhere. The shoulder straps are way too long,and I got smaller than my normal size."
1.0,I usually wear a medium top but for t-shirts do a large - this shirt felt more like an xxl to me.  Ordered another t-shirt from a different company in a large and it fits fine.
1.0,I really like it. It’s really cute but defeated the purpose of wearing it. Oils and gels went right thru it and rubies my new uniform shirt. This is a plastic type material not cloth.
1.0,The garment had deodorant marks under the arms and on the bodice and skirt of the dress.
1.0,"Strange, dull (not gold-colored at all--more like a dingy doily), chains did not match and were ill-fitting.  Thumbs down."
1.0,"I only wore it a handful of times, and then it broke!"
1.0,Glasses had too much of a cat eye look for me. Returned item right after receiving them and purchased oakleys
1.0,I’m 5’7 and 190 pounds and can usually wear a large and this fit like a medium and was extremely short. I have to send it back. Wouldn’t recommend.
1.0,It’s a beautiful band but the pin on the buckle that secures the watch isn’t long enough. You can’t make it work even when it’s not on your wrist. What good is a watcband that doesn’t work. I had my money refunded. Don’t waste your time on this one.
1.0,"The product is horrible compared to other ""sticky tits"" I have bought. The adhesive sucks and the material is pretty hard and stiff"
1.0,"The foot part on the sock was so long!! It does NOT fit small feet. I wear a 6 1/2, 7 shoe size. Also the thigh part is too tight for thick legs. I wear a size 11 pant."
1.0,"I bought this for a friend who is a Disney fanatic.  I thought it would be perfect and the picture so was precise and clear....well dont be fooled.  The actual mouse pad that showed up was blurry...so much for precise.  Very disappointed. The first pic is what I got, the second is what is promoted as what you are getting.  Besides blurry, (which honestly its actually blurry in real life) there is far more landscape shown in promoted pic vs what you get...you cant even see bottom of statue on mine."
1.0,"These pants are horribly made, the rips were on the side not the front, don’t waste your money..😡😡😡😡😡😡"
1.0,"I don't really hate the sox but they are so tight I cannot get them on my husband's feet.  I bought the extra large size but he has very wide feet and he cannot get them on even with me helping him.  So as you can see, we can't know how good they are unless we can use them.  I have returned them since they were never used or even put on a foot.<br /><br />I returned these items in perfect condition and was told my refund was on the way but it never appeared on my credit card statement.<br />WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?"
1.0,"Received a regular Tie,  not a ascot. I returned it."
1.0,"I had really liked the chain and was very careful with the necklace, always took it off at night, before I’d shower, never wanted to wear on it to hard but it still broke in a months time. NOT WORTH IT."
1.0,"overall, had the feel and softness of something you'd find for $3 at goodwill from 1976. Came shipped with holes in the stitching on the side of the leg at both knees. Just not good, get something else."
1.0,"Se arruinaron el mismo día que los use, NO SIRVEN!!!!"
1.0,Terrible. The magnets are not secure enough and constantly loosen so it does not fit secure to wrist
1.0,My sunglasses snapped the second time I put them on my face. I would highly recommend seeking an alternative.
1.0,"This dress was recommended by someone that I follow on Instagram however it does not fit as shown in the images. I knew this dress was a horror as soon as I removed it from the package. Although, this would be a great dress for someone looking to dress up as a Pilgrim."
1.0,Received These airings in this box and one of the earrings was broken. They probably should’ve got a larger box to put them in. Sending them back.
1.0,"This product took 1/2 the summer to arrive.  Does not fit, cheap material and seller will not answer requests to return.  Unable to reach Amazon to assist with return.  Stay away from this product!"
1.0,"Poor quality, cuts edges unfinished.<br /><br />Looks like blanks were cut out, sewen together and pushed out."
1.0,Very disappointed reading the reviews I ordered 2 sizes up still to small the material is very thin very cheaply made no wow factor at All.
1.0,"I loved the band, but my fitbit stopped working when I inserted it in the band.  I called the company and they said that there were no bands that fit unless they were genuine fitbit bands.<br />This was not.  Very dissatisfied."
1.0,Shoes were way smaller than the size indicated.
1.0,"These didn’t work. They didn’t go up my ear, they hung down."
1.0,"Received the wrong size, and the quality was poor, the stitching on the hem causes the hem to roll.  No tag with care instructions came with or were on the blouse. I would not buy again."
1.0,Very see through and tight in the legs/by your knee
1.0,Material from a 3rd world feel. Do not buy
1.0,The quality was awful!
1.0,"It just didn't look cute at all. maybe it was the color maybe it was the design, but it really looked bad. I would not waste money on it. Glad I was able to return it with prime."
1.0,Like nice
1.0,"They looked good and felt good for the time they were not broken.  Beware, only a three month Loumon  warranty.  Ordered in April broke in August, &#34;sorry out of warranty&#34;.  The left earpiece broke off the frame.  They are not worth the expense, even as knock offs.  There is a reason there is such a weak warranty."
1.0,I don't like the way this t-shirt form on my body. It fits but kinda weird on the back. I did not have time to return it. Now stuck with this one and not sure what to do with it.
1.0,It's crap too small. I gave it to my 6years old son.
1.0,The fabric was too small
1.0,"Fabric not what thought, and quality not good either"
1.0,the seller is hard to deal with  no battery pack comes with this item and the item itself is of poor quality  I gave it one star because u need to give a star to post a review
1.0,"Looks nothing like the pic. It is a very junky, thick alloy. Price is cheap, so is necklace."
1.0,"These are not what you think. It’s like stretch Halloween costume fabric, the stitching around the legs and waist are not stretch at all so you pop a few stitches just putting them on. Just not even worth it."
1.0,This necklace runs micro baby small. It did not even get close to even wrapping around my neck. It’s made for little girls not grown women.
1.0,"Very disappointed! Too small, had a tarnished look, stones dull, looked cheap, collar did not say “I ❤️ My Dog” like the picture shows. Returning for refund ☹️"
1.0,They fit but the crotch area is weirdly designed. Had to return.
1.0,I am 5'3 130 lbs and typically wear a x-small to small in shirts.  I ordered these in medium and they were way too tight.
1.0,I bought this  in a 3X for my daughter who typically wears a size L. (Too small) Runs really really small we gave it to a friend who wears a medium and it barely fit her
1.0,"I was looking forward to getting this dress and thought the fit would be no problem, but I would hardly consider this a one size fits all. I am about 5.6 and 165 pounds size 10-12 usually. The lining underneath was very tight and it only came to about mid thigh, even though all the pictures and info said the lining was the length of the dress. I thought the neck seemed a little uncomfortable and didn't seem to fit right. Unfortunately it had to be returned, the shipping was fast though and had no problem with the return."
1.0,Bend over and WOW HELLO!!! No Bueno
1.0,"Booties were hard to get on and keep on our baby's feet. They kept falling off. Also, there is no padding on the bottom and are really just crib shoes only. Cannot be worn outside or on any type of ground."
1.0,Material was light and cheap looking.
1.0,Fabric feels/looks like crappy Halloween costume material. It's really shiny.  HORRIBLE quality and looks nothing like the picture. I can't even imagine what it would be like if it went through the washer.
1.0,Not good! Cheap material and the top doesn't fit well at all.
1.0,"The clock's features have changed, the description and picture on the webpage haven't. Even the box in which the clock is packed still shows the discontinued model. One feature (the calendar) has been eliminated, and another feature (on the one I got, anyway) doesn't even work. Buyer, beware."
1.0,The band is very thick and tight elastic. The product would be great quality if it did not hug my head tight enough to cause headaches.
1.0,Broke the lense off the frame when they dropped on the floor.  Safety Glasses?
1.0,"If you love FitFlops:<br /><br />I do and have several pair.<br />So I saw these retro looking Pilar sandals on Zulily.<br />Wore them to dinner and walking home my foot turned on my ankle and I fell on CONCRETE !<br />I got up shakily and continued my walk home (in pain) and fell AGAIN!<br />The sidewalk had no cracks or raised area etc.<br />I’m guessing the wide front and rocker wedge like sole are the culprits.<br /><br />I emailed the company and after days received this reply:<br />“Adam (FitFlop)<br />Jul 14, 2021, 10:08 GMT+1<br /><br />Hi Sandra<br /><br />Thank you for the email<br /><br />We request you wear the shoes around the house to check for sizing and fit<br />Once you wear them outside you are taking ownership<br /><br />Sorry they would be unable to return at this stage”<br /><br />So I guess if had fallen in my home and cracked my skull- they’d take them back?<br />But hurting my ankle, toes and knee - do not merit it?<br />These shoes only have a 2 star review online. Guess I should’ve researched instead of trusting the brand name.<br /><br />Shame on #FitFlop for the callous reply<br />Indeed that’s NOT Customer “Care”!"
1.0,Horrible quality. Paper thin. The worst I've seen.
1.0,Was not what I expected too cheap of a material
1.0,These are not men's socks. The sole measures under 7 inches. These are boy's socks. The picture of the sock on a man's foot is laughable. I wear size 11 shoe and my foot would not fit inside the sock opening.
1.0,"It is so small! And the fabric is so thin when I went to open the button on the pouch, the button just came off. I got it for my puppy but I don't see a cat with claws not tearing this apart."
1.0,veryyy thin .tangle too much..
1.0,"I loved the way these pants looked. However, I have only worn them a handful of times and they have ripped and frayed along the seams in multiple places. It started with a small tear in the pocket, but today I went to the bathroom at work and discovered a gaping hole in the crotch and little pirates of thread falling off. Definitely not worth the hassle."
1.0,Right when I got it I seen that it was all black and had to wash it
1.0,"HORRIBLE FIT>  size  11 wer more like a size 2.  Cheaply made, Crappy material"
1.0,It's worse ever.. it's short and way wider than the size I want. Definitely I'm returning it.
1.0,"Not s described, would have returned it but no return address not included. DONT BUY!"
1.0,Cheap and button broke after one wash.
1.0,"I bought these gloves for winter because my hands are always freezing!!! I tried them on in a department store and loved them but thought $35 was too expensive. Purchased these and I’m so disappointed. When you take your hands out the inside lining pulls out and it’s difficult to make the lining. Not warm, cheap. Broke down and purchased an authentic pair and absolutely love them!!! Don’t waste your money on these fake ones!!!"
1.0,Horribly thin material with no underwire
1.0,This is seriously tiny! More like a kids play grocery bag. I was in shock at how small it was.
1.0,i purchased these they were too big they run large in size. I wear a 8 and I purchased a large they were too big. I returned the item and they returned me back someone else's used item. Terrible
1.0,This is not PLA or any rigid substance. It is a rubber mask. Product listing is deceitful.
1.0,As soon as I got in the shower ear protection they fell of
1.0,"The zipper on the side was broken on arrival.  It was all the way up but unzipped, couldn't fix, and now I have to return it and I am bad at that."
1.0,"The waist fits as expected, but the rest of the shorts are HUGE.<br /><br />I seriously think you could fit 3 legs into one of the openings.  Running was comical because of all the extra material."
1.0,"These &#34;pants&#34; are thinner than most leggings, and run small. I'm between sizes and ordered the larger, but they were too small. No one could mistake these for jeans. If you have any lumps and bumps, they will be amplified and clearly visible through these. They are soft and comfortable, but so are cotton leggings."
1.0,"Not what was advertised. I ordered the beige (the very light color) and they are dark grey-brown. They are not the light pretty color pictured whatsoever! Not worth sending back and I'm not going to worry about my $4, but hopefully this review helps just one person not make the same mistake!"
1.0,"Bought this for my halloween costume. Was super excited to use it for other occasions too. However, I didn't end up wearing it for halloween and it'll probably be donated. The dress is very form fitting and hard to put on. It's not breathable. I even went a size up and it wasn't flattering at all."
1.0,giant
1.0,I received my order today quite nicely packaged however the box that was suppose to contain the earrings was empty.  Absolutely nothing in box except for packaging material.
1.0,water sock not good for child play in pool
1.0,I wanted to love this so much.  I am glad I didnt go through with ordering accessories for this look.  The arms and shoulders were too tight.  I am returning it tomorrow.
1.0,I did not receive the strap with the purse. It is useless to me.
1.0,"Terrible. totally different, transparent and very short.  it is a hoax."
1.0,"Quality is awfuly, like bathroom paper.<br />Fingers go thru it trying to put it on no matter who tried it.  Awful!  AWFUL, but somewhere else."
1.0,They shipped me a different dress. Nothing like the one on the picture.
1.0,"I ordered some mask that said dog kids, they were huge and poorly made.  Refused to refund money.  Horrible customer device do not buy."
1.0,Purchased but can’t wear too tight at neck chest and underarm portion
1.0,"I wore these for a few days and my ears had a very bad reaction to the metals used.  It cost me a doctor visit.  We are assuming it was nickel, as I am very allergic to nickel.  So much for “real” gold."
1.0,Fabric is horribly cheap
1.0,"Not as shown in picture, they are  not straight slim shorts as advertised."
1.0,Arrived broken. Worth about 50 cents.
1.0,"I wanted to like this, but like the other reviews said there is so much fabric in the front. I had to return for a refund. I followed the sizing guide and started with a medium, then returned it for a small. Even then, the fit wasn’t right in the zipper area."
1.0,Loved the style- but one of the ear pieces broke off the first time I wore them. Very disappointed.
1.0,I haven't worn it as yet and the color has change. Couldn't find my packing slip/receipt to return it. On the other the weight is very good compearing to others.
1.0,"this was a waste of money, a piece of crap, doesn't hold together."
1.0,"Bought a medium, my usual size. Could not zip it up in the back. I’m on the chesty side but it wasn’t even close, as if the maker expected the wearer to have a completely flat chest, the back being about the same as the front. This dress was made in China. Note to dress maker: many women outside of Asia have breasts so please make your dress accordingly. The hip and stomach part was fine and the length was good."
1.0,Cheap don’t like wasted money
1.0,This watch has automatic movement that suppose to self wind the watch. I wore it 1 week for more than 8 hours a day but watch kept stopping every 40 hours or so. Returned the watch back and had to pay 20% of the watch cost for shipping. I choose this watch because it was made in Japan. But it turned out as a big disappointment. I am not satisfied at all.
1.0,"Take a beach towel, tie string on 2 corners. Voila! Better than this item. This cover up is so akward. If you want to be the joke of the beach/pool then buy this."
1.0,The only reason I gave a one star I didn’t have option for a zero
1.0,"This item arrived but when I open the box, it was broken there’s a missing piece that goes with it as shown in the pictures I’ve taken"
1.0,"awful material and sewing. tissue paper thin, so completely see-through.  just hangs there and seams not sewn well and strings hanging out.  returning."
1.0,"It is NOT chiffon, this is 100% polyester and a horrible cut that looks absolutely nothing like the picture. Sending it back and will never order from this company again. False advertising has a whole new meaning on this one."
1.0,"I love this purse. Arrived today. Has a horrible smell and have no idea if I can even use it. Airing it out; but, would love to know why it smells so bad. No way I can take it anywhere. Was so excited and now so disappointed. It's not a suede smell. It did say imitation suede."
1.0,"When my package arrived I was super excited, but my excitement slowly died as I put these leggings on and realized that they had come with a massive hole in the thigh, not only that but they run SUPER small so be sure to size up. They are thin and not squat proof. Underwear lines visible."
1.0,This dress is so thin that you could see through your skin and underwear . I used it as a night gown
1.0,"Awful quality, all of the snaps fell off before I ever wore it."
1.0,cheaply made. flimsy and gaudy.
1.0,"Didn’t last long, cleaned it with my shirt and the lens fell off. Not worth the buy!"
1.0,Sticker on a cheap hat
1.0,"It came broke with stone fallen out.  Would never recommend it to anyone.  Threw it out, it wasn't worth the postage to send it back."
1.0,"I ordered a size larger and it was still not quite right. The material felt cheap, like a costume. I can't imagine wearing it in any serious way even if it did fit."
1.0,Sizes doesn't fit. Waist is too small and length is too long. 40×32 will be good if wear 36×34. Material quality not good.
1.0,"I hate it it's cheap looking, just bad bad bad"
1.0,"The fabric had a chemical smell and it was tight in the wrong places, the support was shockingly bad for being so enforced."
1.0,These are horrible.  They dont fit well at all.  Tight around the crotch and are constantly riding up.  Returning
1.0,These plugs ate a hole into my ear. I had previously stretched my ears to this size and these were just new jewelry and the thick walled silicone tunnels broke down the entire fistula causing a massive infection.
1.0,Cheap very CHEAP
1.0,"This wallet is wider longer and thicker than a standard slim billfold which absolutely defeats the purpose of having a minimalist wallet.... if youre looking to keep a small wallet in your pocket this definitely is not the right solution, also doesnt have a magnetic closure..."
1.0,"Probably made for children, even though the person in the photo appears to be an adult."
1.0,Well have to give a comment on something I have never gotten so I can say not worth the money
1.0,"Fit just perfect, however the word love is very hard to read:("
1.0,Not as pictured or expected.  Way too big!
1.0,I loved this dress style and bought it from a few Amazon vendors based on colors that were available. This brand of the dress definitely had the cheapest fabric which is why I returned it.
1.0,It fell a part after a short time
1.0,I had to wait 2.5 months for the coat to arrive. I was disappointed the size was very small even though it was supposed to be a large. It also isn't as nice as the picture potrays.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture nor big and chunky sleeves are cut short and completely different pattern then picture.
1.0,I do not normally leave bad veviews but these tore the FIRST time I wore them I contacted the seller twice so far and NO response and I bought 3 pair of there shoes. 2 tore the first time I wore them.
1.0,I got an XL that fits like a size 6/8. Ridiculous!!! Waste of money...seam to seam width 18inches..
1.0,It is not flattering at all. The top has an ugly clip button to keep it from opening. It’s fluffed on the bottom and doesn’t fall naturally so it makes you look fat. Horrible material too. Super cheap
1.0,Gave it to someone else because it was small
1.0,"I bought two of these cases.  Both broke the first time I used them.  The clip broke off and I didn't even have it on my belt for more than half a day.  If I could have given no stars, I would have.  It was a waste of money.  Very disappointed in that neither of the two lasted more than a few hours on my belt."
1.0,Showed me a picture of one thing an i got another not very happy
1.0,"Really pretty, but very poor quality. Necklace broke the first time worn. Very disappointed. You get what you pay for..."
1.0,"Cheap plastic with silver paint, the bracket fails off your wrist easily. My mother had in on for less than two hours and the heart fell off the bracket. Super cheap not worth buying it, it will probably fall off and you will lose it."
1.0,Got my sticker and the letter L is missing from smile
1.0,Very cheaply made. Very thin clingy material. Did not bother to return but did not wear it either.
1.0,Not flattering for my body type
1.0,Very unsatisfactory order. I ordered a medium. I received a very small hat. This hat was mislabeled. The size under the cap shows as a LARGE but this cap would probably not even fit a ten year old child.  How do I send it back?
1.0,See through and way smaller than should be.
1.0,Nice looking but doesn't do what it is intended for.
1.0,Thin and see through right through the fabric very sad as it was so cute
1.0,Extremely to big. Ordered for a casual dress beauty pageant but was way way to big.
1.0,"The watch arrived in it's box sealed in plastic, so I was of the impression it was brand new.... However the watch I received was missing its winding mechanism"
1.0,Ordered a size 3x and they won't even fit my daughter who wears a medium up large.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,"Since Ashford does not let bad reviews to be posted on its site - here I go.<br /><br />If you scan slickdeals and other deals sites you will see that a lot of people are having problems with poorly made movement of this watch - it gets stuck and can not be repaired, so - to give Ashford credits - they replace them. Stay away from Edox - it is either grey market item or quality is no longer there"
1.0,The material used was very heavy. Pants were 2 sizes too big and the top was waist length and too short. Returned
1.0,"Way too big, the arm pocket is so obnoxious and annoying. It was soft, that's about the only good thing about it."
1.0,"This was a super cute apron, quite heavier than I expected it to be -very high around the neck so that was quite uncomfortable and it tore at the seams the first time I washed it."
1.0,"I’ve only worn and washed these a handful of times… I bought as a comfortable option that’s easy for night nursing. I’m average height (about 5’ 6”) and the pants are at least 6 inches too long… if I pull them up above my belly button they’re still too long… so I decided to wear the top with different bottoms but then after maybe the 3rd or 4th wash a button broke in half. Would not recommend, wish I could return."
1.0,Cheap plastic.  Broke within a week
1.0,Very cheap and it never kept time
1.0,"Band came with only one side to attach to watch base, also appears to be used and not new returning right away"
1.0,"I had these flats for less than a month and they broke at work, where I sit down all day. It's upsetting because these were really cute and comfortable. And now I have to be at work all day with a broken sandal :("
1.0,"Smells bad, a little too tight, and plain ugly tbh."
1.0,This dress is way too uncomfortable on the neckline. It is very high and not something you can wear all day.
1.0,NOTHING LIKE PICTURES
1.0,Returned these simply because the fabric was soooooooooooo awful
1.0,Way too small. I ordered an XL based on everyone's rating and comments and it was way to small. I'm highly disappointed. I love the shirt and got it in both yellow and white but it's way too small.
1.0,"They are not long enough at all. Seem like they were made for a doll. Do not buy them unless you have an extremely tiny head, lol"
1.0,Very disappointed -size is completely misleading.  I bought this for a boy who wears a size 7 and the scrubs were too small to even get on while the lab coat swamped him.  All of these items were supposed to be the same size.A total waste of money.
1.0,This will make you look like a 5 year old.
1.0,Wet cheap looking. Should have returned
1.0,TERRIBLE!!! I am a glitter lover and thought this would be a prefect apron to wear at my hair salon....... I am so disappointed especially since it took forever to get delivered. Looks nothing like the photo.
1.0,It looks very cheap for the price
1.0,The robe is not what I expected. First of all it has no inside tie to keep it in place and so the robe opens. The material is cheap and thin. Returned it.
1.0,"I have numerous readers, cheap to pricey, that I can see through better than these.  I even have the first pair I ever bought back in 2005, that are clearer than these."
1.0,"I thought these would fit in my nose piercing…i was wrong. They were very thick (i guess i didn’t know what size piercing to get and that’s my fault) the ones i was able to get through, wouldn’t close all the way and some of them wouldn’t even allow me to open at all to be able to put in my nose. Definitely wouldn’t buy again, as i’m not able to use any of them."
1.0,Se rompieron de una vez
1.0,The shoes are very cheaply made. My 4 year old tore them up within 2 weeks.
1.0,"Said 6 pieces. I got one, so I returned it. Very misleading."
1.0,I'm average size women..Those belts are made to fit women with a size5..I was so upset..it was my birthday party and I had to link 2belts together for it to fit..and I looked jacked up..so I took them off and threw them in the trash..
1.0,The dress is made with very cheap material. You can see completely thru the dress and it is smaller that what's expected.
1.0,Way too small.  Not the best quality.
1.0,no most of them broke within a week of wearing them.
1.0,Ordered 6 of these for bridesmaids. Picture online shows a deep violet. When delivered only one was deep violet the 5 others are light lilac. Will not all match unhappy.
1.0,"Misleading product photos and description! You only get one cat. Maybe it used to be more but the one I ordered in 2021 was only one cat. And it was the one I didn't like lol. Not worth the money, you aren't getting five!"
1.0,The material that this bag is made from is basically a hard plastic. It is very heavy and very stiff. The bag itself is lopsided  which I didn’t realize until after my return window had closed. I definitely would’ve return this bag if I had not been preoccupied with things at the time.
1.0,"This is not a cross back apron. It is not sewed that way, but instead attaches on the same side, which is not what is pictured. I may have to return this. I noticed someone else said this before, but thought the seamstress had gotten one wrong. This one is wrong too, so maybe they all are. It is sewn closed across the back also, not open, like a cross-back apron usually  is ."
1.0,They are very soft. But. They she’d like crazy. There is fur all over my house and my clothes. I would not recommend. I have purchased a similar pair and they never did this.
1.0,It's cut all wrong.  It fits and looks like an overpriced Halloween costume.
1.0,Just received these today. I just took out of bubble mailer. I did not even open plastic and looks like I might only be able to use 2 sets if I’m lucky.
1.0,Extremely Large. I ordered a XL and got a tent.
1.0,Doesn't stay upright - disappointed but it was only $2 so no big deal.
1.0,One night and the batteries blew up- brand new batteries! Can’t even shut off except to take out batteries out.
1.0,I wear a size 4 and there was no way I could put these on!<br />Seemed light weight.  I couldn't wear them so that's all I can offer as a review.
1.0,WAY to large. My son is a 3T and I ordered the 24M-4T and they have to be tied really tight to stay on him. The string is pretty piercing on his waists with now type of padding.
1.0,"I received the package already, but it doesn't look like in the picture, and the size isn't the one I choose"
1.0,was not as expected do not buy
1.0,"I ordered this for my husband after comparing it to other similar bags and reading the reviews. When I opened it I noticed that the tags had been removed, and thought maybe it had already been returned. It didn't seem in perfectly new condition. When I gave it to him forr his birthday, we realized the zipper did not work and had clearly been tried and kinked before. I am disappointed. We will probably try ordering another one and give it one more chance since it seems like a good product and maybe we just got a defect."
1.0,Wide and stitched to make it look like you have shoulder pads. Style and material are great but whoever stitched it did a terrible job
1.0,Poor quality not at all as it looks in the picture. Length was also much shorter than expected based on the way it looks on the model
1.0,Zipper was broken upon arrival.
1.0,Only gave it a star because that's the only way I could leave a review. One of the straps came broken. Very dissatisfied.
1.0,"This is a terribly made dress.  I ordered one, and when I got it, there were HUGE holes around the waist.  I sent it back and got another one.  This time it started to rip in the same spots after washing.  Save your money and don't buy it."
1.0,*****WORN BY SOMEONE ELSE!! SENT BACK AND SENT TO ME. DOG HAIR ALL OVER IT. FOOD IN THE POCKET. DISGUSTING! SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE!!!!!
1.0,"The ""claws"" which are why most will buy these, fall off constantly. I've tried using super glue, and my hot glue gun, and when I go out to weed my garden, I'm gathering the claws that feel off, into my pockets. Don't waste your money."
1.0,Not near as nice color as picture .  Not nice material.
1.0,I have had Qali rings before and I love them.  I ordered a size 6 and this one is like 2-3 sizes too big
1.0,Case is what was expected sipper broke completely off on the the first few open and closing...  Basically useless not at this point!
1.0,Very small. I wpuld guess they are made for women size 6 or 7. I could barely get my feet in these.
1.0,Very cheap looking..
1.0,Bent as soon as i opened them way too small and flimsy so mad i wasted my time and money..dont buy these
1.0,"Bought this for my daughter who is  between a small and medium. Based on the reviews I ordered a medium and large.<br />The medium was too tight on the chest and the arms were way too short. The large was overall too wide however the sleeves again were way to short?! Plus the fabric is extremely thin, I sent both back, just didn't want to deal with it. Seemed like if any of the sizes fit you, it would only be a one time wear anyways because the material seemed like if you washed it, it would've probably either shrunk too much to ever wear again or would probably fall apart. Like I said, I sent both back, unfortunately, I wanted these to work because they looked super cute online and on the model but it just didn't work out that way. I would say, don't waste your money"
1.0,Received ONE and returned it as the pattern was ugly and the listing is quite deceptive. You only get one and it takes a week to be delivered. I went on the actual Johnny Was website and bought a pack of 5 for $25. I highly recommend just going directly to the brand for the legit product.
1.0,"This was a cheap plastic apron, with the material being like the aprons at the 99 cent store. Thin, cheap, disposable, plastic-looking material. It’s disappointing because it costs upward of $30. I bought this as a gift and when it arrived it was so cheap and the plastic was all creased that it looks like I had paid a dollar for it, and I couldn’t gift that, so I returned it as it was not as advertised in the photos. I was expecting something of better material and quality for this price."
1.0,"Skirt fit okay but the top is extremely small, even sizing up from original size. The material is very thin and see through/sheer. We returned the item. I don’t recommend."
1.0,Not the best quality but were very cheap.
1.0,It was supposed to be flannel it is sheer thin an nothing like what I ordered. I never got a call from them. I'm very disappointed an I needed the shirt for warmth an it was not it an no customer service
1.0,These bras poke into your sides and rub.
1.0,"4/2/19  It's a shame, such great colors on such unwearable socks.  I wear a size 9 shoe, but I ordered a pair of size XL, equal to a men's size 14, because other reviews said they are very tight in the ankle.  IMPOSSIBLY TIGHT. TOURNIQUET TIGHT.  LEAVE  DEEP LINES IN YOUR SKIN AFTER 5 MINUTES.  They arrived only slightly smelly, but knitted threads were already broken throughout, & the cheap quality made it obvious these socks were headed to return home.  The colors & design are a great idea, but the cheap quality and ridiculous sizing turned a good idea into an awful disaster."
1.0,Pónganse de acuerdo que talla mandan pedí (M) y me mandaron (xxL) lo devolví y al final no recibí mi dinero y tampoco el pantalón  pésimo no compraría más en esa tienda es ma ni una estrella se merece.
1.0,SOOO angry and disappointed. This coverall is ONE PIECE and HAS NO POCKET. NOT what I was looking for and NOT what is shown on their product page! Grrrrrrr.
1.0,Collar is way to big and floppy. Nothing like the picture.
1.0,This shirt looks nothing like the picture. It looks like a VERY cheap version of this. The plaid looks like an out of focus digital image of plaid. Also the red is like a pink/coral. I would definitely not reccomend this shirt!
1.0,This jacket is not what I expected. It is not as long as in the picture. It’s is very pretty and soft. I had an issue with it being short more of a cropped fit.
1.0,i usually wear a large but my friend told me they run small so i got an xxl and still way toooo small ! ugh!
1.0,Gaudy and cheap looking. Looks like I should be standing on a street corner.
1.0,"I wear a woman's XXL and this shirt is NOT and XXL, this is a juniors L at most. I am  5'9&#34; tall, 225lbs, in fitted clothing I wear a 16/18. This at best is an 11/12. Not to mention it has a short torso, barely hit my hips. Not near as cute as the picture would indicate that it is."
1.0,"When I received it I loved it, &#34;Grandma&#34; graving is really good but it is very difficult to get the picture in. Also Necklace is getting bad, color start to change to black :("
1.0,I ordered the medium and guess what? It fits my 9 year old. She wears a medium but for CHILDREN. Very strange sizing.
1.0,Ordered a youth medium for daughter. Tag even says youth. It was too large even for me a six foot adult man. Sizing is so far off to the point of ridiculousness.
1.0,They are very pretty but could not wear then made for a child not an adult.  I also have small wrist and still way to tight
1.0,Whose the extra Backstreet boy between Nick and Brian?
1.0,Very thin. Pilling on inner thighs after only 1 wear. Discovered a hole after only two hours of wear. At 9.99 I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0,Returned.  Looks cheap.
1.0,I am very disappointed with this . I’ve had other  kimonos from this brand but this time the one I got had a hole and the tag is gone it’s like someone ripped it off. Hopefully it gets resolved soon. I was going to wear it this Saturday but I will end up not wearing it. I already left a message and hoping I get a reply back.
1.0,This dress doesn't look like what I order it's not flowing a mess don't waste your time ordering this dress.
1.0,Speaker is poor quality and not loud enough
1.0,Beautiful but runs small. Will be returning.
1.0,It's pretty but the pin fell out already and the glass covering the hands also fell off. It breaks too easily. Im sad bc it os so pretty but it is also way too big and my wrist is pretty big.
1.0,"The sleeper that arrived was similar, but not the same as the picture. The item is a grey background with turkeys, pumpkins, and leaves. Still has the turkey footies."
1.0,"super cute but does not fit I want to return it , but I waited too long. Im stuck with this item"
1.0,Did not recieve as stated I did
1.0,"This was an all around big nope.  I wanted to love, it was a cute idea, but the material was terrible, and the fit was not at all flattering.  Returned"
1.0,Super thin cheap material. Very poorly designed. The chest area is awkwardly low and loose. See through in natural lighting.
1.0,Very cheap quality and did NOT come with carrying case.
1.0,"The shirt itself is nice, thick quality. It’s a shame that the image is completely crooked and off center. Returning.<br />Also, the shirt is navy blue not gray and it’s not distressed looking as the listing shows."
1.0,Don’t buy it! This was bought as a gift for our daughter and it was broken after just a day. The watch never worked properly and the screen was blank after just one day. We were never able to set it up or use it. A waste of time and money. Our daughter was very disappointed with her birthday gift. Very low quality. Not worth the money.
1.0,Tooo tight
1.0,Piece of junk came broken
1.0,Its not worth the money. Not sturdy and waterproof as claims. Only thing is its compact thats it!
1.0,"I wanted to love this dress. The fit was weird, the waist was waaay too high. I am average height, 5'6"", but i couldn't wear this because of the fit. Didn't hang right. I returned it."
1.0,"These are a cheap pantyhose material. And, they have a really bad smell to them. Threw them away."
1.0,I bought this watch for my daughter's 5th birthday which was this past Saturday and open the watch and it wouldn't turn on. I went to see if I could return but I had already passed the return window.
1.0,This product arrived and was smaller than any other shirt I have ever worn in my size. I returned it.
1.0,"Had to send it back, the description shows one size fits all and it's not true, way too small like a child size."
1.0,I gave it one star because it is really cute! However it did not last very long. Within a couple weeks the string that holds the small beads broke and all the beads fell off. Waste of money
1.0,fit was AWFUL
1.0,"Not at all what I wad expecting! It's a silky itchy material and, it's way to small!"
1.0,Too bulky and can’t touch anything
1.0,Disappointed... Too small for my 10 year old. More so sized to fit very small children/toddler.
1.0,I loved this band till it turned my arm green would love to get it replaced but no one answers my emails will definitely not buy again.
1.0,Awful. Too big in the chest and sits awkwardly high on the neck. The straps are too small at the top and too loose at the bottom
1.0,"Really like the look and the comfort factor; however, after several washings the black dye still rubs off.  Touch the exterior of the pants and your fingers will be black.  Concerned about color transfer to furniture, car seat, etc.  NOT recommended."
1.0,"HATED these - they looked cheap, and hurt as soon as I put them on! I returned them right away."
1.0,"These looked like a great idea when I saw them. Too bad they when I got them, I couldn’t even get them over my thighs. Even ordered one size up from their sizing chart. Amazon credited me & made it right. Just a bummer because I really wanted them."
1.0,All 3 of the bras are an XL and as you can tell by the picture the black one is a good inch bigger than the other two. I’m a 38D and got a size up thinking it’d fit and it was still way too tight.
1.0,"I ordered this on Oct 23 and paid extra for 2 day shipping. I received it a whopping twelve days later on Nov 4th. Costume does me no good after Halloween, just a low quality cheap outfit taking up space in my life. Total waste of $30 + $12 shipping."
1.0,Sent me the wrong dress! Not even the same not at all bought this to wear tonight I’m very upset VERY don’t buy this !!
1.0,LOOKS VERY CHEAP
1.0,This shirt is not white it's off white the print is cheap and the shirt has a funny smell to it. Only worth about $7.
1.0,"This product is absolute trash. Color not as depicted, material is cheap, printed on only one side, and unless you're skull it the same size as a 6 year old this won't be a COMFORTABLE fit let alone ""slouchy"". I tried it on and I have a big dome and had to literally peel it off my head because it was squeezing it so tight. It sucks, don't buy it."
1.0,"Really small and doesn’t look at all like the photo. Has cheaply made holes in it, not distressed like the photo. Don’t waste your money"
1.0,"It says bladder included but it was not there. Otherwise, we like the pack."
1.0,"I have this dress in two different colors, both are size small. The light blue one with pink details fits perfectly, while this white dress is HUGE. Tag says small but it fits like a large. I was swimming in it. I want to exchange for size but I'm nervous as to what I will get when I return this one.  Unfortunate because it is a really cute dress. Just be aware of the sizing."
1.0,"Terrible product, completely fell apart after one use."
1.0,"It doesn’t look the same as the picture. The color is not light blue, but darker blue. It doesn’t look pretty but looks cheap with darker sky blue. Also the sleeves don’t look that pretty like the picture. It’s a bit longer so it doesn’t look cute. I would not wear it because it looks pretty cheap due to its color and design."
1.0,"Loved the dress in the picture, but this was not the dress I received. The dress got was not a wrap dress, was dark green and and had a flower on the neckline. I will be returning it. So disappointed."
1.0,Flimsy and cheap product as they broke in just a few weeks with regular and gentle use.  Great look but I would not buy again.
1.0,"The box is beautiful, but, useless if the motor does not function. And, the unit was not being used constantly and been in use for 1 month before it failed to turn."
1.0,"These socks simply do not provide any benefit.  I tried several configurations of socks, none of which kept my feet warm.  The last try was a pair of these socks, a pair of light cotton socks over them, and a pair of heavy wool socks over them.  My feet were not crowded in my winter boots, yet my feet still got cold after about one hour in 15-20 degree weather."
1.0,"So, it said it was a men’s XL..... it’s not a men’s XL. This is a female medium at best. It’s not as long in the waist as it was in the pic unless that guy is 5’0”,  the sleeves are impossibly tight. The chest is tight, everything is tight."
1.0,Too small.  Garment has no size label so you can’t tell what size you got.  Waste of money.
1.0,Really cheap product. Metal is distorted. Shape of baby elephant is warped.
1.0,Was way too small but decided to give it to my 12 year old niece. it fit her size 2 frame just fine.
1.0,Not well made 👎
1.0,It's like a child's size
1.0,"Ordered a 38DD, which is my true measured size, it was extremely tight on my ribs on the looses clips. However I could not tighten the shoulder straps enough to hold the bra in place, poor proportions, this company doesn’t understand women’s bodies."
1.0,"So there is the lining at the bottom of the bathing suit, which is good. But after I took it off, the sticky goo will NOT come off the bathing suit. I've washed it in the washing machine several times and scrubbed it with my hands, soaked it in the sink overnight....I can NOT get the sticky stuff off. It is unwearable. I missed my return date so it is going in the garbage."
1.0,Don't be fooled. Do not buy this cap.
1.0,Returned. Not worth it. The shell of the toes were deformed.
1.0,"My wife really liked this ""bling band"" and received lots of compliments but this band is apparently not for ""everyday use""<br />The elastic in the band has failed in several places and started looking pretty bad with the string hanging out of the beads. Had to order another band which does not depend on elastic to keep it on the wrist. Item was a great price but could have been a bit better quality."
1.0,Don’t buy!!! Trust me this isn’t worth giving away.
1.0,Broke in less than an hour<br />Total garbage
1.0,It was a gift.  Not happy about quality!!!
1.0,My son has worn these for less than two months and they are already destroyed. The liner inside came out and the sole is worn through. These are junk.
1.0,The silver is rubbing off like paint. Doesn’t look new or pretty at all anymore. It’s cheap quality & I’m very disappointed in this purchase. Not even stamped 925 like all sterling silver is. Wouldn’t buy again from this company.
1.0,It's to thin anything spills on it is going to go right through to the shirt it supposed to protect I suggest that not wasting your money
1.0,"I loved these when they arrived and the fit well on my 5,7, and 9 year old. We swim often and one broke on the first use. Another broke a few days later. My kids do not swim without goggles so they took very good care of them. Even stored them in the plastic container they came in. Disappointed in their quality."
1.0,"Necklace was ruined within a month, tarnished sand broken."
1.0,After wearing the band for a few days it loosened up so bad I can’t wear it at all. It’s just another member of the junk box now.
1.0,"I have purchased wings like this before so I know how they're made - just wire with some colored panty hose type of material stretched over it. I didn't have particularly high expectations, I just thought the lights were a nice touch. NOPE. They were just strings hanging off the wings with a tiny light at the end - you could see the glue spot where they might have been attached, but terrible construction. There are better wings out there. Don't bother with these."
1.0,Way to small.  Not made for the average person.
1.0,Was supposed to be an extra large but it fits very small
1.0,"ITS MADE OF SOME CHEAP PLASTIC AND THAT GOT BROKE OFF VERY EASILY.<br />DO NOT BUY IT , DO NOT WASTE MONEY!!"
1.0,Have to repair in order to use!
1.0,Very poorly made. One was torn before I took it out of the packaging. I passed out 8 more at a party and at least 5-6 fell apart within an hour. Very disappointing.
1.0,Its awful and deformed... my son can't use use it as a toy costume!  Its hazardous to wear be can get hurt
1.0,I would have give a five star because of the cute design BUT it faded on the first wash. So when i used it the first time it already looks like I’ve used it for a year. I’m disappointed.
1.0,"These sound , look and feel like plastic. I'm very allergic and had the usual cheap plastic earring reaction . They asked to have them sent back. I'm Assuming to re sell so beware.  Shame on you people for selling plastic junk as organic jewelry. Allergies are very serious and now I have to suffer because you lied."
1.0,This earrings are beautiful but are way to small. I gave them to my two year old niece and they fit her great
1.0,"Extremely disappointed. My son received these on Nov. 2nd and after wearing them once, they got a hole in them. I thought they would hold up much better. I would like a refund."
1.0,"Although the leotard is not see through, it doesn't fit. Regardless if you have a long or short torso the body suit wont clasp shut. In fact it doesn't even reach past your belly button. Super tight too. Not worth it if if you can't even get it to snap together."
1.0,Not as shown in picture. Stripes are straight around not angled at all.
1.0,"I was very disappointed when the product came. It was poorly made and the cotton lining inside was not sewed on properly in the sweater and looks like it would disintegrate in the wash.<br /><br />On the plus side, the seller gave me a discount on the purchase price. I didn't want to go through the hassle of having to return it to overseas..."
1.0,They are way too long. They drag on the floor. They also have a very high waistline to the point of geing uncomfortable.
1.0,Super cute was exited but on top of fitting a lil small the stitching was fishing string and the sew end pieces would stick up and poke my kids feet and she  Was like “aww aww hurt” so returned them the same day I got them. Ended up getting socks with lil rubber grips under them and she keeps em on and does not slip on the tile floor.
1.0,The gloves feel extremely tight and are very hot on ur hands while you have them on.
1.0,The first day I put on my uniform I looked down and the entire pin and my glasses were gone. Never to be seen again.
1.0,"Definitely not what I was expecting. In the photo, the dress looks like it would lay nicely, with bold colors, but when it came it was very dull. The material was also thinking and clingy. Returned."
1.0,It broke. They won’t send a new one or refund me.
1.0,"very light weight, super cute colors and long enough to wrap as hijab but not wide enough for full coverage. the first package i received 5 of the scarves were damaged like, little rips in them. i returned those for a new package and still those were damaged as well one was even stained. don’t purchase, shein has beautiful ones made of same material and in better condition also wider."
1.0,False advertisement.  Fabric is not what it said it was.  Very cheaply made.
1.0,I ordered the Red Neck Lace tanktop and what I received was an ORANGE tank top
1.0,"Don’t buy here, it’s cheaper at a BSA store. Cheaply made. Not worth $17."
1.0,Came tiny nylon sleeves. Was listed as 100 percent linen
1.0,My earrings came with all the stones falling out 😔
1.0,I wore the belt for about a mont then the belt loop came off
1.0,If you don't mind your nips showing... this is the bra for you. When they say &#34;swimsuit-like&#34; fabric they mean VERY thin swimsuit fabric.
1.0,"I had ordered a size X-Large and will be returning because this s*** is not true to size,  it actually looks like a medium."
1.0,Damage in and out and I open all the colors is mixing together.
1.0,The metal is dented and dinged up. The faux leather is a very different color than the elastic band. The belt is much smaller than stated in the listing.  Just because an item is a bargain doesn't mean that it has to look cheap.<br /><br />Amazon won't provide a return shipping label since the belt came from a third party seller in China. I won't be spending any more of my money to return this thing.
1.0,They came with holes in them. I asked for Black and Blue but only got Blue and they had holes in them by the upper forearm. Unsatisfied!
1.0,The galaxy watch 3 is pretty big and this wristband look way too small on it.
1.0,"Gorgeous stone, but the ring got redish after a few months of use and lost its &#34;silver like&#34; color."
1.0,El color del vestido no se ve como yo esperaba
1.0,It is really sharp and digs into your belly button. It also causes infection because the metal is made so cheap. Not worth the buy
1.0,I ordered the XL. It  was too small. I then ordered the XXL. It also was too small. I need to return both of them.
1.0,Avoid this
1.0,Not as pictured. Came very wrinkled.. no red straps as shown
1.0,It fit like a Halloween costume and felt like one to.
1.0,The clasp broke down after a couple weeks. Having the 2 magnets makes it really annoying to use. the band eventually broke down after the return window closed so I can't return it as well which is frustrating.
1.0,The zipper ripped off the other side
1.0,"After wearing them for a few days, the back posting broken off completely."
1.0,Junk it is cheap and very misleading it don’t fit anyone’s ponytail unless you are a child. I don’t know who this is made for let alone the quality is substandard!!! For a company 4 states away it took weeks to get the product. Don’t buy anything from this vendor!!!!
1.0,"This dress is super cute but is completely see through! I will be returning it, too short to wear with a slip."
1.0,Cute gag gift but it fell apart on day one…
1.0,"El pantalon tiene licra interno color blanco, y con esas letrss escribas"
1.0,I like the material.. hated the fit!!
1.0,It broke after my daughter had been wearing it just a few days.
1.0,Awful material. Had elastic sound jacket not nice like picture. Fit awful. Wanted to return. Come to find out it came from China and cost $27.00 for postage. Jacket cost $15
1.0,Cheaply made and too small a zipper to put card or money in.
1.0,Ugh what was i thinking
1.0,"Arrived broken, like others have said! Luckily, it's my intention to cut it up and decorate a costume with it. Would not recommend it for an actual necklace. Very cheap and poorly made."
1.0,Jamas llego...
1.0,Returned. Very poor quality.
1.0,Was not expecting much and was true to form. Band pretty terrible.
1.0,"Product is nothing more than a molded black rubber band, not at all comparable to the strap keeper provided with the O.E. band. Looks cheap. Not a good value at $2.00 per unit."
1.0,Links aren’t soldered together came apart first wear. I’m sad
1.0,"If you're looking for a shoe to slip on and take the garbage out...No sorry, don't even buy them even then.  There is no support and I'm not talking just about arch support.  It actually feels like my foot might slide sideways at any moment (& twist an ankle or two).  The shoes are very rudimentary.  Someone (probably some poor young child working 14 hours a day) (and I don't mean to slight their work so please don't beat them) had to take 75% of a circle out of leather (like a pie with two slices gone) (and, yes, it actually appears to be leather) then hand sew it (yes it does appear to be hand sewn) with a leather cord, and finished with a leather &#34;shoelace&#34; item - however, even if you cinch it to it's tightest it does not make the shoe fit tighter on your foot.  Then the moccasin type design is glued to a large, bumpy, rubber sole that can be felt through the bottom of the shoe.  But maybe some people don't mind these things.  I four hours I wore them at work, I did get one compliment - that they comfortable."
1.0,"Product too small and material is very low grade, thin & see through. Also don't expect to get your money back when you return it. It has been a month now and nothing."
1.0,I received a different color from the picture!!!!
1.0,La compré por que pensé que era de mejor calidad.
1.0,"When I received bag in December 2017, one of the two zips for the sneaker compartment broke off while I was unzipping it for the first time. Nevertheless I decided not to return it as the second zipper seemed sturdy enough. However I quickly realized that I didn’t care for the soft texture of the bag’s material as it made it awkward to put the sneakers in its compartment. Additionally the bag doesn’t have a long strap. I also noticed that I saw flayed edges and thread from both zip sections of the bag after only a few uses. Last week the second zipper of the sneaker compartment broke off while unzipping at the gym. Needless to say I threw the bag away when I got home. You get what you pay for. The concept of the bag is great but the construction, material and zippers are of very inferior quality."
1.0,Ordered a black band and was sent a silver one and it didn't fit any way...smh
1.0,Snagged and tore<br />Within a month
1.0,So gross. My tunic came in a sealed inner bag. When I opened it the top was inside out with one sleeve tucked inside. It had antiperspirant stains on it?? I get people return things - but clean them people!
1.0,"This chain lasted all of two days before we woke up with it broken. Had high hopes, however was disappointed"
1.0,"I cannot even begin to describe how disappointed at these earrings.<br /><br />First of all, the shape of one of the earring is tilted.<br /><br />And there were no earring backs at all.<br /><br />I am thinking someone must have returned these (probably for tilted shape), and it was repacked without being checking the earring backs were included or not.<br /><br />If this was like something $20-30 ones, I wouldn't even worried about it.<br /><br />But they proudly promotes about its '925 Sterling Silver EARRING BACKS: post with friction back' on the product detail page.<br /><br />And the overall quality of earring isn't even great, and I wouldn't pay for the full price even if it came with earring backs.  Even for the price I paid, I am mad !<br /><br />Really really unhappy !!!"
1.0,Not comfortable really cheap
1.0,"Maybe I misunderstood what &#34;asymmetrical&#34; meant with this? I thought it meant front to back, not side to side. In any case, the one I got is way longer on one side than the other - not like the listing picture or other reviewers' pics. If it wasn't irregular, I'd love it! Gonna order again and cross my fingers. I wanted it for a Christmas party this coming weekend. I'll update my review if the next one isn't AFU."
1.0,I won't give even 1 star to it. VERY uncomfortable and wayyyyyyyy to big to put on.
1.0,Can't see with them
1.0,I bought these goggles for my kids to use at swim team. All the pairs broke after first use at the nose. The item has a hard plastic nose piece and all of the cracked snapping in half.
1.0,"Ear socks fit fine, nosepiece did not fit genuine Oakley lenses. Could not get it to snap on no matter what I tried. Came in a bag, definitely not Oakley brand accessories."
1.0,"Way too small!! The pkg it came in said a 4x, it fit like a large. Poor quality"
1.0,"My first one broke in less than a week.  It was replaced with no issue, in fact she sent me two.  Both of those broke in less than 2 weeks.  Beautiful, but very poor quality."
1.0,This product runs extremely small.
1.0,It’s not durable and the thread is unraveling straight out of the package. Very rough cheap material and a cheap zipper that catches.
1.0,"I’ve had other flip flops from this brand that I loved. Not sure what they did with this style but it’s shorter and has a weird heel. It’s like the heel portion doesn’t feel flat…feels like you’re walking on a hard ball! Very uncomfortable. Not worth the trouble to return, but I can’t wear these longer than it takes to let the dog out to potty."
1.0,I returned it.  did not fit like my other Cutter & Buck shirts.  Tight across the shoulders and chest.  Also did not like the fabric.
1.0,The wallet is smaller than expected had to purchase another type to hold my credit cards because they are very difficult getting them out of the button.  Disappointed.
1.0,There was no color
1.0,Too small🙃
1.0,"I thought these were headbands,but they are just rubber bands"
1.0,"Probably two sizes too small, normally wear an XL and this doesn't come close to fitting."
1.0,Not a good quality product
1.0,Shirt was long to right above my knee and I'm 6'.
1.0,"The execution and quality of this dress is abysmal.  Cheap, clingy, thin fabric.  The dress does not fall as in the picture. Keep your money.  At best this dress may show up in a bin in a retail overstock store."
1.0,"This is definitely not the perfect dress for all. Terrible fit.  Too tight in the chest, too loose in the waist.  Sleeves were very tight as well.  This was returned right away."
1.0,I JUST RECIEVED MY DRESS IN THE MAIL AND THERE IS NO LACE ONCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE.... I do not want to return the item it’s just Missing the lace! What do I do?!?!?!
1.0,These pajamas run REALLY large. Thecmaterial is soft but very flimsy. If held to the light they are see thru.
1.0,There is so much other writing on the cap that I don’t know or care about . Only one place does it say Mercedes Benz! I feel like I paid you to be walking commercial for Grand Turismo and FTX! Who the F are they? So darn disappointed to be wearing this mess!
1.0,Broke in less than 5 mins. Not sturdy at all.. sad because it was really pretty
1.0,Looks unflattering like a blanket
1.0,Too scary
1.0,"The skirt I received has no tag on it, and it has lots of wrinkles. I suspect if it is new. Very disappointed!"
1.0,"The Bra fit is super weird. It has no support on the bottom. Super pointy & weird looking boob tips. The straps are super comfortable, but unless you like madona bra tips I wouldn't recommend it."
1.0,Dislike nothing like the picture
1.0,Dress fits smaller that the size. Its also very tight at the legs. But very cute dress once you have a better fitting size.
1.0,The top was EXTREMELY too small and the bottom was too big... the sizes were not as described AT ALL.
1.0,not really vaurnet quality  i expected plastic lens
1.0,Worst clothing I have ever seen! Literally was falling apart when I received it! I won't even dare put my baby in it because he will choke on all the strings coming off of it! DO NOT BUY!!
1.0,These sunglasses are crap! They look nice....but the cheap lenses keep falling out no matter how many times you attempt to pop them back in. The don't even pop back in all the way. Take the time to buy and try in store!!
1.0,Very odd fit and fabric is not jersey as stated. Feels like swim suit material. Doesn’t look like the pictures. Hot and cheaply made. I say skip sis.
1.0,doesnt look anything like the picture. its short like a belly shirt and the collar is squared....not anything I was looking for.
1.0,Sad they don’t make a bigger size.
1.0,To thin and see through
1.0,very small for size 10 still waiting for credit or replacement in smaller size<br />PLEASE ADVISE
1.0,Ugly shirt. Too short to even wear. Almost like a belly shirt! Awkwardly made.
1.0,"Rip very easy, and not very good quality. I bought multiple pairs as presents and I wish I would have sent them all back..."
1.0,not at all what was expected  - returned product
1.0,The material is very cheap and it slid down my body all day. I would not reccommend this product.
1.0,Package only contained 14 bracelets.
1.0,I’ve had it in my possession all of 15 minutes and the zipper broke while I was trying it on...waste of money. Should’ve just gone to Target.
1.0,The metal card came with no “T”’s on it. To me fuure faher in-law that’s what it says
1.0,VERY NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT I DID NOT EXPECT IT TO BE THIS BAD
1.0,I had brought this for my daughter's birthday present dropped it off not looking at the product she goes to put it on and there's no clasp to put it on  embarrassing and shows how cheaply made I wo ui kid only pay 5$ for this
1.0,had trouble getting the clasp to snap finally did ..first day it fell off before lunch..lost it not worth the money
1.0,"This item is not white, it looks like the white fabric was washed with a red shirt or something. It has a punkish tint. Horrible."
1.0,It had a terrible crease and bend in the front that made it look terrible. Returned one and reordered. Same deal with the replacement if not a little worse.
1.0,"The print is reversed, any buckeye knows ih-oh is not how we roll! The fabric was great the fit a little large."
1.0,The had would have fit a toddler perfectly. I ordered an xl it was tiny and extremely see through. Don’t buy this. Walmart has better options
1.0,"Junk!! Buyer be aware, do not purchase. Will not fit an adult head. This must be made for a small child... :("
1.0,Turned ankle green in the first week. Really disappointed
1.0,broke as I was trying them on
1.0,Product poor quality and was unable to return the product.
1.0,Band does not attach to Face watch part. Does not work
1.0,Really hurts as a toe ring. Not very comfortable to wear
1.0,It was so beautiful but I realized it was broken when I took it out of the package. Such a shame.
1.0,"Nice looking watch band for sure. However it was hard to put together. I had to buy link/pin remover to size it. Band broke 2 days after wearing. Lost my watch, but recovered it in the driveway several days later."
1.0,Don’t buy. They change colors. didn’t even wanna give ONE start. rather none.
1.0,This dress is completely sheer. You need another shift dress underneath. I returned.
1.0,"They look like the photo yes but they do not work the clamp does not stay closed at all, will be returning."
1.0,Doesn't not fit
1.0,"Terrible quality, stitching of sole came apart after one use"
1.0,"Mom had to have surgery for broken hip, went to rehab and has lost lot of weight. Had to send item back for refund."
1.0,"The print is VERY poor quality and I got a rash from the cheap metal. It also comes apart easily if you are not careful. This is not a good purchase, would not recommend!"
1.0,Product was VERY small. Be sure to size up at least  2 sizes. It was even smaller than the size chart mentioned
1.0,they pilled quickly and was unable to use my phone with them within two days of wearing them.
1.0,"I have 2 other heated scarves that were better electronic quality (Both from Akaso as one of them is still working nearly after a year of daily use).  This scarf is a big larger and very soft material, but was sketchy in its electrical operation the first day and then stopped working after a few Turn On's.  Certainly obvious why it is no longer available."
1.0,It’s thinner than a sweatshirt. Definitely not as was as it looks.
1.0,"Okay. It’s nice these have pockets.  But these SUCK. They both roll down, and also get this huge two-inch gap at the crotch. I have never experienced a pair of yoga pants that can fail so epically. Just pure crap."
1.0,I intended to have a nice detailed black ring. Came with magenta (pink) gems that are not pictured. Cannot see any of the details on the side of ring. Was not the ring they are advertising
1.0,was not able to wear this for 10 seconds without it falling off.  The backing is not good and I would not buy this product ever again. Horrible quality
1.0,"i order two shirts from different venders. What a difference, this vendor shirt was too large and the insides were stuck together. When I pulled them apart the inside of shirt was harsh on the skin. I order shirt from the hottess and it is perfect large is a good fit and the shirt is soft and comfortable.  This is an unbiased review I care about people ordering unsatisfactory products."
1.0,Horrible item very fake plastics about the material........oversized in physical quality in 120lbs my husband 220 and he still fit into itnwhere it shows it snug and more pleather like material.
1.0,I ordered a Womens large and got what seems to be a kids small. There were holes in the seams where the thread was just coming undone. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!
1.0,Wore one time and then it broke...
1.0,"I bought 1 band and only one side would click into place as others have said.  I really liked the band, so I tried again.  Neither side would click into place on the 2nd band.  This is ridiculous.  What does it matter how cute it looks if it can't perform its primary and only function, which is to securely fasten my watch onto my wrist?  Both bands are going back and I'm still searching for a good alternative to the horrible band that comes on the Samsung Gear Fit2."
1.0,They took about a month to get here and they where too small
1.0,After a few days of wearing they started to turn black...
1.0,"They are very light and made with cheep material. Not worth the price. I returned them. I did get my money back! They say pink, when you get them they are more gold. Not pink! You can see my eyes right threw them!"
1.0,The earrings were beautiful and I couldn't wait to wear them.<br />Broke and fell apart with in the first hour I had them on.
1.0,"This shirt technically fits, but the fabric didn’t seem to stretch or give at all so it wasn’t very comfy in my opinion."
1.0,Very cheap it broke before my daughter could put it on!
1.0,The blue in the flowers on bottom of dress was not the same color as the blue at the top so we returned and received a refund.
1.0,"These earrings are leaving my ears itchy, red, and discolored around the holes after just half a day! Definitely do not recommend!!"
1.0,Made my ear way too sore... not something you can leave in more than a day.
1.0,Has sharp edges. Very uncomfortable and hard to put on.
1.0,So this is a nice looking watch but I have already had to work on the band to get it to close properly and I was disappointed when I discovered the bezel doesn’t rotate like description says. Glad I only paid $23. because it’s a $25 watch. Will update later when I have had time with this watch. Did not include microfiber cloth. Disappointed to say the least.
1.0,"My first sweaty band was amazing. The second one, not so much. It's way too big and slides right off. Very disappointed. 15 dollars for a small piece of fabric is a lot when I can't even wear it. :("
1.0,It broke within 1 week
1.0,"The floral print was blurry and the fabric was weird and shiny. This fit more like a maternity dress, with the elastic right under the bust line. The pictures on the product page make it seem like the elastic is at the waist, but it is definitely much higher. And the company wants me to pay the return shipping. Not impressed."
1.0,"I ended up returning this. Weird fit. Too much extra fabric on the back, and too tight from the neck to the armpit. Too bad.. I really wanted to like it."
1.0,"they were broken and had been worn parts missing one earring off the tag, and didnt close.  also tassles missing"
1.0,The stitching wore through in the sleeve on first wash.
1.0,"GARBAGE. Do not waste your money. They will turn your ears green and, if you have sensitive ears like me, possibly infected. I literally had them in 2 days."
1.0,This looks nothing like the picture it’s more like a gaiter not a toboggan
1.0,Did not stay in my nose for at least 5 minutes even it fell out as soon as I ate into my food
1.0,"Doesn't stay tight, always gets loose and falls off even when knotting it after tightening it."
1.0,Got this the beginning of October.  Now broken in the beginning of November.
1.0,I’m not a fan of this stretchy shiny material. It look cheap. I returned it.
1.0,"This was cute, but the size was way off.  I donated it to my much younger niece."
1.0,Sure these are warm cheap socks. These do the job of keeping your feet warm. If I could give 0 stars I would. I never wore one pair because it had a hole in it. The other pairs shrunk up to nothing. I always dry with low heat. I'm not going to air dry socks.
1.0,Not quality material
1.0,"I'm right under five foot and the straps are so incredibly long, there is no way to tighten them either. I typically wear a XS, but ended up sizing up to a small. I'm glad I did because this top is very fitted and a true crop top.<br /><br />The material is thin, which is perfect for summer. I just wish there was a way to adjust the strap. The material feels cheap too. The top is cute, but the quality isn't there."
1.0,I didn't even want to give these 1 star. Immediately after putting them on before I even put the posts on I started to have an allergic reaction so these are not 14 kt gold. Do not buy if you are sensitive to metal. I wanted to post a pic to show the reaction but for some reason it will not let me.
1.0,"I ordered 8mm hoops, but the ones that came are huge, about 14mm. Way too big for what I wanted."
1.0,"My breast are only bcup and they were falling out of this bra, cheaply made"
1.0,Wow these are bad. I had to chunk them in the trash. They were so small that I could see over and under them while looking through them which was giving me a head ache.
1.0,Does not even deserve one star. Fits awkward and is the cheapest form of polyester I've ever seen.... Do not buy!!!!!
1.0,"Super cheap, not worth the money!"
1.0,"Too big , it wasn’t for my size"
1.0,Jackey great pants. Horrible
1.0,I got it yesterday for Christmas and I don’t no if I got a lemon but my zipper already is broken...
1.0,Perhaps this fits some watches but it does not fit Ambit 3 Peak. I tried to attach for an hour with no luck.
1.0,Material is weak and rips easily. Product should come in different sizes as well.
1.0,These earrings look a lot larger than they are. The hearts are about the size of a green pea disappointed.
1.0,Flimsy sunglasses the frame is light and the flip up lenses are too heavy I retuned them
1.0,The seams tore the first time I put on the gloves.
1.0,The item was shipped in a bubble envelop where the glasses where put into a guess leathery pouch and it arrived with the envelope intact but the glasses themselves were not any good. Nothing broken but twisted and tilted. There not usable anymore.
1.0,I LOVED this charm. Had it for 2 weeks and noticed it fell off the chain. Obviously shoddy metalwork for it to break off.<br />Very disappointed.
1.0,"I did not receive the Rice and Red ink along with it. It seems in the description that it comes along with it and which is why I ordered this one. However, when I received the order, I only got Rakhi"
1.0,"No, it definitely failed my expectations... :(((("
1.0,"Cheap, looks like a five year old glued it together.  Would give it a -10 rating!!  Ugly, not worth returning. Lesson learned."
1.0,The top was not at all as shown.  It was not off the shoulder and very very small.  It was short in length and even the color was different.
1.0,Color ran. Made other clothes spotted with navy. 😢😓😢
1.0,I returned this one. The material was too see thru for me.
1.0,Not ordered size. Charged 1.00 for return.
1.0,"I really, really wanted to like these. In fact, I loved them when they came and I laced them in my daughter's converse. Then when she put them on, they were too loose. I lace them a different way, then they were too tight. We finally found a goldilocks lacing configuration that made it easy enough for her to slip on her shoes without them being too loose or too tight. We've had these laces longer than the return period, but she's only been wearing them for about 2 weeks, and yesterday the red tip to the laces broke off rendering them useless! I'm so disappointed. At least it happened at home and not at school so I could have a plan B ready for her. I guess we'll just go back to her normal converse laces."
1.0,Miss leading pictures
1.0,"Really disappointed ☹️. The description clearly says men’s flannel shirt, this is not flannel, not even close. It is a thin, cheap, plastic like material. This was my sons birthday gift, all he wanted was flannel shirts.. what a disappointment.. colors are off too. It’s supposed to be black, red, and white.. gets here and it’s purple, yellow, brown, gold, red.. makes me think all of the reviews are fake. Will be returning with the expectation of a full refund so my son can get an actual flannel shirt.. not a cheap plastic shirt claiming to be flannel."
1.0,Is tooo small<br />Like a dime<br />Dont like for the price
1.0,This is just a thin tank. It provides almost zero compression.
1.0,The dress that my daughter received was cheaply made.  The fabric was so thin to the point you could see through it. She also stated that the over and under lays were cut differently so the dress did not sit correctly.  If you purchase the dress purchase a size bigger than you need so that it will hopefully lay correctly.
1.0,Very short I have this dress away 😔
1.0,It is nothing like the picture it is very small but instead of the opal looking blue stone it is glitter paint. I could buy this from a dollar store and I would still have to rethink about spending a dollar on it.
1.0,People this thing is a show piece at best. Don’t try to wear it cause it might break. The first time I tried to put it over my head it broke
1.0,Shrunk after first wash. Very disappointed.
1.0,This dress fit well was even a little big. I purchased the small. I wore it 1 time by the end of the day the dress tore by the armpits and side.. horrible stitching or horrible quality. I wish I could get my money back or another dress.  The dress was pretty but doesn't hold up at all
1.0,I ordered 4 sets of two. 6 of the shoehorns have broken.
1.0,Ripped at the arm stitching after 2 uses.
1.0,TOTAL SCAM!!!
1.0,They look black in the picture and they were blue. Very disappointed!
1.0,[[VIDEOID:bbc731b268ca096af1aabcf0639d34d8]] The material is so bad quality don’t recommend ☹️
1.0,Irritated my skin and pulled on it
1.0,had to return item
1.0,"I do not recommend this jacket.  While I was not expecting this to be an amazing article, it simply is completely underwhelming and looks very cheaply made.  The material looks more like plastic than leather and the fit and overall assembly just reflect cheap quality and poor craftsmanship.  I will be finding a better jacket to replace this one."
1.0,"I'm sorry I can't give this a better review. This item not only has a funny strong plastic smell, it collects so much lint that it is actually unwearable. I mean it picks up everything. It ruined my whole evening"
1.0,Low quality with very bad cover(nylon tiny bad)..there was a defect in the cover luckily it did'nt get lost
1.0,Very cheap. I think it may be a knock off . Fake leather chipped after three days of use.
1.0,The stem that goes in your ear and backing ate cheap and flimsy.  The backing was digging into the back of ear and it was too painful to wear.... I don't recommend
1.0,This Greek flag is backwards!<br />Don’t buy
1.0,"Like others have stated, way too small and the liners shift within. I'm a size 10, 140lb and US sized med-lg. Ordered an XL which might fit a 32A cup woman but certainly not a 34C-D or anywhere near that range. Was able to purchase a similar bra at Bealls for $5.60 (with email discount), quite a bit less pricey and better quality."
1.0,"Way to large! I am 5’1 and weigh 115, this looks like a tent on me and makes me appear 30 pounds heavier. It is very unflattering and even if I try to tie the belt shorter it wont help with the frumpy appearance. The material is great and it does look good on the other pictures however if you are short and have a similar weight to mine they need to make an XXS."
1.0,Plastic clip broke did not last long cheap easy to brake
1.0,Broke when trying to opening them. You get what you pay for.
1.0,The ear strap was not sewn on to the mask. Never even tried it on.
1.0,The zipper is the problem with this dress. I ordered 2 different sizes.
1.0,"I ordered 5 rings that was pictured - adjustable by squeezing it at the neck and tail of the peacock.  I received 3 of those and to like the one pictured.  Peacock tail and neck are fused together and the ring is split it on the bottom.<br />It’s awful to wear, the split digs into your finger and it doesn’t let the yarn flow s,oothly.  Totally disappointed in the company for falsely advertising hat you purchase with hat they send."
1.0,Doesn't even fit my head at all. Fit's my 8-year-old sons head.
1.0,It was not the size quoted and stones were off already returned it
1.0,The color is not what is advertised and then material is cheap
1.0,This is garbage. Not even remotely close to fitting snugly. I put it on and there are huge gaps around side of the face. Felt like a giant had worn it for two years before it got sent to me. Immediately the trash. Do not buy this.
1.0,"These legging have a horrible smell.  They smell as if they've been soaked in coal oil.  I've soaked them in the washer with Tide and Liquid Sunshine and they still smell.<br />I assume because they are a one size fits all, they don't just come up to my waist...they come to the edge of my bra.<br />Needless to say, I'm not happy with them.  Had I not opened the one package, I would have returned all that I ordered."
1.0,"This is for ONLY ONE EARRING! Why on earth would it not be sold in a set.?!?! There is space in the packaging for two, and you can see where they removed one of the earrings to sell separately. Why not just sell both of them and mark it up? It's not like 12 dollars will break the bank."
1.0,I was so upset getting this dress. It was made horrible. The material was cheap and itchy. Just a hot mess. I ended up throwing the dress away. Dont waste your money!
1.0,Zipper came right off the first time my daughter wore it.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,"I am so upset about the quality of these pants.  I first purchased two pairs of these pants in November of 2016, and they were favorite!  I am still wearing the original pants!  I decided to purchase another 2 pairs in November of 2017.  When I got them, the zippers would not stay closed, so I sent them back thinking that they we just a bad batch.  I waited until January 2019 to try again and see if they were the same quality as the first ones that I purchased.  The zippers seemed to be okay, so I washed them and wore them until February 2019 (one month) and the zippers in both the pocket and fly failed to stay closed when zipped shut.  I am not, by the way, overweight (the pants fit very loosely which is what I like).  I paid over 40 dollars each, so this is really upsetting.  I will not buy them again, ever."
1.0,"This said it was a 3 pack, but only came with one shirt"
1.0,Not happy at all came to small and I like my jackets big that's why I ordered  it that size
1.0,Came more like kid size.. ended up having to give mine and my moms to my 10 and 6 year old. Ugh
1.0,This product looks nothing like the picture. Looks very cheap and it's no where true to size. Instead of being a XXXL it looks like a Large.
1.0,"These were 3 sizes to SMALL! My daughter could wear them, definitely NOT WOMAN'S size."
1.0,The shoes were ok quality but the size charts are incorrect. The shoes I ordered are for a infant and I got toddler sized shoes. Can’t wear them and a waste of money.
1.0,Too small and very thin material.
1.0,Very thin material. Can see through it. Bought for 10yr old daughter wish was better quality
1.0,These are darling but very poor quality. My daughter wore them once for a wedding and the bow fell apart. She was so upset.
1.0,This dress is nothing like the pictures
1.0,Nylon not sweater material and it's misprinted on the bottom. Would not recommend
1.0,"After reading the other reviews, I can only assume I was sent the wrong size. This is so small, it barely fit over my head. There is no way this would fit even a normal sized adult."
1.0,"Worst scarf ever. It looks like it fits a doll. The package arrived and folded, fit in the palm of my hand. I couldn't even put it fully around my daughter's teddy bear. Unbelievable waste!"
1.0,"Omg !! I just can’t believe how terrible the bow tie was and how terribly wrinkled the jacket was !! Not to mention the tie was frayed /ripped and broken !! And the placed the SKU number right in front !!!!!! Wtf. Is all I have to say,"
1.0,These are junk should have known for the price and when they came they were completely smashed and can’t get them back into shape only needed them for prob a couple times when it snows but these are junk
1.0,Very poor quality..characters looked faded and shirt looked thin and stretched..tried many times to contact seller told me would refund my account never did and stopped replying to me.
1.0,Did not think the will Break so quick and no warranty cheap product you get what you paid for. Poor product would not recommend unless is a gift and not even to gift it to anyone
1.0,They fit way too small so unfortunately they're just sitting in my dresser drawer because I can't wear them ! That really is unfortunate since I specifically purchased clothes to wear with them all year long !
1.0,having to return it
1.0,It was not of great quality
1.0,Def size way way up.  But even if you get the right size the quality is horrible
1.0,"I avoided putting this in the dryer and it was still ruined after wearing it twice.  The fabric started to pill, especially in areas under the arms and on the sides of the dress."
1.0,Terrible. Lenses were warped.
1.0,When I purchased this 2 weeks ago there were no reviews and I knew I was taking a gamble but didn't get around to trying it till just yesterday when I popped in the batteries and a quick flash of dim green.. then nothing.. wont turn on again LED is totally shot. not easy to fix really either as it's just butted up and heat shrined to the end of the plastic cord for the stitching
1.0,After only 4 uses the tail skin ripped in several places and the monofin fell apart! They tried to refuse a refund even after they received the return! Thankfully amazon took care of it!
1.0,Haven't worn boots for a month and they're separating on the side I don't care how much they were they should last longer than a month I would not buy again or recommend very upset with this purchase
1.0,Worthless. I couldn't tell any difference in the glare. I returned them.
1.0,"Really, REALLY, weird fit, junk material and crooked stitching. Had to choice but to wear for a wedding, otherwise I would have returned immediately."
1.0,Not real leather.
1.0,Broke in a week.  Poor quality lanyard.
1.0,Nothing at all like the pic
1.0,The title is a lie they are not thermal fleece leggings they should be titled something different I bought them and was very angry almost return them the description says thermal fleece they are not thermal fleece leggings
1.0,Doesn’t work like the video.
1.0,Better off going to your local beauty supply store.
1.0,Way to big.....
1.0,Proportions are way off.
1.0,I ordered a Large as it states they run long. I can't even get an arm in and over my head after one wash. Theres $20 down the drain.
1.0,I purchased this item because it was listed as a sweatshirt and appeared to be one in the picture. The item is a very thin long sleeve t-shirt with high shipping to cover the low cost of the listed price. I was willing to pay the $20 total for a sweatshirt but not a thin t-shirt. It also took a month and a half to get here.
1.0,"Works perfect. Nice light, airy fabric. Loose fit and nice length.<br />** update after first wash.<br />TERRIBLE!  They are snagged all over the place. None of the snags were in there when they went into the wash. They were not in the wash with any hooks or zippers either. Just leggings underwear, socks, and shirts.<br /><br />They are ruined after the first wash."
1.0,does not fit right or is it soft to your arm!
1.0,Inside of sock is white so it shows through the outside instead of the solid color
1.0,"I couldn't wait to receive these compression foot sleeves, ordered the largest size available (L/XL), had a great deal of difficulty getting them on. Really are too tight, but that might be due to some minor water retention. I'm going to give it some time and hope it works out. I had received a free pair from a company who advertised on Facebook, and I LOVED how they felt, so I went to Amazon because of the trust I have in them. I don't think they're the same socks, but the design is exactly the same. UPDATE: I can't even use these socks as they're much tighter than they should be for their purpose. I'll most likely return four pairs of the five (can't return a used pair)."
1.0,Horrible purchase!! They’re cheap and flimsy!!! Stretches easily.
1.0,"This doesn’t appear as it does in the photos. The slits are on other side and are not very high as shown in the photo. One side of the collar is bent inward. Basically, this is a super cheap-looking riff on a cheongsam. If you’re gonna engage in cultural appropriation, at least make it higher quality! (Irony: I’m pretty sure it’s made in Asia)"
1.0,I was disappointed when i receive the pants was to small and no stretch
1.0,Wanted To return due to the size of the bag. Thought bag was going to be much bigger. Seller would not give full refund so I had no choice but to keep it. Attempted to put stuffed animals inside bag and as pulling closed to zipper fabric wrapped. What a piece of junk. Never again will I buy from here.
1.0,"This shirt is advertised as 100% cotton. Instead I received something more like spandex/lycra and very stretchy, not 100% cotton.<br />And the sizing was way too small. XL fit more like a Medium (even stretched out!)<br /><br />UPDATE: I contacted seller for return/refund. Seller was very responsive and made sure my request was met satisfactorily."
1.0,The right glove broke after the second time my boyfriend used them.
1.0,"The material was very very thin. When it was delivered, I didn't realize it was a shirt. Also I bought two size bigger than actual my kid's size, because the many reviews pointed out. My kid wore only once. She said that she loved to have Daryl's shirt but it was not comfortable to wear it: the shape was somewhat  strange. I hope the maker improves the product."
1.0,arrived crushed beyond wearability
1.0,"Terrible, all the color came off the pieces just sitting. Terrible quality"
1.0,"I bought this for my daughter and the skirt was very long, even with a 5 ring scoop skirt underneath. She could not even get the jacket past her elbow because the arm holes in the jacket were so small. Even if she did get it up her arms, the jacket would never have closed in the front. The jacket looked like it was made for a child and the skirt was made for a tall woman. We did order a size up based on other reviews. She did get to wear it and we are returning it."
1.0,worst product ever
1.0,"Okay, so, I love cargo pants. 10/10 favorite sort of pants. These... Well, for starters they didn't fit right and were tight compared to their sizing. Also, after putting them on, I pulled up the zipper and... It split. I had tons of room there, so don't assume it was due to my size or me trying to wriggle into too small of pants. I am tiny. But, anyway, the zipper split on my first attempt to pull it up, and the material of the pants was pretty thing too (despite looking nice and heavy in the picture!). So I returned them, sadly."
1.0,"Nice looking, but too small."
1.0,This is NOT a long necklace like the picture. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,"Did not wear, was very unhappy 😕!!!"
1.0,The fabric was very thin and see-through. I am not sure it would even hold up to being washed once. The sleeves are a very scratchy fabric and sit awkwardly. It just look very cheap and was not of good quality. This might work for a Halloween costume but I don't think it is suited for everyday wear.
1.0,I bought a L because it’s my size and when it comes was too small. Then I return and bought a XL. And looks the same size of L. Nothing change. Continue too small.... I don’t recommend.
1.0,Didn’t get the shoes in package. Only socks. And they were dirty as well. Returned.
1.0,Returned it. It choked me!
1.0,"I'd give it 0 stars if I could. Horrible, don't waste your money. Does not look anything like the picture"
1.0,Sizes don't match product
1.0,started tarnishing
1.0,They were not DG as advertised in the picture. Not one of them was DG. No name brand.  I won't order these again
1.0,"This dress was cheap material and too small. I returned it, received a refund, then the company charged me AGAIN months later because they haven’t received the item back. I contacted them proving the item was in transit and that they were not authorized to re-charge my card. They did it anyway. Shop elsewhere."
1.0,"Well it was completely see through, rendering it totally inappropriate for my bridal shower so I had to send it back."
1.0,Had to return it because it did not work when I got it out of the box
1.0,"Ring got here already fading, dark and the stones loose , got it on time but disappointed because of the poor quality. It looks like the rings on the vending machines, save yourself a headache."
1.0,Disappointed. With the frame on the bottom it is very difficult to put mascara and eyeliner on lower lashes.  Product would be much better is lens rotated from a top frame or lens flipped up.
1.0,Ordered my recommended size yet it falls off my shoulders. This isn't cut properly. I won't recommend.
1.0,The stockings roll down which defeats my reason for buying them. They are more like knee highs not thigh highs. Definitely a waste of money.
1.0,I’m not sure if their target market is the Care Bears or what but this shirt arrived and was crazy small - fit for a toddler.
1.0,"This is a disposable top, don't buy it.  It wasn't worth my time to return it.  You get what you pay for.  Don't do it.  I didn't listen to reviews, I thought mine would look somewhat like the picture.  You remember those micro fiber dish towels we used to<br />use?  I'm pretty sure it's the same material."
1.0,Was happy when it arrived but after trying it on I notice the belt was missing.
1.0,Cute Design. But after one wear and wash dress is coming apart. Seem at bottom is coming undone.
1.0,"Awful, and way too small."
1.0,Poorly made did not last a week wouldn’t recommend
1.0,Theyre just not good clamps. Kept falling off.
1.0,"The shape makes them impossible to actually wear unless your ear is paper thin. So disappointed. Not curved like picture, it is an L shape behind the butterfly that has no space for earlobe. Tried in cartilage too, nope. Waste of money."
1.0,"Much lower quality than the picture represented. Looks like a child’s drawing of the patch, as opposed to the more detailed minuteman in the picture."
1.0,The criss cross is a waste. It does not tighten the tummy at all. I bought specifically to tighten the tummy but doesn’t.
1.0,Awful cheap looking converter. Overpriced for quality
1.0,"The sizing is way off unless suddenly women's xs is smaller than a child small, also developed a hole in the seam at the top of the arm after about ten minutes of wear and the graphic is rubbery and shiny which makes me think it'll peel off within the next week or so."
1.0,Turned my finger green. No way this is sterling silver
1.0,I didn't care for the quality of the jumper compared to the price.
1.0,"Just received and disappointed. It is so dark. It is no where near to the image displayed. I'm confused . Will need some time to think weather to keep it or return. Because I already have good collection of glasses and thought this will be one different , but it's a repeat of glasses that I already have. I wish I got those lovely light purple as in the image. Disappointed totally.."
1.0,Started falling apart after one wash.
1.0,These stems do not lock on to the frame.  The locking mechanism is different then the originals.  The last pair I had fell off too and were lost.  I thought it was my fault maybe not locking them all the way because Oakley doesn't make junk.  I know cuz I was head of RnD there.  Now I am certain it is a defective product.  I would even venture to say they are knock offs!  Nicelyfit has not responded to my email to them asking for a replacement.  So now the poor review of their company and performance and customer service which is a big fat ZERO.
1.0,"Poor sizing information. Also one lace is a good 3/4"" shorter than the other."
1.0,The hem came out after 1 wash- I will not be purchasing this item again
1.0,Most of the clothes are sooooo small.
1.0,"is not 925 silver plated, is ugly and it seems very fake, couldn't even wear it"
1.0,It is orange not gold!! My son was also expecting 2 chains not one so he was a bit more disappointed. He spent money he earned on something that he won't use.
1.0,Do not buy. Only the back of the vest heats and after about two weeks of use the battery will not charge. I would have sent it back but missed the return window. Complete waste of money and very disappointed.
1.0,The zipper broke on my first use. Plus the front wear it zipped made bulges under my shirt that looked crazy. Not a good sports bra! The only thing I liked was the adjustable straps
1.0,Extremely unhappy the charm came and the paint was bubbly SO NOT WORTH IT. I get it the price is cheap but I could of purchase a better item in the streets for this price. Not good quality.
1.0,It is not an afro.  It is a perm.
1.0,"I bought this dress in another pattern, so getting this 2nd one was a huge disappointment. Completely different cut, very skimpy and too small."
1.0,This product is very cheaply made/china. It was thin and tight. It had a flimsy zipper. Overall not happy sent back.
1.0,Customer service bad... quality bad!!!
1.0,This was no where near the size I ordered.... The tag states what I ordered but it was at least 3 sizes too small around....
1.0,Jeans were too small. This may have been due to me not noticing that these were Juniors sizing. Also the jeans did look the same as the ones pictured in my opinion.
1.0,It was completely see through
1.0,not a fan
1.0,"The chain broke while putting the necklace on upon arrival and the metal is flimsy and, does not appear to be 92.5 silver so I do not trust the leather one to stay attached either. It will possibly work with another chain or just to carry or use without one.  The price is commensurate with the quality, however, and the product arrived promptly and well packaged."
1.0,These are so huge and heavy that we were not able to wear them.... very pretty sitting in the jewelry box.
1.0,"I bought the long one, and it barely went to the hip area. I returned it. Not made for American sizes, was sized for shorter people."
1.0,I was extremely disappointed. What I got in the mail looks nothing like the pictures and the fabric is the exact opposite of soft.
1.0,The jeggins came with ripped decorations that were not visible on the jeans I had chosen.  I did not choose other versions of these jeggins for this reason and was very disappointed when I found this out.
1.0,SOCKS RUN VERY SMALL.
1.0,"Mrs Chase here...... This item is not hypoallergenic, as described. I have a nickel allergy and it has almost burned my skin after a couple days wear. I do NOT recommend it if you have an allergy, or super sensitive skin."
1.0,"I wanted to love these. They seemed comfy and fit well. However, the waist has no support and these are constantly slipping down. I'm having to keep pulling them up. It's a neverending battle. I'm curvy. So there shouldn't be a reason for these to slide down every few steps. So annoying. I even tried a size down. Still slipped down. I won't even be wearing these around the house. Too bad. They are soft and comfy. But, I cannot deal with the waist slipping down all day. Would not recommend."
1.0,The product was terrible I’m returning it!!
1.0,Pin that holds band to watch broke with two weeks.
1.0,I order three sizes too big just in case and the size that came in was still too small. Very disappointed
1.0,the pendant itself was very nice...but within 2 days the chain it was on broke.
1.0,Se tarda mucho en llegar
1.0,"This hoody unfortunately does not look like what was described. Its super shiny fabric, not like a normal sweatshirt material and the nasa graphic feels like a stiff plastic iron on that is very wrinkled due to the vacuum packaging. There is a note that it will no longer be ""ugly"" once washed but I am afraid to risk washing it and not being able to return. I hate writing negative reviews and it seems like a lot of people have enjoyed this hoody so I will say that the inside does seem super soft. Oh and size up cause it seems to run small."
1.0,"Sorry, but it looked like a rag!  It was returned!"
1.0,"The socks were black on the picture, but arrived in different colors..."
1.0,They wrapped out after wearing them 3 times
1.0,Charm is broken pore quality or bad shipping.
1.0,"This is not a flannel robe. It is cotton and would be pleasant in warmer weather. If you check the Pajamagrams website they do not have this in flannel, their description is simply cotton. Very disappointed and will be returning it."
1.0,This skirt is not for short people. It comes up directly under my breasts. I hope I can altar a brand new skirt.
1.0,Material although soft is thick and somewhat stiff for this style blouse.
1.0,"This item is huge! Did not fit a two year old or four year old. Also, it rolled up funny."
1.0,"These fit fine from the waist up. However, they are way too long. I'm 5' 7&#34; and they go all the way to mid thigh. Almost a dress, not what I needed."
1.0,Extremely short. Even fully opened would barely fit over my head.  Then the uke is at nose level.
1.0,Super thin and cheap do not buy these !
1.0,Green is not an olive green looks more like a faded olive green color!!
1.0,"First off, this is no where near anything close to Pink.  The color aside I was willing to get past that because it does feel good when you put it on, the cloth is very soft on the skin.  Except for one very large flaw....the arms of the top have a seam going all the way around at the elbow on each side.  It is like the company made them short sleeve and then decided that they needed long sleeves so they just sewed in more fabric.  For the price I would not recommend this outfit.  You could get this at Ross and pay a tenth of the cost."
1.0,waste of money and not worth the bother of returning it<br /><br />i had to give it to a girl who is aobut 5'5 and weight under 120.<br /><br />they needed them.<br />might as well share it this holiday season if it sucks pass it on.<br /><br />better then dealing with returns.
1.0,Material TOO thin. We were traveling and I missed the window for return but can't use the item.
1.0,"I was stepping out of my comfort zone in this however I did not like the material, like a spandex. The skirt could have been worn as a dress but there was no way of knowing the top from the bottom good for some I suppose,  the top didn't even cover my boobs. Which I'm a 32D"
1.0,This product is not true to size
1.0,"I was really looking forward to this shirt. I own it in 2 other colors. When the solid black arrived the product was the same brand and read the same size on label. But I couldn't even get this one on. I held it up to the other shirts. There was a 2-3 inch difference with fabric width between the other shirts. Be careful, you never know what size you'll get even if the labels reads the size you ordered."
1.0,Lasted only 3 wks
1.0,I wear a size 18 w pant and based on reviews I ordered the 5 XL and it is still too small!!!
1.0,I wanted this dress so badly but the fit is awful.  I believe the size chart needs to be reevaluated.
1.0,"I was really excited for this cute ring but when it came, the little suns rays were incredibly sharp & it came so bent out of shape, I couldn't even try to bend it back."
1.0,This was actually broken when my niece opened it as her gift. I need to do am exchange:(
1.0,I thought they were silver.<br />Hated them.
1.0,This shirt description says T-shirt but it is not and it looks nothing like the picture. The washed look around the sleeve and neck is not there. This is not the shirt advertised.
1.0,Would not fit. Never used
1.0,I wanted a self winding watch. I liked the style of this watch.
1.0,"The gold looks cheap, so I've never worn this. I also bought the silver one, which I wear quite often, but I would not recommend the gold."
1.0,Cheap!  Do not buy!
1.0,Do not waste your money.  You get what you pay for...just threw this piece of trash  away.
1.0,I have a friend that is a size 6 and it was tight on her also. I am a 10/12 and couldn't get it on at all.
1.0,"this product was for my nice, for obvious reasons such as covid 19.  the size is extremely small, like I said above could not be used by a 3 to 12 yr old child"
1.0,It was extremely thin. Picture is deceiving.
1.0,"The photos make this look much nicer than it is. The main problem is the top. I ignored a review because the photos don't show it, but there is elastic at the shoulder seam. It makes it look SUPER cheap. Hard pass."
1.0,Looked cute and well made until I noticed the nose is secured with a screw that pokes into my son’s forehead. If he was running and fell or ran into something i think it could do some damage. Maybe ok for sitting still but what kid does that?
1.0,Disappointed that this didn’t work at all. The first pic is before cleaning and second pic is after soaking overnight. I even tried to use the erasers from this same brand and they did nothing. Ended up sticking them in my washer with baking soda and vinegar.
1.0,I can’t even get the ball off -_-
1.0,"These are terrible bike gloves. First, all the logos are just decals that came off in the first month of use. Second, the seams were ripped apart at the start of the second bike season. Not recommended."
1.0,"this is like a dress sock at the top, and barely cushioned around the foot. These are SO SMALL and were supposed to be size 12-15 Big and Tall! They fit my size 11s but had to stretch to do so. these socks make my ankles cold. They used to make my favorite sock, it was called the same thing. Now this is a bastardization of a product I used to enjoy. For shame. cheaper, smaller, and such a scam."
1.0,I would not even give this one single star because this is such a waste of money.  This tape is even a quality lower than any cheap sticker that comes off and does not stick for even a second. I regret buying this and wasting my money on this.
1.0,The band was extremely hard and did not bend easily around my wrist when I got it. Almost like it has been sitting around a long time and lost it's flexibility. Nothing at all like a new band should be.
1.0,This is not the wig i received in the mail from party america! this is false advertising!
1.0,Wasn't as pictured. Wooden disc is smaller than the tree
1.0,Returned this item. It was nothing what it looked like and didn't fit as it showed
1.0,Horrible not cotton material at all
1.0,"El modelo es muy bonito pero el material es de mala calidad y es muy liviano, se descolorizo en dos días de uso. No lo recomiendo para ese precio tan elevado"
1.0,"Zipper is of poor quality.  Not enough large pockets, 4 out of 6 pockets are basically useless. No large lower pockets to warm your hands. Overall low quality materials.<br />Don't waste your money or time."
1.0,"Cutest. little suspenders ever, unfortunately, the fastener came off on the 2nd wearing. Very disappointed. I loved them."
1.0,"Too short, ankle sock."
1.0,"I received this item for Christmas.<br /><br />It looks very nice with a legible font. My time was accurate down to 0.5secs.<br /><br />However, the chronograph is damaged and broke within minutes. The top button is supposed run the stopwatch, the bottom is supposed to reset it. I read their instruction manual beforehand (they didn't actually write this pattern into the manual, but it was similar to the pattern 2.)<br />But it worked for only a short while. After a bit, each hand would stop, then only the bottom would start the timer for some reason. All of started breaking inside just by using the timer. The top button has already lost its click and is now difficult to move. The time doesn't reset. It only works with random hands for random amounts of time.<br /><br />All I did was set the time. Then I set the stopwatch for five minutes. Everything fell apart within half an hour on Christmas Eve. Nice.<br /><br />Nibosi can reach out and offer a replacement. They sold me on chronographs, it was beautiful experience until it broke on its own."
1.0,Cheap. There was a run in the white pair before they we're even put on all the way.
1.0,Necklace was shipped in a small bag that was in a small box. The chain was so entangled around the snow flake it was no way to save it. It had to be snipped off in 4 pieces. Snowflake wasnt as nice as expected either.
1.0,No. Never again. Ended up in my trash immediately.
1.0,I ordered another kaftan and loved it.  This is cheap poly and something I won’t use often because of it-
1.0,"They sent a completely different patterned dress. Rainbow colored in a print I'd never wear! ( I specifically loved the one pictured)  I would've returned it, but I got it for a trip the next day so I flew out.  By the time I returned it was past the return policy date. I ended up eventually gifting it to a friend who I thought would like the loud print and colors. Thankfully she loved it! I'm happy but I really wanted the dress I ordered and I'm too afraid to try again!"
1.0,Seams on the sides broke immediately as if they wear glue together with elmers glue. Made very cheaply and would not recommend these to anyone!
1.0,make that no stars did not keep correct time. I returned the item.
1.0,Product was not as pictured.  The red stripe is much more vibrant  giving the sweater more of a 70’s feel.
1.0,"I have a Russell zip up I purchased a few years ago and had hoped to get an exact replacement.  I bought the first one because it  was a very very light grey color and because it fit well as size large.  This one is much less material weight and the OXFORD IS NOT A VERY LIGHT GREY like the one I own.  It is typical med/dark drab grey, which for me was very disappointing.  My existing one is large and fits me well, I ordered medium and it is about the same size as my large.  I am 5'8"" and 160 lbs.  So overall, I could have gotten the same product  and quality at any big box store.  Very disappointed."
1.0,"For being a 20 dollar dress, I would have assumed the material wouldn't have been as cheap as it was. it was soo cheap and smelled like cheap cheap plastic"
1.0,Ordered two and both broke after two weeks.  Quality is poor.
1.0,The item was a bright red color and not burgundy.  It was also poorly cut and looked nothing like the picture.  Extremely disappointed because I was looking forward to wearing it.
1.0,It's something u wouldn't wear for summer but kind of ugly for winter . Didn't like it at all
1.0,The socks were too small for the size they said it would fit
1.0,After I use this pair of socks I felt disconfort followed by pain in the hill region of my foot.
1.0,This is a terrible shoe of kids. First off there is a bad chemical smell and to make things worse the top of my son’s foot got blisters from wearing it.
1.0,I mean the title really says it all.
1.0,Pay no attention to their size guide.
1.0,"That's what you get when ordering unlicensed merchandise.<br /><br />This &#34;Andy Murray&#34; t-shirt features a photo of Novak Djokovic. I am currently in the process of trying to return it, and will update as to progress."
1.0,"After owning these less than a month, the lenses started getting discolored. Looks like the film inside is unsticking from the lens. It highly affects affects visibility. Seem like poor quality. Very disappointing."
1.0,"S/M fits my 70lb dog... barely. And would cost me $100+ for shipping... so I guess either my dog is wearing it, or I'm just gonna throw it away. It would only fit a child."
1.0,The material is awful!! Felt like I was wearing an oversized shopping bag. It’s not flattering at all! So disappointed!!! Hoping to return it
1.0,Awful style and pattern. Not like the picture.
1.0,Terrible over priced
1.0,Returned.  Sides were latex!  I hope they go back to original great quality they’ve had for years.
1.0,Can't give a lower star rating. Does not  fit the average American face.  Maybe kids or smaller faced women. If your a guy get something else. Didn't cover the chin and rolled up onto the mouth everytime...ugh!
1.0,Great looking coat but I ordered a 5x and got a 3x .. that sucks!
1.0,Paste would be an overstatement...I've seen better quality at street fairs
1.0,"Love design idea.  Have had four shipments of this product.  Each one only came with one set of stones, missing 11 sets.  Returning, disappointed."
1.0,"It is super cute, but broke the first time I wore it."
1.0,Fits good just way too short
1.0,"These shoes fell apart on my daughter's second use. The strip with the beads delaminated and the black surface frayed like paper. Cheap, but you will not get your money's worth."
1.0,"Bought these for my daughter, daughter in law to be and myself Fir her bridal shower and they all Tarnished after wearing once . Disappointed…"
1.0,It arrived broken... bad quality
1.0,At first I thought this would be a nice bday dress. The dress came package in a soft envelope followed by a plastic zippy bag. It doesn't look as nice as it is shown here. It feels hard and cheap in front as if it'll rip any second. I'm so aggravated but you buy cheap you get cheap.
1.0,"Pulled these out and almost laughed. I usually wear an Xl.... sooo I ordered a XXL to make sure that they were long enough. I COULD NOT pull them past my thighs. I'm 6'0"". I never dreamed that I would never know if they were long enough. I would have had to order a 4X for them to fit... folded up and they were back to the UPS store that afternoon."
1.0,Quality was cheap. The sleeves were way too short. The material was thin. Sending back.
1.0,"These shirts are almost 2 sizes too small. ordered xxl, (im a xl) fits like a LARGE. wtfff"
1.0,"The worst material ever! Just don’t waste your money! The color is not as vibrant, the bottoms are like those older woman’s pants, just all wrong"
1.0,"I bought this dress for my daughter, but it's so awful she didn't even try it on.  Seriously, it's horrid!  It looks pretty in the picture, but look at the close up of the fabric in one of the lighter colors (we got the blue).  You see how it looks like a net in between the print?  Those holes in the net are bigger than they look in the photo.  And the fabric does NOT have a sheen to it like it looks in the picture.  It's dead flat.  Not a pretty fabric at all.  Someone commented this looks like a tablecloth.  I agree except I'd add that it looks like a cheap, dollar store tablecloth - an ugly one!  If you are looking for quality, this isn't it.  Keep looking!"
1.0,After two weeks one shoe stopped working
1.0,This dress is like a bag with a belt. There is no shape. Material was not what I expected. You will need to iron. The color was also not has vibrant as this photo. I returned it.
1.0,Ugly!!!!
1.0,"I buy this type of sandal for my kids every summer. The first time my son wore these, he complained that they hurt on one foot. When I checked it out, I could see that the velcro was sewn in the wrong place at the back of the shoe so there was no padding covering the top of it. The strip of velcro is very sharp and after only a few minutes of wearing, he already had cuts in his heel. Do not recommend purchasing these shoes, quality is bad and there are a ton of brands to choose from at a similar price point."
1.0,It is to small sent the item back wallet will not fit picture looks bigger but when get it very small returning the item
1.0,"Not comfortable at all. I have never been a size 2XL in my life, I’m usually a large and I sized up to 2XL so it would be loose and comfy. Not comfy at all material is stiff , the thighs are tight and the waist either needs to be rolled.. overall disappointed."
1.0,"Very disappointed! I got this specially for the hoops, I put them once I got them, but once I took it off they broke and couldn’t use it anymore, both small piece and the big one."
1.0,I went a size up which was cool however the dress is very short and doesn't look like the photo... I also ordered a RED dress but received an ORANGE dress...
1.0,Don't buy this item.
1.0,"Poor quality. Jacket is not lined and because it is open, the rough stitching on the inside is exposed when being worn. Fabric is see through enough that the shoulder pads show. Returned."
1.0,"Worn once and a hole started at bottom of pocket, washed and now bigger unwearable hole, not satisfied"
1.0,Was NOT cotton as it was marketed. Cheap stretchy garbage. Awful.
1.0,"It is poorly made, it shrinks on washing and I'm going to return"
1.0,Horrible plastic
1.0,The connections on each end are very cheaply made.  The rest of the watch band seems to be made well.  I’m worried to wear it at work and the gym just because of how cheaply made the connectors are.
1.0,Cheap weird fabric. Dont like feel of dress. Top of dress by breast is weird flap
1.0,"I really love this dress, but a large was not an accurate fit. It came as a small.... I’m able to fit in a medium or large, but this was short and didn’t feel comfortable!"
1.0,Not as pictured in the photo. Totally different poly material sewn on for sleeves. Sleeves are closer to 3/4 long than wrist length. Sleeves are poofy. Even a blind person could tell the shirt sent was different than the shirt shown in photo. Totally see thru. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE!!!!
1.0,Not even close to 2T/3T...more like 12 month! Only reason I am keeping these is because I also have a 12 mo old grandson that I can possibly use
1.0,I bought these leggings 2x now. The 4x was way to big and the 3x fit better but not great. Tight on the calf and still slowly wiggles off at the hips. They are very soft on the inside but not super warm. Walked my dog in them at 30° and I was still pretty cold. My biggest issue is that every time I hike them up I pop stitches. This is cheap quality. They used a straight non stretch stitch for a pair of stretchy leggings.  So every time I move I hear the stitches break. It will be no time at all before they are useless.
1.0,I ordered and received an XL; I could not even get it on - more like a small or medium.
1.0,"I work for the post office, so, I wanted a nice mask, great quality with the ability to wear fora reasonably period of time. This is the antithesis of what I expected. Poor quality (It looks like the material was re-print it from a picture) Pearly print it. You cannot wear it you can’t breathe through it every time you breathe the fabric goes into your nose you literally have to hold the mask away from your nose just to speak, and it’s hard for people to understand you when you’re talking worst mask I ever encountered by far. Like I said even the logo looks like a bat photo."
1.0,"Too small, very cheap material."
1.0,"2nd day of use, the velcro closer separated and now the case doesn't close securely. Got a replacement,  cost me more in gas and time than the product was worth but had to return it or be charged for 2. Replacement failed the same as the first.  DON'T BUY THIS!!!!"
1.0,"The material is not the best, and I asked for side large, but it is very small on top,this dress is supposed to flow, if you are thinking to buy this dress ask it for 2 size larger"
1.0,"This shoe is not worth your money. The ankle strap will not stay closed, which makes it difficult and unsafe to wear.<br />I would not recommend this."
1.0,This product is so cheaply made it's embarrassing to even wear went straight in the garbage
1.0,"Fabric is too itchy and looks weared out, not as stretchy as I was hoping for."
1.0,Was not a pack of four
1.0,"Junk. When I opened the clasp to put it on my bag, it broke apart. Was still able to put on my bag, but came off/broke somewhere…. lost.  Paid for NOTHING."
1.0,"I originally gave these 5 stars but after 1 month, the flower completely disconnected from the tunnel. These are not soldered on but cheaply glued so the entire front of the earring popped off and the glue peeled off..."
1.0,"Ugly, big mistake. I gave them to my nephew."
1.0,I received the product dented/damage. I had to return.😟
1.0,"Bad fit, gaiter tore first day ot of the package."
1.0,Extremely small and for some reason the ankle kinda flared out?? But I was sort so it didn't even touch my ankle. I'm 5'6
1.0,Cheap and small. If you're petite and have a small head and face then go for it!!
1.0,"several seams were coming apart right out of the box, it fit my girlfriend very weird and was not attractive. However I'll concede that it could potentially look better on different body types. She's very slender. Therefore the one star rating is solely based on the poor construction."
1.0,Came broke. Sent back for refund.
1.0,"Not a Batwing sleeve!! it is very tapered and not loosly cut, fabric looks like a ghost costume see through and scratchy. company has not accepted the return!! stay away"
1.0,Too loose with zero form. My kids told me I looked like I was wearing a table cloth.
1.0,I love having socks that complement my attire and these do. I was most unhappy when they frayed after the VERY FIRST wearing. I won't make a second purchase.
1.0,"You’re definitely getting what you pay for with this item. The material is very thin. Not only is the material of very poor quality, but one of the zippers came broken. It looks as if it was packaged broken because the zipper was thrown down inside the pocket. Definitely sending this product back."
1.0,"This is NOT Sterling silver. I wore for a couple of weeks and when it tarnished, I tried to clean it with normal sterling jewelry cleaner and the chain turned a weird color of pink. The claps were also not reliable and my chain frequently fell off. If I’d kept the package I’d have returned it.  I’ve already thrown 2 away and will wear the last one until it becomes trash in a week or so."
1.0,"The positive: I absolutely love the flattering cut of this vest and have purchased off white, dark red and black.  I will continue to order it because it is absolutely figure flattering and perfect to wear over a tank top and shorts. The length is perfect providing just the right amount of coverage in the right places. The negative: The quality is horrible. The fabric has no threads. As you can see, I took a photo with my phone behind the off white vest. There are maybe 80 threads per square inch when there should be at least 200-300 threads per square inch. This means a great profit for them but a horrible deal for the customer. The stitching is bunched up in places and there are defects in the fabric. One vest had a hole. This quality should sell for around 10 dollars not 23.<br /><br />( THIS IS WRITTEN ONE WEEK LATER) I take my previous statement back. I will never order from this vendor again. I ordered another dark red vest and the new one came with an even bigger hole! The white vest can't be used because even white and beige shirts show through it and it just looks cheap. These people are laughing all the way to the bank. Must be made in a sweat shop with extremely low wages. Luckily for them there are a lot of people out there that don't know what quality is."
1.0,These look like they would be the ones priced for $1.99 at the discount stores through out the city. waste of money and time ordering these. the stone is real red and the tassels are red orange. The plus the cheap look. you be the judge.
1.0,"The earrings have a deep, unnatural curve which cause them to bow up off the lobe. If you do get them to lay flat, it’s brief, they spin all around on the ear."
1.0,"Title says 6 pack, but only got 3 items (2 shirts and shorts).  White shirt is see through.  Also came 2 sizes too small (I ordered 1 size up to be safe)."
1.0,"I loved it, except it broke after the 3rd day I wore it."
1.0,I have owned this belt for two weeks and it is already excessively scratched and worn from normal use. I did not realize that the wax finish and delicate leather would so quickly deteriorate. I have tried treating it with leather conditioner and brown shoe polish but neither has significantly improved the belt's appearance. It is to the point that I will no longer wear it because it looks so severely scuffed. I am disappointed that I wasted $60 on this belt but I'm hoping I can return it to the store from which I bought it.
1.0,"As soon as for it, I saw how thin it was. It looks more like a sleep bra, not a swim suit. The bottoms were huge but tried the top. Realized it was going to be an issue, I got it wet anyway. See through. The top was a pretty shape but don’t get the light blue unless you want a see through look"
1.0,These never did latch!  Was never able to wear.  Big waste of money.
1.0,"it MIGHT work if you didn't pull the straps together but I need a racer back.  Returned, can't recommend the product."
1.0,"The shirt fits my son good as others have mentioned. However, the pants look like girls tights. Also, one of the knee patches is sewed on with yellow thread and the other is back. We'll just use the shirt so it wasn't a complete lost but still a disappointment."
1.0,"The 3rd time i wore a pair both socks developed holes. Not good. Ive ordered 2 more pair, ill see how they wear. Hope i can update with a rave review, doesn't look good though."
1.0,Does not fit. The size is wrong and they material is aggravating it constantly falls down.
1.0,"This shirt has so much potential.  Super cute design, and unbelievable price.  Well...you get what you pay for.  The fabric is a polyester that is not agreeable with my skin...too bad, because this shirt, as I said, is really cute.  I did heed the other reviews and ordered a size up, to ensure it would fit, but no need - I won't be wearing this.<br /><br />Make this shirt in another fabric, and I would wear it, no question!  Too bad for me."
1.0,bad clasp always popping off lost it within 2 weeks
1.0,"It was advertised as a warm jacket. Far from it. Size okay. Warm? Nope. Plus it was not delivered to my address. I had to figure out where the package was left at. In the middle of the night when I got the ""IT WAS DELIVERED"". I had to scout out the neighborhood to find my package. Which left me feeling like a thief. My address was given at the time of the order. It has not changed. The House Number is clearly visible. Yet. Whoever dropped my package off elsewhere. Very disappointed. This is a very thin Jacket. No warmth. Does not match the picture. And they don't deliver to your address. They just throw it out where ever the crow flies. Customer Service at Amazon after it says"" Delivered""...wait for 24 hours."
1.0,Doesn't stick to jack $***
1.0,"Material is see through. Waist band rolls, not attached properly. 100% polyester cheapness. Don't waist your money."
1.0,"Seriously, some of the worse material you will ever feel.  I didn't want this trash on my face.  Not recommended."
1.0,Cheaply constructed and it’s stiff so it pokes into my wrist. I would not purchase again.
1.0,Didn't fit my ear like they should. I just gave them away.
1.0,So small I couldn’t see the studs on the top! Wow! Such a disappointment! In the trash they went!
1.0,"I still don’t know how they work , waste of money"
1.0,Way tooo big!!
1.0,This is definitely not my idea of a skinny belt. It is over an inch wide. Very disappointed.
1.0,This bag is AWEFUL!!!!  It is not soft at all.  It is like a hard box.  The straps were folded and I can't get them straightened out.  This bag looks really cheap.  I wish I would have sent it back.  I just went online and since I bought it 2 weeks ago it is now $20 off.  Don't waste your time or you money on this one folks.
1.0,"Do NOT order the white! I’ve ordered it twice now to only receive the green! Yes, 2 times! You can see they must be tagged wrong."
1.0,Fell apart 4 months later.
1.0,The buckle on the adjustable strap broke less than a minute after I took it out of the box. Not surprising considering how thin the metal is.
1.0,Size wrong...stretch way too large
1.0,"Terrible quality, nothing like the picture at all. Cherry blossoms are faded as well as the water.<br />Threads sticking out.<br />Not happy.<br />Do yourself a favor and stay away from this seller, cheap products."
1.0,"These anklets are very colorful, that is why i chose them.  However, when my granddaughter tried to put them on, they broke immediately and beads went everywhere.  Not made very well.  Very disappointed.  They got a one for the color variation."
1.0,"I’m not happy with this purchase. The material is really cheap feeling and thin, it’s see-through. The color is not as shown on the description. The picture it shows that it’s flowy and the actual fact is very stiff and tight in the chest and short. I’m about 5’8” and ordered a medium."
1.0,"After a few weeks, color fades and loses elasticity."
1.0,"This dress, although quite pretty, runs at least two sizes small."
1.0,Also was already falling apart
1.0,Too small. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Even if you're lucky enough to actually fit in this jacket, don't buy it. It doesn't look nearly as good in real life. It looks like a $35 pleather jacket. Not sure what I expected.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I'm a skinny 6'1&#34; guy and ordered the US medium size. The chest diameter is perfect, but the sleeves come down to about halfway between my elbows and wrists."
1.0,"Broke instantly, so bad"
1.0,Looks nothing like the pictures. It’s a satin material and the fit is weird. The legs are very wide at the bottom and the waist/hips area runs very small.
1.0,I am very disapointed about this hat only use couple of times and less then three months and its already open from the top so now I will like to return my  product so please let me know
1.0,When I received these glasses the left lens had already popped out of the thin metal frame.  These glasses are SO cheaply made- I do not recommend.  There are several other sellers out there with higher quality.
1.0,Too small want a return
1.0,Broke the same day I received it
1.0,Bought a medium and a large fully intending to have to return one of them.  I ended up returning both.  Medium was way too tight.  And the large fit in the waist but I have severe drooping crotch.
1.0,Totally a disappointment
1.0,"Too small, I bought it for me size XL ........it fit my 13 year old granddaughter."
1.0,loved the print and color but when i tried it on the top is not pleated for your chest and was too small there but flared out big time at the bottom.  I'm a 36DD and my chest was smashed into this dress with no way to make it look like my chest wasn't being smashed flat...….very disappointed because it is very cute otherwise.
1.0,Too tight on the legs
1.0,"I ordered the dress on July 18 and it didn't come in until Aug 8. It fit so poorly that my seamstress said it would require 6 weeks to get it altered. We did not have enough time for that. The return process has not been easy. If you do not know for sure if it will fit and you're on a tight window, do not order."
1.0,"This ring is horrific.  I've seen better quality come out of a bubble gum machine.  The color of the silver itself looks fake despite the 925 stamp.  The ring came bent in several spots, and I was able to easily bend it with just my fingers.  I will be sending this back."
1.0,I have purchased things like this many times before I should have known before I went online to purchase itonly reason why is of course I should have known for the price that I was going to get something I could put on my two year old to play in. Very poorly made what recommend it especially if you're a professional dancer he will be embarrassed
1.0,"These masks are lined only with a flimsy, thin piece of polyester, which is only sewn in around the outside of the mask's outer fabric. As a result, when you breathe, inhaling pulls the lining into your nostrils or mouth, obstructing your breathing.  These are poorly made, over-priced, and worhless."
1.0,"The gloves are superb, but you probably will get Medium size, not Large as described. Twice shipped, twice wrong. There is no size indicated on the outside of the manufacturers shipping box, hence the problem. Try telling that to Amazon lol."
1.0,"Sizing Very misleading. Such a shame. Also, took weeks and weeks to receive this item. Very disappointing."
1.0,The clasps came off my watch. I lost my smart watch using this band. I would not recommend this at all. Smart watches are expensive gadgets to lose
1.0,Was not true to size. Had to return it.
1.0,About three sizes smaller than advertised
1.0,did  not like the tissues neither the size fits!
1.0,Fell apart the very first time I put it on. Sent back got a different bracelet from them and it did the same. Will not buy from them again!!!
1.0,"Wish I read the one review. Got a L, Runs big, more like an XL. Normal neck line not close to off the shoulder as pictured. The sleeves aren't puffy out either, they are tight. Look for a different dress."
1.0,I bought the boy package size 3t to 6 half the package was girl sockes and none were a size 3t . I'll be returning very disappointed
1.0,"Received very quickly and it good condition. Settings seem easy enough, but it appears the time is wrong; I took the above photo at 9:46. The watch doesn’t seem to correct for Daylight Savings Time. In addition, it’s not even accurate. I will be returning for a refund, as this watch just doesn’t do what a watch should."
1.0,This shirt would be good without the senpai on it the word just makes it awkward..
1.0,Started stretching out within a month's use. Would never repurchase - total waste of money!
1.0,"It looks like a fake and did not arrive with the traditional Coach cloth storage bag; however, I am working from home and don't have access to a printer for a return label."
1.0,Decent watch - but the sides that hold the watch band pins broke off - no fixing that. Lasted less than 6 months with everyday wear.
1.0,My son received item and he could not wear the Jean. Very disappointed was for his birthday.
1.0,Disliked the neck line it was huge. Maybe a lil smaller for around neck and that would be great.
1.0,We bought it in 2020 but didn’t setup to use until 2021. First thing we soon found out is the pole is to round for most tables and the base is so large that it’s not practical under a table with chairs. I really don’t know how you can use this unless you place chairs around it. We have a sectional outside but even that doesn’t work because the base with sand is so huge it doesn’t work. I’m really  sorry I wasted my money on this.
1.0,"Battery was dead. Nothing worked, no movement at all. Since it was a daily deal and the cost to replace the battery would practically equal what I paid for it I decided it made no sense to keep it. Also watch band was too small for me never mind a man."
1.0,Broke after a month. Would not recommend it.
1.0,The hole to put your head in is for a baby. Way too small. Not proportionate.
1.0,"Runs very small, cheap quality and looks nothing like pictured."
1.0,I am not that big yet these shirts were still to small as with all the clothing I have bought. I have to get XX or larger and still to small. I am only a large
1.0,impossible to put on
1.0,This is a cheap vinyl clad knock off not at all like the original version which is I have and is wearing out after three years.  Someone always has to get greedy and do it cheaper.  Very disappointed
1.0,My earnings broke after the first day use. Made in China
1.0,"I wanted to like this bikini because it looks cute in the pictures. But everything about this bikini is wrong so where to begin:<br /><br />1. The bottoms are more of an oversized thong than a hi-cut bikini bottom. And it doesn't feel like it'll stay put so you're basically going to be stuck with a wedgie. On top of that the straps on the waist roll and don't lay flat so it looks wonky.<br /><br />2. The fit is terrible. I ordered a medium which normally is fine for bikinis — even when I buy them online. But this top doesn't fit and offers zero support. The cups are far too small and I felt like I would pop out if I breathed in too deeply. For reference I'm a 36C. It feels like you'd need to be a small A cup for this to fit properly.<br /><br />I just got this yesterday, tried it on today, and promptly put it in my pile of clothes bound for ThredUp."
1.0,Look Ugly
1.0,"Questionable authenticity of these shoes! Shoes did arrive on time. However were in plain black box, not a Nike Box (Orange, white lettering and swoosh). $40 more than Nike website. Lettering and swoosh on insole flaked off after two times wear. Disappointed!!!"
1.0,"Ordered the product in April of 2016. Today's date is, August 5, 2016."
1.0,Wrong dust shields again. They have been told and still haven't fixed it.
1.0,"Cheap material, way too small I would recommend buying 3 sizes up. We bought two sizes and it still tore."
1.0,Lid broke after 3 hours. They want it returned. We live in a rural area so now I have to drive 40 minutes to a drop sight. Not worth the gas to return a $16 ring. My kid was really disappointed
1.0,Bought this for my wife. Got her 3 colors and they all started falling apart from the bottom. Good looking boot but bad choice in materials.
1.0,poor  do not work will not stay on legs of glasses non refundable product waste of money  don't buy!!
1.0,The first ball had something rattling inside of it -the replacement ball has a tear in the cover.
1.0,"There is no real.support to these bras, buyer beware"
1.0,"Too small, advertised for plus size women. I'll be returning."
1.0,"Cheap cheap, just got them , all of them are already coming apart, balls fell off on 3 of them"
1.0,The label on this scarf says polyester--NOT COTTON.  I bought it because I wanted a cotton scarf!
1.0,The dress was supposed to be a skater dress it was too long and the material wasn’t what was described
1.0,Isn't as advertised..the band is not thick like the photo and it's very flimsy..it fit way to loose and there's zero support. Don't waste your 5$..
1.0,It is see through.
1.0,The elastic doesn’t show clearly in the picture and makes it look like a maternity dress . The fabric is see through and very thin
1.0,"I love the material and the fit of your yoga boot cut pants, the band of the waist could have been smoother hopefully this is not an issue after several washes, this is the only part of the pants that could be an issue"
1.0,These laces are not 39”. Much shorter.  Not happy.
1.0,Looks like it came from a bubble gum machine.
1.0,Looked nothing like the picture. It felt really cheap and was did not flow like the picture looks
1.0,This item is falsely pictured . The cape is not long all the way to mid calf as pictured on the model. I am 5’2 and it’s a mini cape not at all what I wanted . It is only back length
1.0,Definitely not silk. Probably lycra.
1.0,I will be returning this earing not a complete set. I did not realize they were gold. I don't like gold. But who wants one pair of earings.
1.0,Zipper broke after one use
1.0,Bought these gloves and wore them THREE times to go to church.  Stored them through the summer and then forgot about them.  Got them out a couple of days and found holes across the knuckles. VERY disappointed!!!  Contacted the vendor and their offer was to give me 20% off another pair.  NOT SATISFIED!  $38 to wear the gloves 3 times is NOT acceptable!!!
1.0,🤣🤣🤣🤣😬🙄
1.0,Wasn’t a good product was going to return but zipper broke
1.0,"Zipper broke when he put gloves on first time, returned product"
1.0,Awful. I had to order this for a wedding. I’m 5 foot 3 and ordered an 8. I easily have to get 6 inches taken off the bottom...I also wear a 32 C and it it god awful tight on my mid section. BUT I’m also not the only one out of the wedding part whose dress was terribly long..there were 5 of us and we all had to pay to have them shortened. The material is heavy and hot.
1.0,The size. ITS FOR KIDS
1.0,The outfit is terrible material
1.0,"Pour texture, shiny and I'll fitted.  Very disappointing."
1.0,"I've only had it for about a month and a half, and only wore it like 3-4 times, and it ripped in the crotch/leg area!!! I wasn't even rolling hard! Tried to reach out to the seller twice, at least to just get some info about the warranty, but they never responded. We will never buy from this seller again."
1.0,"I ordered 3 masks on Sept 12.  They were suppose to be delivered a week ago and they haven’t showed up.  Don’t buy, you’ll never get them!"
1.0,not comfy horrid fit
1.0,Way tooooo small
1.0,Too small and not the look I was going for
1.0,"Figured it out, except the skinny one. How to unlock it?"
1.0,This is set to a size 0-2 in womens pants. So much for one size fits all.
1.0,These would be nice and fit great... If the right leg wasn't tighter than the left leg. Obviously poorly made. Waste of money.
1.0,I loved the color but the shoe was extremely too small I wear. 81/2 ordered a 9 and could not fit the show in my foot.
1.0,I regret buying it<br />The cut of this dress is not even close to what’s on the picture<br />Again “not even close” 😩
1.0,Lost one already to no good backing
1.0,This is a dress that was slapped together quickly in China.  Very poor stitching quality and the attention to detail (like making sure seams lie down and patterns meet) is low.  Save yourself time & money and skip this dress!
1.0,"Came off next day, screw came off"
1.0,Is cheap and within days it had a chance to change colors don't waste your time and do not give it as a gift it's embarrassing.
1.0,Only had them for about a week before the screws fell out.
1.0,"I should have known better, it is super thin material, hangs wrong and is short. Learned my lesson with this one."
1.0,"At first I loved my band, but within in a couple of months, the finish on the metal is coming off. Bad plating job."
1.0,"When the brooch arrived one of the rhinestones was loose in the package, it had come unglued.  After digging our the old glue I was able to remount the rhinestone.  I next noticed the clasp on the back was so badly misaligned that it wouldn't even capture the pin.  When I tried to straighten and align the clasp it broke off.  I was able to super glue it back on in proper alignment but I have little confidence that fix will hold up over time.  The clasp mechanism itself is very difficult to operate and nearly impossible to capture the pin.  It is so frustratedly difficult to operate I don't think I will give this brooch as a Christmas gift as I intended.  The super poor quality is very disappointing, but I guess you get what you pay for.  Lesson learned..."
1.0,Too big so these don't work.
1.0,"although I did not expect a high-quality product, I hoped these would last at least a few hours. They lasted a few minutes before pieces started breaking off."
1.0,"I received my order of one carat cubic zirconia white gold earrings from Jewelry King today and was very, very disappointed! The white gold posts are so thin they are flimsy! Also, the white gold earring backs do not stay on the posts as they are so loose they do not lock the earring in place resulting in the earrings slipping off when worn. I have ordered jewelry before from Amazon and have always been pleased. Please do not waste your money on these! I am returning these and this is the first return from Amazon I have ever had to make. Sincerely, Mary Beth K."
1.0,"The fabric is pretty but that’s where any compliments stop. The shape was awful. The form leaves weird flaps of fabric that pucker near your arm pits like it should have had darts there but they just skipped that step? There’s no boning of any kind so it’s just fabric seams. Also it’s really short, if you have a normal to long torso this will not fit you length wise."
1.0,Dislike this product.
1.0,Not a Casio product.  This watch is a knockoff.
1.0,The quartz glass is not good quality and cracks at the touch of anything
1.0,"This could be a rear nice shirt if the sizing were better. I'm 5'7 155 with an athletic build and the small fits me like a med/large. The sleeves, neck and body are all very wide. So much so that I can't wear it without looking sloppy and unprofessional. The finish is good though with no loose threads or seams. Overall I really wanted to like this shirt but the sizing is just too far off. Hope this helps ~ Chesapeake"
1.0,Wore them on and off for about 2 weeks and loved everything about them. One morning I put them on and noticed something was wrong with both lenses. Once I inspected them the outer coating was coming off. I never used anything but water and soft cloth to clear lenses. I sent them back for refund
1.0,Not happy with the item cheaply made and colors look cheesy
1.0,Dont waste your time or money. I wear a size 10-12 in jeans but I ordered an XXL which was a little to loose. I thought I'd be ok because i was sure the jeans were stretchy and they were. I should have ordered an xl. I ordered a size up because I wasn't sure the chains would be stretchy. I previously read a review where it was said the chains popped. I didn't have that issue because upon arrival some of the chains were already broken and hanging from one side. The chains were also different shades some rose gold some gold. Both cheap. The chains looked like children play jewlery and felt like mardi gra beads. The jean material itself it really thin and the wash Is not as pictured. The seam was ripped leaving a gaping hole on the outter leg. These aren't even cute for a inexpensive pair of jeans. These were just awful
1.0,Very poor quality. Nothing compared to the picture. I returned out the same day
1.0,I will be returning them.  They are overpriced swim shoes.  The lace broke 1st time I wore them.  I have had minimalist new balance shoes that were worth every penny.  These are literally swim shoes and they look and feel cheap. They are comfortable but expect them to fall apart at anytime.  The price should be between $9-$19.
1.0,"Didn’t expect these to be great quality when buying. Package arrived, glasses were broken and warped upon unboxing."
1.0,"My daughter got this and it broke the first time she wore it. We replaced it and when it arrived, one charm fell off right away - minutes after unpacking,  In all fairness, the original first one we purchased lasted about a year,"
1.0,"Pockets we're falling off as soon as I took it out of the package, this sweater is garbage."
1.0,"Comfortable fit, but dont see a difference in my sizes,been wearing them every day,"
1.0,"Have recently purchased several shirts from this brand and have been sorely disappointed.  The sizing is always much larger than the size chart indicates.  This particular shirt was 6 inches bigger than the chart said.  Along with that, the material seems much more flimsy than one would expect and, once washed, the shirt looks old and worn."
1.0,Said xxl for who a tiny person. Couldn't be larger than a medium
1.0,The material is like a t-shirt. These are not traditional boxer cut. They are somewhere between boxer briefs and traditional boxers that are cut for a teenage girl.
1.0,Wife was not satisfied and ended up looking for more durable bands...
1.0,Loved the look but  shoe fell apart quickly.
1.0,1 of them broke after 2 days.
1.0,"is wonderful this necklace, but when I open the box the necklace is broken"
1.0,Dress and material is completely see-thru
1.0,Es feo no que da bien se ve bien pero no queda bien
1.0,"After trying on once I removed from shipping package, the cloth is very soft and very well insulated and warm. However, once removed, I noticed two of the male halfs of the buttons along the front have fallen off and are stuck in the female button, the bottom male end button that goes through the fabric then falls to the ground. After going through all the buttons, one of the wrist buttons did the same thing. I was going to brush off the first two buttons and just fix it myself. But this is just rediculous. These need to be crimped better or have a more thorough quality control inspection."
1.0,"As with other reviews, this death trooper helmet falls short of the mark, it's poor quality, very small, even for a child.  And overall is incorrect in just about every aspect.  If you find this at $20.00, then it's worth it for a child to play with.  Otherwise, I would avoid this helmet."
1.0,These are super cheaply made smdh
1.0,Waste of money never again made cheap looks nothing like the picture
1.0,"Ok, I live in America. I'm a 34 B (no matter the brand), that's wht I ordered. Wht I got, was a 74 B. Ok, I thought. It's sized for a different country. Tried to try it on. The band is short by about 2-3 inches, the cup fits like an A. I can't wear it, had to get a refund. I don't recommend."
1.0,"I wish I would have taken a picture. This blazer was horrible quality, and the color was not accurate. It looked more like a doctor’s coat."
1.0,"Very pretty pendant except for the fact that I ordered and returned twice, both times had stones missing."
1.0,"We bought the XXXL thinking it would be too big and we’d have to take it in. Instead, it was too small. On top of that, one of the jewels broke off while still in the package. Avoid."
1.0,"I loved the fact I was able to find this wallet again. However, it's either VERY cheaply made OR i got a bad pick out of the bunch because i just recieved mine today and it's falling apart by the buckle. Super disappointed!"
1.0,"Sizing was not accurate, especially the strap which was too big and loose.  Not happy that I would have had to pay the shipping to return them so I just kept them and sucked up what I paid for them."
1.0,"No where on the description did it say synthetic, the silver part is unique, too bad I'd be embarrased to wear the ring, the designer is wasting their talents!"
1.0,NOT A HAPPY CAMPER-They were gifts and after waiting for many weeks - months  they finally just said must have gotten lost . But no chance or offer to resend . NOT real professional .
1.0,"Bwahhhhhhhhhhhh hahahahahaha, no matter how expensive it is. Dis crap be ugly!"
1.0,"Very poor quality,creep looking. Chain is nice."
1.0,VERY TIGHT!
1.0,Material not soft
1.0,"The beaded line broke, after a month of wear."
1.0,Do not buy this. Outfit is not as pictured.
1.0,This is not ruby it is pink
1.0,"Pésimo producto,  regale mi dinero todo lo tire a la basura"
1.0,I found them hard to use especially after I put the stopper in and then the lipstick idk maybe I have to practice but they were too small for me
1.0,I lost mine  honestly they are just strings that you tie on and the pearls fell off quickly after wearing it one time
1.0,The rose gold coloring wore completely off within a week of wearing it.
1.0,Broke in a second. It's not for people that are tall
1.0,Had to send these back.  They were a Christmas gift.  Not the color as pictured and extremely cheap jewelry.  Caveat Emptor.
1.0,Literally had this for 2 days and one of the stones fell out already! Terrible i want either a replacement sent or a refund.
1.0,"Bought for my sister-in-law who wears a size small in all other clothing items, but these were WAY too small for her."
1.0,"This dress is not of good quality, even for the bargain price of $16.99. The fabric is see through and the stitching was coming undone with big pieces of thread hanging off. I wouldn't even recommend as a bathing suit cover-up. Save your money and shop at Walmart for a better quality dress at a lower price."
1.0,Dress was huge and looked frumpy
1.0,"This set can be described in three words: cheap, thin, & itchy. I wouldn’t even give this product to someone i didn’t like. I recommend saving your coin & spending it on another cute set elsewhere."
1.0,Do NOT buy it.
1.0,Very cheap.  Clasp wouldn't close. Sent it back.  Don't purchase this.
1.0,"I would not order from Bolbove charms again, although their charms are beautiful, you can't get to it. They package it in the one by two package, with lots of tape that you need to use scissors to get to, and you end up cutting the bag or the  microfiber cloth.  The charms were supposed to be received by Mother's Day and they weren't even shipped by the day before.  How disappointing!"
1.0,Did not like it at all one was already torn up the other one didn't even last a week
1.0,"It was so baggy on. I felt it looked sloppy, but if you like to sit around comfy with large coverups, it works."
1.0,"i dislike this product, only one day of wear and hood ripped"
1.0,Feel apart mailed back no refund
1.0,Delaminated after less than a month of use. Cheap and horribly built.
1.0,"Very sheer. I thought I was getting a pain of yoga capris, but they are sheer like tights."
1.0,Waited 2 months for a custom logo bandana. When it arrived it was plain white with no logo whatsoever.
1.0,I washed them with dish soap and they still have a hazy film on them. They look smudged. Not a good product where your eyesight is important.
1.0,This is just a piece a fabric sewn together at the ends to make an infinity scarf. The edges where the cut the fabric are rough. I could have done a better job by buying the fabric at a store and sewing it up myself for less than a 3rd of the price!
1.0,Unbelievably big on teeth & out of &#34;shape &#34; to be fitting on teeth
1.0,I really wanted to like this item. I’d order two sizes up if you want the look shown in the model. Otherwise it’s just another simple shaker sweater.
1.0,"Horrible quality, would never recommend. Also took 1.5 months to arrive."
1.0,Changed the original design and materials
1.0,The worst. Can’t even wear it now. The length shrunk at least 4 inches
1.0,You do not get one of each color and there is no measurement on the back as shown.
1.0,"I've spent almost a day trying to squeeze the ends into my sunglasses. Terrible! Wont recoomend or order this again. Great quality,yes. but no use if one cant use them!"
1.0,It looks cheap. The fake leather has loose threads hanging out.
1.0,"I just had a baby, so I wanted something that would give me some extra room around my tummy area. This dress was so tight and it shows EVERY curve (and not the good ones.) If you’re top heavy like me, this dress is not for you."
1.0,Sleeves are extremely long
1.0,"For those wondering, this fits smaller head. Nothing great about this product. Sideburns don't stick without adjustment. (Tape)"
1.0,"Product was cheap, & poorly made.  Amazon refund credited account in less than 7 days.<br />."
1.0,Does not look like picture it sucks
1.0,"Short are made out of a comfortable material and fit well, however they will not last. Ripped at pocket seam within two months wearing about once a week. Not horrible for the price but I’m disappointed because I expected them to last at least two years. Workout gear should be able to withstand wear and tear."
1.0,Waste of money lol
1.0,it doesn't polish brass which is why I purchased it.
1.0,I ordered a Large but the shirt looks more like a small.  I will be returning it.
1.0,Humongous
1.0,"Really uncomfortable, weird fit"
1.0,Order down. I ordered a Small which looks like an XL.<br />Has a raw hem at v neckline.
1.0,Didn't get the color we ordered. Cheaply made and floppy. Doesn't hold its shape at all
1.0,I could get a better quality shoe at Pay-Less.  These are just plastic and glue.
1.0,This dress runs EXTREMELY SMALL!!!
1.0,Speaker keeps falling out
1.0,This was super cute; it’s a shame it was broken when I opened it. Bought it for my daughters birthday. Had to throw it away :(
1.0,"Las almohadillas traen una línea de plástico o como filo en la parte central, y ese ‘filo’ se encaja en la piel. Muy incómodo."
1.0,"The number one on the bib is not red as it is in the image, it looks brown. Very Disappointed."
1.0,Super slippery hard plastic soles. slipped on kitchen floor. BAD BAD material to use.
1.0,The earrings were smaller than I expected and didnt fit most parts of my ear.  I had two holes where they did fit and after some effort I got them closed.  My ears swelled around both piercings and they were very painful.  It was also difficult to remove due to the swelling.  I dont think these are titanium as I have been wearing titanium studs for a week with no reaction.
1.0,Received the dress and the elastic around one of the shoulders was already broken. You can see it is detached. I’m so disappointed. The color is beautiful.
1.0,The earring I got is not a 14 gauge like it says in the description so I can not use the earring.
1.0,Should have ordered extra large CYZ. Tight in crouch.
1.0,"I Loved this shirt great color nice style put on all excited fit was great, only problem I could not get the button thru the button whole. someone had sewn the button whole to small for the button as hard as I tried I could not get that silly button through the button whole. It was so nicely stitched around the whole that I could not find a way in so to my sadness I had to return it."
1.0,Too thin not comfortable at all
1.0,Received the wrong item
1.0,I ordered 2 sizes up and these were still way too tight.  When I finally got them up I looked horrible. They didn't shape anything.
1.0,it is plastic/do not buy it.
1.0,"They say it &#34;easy to install and remove&#34;  WRONG....it is close to impossible to get on and off my fitbit charge 2.  Don't buy unless you like frustration....It's not a band....Read small print, like I didn't .  When I finally got it on, it covers the time on the display, hole to small.  Then- take note you have to pry the darn thing off again to charge.  Not worth the effort."
1.0,Didn’t really like them
1.0,I needed sparkle chonies for my straight man for a glitter bomb party! These came and I was super disappointed! They looked sparkly in the pic but in reality it was a print of sparkles. I had to purchase sequins and glue them on one at a time to achieve supreme sparkle! 10 hours & a ton of sequins and 2 tubes of E6000 later I did it! No thanks to these lame chonies!!
1.0,"First off I steamed the shirt right away for my husband to wear to a wedding. I get to our hotel and notice it’s wrinkled up already in some areas even though I kept it hung up. Ok weird. I then iron it before the wedding. My husband puts on the shirt has a seat for maybe 20 minutes and when he gets up to leave the whole bottom is wrinkled up!! I kid you not, the material is the worst!!"
1.0,Returned cheaply made
1.0,"The bracelet looked cool, but the quality of metal is so poor that it snapped in half after 3 times of wearing it."
1.0,"too heavy, diasspointed but give this someone else as a gift."
1.0,The analogue arms stop working a week after my kid used it . And they block the digital clock view .. I do not recommend buying it
1.0,"The idea is brilliant, but the execution is totally lacking which shouldn't be that big of a surprise. It's basically only worth it as a novelty. The optics (plastic) just can't render a clear image. You just might want to get cheap reading glasses."
1.0,I'm disappointed about the low quality fabric.  Color ordered was pink.  The color received is mauve.  I will not return this item because I don't want to wait in line at UPS.
1.0,"I purchased these shoes at Christmas time last year, but they were too big. My child was finally able to fit them and I'd say after about two days of school wear the rubber at the toe and heel was coming up, but my daughter loves them and wants to wear them everyday.I had to super glue them back together so they looked okay.I love Umi boots but pass on these shoes they won't last."
1.0,strap is not long enough to go across the body.  the inside seam came apart. one more item for the trash bin.  I will look elsewhere for a decent bag.
1.0,broke before i even got it on
1.0,I wore the earrings for not even an hour and one of them broke.
1.0,did not like quality and the fit was large and unstable.
1.0,"Definitely not sheer, more like wrapping paper. Sent back."
1.0,"Had high hopes for these mask, hoping to be lightweight and good for warehouse work. Unfortunately they are tight! They restrict the breathing through the nose. Perhaps they'll be great for someone with the smaller head/face like a kid but not for an adult.."
1.0,Both boots leaked.  Not recommended.
1.0,although I purchased a size larger than normal it was skin tight.  It also stinks ungodly
1.0,Took for a cruise trip. I am a 34 c. Did not hold or work. Maybe for smaller chests.. and my boobs are perky .. just did not work
1.0,Not what I expected at all and definitely not rose gold.
1.0,This dress is not made for anyone who has larger breasts.  I couldn’t even get it zipped up because my boobs were in the way.
1.0,Is not like i think completo deseption not buy..
1.0,"I’m leaving a one star review because I didn’t get the item I ordered. Additionally, when I opened the package, the item smelled strongly of perfume. It seems to have been worn previously and laundered. I’m returning the item for a refund."
1.0,It says in description never to fade or tarnish look at mine I only wear it here and there can I get a refund or a new chain mine is 30” and I payed 70$!!! What’s good can we solve this issue
1.0,Felt the material was of low quality
1.0,This shirt fits more like a medium the a small.
1.0,"Only one chocolate bunny showed up, it was supposed to be 3 of them, and it was completely melted. Don’t waste your money, go to the store."
1.0,"What it doesn't show is the connection, which is simply one strand of strong yarn looped in a strange fashion.  I gave up on trying to adjust it and cut the yarn and tied it off, but the surgery didn't work.  A waste of cash."
1.0,"These feel cheap and look cheaper. Obviously I knew I wasn’t getting real pearls for the price, but for $100 I was expecting better. The “gold” clasp is really plastic painted gold, the “clutura” pearls are just plastic, they didn’t even knot the string. HUGE waste of money, I could have gotten the same thing at Claire’s for $20"
1.0,It broke before my husband got to wear it 😡
1.0,"Unfortunately I did not get the size I needed. I ordered an 11 and got a 7.5 so I can't truly review the way this product feels when walking. It is a very cute shoe, and if I had my size I could give an accurate review."
1.0,waistband broke off the second time worn it they are glue not sewed down. cheat  band it will cost me to replace the band.
1.0,Supposed to be army but it's navy
1.0,Cheap - NOT sterling silver as advertised. Am returning.
1.0,"The low score is not related to the gloves themselves,  they are nice quality and a great but especially for the price. One star is for the sizing, I ordered a small and they are tiny, maybe a 4 year old would fit them.  I then ordered a large and received the same tiny gloves again. Very disappointing."
1.0,Horrible. Very cheap looking the gold on the flowers don't match the gold chains it's aweful
1.0,"Ignoring the fact that only 1 of the 2 pack was in the packing, the super hard Velcro has the pointy side is facing your head.  Terrible design."
1.0,"Order this top for my vacation and it arrive and is NOT the picture shown, it’s a totally different<br />Top and is made so cheap<br />Feels like a scam!"
1.0,"I had these on for 10 minutes and they started to fog up.  I tightened the goggles and it got worse, so I loosened the straps to create better airflow between my eyes and goggles and it cleared up for a little while, but eventually fogged up again.  I was bummed because they do look really nice."
1.0,"I felt cheated and feel not at all worth for the cost, for the following reasons<br />1. I ordered the color/design shown in the first picture in the attached, and what I received NOWHERE resembled what I ordered. What I received is as shown in the second picture. This is clearly cheating.<br />2. The description clearly says it's 60% cotton, but it does not appear to be 60% cotton.<br />3. I can confidently say that it's going to become half size of what it's now after 1st wash (have not washed), will not last after using one or two times.<br /> (I did not wash yet but I can say that).<br />4. Very cheap looking, not at all worth for what it costs.<br />I  still kept instead of returning only because of the pain involved in packaging/shipping etc... and shipping cost  sort of being lazy."
1.0,"meh you get what you pay for. Unfortunately, for me, these are pretty much unwearable. Im currently wearing them for the first time today and they are both rubbing the inside of my ankles and for sure making a callouse I will have to deal with when I get home. They fit fine but the back right inside of the boots is killing me. Mind you  I work in an office, (not alot of walking), its only 11am and they 're killing me. Will try to return although the box has been scrapped and idk how customer service will deal with this scenario..."
1.0,Lost the gold color quickly
1.0,so the size chart is totally a lie... pay attention to the first number more ... XL probably fit 31 - 34 and you will have absolutely no ball room
1.0,I was truly disappointed on the quality of This item It was soo poor.<br /><br />Let’s start by saying I removed item from packaging and immediately noticed that the zipper was flimsy.. i bought this item to wear for my birthday so i figured of course let me try it on make sure it was good before my actual bday celebration.. it fit great so I was good..<br /><br />The day of my party i put it on and as I’m slipping it into the zipper jus split.. I was sooo upset.. I did not have a back up plan so I had to jus wear something that I was not happy with for my Day..<br /><br />I  do not recommend purchasing this  at all.. cheap material and zipper jus fell apart.. I am so disappointed
1.0,"You get what you buy, don't like that this is all push based; there's no spring to help with the force like some other handheld piercing guns."
1.0,No me gusto se ven muy falso
1.0,"As soon as I received this package, I tried this on at home and then I spent like an hour to clean off the lints from this sweater. I tried to clean all the loose lints from the sweater, but in vain..."
1.0,"These hats are huge. Not just big.<br /><br />I will never wear these. They do say bog size, however, I did not think they would be this big!"
1.0,You can see the color of the shirt underneath the embossment of Tigger.  Very disappointed.
1.0,"There were 2 flimsy pairs of underwear that arrived, advertised as 4. Unacceptable!"
1.0,Very cheap fabric.  Had to return it. Also...it doesn't fit as advertised.
1.0,Terrible quality. Broke within the first few days that I wore them.
1.0,They were carefully photographed to not show the seam on each one of them which makes them look cheesy. They’re also bigger than what they appear in the marketing photographs
1.0,Bit fitted around the face and no way to tighten
1.0,"Junk, to thin, no support"
1.0,"I thought these were the same I'd ordered a while back, nice thick sweat bands for hot yoga, well......NOPE! Save your money go for the better bands!"
1.0,This sweater was not at all like the one pictured. Way too small - felt like I was putting on a little girls sweater. Material was also super thin and had a strange smell. Not impressed. Definitely going to return.
1.0,"The item looks nothing like the photo - it's huge.  It's like one big sheet with a hole cut out for your head.  It's not flattering at all, I'll be returning it."
1.0,Bad leather n smells bad
1.0,"The hardware on this item is plastic ( meaning the piece where you'd adjust the straps) it popped as soon as I put it on, I wouldn't recommend this product"
1.0,"I'm a US size 20, and ordered the xxl expecting a moderately tight fit, having thick thighs. Came nowhere near fitting. Gave to a friend who is a size 12, fit her perfectly. This sizing is insane."
1.0,"I recently purchased this eating set for my step daughter for Christmas. We were very pleased with how they looked, nice shine, loved the screw back. Obviously, she wanted to put them right in as soon as she unwrapped them Christmas morning. The first one was great, back came off and screwed back on fine. The second earring however did not. The back was stuck to the point that just simply twisting it, to try to remove the back so I could put it in her ear, resulted in the earring to break clean in two right behind the stone with the back still attached to the post. Very disappointed in this set, although I will be returning them, I will probably have to buy another set since my step daughter is constantly losing her earrings and this is the only pair we've found for her that had a screw back. Hopefully if we do settle for this set again, I won't have repeat problems with them."
1.0,Sizing is wrong. I sized up to a 3x and the shirt fits like a xl.  Sending back.
1.0,I bought in my regular size and this dress squeezed the life out of me. Recommend buying at least one size up if you do it at all
1.0,"Cheap material, too thin and too small.  It was returned."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:8f852009ab6c2629c80bfb5681c4ee3e]] DO NOT RECOMMEND
1.0,"Got blisters the first week, which is understandable of a new boot. Had to relace it to hold my foot in place at all. My toes are almost touching the tip so their not too big. Started falling apart at the seems after 2 weeks of light use.<br /><br />1 year update:<br /><br />The boot heel isn’t cut for a zero drop insole so it rubs high. It’s an awkwardly large toe box made of poor quality leather. I’d say worst boots I’ve ever owned, but the new AR 670-1 Rocky lightweights are just as bad. Stick with your issue boots or buy garmont"
1.0,They didn't state on tiny it was!!! It didn't even fit my iPhone 6plus phone 😑
1.0,Nice glasses just wasn't for me
1.0,This is made incorrectly.
1.0,"I was deceived by the picture,its a very small purse."
1.0,Loved her til her tail broke off. Very sad.
1.0,It's a roach blip on a stick! The claw edges on the clip are very sharp and scratches your jewelry. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Big mistake<br />Poorly made. Paid 14.70$ and had to pay 6.00$ to return it. One side of the vest longer than the other
1.0,This thing is a piece of junk! Not worth the price for the cheap material and pixelated picture. Only positive thing would be my son thought it was cool...but looks like it cost all of $3 to make.
1.0,This dress was terrible right out the package. It's as pink as Pepto-Bismol and is cut to fit a rectangular box. Mrs. SpongeBob SquarePants is the only thing that comes to mind when I see this dress. It's a tent.
1.0,Terrible product<br />Broke before even wearing<br />The vent comes unstitched<br />Don’t buy
1.0,"The length of the shirt in the picture is not the same as the product I received. It was a lot shorter and didn't fit loose like the picture either. The fabric is clingy, but is soft."
1.0,"The top is not proportionate to the rest.  Body too big, top very small"
1.0,This is NOT the color shown.  It’s more a weird almost lavender grey blue.  I would have loved the image color or aqua but this isn’t flattering at all.  We finally opened it for a pageant and couldn’t wear it because the hooks at the neck were completely missing the connectors on the other side.
1.0,I got it and it looked more dark pink then anything! I was quite disappointed. :( I hope to find a good purple color.
1.0,This arrived smelling like it was soaked in mildew.  Very disappointing as it was a cute leotard.
1.0,Bad quality. The back ripped after 1 wear.
1.0,Never received.
1.0,"I have a small head, so these must be for kids because they do not fit at all!"
1.0,The dress was way to tight..using as beach coverup.
1.0,The purse was supposed to be new but you could tell that it had been used.  The stitching was worn and coming apart.  Will never buy one again
1.0,"This dress deserves zero stars! I ordered the rainbow dress because I thought it was beautiful. It arrived looking nothing like the picture advertised. The material was awful, almost like a shiny, cheap tent material. The sizing was off as well. I returned it and have yet to receive my refund. Save your money!"
1.0,Garbage leather. I have only had these for a few months and the leather is cracking and looking bad.
1.0,Would have given 0 stars.  The strap would very easily pull off the mask thus rendering the mask useless.  It just was not happening on adults but kids also so it is just not the size of the person’s head.
1.0,"18g earrings not the universal 20g. Seller &#34;awesome&#34; was very rude and not helpful at all. The earrings were very small, nearly too small for a toddler girls ears. If you have thicker earlobes don't but these"
1.0,"Way too big, am returning it.<br />Guys pls take just your normal size if you gonna get this, or even a size smaller."
1.0,The sleeves are very tight and  uncomfortable
1.0,"Came with a hole in it, would not recommend..."
1.0,Tried 5 sets of batteries.<br /><br />Didn't work.
1.0,"I received a plain, pull-over and wash and wear dress that looked nothing like this dress. It is being returned for a full refund. How frustrating!"
1.0,"Unfortunately, this didn't hold up even a month.  The belt broke very quickly at the buckle itself. Will be trying to return.<br /><br />EDIT: Belt was sent back, still no word on a replacement/refund from the seller."
1.0,"How do I even describe all of the things wrong with my new “dress”. First of all, it’s a tee shirt, only it’s made of polyester. It’s 27” long. That’s not a dress in any stretch of the imagination. The sleeves are short, not 3/4 length as advertised and there are NO TIES. The fabrics is so thin and cheap I can clearly see my hand through it. Oh, and on top of that, they sent the wrong size. I always read the reviews before I buy, and this seemed like a sure thing. I made sure to size up to a 3x ( they sent 2x) I’m not sure what happened, but this feels like a cruel joke."
1.0,does not stay on waist but slides up.
1.0,"This is a cute dress until you wash it. On gentle cycle and after 3 washes and hanging the dress to dry, the color has faded. You can’t even wear it a a PJ around the house it looks that bad."
1.0,Material is very thin. Also material stretches when around the ears making the mask not stay up over nose and mouth. Would not buy again.
1.0,Fabric was thin and cheap. Size might fit a child. I tried to return it but wasn't given options that work. I live about 40 miles from the closest ups store and pickup wasn't offered so for the cost of the trip I guess I'm just stuck with the cost of something I can't use. Don't buy this. It looked so cute but useless.
1.0,"Got this as a gift for my sister, a size medium.  She said it fit strangely is shoulders and arms.  She is doing to give it to my daughter (size small), but isn't at all sure it will fit her.  Maybe my 10 year old grand daughter!"
1.0,Dont like the shape of it. Its not like it looks on this picture :/
1.0,Broke after a month !
1.0,Disgusting synthetic cheap material. It is not normal cotton t-shirt material. It is a synthetic blend and feels gross.
1.0,I ordered 4 shorts all were 2 extra lg! No way! All were way to small
1.0,"Cute concept, but poorly constructed. Cheap metal"
1.0,I used the product for less than a month. It was amazing and fit great but in a short amount of time it literally disintegrated. I am so disappointed as I loved this prior to the material falling apart in such a short amount of time. I am returning this item unfortunately. I wish it had worked.
1.0,"I bought these for Halloween (last year), and they didn't even make it. So cheap. You get what you pay for."
1.0,"It’s a super cute dress, but way to short for me. I definitely have to wear leggings with it."
1.0,I had to return… fits extremely below the actual size chart
1.0,"It came flat, don’t buy it"
1.0,Wore it to my wedding then it broke...wanna give 1 star
1.0,"So got this because it was super cute and when I got it I realized I cannot have a key made of it for what I wanted it for. The design grooves on it mirror any key that I have so idk if its just some kind of key design not meant for California? I got it for my house key, wont work, looked to my car key, wont work. Tried my office keys, asked my mom if any of her keys would work, asked a friend and this design of key just can not work for anything so its completely useless. Even tried to ask questions about this maybe even if there was a different design layout for it and nothing. So not happy with this purchase"
1.0,"It is horrible, bad materiales, cheap, bad manufacture, its not a sweater, its cheap costume like materials, totally dissapointed. do not buy, i was rip off"
1.0,I love this watch the way it fits &n looks on my arm. It is beautiful and keeps great time. I've had it for 3 months  & it is great. Rachel
1.0,Nice band but not built to last.  Material on the band began to peel back within two weeks.
1.0,"This isn’t a sweatshirt. The material is as thin as wicking technology but it isn’t wicking. The picture is misleading and not what you actually get. On top of that, it runs 2-3 sizes too small and the seams all have extra thread hanging off. I couldn’t be more disappointed."
1.0,Nunca lo recibí
1.0,"bad quality, too tight."
1.0,"I’m not sure how this happened. I read all the reviews to find my size. And while most reviewers stated that the cover runs big, mine was wayyy to small. I am a 10-12. Ordered a large of the blue/purple/yellow cover up. Sooo pretty and felt great. But it was so tight. I’m very disappointed. Proceed with caution. I don’t care about label sizes and would have ordered a xxxxl if sizing would be upfront with company."
1.0,Disappointed for sure. It took forever to come and had the nerve to be awful. This &#34;dress&#34; looks nothing like the image presented.  Very cheap shapeless material.  Looks more like an shapeless oversized shirt. Idk what to call the &#34;denim&#34; more like blue material with micro white dots.  Sooooo disapointed!
1.0,The watch fit fine but the stem would not stay in.  I returned it.
1.0,They fit way too tight behind the ears on the head not for long use but for a quick go around just fine.
1.0,"Horrible in every way! Material is weird and cheap feeling, bad smell to it, the fit is horrible and it’s just not cute!"
1.0,I knew not to expect much but it feels cheaply made and it's not durable. I didn't like the material and it didn't fit well. Maybe best used for a kids costume.
1.0,Color was not described well on description.
1.0,the picture shows the post as L - shape but in fact it is not. this arrived with a straight post. They did authorize the return however I am very disappointed because the paw print was so cute and I was looking forward to wearing it
1.0,"As an aid for arthritis, some people say it works for them, others say it does not, and others say maybe it's just a placebo effect.  All I can is it didn't work for me.  Hope you have better luck."
1.0,"Horrible Quality, Terrible Fit!"
1.0,"LOOKED CHEAP, JUST CHEAP LOOKING, we send that back ASAP"
1.0,"Not cut well, does not fikt"
1.0,Is very different
1.0,"Too small in length. Advertised as 40+ inches but the length is actually around 32&#34;. The front button is loose and feels that it is about to fall off. This does not matter because there is no hole in the front to button the top of the fly.  These pants are of low quality, it is a shame because they actually fit well in the waistline."
1.0,I just got my pair of black ones today and tried them on to only be disappointed. They are way to long for me and you can see through them. I went to return them and received a message that says this item cannot be returned. Soooooo this sucks and now I’m stuck with them
1.0,The chain broke in less than a week.
1.0,"The watch band itself is nice material. I had bought it for working out with my Moto 360. Nice that you can adjust the size yourself. The reason this gets one star is that after one time wearing the band with the watch, the pin broke where it connects to the watch face. I almost broke my watch face just trying to remove the band after that."
1.0,Not the color and look as picture. Horrible!
1.0,"I ordered a medium navy blue. I recieced a large black. Returned and ordered again, will update if I get the right item that I ordered. Super frustrated!"
1.0,"This does not include a full set of letters and numbers. My order came with only 16 unique letters, an uneven amount of number charms, and 2 symbol charms."
1.0,"It is very long , and huge"
1.0,"Poor quality, cheap material, too small, no stretch whatsoever."
1.0,"My granddaughter is 2 & 1/2 years old, I bought size 4 in these nightgowns & I had to almost rip the collar to get it over her head & she wasn't very happy about it either! Very Disappointed!"
1.0,3X is  a small
1.0,It does not hold up at all with in a week it looked like it was 15 years old.. I do not recommend this pocketbook to any one that wants it
1.0,"I just took this coat out of the packaging and at first glance and feel it is great quality, but as soon as I stuck my hand in the pocket I feel a huge hole in the lining. When you open the coat up there is a hole in the lining of the inside near the hip area as well."
1.0,Cute watch but only worked for about 2 weeks. Difficult to put strap through loops. Strap is really stiff.
1.0,Opened the package and immediately the lens popped out. It didn't go back in very easily and seems like a direct hit would pop it out. I don't feel safe using these on the field.
1.0,"Received product, however did not work.  One good thing I did get my money back.  Don't waste your time in ordering."
1.0,"Very pretty earrings, but arrived broken. They appeared to have been returned and were sent out again. No quality control. Expected better for the price point."
1.0,I do not believe it is a shell. Just a thin layer of mother of pearl on a piece of plastic.<br />It was a gift so I did not return it<br />$50 waaaaaaaaayyyyy too much money 😡
1.0,DO NOT ORDER THIS!!!!!! I received an empty package. I am beyond angry!
1.0,poor quality material. looks like someone printed at home on a 3 dollar tshirt
1.0,"Cheaply made, wayyy to big and is not at all what it looks like in the picture. Do not purchase"
1.0,Not made for a woman of hips.
1.0,"Zipper is wrong , too small , and no side pockets to put your hands in correctly ! Returning it ASAP!"
1.0,"The odor of this product was so overwhelming, I did not want to handle it.  I promptly threw it away.  The seller must have been a smoker or the manufacture was from a third world county."
1.0,"This looks so tacky and cheap I laughed when I took it out of the bag. You can’t really tell by the pictures, but the beads are made of very cheap plastic. Too shiny. I could only were it in a costume. This necklace really shouldn’t be more than $3.00. Very disappointed."
1.0,"These are very flimsy. They cannot be used to pull a zipper, any pressure causes the clip to open. I had it alongside a zipper pull and it was lost off that within 24 hours. Pretty, but not functional."
1.0,Bad luck
1.0,"I purchased the 20mm size.<br /><br />The mesh started falling apart on the edges, exposing ends of wire that would catch on clothing and skin. While it will hold the watch on your wrist, it is a very thin mesh that falls apart as it is worn."
1.0,Bagged up for return.<br />Material is as rough as burlap<br />Sizing completley off..way too small..and i followed the size chart
1.0,Sending back!! Thought I was getting a sweat outfit material this is like $tree fabric! Looks like a super cheap polyester! Don’t waste your money!! Looks NOTHING like picture!! Looks more like a $5 pj set! I ordered the black tiedye one.
1.0,I picked up my package from the locker and was excited to wear it. I opened the package and the anklet was in 4 pieces. I can’t imagine how that happened during shipping.
1.0,It literally looks like a T-shirt with just some lace sewn on the bottom. Something about it just doesn’t come together tomorrow. Would not buy again
1.0,In trying on came apart will have to glue back
1.0,When I first opened the packaging I noticed there were no tags or original packaging. It was just tossed into a UPS bag. The straps were worn and one of them was completely ripped.
1.0,2 of them came broken then another broke when I opened it. The metal just isn’t good.
1.0,The pattern and color were as pictured but the material is like a really cheap night gown. Too thin and clingy to be a dress and too cheap and scratchy to sleep in. I'm not sure who this would look good on?
1.0,I think it would be great if it were bigger!  how can i send it back?
1.0,[[VIDEOID:226ca248bc1a8531beb3b8185b6fbc0b]] La ojota vino despegada y emcima no me hacen la devolución 😢

1.0,I will not be ordering anymore clothing from Amazon. Every single item I have ordered in the last year was flawed or make cheaply . China’s clothing is a nightmare . The days of good items on Amazon are over . I bought this housecoat and hung it up . I went to put it on this evening and found where they didn’t sew it and then they tried glue on it because you could feel hardened glue . They no longer have standards of quality . I would not recommend purchasing this and the material is not nice .
1.0,Looks and feels cheaply made
1.0,Did not seem like the product description. Watch says LED the numbers have no or very little back light to even read the time.<br />Not a very good product. Reviews say smart watch it isn't I knew it wasn't but I thought I only needed something simple.<br />This doesn't even do that.<br />Poorly packed just loose in the packing box.
1.0,Im a size small and are busty..The small size fit me like a double xx.....looked like a fancy moo moo...
1.0,These socks are very WEIRD! They are way too short! They barely cover your ankles and it feels very weird wearing them. Don't recommend unless you want to bring back the Bobby Soxer look.
1.0,The material is nice but it is made very cheaply and it has a disproportionate cut.
1.0,too light I light heavy streling silver but it was cute
1.0,I liked this product very much but the zipper quality is not so good In few months the zipper is not working. Not statisfied.
1.0,Buyers read the reviews. That was my mistake. I really don't love it. ;(
1.0,"Was nice to give to my grandma, however after 2 weeks the charms started to fall off."
1.0,I DO NOT LIKE THE DRESSES AT ALL THEY ARE NOT TRUE TO SIZE I WANTED TO SEND THEM BACK BUT I COULDN’T GET A RETURN LABEL. I
1.0,[[VIDEOID:5e6ba7d633daee443ec24e03f59652dd]] Not as shown in the picture … its too different from it
1.0,This bag is sticky. The vegan leather is very sticky on the edges and I can’t get it cleaned.  Boo
1.0,My son used it for one day. The controls didn’t work well to set the watch accordingly.
1.0,The “waterproof” material doesn’t breathe well and is noisy as you move around. Not for those looking to be stylish.
1.0,The top of the bag tore when I was packing it the very first time for an easy overnight trip. Very disappointing.
1.0,These glasses are junk. The people who rated it 5 stars must have no idea about quality or attention to detail. These glasses look and feel like they were made from the same company that makes 3D glasses for the theater. Even the nose grips are like my grandmas glasses from 50 years ago. Worth $10 tops.
1.0,I'm glad I read the feedback. I will not waste my money!
1.0,Leo was way too small.
1.0,"I got this as a gift for my birthday. The very first time I put it on, the buckle release mechanism was locked and would not release. I've used these style of belts for over two years now so I'm very familiar with them.<br />I had to cut this belt with scissors to get it off."
1.0,You get what you pay for. It does not sit the way the photo shows.
1.0,"Was almost see through, arms size was very small."
1.0,"Ordered 3 in 1, did not receive earrings. Disappointed"
1.0,Nowhere close to the size/height it indicates. My daughter couldn’t even get them on.
1.0,"Didn’t work for me. Way to big. Felt for the price, it wasn’t up to standards."
1.0,I don't like it  not the same material and rather small.
1.0,To Short
1.0,"IMO the pearls and the gold looked fake. Not to say they are, but that is how they looked to me. The gold did not look like any rose gold I've ever owned, and the pearls were more grey than pink. I had to return them."
1.0,Sizes is not correct
1.0,"I have a fun little pig that brown poop comes out of his but and makes kids roll with laughter.  Somehow a I missed that the “poop” is the worst shade of red that it looks painful, sick, and disgusting.  The look on people’s face is shock and disgust, not giggles as with the pig with brown poop.  NOT FUN or FUNNY!"
1.0,"Really thin and flimsy material, not the thick knit pictured at all. So disappointing.  Runs super small/short. Too much of a hassle to return, will probably just donate."
1.0,The elastic broke the first time i wore it😳
1.0,I know it's fake but I left it on like a regular piercing. .obviously. well it turned green and had gunk from the piercing turning ugly. It had nothing to do well my belly itself. Do not buy
1.0,Was not what I expected look and felt cheap. Pants don't go to ankles . Did not like it at all.  Thumbs done
1.0,"Horrible product, didn’t even use it an entire day. The moment I went to pull it to use my badge it came apart completely coils string and all."
1.0,Cheapest and ugliest suspenders. Would never wear.
1.0,Item came with frayed and stray ends.  The size was smaller than the normal fit for a M/L. Merchant would not exchange for the tattered material.  Products material is also very cheap feeling.
1.0,Bull keep your money
1.0,Was broken when it arrived. Only cost a dollar so I won't bother returning and were much smaller than a dime. Wish it weren't broken since they are very nice.
1.0,This clasp was broken when I received it.  I was able to somewhat fix it but then the whole thing fell apart the first time I used it.  Very cute but I don't recommend this product.
1.0,The goggle I received looking like someone opened and returned it.  Both of the protective films were broken.  I returned it
1.0,"You can't possibly wear this out. It's good enough for a private night with your man, but not for the public to see lol. It shows everything."
1.0,To big for my taste
1.0,"Son lentes para niños, la imagen totalmente engañosa."
1.0,I'm very disappointed in this mask. The mask looks nothing like the picture. This mask is only a half mask and has no way of being attached to your face.
1.0,Really cheap junk not even Sterling or turquoise down right low don’t even know how this is legal
1.0,ordered an XL thinking the shirt would fit comfortably.  Shirt is made extremely small and i doubt my 8 year old niece could wear it!  very disappointing as i waiting over a month to receive it
1.0,I am an average sized woman.  I was so excited to get this so I could wear something a little prettier than my regular black band.  It is really pretty in person - I will say that.  As far as adjustment goes - that is a different story.  I adjusted it to the smallest it would go and I could still push it up to my elbow.  My 200lb husband could wear it on his wrist at the smallest setting.  So sad because I really like how it looks but can't wear it.  Bummer.
1.0,"VERY CHEAP,,,,,NOT HAPPY AT ALL.  IT LIKE WALKING ON A SLICK  BOARD."
1.0,Came ripped
1.0,The plastic frame around the nose isn't covered by foam and causes pain to the bridge of the nose. I bought two pairs and both were exactly the same. I would not recommend these.
1.0,The headband “wings” are sewn upside down so my daughter is very sad that her headband wings do not stand up. The “necklace” stone is the wrong picture and design. Disappointed
1.0,"I should have checked the reviews before I bought them. I didn’t expect stellar quality for $9 but this was beyond awful quality. Rings were crooked, some still had sharp edges from the making process. Save your money."
1.0,I am not happy this order
1.0,"Nice earring, when ordering it said it comes with the set of both earrings but upon arrival it only came with one earring."
1.0,Poorly made; too thin and too small for hands.
1.0,See the stone loose in bag
1.0,"Cheap fabric, poorly constructed and just plain cheap and crappy looking dress.  NOTHING at all like the photograph!  Nothing elegant about the real dress that arrived."
1.0,This is not a dress! It did not even cover my lady bits and fit like a parachute. Different no.
1.0,"Very bad product, in wash all thread r coming out , I would not suggest this product to any one"
1.0,"Basically the design is intriguing however that's as good as it's going to get. If you are a grown person or over the age of at least 15 I'd say these socks will not fit you. Unless you are anorexic and have a size 4 shoe these socks will not fit you. I barely got the tips of my toes through the mouth of the socks. Like typical design embossed socks the design stretches out and loses its luster as you wear them or at least in this case attempt to wear them. It's a shame, I have a job where I have to walk around a lot and usually wear shorts because of the heat so I like to at least have fun with my uniform via my socks. To say I was disappointed is a understatement. I definitely would not recommend"
1.0,The straps broke on the first use. I would give it negative stars if I could. :(
1.0,I ordered my normal size and it's so small I can't even zip up the back.  WAY TOO SMALL!
1.0,"Turned brown a week after I started wearing it. The silver colored outer layer very thin, wears off quickly."
1.0,I ordered a size 10 and it fits like and 11 or 12. Total disappointment!!
1.0,"Hardware on one came apart within a few days.  I bought ahead of season, and am beyond the return period. DO NOT buy these!!!"
1.0,The posts associated with these earrings are too large and hurt my ears. The design is beautiful but inserting the hoop is not for the faint of heart.
1.0,"Cheap material, stinks like chemical as most reviews have stated, and zippers are terrible (broke within two weeks of use).  Only thing worth recieving any form of positive rating on this product is the color."
1.0,Very poorly made.  The stripes on skirt and bodice not aligned so that it looks a mess when it’s on.  Returned.
1.0,The description of these rings were labeled as women's and not men's. When I got them the width of the bands were so thick. They do not look good on a women's hand unless your figures are on the bigger side. The sizing is a little off as well. I got a 6 and it fits more like a 7.
1.0,"Maybe cause I have no idea how to use this but it wouldn’t stay in one place, didn’t have no idea where the clear straps would of went it was a mess and I’m order the e/f cup"
1.0,"Too small, after carefully considering other reviews and size chart, still too small... band and cups."
1.0,The garage door openers you sent me were not compatible with my chamberlain opener 953 CB
1.0,Very cheap. Thread ripped at the shoulders.  The black is tighter than the white and beige. But still should not have ripped.  I was only putting it on!
1.0,Wrong size!
1.0,The length of the legs were longer than described on-line.
1.0,Cute but they roll down :-(
1.0,I ordered these for my kittens and loved the look. They had them on for 1 night and they fell apart. Broke my heart.
1.0,"Loose, little compression.<br /><br />I don't see a sizing option on the product page. Even if there were, I do not see how to determine what size. I looked back over my vine information, and it appears on that that I received a Large. Neither my packaging nor the product state what size it is. So I am assuming a large. I have other labeling concerns..<br />(edit: it does say large on product page, still no telling who best fits in a large)<br /><br />Product description says ""knee high"". These are crew cut, at most. Some of the product pics show knee high, some show the crew socks. What I have and what they have pictured as a crew sock lines up.<br /><br />Compression. Hm, well.. the level of compression isn't listed anywhere. These are very light in that regard. Likely as compression as a regular nylon/poly sock.<br /><br />It could be that the large is too big for me? *MAYBE* a size smaller would provide better compression. BUT I took a picture of how much more I can stretch them out. I am skeptical of adequate compression. NONE of my other compression socks do this. And I am no stranger to compression socks. I wear them every day for the past ten years for a couple of medical reasons- all types- open toe ankle, open toe knee, closed toes knee, closed/op toe thigh high. Various compressions from light to firm. I typically go with 20-30mmHg, but for the open toed variety, usually a lighter/medium compression of 15-20mmhg. Too much below that and you just have typical socks. In my experience, every product page shows a size chart. This isn't showing one so I can't say if the issue is entirely on my end. Most often I go with a large. My ankle measured above bone is 10.5"". (17"" calves), size 10/11 wide feet. I'm not a tiny boned person!<br /><br />So.. these may simply run large if a large is sagging on me. I feel a vague sense of compression in the foot area, primarily where the band hits. I will continue to wear them and test them out. If I learn anything new, I will surely be back to edit.<br /><br />Might be a good starter set for those that can't easily get socks on feet.<br /><br />I do love the neon green color!"
1.0,These are chinese plated fake chains. dont buy
1.0,The look is very cheap and fake vintage-y
1.0,"Picture shows it at waistline,  it went to lower thigh,  almost like a mini dress"
1.0,"Tights were soft and keeps you warm, But they were very tight on the thighs unbarable more for a small to medium size person they should change the sizing chart because it's a lie 1 size doesn't fit all/most<br />I returned them still looking around for others<br />I had a picture of them on but it got deleted to show you all what they looked like on"
1.0,All of them were broken within a few days. Went on a child's size shoe.
1.0,Didn't last long before the watches stopped working.
1.0,Not a quality made shirt.
1.0,The color chipped and it smelled like nail polish. It looked better online than in person.
1.0,I'm 5ft 6in and the skirt was to short
1.0,Way too small from stated size.
1.0,It is 2 times smaller than the size you order.
1.0,"Excellent quality product, but at least two sizes too small."
1.0,Very cheep
1.0,Had bracelet for about a month not even worn daily. The band separated from the clasp. Need to use a stronger glue.<br /><br />Edit. Decided to super glue back together. However now beads fell apart . Zero stars
1.0,Hand washed them and air dried them and they fell apart.
1.0,I ordered a XL in this dress and it fit like a size small. 🤦🏽‍♀️  It’s a stretchy like material and A little sheer this is horrible. I don’t recommend this dress
1.0,"Horrible quality... the material is see through, looks more like a curtain"
1.0,It is super high waist it almost came up to my boobs
1.0,This sweatshirt is more of a salmon or light coral color. It is not the color shown in the photograph. I wish I'd read the reviews before I ordered as I see many complaints about the color. VERY misleading. I'm really afraid to wash it now due to the pilling complaints as well. Clothes just can't be trusted on Amazon.
1.0,See-through and runs small
1.0,The absolute biggest con! You only receive the square. Do not buy if you are looking for the whole mask!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,Not that cute in person! Color is different. More pinkish. Not long like the picture either.
1.0,"I wear a 15, these socks were too small for size 11 ,are skinny socks in style now?<br />Total waste of money!<br /> Can someone show me to the men's department<br />  PLEASE"
1.0,I’ve bought other inexpensive sunglasses and they are not the best but they are not terrible. This pair was just BAD. The packaging is worth more than the sunglasses. The second I took them out of the pack and went to clean them the lenses fell right down.
1.0,In some parts it fit fine but in others it was too big and I got the large one n I'm 5&#34;1 n I weight 125
1.0,"Fits ok, kind of warm, BUT...<br />When sliding out of bed slipping into these should be easy.<br />Not so much, the back heal has zero support making it necessary to<br />bend over to pull back of slipper up.<br />Not exactly the first thing I want to do when first waking/getting up.<br />HARD PASS......"
1.0,The tiny box that it came in was all scratched up. When you opened it the box was dirty on the inside. 🤢 if I could give this 0 stars I would. Don’t buy it.
1.0,False description!!!!!!!! Changed material...<br />The green ones on the left are the leggings I have ordered before from this account.<br />The blue ones are the ones I just received and they feel like dress pants and don’t even stretch. VERY DISAPPOINTED! Why do you have to change your product! Very frustrating!
1.0,"Literally, this happened when I tried it on. I'm not sure if all of the masks will do this, but I purchased this to prepare for having a student with hearing loss. I'm pretty bummed."
1.0,"Was looking for sharmrock charms and other shamrock-themed items. Found these, but...these are NOT shamrocks --- they are four-leaf clovers. Or, as true Irish laugh and call them: ""American shamrocks"". Another appropriate name would be ""Sham-shamrocks""! Disappointed."
1.0,Necklace is extremely short in length
1.0,Only received one cord. Clasp broke immediately. Would not recommend.
1.0,The color was dull and the fit through the waist was not great--it wasn't even on both sides.
1.0,Broke while putting on
1.0,"Pretty flimsy, dont sleep with them. Caught mine brushing my hair and its ruined"
1.0,Product was huge I ordered the 11 and it was so large and wide it fit more like a 13 mens. Material creased on the top of the boot just from trying it on. Cute but not good material and ran very large
1.0,I’m always so hopeful when I order bathing suits on Amazon but this one unfortunately was made cheap and does not fit well
1.0,"No lining for a blazer jacket, poor sawing. Overall it looks cheap for that price"
1.0,The dress has a zipper on the side but they sowed up the side so you cannot use it. So it would fit well if you could access the zipper. Otherwise get it in a larger side as you will only be able to pull it over your head.
1.0,It was returned bc I gave wrong address. . Hoping to get another one. .
1.0,Clip too small.
1.0,"If you like to look like you're wearing a shapeless sack then this dress is for you. The material seems nice but there is just zero shape to it, extremely unflattering. Being taller at 6 feet the length is more like a long shirt. I am returning it"
1.0,Runs very small. Cheap fabric..
1.0,"Ordered 18mm in brown.  Received a sewn, top grain leather faux alligator band that says ""genuine leather"" but has me questioning, not a full grain type band as pictured.<br /><br />Not worth the effort to return, but buyer beware."
1.0,The fabric is terrible .
1.0,It would be a little tight if you wore anything underneath.  I'm a size 8 .
1.0,It's very nice but very low quality material
1.0,These leggings were awful! Not as described and ripped a whole in the crotch first day I put them on. I was never able to wear them because of that. The stitching was cheaply made. I would not recommend waiting your money on this product.
1.0,"These earrings are very cute, but large. They are also NOT clip-on earrings. I bought these for my seven year old granddaughter who doesn’t have pierced ears. I don’t know why they say that they are clip-on. They are not. They will not work. I will be sending them back."
1.0,Too small for my nipples.....
1.0,Not a fan of the material. Feels stiff and cheap
1.0,Ran small in size and pockets aren't deep enough for a phone
1.0,"The hat is so cute but the snap back does not work, don’t waste your money"
1.0,"The clip broke off when my daughter tried to put them on, so we had no earrings for her evening gown!"
1.0,"I ordered a WHITE dress waited patiently only to receive a BLACK dress. Horrid fabric, awful fit. Just not what is advertised. DO NOT BUY this dress or from this provider"
1.0,Terrible material ripped the first day i wore all of them dont buy
1.0,The most uncomfortable bra I have ever had.
1.0,would not fit a childs wrist
1.0,For larger women
1.0,Very poor and cheap quality.
1.0,Unfortunately it is still I assume being delivered. After a number of phone calls I am doubtful but still hold out hope it is on the way. Looked to be a nice sturdy piece of metal so was hoping to test it out.
1.0,The sizing must be for micro sized men. Size chart is super inaccurate. I got a xxxl for my husband & they were still tiny!
1.0,Horrible quality.  Turn white when you put them on because dye is only on top of the sock material.  Horrible quality.
1.0,Flimsy and small hard to attach the balls back on the jewelry
1.0,Paper thin and itchy as hell. Please be aware all the other sweaters under this listing are cotton. The black short sleeve sweater however is the itchiness material known to man: wool/acrylic blend. Returning immediately.
1.0,Cheap jewelry. Displeased by ptoduct
1.0,Very cheap plastic belt. I returned it. Not worth the money.
1.0,This sweatshirt shrunk at least 2 sizes. Do not recommend!
1.0,This runs about 3 times or more too small. It's not worth the trouble of buying and returning until you find the right size.
1.0,I must have been half asleep when I placed my order
1.0,"The picture is very in accurate. It’s way smaller than pictured. Go off the measurements, not the photos. Returned for something else."
1.0,No strap hole bubble so keeper will not stay in place.  Falls off. Waste of money. Sorry I bought them
1.0,"After waiting over a month to get these,  they came broken ,"
1.0,Ordered a toddler size 3 received what appeared to be a six month infant tutu
1.0,Unfortunately not a case friendly screen protector.
1.0,"I bought this watch for my son to learn how to read it, unfurtunatelly, it stop working, i think it was because the battery so I change it, but it still not working, really cheap as the price. Only hage one month with it and it does not work, will bemore expensive to return it from Guatemala."
1.0,"This sweatshirt is a joke. Ordered a large, this would not fit a toddler. It's as thin as a dryer sheet. Now waiting for a request for a refund to be approved,  which is also BS. Is sold through Amazon, should be able to get a refund. Awful.  Amazon should be ashamed."
1.0,Not what is shown in photo
1.0,"I’m in the Pacific Northwest like another reviewer of these pants, and I’m not sure how they managed to stay dry in these. Brand new out of the packaging tossed these pants on, walked to my mailbox and back, and the light rain soaked right through these pants. Immediately in the returns pile they went - I wish I had spent the money on a known/reputable brand"
1.0,Not anything I thought it would be. Definitely not a sun shirt.
1.0,Difficult to change lenses and look ridiculous on.
1.0,"After just over a month of wear, shoes are falling apart. Unfortunately I am 7 days past the return policy. Super disappointed since these were fairly pricey sandals."
1.0,"Stones are pink, skulls are small and lack detail, and there are 8 stones clustered in a line beneath the skull instead of the 3 to 4 pictured. When sized on my ring sizer it measures close to a half size smaller."
1.0,"These are not actually ear piercing earrings. They are cheap, junky little things. I was just looking for some inexpensive sturdy earrings that wouldn’t fall out of my ears to keep in all the time. If these weren’t  so cheap, I would send them back, but it’s not worth my time. Maybe I will use them for some craft project."
1.0,I don’t think this product I got looks like what I thought I was ordering.
1.0,Transparent
1.0,did not like this piece looks cheap
1.0,The worst thing I've ever bought don't even try
1.0,the arm pit area was to baggy. returned item
1.0,Bag will hey there if you look at it hard enough Not worth it
1.0,"I loved these pants so much, but they started to unravel at the seams after just one wear. I had to send one pair back. I kept a second pair I had ordered at the same time, but the stitching is getting fuzzy on those and I'm noticing loose threads after only two washes. So disappointing."
1.0,The fit was somewhat tight for an XL. That wasn’t my problem. My problem was that the material was the same as those bad Halloween costumes you buy at Spirit store for an outrageous price. Definitely cheap material. And See through. But hey if you’re ok with that. The fit was ok. I would size up.
1.0,This material is poly cotton and not as discribed in ad. It does not stretch at all. Too small. Will be returning.
1.0,Wasn't flattering on me at all.
1.0,Too thin so returned it.
1.0,"Total waste.  First time wearing them the end of the tube broke off and the spring shot out.  Even if it didn't break, the spring is too weak to keep the clips in place.  Save your money, these are junk!"
1.0,"I want to let you KNOW that I ordered these pants in an XL because I like to allow for plenty of EXTRA ROOM ??? I will tell you that I-F these pants are a XL I would HATE to see what they call a Large ??? these pants are cut VERY, VERY  S-M-A-L-L !!!  I would have RATED these pants a ZERO instead of a ONE STAR if at all possible !!!"
1.0,The fabric is that weird wannabe chiffon and does not look like the model at all.
1.0,2 weeks and its already broken.<br /><br />Makes me sick!!
1.0,Don’t buy it
1.0,Product was very small.  Does not fit a 7-year old child it was intended for.
1.0,I feel like items sold in US should match typical sizes closely.  This is not an American-sized large
1.0,"Nicely made and comfortable. This is my second one. Bought one several years ago, lasted about a year then one of the pins holding it together broke and fell out. I bought it from a catalog. I like the rachet on the belt, hope this one lasts longer.<br />UPDATE: didn't last 3 months! The buckle releases the belt when I bend over and when I breathe in too deep."
1.0,Don't like they are really really tiny ☹️
1.0,"Like the bright colored logo.<br />.Dislike the material,  it's basically mafr from a disposable table cloth. The size is also smaller than a standard apron. The usps is horrible with shipping,  the seller shipped fast but the usps said was delivered in 3 days on tracking but was 8 days."
1.0,Nasty odor. Cannot wear them.
1.0,Very disappointed It looks nothing like it does on the picture very dull and it said I was getting a 16g but it was really a 14g
1.0,"Broke the first time I put them on, I recommend finding a different brand."
1.0,"Odd fit... SUPER SMALL at the waist, there is no way to wear this blouse! !! It is an impossible fit. So I guess it will become a pretty dust tag :( Amazon should ban products that take money without performing!!"
1.0,this is so wrong
1.0,Looks more like a child's shirt than a grown woman's blouse.  It's horrible. Didn't want to give it any stars but it won't let me.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,After I received this because not only did I not get 40 pcs but only half of what I got worked.
1.0,Very cheap hard material and it also has a weird plastic smell. Definitely not leather like stated in the name. I don't think it will last long and I would return but that seems like a hassle. Buyer beware!
1.0,Returned and never reordered and will NOT!
1.0,Way too long in the back. Hurts! Threw it away.
1.0,"I am 5'3, 137 lbs bra 32 D. I normally wear about a size 5 in jeans and a size small top. I ordered this in a Medium and it fit perfectly, a little snug, but a large would have been too big. This is truly jean material so there is no stretch at all. I actually liked how it fit, it would be better if there was a little more stretch. The thing that I did not like is the color, in the picture this is very light like a stone wash, what came in the mail was a very dark navy denim wash. It looks nothing like the picture in terms of color, but because it looks cute on. The reason why I have one star other than the color is because the zipper broke as soon as I tried to zip it up. It is not too tight. The Zipper was cheap and flimsy. It came off the track in seconds. I will be returning it. If it wasn't for the color and the broken zipper I would have given 4 stars"
1.0,"I liked the top, however sizing was way way off"
1.0,"Very warm, as expected, and fits well, BUT ... the buttons are on the wrong side.<br /><br />I suggest that the manufacturer fix the 'problem' and send out replacements to all who find this a problem.<br /><br />AND they are NOT fleece. Polyester is not fleece/wool.<br /><br />Fix the problems.<br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Gordon BERNSTEIN-POTTER<br />potstein@yahoo.com.sg"
1.0,It was cute I ordered it hoping it would work out bu It was itchy as soon as I put it on. I hate being itchy and I’m very sensitive to clothing or fabric bothering me so I had to return this.
1.0,"Defective from the get-go.  The chronograph  dials neither worked as they should, nor would they reset.  A purely useless chronograph watch, therefore. I would not  recommend a Howk chronograph watch.  I returned this one via amazon's exemplary customer service.<br />There are several other inexpensive chronograph brands sold by amazon. Try another brand, instead, that has many positive, verified buyer, reviews, with few to none with comments like mine."
1.0,This is awful. Cheap fabric and fraying all over. I will be returning this
1.0,This is far from ceremony gloves<br /><br />They look like disposable gloves.<br /><br />They are not the ones in the photo.<br /><br />I had to order another ones for ceremony.
1.0,Too hard to unclasp I used needle nose pliers to unclasp socks
1.0,They don’t jingle. Not a bell if it doesn’t jingle.
1.0,Runs extremely small and isn’t true to size I order two<br />Different sizes both fit the same
1.0,"DO NOT ORDER THESE. I don't know why I thought to cheap out on shoes here, but I never expected them to be as bad as they are. Then again, I should not have tried to run in $20 shoes. That is my bad. The tongues slides to the side so far it disappears. You absolutely get what you pay for here. I cant imagine these surviving for more than the distance of your front door to your mail box. The pain in my calves are excruciating, I should have known better."
1.0,I normally wear a large I ordered an extra large. It was way to small I gave it to my daughter who wears a small to medium. It was to small in the bust area for her also.
1.0,No socks included in my shipment. Nice hat otherwise
1.0,Not impressed. The “leather” cracked as soon as I went to put it on. The print is now cracked.
1.0,"All polyester and no stretch with a hideous elastic waistband. I should have taken a pic before I returned it.<br /><br />Looks horrible. Cheaply made and poor quality. The material looks like the lining  found inside jackets or dress slacks. It looks nothing like the pic.<br /><br />From now on, if  there are no pics shown from other buyers, I will not purchase the item being sold.<br /><br />This was God awful. Who wants to wear clothing made out of lining. I'm so angry."
1.0,2 of the pockets were not sewn on the inside!!! I unzipped and the pocket is not intact. Very junky.
1.0,Both necklaces were broke when they arrived. Extremely cheap!!! I would not recommend buying them
1.0,I ordered a L/XL I couldn't even get it over my shoulders.
1.0,I don't know for what figure it was made....doesn't fit properly anywhere.  Chest is waaaaay too wide. You can't wear it with bra or bralette.  The color enhanced on the picture.  I'll post a picture with true color.  Also very poorly made so cheap that I wouldn't buy it if it was $5.
1.0,The croun broke
1.0,"It's made soo cheap. It was wore for about 2 hours for a school show, and it's ruin it's made with shuc a cheap materials instead of streaming it breaks away.  Definitely not worth the money"
1.0,Worst watch band ever
1.0,Jack’s face is not line up.
1.0,Clasp broke the first time my daughter tried to wear it.
1.0,The back came off just after one wear
1.0,"Smaller than described, arrived stuffed into a box that was too small, causing cracks in the purse where it was bent. Tissue paper is not going to prevent damage to a purse stuffed into a too small box. I didn't keep the paper it was wrapped in, so according to the refund requirements, I can't return it, even though I contacted them the same day and never used it. I don't think this material would ever soften, as it was very stiff. The color was what is shown, however. The zipper in the center partition was very stiff and hard to zip and unzip. Didn't seem like it would hold up well without breaking. I would hesitate to advertise this as something to use for an IPAD, as even without a cover or case, mine would not fit without showing through the top of the purse - the purse is not that big."
1.0,Why would the message be cover with black sharpie ??<br /><br />The message states (This equipment should be installed and operated with minimum distance 20cm between the radiator and your body.)
1.0,Cheap looking and not impressive.
1.0,the sleeves are extremely long and there will be no way to fix them!!!
1.0,Bought for my husband but barely fits me(husband wears 2 or3x and I wear ladies xl)
1.0,Went a size up just in case. The XL is actually a US Petite Small.
1.0,"Product arrived today, fan worked for all of five seconds."
1.0,"weird fit, but very cute. wish it worked out"
1.0,Very flimsy. If you are looking for a temporary fix then this is great for you. How ever long term I don’t recommend. I don’t really think they are gold anything. I bought this product in July I’m writing this review in January and for the last 3 months this product has been turning my finger green/black colored. Currently saving money to have my ring re polished and coated as well as re sized. The product scratched my wedding set up pretty bad. And I constantly have to keep re adjusting it ALL THE TIME bc it’s so easily pushed back in. Honestly. Just go with something else!
1.0,Necklace is extremely flimsy always turning about. I bought a jewelry box and gave it to my little cousin
1.0,"This necklace definitely has a cheap costume look to it. It does not look at all delicate like it does in the picture. The chain is pretty thick and looks like something out of those gumball machines. I was pretty disappointed in it, but maybe it will make a good accessory for a pirate costume."
1.0,"Earnings are guitar picks...hat is felt, n would need pins to stay in place. Very costume-like."
1.0,"The hat itself is nice and fits perfectly. However, clearly this company does iron-on/vinyl images that are probably made to order. I doubt very seriously that the actual logo on the front of the hat will last. I had the perception that the Kentucky colonels logo was either a stitched-on patch or wholy made by stitching."
1.0,The band is thinner width wise than the standard Apple Watch band which is a negative. The rest of the band that tucks underneath the strap to hold down isn’t very sturdy always catches and things if you use your hands a lot. Didn’t come with the clear case as mentioned in description. I wouldn’t recommend or buy this again. False advertising. Great color and look “idea” but not a good band for me.
1.0,"Poor quality, really small even though I bought an XXL! I'm normally a size 12."
1.0,"Horrible! I bought these for my 7 year old for a two days snow trip. First day after being in the snow for two hours, her feet were soaked! Second day she put them on they were still wet from the day before! And after about 4 hours of being in the snow her 3 pairs of socks were soaked down to her skin. Do not buy!"
1.0,My house is FULL of little sock material boogers from these itchy socks. The material flakes/ falls off over and over again.
1.0,Absolute garbage. Fell apart on the first use
1.0,"Material not so great and zipper already came on done, will need to have a stronger zipper put on"
1.0,Design for little girls n cut of outfit
1.0,changes color to black  after wash
1.0,This top has a horrible shape to it. basically an upside down triangle. Wish it wasnt too late to return. Will never wear it!
1.0,"I thought these were cute, but broke the second time using and now I can't return- UGH"
1.0,Dress was sewn upside down
1.0,"This suit is cute in theory and in photo but not in reality...The pants are see-through literally can see right thru them and they have NO WAISTBAND at all...Zipper could easily rip the fabric if you zip too fast or too hard...And because there's no actual waistband, there's NO STRETCH in the waist...BUT when you put them on, they're so stretchy that they lose color and pattern...Arms too small on duster....too short on arms too....Cheap ! I am sooo disappointed!!! Total waste of excitement and money"
1.0,I ordered these for a group of 6th graders - the men's small jerseys I had were way too big - youth XL should be the next size down - these might be appropriate for like grade 1 or grade 2 students - they are tiny tiny tiny - also I suspect they would not make it through more than one wash cycle - I'm disappointed - but I should have known...
1.0,Buckle shattered first time I used it.  Made from CHEAP pot metal.
1.0,Didn’t tucking come
1.0,The skirt was advertised at a skirt with layers and a design on the skirt that appears to be cotton. The skirt is made of polyester and the the design is just a computer printed design onto the polyester.
1.0,Cute dress but made really funny!! I don’t think anyone could actually wear it! I could be wrong!!
1.0,a lot smaller then I pictured zippers broke easy  just didnt open wide enough for my wallet phone or check book and phone
1.0,Buy anything else.
1.0,It broke on 2nd day. Cute purse but poor quality
1.0,"Garbage. Do not waste your money. It looks and feels like a cheep Halloween costume. Also, only has a chest pocket."
1.0,Product is high valued and does not fit well. The plastic is not good quality and hurts when wearing it.
1.0,Super cute but very uncomfortable.. there is a protruding ring that holds the feather in it's spot that digs into the cartridge area
1.0,it’s cotton. Not dressy and kind of frumpy. Shapelessness and weirdly tight in spots.
1.0,"Heavy, uncomfortable cloth, poorly cut, returned but never got refund."
1.0,"The post was a little crooked, so I went to straighten it and the top broke off.  The stone was way bigger than I thought (and yes, I read the product description first)."
1.0,The fabric was horrible
1.0,They’re too wide. When I bend over they fall right off my face (and I’m not thin)!
1.0,"The bill of the hat stuck out ridiculously too much, feels way too silly to wear out in public. Kind of disappointed"
1.0,"Llego una talle equivocada y no me permite devolver, estoy en<br />Ecuador y acaba de llegar . Pedí talla 8 años y llego 24 meses"
1.0,"The color was pretty, but the material is super thin, hope Good will likes it"
1.0,The chain was to short and the lock mechanism also is horrible it gets stuck when trying to open/close to insert the ring.
1.0,"Not sure where these were made, but they were WAY TO LONG. Did NOT fit.!!!!!"
1.0,"I have ordered this twice and returned it both times. The shaft on the arrow and the arrowhead itself both times was discolored. Very disappointed, as otherwise it would be a lovely piece of jewelry."
1.0,After 6 months of use during water sports activities the lenses have begun de-laminating causing a smoky appearance in those areas and making the glasses unusable.
1.0,Poor quality cost runs way small and cost more money to ship back. Gave it away yo charity
1.0,"False advertising. Non Compression, no support anywhere!"
1.0,"These looked good and fit good, but they ripped the 3rd day I had them. Just ripped like paper as I put them on. Don't buy!!!!"
1.0,Runs very small bought for my mom and it doesn't cover her shoulders.  Plus mid back there is a hole.
1.0,total garbage
1.0,Tested the product after it arrived and honestly not the best results. I will not risk it!!
1.0,Missing an earring and missing a red jewel in the necklace.
1.0,Made very small.
1.0,Fake and broke the first time i wore them
1.0,"These are a NO for me.. I wouldn’t recommend buying these. Let’s put it this way, if I saw these in a  store I’d pass them right up and totally label them as cheap and poorly made. They’re not what I expected at all and they are super uncomfortable/itchy. The “high waisted” elastic is NOT high waisted. Sad to say they are just another knock-off company that stole the photo from the original company and are selling cheap versions. I’m returning them."
1.0,Just after 1st wash.....<br />Bad quality material<br />Not worth the money
1.0,"Bought because of the 5 star reviews, returned bc quality seemed poor and shoddy, plastic was not thick and looked like it would break on first drop. The connections that old the back together are made of thin metal/aluminum and connect to plastic that moved when I wiggles it slightly. That gave me little to no confidence the bag would hold up to ZFG baggage handlers at US and other airports. Caveat, I never used these bags, I sent them back the next day. Cheap plastic gave me little confidence. If they had warranty or insurance or something at purchase...I maybe...maybe would have considered trying them out. But if they fail, you would just get another set of the same luggage"
1.0,The heel metal frame was broken and doesn’t feel comfortable while wearing it. I was really excited about these shoes for my guy and he can’t even wear them
1.0,Too thickness and the fabric is very uncomfortable.  I'll never use them
1.0,"It's tiny :(. Kind of felt strange to gift this to spouse. It looks cute and came in nice tiny box...so look for dimensions before ordering.<br />Edit: My kid had the keys and she my mistake dropped it on carpet floor . Car keys and other keys were intact but this tile ( the rectangle tile on which message is written ""Hi Handsome..."" ) came off. Cheap :( . I have also  used cheap key chains and they had better quality than this fragile key chain."
1.0,I'm 5'6&#34; and about 120lbs. I typically wear a size small. That's what I ordered. What I received was labeled as small but it didn't fit as such! The size was more like a large! However it is cute. Will keep and try to shrink.
1.0,"Color, material and sizing was off. Had to return.<br />Sad, I wanted to love this shirt."
1.0,The lace doesnt match up with the bottom of the dress and is attached to the dress in the back so you cant ajust it what so ever the top part is percect but the bottom is just horrid
1.0,"I’ve worn this maybe 4 times and it already has a big hole at the top shoulder seam.<br /><br />Also, shirt wasn’t white as pictured - more of a cream color so you can barely make out the design."
1.0,Product was not as displayed in picture!! Blue on sleeve is not even blue it is a faded purple!! Do not waste your time or money.
1.0,This is a dismal<br />Product and company. Rings on the sleeves were stuck together because they are cheap decals. Company wants you to send pictures I guess so they can make it more difficult to return. It was 1 MONTH late!!!
1.0,I ordered green and grey arrived. Disappointed in customer service.
1.0,The hoodie material is cheap and gross. The images printed are also terrible.
1.0,WAY small....I ordered an xl for my 160lb frame.<br /><br />The fabric is also something I wouldnt wear in public...it looked like plastic.
1.0,looked to be good quality but after 15 minuets of riding the  chamois provided no padding. also the legs are several inches to long.  wont buy again.  cheap chamois and off brands not the way to go.  spend the extra money and get something that is quality.
1.0,The size 14 was UK not  US
1.0,Came ripped not able to wear it
1.0,There aren’t waterproof and the material is very bad quality
1.0,"Extremely small for a man , I bought a xxl and my husband wears medium/large and it’s still too small"
1.0,These shorts are way too small for me. I'll just give them to someone else. I should have tried them on sooner!<br />I don't like the material. Way too see through
1.0,Turned colors after a day
1.0,Felt like cardboard and smelled like chemicals
1.0,Zero stars.
1.0,"Anyone who is looking for something more than a fast food toy quality item, keep looking elsewhere. I was not expecting greatness but this is a poor excuse for a toy let alone an actual fob watch. It is made out of very cheap feeling plastic and the sound effects are extremely grating and echoey. I imagine that if this hadn't just been sitting on a shelf all this time it would have in fact been broken by now, even just with light use. Save yourself the money and disappointment and go buy something else."
1.0,Very thin material like a sleep wear
1.0,They look cute.  Unfortunately there were no earrings in the package I received.  In the process of returning and getting a replacement set.  Hopefully that will go well.
1.0,Cheap metal...broke as soon as took it out...cute...but def sub par quality
1.0,Thin cheap material. Short torso big sleeves and uneven buttons
1.0,"The clasp and metal was discolored, almost like it was oxide"
1.0,The zipper broke after one use 👎🏻
1.0,"I did not like this dress at all, cheap material, small in size, just ugly!"
1.0,This is for a child. It didn't even fit over my breast. It fits my 11 year old....
1.0,Seems are coming out all over the pants! This is the first time wearing them! Only had one for an hour and they started to fall apart.
1.0,Two sizes too small and I cannot find return info.
1.0,"I would not buy! I have only owned a month and the print has pretty much all the way came off. I ordered the cheetah/leopard one, but now it is just white. I tried reaching out to company,  but no response!"
1.0,"Was missing one blue eyes stone ,"
1.0,The zipper no longer runs straight after he first run through the washer and dryer.
1.0,The description states jersey and shorts and the only thing that came was the jersey!
1.0,No es acero inoxidable no lo recomiendo a la semana se le cayó el color / It is not Stainless Steel in one week it lost the color.
1.0,Just know you're losing 1/3 of your money if you return this product due to size. It says it's free return but it's not.
1.0,Masks smelled realy bad of perfume and was impossible to get smell out. Masks do not come with filters to put in filter pocket in mask. Will not buy again. Waste of money!
1.0,Didn’t hug me in the right spots. Looked like a maternity dress. Buttons were off center. You can find better at Marshall’s
1.0,"the bag is so very small, it could work with a little girl, so I ended up losing my money because it doesn't work for me"
1.0,There's a line across the thigh.
1.0,"Returned mine because they style and fit do not match the advertised product. Very cute shirts, just not what I want and WAY too small. I ordered a large and they fit like a tight Tshirt fitting right at the waistline. I expected a loose fitting, longer tank top like most yoga shirts. I was very disappointed."
1.0,I got this as a gift. It came in at the wrong size to begin with. Which isn't surprising when I've heard that about ordering from china. It's is also in NO way a 65% cotton 35% polyester blend. I'd be surprised to find any cotton in this shirt at all. It is absolutely horrible. Will be returning.
1.0,"I'm glad I got this for free. If I had even paid $1 I would been frustrated. It's very cheaply made, and I would not encourage anyone else to buy one at these prices."
1.0,I wore this necklace 2 times and the center stone with the picture fell out
1.0,"They look good and made of good material but they did not work for me, they did not fit my face and stuck to it, which is why water entered and I could not swim with them."
1.0,"This watch is the size for a women's watch, don't like it."
1.0,"Blurry, plastic lenses constantly blurry, no matter how much I clean them."
1.0,Product did not fit. I would give this<br />Product a zero rather than one star. It did not deserve any stars. Very disappointed
1.0,Do not order these gloves for rowing. They lock your wrists which makes angoodnrowing strike impossible. Poor description obviously written by someone who has no clue about rowing.
1.0,Demasiado grande para mi gusto
1.0,I wanted them but never did receive them so I'm not sure how they are.
1.0,Wayyy too claustrophobic for my children. These pants were really long and really tight. My kids couldn’t wait to get them off
1.0,"Honestly, probably one of the worst items I have received off Amazon. For the amount of money I paid, I would have expected way more than what I got. The material is extremely thin, you would have to wear something under it to keep warm or even keep your body covered up. Threads were coming out around the neckline and feels like the entire sweater is going to come apart any time you pick it up. Sizing is WAY off, I bought an XL for my husband and got what looks more like a medium for a boy. Extremely disappointed."
1.0,I order this product before and I thought it was great..but this time when I order it it was made very cheaply.I have to change it out because it dose not hold my sweat.I WILL NOT be ordering this product again
1.0,These pants run very large. I put them in the washer with woolite on delicate cycle but there were fabric splits once the wash was done. I hung them to dry. I will be staying away from this brand.
1.0,"Broke 4/17/19,  9 days after delivery... first time it slipped off my face and hit the floor.  Looks great, but will break upon impact!"
1.0,It’s just a weird shape and too hot as it’s a dense polyester
1.0,I used the size chart but the dress was huge. it can fit 2 persons. Waste of money because i wont be wearing it
1.0,"It's the size of a penny, maybe."
1.0,"There is no give in this garment. It fits 2 sizes too small. Although it looks really pretty, I noticed sequins falling off of it right away."
1.0,This bracelet broke the first time I we're it and I really liked it so I would like to send it back please and thank you.
1.0,"I love the print pattern of the dress, but the fabric is a slinky, slippery polyester. The sleeves are a little long for me, which is to be expected at my height, but the neckline is terrible. From the Amazon picture you can see it is supposed to be a crewneck, but from my pictures you can see the neckline sags in the front, almost like it wants to be a cowl neck. I have never seen such a ridiculous collar. If I had not spent $12.99 on this dress, I would send it back, and I still might."
1.0,This are not even adult size
1.0,The 'toe post' (the part between your toes) broke out of the sole after six months.  Unfortunately my girlfriend threw them out before I could send them back to Dr. Marten's for replacement.  They were comfortable while they lasted.
1.0,Fit is terrible. Top is too big and bottom is tight. It looks awful on. It's also a weird thick fabric.
1.0,"Very disappointed. Had to double check the packaging to make sure they sent the right size. Had my daughter, a size 9, try these on & they fit her perfect. At least she gets a cute pair of leggings 🙄"
1.0,This is a body-hugging top.  Shows all your belly rolls.  Even shows your bra clasps in the back.  Not for me.  Returned it.
1.0,Horrible quality - color didn't even show up and it was extremely oily.  Don't waste your money
1.0,This was delivered in a bag it was all bent and falling apart definitely a cheap plastic. The return they say it cost a lot so they offer you 30 percent.
1.0,"From the opening, there were threads sticking out. Wouldn't trust this product to last more than 4-5 washes.<br />Also, the spandex underneath is WAY too large. Very loose fit and phone doesn't feel secure in your pocket.<br />Will be returning."
1.0,Completely see through material
1.0,Do not buy this shirt dress its just a shirt and the xxl feels like a small looks nothing like the picture it has no pockets and barely went to my pelvic area it will be returned Asap
1.0,Didn't fit constable not expanded didn't feel good
1.0,Cotton mittens? Not waterproof or warm.
1.0,The product came with deodorant stain and the stench of $2.00 perfume. I'm so disappointed because this was supposed to be my birthday gift to myself😡
1.0,"I would be very cautious about buying anything from TimeZone123.  The Invicta watch they shipped to me lost 30 minutes per day right out of the box, but when I complained, they refused to take it back."
1.0,Could not get this product to fit on my Fitbit. Very disappointed. The metal rod that it came with wouldn’t fit in.
1.0,"Too large , one wash destoeyed the whole thing"
1.0,"Terrible - cheesy, thin, cheap fabric"
1.0,Thin and chesp
1.0,Very cheap fabric and see theu the strings were cheap laces I returned it
1.0,"I normally wear a size large.  The sleeves were so small that I could not raise my arms above my head.  They did not have an XL so I tried a 2XL.  The shirt was billowy, but the sleeves were but still too tight. You would have to have toothpick arms for this shirt to fit. Not recommended."
1.0,The stem on the earrings were croowe're cooking and the stem looked old
1.0,Didn't like the quality and they did not hang correctly
1.0,The character art is really ugly. Elsa looks pretty bad and it looks obviously not legit. Might as well purchase directly from Disney if you want quality and not the fake thing. Returned mine.
1.0,"Looks tarnished already, just recieved it. Have not worn it yet"
1.0,"These shirts are not compression shirts, they are just breathable, tight fitted, exercise shirts"
1.0,"Very cheap, was done after first wash"
1.0,Screws came loose
1.0,"I can't think what I like best about it; perhaps that it hasn't come apart. What I don't like is the annoying little polyester pills that have grown all over the webbing at the cuffs, the waist, and the neck. They're all over. And now they're growing on the body of the sweatshirt in front. I had Russell sweatshirts in the past that I wore into the ground and they never did this. I really recommend not buying this."
1.0,Do not buy this.
1.0,"This product is pretty and is colors as shown in picture, but it is a nylon like material and NOT  at all the standard sweatshirt fleece.<br />Disappointing purchase, as wanted something warm, yet a bit more stylish that a regular sweatshirt."
1.0,love the style just the cup is huge
1.0,a small is way too big. not warm enough for boston at all.
1.0,Disappointed. The skull is misprinted. Not recommended.
1.0,These are way too small to fit adult women.<br /><br />Probably will work for children.
1.0,Broke after opening it. Stupid. Waste of money
1.0,It broke the second time I used it!! The part where the lanyard came together at the bottom came apart and even a glue gun wouldn't hold it. I am very disappointed
1.0,"Cheap fabrics, too long, very slim fit"
1.0,These glasses stink. Like a refund
1.0,Didn’t receive right size.
1.0,The clasp fell apart very quickly.
1.0,"Not like the shirt pictured. You can tell its cheaply done. The stripes from front to back dont match up making it look awkward from the side. The colors arent the same either. Instead of the dusty white in the picture, it's a sharp cold white. The blue is brighter and again more sharp. As with the red. The stars look cheesy as they are vinyl iron ons."
1.0,The sizing is a joke! I got the biggest size available and it ended up fitting my daughter who’s 120 pounds!!! It’s also not a sweater it’s some strange t shirt ish material. Not happy. Gave it 1 star cause it is cute just made for a child LOL
1.0,Material is super thin and it is not a plus size piece of clothing. I'm a true 2X plus size. This is more like a JR size XL.
1.0,Never received it. Still love it but I wish it was shipped to the right place :(
1.0,"The watch hand (in the watch) was dirty. I know that this watch is only 110, but unacceptable. On top of that, battery ran dry after three months. Im an optimist person though...watch band is nice."
1.0,The scrip is not enough clear.<br />it looks prettier in the picture.
1.0,The bottoms were not uniform wave / zig zag . The waist area wave was almost straight. She could not wear it .<br />Sad:(
1.0,They are super thin and have a pink hue to them. Do not recommend.
1.0,Size is too small mind you I ordered a size bigger the lights don’t light no more could’ve been better for the price
1.0,I purchased this bag use at a carry all for work and it SMELLS HORRIBLE! I cannot get the smell to go away !<br /><br />It is cute but I cannot use it bc it LITERALLY STINKS SO BAD!!!!<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS BAG!!!!
1.0,"I never wrote a review which shows how unhappy i am with this product. After a few weeks wait, we got this in the mail. Wife was too excited on her new S2 band. I replaced the original with this gave it to the wife but the wife wants the band with the holes on the other side of the watch. One of the bands was stuck and took me a while to take it off, without damaging the watch and the band itself.  After a week's use, the watch fell off my wife's wrist but luckily my wife noticed it. The hinge that attaches the band to the watch was weakly secured onto the band. Waste of money."
1.0,The sleeves on this are tight. And the fit overall isn’t very “loose”<br />I even ordered my usual size because it claimed to be a loose fit. I’d either size 1 or 2 up...but even then I don’t love the material or the fit!!
1.0,they were missing a TON of stones!!!!!!
1.0,Hard to work with and they had a white crust on the parts that connect
1.0,Ridiculous.  The bead color leached onto my skin.  AVOID
1.0,"This is supposed to work for both 500ml and 1000ml bags, but definitely does not fit 1000ml bags. Even 500ml would be tight in this tiny backpack."
1.0,"these are a huge scam!!! the look like someone bought the cheapest pair of black slacks from k-mart, cut a zipper in a few chunks and sewed them randomly on and then took a satin ribbon and sewed in on the side! the material is thin and crappy! the satin ribbon hanging from it looks ridiculous! this company should be ashamed of themselves trying to pass this off as what is pictured. so mad!"
1.0,This bathing suit is made weird. The straps tie on the shoulders and one side was made wrong I guess because when tied one side was lopsided.  They bunch up between the legs and the doll swimsuit is a little bit bigger than barbie clothes. Definitely won't fit an American girl doll.
1.0,"This is the second Summer Mae swimsuit I purchased,  Both same styling, both same size,  couldn't even pull this up past my knees.  Embarrasing!"
1.0,Dress was beautiful would've ordered a larger size but had a weird discoloring in the front so I had to send back didn't want to take a chance waiting for another one to come needed to start shopping for A dress  for a wedding sooner
1.0,work great but fall off quickly.  Need an extra strap to hold heel on. Every time I have worn them they fall off.<br />Tried size large and then size medium and it happened with both.  My shoe size is women 9.
1.0,"Super cheap, entirley made of plastic including the face and back of the watch. It feels like something youd get in a cereal or cracker jack box. I should return this. Not limited edition, just a cheap watch that shouldnt be more than 5 bucks."
1.0,"I normally don't write reviews, but this outfit is horrible!!!  Don't get me wrong, it is very cute and I was stoked about the zipper.  However, my daughter wore it for the first time today after one washing and it has already ripped at the zipper.  Piece of junk.  Also, the seller claims that this zipper makes for an &#34;easy&#34; diaper change.  Wrong.  Maybe if you had a smurf for a baby.  The zipper doesn't extend all the way to the ankles, making it impossible to get both legs out and the outfit up to the baby's hips for a diaper change without ripping (which is precisely what happened).  And I did size up appropriately; she is 10.5 months old, 18 pounds, and I ordered the 18-24 month size (tag 100).  Don't waste your money."
1.0,"It was much shorter, almost a crop top style."
1.0,"After my wife wears it several months, the battery is dead just like another men's which I purchased couple months early. Bad battery life and customer service. DO NOT BUY..."
1.0,"Definitely would return, do not like the fit"
1.0,The item was shipped in just a Amazon bag it was stained I want to send it back badly
1.0,Not as expected. Top was too sheer.
1.0,"I can barely get this in and out of my pockets, worst wallet ever! Not a good choice if you have lots of plastic cards."
1.0,Bought another type that was plastic and wont mare charm
1.0,These are made from cheap “silky” material. The cut is small and awkward. I would not buy these again.
1.0,I would probably give no stars very cheaply made with very thin fabric and the fabric smells terrible
1.0,"These socks are WAY too long. I'm 5'5&#34;, and the socks go above my knees and cut off circulation around the middle of my thigh. Since I can't return them, they are going in the trash."
1.0,"Ugh! The color is completely off, it's more lilac than rose, I really needed this for a Thanksgiving outfit, and now I have nothing to wear!"
1.0,I had to alter this dress as the straps were sewn wrong and did not close the dress!
1.0,"Order 5x I wear a ex large , this was extra small , looked like a kids size !"
1.0,"Quite disappointed. I waited a month to get these and when they came not a single one fit! I have such small hands and fingers, I couldn't believe it! Only one of them even fit the pinky finger of my six year old daughter!! It marked her finger within an hour too."
1.0,"I had to send this back, it was cut very large."
1.0,It's rather interesting but it snags on everything!  The ring gets stuck in my dogs hair when I pet her so I had to give it a low score.
1.0,It's like these are made for small children or dolls they are so tiny they don't fit my nose and if I force it by stretching or using the skull ones they look comical because they are so small. Unusable
1.0,"5x was xl ,made in china"
1.0,The shirt is big and the pants are rough material and have no stretch. I bought these for my family of 6. I would not do this again. The material of the pants ripped on 4 pairs of pants in the crotch on all of them. Not good quality. They look nice but not for long.
1.0,This was completely the wrong product. It was like nothing like the picture. Very square and short.
1.0,This dress is very very small. I bought an extra large and could barely get my arms through it. Very disappointed.
1.0,Way too big. Dont follow the instructions. Try to get smaller that what is says
1.0,Size 9 is really size 7. &#34;Go BIG&#34; or go home.
1.0,Does not fit right . Does not feel great on!
1.0,"I might be one of the few that was actually disappointed with this dress. While it fits well, and a nice drape, that's about it. Made from a very thin T-shirt material, there's nothing flattering about it - whether your add a sweater or blazer."
1.0,Sizing is so so small. Not even close. These look like a youth 2x NOT mens
1.0,I wanted these leopard print hoop earrings to match an out fit. What I got was totally different.
1.0,"I returned the dress twice, once because it was too big, then the next size down was too small.  Returned that as well."
1.0,Disappointed very cheap bag I had to order a new bag from a different store
1.0,Not the size I thought it would be super small
1.0,Very disappointed.  Very cheaply made
1.0,Mala calidad. No es Plata 925. Ya paso 3 messes y se despinto..  lo quiero devolver.  No es Plata.
1.0,Once I received the sweater I was disappointed. The material was as thin as felt. Did not fit right and had printing overflow on back of sweater. Also the smell of the sweater was horrible. Not sure where the sweaters were stored but the smell is just awful. I did however love the print. The sweater itself was just poor quality.
1.0,Only wear Becca suits and this one isn’t right. There is a seam down the middle of the butt. It’s going back. Not sure why there is a sewn seam.
1.0,"HUUUUGE. No one has a face this big so they? I mean, they fit but dang! Why make them SO WIDE?"
1.0,This shirt might have the cheapest zipper I've every seen. Not only that it came misaligned. Pool manufacturing quality and design. I would not recommend this to a friend.
1.0,I was excited to get this grill then when I received it the instructions say that you have to place the clear part inside the teeth then put in hot water and when you put it in hot water the clear price that is suppose to fit your teeth comes off and messes up your pot. I would not buy this just save your money and get a real grill.
1.0,It was broken once received
1.0,Poor quality and thin material
1.0,The material is thin and cheap. I bought a small and the ankles are baggy. Super disappointed.
1.0,Love the cut. Unique look and I love knowing I'm not gonna see this ring on someone else. Looks better on. One of my favorites!<br />UPDATE: 6/26/17... the Center Stone fell out last week I am really disappointed! I loved this ring I did not wear it all the time so there was no reason for it to fall out! very very disappointed! I would love it replaced but I don't think that will happen. As of 8/20/17 no response from seller
1.0,I bought this for my husband and even used the measurements and when it finally came it didn’t fit.
1.0,"These sunglasses are awful and the lenses are warped. Anytime you look out of them, things look rippled. I wore them to a football game and kept thinking the ground was rippled when I was tailgating and it was not. It made me walk weirdly because I thought I was avoiding areas where I could trip. I had to take them off while driving too. I had others with me try them on and they agreed they were awful and greatly affect your vision. These are complete junk and are dangerous to wear when you’re walking or driving - do not buy."
1.0,"I ordered one size BIGGER than I need just to be safe and it wasn't even close to fitting.<br /><br />Worse yet, the round pads in the cups make you look like Bologna Barb from the Pitch Perfect movie. Yeah, that's an attractive look./sarcasm."
1.0,Pants tore after first wear
1.0,"Colors look funny dont match, not happy with it :("
1.0,Sizing wrong
1.0,I bought it for my baby shower for my 3 year old to wear this weekend and this is by far the biggest outfit I’ve seen her wear ! The clothes don’t even say the size on it and I remember purchasing a 3T
1.0,I loved them and they fit me perfectly but when I tried to use the restroom the zipper was stuck absolutely wouldn't unzip and I had to rip the zipper in the end so I got only a few hours of wear. So disappointed
1.0,I tossed this because it was too small and actually too heavy as well.
1.0,The pant were too tight my grandson couldn't get them on at all. The tops were nice and fit well my grandson wanted the tops so i didn't send them back. Gave the pants to a smaller relative.
1.0,Buyer Beware!  I should have done more research on this product before buying.  The reviews shown when purchasing were obviously not honest reviews.  I only checked other sites AFTER the purchase to find out how ineffective these alarms are.  I chalked it off to my stupidity and threw all three in the trash!  But here is the worst part:  I failed to read the order confirmation where they sneak in the fine print that you are automatically signed up as a member so you can receive discounts for future purchases and charge $8.95 to your charge card every month!  Are you kidding me?  How do these companies get by with this!  Don't waste your money and avoid this aggravation.
1.0,The inside quality is no good
1.0,Way too small!! I ordered a large and it’s more like a Extra Small!!! The dress is beautiful so I’m very disappointed.
1.0,"I understand it was a cheap necklace, but like another necklace I purchased on amazon, it broke the first time I wore it. One of the leaves just dropped on the ground in the first 5 minutes of me wearing it......not happy."
1.0,Horrible and cheap.  Returned it the next day.  Awful material and huge on top.
1.0,This product runs WAY SMALL!!!
1.0,Poor quality. Broke within a few days.
1.0,Very cheap the stones have been stained or painted to the color... NEVER AGAIN
1.0,"Ekouaer isn't telling on packaging or tags, but I bet it's 100% polyester.  Can't wait to experience the irritating, slightly sweaty effect of this LIE."
1.0,I didn’t even have to pull it out of the plastic bag (it took WEEKS to be delivered) to know that I was returning it. I could tell though the plastic that the material was extremely cheap and thin. It was a one sided fabric & it wasn’t attractive on the inside.
1.0,I have been very disappointed by this product and was hoping to love it.  It looked great but after 2 weeks has lost most of its crystals.
1.0,Hate it
1.0,so badly made the stitching comes right out.....very disappointing.
1.0,"I normally LOVE these leggings, but for the second time in a row, Amazon sellers have sent me the cheaper version of these leggings with the much thinner waistband. They feel like regular tights and do not hold you in nicely the way the real TT leggings do. Buyer beware! I have had better luck with the regular length M. Rena TT leggings."
1.0,Totally hated this purchase the material was cheap and it looked like a clown jumper
1.0,"The item is broken when i get it,  the clip"
1.0,"The fabric is so cheap, it’s not well made and, it’s way to small and it barely stretches"
1.0,I was very disappointed
1.0,The top hoops don't stick out enough to make the dress poof.
1.0,"These gloves tear very easily as you put them on. Dont buy these gloves, you will regret it."
1.0,Don’t buy these if your looking for real stone.<br />They are nice but not real stone.
1.0,"I give one because I didn't like the way it fits me. It will be cute if they made another style or a dress from the same soft material, the flowers are cute."
1.0,El traje es bonito. No  me quedo el  estilo
1.0,color was not as expected and shown on line.
1.0,Sized for 3 yr old not infant
1.0,"Horrible fabric. Thick, doesn’t breathe, makes shower curtains look wearable. 1970s called, they want their cheap polyester back. Not worth it, even if it was free."
1.0,Neither the solar or battery charger has an indication light to let you know if it's even working.
1.0,Fell apart in 6 weeks
1.0,"Pins for the links are defective and do not stay in, so you're constantly having to put the band back together which is frustrating. The pins are very poor quality which is probably what causes this issue. The larger pins that connect the band to the watch also have the same problem. After a few months of daily wear, one of the large pins no longer expands to keep the band in place, so the band is useless. The inside of the band also shows discoloration."
1.0,Poorly made..
1.0,This is NOWHERE near as large as they advertise
1.0,They definitely are NOT rated at -30!!!!!!!! It was only 25 degrees in phila and my hands was still freezing!!!!!!! Everything else was good.
1.0,Cheap junk do not wast you're money.
1.0,So much shorter than expected.
1.0,"I’d give this dress ZERO stars, if possible. I bought this dress in an XL. It fits true to size, however it is COMPLETELY SEE THROUGH in the blush pink color. If its this see through inside, I can only imagine how it’d look out in the sun. I bought this dress in hopes to wear for an upcoming photo session with my family, but will unfortunately have to return it. Its not worth the price, at all. The material is cheap and flimsy. Also, I thought the buttons would be function, as I am a breastfeeding mother. They are not. This is an awful dress. I would highly recommend NOT buying this dress."
1.0,all pink when I requested no pink
1.0,Made up of poor quality
1.0,It isn’t actually tie-dye as I expected - looked more like galaxy print.  The fabric wasn’t a typical cotton sweatshirt either - it was a polyester/rayon type blend maybe?
1.0,Aún no he recibido esta cartera pedí exactamente esa cartera y no la he recibido<br />Quiero mi cartera esa misma y aún no la he recibido
1.0,"The strap does not stay within the closure, other than that it is pretty, I cannot wear it as it will not stay closed."
1.0,I bought this item for a trip I took to Montreal in April. During that trip the zipper began to loosen to the point where it would not remain closed. I had also purchased a cheaper pocket waist bag which I began to use. I had put this wallet away and yesterday ran across it. I should have returned it immediately and now cannot. It is such a good looking wallet bag it's a shame that it was so faulty and with it open on either side of the zipper did me no good.
1.0,The surging on this item is poor and done too close to the seem causing several holes before putting it on for the first time.<br /><br />The material is light and the sewing is poor.  I would not recommend anyone purchase this item.
1.0,"Horrible quality dress , very thin, and too short,like very too short, like it is a tunic really. I’ve waited too long to returned it, anD ended up just dropping it at a good will."
1.0,This item runs about two sizes smaller.
1.0,Wrong color. Ordered the black and red one. It came as yellow. Must be the women's version since it wasn’t and option for the men’s. Take your time filling orders instead of grabbing first one you see.
1.0,It would be adorable if it didn't have the word &#34;DREAMY&#34; in GIANT letters across the back with added bling....it's cute enough to be house wear but there is no way that I would ever wear it in public.
1.0,What you receive is not what's in the picture.
1.0,"The coat looks decent but the patches are sort of a turn off.  What is even worse is that I ordered a 2X and even though the tag states 2X, this coat is a medium, at best.  Buy 3 sizes than what you are used ordering!"
1.0,Nothing like the picture.
1.0,There sort of nice....Not Real Guess i expected it to be as for the guess lable in the slipper peeled off the first day.
1.0,Lose and keeps falling off
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture. Cheaply made. Looks like it was printed with a cheap printer.
1.0,Very upset with the quality. Was not worth the money. Strap broke right off when I put it on and there’s no returns available. Tried reaching out to seller and never received a response. My birthday was ruined.
1.0,"Two zippers, including for the main compartment, broke on first use.<br />If not for that, it’s a fantastic bag for travel."
1.0,Waste of money.. the net of dress get torn from many places in single wash.. Pathetic material… the stitching also got open from many places..
1.0,Ordered 3xl and fits as a large
1.0,The band broke where it connects to the watch I've haven't even had it for 2 months
1.0,Color great quality could be better
1.0,Horrible colors and not accurate on size. It’s cut very small and not flattering in any way!
1.0,It’s very big and i mean big. Also none of the instructions are in English so you can tell it’s cheap. My military hubby did not like it
1.0,I bought this for my son in law and he was not able to wear it as the hat was tiny like for a5 year old!
1.0,Turned brassy and irritated my ear
1.0,El pedido no llegó completo sólo enviaron 1 suéter y ellos dicen que el paquete es de 3 sueters.
1.0,Entirely too small i shoupd be swimming in a xxxl i cant wear the pants
1.0,I ordered 8-9 year and the coat looks like a 2T ...I laughed so hard. Needless to say I returned it
1.0,Too tight and they don't look like the picture posted. Snagged easily
1.0,Sandle straps were way too big didnt even hold my foot in it and the padding from the top came off exposing the metal that holds the metal part to the strap. And wasn't even the design I ordered. Absolutely terrible and I waited over a month for them.
1.0,This broke the first time I wore it. :(
1.0,Coat was soft and I believe would have been comfortable if it fit. It was very small even after sizing up one because it states that it uses non-american sizing. Would have had to be at least 2 sizes bigger to have fit. Returned it.
1.0,I got these because i loved the colors. They are a nice material. But the necks don’t function like normal onesies. They don’t fold and hold their shape. They are so loose and weird and just hang open. I thought maybe my girl could wear them at least to bed but i think I’ll just throw them away. It’s like there’s something wrong with the design but they decided to sell them to people anyway. So lame : /
1.0,Would give these -5 stars<br />But it's not an apotion.<br />The sad part is os I am stuck with the Ugliest pair of wings I have ever seen I wasted my money. DO NOT BUY!<br />SAVE YOUR MONEY.  WILL ADD PHOTO SOON
1.0,The material was flimsy and too transparent
1.0,"Looks worn after 3 washes, the letters stuck together and ripped off when pulled apart."
1.0,Another pair of non-glare that takes a white glare and turns it into a horrible yellow glare.  Lies!  This is trash.
1.0,Waste of money…it was supposed to be pack of 3 bunnies. Only one showed up crushed and melted.
1.0,"It's a very hard bag, so disappointed"
1.0,"This jumper run really small, if you are a 8-10 you will need XL I wish they had the larger size nice color."
1.0,"So originally with these arrived I love them the look is just what I was going for! Unfortunately the fit is weird, crotch hangs strangely low and there is no way to fix it but I was willing to look past that. They are very easy to snag, and after even one wash inside out on delicate cycle and hanging to dry they are visibly damaged and it gets worse every wear. I’m going to throw them out after three wears."
1.0,I love these glasses but the ones I received are scratched on the silver areas you can tell it was painted because it's starting to peel I haven't even had these a week very sad
1.0,No support at all
1.0,"Runs small and the waist is very low, bend over and anyone will have butt crack!"
1.0,"These are really cute, but I am super disappointed that only one of the earbuds works."
1.0,"Bluetooth range is horrendous, it couldn’t even keep a stable connection from my hoodie pocket. The product turned demonic in a little bit of wind and it slowed down and sped up my audio occasionally. I admit it was funny, but the tech is gross. It made it through... 1 walk. Fantastic."
1.0,It Rolls down
1.0,Turned brown in less than a week
1.0,The for was great but started to pill after 1 washing.
1.0,"The chain broke right off, and all of the coloring turned a rusty color.  Will never be able to wear again."
1.0,"Waaaayyyy to small, def fit for children. Totally upset"
1.0,I received on September 30.<br />I am using it for almost a week.
1.0,"This is just an ugly scarf.  It doesn't look at all as the picture shows it, and it's too much trouble to return it.  Ick, I just don't like it at all."
1.0,"Don’t waist your money, looks cheap in person"
1.0,Size incorrecto. Tela muy corriente
1.0,The gem fell out within hours of receiving this item. Disappointing. Please don’t waste your money.
1.0,"We really liked these at first, but we’re terribly disappointed when 2 months later (not even daily use) the straps started disconnecting from the base. They are for our three year old who isn’t terribly hard on them. Not sure if you can return but these are completely unusable now."
1.0,These shorts are made from a very poor quality fabric. I ordered two pairs and they both ripped after minimal usage. I am tall and slender so it's not like I have a big butt putting any stress on the fabric. If you hold these up you can see light coming through at the corners of the pockets where the stitching is so poor.
1.0,Very pretty but so small and so rigid it's impossible  to get it on the ear.
1.0,I just got these today and I only got 8 pieces: the tunnels are all different sizes and I received a pair of 00 tapers but only one 4 and one 2. Not very happy.
1.0,Way to small and it’s not sweatshirt material
1.0,Chain broke first day I wore it :(
1.0,The material is soft and good quality but the print is pixelly and very poor quality. Very unhappy with the look of it.
1.0,"I don't know the sizing scale they are using, but a 5xl fits more like a USA large, there's nothing plus sized about it! Very unsatisfied!"
1.0,Very beautiful in picture... not what I expected when I received in mail. All the little white flowers were falling off upon taking it out of the package- it was very heavy- I don’t know how a child could wear this- and there were hard glass like flowers on it- pretty in picture- not in real life
1.0,Not even remotely close to being the right size.  I have a 40” waist and i buy big so i can carry concealed without any issue.  This belt says 40”-50” but when you put it on there is barely enough material to fit through the belt buckle.  My advice if you are a big guy look elsewhere.
1.0,Waste of money!! Did not keep feet warm at all! Would not recommend.
1.0,Cheap see thru glasses glad they didn't cost much!!! wont buy again.
1.0,There was not a doll gown with my order!
1.0,Very disappointing product and unfortunately I waited to long to return.  The magnet is very weak and the clip is only viable if you clip just a few bills.
1.0,Beautiful pants but too short and skinny around the ankles.
1.0,When you put the pants on the dark color turned to grey so the color is doesnt stay black unless you are a size 0. Meaning the color fades when stretched.
1.0,"Made of basketball jersey material but there was no stretch. The Clovers logo is embroidered onto the top so it really restricted any movement or room. My boobs looked like they were binded flat and looked awkward/uncomfortable. I also ordered based on the charts given which is INCORRECT. I also contacted the seller and the response I was given wasn't helpful. I was given an incomplete 4 words response ""we use true size,""."
1.0,Does not fully cover face along with gaps at the top and bottom. It doesn’t snugg even if you tighten it.
1.0,This shirt came apart at the seams on one side after about 3 washings.
1.0,It was not the proper pieces.
1.0,You have to get 2 sizes bigger but than the arms will be too big. Returned
1.0,The pants look good and are comfortable. But the fabric is thin and almost denim like and the zipper is horrible. The first day I wore these the zipper bust in the middle of the day while at work and I had to find safety pins to keep the fly closed all day.
1.0,"The necklace is so cute, I really wanted it to be good quality. The clasp was broken upon arrival and the links are too small for the clasp. The clasp can't fit in the loops. Very disappointed."
1.0,It too 1 month to arrive and by the time it came it was too small. It was a waste of money and time
1.0,Poor quality material. Thin plastic feeling.  So disappointed and not worth anything close to what I paid for it.
1.0,This is a total fake. It is blue not pink and has Russian style lettering that does not come close to spelling &#34;Pandora&#34;. It reaks of knock-off!
1.0,This item is not what is pictured or described! Awful do not order!
1.0,I usually don’t put reviews but I ordered this necklace and literally used it one time and it became black the next day!!
1.0,"This sole is too thin & flat, Acorn are much thicker & more comfortable, as is the material between the toes.  Very disappointed..  Will not order again."
1.0,The hat I received was assembled terribly. It was lopsided and the front patch was crooked.
1.0,Smelled like fish!
1.0,Didn’t fit and ordered my normal size
1.0,"I ordered an XL which, according to the sizing chart should fit a 38” waist. It comes in, and I’m really excited because it looks great...until I try to put it on. I can’t even get it past my hips!<br /><br />I pulled out my tape measure to see how wide the skirt actually is. For it to fit a 38” waist, it should be about 19” wide. It’s not even close. The actual width of the skirt is 14.5”, a full 9” too small for a 38” waist.<br /><br />Such a shame because the skirt is beautiful, but how does anyone expect customers to buy clothes on Amazon when their sizing is so horribly wrong? It’s going back."
1.0,"Opened mine up and attached it to a joy con, went to adjust the strap and the small circle clip broke off."
1.0,There ok broke in the first week
1.0,The material doesn’t allow the robe to stay closed even after tying it with the strong provided. There aren’t loops for the strong so the robe slips all over the place
1.0,"Why are all your questions for all sales, only from 1 time?  I bought them quite awhile ago.  I’m not happy with these.  Almost a thin linen pant."
1.0,The color of the design was deep orange rather than red as indicated in the pictures and name of the scarf.  The fabric is very flimsy and not fleece.  This was to have been a gift for my daughter to wear during the holidays but it item will be returned tomorrow!!
1.0,NOT THE ITEM IMAGED!<br />Especially Cheaply made. Not lush at all<br />…also is DEFINITELY far too small to fit the man pictured modeling it!<br />The gloves in particular didn’t fit the cis male (average weight/height) that I gifted these to but he had to wear the hat very askew to look decent…we ended up abandoning the set but are still picking feathers out of our hair
1.0,Sizing was horrible
1.0,"It fitted too large, as 3 sizes above, eve we did all measurement as indicated and still it's a diaster. I'm going to ask for a refund."
1.0,Not Tesla Gear. Some brand with Chinese writing was sent to me. Husband is quite disappointed.
1.0,"These wristbands are too large for the wrist and they aren't very stretchy. Maybe the elastic in the ones I received were shot. I have their 3"" & 6"" wristbands and they work great."
1.0,Necklace is a bit twisted. I really did not like the material the necklace was made of
1.0,"This is a child's size 8, not for teens. But it came with cute little plastic sunglasses. Hassle to return it. The 5 star reviews for this product are false. There are only negative reviews, the 5 stars have no comments."
1.0,Very small for the size. Cheap feel.
1.0,The style was cute but the color was flawed ( fabric). It appears that the color black had bleed into the white color.
1.0,This “sweat shirt” was so thin that you could see through it and I ordered a large and it looked more like child size..
1.0,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT I SHOULD GET A REFUND!! It was beautiful for about a week until it started turning my finger green and the “sterling silver” change to a copper color as it peeled away. Real 925 Sterling silver will only tarnish which can be cleaned with sterling silver jewelry cleaner it will not turn your finger green and chip away to a copper color this is a fake ring so I recommend to only purchase if you plan to wear or occasionally as costume jewelry. The very first photo is when I first purchased the ring before it chipped and faded. and absolutely nowhere on the ring does it say 925. I love the ring until it started to fade. I am looking on Amazon to purchase the same ring from a different buyer in hopes that it will be real silver because I do love the ring.
1.0,silver came off within a week it's brass looking now.
1.0,I wish I could return this item as I didn’t want half a shoe! It costs to much to return it ugh.
1.0,"The quality of the material is good BUT they loosely hang off your ears, nothing keeps them on. They slightest movement and they fall right off. I don't see how anyone gets any use from these. Returning asap for a different option."
1.0,Pants fit as chart described jacket was 2 sizes too small
1.0,Rings too small
1.0,Dont like..
1.0,didn't look like pictures
1.0,Arms keep breaking.
1.0,Product arrived damaged. Underwire sticking out
1.0,Will never buy this again. Used it for 2 days and it no longer works.
1.0,This is ripping and the lettering etc. is peeling off since it was an iron on.
1.0,"Nice coat. However, it took nearly a week to get me and it was prime! They shipped it two days after I was supposed to receive it. Additionally it was too big. I plan to order again, and go down one size. I am 5’2 and it’s down to my shins."
1.0,All zippers broken upon receipt. Poorly made.
1.0,"Not exactly what I was expecting, I was hoping for a bracelet 9&#34; in diameter for more of a relaxed fit instead this bracelet is about 7&#34; in diameter and it grips my wrist a little too much, which I guess is good if you want all the stones to make contact but it pinches my skin and pulls my arm hairs, for future reference it would be nice to incorporate a band size so that customers don't have to but it to realize it doesn't fit the way they would like it to"
1.0,"I was looking for a Mother of the Bride dress and it did not fit. I was also not impressed with the quality but since I did not pay much for it, it was worth a try because the photo looked lovely. I submitted a return as usual with Amazon and was told I needed to contact the seller. They gave me the run-around, and finally sent me a return label. When I took it to my usual mailing office, they said it was going to cost $80 to return to China and that I should contact Amazon. Amazon has not replied to my communication either. In the meantime, this seller has listed that they have refunded my money and waiting on return of the dress. They have NOT refunded my money. I am really disappointed in how Amazon and this seller have done business. I have never had this trouble before with anything I have purchased, but I will now be leery of anything I purchase from China. I guess I'll be donating the dress to Goodwill."
1.0,Great fit and support but the stitching for the tongue came out after a month and just after the return period expired.
1.0,Many of these fell apart when I touched them.
1.0,Doesn't fit like the measurements
1.0,Way too small! If you are large in the chest area do not purchase!
1.0,"I received my order on Jan 5th 2021. I LOVED the jogger until recently a little over a month of having it. The seams are all falling apart, there are holes in the pants and it’s barely keeping together. So sad, I ordered so many pairs to have them all turn out like this..."
1.0,garish<br />looks plastic<br /><br />i threw it out
1.0,Don't like the fit and the tires broke with one pull
1.0,If you're not careful the zipper will catch the skin on your stomach. If
1.0,This is very thin and can see right through it also very baggy and wrinkly and cheap looking
1.0,Chain cheap. Ruins the look
1.0,I am satisfied with the item I did receive but still am missing 5 other items.
1.0,"Cork on the bottle is so loose, had to glue it together.<br />Flower inside DOES NOT glow.<br />Bad buy!"
1.0,Once again the clamps broke and no longer fasten to the shirt.
1.0,Horrible. Smells like chemicals and is not what was shown in the pictures. Do not but this! There are so many better jeans on here for the same price!
1.0,These socks are NOT 100% COTTON! It’s a lie..
1.0,Pictured as a light turquoise but came in a very dark green color
1.0,Very pretty in the picture poor quality do not recommend this product
1.0,Do Not Buy this Jacket! It looks nothing like the photo herein
1.0,cheap. threw them away.
1.0,Didn’t look good on me
1.0,This shirt was poorly constructed. Waited over a month to get! Please by American and stay away from chi-comm garbage!
1.0,"These earrings don’t look anything like the pics. They are super tiny, hard to open, and they were not silver, it looked rusted."
1.0,Three strands of string
1.0,It arrived without the belt and I can’t get ahold of anyone to send another one. Very irritating when this was for a trip this week.
1.0,with every movement of your body you must pull the bar down! This is annoying and just not right. the material is nice the fit terrible
1.0,A long tunic black shirt
1.0,didn't last long before broken..
1.0,order a large and it didn't fit and I had the right measurements and still didn't fit don't recommend.

1.0,cheap and not worth the money at all.
1.0,I dislike the bother of ordering & RETURNING.<br />A kind of scamming...  TheY hope that the buyer<br />doesn' bother to do the return...
1.0,It broke in probably less than a month there for not very sturdy and wouldn't want to give as gift because it doesn't last.
1.0,Came without adjustment tool so returning
1.0,This looks nothing like the photo. It’s not actually tie dye. And the material is … questionable. It’s not sweatshirt material. It’s not soft and not something you’d want to wear. The pants are also incredibly long. You’d have to be at least 6 feet for the pants to not be crazy long. Returning.
1.0,"I could not adjust mine. The hole to push the pin through to take off a piece was sodered shut which made it unuseable, got a refund from Amazon no problem."
1.0,"Don't have alot of stretch I got a large and I'm 5""9 and it's way to small"
1.0,They arrived already tarnished. Returning.
1.0,Size chart especially for women’s products is impossible .  They have it backwards that the larger the size the smaller the measurements
1.0,Not only do they fit too big. They also smell horrible. My entire room reeks like chemicals. I had to bag them and everything  still smells bad. Im sending them back. They arrived in a smashed box. I'm very dissatisfied  on the smelly materials use for these boots. I don't recommend  them.
1.0,"I bought this item because the boy short look, but it's a bikini style instead of shorts. Don't purchase this if that's the style you want."
1.0,"When I opened the package, the eye fell off! So glad that happened then and not when my son had it on! Definitely a chocking hazard! Already falling apart!"
1.0,"Very cheaply made, two earrings bended on me before the second day of wearing them."
1.0,Reminded me of a baby G
1.0,"Unfortunately they did not fit my watch, they were too small."
1.0,"The size chart for this item is incorrect, according to the chart I am a size large, my xs daughter couldn't even fit into it."
1.0,Bought a size smaller and its way to big
1.0,I was very excited about this ankle bracelet and within 2 days of wearing it broke in pieces. I am disappointed and would not recommend​ since it was cheaply made.
1.0,"I ordered an XL for my son before the xmas rush. COULDN'T SEE the size tag on it and didn't want to open the bag it came in because it was a gift. A few days after xmas come to find out, it's a SMALL! Not even a large, a small! Not happy! *Buyer Beware, someone isn't doing there job right and you don't want to pay for it!"
1.0,Ordered a small thinking it would fit my youth son. No way-it’s more like an adult large.
1.0,I would give this zero stars it’s too small looks nothing like the picture in size and it doesn’t close once to put it in and after you take it out to close it. Waste of money!!!!
1.0,"I wear a size 31-32 /30 pants and these were pretty close on the size 32/30 (S) . However the ""bell bottom"" as other reviews also pointed out , is not a bell bottom , but narrows at the knee and calf so much so it constricts any movement or blood flow its that tight . Must be a design flaw or a bad cut on mine . Seller did not acknowledge nor respond to my concerns about a possibly defective item ."
1.0,Broke after two days on a rear view mirror
1.0,Doesn't look like pictured. Too small.  Doesn't even fit a child's hand.
1.0,"Since I don’t iron, I don’t use."
1.0,"Too small, looks and feels cheap."
1.0,Only one of two bags in the &#34;2 pack&#34; arrived. There was also conflicting info on website regarding the dimensions.  Features lists bags as 7.5 x 5.1 x 2.4 inches.  Product Description lists bags as 10.5 x 6.3 x 2 inches. Actual size (7.5 x 5.1 x 2.4 inches) received was much too small for my needs.  Back it goes.
1.0,Don't buy. Worst thing ever don't buy cheep plastic JUNK MADE IN CHINA
1.0,Washed by hand in cold water. Line dried. Ridiculous amount of shrinkage. Not usable.
1.0,It lasted one day. Worst buy ever
1.0,The shirt was toren and I sent it back plus the pants was small anywhere
1.0,Did not work with sunglasses
1.0,I ordered XXXL because I knew it would small but this was like if you were a size 2 it might fit. I sent it back.
1.0,"I was really excited for this outfit for my Lo, but today is her first day wearing it, and the seams in the leg are already coming apart. For the price I expected better quality. The material is super soft, and nice, but the seams seem very poorly done."
1.0,"The dress is nice in pictures but definitely not in person! The material is extremely heavy and stiff. The top portion of the dress has weird seaming that runs vertical down the breast. The whole top section looks and feels like costume material, like something you would find in the Halloween section of Walmart. Very disappointed with the dress"
1.0,To small ordered a 5x and had to give it away
1.0,"I normally wear a Large in this type pants or XL in some. I ordered the 1x  to ensure looseness for lounging, but these don't fit well.  Waist just okay if no shrinkage but crotch too high and uncomfortable. Also I worry length will shrink as not as long as most. Will be returning and not reordering this brand"
1.0,"Did not work at all. The product was totally waste of money. Do not recommend to anyone. When I requested return and refund of money, I was told it cannot be returned and this after it wont work at all, at last they refunded the money but not back to my credit card but as an amazon gift card which again was frustrating since I wanted the money back in my credit card. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.!!!!"
1.0,Advertised as a women's XL. It was probably a youth's L at the very most.
1.0,"made cheaply, stiff leather, won't stay closed.  terrible product.  I couldn't give them as the gift I had planned.  I didn't realize I could return for free and threw them out. (9.99 wasted!!!)"
1.0,It is pointy and hard.
1.0,It was very wrong size !!
1.0,Horrible quality. Basically so thin they are disposable.
1.0,I really wanted the product but it’s not adjustable and was sized for a small child. I have small hands but adult. Don’t purchase for adult
1.0,Cheap material. Side cuts up high. Material is too thin. Does not look like picture.
1.0,"These are terrible, you can’t see through them at all!!!  And they’re super heavy.  Do not buy these if you have any intention of of using your eyes!"
1.0,Crooked graphic and peeling
1.0,"I saw this on a tiktok and thought it was adorable, in reality it was several sizes too small and barley covered my behind."
1.0,"The bracelets are as pictured, however are low quality. Look like it came from a $0.50 bubblegum machine. Keep your money."
1.0,I got it as a white elephant gift but it does not work.
1.0,Not worth your money. The seams ripped in several parts of the leggings the first time I put them on.
1.0,Broken when received :-(
1.0,Set screw stripped disallowing eyeglass lens to be installed.
1.0,Too frizzy
1.0,"I was expecting the shirt underneath, also. Returning."
1.0,"Very poor quality, like tissue paper -returned for refund."
1.0,Very cheap material . Feels itchy . Not made well at all . Don’t waste your money
1.0,Igual q la foto
1.0,The materiak was so transparent you could see my underwear through them. Returning.
1.0,I purchased both sizes and it seems to be too tight. It made my legs swell even more. It’s definitely not for me.
1.0,These are sheer and NOT squat proof. I had such high hopes for these.
1.0,Poor Quality<br />see pictures after weeks of use.
1.0,Fabric was odd and was too small
1.0,Way too small. Clothing sizes are frustrating.  The C cup is smal and so is the rib cage width. 36 is more like 32. What a waste of time.
1.0,I did not think these were good quality and didn’t hold the firm standup look the ball fell down it looked cheap
1.0,"I wanted to love this too, but this purse is nothing special. My phone is a struggle to pull out it’s not glossy like the photo and it’s very loose and plastic feeling. I usually order Oprah’s recommendations but this just missed the mark. Returning immediately"
1.0,I returned this. Was nightgown sized
1.0,"The material is like silk (seems cheaply made) the coat is very small in the shoulders (doesn't even cover my shoulders), yet the coat is so long it touches the floor when I wear it. (I'm 5'2) the pants fit loose (I'm 161lb) and are about 3 inches too long for me. I will be returning this outfit.  It fits or looks nothing like the photo."
1.0,"Order two pairs, both were broken. Bad purchase."
1.0,Sooo disappointed! This dress doesn't look like the wear of the picture. And the dress smelled very bad. DO NOT BUY!
1.0,"The youth medium did not fit, and it was a different color than it is on amazon.  :("
1.0,"This wallet is made of thin, brittle plastic. It tore as I slid my credit cards in the day I got it! I would suggest you spend a couple of dollars extra to avoid this product!"
1.0,Too small not good quality
1.0,"Very poor quality,so disappointed."
1.0,"Product failed after a couple of weeks. Even before it failed it was difficult for my vision impaired mother to hear, and forget about reading the display. Build quality is poor, and like I said it failed quickly. Will be returning with limited expectation for refund."
1.0,Awful. Accident waiting to happen.
1.0,"This is called 18 karat gold filled jewelry, but I wore it today and noticed its gold look is fading away. I have jewelry that is tarnish free, but this set is not tarnish free."
1.0,very thin...not sized correctly
1.0,This thing didn’t work for a plus size person. Who knew you have to be a twig just to wear a collar!?!?
1.0,I ordered the first pair of these and they arrived with a back seam already coming undone.  I returned them and ordered another pair.  I gave them to my Granddaugther and the back seam came completely undone with her first wearing.
1.0,Poor quality.  Arrived broken...disappointed as this was supposed to be a Christmas gift.
1.0,Doesn't witk
1.0,Couldn't even close it up. Too small
1.0,I wore these once and they broke
1.0,It fit really small.
1.0,Looks rlly weird.
1.0,"These do not focus properly no matter what you do.<br />One lens is always different than the other. They never focus the same and one gets vertigo when looking through them.<br />Additionally, they fall apart easily.<br /><br /> I've used 4 other dial Vision glasses that work fine, these don't come close to function.<br /><br />Unbelievable JUNK !!!!"
1.0,Was really cheap. The paint came off in less than a week.
1.0,"Purchased for birthday pictures & upon arrival one was already busted. It fell apart. Sad, had to find something else."
1.0,The denim band looks cheap and the face is HUGE. We gave it away.
1.0,As soon as I opened the package I was hit with a terrible smell of plastic and chemicals.  I let the shoes sit out for two days and the smell is still pretty strong.  I would be concerned about my toddler wearing these and those chemicals seeping into her skin. I will be returning these and sticking to the original Mini Melissa’s from now on!
1.0,"Seriously if you like you're Samsung watch do not buy this band. One side would not snap in, wouldn't loco at all therefore impossible to wear. The other side of the band fit but would not remove from the watch face, it took so much force to remove it that it almost broke my watch. So one side didn't fit, one wouldn't remove. Complete waste of money. You people should be ashamed of your product."
1.0,Material is okay. Much longer than expected. Bust area is larger than expected and not flattering. Order a size down.
1.0,Missing items and it was packaged as if it were used! Items were inside out and I didn’t receive the sleeves or tattoos as advertised in the description!<br /><br />UPDATED REVIEW:<br />The company contacted me after leaving this review and offered a full refund or a whole new outfit. I chose the outfit and they sent it at no extra cost. Customer service is 10/10 and now that I have the correct pieces in the set the quality is great!
1.0,Horrible & cheap material . It’s very stiff don’t waste your money
1.0,The fit is nice but the white fabric is literally see through. I also have the Tan color ones and those I really like as the fabric is more opaque and not as sheer
1.0,"Have lots of Lucky dresses but this one was a real disappointment, it has absolutely no shape and the material looked cheap and nasty.<br />Sending it back."
1.0,"Most reviewers said this hat was way to small, so I thought it would be perfect for my husband who wears a medium. Wrong! It was huge! Not sure if the other reviewers just have huge heads or if the manufacturing of each hat is not uniform. It was returned (at my expense)."
1.0,This is not an attractive dress and it is not flattering to a plus sized woman. The material was not what I expected. I returned this item.
1.0,"The shirt arrived with stains on it, and I was never able to wear it. I would like to return it, or receive a credit of some sort. Disappointed"
1.0,Fabric seems extremely cheap more of a jegging versus a Jean.
1.0,"When I opened this up and looked at the shirt I thought it had to be a joke. This is a doily gone wrong. It’s like seeing a picture of a big Mac then buying it and it’s so sad looking. The picture of the model wearing this shirt and it looking cute is smoke and mirrors. I’ve never had a garnet be too big and too small at the same time, apparently neither has Amazon because it wouldn’t let me select both lol. Don’t do it!!! Do not add to cart!"
1.0,Tarnishes very quickly
1.0,Very poorly made... daughter put it on and strap broke
1.0,"Not black, but navy blue. Red and white pattern is nice; but the blue spots are more of a lavender.  Bought it because I needed black with red white and blue on it. Will be returning. Arms too tight, made for stick arms. Body is boxy, not designed for a woman's curves."
1.0,I have an almost identical set of ankle bracelets that I've been wearing for 2 months and love them.  I put these on last night and one of them ended up on the floor - broken (the other one is still on my ankle).  Sorry but I cannot recommend this product.
1.0,Earrings broke on first wear
1.0,"I really, really, really should have looked closer at the product photo better. The quality of this necklace is beyond deplorable. It looks like a blind toddler painted the enamel on the necklace. I can't even wear it, it looks so bad."
1.0,These are great when you first try them on. They shrink significantly after. Just enough to be too smalll for an adult and not enough to fit a kid.
1.0,The hat is huge and the creases from being folded will not come out.
1.0,"Breaks easily. After 1st use the material breaks apart. I then use the 2nd pair, same thing happened."
1.0,Sizing is not correct. Way too small. Had to return them
1.0,"I purchased these because I wanted orange studs and blue studs. The earrings I received were not even close to those pictured here. No orange, no blue.  The earrings I received are of reasonable quality, they just don't look anything like the ones pictured. If you want a whole bunch of randomly-selected stud earrings, buy these.  But if you are purchasing them expecting to get earrings like the ones in the picture, try something else."
1.0,the ring was smaller than expected and cut my nose :-(
1.0,"I love these earrings, but I wore them once and they came unraveled:("
1.0,Unfortunately 2 out of 3 of the glasses cracked in the exact same spot!
1.0,Wristband defective  can’t wear
1.0,"No,pedí Tolder 9 y me mandaron un 26 muy pequeñas ,unas por grandes y estas demasiado chicas"
1.0,"This watch is very small, band wise and the face of the watch! No way this can be a man’s watch it looks like a child’s size!"
1.0,Wire scratches my finger but love the bead
1.0,Does not live up to the description.<br />A bandana is more breathable.
1.0,"Really cute hat, but am returning because of poor quality fabric and craftsmanship."
1.0,And runs 2 sizes too big!!
1.0,"TERRIBLE QUALITY. Decent fit. I didn’t even get 4 uses in and the strap is already broken. What a bummer. Stellar reviews from everyone, but somehow with minimal use these gloves are already useless."
1.0,Way way to big end up having to give away couldn't return it.
1.0,Se pelaron muy rápido
1.0,These are not sunglasses they’re just fashion glasses
1.0,Top was very loose and on my thighs it was extremely tight
1.0,Ingot a size bigger and it was still too small
1.0,Broke first time my daughter wore it. Would cost more than it's worth to send it back.
1.0,look too cheap and could smell the shoe dye
1.0,"Was sent a totally different sweater from the picture, the quality was cheap."
1.0,These are horrible!  All the balls are striped and or just break in half after a short time. Would not recommend these at all. Definitely a waist of time to try. I will definitely never purchase these again. They are garbage.
1.0,Disappointed that the Hordan symbol was a press on not stitch and the pants pilled after the first washing.  Definitely not the real Jordan wear IMO.
1.0,The width of this suit fit well but the torso was very very short. The bra cup came no where near my actual chest unless I pulled it up to where is looked like it was French cut through the leg. The pink also changed into an almost purple after wearing it one time but only in some places. The back of the suit was almost see through when wet do to the fact that it is not fully lined. This is definitely not a suit I will wear in public again but maybe in my own pool or hot tub. I was sadly letdown with this suit.
1.0,"I fit a medium or large in American sizes. This was for a petite small person. When I gave this sweater to a petite woman, the cut wasn't even right. The package took a long time to arrive from China."
1.0,Simply don't buy. Pants fell apart after one wash.
1.0,To tight not flexible
1.0,It is cheaply made. Just two kind of materials sewn together. Will not buy this again.
1.0,This shirt is so ugly and cheap looking in person. I just missed the return window otherwise I’d be returning it.
1.0,Super dark/tinted. Makes it hard to see through.
1.0,It broke the first time I put it on and it is not eligible for return.
1.0,"The color and pattern of the dress was very nice but it did not fit well.  It was way too big overall, too long, and the material feels cheap.  It is not flattering at all.  I returned it."
1.0,It's beautiful just not no 2x
1.0,uncomfortable and didn't work
1.0,Beautiful colors but way to big and way to short in length. Had to return.
1.0,The waist size fits like the size I ordered but the legs and the cuff that makes them a jogger are way too big and don’t actually cuff onto ankle. Really not flattering and not like a jogger pant. I’m returning the two pairs I ordered.
1.0,It runs small and short. The zipper is cheap and the right strap was broken upon arrival..
1.0,asked for a Refund. still waiting for a response. these are not the ones I saw. They are styled like dollar store glasses.
1.0,Chain broke immediately :(
1.0,The shape of the shirt is almost like it’s fitted for a female.
1.0,Only ears. No tail<br />Not at all as pictured. “Giant” clearly got a newborn or doll. SCAM SCAM
1.0,"Very complicated. The entire sheet is a sticker so if you want to put them on your nails, they won’t stay unless you pile a gel top coat on it. I’m a licensed nail technician and the only thing I would say they’re good for is encapsulating inside of clear acrylic. Me and 2 other techs damaged half the sheet trying to get the “stickers” off and then realized they needed to be cut out. The description of this product is horrible."
1.0,"I wore these twice and then they got a hole.  I have narrow feet and so they don't fit my toes very well.  For small calves, they did fit well on my legs just large around the toe area.  I'm not sure if that's what caused the hole or not.  I forgot about these socks because I can't wear them any longer, but I would not suggest getting them, they tear easily."
1.0,Very difficult to stay on.  Uncomfortable.  Lasted an hour after the amount of time it took to get them to stay.
1.0,Very short and wide. Need to use the wide ness material to make it longer as shown. Looks nothing like photo.
1.0,"The shirt looks good in the bag, but that is as much good as I can say. The length of sleeves and body are long enough, however the sleeves are only for a person with tiny hands, much too narrow. The body is also to narrow for a normally proportioned person. Like many shirts manufactured abroad, it is not designed for American proportions.<br />On the plus side... the refund from Amazon is quick."
1.0,"I was so unsatisfied I got the bracelet in time but it was all dirty, and look old, with greens stuff!"
1.0,"Material and construction is not worth being see wearing, sorry to say."
1.0,poor material the metal holes fall of very dissapointed
1.0,"Not real stones.<br />These are resin beads, not real stone of any sort. Mislabeled and false advertising.<br />Anyone with any experience with real agate or malachite can quickly tell these are plastic resin. Fake as all heck.<br /><br />That said, they do look okay.<br />But as costume jewelry only, and since malachite jewelry isn't that expensive...<br />Look elsewhere"
1.0,"I bought these for running - specifically for the phone sleeve.  These supposed running shorts are horribly designed for running.  If that's what you're looking for, AVOID!!<br /><br />I moved down to South Florida recently, and wearing an armband to hold my phone just became too hot.  As a result, I've been shopping Amazon for shorts with phone holder functionality.  The WZIKAI shorts looked promising.  However, 3 strides into a test run, my phone popped out of the shorts and hit the pavement.  CRACKED SCREEN!!!  How much does that suck?<br /><br />The compression sleeve has minimal compression, and the phone sleeve isn't deep - the result is any time your quad gets parallel to the ground (which is pretty much always on a run, no?), your phone is loose and slipping out.  As other reviewers noted, the compression lining isn't tight at all.  It's just completely irresponsible to tout these as running shorts and that sleeve as safe for phones.<br /><br />[EDIT] Originally wrote this for the blue medium version of this product. Same experience with the black medium version."
1.0,I wore this one time and all the color rubbed off on my arm!
1.0,First of all I am usually a size medium. I brought a large because I figured that it was a costume so maybe I would need more room. Well  the sleeves were extremely tight. The chest area. My boobs couldn't fit. I zippered the side of the dress but the material wouldn't lay right because it was too tight. Then the skirt area was way to high. It was crazy the whole thing was just wrong. Garbage. I think this would of been better for a teen or a child. There was no way that that was a large.
1.0,The product picture is completely different from the actual product. The feathers arent together and neatly rounded as presented. They are rugged and stringy which makes the product completely different. Im so disappointed.
1.0,"Worst house shoes ever. I bought them because they looked very comfortable. I was wrong. The back and sides of the shoes constantly feel like they're slipping off of my foot, and the back does slip down when I'm walking. I end up walking on the outside of the shoe more than I do on the inside. Not only that, but it feels like my feet hang over the sole. They are the most uncomfortable shoes I've ever worn."
1.0,Great idea this might work for really light chains.
1.0,The ring turned silver with two days I have bought gold plated jewelry before and the last four weeks but this one only lasted two days I posted a picture but I don’t know if the camera can see it properly two rings on my finger are silver the other one is half silver and half gold
1.0,"Upon receiving the necklace, it was pretty. However, after the second time wearing , the chain turned colors. Would not recommend buying this necklace."
1.0,I had no idea those dumb illustrations were ON the bag!  I wanted CLEAR bags.  Can't imagine why anyone would want these.
1.0,"This dress could have been super cute, however, no women can not wear it. It fits nothing like the model. Once buttoned up, your private area is fully exposed. See pics. This is a definite return.<br /><br />(Review won't allow me to post a pic)"
1.0,"I thought it was made of cotton and linen as advertised as material description, BUT it is actually made of viscose. Material is the most important to me wasting my time and disappointed"
1.0,I received it broken
1.0,"Tunnels are not true to size. I'm able to get the tapers in, no problem. When it comes to sliding the tunnels in, however, it's impossible. The only way I personally can get them in is if I shove them in resulting in minor blowouts and a lot of pain. The baggies are also not marked on which size they are making it very difficult to determine what pieces go together which can lead to damage to the ears. Not very pleased.<br />Edit: I would also like to clarify that my kit came with a missing size."
1.0,NOT BURGUNDY!
1.0,Wristbands look great but order was missing total number of wristbands
1.0,False Advertising: Not a single jacket below $28.99.. wtf.
1.0,"The top section of the sock was not very stretchy. Bought to wear while in hospital and there is no way I could manage to get them around my heel ankle area. And I am 5’ 6”, 170lbs. Had to return."
1.0,Really hard to glue ended up throwing out
1.0,Very disappointed. Liked the looks but it wouldn’t work. Replaced battery still won’t work. After replacing the back after installing battery hands wouldn’t turn even after gently pulling out the pin. Awful experience.
1.0,"Not at all like the picture, terrible quality, very small, swimsuit type fabric. I'm 5'2"" and 106 lb, ordered a small, it was way too small! Might fit a small child."
1.0,Turns your fingers green
1.0,"I originally purchased two sets and the comfort and fit (2.50) were as advertised, but I noticed scratches appearing after a month in the first two so I ordered another set as before. The second set were the same. This ""blueray blocking"" is a cheap spray or something coating the outer surface of the glass and even using the black rag provided it doesn't last over a month. As someone with cataracts the seller should be avoided for turning out such a cheap and potentially hazardous product."
1.0,Product arrived broken
1.0,Broke on first wearing
1.0,"Don't like it, came crushed in the toe area<br />Looks cheap as it is"
1.0,I purchased this sweater on the recommendation of a coworker. I actually saw the Biagio label in her sweater and loved it. She also had only good things to say about it!  I DID NOT RECEIVE A BIAGIO SWEATER!  The sweater I received was from another vendor on this site. I just received it four days ago and have not worn it as of this review. The cardigan I received was &quot;Ciela&quot; brand.  I hope it will be as good as my co worker's sweater in terms of holding up. I am giving it a low rating because of the switch in product. I will re-review after I have worn and washed the product. The mocha color in &quot;Ciela&quot; is more of a copper color.
1.0,"Extremely inaccurate sizing, got a size bigger than usually and still extremely small"
1.0,"To begin, I ordered 2.0 and received 1, 2.0 and 1, 1.50 . They look so cheap I was asked if I got them at the dollar store.<br />How do I return them?"
1.0,"The way it's made the lining doesn't match the swimming suit and it's kind of strange, the Bikini Bottom overlay is weird."
1.0,It's only one strap so it's not complete this band sucks don't waste your money
1.0,I didn’t get to wear them - they fell apart before I could.
1.0,"This jacket is very disappointing. Extremely cheaply made, I question if it's even authentic. Super thin...feels like it's gonna tear if you rub against something. Certainly not worth the price...feels like a $15 dollar coat from the dollar store."
1.0,Cold air tears right through these gloves.
1.0,The material looks more cheap than in the display picture and also the size small was humongous not for petite females at all
1.0,If I could do less I would.. took over a month..looks like it was bleached
1.0,"These shirts were supposed to be a 14-16, but they were actually much closer to an 8-10 at best."
1.0,The large gold charm keeps falling off the bracelet.  It was very disappointing.
1.0,clingy and feels too cheap
1.0,"This dress is a hot mess. Crooked seams, unraveling threads, faded black material that feels scratchy and smells bad, weird fit not at all like the picture. Run for the hills, my friends."
1.0,Plastic and cheap its junk if you pull<br />Them too much they snap and break
1.0,I'm overseas deployed I will not see this till I get home one thing I have to say I order three items would had love to had then ship all together to my daughters b-day instead of getting charge for each one for delivery
1.0,The product that I recieved doesn't exactly  match the photo. The opening for the head and shoulders  is about 45 degrees off from where the opening for the crotchless area is so it throws off the whole fit. Like one side of the leg was digging into my thigh as the other side was starting to rip as I sat down on my bed after I put it on. I would return it but like I said it ripped.
1.0,I had the watch a few days...carried it my pocket...CHAIN BROKE....VERY DISAPPOINTED!
1.0,The bottoms were WAY too small and did not fit as advertised. They are very cheeky.
1.0,My son picked these glasses from eye doctor. They were broken at school. Then we bought the frames on here because it was cheaper than eye doctor. Guess what they are now broken. So my son has to go a few months without his glasses.
1.0,This thing looks terrible. I've ordered the first one a d noticed the gold was missing from the chain and all tarnished. I ordered a second one as a replacement and it has the same issue. Absolutely terrible quality will not be ordering  from gem stone king ever again
1.0,Cheaply made and elastic is already stretched out.  Horrible Quality.  I would send all back but address is in Chinese.
1.0,"I wear a US size small, and even though the reviews say to buy one size bigger I still bought a size small. It arrived with a label size Medium, so I don't know if they were trying to adjust international sizing or if they just sent the wrong size. The shirt is ok, but too big. Sizing from China is always a crap shoot."
1.0,"Loved these sunglasses - floated, great lens...the arm fell off Within a week.  Picked them up, out them on and it fell off. Cannot put it back on.  Disappointed."
1.0,"The lenses are decent - they does a nice job of filtering out the sun while keeping the vision sharp, but the build quality is terrible.  The lenses constantly pop out - it doesn't matter how good a lens can be, if they don't stay in the frame, the whole thing is worthless.  After only a couple months of use, I gave up."
1.0,Runs very small order a size up 3x and did it get passed my thighs
1.0,Missing orders
1.0,Did not look like the picture. Kinda cheapy with iron on.
1.0,Terrible material got it that day and sent it back that day thread was hanging out did not fit how it's  showing in picture would never buy from this supplier again
1.0,Poor materials used. The frames were made of a soft medal that bent and creased as well as cracked. Kind of like aluminum foil. After receiving them in the mail I through them in the trash.
1.0,I loved the bracelet until it broke about 2 weeks after buying it.
1.0,"I'm not even plus size, just got plus size so I'd have room to fold/pull up high. They showed up ripped in the toe and top, are way too small. Roll down. Everything negative you could think of. Cant return them or get my money back. V dissapointed."
1.0,I return this<br />Becoz of the wrong size
1.0,"These glasses look so cute in the picture, but they are not nice and the view hurst the eyes. Not recommended to anyone unless for a Halloween party, just for two hours or so."
1.0,Wow; waste of money.
1.0,I was hopeful for this since it seems so basic but I am incredibly disappointed. The material is so heavy and strectchy the dress doesn’t hold shape at all and is very uncomfortable. I read a few reviews that said it was not cotton as depicted but I did not expect it to be so bad. I also read that it was better to size up but the bigger the size the heavier the dress which leads to awful draping and sagging neckline. Not even comfortable enough to just keep as a house dress/nightgown. Will be returning.
1.0,The white leggings are super are through and I don’t like the fabric either. Its very thin and feels cheap. ):
1.0,This runs ridiculously small. You would need to size up 2-3 times.
1.0,"Very poor quality, will not last long on a bracelet. Much much smaller than expected and very flimsy."
1.0,"This item is light plastic, like a toy.  The strap says it is genuine leather.<br /><br />To set up and use the watch requires downloading an app on one's smart phone, and appears to be a complicated process.  I downloaded the app, then decided to forget it.  I am not sure what neat functions this watch might be able to do, perhaps alarms that you set up on your smart phone.  I will never know.<br /><br />I got this for an older woman with macular degeneration.  She can't use a computer, doesn't have a smart phone, and anything technical or complicated eludes her.  I wanted a watch for her that would speak the time out loud, since she can't see her clocks anymore.  If she had, and could use, a smart phone, she could just ask Google Assistant to tell her what time it is!  She wouldn't need this watch.<br /><br />After you purchase the app, you get an email from a personal assistant who offers to help you if you have trouble setting up the watch.  This watch looks too cheaply made and complicated for me to bother with it.  I am returning it."
1.0,"Looks good, fits together well but does not close at all. Total waste of money."
1.0,I got better results from heavy duty starch
1.0,I'll keep this short... The other reviews were correct... The neck was too wide and the material was cheap feeling. Old Navy polos are of higher quality.
1.0,"I was totally disappointed by the product. It does not even closely resemble what the seller is showing in the pictures. The  image on the mannequin shows a much bigger earrings but these are literally half the size. Unfortunately I went with the picture of the product while ordering and not the size dimensions listed. But the design is also not close to what you see in the pictures and the beads at the bottom were not hanging smoothly, some were stuck inside, just horrible quality! Won't be buying from this seller again."
1.0,"Very small! Got the size my husband wears and it was SO small. Was here fast,  got refund fast, but wont try a different size"
1.0,"broke right when i was putting it on for the first time. I fixed it using needle nose pliers, but it was also very uncomfortable."
1.0,This is way too big for a kid...any kid. It was even too big for her dad.
1.0,Shirt was too big
1.0,This bag does not look at all like pictured!! Looks very cheap. Poor quality and smaller than expected.
1.0,Plastic elastic at the top that keeps the sleeves from sliding down the arm is really pinchy/ abrasive. Left a red mark on my arms after a short time wearing.  Not comfortable to ware. Disappointed as I salty Nike is really good.
1.0,This dress did not look like the one in the picture. The material isn't overly stiff but it was soo short and fit weird. I can't wear this dress. The top is a bit loose.
1.0,Really small and awkward thumb thumb did not fit not sharp enough to cut A leaf off.
1.0,Way too small. I really didn’t like the texture it felt cheap and I’m pretty sure you could see my nipples through the shirt. I was hoping to have the big bee effect and it just didn’t work. Returned
1.0,"I'm highly dissatisfied with this product. This doed not at all match the description. Not a single nose ring came with a ball on the end as described, and the shaft was extremely long and sharp which is a high risk for nose bleeds! I have a nose piercing on each side and lost one, so I needed to purchase new studs in a hurry so it would not close. Because there is no ball on the end it can fall out easily even if barely snagged. I am so mad that I have to spend twice as much and wait twice as long just to find what I was looking for."
1.0,Much bigger than I expected. I don't like it.
1.0,"I love this brand but not this style. The yarn started unraveling & falling off within HOURS of putting them on. Mainly around toe and heel but randomly all over; showing just black fabric underneath. Cute, nice colors but only for one wear then they look trashed. No way they would survive the washing machine. I’ve had other snoozies that wash and wear great but this pair is a bad design/workmanship."
1.0,poor quality - broke the first day
1.0,Paratus is spelled wrong on the necklace. It’s missing the T.
1.0,"Had this for a few months, dropped it once on asphalt and the pin fell out.  Not as durable as claims made."
1.0,"These look nothing like the pictures, cheap material, unflattering"
1.0,"This is nothing like what the picture showed the arms are way too short, the way it is put together is off from side to side. I would not recommend!"
1.0,"the cotton is too thick, but, in all my searching I could not find a fine denier batiste........ this gown is made of a thick broadcloth type of fabric"
1.0,"I've bought several bracelets from Zen concepts, this one is incredibly small, will be returning."
1.0,I usually love Fly London’s. But these pinched my feet so bad that the tops of my feet swelled up terribly. They run very narrow in the front. And if you have narrow heels sling backs are not a good idea as the straps tend to fall down
1.0,this was not what it showed in the pictures.
1.0,Lost its color after wearing it for a few hours. Horrible quality
1.0,This product was not only poor quality but the in order to even try to wear this shirt you would have to have the torso of a child. The length between the top of the shirt and where your waist is supposed to go isn't long enough. I ordered a size bigger than I am and it is still way too short.
1.0,"Bought this after reading the reviews- I liked the cut of the dress, but the material is just awful- it was absolutely see through on me. I bought the 3x for me, and while it was nice and flowy, the neck line is INSANELY low and wide. I had hoped to be able to wear this outside of the halloween party i purchased it for, but that just won't be happening. Will be returning shortly."
1.0,The hat looks like it was under the rocks.  Completely flat
1.0,Not slouchy at all for an adult with an average head size.
1.0,"This just arrived on time but was extremely too small, arms were to tight, being made in another country, I guess they do not have any plus size women.  I'm just a size 14, won't shop here again, to hard to figure out sizes!"
1.0,It's bir on me. It doesn't look like Medium size which I have ordered. So better if u gonna buy somewhere in the and try it on you
1.0,Too small. Instead of comfortable memory foam it feels like standing on cardboard and egg crate foam.
1.0,Sleeves way Too small
1.0,Came defective. The design is chipping off and has red marks on it
1.0,"Title says “bracelets set” but there is only one bracelet per order. The beads are cheap and inconsistently sized. Ordered 5 “sets” expecting 10 for a birthday party favor. Will be returning. Definitely not worth $6 each. $3 sure, not $6."
1.0,Mine came ripped and it was a very poor fit otherwise.
1.0,Dye bleeds and stains your skin and clothes.
1.0,Fit length wise but too tight under arms and too big around the waist.
1.0,"problem with 3 of the watches. One the hands will not set, two won't work can open to change batteries.<br />Just opened to put kn mybraclets & the return date has passed by 6 days."
1.0,They are paper.  Don't like them.
1.0,Don't be fooled! This does not look like the picture. It's very cheap. I returned it.
1.0,Buckle only lasted a few months and broke
1.0,"Post says earrings (plural), but it's only one earring"
1.0,"Advertised as 100% cotton but is 60% cotton 40% poly. Does not have a 100% cotton face, so does not work very well for tie dyeing. It does have a decent fit bit runs a tad small."
1.0,Too big. Not feminine at all. The tie knot just falls in the wrong spot and it isn't the type of know you can un-do and re-do yourself.
1.0,"Even if you wear M and order XL, it won't fit. waste of money"
1.0,"If you are an adult don't bother to buy this tiny hat. It's cute but if you're an average size adult with or without hair, having an average sized head, forget about this hat.<br />Nice fabric and style, however."
1.0,"Turned my ankle green a couple days after wearing, and also turned colored itself."
1.0,Cheaply made. It's like someone had a yard of material and stitched it to make a skirt without even puttingit under a sewing machine. Its so tiny I can't pull it up past my thighs. Not to mention the Shipping cost more than the so called skirt. If you're that desperate for a dress buy a sewing machine becuase this is not worth it.
1.0,"The listing & description says “clickers”, as if multiple. It’s only one. Deceptive."
1.0,The reason I highly disliked this product is because first of all I thought I was meant to get the nice rose gold bracelet they describe and showed in pictures. Instead I had got some cheaply made bracelet with a plastic wanna be pearl only as a bracelet and I went to the amazon options or whatever and clicked the option of “not as pictured” or “not the right item” and they sent the product again and it said arriving Christmas Eve (today) and guess what i got the same little crappy thing which is really upsetting.
1.0,I want to return it for a larger size.
1.0,Returned. Thin material.
1.0,Color was nice but for petite women
1.0,Looks like this came out of the bubble gum machine.  I will give it to my granddaughter.
1.0,"Terribly small!  I got my sister a 4x and myself a 1x.  The 4x fits like a 1x, very disappointed.  However it is totally cute so I will be keeping the 4 x for me and returning the 1x...  What a waste of time and energy.  I will not be buying from this seller until they correct their sizes!!"
1.0,become black from the first use very poor quality
1.0,"The elastic waist on these pants is horrible!!! They look so bad. I ordered an extra large, because most things are smaller than expected but these seem to be true to size."
1.0,These are not leggings these are tights. I bought the 6 pack hoping to have a variety of colors to add to my wardrobe. Very disappointed when I put the on that they were completely see through.
1.0,"Way too small, I'm a 2x and that would fit a medium!"
1.0,The masks are falling apart just by being in my purse.
1.0,"Adorable, ordered a XX Large, might fit my 8 year old granddaughter. I’m not sure if they sent me a child’s size by mistake, but she will love it...certainly won’t fit me"
1.0,I ordered a 4-6. I didn’t look at size chart. They were actually more of size 12. I had to return them and I had no idea what size to order. So I didn’t!!!!
1.0,"HUGE disappointment!!  the gun rubs on the oval and the finish is gone--the disk broke off after only two weeks, and I have only worn it a few times!  I love the sentiment and wanted to wear it so much more...bad purchase."
1.0,It was terrible quality
1.0,These are total crap glasses. I thought they'd at least last a week or two but one was already broken when the box arrived and then it took about 5 mins before the thin plastic &#34;lenses&#34; were out. Would definitely advise against ordering these.
1.0,Way too big. We ordered 12mo and it was huge when we revieved it. It compared to some 2T clothes we have!
1.0,These eyeglass holders are absolutely awful.  I've gone through four holders in the last two weeks.  They last about three days before the top splits.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,"Wow is this thing garbage!!! The color is horrid, the graphics are horrid. It’s not as pictured. This company has some nerve charging $45 for this. DO NOT BUY."
1.0,It was too small. Not at all whaT it is shown in the picture.
1.0,"The pieces are not of quality whatever metal it is changes color rapidly ,"
1.0,No form to the max.  Junk
1.0,Easy to come off. I lost it only after 3 days
1.0,These were extremely short (size medium). Not at all what the measurements say on the size chart. Had to return.
1.0,The cut was nothing like shown in the pictures. Highly unsatisfied and disappointing.
1.0,"I ordered this and the cups are HUGE! So I guess if you are looking for a larger top, this is for you!"
1.0,This mask was huge for a 115 lb female
1.0,"I put on the leggings, went on a short walk and that’s it! They are already coming apart! And sadly I have two more from this company on the way. Will be returning all of them. Do not recommend"
1.0,Horrible purchase.  The quality is extremely poor.  The sweater ripped as soon as I slipped it over my head.  I would not buy this sweater... and if someone gave it to me.. i would literally throw it away... Do not buy this sweater.
1.0,"Really wanted to love this bag, but after just a few weeks there is a rip in the seam of the large compartment zipper. This is very disappointing. I was hoping to use this bag for a toddler and newborn when my new little one arrives this summer, but it couldn’t even hold up for a few weeks of light use. I should add we primarily only use the bag a few days a week because we don’t need it every day, so the ripped seam is extra disappointing. Pros of the bag are a nice gray color, with plenty of pockets, and the zippers seem to be good quality. I would not recommend this bag if you intend to fill it with all of the necessities as it doesn’t seem like it is built to hold up."
1.0,Would not pair with my phones.<br /> Pouch holding device fell apart before I could ever use. Returning for refund.
1.0,picture does not match product
1.0,The dress was so pretty. Slightly thin material but exactly how described in the picture and description. But the largest size didn't fit my chest area. So sad. Would deffintely buy again if larger sizes were available.
1.0,"Haven't worn this, because it just looks like an old table cloth. It looks great on the model, but doesn't translate in real life."
1.0,This anklet lasted all of 10 minutes before it fell apart. My daughter was sitting on the couch and it literally fell off of her ankle.  NEVER AGAIN!!
1.0,Junk. Poor quality.
1.0,I ordered this plus size dress because I was going on a cruise. I did not like it at all. The lace sleeves were tight and I look like a balloon in it! I am sending it back.
1.0,"The size is an inch off, smaller than stated, all the way around.  Terrible piece of JUNK!"
1.0,The zipper busted on the first use.
1.0,Faded very fast. Only got to wear it a couple of weeks.
1.0,"You get what you pay for, thankfully it was a clearance item.  It was so cheap I just donated as opposed to even dealing with returning it."
1.0,Wrong size for ZTE chronograph
1.0,The items were nice looking but the clasp on the cufflink broke the first time my son wore them to his senior prom.
1.0,This was broken when I got it.
1.0,"I am usually a large, this must’ve been a child size large because there is no way I could fit into it."
1.0,not what i thought.  would not buy this again. :-( too big and bulky.
1.0,Took 7 weeks to get and I received the wrong tshirt in a woman's size.
1.0,the worst it arrived broken
1.0,"Twice now from 2 different brands.  Yoga pants have no size tags on the actual pants.  Just a M on the package.  I am a size 6 and ordered a medium and pants are so small and tight.  They clearly put a unmarked small in a bag with a medium sticker on it.  Doesn't matter what you order, they just send whatever they have in stock."
1.0,Crooked embroidery.  Looks like no QC.
1.0,The pockets were sewn shut the strap in back wasn't sewn on.  Second item I've bought from coofandy and never getting another product from this company again
1.0,"No pockets (though some pictures seem to indicate that certain colors have pockets). Thin material. And the stitching started to come apart before I even wore it once!<br /><br />If you do buy, order a size up."
1.0,el dibujo es el mismo pero la tela decía que era gasa y es como seda. No es para la playa ese tipo de tela.
1.0,Fully diferenfe product photos...
1.0,Came folded up and the creases never went away. Made of very stiff vinyl.
1.0,"Just received it on thursday ;  me and my wife we are leaving for San-Francisco saturday for a 1 day dinner and a nice stay at the Westin on union-square,that necklace was part of # presents I'm gonna offering her during that 1 day trip....1 stone is missing!! I cannot believe it! I'm more than pissed."
1.0,This is more of a shirt not dress and I bought a size larger than I normally wear.  It is so tight!!!
1.0,The seams popped while I was still trying to get it in. Made of very cheap material.
1.0,I had to return these pants as they are much too thin. I ordered them in black and white. The white pants were transparent.
1.0,cheap and not worth the money at all.
1.0,Seams ripped on both gloves after a couple weeks of normal use.
1.0,I gave this as a gift which was only used a few times. The plastic melted and made holes on the bottom of the bag. The bag was taken on the beach and thrown in the garbage after. This bag was a huge disappointment .
1.0,"did not latch correctly, ended up falling off right away."
1.0,Actually the lenses are slightly larger in diameter than John's glasses were.  Lenses are to dark.  Just cheap-o crap. Don't bother
1.0,"So disappointed. A medium fit me like an extra large and I’m 2 weeks postpartum 150lbs. The breaking point is the fabric. Oh my, it’s horrible, “not silky” as other review states, it’s plastic!  Will not breath at all! Looks and feels cheap. Pattern  is cute, but again, looks really cheap printed on the fabric. Will be returning unfortunately:("
1.0,Product is as described but the mechanism that is supposed to light it up is made cheaply and it doesn’t light up. Very disappointed. It was a Birthday gift for my nephew.
1.0,"Fit great, super cute except the ruffles that continue on the back, not really into that"
1.0,Fit was fine but fell apart the first time I wore it. All the straw unraveled.
1.0,Delivery time misleading
1.0,They split in the crotch on about the 5th wear.  They fit perfectly. They were  super cute!  Thick enough not to show panty line ….  But they ripped and completely unraveled .  Bummer.
1.0,Horrible. More than half were bent. Others were too sharp to wear. I have purchased way better for way less money. Total waste.
1.0,"Flimsy, not as pictured."
1.0,poor condition
1.0,Am  a small= bought a med because of reviews- elestic waist is way to annoying and tight-Says soft- washed 3times- icky- scratchy- Not my kind of soft- would have returned but thought maybe washing would help--Total waste-
1.0,"Really nice idea and having a husband who works in the cold weather of Chicago, the bluetooth built into the hat was a great feature. Too bad it didn't even last a month. Not a crazy expensive product but for a month's wear definitely NOT worth the money. Also, it stopped working for no reason. It didn't get wet, didn't get dropped, etc."
1.0,Junk.  Screws fell out on both lenses after a few weeks.  Put them back in and tightened as much as a I could.  Lost the screws again.  Now it is garbage.  Cute but junk!
1.0,"Don’t do it , it’s so cheap unless you want it for a costume"
1.0,Only received empty package
1.0,Ordered an extra large 2X it barely fit .  Should list this as a non US size !
1.0,Breast hang to low no support
1.0,"Ugh.  These are so cheap and junky.  The fabric is ridiculously thin, and the stitching is fraying.  The bands are worthless. Maybe i can use them in some sort of craft, or to keep things organized and grouped together.  They can't be used for hair.  AND, each is individually wrapped, with a piece of cardboard in the middle of the headband, to make them appear sturdy and high quality.  There's more waste in packaging than anything.  If this set were 2 bucks, it would still be a rip off.  Keep looking.  Don't pick these.  Just awful."
1.0,Not what I expected to big material feels cheap
1.0,None of these worked! I bought two sets n not one worked!!! No stars would be a better rating and the seller has not responded to my email sent 3 days ago.
1.0,"I bought this in June 2016 and it started making a squeaking sound in October. Now at the end of November, it stops and makes a loud sound. Would not buy again"
1.0,Material and construction are horrible. Might work for a costume or something.
1.0,"The belt looked good and I got it very quickly. However after about 2 months use the buckle has detached from the main part of the belt. Unfortunately the return window has already closed. I may have got a lemon, I am not sure."
1.0,To tight on the chest. Not cute
1.0,"This was such a rip off!!! This necklace is light and chintzy and I wouldn't pay more than $15 for it. Sadly, I was in a rush and ordered it to wear for an event the day after I received it so I didn't have time to find something else and return it. I thought for $90 it would be made of a nice heavy material and of somewhat good quality. I've seen children's play jewelry that is much nicer."
1.0,They were pretty but My daughter lost one the first day. thought they are screw backs and they were not.
1.0,Difficulty installing...The part that connects to the watch would not fasten like all my other scrunchie style wrist bands. No one could get any of them to stay fastened to my watch. NOT user friendly.
1.0,Not for me! Hard to get in and just didn’t look pleasing to the eye in my opinion.
1.0,I loved the color and style just wish it was made for plus size gals. I’m a size 18 plus and the biggest size didn’t fit. Excellent & friendly customer service though :)
1.0,Shipper did not send the product in the picture. It was not as described. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
1.0,Both the hug hands broke when I put them on. Threw them in the trash. No way are they stainless steel. Junk. You get what you pay for. I paid hardly nothing and I got nothing.  Sorry I have never had a ring just snap in half. Complete waste of money. Broke when I put them on my finger.
1.0,If I could give this a zero star I would. Not even 5 minutes of my husband wearing this the chain broke on the cape. Within and hour of trick or treating with our kids I look over and I said look at all the chains on the shirt they had all fallen off along with 2 of the buttons so not even 2 hours of wearing this costume all of the chains had fallen off I had  to use a big paper clip to keep his chain across his cape. Of course I am out of the returning window so this is a loss for me but I would highly recommend not purchasing this costume terrible quality.I am so disappointed.
1.0,"I bought this biggie earring and got it on Jan 5, little disappointed how it look in real .. no spark at all on earrings , clasp is broke within a month I wore . I’m not recommended buying this"
1.0,"Looks nice but Not good quality. Lens is not magnetic mechanism, easily falls off. Had to return it."
1.0,"I didn’t receive the shape I ordered, and they were too big, bulky, and heavy to wear. I’m going to take them apart and use them to make my own custom jewelry instead."
1.0,I got a medium and I could barely fit it over my arms!!! The sizing is way off!! I usually wear a medium in women's and large in juniors.
1.0,"I ordered a large, it fits like a small/medium."
1.0,Really not what I expected. I thought that the rubber would have been softer
1.0,"The compression is the opposite of what it should be.  I found them to be very tight at the knee and the compression decreased going down.  That essentially creates a tourniquet, increasing swelling.  I returned them."
1.0,One of the backs would not stay screwed on. It seemed as though it was almost stripped.
1.0,"Looks like the dress in the pictures but not the material. It’s a silky, see through material like a night gown. I will be returning it."
1.0,This looked absolutely NOTHING like the picture. I am medium build and wear between a small and medium. I bought the medium expecting it to fit comfortably. This fit like a glove... In the worst way possible
1.0,XXL RAN SMALL
1.0,The white color is strange and shows thru shirts. Not a quality product.
1.0,"I got a 3x which is my usual size and i swear it was so tight that i could hear threads popping loose when trying to put it on!  The words looked like that board in the doctor's office that you have to read to get your eyes checked.  That's how tight it was!  To be on the safe side, size up!  A little bigger is always better to work With!"
1.0,I wish I had read the reviews first. I bought these to go over my prescription glasses. They fit very awkwardly and don’t even like to stay on. The clip also pushes against my forehead right above my nose and pushes them out from my face. So I have not used them and don’t plan to use them because they are way too awkward. I’m sorry I bought them.
1.0,"To start I will say they are warm. But they touch pads on the thumbs and index fingers DO NOT work. They not only failed on my phone and roommates phone but the tablet also didn't register and attempt to touch it. They are also very bulky and the pinky wasn't stitched right or something because I couldn't get it to line up with the hole in the internal fabric making it very uncomfortable. I had bought these for riding my motorcycle and as soon as I opened up the package and tried them out, I came here to get a refund and write a review. Again I will say they are warm and the fabrics seem decent but the material for the touch are lacking and the stitching inside honestly almost seems rushed."
1.0,It was MUCH larger than I expected.
1.0,Bought this for a Halloween costume and received in a very timely manner.  When I opened box this must be for a child although it is not advertised as such.  It is useless to me.  Wasted money.
1.0,"When it arrived (extremely early, good thing) and i opened the package, i noticed all the bubbles in the bubble wrap it came in had been smashed (bad thing). Opened it up further to reveal the earring itself was bent, the back was gone and the first time i put it on it broke in half. Not worth it."
1.0,Color is not as good as picture. Runs large. Cheap material.
1.0,Trash. Shrank to like half their size after washing and drying... bummed i can't return them.
1.0,"So flimsy, bands around hard to attach, no support at all."
1.0,The pants are girls and does not look like the photo in person. Don’t buy this.
1.0,"Very tarnished after 2 wears of the gold bracelet, haven’t wore the silver yet."
1.0,"I purchased the black dress with the x on the chest and droop sleeves...<br />-the cut of the actual dress is uneven making for an awkward fit<br /> -the fabric is absolutely terrible, itchy and cheaper than most bargain bin clearance Walmart pieces<br />-this does not qualify as a dress if you are not super small...when creating larger than medium sizing the company neglected to add any length to the added width of the garment which leaves more than you'd want revealed for all to see.<br />It's honestly so awkward and uncomfortable I'm giving it to my ferrets to use as throw away bedding. Complete garbage."
1.0,"Hat arrived quickly, box intact, hat flat as a pancake. Managed to reshape it, but there are still signs of damage. No stetson pin, just a blank spot in the leather headband where a Stetson pin should be. Very disappointing, as it is, if it had shipped without being damaged, would have been a great hat, now it’s just a good hat."
1.0,Nunca recibí el pedido por favor su ayuda
1.0,Es muy transparente. Por eso no me gustó.
1.0,"Compré dos, el negro vino bien, S, pero el lila vino M, le queda grande a mi esposa, como podríamos solucionar"
1.0,"Color is great, fits small. Company sent the wrong size but was quick to refund my money, didn’t offer anything else."
1.0,I feel like these socks make my feet sweat even more.
1.0,very cheap.....if this is military grade we will always lose!!!!
1.0,"Terrible!  Extremely wrinkled.  Huge and very boxy.  Sewn very poorly.  Sleeves  are tight, especially at cuff. Very poor quality and no shape!"
1.0,"Bought a women's medium, would be lucky if these fit a 10 year old child. So tiny"
1.0,"Came extremely wrinkled.  Washed and dried on delicate setting, shrunk so much it now does not fit.  Comes out of dryer wrinkled so would need to be ironed.  No thank you.  A waste of money.  Sending on to Goodwill."
1.0,"No era la talla , enviaron S yo compré M"
1.0,not the color in the picture...sent back
1.0,5’9 210 pounds usually a size Large but these don’t even go up my thigh!
1.0,It’s not a peach color. It’s bright baby pink.
1.0,The backs slide off to easy
1.0,Did not like quality. Lining is looser than mask.  I am embroidering on the edge for a team avoiding slot for filter. Side seams are often not straight. Could not use side seams as a guide. Will not order again.
1.0,"The band is not construction well, my Fitbit Sense & the band separated & flew off my wrist .<br /><br />The clip attachment portion of the band broke off.  Looked thin & brittle."
1.0,"Too big, no shape, felt unattractive."
1.0,Changing my review because although the watch looks beautiful it did not take long for the spring winding mechanism to stop working. I've always been careful not to over tension the spring but it doesnt seem to work for more than an hour now regardless if I'm wearing the watch or not.
1.0,"The band was as expected, but after 2 days of wearing it, I had a reaction to what ever the metal<br />(Or material) on the clasp was (I have never had a reaction to anything ever before. I do not have sensitive skin). Would not advise putting this on your skin."
1.0,"style was is great, hence the purchase, but holy moly is it uncomfortable on your nose. NO support there and leaves very visible (and painful) indents on the nose. You can feel the poor quality. I wish these were comfortable bc they're so cute! But absolutely not."
1.0,"Description says they are snapback, they are not. They have a strap which is adjustable and a clip. Please correct the Description to reflect actual product."
1.0,"Product was not in package, so it can’t be returned. I was anxious to wear these sterling paperclip earrings. Too bad!"
1.0,"I bought this for my cat loving daughter in law.  It arrived in a nice box.  When I opened it I really thought that  the cat pendant was missing from the chain.  NOOOO...... the cat was so miniscule that it was difficult to see.  I am not kidding.  Teeny, tiny,  hard to even see!!!!"
1.0,Knock offs. They are cute because the pattern is the same as stances pattern but these are not stance sock. They are thin and cheap. Won’t buy again
1.0,it fell apart the day I opened it!!!!
1.0,Not appropriate to wear out of the house or in front of your family unless that’s your thing. Had to return it.
1.0,I put them into my pocket and with very small impact - glasses broke :( Too bad because they look awesome
1.0,It is cheap.
1.0,It's genuine plastic. Pretty uncomfortable too.
1.0,"These are the worst pants I've ever owned. If I could rate them negative stars, I would. Nothing like shopping and noticing that you have a massive gaping hole in your crotch area! AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE WORN THEM.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend you do not buy these. They are cheaply made and not good quality whatsoever.<br /><br />Additionally, I'm 5'8 and both the XL and XXL are way too long... too much fabric to even roll up!!!!"
1.0,"size is very small, want to return it"
1.0,Horribly stitched together waste of money! Cheaply made!!
1.0,Runs like children’s sizes
1.0,It is broken! Never used.
1.0,I bought this as an add on item for my husband. When I got them in the mail today the box clearly states that they are girl's socks. They are very thin and in no way would fit my husband. Very disappointing!
1.0,What size is this sweatshirt?! There are no sizes to choose from and I’m looking for an adult medium
1.0,Not happy with the order.<br />Order didn't not get on time it was late and the price is high for the lil bag.I can get the same else where for $3.00 never again will I order again.
1.0,This product is crap and poorly made. Do not buy. Broke after 2 weeks.
1.0,The sizing is not good. Medium looks big and small looks too small. I got it small size but the shipping back cost was much so I have to kinda keep it. But not happy with the product
1.0,It is a useless piece of garbage. I am amazed at the reviews that actually are positive. It does not fit a Charge 4 Fitbit and nobody really knows what it actually fits or if it fits anything.
1.0,Unfortunately size was too small. I got a medium.
1.0,I have very sensitive ears i can only wear stainless steel or sterling silver or real gold. These said that they were stainless steel; they are not or maybe my ears do not know what they want because they made my earlobes itchy and they swell up. Do not buy if you are very sensitive to certain metals.
1.0,They are not 14/16 do not  buying should have read reviews !
1.0,"Does not resemble the photo. Hood is smaller, pockets are different and fit is small. Returned."
1.0,3 reasons why. You should not buy!<br /> 1.They are way to long!<br />2.Stones are falling off<br />3. are made out cheap metal<br />That made nose piercing get infected<br /> Just please save yourself the trouble& spend a little more .
1.0,Es muy pequeña
1.0,"After just 1 month 2 part of the shorts came apart at the seam. I'm super upset, as to I'm unable to return."
1.0,I would not give this to any one cheap cheap very disappointed will never order from them every again
1.0,"I really wanted this bra but its just like all other strapless bras no support as claimed, bugles at the sides and the strap. It also came with the cups all folder in and couldnt get them flatened out. The card i used is no longer valid and i cant contact anyone to say this. The only refunds are get a new one or the card used. Just refunding to amazon account would be nice. Now im stuck with a non functional bra i will never enjoy. I do not recommend this product. :-("
1.0,"Very good design,but the connection is really bad. After used for couple days. The liquor is all over the area, didnt saw it till checking the machine,took so long to clean the concentrate liquor.<br />fortunately not pets, or you will regret to use this."
1.0,"Ring is very cheap looking, sending it back."
1.0,Not WOMENS.  the leggings are cute.  But the fit is for a five foot 90 pound girl. Had to send back. Would love love my size
1.0,"Despite what the description says, the measurements of this bag when folded once are:<br /><br />23 width X 21.5 inches tall. The thickness would be whatever you put in it."
1.0,"I dislike this item because your true size isn’t right,to tight,Would not buy this item again."
1.0,Cuts of circulation at knee. Painful to wear. Too long also
1.0,This is not a dress only an owl t shirt. No skirt or belt comes with it. I am returning.
1.0,I ordered a color gold and the color that arrived is COMPLETLY different as the one shown in the photos. It fits right but they should review what they are presenting vs what they really have.
1.0,"I don't know what I expected for less than $10, but this thing is cheap cheap cheap. The main bag has loose threads, smells like chemicals, and is super flimsy. The inner bag is a cheap burlap material. I'm only keeping it because it's not worth the trouble to return."
1.0,Product was not as descriptions material was way off
1.0,The charm broke off after one day
1.0,These leggings are pretty see-through if you have thicker thighs...
1.0,Trash  thin don't waste your money I paid 18 dollars  for the chicago bears  it wasn't even bears colors 😭🥴🤭😫
1.0,"quick clasp on this strap was extra bulky. I've had other silicone versions from this brand with no issues. Had my fenix 5 with no issues for 3+years. While golfing the other week, after following through my swing, pin broke off of watch and was no longer secure. Garmin does not do repairs, and because I am out of warranty I was forced to replace my watch for $170. Not worth the risk using this strap if the end result is a broken watch."
1.0,"Firstly, these earrings are *much* too large and too heavy. Moreover, the idea behind them doesn't work at all. Since only one side of the earrings has the red/black design, it is the plain gold back side that is primarily visible when viewed from the left or right side of your face. Maybe the angling of my ears is significantly different from others? It seems like the designers never tried them out on an actual person. I previously bought a necklace from this brand which I liked, but this purchase was a disappointment."
1.0,This was not made for a real person. Arms were tiny and not seen on correctly. None of the seams were correct
1.0,"I really liked the looks of it, but it was way too small.  I took it to work with me to see if it would fit anyone there and no luck.  One lady took it for her little preschooler."
1.0,Material was very cheap and flimsy. Too large if you’re petite.
1.0,The shield is not rigid but a flimsy plastic and will not retain shape. It was a waste of money.
1.0,Don't buy this product it is entirely to damn small a 4x feels like a Xtra small the sizing is wayy off if you wear a md or lg you better get  5x it it still may be to small
1.0,I’m a size 8/10 and a 36b and I ordered a large the top was too large and the pants were tight and had no compression . Not suitable for working out. The white is completely sheer
1.0,Disappointed delivery item was damaged
1.0,"Bad, bad. The don’t have size for big men."
1.0,"I Purchased to use while hiking, cycling, running. I just opened and used in the rain and got Drenched! NOT at all waterproof. I'd really like a refund."
1.0,Cute but you only get one necklace. All the images at the time I made the purchase was of 2 necklaces. So of course I expected 2.
1.0,Very uncomfotable to wear out of the packaging. It doesn't look good under thinner sweaters because you can see whe the faux shirt ends and it bunches up. Also the straps are very uncomfortable.
1.0,"Back of the disc isn’t smooth, has bumps!"
1.0,Loved the bright colors of the among us characters but when you stretched it over the foot and leg it faded the image way too much. Bought for 13 year old boy and they barely fit and the faded look was horrible and they were tight. My 7 year old daughter tried them and it still faded but the size was closer to fitting her. Would not recommend.
1.0,These are granny leggings!  They have the awkward elastic ring across the waistband.  :(<br />If you have an ounce of jiggle in the tummy area you are going to look like a stack of donuts.  I do NOT reccomend these.<br /><br />Lucky for me (insert sarcasm) I bought 4 PAIRS!<br />#stupid
1.0,One of the hats lights didn't work.
1.0,I ordered the size I always wear but it runs small. So have not worn it. So sad....
1.0,Not good quality. Nose bridge does not even snap. Returned.
1.0,I only got 1 belt
1.0,Too hard to get on.
1.0,I didn’t like these earrings because the post became black in my daughters ears.
1.0,"After only a few days, the clasp obviously broke and I have not seen it since."
1.0,Did not fit like description
1.0,Very pretty dress for a tall person and slender
1.0,El vestido está descocido. Mala compra
1.0,Hat for a Barbie doll! Terrible!!
1.0,One of the two sides broke when sliding into the watch. The opposite side of the magnet has a small piece of plastic that ripped off and made it loose enough to slide out.
1.0,Runs small. Not the quality they make it appear. It’s only one hat as well. Not worth the price.
1.0,no warm
1.0,Much larger than Ray bans aviators. Way to big for my face both the lens and width.
1.0,This was so tiny u could barely tell what it was. The middle stones were missing and the chain was so tangled you couldn't get it apart. Total rip off for the money!
1.0,"THE WATCH IN THE PICTURE IS NOT THE WATCH SHIPPED.<br /><br />And the update? The second hand has decided to disconnect completely and has taken to simply flopping around in the case. Review reduces to 1 star appropriately. I didn't even wear it before the second hand jumped off.<br /><br />Let's begin with a reality check here. You've seen the price, at that price you can't expect much, especially when you consider that Tourbillon watches generally have prices at least a couple digits longer.<br /><br />First, not a Tourbillon. It has an exposed balance wheel, but not a Tourbillon. A Tourbillon requires extra complication with the entire balance wheel apparatus rotating in a circle to equalize the effects of gravity. The exposed balance wheel is very attractive at this price point. The picture shows dial demarcations for a Tourbillon, but the shipped version lacks the complication, and also lacks the evidence on the dial.<br /><br />Not a chronometer. Others have commented about it not doing a good job keeping time, losing/gaining several minutes a day, these are generally correct. There is no stamp saying the balance wheel was adjusted, and it probably was only adjusted in one position, the minimum in order to make it work.<br /><br />The balance wheel has a narrow rotation. Most high accuracy chronometers the balance wheel rotates in excess of 300 degrees. This balance wheel looks to rotate around 90 degrees. As a result the movement probably is not capable of being calibrated to chronometer accuracy anyway.<br /><br />It is an automatic. That means that as you wear it, it winds itself. If you take it off, then the winding stops.<br /><br />It has a small power reserve. The power reserve is how long a watch will run without winding (or in this case self-winding as you wear it), this seems to be only a few hours, it will often die overnight.<br /><br />Time is easily set. The crown is stiff and assertive when pulled out to set the time. My fingers cleanly and firmly grasp the crown.<br /><br />The chronograph complication (stopwatch) isn't. While the watch has the buttons for chronograph function, the chronograph function itself does not appear to work in any perceivable way. Pressing the reset button did move one of the subdials some amount, but did not perform anything resembling a reset.<br /><br />Now the looks.<br /><br />The face shown in the picture is black, the shipped one is blue. As much as that is not what I ordered, I actually rather like the blue finish.<br /><br />The &#34;Gold&#34; looks more brass, or copper to me. The picture shows fairly accurately the color.<br /><br />The finish that isn't. The picture shows a polish finish to the cage. The shipped version is more satin finish. There is also a finish contrast between the majority of the cage (stainless steel) and the upper ring (copper/gold). The steel is a much higher polish. To me this actually makes the copper ring pop a lot more than the picture which just looks uniform shiny.<br /><br />The strap. The picture is largely correct, it looks like stamped leather, the shipped product is stamped leather. The strap quality looks low in the picture, the shipped product strap is low quality. The picture looks (poorly) hand stitched, the shipped product is clearly machine stitched. The stamp alignment changes substantially from picture to product. The picture has an interesting 3 part to 2 part stamp change near the cage, the shipped version has a simpler 2 part stamp, and on the clasp side of the strap it looks like the stamp was misaligned. It isn't ugly, but it is not a high quality strap.<br /><br />Overall, the product shipped looks better to my eye than the picture, but the complete lack of the Tourbillon complication that is the reason I originally bought this one really ruins the experience.<br /><br />In short it is definitely not a high end watch, but at this price you shouldn't expect one. I've switched my review between two and three stars repeatedly while I've been writing this. I've decided to leave it at 3 because I am keeping the watch."
1.0,Nice ! But they got rusty wearing it one night
1.0,Looks great wore it 5 hours and band broke. I would shop different options before this watch. Don’t make mistake I did spend the extra money for a better quality.
1.0,Bad quality turned colors with in weeks for what I paid it should not have turned thank but no thanks
1.0,spokes came eye posing a risk of eye injury to my child. cheap and nasty!
1.0,"The quality id horrible, it looks like a one dollar dress, just awful"
1.0,"FYI- These have 2 holes for jump rings, not one as shown. Will not work for my projects. Unfortunately I have another pkg coming in a couple of days. Disappointed."
1.0,Product description extremely misleading.  Only received 1 of 9 charms.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Missing the closure pin. Watch is now useless
1.0,Dress colour started to run
1.0,"poor quality of fabric , longer than stated .pockets too low on sides"
1.0,"Very cheaply made. Fur just comes off, need to use a belt no strap attached and looks very ratty"
1.0,"I love the look of this skirt, but when I first got it, and tried it on, I could not even get it over my thighs, I ordered an XL (usually a L) because I saw some reviews that the skirt was a little small! My advice is to size up a few sizes if you want to be able to put it on and not be suffocating!"
1.0,It said sweat shirt it is silk and I don't like them at all
1.0,"I don’t like the material, it feels too cheap for what I bought."
1.0,"Yeah, I should have paid attention to the measurements but in the same picture is the word &#34;adjustable&#34;. I ordered this because I like the printing on the outside. I had ordered another from another company that has the printing on the inside. That one came in a gift box. This one, though more expensive, comes in a bag. I had trouble trying it on and had a heck of a time getting it off, and my wrist is not fat. I finally pulled hard, scraping skin. No way I can give this as a gift, sending it back. If it was bigger, in a box, it would be real nice."
1.0,These shoes didn't last two trips to the pool.  The front of one totally split in two and the sole of the other one came out.  Definitely will not be buying these again.
1.0,The worst. You’ll be lucky if you can get these out of the package before they start unraveling.
1.0,This dress is def not worth the money!  The bodice doesn't cover the bosom under the arms well.  The interfacing curls up and hangs out at the top front and back.  If you are a small breasted woman this dress is a 20 dollar garment at best.  Mine is going to Good Will.
1.0,Looks and feels very cheap in person. I returned it and definitely wouldn’t order again.
1.0,This short is not pink as depicted in the picture! It’s orange-pink
1.0,I wanted a full length dress more like a lounger
1.0,"Very disappointed in these sneakers.  I have bought Tony Little ""Cheeks"" sneakers in the past and love them.  This is my third pair, and I hardly used them and soles became unglued.  Would not recommend them."
1.0,The anklets are cute but weak.  The first time i wore it it broke and fell off my ankle.
1.0,Sized up and still too small
1.0,Fabric not good
1.0,HAD TO RETURN....WAS SKIN TIGHT....
1.0,This dress fits like I stole it out of my grandmothers closet - definitely returning it
1.0,Way too small and ordered up to begin with.
1.0,100's don't fit into the suitcase  it squishes them
1.0,Horrible foggy and waste of money
1.0,Returned immediately.  These are not what you think of when you read “buttery soft”. They are what you think of when you read “cheap nylon”.
1.0,Fits like a diaper
1.0,The ring broke as soon as I put it on and the earrings are too thick to fit thru my earring holes.
1.0,Not a real crystal
1.0,"I bought it because it was on deal, but the quality is really cheap that you can't even wear at home. The fitting is weird too. I will not recommend to anyone. I am going to return it."
1.0,The back was way to thick I ended up having to redo the back with my Own jewelry
1.0,"So I poured water on this and it didn't stay dry. But then I realized it was wet and I couldn't put it on, because then it wouldn't fit. I don't understand this concept. Is it dry-fit only, or can I wear it if it's wet. Asking for a friend who gets very sweaty. 5 stars because I'm loyal to the game. #JustDoIt"
1.0,"Very disappointed.  I have bought many necklaces from this seller and never had a problem until I received this necklace.  Very poor construction and it broke in half the very first day I tried to wear it.  For the price, not worth the hassle of returning it for another.  I did see the other reviewers stating negative comments about this necklace but as I had never had an issue with the many others I had purchased from seller I ignored them.  Won't do that again."
1.0,"I’m rather on the fence with these, the colors and fabric isn’t bad, they’re just WAY too puffy"
1.0,Very cheaply made. Started to unravel after first wash. Never wore it. Threw it away.
1.0,Not a good product very poor quality
1.0,It broke the very next day.. I gave it to my daughter for her birthday and 5 mins after she put it on it was already broken
1.0,Too big for my 10 yrs daughter ok look old fashion
1.0,"Do not work, especially for older women, it folds and doesn't hold."
1.0,Doesn't fit the phone right on one end. Do we don't use it.
1.0,It fits okay on my face but it fogs up everytime I wear it.
1.0,"The sizing on these are way off.  I wear a 2x in everything I purchase from Amazon, QVC etc.  These were too small by a mile.  I would say they are an extra large."
1.0,these things are gigantic! Way too big. It fit my 40 lb child like a dress...
1.0,The color isn’t as bright as shown on the pic
1.0,This product is no good..<br />Apparently they took a white tshirt and dye it..After one wash all the blue dye wash out..plus the quality of material is cheap and bad
1.0,"These arrived in excellent time, but that’s the only good thing about this purchase. These shoes STINK, literally. They have a very strong chemical smell that about knocked me out upon opening, but I could probably handle that once they were able to air out for a very long time and cure. Maybe. However, they run very small and narrow. I wear size 8 (US) and medium to wide width which is what I ordered but these fit more like a 7 and narrow width. I don’t think ordering a larger size would help much for width because once you got the right width the shoe would be 2-3 sizes too long. For example, I tried them on my 12 year old daughter (whom has very slender feet) and the width was perfect but the shoes were too long by nearly a full inch. She normally wears a size 4. I will definitely have to return but will now be out the shipping cost to return them. Extremely disappointing."
1.0,Not happy with this purchase.
1.0,"Ho hum.  I am the ass who gave a diaper bag with a broken zipper to an expectant mom who politely shrugged it of as ""it's OK"".<br />What a bummer.<br />Apparently does not seem to be well-made."
1.0,This item arrived half full with no signs of spillage.  It was very disappointing.  I will be contacting Amazon for a refund.
1.0,It's sort of cheap looking.  And it ran really small.
1.0,"One pair came with hole in the crotch and they run small.  I would not say they were one size fits all, they did not fit my size 16."
1.0,Words on hat came upside down
1.0,"Horrible! Paper thin, cheap and too big. This dress went back immediately.  It looked sad, sad, sad! Don't waste your money or your time waiting for this junk"
1.0,It was entirely too small
1.0,Very cute but didn’t hold. The wires detach from the metal on the first wear
1.0,Medium is very small
1.0,Runs really small.. Ordered a medium for my 11 year old and they fit my 7 year old.
1.0,Doesn’t do what it’s supposed to!
1.0,"This bracelet is heavy, bulky, hard to wear and hard to put on. It is not comfortable to wear and hits everything it comes close to. My husband had to struggle to put it on my wrist..<br />I bought it and will not wear it."
1.0,"I ordered this dress in blue for my daughter for Halloween. She wants to be peacock and I was looking for a blue dress that is not just for halloween but could be worn afterwards. I just returned it! The quality is very cheap and tulle is rough. Also, the blue color of the top and the skirt are so different tones of blue that it looks awkward. I would rather buy a halloween dress."
1.0,"It is cute, but the fabric, although very soft, is too lightweight and provides no warmth at all. The only use for this would be to cover a camisole top or spaghetti strap dress, so that it could be used for work or a more conservative environment. I had purchased to wear over a spaghetti strap dress for evening outdoor concert.  I consider this useless and will be returning."
1.0,I usually wear L sized everything. Bought an XL here thinking I'd appreciate the extra slack to complete the look. Robe is too small in an XL AND is not as long as picture shows.
1.0,Were broken when I got them.
1.0,Didn’t realize ihad purchased them. Threw them away. So cheap I thought they were free
1.0,Product description is wrong. It is not genuine leather.
1.0,A sticky mess....don't do it. It's like those sticky toys that you throw and it sticks to the wall. Hurt my skin as I ripped it off...I'll &#34;stick&#34; with a regular strapless bra.
1.0,Product is good quality but runs very small
1.0,It doesn't work. Very uncomfortable and painful in arch . You can see a gap between Arch and heel. Waste money.
1.0,"my husband wears 2x in all his shirts, this one fits like a large.  COULD NOT WEAR IT, WAY TOO SMALL"
1.0,"Our daughter has used this backpack for less than 1 month for Volleyball and the zippers have not held up. Both side compartment zippers have failed and can not be fixed. This is unacceptable for the light use that this pack has received in a short time. She does not keep a ball or anything bulky in the bag. I would not recommend this product. Pay a few extra dollars and buy Adidas, Under Amour, Champion, etc.... This is what we should have done in the first place. We would have saved money that way."
1.0,No quiero volver a comprar este producto es de muy mala calidad
1.0,These socks do not warm up as described in their ad.  Since it has not been too cold I did not have a chance to wear them before the 30 day return policy now I am stuck with something that does not work.  Would not recommend these at all.
1.0,"Seriously way too short! I am so upset! This was suppose to be a long sweater, but this seriously reach just past my dang belly button! It looks AWFUL!!!!!!!! Do they honestly not do any quality control on their products?!"
1.0,The ad states that it’s clip on jewelry. It’s clearly the opposite. The earrings that arrived were for pierced ears. A terrible misrepresentation of the product.
1.0,It's supposed to be a 2X and it looks like a medium it runs really really small if your big chested don't even bother with this product this product should say that it runs small so people don't waste their money I am not satisfied with this product
1.0,"The second time my daughter wore them, they completely ripped open at the toe."
1.0,Big Hole in Back .I will return
1.0,These pants were made from a completely flimsy material.  Not the material shown in the picture.  The pants in fact were complete junk and I can't use them at all.  This was false advertising.  DO NOT BUY.  This is a scam and not worth five dollars on a clearance rack.  I got totally cheated.  I'll never buy from this seller again.  Can't trust any of their descriptions now.  Absolutely aweful.
1.0,There is a warning on the box about allergic reactions. I had one when I used these gloves.
1.0,Wish I could comment on how it felt around my wrist but I couldn't even attach the pins. They are too short and thin for the thickness of the band and don't actually fit completely through the holes.
1.0,It is too big and the material is quality material material.i will return it
1.0,"I ordered brown, but recieved a tan/caramel color. Poorly made, it was vacuum sealed when i recieved it but it never puffed out also has loose threading. Very disappointed in the overall product."
1.0,This top hugs in all the wrong places like a spandex type feeling the ruffle is was shorter than pictured
1.0,"So i bought my regular size medium, got it no problem but too small. Reordered size large, got it , its even SMALLER than size medium! What the heck!"
1.0,"I read all the reviews before I purchased this dress.  Ordered the xl expecting it to be big because most people said order a size down because the dress was big.  I couldn't get my arms thru the top!  I was super sad because this dress is perfect otherwise.  Lovely fabric, nice flow, but just way too small."
1.0,Dress did not fit as described.  There wasn't enough room in the underarm area. It rubbed and irritated my skin.  Dress was a waste of money
1.0,Terrible - more like a child’s toy ring
1.0,Broke after wearing one day. Wasn't expecting much from something that's .99 cents however would have been nice to last a week
1.0,These gloves are so thin you could read through them.  I should have read the one star reviews because they are right on.  The product is nothing like the picture.  There are no seams on the back side of the hand.  What a disappointment.  I should have gone to the dollar store and probably would have found something of higher quality there!
1.0,Lace basically fell apart during the first time it was worn. My daughter wore this for our family pictures and the lace was pulling apart within the first 1/2 hour of our session.
1.0,It's not the size what they said it is...size runs much smaller too tight
1.0,"I liked the size and the color.  However, it arrived with two stains on the side and the bag had an unpleasant odor. This purchase was a waste of my money."
1.0,This dress isn’t flattering on my plus size body type. Not high quality material.
1.0,Great if it's dry and warm out . Uncomfortable to wear .
1.0,Bottom wiring broke after first use. Had to throw it.
1.0,I donot like is very bad
1.0,Material is see through. I got a size up for looser fit but it fits small. Disappointed with this purchase!
1.0,"Flimsy and not what I expected.  Mine was sewn down on the sides so I expect, depending on who is doing the sewing, or who it is being pieced out to, it is slightly different each time.  I purchased another kimono the same day, from another vendor and was VERY happy."
1.0,Ordered an XL as I like them big.....my size 8 friend couldn’t even get them on.
1.0,"I wish I could give zero stars. Horrible quality and the color does not match the pink that is advertised. It fits like a cheap and loose t-shirt, not like a off shoulder shirt like it is shown."
1.0,"it took a month to receive this damn item.<br />I was traveling out of country,and i purchased this watch so that i could give to someone as a gift. and the damn watch didn't come on time like they told me to."
1.0,Runs significantly small and the sleeves have a weird fit.  Material is very thin and does not hold shape.
1.0,"This swimsuit arrived on time and was in a sealed package. I pulled out the swim bottoms first and immediately saw that they had been worn/tried on without underware on. There are multiple HAIRS inside the bottoms!! I looked at the top and inside the top there are multiple HAIRS!! I don’t know what disgusted me more, that someone did this and didn’t even clean it or that it was obviously received and repacked by an employee. I am so disappointed and disgusted!!"
1.0,Cheap material that wrinkles easily. Will not order again. Probably best for smaller women who are below a 36C.
1.0,Was broken on arrival. Too long let's sweaters gap too much
1.0,"The fasteners keep coming loose. I’ve lost one of the ear rings twice but thank goodness someone found them each time. Going to take to a jeweler today to see if they can be fixed. If not, I will be returning them. I would have given them a 5 except for the fasteners issue ."
1.0,"This isn't actually a biohazard symbol - this is upside down, and generally considered an image of the three crescent moons common in goddess imagery.<br /><br />An actual biohazard symbol has one crescent facing straight up. Sadly, while this is a great necklace, it isn't a biohazard."
1.0,"I ordered the wooden watch that says from mom and gave it to my son as a gift. When he opened it and read it, it says from dad.  I can’t find a way to contact the seller."
1.0,What was supposed to be a 3X could have fit a child
1.0,it doesn't look the same on the picture. it looks like a bronze and really cheap. I thought of returning but I really don't want to have those hassles.
1.0,Loved the product but arms are tight
1.0,Was not at all impressed. It was like cheap iron on. Will come off after a few washings.
1.0,"use the lights once, charged once used again and tried to charge again and they stopped working (first week) (1 wouldn't charge and 1 wires broken).  The next week the top grommets separated from the fabric and the the ports (to charge) fell off.  This was with very little use on a small 5 year old.<br /><br />shoe soles seem nice, and with better button/charging port could be great.<br /><br />The upper fabric area is very cheap and cant tighten up nicely (like most tennis shoes)<br /><br />I'd suggest getting 'stomp lights' as my son suggests vs these until the design is different.  The usb connector just hangs out and is easily damaged<br /><br />Will be really cool when they get this to work."
1.0,"These fit great and looked cute. I wore them twice and they fell apart. To late to return, so disappointed."
1.0,Doesn't look like the picture at all. Very poor quality. Size is much smaller than shown.
1.0,This costume was cheap so thats the positive thing about it.  The negatives are that it is cheap. The mask is unusable because the way they package it causes it to be wrinkled and not spherical.  The mask is also hot and hard to hear in.
1.0,"Way too small, fits a 8 year old child."
1.0,"I was in love with these sunglasses, that is until I wore them to the lake and the lenses popped out under water."
1.0,"I really love my new ring, but two stones have already fallen out of the smaller one. A little disappointed my finger is breaking out too. But it looks just like the pictures."
1.0,"Way to small, add another 3 inches to the size"
1.0,"I ordered an order XL, but fit like a L, so ended up give it to my son.  Disappointing"
1.0,The fuzzy Pom Pom ball fell off day 1.
1.0,"I don't like leaving bad reviews, but the description specifically says &#34;high profile&#34;. This thing is no deeper than any other baseball cap you can buy at Lids. It's no yarmulke - but still not what I would call high-profile."
1.0,"This is advertised and described as a sweatshirt, but it is not. It’s a long sleeve tshirt."
1.0,It does not have any flexibility. The sides should be chain instead of rigid. Hard to place where you want it.
1.0,"Gave this away to a friend. It's really tight, the straps are confusing and never stay up where you put them, and the back is so low it shows your underwear. It also shows every lump, bump, or roll in your stomach. Not a fan of this one at all. I am 5'5, 139 lbs, and I ordered a medium."
1.0,"Very cheap and transparent material, returned it."
1.0,"Description does not provide the size. Can't grasp item to put in my ears, useless item."
1.0,I can't wear it to small
1.0,"Very disappointing.  I couldnt wait to wear it, but when I put it on it looked too awful to keep on."
1.0,Awful.
1.0,Cheap material. Looks cheap.
1.0,The writing is so tiny you can barely read it
1.0,"I love how the dress looks on me, but I am very disappointed with the quality. After just one wear the fabric has pulls it in and looks worn out. I dont know how many more wears I can get out of the dress before I have to throw it out :'("
1.0,When I received the product they had forgot an s on one of the words so I'm waiting for the new one to get here
1.0,The collar on this rolls every time I move and will not stay still. Adjusting it every couple minutes. Just not worth the hassle.
1.0,I need it more tight.
1.0,"I'm sorry, but I am having problems.  I feel very stupid, but I can't figure out to use this headband.  I know I saw a picture of it, and I thought it was a worth a try, to see if wearing the behind the ear processor in a headband.  I wanted to try it.  I remember that I didn't see any instructions with the package.  I have since asked for help to try to figure it out.  I thought maybe it was self-explanatory so I asked someone who seems to know how intuitively use things.<br /><br />I'm sorry, I can't figure this headband out.  If it came with a picture of how to use it or instructions, I must have misplaced them.<br /><br />I will update this after I have an appointment with my Audiologist this month.  I plan to show it to her and request help with using it."
1.0,incorrect size on the belt!!
1.0,"I was hoping for the best with these leggings. At the price it almost seemed too good to be true! But after wearing them just for an hour, the fabric had ripped and pulled apart. Good thing the package had included 3 leggings, but still that's a failure rate of 1 out of three. Well, as they say, you get what you pay for."
1.0,"They are nice , but these are  made for children s ears. Very small , you can hardly see them."
1.0,It doesn't quite match the color or style shown in the pic.
1.0,I never received a refund? It has been  a month. The dresses I ordered was tight around waist. Cup on the bra area was not appealing.  I purchase 3 of these dresses and had to return all of them. Tried to give them away. The fit was the same on other too. Check the stitching on a live model. Thank you. Hopefully this help.
1.0,Not a fan. The shirt and print are cheap. Sizes run at least 2 sizes too small
1.0,"Bathing suit was so small I could barely get it over my hips. Too bad, because it's cute. Oh, well. Back to search for a suit that actually fits plus size girls!"
1.0,I was excited to recieve this and when I got it didn't fit my sense. Was disappointed
1.0,It was nice but way too small
1.0,Can’t get it engraved anywhere
1.0,"Waited forever for it to arrive. Beanie is cute but not very slouchy. Also lined with fake fur. I bought it for my son but it seems more for a girl, so I guess I will just inherit it as I am not to keen on shipping it back to CHINA were it turns out it was shipped from. Would be nice if  amazon were more up front about this in information."
1.0,HUGE! Thin material. Arrived with hole in pocket. Refunded by seller.
1.0,It's is big and doesn't fit my head. Falls off
1.0,I normally were large size and the large in the shirt was too small
1.0,negative points
1.0,Received on 12/8 and it's already falling apart. The zipper and side rings broke. The brown lining also makes it hard to find items.
1.0,"I sent this item back just a quickly as I opened the box. First, the color is not at all mocha, it is very much so a light lavender.<br /><br />I was willing to overlook the color, but the cut and fit cannot possibly be ignored. There is ZERO shape cut into this jumper. The elastic in the off shoulder band is impossible to wear around your shoulders and the fabric itself isn’t event cut wide enough to pull above your arms. This is a major mistake."
1.0,"Broke the first time my granddaughter wore it...she's twelve years old, knows how to take care of jewelry...it just broke."
1.0,Bad purchase. Overall appearance awful. Tarnished. Larger than expected. Do not recommend. Somethongnof this low quality shouldn't even be for purchase. I wouldn't even want them if they were free. Suitable for the garage can.
1.0,"While it did fit, the material was not nice and it was a lot of fabric for a skirt. Also, it is not mini. I am 5'4 and it was right at the middle of my knees."
1.0,"They seem like reading glasses. one side of the frame arm was curved in. from the other reviews, they looked more sturdy. will be sending them back with the hopes of a full refund."
1.0,"I have never needed to give a negative review until now.  I am sad to say that the other poor reviews, that I didn’t listen to, were accurate.  I can’t get the hats pulled apart.  Many of the hat rims were wrinkled.  One hat had a hole in it, prior to being pulled away from another hat.  I have only managed to get 6 apart and all are damaged.  This item shouldn’t be offered.  Very disappointing!!"
1.0,Child received it as a gift. Took it out of the package and it broke.
1.0,"I wanted to love this dress so much but it was a horrible fit. I normally wear a size 12-14, I’m 5’4, I bought a large. I loved the fact that it has a drawstring waist, it’s short sleeve, is somewhat dressy (something other than cotton) and has a v-neck. The fabric feels good, but the fit is horrible. The shoulders are a weird puff shoulder look from the 80’s, the front part is tight but even if it fit properly, the way the buttons are sewn on, the fabric from each side does not completely meet in the middle, so skin would show unless it’s super loose. The drawstring waist does not have elastic so it does not gather correctly around the waist. It was an ok length, but since I could not adjust the drawstring to where I liked it, I could not decide if the length was great. Sadly, had to return."
1.0,The earrings came broken and all twisted up. I will be returning these.
1.0,Another Chinese product with the sizing completely off for the U.S. - waste of money.
1.0,"Understand when you buy, these things won't last more than 4 months on a normal kid. The clasp that holds the velcro strap broke."
1.0,"Shorts are hot trash,<br /><br />To be fair they are super comfortable,<br />But just after a week of wearing them the back of the shorts ripped, I was flashing my butt at the whole world, till some one at worked called me out on it<br /><br />Opps, very embarrassing."
1.0,"Titled as couples matching , well to me and everyone I asked, agrees with me that couples matching assumes there would be 2 hoodie's,  and i only received 1. Why title it that way if u only get 1. So when they arrived my twin daughters well needless to say 1 was really happy and 1 was really upset."
1.0,"This watched died first dip in the water.<br />In fact when i cameout of the water, there was water in between the screen and the watch. dont waste your money"
1.0,The back won't even come off!! The piercer guy told me it was poor material and would irritate my ear. Too bad since it's cute.
1.0,This is a cheap garment.
1.0,Very small and poorly made. I never wear it.
1.0,There was supposed to be a buckle on belt and this is a standard browning belt ? I can show photo if needed ?
1.0,I received ths in the mail yesterday. The shirt was cute but the size on this shirt runs VERY small. I typically wear a 2XL in regular shirts so that's what I order. It fit like a medium. Sending it back asap.
1.0,"5’2, 170lbs...size XL was too way big. I didn’t try on the bottoms b/c they clearly were stained from a previous try-on by someone else. (Gross!) Immediately returned for a refund."
1.0,"They make it difficult to return, not like other products you just need to take to drop off and show your code. They want you to print a return label, package it and take to post office. I have no printer at home, and when I found someone with a printer the label would print huge so you couldn’t print a label that fit on one sheet of paper and no where to reduce the size. My time to return expired and now I’m stuck with a dress I did not like and will never wear!!!"
1.0,"As soon as I opened this I noticed 4 knots in the chain. 2 I was able to get out on my own. The next was stuck there even after messing with it for 10 minutes. I tugged on the chain and it came out. When I did this to the last knot, the chain immediately broke. This is cheap and not worth it. If I were to have worn it and gotten it stuck on something I would have the same results"
1.0,These were very nice but are useless to me can not get them open even with pliers so needless to say can't use them ....disappointed.
1.0,"While the scarf is soft with nice colors/pattern, it leaves red fibers/pills over everything, especially on Winter wool pea coats and sweaters. Would absolutely not purchase this brand again!"
1.0,I was hanging out
1.0,These boots are poorly made. Very cheap feeling and the heals feel like they are about to break off. I would not recommend at all.
1.0,Made cheaply.  these did not hold up.  they were flimsy then completely broke.  i am stuck with a $50 pair of glasses.  im surprised that amazon would not work with me on a credit.
1.0,Mask cuts into your face and one of the gloves had holes in two fingers.
1.0,Love the material but it was too tight too small.
1.0,"Terrible quality. Way to small, thin cheap fabric, and has a very strong chemical smell. Came from China."
1.0,"This was awful. Looks nothing like the picture. It's tight and clingy around the waist area, not baggy at all."
1.0,This is poor quality and the seems are nearly falling apart
1.0,The thumb is huge and looks ridiculous. The fingers are so long that a normal hand doesn’t fit in them. They fell off within the first 30 seconds.
1.0,2xl is medium
1.0,Shoe was smaller than size and I purchased a size men 14. Ended up returning.
1.0,They don't mPatch the same color jacket from the same company. Color clashes.
1.0,Received it less than 10 min. ago.<br />The leather was twisted so I tried to hold it straight and it broke :(  Have you ever had a “very old” rubber band and tried to use it?  Yes! It just break like this did
1.0,These leggings are not one size fit all. I’m 5’2” and 127lbs and these were too small. The waistband especially was digging into my waist. Would only recommend if you are petite.
1.0,"It is junk.  The head was broken off when it arrived, but I cobbled it together.  It would not stay up on my arm. Don't waste your money."
1.0,"This is a beautiful bracelet, however mine broke within 2 weeks of receiving it."
1.0,I ordered three. One fit great the other two were two different materials and too small.
1.0,Buttons on the front and back do not match. Velvet ribbon at the top is completely different purple than outfit and does not go together at all. Not happy with the purchase at all.
1.0,Terrible material and see thru. Not at all the dress from the picture. Very disappointed...
1.0,"It had a nice decal on a hoodie that was poor quality. A very thin dollar store appearance. This made the hoodie look like crap. If it had been $15.00 I would have felt I got what I paid for, but it was almost $70.00. I had gotten it as a gift, and had to return it cause I was too embarrassed to give it."
1.0,"The neck collar hole is way too big, looks ridiculous on me."
1.0,These bands fall of any time anything brushes up against my wrist it is very inconvenient. Them constantly falling caused me to repeatedly drop it and now the screen is broken!!! I would not recommend it you want your watch to actually stay on your wrist.
1.0,"It looked nice, but the pendant broke within three months.  Poor quality"
1.0,"The stones are lackluster with few facets.  While the rose gold is pretty, the stones are so bland and cheap looking they spoil the display. Very disappointing. Don't waste your money."
1.0,It's very cute but my daughter wore it for 3 days before the leather came away from the clasp.  Looks like it was cheaply glued in.  Totally impractical to actually be a charm bracelet.
1.0,i received the wrong item.  no idea how i received a charm bracelet when i ordered earrings.  i should've known better as reading the reviews someone received a ring instead.
1.0,"I know this wasn't an expensive piece of clothing, but wow does it look cheap. Purchase wasn't even worth the hassle of returning."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:19100fe134836fd18626e9d3b2897f73]] I only wore this for one week and the tabs broke off of it. I am extremely disappointed in the quality of this product
1.0,Fabric is not fit for human anything.  Poor quality.  Size is too small.  For an extra large I purchase 5X and it was too small.
1.0,My son doesn’t like the shoes it hurts his feet. I had to buy another shoes from another company
1.0,"NOT cashmere, cotton, total rip off do NOT purchase."
1.0,I returned the item as it is not professional.  Very thin and clingy material.
1.0,"To small and I bought 2 sizes bigger, material is very cheap.  Not happy with purchase."
1.0,too small unable to use them
1.0,"Cheap,  broke the first day!"
1.0,I bought these for a friend but when I got them they had alot of dirt on the inside of the earring.
1.0,Holy cow! Can you spell MADE IN CHINA!!!!I can! Why doesn't Amazon tell us when the clothes are coming from this country? Everything ends up about 2 sizes too small! I have been through this more than count!
1.0,"Horrible quality - i feel like this was made with fishing wire. Very itchy - no stretch, awkward fit. I threw mine out"
1.0,"Made out of the same material that hollowed costumes are made from and fit the same way. Purely awful. Maybe you could use it as a nightgown, but the bottom would tangle around your legs. Perfect length but is so loose around the breasts and I am ample size F, so if you are smaller, beware."
1.0,"Love Karen  Scott products, usually have great results when ordering from Amazon. This not good first was sent incorrect item, returned it. Inquired in March no response from shipper. Inquired again in April & still waiting. No reimbursement no replacement, nothing. Very dissatisfied."
1.0,Doesn’t last long. Just needs the quick disconnect redesigned
1.0,It runs very small  you need to buy almost 2 sizes bigger I was very disappointed
1.0,Very cheap quality dont buy and very ugly fit
1.0,Ordered a XXL.  Fits well if you're a Mediumm.
1.0,When the dress arrived I was very disappointed in the overall quality of the dress as it looked very thin and did not have the same shape as what I ordered.
1.0,"Very disappointed.  How can this get past quality control? There are two holes in the hat when I received it. I cant do anything with this whatsoever.  And each time I touch it the holes get bigger. It's a pretty hat, though. I like the color, but poor quality, since it unravels so easily. And it's not as wide as the picture, as far as the circumfrence to cover more shoulders.<br /><br />The hat feels nice though. It also has two black ribbons on the inside that you can pull to tighten the hat if it's too loose on your head.<br /><br />Really inspect the hat when you receive it and run your fingers along each seam, to make sure yours dont have any holes."
1.0,"Cute dress, but after wearing it once (for probably an hour), it got a hole in the front and two holes where the back tag is sewn on. Super bummed. I'm normally a medium (size 6-8 or so), but I sized up to a large and it fit well.."
1.0,"I wish i could give this a minus rating... youd think for the price that this product would last.  I bought this to stretch a couple of sandals i had for the summer so that they dont press into my skin.. the middle piece that you screw to widen the stretcher, just fell apart... seriously?!... just an unnecessarily expensive piece of junk... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! BTW... good luck getting im contact with their customer service"
1.0,[[ASIN:B00DJ9VLGQ Frogg Toggs Chilly Shade White]] Packed very tight and tore trying to unfold!! Had to wet it to get it to come apart! Material is way too thick!! It is thicker than the cooling towels and about same material! No air will pass through these!
1.0,Maybe my girls are too small but these didn’t work
1.0,"Terrible quality. Reminds me of a Halloween costume type material, and it absolutely looks like one on. Heed my advice. Skip this one."
1.0,Seriously the worst purchase ever! Nothing like the description. I ordered 5 x (just in case it ran small). I gave it to my 6 year old to wear to bed. Not worth wasting my time trying to return it for a refund.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:1cbbedf4d58cfbbbe5abcb2ad7060e77]] I’ve bought these exact socks from same seller before and the colors were supposed to be black with tan letters, tan, and a grayish blue like in the picture. This time when I bought a new pack the material is now cheaper and the colors were changed to less appealing tones. The new colors are now black with white letters, a mustard color, and a light grey. Completely disappointed."
1.0,Runs wayyyy too small. Shrinks after the first wash too!
1.0,These are tiny. I got a large and am a size 10. They would fit a thin nine year old girl.
1.0,You get what you pay for.  At least I got to wear them once before one of the stones fell out of one of them.
1.0,"The sizing runs small, the image looks absolutely ridiculous and is barely hanging on to the shirt, It's a big black square with edges I could peel off myself. What a shame.  I can't believe my 10 year old paid 20$ out of his own allowance for this as a birthday gift to his big brother. It's really sad, I'm giving him his money back. This shirt is garbage."
1.0,I like the design<br />I did not like the fit or how the feel
1.0,"Had a hole in a ""new"" jacket.  Then took forever to get reimbursement"
1.0,Item was poorly crafted and definitely did not look as elegant as in the photo. Did not use.
1.0,Nice two pair of underwear! Too bad package was open less three underwear.  Maybe it's the time of year.
1.0,"What are these, hoodies for ants!??"
1.0,waaay too small!
1.0,Don’t waste your damn money
1.0,"It is gigantic!  Don't remember if I ordered L or XL, but it would fit a 4X.  I gave it away."
1.0,I did a search for thinsulate lined work gloves and theses came up.  there was no photo of the thinsulate lining in the descriptions so I was concerned and I was right! I do not recommend this product if you need the thinsulate lining.  Waste of time and money.
1.0,The crystal looked like a faint rose quartz. There is no way that it is an ameythest. Very disappointed!!
1.0,This dress is clearly supposed to be fitted... so I’m unsure why they made it ENTIRELY see-through. Totally not worth it.
1.0,This product did not last 2 weeks before getting a hole in it. Poor quality.
1.0,Measured my calf as directed. Had to have my wife help me put them on. Socks were so tight they cut off all circulation.
1.0,Couldn't read words on watch
1.0,"Please take a look at the picture, that’s literally what it says. They just put a bunch of letters together.<br /><br />The quality of the fabric is decent, but come on, do you really want to wear something that has been mispelled like this? It’s pathetic.<br /><br />I wish I could get my money back."
1.0,Se despegó uno de los bolsillos
1.0,"I am giving this one star I really don't want to because it's very cute but as I was getting ready today and had my hair put up I noticed that in the back by the neck is a gap about 2 inches that wasn't sewn up to the neckline, I rather fix it myself and buy a little sewing kit even though I hate sewing and I can't see very well than go through the hassle of sending it back then waiting for another one. I wrote the company and asked them if this was a common issue so I am going to wait to hear back from them before I buy the green dress. Like I said it is pretty but I don't think it's right to buy something that has to be repaired and sewn before I can even use it. If it was sewn right I would give 5 stars and order the green one."
1.0,"I ordered what I thought was a Large, I received a small. And it was extremely cheep.  A total waste of money.  I asked for a refund,  and got the run around.  I was totally ripped off by the seller."
1.0,This thing works for about an hour at a time - if that.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,"I ordered these for my niece and they are way to small, she can’t get her hands in them at all without it hurting her to the point she cries"
1.0,I should have listen to the reviews. Waste of material.
1.0,WAY SMALL TINY
1.0,"I was excited to get this shirt, but when it got here, it had a hole in it!"
1.0,These do not stick and offer no support whatsoever. Had them on 10 minutes and they peeled off. Waste of money.
1.0,I have had the watch band for just over a week. The band has already started pilling and pulling apart. The loop around the attachment to the watch has stretched out and there is no elasticity left in that portion. Not worth the ten bucks.
1.0,"It's very difficult to size this belt because it stretches. I tried to get the same size I had before, but it is way too long now. I have about that I can't even use!"
1.0,The insole of shoe is soft but the shoe itself is very hard! Rubbed foot ! Returned!
1.0,"I sent them back same day I got them. They didn't fit, too small around and barely got over my shoulders."
1.0,Nice but really big i can wear it as anklet. Can not wear as a bracelet. The hearts are extremely big.
1.0,"This shirt fits in a very dysfunctional way. It’s snug around the bottom edge and it’s way too short. Not at all like the picture portrays. Really weird. And, the return window past without me realizing because I had gone out of town and left it at home. Waste of money."
1.0,I did not care for these pajamas .. I wore them once then put them in the box to go to a charity.
1.0,I bought these party hats for my daughters 2nd birthday. Me and my mother-in-law spend about 3 hours trying to put them together and after waisted so much time we finally gave up. They were completely impossible to assemble. Total waste of money. Would 100% not recommend!
1.0,"I like the product but when I received it, there was no eyepatch to go with it. It is very disappointing."
1.0,I was really disappointed in this item.  This item definitely runs small
1.0,This is total trash. Do not waste your money. Super flimsy and does not look like the picture AT ALL!!! It kills me to even give it one star.
1.0,"Do NOT buy. As soon as I opened the clear package, the letter fell off. Didn’t even get to wear it"
1.0,"I had high hopes for this (but not too high, because of the price)... I was wrong. The style is cute, but that's where my positive feelings stop. The chain is Very short (hit me higher than the photo; the top chain was like a choker), and the metal is extremely thin and cheap looking. The entire necklace set went straight into the trash after I opened it. Also, I realize that this came from another country, but I had actually forgotten about the order by the time it got to me; I think it took around a month? I don't know. Just don't buy this; I'd recommend a slurpee at 7-11 instead, for the price. Much more satisfying."
1.0,"This did not fit well the armpit cutout were too high, the sleeves were to short, and the neck line did not match up. And on top of that it was sown together using fishing wire which made the whole thing super itchy! I was highly disappointed!!! What a waste of money."
1.0,nope!! not at all this is going in the trash
1.0,not a good looking pendant. Cheaply made. Felt like plastic
1.0,Broke when I went to put it on the first time
1.0,Material had no stretch to it and the neckline was huge
1.0,"this is huge. unless your kid has a bobble head, it's not going to fit. It was too large for me."
1.0,"Terrible quality. Ordered a different color from the same seller and quality was fine. V neck on this color is the same length to the tie part, meaning unwearable. Terrible."
1.0,"I ordered a small and they were gigantic!<br />Unfortunately, there was no way for me easily alter them so  I had to return.<br />Also they are little sheer so be careful when you choose what to wear underneath"
1.0,Socks start falling apart after first hand washing.
1.0,ugh-ugliest buttons ruin these potentially ok oddly shaped<br />too small for size chart too
1.0,"First off, I rate this dress a -5. I absolutely hate it. The material is like spandex and super stretchy. I can't tell you for sure because there is no tag in it. I bought an XL but it fits like 4x. It's just flat out ugly, and it definitely does not fall off the shoulders like the picture. It has a keyhole in the back. It's horrible and I'm sending it back."
1.0,"Dress has some horrible fold in the front and, unlike other products from this brand, looks cheap and just ugly."
1.0,Worn once and under wire is sticking out!
1.0,"While the belt itself is amazingly crafted, the buckle however is cheap and very weak. Just bending over snapped the buckle not once but twice on the original and the replacement. I will keep the belt, now I'm in the market for a buckle."
1.0,I am genuinely disappointed. These are basically sleep pants they are far too thin to wear in public. For 20 I expected way better quality.
1.0,Nice fit but when I took them off they broke! Not happy . Those were suppose to be my sprint glasses.
1.0,"I was so hopeful for this product, and excited. But I couldn’t even put my pants on because the silicone would roll. I couldn’t even wear them once even though the silicone seems pretty sticky, it wouldn’t stay in place but just roll over. I have no idea how others could manage it, but it is an impossible thing for me."
1.0,"Looks , So, cheap!!  The protective glasses and so Disappointed. !!<br />But the price is so expensive!!<br />Haha…<br />No more!"
1.0,"It burned my neck and chest area, chemical burn"
1.0,Dont even try it unless you are a b cup or smaller. Extremely tiny oddly spaced cups. Which is strange because the torso was loose. :(
1.0,"They just don't work, blurry, dizzy, cute but does not work for actual seeing and eyeglasses."
1.0,I bought these and wore them twice to workout and washed and the thread came out at the seams in the crotch. I had them exactly one month yesterday and now I can’t even return them.
1.0,All 3 shirts are different fits/sizes even though the tags all say large. The material is very thin and not very well made. Would not recommend this product.
1.0,I really needed some of the letters from this set so when I saw that I could purchase them from amazon and get prime shipping I jump at it.  Imagine my surprise when I opened up the package and found these plain square silver charm beads.  Highly upset because I thought my problem was solved now I don't know what I'm going to do.
1.0,"I used the size chart to find my size and ooooh boy, the top was huge (but the bottoms fit???) and the worst part was the ROCK HARD cups on the top that looked absolutely comical on me (32C). I'd post a photo but it was too NSFW with the huge gaping 😂<br /><br />Even if you're my size and have a very large bust, the cups have no flexibility whatsoever and it just looks terrible. I literally lol'd and gasped at the same time when I pulled it out of the package. If you were to shrug your shoulders or bend over while wearing this, the girls will be OUT. Just don't do it..."
1.0,Sloppy made
1.0,"(Left pic) tie clip we received, (right pic) cuff links from different seller.<br />Got these for our wedding. We were expecting the design like the cuff links but it’s way too oval and not as detailed as we were hoping. Do not recommend."
1.0,"My 18yo daughter is 5’7”, thin person without curves. She is usually a small. I bought them in M for Christmas.<br /><br />These leggings in a medium would not go past half of her thigh."
1.0,"Wore them for one day, and ripped the crotch. I got a size medium, I weight 120lbs and the legs are not that tight at all, in fact I felt they were. Bit big, but after doing stretches and playing at the park for 2hrs with my kids the crotch ripped. What in the hell is that? Very pretty very comfy, but extremely cheaply made, I have sets that are 2-4yrs old that are not even worn out and I use to wear to work at Amazon and the gym, so 10+hrs a day. These didn’t even last 2hrs. Well, I guess you get what you pay for. Cheap sets= cheap quality."
1.0,"I bought 5 pairs of these to wear with dresses. I have work 2 pairs, and both pairs got a huge &#34;run&#34; in them the first time worn. And I bought a size up, so these were not tight on me. disappointed with them. They are only good for one wear."
1.0,The stitches in the underarm area came apart in around three months. Also the zipper on one of them stopped working. Now only fit for use as rags.
1.0,"Can't see through,  it has a nice hat but looking through it makes everything looks distorted, not clear."
1.0,"I like the necklace because it is very pretty and dainty.  However, it broke the second time I wore the necklace.  The chain near the gold bar broke and I am not even sure if I can pay to have it repaired."
1.0,"The camels are hollow in the rear side, and way to big for a bracelet"
1.0,It broke the first time I wore it.
1.0,"Kid got one of these at elementary school. It broke almost immediately so we bought a bag of them to replace it. When we received the bag, the label said it’s for 16+. Typically that means it hasn’t been tested or approved as safe for kids under the age of 12. That is, safe from lead, pthalates, BPA, sharp edges if it breaks etc.<br /><br />This item is made with PVC, which has a history of being contaminated with lead, among other things.<br /><br />The information about being for 16+ is not in the product description and you can’t see it on the picture of the label. Very deceptive.<br /><br />We will be returning the item."
1.0,"The putatively “orange” band was a putrid mixture of yellow and tan. The band itself looked to be pretty good, but I’ll never know. That band will never be on my wrist. Yuk!"
1.0,The left boot won't zip all the way and the rainbow pattern is bubbled up on the sole making it look cheap. My daughter was disappointed but happy I thought of her.
1.0,"I wanted to love these. They’re well made, the style is very flattering, the fleece lining is soft and thin, they’ve got pockets! What went wrong? I couldn’t get them on! I ordered the same size I usually get in leggings (I size up one size so they’re a little loose because I don’t like them too form fitting) but I couldn’t even get these on!  I even held them up to another pair of leggings I’ve got and the width was only about half the size! Really disappointed because they seemed perfect otherwise. Other reviews talk about them running big, it seems like they don’t have much consistency in sizing on these. If you don’t mind possibly having to make a return, give them a try."
1.0,"Ugh where to begin. It's just cheap, and weird. It's kinda big, with a cheap ribbon to tie. All I did was touch the side loop to thread the robe ribbon and it ripped off. The arms have ¾ sleeve elastic that I stretched out for comfort. The thong was like a 4X with a loose buttcrack string. That string is supposed to disappear into the crack, not dangle along side. All in all, I felt like a dead ghost woman in a mangled lace mess, with a loose buttcrack string. Waste."
1.0,"Product advertised as men's product, but would only fit a young boy.  Flimsy quality. Very disappointed."
1.0,Very poor quality it’s a one piece with a belt and the color received was not the shade expected  she was so disappointed
1.0,"not the same style as the picture, its not sheer fabric and not flowy"
1.0,"Beware of the sizing charts.  I'm a US size 12-14 normally, bought an XL, and ended up giving it to my my size 6 niece for Christmas.  It fit her perfectly."
1.0,Waste of money. Fits like a 5th grade sewing project.
1.0,Color looks nothing like pictured very cheap product
1.0,"I bought these shoes for my 7 year old. He loved the look and I liked the soles. We received them 2 days ago. He wore them to camp which was indoors both days, so no outside hardcore playing. The shoes are already tearing at the seam and they are fraying on the strap. Very disappointed."
1.0,"There was little to no silicone on the heel, and therefore nothing with which to hold the sock on."
1.0,Doesn't stretch well. Cheap material. I expected more from under amour. Must be a knock off.
1.0,"I returned my package on August 1, 2022 and have not received any refund (in which I had to pay my own postage). It is now September 26, 2022 and the company keeps telling me to not worry and that the finance department is fixing the issue. I followed up every 7-14 days since August 1st and I am beginning to think this company is a fraud.<br /><br />The dress itself was poorly made and the boob padding was pretty high up. I do not recommend nor trust this company. So WARNING to all future customers."
1.0,Fits terrible.Shoulders are sewn at a weird angle creating a triagle shoulder pad look.
1.0,La pedí en talla 12 14 pero me llego pequeña y no viene las instrucciones ninguna etiqueta trae
1.0,"These are not XL size sunglasses, but small glasses with straight arms so they can fit tightly on big heads.<br />Found them also at a local store for $2!"
1.0,Awful product.  Too small and cheaply made.  Money wasted.
1.0,Very cheap and thin. On the small side
1.0,Unfortunately on me it was a tent
1.0,"I am into funky dress socks, and I wear all different kinds. These were too short and had misspelled words on them."
1.0,I am returning this item it is made very poorly there’s no way this is wearable
1.0,These look and fit like a size 7 they are far to small and hurt my nephews feet. Supee disappointing!
1.0,"Shirts are 100  percent polyester. On a hot, sunny day you sweat. You sweat and stink and sweat and stink. Not for me."
1.0,"These were so big on my foot that when I put them on, they literally fell right off! No elastic to snuggly fit around toe area. Just flimsy nylon. Had to return."
1.0,"Knock off of the image provided. The bodice and skirt aren’t cut like the image with a seam going down the bust, the bodice and skirt is gathered with elastic, the buttons are fake. The only pro is that the fabric is at least not terribly see-through and of moderate quality"
1.0,"As a seamstress, these masks are disappointing. I dont understand why these companies use WHITE thread to finish stitch a product that has NO white.<br />It makes the completed product look cheap and tacky.<br />When I emailed for a reason as to why all the masks are being sewn with white thread, no satisfactory answer was provided.<br />Its almost like you have a white bridal gown and they keep sewing it white every other colour except the colour of the gown.<br />Additionally the positioning of the Jamaican flag is incorrect where the yellow diagonals do not meet the green at the top they brach off at the sides."
1.0,"DO NOT PURCHASE<br />I was unable to wear because, like another review states, they do not close securely.  With one earring the least movement of turning your head, the closure opens.  With the other earring it WILL NOT close at all.  I went to return them and the shipping is more expensive than the earrings. SO, I'm stuck with crap!"
1.0,very small junior size. The fit is horrible. feels cheap
1.0,The dress is super short and does not cross over enough in the front. The keyhole is huge!! It is about 3 times the size of what is shown in the picture. I normally wear a size 18 and the 3x was pretty true to size overall. I will be returning this item.
1.0,Did not like at all
1.0,"Be aware ordering any clothing from Amazon.<br />A lot of it is from China and the it's doesn't fit you unless your all skin and bones,petite ,or super thin.<br /> People with a body type of avenge ,chubby ,etc it' wont fit no matter what size you select.<br /><br />They measure their clothes differently from Americans."
1.0,no one will wear these they smell bad
1.0,"my wife loved this necklace, unfortunately the chain has broken and it seems it can not be repaired.<br />Please help."
1.0,this multi-layered necklace was crammed into that blue box ... it arrived completely twisted & has at least one broken chain -- what a mess !!! it's going to be crammed right back into that blue box & returned
1.0,Zero stars if I could!! What’s the deal?! Supposed to be several stacked bracelets only got the one!! This was a gift I needed for tomorrow so I can’t even get a new one in time.. very disappointed it would have been perfect if it came as advertised!
1.0,soooo cheap.  One of the back straps broke within 10 mins of wearing around the house. don't waste your money
1.0,had marks on the sides
1.0,This product was way too small.
1.0,They lasted 20min before they fall apart. I would them less than 0ne star if I could.
1.0,"Despite looking so pretty, the top gold part is actually plastic and two customers have lost their stone."
1.0,Bought these for Christmas presents. They are super cheap made in china merchandise. Sending them back!
1.0,Doesn't fit the watch
1.0,"I ordered a tan blazer and got a very light cream blazer, almost white. Looked like a tuxedo jacket, was very disappointed"
1.0,This would be great for a bathing suit cover up. It’s complete sheer.
1.0,"Color was not as expected, not brown more a lime green."
1.0,Waste of money. My husband is still snoring loudly through his mouth and the strap is in the right position on his chin. Glad I only spent $14. Now if only he would stop and I can get back to sleep. Ugh!
1.0,"Pésima calidad,"
1.0,Arrived broken and scratched
1.0,🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
1.0,"There is absolutely NO GRIP to these gloves at all.  I forced myself to CAREFULLY use them in the kitchen clean up. Luckily nothing was broken.  And, they DO NOT CLEAN anything. My microfiber cloths and disposable gloves work much better.  Also, took them to the bathroom and used them on the commode and then THREW THEM IN THE GARBAGE.  I believe this product if made properly, could really work.  I am going to start researching the other gloves.  Anyone with suggestions?"
1.0,Me llego el producto y no funciona
1.0,"I'm a small 36B and this fit well. The straps across the chest aren't necessarily tight against my skin, however a few stitches to take the straps in a bit fixed that issue. Love it! No padding though, so just be aware of that. It's a very stretchy material and very comfy."
1.0,"I could have glued it back in for the price I paid. But didn't want to bother. However the ring looked as pictured minus the ""stone"""
1.0,This visor doesn't strap...it's made for a child's head.  Do not order
1.0,The ring I purchased said it was sterling silver 925 and clearly that’s a complete lie!! As you see from the pictures I posted it turned my finger green. And I only wore it a week.
1.0,It doesn't lokk like leather but plastic. No elegant at all.
1.0,Loved the watch.  But.....first I lost the smiley face.  I do not know where.  Then yesterday the clasp area literally fell apart.  Now I just have a unwearable watch.
1.0,"This is for people with malnutrition, this product cannot be displayed for sale if it's 3 sizes smaller than supposed to be !"
1.0,Way too small! For gals with no bust or hips.
1.0,Ear prices slide right out even if you take pliers to it since they are so stretchy and adjustable strap isn’t sewn together so if you adjust the thing comes apart. Waste of money.
1.0,"Ordered this dress for a beach vacation.  Ordered Small I am 5'1"" tall, 130 lbs.  The dress that I received looks like a house could fit into it!  This is more like a double-wide for a gorilla!  Horrible cheap looking material as well.  Ordered another one from a competitor seller and that one is perfect!  But from this vendor, never again!  I don't think I would ever make this one fit even if I ate doughnuts every day for the next 20 years!"
1.0,"This clasp broke the first time I tried to put it on. I did not get to wear it. I'm disappointed, but I guess I got what I paid for."
1.0,Gauges too big for ears and nose. Disappointed.
1.0,Came broken..
1.0,This was a Christmas gift...when I was laundered it came apart
1.0,"The fit is okay, but the seams ripped within a week, and my son’s toes were hanging out between the top of the shoes and the soles. I threw them away after the second time he wore them. Waste of money."
1.0,They are a cheap stocked if. Zipper is already coming unsewn just trying them on.
1.0,"The gloves reeked like burnt plastic as soon as I opened the package. Even after several washes, I still can't get the smell out."
1.0,It itches so much even washed them. The lace trim around the whole bra makes me itch like i have chicken pox. Wish they sold 1 instead a whole pack so i could of tried. With my schedule I travel for work so was unable to send back in time for returns now I have to give to Goodwill.
1.0,The legging were very see through
1.0,"Hello, these rings are not what I expected, the model is beautiful, but the manufacture is not, it has details that do not allow me to use them, the crystals are badly glued, the golden balls are not the size of the hole that the ring has and it looks stick it. It looks very bad. I would NOT buy it again."
1.0,"Came tangled and is still tangled.  No one can get it apart, just a big gold ball of chain.  Don't waste your money."
1.0,"I should’ve bought myself a house shoe that was a little more expensive. Theses feel and oddly enough, sound cheap. Size-wise they fit as expected. They’re just not comfortable. Feels like wearing a very cheap plastic shoe."
1.0,clasps didn't work
1.0,Extremely small. You can use it for kids shoes but not for an adult
1.0,Rings were broken upon arrival. Badly made.
1.0,"Way to wide - maybe ok if you have very wide feet/ankles. Wanted to like - they look really cute online, but they just look cheap in person. Look like they were made out of plastic clothesline. Doubt they would last long."
1.0,These slippers are constructed of materials too hard for comfortable lounging around the house.
1.0,Totally disturbed by purchasing this tainted dress!<br /><br />Save your Time Money and Health and Keep Scrolling...
1.0,fits very bad
1.0,Muy baja la calidad lo siento no es lo que esperaba
1.0,"I bought this without expecting much based on the negative reviews, but I took my chance. Having received the item, it is actually worse than my lowest expectations.<br />This is a flimsy, brass-tinted ""toy"" you give to a child as a party favor for use at a gypsy costume party. The chain is like the ones from a toilet bowl flush valve. Extremely junky item not worth ten bucks.  Fifty cents is more like it.  Don't insult a person by giving this as a gift. Wear it and be judged as having lousy taste. Spare yourself from the embarrassment.  Lastly, don't get ripped off like I was. You've been warned."
1.0,Watch hands stopped working within 2 months!<br />Can’t find manufacturers contact info!<br />Very disappointing!
1.0,Too small and tight at the waist. The ribbon in the front ties the front so it pulls from the neck. Other than that it was really cute and cheeky to show off the booty! I got a size Large
1.0,Very unflattering - even the small was way too big and boxy.
1.0,Did not like them
1.0,Poorly made. Broke over and over. Very cute but only good for someone who doesn't move around much at work. Snagged on things and popped apart.
1.0,These slippers started to come apart after few weeks of mild use on our composite deck. When you take it out of the plastic bag they packaged in they smell stink like new car tires. You will not find this kind of material in any of the US retail shoe store.<br /><br />The slipper is a two part rubber pieces glued together. There is no mechanical connection of any kind between the sole and the band.<br /><br />The graphic art on the slipper was great - the only positive side they have.<br /><br />Stay away!
1.0,The necklace broke very easily. Cheap product
1.0,Yet another product much bigger than the picture shows. Won't wear but will either gift them or donate them
1.0,"My issue with these socks was that the design is printed, not woven into the material. What happens is when you stretch the sock over your feet and legs, the design is no longer visible, because it expands so much. Such a bummer."
1.0,Es muy arrugada
1.0,Wrong style! They don't look nothing like pants on the picture.
1.0,Very small sizing . Ordered XX  l hubby could not even get them on . originally wrote this review and the company sent me an email asking me to remove it . They offered me A gift card to take it down .Telling .
1.0,"I used the size chart to select the correct size and it is far too small, as well as not supportive at all. It's smudges me just fine but there is no support to prevent bouncing."
1.0,"Cheaply made, they fall out and break. Theyre awful."
1.0,I was so disappointed in their shirts. I took it out of the bag and it reeked of cigarette smoke. But I still tried it on and I realize at the bottom of the shirt there was this huge hole that felt like it was burned.  Around the hole you can tell it was burned because it feels like melted plastic.
1.0,"We never were able to get them in the ears and hooked.  Even outside of the ear, rehooking the post into the barrel was almost impossible.  They are sitting unused."
1.0,"Aside from the fact that it took 75 days. 75 days, to arrive. It is not the item advertised. It is advertised as "" a natural ammonite fossil"". I received some D to F grade (see picture) at best ammonites in a GLUE/RESIN matrix. It's a bunch of junky ammonites thrown in some epoxy and polished. If I could give zero stars I would!"
1.0,Band did not hold. Would not recommend.
1.0,No nope nada.  Not ok. Threw it away right away. Thin and doesn’t loose like the photo at all
1.0,Made for a 4 year old.
1.0,Too big and returned them plus I’m like 5” so if your y’all they will be to short because the length was perfect
1.0,Completely see-through. I immediately returned it.
1.0,"This was ridiculous!!!  I unfastened the brooch for the first time and the entire pin broke off!  As this was part of a birthday gift project I didn't have time to do a return, so I ended up sewing the brooch onto my project.  They say you get what you pay for, but come on!  Wish I could have given ZERO stars!!!"
1.0,No cometan en error de comprarlo de pone feo rápido
1.0,Colors amd patterns in the pic didn't even show
1.0,"Not good quality at all, one has already broken with one times use."
1.0,"I’ve order these before and didn’t have any problems. The quality over the last two summers has decreased drastically. They are the perfect summer sandal but if you wear daily, they won’t last long. My first pair (rose gold) I ordered two years ago still works great; the padding in the sole has diminished, but straps are still fit. The black pair I ordered were last summer had straps that there so uneven so exchanged. However, they only lasted the summer season and the sole started separating. This summer i tried again, but the straps were so large they didn’t even hold my feet in the sandal. Sadly I won’t be trying again."
1.0,"This is made of thin, cheap polyester. It runs small and while it fits it's just...awful!<br />Totally shapeless and looks nothing like the picture. Hugely disappointed. Will probably return."
1.0,Way to small not for real women with curves
1.0,"I’ve only worn it a couple times and I have to sew the semi, that’s not good. I still love the brand but the quality control has gone down."
1.0,"Ripped after wearing it once, bought the black and blue green ombré pairs and both ripped right in the groin area mid workout.I read so many positive reviews I’m sad they didn’t work for me"
1.0,"So I had previously purchased the same dress from this same vendor but in a different color - In black.  Being that I was in love with the material and the way it fit I decided to order it again in a different color -  and decided to order the blue Sapphire dress.  Well let me be clear... this blue Sapphire dress is NOT the same material as it is described in the description  - it is a made out of very cheap material almost see through very thin.  The black dress that I had previously order is just perfect, it hugs your body in the right places and it has a very nice stretch to it, and the material is thick and of a good quality - NOTHING like the blue dress and of course I returned the item.  I was very disappointed as I was expecting to get what I had received before but of course in a different color.  I contacted the seller, I tried to explain the situation but it might have seem as if the seller was having trouble understanding the issue.  Hopefully that specific dress was a mistake within production as I would love to order again if the issue is fixed and resolved."
1.0,"This purse was so cute in the picture, however, it was made of cheap plastic , and definitely a purchase that I regret.  The inside pockets were too small to put anything in, and it is already peeling after only one use.  Very disappointed:("
1.0,Horrible cheap looking knock off
1.0,The quality is crap. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Is completely different of the picture.... Is not glitter is regular color
1.0,"I ordered this because I needed a WHITE jacket for a Christmas parade, and this is CREAM.  Bright White is not an accurate description of this item.  Disappointed."
1.0,Very flimsy and bends easily.
1.0,Unfortunately this isn't the same color as the picture and very small in size. It's more of a turquoise color. Will be returning...
1.0,Very strange fit but I'm not skinny. Too see thru to.
1.0,These things don't work at all. Gonna return them. Ripoff!!
1.0,"terrible quality. the inside seams were litterly open, and after one time use the snap fell off. wanted to get some refund they offered me 3 dollars off. A BIG HUGE JOKE????"
1.0,Terrible fit won't even stay on my foot with or without a shoe on
1.0,Not comfortable .
1.0,Flimsy not as pictured
1.0,I am so upset with this item this is not a 3X this is a medium neva again
1.0,Not the same as pictured.<br />The color was totally different and the fabric is very different from what the picture looks like. Returned.
1.0,Very thin jacket and entirely too orange. Not warm at all
1.0,Does not  straighten hair
1.0,These are not even close to the color pictured in the Amazon listing. What is shown is a beautiful vivid topaz blue. What I got was cheap pale barely aqua blue that is very underwhelming. What a disappointment! Do not trust this seller.
1.0,"The  rose quartz stone fell out the first day I got it. The silver wrap is not secure, it sticks out and is not flush with the stone. The rose quartz is all scratched up."
1.0,The two layer shorts design is great and the pocket on the inside layer is very innovative. Unfortunately the outer layer is a trash material that is not comfortable at all. The inner layer that is SUPPOSED to fit like compression shorts does not do its job and instead look like boxers that are much longer than the shorts. I would not recommend as these shorts serve no purpose as normal wear nor athletic wear.
1.0,Material was less than acceptable.
1.0,The earrings were assembled backwards.
1.0,"Not true to size,, poor quality, Difficult returning"
1.0,"These dresses are not true to size at all.  You will need to go up at least 2 or 3 sizes.  I purchased 2 colors and both fit differently, and the pockets are very high on the waist.  Poorly made."
1.0,"Epic fail...I bought these socks for Tough Mudder, They were supposed to keep my feet dry, Unfortunately that didn't happen, and what made it even worse, my feet were constantly in a puddle within the socks throughout the event. Save your money because they won't keep your feet dry like they're supposed to."
1.0,"Ordered two sizes larger and fit was too tight, even at the ankle."
1.0,The dress is covered in dirty dark spots.
1.0,Only after 1 month of being added to my bracelet the gold plating has completely been rubbed off and its now just a silver E. Currently in search of 14 or 24k gold letter charms.
1.0,Total garbage … and that’s where it ended up
1.0,"I have purchased this item in the past and was satisfied with the product, however, the material is cheesy and flimsy. WIll NOT repurchase from your company again."
1.0,Not as expected. Cheap quality.
1.0,"No es lo que pedí, no es lo que muestran en la foto 👎🏻"
1.0,It is awful!!! Will be returning ASAP!!!<br />Smelled horrible...
1.0,Slippers keep sliding to the sides. Perhaps I received wrong size! In fact I know I received wrong size too bad.
1.0,"Cute color, design; awful execution. The sleeve holes where so small basically no room to stretch or move arms normally."
1.0,"Fading gold paint on this ring, and I feel embarrassed wearing it."
1.0,Runs very small fits awkward No support in bra
1.0,Need fluffy fur.
1.0,Really cheap not worth iT
1.0,Did not give the flexibility that was expected. Also once they are in you cannot get them out without breaking them. Will not buy this product again.
1.0,No support...not what expected
1.0,This dress came in with stains :-( . I guess I'll return it and purchase the black one.
1.0,"Not what I expected, don't like it."
1.0,These tiny bolos are cheaply made.<br />They are so small that they bring to mind what you'd buy for a little kid.<br />Ridiculous. Not worth anything.
1.0,"color is great, it was just a little too big, had to return it."
1.0,It has a silk or satun inside but didnt work for me kept slipping maybe ot will work for others me not really.
1.0,bent out of shape just getting my keys on the wring.
1.0,"I was really exicted when i got this...however, after I'd rushed to a mirror to try it on, I found out why this is so cheap. The part that is supposed to fit over your ear is nearly flat, and it kept slipping off. Also, my ear is now burning and red...suppose that's to be expected, but I'm very dissapointed. Don't waste your money on this."
1.0,"Looking back- the picture fits, but it’s rayon. Not some kind of cotton comfy blend."
1.0,Returned it. Didn’t like the fit. I had ordered it bc it’s a hard to find color.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:a89f3935b8f61360408dde088d326937]] I purchased this shoe for my birthday dinner and I’m extremely disappointed, the shoe looks poorly made and and whatever they used at the bottom as a sole was coming off straight out of the box. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SHOE"
1.0,"The material is way too heavy for hot weather, and it's way too short for me and I'm 5'4&#34;. I'm going to stop buying dresses on Amazon now bc I didn't expect to buy from China and I try not to."
1.0,my ears are to small. the top of the cuff hangs off of my ear. cheap product means cheaply made.
1.0,They do not hold their shape! After only one wearing they would curl up and nothing I did would stop it. I ended up throwing all of them away and buying more of of a different make that did keep their shape.
1.0,"WAY too tight, and I got size C/D largest and am 5’8” and 145 lbs. Returning them."
1.0,They fell apart in less than a month - won’t buy again.
1.0,Product seems came unraveled after one wash
1.0,It got scratched on first use. 🙁
1.0,"It arrived BROKEN. Unless used for  decoration like I intended to use it for, do not buy. Very cheap!"
1.0,I bought these for myself but gave them to my daughter. Very cheap!
1.0,Returning due to weird stain
1.0,"I recently purchased this product in order to preserve a new pair of Nike Air Force Ones i had purchased earlier that day. This product has not done a damn thing in terms of keeping the shoes from getting creased. It doesn't fit correctly inside the shoe and of the few parts of the shoe that this product did fit correctly were not protected from creases. Granted, this product is not advertised as being able to fit the air force ones. However, this product did not work correctly in another pair of Nikes i own as well as a pair of vans. The plastic is flimsy and bendy and does not prevent creases. I cannot vouch for there products that do the same thing but i can confidently tell you after a week with these ""crease protectors"" that they are NOT the product you need."
1.0,Cheap material. Very ugly.
1.0,Returned.  Poor quality. Shipped in plastic bag.  Crushed and falling apart.
1.0,"My aunt bought me one of these like 3 years ago and I loved it. I nearly cried when I lost it on the subway a week ago. So I bought another one to replace it, and I still miss the first one. The quality has dropped significantly. The leather feels thin and fake. The fur and the lining are thinner. The seams feel like they're going to pop. The original one I owned was a badass tough cool hat, and the new one seems like a knock off....<br /><br />Update:<br />I returned the item.<br />I purchased another black leather Klondike Sterling hat from another vendor on Amazon and the difference is night and day.  The quality of the new one is much better than this one, the fit is better, the seams aren't loose, the leather isn't thin and cheap, the fit is perfect, it reminds me of my old hat that I lost on the subway.  You can tell right away by the sewing and the cut of the leather straps.<br /><br />Stinks that Klondike has no quality standards for this product.  I understand that leather is natural and that it is prone to minor defects, but just quality of materials alone shouldn't be an issue."
1.0,"Love the shirt and was so excited to get it, however, when I ordered the first one it was printed all crooked. So I figured it was just a mistake so I ordered another one and it came just as crooked. So it is obviously just a quality issue, I would definitely not recommend it unless you want a crooked printed shirt."
1.0,The picture shown is not the dress I received which looked nothing like the photo. It was short and did not have the stitching to fit as shown
1.0,I wasn’t a fan of the slick material
1.0,I washed this separately in cold water and the black dye bled onto the white. Now it just looks awful. The washing instructions say wash separately. Dryclean recommended.It should say dry clean ONLY.
1.0,"This product is absolute trash. Color not as depicted, material is cheap, printed on only one side, and unless you're skull it the same size as a 6 year old this won't be a COMFORTABLE fit let alone ""slouchy"". I tried it on and I have a big dome and had to literally peel it off my head because it was squeezing it so tight. It sucks, don't buy it."
1.0,Came ripped on the side. Paper like quality.
1.0,"I cannot count 10 pockets, maybe my elementary school teacher did not teach me how to count!  If Scootevest counts a pocket with an inch long stitches at bottom as two pockets, that is dishonest at least!  I bought this to wear in a long international flight It supposes to be a travel hoodie, yet inside pockets do not have zippers!!!  So I cannot really place my passport in one of these pockets with magnets holding them closed, I don't know how security they are, but I would not put my travel documents in them, in other words, that &#34;many&#34; pockets are useless: I only need one for my phone."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:2a51428c395f1122862338240a999993]] I am no happy when I open my package. The plastic bag were it’s come in was broken and the earring was not stuck to the pin. Is no fair pay for something that you need to fix it
1.0,The battery does not hold a charge for longer than 2 hours after charging for at least 6 this is ridiculous!
1.0,Metal is too thick and is not bendable
1.0,"Irem arrived with a big hole, looks like it was cut with a blade. Very disappointed that it came in this condition."
1.0,"These were not hipster style underwear as advertised, they are regular briefs."
1.0,Does not feel real
1.0,It didn’t stay on my child’s foot and actually hindered  attempts at taking steps. This isn’t for babies learning to walk.
1.0,"This shirt was pretty cute, fit decently, looked decent. It has elastic around the sleeves. The elastic ""popped"" about 3 mintues after I put it on in a hotel room for a mixer/convention. Unfortunately, I didn't have extra outfits so I looked ridiculous all night with one tight wrist band, and one super floppy sleeve. Very embarrassing."
1.0,No free shipping
1.0,"Beautiful color and design, the lace is pretty in detail. I ordered a size L/XL and received a S/M - unfortunately, it doesn't fit as I would have liked due to the size shipped."
1.0,Received the mask 😷. As soon as I opened  it I noticed it was super small. Put it on didn’t fit. Put it on my 2 year old son and it fit perfect. This mask is advertised for adults which is false. It for children.
1.0,If your a heavy set guy or muscular dont waste your money the 2xl is like trying to squeeze on a medium and the material is cheap and paper thin dont waste your money.
1.0,"These earrings are so small, they're for a child or a doll. Very disappointed."
1.0,"I LOVE 90 degrees pants, but on the second time I wore this one I noticed the stitches started to get undone on the butt. Now I don’t wanna wear it anymore because I’m afraid the seems will break in the middle of a workout and everyone will see my butt. I have a couple other 90 degrees pants and this was never an issue."
1.0,Socks came apart within 5 weeks.  Outside of the Amazon 30 day guarantee.  Just Crap.  Manufacturer wants socks returned before they replace.  At my expense.  Ridiculous.
1.0,I'm disappointed in this product I used it for 5 days and strap broke.<br />It was nice for 5 days though.
1.0,Poor Is quality a fabric.  I bought 2X large and could not pull it over my head..
1.0,"While the watch is very good looking.. first, mine shipped with the knob unable to change the time. Second, in the one time I wore this, the one afternoon of use weathered the wood paint-- revealing the watch is not &#34;walnut wood&#34;, actually white plastic. The leather strap is easily worn and the fake wood paint easily peels.<br />Had this watch been made of real wood it would have been a really handsome piece. Unfortunately, it shipped broken, and was really low quality."
1.0,Very small. Couldn't even read the message
1.0,Brush is too small and solution is like water! Useless
1.0,This looks like it should be sized for boys but it’s sized for MEN. it’s not a boys jacket. it’s very nice and looked thick but I had to return it since I purchased it for a child.
1.0,En la parte interior
1.0,The rose gold came off after a day of having it in. Do not recommend
1.0,It changed  to black broke my neck out and it was just over some metal
1.0,The size is more form fitting as opposed to the picture which looks loose. I am 5'4'' 160 pounds I ordered a large and am returning.
1.0,"I liked the color and design, however, the show lacked comfort."
1.0,I would not buy this product nor ever tell anyone to
1.0,look sooo damn cheap.. throwing it away
1.0,Quickly learned i cannot wear these! The hinge irritates the inside of the piercing and it keeps getting infected. My piercing is sensitive so i don't recommend if yours is as well!
1.0,the thought is nice but my brother will need glasses to even read it. sooo small
1.0,The picture of this looks much better than the actual product. The delivered product is cheap looking and cheap feeling.
1.0,Disappointed in product
1.0,"Poor quality fabric, fit loosely, drawstrings are just sewn into the seam, not actually functional."
1.0,This item looks nothing like in the picture  it looks like a black plastic  bag.
1.0,I’ve only worn a handful of times and it’s already tarnishing.  I’m going to have to throw it away.
1.0,"Without a doubt this is a women's jumpsuits. The buttons are on the wrong side and it is cut for women, darts and all. Not for men."
1.0,"""95% Cotton, 5% Spandex, Soft and Light Weight. Very Skin-Friendly and Comfortable to Wear.<br />Super Soft Floral Print Fabric and Elastic Empire Waist Makes the Flowy Dress Soft and Stretch.""  That's what was described.  But NONE of it is accurate!  There is not a stitch of Spandex in this fabric - it's more like a cheaply-woven linen-like fabric.  Oh, wait!  It IS lightweght!  There is NO elastic in the ""empire waist.  The fabric is not skin-friendly.  The top of the dress fits well enough (but there is absolutely no stretch, so I don't think it would be comfortable for more than 10 minutes.  But the part of the dress below the bustline is HUGE!  I look like a beached whale in it!  NOTICE PLEASE that the dress arrived with the fabric-content label **cut out with scissors!!**.  Nor is there any label of any kind identifying anything about the dress, the manufacturer, the fabric, the washing instructions - NOTHING!!!  Please, save your money and your time."
1.0,I am very angry and disappointed because a necklace was not the one I bought sent me a different one to the one I bought
1.0,"God awful. The steel clip in the front are a pain in the ass, you can't clip one without unclipping another because of how stiff. The back string to lace up goes on for days, I had to tuck 90 percent of it for that reason. The back is also too high up so if you're wearing a sleeveless dress you will see the corset back peeping way over your dress. This was the worst decision I made and I even spent more money on it having it trimmed and tailored down... but you can't make this good by any means."
1.0,Not what I expected. These were more like nylons than hockey socks to wear under gear.
1.0,Material very thin....cheap dress
1.0,"Pretty, but chain snapped after wearing one time."
1.0,More red colored than dark wood. Other than that they are cute
1.0,"Two sizes smaller than expected, cheap material."
1.0,My daughter only used them twice on a hike and they can undone and torne so easily!
1.0,Took forever and definitely not worth the money!
1.0,Tag broke off the ring within a couple of weeks of use. Very disappointing.
1.0,Beautiful dress but it's not true to size...I ordered a 2x...like I do with all my dresses and I couldn't fit it around my chest and it was way to short....
1.0,"Very poor quality, and it wrinkles easily"
1.0,I didn't get all pieces to outfit.
1.0,Itchy. Small. sad.
1.0,It’s not as cute as the picture.  I wear a large and I ordered an extra large to have a flowy look but it was still to small.  It fits but doesn’t have the oversized look.
1.0,"When I just received this item I was so excited!<br />They came in inside of a cute bag with an unicorn on it. I checked each piece and each of them look cute and shiny.<br />They looked fragile though, but I didn't know until I finally tried them..<br /><br />And I didn't even had a chance to show them off at least once.. the first set broke. So quick. As soon as I put it in.<br /><br />So in conclusion, it is a beautiful and very diverse set of bracelets, they look very fashionable but they are not durable at all.<br /><br />I cannot give more than one star to an item I didn't even had the chance to use, no matter how cute it looks."
1.0,Cheap polyester material that sticks to itself and everything else. Is NOT soft and elegant...it is a bit see through and even though I bought a size larger than my size it does not cover my backside and part of my thighs.  The construction is very poor as well. Collar bias tape was cut too short so it was stretched to fit the neck hole making the shirt bunch up around the collar instead of laying flat.  Horrible.
1.0,Very uncomfortable slippers!
1.0,Clasp broken in the first two days. Junk
1.0,After having this ring the gold wore off and my finger turned green.
1.0,Not true to the measurements in the sizing chart. Runs small
1.0,Garbage. Cheap garbage. I’m very disappointed.
1.0,Does not look like the picture.  I very much dislike the material.
1.0,This headband does not stay in the hair.  I bought it for my daughter for dance.  It kept falling out while she was practicing her routine.
1.0,I ordered a 3x because thats what size I normally wear and it fitted terrible.
1.0,Waste of money. Put the new waders on and as soon as I got in the water my leg gets soaked. You're better off wrapping garbage bags around your legs than wearing these pieces of garbage.
1.0,In less than 2 weeks I have broken 2 of the bands they pull apart from where they attach to the fitbit.
1.0,This nightgown was super thin and super clingy. Definitely not true to size. Ordered my regular size and it went on like a sausage skin!
1.0,The necklace said 21 not 22 would not get again
1.0,Very cheep didn’t last long.
1.0,Too small and tight ☹️
1.0,This dress runs about 2 sizes too small. Order much a much larger size than you actually take.
1.0,Gift for grand daughter but did not last.Amazon should not be sold
1.0,"The hem on this dress is a hard no. It looks crazy. I am appx five feet tall and the hem stopped mid ankle - making the dress too short for street length and too long for mid calf. I looked at the other pics posted and it stops in a similar place on them, but does not match the photo. This dress looks ridiculous."
1.0,"They are basically padded stickers for your boobs.  They don't actually give you any lift.  I knew they wouldnt be supportive, but I'd have to pull the sticky handle part up to my neck to get any lift.  And I'm not that big!"
1.0,I purchased two of these belts and each one of them has fallen apart as pictured above. I wouldn’t recommend buying it unless you wanna buy another one and another one and another one.
1.0,"There are countless bad things about this. #1 oversized. #2 there for men but look girly. #3 they are so cheap they broke the next day after I got them. #4 the so-called gem fell out. #5 the magnetic part just fell of the earring don't by this. Today I wore them and my sisters friend walked up to me and said ""what's with the magnets?"""
1.0,arrived with a terrible smell. I ordered a size larger than normal based on reviews and it was still way too small. would recommend at least 2 sizes up
1.0,"I was so excited to receive this watch.  I love aristocats.  The face was adorable, loved the larger size, and the picture.  I was so disappointed in the strap.  It was described as leather.  There is no way this is leather.  I wore it for a couple hours and it had lines already.  After a few wears, the strap will crack and rip.  What good is a cute face when the strap will rip and you can't wear it.  I shouldn't have to replace a strap even at $40.  I's rather pay more for better quality. I returned!!!"
1.0,"Falls off my hand all the time, the lock doesn't hold ."
1.0,watch is HUGE.. not displayed well in add
1.0,"We returned this item weeks ago at the UPS LOCATION IN HUMBLE, Tx. Almost immediately after it was received, the size was not right and I printed a return labe. Now Amazon says it did not receive it back ….. what am I supposed to do?<br />Runs large."
1.0,Broke within minute of putting on... piece of junk.. What do you want for $3 I guess.  No more jewelry shopping on Amazon for sure.
1.0,I bought it for my7 years old niece for Christmas one of it got broken. Disappointed.
1.0,SIZING IS WAY TOO SMALL....THESE SHOULD OF BEEN AN XSMALL NOT A SMALL AS IN DESCRIPTION.
1.0,The necklace I received was a fake moonstone.  Cute necklace but definitely not a real stone.  Disappointed.
1.0,What can I say.  It's not made in US. Its junk
1.0,Super cheap faded some r rusty looking don’t waste your money
1.0,Not soft misshapen not true to size
1.0,"I bought two other set size 6 and both sets fit perect on my daughter, then I ordered the Red and Black set and it was too small, same size 6.  Did not want to return it because I had already wash it before trying it on."
1.0,"Definitely not for short girls lol. Ordered a Large as I wanted it to be on the lose side, but was way huge !"
1.0,I did not realize what size it was very small
1.0,"I bought this watch from the same seller, but under a different listing, which now says the product in that listing is unavailable. But I feel so strongly about this product, that I found this listing (same product and same seller) to post a review.<br /><br />It is a horrible watch. It looks great, but starts to lose time almost immediately, just long enough to take it to a jeweler to be resized, THEN it starts losing time. This watch is quite a bit more expensive than other wooden watches on Amazon, which also look really great, but I thought spending that additional money would hopefully result in a more reliable watch than the cheaper ones. I've not purchased one of the cheaper ones, so I can't comment on that, but I can tell you that the money spent on this watch was a waste, I was able to wear it once before the time went all wonky."
1.0,Not all shirts were printed on
1.0,flimsy piece of nothing. they're horrible.
1.0,Very cheaply made. Size was all off.  Seams unraveling.
1.0,Note: THESE ARE NOT ITW WEB DOMINATORS AS PICTURED. These are some sort of knock off with a different shape that doesn't hold nearly as well. Very disappointing! I will be asking for a refund! See my picture for view of what was delivered!
1.0,"Piece of crap, opened the packaging and attempted to open the plastic bag and the top "" heart "" breaks off and cuts my finger open. The ""crystals"" looked cheap and didn't form a heart at all."
1.0,These hats are very poorly made. The turkey neck doesn’t stay up and the hats aren’t long enough to stay on your head. Not a great product.
1.0,Don't buy. The band becomes discolored after 2-3 days of wear!
1.0,I agree with other reviewers. This dress is NOT A shaped like the picture. You will look like a watermelon in this dress. The material reminds me of a parachute.
1.0,Speaker does not work.
1.0,I really wanted to like this. My granddaughter picked it out for Christmas. When it came in the back was total rust. I could have fixed that with some steel wool and a little oil. Had to send it back because the arms are way too close together. It might work for a small childs shoe but not for a larger size. Doubt it would even work on a child's winter boot.
1.0,The dress is beautiful except the two tone color does not look like the picture at all. The dress is basically one color
1.0,The style of hinges on the band create an awkward angle. Therefore it doesn’t  allow the watch to tighten enough for the heart rate monitor to be accurate
1.0,Sucky
1.0,Very cheap!!! Very cheap price and VERY cheap quality!!!
1.0,Weird fit! Nothing like the picture! Too small up top in the chest and way too big in the skirt. Cheaply made and not a good design or fabric (way too thick). I would send back but I tried to take in the skirt thinking I could fix it and it only made it worse.
1.0,Super disappointed. It’s way smaller and I ordered larger.
1.0,This is  clearly advertised with a jacket.  My mother has had 3 arrive without a jacket.  I tried ordering as well still NO JACKET!!!!
1.0,didn’t even unpackage
1.0,Does not fit should not be sold for Surge
1.0,These are the worst sunglasses I have purchased..seem to be bent outward so they actually blur.<br />Even on sale at 6.99..I feel ripped off<br />The case is nice and will use it for another pair of glasses..so not a total loss.
1.0,not comfortable and poor quality of material and construction. tossed it.
1.0,"These gloves worked great for 8 or 9 times.  However, the last time I used them the left side burned my hand in a single spot I got a burn blister.  I was unable to take off the gloves because of the cold environment I was in."
1.0,"These were an impulse buy and, although I did hope they would work, I didn’t really expect them to be great. Well these weren’t great. They honestly gave me more of a headache than starting at the screen full brightness and unprotected.<br />The lenses are not clear. I don’t mean that they’re not colorless, they’re really cloudy and obscure your vision quite a bit for something that’s supposed to be eyewear.<br />Obviously I am not pleased with these. They’re really inexpensive and in this case you really do get what you pay for. Maybe a better quality pair of these “blue light reduction glasses” would be worth it, but I guarantee that these are not."
1.0,"It was inferior to what I was expecting, I thought it was much ticker and durable it was a waste of my money."
1.0,The lace end clasp keeps falling off and the lace clutch is poorly designed.
1.0,It was huge and fell apart quickly. I have bought too and tried to get a refund but no response. Ughhh
1.0,This broke the first time I wore it..which was at a Christmas party. Just sitting around the house. It's cheap .don't buy it. I gave one star because I loved the look of it.
1.0,Put it on and used once on my dog. Light does not turn on anymore and light is not bright enough...
1.0,Regret
1.0,I know you get what you pay for but this was really not worth it.  Thankfully we were able to return it.
1.0,"Women's Vintage Floral Flared A-Line Swing.  I wear an 18-20 (220lbs).  I bought the 2XL which I figured would be a bit big, cause I like loose.  I couldn't get it past my shoulders!!!  The material is scratchy & would totally be like a furnace.  returned it."
1.0,"These don’t stay on the ear, don’t put enough pressure on the ear after keloid removal. I was walking the the other room and both of them fell off just from walking around. Sad because I read a lot of good reviews but they just don’t stay on or apply enough pressure."
1.0,Worst socks I've ever bought.
1.0,"When I got it, some of the letters had fallen off and I had to reattach them, I suggest using a better adhesive"
1.0,"The two were different sizes, one came 2 inches shorter than the other. And easy on, easy off…….not really!. Returned the day I got them"
1.0,"This suit is very cute, but it does not provide much coverage at all, especially on the buttocks."
1.0,"It’s so cheaply made, I couldn’t even button it because the holes were closed by the thread."
1.0,"This shirt was listed as 100% cotton, but proved to be a poly/cotton blend that’s extremely thin and cheap feeling. I followed the care directions closely and it still shrank badly.<br /><br />It was a complete ripoff."
1.0,"I thought this bag would have been perfect for my son......who carries a 15"" gaming computer.  After one week of carrying, the strap ripped off, the bag fell and his computer was damaged. VERY DISAPPOINTED AT POOR WORKMANSHIP."
1.0,Look better in the picture.
1.0,Too small and shabby material I sent it back. I am real and review everything on Amazon.
1.0,on one of the bands the metal clip broke on the other the band is starting to unravel
1.0,broke after a week use
1.0,Poor quality. Poor material. Not as advertised. HORRIBLE
1.0,Even the smallest one stuck out too far from my nose. And the hoops were too big to fit in my nose anyways.
1.0,I was absolutely disappointed with this necklace. It was too expensive for how small and tiny the gold bar and diamond chip were. I would NOT RECOMMEND this to anyone. I even tried to pawn it. They would not take it. It was NOT PURE GOLD like it is advertised.
1.0,The elastic on top and bottom is too tight and makes the fabric in between puff out awkwardly. It's also not long enough for my taste. The fabric could be better. Overall not a great tube top. I'm returning it.
1.0,Ordered as a Christmas gift and my granddaughter didn’t like the shirt colors or texture. I plan to return it
1.0,OH my goodness i got my late sister and mother birthstone along with mine and even under heavy lighting the stone are invisible I wont even tell anyone about the meaning of the ring because i know  the first thing they'll wont to do is look at the birthstone.... 1000 % disappointed
1.0,there is no padded no silky smooth and it is see through
1.0,It didn't work.
1.0,I have to return it.

1.0,Ordered the rose gotthe ugly yellow one and was very disappointed
1.0,This size large does not fit like a large. The top is tight to put on. Overall would not recommend
1.0,"yes, its for cancer funds, but dude its not worth it, better buy a live strong bracelet, poor poor quality."
1.0,"Appears to fit well in the chest and shoulders appeared to fit correctly, but forget lifting your arms in front of you or over your head. Really tight and pulled in the arms."
1.0,"The interesting design of a wooden watch and the great price got me. Unfortunately, it wasn't long before something went wrong. In less than a week, the second hand broke off and was lying in the bottom of the face. I hadn't hit it on anything or been extra active in order to cause this. The title of my review says it all. Steer clear!"
1.0,"Every brand of bra I purchase is a 34B.  This bra is in no way a size B cup.  At least a size C cup.  RETURNS ARE ALSO NOT FREE.  I just asked to return the bra's and was informed they would take $3.33 off of my refund for shipping.  I love the bra itself, but sizing is way off, I was very disappointed."
1.0,"1st. sweater was a large and I ordered xxlarge ,,,, sent it back and 2nd sweater looks like they took xxlarge sticker of another sweater bag and sent it anyway but both were the same size,,,,,large. gave it to my son."
1.0,The ratings are pretty but the posts bend really easily.
1.0,These are terrible! Don’t waste your money. The sizing is ridiculous and there is absolutely no way the ones I received were correct. Size 10-18? Try more like size 4-6. Not happy.
1.0,This jewelry ruined my piercing. Not hypoallergenic. I don't even know what this trash is. Do not buy it. Its awful.
1.0,"Appears to be a well made product, but was the actual size was smalled than it should have been.  I purchased the mens L ( supposed to fit mens size 10-12) for my husband who wears a size 10.  The sock was much too small and tight.  This would be a good product if you have small feet or if they added xl and made socks true to size."
1.0,"Very shiny, not the correct size"
1.0,These shoes are straight garbage and paper! I would send them back…but have to ride 30 minutes away to the nearest drop off site! So not worth the money….RUN!
1.0,The worst product I have ever purchased the sizing is way way off. I want my money back
1.0,"Not made of fleece, that's not what I expected 😒 7"
1.0,This doesn’t fit the watch well. It sticks out too far at the connection to provide a comfortable fit. Had it on the Instinct for about 30 seconds before going back to the original band.
1.0,"Hat fitip fine and lining was nice, however the first time hard was pulled on head the lining tore away from the hat in a 3 in area....the seam was was very poorly sewn....will not be able to ever wash it as the material will ravel....disappointed"
1.0,Like a toy from a bubble gum machine. Junk. Save your money.
1.0,"5""7' and 220 pounds and just too tight. :("
1.0,"Thought I would like the reversible option, but this just looked weird.  The boxy fit, darker striping on the sleeves, wasn’t what I expected.  At least the return was easy!"
1.0,Had to return was the fitting was off.
1.0,It fits everywhere perfectly except the sleeves they r 4 inches to long . I was gonna return it but I gave it to a homeless person instead
1.0,A meduim is more like XLarge & the shirt for girls says “boys”
1.0,It faded I cried
1.0,Lasted one year!
1.0,Broke a month after the return window expired. Don't get this.
1.0,"Loved it, till it broke apart and wasn't fixable."
1.0,Paw is very tiny & colors not bright and colorful at all!<br />Too expensive for the item
1.0,don't waste your money its not worth it
1.0,Nunca los recibí
1.0,"Not what it looks like in the pictures. You can’t read the words at all when it’s on, just looks like blah. “This” is the only word you can make out so it looks ridiculous. Doesn’t fit like it shows on the “models” is much longer than it implies. Wanted something different since I have to wear a mask. Waste of money unless you just want to look silly."
1.0,"What a waste of my time!  It’s a damn turtle neck, nothing at all like the pic.  Who would want a turtle neck??  What a joke!"
1.0,The fabric is cheap and the cut is more boxy than A line. I chose avoiding too waist size on the guide but found the waist to fit smaller. I would've sized up but still don't like the fabric or the cut.
1.0,The bill peeled back first day. Didn’t care enough to return and just threw it away. Very disappointed.
1.0,too big. Looks likesomething you can get from the dollar store
1.0,"Stitching came apart after first wash, literally was good for one use."
1.0,I ordered the outfit cause it was off the shoulder on the picture but when i received it it doesn't hang off the shoulder.I was very disappointed when i got it in the mail it was suppose to be one of my birthday outfits..I haven't wore it cause i didn't like how it's made. i could have gotten a outfit like that at Wal-Mart..
1.0,Los devovi ya que no los vi muy buena calidad
1.0,To little the size I thought was the right size looks like it fits a 1 year old.<br />Looking  for something  that fits a 9 year old. Who is tall.
1.0,Way too small! I ordered my mom 3 medium shirts for Mother's Day all from different companies. Two fit her perfectly but this one was so tight! I would put the medium closer to a small or even XS. I wish this had been a better quality because the design is really neat. I will check the quality better before buying next time!
1.0,Chain was too thin
1.0,Tarnished. Very cheap.  I would give it 0 stars
1.0,"Cord is too short,  Clips are not very sturdy.  The little black ball won't stay on.  Would not buy these again.  Not worth the money."
1.0,The collar looks like it was chewed up or something.. Terrible
1.0,I bought the black dress after I bought one of the flower pattern because I LOVED the flower pattern dress so much ...BUT the black dress is see through! The material is so cheap and you can see right through it! Do not waste your money! Horrible dress!
1.0,Returned. Not as pictured
1.0,"These are really poor quality. My son wore them twice and they already started coming apart around the toes. While I didn't expect them to last more than the summer, two days was really not worth the price."
1.0,Don’t buy - after one wear - color turned black on one is the earrings - can’t return so stuck with them -
1.0,Returned due to fit
1.0,"Thin, runs small"
1.0,the chain broke right when i went to put it on
1.0,"TERRIBLE! DO NOT BUY THESE! I got bit by a cat the first day wearing them and it punctured straight the gloves. The wound is not deep, but it is pretty terrible. I handle ferals and these made it impossible to scruff and too easy for a bite. Bad marketing and VERY dangerous to put out like they have."
1.0,These don't stay on my glasses and I spent too much time hooking them back on.
1.0,I'm not really of a fan of the slide it doesn't stay has to be tightened often
1.0,Ordered an XL for my husband and he can barely get them past his thigh. This might be a very small XL in kids. Product ships from Canada and cost more to return than it was to purchase. Going to see if one of my kids can wear them.
1.0,"Pretty in the picture, but its not true to size"
1.0,This is NOT sized for women! Ordered an XL. When I got it on it fit like I stole it from the pre teen department. Extremely disappointed and aggrevated!
1.0,"Jeans are much thinner than they appear, and material isn’t soft. Quick uncomfortable and too stretchy, I constantly have too pull them up bc they’re too big from the hips up. However almost to tight through out the legs."
1.0,Nice looking but poorly built. Clasp magnet has come apart after just a month’s use.
1.0,"Wow, I didn't realize I was claustrophobic until I put one of these shirts on.  I ALWAYS wear 16.5 neck, 34/35 sleeve or bigger, always a large skim fit.  That is what I ordered and that is what it says I received, but I couldn't even button the top buttons because it was so tight.  When it says slim fit, I think it means for a teenage boy.  I really wanted to get these shirts because of all the colors, but it is impossible to wear them.  I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review."
1.0,Incomplete set. Came with nothing in 2g. I cannot go from 4g to 0g. I am restreching but the last time I was 2 g was 6 or 7 years ago. Too big of a jump and dont want to tear my ears.  Everything was supposed to be black but some things are white with speckles. Not happy with this purchase at all.
1.0,This is horrible end of band keeps getting caught on everything my $4 one from “wish” is much better the end part tucks in against the wrist so it doesn’t get caught don’t know why these people didn’t make it that way
1.0,"Sent back. Though it was inexpensive, I did not expect a hole in the material."
1.0,I waited over a month for the item. And is very disappointed. It isn't a winter jacket it's crap
1.0,"I am giving very poor rating,it looks beautiful in the photo,but the quality is very cheap,"
1.0,"Way too thin, cheaply made. Don't waste your money."
1.0,"Loved this sweater.  The care instructions are to wash with like colors.  It says that it is 65% polyester 45% cotton, not sure that is correct.  Washed it in a washer bag so it was not in direct contact with the other color clothes and washed on cold.  When I pulled it out of the bag, it had shrunk to less than half the length.  IF you have purchased this, have it dry cleaned or get ready to throw it away.  Do disappointed.  Would not have given it any stars, but you have to do at least one to be able to submit."
1.0,This shirt was really short. It actually didn’t reach my daughter’s belly button and gapped at the neckline. The material was really thin and cheap; it tore after first wash.
1.0,Not at all what I was expecting.  Leather is paper thin!!!
1.0,I wanted genuine leather I got fake leather 😤
1.0,"The straps are VERY small. I have a medium size suit case and wanted the straps because I check this suitcase, it’s not a carry on. Straps barely fit. If you have a large suitcase - they won’t fit.<br />Shipped super fast!"
1.0,If i had to give negative then i would have given that when the package arrived we found that the belt is already used and it already has marks.i am going to return the product without opening the covering
1.0,Thought I would like and wear it but it looks cheap and I have never worn it out.
1.0,this garbage  should get  !!ZERO!!  Stars don’t waste your money. !!CHINESE CHEAP CRAP!!  $16+ dollars down the drain
1.0,"I bought a XXL (based on the description) when I normally wear a L or XL to have items fit really loose and this outfit would NOT fit my thin 14 year old daughter! The material was so see through and scratchy, I wouldn’t survive wearing it for 5 minutes! Even if it fit, I wouldn’t be able to wear it without driving me crazy. Save your money!"
1.0,"Terrible description, way way too small would not even fit on a standard dog tag chain let alone a gold chain. Possibly would fit on a piece of dental floss, highly disappointed."
1.0,Cheap looking and material is horrible on my opinion.
1.0,I have no comments my order had to be cancel coming out of Chia🌬🇨🇳
1.0,I wouldn’t buy this shirt again. It is way too small!
1.0,"I should have known it was cheap costume jewelry,  would send back, but not worth it"
1.0,The Zelotes mouse is malfunctioning in less than 2 years (never left my desk) and the usb backing cap is splitting in two. Also came with just one battery though there is a compartment requiring two. Emailed Seller with no response after 2 days. Disappointing. I would not recommend getting this product.<br /> Would not buy from Seller: Acecool
1.0,I am so mad. I got these for my niece under the impression they were real silver but they cant be. Her ears got so infected feom wearing them.
1.0,"The size on the thing says 34D. I'm 36C and this is smaller than even a B cup. WORST, there's so much padding that there's even less room for your actual breasts to fit. THEN the straps to go around the back are too short and tight, and when I finally got them on, one of the cups TORE away from the underwire. VERY DISPLEASED!!!"
1.0,Washed in cold water and dried for a short time on delicate cycle and the shirt basically shriveled up.
1.0,These jeans are far too small.  There is no way these jeans are size 8. Maybe a size 4. VERY disappointed!
1.0,"While I actually love the bracelet it has a very awful smell, I am unable to wear it because the smell is so bad. Even tried to Febreeze so I could wear it. Not successful."
1.0,I loved the print of this leotard. However this fit was pretty bad. Very loose at the top and Small at the bottom. We will return!
1.0,"I love 90 degrees by reflex leggings but the black pair I just received seem to be lower quality than previous ones I've ordered. I have 6 other pairs and have had black in the past and they are always high quality. However, the pair I just got now run smaller, and are see through even without bending over."
1.0,Ordered a XL got a M.... Idk
1.0,Too soft on the rubber clip vent holder
1.0,Product does not run true to size.
1.0,The color of the item shipped is not the color in the picture as advertised.
1.0,I can't even discuss how ridiculous is that
1.0,These shirts would get a 5 star review if they adjusted the arm area. It just hits an awkward spot under the arm.
1.0,"I ordered this product because it appeared to be the same as what I had previously purchased at Home Depot. Perhaps it is ... the box is identical. However, the product is not. My complaint is the product was poorly constructed and  easily breaks while performing what should be viewed as a minimal amount of use. For example, I was making meat loaf the other night and was wearing one of these gloves on each hand. As I was mixing and molding the meat loaf by hand, each glove breached whereby I had my thumb break through on one hand and a finger through the other ... literally split through the plastic. That is poor material and the advertising suggests other. This box absolutely, positively, could not be used in a restaurant for preparation. I would return it but I don't know if Amazon will accept it. I'll give it a try, anyway."
1.0,"I ordered this for my niece who loves Harry Potter.  I wanted the “I solemnly swear” quote.  I received a quote about “it takes a special person to be a pastor’s wife.”  While I completely see the humor, it was not what I ordered.  To make things worse, I didn’t realize that it was wrong and I ended up giving it to my niece.  We all had a very good laugh, but it was still the wrong gift.  So I take the blame for not looking before giving, but still, it was not what I ordered."
1.0,You need to size up like 2 sizes. They where so tight I could barley get them over my thigh.
1.0,Zero stars if possible! Watch fell apart the first day worn! I tried to piece it back together myself (approx 2 hours) and it fell apart again. Returning and getting a refund. Dont waste your time.
1.0,"My calf hurts every time I wear these booths, I taught I was imagining things but I changed boot just to see, the pain stop immediately, I try this boot again and within minutes my calf started cramping again."
1.0,Thin fabric very clingy XL fits M at best
1.0,"Do not look very aesthetical, specially the front side. Fafric looks cheap."
1.0,"Flimsy, no support, fabric wasn’t even cut right so one side was looser than the other. I tried it on, took it right off and tossed into my “give away” clothing collection"
1.0,"This product looks like fabric on the website, but in reality it's some kind of funky plastic stuff. It wasn't as cute as I thought, so I'm sending it back. If the descriptions were more accurate, like actually describing the content of the fabric (y'know...poly, or cotton, or whatever) I might have known better."
1.0,the colors are nothing like it is shown online!! Super ugly!!
1.0,Product was yoo small . Not properly meaured for whisker.
1.0,Gave these to my nice for a Christmas present ! As soon as she put them in her ear the post broke off of the first one she put in ! Never again ! Broke her heart and mine !
1.0,It's literally an oversized white-beater... not very impressed at all.
1.0,I don't know who reviewed this. The material was awful. Scratchy skirt and no matter how I tried to steam it - it would not lay correctly the way the picture showed. It was sown incorrectly. RETURNED
1.0,Wore these to and from Greece.  My ankles swelled the size of grapefruits on the way back.
1.0,Los encajes que tiene sobre los pechos es muy duro y molesta…
1.0,Zipper was defective totally disappointed
1.0,Wasn’t what I expected. I brought a XL and it fits like a Small.
1.0,"Apart from buying these as a gift, there is little reason or opportunity to wear these. Poor gift giving on my part to the misfortune of not realizing how tacky these were despite being based on an interesting concept. They are the type of earrings you see in-store one time with a glancing eye then never think about again for the rest of your life. Underwhelming and drastically shortsighted of me."
1.0,It was way too small for my head even though it was labeled as adult size. It barely fit my four year old grandsons head.
1.0,The dress they sent wasnt even close to the dress picture. Completely different style. No swing skater dress. I was sent this bodycon cocktail dress. Not the orange I wanted but this wine red color. Dont buy. False advertising!!!!! Not happy.
1.0,Cheap looking scarf.
1.0,"I was so sad, I bought the floral hoping for a fun summer dress...It fits my entire body fine accept the bust is completely too small for anyone. It cuts my boobs in half...Super disappointed"
1.0,"I am disappointed because it didn’t look the same as shown in the picture...I mean the quality look!<br />The fabric material is good for making a blouse not for that style of the dress.<br /><br />Since I ordered 2 dresses same style. I did not try on the yellow dress arrived one day behind the pink dress because I had tried on the pink dress, it didn’t look good on me ( 5’ - 105lbs - 34C cup bra - waist line 29”)<br />I’m sorry for writing not good on your product. Just for your feed back only!"
1.0,"nothing in the sleeves to loop up with the metal loop on the outside elbow. also, very frumpy. fabric is rough and see through. do not rec. sorry :/"
1.0,"Looks nice, but that's all that's nice about it...only lasted 2 months. The black case holding it is a piece of crap!! Slowly broke apart until finally my phone flopped out. I'm very careful with my phone so it's not a case of rough handling.<br /><br />Also, the picture on it, I got the marauders map. It's very out of focus.<br /><br />Anyway, don't waste your money on this piece of junk, IT WON'T LAST!!!!"
1.0,Every zipper broke within 3rd time of using it.
1.0,"Item pictured is not item received, shows double clasp in top, has only one. &#34;Padding&#34; in top is a floating pad inside a huge pocket and is not structured as show in the picture. 18/20 size top fits like 24, bottoms fit better, but pooch at the sides oddly. This suit is a waste if money."
1.0,"Para nada te levanta los senos,, alcontrario te los aplasta... no son nada de cómodos y cuestan un poco para ponérselos"
1.0,These are way too small. There is no option to return them. I can't wear them but can't return them either. I was looking for an extra large pair of leg warmers these are for children.
1.0,too mushy 😞
1.0,Ordered white they weren't white and heard threads popping just to get my 7 year old heel through the bottoms.
1.0,I didn’t like anything about these. They don’t work
1.0,"These are not women's size. I am 5'5&#34; and they are tiny gloves for children. Maybe good for an Easter outfit for a 7 year old girl, definitely not an adult."
1.0,"Horrible pants, don’t buy."
1.0,The print of the material is upside down. It’s beautiful but made this apron incorrectly.
1.0,It's see through in the back of swimsuit
1.0,Cheap like paper material runs really small
1.0,"Gets stuck on the watch, cant take it off"
1.0,Not authentic whatsoever... I have several Lokai's and this one is 100% a fake.
1.0,Different than the one I had
1.0,The small font isn’t even printed fully and the large font is even blurry..<br />don’t wait the month for this one. Pay the extra $5 for one of the better versions.
1.0,Color did NOT match the pic. I wanted khaki. Got hideous gold....... What I wanted to replace on the left. What I got on the right.
1.0,"Be careful; the word &#34;small&#34; is misleading.  These glasses are as large as my husband's everyday glasses and he is a large man.  Bought two pair because they were described as small and another reviewer described them as looking like little kid glasses.  A waste, will never wear.  The company responded indifferently."
1.0,The bracelet itself is very good looking but a little bit bulky to thick.
1.0,"Man, it’s a good thing I sew because I’m going to have to perform surgery on this skirt.. the unfinished hem is ridiculously uneven, the stitching is so lose and wonky I’d be afraid to sneeze without the skirt deteriorating off me.<br />Cheaply made, cheap material. Just cheap all the way around.<br />Not worth the price that’s for sure!"
1.0,they came broken and didn't have time to return them
1.0,They sent me a gold one I ordered a silver one??? I’ve contacted them several times. And no help very disappointed!!!! Ring is the right size looks good but wrong color!! And I would just like my $ back!!! Russell fraley
1.0,I had to exchange three times and each time the color varied and size was inconsistent. Horrible material.
1.0,"These run so small I couldn’t even get the XL over my head. I’m a 38G-H who wears an XL in shirts, and there’s no way this would contain the girls. I’m not even sure the 3XL would fit me. These would make cute training bras for tiny preteens though."
1.0,"Item broken out the box, didnt even stretch it to try it on was not attached when package opened."
1.0,Sequence fell off before I wore it!!!!!!
1.0,"Must have been designed for a little girl to dress up her Barbie, not for a full grown human woman."
1.0,Not sturdy material. Feels like its made of aluminum.
1.0,"What you receive is not what’s pictured. I received a shirt labeled medium (was suppose to be one size) and was so small it wouldn’t fit my 10 year old. Save your money, I returned."
1.0,I was not happy with this cost the quality very poor buttons fell off very easily.
1.0,Terrible.  Cheap.  But they did refund my money quickly!
1.0,Returned! You get what you pay for.
1.0,Way to small. I had to return.
1.0,"I am dissatisfied, the black pants after my daughter wore once all the elastic is showing through in the butt! Now she can’t wear them unless her shirt is really long"
1.0,"The LEDs stopped working after about 5-6 hours….full batteries, tight connections on cords, no lights. Waste of money."
1.0,Too big for a nose ring. But works great for the top of an ear piercing in cartlige
1.0,It was poorly made. It came broken I guess you get what you pay for it was inexpensive so I wasn't out much money.
1.0,"This dress was listed as 95% cotton, 5% spandex. The tag inside the dress is 100% polyester. The dress is VERY thin fabric. It is also not very full without a petticoat & doesn't seem like it would support that.<br />I ordered the off white butterfly print & it's more like a light yellow.<br />Ultimately I am returning for size and quality, as well as color preference."
1.0,"Pray doesn't keep fog away. After 1 hour of using spray to the directions given, glasses fog right back up."
1.0,pieces were missing
1.0,"These jeans are absolutely hideous. I'm 5'4"" tall and 113 lbs. I ordered the Small, and they're swimming on me. There is NOTHING 'skinny' about these jeans. They're an ugly gray fade (not black) and fit like sweatpants. They come to well above my ankle, and I'm only 5'4""! The model they used has legs FAR longer than mine, so these should have been closer to my ankles, but they weren't. If you're tall, these will look ridiculous.<br /><br />I do NOT recommend these jeans. They look nothing like the photos, and I'll be asking Vine to please remove them from my account, so I don't have to pay taxes on these ugly pants that are clearly different than what is being advertised."
1.0,Wayyyy too small! Made my boobs look weird and cut off not cute
1.0,0 STARS THEY MADE ME SELECT 1 to submit<br />They don’t fit in the frame very tight. Not worth anything at all. The lenses are .015 thousand thinner than original lenses causing the lenses to sag out of the frames.
1.0,"These had loose stitching right out of the bag on multiple areas. The material feels cheap, metal clasp vs button bends. The zipper to the back is very sharp and unprotected.<br /><br />The rear pocket zipper WILL damage / scratch leather seats! I damaged my nice car seat for these cheap pants.<br /><br />I would suggest buying just the padded inserts and getting some nicer quality shorts vs this package. I thought this would bring value, but the quality just isn’t there."
1.0,Sizes are not True US sizes
1.0,Hideous! Did not look like the pic. Returned
1.0,Dont buy this. They are NOT sterling silver at all. Dont waste your time nor money. Tarnished in a week and turned yellow. They're cheap for a reason!!
1.0,They are too big but claim to be small/medium. I always wear a small and these are too long.
1.0,"I have been wearing Vanity Fair pants for at least 40 years, and I have never run into a problem like this one.  The side seams for two of the pants were very uneven making the pants feel weird and uncomfortable.  There was a two and one half inch  difference between the two sides.  These are seconds and should have been labeled and priced as such.  I will keep the one normal set and throw away the other two.  I feel as though I have been cheated."
1.0,"never got the chance to try other lenses frame broke after only six times used, unfolded arms and frame broke near middle very poorly made."
1.0,I order a XL feel like I got a medium
1.0,Brown  yellow color. Not the color that I  feel is pictured.
1.0,Purchased to wear to Gatlinburg for New Years  which turned out to be way to hot when we got there for anything warm so I just now got to wear it yesterday and today and when hanging it back up I noticed the zipper is already broken and comes apart without unzipping. Unfortunate the month return window shows closed but I’ll be reaching out because anything that only holds up for one wear isn’t worth purchasing. Fit is as expected and great if you like your stuff to tear up after wearing out one time
1.0,Love the look and feel of this watch. I thought was water resistant to 30m. Was in pool 1 time and moisture inside face no longer able to read. Thought was going to be a great watch.
1.0,Too small don't like the dangle on the back don't fits right
1.0,This was intended to replace a broken pair. These were not the same. These are not as dark.
1.0,"The coat was wrinkled and too tight on my arms but fit everywhere else. However, if my arms don't fit then I need to acquit. It's currently sitting in my closet collecting dust. Maybe I'll lose 50 pounds by next winter so my money won't be wasted."
1.0,"This product is not a slouch beanie. It's a standard beanie. My wife is petite and the item received was fitted to her head. Just found out, returns are not allowed. Lowered review to 1 star from 2. As regular beanie it's attractive enough."
1.0,"It's not steel.Chrome peels off in less than a month.Compartment is way too loose,anything stored may leak out,not good access either.Requires removing the ring."
1.0,Not true to size at all then I wasn’t able to return so out 60 bucks
1.0,"gave this to my daughter who is 4, she is the only one one who can fit them on her fingers; i presumed they were adjustable but I was wrong."
1.0,Photo is great and shirt looks cute. Looks cheap and somewhat childish in person
1.0,I ordered this band to replace the rubber one that came with the Fitbit. It’s much more attractive and makes the Fitbit look like a nice piece of jewelry. . It is easy to put on and take off and came with a little tool to adjust the size.<br />Since I wrote the review I am changing my opinion of this band. It has not held up to normal wearing. The metal portion where it attaches to the Fitbit is wearing off so that now there’s bare metal where it used to be black. I’m retired and don’t do any kind of heavy labor that would cause this to happen. It’s just poor quality.
1.0,The neck warmer is nice and soft but it pills horribly.  I already washed it a couple of times and the pilling is still non stop.  (0.o)
1.0,"It shows the ""Black"" dress that I ordered as having a Periwinkle Blue style skirt w/ a Navy Blue background. Mine looks like a blurry grey-ish White w/ a black background. It just looks like the colors bled- not cute. Fabric is almost see through. Pockets are teeny tiny, maybe 1 3/4"" deep and wide. I eventually had to use a safety pin just to keep my badge from falling out during work. Not a happy camper."
1.0,"Very poor looking necklace, I returned right away. When you received and open the package you can see the poor material."
1.0,The dress pulled in strange ways
1.0,"I bought this shirt as a July 4th shirt.  It is cheaply made, runs small, and no matter how you wear it, it looks bad. Keep looking."
1.0,"I am pretty mad about this product. I bought these gloves because I had a Bachelorette Party and I wanted to look fancy for the theme. When I opened them I knew right away that I was tricked. The fabric IS NOT SATIN! And it's low quality fabric and low quality sewing.<br /><br />So if you want a satin gloves don't buy these. They are horrible, but you can give them to your niece when she has a Halloween Party and wants to dress as a witch, nothing fancy or pretty."
1.0,I use only one time
1.0,VERY thin I was very disappointed for the price I paid.
1.0,"My problem is with the description and the picture not aligning. The picture depicts 2 plugs, but the item is sold as 1 plug. Who wears 1 plug? Unless your getting a replacement. That should be better emphasized, its a bit deceptive. Anyway, I have 1 okay looking plug."
1.0,I’m a size D to which I purchased and received a size C. It sucks and gives no support ugh such a waste of money ☹️
1.0,Ordered the yellow plaid skirt in an XL. I am usually a size 8 in bottoms. The skirt barely fit around my thigh 😶
1.0,"I received this product on November 2nd, 2018.  It's nice looking and made with good quality materials, but as seemed hard to put on I didn't try it immediately; just on November 24th I tried to use it to take my baby out from home. My baby is 12 months old not chubby at all and I ordered the 18 months size, but when I tried it on my baby, this suit was long in legs and arms as expected but I couldn't close the zipper on his chest, terrible it's is extremely narrow. This suit should be wide enough to be worn over the clothes but not even wearing only one shirt was possible to close it.  I immediately requested the return and when I finished writing the reasons the system showed me a message saying I had to wait 48 hours for the seller's response. Today after 5 days waiting, I decided to check my email to see if had missed the response; as I didn't find anything I checked the return status on my amazon account and what a surprise the return request had disappeared. Immediately called amazon and they said there was not any track of my request and emailed the seller; just after couple minutes I received a response and the seller said the return could not be approved because under amazon's policy my 30 days to return the product had expired yesterday. Unbelievable, it was so convenient for this seller that my request mysteriously disappeared and mysteriously again, when I accessed to ""your orders"" to leave this review I couldn't find the link ""write a product review"" just the link ""leave seller feedback"". Again, had to call amazon to send me a link to write this. 100% money lost and not reliable seller."
1.0,The band lasted for half day then my watch fell off and I almost lost it at the store.
1.0,The color is a stronger red than shown (expected more of a burgundy shade). It’s also tight around the electric waistband and really short. I am 6’1; but it hits about mid-shin. It also sits higher in the back than it does in the front.. which was weird since that’s not what the photo shows.
1.0,Too small - major disappointment
1.0,it broke the second I put it on it is very cheap
1.0,Wore it twice and the strap broke
1.0,"I got the 2 pack hoping that I would be set for all of my back less tops. The sticky side is not sticky enough to stay on UNLESS you are wearing a tight top. Not worth the buy, as I am disappointed."
1.0,this product was very cheaply made.
1.0,"Sadly, this is a good idea, but a poor design. I had better luck using them putting them on upside down. The frame is in the way of where your hand needs to be to apply your makeup."
1.0,"When commparing the price to the quality, it hardly matches... despite the adorable apearance, it’s definitely not something I would buy again."
1.0,I can’t print out the label to send it back since it too small. I tried to have a label sent to me but never came! Then I tried to get a 30 percent refund and keep them but that didn’t happen. So I’m not very happy. I’ll try to find someone skinny to give them to. Not want to do this again!
1.0,"When I unsnapped this belt to put a buckle on it the snaps broke in half instead of unsnapping, making the belt totally useless."
1.0,"The item came on time for vacation, but it didn't fit anything like the image. I was in a rush to leave so I did not attempt to send it back so I turned it into a headscarf."
1.0,"Looked great fit good at first but after washing, wearing several times they stretched out hilariously and turned an impossible gross dirty gray, bleach nor OXI had any effect on them what so ever. I have other brands of white socks I washed with them and they remained bright white. Terrible product! Do not buy!!!!! And to make matters even funnier I only have one foot, so it's not as if I wore them out."
1.0,"Although they look pretty, every pair I've worn broke the 1st time I even put them on. Needless to say they are very poorly made."
1.0,Had to return instantly. Would advise against this purchase
1.0,"The sweater I received was a full length cardigan, very disappointed!"
1.0,Too big and really uncomfortable. Had to sew it after using just for a day.
1.0,"I'm 5'3 and 110lbs, this dress was too long, and the arms were too wide. The fabric was weird too very thick and uncomfortable."
1.0,"Go get leggings from the brand Ewedoos<br /> They are my favorite leggings I have EVER found. They have pockets and come in a million colors. They fit amazing and make you look so good.I have like 10 pairs. I wear them every day and should gave known better than to try something else<br /><br />This set is horrible. I got it in black. Too small and too big at the same time. I am 5'11"" and weigh 200.  However, I carry my weight well and have a waist. I wear M and S in shirt sizes (D Cup bra) and M or L (usually M because L fits but arent tight enough)  in leggings. The bra part of this was fine-ish . The jacket sleeves were loose and too long while the bottom of the jacket was almost too tight.  The leggings were absolutely HORRIBLE.  SEE THROUGH.. AND SO DAMN TIGHT in the high waist area, but the compression starts too high up so it makes your abdomen and fupa area bulge out ridiculously, when it doesnt even look like that normally.  I have no idea how this fits anyone else or looks good .. i mean , i see their pictures , but i dont understand why my set is like this."
1.0,When my package arrived the crown was broken
1.0,Deforma el busto
1.0,I ordered the smallest size at it would fit a one year old. Wayyy too big! Not accurate sizing at all.
1.0,I ordered a size 8. I received a size 5/6. Had to use them for a costume so they had to be worn and they was snug.
1.0,"Looks like a nightgown, not a cover up."
1.0,The quality is terrible! The second pair of shoes ripped the day we got a replacement!!
1.0,Dollar store quality.
1.0,"While the leather seemed to handle well, the fabric on the inside seemed fragile and poorly stitched.  The stitching's located around the shoulder area gave away after a weeks usage, and upon arrival in the mail, the linings of the lower pockets were loose.  For the price paid, can't expect a better tailored jacket."
1.0,Came way way to big go like 2 sizes down it is super big don’t like it
1.0,Poor quality and material I returned it
1.0,"Should have read the reviews first. Just like these other people, the writing on mine is cut off too."
1.0,Does not look anything like the picture. The color is very different.
1.0,"These earrings are not actually as colorful as they look, they are actually quite dull. They ate also MUCH smaller than they look in the mannequin. The pictures are quite misleading."
1.0,"Returned, quality not what I expected"
1.0,"Although a kick ass boot love the style how it goes over the knee .... it falls !!,it doesnt stay there it looks stupid dont buy this bc its cheap spend a little more and buy a boot that will stay up"
1.0,Not worth the low cost. Every pair had a lens defect where the label was placed on the plastic wrap covering the glasses. It was not removable.
1.0,PACKAGE CAME INFESTED WITH SPIDERS ON THE INSIDE... i understand they cannot control things inside of boxes but my bag came infested with spiders crawling inside the socks...
1.0,Very long and very narrow. Disappointed
1.0,"Insatisfecha, el modelo del color nude, no es el mismo al del color negro."
1.0,It broke after a week.
1.0,Started to fall apart within several months of purchase
1.0,Definitely not a wide calf fit.  I couldn’t even make it halfway zipped up.
1.0,"I have a big booty so the back ruffle lifts to much, also the bra fits to big like it's so high up so I have to lift my boobs and the still didn't look right."
1.0,It was broken. Would've put it back together and still wore it but could not.
1.0,Too small could not return
1.0,Cheaply made. Don't bother. Also came with damage and they will not take the product back. Really?!?!
1.0,"Stitches on both pockets started to detach after 30 minutes of wear. Also, the large is more like a medium. I guess that's what I get for buying cheap stuff. On the bright side, its super soft, so there's that...."
1.0,Did not like the fit fabric. Sent back.
1.0,"This outfit was almost $20 and all we received were the shorts. Now, I don't know how to get this order fixed. It probably would have been cute if the top would have come with the set. My daughter is really disappointed."
1.0,I lost my watch because of this band. Do not recommend
1.0,Cheap quality.  All three broke in same place
1.0,Irritated that it’s not all purple like the photo shows
1.0,Very poor quality. Plastic cracked first time Fitbit was inserted.  Stiff band.  Uncomfortable.  The band came apart on the third wearing!<br /><br />Not worth the time or money to return. A disappointment
1.0,"Considering the price of this bag, I expected much better quality materials.  The straps are cheap vinyl and the bag is some kind of spongy synthetic material that smells bad.  It looks so cute in the photo but it looks so cheap in reality.  I cannot recommend this product."
1.0,The band I received is not the same one as the picture shows. It is a good quality and all but not the band I thought I ordered. Color is a little less rose gold than I expected but it is not overly shiny or gawdy either....but not the same band so I don’t know what the actual band looks likes.
1.0,I bought some awesome James Fiallo grey and black socks six months ago that were extremely comfortable from here:<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071F42T2F/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />I was expecting these to be the same in all black but they are a completely different and uncomfortable fishnet like material.
1.0,"Greatly disappointed. Not at all as pictured. Waited 2 months. Print is dull, fuzzy, and colors are indistinguishable. Returning."
1.0,"Oh my gosh! I'm short and plus-sized and was expecting this to be loose and flowy, but it is HUGE! And, the wrong color. It's maxi-length, the model must be 7 feet tall for it to come up above her knees. The color is pretty and the fabric is nice (I thought it'd be thinner though) but the fit is very very different."
1.0,"super cheap material, smelled weird, did NOT sit like the picture. Was very stiff from the cheapness of the fabric"
1.0,Is very nice but the ties think one is more longe than the other one and I can’t put on
1.0,"The badge is more of a shiny shade of purple than black and even less tolerable is the ""gray"" design that's actually pink.<br /><br />Pink!"
1.0,There is a rip in the front where the seethrough black meets the blue fabric or it was never sewn which looks likely. Because of this-wearing it will pull and rip that area more.  It looks like it has great potential if just a little more care was put into making it.
1.0,Nothing like it was described.  Complete ripoff!!
1.0,Thinnest material ever. Not what I expected whatsoever. Very loose.
1.0,Looks nice but useless<br />Fastening device is junk<br />Don't bother buying<br />Fell off five times in first hour<br />Already in my junk drawer after one day
1.0,not a good quality
1.0,"The bottom is too lose and hangs away from the body, so that you can see into the swimsuit. I returned it."
1.0,Doesn't fit anybody. Not even 4yr old child.
1.0,"The band broke after only 3 months the vendor indicated they would replace the band. After several emails note requesting my mailing address they disappeared, no replacement or reply. The band is very stiff and not a great purchase."
1.0,La verdad es horrible por dentro y a la primer lavada muchísimo peor
1.0,Sleeves are not as pictures in photos. The black wavy material is actually clear shiny cheap looking material that makes the dress look bad.
1.0,The ax did not fit in the package and the package has stains all over it. Very disappointing as this was a gift and now I have to return it.
1.0,Too much pattern
1.0,I know they didn’t cost a lot of money but it’s still very poor quality I will never buy these again
1.0,"I bought a black pair of these x-back Better S-Penders suspenders from Bailey's. I am tall and the suspenders were adequately sized, however, the leather reinforcement at the crossing of the x, in back, was sewn on in a fashion that caused the suspenders to be wrinkled up and uncomfortable to sit and lean back against. After returning them, I went to a logging supply store in Medford, Oregon and surveyed their collection of these suspenders and found that they all were, likewise, sewn askew.<br /><br />Whoever is running their quality control, should note that the apexes of the diamond-shaped, reinforcing leather should be aligned along the vertical axis defined by the junction of the suspenders rather than simple plopping down the leather and sewing it aligned with the edges of one strap of the suspender. It makes a difference. If you don't know what I mean, just look at some Filson suspenders which are correctly reinforced and, therefore, don't wrinkle uncomfortably on the back.<br /><br />I suppose, if you never set down and relaxed, choosing to only use these suspenders when you were on your feet, the ""wrinkling"" of the straps would make no difference. I hope that Better S-Penders iron out their quality issue, as the other qualities of these suspenders look like they could really last out. They are selling them at a reasonable price, but until there is improvement in construction, I'll buy elsewhere.<br /><br />I'll update this review if I notice a future change in their construction quality."
1.0,"hate it!  it is very small.  the material is much shorter than it appears in the picture.  even if this fit me it would not have come to my thighs.  it is not made for woman, it is mor for a child or teen."
1.0,Fabric for pants is a stiff cotton. Not a soft pajama fabric
1.0,Doesn't look anything like the picture and is made with super cheap fabric
1.0,"was looking forward to getting this comfortable dress..it came in later than expected. Color is not the same mustard yellow as shown, but more of a pale yellow. Returned."
1.0,"It is purple, not wine like the picture"
1.0,"Beautiful chain,  deceiving picture. Make sure you know your sizes!"
1.0,Way to small even ordered 2 sizes up!
1.0,Glasses are flimsy with no support. It will fall off your face and moving the entire time.
1.0,"Opened it up, it came in a zip lock bag, took it out of the bag and it fell apart, no clasp what so ever....poorly designed and not worth a penny and it seems odd to me that people wrote reviews a page long with so much detail....seems very odd......don't waste your time with this piece of junk"
1.0,The slipper was really cute. But the size was wrong so they was to little. And I order her size
1.0,"Charms are cute, but did not fit on crocs at all!!! I tried to force them in but they don’t stay in place. My daughter has already lost 3. Don’t waste your money."
1.0,Perdió el color muy rápidamente
1.0,The product is very cheap.  It bent as soon as I tried to attach it to the ring and would not grasp.
1.0,"Short & see through, very dissatisfied with this"
1.0,This is resin with glitter and would be ok for the price but it covers up the silver detailing of the shell of the turtle. Don’t bother.
1.0,The necklace was actually broke and disassembled before I even opened the bag.
1.0,Only on of them came
1.0,"theres a small tear on the leg side, not noticeable but will cause a whole when used again and washed."
1.0,"Lame cheap feel, typical China product. Batteries fall out easy, but the lights are really bright. In fact the flashing mode makes me feel like I'm going to have a seizure. The mechanism or the batteries are at is not well hidden at all. A novelty for 11 dollars, my kid put them on once and never use them again."
1.0,"I couldn’t keep this in for more than 2 days. It hurt going in, it hurt while it was in, and it hurt coming out. Holy uncomfortable. Do not recommend."
1.0,"The scarf shawl is very thin. While I understand I did not pay much for this product $14.99 however; I did feel that it could be thicker, softer and not like it came from China, cheap and run through a mill.  It's thin, strings hanging from it, I can actually see through it.  I would not buy again."
1.0,"The pictures are great in the advertisment, however, hardly no difference at night, may even make seeing worse,  I would send them back but don't want to pay more money for shipping. Nough said"
1.0,I got an infection within a day of having this ring in and have had my navel pierced for over ten years without ever having issues
1.0,It fit ok and comfortable enough. I like it but not the color I needed for 2 particular outfits I wanted it for. Going back as I already have 2 others in forest green. Stated as green under photo.
1.0,This product was a disappointment. The bras are very pretty but they were D cups and not the DDD cups that I ordered. I will not order anything else from this seller!!!
1.0,Ran small and was cheaply made.
1.0,It got stuck on my watch and i have not been able to get it off even months later... I hate it
1.0,This dress was comically too big. The back had a weird cut that made the entire torso loose.
1.0,this is the most AWFUL thing i have ever ordered on line . i should have tried them on when i got them.it is too late to return them  i tried to give them away  no one wanted them
1.0,"A piece a garbage. Supposedly water proof, and it is not. I had it for ten days. It’s completely drowned."
1.0,"Cheaply Made, Threads hanging around bottom, Smells like it was dipped in Pine-Sol...."
1.0,The kids love them play wither all the time.  Worked wonderful great for kid to play with. Would by again
1.0,"Way too small.  So bummed, as I really liked the concept with the adjustable length. Am returning."
1.0,"Me llegaron solo dos de las tres que debe traer la compra, además la banda es muy rígida, aúnq el material se ve bueno, hice un reclamo pero no fue atendido"
1.0,They very NOT Safe!!! I did not like them. Do not waste your money. Not what I expected.
1.0,"Did not fit like a dress,  too short  it came just bellow my waist."
1.0,Awful fit! I had to give it to someone who wears a small and even that was pushing it!
1.0,These barely fit my 14 month old's fingers.  They are SO DARN TINY they are not for fingers as shown in the picture.
1.0,I used these for about 5 times already. And they still cause the ball of my foot a lot of pain while I cycle with good form. I would expect me to get used to them by now but the pain is so unbearable. These are probably great shoes for others but not for me.
1.0,"I ordered 3XL because my waist is 44-46. These DID NOT even come close to fitting. It's a medium at the very best.  If you are a medium, order 3XL is about the only thing I can say."
1.0,"Ugly, never wear it"
1.0,The cut is nothing like the shirt it makes you look pregnant
1.0,More of a tshirt than a shirtdress
1.0,"Do not stay on face, slide down while your talking"
1.0,"The vest was to big, it said small but it wasn't"
1.0,Not for women over 5'3 I would say based on the waistline placement
1.0,DOES NOT MATCH PHOTO! CHEAP QUALITY!
1.0,Tiny stones fell off almost immediately- not hypoallergenic!
1.0,"I wear a size 6, and the actual shoe fit. But the heel strap was way too small. I'm guessing you're supposed to wrap it around your ankle, then buckle it, but mine didn't even reach the buckle after doing so. I'm 5'4, 170 lbs, so it'll probably be fine if you have super thin ankles"
1.0,I received my order alright.  An EMPTY pouch with nothing on the inside.  Can't believe I paid so much for an EMPTY pouch!!
1.0,Earring was broken upon arrival and all pieces were scratched up.  Looked used but was in new packaging.  Certainly child size.  Earrings are clip on.
1.0,This band was super cute. I love the style but it broke in less than a week. Don't waste your money.
1.0,These never didn’t leak and fogged up after 3 days.
1.0,"Super cheap quality and not at all like picture, had abolsutely no shape to it, just hung like a potato sack. Returned immediately."
1.0,Junk worth maybe 1.00
1.0,Nothing like in the photos that it showed. It is big and doesn’t hold the pieces well at all.
1.0,Ring turned colors after just one use of wearing.
1.0,This watch wouldn't fit a 10 year old girl's wrist. The ad misrepresents the actual size. I'm very disappointed and returning it.
1.0,"Arrived broken at the clasp, returned for refund"
1.0,Unable to attach
1.0,Hope it shows up my head cold
1.0,This is now the ugliest thing I own.
1.0,I gave these to my daughter the beginning of August and they have already broke!
1.0,"Product not made of good quality, very thin , tried to wear them 5 times, does not fit well, waste of money to purchase them."
1.0,I loved this sweater as soon as I saw it but I am so disappointed. I originally ordered a small but had to return because the sleeves didn’t even come close to my wrist. So I returned it and got a medium. It fit fine at first but as the day went on it just got baggy in a non flattering way. I only wore this sweater 1 day to an indoor birthday party and there are pulled strings everywhere I counted 9 spots. The sweater looks like something I’ve had for years. I had such high hopes that I could wear this sweater all winter and now I doubt it will last that long.
1.0,This bracelet is a wish. com  version of an Original MountInspire design. A small business that designed this years ago and sell on Etsy.
1.0,I threw them away. Large and gaudy.
1.0,"I wear an xLarge shirt. Ordered this in a 2x and it’s still too small. Very disappointed, I love the shirt."
1.0,This band broke as soon as I tried to put it on my iwatch.
1.0,I bought the blue with the navy stripes... that’s not what I received. I received some kind is flowed on the pockets....
1.0,When is China going to get pur sizes right?
1.0,"A Blogger that I follow had this dress so I gave it a try, it came in looking kind a like a hospital gown, and then I washed it and it shrunk like four or 5 inches and now it looks like a weird hospital shirt. So I will be giving this away"
1.0,"just don't get them, believe me. do not fulfill their main function"
1.0,They are too small they don’t fit in my nose right !!
1.0,I order a size large but if it's small doesn't look exactly like the picture but they tried to make it look it's best probably won't order again from them
1.0,"Very poor quality product. Constantly shedding. After one wash the robe was ruined. It appeared very scraggly, loose threads were visible. Poor fitting."
1.0,I am normally a medium and that was the size I purchased.  It was too tight.  The fabric was not soft on the skin
1.0,"The sizing is totally off, did not fit my 2year old"
1.0,It was damage but I don't want to retuned it if I have to pay for shipping again!
1.0,The iron on logo just doesnt go with a Corvette. If this had embroidered logo's it would be petfect. The size seemed oversized for a 2x. If it had the embroidered logo's i would purchase a XL.
1.0,"handle broke within 12 hours on my vacation with just a beach towel, sunscreen, flip flops and a bottled water in the bag.........very disappointed."
1.0,"Love this jacket's fit and feel but unfortunately, the other reviews are correct about the zipper issues.  I went through a couple of these jackets thinking the zipper issue on mine was a fluke.  However, each jacket has only lasted a few months before the zipper started to tear away from the jacket, which made it useless.  I do not recommend this product."
1.0,I probably didn't read the description but this thing is tiny.
1.0,"Disappointed. It's not the ""slouchy"" material as stated or looks like in image. Not tapered. It's that heavy weighted silky stuff that body suits are typically made of. Not light weight at all. Also, in pictures you see a thick cute spaghetti strap, when you get it's just the boring typical spaghetti straps. Also seam thread visible. Just not at all like pictures.<br /><br />Also, I believed the comments that it runs small, it runs on size or larger. I ordered ""true to size"" according to size chart and it's definitely too big."
1.0,Does not fit a man's face.<br />Washing instructions are to only soak mask in distilled wster.
1.0,"(This is Brad's wife)  These are dumb, I ended up just taking mine out completely... they're way way too long and pretty cheaply made, although I should have expected that with the price. They're really impractical and uncomfortable."
1.0,"So disappointed.  Arrived with a LARGE pull dead center in the back of the sweater. Description said 70% cotton; I don't know what the material is as there is NO label anywhere in the garment, but it is NOT cotton. Also,  NOT batwing sleeves, as several comments mentioned, which was ok, as it fit well and true to size. If it HAD been cotton, and had not arrived as described as above, it would be great.....alas, no."
1.0,"so I am not sure if this happened to other people but this is most certainly not sterling silver as I had a massive allergic reaction. I wear silver jewelry all of the time without a problem. That being said it is super cute and with some adjustment fit securely in my ear. If you don't have allergies to cheap metals this ear cuff will be fine, if you are sensitive like me do not get this cuff. It was so cheap though it isn't even worth trying to return."
1.0,"The collar started coming off the third time I wore it.  Did I hang it on a hook? Nope.  Was I rough with it in any way? Nope.  It’s just poorly made.  What’s worse the “return window” closed after 30 days.  So unless you’re in the habit of wearing the same sweater daily, you’d never know until it’s too late. Total scam."
1.0,"Its pretty and soft but the &#34;s-l&#34; is really a small. So tight, couldnt breathe."
1.0,Real cheap crap!! Turned darker color after 4 days.
1.0,"Well, unfortunately I have to update my review.  These slippers were awesome when I first wore them.  I've been wearing the consistently for about 2 weeks now and they are no longer plush and have no cushion at all.  They are completely flat.  If you buy these, don't expect them to last."
1.0,Did not fix at all
1.0,Lasted 4 months ... cracked at top of nose bridge and fell apart at attachment point
1.0,These are not REAL!! Please Don't buy!!  TRUST ME THIS IS AN OLD NAVY FLIP FLOP.. THEY BROKE IN LESS THAN A MONTH!!
1.0,"This dress was awful and after I returned it I got charged a $4 restocking fee. Ridiculous, I do not recommend purchasing at all."
1.0,First time I washed this the dark purple dye came off onto the lavender dye and ruined the sleep shirt.  So bummed.  I wash all new clothes alone thank God or it would have ruined my other items.
1.0,"I always wear a large, so I bought a large. It was so small I couldn’t even fit it over my head"
1.0,Shrank significantly in the first wash.  Now would fit a small child.  Complete waste of money.
1.0,Great style but DOA
1.0,The ring wasn't very detailed. The watch's battery is only found in China. The watch had scratches and dirty spots on it. Also when I try to close the watch it takes an excessive amount of tries to close it. Sometimes I have to leave it and come back to close it.
1.0,"Terrible! I could never wear it. It had no lining, see through and zero support. Might as well wrapped a thin sheet around yourself."
1.0,"very small, was disappointed"
1.0,Won't fit around my wrist.
1.0,After buying two that were great the last two are horrible. Do not purchase. They sent me a replacement and it's the same crap. The metal are two different sizes and the metal isn't cut so it won't go in the loops. The bands won't even lock in the watch . It's crap and hope the sellers read this.
1.0,"Very odd fitting very large on the bottom and in belly, tight in breast and the straps are so close to neck it don't even line up to bra straps not even close and the backing slits after one wash they tear plus the material SUCKS! Very hot and sweaty..."
1.0,The shirt was not as it appeared online.
1.0,"Turn brassy color a week later and lost stones.Sharp edges,not smooth at all.Not full silver, otherwise wouldn't turn color."
1.0,The color was an aqua not a blue and the brown area was not on the side almost in the middle. It didn't look as shown<br /> I did love the fabric.
1.0,"Thought product was flimsy, thin material and overpriced."
1.0,"I ordered black/black photochromic, but they are NOT photochromic. They don't change in sunlight. They're always black. Just regular sunglasses!"
1.0,"Love the idea of the product, however the package was left at the door instead of the mail box and was chewed up by my dog"
1.0,Fits and looks nothing like the photo.  Maybe in a smaller size. Material looks like a really cheap sheet
1.0,Color is not accurately represented online
1.0,The hat brim is way too big and the liner is too small for my 4 month old. I thought it would fit better.
1.0,It’s not a dress. It’s a shirt.
1.0,This product is polyester and spandex. It is not 100% cotton.
1.0,"I was expecting to receive a really cute sequin dress, instead I received a dress that had several spots of sequins. It was absolutely nothing like I had ordered. I was very disappointed!!"
1.0,Back different than pictured
1.0,DEFINITELY NOT for plus size girls. sis you're better off with panty hose
1.0,The dress I received had different colored sparkles all over that looks like confetti. Not like the picture advertised!
1.0,Rose gold tone of band does not adequately match the tone of watch
1.0,They are so ugly they made my daughter cry cause she wanted the ones in the picture sooooo bad. Do not purchase!
1.0,Necklace changed colors and now I can't return it for a refund.
1.0,It changed colors day 1 after I wore it
1.0,Not good qoulaty. Looks really nice and sweet but got apart in couple days.
1.0,bought 3 shirts as picture with no pockets...here is what I got......1 navy slim fit with POCKET..1 white slim fit with POCKET and 1 brown REG FIT with no pocket..go figure..is this what we have come to just tossing in anything ?????? not happy at all
1.0,"Bad fit, harder to breathe than other masks, can’t see the design well because of the folds."
1.0,"Bought these for my 5 yo son for a short 3 days stay at Great Wolf Lodge, an indoor water park. By the end of the first day, there were holes in the toes of these shoes. We ended up throwing them out on day 2. Very disappointed with the wearability, though the shoes looked well made when we got them."
1.0,This is a great oversized beach bag. The problem is I only got to enjoy it for one day of my vacation before one of the straps broke. Returning.
1.0,I returned it because it was UK size not American
1.0,Does not fit the Samsung phones as indicated
1.0,"The idea was cute, but the small was huge. The sleeves were made for a size large. I could've put both arms in one. Very disappointed!"
1.0,Beware these are not what is pictured. Very bad copy. Was 3 weeks late and impossible to return. I contacted the seller but the return label is in Chinese and local delivery services won’t ship. Also over $30 to ship  back. I purchased this brand before and it is nit the same. Buyers beware
1.0,Size runs very very small. Order at least 2 sizes UP!  4X IS THE SIZE OF A 2X in United States sizes
1.0,I only had one key on it and it was in my purse and it broke.  It's sad because it seems so substantial. Go Quakers.
1.0,Not true to size-order up at least 1 size
1.0,"Waste of money, either they sent the wrong band or description was not accurate as this did not fit and was a complete waste of money and a very long wait only yo be disappointed."
1.0,The jeans were too small.
1.0,"Do Not Buy!!! If I could give ZERO stars I would. These are not yellow as marketed. The seller plays gamers by saying they are multi-colored and that computer screens may vary the color. These are marketed as Walter's glasses from the Big Lebowski. In the movie they are yellow. These lens are brown. The seller will not accept returns on open packages, but the only way to see that the color is wrong is to OPEN THE PACKAGE! TOTAL SCAM!!"
1.0,it looked like some old piece of metal  I just threw it away
1.0,"We bought this garment bag for my daughter that does dance with a team and I was not impressed with the quality. It does not have a hanger to hang it, pocket is OK. I was not happy with it, as it was not what we neede, so I returned it."
1.0,It ain’t stainless
1.0,I bought my usual size and it was way too small. The dress is very shiny which makes it look cheap. I ended up donating it to a thrift store because I never got around to returning it.
1.0,"Not a good size , sleeve in wrong place , poor fabric . I sent it back ."
1.0,"I already submitted a review. I burned this item, it was in with my search for Rayon spandex items. However this item is not Rayon! It is polyester. I hate that material! It is slick, but extremely hot! I live in the desert why would I wear such an item? Plus I have a proportionally long waist, even a high waisted dress hits me part way up my boobs. Poorly designed dress and material. Returned."
1.0,The material is excellent but the dress was not very flattering on me.
1.0,The red metallic color came off after one wash! Very disappointed in this purchase!
1.0,"Very good looking, however, the bottom part where it locks the band hurts after a while. I really can't see myself wearing this for very long. I am beginning to see a bruise on my wrist because of this. What a shame! I look very nice but it is badly constructed.  I am very reappointed that I am going to have to return it."
1.0,This product is to small.  It’s a cover up but doesn’t even go to your waist
1.0,Extremely thin and see through and size upppp out is cute
1.0,Doesn't for like posted.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:59fb5cc2a1232bf6ca037700892febff]] Cardboard shows and feathers were awful!
1.0,Only wore them twice but somehow the hose piece support that’s inside the nose piece “sprung” and no longer holds to the form.  My kid is super disappointed…..
1.0,Wrong hat
1.0,"First off, I've owned several fake gauge earrings before this pair. This particular set was HORRIBLE!!! Instead of them being normal pierced type earrings, they are screw-ins. Meaning, you have to pierce your ear with the stud then twist the back end around and around to get it to completely latch on. 1. I think that is ridiculous for faux gauge earrings. 2. Due to the shape of this earring it was impossible to twist the long end around completely because it hit my head and couldn't go any further. 3. I immediately stripped the first earring because I didn't realize it was a twist in vs. a straight shot. That was an immediate broken earring.<br />This earring set was a total crap out. Cheap materials, bad concept and very badly built. In fact the end that held the pierced bit was inconsistent. On one earring it was attached to the shorter end while the second was attached to the longer side. Cheap, cheap, cheap. I ended up going out just wearing the one side that wasn't immediately stripped. It only lasted a few hours before it fell out of my ear.<br />Pointless purchase. Be advised."
1.0,"Absolute junk. Took forever to arrive. Once it got here, I tried to attach it to my watch, and under no circumstances would it attach properly. I'm a pretty good DIY guy, and there was NO WAY this band was going to stay attached to the watch. Do yourself a favor and buy another band...any other band!"
1.0,Ordered the suggested size for my daughter and product was way to small.
1.0,"bought this hoping it might work for working out.  Doesnt fit well, not breathable.  Not recomended"
1.0,"These are absolute trash.  I ordered two for my daughters, one broke within minutes.  I wasn't expecting much for $25, but you can get better glasses at a gas station for $10."
1.0,Cheaply made....too shiny. ...return product
1.0,"Garbage, worse than the original one. They broke at the same spot as the original ones, just on the first day I wore it. Terrible. It was cheap, but if you think about it, it was a ripoff since it didn't last a day. I would've been better off flushing the money down the toilet. Stay away."
1.0,More for a guy
1.0,Difficult to put on. Cute idea but not functional in terms of putting on and I can't imagining it staying on if I'm out. I'd have to constantly tug it up
1.0,do not hold my rings like I thought..didn't use it..
1.0,They called me back and it was cheap it started to un-raveal
1.0,The size of the shirt was way off. Ordered at 3x was probably size small but was tagged 3x.
1.0,It was broke when I got it out the box. Beads every where.
1.0,Horrible...the dress has deodorant stains as if someone used it already.
1.0,"I sure wish I'd have tried these when they first showed up.  I had several pairs of glasses at that time, and now I've opened these it's too late to return them I'm afraid.<br /><br />1 star due to manufacturing defect.  There is a different curvature to one of the earpieces than the other, making the sunglasses sit lopsided on my face.<br /><br />I might try using the heat gun to put some kind of fix in place, but you shouldn't have to do that.  These need to be replaced..."
1.0,Less than Two weeks old and rusting already. Very disappointed.
1.0,It’s very small even when I removed all pads it won’t fir also front mask not closing. I think the seller send me xs instead of L like what all labels show in and out. Also had to bay 80$ for shipping it back to us. Very disappointed.
1.0,Ordered what they said to but still too small
1.0,"Cheap material,  shredded by zipper areas and became flimsy. Especially after getting wet from rain and snow."
1.0,"Don't not waste your money, they're defective, I couldn't get them to fit on my wife's let alone mine."
1.0,Looked like a sack!
1.0,"My dress has multiple holes, only worn one time didnt even wash it before. ☹"
1.0,Item was not as described. The cardigan is very thin and very itchy.
1.0,"The product is nothing like the photo. Seriously I would have payed up to 50$ to have a hat like in the photo, I'm so upset this completely ruins my plains for Halloween,  it's so cheaply made that when I put in for a return they just refunded my money and said that I didn't need to return the product,  wtf? The photo looks like felt props and string/yarn for the spiderweb, but the actual one is plastic and Styrofoam,  and the spiderweb is that nasty sticky slime like stuff they use for those toys ,the hands on a sting that you throw and it sticks to things"
1.0,"Terrible, very poor quality! Looks like a piece of 1 inch frame was glued on top of another frame that you cannot see out of. For example, the part that you can see out of is only the middle. I thought the frame would be one mirror lens. I would not recommend at all!"
1.0,"Sadly I recieved the wrong outfit.<br />Not only was it wrong but bag had correct description.  I was so upset it arrived 1 day before my granddaughters 1st birthday and because of packing mistake I received a 2 year old different outfit. No wearing that for 1st birthday smash cake photos.<br />We will have to have her wear something she already has.<br />Im heartbroken. It was just a freak cluster of mistakes. What is the odds the wrong outfit was put in wrong bag . I would have let her wear the one I would have picked last out of all choices ,but having a 2 instead of one is a deal breaker .<br />Gave only 1 star because of this mistake. Otherwise if I received correct outfit , I would have given it 5 stars . It was soft and well made but not what I ordered."
1.0,It's not like on picture.
1.0,The bottom half of the dress is cute. It has pockets which are nice too. The material is soft and quality. But The dress has this weird lapels around the neck. It ruins the look of the dress.
1.0,Not at all what it looks like. I thought i was getting a 3d model of a skeleton but jt really is flat and gaudy looking
1.0,"Cup is to small and elastic is very lax , not snug at ! Couldn't wear"
1.0,"Ordered this dress in the size that should have fit, but because of the extremely thin fabric, it showed every ripple and bulge it touched.  Honestly, it looked more like lingerie than outer wear."
1.0,"I am a Construction Upgrade Lineman technician & work in a bucket truck in all types of weather year-round. I got these based on the reviews & overall satisfaction from others mainly talking about how these were Waterproof & comfortable. They do fit well & are comfortable to wear & at first were warm as well. The first time I brought these to work to use it was 38 degrees, windy & raining. They lasted barely 30-45 minutes and my hands started to get very cold because these gloves were basically holding water!! 3 hours later I came out of my bucket,  peeled them off my now wet hands, literally squeezed the water out of them like a wet towel! I never got a chance to try the touchscreen as of course it was raining. Not happy at all, and will be looking for a replacement or refund."
1.0,They are cheap don't buy! I ve already lost 2 of them.
1.0,All the copper paint came off after only 1-2 uses. Awful product.
1.0,Hi. This didn't fit as shown on the pictures. Oh well.
1.0,Quality is very low. Broke after 3 weeks of use indoors.
1.0,The seller mentioned it suitable for both Men and Women! but it is not true obviously looks like the seller does not knew the difference's between men and women accessories.
1.0,"I thought these would be great hankies, but I was wrong. They're supposed to be cotton, I doubt it.  Scratchy and too large to fit in a pocket.  I'm thinking of using them in place of paper napkins, we'll see how that works out. They advertise them for wedding parties - I suppose they would be ok as a gift wrap since they're  pretty."
1.0,Product I received does not fit Charge 5. Seems to be designed for a Charge 3. Useless to me.
1.0,Crap. Waste of money! Both stones fell out.  Don't buy these.
1.0,I was hoping to replace a key chain I had purchased a long time ago. Should have stuck with the school store.
1.0,"Unfortunately, the product doesn't fit and must be returned."
1.0,"It breaks very easily. Very cheap, like if from the dollar store."
1.0,I normally wear a medium shirt I ordered an XL it's way to small and the sleeves are to short. Regret spending the money
1.0,I’m very small women and couldn’t even close the robe. It was disappointing and so very small. It does have drain pockets and it’s a heavy material. Just runs extremely small. Collet is also very weird.
1.0,Turned green within days
1.0,Very cute however the jewel fell off when I opened it. I definitely would not recommend.
1.0,It was not what I expected it didn’t fit as I would like it.
1.0,"Waste of money, very uncomfortable and useless."
1.0,"Much too long, not as pictured!"
1.0,Cómo lo pintaron
1.0,I really wanted this to work. But it needs more fitted areas on this dress.
1.0,Not for a kid.
1.0,This item was inside out no tags not at all Happy
1.0,The key tag broke literally 3 days after receiving it.  I placed it on my car keys and the pin broke which caused the tag to separate from my keys!!!<br /><br />Not happy....will not buy again.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THIS DRESS. Not even worth the $20. The hemline is completely crooked, it’s not a wrap dress... it is completely seen with a random 1 foot piece of fabric to tie around the waste. The bottom of the dress is not flared/ cinched like I’m the photo. AGAIN DO NOT BUY THIS DRESS."
1.0,"Child size, waist band too wide and tight"
1.0,Foam is thick and pushes my ears out. Strap is also very short and not adjustable as it appears in picture. Won't even be able to use these.
1.0,All litle sparkles came out from Bebe Logo
1.0,"The color is not Red, it’s more of a mauve color. Very disappointed"
1.0,"I would expect that a shoe designed for the medical community would be designed for standing and/or walking for 10-12 hours.  These shoes are reasonably comfortable for general use, but when you're on your feet all day, they tend to get a little small.  If I had known that when I ordered them, I would have gotten a 1/2 size larger.<br /><br />Also, I have only worn them 4 days in the hospital and the green plastic ""laminate/coating"" is already cracking and peeling.  Right now, I'm just glad I didn't spend a lot of money on them.  I'll be shopping soon for something else."
1.0,"Advertised 16 gauge, but too small for myself. . ."
1.0,Cheaply made. Looks like someone took shears to make the scallops. The fabric is unforgiving and shows any curves. I am 5'8&#34; and 150lbs. The bra lines show through the fabric. The color does match with the picture.
1.0,These run big. There’s a weird zipper all the way across the back for going to the bathroom maybe? But also a tail hanging down that would surely make using the bathroom difficult. The crotch hangs down to the knees and after wearing it maybe 4 times there’s a HUGE hole in the crotch. So disappointed (and would have returned upon arrival but it was for Christmas and didn’t have time for a replacement).
1.0,This is more of a Crop top.  Barely covered a 10 year old's belly!
1.0,This product was delivered to me inside out with deodorant stains on it as if it had been worn previously. The removable padding cups were also not in the top.
1.0,"Never had the chance to try the fit. Once we received the shoes we plugged them in to charge and one wouldn't charge at all. In fact, the cord got extremely hot almost immediately after being plugged in. Sent them back asap, not gonna take that risk again"
1.0,Cheap import.
1.0,The description says 1 size fits all.  Trust me.... it’s a small.  My 13 year old barely fits it.  If you weigh about 125-135lbs it’s perfect for you.
1.0,La tela es de muy mala calidad para el precio..<br />Tuve que regresarlo..malo malo
1.0,Tooooo small want to return this I didn't try it on till close to my vacation
1.0,The hoops are a very small and nice and polished however the dangles are horrible they look dirty with black spots cannot be stainless steel.
1.0,"The post bend so easily, I think a paper clip would be stronger"
1.0,I ordered 2 of these and both of these seemed to have issues on the inside with either poor glue or water damaged but there was yellowing on the inside
1.0,The tie around the neck was a joke! It looked like a shoe lace-literally! Probably I should go with a different style on this one. The color changing one goes back!
1.0,Very thin and certainly not XXL.  Bought them for my Aunt with swollen feet. Still had to cut the tops.  In reality they are size medium.  Would not recommend if looking for quality.
1.0,Shirt is not a compression shirt - it states that on the tags attached to the shirt when it arrived.  The upper back section is to large so it doesn't do anything for your posture.  It is tight in the arms and fits when your shoulders are forward but when you pull your shoulders back to the proper posture the shirt actually gives no support for back.  I purchased both a medium & a small as I wanted to wear the medium on a daily basis & the small under tighter short sleeve shirts - but there really wasn't a difference between the two sizes.  A waste of money - I'm not sure why these shirts are over $70 when some off the same shirts that cost under $20 are just as good if not better!
1.0,"The clasp for this choker broke within a day. The choker is also extremely thick, and it does not look flattering at all. I would not recommend this product at all."
1.0,This little tutu I did not care for.  The fabric around the chest area around to the back was very loose.  I thought maybe I just needed to wash it.  When I washed it the tutu part shrunk up and got destroyed.  It looks awful and I wouldn't order this again. I haven't had this issue with any other tutus I've ordered.
1.0,"Even buying larger size this is still too small and tight yet the arms are long. They shouldn't bother selling to a market if you can't accurately match the sizes. The only reason l'm not returning is because there's someone in the house it fits, a normally size 4!!!"
1.0,Thumbs down.
1.0,I washed it once and everything became loose.  and not just from that midsection.  the yarn was coming out from everywhere.  It looks nice on others but I think I got the defected one.
1.0,does not work well...leaves residue on suede
1.0,"These pants ripped through the crotch and leg upon the first wear, just by getting up and down off the floor repeatedly doing basic plumbing work. There is no give to the fabric whatsoever."
1.0,Thought the black bats here metal. It's two pices of a pleather material glues together. Super light and cheap.
1.0,"DO NOT PURCHASE!! I have a Tic S. I loved it until the clasp broke. So like everyone else, I looked up replacement bands. I found this company saying that they are exact replacements.  So I ordered them. It took almost a month for them to showup. Only to find out that for whatever reason, you can not actually replace the band on the Tic S.  I feel that this company should have never sold these since the bands are not replaceable.  Save your money and buy a new watch."
1.0,"It was very thin and not very cushiony. It’s nothing like Adidas “boost” feeing. I purchased the HefeLuxe and Sachukot EPTU boost insoles, and they were both superior. Sachukot was a bit more comfortable since it felt thicker and more “squishy” when walking. The HefeLuxe has the biggest marketing campaign (hype) behind it, but it fell flat.. legitimately feels flat. It was bouncy like Sachukot, very firm. The Sevego just feels filmsy in comparison... wouldn’t spend $1 on it. And Sachukot is the cheapest out of the 3... and money is not a factor in my decision at all...<br /><br />1. Sachukot<br />2. HefeLuxe<br />3. Sevego"
1.0,My husband loved it as it woke him up and nothing has ever done that! Unfortunately it stopped zapping after only three months so if you want to spend $50 a month go for it. For the price they definitely should have a better warranty! I’m beyond aggravated!!!!
1.0,"Very cute, but way too small"
1.0,Weird material wouldn't rec the buy.
1.0,Arrived broken and the white checkered part looks like it was a white shirt that got stuck in the load of red laundry.
1.0,Wrong Color Extremely tooooo Big<br />Doesn’t look like model
1.0,not authentic zooyork
1.0,Excellent design!<br />But not water resistant. 5 days of use and allready wet inside!<br />I'm writing the seller for refound!!! For the moment one star! I' reviiew again depending on the answer from amazon and the seller!!!
1.0,Very cheaply made and was too small and way too long
1.0,Ordered same size I have any other pair and these were way small size large fit more like a small
1.0,I ordered this for my daughter in a 2XL and it fit like a small.
1.0,Broke the first day ..
1.0,Rusted in my daughters ear!
1.0,This already had seams coming apart on arrival. Otherwise my wife reports it looked like it would have been a very comfortable dress.
1.0,The bracelets are not even rainbow.  Half of them were pastel and the others either didn't include all the colors a rainbow should have or were missing a color or two.  SO disappointed.  These should not be listed as &#34;Gay Pride Bracelets&#34; if they aren't even rainbow.
1.0,"Horrible packaging, horrible wig, i don't know.<br />But it's impossible to wear, I had to throw it out cause it was a waste of space. So flat, no shape, nothing like the picture.....waste of money"
1.0,"Belt keeps coming loose. Taking it to shoe repair shop soon to have a real buckle and holes replace existing buckle and ""teeth"" system."
1.0,"I purchased this belt for regular work & received last april 24, but it just last less than a month.. Be AWARE those holes are piece of junk and gave up easily.. NO NEED TO MUCH TALK. Look at the picture.."
1.0,Ridiculous small! Smaller than Tour Hans.
1.0,I ordered the color pictured (black top/tortoise bottom) and was sent a brown frame color instead which looks almost burgundy in sunlight and is  cheap looking in my opinion. The frames are sturdy overall but this color is just so bad and the finish almost looks like it’s coming off in some areas. Not worth it to return these shipping internationally so it’s disappointing. I would have absolutely loved these if they had just sent me the right color.
1.0,"I only wore these stocking maybe a total of 10-15 times and the material by the toe got a hole :(  From now on hopefully I can find a reinforced toe, these were simply a cheap material or just not a sturdy enough construction."
1.0,These socks are terrible.  They are expensive and the fabric was dirty when  I got them.
1.0,"These are baby size shoes, NOT YOUTH NOR ADULTS!"
1.0,It’s literal garbage. Looked like a paper bag a medium has never been too big for me and the crossing was stitched weird that either way you put it on it didn’t look right
1.0,"Fits so damn weird, wish i could have returned it. Don't waste your time."
1.0,This item lasted about 4-days and BROKE I will never buy it again (terrible).
1.0,"Earrings don’t  fit, don’t stay on my earlobe. Tried to bend them & they don’t bend to pinch my earlobe to stay up."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:d6a006b731bd712d2eaf15e6d4518132]] Poor zipper quality. Zipper lasted less than 2 months
1.0,The lace and the fabric have 2 different color. Fitting is awful
1.0,"This a really cute swimsuit and my daughter loves it! Upon opening the package, all was well until I saw the extremely cheap and very poorly manufactured zipper in the back. Literally the cheapest type of nylon and plastic zipper you can get, they’re a dime and dozen, and it looked like it was barely stitched in at all. When I see an item like this that I paid more than $5 for, I’m mad as all get out. I should not have to repair or replace parts of a brand new purchase upon reciept. It takes thirty seconds and fifty cents to put in a decent zipper that’ll last more than one wear. Luckily I can sew and have a needle that’ll take on this stretchy swimsuit material without piling, but I’m still pretty POd that I have to fix it before she can even wear it to swim class. Lame!"
1.0,Very disappointed because it’s yellowed
1.0,"I looked like a big square in this cover-up, just returned it."
1.0,"If I could give it a negative rating, I would. It looks like it was sewn in a dark closet"
1.0,"Looks great, but does not secure closed. Lost a house key somewhere. Unless you just want it as a novelty, don’t buy. You may loose your keys."
1.0,"Thin, not even close to stock. The polarization is spotty. They fit but it's about like putting gas station lenses in the frames. Save yourself time and money."
1.0,Very cute and comfy but quit working after just three days. Very disappointed
1.0,Not a fan of the material
1.0,Did not have the strap to the top so I am unable to wear the suit at all. Worthless.
1.0,"The picture shows dark colors,  that is why I bought this set.  What I got is light pink and Gray. Disappointed to say the least."
1.0,The hearts snaped in half while trying to put in ear. Cheap thin metal.
1.0,Looks cheap and the wf logo fell off.
1.0,"I ordered this dress for my son's wedding in May.  I even paid extra for it to arrive early-I knew I would need it shortened.  Ordered a size 14, normally wear a 10.  TOO SMALL in the top!  I couldn't get it zipped up.  There was a 4 inch gap!<br /><br />Some reviewers said the dress could be altered, some said no way.  The company's response, as opposed to returning the dress, was to try to get it altered as they have allowed 3-5 cm throughout for alterations.  There is no way that would for me.<br /><br />I would not recommend purchasing without going 4 sizes above your regular size.  On to David's Bridal I guess and try to sell the dress via online marketplaces.  Disappointed."
1.0,Doesn’t look as pictured and didn’t fit right
1.0,"The earrings are beautiful. I’ve purchased two pair for gifts and plan to buy another for me.<br />Update:  I did indeed buy a pair for myself.  I tried to put the earrings on, and the post was so flimsy that it bent each time I tried to secure the post to the backing.  I can only assume that the recipients of my gifts were too polite to tell me about the quality.  On the card, they are indeed very pretty.  Just don't try to wear them."
1.0,The slippers were too large on me and they were thin on the bottom we're with the memory foam they should have been thicker and that is my main reason for returning them it felt like there was no thickness at all on the bottom of the slipper
1.0,"Got a size larger than I needed, was very disappointed because this was supposed to be my wedding dress,  needless to say I had to find something last minute as it was not only too small but WAY too small.  And was just a bit darker than the photo."
1.0,This hat came all folded up. The wire that shapes the brim would not flatten out like it looks in the picture - it stayed warped and curled. The hat looked like cheap because of the crooked brim. I returned it for credit.
1.0,was broken when it arrived
1.0,Doesnt fit my kids well at all. It doesnt line up on their ears well and they said its uncomfortable and hard to breathe in compared to most masks.
1.0,"Good idea in theory but not very durable. Bought two pair, one for my wedding and one for my rehearsal dinner. Both times my heels popped through the bottom when standing in the grass. Only buy these if you will be standing 10 minutes or less. Would give zero stars if I could"
1.0,Cheap and smaller than pictured
1.0,Just opened package and Does not work. Bought for a gift very disappointed. Cute but useless.
1.0,"Bought this dress in another color and loved it so much I bought 4 other colors,  they are way tight and super short!"
1.0,Runs very small like 2 sizes too small
1.0,Wore one time and the frame fell apart.  Really Willis?
1.0,"I purchased these because I wear heavier bamboo boot socks in the winter and they are comfortable and feel great.  For me these are too thin to be sport socks, they are similar to socks you would wear with slacks and casual shoes to go out for dinner or with friends.  After a couple of wearings and washings they have become tight in the toes and there is no cushion on the sole.  I used to wear Hanes women's crew sport socks and I have gone back to them."
1.0,This was very poorly made.  And the fit was too small.
1.0,I bought 3 nightgown of this style in XL and the grey nightgown was too small. Probably size was marked wrong.
1.0,"These gloves are pretty bad. Like most reviews, these gloves as very small for normal men's hands, and they are very lightweight. Besides those specs of the gloves, they don't even work on my phone's touchscreen at all. I do have a screen protector on it, but it should still work on it either way. Overall, these gloves are a terrible purchase.  I might take some of the other reviewers' advice and give them to my wife."
1.0,"Way to small , came with a whole in it , very cheaply made"
1.0,The studs are heavy and broke. I had to send them back.
1.0,This came broken.  I used to love this brand but lately all of their stuff has gone downhill.  Definitely would not recommend.
1.0,The necklace is pretty much a giant hunk of plastic and it's really not that cute in person. It also broke as soon as I took it out of the bag
1.0,"Material thin, did not wash well.  Stitching quality poor."
1.0,"Horrible!  This is perhaps the least supportive bra I have ever owned.  If you are large breasted &/or not a “perky” type, just no.  Going back to my old standby, this purchase was a bust 😉"
1.0,If this ring is stainless steel why am I seeing a copper/brass color developing over the band after 3 days of wear? Metal allergies resulting in extreme swelling is a real thing. Be honest about what you're selling so your customers don't have to visit the Emergency room for ring removal.
1.0,"Earring broke after 4 months. I only wore about once per week but after 4 months, one of them broke"
1.0,I gave it away! :(
1.0,This school bag did not last. Poorly made 1 zippers broke after a week an now the second one broke. Kindergarten is upset because she really like this one an now we have to get another one. Would not recommend
1.0,"I returned this bathing suit as it was too large.  Once the neck straps were tied the bust line tied way above my bust line.  Leg holes were way to wide.  The style is very cute on but the fit is way off.  For what it's worth, I am 5'4&#34; tall and way 146lbs.  I ordered the 12/14 size.  I walk 2 miles every day."
1.0,Cheap and a very long arrival.  Made in China.
1.0,Jacket fit very nice BUT my first day on vacation the rain seeped right through to my clothes and my skin. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.  left me with no rain protection entire vacation.
1.0,"Return window is not generous, very disappointing.<br />Clothing item was extremely small - I even ordered a size up according to other reviews.<br />Not happy at all and unable to return for a refund. Too bad. For sure will not buy from this vendor again."
1.0,too small for daith piercings!!!!
1.0,Will not be back
1.0,Shorts came with button almost off. Returned over a month ago and no refund was given.
1.0,I Did not like the material  and it was very tight. How do I return it.
1.0,Supposed to be self-winding but if not shaken a number of times during day and night it stops working
1.0,"Odd sizing in that it was a XL, but in other locations i am a small or medium.  That was an adjustment.  The top two buttons weren't attached when arrived, and the remaining buttons were barley hanging on.  The style is cute, but fabric is cheep.  I can pay less for a better quality shirt elsewhere.  Stay away!"
1.0,Girl cheap it broke
1.0,It’s a weird fit. Really wide and kind of short in the body. Material is thin. Not for me so would not purchase again. It’s tough buying clothes online
1.0,Beautiful earrings but wouldn't stay clamped to my ear. I bought them for a pageant but they kept falling out! Very disappointed! The clamps were poorly made. I will be returning them.
1.0,Holes started appearing after washing
1.0,Gave both swimsuits to my daughter; not true to size.
1.0,Shoes arrived on time.  Only one shoe lights up even after charging and only has red lights when the pictures of the shoes show blue and that's what my son wanted.  He does not like red lights that's why he picked these because of the blue lights.  So he will not wear them.  I need either ones with the blue lights like the advertised picture sent or a refund.  He is autistic so there is no changing his mind.  Plus I really should get what I paid for and in working order.
1.0,"This was a cheap piece of junk whose secondary functions didn't work, and whose primary function (keeping time) was abysmal. It stopped overnight, essentially resulting in the loss of five or six hours a day."
1.0,"Much shorter skirt than the picture. NOT FLOWY AT ALL. The skirt is almost completely straight and honestly, I'm so disappointed. I wanted the flowy skirt in the picture, but alas, this dress does not remotely come close to that (I even ordered the most flowy looking one). The one star I gave it was because the material is fine. Not great. Just fine. Not stretchy and comfy, but its fine because it feels more like fabric than the thin plastic you normally get online shopping. Thanks internet, I'm gonna go thrifting, maybe I'll find something remotely suitable."
1.0,"I've had them for 2 days and one just fell apart.  Luckily, it fell apart as I was taking them out of my ear and I have all 3 parts.  I'm going to try to glue back together."
1.0,"The dark color on this towel stained our skin and clothes.  I even washed it when we first got it before we even used it, same day we were at the pool and the beach and stains with either water. Suggest to buy a light color one."
1.0,These earrings are too big! They stick out way too far when in your ears.
1.0,Not very comfortable would not by again
1.0,"Nope. Tried it, hate it. See through, paper thin. Maybe as a pajama"
1.0,Wrong size/Too big
1.0,Do not buy these if you are looking for a fully functioning aviator sunglasses.  They scratch super easy and are very flimsey.  Unless you have a huge head they will be way to long and always droop down to your nose.  Only reason to buy them is for a Halloween costume of just for laughs.  Total waste of money
1.0,They didn’t even work. Waste of money.
1.0,You’re better off making sunglasses by hand out of straws. Terrible. Pairs were chipped and damaged like in the photo.
1.0,Fake beats
1.0,Ordered 2 (two) Claddaghs and neither were included with order.
1.0,The sleeves on this dress were soooo tight!  and then the length was really longer than in the picture.
1.0,"Not very comfortable, and not working at all."
1.0,"I loved the fit and style of this dress, but the color was not at all what was advertised. Returned immediately."
1.0,Tiny. Suited for kids only.
1.0,Good price for poor quality compression socks...didn't last fell apart after 1 month..will not buy again. Again china made garbage!
1.0,Something is wrong with the vision acuity of these readers.Quite junky<br />What a dissappointment
1.0,It is for bigger babies lol. The neck is super wide and way too big for my skinny baby
1.0,"This item was way too tight. Yes, I read the reviews, but I do not have long thick hair. I have a “normal” sized head, so I expected this product to work. I had to take it off in the first hour because the intense pressure was keeping me awake."
1.0,My daughter wears a mens 9 women's 11 which is what I ordered so these should have been a 42 but the three pairs I ordered were marked 44 and way to big.
1.0,Glasses came dusty and disgusting. Returning.
1.0,"I was disappointed when the item was mailed. First, the fabric is thin. The back design is bad. . Because rubber is loose, it moves steadily down to the knees as it moves. Unlike photographs, this is the bad quality item with the lowest quality."
1.0,"The levels of disappointment include:<br /><br />1) Some shirts I am a large, some an extra large. When ordering, I carefully measured a shirt I had that was comfortable and ordered the extra large. What I received was a tent. It says XL on the tag, but it is huge. The arms are orangutan length. Totally unusable.<br /><br />2)  I ordered light blue. What came is light greenish. It says blue, but I don't see a hint of blue to it.<br /><br />3) The material feels like tent material and is not natural feeling or comfortable in any way.<br /><br />4)  The button holes are too small making buttoning and unbuttoning extremely difficult.<br /><br />My recommendation is to look elsewhere."
1.0,I ordered my usual size but I definitely should have sized up as everything was too short and way too tight.
1.0,Terrible sizing. I ordered the same belts and same size but what arrived was way smaller. I feel like I am being cheated.
1.0,"Sizing is not accurate at all, extremely large in hips and legs"
1.0,Sent back right away! It looked more like a mini dress than a maxi dress! Very disappointed!
1.0,"This is advertised as a sweatshirt. A sweatshirt means that it is fleece-lined and warm. This is a long-sleeved nylon shirt with cheap lettering. The seller stressed using their sizing chart, so I assumed the shirts are Asian sizes, not U.S. sizes. I am a U.S. medium/large. I wanted this to be an oversized sweatshirt to lounge around the house in, so I got the XXL, just to be safe. It isn't oversized at all. It just about fits. If you actually want a sweatshirt that fits with this cute saying on it, this is not the one to buy. Like another review mentions, the letters turn yellow after you wash it."
1.0,Does not look like brick orange! Not at all!! So disappointed.
1.0,"Really cheap fabric, not what I expected. I will be returning,"
1.0,Like the way it looks .. extremely to big<br />Not true to size at all.. so know it’s a waist..
1.0,"So flimsy and small!  I lost one of the pair after ONE hour of wear.  I obviously can’t return, so NOT worth the money.  Save your cash!"
1.0,These gloves are not heavy-duty anything. Description is misleading. Sending them back asap.
1.0,Awful material! Tight and itchy. Arrived with bad chemical smell. Very disappointed!
1.0,"cheaply made, the needles bent and broke off very easily"
1.0,the black patent look look cheap and the straps break easily!!!  Sorry I kept them; waste of funds.
1.0,Doesn't look like the pic at all. Not good quality. Do not purchase.
1.0,Very loose not that size actually
1.0,The clasp broke the first time I wore it.
1.0,Clip broke and the other earring doesn’t stay on
1.0,But it did definitely look cheap. I didn’t like this one. I’ve bought many cheap necklaces off Amazon this was the cheapest looking one. Broke.
1.0,"I bought this shirt a month ago, and loved it. Brought a different color thinking I'd get the same quality, but no. The packaging was the first clue, wasn't even folded neatly or in the same type of packaging. There is dirt/scuff marks like it was worn or something all over the shirt, bleeding through. Also, this is completely different fabric; cheap scratchy fabric that is nothing like the one I bought a month ago. Disappointing."
1.0,Cute as an ugly dress but was way to big. Had to return.
1.0,I uploaded some picture of the mold that was prevalent in all of the nooks and crevices of the bag. I received this bag almost an hour ago and was disappoint in what I received.  It smelled strongly of mold/mildew and here is picture proof that it is mildew.  What is strange is that there are no desiccants sachets anywhere in or out of the bag.  I am disappointed in the seller and disappointed in Amazon for allowing sellers to sell such subpar products on their website.  Honestly it belongs in the trash and my home sprayed with some kind of mold killer solution. I hope I can return this and get a full refund.
1.0,Smelled horrible. Throwing it in the trash.
1.0,Broke after a few days.  Didn't even get to wear it
1.0,"Was excited to buy this top , loved the open shoulders and how it was flowy. And when it arrived I was extreamly disappointed.  I even bought a size up just in case. I put it on and it was skin tight and didnt look anything like the picture."
1.0,See through cheap fabric!
1.0,they where poor quality and the post was bent
1.0,This item was tarnished very fast it turned from rose to black very fast
1.0,I wore these for 5 minutes and the sole came right off.....these are garbage. DO NOT BUY!!! I didn't get one wear
1.0,Comfort is important to me and the pants did not fit the were to small
1.0,They broke in a few days.
1.0,I would love to return it.
1.0,"This is one of the worst purchases I've ever made on Amazon. It is terribly made, the strings to tie in the back are not the same lengths and the seams and lace have little strings coming out of them. It doesn't even remotely fit me. I'm a size 32B and I ordered the small. It's not that it's too big or too small, it's too wide! It doesn't even cover my nipples! I guess I shouldn't have expected anything more for the price I paid."
1.0,Had to order size up then the strap broke. Very cheap material only wore once
1.0,"Poor quality. Very thin.  Not true size, too big. Not worth the price."
1.0,"Constantly fall apart, looks great but quality is terrible.  Had high hopes for this band.  It's sad it didn't work, looks great on my watch, except when it falls off my wrist."
1.0,"There is discolaration around the collar, shoulder seams and a small narrow strip in the middle of the collar down approx 4 inches long"
1.0,It was too small need a bigger suze
1.0,This bag didn’t work for me. I tried to return it & there was a problem with the link for the return label. Tried to email the company about it & I never heard back from them. Now I am stuck with the purse.
1.0,Love Dolly. Love the design. Hate the sizing. Go up two sizes if you’re going to order it.
1.0,"Lenses provide extremely weak protection against the sun as if they were slightly tinted; you will see someone else's eyes through them in a darker environment if that illustrates the situation to you future buyers. I was extremely dissatisfied but refused to send them back as I would only receive a fraction of the money I paid. Save yourselves some money, don't buy these things."
1.0,"After just a few days the ""silver"" has worn off. Looks like copper underneath."
1.0,Very cheap looking like from the dollar store very disappointed
1.0,Very disappointed in the construction of this what looks or appears to be like a strong metal key fob when it literally broke apart with very little pressure hanging off my purse with nothing else on it…
1.0,Arrived broken. Terrible quality otherwise
1.0,"The product does provide lift, however it pulled off skin when removed and left a rash everywhere it touched the skin. I thought it was just me, but I had 2 bridesmaids that used them as well and had the same issue. It's not worth the pain."
1.0,"I am 5'2, petite and ordered an xs. It was still way too big and did not look quite like the picture. The shoulders are very wide, the waste was super baggy and the neckline droops so it does not hug your neck at all. The fabric was really heavy and almost felt like. Was not comfortable. I was honestly disappointed with this buy and had to return it."
1.0,Nice frames...but not for me!  I returned them.
1.0,Way too sheer and cheap material
1.0,Really really disliked this dress from the moment I put it on. It is tight but stretchy and see through and thick and is not complimentary at all. I bought it for a cruise and couldn’t wear it once. I don’t mind sexy dresses but this was not sexy and it looked cheap. Very unflattering.
1.0,"Their size chart is so off. Says the small is size 6-8 but if you look at the actual measurements (which I didn’t, those are not 6-8 measurements)"
1.0,"Unfortunately like other reviews my kitchen has some defects. Overall exactly what I want in a kitchen but the main piece that the sink sits in has a chunk missing out of it and the two pink knobs for the stove were broken. I contacted seller for replacement parts but they are not available disappointed that a toy I just purchased and assembled is damaged with no resolution, buyers beware."
1.0,"Be wary of product defects, as my dress came with a white line without the print on it approximately 2 inches long."
1.0,"They are Not lightweight,!"
1.0,"Despite all the negative reviews I really wanted this swimsuit to work but it was just a waist of money! I'm usually a medium and I got an XL. The bottoms were sooo tiny, definitely fit like a small! I'm pretty sure they just have one size and give everyone the same size no matter what. The top is okay for a or b cups, but all my DD ladies out there DO NOT BUY THIS! No support or coverage whatsoever."
1.0,To small ! Accidentally there out packaging or I would have returned :/ junk
1.0,These barbells have external threads.  Ugh!  Horrible design.
1.0,Got the leggings with snags and holes at the seam already. I was also disappointed at the fit too loose not right.
1.0,This is not cut near like the picture shows. It's not french cut / slim cut like the picture nor is the bottom shaped like the picture. It's a straight cut. Won't purchase this brand again.
1.0,"Horrible artículo, desagradable recibir un artículo de la peor calidad."
1.0,"Looks nothing like the picture, doesn't lay flat. Resembles something from a vending machine you would pay a quarter for."
1.0,"They look great but they are very uncomfortable to move around in. When I sat down in my car, it was too tight around my thighs and up. It fits when i am standing up but the fabric has no give. If I got a bigger size, it would look to baggy. They looked great on but I bought them to wear at work where I need to be able to move and bend so I would prefer a fabric around the waist and hips that stretched a little bit. I can’t sit down or bend over to tie my shoes. It is a little baggy in the crotch area as well."
1.0,I expected it to be made of leather but it's more like plastic.
1.0,"Very tight, color was not as pictured (more of a sunflower yellow,  not mustard). Partial refund given due to high shipping cost and was able to keep the shirt; I can't wear it so it was donated."
1.0,The fabric is so thin it feels more like stockings then tights.  And they itched.
1.0,"Bad quality,  broke fast"
1.0,It didn’t fit my ear. Not worth it.
1.0,Do not waste your time these are not good quality and will turn green instantly not a good product at all.
1.0,"These are NOT flattering! Im on 5'3 and 110lbs and these shorts made me took 3 month pregnant. After taking 3 months to arrive, I'm trying to return and the seller is asking ME to pay return shipping cost!"
1.0,Color not what I expected
1.0,Band broke after a week very disappointing
1.0,I didn’t like the fabric.<br />Poor quality.
1.0,"There really is no arch on these flip flops and they squeak really bad.  They ‘look’ nice, and that’s about as far as it goes."
1.0,"I was shocked this item got so many good reviews, I usually rely on these when making purchases. It came in a pretty red gift box: the excitement and thrill ends there! It was practically in pieces with the missing loops in the bag, but they did not include tools to put it back together( is this a kit?) It is very cheaply made, I know its costume jewelry, but I have gotten nice pieces on amazon. This is just a cheap piece of jewelry that I can't even wear because it's in pieces. I guess you get what you pay- cheap junk! One undeserving star!!!"
1.0,"Simply, didn't  work"
1.0,"Save your money. These might work temporarily but I wouldn’t say long term, over all not a good investment. Buy a better mask."
1.0,Have requested a return twice and no response. Regret purchasing
1.0,I got metal bars that don't glow. False advertising
1.0,TOO SMALL. Doesn’t even fit my 8yr old granddaughters head. It’s made very cheap. Waste of money
1.0,"I just bought two of them. Came on time. Unfortunately, it fell apart after three hours of being on my hand. It is because two strings are just tied up with the leather strip which do not hold each other tight. It just falls apart as you put on and take off your hand. Also it looks very different and dull than the picture shown on the website."
1.0,This skirt is see-through despite the layers...you'll have to buy something else to go up under it to main your privacy.
1.0,"They looked ok at first but when I stepped into them, the holes poked my feet and it actually hurt to wear them. I thought maybe it’d be better wet, but no dice. They also suction to the floor a bit and I didn’t feel sturdy in them. They did fit as expected though."
1.0,I order a bigger size and for it to fit tight not happy
1.0,"This was the worst purchase from amazon.  The first (and only) time I wore it, the fabric started pilling (beading). I thought I would wash it (hand wash cycle)...MISTAKE.  Entire cardigan...the fabric is pilling as if I had worn it a thousand times.  I want my money back.  Also, the arms have no ""give"" if you would like to roll up your sleeves.  Not worth it at all."
1.0,"It distresses me to write a poor review, but I wouldn't recommend these bags to anyone.  On three occasions I have had the bags rip open with groceries spilling everywhere.  I did not overload them and the weight limit was not nearly what was advertised.  I will throw the rest of the bags away as I cannot depend on them."
1.0,"this did not last that long,  straps broke and came un-sowed"
1.0,"My daughter opened these Christmas Day. I bought her 3 different colors. Washed, and placed them in the dryer like we always do with new clothing.  When we took them out ALL 3 shrunk to toddler size 2/3.  They are of no use to us and I would strongly suggest not buying this item. Strongly. I never ever leave bad reviews, but this is not worth.25."
1.0,The top of the dress was tearing at the breast.
1.0,This was made for a baby
1.0,"Although it's a pretty dress I was unable to wear it because it's extremely see-through. I tried multiple undergarments, however, anything I put on under it was extremely easy to see."
1.0,Pretty cheap. Same thing you can find on wish
1.0,This band was difficult to attach and almost impossible to remove. It took me almost 30 minutes to get it off and it was sooo difficult to remove I was afraid I was going to damage my tracker. DON'T BUY THIS BAND. I returned mine.
1.0,I really loved these shoes but they broke within a week of wearing them every day. Very disappointed 😔
1.0,wont stay on. defective
1.0,"I bought the 'leather blue' band. It is not leather. Not similar to the picture. The band is made of plastic/rubber (similar to the the material of the band that comes with the Alta, but slimer), it is not brown on the back, but blue all over. That being said, it is a nice band, comfortable, fits the Alta and a nice shade of blue. Remind me of blue jeans, it will go with about anything. I do like it, but it is not at all the same product that I thought I ordered."
1.0,It came as a broken piece. Highly disaapointed!!!!!
1.0,NOTHING like the pic! Stitching fell apart after 1 hour of wearing. Way to short. I hated everything about this Halloween because of this purchase
1.0,The real problem with these pants is that the waist band is the same fabric as the pants with no extra strength or heavier elastic in the waist to keep them up.  As you walk or work out they just slide down your body.  Constantly yanking the up.
1.0,"This item was unwearable for me, a size L women's was more like a small. Very frustrating as it looks reasonable well-made. Sending back is a hassle too."
1.0,Too small around breast area. You cant really wear a bra with this and I did size up but this seemed more suitable for smaller breast women. The material was unraveling so I returned it
1.0,I liked the shirt but it runs large.  This seller does not provide free returns or exchanges.  An expensive lesson to learn the hard way.
1.0,The pack that came was not the one in the picture and was very small
1.0,Beautiful received a lot of compliments then 3 days later the chain started turning colors so basically a waste of my money
1.0,Only received two straps when I ordered three and both straps were missing the pin required to connect them to my watch (Garmin Venu Sq). Completely unusable.
1.0,I was really looking forward to getting these. And was greatly disappointed. The studs have nothing to stop them from falling out. I put a stud in and bent my head to grab my mirror to get a better look. And the stud fell out. Then tried the regular hoop. It was hard to get in at first. I had to pull apart not just open it side to side. The opening isn’t big enough.  But then trying to close the gap while the hoop was in was really difficult and I only got it partially closed and I constantly had to readjust it to get it to stay in. The hoop with the gem was even worse. Don’t waste your time ordering and your money buying these. I ordered L shaped and corkscrew studs next and am waiting on them now. I hope they are better than these junky ones.
1.0,"Very cheap looking, looks like plastic.  Plus both of the posts were bent when I opened the package.  I am returning these."
1.0,Worse dress
1.0,Waste of money worst buy ever !!!!!<br />It didn't even fit the whole way through my tragus the. And was too thick . It was too short to wear as a regular earring . The diamond fell out the same day! Waste of money
1.0,"This is a very poor quality dress, scratch and had flaws. Couldn’t wear it for what I bought it for."
1.0,"In a word, DON’T buy. One fell apart during the second use and the other came unassembled and couldn’t be used."
1.0,Nice but way OVERPRICED.
1.0,"Super thin, and looks cheap!  The pics are definitely misleading.  Don't even bother wasting your money."
1.0,"Very disappointed. I was planning to use these to make bridesmaids gifts for my wedding party and they were only about 4 inches long, despite me ordering the &#34;XL&#34; size. If you're planning to purchase, do yourself a favor and just get some uncut bracelet/necklace chain from the craft store."
1.0,They don’t keep your feet any dryer that a regular sock. Only good thing is that I didn’t pay much more for them
1.0,That I had to get in it.  Pretty once on but needed help
1.0,"The necklace would be cute if the ball was a tennis ball, as advertised, and not a baseball (as pictured).  Also, the baseball is proportionally WAY too large for the racquet.  Bummed. Thought this would have been a fun little necklace to wear."
1.0,"This shirt is great if you have no hips! The 2X I bought just fit over my chest,, no way over my hips...WASTE OF MONEY..."
1.0,Awful don’t buy
1.0,"The description says ""Natural"" but there is nothing natural and they certainly are not pearls.  Don't waste you money. Mine are already in the garbage."
1.0,"I ordered medium, but this dress is EXTRA SMALL. It's more like a top than a dress.. I'm very disappointed, coz I really like the design, and I had already ordered and received a different design which was true to size."
1.0,"I bought the Casio F91W-1 Classic Resin Strap Digital Sport Watch based on the number of positive reviews.  Also, I bought it based on the pictures of the watch, and the proportional qualities of those pictures.  The watch arrived.  It is smaller than it looks.  Without commenting on the watch's other qualities which has been done in other reviews... I will give the actual display measurements.  Notice that much of the watch surface is taken up with ""advertising.  The display area is 3/4"" by 3/8"".  The actual size of the number display is 7/16"" by 3/16""  For me this size is too small to see at a glance when engaged in some physical activity.  Perhaps these actual dimensions will be of use to others?"
1.0,Item did not match pictured item... missing American flag.
1.0,They don't keep my feet warm. They're very thin and more like slip-free socks.  They are comfortable.<br />I'm disappointed that they don't keep my feet warm like they said they're supposed to do.
1.0,sleeves are short and the shirt is not long. Shorts are not baggy.
1.0,Way to big 😓
1.0,"The shirt is cut tight, cheaply made and not nearly as good as far less expensive T shirts I own."
1.0,Is cheap and make and there are big gaps between the beads
1.0,My girl friend could barley get the shirt over her head. I let the dog ware it for the day and through it out.
1.0,I HAD TWO PEOPLE TRY IT ON IT WAS TOO SMALL FOR BOTH OF THEM AND THEY ARE BOTH TALL AND GOOD BUILT BUT NOT OVER WEIGHT JUST TOO SMALL
1.0,Looks much better in the picture not  a realistic picture
1.0,"They are light weight and cool to wear.  They would fit well except that one of the two darts in the back (extending down from the waist) was about an inch longer than the other one.  Also, the longer dart was wider which causes the pants to look “different” and not symmetrical (on each side) in the back hip area."
1.0,Penguin fell off the first time I wore it.
1.0,"The brand Victorinox is very good, I know that, but the carry on that I received had flaws, I checked it on a trip, it came with serious flaws and the zipper broke, I couldn't fix it because it was in Naples, Italy, I had to buy another emergency one. I think the seller sold me the carry on failed, some fault that was not detected, I lost my money.<br />Felix"
1.0,Broken when I get it
1.0,Fell apart the first time I washed them. Useless waste of money's
1.0,Too cheap looking/feeling.
1.0,Expensive for what you get.  The strap is to short to go over my body and to long for my shoulder.
1.0,Sizing wrong not easy on or easy off
1.0,"Horrible.<br />There is no way to tie this wrap dress, therefore it cannot be worn- made very poorly. Extremely disappointed. This is likely while the model pictured is holding the dress on the side."
1.0,"We used these one time. On the second time, one of the clips broke! Highly disappointed. If I could give zero stars, I would."
1.0,"Seriously, had them for less than an hour and had to sew up the top seam on both of the slippers. Fabric cut too narrowly so seams couldnt hold on such a loose weave fabric. My daughter liked the look though so we have kept them."
1.0,Runs very small. Ordered an xl and it was more like a small/med.
1.0,"First of all the description says bracelet is 8 inches.  It measures 8 1/2 inches.  Secondly, it does not stay fastened.  There is a fit it lock, it does not work, and also to safety caches, they do dot work either.  I am returning it.  Also, the 5mm is beautiful but too large to look real."
1.0,After waiting for these socks for sooo long the very first time I wear them they rip within hours.  I’m very disappointed with this purchase.
1.0,Not secure. The band releases the Fitbit and it falls on the ground.
1.0,"Weak hold, too stretchy. Leather tip is bulky and gets caught on pant loops making it difficult to remove."
1.0,There are better $5 watches anywhere else.  This watch needed to be reset every few minutes.  Rigid band and you have to press the button to get the time.
1.0,Very cute dress but it had a rip in the front the lace was not attached in the front.
1.0,Cheap looking.  Definitely not what I was looking for.
1.0,Sun glasses were thrown in shipping box 1/2 way out of a plastic bag- glasses are scratched and never even worn. Don’t waist your $!!!
1.0,Did not care for material
1.0,One of the most poorly made I've ever purchased. Went off size chart and it arrived hilariously big made of swimsuit material. The colour is pretty and true to advertisement though.
1.0,Crooked stitches along the waist and down the sides. Hemline is way above the knee for me at 5’2
1.0,"The product is very warm... I leave unzipped when temps reach 40. I was very pleased for the first 2 weeks, but then the zipper failed. This is a double zipper and the bottom zip pops loose, and the zipper unravels from bottom to the top zipper.<br /><br />I have had other coats fail, but I expected this one to last more than 2 weeks."
1.0,I was supposed to receive skinny jeans these were baggy and wide leg.  Not sure if its an Amazon error or it was mismarked by RAWX.
1.0,Cheap piece of s***! Not even the same color as the picture and the beads don't hang straight down! I wish it wasn't such a hassle to return because if I had known it came from China I never would have got it! I'm so irritated....the beads are flipped upward and hang down at different parts on the necklace! Ugh...just awful!
1.0,Material was too thin so it made the dress clingy ... Shoulders did not fall like picture...
1.0,"Not for me. I went with the short sleeved version of this so I can wear it more often. This one is way too short, fits more like a tunic. This dress is also lined which would be great if it was cut right and you could move in it, instead the lining is constricting and uncomfortable."
1.0,Broke with 48 hrs of wearing it.
1.0,I regretted buying this dress. I don't like the way it looks around the neck line. It does NOT look pretty as it shows on the picture. Don't buy it!
1.0,A huge fail. It fits too big. It’s made as if it’s trying to be baggy on purpose. It’s not flattering at all.
1.0,"So disappointed!!! This medium is sooooo small, it might cover her bottom. If I had time I would send it back immediately!!!"
1.0,Cheaply made. Falling apart at the seam.
1.0,Was to small but im going to alter it to fit me.
1.0,The necklace is not worth the money. Its not wood it has no weight to it to be wood. My wooden hair beads have more weight than the necklace with 3 wooden beads on one loc.. I have no idea as to why people give the  necklace a high mark.
1.0,"Received package and one pair of the underwear were clearly dirty. Either had been worn and returned or something was spilled on them. Not what you want when you buy underwear, especially when giving as a Christmas gift! Very disappointed."
1.0,"Terrible stitching, just poorly made and the skirt is see through"
1.0,"These caps are just way too small, they might work for children but not adults.<br /><br />Also, they are not well made. The strap for adjusting has not been fixed so it won't fray."
1.0,"If I could I would give 0 stars, Don’t purchase this product is a Waste of money, it came pre-use or wet, is rusty and not the right color."
1.0,Doing dishes in fast food a couple hrs a week did not hold up it shredded/ rotted out with in a month was not happy with this at all
1.0,"Nothing like the picture, very cheap, wasn't really expecting a whole lot for the price, but this was ridiculous and they should not be able to post pictures that are not even close to what the product really is, not even worth one star!!"
1.0,I'd like to return this dress for a refund.
1.0,It's gold not silver like it is in the picture and the digits look blurry and cheap quality but the overall look of the watch has a great look to it. I'm returning mine for my money back.
1.0,"The colors aren't the same, the top is very tight, the bottoms come up past the bottom of my ribcage, and there's no rouching on the front to help hide my baby belly. It also took a really long time to get delivered to me."
1.0,"Zipper has already broken! Do you have a return/exchange policy for faulty merchandise?<br />Beautiful and comfortable, but can’t wear."
1.0,These shirt are terrible terrible terrible!! The XL is at best a medium and they are cut wrong!!! Highly do not recommend!!!!
1.0,"Thank you all for your helpful comments on these 'too good to be true' glasses. So glad I checked first as I was considering ordering.<br />Sorry so many people are disappointed - more importantly, watch your charges on your monthly visa/master/amex bills. Perhaps a<br />bigger scam is yet to come. Be careful with your credit."
1.0,"The coat appears thin but it might be warm, there isn’t fluff to it.  I’m writing this review because the inner shell was snapped and zipped in and the first thing I noticed was the tag said 5/6 and the inner shell was way smaller than the outside.  I ordered an 8 so I will have to return.  Which is an extra trip and my son doesn’t have a nice coat for school for 5 more days.  Just a thought before you buy.  I’m not sure how this was missed and it turned into a pain<br />Update: the zipper broke on the jacket within days, so now I can return two coats and rush to find another coat for school tomorrow.  Just say no to this coat"
1.0,"Doesn't look like the photo.  It's made for super short women, both short waisted, shorter than expected sleeves, & shorter length.  I returned it and had to follow up with them to process my return.  I don't recommend this dress or seller."
1.0,"I don't hate the outfit, I hate the fit!  This is the last clothing item I will buy from Amazon. I wear a 16 and bought a 3X to ensure it would fit because I heard their items run small.  I could barely get the romper over my hips and fits like a size 16 crammed into a 12.  I kept it because I'm starting a rigorous diet and exercise plan and should fit it next year when I go on a cruise.  It's a very cute piece, if only I fit into it... #fingerscrossed."
1.0,Give allergies<br />I'm sending back.
1.0,Returned for refund
1.0,Picture came very faded. Looks nothing like the photos on here.
1.0,"I wore it once, and it's coming loose at the seams."
1.0,The hat is ridiculously small. That plastic shield as on picture should cover the face but in reality it is just touches the nose. There is no enough fabric to cover the back of your head. I do not understand why spend time to design such a nice product and than in production to try to save on materials so that no one can wear it. Please stop making useless staff!
1.0,"Not happy with the quality at all! Only wore a couple times and while drying my hands, the horns separated, came completely off the band as if only the smallest amount of solder was used to attach the two pieces together, and then the band went down the floor drain in a public bathroom!! Terrible quality!! Not happy at all!"
1.0,Didn't fit or look like the description online!
1.0,"Way too small, fits weird around my head and as someone with curly hair it’s hard to work with. Doesn’t fit super well unless I tug it down but then It looks awkward. wouldn’t recommend."
1.0,"Item has basically broken after only a few months of use. In pocket, not dropped, but item still has received rips within the accordion style holders.<br />The fastening mechanism seems to slip off easily.....<br />Not impressed."
1.0,Broke after a few hours. Now not returnable because beads and cheap cord went everywhere!
1.0,I purchased this item 5 months ago and it still has a very strong unpleasant odor.
1.0,I ordered a 2XL. It fit like a medium. I gave it to me son. Not true to size whatsoever
1.0,Very thin & NO sparkle!
1.0,too small. I was able to get the dress on but it is not good for curvy women
1.0,"I ordered a Kate Spade keychain/Keyfob, because I love the designer and thought it would be of high quality. The item broke after I tried putting it onto my keychain. I was very disappointed after I spent almost $50.00 on this item. I feel it was probably used if it broke that quickly."
1.0,It says 925 silver and it’s already rusty very cheap material
1.0,"I ordered a small and I received the item which is toooo huge for me , the sizing is misleading"
1.0,"I ordered these socks and my husband and I both tried them and I would say don’t waste your money. My husband work outdoors & he said these socks didn’t keep his feet warm. Also, the socks run big in my opinion for female who wears a shoe size of 8.5."
1.0,"I had high hopes for this bra, but I was really disappointed with the reality of it.  The cups inside the bra keep flipping around and folding in half as you struggle to pull it over your head. The seams under the arms are so scratchy and painfully tight (like there's a weird elastic in that area), that I took the bra off after wearing it an hour and threw it away. The material IS soft everywhere else, but it doesn't provide any support as an actual bra."
1.0,The female end of the snaps broke on three of them as I was taking them out of the package and the ones not broken look ready to break.
1.0,"Extremely cheap, thin material.  It doesn’t look like it would hold up to one wash so I returned it."
1.0,"It was way to small.  Our 9 year old daughter cannot even fit into it, and the shirt was for my wife."
1.0,"I ordered an XXL and I’m an XL. Came THREE SIZES TOO SMALL. I couldn’t even get it past my sides when I put on the vest. Order from their website procosplay.com and do the custom fit option that’s and extra $30, IT’S WORTH IT IF YOU REALLY WANT THIS SUIT."
1.0,Really small and if it does fit it's fairly uncomfortable
1.0,"I paid VERY little but expected at least something. This item is absolutely awful; paper-thin plastic, the additional bag is made of some horrible scratchy fabric. Threw it away!"
1.0,Zippers all broke within a week. Very poor quality.
1.0,Beautiful soft dress. Very upset. It fell apart during the wedding I was at.
1.0,"This shirt is horrible, cheap, and way too small. DO NOT ORDER!!"
1.0,"Small runs big, this is for plus size women so I return it"
1.0,These suck. Way to small and the fit is terrible. I normally wear a large and bought XXL and they were to tight and did not hang low enough.
1.0,The product was not in its original packing and did not have tags and appears to be a returned clothing item which is not disclose when I purchased it
1.0,Ring looks nothing like the picture that is why 2 stars. It is bigger and thicker not like the picture. You can't read the engraving it's black and unreadable. Disappointing...
1.0,This only fits on tiny heads.
1.0,"What was I thinking..oh yes, so cute!  Not cute when it's very poor quality.  I've purchased items made in China & I promise I won't be doing it again.  Please Amazon don't keep marketing this cheap junk!  Price is important but not when it's junk!"
1.0,Product is thin and cheap not sized normally either a little smaller .. not worth price
1.0,"Definitely a dress, not a tunic.  Hits me below mid calf.  Fabric is clingy and unflattering on my plus size body.  The uneven hem pictured does not match the item I received."
1.0,The only thing large on this is the hood. It is way oversized. Not sure if that is what they are calling cowl neck. Made of really thin material.  Didn’t keep.
1.0,Way way too long really thin fabric didn’t like felt vhesp
1.0,These are oversized ankle socks that do not stay on.  Not as expected or as pictured.
1.0,Ridiculously narrow. Both my fiance and I ordered a pair in a size larger than normal in this shoe and a different style stefan janoski and both were too narrow to the point of being painful. Such a shame because it's such a good looking shoe.
1.0,The silver came off almost immediately. The rind then broke when I was removing it to wash my hands.
1.0,Broke on me the first day I put it on!
1.0,Didn't like it looks too cheap.
1.0,"I am 5’4”- 135lbs and purchased the medium. I like my comfy pants a little big. The fitting was great, just not as soft or stretchy as I was looking for."
1.0,"First of all these are NOT rhinestones, they are silver disks GLUES to the dress.<br />Second of all the pattern is not even or centered. There are extras and the pattern tilts to the left on the waistline. I said it fit as expected however never tried it on due to the horrible job on the supposed “rhinestone beading” sending back for refund<br />Don’t waste your time on this one gals, very dissatisfied"
1.0,It came quickly but was TINY! definitely order 2 to 3 sizes up
1.0,"I'm  a women's  medium.  Ordered Large for relaxing  fit.  My shirt would fit an xs-s, or child large."
1.0,I'm not happy with this dress. I'm 110 lbs yet the small size does not fit on  me. It is so transparent and thin.
1.0,"Purse did not look like picture when ordered.  Looks like cheap black plastic.  I tried to look past that and when zipping the pockets, the zippers pull hard and the top zipper does not open very wide to put things in your purse or see in it.  It was returned."
1.0,"I never leave negative reviews because I never have negative experiences with Amazon! BUT... As soon as I opened the package I could smell a hint of mildew! Long story short... Black Mold on my new bundle of joys clothes.. Umm, NO! Returned without a problem. But very unfortunate & disappointed!"
1.0,"First wash, on gentle cycle. Didn't even dry it and the sticker came off! Utter crap. Dont waste you money."
1.0,WEIRD!  It was too snug on the top and waaaay too loose on the bottom.  I sent it back.
1.0,The head phones are heavy and pull below the ears
1.0,Wrong color. One job.
1.0,In less than 2 weeks change the color
1.0,"sizes are wrong, order bigger than what you actually wear. the black dye comes off."
1.0,It looked and felt cheap.  Pattern wasn't flattering
1.0,I wear a small (size 2-4) I ordered an Xl because I’m 6’1 and have long arms. The XL fit like an XS and 3 buttons fell off straight out the package.  I would not buy from this company again.
1.0,This is my first negative review in 6 years with Amazon.What a odd size piece of junk materials! Too late on top too small at the bottom and make of polyester. More like a women's dress. Don't waste your time.
1.0,"This is a joke. I'm tall and lean 5'8, size 2 and put this on and it looks like a blouse that is way too large around the middle section but much too short to wear as a bathing suit cover up. The model must be 4'9!<br />I wound up wearing it as a blouse with a cami underneath but it's so wide it looks like a pregnant shirt.<br />Unless you are very short I don't see how this could possibly work as a bathing suit cover up."
1.0,"I went off the size chart and reviews and ordered a medium. I’m 5’6, 132lbs and a size 4-6 with a 28” waist. This dress was much too big in the waist and hips for me. The dress material was a bit thin and scratchy also but otherwise was ok. Will be returning."
1.0,The material is okay but the button came off the second day and the zipper seems too short.
1.0,Broke the day I got it !
1.0,May ne cheap but this is because it does not work! Mine came non functional
1.0,This pants is just for petite sizes
1.0,"Like the style but did not like the fit, this tunic top runs very small. I'm 5'9 with a 36C bra  sz I'm not a big girl just tall so I purchase the XL and it didn't fit. I wish it came in plus  size."
1.0,"The sizing was way, way off.  I'm usually a 33 or 34 waist and ordered the L and this thing swallowed me up."
1.0,Although the size was appropriate. The leggings did not stay up.on my waist. I was constantly readjusting my clothes
1.0,Cheap thin material. Mine tore at the seams the first time I tried them on. I got to wear them for 2 hours.
1.0,Junk. Returned it.  The XL was at MOST a medium.  The material and craftsmanship was poor. It went back immediately.  It looks nothing like what is pictured - it is see-through.
1.0,Fake.
1.0,Las costuras se están soltando y las cremalleras están dañadas
1.0,That are pretty but the part go to the ear is to thick nead to be small
1.0,"the photo makes the plastic cover look sturdy and it's flimsy, making it feel like you're looking under water through it. Also, it's so thin, any wind just distorts and lifts. It's crap, going to send it to donation."
1.0,It’s more like a sweater and looks nothing like the picture
1.0,"Arrived perfect, however melted after 1 time use. The hat melted. This is so frustrating. I would like a replacement."
1.0,Was disappointed with how faded the print is on it.  I could have bought a much better one for cheaper cost.
1.0,Belt fell apart as soon as I put it on. I will have to remake the belt which I can do. I really like the clasp and can remake it easily and better but poor quality.
1.0,Not a good product! The picture shows the earining curving upwards with the ear...the pair I received they curved upside down and don't stay in position with my ear. I am returning these.
1.0,The cut of the suit is not made for a non Barbie shape. I’m 5’ and 110lb and couldn’t get top coverage no matter now I wrapped it
1.0,"These were satisfactory to begin with. They kept hands mildly warm (even on the hottest setting, they were not hot). But, after using a couple of times a week for a month so maybe 15 times maximum, they have stopped working completely. The batteries still work, but the gloves will not stay on. They light up for 30 seconds and shut off without warming. I picked these gloves as they have battery packs that would be easily replaceable, not thinking that the gloves themselves would die so quickly. I am very disappointed. As it is now just past Amazon's 30-day return policy, I've contacted the company and am waiting to hear from them."
1.0,I would NOT recommend this for anyone<br />I bought it 8 days ago and the chain is already black
1.0,Would be super cute if it didn't arrive broken.  Exchanged it and the new one came broken as well.  trying a different one this time
1.0,"Compré dos, el negro vino bien, S, pero el lila vino M, le queda grande a mi esposa, como podríamos solucionar"
1.0,Ordered three batteries.  Won’t charge in spite of following instructions.
1.0,It was supposed to be 3x but was WAY too small.
1.0,They run very small. I was not happy with the product.
1.0,"Initial inspection of the product showed good quality and as described. BUT I ordered the XL based on sizing chart and it couldn't be more incorrect. See photo. The burgundy pair are these, the black are basically every other XL legging or yoga pant I own. Clearly NOT your normal XL. Fits more like a medium. Will be returning."
1.0,Total waste of money.  They are definately not slip resistant.  Had to call 911 for my father day after they arrived.  He slid on floor between bed and wheelchair
1.0,"Should have fit is way too small, I sent it back"
1.0,I bought this for my son for Christmas broke a few hours after opening it. Don't waist your money speaker held by Velcro.
1.0,"Garbage product. Literally. It went to the garbage. Product looked like it was cut out of the sleeve of a very see-through shirt. That’s how thin the quality was. Not sure what purpose it would serve, as it would neither protect from viruses, nor would it protect from cold. I even tried to double layer the buffs but got frustrated, I threw it all in the garbage."
1.0,Not good. The wig is falling apart within 1 hour of arriving. Very disappointed.
1.0,Did not fit belt buckle.  False Ad.
1.0,"The outfit is cute but it smells like some kind of chemical & immediately gave me a headache. I pray it's not a serious chemical because my head is still throbbing. Also, I ordered a 0-3 month and it's definitely big enough to fit a 12 month old."
1.0,The length is long enough  and its a waste of time and money. I was looking forward to get them and nothing!! Ugh I want my money back!!
1.0,rings werent the correct size
1.0,I have to purchase this shirt since I never received it. Too cute to not buy it .
1.0,Material was stiff and itchy. It was impossible to wear comfortably.
1.0,Sizing is way way off. Maybe have been a child size small instead of a woman’s large.
1.0,"The lenses are not pink like the show in the picture. I thought at first they sent the incorrect ones, so I returned them and ordered another pair. The second ones that came were still not pink. So I returned those and bought a different brand that do have pink lenses and seem just as durable."
1.0,Way to small. I ordered an extra large and it was tiny. I gave it to my daughter in law that wears a small! Disappointed!
1.0,Too tight. Awkward shape for my curvy body maybe.
1.0,I own an original strap and compared it with this one... not the same.<br />1. It does fit.<br />2. It does not have all the Swiss Army markings.<br />3. It has a lighter gauge of plastic.<br />4. The band only lasted 3 days of use before breaking; I am lucking I did not lose the watch.<br /><br />Bought 2 bands the same happened with the 2nd; would not recommend.
1.0,Terrible product. Sizing is way off and deeper won’t allow returns. DO NOT BUY.
1.0,These pants were over priced pajamas. They are flannel material but they are not of good quality. Would not recommend these to anyone
1.0,Very upset it came broken and I had to fix them myself.
1.0,The band is complicated because the pins that it has are the ones without a nip and so it makes it cumbersome for replacing. Very poor quality as the links from the band were not properly connected and it broke off easily. Also the band kinks quite easily and it's a hassle trying to get it straight.
1.0,Received this dress as shown in the pictures. It was balled up in the bag which I thought was odd but ok.  Once I took it out of the bag to try it on I see this huge hole in the back.  Someone wore this dress and returned it.  There were snags throughout the dress as well.  I only posted a picture of one.  The dress it self is very pretty.  I’m awaiting a replacement and I hope it’s in good condition.
1.0,"No packaging, shoes were just in a bag so I received them smashed. Shoes in bad shape. Will never order from this again."
1.0,Was not worth the $  and the size would have fit a 12 year old.  Have returned it.
1.0,Returned. Unfortunately looked and felt cheap.
1.0,Ordered a small it was baggy the pattern isn't flattering at all might be okay to sleep in
1.0,It Came dirty
1.0,Awful product doesn’t fit even though I bought in my size
1.0,The first time I ordered these they arrived nicely arranged in a box. I went to reorder these and they came in a plastic bag with holes. The bag was not sealed and when I pulled the masks out of the bag most of them were scrunched. No telling who touched them before they got to me. Very unsanitary! Will NOT be using these on my 2 year old! For all i know someone dropped these on the floor and hastily shoved them into this flimsy bag.
1.0,Super tight around your front area
1.0,"I ordered this skirt in a 2xl and upon arrival the waist was found to be maybe 18 inches. Really, so disappointing"
1.0,"I give this 1 star based on the fact it ruined my shirt.  It’s like it melted on the shirt. Fir the price I paid I would not expect this to happen.  I was so excited about this bag and now truly sad I can no longer use it for fear of it ruining more clothing. My daughter also bought one with the same type straps and hers did not do this.  I won’t buy again.<br />A refund would be nice, but it’s past the 30 days, so probably won’t happen."
1.0,Have a small to medium wrist and this was too tight even for me
1.0,"No stars....received this yesterday, placed my Galaxy note 5 into wallet, zipper pulled apart on first use... Galaxy note may fit, but not if you want  to zip it up...."
1.0,"This key ring broke after only a few weeks, the pin holding the Saab logo dislodged."
1.0,Not sure how they missed it. Someone with body odor tried it on and sent it back. disgusting.
1.0,I went to wear this dress for the first time and went to zip it up and the zipper was broken. Some of the seams are poorly sewn. Unfortunately too late to return it.
1.0,The clips aren’t the same as the picture I got cheated again by Chinese products
1.0,Nothing like pic. Cheap and thin materials. I never wore it just donated. Waste of money.
1.0,These glasses are okay.. I ordered the brown ones and you can see my eyes. I was hoping they would be a little bit darker so I don’t wear them.
1.0,No benefit to these.  You can't read signs as well and everything is darker.
1.0,Kept coming am loose! Almost lose my watch with this band!
1.0,"Broke immediately, not even worn once."
1.0,Ugly fit
1.0,I do not like a boat neck/too large and color is not like it shows.  I do not like sending back and paying 4.95 for return shipping?
1.0,These were way way way to small width wise and very long length wise.
1.0,Irritated me that it's plastic. Was hoping for a real pocket watch for the ridiculous price. Not happy at all!
1.0,The jacket looks great until you get up close. Hot glue is extremely visible that the chains are held by. And the jacket Frayed easily when moving around after a couple of hours of wearing it... very disappointed
1.0,"So. I bought this shirt. When it came in, it was way to small. I tried to return it, but they just deleted my order.  I can not return.  DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY."
1.0,Horrible.  Sleeves are too wide and the rest of the blouse. I don't recomend it..
1.0,Were broken when arrived
1.0,I wore it one time and the damn glass cabochon broke away from the pendant.  CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!!!!!!!
1.0,Definitely not what I expected.
1.0,"This was/is a beautiful dress! Fit perfectly. Unfortunatly during prom it already began to rip. My daughter text me in the middle of the dance to know it was stating to rip. After spending $80.00 on this dress and already coming apart after 3 hours of wearing it, super disappointing."
1.0,Not usable on high-pressure tires. Used on car tire and the smaller one of the two valves blew. Now air is leaking from the small valve and pump is absolutely useless.
1.0,"I just discovered a diamond fell out of my anniversay band that I bought in March 2022.  This was the whole reason I bought the extra protection to begin with.  Just to find out it is only valid for the fisrt 30 days after the jewelry is bought.  What a waste on my part, very disappointed"
1.0,Totally different color from image
1.0,I ordered a size bigger than normal and they were still to small
1.0,"Not as pictured, comes with a hood pictures show a collar. Very cheaply made! Not even worth $5..."
1.0,"Why would someone by this piece of Made of China crap? The seller/manufacturer cannot even use intelligible or proper english. It looks nice, but will fall apart easily."
1.0,Item too small
1.0,Very low quality. They will stretch out in the first wear.
1.0,"Love the bracelet, but a little to big."
1.0,The lining detached the 2nd time I wore them.
1.0,Wrong Sizing on the chart. The size XL I was sent measures the same as a SMALL. DO NOT BUY!!!  These may be Seconds.... where the seller purchased these DIRT CHEAP and did not check the size problem.<br /><br />GOING BACK!!!!!
1.0,Hey I returned the Jackie because it's to small !
1.0,"Did not get what I ordered. Instead of a small wooden coin, I recieved a multi tool. Text engraving was only on one side rather than both (as I requested)."
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  I ordered this three-piece set in green.  It is very attractive.  However,  IT STINKS!  I aired all three pieces for two weeks, and they still smell so bad that I cannot use them.  I threw them away.  It was a terrible waste of money."
1.0,Fits too lose and weird at the top
1.0,It's cheap and isn't long enough. I should have returned it.
1.0,These pants are not true size. I ordered a 2x based on description and has to give them to my 10 yr old cousin. They run several sizes to small.
1.0,My son wore it only few time and it got all bad it all fell a part
1.0,The product compared to the photo is extremely off! The color is so wrong. I ordered nude pink and this skirt is totally pink. And also I ordered a large and it's about the size of an XS. Also the length is so off its not even funny. I'm 5'6 and I held it at my waist where the model<br />Is shown and it came to my mid calf. I'm very disappointed.
1.0,Product was excellent quality but could not get head through opening.
1.0,Poor quality moon broke off first use
1.0,"It was way too see through on the chest, poor quality... had to return"
1.0,"It was comfortable the first time I wore it, but then it shrank so much after washing that it doesn’t fit. Also, it runs small. I’m disappointed because I’ve bought other sleepwear from this company before and liked it."
1.0,This came broken. The quality is trash. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,"It looks nothing like the picture. Inside the glass ball necklace part, is three or four black seed looking things. It was only $3 or I would of sent it back!"
1.0,Llegó completamente desarmado y por más UE lo mandé a arreglar nunca funcionó
1.0,I returned it right away...looked kind of cheap and trashy.
1.0,First on I ordered was small like a large but I ordered a 3xl so I reorderedand the second one I received was a small. Not ordering again
1.0,Really was excited to wear these...I got a size XL thinking they might be too big because I’m a L but they were too small. Won’t even go up my butt. Very disappointed.
1.0,"The dress looks okay, but it is so uncomfortable to wear. The material is not cotton. Its itchy and uncomfortable, I couldn't wear it long enough to keep it. Also it is very tight around the neck area which I didn't like. I would recommend not buying this dress."
1.0,"This is a wonderful bra if you have full breast it’s a little cheap on the material, and my breast actually looked smaller and flat in this bra because I don’t have big boobs. anyways the point is that I would not pay $20. For this bra"
1.0,"Nice job..ordered the name ""Samantha"" got the name ""Ava"".."
1.0,Unfortunately I was very excited to try these but they don’t stay on. I have a fuller chest so maybe it works for A or Bs? Either way I tried both in the two pack with the same problem. When you attempted to try to tighten even slightly they would start to peel off. Too bad.
1.0,"I was disappointed with these. First off, the part that attaches to your glasses is knobby and uncomfortable. The plastic (it's not fabric) line is rather inflexible and when wearing your glasses awkwardly sticks up. The rubber Costa badge on the back is just that, a badge. It does not allow for you to adjust the line in anyway, like to adjust the tightness of your glasses to your head. It does, for some reason, move around. I'm baffled."
1.0,AVOID! It fell apart after light use and conveniently 7 days after the return period. WASTE OF MONEY.
1.0,Gloves are too thin and heat penetrates. Lining inadequate. The thumb is awkwardly attached. Would not buy again.
1.0,"Initially liked the shirt, but wore and washed it one time and threads came out all over the shirt and now it’s unwearble. Terrible quality for the price"
1.0,I love this style of dress but I have ordered two of this same color and after washing them they came out with blue spots all over the material.  I had ordered another one same color and the same thing happened.  So my advice is to NOT buy this color.  I had ordered almost all colors of this style dress and the same thing happens on other colors also.  Its not my detergent its the material.  BLACK is the only safe color.
1.0,Christmas gift. So embarrassing for the recipient to open the gift & a stone was missing from the earring. Please refund.
1.0,Too much small no Rating star
1.0,I got two right(right/left) earrings and no left one.
1.0,Do not buy these if you are tall LMAO such a joke ...it looks nothing like the picture I have a great shape as well...  So I'm not leaving this review in vain.. I had very high hope for these jeans 😢
1.0,Do not buy this. You will get what you pay for. Flimsy material and falls off ears. Also seam inside is bulky and uncomfortable.
1.0,I was told that it ran small so I ordered 2 sizes larger and still way too small.
1.0,Cute shirt BUT the color stained my skin when I wore it! It was hard to scrub off in the shower.
1.0,Received my T-shirt today and it is nothing like the picture that they provided.  What a disappointment for a Willie Fan.
1.0,This belt fell apart second time I wore it.  Part of the buckle is made of plastic bits that looks like metal.  The screw and nut that holds the buckle on is made of cheap thin plastic.  Broke right off.  Kind of like a practical joke belt that is designed to come apart and let your pants fall down.
1.0,The color is completely diferente<br /><br />I'm too disappointed<br />I'm feeling  sadder
1.0,"Returned , horrible"
1.0,Not the material I imagined reminded me of costume material. I was looking for more of a cotton feel/look.
1.0,"This bracelet is very disappointing. The metal looks dirty and tarnished. The stones are not set in the metal, they almost look glued on top. The metal is SO soft and flexible that you can’t wear it without it getting bent which defeats the purpose of a bracelet. This is for sure NOT worth paying $59.00."
1.0,"What a shame, I received a faulty product! The shirt came dark blue on the upper part and light blue on the lower part."
1.0,"They are inexpensive compared to most, but every other pair was a different size in length and diameter.I bought 4 pair, but can only use 2 pair. So that is still $22 per usable pair. Did I mention they were made in China! I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!"
1.0,Do not purchase this. The cardigan I received was NOTHING like advertised. The sleeves were too short (only came to my elbow) and the sweater was not long like advertised.  Very disappointed and will be returning.
1.0,Glasses were extremely oversized . They kept falling off your face.<br />Not worth the money
1.0,The product was irregular cut for both the shirt and pants. You could not tell the front from the back of the pants.
1.0,Not happy with this jacket at all.  Wish I would have returned it!  Very thin and just hangs really weird.
1.0,"Description says super dark, these are like 35% tint.  I was hoping these were like locs i had before that were close to 2% tint.  If your looking for dark these arent it."
1.0,"Absolutely HATE the polyester fabric. Hate that there is no room to move your arms. Picture looks cute, but the execution is beyond sub-par."
1.0,"I bought these rings specifically because they said they were .925 silver and I have metal allergies.  Where the head touches tail, I can see the metal below the electroplate, and my finger is green.  I knew with the price this was likely the case.  I can't return them because I gave one to a friend.<br /><br />Photos from image not of the product I received.  The eyes on mine are red, and the tail bend closest to the tail is not nearly as deep as the product images."
1.0,"Very pleased with earrings,nice size,work good,made perfectly!!!"
1.0,"The product description is misleading. It has an adjustable strap, but you cannot make the hat Larger only smaller."
1.0,"Seams in pockets not sewn shut<br />I'm 5'2, 125lbs, typically wear a size 8, bought a small and it fits fine."
1.0,Only able to wear once because the material was very cheap and just ripped while putting on one pair
1.0,Shirt was too small and tore.
1.0,Front design does not match back design returned it
1.0,very cheap - broke after a week usage.
1.0,"one size fits all with no guide, am size 12, didn't fit"
1.0,"The second time I went to put these on, the stitched top of one simply unraveled, making it impossible to unfurl it up the arm to the bicep.  The stitching quality on these leaves much to be desired.  And, given the thin material, you can't just over stitch to keep them from unraveling.  They need to be better stitched by the manufacturer so they don't just fall apart.  I've used the other one three times and am waiting for it to unravel to complete an unusable pair.  Considering I bought them only two weeks ago and paid $5 more for the pair than they are selling for now only adds insult to injury."
1.0,"This pair was fine, until the 1st washing. Now the zipper is broken & not on the track. Also, the teeth broke on the zipper broke & are missing. Probably in washing machine somewhere! The other pair I bought had holes in the pocket when I received them. Brand new with holes in the pocket?? THIS PRODUCT IS GARBAGE! If they were 1/2 decently they’d be ok. Probably some 8 year old working in a sweat shop. As you can see I’m NOT happy."
1.0,"Did't even take it out of the package, It smelt like urine and baby puke."
1.0,The dress was nothing like the picture. It was a totally different print and color. Just plain ugly do not buy
1.0,"My daughter really liked this and asked me to order it for her.  I ordered a large size; it took about one month to get the item. When we got the package, it was too small, and I contacted the sale through email.  We never got a response.<br /><br />Poor communication."
1.0,"Earrings arrived bent. Although they are very cute and a lovely size, I think the packaging could be improved to protect the earrings better."
1.0,Not as described.... color is three To four multi colors... a bit upset 😡
1.0,"The product popped on our first trip using it, we owned it less than a month."
1.0,"When I received these, one lens was popped out, and one front lens has a round smudge that won't come off. Very cheaply made, hard plastic, don't fit over your glasses, I tried and failed. Don't be fooled into thinking these are a good item, they are NOT. I forgot to mention, they were just thrown in a envelope with other items, no protection, no care of how they would arrive at buyers home."
1.0,"I wore it twice and the neckline ripped, ive only washed it once as well. It's super cute but bad quality!"
1.0,Clips on this fastinator break very easily. Not secured to the top very well.
1.0,Stitching came apart 1st night wearing it across the belly seam
1.0,"While the design is nice, the color started chipping off after a week.  By week 2 the clasp had completely fallen off.  All in all the quality is not very good for the price they are asking."
1.0,I ordered a size 8 and when I opened the package it looked like a baby shoe. The package or shoe did not have any sizes at all. I was looking forward to trying that style since I have several pairs of oofos shoes but this style cannot be trusted.
1.0,The charms won’t last on crocs! Horrible
1.0,Very nice band but by the 3 rd month it faded and butterflies are not seen very upset
1.0,Glass was broken and liking at how it was assembled didn't give me hope for an exchange being better.
1.0,Broke first wear
1.0,"Purchased the black Lace Crown. Yes, admittedly it is Pretty 'in person,' but obviously Fragile. Unsure if crown will stay in upright position during actual wear. The lower quality is not reflected in the higher price, it is worth about half as much."
1.0,"One sleeve is very tight, th other sleeve is slightly tight...and I do not have heavy arms. Will have to return"
1.0,Plastic smell
1.0,Literally broke as I was taking out of the shipping package. I took it out then tossed right in the garbage waste of money
1.0,This watch is for kids not adults. It did not fit my wrist.
1.0,"The most horrible sunglasses,it was delivered to me broken 😡😡😡"
1.0,"I would have returned these, but for $5.00, it's not worth the bother.  One has a chain that hangs down about 1/4"" from the big pearl, but the other the chain is right against the big pearl, so they are uneven.  Gave to my granddaughter because she'll wear anything."
1.0,"First, it’s not 100% cotton. It’s a weird poly rayon spandex shiny material and irregularly cut. Immediately no."
1.0,The coverage over the boobs is too small (and mine are not that big).
1.0,"This is not sleeveless. It’s more like short sleeves. Not as pictured.  Looks like a box. I’m 5’7, 140<br />Lbs, bought a medium. Returned it."
1.0,The stripes in this outfit are not red as it appears in the picture.
1.0,the soft freaking wraps broke in the first two days!
1.0,Does not fit right
1.0,This fits a small child.
1.0,Normally a medium but bought an L as I wasn’t sure. Top didn’t fit and the bottom (cake part) you’ll need something to set it out and shape the figure otherwise you’ll just look like a smashed cake.
1.0,"My son was very excited to receive this item. As soon as he received the necklace he went to put his ranger crystal in and it doesn't stay, it falls right out. Now I am not able to return it because I am a day past return date, which is my fault for not paying attention."
1.0,Lost its silver coating before 3months lost its gem by 6months<br />All that’s left is the engraving<br />Not worth the $
1.0,cheap crap
1.0,Material was see through and the swimsuit was 2 sizes bigger than ordered
1.0,"Shirt tore apart after just one time use., huge holes on the back . very poor quality"
1.0,"I literally went to dial in the time and date and the plunger broke, rendering my watch broken in approximately 120 seconds. I removed the facade protectors AFTER the watch was already broke. I got what I paid for, just thought it would've made it on my wrist. It looks nice, despite being broken."
1.0,Very cute.  But the earrings are free roaming on that chain so they can flip and turn and make you look like you’re wearing cheap earrings.  I’m going to have to glue it
1.0,Horrible all rusty and old looking! I didn't even wear it.
1.0,"The latex/chemical smell is so strong, I was unable to use this mask."
1.0,"The sunglasses broke within the week of getting them and it was not from being dropped or crushed, just normal wear."
1.0,"Falto la pulsera, únicamente recibí el collar!"
1.0,Fell apart in 2 days. Strap separated from liner. Metal clasp malfunctioned and a piece broke off making it unusable.
1.0,"These used to cost $1.85 a pair. That's what they cost last time I purchased some. They are cheaply made and the frames bend easily and the nose pads break off easily. These are ""throw away"" low-quality sunglasses. I wouldn't pay the $9.94 they are now asking, you can get better for cheaper at a gas station."
1.0,terrible product....lost one of them.  the clasp doesn't do the job.
1.0,"Didn't work, still uncomfortable to drive at night."
1.0,So ugly I didn’t want to look at it any longer and put that hard cardboard shorts back in the plastic bag and hit return. I’m a size 4. I ordered the 6 and it’s way too small. It says it’s an XL. These Chinese shorts will fit a child not a woman with hips.<br />Don’t order these unless you want your thighs to sweat unnaturally.
1.0,It was not an xl. Very small and flimsy material. Almost a night shirt. Not a dress at all. I returned it.
1.0,"I had to return it , it came broken"
1.0,"Based on the picture in the listing, it seemed that the picture was positioned so as not to lose any of the image; however that was not the case. With any sewing project, your fabric will lose anywhere from 1/2 inch to 2 inches depending on what you are sewing. Because the fabric has not been adjusted, poor Mando lost more than a third of himself in the zipper casing and hems. In addition, the fabric did not feel nice. It was very plasticy. It was highly disappointing. I'm glad that I ordered ahead and had enough time to find a different hoodie."
1.0,It was way too short and it has an awful smell to the material. It smells like propane. Very unhappy with this purchase.
1.0,"Cheap, they shrank like crazy- not the size listed"
1.0,"Well, I opened up the delivery package and I was pleased with the packing of the actual item. The bars were neatly packaged in a small storage bag. I took them out, decided what color I wanted to wear, washed it per the instructions and put it in my navel. I went to show my husband and the actual ball that sits in the navel broke in half. I had the thing in for maybe 2 minutes. Save your money. The concept is great, the quality... not so much."
1.0,very poor product i need to return did not last one day of wearing. so dissatisfied. i hope the manufacture will  contact me and send another item to me as i still have the broken one to return
1.0,Don't buy these glasses I got then and 2 weeks later the Lens frame broke these glasses are made of nothing!!!!!
1.0,"Looking forward to return label this item is way to small looks like a corset....it's not true to size,would like to return for refund on my credit card ..thanks for helping me"
1.0,I order a size 10 more like 9 1/2 not happy about them
1.0,Too small for a 9 1/2 shoe size
1.0,The beads are pretty large and don’t look good on my small wrist.
1.0,Sizing way off and material is cheap
1.0,"3 of the 6 screws ripped out in less than 500 miles after the initial placement.  Terrible, cheap material."
1.0,dress is not size appropriate -
1.0,"I should have listened to the reviews. The shape of the dress was a very awkward shape and the fabric is very costumy, very rough and see through"
1.0,"So, my clear search for women's watches led me to this. It was made by a company called Hula Girl, which also led me to believe this was a women's watch. Opened it up and it's huge. Not an in-between unisex size at all. Again, this was listed in women's watches. Especially with a company name like that, the manufacturer should clearly put in their description that this is a men's watch!"
1.0,"I am more disappointed in the amazon display than the product.  never took the pants out of the box, they were not what was pictured in my opinion."
1.0,Sent back..no refund yet..
1.0,"I received the band two days ago. It doesn’t have the most secure hold of my tracker. Yesterday it popped out onto the kitchen floor. I figured if it happened once it’s not a big deal. I may have had it not in fully or whatever. Since then I’ve kept a closer eye on if the tracker is still seated in the band. Tonight as I was leaving work, it popped out again. I didn’t notice until I was already halfway home. Went back after dinner, and there was the tracker. Sitting on the pavement. Scraped up. Screen damaged. I’m going back to the original band that the gotcha came with."
1.0,"Shorts fit great, top was child-sized"
1.0,I liked the look of this wallet when I received it.  I transferred all my cards to it and tried it out for about one week.  For some reason it was hard to pull out my credit cards.  The last time I pulled out my Visa card the front pocket ripped all the way down the stitch line.  It is a paper thin plastic so not surprising that it ripped so easily.  I went back to Johnston&Murphy and found an RFID &#34;front pocket&#34; wallet like my old one.  It is real leather so it costs around $30 more.  But it will never rip apart and I usually keep them for many years.
1.0,Fall apart
1.0,"Definitely not as described. Colors are off significantly. This is more of a dingy grey blueish than the more teal like picture that is shown. The knot isnt as pictured, arms a small and kind of tight. Ordered a medium. Should have went with a small for the chest, but a large for the length. Not Recommended."
1.0,Broke as soon as it was put on
1.0,"Poor quality. The back didn’t fit my daughter correctly, it hung off her back on one side. I ordered a size down and it still fit her big. After one hour of wearing it, the bottom part tore. It was cute but terrible quality"
1.0,"This color was great, but the material isn't good for Arizona weather."
1.0,the quality of the fabric was poor and they are quite large.  Good for around house or yard work I suppose.
1.0,Fell apart within 2 hours
1.0,I returned them.  The description said ear loops.  They were slits in the side.  To hard to pull them over kids ears.
1.0,"For reference, I’m 5’10 and 145 lbs, size 6, and I ordered a medium in these shorts. I’m not a very experienced biker and have never bought bike shorts before but from my first experience, these do NOT FIT RIGHT. The sizing was correct; they were snug on my waist and thighs and did not roll. They were extremely thin and see through and FIT LIKE A DIAPER. They gave me a HUUUUGE bulge in the front which was super embarrassing. I ended up wearing some compression shorts over these to cover the bulge and thinness. Wore them anyways on my first ride (15 miles) and they fit HORRIBLE and rubbed between my legs awful the whole time. I might just throw them away. They came from China and are not worth trying to return at this point."
1.0,Runs big and not comfy
1.0,"These were way to small.  gave them away to a neighbor with toddler children,"
1.0,"I think factory's quality control doesn't do their job. Invisible zipper was bubbling, I had to remove the zipper completely and closed the side seam since fabric is stretchy enough"
1.0,No. Dress is two to three sizes larger than it should be. Shipping was fast yes but this dress is massive.
1.0,"I was robbed!! Ordered a 5x took a whole month to get here and the tag says 5x but the item is xl and material is super thin, and pockets ripped off as soon as I put my hand in them... Please don't buy from this company you'll waste your money!!"
1.0,Poor quality. Looks nice in ad but I wasted my money buying
1.0,This dress was too large and the material and workmanship were very poor quality.
1.0,"Had it for less than six months and it snapped in half. No wind, no real damage. Just another overpriced cheap product."
1.0,What the heck is this? Are you kidding?! This is an ugly orange discusting color! NOTHING. AT.ALL like the picture!!! NO glitter NOT Gold. So pissed right now..
1.0,Got this because with my nails I can never get my clasps and wanted to be able to wear multiple necklaces easily and quickly. This magnet is terrible! I’m worried to wear it because if you accidentally bump the necklaces they fall off! This is not going to stay on at all!!!
1.0,The bottom is way too big and the top is way too small. Ordered a medium. Usually wear a small in Victoria's Secret swimsuits.
1.0,"After two washes and  a lot of airing out, this sweater still stinks of chemicals.  The smell comes off on me, so I stink  too.  Too bad.  I will probably never wear it again."
1.0,Broke already after only having it a week
1.0,The boots have a tint of pink to them. They look more tan in the picture than they do in person. They fit slightly big. Biggest problem I have is they are very cheaply made. Mine came with a stain and a zipper that almost fell off before I even tried them on. I will be sending these back for a refund.
1.0,The Cadillac emblem broke off after only a few days of using the keychain. I have no idea where it broke off so I don’t know where the emblem even is to glue it back on.
1.0,"Very thin also order one size down, I'll give it one star because I like black tops."
1.0,It was delivered with out the skirt!!
1.0,The chain broke  it was a b day gift
1.0,"I was very excited to receive this sweatshirt, when I got it the colors were mostly orange and the fabric of the sweatshirt was not comfortable, felt like very cheap material, it’s true to size and doesn’t stretch"
1.0,I have these in black and grey in a size 9. These wouldn't even allow my foot into it
1.0,"I ordered 2 necklaces from them about 4 months ago, i haven’t received anything. Ive been asking for a refund for about 2 months now. It’s really frustrating because I just got them to give out on a trip I was taking. they look great but buy at your own risk please. Buy something more worth it. I would honestly give it a 0 star if I could. They don’t want to give me my money back. Save your coin bruh honestly."
1.0,I hate cotton. I live in FL. Sweltering heat and humidity. I have no cotton shirts. I foolishly bought this for the color and graphic. Its unwearable. The stiffness and cheapness. The shape looks weird. I paid to much for a cheap scratchy walmart type shirt
1.0,Cheap material bag handle was broken when delivered. Returned
1.0,"This would fit if I were extremely short.  It fits everywhere except height.  I’m only 5’4” so I’m not tall, but the way this fits one would think this was made for children.  If you order a smaller size you need to be no more than 5’ for this to fit."
1.0,I ordered a yellow dress and I got a yuke green
1.0,carry  carekey and money
1.0,Way to small. I can't wear it
1.0,I dont like it!! Is no like pictures
1.0,it broke as soon as I tried to put it on it looked so pretty but poor quality. I was not happy at all
1.0,I didn't like them. They look like something you get out of a quarter machince. But because they are so small no one notices but you. Remember you get what you pay for. Took 3 weeks to arrive. I'm still wearing them I just wished they looked better.
1.0,Low quality! See-through. Wrinkly.
1.0,The size is very misleading. Not a comfortable fit.
1.0,"Not, what I expected"
1.0,Product did not match description. Gage and length were long so I was unable to wear it. I love the these birds and I was highly disappointed That I couldn’t wear it after searching for a few weeks.
1.0,Looks great. But made my wrist green.
1.0,"I ordered the brown nearly a month ago, and it finally arrived today. No note at time of order that it would take so long, but based on the label it appears the dress shipped directly from China.<br /><br />My usual size is medium (6-8) and that's what I ordered. The dress is too small throughout by atleast one size, probably two because the fabric has no stretch and is incredibly thin. I could barely get the thing on, let alone wear it out of the house. The color is also lighter than the picture.<br /><br />To return, you have to print out a label And ship back to the seller.  I'm not sure it's worth the effort and wait to do so."
1.0,The front is ditched  crooked.<br />Makes center off<br />Looks really bad<br />Puckers
1.0,Horrible. Don’t stick at all. I have larger breasts and I would not recommend at all.
1.0,Clasp broke immediately.  They put a sheet in the box to contact them and not Amazon to cover up they are a SCAM!  watch is worth maybe $1.50 if it had a band you could wear.  I wish I could give negative stars.  What a ripoff.
1.0,Ordered a 5X. But was sent a 2X. Of course they are very very small. Returned them.
1.0,"I've only washed it once, and the lettering started coming off.  I haven't even worn it yet. At this rate I'll probably only get two times wearing it before you won't even be able to read it, and I will have to throw it away."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:a959e4283f9aa957aca784fd4c56d7c1]] A real piece of crap I have to spend almost $30 to send this thing back and Amazon is not backing me up this is bull crap
1.0,"I bought this item for an ADULT female friend, but this item is more for a young child!<br />It is very tiny and the chain is very short!"
1.0,"These are not sterling silver plated in rose gold. I've been wearing one for a couple of months and the plating wore off on the part that stays in my piercing. That section is black and caused my piercing to become inflamed, bleed,  and incredibly painful. Removal of the earring was extremely difficult."
1.0,Unfortunately they run as children's sizes. The extra extra large is equivalent to a women or Junior 0
1.0,I was so excited to get this diaper bag. I used it for 1 month and couldn’t stand it anymore!! The bag itself is SUPER heavy! When you add everything you need in it it feels like you’re carrying a bag of rocks. There are lots of pockets but are not useful since you can’t bottles or soppy cups in them. It looks like a big bag but can’t hold as much stuff as my other diaper bags. So I’d have to pack fewer things and would still be much heavier than all my other diaper bags. So disappointed.
1.0,The gold is not like pictured and it rubs off
1.0,I could make better quality earrings from a $5 trip to Michael's. These are maybe worth like $2. Not kidding.
1.0,This is my second because they RIP off the bar if snagged etc. Comfy but not the best quality good for the price though.
1.0,"Bad purchase.  This dress is bright yellow.  It should be listed as a maternity dress.  The waist of the dress sits on the bust with a fitted look, but flowy from the bust down.  Also, the material is sheer."
1.0,mala calidad y diferente a la foto.  la compre con otro vendedor de mejor calidad.<br />todo corre 2 tallas pequeña.
1.0,Beware***This is not the correct print or material. Cheap knock off.  Material feels like plastic.  Pattern Does not match the picture.  This is my second order and I know it’s not Correct.  I ordered from a different seller an received the right print.  Seller has not responded to refund or claim.
1.0,"I really, really wanted this nightgown to fit properly.  If I was built like a boy with humongous breasts, it may have worked out.  Seriously.  It was skin-tight from my under-bust through my thighs, but had enough room in the top to house an entire NFL team.  On top of that, the buttonholes were too small for the buttons ... I wondered why the brand-new item came with none of the buttons fastened.  The fabric was thin, but the nightgown was well sewn.  I returned it."
1.0,"I'm petite and knowing that runs small,  I ordered in Medium...so disappointed it's very small ..and is not cheap, I can buy a better blouse for the same amount 10:56 and don't wait more than two weeks"
1.0,It broke after a week of having it
1.0,This product looked like the logo was white and it turns out it is pink !!! Very disappointed because it was a gift for my bf
1.0,"THEY ARRIVED BROKEN, AND SHOULD'VE COST $2.99 --- TERRIBLE QUALITY."
1.0,"Fits small, fabric feels cheap, & zipper won't zip. Definitely returning."
1.0,"Website description said to my niece from AUNT but they sent one that says love, uncle."
1.0,Don't buy!!!
1.0,I've had it for about a month. Liner inside is cracking and the shell is starting to reshape so it won't close all the way. Not good. Not good at all.
1.0,Not good look if wear it
1.0,No crotch area!
1.0,"These are advertised as boys pants and they appear to have deep side pockets, but what arrived were definitely girls pants with very small pockets and flowers on the tag.  My son took one look and rejected them.  They don't look at all like the picture advertised."
1.0,"Not every happy with this product. It doesnt stick to my body well, it bends and wrinkles on my back, and it slides up. Not comfortable at all. I would like my money back."
1.0,Watch is completely frozen.  The dials are turning but the digital display won't change and the buttons won't work.  Son is very upset with this watch he got for Christmas
1.0,I could fit 2 of me in those pants.  HUGE.  Not true to size at all!
1.0,They are to small. They hurt my feet. I don't know if they were miss sized or what but I am very disapointed.
1.0,No stretch. No wiggle room. It had to be returned.
1.0,"poor quality, not worth the money.. asking for a refund"
1.0,This is awful don't even waste your time or money.
1.0,AWFUL. Got a large because everyone reviewed it runs true to size. IT DOES NOT RUN TRUE TO SIZE. A large is literally a size 2. Awful
1.0,"This is a very pretty toe ring. It's exactly what I wanted except that the back side of my toe turned green. This cannot be 14k gold. I'm not surprised given the low cost, but I had hoped the description was accurate. I've worn a 14k toe ring bought at a jeweler's for 20+ years with no problems but one day wearing this toe ring and the evidence is clear."
1.0,Waaayyy off in sizing. I ordered up a size and still couldn’t button it. It’s super cute so if you don’t have a large chest it could be a good option.
1.0,Was not what I wanted.
1.0,Was way too big for even an adults head
1.0,"I purchased too small, sent back."
1.0,Not true to size.  Go up one size when ordering
1.0,"insanely small, it’s all ironed on, i thought it was inside out at first, horrible material."
1.0,The size I irderes and receives is xxxl/16.  It ryns VERY small.  It waa more like a medium or maybe large/10
1.0,"Dont buy , they dont protect ur eyes"
1.0,Terrible quality. DO NOT BUY
1.0,Looks great but the hook got Broken before i use it.
1.0,"Order a lot larger then Normal as it is probably 2 sizes smaller, other then that, it's great!"
1.0,Shrunk in first wash.
1.0,I’ve bought this necklace and this one came looking used the xx had no shine and the chain on this one was tarnished. I’ve never had an issue before
1.0,Runs about 2 sizes too small
1.0,"Cheap lace. Not as good of quality as the photos.  Looked like a nice party dress for my granddaughter's birthday but, it was wide and not party quality. Where the tulle is attached is sewn crooked.  Fabric in front is sheer. My granddaughter put in in her dress up box."
1.0,This swimsuit was worn and returned. The bottom no crotch protection sticker and the butt part of the had pilling straight out of the bag. Top was also completely untied.
1.0,I ordered an extra large and this was definitely no where near an XL! It barely went over my head let alone covered what it was meant to cover. I love flamingos but with these pjs you definitely won’t be able to tell their flamingos cause of how strech they’ll be. Even ordering a size up if you’ve been blessed won’t help ya with these!
1.0,Does not hold shape even with very minimal wear. Someone can cough across the room and it will fall out of shape.
1.0,"Awful, bought 3 of them. The XXL’s zipper fell off immediately on opening the package. The small didn’t even have a zipper. The medium had a zipper that worked but all 3 are very, very thin. Save your money and buy a different product."
1.0,It say for boys & girls. Ordered for my 8 yr old grandson. He a L in kid size. This shirt would almost fit me. It must be adult size.
1.0,"Unfortunately,  the picture far surpassed the actual quality of the product.  The fit was awkward-the top was too big, no padding. The bottom was too small.  The material was extremely thin.  I knew the piece wouldn't be the most durable, because of price,  but I had hoped for more."
1.0,A hole tore in a seam after wearing it a single time.
1.0,Requested a return. was sent a label to place in box with item but no return MAILING label after 7 days. Cannot contact seller. (No info) VERY POOR SERVICE ON THIS PRODUCT. DO NOT BUY. Now stuck with TOO SMALL RING. The sizing is inaccurate. I wear size 12 college class rings. Ordered size 12 and ring will only fit pinky finger. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT IS A FARCE. DO NOT BUY
1.0,"I'm sure these are very nice lenses if they were what I thought I ordered. They are too small to fit my Hollbrook frames, therefore useless to me. I'll be returning them."
1.0,It’s a cheap hat. I’m keeping because it’s a laugh. The hat in the pictures is obviously worth more. This hat is a knock off. I’m going to make it work.
1.0,Literally broke as soon as my friend took it out the package. Terrible birthday gift !
1.0,This purse is absolutely adorable and I was so excited when I got it. But then unopened the package and it was already falling apart. The straps were coming off and the outside feels like a cheep plastic. I was extremely disappointed!
1.0,Looks nothing like the photo. Chain is large and cheap. The loops through the pearl-like bead are ginormous.
1.0,This costume does look like it does in the photos with the exception of several different spots there were holes in the seams. The quality is poor at best.
1.0,Didn’t last very long before they broke. Worst glasses ever!!!
1.0,I absolutely loved this necklace until the clasp broke after wearing it the first time. :(
1.0,Very disappointed. Came damage and was too small
1.0,Misleading ur does not go on your wall. It goes on a window or a mirror
1.0,Too small and very stuff uncomfortable fabric that kind of cut into my skin...
1.0,"They are so large, and heavy, you cannot wear them as earrings."
1.0,Band broke/tore after 2 days.
1.0,Very cute and nice fit but arrived torn at the crotch area. I am disappointed as they are cute. Returning them.
1.0,I was really looking forward to wearing these beautiful earrings but unfortunately they fell apart as soon as I opened the package.  Very disappointed.
1.0,They were way too small for me. I would use these for a child or young teen maybe for a petite woman. Only one pair seemed to be decent size
1.0,The quality was horrible. It’s a sweatshirt and the tag said dry clean?  Also seams were stitched together pathetically.  This is was happens when I don’t learn and still buy from China.
1.0,"Terrible fit, doesnt look flattering on anyone, me and my friend with different body types tried it. The shape and cut is just weird for an average height adult."
1.0,The high part was in the front rather than the back as shown...returned
1.0,This broke after just a few days of wearing it! Disappointing.
1.0,Don’t buy . Waste of money
1.0,This dress was sewn wrong. The center seem was crooked and the pieces to tie were different sizes and sewn into different shapes.
1.0,"I loved these when I first received them. They were very comfortable but after 2 wears at the gym, they ripped! There might possibly be good and bad batches due to the mixed reviews... if so, I definitely got the bad ones."
1.0,Maybe it was me who didn’t choose well... but these earrings are too long and look awkward on ear. Uncomfortable.
1.0,"Very underwhelming. Lint sticks to it terribly, looks gawdy and provides little to no protection. Not worth the money you buy.... not worth the money to return"
1.0,Didn't fit at all. Too small. Rough material. Poorly made.
1.0,Photo is much nicer than Product.
1.0,"Worst quality product I have ever purchased, Its intended use was for post surgery, worn maybe ten times now garbage.Do not buy., even for its low price."
1.0,Don't waste your money! These pads don't hold up well and don't stay in place. These are only a couple of weeks old! I purchased a pair of Nocry pads with straps that go higher on the thighs. Very happy now.
1.0,I am 5'10&#34; and typically a size 12/14. I ordered a size XL. It is about 4 inches too short.
1.0,The charm didn't look nothing like the picture and the words wasn't even able to read it at all. returned it
1.0,To small and color was off.
1.0,This item is entirely too small to fit over anyone's head to get around their neck. Greatly disappointed!!
1.0,Made very poorly.<br />Would have been charged for shipping so I donated it to Goodwill.<br />Really really unhappy with this .
1.0,Item broken after a few wears.
1.0,Not polarized. This is blatant false advertising.
1.0,"I was so excited to receive this bag for Christmas to take on my honeymoon. However, this product was not durable. By the second day of our vacation, the bag was ripping and on the third day it completely ripped where the rope went through and dropped the whole bag on the ground. We only ever had a towel, a book, and two sunscreens in this bag, it was never too heavy or even close to full. Very disappointed with this product."
1.0,"Do not buy unless you only plan on wearing it once. It's a nice looking belt and I was so excited to wear it. I got to work and the very first time I went to the bathroom, I noticed the layers had come undone already where the buckle clasped together.  By the end of the day, half of the belt had come undone. Seems like Elmer's glue would've held the layers together better. Very disappointed in this product... Two thumbs down."
1.0,Way too big. And they look like cheep plastic.
1.0,The shoe is wide and sloppy looking.
1.0,Way too small. Like it's meant for a childs head.
1.0,"The band on the smaller size is particularly short, don't order unless you're a very petite lady. Tried to return it and missed the return window, no option to request a new return, so now I'm stuck with it."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:368ce99857319d86c8e198e9fb0ef927]] The product quality is very poor, put in China, It's not even worth a dollar！"
1.0,"This fits more like a long t-shirt, rather than a dress.  It's not terribly flattering on me, I feel a little like I'm wearing my husband's shirt.  The collar bunches oddly on me, I really don't care for high necked shirts in general, but this one is particularly awkward.  The color is not a deep royal blue, not even close.  It's just a washed out looking blue.  Also, the pockets are too high!  It's just a weird shirt..."
1.0,"Received ontime. As pictured,"
1.0,"they do not give you all these different rings in the picture.  they give you about 4 different styles, and then 16 of the same exact kind.  And they look like they come out of a bubble gum machine.  But you get what you pay for!"
1.0,"I dont understand all the good reviews. These are rough cotton, and not even seen together in some places. Junk."
1.0,The mask looks nothing like the picture. Very disappointed.
1.0,Did not last long
1.0,Earrings broke after first wearing.
1.0,The product I received seemed like it had been used. It had hair on the necklace which is not okay at all.
1.0,Didn’t work. Never heated after charging.<br />Poor quality<br />Return wasn’t free even though the sellers photo of item states that it is a free return.<br />Still waiting on refund.
1.0,I just open this package tonight and this dress was awful. It had a horrible smell and stains on it and it is thin as I don’t know what. I will definitely be returning because looks poorly made and smell like they sent me something that someone had worn before and I was not pleased at all. I wanted to take picture of it but it smell so bad for don’t want to take it out the package again.
1.0,Doesn't stay on glasses
1.0,The sizing of the skirt is WAY off!  I ordered the next size up just to make sure it would work for me but It didn’t!  The 3X that was sent to me had to be a small.  Disappointed!
1.0,Run to<br />small
1.0,"Runs very small, and the fabric is very weird. It's a sort of work-out foamy spandex."
1.0,cheap quality. fell apart when putting them on.
1.0,"This was extremely short, and my four year old is petite. It has adjustable straps (like a bra) and even on the longest setting her chest showed."
1.0,"The Gold is fade, No good"
1.0,Tutu is so wrinkled that the dress looks ugly :( Impossible to make it look good
1.0,"These shorts are designed terribly. They do not fit anything like pictured on the model. They go way above my belly button [[extremely high!]] and are big around the waist, but at the same time they are too snug across the butt. Not comfortable or flattering in any way.  I even tried rolling the wide elastic waist down and they were still awful. I would never be happy with these. I put them right back in the package to return…"
1.0,Junk turned black within a couple days!!
1.0,Way too small - I ordered a large which I’m usually either a medium or a large to allow for busy size. This shirt wouldn’t go over my busy first (large C cup) and then if it had it would have ended ABOVE by belly button
1.0,Omg the arms are a size small and the dress itself fits like a 2x. I hate to send things back but i have no choice.
1.0,I did not like the qualility as the edges are raw and not seamed.  Looks really poor.
1.0,"Poor quality material and not sewn correctly. I sew many things, so when I buy clothing I expect the sleeves/hems not be bunched up and have straight seems/stitching. The material is almost see-through. I have returned this item because I have under garments from Hanes that are better quality. If this is bought as a pj top and a much lower price, I might have kept it. But then again I can get better quality tops from the dollar store than this top."
1.0,Hated it. Ran wayyyyy small and made funny.
1.0,Slippers fell apart already and only been wearing for 3 days! Would NOT recommend at all
1.0,They came fast and the packaging  was great. However the product was 1$ store quality. Also they were so dark that i had trouble seeing at noon. Not a great buy.
1.0,The legs are far too wide and roll up when walking. They provide little coverage.
1.0,With the open toes the foot portion of the sock bunches up when trying to put on shoes.  Waste of money.  Can't wear.
1.0,XL Too small if your an American
1.0,"This WAS an awesome purse but after wearing it for a week, the strap ripped off. Maybe if you don't carry very much in the purse, it wouldn't do thus. But it's not a Small purse so it holds more stuff, so the strap SHOULD be strong enough to hold onto it. Very disappointing and it's trash now."
1.0,"2 of the 5 jewelry items would not unscrew and another one was missing a stone. The size was smaller than expected as well. I wish the description had been more detailed, it was a waste of my money. I cant wear any of them."
1.0,"I cant put quality and this swimsuit in the same sentence. I have a lot of issue with this swimwear but the biggest one is the color bleeding. It destroy my whole load of laundry. Also, the cups padding are too little and deformed and they look so awkward.<br />I would not recommend anyone to purchase this piece of something."
1.0,The bands are too short for my wrist.
1.0,"You get what you pay for. I never did end up wearing this. The material was very thin and didn’t feel like bathing suit material, it was too big in the chest and was a very unflattering fit. For reference I am 5 4 and 145 pounds and ordered a small. I don’t have a large chest but if I did I still wouldn’t recommend as the material is soo thin and skimpy."
1.0,"Wayyyyyy to small, if u have any kind of hips to you, don't buy this."
1.0,"The image advertisement shows the feathers fanned out a little, but came in the mail tiny and skinny and worst of all it came FOLDED in a TINY box.......  I placed a book on top of them hoping they'll sit flat."
1.0,Turned my nose green.
1.0,"I had seen the review regarding to this cosplay not being the best, but I decided I would try purchasing it. That was the biggest mistake. First off, it looks nothing like it does in the photo. The ears and tail they included, are very cheap. I couldn't even ""attached"" the tail with the ribbons it had on. The little bow with the bell wasn't straight and has a hair clip to ""attached"" it. Yet the little heart shaped pin with handwritten ""Chocola"" had a glue safety pin on it. The word ""Chocola"" was not written straight. The arm sleeves did not fit at all. The gloves look nothing like the actual photo of the Chocola figure. The gloves were way too big and had a few holes near the wrist part. The black part of the shirt, was decent but if you're looking for accurate sleeves, they don't stand up. When I tried it on, the sleeves laid flat. The ribbon on the bra part was sloppy and the ""bows"" don't even look similar. The skirt, had multiple dirt and spots on it. I don't understand why there would be so many on it. The little hearts were glue on messy. The apron for the skirt, does not fit if you put it in the belt loops. The apron just sag or pulled into the loops. The little hat didn't even stay, doesn't look like the photo, and it's held by ribbons. The stockings are black, and had no stripe on them. Lastly the bow, does no hold up to the photo. I was at least hoping for some interfacing inside it to help the bow stand, instead it looks very sagging. There were multiple holes on the bow, showing it wasn't even sewn correctly. I honestly doubt I'll be getting a refund or part of my money back after reviewing it. Save yourself the time, and money and don't order this."
1.0,I dislike  the fact that it was way bigger than expected....size is really off I have to return  it
1.0,"Lol Idk how this has such good reviews. It looks very cheap, like a Halloween costume. You could definitely wear it if you’re going as a pirate. Material is also pretty sheer, you can see any undershirt you have on (or don’t have on). It is not cute."
1.0,This item ripped open in less than a month of recieving it. And when it opened I see it was stuffed with garbage...
1.0,"Like several other reviewers, I purchased these because of the ""easy on/off"" feature.  They are NOT easy to get off!  I only wore them twice before deciding the struggle to remove was not worth it.  Once on, they were ok but tighter & shorter than other brands.  My biggest disappointment was with the degradation of the fabric.  An incredible volume of lint and pet hair became embedded in the feet after just TWO machine washings/dryings. You can't even pick this ""stuff"" off, as it's bonded to the fabric.  Hand washing/air drying might  have prevented this, but the description on Amazon says ""machine washable"".  I used a short wash cycle and low temp dry.  Too ugly now to donate to charity so they're going in the trash."
1.0,I must receive the bands on 3rd of march but I still fidnt received any thing so I asked for refund
1.0,Inaccurate sizing.
1.0,"These do nothing but make everything blurry unless you stand one foot from the light, even then the effect is poor. Complete waste of money!"
1.0,"Great wallet for ONLY card use only. I carry three cards where strap is located, two behind it , one in ID window, and two in outside where thumb hole is located for a total of eight cards.<br /><br />How ever the money clip is very weak. Only used for about a week and I cannot even hold bills. I had two bills in the clip and my money would fall out because the clip does not close all the way. I tried to add more paper money for a total of about 13 bills and the clip is still very weak."
1.0,I ordered a D cup but it still doesn't work. Whenever I try to wear it the stick pads just peel right off. It never stays.
1.0,"I bought this shirt larger so I could wash, & dry it with the idea that it would still FIT...  That was not the case.  It runs small, order 2 sizes up if you want to dry it.<br /><br />I will be returning this product."
1.0,not like the picture. very disappointed. returned
1.0,Unfortunately My shirt had two pen marks on the shoulder and a small hole by the chest area. I had to return it. Hopefully the replacement has no issues.
1.0,"Cheaply made, doesn't sit quite right and fell apart as soon as I put it on, will not buy again. I was upset this one didn't work out for me, it is such a cute piece."
1.0,Catches lint like crazy... this pic is only about 2 hours after purchasing
1.0,"It’s fitting that this product came unbuttoned, because it was never going to button on me. Despite checking the fit guide and reading product reviews, this item (an XL) probably fit more like a size 6 waist. It was also form fitting rather than an a-line skirt. Have returned."
1.0,My daughter has only worn these about 3 times. They broke. From being bent to make then stay in.
1.0,"Poorly made, lining end midway at the back. Looks very tacky. Nothing like picture online."
1.0,I bought this for my 5th grade son on 9/18/18 and it last only 4 weeks. One set of wheels broke. I was extremely disappointed because then we were left with a $47.99 back pack.
1.0,So small I can't even use it. Waste of money I can't get back. Very dissatisfied.
1.0,I dislike the fact the it a did NOT fit and i sized up to a 3x and when i got the package it said 2x/3x and it fix like a 1x
1.0,"it was beautiful, and rose gold, and  meant to be a gift for my daughter in law, however the clasp does not open, I broke 2 nails trying, very disappointing...returning it..."
1.0,It was just weirdly made and not cute on me.  Returned.  Forget to take a picture.
1.0,Didn’t meet my expectations. I was very displeased. Dress was too small and thin like a table cloth. You can see through the dress. I will be returning this.
1.0,i donot like material
1.0,Cheap material. See through. Will be returning
1.0,"The price was decent, the orifice is not. I ordered a 4X for my son (he wears a 3X) and the shirt couldn't even fit his little brother, it was a small not even close to the correct size. All in all, not worth it."
1.0,I bought these to replace a pair just like them that were stolen from me. When I receive them the quality was very different from the original pair. Very flimsy and very cheaply made. Although I only paid $16 for the second pair and I paid $29 for the first pair I would much rather pay more and get a better product.
1.0,Was not what was shown in picture. It was a rectangle piece of fur. Also smelt and felt awful
1.0,It was to short and the color was wrong.
1.0,"Ordered 1/2”, received 7/16... item is missing 4 pairs of plugs. Overall I am dissatisfied with the order. Was a birthday present for my daughter’s birthday tomorrow and not only are they not the right size but the order is incomplete ..."
1.0,Very cheezy and flimsey sandals with a NO RETURN policy.
1.0,It didn't look anything like the picture. The fit was horrible and it was sewn very cheaply. If it had been free I'd still not want it.
1.0,Dead after less than a year
1.0,"Not good quality, the sewing was not even. Mine had a hole.!!!"
1.0,the shoe came and it was extremely big no indication of the size on the shoes very disappointing .
1.0,😵😩😱😨😠😈😫😭💩
1.0,"This is horrible! I would have returned, but i missed the return window. Sloppy and falls off your arms. Not even comfortable to wear in my own backyard let alone public"
1.0,"Surprisingly, its fits true to size.  The material is so awfully cheap. Its a cute shoe, but the material is not leather , nor a good knockoff of leather. NOT WORTH $30.00!"
1.0,"The photo is totally misleading. I thought I was getting a matching mommy and me set of two aprons, but you only get the child set. One child size apron for $20 is a bit excessive. Was super disappointed."
1.0,Don't waste your money. Very cheap. Comes from China and takes forever to get. Doesn't look like picture. I will be sending this back. Imordered a couple different ones and one immediately fell out of the necklace after friends's daughter wore it 1 hour and another the chain broke same day. I had to repair these things.
1.0,Way too small. Could hardly get them over my thighs and they ripped Ellen trying to take them off. I wouldn't waste your time unless XL really means SM.
1.0,"Not a good experience. After wearing for about 2 weeks, the entire inner mechanism began to rattle and it quit working"
1.0,Carefully review pictures put here by commenters then compare to the earrings being sold.  NOT THE SAME.
1.0,Fell apart first wash
1.0,Product is way too tight on the thighs.
1.0,Vinyl. Crap.
1.0,"The socks are listed as being Warm Winter sock. These are not warm winter sock. They are thin like regular every day socks. I was expecting them to be thick at least around the foot area, but they are not."
1.0,I gave it to goodwill!
1.0,Post is way too long. It’s about 1.5x as long as a normal nose ring post should be; it’s so long it’s unwearable.
1.0,"These were listed as maternity overalls and they are definitely just regular overalls. They are cute, but the denim isn't soft or stretchy at all....maybe after a wash they will be softer but since I need maternity overalls I am returning them."
1.0,Should had read the comments my son was super excited and like everyone said you get a double out of the three pack<br /><br />***UPDATE*** tried to return these for my refund and apparently you need to ship it to Great Britain and the shipping is alone 40 bux .... I'll keep these and give the extra one away..  thanks for nothing.
1.0,"very pretty but way to fragile! First time I tried to use this the spiral snapped right off! Now it's a sharp price of wood at the end,  sad It didn't last the first use"
1.0,"No support,  cross body hooks are pointless and do nothing"
1.0,"This is not women's size. It's youth or child size (not juniors, not even big enough to be a xs in juniors). I'll save it for my daughter for when she is big enough since Amazon has made returns a pain in the buttocks."
1.0,"Broke as soon as I filled it up, and was leaking all over the place"
1.0,The pocket began to fall off the first time I wore it.
1.0,"Cheap, see through, and too small. Took 8 weeks to arrive without any explanation why. Seller unresponsive until after I had contacted amazon."
1.0,Cheap material. Awkward cut. Way too large.
1.0,I love the style of this hat and it would’ve been perfect if it hadn’t arrived crushed and completely misshapen.  I returned the first one and ordered a replacement and it was worst than the first order!!!!  I’ve tried reshaping and it failed.
1.0,The mask is very heavy and hot. It’s has a lot of material that goes too far under the chin and too close to the ears. The ear holes are very small and hug too tight. Thought the band in the back would help but it doesn’t. The mask also has a very chemically smell out of the packaging. Haven’t washed it yet to see if it goes away.
1.0,"Horrible quality, it’s the kind that only looks good for one wear because once you wash it it is covered in fuzz balls and the shape of it is warped..."
1.0,How do they say it on Yelp reviews; ZERO stars if I could. This top came to me bald up in a plastic bag soaked in something that smelled like urine. I kid you not. Please purchase with caution if you do decide to. I will certainly be returning this pissy crop top. Literally and figuratively speaking. Smh...just nasty.
1.0,Broke after the second time i wore it
1.0,"Jewel fell out first time putting on.  Sent seller message, but got no help."
1.0,"Tis item is way too short and I ordered mine a few sizes up. Also have tried to return it, but can't seem to get a really answer fmor the company on how to and think they put you off until the 30 day limit. Super cute in pictures, but would only order as a shirt."
1.0,"Very cheaply made. Very disappointed. the quality is terrible and it has a strong smell to it. Very unhappy, the picture looks better than the real deal. Flimsy straps and the so called &#34;buckle&#34; barely goes through the side piece."
1.0,"Honestly, this dress made me look like a Nun, or a servant from the 1800's. The part that makes it look weird is the white section of the dress, it looks exactly the same in the front as it does in the back. From the side, it just doesn't look right with this pattern. I also felt it accentuated my ""pooch"". I really wish this dress was designed better because it is very pretty in the front."
1.0,"The majority of the charms in this set have a sloppy paint job. The solid color charms are much thinner than the sparkly ones. I ended up only using a few for my project. For a dollar more there’s listings of much higher quality charms that are identical to these. I really only bought this set for the solid color charms. The solid black ones are okay, but the rest are definitely not worth it."
1.0,Very unsatisfied... I ordered three tracksuits didn't get not one of them yet all of them were marked delivered.... Price was so good I told my father to order some how about the same thing happened to him.... Horrible service not happy whatsoever.
1.0,Definitely NOT true to size
1.0,"The sizing on these are WAY off.  I ordered XLarge and that must me a Chinese XLarge.  In American sizes it would be a 6!  So, if you are very very thin they actually were very nice.  Poor return policy,  They gave me choice of paying mailing back to China or giving me half my cost back.  If you are not very skinny and not sure of size do not buy these."
1.0,Don't stay on at all
1.0,The glue was solid and unusable.  Stencils are small.  If we did not have other kits on hand our PTA festival would have been a disaster.
1.0,"Much smaller than depicted in the photo. Also, these earrings feel and look like plastic.  Not worth the money.  Will be returning immediately."
1.0,Awful material!!
1.0,It’s the right size but oh my word did it smell like fish guts. It was awful smelling coming out of the box truly awful. Like knock you down awful. Buyer beware.
1.0,"I'd read reviews of the fit of this product and ordered size up . Even with the size up, fit is still small. Also, the neck line is cut so high it hugs the neck to where it almost feels like a turtle neck to me. I'm a plus size woman, which makes it difficult to find clothing that I truly &#34;love&#34; but most things I at least like... I'm not liking this product at all and although I will not be returning it, I will also not be a repeat buyer either."
1.0,"HORRIBLE! If I could return this tee I would.  I bought this Tee because it reminds me of my mother in law who’s passed and she was a huge Sunflower lover but the only thing good about this shirt is it’s super, super soft and that’s where it ends  because the color is so awful it’s a cream yellowish color not one that’s flattering on anyone let alone a female.  The print is nicely done and it’s cute but that shirt color is so horrid it takes away from the print.  I wear a men’s L t-shirt and XL in a female cut due to a larger chest this tee is a mans cut but the XL was so tight in my chest and sleeves that there’s no way I could wear it so I attempted to give it to my friend and she laughed at me 😫 so I’m stuck with a T-shirt I can’t wear."
1.0,it takes long long time until i receive the package and its TOTALLY DIFFERENT WITH THE PICTURE.<br />its super long and not like the picture perfectly down next to my breast.<br />DONT BUY IT
1.0,I received a brown sweater in a totally different style!
1.0,Almost as big as my hand
1.0,"I ordered the teal matrix bracelet, and I was stunned at how hideously UGLY this bracelet is. NEVER have I seen an uglier piece of jewelry! Half of the stones are silvery looking no color at all and some are the teal color - it looks like a quality control issue! Will never ever wear this!!!!!!!"
1.0,Very small and thin. Hardly any ‘slouch’
1.0,Sent it back because it did not work properly.
1.0,Sergio Sergio  Awful
1.0,These things suck.
1.0,Tiny hat that is just horribly made. Clearly a cheap knockoff product.
1.0,"I love the look of these shoes and I received so many compliments, but after the first wear they started fraying on the sides and after 2 wears they had broken. The strap that attaches to the shoe ripped out. Super inconvenient when you are out walking around. Bummed because I wanted to love them."
1.0,Daughter is spelt wrong lmao
1.0,"Silicone band was stretched out terribly. It looked new, but did not help"
1.0,"While I don't expect the included chain to be amazing, it should at least look like the picture in the product description, and even match the wording in the product description. This is a very basic, petite simple loop chain in rose rose gold color. So basic that it is the same you would see on any cheap necklace.<br /><br />The description does not state the length of the chain (why?), but it is about 16"". It is a choker on me, but if you have a petite neck, or are a child, then it will hang lower. Still, it is a shorter chain than what seems to be displayed in picture. It doesn't resemble what is depicted. I'll likely give this to my mom (she's super petite bone structure) or donate it.<br /><br />If you are buying this strictly for the pendant, then know that the pendant is pretty but very tiny. The purple pink stones in the center could be more robust in color, but overall it is pretty.<br /><br />Much of my rating goes into the fact that the product received is not the exact same as what is pictured. The chain is entirely different. Again, I don't expect amazing quality with the chain, but it shows something much nicer looking than what I have in hand. That is disappointing. Even if I planned to change out the chain, I expected the same chain as shown."
1.0,Two of three anklets broke within an hour of me wearing. Very cheap made
1.0,This belt is marked all wrong. The small was enormous and the extra small was so tiny it was a joke.  I’m a size 2 and I weigh 102 and this belt is mismarked.
1.0,Cheap flimsy fabric .... I saw the same dress design at Macy's then saw it on line. I made the mistake on ordering this cheap knock off. Never again!
1.0,Came with no tags.  No care info. Looks like someone returned it and the seller sent it to me. Horrible feel to it. Drab. See through. Will be returning.
1.0,going to send them back unless I find someone 6&#34; taller than me.  Im a short 30 and these are 36 :(
1.0,"It has waaaayyyyy to much fabric and too many clasps. In order to fit it on my wrist I had to cut it in half, and even then there were so many clasps that I can't comfortably wear it with my watch."
1.0,Decor was not securely attached!  The slightest touch and I had a handful of beads. They were all over the place!  Very disappointed!
1.0,Broke as soon as I put them on.
1.0,"okay , this watch is a total fake I mean there are feature on it that don't do anything on the main face there are three small dial's which don't do anything second on the side where the time adjust are there are two button's they don't do a thing and for what ever on the left there's a smaller time read out guess you could put and cross state time on it I guess I could send it back but my old watch died so I use this for a time peace for now till I get a better one , if you want a watch that totally fake this is the one to buy it does like impressive ...."
1.0,"Although I love this idea and would totally be a game changer for me since I have arthritic hands, the magnets are not strong enough to hold securely. They do come together but with a gentle tug they come undone. That would make me nervous I’d lose it. I’m on the hunt now for one with a stronger magnets."
1.0,I never got the item it's a rip off not happy at all wish I could get my money back
1.0,"Great dress, totally off on the size; thanks for nothing.<br />A large was a 6/8; too tight. Got the large because the last one that I bought I was swimming in, sigh.<br />Color me frustrated with the VERY inconsistent sizes!!!"
1.0,I really should have returned the two I bought but couldn't be bothered.  They are so stiff.  I don't believe they are real leather like they are advertised.  I used one for a few months hoping it would loosen up but to no avail.  I never got it to close and stay closed even when it was empty.
1.0,"Ordered it and when it was expected to be delivered, the seller emailed me that it was unfortunately undeliverable. Immediately, the price was doubled. Happy with Columbia bugaboot: better quality, better reviews and is deliverable."
1.0,These were size large but the arm holes were too big and didn’t really hang right.  It was really thin low quality material and my husband was very disappointed.
1.0,Broke apart in pieces after a few days.  Was able to put back together.
1.0,This fabric is not at all what it claims to be...it's a very heavy thick cotton and the seller has made it impossible to return for a refund.
1.0,"There is a leather patch on the front which looks like the battery should be able to be inserted and it shows where the power button should be located for easy access when wearing.  In one hat there's a slot to put it in the hat but no receptacle so it just floats around all through the hat.  In the other hat there is NO slot for the battery; just a very small one for the wire to feed through to the outside.  You can try just rolling the hat up once but then it's just loose and easily falls out as there is nothing to contain it.  Love the material the hats are made of but it really takes away from being able to use the light feature, which was the distinguishing feature that got me to buy this.  Not very happy with these AT ALL."
1.0,First of all these are not a large sized glove. They are extremely small and do not cover my entire hand. There are also holes in every glove. Not just a few here or there but every glove has several holes. I use them at night to keep my hands moisturized with lotion. I have been doing this for years and these are the only gloves that seem to soak up all the lotion so it is no longer beneficial to my hands. They are totally dried out by morning. If you use gloves like this for the same purpose don’t buy these!
1.0,This will NEVER NEVER NEVER an adult. I read very careful the size chart. I bough it as a gift for a male size 12. This doesn’t even fit my ARM!!!!!! Not even my feet and I’m a female size 7.
1.0,"no use carry it one time and i loose the straps, they burst ."
1.0,The first order was slightly large in size large.  I returned it for a medium and it was mismarked and huge!  My grandson was disappointed two times.  👎
1.0,Very wiggley.  Wish I could return
1.0,Actually the blue Frogglez is to tight for my grand son. I purchased a green one for my house and a blue one for his house.  Now he had to take the green one back and forth since the blue one didn't fit. It was much tighter than the green one and hurt his face around his eyes.
1.0,First it took over a month to get to me and when I received it it was faded. almost to the point of not being able to make out what it was supposed to be. Very unhappy with this company second time poorly made product.
1.0,Not impressed. It was an impulse buy.  Never wore.
1.0,The color changes with on wear
1.0,Nice style just too small
1.0,2nd day wearing it stone fell off ring.. Poor quality bad and poorly made.
1.0,It looks nothing like the picture. They’re too big and clunky and not even brown they’re like a pale brown kinda orange tinted.
1.0,Poor quality for a gift
1.0,"I can't even wear it. The top is screwed on so tight, it won't budge. What a let down."
1.0,"I should have read the other reviews before buying this product. I am 5'7&#34; and it is not long enough on me to use as a cover up, my butt hangs out the back. I also agree with the other reviews about the placement of the empire waist. It needs to be slightly lower so that it doesn't pop over your boobs every time you lift your arm. Returning this item."
1.0,Product photos for the Apple Watch 44mm band show a 2 piece band. I received a 1 piece band missing the tucking clasp. Disappointing purchase.
1.0,too sml
1.0,Shirt and pants ripped as soon as my daughter put them on and it wasn't even right. She wore it anyways for halloween but was not happy
1.0,Female side doesn't work with a standard backpack - look carefully at what you are replacing. The female side does NOT bite and hold. No idea what this can be good for.
1.0,I do not suggest it
1.0,"Super cute design, but sizing was at least 4 sizes smaller than indicated.  If you are about a size 2-6, you may be able to fit an XL.  Otherwise, forget it."
1.0,This is on its way back. It fits like a belly shirt and is about 2 sizes too small.
1.0,"Poorly designed, although the fabric is good."
1.0,Do not buy this dress the color transfers everywhere when you shower all you’ll see is dye I had to soap two times and do a body scrub
1.0,👎👎
1.0,The case lasted only three months. The case itself easily peels off leaving and the logo (Sticker) came off very easy. Not worth it. Shop another product.
1.0,I bought a large based on the reviews from other customers. I'm normally a small and this dress barely covers my vagina!! JUNK!
1.0,"HORRIBLE!! Let me tell you a cute story. One day a girl wants to buy a sweet harry potter necklace. After days of searching, she finds this. She buys it, waits nearly a month for it to come, AND ITS AN UGLY RED BRACELET THATS NOT EVEN MEANT TO BE A SNITCH!!!! Don't buy this!!!!"
1.0,These are NOT true to size...1 pair in a small may fit properly and another in a small will be extremely TINY....SO disappointed....I've ordered up in a size and they're still way to small ...I WILL NOT be ordering from this company anymore since they have a NO RETURN policy
1.0,They are very small and tight. They are supposed to be non-slip but slipped right off my head. They no longer make my favorite headbands so gave these a try - they are going back.
1.0,I am so dissappinted that this doesn't fit. I should of read the comments before purchasing. It runs so large! I want a refund 😏 such waste of money.
1.0,Just received the item.. Item was damaged. Left lens was removed from the frame. Frame is deformed. Just wasted 12 bucks for this.
1.0,I felt it was super unflattering and the material was cheap. The off center hem really drove me crazy as well. I've returned it.
1.0,I normally wear and xl.  I bought the 3x which was way too small.  I believe the sizing is for kids
1.0,"This dress was cute but is not for curvy girls, I returned"
1.0,"The sizes don't read correctly.  Even using the chart converter as a guide,  the dress is much too small.  Beautiful. But too small."
1.0,I ordered the largest size and it won't fit my 10 year old nephew. The sizing chart is terrible
1.0,"After two years of regular use, my favorite leopard belt was worn out. I  read the reviews on this belt and purchased it;  it looked great when it arrived. However after just one wearing, the hair and print have worn off where my belt loop was. So disappointing."
1.0,"neck area is way too big, very thin, cheap material.  Most distracting thing is the fact that the stripes do not match on the side seams and it looks really noticeable and make it look even more cheaper.... returned it."
1.0,Neck strap to long and dress hangs to low
1.0,Very Cheap.
1.0,This ring gave me second degree chemical burns within 24 hours of putting it on for the first time. Don't waste your money or risk injury.
1.0,She wore a few times . The lining in the sleeves is tearing.
1.0,I loved the top . However it was poorly made. I worn this top for the first time for Cinco de Mayo . I went to the ladies room and notice the gold ball had some how fallen off. I was so embarrassed I left the restaurant
1.0,This shirt is ridiculously out of proportion.  The chest measurement was OK but the arm holes extend clear down to the bottom of my rib cage and the neck line extends down to my sternum.  The &#34;shoulder straps&#34; need to be shortened by a good 3 or 4 inches to bring the arm holes and neckline up to were they belong.  Unfortunately all of the Fullbeauty companies including Women Within have major problems with quality control including inconsistent sizing and poor workmanship because their clothing is made in other countries.  Unfortunately since the majority of plus sized clothing options are all Fullbeauty  companies they have no incentive to do better.
1.0,I did not like these at all! My daughter had them on for about an hour & they started falling apart. First it was the moon & star jewel in the side then the bow. Needless to say I wouldn’t buy these ever again.
1.0,I bought this one week ago and it is now broken this is bad quality do not buy this!!!
1.0,Doesn’t inflate
1.0,This runs at least 3 sizes small
1.0,loved the thickness of the cotton and the no ride up fit around the toosh.  Sadly the band around the leg was too tight. My daughter loved the print:( she is a slender 11yr old.
1.0,They provided a size chart but the jackets are not made to their size.
1.0,"Really cheap material, super itchy and just made poorly."
1.0,Not the same as the picture. The color is much different... I’m<br />Not happy with the purchase. It feels cheap
1.0,"The glasses are horrible, it has nothing to do with the ones I ordered. I find misleading advertising"
1.0,stay away ! don’t waste money /time
1.0,We got this for my son. The crystal fell out after one week. Poor quality.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:926499026a9a3314d8059fc6e62c63c]] This boot lace sucks not as strong as a leather 1
1.0,The tag price is $28.00 only. But I paid $35 plus tax.  The fabric is see through. Not good for the price.
1.0,Infected my belly button ring.... DO NOT BUY
1.0,Blue color not good
1.0,Way way too small even using the size chart
1.0,"These were not fluffy at all nor soft. Very very cheap looking and feeling. Maybe good for play but I would not use them in a recital or for any occasion. If you need some cheap looking giveaways, then this is for you."
1.0,Do not waste your money. I ordered an XL & it looked like a small child could fit into it.
1.0,Disgusting.
1.0,"Nice gloves but I bought them to use with my cell phone. I tried several different methods and could not get any of them to get work requiring me to remove the gloves to use my phone. Otherwise nice gloves, fit nice but not particularly warm"
1.0,Very poorly made. They won't clip back when put on😔 Had someone else try to clamp them and it wouldn't work.
1.0,"DO not buy this dress!!  The sleeves are too small and the dress is way too wide without stretch. I purchased the same dress pictured from another seller and the material is stretchy, and is very flowy and way way way smaller. The difference in price was $10 more from a different seller bur it is so much nicer. I requested a return and all they would agree to was 10-15%.  I regret my purchase this the worst experience I’ve ever had!"
1.0,"Cheaply, too"
1.0,do not like it
1.0,UNSAT...I wear size XL but ordered a XXL....it appears to be about a Mmin size....cannot use it as it is simply too small....will have to return it.
1.0,"The fit runs VERY small and pretty sure the pants had been USED. I'm 5'9"" so I ordered a size large, realizing they could be a bit smaller/shorter than ideal. They resemble a size small. Also, I suspect the pair had been worn already and possibly washed, etc. They smelled quite strongly of detergent/ perfume, and there were no affixed tags of any kind. Pretty disappointing in that regard. However, they are soft and true to color/pattern so there's that."
1.0,Zipper broke in less than a weak
1.0,"Ordered a M . fit like XS. material is way cheap, like a plastic dress. returned right away"
1.0,"DO NOT BUY!! DOES NOT WORK!! We received it, didn't work...we even changed the batteries and still nothing! THIS IS A SHAM of a PRODUCT!! DO NOT BUY!!!<br />Update: company/Amazon refunded my money."
1.0,"Graphic looks cheap, could have been much better"
1.0,"The issue is not that it fit too small. It is that it was put together....backwards?  The sleeves are inverted with the thumb holes being on the outside rather than on the inside. The text and pouch for your hands side of the fabric is tight like if you were putting it on backwards, with even the stitching for around your neck showing the article was made backwards. The hood itself is...less of a hood and more of a cone of fabric?  The name says it all. It's irregular. If this is how its supposed to be, alright. I guess I just expected something else."
1.0,not good quality too shiny and look very cheap
1.0,The pattern didn't match up on the pocket.  Might not be a deal breaker for some but for me it wasnt ok and I returned it.
1.0,Received and it was great looking on being worn .  Had difficulty closing lasp.  Within 3hrs. bracelet had fallen off somewhere?  Like throwing money down the toilet.
1.0,"These are painted, which started peeling off immediately."
1.0,Not a sweatshirt!! Not cotton. Way undersized!!
1.0,"bought these several years ago and really liked them. Last time I ordered these I really got trumped, they contained less coolant material they felt slimy to the touch was shocked at the difference. Ordered two 10 or 12 packs the first year. Ordered one last time. Will never order again, very shoddy and did not help against the head and gross to the touch."
1.0,I’m super disappointed at the quality of these earrings.There like super thin wire and they bend very very easily.I wanted to return them but after Amazon chargesMe a dollar to print out the return label it’s not worth it so I guess I’ll just keep them I wouldn’t purchase again tho
1.0,"I was expecting two pair of earrings to arrive. However, only one pair did.  Therefore, I did not receive a complete order."
1.0,"They are prettier in the picture but still pretty, but when they got here the stem was severely bent on one and broken in half on the other.  *cries*  I live on a military base over seas and cannot easily send it back for a replacement so I'm just out of money and can't even wear them."
1.0,Got these hoping they were the pink metal not just paint incorrect it's just paint
1.0,"Nothing like the image shown. Product did not even include shoe laces. Product image clearly shows leather strap that goes around it 3 times, but the product arrived only to have leather strap capable of wrapping around it twice. Took more than 2 weeks longer to arrive than expected. Arrived in a taped up bag, no protection whatsoever. Boots are folded and creased. Closer to a costume accessory than actual shoes. They're going to fall apart after a single wear. Stiching incomplete in several places. Would give this 0 stars if I could."
1.0,Magnet not strong enough to work
1.0,Nice comfy band but these definitely fit only very thin frame glasses.  :-(  My son's glasses are not abnormally wide at the widest point (1/4&#34; max at sides) and the straps would not slide on.  I thought I was going to break the glasses trying to put them on.  The seams even busted because it was so tight.  The rubbery end by the ear is nearly impossible to slide through.
1.0,The gem broke off as I was getting ready. So now I cannot return as I cut off the tag and I don’t have one to wear. Poor quality.
1.0,I bought these as a christmas gift for my boyfriend and was super bummed when he held them up they are completely see through! and they were also too small
1.0,Too short thought would be pass waist
1.0,Es muy grande ancho asta de pierna para lo q vale la tela no es lo esperava  esta miy caro y las tallas salen grande
1.0,This dress came and it was a cheap screen print and even more cheaply made.  Waste of money and very disappointing.
1.0,"I ordered this item several weeks early to wear to a Christmas party. Item arrived fine... However, when I tried to fasten it the clasp came apart from the face of the brooch. Thank God it was cheap! Only purchase if you don't mind throwing away your money."
1.0,Did not fit sizes are way off
1.0,Elastic broke on the first day!! My child has incredibly thin feet and there's no reason these should have ripped
1.0,In the picture it looks like the stones are inlaid in reality it looks like cheap plastic stones are glued on top of the silver. Very cheap and ugly looking. Have really not been disappointed with most things purchase from Amazon but this was the worst I've received
1.0,Size was no where near the description. Had to refund the customer. Lost a big sale.
1.0,"Item sent was USED - dirty, discolored, clearly worn. Disgusting that this was trying to be passed off as new…"
1.0,Fit horrible... Seam across bust
1.0,A lot smaller than I thought and did not come on time for the event I had planned to ware it
1.0,"These sunglasses are adorable. They fit great and look even better on. They are exactly what I was looking for. The rhinestones really sparkle. Unfortunately mine arrived missing 2 of those pretty rhinestones. Checked the picture here and it definitely doesn’t have any missing spots on the picture. Extremely upset because returning things is so difficult, especially with my schedule. Wanted to give these 1 million stars if they had arrived intact."
1.0,It broke putting it on.
1.0,The size is wrong. Don't buy It.
1.0,The size that I got came out to big and still did not get a credit for this dress I retuned it  a while back. Just noticed my act. Been busy with whole wedding planning and did not noticed the returned credit.
1.0,Popped shortly after purchase.
1.0,Crappy construction
1.0,Cheap seams on side if shirt doesn't line up
1.0,its cute but to small
1.0,Nice sweater but label was sewn on the outside of the sweater.
1.0,"Great price but too good to be true.  I am used to the quality of Columbia.  I was looking for the wicking to keep you cool but mostly I was looking for sun protection - which this was supposed to have. Thankfully I never took this out for a day on the water.  I did try it in my garden and yard.  Unfortunately, it had no sun protection.  I came in and could see the lines from my undergarments.<br /><br />Going back to my tried and true Columbia."
1.0,The collar is abnormally large!!
1.0,Cheap leather pealed off after first use. Got us through prom night but that's it
1.0,"Heavy, poor quality,  and not well made."
1.0,They were so tiny I could hardly see them!<br />I will give them to someone who likes tiny earrings<br /><br />Somehow<br />I thought they would be larger<br />They are very pretty if you like tiny tiny tiny earrings!
1.0,I always liked air max but these were squashing my toes. Giving it to the salvation army. What A waste
1.0,"The hat is a small, but didn’t even fit my 10 year old son. We ended up giving it away to family frI ends with a 2 year old & it barely fit him as well. Very disappointing, but luckily my son was able to roll with the punches."
1.0,"the sizing is very inaccurate .i am a medium ,thats was way to small,tried a large and there seems to be very little difference .its like they are boys sizes .big waste of time. returning both .i give up"
1.0,"Because I'm 5'3&#34;, and wear a B- cup, I was instructed to order a size down and get an A-cup bra. This was terrible advice, and I will be returning this."
1.0,Not a generous fit
1.0,"I had to send it back. The cups have some sort of pad in them, there seem to bee two thin pieces of foam inside each cup. The first time I put it on the rolled separately. I was able to fuss with it to get them flat, but it's worse each time. Since they feel like thin, cheap foam they curl back up. It's not wearable."
1.0,The dress Looks like a sack on. The Color was more pink than mauve. Poor craftsmanship. It was ripped in the lacing where it meets the waist. Am overall waste of time.
1.0,Very thin. Horrible quality. Had to throw them away.
1.0,This really doesn't look like the image in person.
1.0,"Seriously dissapointed. I have 3 other dresses from them in different prints- all great quality-in fact they are a few years old and are holding up great! So, I bought a new one to add... well, its thin i noticed the first time wearing it, but ok, no biggie.<br />Well, then I washed it. It came out of my dryer with 4. FOUR seams ripped with over 1 inch large holes. I'm so dissapointed. I cant find a way to contact the seller, but this is a huge let down. I wear these 4 days a week for work, and would love to have bought more, but now, Idk."
1.0,"This coat says it's a women's coat but it has child sizes... an xxl might fit a little girl.  And to top it all off, I can't even return it for a refund.  I will donate it to a local elementary school for a child who could use a brand new coat.  Will never purchase from this seller again."
1.0,I can’t add a picture because I have already returned the blouse. It is a beautiful blouse but I don’t think it will withstand everyday use.
1.0,A true small always fits me. These were HUGE! Not the best quality. You can see through them & it didn’t come with the tie around the waist. Looks nothing like the photo
1.0,Horrible fit.
1.0,Way to small for the size I ordered big waste of money
1.0,It is no longer in my possession.  I took it back and they didn't even want it
1.0,The stones starting falling off three hours after my son put it on. We tried glueing them but it ruined the glove. Piece of cheap junk that was way too expensive!
1.0,"Wow these look so much better online than in person. In fact the posts are bent, the opal looks like stickers. Don't waste your money. I am so disappointed."
1.0,did not fit my oakley as described. size is too big
1.0,Mom wanted these to protect her toes but even though she has smaller narrow feet these were extremely tight. Do not buy!
1.0,Not impressed with this dress. I ordered a medium and it fit like an xL. Material was very thin and see-through. Dress had no shape and was cheaply made. Would not recommend.
1.0,Love the dress however upon washing it for the first time to wear it on New Year’s the color bled.
1.0,Way way too big!
1.0,"Cotton material with some stretch. Not see threw, which was what I was trying to find. Wear them for running and pilates and have not had a problem. I ordered the black with pink on the waist, and they look like the picture shown.<br />UPDATE---- no longer loving these workout pants, wear them maybe once a week and the have a hole in the thigh area after just a few months. Not happy."
1.0,Would not lie flat to chest
1.0,"These bras are absolutely horrible! Every one of them I was able to wear 1 day. By the end of the day the wire was poking out of both ends! Also each one was a different size! They all had the same size on the tag, but one was smaller and one was so big I couldn’t even wear it."
1.0,Doesnt look exactly how it appears. My daughter thought it was a clown suit
1.0,This came with two holes in it. Disappointed because it's super cute.
1.0,"It is made of very bad quality material, I wouldn't buy it again and it was a little smaller than what it should have been so honestly I woudn't wear it because it looks very cheap but also, it doesn't even fit me. so yeah.. that's that."
1.0,"What I received is a far cry from what I ordered.<br /><br />Pictured is a red/rose colored lenses -- which is what I wanted and ordered. What I received are outlandishly garish mirrored smoke lenses. They are in the correct frame, however, which suggests to me that this is simple a case of completely misleading product descriptions.<br /><br />I regret wasting money on this garbage, and given that it was sent from China, I'd imagine that a return would be a nightmare."
1.0,I purchased this bag for my middle school daughter since they are not allowed to use a regular back back in school.  This seemed like it would be a durable solution since they are only allowed drawstring bags while in school.  I purchased the bag on 9 OCT 2017 and on 5 DEC 2017 one of the strap hooks on the bag broke.  The bag cannot be used without this hook to hold the strap to the back of the bag.  I am highly disappointed.
1.0,Small earrings. Very feminine  looking. Not for a guy
1.0,Collar is huge and the poor design causes the shoulder areas to bunch up like shoulder pads when worn. Looks ridiculous. Very unhappy
1.0,"Too big@approx 3"". Heavy. Worst of all..Non Returnable."
1.0,This is not an actual winter snow boot. Not water proof and is more of a fabric. Nice and cute for casual wear but NOT for OUTSIDE in the snow.
1.0,This was my third of these. The first two pair I loved. This third pair came almost to middle of my calf. Can’t wear them at all.
1.0,I returned this item.  It was a very wide fit - but short.
1.0,Very horrible quality. Unwearable. Not delicate. Basically little pieces of cheaply put together metal. Back of the earring is very ugly. Not even worth $2.
1.0,"I didn't like headbands, they were made from a fabric like that cut up and sewed together and not made good...it didn't stay in place rolled up .. Just did not like it wouldn't recommend it to no one"
1.0,"After only wearing for a week, some of the dots fell off."
1.0,"The shoes were cute.  That's the only good thing about them.  They were too small, so I gave them to my daughter.  After 1 day, the soles peeled off the bottom, and the part that cups the heel ripped from the strap.  They also took over a month to arrive, which I would never have ordered if the product would have specified such a long order period.  Do NOT waste your money or time!"
1.0,"Waist too small, legs baggy. Weird feeling fabric, like spandex but more tough and plastic like. No thanks. Not breathable at all."
1.0,Unexpected them to come a lot larger but i that was really small and horrible for that price
1.0,Broke after wearing once.  Contacted seller without a response.
1.0,These bands I will not buy again. They are very cheaply made and Crack after a few wears. No thanks save your money.
1.0,Huge tear after 2nd wear.
1.0,"The dress is beautiful; however, the material was stiff, and the material around the neck was too tight.<br /><br />To achieve a better fit, I recommend sizing up."
1.0,I won't buy again. These are pretty cheap looking and feeling. Waste of money for an adult. Fits my kids head ok and he is 8. I gave them to him but not meant for guys.
1.0,This necklace tarnished after one wear.
1.0,Tag was marked as different brand than Aero. Not true to size at all.
1.0,Some were broken before use
1.0,"Very poor quality fabric. The sleeves run very small in comparison to the rest of the dress. I’m only 5’2”, so this was very odd. The dress fit nicely through the waist and hips, but was tight on my bust. I think the dress was just poorly designed/cut."
1.0,Wore them 2 times and it came apart.  I dont know if it was just that pair of all of them like this.
1.0,"Added expedited shipping and the order was cancelled three weeks later, the day the item was expected for Halloween. Unreliable, do not recommend. Broke my son’s heart."
1.0,"Not made from a quality material, small. Came out of the package dirty. Not impressed at all"
1.0,Not the size I thought I wa getting
1.0,"Returned. Cheap material, nice colors though"
1.0,The watch press didn't fit the watches as advertised. I could not find a way to make it fit the watches that I needed to.
1.0,"Do not buy from this seller.  Here's why:<br /><br />1) The item is not as described.  It is not cotton and has no cotton in it.<br />2) It is an extremely low quality shirt.  For the price I paid, I assumed it wouldn't be great quality but this is really bad.<br />3) The logo is clearly used illegally.  It is so pixilated and grainy that they obviously copied it off a website and then printed it on the shirts. The picture below is not a poor quality picture.  That is what the logo looks like.  If you see it in person it's even worse.<br />4) The tag on the neck of the shirt in the description shows a &#34;Triumph&#34; tag implying it is a &#34;real&#34; Triumph product.  It is not.  In fact, there are no tags whatsoever on this shirt identifying where it was made and what it is made out of nor does it say the size.<br />5) They are located in China and it takes a long time for the item to arrive.<br /><br />Here are the positives: seller contacted me in a timely manner when I had a question; the item arrived on time."
1.0,Cheap product but hefty price. No style no fit. Look ugly. Save your time and look elsewhere. Not a decent seller.
1.0,"That is a quality, the chain popped the first day I got it"
1.0,This is cheaply made
1.0,"They're a great fit and look good, but they begin to peel and fray on the inside immediately and it's so annoying. I won't buy this brand."
1.0,Way too big !!
1.0,Too heavy and small
1.0,"I've had 2 pairs of these glasses and they do indeed help to deflect the brightness of headlights.  Unfortunately, both pair of these glasses broke at the nose pad.  So I would not suggest purchasing these glasses."
1.0,I purchased these glasses as a spare item to have on hand.  I ordered the same lens strength as my prescription.  The lens are are very blurry
1.0,"Lights didn't even work on the hat, took the batteries out and they were corroded,  it was too late to return or replace cause I needed it for a Christmas party. Not worth the money. And this was supposed to be a brand new hat."
1.0,"Cute , but to small for granddaughter and  not true to size."
1.0,"Too small for my average sized head, and it won't stay in place. I got some with ear loops and they work great."
1.0,"The straps were not well attached, ripped within minutes of wearing it.  Not worth $14."
1.0,"Super cheap, but you get what you pay for"
1.0,These broke when I wore them the first time. Stone fell out.
1.0,Band is trash
1.0,"I bought this specifically to use while running, because a face covering is required outdoors in my state during COVID. These means one's  gaiter or mask needs to a) allow air in and out (be 'breathable'), b) not allow the material to get sucked into your mouth when inhaling.<br />This gaiter advertises itself as being good for sports including running. But it failed both a and b."
1.0,Has a huge “100% COTTON MADE IN CHINA” printed right below JAMAICA in a large white font. Won’t be keeping them.
1.0,Do not buy.
1.0,Never got the chains and backs of the charms are a hard plastic and not easy to insert.  My charms are sitting in a bag not getting used because I don’t wasn’t to ruin my crocs.  I mainly ordered these for the chains. Super disappointing.
1.0,They are not “yoga” pants. They are a cheap polyester blend.
1.0,Only 1 of them has a knife the rest are just plain clips
1.0,This dress is nothing like the picture as far as length! The front is very short and the back falls mid leg.  Not long and flowing at all.  Super thin and the chest area is very narrow. So disappointed!  sending back ASAP.
1.0,Lasted two trips.
1.0,"The clasp is very hard to use. The necklace seemed secure, then fell off unexpectedly. Fortunately I was in the house when it happened. Also, I put it on with the right side facing out, And it flipped over, and needed to be removed to correct it, but then it happened repeatedly."
1.0,"Don't know why Amazon deleted my original review. It seems if you make a negative comment referencing Chinese products they erase the review. That being said, I will reiterate, the shoes are cheap Chinese crap. The quality is thin pleather and the soles are cheap plastic, not sturdy rubber. When the package arrived, the shoes were shrink wrapped together and NOT delivered in a shoe box. like you would see in a dollar store, I would give these zero stars if Amazon would let me."
1.0,It’s too big for me. Otherwise it’s okay material.
1.0,Is this a joke?!<br />My son ordered this for work and it’s upside down!<br />I NEED A FULL REFUND ASAP
1.0,The black cap is described as &#34;blue&#34; and the blue cap is described as &#34; black&#34;.  Well i wanted black and ordered black but ended up getting a blue cap. The color on the shipping bag says &#34;black&#34;.  Beware this.  Too difficult to send back so i am just stuck with a color i dont want.
1.0,Not worth it. They start to fade after one day of wearing them. They now are now a greyish color.
1.0,This product was a complete failure.  The bra began to peel away from skin almost immediately.  Do not recommend.
1.0,The embroidery is awful. The stitching had pulls everywhere. There were several places where the stitches didn’t catch to the fabric and were just dangling in the air. Several frayed parts. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,Just not a good product. 😕
1.0,"These masks are much smaller than shown online.<br />Ordered 2 adult size packs and they are so very small they look like a child's mask.<br />Washed and line dryed to sanitize,  so no dryer shrinkage.<br />They are just extremely small.<br />My family and I are on the slender side and they do not give enough surface coverage.<br />In fairness they appear well made but they are too small."
1.0,"This bag is made of cheap quality. Zipper broke in the second day of use. Very disappointed with the lunch bag, not deep enough. Definitely not for school use or anything. I would of returned it but I wrote my child’s name on it for school. Don’t waste your money. Hello kitty is too expensive to get low quality items."
1.0,The fabric was scratchy!
1.0,"This skirt was absolute garbage.  Super thin, cheap material, and construction quality was awful.  The waist does NOT fold over properly like a fold over waist should.  Material was nearly sheer and just felt really cheaply made from the second I pulled it out of the package.  It seems the producers of this garment spent more money on the bag it was packaged in (a nice ziploc) and the tag (safety pinned on), than they did on the materials to make it in the first place. I would NOT recommend this product."
1.0,The fringe unraveled so badly after it got a little wet while splashing in the shallow end w my grandchildren. Very embarrassing while at a high end resort. It left black chunks of thread everywhere I went. Threw it away when I got home. Maybe it only happens with the black ones
1.0,"I am really so so disappointed, I like the fit and the material so so much, it fits so perfect as if it is tailor made, i am 5'2"" tall and about 135 pounds and size small looks perfect on me, but unfortunately i have to return it back as the colors is totally different from the photos, it is not even close, and i can't get why there is navy in the pattern while the top of the dress is black, no matching at all, it looks like i am wearing a dress made from cloth leftovers!!! So upset<br />Updated to 1 star instead of 3.. now i ordered another two assuming the very first one was just a mistake, now i got totally totally different shapes and colors, i ordered the orange floral which is supposed to have the upper part just plain black, and the bottom part black×orange, but i got navy×red instead, and no plain upper part (attached the photo of what i got)<br />And the second one had 2 parts but with TOTALLY different colors not even close to the picture they have."
1.0,I have two reasons for returning this sweatshirt.  1.  This sweatshirt was a size large and it looked like a small.  2.  I was charged tax on a clothing item. There is no tax on clothing.
1.0,Cheap polyester. Wrinkles easy but hard to iron. Would not recommend
1.0,Very cute but not water proof. Maybe for a light shower. But if it was pouring down raining you would get soaked. It's very thin and not made for heavy rain.
1.0,This is not a well made dress. I followed the sizing chart and ordered an 8 instead of my normal size 6. It was still 2 sizes too small. The lace covering was cheap and after zipping up the dress it was uneven in the back
1.0,Purchased these on Feb 22 - it's now March 29 and they are falling apart.  My daughter tried to hot glue the sole back on a few days ago so my son would have a shoe to wear to school.  The return window is only 30 days so now I'm stuck with broken shoes.  DO NOT BUY!
1.0,The first thing I noticed when upon opening was the prominent dark stain on the point of the white collar. Unacceptable! The chest portion bulged out at  just above the waist. And hem line falls at about mid shin. Due to the stain and chest bulge I feel that this Drew’s has been and worn then shipped to me. I am completely dissatisfied and would not recommend buying from this company at all!
1.0,"I don’t know what this is made of, but it smelled absolutely horrible! Smelled toxic"
1.0,Very poorly put together. Facings rolled out and showed around armhole. Large stich length were used so the stitching showed on all seams. I normally wear a size 10 but purchased a 14 according to the size chart on the website but still to small.
1.0,"This particular Night Vision glasses doesn't provide good Night vision. I had previously bought a Night Vision and that was very good. I bought this one for my other car, assuming it would be similar, but I was wrong. For me, this is a total waste of money."
1.0,Ridiculously SMALL! It fits my 3-year-old!! I thought it was a joke when I opened the package! They don’t even stretch. So upsetting!!!!! The price is insane for what I received. Very poor quality.
1.0,The top fit like a small would but the bottoms were extremely baggy
1.0,The color did not match. The size in the description said M and it came XXL
1.0,I didn't like the material.  It was an easy return
1.0,The metal bent around the clip/latch when I tried to fasten it. It cannot be fastened now. Very easily broken.
1.0,"Buyer beware! These dresses look NOTHING like their pictures they post! In fact they are not the same product AT ALL. They take actual dresses made by someone else, use the pictures from that company and attempt to make a copy of the dress. Unsuccessfully I might add. This was the biggest pile of cheap crap I've ever seen. The fit was no where even close to the chart. The fabric was hideous and so so cheap. It looked like someone threw this together on five minutes flat. The workmanship is non existent. And then they give you major hell when you try to return it. I've been trying to return this to them for weeks and they refuse to accept my refund request. Just keep asking me why I want to return it over and over. I finally had to escalate the issue to Amazon. Save yourself the headache and don't even bother."
1.0,It doesn't look like the one on the picture.
1.0,The right hand glove stitching ripped open at the thumb.
1.0,"I ordered a larger size than I would need and it still ended up being too small, I could barely lift it past my thighs.  After trying to lift it higher the whole thing split in two.  Even with an XL these are way too small."
1.0,"Sweatshirt itself is cheaper quality. Printed picture is waxy feeling and grainy. Product is fine as long as you don’t look too closely, or want to retain any warmth."
1.0,The product was made very poorly. It broke at the class upon attempting to secure it.
1.0,Terrible quality.
1.0,Very unhappy with product. Sizing chart was way off as well as description.
1.0,Post are not titanium.  Made my ears itch. Very cheaply made.
1.0,Terrible dress. Don’t buy. They don’t give all your money back. You have to pay shipping. Not as pictured.
1.0,made me look square.
1.0,"I order weekly from Amazon, and this is my very 1st review… This so called “high quality material” is a thin and flimsy plastic that reminds me of a Halloween mask you’d find at the dollar store. There was absolutely zero padding or protection in the box it was delivered in, and the entire center of the mask was shattered to tiny pieces upon opening! It was supposed to be a Christmas present for my 5yr old son. Super disappointing."
1.0,"terrible quality, filmsy."
1.0,Cute but zipper is kinda cheap. It broke after only 1 wear
1.0,"oddly, the same hat in army green fit great. the black version...too tight"
1.0,Can honestly say this is one of the worst garments I’ve ever ordered. It was nothing like the picture showed in the material was horrible. It looks like it’s layered at the bottom but it isn’t it’s all one piece. Would never wear this dress
1.0,"Thin, cheap see-through material.  Definitely not the quality show in the photo."
1.0,Sock ripped while i was putting it on
1.0,"I ordered the shirt for my girlfriends daughters birthday. When it arrived they sent the wrong size, it was a kids small. When I contacted the seller, they told me I would have to pay a 35% restocking fee? I sent back an email stating that it was their mistake. They responded with a nasty email basically telling me too bad. Can you imagine going to a restaurant and ordering a Steak... and then they bring you a Lobster, and when you let your server know about the mistake they tell you they will bring you a steak, but you will have to pay for 35% of the Lobster.... and then tell you it was your fault. Would you ever go back to that restaurant? I couldn't believe the way these people treated me..How can I company that cares so little about it customer's stay in business. Stay away...total ripoff!!!"
1.0,"I needed a 1&#34; wide belt, not 1-1/4&#34; wide as this turned out to be."
1.0,These were reliable from the get go !<br />My fingers turned color 2 hrs after wearing them .... color on one started pedaling off like a layer .. but that's what you get for the price I guess.
1.0,"I thought a few of these were a little bigger than they actually were.  Just be aware that there are no returns,  you’re stuck! . I didn’t even try them to see whether they were too tight, too loose, would hurt, would fall off  or fit snug.  I threw them away as soon as I saw that they weren’t what I expected."
1.0,"Colors was nice.  I ordered an10, because usually it fits small.  They sent an extra large if i knew it was small/medium/large/xl I would have ordered a medium or large.  This dress swallows me.  This was a prime order and it took 10 days to receive it.  Will be returning it."
1.0,"After only One Wash, I could No longer Fit them, and I wear a size 10."
1.0,"Stem broke after the second time adjustment. Daylight savings time broke my watch. Otherwise, I liked it. Only had it about 3 weeks. Quick refund."
1.0,"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY GETTING THIS MODEL. This watch is nothing like advertised, the alarm is so faint I could only hear it at night in bed, and the watch band does not fit a grown-up. COMPLETE WASTE OF $10."
1.0,Just received today...sadly the shoes are VERY narrow (ouch!) and super small.  Returning.
1.0,These socks are too expensive...
1.0,i bought these as a gift for my bestie because she loves bright colors and tie dye and i thought these would be perfect for her but when they came they just look super faded and dull and i am super disappointed. it looks like my camera just can’t pick up the color but that’s just how they look :( don’t buy
1.0,They fit small and not for tall people or people have long torso.
1.0,It was brown. It was supposed the be black. Quality not good.
1.0,It started falling apart after first use. Very poor quality.
1.0,I made the mistake of only looking and total review score and not the reviews themselves. These are really bad quality. The construction reminds me of a grade school craft project.
1.0,I received the gift of my nephew in great time to find the socks were missing! The numbers on the shirt & shorts looked like a 2 year old glued them on! It was junk!
1.0,HATE this dress!!! It’s way too short (literally can see my butt without even bending over) and the material is GARBAGE. Such a bummer because the design is really cute in theory. I got a size up and it was still skin tight and waaaaay too short
1.0,"Ig its a good hat but, I opened the package and pluged it into charge then came back the morning after and it wouldnt light up or connect to my phone, I opened it up to find the wires connecting the sides had either been cut or snapped off. Just get me a refund"
1.0,"My last casio didn't have this problem, but this one arrived broken, the change time button wouldn't work. I couldn't change the hour/minutes/etc on the watch, rendering it useless haha. My first casio lasted a year until the latch broke. Nice watch, just not very durable"
1.0,Highly dissatisfied with my purchase. It was delivered 2 days late! I ordered the Olive Green and this is the color I received. Looks more washed blueish/grayish. The fit isn’t the greatest.
1.0,I've only bought one shirt on Amazon that actually fits properly
1.0,"NOT what was advertised! I expected Silver, not whatever fake metal they are made of. The pieces look cheap, and the large stones are dyed, the small ones are simply pieces of sequins."
1.0,"It was way too big. The fabric was “frumpy” and very thin. I don’t know what size the model is, but it definitely didn’t look like that one me. I am 5’9” and 165lbs and I got a L as directed and it looked like a sac."
1.0,"The mask itself is beautiful. Keeping it on is something else. The ribbon provided is flimsy and broke almost immediately. I retied it, and it literally shredded. I ended up using shoelaces to tie the mask on."
1.0,"The hood is nothing like the picture. Instead it's a flimsy, crooked mess. The strings sit odd no matter what I do. The material is thin and junky. I'm extremely disappointed."
1.0,"The tapers are like most tapers, long and bulky so not pointing fingers there. But the real problem comes with the tunnels. The lip on the tunnels is so small that it let my swollen, newly stretched ear go over it and take the earring in. Also the width of the tunnel is way to small for a swollen lobe, they suck."
1.0,Anybody over a size d cup this will not fit you!
1.0,"Band was very thin and poor quality for the price, looked and felt very cheap on my Apple Watch, returned ASAP"
1.0,100 percent not a precise fit . The glintbay lens has a curve to it compared to the actual lens that goes in the frames making it impossible to insert into the frame .
1.0,Not easy to use and did not fit appropriately
1.0,"You truly get what you pay for, it is made out of thing shirt material, looks cheeses on.  I'm hoping my son can use as a costume coat or sending to good will."
1.0,The zipper on it was very poor quality and was broken
1.0,It had a hole in the red seam and the fabric feels weird it collects all hair and fuzz may be wearable only once
1.0,Don't waste your money. Dead on arrival. Sun wont charge it.
1.0,This particular strap w blue and a trim of yellow was returned because the loop was backwards
1.0,"Cute bag. Worked as a small pool bag for a couple of months, then the seams split out and I tossed it."
1.0,It’s really loud buzzing noise
1.0,too hard to open unlike another brand i have.
1.0,NO support and terrible fit!
1.0,"This is completely see through,  like they didn’t  finish the dress by forgetting to sew a liner into it. This is scratchy and itchy.  Does not look like the picture, at all."
1.0,"What a ripoff. It does not even come with the wall plug. There is a base, a moderate quality cord and a piece of paper telling you to spend more money to use the thing."
1.0,"Good quality material but unless you are less than a B cup don't bother, no cups and no support"
1.0,"Very thin material, very large... size down"
1.0,Product is extremely thin and see through.
1.0,Water leaks out within days.
1.0,"I'm 5'3, 115lbs give or take. I usually wear xs/s and as nearly all the reviews said it ran small, I thought I'd be fine ordering a size small. Well the dress arrived very fast and the pattern and material were great but I was severely disappointed that the size small dress didn't fit me AT ALL. I was honestly swimming in it. In other customer pictures of people at my height, the dress was short and above the knee. Well the dress I received went past my knees and I had like seven extra inches of fabric around the chest and waist, it fit like an XXL! The tag says small but there is no way that is a small on anybody. Maybe mine was a mess up and got the tags switched?? Anyway, I am returning it and going to try reordering in XS in hopes that they give me the correct product to which I will then update this review.<br /><br />UPDATE: returned the size small and ordered an x-small. It was still way too large, had several inches to spare all over and the dress length still covered my knees, which mixed with the poof makes out for a very unflattering dress. I'm almost 30 and it made me look like a 9-yr-old trying on her mom's clothes. Maybe the company changed the design due to do many  complaints of it being too small, but now it's too big! Talk about fail at accurate sizing"
1.0,I'm so disappointed about this shirt. I ordered a xxl and didnt even try it on because it looks like a size large! So its immediately getting returned!
1.0,went in trash
1.0,This is clearly a 2x calling it self a 3x. Lies!!! All the people order a 3x and get a 2x fit<br />Very disappointed
1.0,Super thin and so see through if your a larger/ medium sized girl it’s definitely not for you!
1.0,"They come off too easily, leaving the glue on the nose piece.  In addition, they do not keep the glasses from sliding down your nose.  I will not purchase again."
1.0,Was not true to size very disappointed but customer service for returns was excellent
1.0,Big maybe order sometime but feel like back area looks bad made
1.0,Material muy débil . Mi hija usa talla 5 y si le queda un poco grande pero esto zapato si son demasiado
1.0,The fit around the bodice of this is APPALLING. It has weird flared bits.
1.0,"the suit was too large. When I went to return it, discovered I have to pay shipping myself and came from out of country. So basically you cant return it unless you want to pay outrageous amount."
1.0,"It was adorable, but like the other reviews - the bracelet kept falling off.  Now the hooks that attach the &#34;spoon&#34; arm to the snap keeps coming off.  I was only able to actually wear it once without a problem."
1.0,"Very pretty but too small. I wear a large, since The dress was 66% True I went for a xl. I need to order a 2x please."
1.0,Itchy returned it
1.0,Ordered two different sizes and couldn't tell a difference! Both were too small.
1.0,Does not look like the picture
1.0,This ring looks nothing like the picture. The stone sticks out way to far. UGLY
1.0,"maybe my arms are just too thin? Looked way too large on me, some one actually though I was covering a cast :("
1.0,"Super cute, love the length & color...very poor quality.<br /><br />The first time I wore it I was out to dinner with a group of friends. This yellow necklace went perfectly with my yellow bag & yellow sandals.<br /><br />While at dinner, I felt something tickling my neck. I went to touch the spot, and the necklace just fell on the table and beads bounced EVERYWHERE. SUPER EMBARASSING!<br /><br />I didn't even wear it for longer than two hours before it broke.  I know it didn't cost much, but I am disappointed it didn't last longer."
1.0,The around was correct. However the cups were maybe a C and I am much bigger. Cup size matters and should be included in the description.
1.0,These were to small for my feet a size 7 and cost to much to send back.
1.0,"Don’t buy this! If you try to use it for a nose ring, it won’t stay in your nose. I’ve lost several pieces. Don’t waste your money! Definitely not worth it."
1.0,The cardigans are EXTREMELY poor quality and a 4xl is the size Large if compared to other cardigans I have.  I did order them to EXTREMELY large for lounging around the house or to wear while working from home. To return the 3 cardigans I purchased is $27.98 via USPS 😳. More the they are worth to anyone!  Messaged seller waiting on response.
1.0,Both pairs of these glasses broke where the right temple piece attaches. PURE JUNK!
1.0,"I would give this produce a 0 if possible...<br />it arived, my husband barely tried to open the locket and the hinges snapped.<br />EXTREMELY CHEAPLY MADE.<br />would not recommend.<br />now on top of a loss, we are dealing with trying to replace these in time for the service."
1.0,It smelled terrible like chemicals. I would not let my granddaughter wear them . Returned
1.0,Broke the first day I got it :(
1.0,"This is a blanket. It looks nothing like the picture in either shape or color. It is a very light heather gray, and is in no way a shawl, wrap, or sweater. It's a smallish rectangular blanket made out of sweatshirt material. It also does not pack down particularly small so it is not a great travel option. Totally misleading description and photo."
1.0,"The quality of this shirt is horrible!!! It looks nothing like the picture. The graphics are fuzzy at best. The pic appears to be scanned, blown up & of terrible pixel quality. It is also printed off kilter.  It’s not even worth it to send it back as it shipped from China. The only good thing about it is that the size is actually right. I see the price has gone up since I made my purchase 3 weeks ago. Don’t bother wasting your money!!!! I’d give it zero stars but they won’t allow it."
1.0,"DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE (SUNNY DAYS DEPOT) I requested a return because the sweatshirt was smaller than expected, and the material is cheap, the picture was faded and the bracelet has faded colors. They emailed me back and said the refund request was closed-technical issue was resolved..?.....technical issue-for a sweatshirt...?"
1.0,A bunch of fake piercings! If I could give this 0 stars I would. I was looking forward to receiving my piercings but all I got was garbage if you're thinking about buying this product DON'T!
1.0,The clasps are stiff and hard to open. Basically you can't wear them because they would click in and get stuck in your nose. Save yourself and get something a lil more higher quality. Only 1 was openable and it ended up stuck in my nose and I had to use plyers to remove it lol
1.0,"The band snapped in two. It was NOT nickel free nor sterling silver. A word to the ring seeker on amazon: check out the site it's linked to to see if it's legit. If not, don't get it."
1.0,Totally and completely worthless if you are a man. Strap is WAY TOO SHORT so you can’t<br />Use the double metal bars to back up the pin. I wasted the money and $5 shipping. They lied about length being large enough for a large man. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,I don't recommend these unless the guests at your party are two years old!!!<br />They are absolutely TINY!!!!!  I was laughing so hard when I put one on because it looked completely ridiculous.  Half the size they should be.<br />Also they are a pain to put together
1.0,"Right out of the package I was so excited! It fit beautifully and was a light breezy fabric. However, it was a crinkly and creased mess so I threw it in a light wash with cold water and decided to air dry it. As soon as I pulled it out of the washing machine there was a huge hole!! I HAVEN'T EVEN WORN IT OUT! How disappointing."
1.0,Way too big for your face I've learned alot from buying stuff off internet I don't do it no more I'll pay more for stuff that fits
1.0,"Some chokers came in broken, I only got 9 out of the 10. Horrible!!"
1.0,Both earrings were broken on arrival
1.0,Is very small and flimsy not what I thought it was at all I should have read the reviews
1.0,"Horrible fit, thin material, wrinkled seams, terrible waistband. I do not recommend these."
1.0,I twisted them slightly to straighten and they ripped immediately. I didn’t even get to wear once
1.0,"They were all stretched out, not sure if I’m keeping them they fall off face ,and crooked."
1.0,It says one size. I thought it would be roomy. I could barely get it on and off. It will hang in the closet till I give it away or through it out.
1.0,"These look really nice in the pictures but they are not very pretty in person. The enamel is a mess all over the pendents, smudged, bleeding into other colors, and faded in some spots. I also did not get many of the pictured pendents and I got multiples of the same ones."
1.0,I DID NOT LIKE IT BECAUSE IT WONT FIT
1.0,"Fabric was strange, machine washable but not dryable. Size I ordered was at least 2 sizes too small!"
1.0,Frames are to small
1.0,Kids enjoyed it for a short time....it broke and does not work anymore
1.0,"The shoes looked as the picture, size was true, however the strap around the ankle popped out of seam... so they cannot be used after 2 hours of wear. Not happy!"
1.0,Didn’t fit. No free shipping back to China. No response from seller. Do not purchase
1.0,I bought these for my son because I thought they would've been gender neutral. The colors are not! The snowflakes vary from peach to pink. The material seems very cheap.
1.0,"these gaiters are thrown together. The material is basically cut and then sides are stitched together. There is no seam at the top or bottom, it is is just the cut material. Very disappointed in the construction."
1.0,Garbage. Total garbage. The fabric is extremely thin and very much see through. The band around the waist is not stretchy and is very unflattering. Tried them on once and never wore them again. Waste of money
1.0,Not happy at all. The pockets were protruding and was totally not sewn correctly. The tank top was too large. Cute print though. Not great quality. Returned it.
1.0,Had to return because the bar wouldn't unscrew so I couldn't even where it.
1.0,Turned my finger green after one day
1.0,I DID NOT LIKE IT. UNFORTUNATELY I READ THE REVIEWS AFTER I PURCHASED THE ITEM. NEVER AGAIN!!!
1.0,"Was  very nice looking. But once i put it on it was very lose. My galaxy active just slid around on my rist,and was unable to read my heart rate  ect bc it wasn't tight enough."
1.0,"This belt is so light, it feels like plastic. It broke just trying it on. Waste of money."
1.0,Product left black marks on my skin!!!
1.0,Does not look like picture. Way too large. Will probably donate.
1.0,"60% Polyester, 30% rayon, 5% spandex  - ugh - please give accurate description."
1.0,"Although it felt as good quality at first, the retractable pin broke with in the first week. I was disappointed. After all, I work on cars and move around with my keys all day, it didn’t keep up with me which was a bummer."
1.0,"It looks like Hugh Hefner pajamas, don't even think you can wear it to the club. I returned it immediately."
1.0,I ordered a size bigger and I couldn’t even get it on.
1.0,I’ve had really good luck with buying lingerie and nighties on Amazon. This is the first one I’ve got that is just garbage. It is way too short certainly isn’t as long as the one in the picture in the material looks faded brand new.
1.0,It rubs your skin off when putting it on.
1.0,"I live internationally and this was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my husband.  It will fit my grandson in a couple of years.  He will be 6 then.  It is a beautiful sweater, but it is NOT an XL for an adult man!  LOL!!"
1.0,I ordered the largest size available and it would have fit a 11-year old child
1.0,Did not represent the size I ordered.
1.0,"Tried all ways but this just does not fit properly on the ears, keeps slipping off which is annoying during winter, does not serve the purpose, which is to cover the ears from chilling air. Even my over the ear head phone music system fits perfectly, but this product is definitely not designed properly."
1.0,"I'm so heartbroken that the brooch I ordered is not the brooch I received. The image displays a full needle clasp, but I received a tack back pin. I used to owned a pin very similar to the one in the image, but it was lost awhile back. I've missed that pin ever since, and was so hopeful that this item was the same thing. The real thing would be better quality and wouldn't flip upside down once it's pinned in. I'm very upset that this listing deceived me. :,("
1.0,It arrived with half of the stones missing. I cannot even wear it. I am extremely disappointed.
1.0,"I ordered a white shirt, but they sent me an old stock, yellowish shirt. Thread quality is inferior. Don’t bother to order this. Returning it. 🤬"
1.0,"I hate this purse, it's very large which I'm not used to. I wish I could return it it's really ugly too."
1.0,The teal is not teal at all. More of a hunter green
1.0,It was damaged when I got it and cheaply made
1.0,"36DD shows as a large on the size chart however when I opened the package it looked like it would fit a B cup, max.  The fabric is very soft and seems like it would be wonderful but it is definitely not sized correctly based on their cart and I cannot wear it to give a review of wear or comfort, ease of use etc. I want to love this bra, but it is unusable."
1.0,Keeps falling down!
1.0,"I can't turn the volume down. I can turn the volume up, so now it is stuck on the highest volume. The button to turn it down don't work. Dang it!!"
1.0,"The dress was stretched out at the straps,  you should be ashamed"
1.0,It broke as soon as my daughter put it on
1.0,the material is so bad on it the print is not very  visible this thing is almost like having a rag thrown over no stretch on it almost just hangs on you like cloth
1.0,"Not only did the chains break the second I got them, but they were way too big for my neck. The black material was nice so if you have the exact size neck that would fit without the chain, you're golden."
1.0,Way too small fit my daughter perfectly and she wears a size 12 but the slip was for me and I wear a size 1x.
1.0,Didn't fit  in need to.exchange to small er zize
1.0,Rhinestones all started falling out the first time I wore it
1.0,These were way too long!
1.0,This product looked like the logo was white and it turns out it is pink !!! Very disappointed because it was a gift for my bf
1.0,"this dress was an embarrassment for your company.  I ordered a Large, as I did others in the same order.  2 of the dresses fit just fine, no issues.<br />2 of them were too small, I returned them and reordered in an XL and they were still too small so i'm going to have to pay shipping again to return them.  this particular dress was even smaller than the 2 I had returned, even though it was supposedly the same dress in another color. but it isn't the same dress. it doesn't button down the front like the other 2, it shouldn't have been part of the choices.  it was so small that  I would have had to order this 3 sizes larger just to fit. this was no where near the measurements for a size L.  this manufacturer needs to be more consistent with sizing. if the size chart says size 12 to 14, it needs to be that.  this dress fit as if it were a size 6 or 8.  I shouldn't have to pay return shipping for something that was so small."
1.0,Wrong design and problem with frame.
1.0,The gold isn’t the right shade of gold
1.0,Less than 20 minutes with ring and now I have a beautiful GREEN finger!
1.0,"Have been trying to find “slouchy “leg warmers for my 7yo daughter and was hoping these were the answer. Sadly , I had to return these and the two others I purchased. They were not slouchy at all and too small. Possibly I did not read the item description properly. 😢😢. Still in search of..."
1.0,I have worn these less than 10 times and today when I got back from my ride they were Swiss cheese. Was hoping these would be ok.
1.0,"For the price I didn’t  expect much but paired with a cardigan I though it may be decent. It was thin as expected, but the static was so horrible I couldn’t wear it.  Sprayed it down with static guard and it didn’t touch it. Returned... I wouldn’t recommend this dress."
1.0,I wear a large which is what I ordered I should have ordered an XL material is cheap.
1.0,Bad quality and ridiculous sizing
1.0,"Very pretty but it broke the first time I wore it. I put it on to wear to work and noticed it was missing from my wrist. I sit at a desk and type all day so I wasn’t doing anything rough. I found it on the floor by my desk. I did like it, sad it broke so easily"
1.0,I loved the size and how they looked but the stone came out the 1st day I wore them
1.0,Horribly uncomfortable mask. The seam right down the middle of the mask rubs annoyingly
1.0,The fabric is too flimsy .....
1.0,not god quality the material ripped off easily
1.0,I loved the print but the clothes has no structure or supportive stretch or is the least bit thick. (think cheap tank top) It just sits on the body and not in a good way. The tag on the skirt were cut off and it left a pretty noticeable hole next to where the tag should have been. Im returning this.
1.0,At least two sizes too small
1.0,After 1 use the silver tarnished. Waste of money. Don’t buy
1.0,the chains broke within a few days  they don't fit together and look cheap but that's what we get for the price
1.0,Didnt like them too flimsy
1.0,It was so poorly made I couldn't even see it. Likely due to the fact that it did not exist in my presence on Christmas even though I ordered it weeks beforehand.
1.0,"Beautiful, but I only received one of each clip. I am returning for them to try again.<br /><br />Update:  I returned the incomplete pair and reordered. This morning my package came ONCE AGAIN with one of each clip, and one of the clips was loose, not even in the pack. Nice items, but I’m through. Trying another merchant."
1.0,This runs way small! I am a 1 to 2X in pretty much everything and I ordered two sizes up . And it still fit like a tight dress . I was really hoping that it would be nice and flows!!
1.0,"If I could give this zero stars I would, the product ripped as soon as we opened the package.  It is very low quality."
1.0,The shoes are to big Sorry for the trouble. I am not happy .I would like to order more things but at this time .I  can not do until things  get done on this order .I would love to try a different size on these boots a 7 1/2.please
1.0,The description of this hoodie is WRONG! I'm a XL/1X and I purchased a 3X in this hoodie and it is too SMALL. Would have returned but I gave it to a little girl. The quality is also poor. I would NOT recommend purchase of this hoodie.
1.0,this necklace arrived broken and parts of it was missing so couldnt even make it work. was disappointed it looks nice in photo.
1.0,"I didn’t like this dress, very cheap looking compared to the picture on line"
1.0,Shirt was way too small to fit me even though I ordered XXL
1.0,Don't buy!!!!! This shoe is terribly made as you can see. Highly disappointed!!! And not comfortable at all
1.0,looked nice in box after third wear blue stone fell out of earring and the metal is very flimsy and easily bent.
1.0,The strap on the back broke as I try it on.
1.0,"(Girlfriend's purchase) I did not even try it on, as the moment I opened the bag, I knew it's not going to work. I don't know what I should expect, as it's cheap for a real lederhosen, but it's very overpriced for a bad costume sewing product. Unfortunately it was the later. Don't waste your time/postage/resources."
1.0,Nope quit working 2 nd day of having it already sent back
1.0,Not even close to American sizes. I wear a 12 and ordered a couple sizes up. I gave them to my sister who wears a 6 and they still fit her right in the legs and really lose in the waist. Poor quality all around.
1.0,Absolutely love this belt. Get lots of compliments. 1 star cause it's not made in the US other than that 5 stars
1.0,"CHEAP QUALITY STAY AWAY, BAD COMPANY"
1.0,"Love the shirt, would definitely recommend it. The reason for my 1 star review is that I ordered a different shirt from this seller, and they sent me this one along with it and charged me for both! Since it was under 10 dollars I did not feel it was worth my time to contact the seller, seeing as I loved the shirt. However, it is beside the point that I love the shirt seeing as I didn't order it, nor did I choose to pay for it. I suppose this seller just made that decision for me? I spend hundreds of dollars on amazon and have never encountered this problem, and it kind of made me question the safety of my card information and the security of my identity not being abused or taken advantage of. Definitely will think twice about buying from this seller again, the only reason I would still consider it is because the shirts I order were extremely cute and fit very well."
1.0,"The material its made of is very stretchy t-shirt like and very, very poor quality.<br />the size is way too big and it does not have any shape to it."
1.0,"Dissapointed again, looks nothing like it does on here in the picture. When I got it, it looked like something that came out of a gumball mashine but didn't pay but $3 so can't really complain to much. Guess I won't be ordering jewlery online again 😒"
1.0,button broke as soon as i buttoned it. this is useless until i sew it back on but that doesn't look possible as this is not a normal button.
1.0,"broke within 1 month of use, a what a piece of crap. Will not buy another item from this seller!!"
1.0,WAY to SMALL for the money! Had to keep them as earrings where a planned gift that I did not have time to exchange.
1.0,"Purchase this for my granddaughter's birthday. I looked at it when I first received it and thought it was very cute. She's not big on jewelry so I thought this would be simple enough for her to try. I purchased a few other things and added this to a gift bag for her. The day of her party, she open the ring and it was completely black. Covered with tarnish. Had not been out of the box since the day I received it. I was so embarrassed when she opened that in front of her guests. Pitched it in the garbage. It was over 30 days since I had ordered it and could not return it. Beware purchasing any of these products."
1.0,"Utterly useless!  Zipper is hard to zip, and then it pops open VERY easily.  Sports bra?  I don't think so!  It's not too small, it just has a REALLY flimsy zipper!"
1.0,Only received 11 rings and not 12.  The bag they came in was opened in th box.
1.0,had to return. needed a 3 x for a gift and fabric was cheap thin material  not at all sweatshirt material as stated in ad  also item was very short .
1.0,This shirt is cut very small an xl is more like a medium<br />I would not recommend this product looks cheap
1.0,These pajamas were tiny.  Bought a women's XL for my daughter in case they ran small.  Even the XL was way too small.
1.0,Tried these out and my daughter ended up getting a rash twice! We thought the first time might of been because of food but come to find out it happened the same way after using this product for a second time! Don’t recommend for baby’s with sensitive skin!
1.0,Cute but can’t fit properly good for home wear too pricey.
1.0,"I purchased this band to protect the bezel and face of my tracker . I didn't realize that I had to remove tracker to charge it. By having to remove the tracker every morning to charge it, the band broke after only having it a month. It tore at the corner when stretching to put the tracker back in it. Not sure what totry next."
1.0,"So thin, see through, cheaply made."
1.0,I only used it a couple weeks and now its unusable because the strap guard is broken
1.0,"Horrible and worst item bought, within 1 week the dots at the bottom of slipper wore out, ended up throwing them away<br />and purchased a very similar item at Walmart for"
1.0,Thru it in the trash
1.0,"While the t-shirt fits well, the fabric is very odd. Very clingy and feels heavy. Gave it away as I bought it to wear on 4th of July but couldn't stand wearing it in the heat of summer."
1.0,Bought the wrong size
1.0,We are so disappointed with this dress. It has blood stains on it. It stinks of body odor. It was advertised as brand new with the tags on. SO SO Frustrated!
1.0,Ordered XL. Item received tgged XL but impossibly small (maybe &#34;XL&#34; for ab=nearly adolescent? Nicely made - but impossible to wear. (I am only 40&#34; chest)
1.0,I wanted a new leather jacket and I had hopes that it would look like the one I had before that was just small but this one was rather large so it didn’t work for me
1.0,"Dress arrived with loose threading throughout. Very poor quality. In addition, dress does not fit to size. If you’re interested in wasting your money, then order one size larger than your actual size. Also, be prepared to have a pair of scissors ready to cut LOTS of loose threading. I’ll cut this dress to make a small makeup purse, and use the rest of the crappy material to sew a bed throw to cover my feet. Such a waste!!!!"
1.0,I love the belt but it broke first time I was putting it on to wear it.
1.0,Used it for barely 2 months and the metal broke on the clip...
1.0,"The leather on these gloves is super soft. However, there is an odd smell (perhaps the dye used?) and the fingers are too long and a little tight."
1.0,"I wear a medium, these damn things are labeled as a medium but fit like a large!"
1.0,The general workmanship is terrible.  The bias strip was not properly sewn and immediately prevented me from adjusting the size of the belt.  Returning immediately.
1.0,Couldn't use on the chair bands
1.0,Ordered the largest one possible and it's still the size of a small.
1.0,"Adorable, but that's all. The Pants are very thin. They seemed to fit &#34;okay&#34; but figured we better hem them up because they were so long. We figured we'd better wash them first, as labeled just in case there was any shrinkage. Well, there wound up being SO much shrinkage that they no longer fit AND they were too short! So these are going back. I don't recommend this product to anyone at all."
1.0,They were cute but they run very small I sent mine back toady
1.0,Could clear as day see the boob padding. Top was completely see through.<br />So unflattering. Cheaply made too.
1.0,I bought an XL and it definitely was not XL
1.0,everything wore off of it after 2 washes in cold water.  I got taken.
1.0,"Too small, too short. Tight at top area of the sleeve. Will have to find another company to get one that, hopefully,  will fit properly."
1.0,"Even small size, its too big!"
1.0,the arms are way to long and suffocates your arms its pretty much a long sleeved sports bra
1.0,"Just opened the box and saw the a big red patch rocket rugged, sewn to the chest. Horrible quality, does not look as it does in the picture."
1.0,Looked like nightgown.
1.0,"These are awful masks. Scratchy feels like burlap. I even tried washing, didn't help."
1.0,"I know my size, and these couldn’t even fit my 15 year old daughter who’s a 6."
1.0,My wife said it's worst quality
1.0,"I do like the color and the look, but Scoyco always send any size the have available not the one you order I have already returned three Scoyco jackets for the same reason. This jacket look nice, but also cheap made"
1.0,This shirt runs small and very very short.  I ordered an XL which I normally wear comfortably without being too small.  I don't like clothes too tight but also not baggy like a dress either.  I'm 6'1 225lbs.
1.0,It was delivered with a broken buckle.  This is a very flimsy and cheap belt.  Don't expect it to last very long.
1.0,Was not what I expected. Material was very flimsy. Retuned item
1.0,Completely see-thru. Barely got them on and could already see my legs. I really liked the feel and print. But see-thru pants where you could clearly see everything is a HUGE deal breaker
1.0,This item does NOT fit like the picture unless I guess you are a size 0. I am not big and it fit to tight. I wanted it to fit loose and hang a littler. Instead it hugged from the neck to the waist I sent back and got a full refund.
1.0,Had to return because other part of order was wrong.
1.0,I have worn these for like a week and they're already tarnishing..
1.0,Boobs aren’t in right place dollar store quality not even for halloween
1.0,The stone was not positioned in the setting and hung over the edge on one side.  Not worth returning via postage costs/cost of the ring.  Very disappointing.
1.0,They don’t come in a box. They come in a bag. I got them and they’re all creased and bent. There’s no way to buff out the creases in the shiny part on the heal. When buying boots find out if they come in a box before buying. Lesson learned.
1.0,Extremely cheap quality
1.0,"Really wanted to start taking this tomorrow, but BOTH saftey seals were broken. The cap came off without having to take off the plastic wrap, and the seal to the bottle came right off with no effort."
1.0,Way too small! This was NOT a xxl in America!! Gave the shirt to my tiny friend so she could wear it!!
1.0,"These fit great length wise but are really big around the waist which would be fine if they had those stretchy waist button things but sadly they don’t. My son is 5 and of average height and weight, he has to wear a belt sinched up on all three pairs I got him."
1.0,It’s too big and did not fit me.
1.0,Ordered a 4xl and it arrived in 8xl
1.0,Picture very misleading does not have bangs
1.0,Fit was terrible and the material on the bottom portion is stiff almost like a bad kitchen towel. No good!
1.0,doesn't look good on the glasses
1.0,Smells so bad
1.0,"Ordered this twice. The first was too big. Loose around the ankle. Odd fit across the toes. And the arch support hit closer to my heel than my mid-foot. Tried it in a smaller size, and imagine my surprise when I had the same issues! Strange fit all around."
1.0,"I was so excited for these and was horribly disappointed. As soon as I opened them I could tell the fabric was crappy but I gave them a chance anyways and tried them on. They gave zero support, were baggy at the ankles, and were so thin and cheap feeling. I have bought several pairs of yoga pants for less money and all have been better quality than these."
1.0,Maybe I just have small head but I really dont think so. This beret was way too large to be a one size fits all. I ended up throwing it away.
1.0,Doesn't feel nor act like wool and doesn't keep my feet warm.  Too much polyester and spandex in it.  Returned for a refund.
1.0,"Bracelette itself was very pretty and sparkly, but it turned my wrist green after only hours of wear. Also gave me some type of chemical burn"
1.0,Bottoms are tiny and way small. Doesn’t cover anything. Would not buy again and couldn’t return. Wouldn’t not recommend!!
1.0,"This is in the top 3 of worst garments ever purchased on Amazon. It is HUGE, but too short. There are french seams across the armholes, but they are inside out. The elastic under the bust is bare. I could easily fit 2 if me in this travesty. Also it was obviously a return as it was wadded up and the sleeves were turned half inside out. I have several caftans from this brand that I adore, just not this one."
1.0,I have bought several pair of so called night driving glasses. They l have not cut down on head light glare at all.
1.0,I am always a 36 B. I could not get the ends of this bra within 5 inches of each other around my back. Totally mis-sized.
1.0,"Terrible! If I didn’t thrown it out I would show it, it’s not worth buying nor for me to pay to return it."
1.0,"Bought 2 of these, it's printed as size M on both pairs of socks but it's actually a different size if compare side by side"
1.0,I ordered a 4XL and it probably fit like a 1X
1.0,It was broken when I received it. Looked pretty that's about it
1.0,The product was not a compression shirt as advertised
1.0,"This item looks nothing like the picture. They stole the picture off of Monif website that sells plus size clothing. Item looks cheap and is not even close to the picture. I'm assuming the company is in China and I have been burnt many times by these sellers, had I known I wouldn't have wasted my time or money ordering this item."
1.0,Absolutely the worst shocks for wear and tear. Holes within one month. Stay away from these socks.
1.0,why complain if your buying a cheap neck less online and your complying about it ? 😑✋you get what you paid for .
1.0,"Extremely small, ordered a size bigger than I normally wear because I like loose shirts but it is like skin on a hotdog, it also had a foul odor like propane too it. Tried to return but the international shipping is almost more than I paid so it's not worth it to get a whole 3.00 back. Do not buy this trash."
1.0,They use formaldehyde resin to make these gloves and as a result they smell exactly like rotting fish. Do not buy them. They are disgusting.
1.0,Sizing is horrible and ridiculous and I even ordered UP a few sizes. No stretch at all. Awful leotard
1.0,"It’s weird the thumbs are super long, at least 1.5cm longer than usual"
1.0,Product was packaged very poorly. The hat was crumpled up and is creased. Poor quality all around.
1.0,Nice quality but not a good fit.... Adjustment disfigured hat.
1.0,The only reason I purchase was because I needed photochromic sunglasses. They are not.
1.0,Love the bag but its broken
1.0,"Wow....just awful. I'm not sure what they tried to do here, but it was barely even a shirt. You need a whole manual to figure out how to put it on and when you get it on it's just a mess. I can't even describe it. Stay away."
1.0,Fabric is too thin. Feels cheap. Back it goes.
1.0,I didn't drop the glasses or anything.  The left side of the bar that rests on the nose just broke off from the frame around the left lens.  So obviously not made of the best material.  I guess you can't expect much more considering they were like $3.
1.0,I was very disappointed in the horrible quality of the material. It would be a great bag with all the great compartments and carrying options if it wasn't so cheaply made.
1.0,"Stiff, clumsy, loud, plain."
1.0,This is child size not for an adult
1.0,Slip knot doesn’t stay in place
1.0,If I can give it a minus star I would it was on for one day and it broke...waste of money
1.0,This runs insanely big and is awkward
1.0,The material was too thin and see through. Fits small.
1.0,Wanted to love these but unfortunately they were described as a pink cream but came as a peach. And I will be returning them. The quality was what you would expect for a cheap on-trend earring I had no problem with that part nor the weight of them that was fine but I was looking for a blush pink earring and this was definitely Peach. So back to Amazon they go. Still looking for that perfect pink earring for summer.
1.0,"I loved this, wore it once, and then the sleeves unraveled at the seams. Cheaply made. Maybe it was a bad batch; I ordered another color at the same time, and it’s held together, but pilled quickly. You get what you pay for."
1.0,The antlers are too heavy and pull the whole headband down. Just does not work.
1.0,Not real silver. Turned already.
1.0,"Provider sent wrong a size (way too big).  Just offer refund 50% & request the buyer to give it to someone else as gift.  If the buyer wants to exchange, he/she needs to responsible for the mailing return fee.  There wasn't any statement listed in the product during purchase.  If I were known that, I would never buy this in the first place."
1.0,Dos NOT look at all compare with pic! You can save money by using “washer from your kitchen tap” if interested on these junk! I assume it cost less than 25 cents to make them!
1.0,VERY cheaply made in fabric and stitching.  Don’t waste your money.
1.0,This dress not worth it take down small is a girl size will not pay a nickel for it take long to come I forgot I ordered it no no no
1.0,I was surprised when I opened the box that the blouse was not folded like items I'd received in other orders. This was rumpled up in a plastic bag tied in a knot. Upon opening it I was hit with a distasteful and strong perfume.  It had obviously been worn before and returned.  It had snags too.
1.0,Too tight not easy to breath in  muffled sound
1.0,My hat constantly fell off my bag because the clip wouldn’t stay.  Returned!
1.0,Waaaay Too Small!
1.0,The material is really cheap. I’m a large and the large was really big. Not a good dress
1.0,"Several drawbacks to this mousepad so I am discarding and buying another.  The days of the week are NOT readable because the font is so small.  In addition, the first day on the calendar is Monday and not Sunday making it very easy to use the wrong date when trying to read.  The entire font is truly soo small.  Why have &#34;2016&#34; on top of each month?  Use larger font and do not put the year behind every month."
1.0,"Cheap screen printing.  Before I even wore it the lettering was cracking.  It has been washed 2 times and won't hold up much longer.  Cheap quality, wouldn't buy again."
1.0,"Just an empty case with no label maker or tape inside, it wasn’t even in a box when it arrived just sitting sad and alone, a loose empty little case being jostled around in a bigger box…how could this happen. Poor lost pink little case"
1.0,Wrinkles bad. Returned!
1.0,"the ear-holes are made for little mouse ears, and their placement puts the fabric directly in your eyes."
1.0,"garbage, don't waste your money thinking you're getting something comparable to the designer look, see through, oddly cut, cheap looking rivets."
1.0,It was okay but still felt and looked cheap. Too loose
1.0,These are shown as diy bangles for bracelet making but there's no outlet or a hook to.open the bangle. Such a waste if time. Had to buy something else last minute for my party.
1.0,"I ordered the correct size which fit perfectly EXCEPT THESE ARE IN NO WAY COMPRESSION AS ADVERTISED.<br />To even get a mild compression across the abdomen I had to gather and pin the back taking in at least 6"" of fabric. I am returning the tanktops for a refund. This is the product description: ""Compression Base Layer Dry Fit Tank Top"", which is why I ordered them to support my abdomen after surgery, so I call this blatant false advertising."
1.0,Ring connected to this has been broke. Not worth it
1.0,This is more of daisy than sunflower.
1.0,"Horrible,much too big to carry in purse and very cheaply made. Very dissapointed."
1.0,The top of the bathing suit is stretched out and not even. The bottom is to loose.
1.0,Lenses won't stay snapped into place with the flimsy frame. Nose piece is misshaped so it leaves a tender(sore) spot on the bridge of my nose. Would NOT buy again nor recommend
1.0,"The fit was as expected...but once wet, they constantly came off my daughters feet. My daughter is special needs and needs something on her feet when in water. They rubbed her feet so bad when wet, we had to take her to ER due to blisters on her toes. When you would remove them, the insoles would come off as well. Very disappointed."
1.0,Received water damaged returned.
1.0,Does not work or fit.
1.0,I guess you get what you pay for. There’s been broke after a couple weeks of usage. I do not recommend.
1.0,"I bought the solid red one and I'm really disappointed<br />1. It's very cheaply made. ( there's a hole in the side seam )<br />2. The color is off from the picture shown...  it's more of a fire truck red, which I don't like...<br />3. They forgot to sent me the belt / tie that goes with it.... and to top it off.....<br />4. They sent me the wrong size :( [ASIN:B01CU3GN0A Samtree Womens Polka Dot Dress,Vintage 1950s Style Short Sleeves Rockabilly Dresses]]"
1.0,I bought this for my husband who is 5'5.. her was swimming in it...way too long!
1.0,The color change from golden to cast iron color.
1.0,Broke at the sides in less than 1 weeks .
1.0,Material does not give at all. Purchased 12-14. Size was way offI’ a suze 12. My Mother-in-law is a size 8 and this fit her perfectly.
1.0,Don't waste your money. This shirt looks like a dishrag. It's not a sweater material. Its more like a really thin thermal material. The bottom looks like it was just cut off the fabric line. Probably would fall apart after one wash. See picture attached.
1.0,This material doesn’t feel like cotton it isn’t stretchy and it runs small. Item came with no label/brand and has not size label either.
1.0,"Bought these two month before the kids went back to school(big mistake). After the kids wearing them a few times, one side wont charge any more. Plus i bought another pair for the older one and his went out the next day. I dont recommend. Kids loved it but wish it lasted"
1.0,[[VIDEOID:1b822a8c04b3d2b4c60e9e6ef934191d]] The chain changed colors in less than a week. The lowest quality that I've ever seen...
1.0,Opened the package and found the necklace in 3 pieces. It was already broken!
1.0,No point in having these. No support.
1.0,It was cheap looking and uncomfortable.
1.0,Don't buy this shirt!! The leopard does not look like what normal leopard should look like it's like bright orange and looks awful when contrast with the pink. You need like 2 sizes bigger than you normally would wear and it's just all around an awful purchase
1.0,"This is what they looked like after 3 weeks of wear. Paint chipping and wearing off everywhere. Spend the extra money to get the real deal, otherwise you'll just be replacing these every month."
1.0,Had a blue line defect and they refunded the order but I wanted the shirt.
1.0,"Actually, when I tried it on, the material is so thin it reminded me of my 93 year old mother's night gown.  There is no way I would wear it outside."
1.0,"Less than impressed I would have figured the compass would have been off set so as the points are always pointing down,on the one I received the hinge points down, I am glad I didn't give this as a gift."
1.0,Too thin!! See through
1.0,The print was too small and didn't go across the shirt how it was advertised. Every other Mobb Deep shirt I purchased had been thorough until this one. Smh
1.0,"I loved how these earrings look however, very cheaply made and broke 10 minutes after wearing them."
1.0,"Tela de baja calidad, muy grandes y sin forma."
1.0,"This tunic top runs so small. It will show every bump and bulge, (even if you are thin.)"
1.0,"We found these to be inconsistent with other Under Armour shorts of the same size. MUCH bigger and very, very long."
1.0,"Despite the protection, they were delivered with very obvious scratches on the lens."
1.0,Laces shown are clearly all gold and the other pair are all silver.  What arrived today were one pair that were BOTH gold and silver.  We can’t use these!
1.0,"Not very happy with this item, tarnished, looks used, very unhappy with this item. I guess you get what you paid for!!"
1.0,Absolutely hated everything about this shirt.
1.0,"pants described as loose, comfy, casual. they were EXTRMELY small and short!"
1.0,they are not worth the money. literally started breaking as soon as we put them on
1.0,The jumpsuit was to small for its size and they offer no return policy.
1.0,"Hated this dress!  So short that it looked like a T-shirt instead of a dress. I knew it would be on the shorter side which I am okay with, but it basically showed by behind, which is not what I was looking for.<br />The quality was also quite poor, it was super sheer and it was missing the button on the back of the neck which is what holds the top of the dress together. Immediately sent back and received a prompt refund."
1.0,"My daughter thought it was itchy and tight. She kept saying no, no too small! She just turned 2 but is tall and wears 3T"
1.0,"This looked really pretty but no matter how I tied it, it would not lay right on the chest area. Had to send back."
1.0,Its junk don't buy it. Two days after I bought it it came undone and I lost my fitbit.  Don't buy this unless you want to lose your fit bit.
1.0,Run very small!!
1.0,"The goggles seemed like they were pretty high quality right out of the box, but I was really disappointed when I used them for the first time. The lenses are absolutely trash. They make everything underwater fall out of focus, and the moment the inside got wet, it revealed that the entire lens was already covered with scratches. Save your money, these are trash."
1.0,the item is super cute for the price but it was dated backwards ://
1.0,The clip doesn't work like it should and thelens' not only cover the glasses but they reach my lower cheek. they look very odd on a face.
1.0,Awful.  Bad quality.
1.0,"Very cheap made, it keeps breaking in me, so now su need to but another one .. done gluing it"
1.0,Not what I expected..
1.0,"I ordered a 5x because I LOVE big and comfy....this was not it! I couldn’t even get it over my head, and I usually take a 2x.... sent back!"
1.0,Not true to size... returned.
1.0,I barely had these shades for 30 days and the entire hinge and arm just fell while walking in the mall. I was actually satisfied with these until that happened
1.0,"They are extremely difficult to put on, the finger holes are hard to find, extremely to thick where you can’t even move your fingers"
1.0,"it has cheap breast cups in the top making it very noticeably cheap.it also itches. the glitter is flying all over the place and all over my face when putting it on, this thing is hideous."
1.0,Definitely NOT 14k overlay! This is very misleading and I can’t believe that they can get away with it. Cheap jewelry. Looks like something you get out of a bubble gum machine!
1.0,"The bracelet was stiff and all the crystals, etc were in strips and glued on.  Like another person's review...when you tried to put it around your arm the glued ends came up and the strands started separating.  I should have read the reviews first..my fault.  Did not consider it even worth the postage to return so I threw it in the garbage."
1.0,"The material and sewing is of good enough quality. But, whoever designed this shirt has no idea how a traditional grandfather shirt should be made.<br /><br />The sleeves are almost too long, but the shoulders are almost too tight. So, I did get the right size.<br /><br />However, a grandfather shirt should be loose fitting...some more than others. And while for a contemporary styled shirt the girth is not too small, the only way this shirt could be considered loose-fitting would be on someone who is down-right skinny.<br /><br />A grandfather shirt is nowadays not tucked into the pants. And if you look at the photos, this shirt barely goes over his belt. Simply, it's a good 3 to 4 inches too short."
1.0,"I did not like the product.  I would not recommend it. I received a different product than what was on the picture and what I order, after several weeks. I will not order from seller again."
1.0,"Some of the LEDs came off in the package, the headbands were very awkward and don't sit right on the head due to the part that comes down below the headband... returned immediately."
1.0,Size said 34 to 38 inch waste. They have to be smaller than 34. Label says large but they are not. Love the colors and the fabric. Shame as they are exactly what I was wanting. Slightly disappointed but I will survive. Will probably not order clothes thru Amazon due to size confusion. Thanks for your concern.
1.0,"not as described. hard plasticky and heavy, not soft leather and light. Of course it's cheap, and I didn't expect a $200 bag for $30. But the description was so far off, beware. If you are looking for a shiny hard and sturdy affordable purse go ahead. Soft leather tote, no, this isn't it. Great amazon costumer service though - I returned it."
1.0,THEY ARE PAYING PEOPLE TO GIVE THEM GREAT REVIEWS
1.0,Looks like last year’s style. Product returned.
1.0,If I could give it 0 stars I would. I tried to put the back on and the post bent in half.  Cheap junk that was going to be a gift.  Don't waste your money
1.0,The sides aren't high enough so my hair tie just keeps rolling off...
1.0,"Order two sizes up from yours, the shirt is super compress and tight , I guess that if you have a lot of muscles to show is ok, but for all the other majority of million of people that don’t , it sucks"
1.0,Nice quality product. Had a few spots but customer service has been good so far. The pictures are just so they can see the spots.<br /><br />Please contact me once you have viewed the photos.<br /><br />Update: started out very pleased. The customer service was quick and responsive about the stains. Was told to try and lightly wash them out. That didn’t work and I have not been able to get a response from the seller since. That was two days ago.<br /><br />Very disappointed.
1.0,The string on the lights and the plug are black (not white as shown) and do not show up on the dark grey shirt. Wish it had been as shown on picture. I’ll be returning.
1.0,They were too tight way too tight on my feet to where it would swell my feet
1.0,Hat came today but was NOTHING like the picture. Logo had a fat white border around the words which is not what the pic looked like. Cheap had looked like it was made in a garage
1.0,"too large! and the red is way lighter from what is shown in the pic. I'm actually giving it to another friend whom I think it might fit, it would cost me more to ship it back and have it come back to me from China."
1.0,"Cheap material.  Belt is a strip of the dress material.  Fits like a potato sack.<br />Return is easy if you use the return at kohl’s option, so if you want to try dress out... go for it.  I hated it."
1.0,"I do t even think it deserves one star.  Got here timely but was missing the key chain, so empty package."
1.0,To large!!
1.0,Fell apart as I was putting it on for the first time.
1.0,I’m 5’1 and I weigh 105. I felt like it was dragging and it was not flattering on me whatsoever
1.0,I reterned that bra. It was too big. When will I get my money back????
1.0,They keep falling off!! Very bad grip.. I kept pulling them to stay around my feet once every 20 mins.. I will be returning them
1.0,"This did not work for me at all, and am not sure how it would work for anyone.  I think the only reason I was able to give it one star was because when warn with a tight, somewhat supportive halter top, it keeps them in place so they don't go flat."
1.0,This dress was torn when I only used once
1.0,Love the material but hate the length.... I am 5ft 4 in and even in heels I have to get this thing adjusted.  I might just use the material for pillows or something.
1.0,"The chain links had a portion that were not at all ""linked"" and just twisted. Would injure someone if worn."
1.0,This top is poorly made
1.0,Cute bra no support.
1.0,does not look like the picture.  the material is way to thin and the slit looks open because one leg is out in front but no the slit goes up almost to your crouch.  several people tried it on and it looked bad on everyone.  return time is also too short.
1.0,Have had them less than a week and they have already broken.  Very disappointed
1.0,Very cheap plastic. 3 out of 5 delivered were already cracked by the key ring. Definitely would not hold up a day in a pocket. Returned for refund.
1.0,Ordered XL Men's & they are not only way to small the zipper is on the left in my world that's a Woman's jacket . I informed them & they insist the order is correct & did not offer a replacement.
1.0,Missing both some whole earrings and some jewels. Not worth it
1.0,"The 22mm strap is about what I would expect for the money. Not great, but not terrible. However, the 20mm strap is an entirely different issue. The hardware was sewn on incorrectly, which required pulling out the stitches on one end and resewing it. I won't buy any more of these. Also, the hardware for the 20mm is the same size they use on the 22mm, so it's too big. And, they're made in China, so there's that."
1.0,Arm holes are tiny!! And the body is huge
1.0,"My daughter leaked right through them soon after putting on. As you can imagine embarrassment soon followed. And she had a light period so I can’t imagine how they work for other young ladies. I feel horrible, sticking with Always pads."
1.0,My son only wore it twice and it broke.
1.0,"What a huge disappointment. I bought this for my grandson. The interchangeable faces just slide in a slot. When he moves his arm, it falls right out. You have to open it to even see the time, and it's way tt hard for his little hands to open it. A huge waste of money. I plan on returning it. My Grandson is a Thomas the Train fanatic, and he wants nothing to do with  this poorly designed watch,"
1.0,"Not modal,  still really soft but very thick. Bait and switch."
1.0,"Glasses hard to place on nose bridge . They fall off , don’t stay in place. Covered my c as meta when attached to back of phone"
1.0,"Advertising for this product is misleading.  Description and photo indicate a card of 5 batteries, but you actually get only one."
1.0,Bought a 3x fits like a large
1.0,"I was do disappointed when I got this tie in the mail. It was for my boyfriend for a wedding and we wanted purple and grey stripes. When I opened it I got this hideous purple, blue, grey tie. I am just glad that there is enough time before the wedding to return this and get a new one."
1.0,Fits ugly and baggy
1.0,Very Very small.
1.0,Very pretty but poor quality. Only lasted 2 months before tearing apart. Would not purchase again.
1.0,It was very bulky and the color was not correct. It felt like it was made of very cheap yarn
1.0,Looks way cuter in the pictures than it is.
1.0,"So, I love this dress but there are some flaws. The pocket on the right side is somewhat lower than they should be and the pocket on the left is at my knees.  I wasn't picky as I have a long crocheted vest that is long enough to cover them up.<br />In most cases, this would have been sent back in a snap.<br />Quality checks need to be enforced as quality to the customer should be as important, if not more important than the quantity sold. One does affect the other! I won't buy again from this seller."
1.0,After wearing for one week the zipper broke. Would like to return for even exchange.
1.0,This swimsuit definitely doesn’t have built in underwire as described!! Very disappointed.
1.0,The suit is beautiful......the  sizing is quite a bit off. I bought a 3x because other reviews said it ran small and were they right......it is about a 14/16 in American sizing.
1.0,Cheap patch that didn’t seem like it would hold up well. It was returned.
1.0,It broke after the first wear. I gave it to my neice. She was very disappointed.
1.0,"Wow, this one was a boat!  I thought I ordered a medium and it arrived with an XL label that was crossed out and labeled as a large.  I usually wear a 2-4 depending on brands, and this was extremely large.  It might look nice on someone else.  It did arrive in a timely manner, which I appreciated!"
1.0,"These are NOT compatible with my Keurig 2.0, contrary to what I read. Amazon will NOT allow me to return, even though it is stated there's a 30 day refund window. Thank goodness they weren't expensive."
1.0,Shirt is marked XXL actual size XL
1.0,I am a 38 C cup and this bra is way too small and cheap material.
1.0,"I expected this top to be the soft, slightly stretchy waffle knit material. It’s not. It’s pretty shapeless and feels like a thick top. Not flowy. Would not recommend."
1.0,Just received my bands today and the blue one is already broken and that is my favorite one. The metal piece that locks it in place came out and there is no way to get it back in.
1.0,"I don't really like this. The color is pretty - a true teal, not a turquoise. The plastic leaves, though, always look silly when I try it on with something. I think it will be better if I paint them a different color, but I have gotten around to it yet."
1.0,"These are horrible!!  You have to constantly check them because they don't stay tight.  This was our 3rd pair because we thought maybe it was our fault that the backs for our other pairs were lost, but now we know that the earrings are just crappy quality.  They are not expensive earrings, I know that, but the backs should stay on and not just turn constantly.  I wish I could get a refund for my other pairs too.  I am definitely sending this pair back!!"
1.0,tela demasiado transparente no sirve para ser un cubre boca
1.0,They don’t fit.
1.0,Does cancel out noise but it's uncomfortable and too tight
1.0,Rude to religious people who just need support and god rude 😈don’t buy I have bought it and it’s really not good or ok
1.0,"This product may be American made but I’m very disappointed in the quality! It’s too small, and too hard to clip.<br /><br />In my opinion it’s a piece of junk and I am sorry I spent my money on it!!!!!!!"
1.0,I got this belt thinking it would work and I got it it wouldn’t work and I couldn’t do the refund on it or return
1.0,I refuse to enter the review of this product as Amazon disqualified want to buy the reviews for no reason I gave the referenced item a positive review .
1.0,Do not buy very poor quality
1.0,Diappointed that the watch looses time of 36 hr period.  Great size but not happy with not being reliable.  Not happy to have to pay for a new battery to see it that's the problem.  I did not contact the seller due to not having the packaging or papers.
1.0,Ill fitting and scratchy material.
1.0,These are very thin the first time I tryed one on my finger nail  went through it to
1.0,My daughter loved it...until it fell apart a few days after we got it.
1.0,Absolutely horrible. Both strap broke within 2 days of wearing it.
1.0,DON'T BUY. Broke after ONE day. Looks great. Manufacturing Pathetic. Nothing worse than the disappointed look on a little girl's face<br />...
1.0,Terrible.  I bought two and neither son could wear them. Ran VERY small !  Too lazy to return butbwoukd NEVER buy again!
1.0,Size smaller
1.0,"very cheap material, waste of money and time. better clothes at Ross"
1.0,"Not the same color, and not the same material. Not happy"
1.0,These slippers look nice but when I first went to put them on I mistook the insole for a cardboard retainer.  The velcro hook was too far back to hook once the slipper was on.  Will return.
1.0,"The shoe itself has good quality and fits as expected. The only problem was that they didn't come with Cleat Nuts, which are the plates with threaded holes that attach the shoe to the cleats. Went to a couple of stores and they weren't sold individually (come with shoes). They can be found on amazon for 5-6 bucks but the fact that they weren't included was major inconvenience."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:d91b585a2ce11d7aff0e6325f3e78933]] Mask doesn't open it just closes on you and it was $600 I will be returning it and doesn't come in the same box as the real one I think it a knock off they are over charging my wife bought this for me i was so excited when it came now I am so disappointed if I could give a negative star I would.  Here some now>  ---🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟
1.0,Broke almost instantly wore it for maybe 24 hrs
1.0,Very low quality! Screen came off after two days! setup is a sore!
1.0,"Usually  I have room in a size small, not for these.  The small is more like an XS.  Also stitching is not great. First time I put them on the bottom stitching on both legs popped out."
1.0,Ordered four of these in 38 inch waist and they varied from 34 to 38 inches.  Only one came as marked.
1.0,Very cheap material!<br />Practically  see-through material<br />Feels like cheap Halloween material.<br />Very disappointed.
1.0,"They’re cute but when I received them, the knot wasn’t connected to the tassels. Made extremely cheaply. Obviously that’s why they’re so cheap. I wouldn’t recommend."
1.0,one of the gloves didn't work as good as the other one I need to send this one back and get a new one
1.0,"Out of two packs, two necklaces separated from the clasp sleeves.  Also, theres a ring where the clasp needs to clip on rather than a simple loop, making it difficult to clip together."
1.0,The compartment that holds the cards does not open far enough to be usable
1.0,I love this jumper.  But first wash and it's no good :(
1.0,Make are cheap and to large
1.0,These have a cheap feel.  Logos are ironed on. I own multiple Mitchell ness shorts and these are much lower quality.
1.0,Horrible material.  Goofy waistline.  Just not at all how it looks online.
1.0,Way too small for me.
1.0,I understand they are &#34;oversized&#34; but expect them to cover your whole face. I don't have a small face or large.  Consider myself heart shaped.  Haven't worn them since I purchased.
1.0,I wasn't able to wear this watch.<br />It is very large...the face of it and<br />the wrist size.<br />I'll probably give it away.<br />I don't think the description was accurate.
1.0,"I was expecting some soft leather but this one is hard. Not a good material, belt too big for the buckle."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:33605408645b409401f9f18db33047c3]] No lo recomiendo para nada no silve si lo compran perderán su dinero apenas a noche lo puse antes de dormir y hoy al Amanecer yase estaba despegado solo
1.0,"I am 10-12, got a large and there is no way I can wear these."
1.0,"Almost good enough. I knew the size would be a problem. If you have breast, don't buy this....I mean no offense. Either way the bottoms fit but both breasts were not going in this."
1.0,My piece arrived broken in multiple pieces and rhinestones had already fallen out in places.
1.0,The belt is breaking after 2 days of use
1.0,Well unfortunately since they are plastic they are not very durable.  And by &#34;not very&#34; I mean &#34;not&#34; and but &#34;not&#34; I mean they broke in my suitcase on the way to my function in the UK where I was going to wear my American cufflinks.  I think the Redcoats are coming.  So irritated that I just left them here in the UK for someone else to be disappointed in the one surviving cufflink.
1.0,Too little too short
1.0,The lenses do not block the sun.
1.0,Didn't work for me. These made my eyes strain more than without.
1.0,Beautiful piece but was delivered broken. Sadly have to return this. Not sure if I would reorder considering it’s so fragile
1.0,"Dissatisfying.  Haven’t worn yet, after prewashing in cold water and tumble dry, the blue dye bled into the white areas leaving them unwearable."
1.0,Only Received the mitten keeper. Hat clip not included
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture. Has absolutely no shape and was A LOT smaller than it should have been. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Did not hold up to even one day of wearing. The stone looks like plastic. Not worth even $3!
1.0,"This is a comfy feeling, stretchy band that I would be excited to put on my watch right away, except it didn’t come with pins! Was it supposed to come with pins? Or am I to butcher a less-liked band to Frankenstein make this work? I was so excited."
1.0,"I wear a L, but ordered an XXL based on reviews.  Unfortunately, I’d need a 4-5X or more in order to tie it correctly. I think it’s really cute, so I was excited when it arrived, it’s just not made for anyone over a size 2. If you wear an XS or or a S, you should be able to fit into an XL or XXL, but that’s about it."
1.0,I ordered a three pack but only two pieces game in the delivery
1.0,We ordered a size small but they sent us a large instead and it was really tight.  Age: 21 5’2” 140lbs.  The shoulders were a bit loose but from the cheat down it was too tight.  The sewing it just off.
1.0,Very thick fabric for this type of blouse.
1.0,"Doesn’t run true to size, I would like to return"
1.0,Very cheap quality. Broke within the first 5 min I had it on.
1.0,"Poor quality for price and the description said pants shirt tie. I did not receive the shirt! I read about the product when I received the suit and realized that the shirt was not included, had undone a more extensive research beforehand I would not have paid the price for this suit for sure!!! I was mostly interested in the suit w the cute shirt. I will be returning the cheaply made suit and just ordering the dress shirt."
1.0,"If I could give this zero stars I would.  These do absolutely nothing for glare at night,  they just make things darker.  It actually may be dangerous to wear these at night.  Extremely uncomfortable as well."
1.0,The quality is lacking compared to other face shields on the market.  The ends where it is cut is not even hemmed.  There are much better options out there for face shields.
1.0,"Was suppose to be leg compressions! Won’t even fit my arms! I’m a petite person, and I bought a large and they  don’t fix!!!"
1.0,Bought it for work to celebrate breast cancer awareness month and the pin broke after a couple days
1.0,This costume is awful. Please don’t waste your money!
1.0,"Arrived quickly, super comfortable, overall great flop—-but now completely overshadowed by the fact that the toe strap broke less than two months after receiving the $90 flip flop. Incredibly Disappointing!!!  Maybe going back to Oofas that seem to last forever."
1.0,Question if these are really made by Champion?? Poor workmanship and thin material.  Very small.
1.0,The skirt is definitely not an extra large. It’s more like a medium.
1.0,"Entirely too large AND baggy. It is not a ""loose"" fitting top. It is merely, excessively large, with no true form."
1.0,What a bummer! We got this watch to help with potty break reminders. The alarm always seemed to “snooze” instead of actually turning off so the alarm vibrated constantly. Additionally the description says it’s water resistant up to 30m but my son wore it in the shallow end of the pool and it was ruined.
1.0,Received my band and thought it was a toy. Dirty on the inner side. What should be metal is a very cheap plastic. The pins are very short and won't catch the face of the watch. It deserve no stars very cheaply made seen better at the .99 store
1.0,Didn't realize from pic it as sa high low no support can't wear it at all unless your a size 0 with no boobs
1.0,Returned them not what I wanted
1.0,"Extremely thin, loose fabric.  My daughter wore it to the pool and it held up during our visit, but it is hard to say how long that will continue.  I would recommend a much nicer option for the money instead of this one!!"
1.0,"Very cute dress, however fits much shorter in the length."
1.0,The ear muffs use a stiff wire behind the neck.  The size of the radius prevents the Muffs from fitting in the case.
1.0,Couldn’t buy one small enough. My daughter is usually a 6. The 2 was still way to large.
1.0,"These shirts are made for teenagers, not women, they are VERY small. Do not waste your money."
1.0,I ordered an extra large but it fits as a small
1.0,I bought a 3X. I normally wear an XL. I wanted to wear it so that it was extra big on me. The fabric is extremely thin. The size came out to be probably a medium. Sizing is way off.
1.0,Very short !
1.0,Changes after one wear
1.0,Is cheap and no good
1.0,"This is my second pair of earrings that I’m not satisfied, the closure does not stay closed at all. I’ve adjust numerous time. I don’t recommend buying this earring."
1.0,I am a 2X. I ordered a 2X. These were much much too small :(
1.0,It’s a great shirt just wish I would have ordered smaller.
1.0,"Beautiful watch, but does NOT keep time. I continously have to reset everytime I wear it. I am returning."
1.0,"Bent brim... nice looking and good fit. But, the brim is bent in four places."
1.0,Really crappy material that is thin as paper and way overpriced. Don't waste your money.
1.0,To big keep falling off my face
1.0,I bought this bag April 9th 2018 and it's all broken up. I have contacted the seller three times and they have not given me any response do not buy this junk
1.0,Looks cheap and nasty. Too much plastic net and not enough feathers. Very disappointing.
1.0,Very itchy and was fraying right when I pulled it out of the bag
1.0,"The color options were great, but that was it. The caps are made from cheap plastic and some of the flowers weren't glued in at a good angle so they didn't sit right in the cap. The glue was so messy that some of the flowers had glue stuck to the fabric. I didn't even realize I had ordered flowers that were glued because it's not even what I wanted so that was my fault. But even if I had intentionally ordered these specific ones I would still have been very disappointed. These are horribly made."
1.0,"Super disappointed. The dress that I received is not the one in the picture. Mine is long in the back and short in the front. It does not cross at the bottom in the front, it is straight across. It's odd for me being 5'4"". I definitely would not recommend."
1.0,Not even close to fitting based on the size it's labeled.
1.0,Horrible baby blue color. Not and all like picture. Very unflattering.
1.0,I saw tumbled stones in the picture (moonstone) and just recevied stone CHIPS.  so disappointed!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,Terrible quality and fit
1.0,It’s cute but not the side advertised. It says 2x but it’s a no go🙅🏾‍♀️
1.0,very small .nit happy with it at all .will not be buying again.
1.0,"Simply finish the seams, and cut fabric in desired shapes. Was sent with open seams and unmatching triangle tips. Fit is ok, looks like you made it yourself..."
1.0,"Most of these dresses are loose fitting, this is not ideal for women with curves. Very disappointed."
1.0,It's made of a cheap fabric very thin and see through
1.0,Stitching separated at the bottom of both back pockets.
1.0,"The material feels like the cheap, thin fabric used on a dollar store kids Halloween costume and the stitching was pulling out as soon as I tried them on. Not even worth the effort to return them."
1.0,"I ordered direct from Smith and my 'new' pair os PivLocks came with (4) lenses.  However, they only sent me pieces which fit (2) of the lenses.  I tried several times to engage Smith for my 'lifetime warranty' but they said these $0.50 part 'does not fit the lenses which came with the $200+ order (obviously).  As well, 'these nose pads 'are no longer made.'  I've now read many forums which other buyer have had the same problem and Smith does not sand behind their 'lifetime warranty.'  Functionality wise:  these work just as well as a $30 pair so save yourself the money and do not buy Smith."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:5fb570db3c8d90a1fe59dab65033ddc3]] It doesn't fit the new 2018 Mavic Air controller (model SO1A).<br />Materials looks fine. Sharp borders so expect scratches. Lanyard mechanism is handy, but the cord is cheap."
1.0,it costs way too much period.
1.0,My daughter is a little tall for her age but this still fit terrible. The cut was way too short in the front. It looks funny. So the cut is all wrong. It’s also thin.
1.0,The shirt arrived torn at the bottom.  I’ll send a picture tomorrow. Really disappointed.
1.0,Used as directed and fog still was still present on my glasses
1.0,"I come from a family with super tiny heads; yes, I also have a small head. The pressing force these headbands had on my skull was unbearable. Could not even wear it."
1.0,wasn't even close to the color I thought it would be... It was a gross yellow. and it was huge.
1.0,We never received . Instead received ugly cheap earrings . Never got the pendant in .
1.0,The dress came with a slit up the side which was neither described nor wanted. Very disappointed.
1.0,"Broke in half after a few weeks; the ""magnets"" show no magnetic force."
1.0,"I received the charm today and it is NOT Pandora, does not look like the picture and it is not<br />sterling silver.  This is false advertising and I suggest you do not purchase from this seller."
1.0,Not true to size. Disappointed. But my daughter isn't. I passed it to her.
1.0,"Poorly mad, sleeve broke off."
1.0,Very disappointed after waiting so long to get it for my granddaughter and they had a hole in it. Made for people who have skinny legs and I do mean skinny. Sending it back.
1.0,My package came empty no bracelet just an empty package
1.0,"Not what was expected, really bad termination, messy and untidy. Had to throw them out couldnt use them. Bad materials used and not suitable for wear also took way too long to arrive kept pushing the delivery date. Wouldn't purchase again."
1.0,Returned not good quility I had to fix some missing parts contacted seller didn't care to discuss my concerns I wouldn't buy feom.them. thick bulky
1.0,I ordered the 38mm/40mm and it did not fit on my 38mm watch.  It is not for a 38mm watch at all. Do not order!
1.0,this is the 2nd dress I've received with a hole in it!!!!!!
1.0,Too bog
1.0,"They are very itchy. I bought them for running. They are not quick dry, they absorb the sweat and stick to you like a cotton shirt would."
1.0,If I could give this ZERO stars I would. The pajamas are terrible quality. Super scratchy and the pants are sewn crooked. The stripes on the pants look painted on to the point when they stretch in the slightest the stripes have a cracked appearance. I would NOT recommend.
1.0,"This is either very crappy and cheaply made, or the negativity around me is hella bad cause outta of 12 in this pack only 2 survived! And Its because I glued it. Will not buy again."
1.0,The material is cheap. The pants had a hole on the side where the thread came out. The zipper ran of the track. I am so disappointed
1.0,I looked at this as soon as I received and it went back the next day.  I know this just would not stand up to any sort of wear.  Probably good for the price but not for a guy who doesn't take jewelry off at night
1.0,Cute but too small. It was a child size
1.0,I ordered 0-3 months and it probably won’t fit her for another year.
1.0,"Too small, was not an extra large"
1.0,To small for my wide hips 🤷🏾‍♀️
1.0,"It is cute (more dainty than other wallet chains), but the chain broke after exactly one month of use, so I cannot return it. Lame."
1.0,Waste of money it fell apart after a week of use.dnt buy it not worth it.very disappointed
1.0,This is so stinking thin and the top is so short. Returned immediately!
1.0,The waist band is garbage. Pockets are tiny tiny.  Drawstrung i used for tennis laces . I ordeted xxl.
1.0,"Purchased the 2XL as a gift for my nephew and the waist and length fit seemed okay at first - well he got them on - until he tried to sit down to ""lounge"" in these sleep pants.  I'm a seamstress so I recognize the cut of the material is off in the stride, hips and from waist to crotch and the material pulled across the seat and groin area. There was absolutely no give to the material and looked like the seams were about to rip apart.  No comfort with these and not what you want in  lounging sleep pants.  Pant legs were roomy but not in the seat - looked like the front and back panels were cut the same with no allowance for the back side.  They were very soft and warm so good ratings for those features but.... FIT is EVERYTHING!  Very disappointed and will be returning these."
1.0,"Unable to read because could get them to focus and was very disappointed ,love the design ,they where attractive !"
1.0,runs small!!!!!!!!
1.0,"I Ordered these shorts based on description ""Waterproof Tactical Shorts"".  Material seems to fit the description, so I likely would have been satisfied with them.  BUT, I ordered 3XL (I have a 42"" waist) based on their sizing chart, they sent 4XL and they were too small.  They immediately approved a return, BUT, return shipping is NOT prepaid!!!<br />Be AWARE,  any return is on your nickel, your mistake or theirs!"
1.0,"Poor quality!! Scratchy material, and the ""SpaceX"" paint peeled off after first time wearing. I got on sale & could have gotten a better quality one for a few $$'s more & I should of"
1.0,"The actual bar is way too small to allow the ball to screw on once it is in, so it is unwearable. I assumed the dangling part would be more life chain, but it's all one solid piece and the entire thing is very, very small."
1.0,Longest kill was a 50cal at 3600 meters or 2.25 miles in 2015 by a Canadian sniper.
1.0,Sucks!
1.0,The pants zipper was broke and the faux is really cheap looking not my style I am trying to sending them back but cannot get a code to drop off pNts
1.0,This Dress looks nothing like picture. received a different item
1.0,Only last one day.  We went to the river and in two hours broke.<br />Not strong at all.
1.0,Shrank significantly in the first wash.  Now would fit a small child.  Complete waste of money.
1.0,I did not receive a purple dress... it was pink.
1.0,Lightweight indeed.  A cardigan is a sweater...this is not a cardigan.  More like a long open front T-shirt as it is basically T-shirt material made into a supposed sweater.  Returned
1.0,"picture looks better than product, plan on returning  very disappointed"
1.0,Cheaply made and runs way small and doesn’t look anything like the photo
1.0,I bought this for my IPhone 6s and it doesn't fit its too small !
1.0,I washed it once and this happened lol
1.0,"I purchased one of these headbands in purple for $4.99 as an add-on item [ASIN:B004U9ACF0 COSMOS Purple cotton sports basketball headband / sweatband head sweat band/brace]], and liked it so much I ordered this pack of 4 - for just a little bit more money.  Warning -- the headbands in this pack of 4 are not ""Cosmos"" items (as pictured), and are thin, very cheaply made, and the material sheds.  And of course it's not worth the hassle and time and money to return such a low-priced item.  I should have known better."
1.0,This jumpsuit is garbage it has absolutely no stretch and is about five sizes less than what is on the tag
1.0,"If I could give zero stars I would.  This arrived wadded up, flaws in the &#34;straw&#34; and dirty."
1.0,I haven’t been able to put them on.  I have trouble bending over and I just couldn’t get them on.
1.0,"These pants were not what I expected, too thin and a weird cut and shape"
1.0,"These glasses are a huge rip off. The plastic feels cheap and screws were not fastened when I received them. They are a bit small. All in all, I would not recommend buying them for the price they are being sold at. They are frames you can find in the dollar store, and it's unfortunate because I really wanted to like these."
1.0,"Horribly too small. Was going to get a refund but since I would have to pay for shipping, again, to return it, NO THANKS. I will just cut my losses. This was a very poorly constructed garment, as well. Buyer beware"
1.0,Thin fabric and cheap
1.0,Broke the first time worn
1.0,Large measures what a small is listed as.
1.0,I just brought this purse and received on a Wednesday…by Saturday the zipper broke and strap popped
1.0,My grand daughter loved the shoes hadvthem a little over a month and They were falling apart
1.0,Made me look like an elephant wearing a tutu. Returned.
1.0,DONT BUY
1.0,Product does not last long. It makes a loud screeching noise when blending and does not blend well at all. Worthless!
1.0,"So disappointed. Took four weeks just to get the shirt. When it finally came, I was so upset. The logo isn’t center and not even the same print. Plus the color isn’t close to the picture. Don’t waste your money on this shirt."
1.0,"After a long wait to receive this T-shirt, it turns out that it is not like it's pictured.  It does not fit right and the material is not as pictured.  I am still trying to return it.  They don't make it easy to return, probably hoping I will keep it and not worry about getting my money back.  I was very disappointed."
1.0,Its really a cheap purse. Not worth it.
1.0,This size is for men only
1.0,returned - fit odd and was not what I thought it would be -
1.0,Can't do very much with it not long enough to tie around neck.
1.0,I dislike the fabric to my outfit and would not by it again at all.
1.0,Don't buy it wont stay on.
1.0,Not American size.
1.0,"Style is great, fabric is cheap, do not recommend"
1.0,This top should have been made for a little girl. This says One Size Womens top but it fit my 7 year old small. She wears a 7/8 in clothes and this top was small for her. I loved the print and was looking forward to wearing it and was so disappointing.
1.0,"I thought I had found a nice light weight skirt to keep the sun off of my legs.<br />Unfortunately, it's not just sheer, it's transparent."
1.0,"5’10” / 150lbs / ordered a large<br /><br />Didn’t do anything for my butt lol and the material is really weird, I felt itchy as soon as I put them on. The material also looks weird around the seam in the back, like it wasn’t lined up properly"
1.0,Dress was incredibly short. I’m 5’9” and it barely covered my butt. Pockets were up at my waist. Had to return it.
1.0,"Broke in less than a week of purchasing it. Horrible quality. Do not recommend, especially for the price."
1.0,"I'll keep it short.  VERY cheaply made.  and you can believe the other reviews, count on about 50% or less working out of the bag!  For me red and white in particular did NOT work at all, leaving some of the green and blue.  I'd recommend trying another brand."
1.0,Buckle broke off after wearing just few times. I hope I can still exchange it.
1.0,"Material is shiny and rough, very uncomfortable. Much smaller than stated size, and shrunk even more in dryer."
1.0,"Too big for my wrist, then a triangle snapped off when I was trying to adjust"
1.0,You get what you pay for! Cheap is cheap
1.0,All I’ll say is you get what you pay for. Cheap Material. Picture is very deceiving. Save you time AND your money by NOT ordering this item.
1.0,The onesie is inside out... the image is on the inside.
1.0,This chain was defective on arrival.  The lobster claw did not close at all after opening.  It was pretty and as described.
1.0,Fit very small compared to t shirts in stores. Colors were different shades of grey. Disappointing purchase
1.0,This item after taking it out of the bag you can see the size was too small it was supposed to be an extra large no way in heck was it put it back in the bag and I am returning it for a refund I’m not sure I will buy clothing through this company again I’ve also bought jeans that had to go back right size but do not fit the size it supposed to be The material looked fine the size is completely the opposite the size of this was and it did not specify on the material the size is the size was written on the bag we need to have a tag on your clothing and what size it is this was nowhere near an extra large that it was supposed to be
1.0,Not one size fits all!  It’s pretty but I’m 5’4” and 120 pounds and the sleeves are a little tight on me for a beach coverup which should be flowy. Body not one size either. This is for very small ladies.
1.0,No tag. Loose. I would have order smaller. Reviews are misleading.
1.0,Broke right away! Disappointed.
1.0,"This belt did not give a size to choose from but I tried it anyway. It was way to small, it seem's like a kid's belt. I will be returning it."
1.0,"I bought this suit for my 4 year old when she'd outgrown her tuffo suit since it was a little cheaper and had a slimmer fit. OMG worst decision ever. The first couple times she wore it, it was fine. But the last time we wore it out, mud leaked in through all the major seams and stained our merino wool base layer. My other daughter in a tuffo suit was completely dry and warm underneath. Do not save the $10, get a tuffo suit. I just ordered a new tuffo suit to replace this piece of crap. If it's a rainsuit that doesn't keep out moisture- what is the point?"
1.0,"The dress is too large whether it comes to its length or width, kind of funny when you think of it, returning it."
1.0,Kept falling down from my face
1.0,"The idea is good, but that's all. The top has too much material. It's difficult to tie, uncomfortable, and looks NOTHING like the picture as far as when it's tied it looks frumpy and doesn't fit well at all. I will be returning..."
1.0,It's that arrived was not as pictured.
1.0,"There's just something wrong with them, like they were sewn properly. It also seems like the memory foam would wear out very quickly."
1.0,"Extremely small hearts - while the necklace is pretty,  it really seems more like a child's necklace,  both in the size of the hearts and the length of the chain. Each heart is about the size of my fingernail on my pinky finger....less than a half inch. The chain is only 15&#34; long - that's a choker length. Haven't decided if I'm keeping it or not but most likely I'll be returning it."
1.0,Had to return... they look nothing like the picture
1.0,"Again, it was suppose to fit an adult , fit my 55lb. pound granddaughter just fine, ripped off again"
1.0,Sizes run about 2 sizes too large. I tried washing mine too see if I could shrink it down a bit but I don't think it helped. The sweatshirt itself is not a very good quality either for the price I paid. It's literally as if someone bought the cheapest bulk of bagged sweatshirts they could find and did a DIY iron-on transfer. I could have easily done this myself for way less cost.
1.0,Made a better night shirt! Poor quality
1.0,Poorly made and not worth the money. Will be returning.
1.0,The pictures show that the sword is suppose to fit in the sheath but I have gotten 2 swords and both didn't fit in the sheaths all the way. Its like the sheaths are not made for the swords to fit completely in them.
1.0,These are so cheaply made... Don't waste your money. I ordered few different ones and threw them in the garbage because half of them were either already broken or simply too cheap looking.
1.0,"A child’s size dress. Not for a normal to small teenager or trim women. Ripped when taking off hanger, thin material, weird size, but pretty, could not return was torn."
1.0,The chain was beautiful but the lobster clasp broke after only 1 use! Very disappointed. I hate returning things....such a hassle.
1.0,"No pride in what they sent me. I regret not making the time to return this disgrace of an item. It smelled awful, looked worn, and the fit was totally off. I'm 5'2&#34; about 107lb. I ordered the smallest size. I didn't expect or wanted a fitted item, but this was like a huge mess. If i can't sell it to someone, then i will have to see if it can be cut (doubt it....too much fabric) or just throw it out. Shame shame. Buy at your own risk."
1.0,"Pants did not make me sweat..even after washing by the instructions provided on the item, I broke out all over my body. I washed and tried again and still the same result. I bought this size as I was between sizes and it was the smaller of the 2 and nothing. Waste of money."
1.0,"I ordered this as a gift - my Mom loves garnet and has a lot of it. Well, this is NOT garnet. I don;t know what this stone is, but it's definitely not garnet. Instead of being that beautiful deep purplish dark red color that is so unique to garnet, what I received is ugly brownish. I am returning it."
1.0,"The rubber sole is not like the tennis shoe steel toed, these were more slick, if they had the same sole as tennis shoe I would or rated 5 stars"
1.0,"Not acceptable.<br />The design is one-sided and does not lay properly on the body,, and the way it's put together the rose decoration is always &#34;inside-out.&#34;<br />Not expensive, but still not worth the money."
1.0,it is not &#34;breathe&#34;.
1.0,I love this top and am so disappointed. It is very large and would be great except for the fact that the arms are super tight and anyone like me that has bigger breasts will be extremely disappointed. Definitely not made for those of us with bigger &#34;girls&#34;. 😔
1.0,"I bought these for my niece and nephew to use in the pool. Neither could wear them. They are older ages 9 &12 and they kept leaking. The 9 year old, his wouldn't suction at all."
1.0,Too small. Did not form the shape shown.
1.0,"Not as described. This skirt does not look like the photo. The amazon photo makes it appear to be a knee length skirt. It is not. If my daughter were to bend over, youd see her butt. Also this is not a ""swing skirt"". Its made out of a thin layer of stiff cotton.  No swinging going on!  The only thing right, is the pattern and color of the fabric. Besides that, this item is a bust."
1.0,I was very disappointed with this product. Very weak prongs. Would not recommend this product. I have ordered other jewelryfrom amazon and been very happy with them.
1.0,"Not real sterling silver, it changed"
1.0,This shirts zipper scratched up the back of my babies neck while it was zipped up. It is almost see through and looked very poor on.
1.0,"The watch arrived with a dead battery.  Also, the photo misrepresents the watch.  It is not as thin as shown.  It's the same thickness as similar watches, such as the Timex.  Not recommended."
1.0,not durable would not purchase again
1.0,"These are not compression at all! They are very thin see through fabric, falsely advertised and a wate of money!"
1.0,"I was thoroughly unimpressed with the lighting. The only way anything &#34;shines&#34; under the tiny LED, is in the dark. Quality construction of the box, itself, but lets face it, the selling point is the light inside. Next time, I'll build it myself."
1.0,Wore it one time. The pin fell out and was lost. No good to me now
1.0,I couldn’t even use the bag because the clasp was broke upon arrival.
1.0,I did not like this Suit straight out of the package I didn’t even bother to try it on because it ran big and I ordered a size down and it was still huge and very thin do with that information what you will
1.0,"Awful, does not work at all"
1.0,Cute but extremely short. Seems to be made for a child. I would not recommend this.
1.0,"Tried with and without the extender bit, it just does not fit properly. It's not too loose or too tight, it just does not stay up. I am spilling out of the top. Have not been able to use this product."
1.0,"These are SUCH a disappointment. If you make a living at your laptop, in fact, if you do any serious keyboard work, these are useless. Can't type at all-- the fabric may be EMF-proof, but it also prevents the touch pad from responding nine out of ten times. I had to return them."
1.0,"When I first wore this I got a lot of compliments. But after 3-4 wears those stopped because I don't wear it any more because it looks horrible - all the ""gold"" rubbed off and now it is brown-gray-bronze-dirt colored. Don't bother, too cheap."
1.0,There was a tear by the arm pit when I took it out of the bag. It's a delicate material but still disappointing
1.0,Warm but outside surface is cracking and peeling off after one week of wear :(
1.0,The product counter is sub par at best when you set it to 5 jumping jack you will end up doing 15-20 the shock dose get you up I like the sleep tracker but as seen in pic the band is made in China or something which is killer on the skin it isn’t from the shock as I wear the shocker on the underside if I was to do it again I would just spend the money on a fit bit the shocker being the only selling point not worth it just diseplin yourself to get up I don’t recommend buying
1.0,Pesados
1.0,Broke first time I tried it on
1.0,I ordered this jacket in December and was only able to wear it about 4 times before it ripped in several different areas.  It ripped along the seam in 2 areas and across the front chest part also.  I tried to return it or at least exchange it but the 30 day window has already passed.  The jacket is incredibly warm and has several different pockets which were awesome but the poor quality makes it not worth the money.  $75 is waaayyyy too much money for a jacket I could only wear 4 times.
1.0,Horribly uncomfortable. There’s a very thick seam in the toe that is balled up at the end and digs into your toes. Not at all seamless. They are also not very forgiving at the top. They leave indents and do not stretch very much. I am returning.
1.0,Very cute dress and good material. Don’t buy if you aren’t an XS though.<br />I got the XL and it wasn’t even close to size.
1.0,"The wallet is cut too small.  If you use all the pockets, it's so tight, the zipper is difficult to close.  After two weeks of use, it broke."
1.0,I wore these around the house the first time and within an hour I had runs in both of the toes. This also happened with the second pair. Not worth the money.
1.0,Broken easily
1.0,The arm is sewed shut.
1.0,I had to give it to my six-year-old niece for Christmas
1.0,Small and worthless.
1.0,This jacket is paper thin and the size is in Chinese.  Wasted my money. It looks like a jacket for a puppy dog instead of a child.
1.0,"I got this less than a month ago and was super excited when I received it. Unfortunately, when I was looking down at my hand today, I noticed that the eye had fallen off of the ring. The ring didn't even last a full month =( I do t even know where the eye fell so that I can super glue it back on. Im really disappointed."
1.0,Prices say 19 to $29 then when you tap it all of a sudden jumps up to 43 false advertisement
1.0,I don't know how they can call this a &#34;Junior&#34; size.  I don't recommend it.
1.0,"Looks good on-line.<br />I used this bag ONE time and the zipper failed.<br />No &#34;leather&#34; on the bottom, just around the edges, crappy stitching, poor workmanship all around.<br />Cheap, cheap, cheap!! I'm not happy! This bag is crap.<br />Pay $50 for a good bag.<br />I got suckered..."
1.0,I ordered a 3x for me but it's so friggin small my son who wears a US medium mens now owns it and it fits him perfect...not baggy on him at all. Very disappointed that I have to find something else for me after it took almost a month to get here. It's a beautiful and very warm outfit tho. The jacket is fur lined. Would NOT Recommend this...Unless You CAN Order 5 Sizes Bigger THAN WHAT U ACTUALLY WEAR.
1.0,After i thought this was a really nice dress a great material.... i wore it twice the second time it ripped! It was my correct size everything fit well then at a christmas party it ripped down the butt area
1.0,"Please. If you're reading this. DO NOT BUY THIS. I usually never comment on things I buy but in this case I had too. I had to warn you guys. The Fake tapers are TOO HEAVY. They will hang low. And spread your ear wholes. It will be uncomfortable, and a Waste of money. Please. Do not buy this"
1.0,This change color not 925 sterling silver
1.0,"I was extremely excited to get these earrings, so when shipping got delayed, I remained patient. It took almost 2 months! When they finally came in, they were the wrong color! I ordered black and received a very light brown pair. On top of that, what's hard to tell in the picture apparently, is the stick that's meant to go through your ear is, not only unfiled and splinter prone, but it's also tapered! I do not have gauged earlobes! I also don't like splinters in my ear lobes! pretty disappointed about this purchase."
1.0,They came apart on the second day !! Not worth it they are supper cute though. Wish she could of worked them more then once .
1.0,Apron torr as I was putting it on
1.0,Too big1  I would return it but i can't!  WASTE OF MONEY !
1.0,DO NOT BUY!!! I had this purse for only a WEEK and its already broken! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!
1.0,I ordered this item for a wedding.  It was horrible and two people could have fit in it.  I have returned it Aug.30th when it was mailed back to China and I still have not gotten my refund.
1.0,items is not like described at all. in reality my overall rating should be -5
1.0,Fake turns finger green fake fake
1.0,"This thing is so bulky and heavy. It has a post to go thru your earring hole, but the top has nothing to help hold it up! Ridiculous!"
1.0,"the elastic waistband is too small for the size of pants, but sewn in with the fabric bunched around it anyway. My legs fit fine, but even if the waist stretches - how tight and uncomfy. Super see through, costume fabric. Super cute design, Im bummed"
1.0,"Boy did this disappoint.  The material looks flimsy, looks like what they use to line garments like coats. Also this does not a label sewn in that tells you fiber content and wash instructions.  Blew my mind that people are allowed to sell this stuff. never again."
1.0,"I’m giving this a whopping 1 star for now and here’s why:<br /> The moccasins are super cute and my everything is looking and feeling great on the right side of my body. They are super cute, comfortable and fit just right. (This is what earned them the 1 star) The problem I’ve run into is that can’t wear these moccasins I was so excited about receiving, because unfortunately for me, I do not have 2 right feet.<br />Hopefully, one of two things will happen.... Either I will magically grow another right foot  in my sleep tonight. Or whoever is in charge of distributing these shoes will see this and be so kind as to send me a left one, which my left foot and I would greatly appreciate"
1.0,It is so small!!! Nothing like the picture!!!
1.0,It looks like it's for a child.
1.0,"These sunglasses were WAY too big for my 9 yr old, my 13 yr old and even too big for me!  I had to go back to make sure I hadn’t ordered the wrong thing!  I returned them and got full credit, so that was good, but do not buy these for your kids unless they’re closer to an adult size."
1.0,I ordered these mask for my son. Upon opening I saw that one of them was torn. Cheap quality.
1.0,hands match the background. hard to read time of day so useless
1.0,way too small and i have slender ankles !! disappointed
1.0,"Very nice, true to size, washes great."
1.0,"this is probably one of the worst bathing suits I've ever tried on, I bought an extra large I'm 5'8 and 150lbs, thinking that'd be enough extra size to be comfortable incase it ran small, well it runs really small, it sits weird on the chest in the middle, and the padding openings are on the bottom side of the top so they could easily show if they got even a little looser. This was a loss of money."
1.0,"Wore it for a month and it fell to pieces off my wrist at work...other wise nice bracelet, beef up your string used!!!!"
1.0,Chain broke the first day I wore it.  Very disappointed.  I had hoped that it was better quality than that.  The description certainly led you to believe it would have been nicer than that.
1.0,"I liked the coat when I first got it. Very warm, and I liked the look. However, I wore is a total 5 times before the zipper broke and now I will be returning it."
1.0,Falls off . Not very secure.
1.0,Embarrassing stitching and didn’t realize there were holes in the stitching till other people noticed.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:e0b27d46e8d7afac0bb24cbb289399ed]] Strap not sewn well
1.0,I used about 2 or three of them and they broke. They don't last lonng. It can break after wearing it a day or two.
1.0,These are not very big at all.  Very cheaply made.  I will be donating mine to a preschool.
1.0,"This dress is just a waste of your time.  I ordered a size Large.  I wear a medium but I like a bodycon style to not be so tight so I order a size up.  This dress was so small and really short to the point of being ridiculous.  I am not sure why it is getting these glowing reviews seems pretty fishy to me.  As to the length, it was extremely short it came just below my butt to cover my cheeks.  The arms were skin-tight and very uncomfortable.  Just a waste of time but thank goodness I have a free return on this cheap ugly dress.  For reference, I am 5'8 36-29-39, and 140lb."
1.0,Terrible quality... it does not fit on the ear... It was a present for my niece and she decided to keep it as a decoration in her room... But it's impossible to wear as an earring.
1.0,Worst product for 10 bucks. Not stretchable and the quality is the worst. Dont buy. Save your money
1.0,"I’ll end up having to donate these. They just weren’t so flattering, which might have still been tolerable, but then the fabric was somewhat cheap looking. Add the fact these have the elastic back, which looks thoroughly unattractive and is NOT AS PICTURED. The product photo shows it properly laid back darts and a continuous waistband that is flat.  These pants were not great for me, and I don’t recommend them."
1.0,Not cotton. Cant use for screen printing
1.0,"Dress delivered was wrong style, color, and size."
1.0,Order a xxl and it was way too small. But it looked good.
1.0,"According to the size chart XXL is 18-20. However that was a BIG lie! XXL was more like a 14 in the top. I didn't even bother with the pant. However the description says two piece, it is not! A tie separate from the top comes for you to wrap around the bottom of your shirt. Shop at your own risk!"
1.0,Product is 2 sizes to small
1.0,I really not shoulder because when I received them one were broken. I had to send them back.....
1.0,"I really wanted to love this purse, here is why:  It's lightweight, comfortable, has great pockets and tons of room.  HOWEVER this product came either sprayed or sewn with some extremely TOXIC materials.  I really wanted to keep it despite my intuition warning me to not touch it. I decided to try and air it out.  I waited 2 days. The smell diminished about 70%, but was still present.  I decided to try it anyway thinking it would go away eventually.  I immediately started itching anywhere the purse touched me and where the strap touched my neck there was a BURNING sensation!  Buyer beware if you decide to order despite reviews of a bad smell, DO NOT KEEP it if it has a pungent smell, it won't go away and it most likely will be detrimental to your health."
1.0,See through fabric. :(
1.0,I had them in my lip for two days and they started to hurt my lip so bad I had to cut the top off
1.0,Just didn't do it for me - was washed-out and just ugly.
1.0,"I got a medium, 5’2, 150 lbs.  it was the right size but it had gaps in odd places.  Upper stomach area had a ton of excess fabric, not flattering. Pockets were really noticeable and didn’t lie flat.  Really thin see through material.  Don’t waste your time."
1.0,"Very, very small! It worked for the purpose had to sew it! Didn’t have time to get anything else."
1.0,"On size chart, this should fit size 16, but looks like an extra small. Will be returning item."
1.0,Arrived damaged. Big hole in the side seam. Better quality control needed. Thin material. Too bad because it was an adequate dress otherwise. Tried to ask for a replacement but out of stock.
1.0,"Wasn't working when I got it, and the face was cracked.  Returned it."
1.0,When I purchase it was a PAIR. How it’s only one shoe. What the heck.
1.0,"This purse was way smaller than expected. It was cute, just not big enough for me. I should’ve really paid attention to the measurements!"
1.0,I bought two and they both fell apart I am very disappointed.
1.0,It’s at least 2-3 sizes smaller than the usual so beware.
1.0,This “dress” is more of a thin and sparkly bath robe. It is not flattering at all. It is also very uncomfortable on the skin. Returned immediately!
1.0,Cheap China garbage.  Don't waste your money.  I paid to ship it back... probably won't ever get my refund.
1.0,"Unfortunately, this was a disappointing purchase. My daughter loves anime, and when she received the hoodie I could tell by her face, it wasn't as exciting as it should be. Apparently the characters aren't in ""their style"", some of the clothing is wrong. She wore it anyways, only to find out the decal started peeling off after just a few washes, and that's gentle cycle. So my advice is don't buy. Save your money and look elsewhere."
1.0,Horrible quality. Already falling apart after 4 uses.
1.0,I returned these capris.  They were much too thin and very cheaply made
1.0,To big don't really like  thought it was smaller!!!!!!
1.0,"This looks and I believe advertised as a baby hat, but this was huge for like a 1 yr old or older. I never used this. The top is really long too and my kido didn’t like it and would throw if off.<br />Read the sizing..."
1.0,"Material does not breathe, shirts run small, would not be able to dry in the drier. Also shipping took forever. I am an Amazon prime customer and took almost two weeks to arrive even thought it was listed as a prime item. I would not recommend these shirts"
1.0,"I would have liked to have given this pendant no stars.<br />The graphics were terrible - do not purchase!<br />In person, I could not make out the graphics."
1.0,It's not very good.  I have had 4-5 of these over the years.  This one is very poor.  It's hard to get the button in and too firm.
1.0,"I guess it looks sorta like the pic, but as the previous reviewers mentioned, the pattern is a cheap iron on. If I had time to return it, I would but unfortunately I need it for an event tomorrow. This item and this seller are a major disappointment!"
1.0,When received the product was damaged
1.0,"I ordered this dress because it was described as assymetrical. The dress is received is NOTHING like the picture. I figure it will cost more to send it back than what I actually paid for it, so I'll just keep it to sleep in. Overall, I am EXTREMELY unhappy with this purchase."
1.0,Took big
1.0,CHEAP !
1.0,"For over $30, this is flimsy and the horn is literally facing the wrong direction."
1.0,RETURNED THIS PRODUCT AS IT IS NOT 100% COTTON AS ADVERTISED
1.0,It was black when I received this item
1.0,The first watch appeared to have a dead battery.  The replacement arrived similarly.  I won't try another from this manufacturer.
1.0,Doesn’t fit. I tried it on and the band is way too large...<br /><br />I wanted to like this and am really disappointed
1.0,Speedy delivery and a lovely product! However the left side of the necklace has been bent/dented. The smaller circles have gems missing and I’m also missing a clasp on the right side of the necklace shown in picture. I love the style of it but didn’t expect it to arrive damaged. Plan to wear it on Monday coming up (2 days away) but most likely won’t now. Wish I could contact the seller to get these issues rectified however doesn’t seem to be a way to 🤷🏽‍♀️
1.0,I was so excited for this purchase the shoes looked so cute in the picture but was such a disappointment when receiving them. The quality is bad and i don’t know if they were used but they were creased. One shoe is even stitched uneven in the bag they are badly made! I say save your money! Avoid this purchase.
1.0,Really pretty but it broke the first time I used it so I had to return. It adjust easily but leaves very long dangling chain. I usually wear a 7” bracelet
1.0,Plastic horrable don't buy
1.0,This thing is like 2 inches long
1.0,Not well made. Not the color I ordered. And it included some hideous pink striped garment I never ordered.
1.0,Arrived broken. Cat attack the wrist strap to the purse. My daughter was very disappointed.
1.0,The sewing was horrible. Nothing was sewed to the right place
1.0,the ring was broken when I got it! would like my money back!
1.0,Ordered this dress and the color was completly off. It was a lighter color.
1.0,Horrible is way to big for a girls face.
1.0,Great style and look but after first wash all the buttons fell off
1.0,"None of the Angel were matching impossible to make a pair of earrings.  I will never buy from this company again.  Already, showed and talked to all my bead friends."
1.0,they aren't really mirrored
1.0,"cheap construction, poor manufacturing tolerances.  not compatible with other snap-lock keyrings, even from the same package.  i'd give zero stars if Amazon would let me."
1.0,"It just wasn't what it looked like, dissappinted"
1.0,Broke on first wear
1.0,"These fit very small - they are not even comfortable for me (5'7 female) let alone my husband.<br />The chemical/plastic smell is almost unbearable.<br />I bought these because they were the cheapest multi-pack version, but they ended up being a waste of money because I only used a few and then abandoned these."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:f84c6e45e27841950a2af87b750f08d9]] I am disappointed this is the second pair that has ripped on my daughter she is not hard on her socks. She wears them inside a brace and doesn’t wear them alone on the ground or outside. They were always hand washed but after purchasing in June we are now September and a hole has appeared by her calf. Unfortunately the return window closed after a month of purchasing and I am stuck with an expensive pair of socks for my 3 year old that will continue to tear until we will no longer able to use. If these are made for AFO braces I would expect they can withstand AFO use.
1.0,"I thought this watch is good, as I reviewing the comments, but after I got it, it wasn't good as I was expecting it, it is slow for about an hour every day and I have to rewind it every time I compared with my smart phone's digital watch.  O decide to return it as quickly as I can. Not really recommended:("
1.0,"I received a defective shirt. One of the sleeves was rough-cut and not hemmed. When I contacted the seller, they said they will send a replacement which never arrived. Total waste of money."
1.0,"Instead of a pair, I got a set of three earring, and they were all bent and unusable."
1.0,Its way to big. Im 5'6 150 lbs & its baggy. Looks like a wrinkled thin cheap shirt. Im returning now
1.0,"IT WAS ADORBLE WHEN I TOOK IT OUT OF THE PACKAGE, BUT I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO PUT IT ON MY BABY BECAUSE WHEN I WASHED IT, ALL OF THE KNITTING CAME UNDONE.:("
1.0,"Don't buy it,  its cardboard literally.  Very upsetting"
1.0,"Not happy with this purchase. The first one I received, had a bar of lights that didn't light up. The second one I received worked for two weeks and the lights no longer work. I wouldn't call this expensive, but I wouldn't call it cheap either for the quality I received. Not happy. Steer away from this one folks."
1.0,"1 - Different design from the picture. In the pictures it looks plain, but in reality it has designs and grooves.<br />2- The design of the two pieces of strap doesn't match each other.<br />3 -  I expected to have that screw driver that changes the strap with the order since the picture was posted, but nothing came except the strap.<br /><br />Extremely unsatisfied"
1.0,"Shrinks in the wash and seam came undone on one of the boxers after the first wash. I thought the material was a bit thin, but figured I'd give it a try. Upon closer inspection after the wash all the boxers seemed to have some really shoddy stitching. Boyfriend instantly rejected them and wouldn't even try them. Crappy customer service. Seller wanted me to write a false positive review before they would issue me a refund. Luckily the product is covered by Prime, so Amazon processed the return."
1.0,The size was not even close to being correct
1.0,Was cute but the small was huge
1.0,The strap came apart too easy. fall off my shoulder several time
1.0,This nose ring is terrible<br />I was afraid to put it in my nose. The stones are so sharp and catch on everything. I was afraid it was going to stick in my mask. Total garbage.
1.0,Very small and has no stretch like most leggings
1.0,"I purchased this tank in two different colors, and on both, the fabric where the strap meets the top of the tank ripped in the very first wash!  They also run very small. I got one size up from my usual based on other reviews here, and they were still so tight that I wouldn't wear them (assuming they were still intact) except as a layer under something else."
1.0,"I purchased this in the next size up, I wear a large in clothing and I bought the XL size, this thing would not fit past my head let alone my chest. I do not know how the rest of the people fit it past their chest but the company does send you an extra free waist trainer if you write a positive review. I returned the item for a full refund."
1.0,Awkward earring.  No matter where it’s placed it just looks strange.
1.0,Does not look like the picture at all. My blind grandmother could knit a better sweater  Fits short in the arms (and I'm 5'4&#34;) the front looks NOTHING like the picture.  Waste of money.
1.0,"I received a large in the SONJA BETRO Women's Chambray Pull-on Wideleg Crop Pants.  I liked the picture.  I looked nothing like the picture.  I looked liked my 83 year old grandmother. (I love you Grandma!)  I'm in my mid-30s.  In addition, the large was still too small and I wear a size 8-10.  Way too small around my hips, so across my backside and crotch it was super tight.  It just looked old lady ridiculous.  I did like how super light weight it was and the fact that it was an elastic band, but none of those features are helpful if the item poorly fits (both in style and dimensions).  I would not even wear these as my ""knockaround"" pants (A phrase my Great Grandmother used). Nope, No, Nope!"
1.0,"El suéter blanco está manchado, que abuso"
1.0,"I give the look of the shoes 5 stars, and a 1 star for the shoes I received. The smell of rubber/chemicals was so strong making it impossible to wear.  I tried airing them out with no luck. Returned."
1.0,"way too feminine for my taste, but that’s just me. had to return them"
1.0,Material is very very thin. They are unlikely to last more than a few washes.
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture and the bottom is not loose. It's very restricting actually and the material sucks. I definitely would not recommend wasting your money. I'm sending mine back.
1.0,"These look funny on my face. The model looks great in them, but in person... They are odd shaped, and a like smaller than hers look."
1.0,I though I ordered a medium.. but it looks like it is xsmall size... It doesn't fit me at all
1.0,Zipper pull broke after a month.
1.0,Bought one for me and one for my daughter. I bought a size up in each. Hers was WAY too small.
1.0,"These glasses are advertised as Oversized and Polarized. I am telling you, they are neither oversized nor polarized. They are just normal size regular glasses. I do like the fact that they are not too dark and they are stylish, but they are neither oversized nor polarized. If you are truly looking for polarized and oversized glasses, please keep looking, these are not for you, unless you have a very small face."
1.0,I would actually give this product zero stars. My face is a mess! It's peeling burning and blistering. All this after 4 days of use.  I am returning the product and strongly adciwr not to purchase this based on the amount of reviews. It is awful.
1.0,Got the biggest size and it dont fit. It should say if its for thick or plus size or petite ladies
1.0,I used these for a week (splitting wood and cutting brush) and then the stitching split.
1.0,Do not buy this. Cheap made and they are HUGE hair sticks to it and it’s no where near water resistant.
1.0,Need to buy 3 sizes larger
1.0,These are<br />So pretty and look good on as well.  But I just got them and one of the lenses is loose and I’m sure these won’t last long. It’s a bummer because they really are so cute and the fit is nice too. Thinking about returning since it’s only a matter of time until the lens falls out.
1.0,The pants rip in seam the first wear. After seeing the seam rip on the second wear another spot rip. He quickly got a hole in the knee and another in the shirt. He shirt got grabbed and he has a giant hole in it now. The screen print is also coming off after only 3 washes. Very disappointed because my kid loves dressing up.
1.0,"Very cheap, broke within 24 hours."
1.0,WAY too small
1.0,I thought It was a softer faux leather but it feels like plastic...my bad choice.
1.0,"This fell apart as soon as I out it on, cheap cheap cheap save your money"
1.0,Dont spend your money
1.0,"The robe was very long and fitted too large.  However, that was not the real issue.  The quality was dreadful, it almost looked as though it was a used garment, pilled and in some areas the material was almost bare.  I had bought this item as a present for my Mother-in-law, it arrived wrapped in plastic so I did not investigate it too closely.  I was horribly embarrassed when I realized the quality was so poor.  DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM."
1.0,Fabric is very thin and see thru. Bought them as bridesmaid dresses and my bridesmaids refused to wear them because they felt too exposed
1.0,Bad quality. Only a month of use and the lock already broke
1.0,the buckles were missing. very cheep looking
1.0,"I'm 5'6"" and 135lbs, athletic built and usually a small is great for me. I have to return this jacket because it's soooo big, it looks sloppy. I wish they had an XS.<br /><br />The jacket is heavier in weight, which is great and keep in mind it is an Ivory color NOT white. Other than the fit I  like and would have kept the jacket."
1.0,Broke after only 2 months of use
1.0,"This necklace is long, heavy, bulky and just plain old ugly"
1.0,This necklace came on a plain cardboard. It didn't have the cute saying or anything. So the meaning of the necklace was pointless.
1.0,"Used once, broke and lost."

1.0,My wife started the to wear the necklace and the silver metal started to rub off after a couple days of usage and the rings stone never changed mood color
1.0,It seem to be good sunglasses but they are much bigger than anticipated. My nose is too flat to keep the sunglasses on my face. It's tends to fall offs my face. The polarized seem to be great but I had to go back to my old glasses to be comfortable to drive with it and not feel awkward.  Great fancy glasses but doesn't fit my dimension of my face.
1.0,I'm 5'3 and this &#34;dress&#34; barely covered my backside!<br />It was too flared to be used as a top so I had to return it.
1.0,cheap ear fell off wearing it once
1.0,"So not only was it so small, the original tag was cut off so it probably was pre-owned. Too much time has elapsed to return it, so that's on me"
1.0,"This dress was extremely thin and see through. The material is not even close to what the picture shows. It’s not made well at all. I would not recommend this dress to anyone unless you are looking for something to throw on to wear around your house. Complete deception, save your money and buy something else."

1.0,Extremely small. Not what I was expecting.

1.0,"The carryon completely fell apart on only its second use in the airport. While going through customs and having to unzip and then zip back up the bag, the zipper broke! A friend and an airline worker tried to help me get it back on track, but it was hopeless. Had to get tape to keep it closed on the flight home. Total waste of money & a HUGE headache in the airport."

1.0,Not as described. Came as a crop top.
1.0,No not as described ! To big !
1.0,"Nothing about this shirt is what I expected. The points of the collar (which are so cute in the picture) wouldn't 'line up' once I had it on.  The fabric is thin enough to be see through and crinkly, and the pink is too pink. It's definitely being returned as I would never wear it."
1.0,Hard to take off.
1.0,Sent back it was too big
1.0,"These bras are very small and very uncomfortable. Don't get them. I usually wear 3x in this type of bra, and it was way too small. I didn't take the time to send them back, but I ordered some more genie bras and will be going back to those."
1.0,"After about 6 songs the battery started running out of juice and it sounded terrible. There are only 2 small lights on the tie, which was disappointing."
1.0,The item is Asian size so they run very small.

1.0,Poor quality. Color looks faded and washed out☹️
1.0,Update.<br />I had high hopes but after handwashing and hang drying it. I noticed a hole next to her arm. I ordered this outfit instead of others in hopes she would be able to wear it again. But she only for wear it four a couple hours for a photo then I had to change her do to the hole. It also looks cuter online. Might be because I have a chucky baby but she didn’t look comfortable or proportionate with the skirt on<br /><br />I ordered this 6 to 12 for my baby girl who is just now in 6 to 9 month clothing and this fits perfectly it’s a gorgeous color my only thing is if you look closely around the feathers it is kind of like a yellowish tint it’s not actually white which is kind of disappointing but still really cute
1.0,"I bought this for my son, after a very long research, when it came he tried it on and it fit very nicely and decided to keep it. I then washed it in a very gentle wash to get rid of all dyes and dust particles, this jacket came out very stiff like a piece of cardboard, most of the black dye ran off, now there are streaks. It is not useable. The fabric used to make this jacket was not tested for regular usage..and if it was tested, the results were ignored to make a quick buck."
1.0,The picture is not what the jeans were i was very disappointed. I so wanted these but nothing as advertised. Not even close to size and picture.
1.0,Bought this leotard for my daughter's irish dance competitions but will have to return them due to the sleeves are more like 3/4 sleeves(or even shorter) and not long sleeves. It does run very small. It is probably 2 sizes too small but I did buy it larger size seems how I had read reviews prior to purchasing which stated that it ran small. If you are needing a leotard that has sleeves that go to the wrist then this is not for you.
1.0,This bodysuit looks really cute on but I wore it to dinner and the strap broke in an hour and a half.  The straps are very thin and not secured well.  Really disappointed. Waste of money.
1.0,My grandson said it fit like bike shorts! Not good!
1.0,"Am right now wearing a size 6 short Amanda jean . . . fits perfectly.  Checked other Amanda size 6 short jeans in my closet: same wonderful fit.<br />Based on size chart, bought a 8 petite (short no where to be found in right color).  Color ,,, perfect,  Length,,, great.  But it hugs my curves way too much.  NOT CLASSY and would not dare go in town with these on.  Either cut or fabric (or both) changed for the worse."
1.0,Horrible material and 2 sizes too small
1.0,Did I miss reading sizing. This was not meant for an average woman but a little girl. So disappointed. Hope I can return it.

1.0,"Terrible fit, i dont understand this is the 3rd time ive ordered the brand . Felt like the grinch with 3 inches of toe room flopping ."
1.0,Cute and comfortable. Very soft.... however the seam came completely out of the 1sr mask the 3rd day it was worn (never even washed)
1.0,I gave it 1 star because I had to give it something!!!  I ordered a large which was the correct size for a women's 12 - 14. This dress looks like a toddler dress for a 6 yr old!!!
1.0,Looks like I’m wearing a bedsheet!
1.0,The dress doesn't look like the picture at all<br />The material is very cheap<br />It looks like a laungry
1.0,"As others have mentioned, these shoes run small. I usually wear a 5-5.5 and was happy I ordered a size 6. I wasn’t impressed with the shoes however and am planning to return them. I’ve had a difficult time finding shoes for hiking as I hate a bulky feel. These shoes reminded me of skater shoes rather than hiking boots, and just weren’t for me. The hunt continues unfortunately."
1.0,Fell apart within a few days. My daughter prob wore these shoes for maybe a total of an hr in each day and it started to fall apart on day 5.
1.0,"I ordered this product in the size 00. What I received is significantly smaller, photo next to actual 00 to scale. I can't wear these and it's disappointing."
1.0,Sent me wrong size and the regular blue are nothing like the pictures. Dont get regular blue. Weird color of blue. Closer to baby blue.
1.0,I absolutely loved this product until I put them on my little one. One shoe didn't flash with the lights and one did. Total disappointment

1.0,Not only tighter than expected but also too short!
1.0,Terrible earrings. Don’t waste your money.!!!
1.0,"Took 2 months to receive. Once I tried it on it didn't fit me perfectly at all. The top portion is the only thing that I'm ok with. I'm 5'6 150lbs I got a large because I have a long torso. Also, usually the fabric shrinks coming from China. The color was a baby powder blue and the fabric was more of a crushed than a straight. I would return it but it's not worth the hassle. Lesson learned. Go find a better dress."
1.0,"I can see right through it... would be fine to wear something under and over, so i guess winter time it is"
1.0,I love Black Hills Gold jewelry. I order this as a gift. I am very dissatisfied with it. The cross is so small. Chain too thin. Got it for a gift. By the time I her birthday. Past the 30 days can not return.

1.0,Not sure what this random stitch is but it’s uneven and ugly!

1.0,The band doesn't fit.
1.0,Metal broke on the first attempt to connect it with frame. Returned it.
1.0,The top of the dress was to big and I got extra small. The material was to see through. I couldn’t even take a photo because the top was literally falling. I don’t recommend buying.
1.0,Don't buy. Waste of money. Was broken when I got it. Kept getting stuck on the 12 then watch would be the wrong time.
1.0,"Someone didn't think about the way they printed these... Half of the skulls HAVE to be upside down.  They cold have easily printed them going the other way on the back so you could twist hem into submission, but no.  Notice how they don's have any pictures of them on actual shoes??? Ordered the Black & White ones too, but these ones were even worse.  The printing actually ran off the side on one of them. And they wanted me to pay return shipping."
1.0,"I was contacted by this company and offered a free bracelet for an honest review. So here:<br /><br />Unless you just want a very plain, brushed metal bracelet to wear, don't waste your money. I've wore this bracelet constantly since it arrived. The manufacturer touts all kinds of pain relief. Didn't happen, and I have vast experience with pain. I have gout, arthritis, bone spurs and fractures in both my feet, herniated discs in my neck and my back, along with a whole host of other maladies.<br /><br />So I put the bracelet on with an open mind. It's smooth and slim~~non-intrusive. Since there were no instructions with the item, I went online and searched for similar bracelets and read their instructions, since I couldn't seem to access this company's site. I made sure the bracelet was fitted to my wrist. I wore it for two weeks. The results?<br /><br />Well, the good was that it did not turn my arm green or cause me to break out in a rash.<br /><br />The bad?<br /><br />It didn't do anything else. No pain relief, no sudden feeling of well-being (well, except for when I realized I didn't pay a dime of it~~then I felt pretty skippy), no anything.<br /><br />So please, as I told you in the beginning of this, if you're hoping for pain relief, see a doctor, an acupuncturist, a chiropractor, or a shrink. Lose a few pounds. Take a walk. Meditate.<br /><br />I wish I had better news; I really do."
1.0,"Very nice looking sweater, ordered an XXL and it was to tight."

1.0,Was excited to get this ring cause me and husband picked out cause we loved what we seen and when I got it in we were soo disappointed cause u can’t even see the word love on it... the size fits perfect and I love the color but the writing u can’t see it at all.. u can see how the top of the word didn’t take very well

1.0,The logo was poorly cut out by hand and you could see some of the lines of the stencil on bits and it’s sorta half assed stuck on there with edges up and frayed and everything. I just tossed it when I got it tbh
1.0,Worked for about 2 months and stoped working. Bought 2 of them and both the same.<br />Would not recommend to anyone
1.0,"I never write reviews, but what a waste of time.  I tried this thing in many different positions on my head and under my chin.  I tried it extremely tight to loose.  Absolutely nothing stopped my mouth from opening right up and snoring.  DO NOT waste your money."
1.0,"Contrary to the manufacturer/seller’s statement, these are NOT “High Quality Firm and Strong key chains”.  One of the ferrules on each of the key chains I received was only loosely attached to the wire. I’ve experienced a 100% separation failure of each key chain within only two days of use. Although this is most likely a short term manufacturing defect, pending correction by the manufacturer/seller, these must be considered as currently unreliable poor quality devices. As of now, DO NOT DEPEND on these key chains to stay intact unless you EXPECT TO LOSE your keys or whatever else you’ve attached to these defective key chains.  I encourage the manufacturer/seller to look into this problem and notify buyers if and when the problem is resolved."
1.0,"Advertised as 9-mm inner diameter, but the inner diameter is actually 6-7 mm. Also, they arrived extremely tarnished and dark grey."
1.0,Wore them once snowboarding and they ripped in the crotch almost immediately. By the end of the day my left leg was visible from knee to nut.
1.0,When wearing them the crystals face down and you keep having to adjust them.

1.0,Material feels too cheap to use for myself. Will ether re-gift to a kid or return - haven't decided.
1.0,So when I first received this ring I was super excited it's absolutely gorgeous. But two things that I'm not happy about. One the size is wrong I ordered a size 6 the ring is definitely not a size 6 it's too big and two definitely not sterling silver. My finger has broken out in a rash since I've worn it and I have many sterling silver pieces and none have ever caused me to break out. I'm not satisfied although the ring is beautiful it's not what I expected to receive when I placed the order.

1.0,Awful!!  They look better in photo!!
1.0,It ripped pretty quickly..
1.0,I received these sneakers  and was surprised  they was without a box. That's why lost their form.  Don't waste your time and money.<br />They fit somewhat small.
1.0,These are so cute but the material is way to sheer! I bought these to wear on vacation but I wont be comfortable knowing you can see right through them and wearing the same color underwear wont do. Disappointed

1.0,the dress was in my opion cheaply made and the material had major flaws.
1.0,Nice looking shades.  Shades had a ripple or wave in lenses. Stem broke a week after purchase. Pretty cheap produce for cheap money.
1.0,These leak immediately worst swim googles ever. Waste of money.
1.0,Blue ones were extremely small and the gray ones were the correct size. Why would they put 2 diffrent sizes in the same back I'm not sure. But I paid for 4 and can only use 2
1.0,I wore these to my son’s peewee football game. Went to the bathroom BEFORE HALFTIME and looked in the mirror to see one of the footballs was missing! I had only worn them MAYBE 30 minutes at this point. To say I’m disappointed is a major understatement. Won’t buy from this company again.

1.0,"The headband came broken and I could have returned it, but didn’t have enough time to ensure it would arrive by Halloween."
1.0,The fabric for this dress is like a vinyl tablecloth.
1.0,Hard to size...the tool that was provided broke.  Now I have to wait for a jewelry store to open to have it sized
1.0,"I was absolutely shocked to see the awful quality of this mask. It’s made of cloth and such, but made extremely poorly. Would not recommend purchasing."
1.0,I have tiny wrists. Finding a band to fit is a pain. Makes it even harder when the product info is not correct. This doesn’t go as tight as advertised. Maybe 5.6-5.7

1.0,Is really not well made
1.0,This necklace is nice but the pendant is HUGE it looks kind of ridiculous when you wear it

1.0,Fabric is stretchy but I ordered two sizes up and still fits tight

It failed to lock tight in place couple of times for the past 3 weeks when she wearing them, falls off by itself one time in our bedroom, luckily we found it.  But it failed to stay locked again yesterday when we were outside our house, and one ear ring went missing!! I can believe I’ve paid over $200 and now got a totally useless one ear ring left!!"
1.0,Lots of scratches on front of goggles. View not clear
1.0,receive 1 instead 2
1.0,this belt seems like it is vinyl although claiming to be real leather. It is split and cracked already.
1.0,"These are not over the belly button. I ordered expecting a high rise, but got something in a weird height under the bellybutton… not flattering at all because it cuts my shape in a bad place."
1.0,Not at all as pictured! Has a seam across the chest; runs small and VERY long!
1.0,No absorbency at all!
1.0,"These caused a rash all over my chin, and then made my face break out for days after I wore one. They come poorly packaged, and Amazon will not provide a return label for returning at Kohls. Horrible purchase and experience. I cancelled my Amazon membership after this purchase because they do not take responsibility for defective items sold on Amazon."
1.0,Much thinner than I thought.  Of no use.  Wasted money
1.0,"ear frames arrived bent, one had broken nose pad. Don't<br />waste your time or money."

1.0,It didn't even come with a skirt??????
1.0,Terrible quality- threads were unraveling when I opened the package - returned right away
1.0,Ordered the 3X because I prefer it a little bit loose fitting. It was still way to tight couldn't button it and the fabric is very cheap. Nothing like the picture. Will be returning.
1.0,All the stitching fell out immediately after the return window. Incredibly disappointed. Was only washed on gentle cool cycle and hung dry.
1.0,It is not breathable. It traps heat. I would hate to workout in it. Fabric is a low quality. I won't ever wear.
1.0,"I'm 5' 4"" 150+lbs, got the XL Because I have a butt. These are NOT made for curves! They go high in front and fall down in back. I had to pull them all up inside myself to make them go over my butt ugh. The front rolled down, super uncomfortable when I sat down. Almost like I had them on backwards. I was hoping to wear them under sundresses thinking they had more coverage than regular underwear. If anything they had less! The material is comfy, the fit is horrible"
1.0,This product completely faded in one wash. The quality is not good at all!
1.0,"Very low quality. Arrived balled up in a small bag, creasing the hat and bull."
1.0,"The fingers were too long. Poorly made. The gloves had a couple of holes in them. You get what you pay for. They were only $5 including shipping. Good for house cleaning or for costume purposes, not for wearing to a tea party."
1.0,This dress has NO room i the boobs and I'm below average for a girl my size. Had to throw it away.
1.0,These would be super cute if the quality wasn’t so bad. Two earrings and one is completely different than the other. Color is different and size is different. Doesn’t even look like a matching pair.
1.0,It turned brown after short time
1.0,My shirt shrunk in warm wash poor quality
1.0,I’m sending these ear rings back because they are so tiny it’s hard to hold them in my fingers. I allowed the advertisement picture to impress them being bigger so it’s my own fault for not realizing how tiny they would actually be. Being 14k gold Was my main goal but they’re just tooooo tiny to keep. I’ve learned my lesson
1.0,Broke apart within days. Though it’s very nice it wasn’t worth it.
1.0,Broke after 4 days. Cheaply make.
1.0,"Super cute, simple, and comfortable dress. However, mine has a line that goes right down the front and it is very noticeable. It almost looks like something was spilled down the front. I tried washing it, but no luck :("
1.0,Didn't like it the thing arrived all right looked good they wore it and the whole thing just fell apart .
1.0,"The pattern, fabric and cut are different than advertised.  I ordered the blue, patterned one (bohemian style pattern). The print was not the same as the print in ad.  The difference is not in the color but the actual print designs are different than advertised.  The fabric is not the same as shown.  The fabric that my dress has a white underside that shows when you walk (when the slit opens).  The dress advertised has rounded corners at the hem.  The dress I was sent has blunt, square corners.<br />This product is nothing like what is advertised."
1.0,I bought a 3-6 month and it fit more like 9 month! I didn’t like it because it was so big and made my daughter look silly because she was drowning in her outfit. I was super excited for it too and then it made me very disappointed.
1.0,It looked nothing like the picture
1.0,It is to big for any of my shoes. I think the one I got was for men’s shoes
1.0,Junk. Winding mechanism was stripped the second time I wound it.
1.0,They are hard to use. The BLACK I ordered are BLUE.<br />Don’t bother!
1.0,These was nothing like I thought they would be. I hate the material their made of.
1.0,"it was looking like a funeral dress, unhappy"
1.0,Wrong size and wrong color
1.0,The wide calf ....seems not to be true. My calves do not fit in this boot.... most have 16.5 inch calf and mine is a bit bigger. These boots look like the larger calf could fit but it didn't work for me.
1.0,Once I put my earring in the actual protector cracked open without me realizing it so I had a reaction to some earrings anyways. It was also very thick so it hurt to put in my ears.
1.0,The earrings arrived broken.
1.0,Nunca las compre
1.0,the shirt arrived glue to itself and dirty!!! I couldn't even open it!<br />Let the pictures speaks for themselves
1.0,"Its the worst, the material is thin and cheap, its nothing like the photo.  I am very disappointed."
1.0,Could have got better value going to the River myself waste of money
1.0,awful. The gems ALL fell out within a week.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:47e14bbb6bdedf1fd740c552f84508e1]] This belt is not the proper size as listed. I measured my child for the XL size and the belt is actually a Medium when you measure the inches. The belt has absolutely no imprint, nor tags signifying the size either. I wonder if the seller grabs whatever belt that comes out and throws it in a shipping box."
1.0,"After one wash, they shrunk way too small unlike the others I bought"
1.0,This is at least two full sizes too small for me and I ordered it a full size larger.
1.0,Eye holes are pointless and the hair detached from the mask as soon as I removed it from the box. Not worth the money at all.
1.0,"I loved this dress and got so many compliments the first time I wore it! I followed the washing instructions and the magenta at the bottom of my dress bled into the white section,  its ruined after 1 use,  don't waste your  money,  so disappointed because it was comfortable and cute,  :("
1.0,I sent these as a gift to my aunt. She got the box. She got a little pouch on the inside. She DID NOT get the earrings.  Poor customer service. Stay away! I am disappointed. Rip off!!!!!
1.0,Ordered these and only got two. Disappointed
1.0,Very thin material!!! (Pretty Much See-through)
1.0,"It’s described as 100% cotton, but it is polyester. The picture on the back is blurry and feels very cheap (like an iron on). Very disappointed in this purchase and will be returning."
1.0,"When these sneakers first came in I thought they looked bulky and wide even though I did not order wide. They looked funny on my kid. They were so wide in a weird way. Also after just 3 months of wearing, I am buying new sneakers. Not this brand! For $30 I can get much better and well constructed shoes."
1.0,"Very nice packing, but the ring is dry and brittle. The moment I put it on my finger, it crackled and there are cracks in the ring's outer printed surface."
1.0,Item was extremely smaller than expected I feel like I wasted my money and I did not get a refund
1.0,"I never used it once, after a month  in its bag it when completely black as if made of poor quality"
1.0,Sharp necklace at a great price but it broke after wearing it twice.  My husband fixed it - but this quality is very cheap.
1.0,"(Update april 6.  The right shoe stopped working less than 2 months wear...not worth my purchase.  Prior comments when it worked- Bought silver for more outfit matches The coolest brightest shoes you ever seen in your life. We literally ,quite literally. have slowed passing cars down . Lights up a sidewalk even comes with a remote! Plugs into your wall like a phone charger. All types of color sequences its totally sick!  Huge attention getter So Be prepared for it.Did suggest not using lights in class and teacher said only at recess. However i think not at school at all is best . They command that much attention and comments from all .  Great for on the town!"
1.0,Ordered the set of three pairs but only received one!
1.0,"Terrible goggles, did not stay fastened, just terribly made. Will not purchase from this manufacturer again."
1.0,"UGH the bathing suit struggle...<br /><br />I am 24yo, 5'4&#34;, 125 lbs, average build. I bought a medium. I do have a bit of a booty, but these are cheeky.. so my butt hung out like everything else... I am a 34B (ish) and the top looked like it would fit.. HOWEVER the clasp in the back was broken. so I tied it together and threw it over my head. The pads were cheap and didn't stay in place and the top didn't conform to my body and my chest slipped out multiple times. I'm surprised there was no way to adjust or tighten (luckily it was just me in a swimming hole)... I really wanted to like this but the search is still on."
1.0,The material is thin and feels like cheap material and there is no stretch to it so it will be tight and stiff
1.0,Smiley face adhesive cheap started lifting within one month of light use would not buy again
1.0,Terrible product these must be for children bc I can hardly get the damn thing over my head.
1.0,I dont like this watch .. when i dont use it i have to reset the time... all the time....
1.0,Their 3X size will fit a woman size 8.  Ridiculous
1.0,So it says my product is still on its way but yet I received it.  Not actually though. It wasn’t a camera it was a  cassette tape ... Which was the cheapest thing.  Some of the reviews said it was cheap but it was a lot cheaper than I expected...  Just pay more if you want a cute camera keychain.
1.0,"too small, gave them away."
1.0,"I wore it to a zoo today with my ID, debit card, and zoo pass in it. Broke after 4 hours of wearing. The leather ripped where the clamp goes. Can't be worn now."
1.0,The neck was wayyyy too open and deep. Required a safety pin to be modest
1.0,"Ordered a similar pair that I loved. Ordered these in large, and couldn't even squeeze them over my heels. they were laughably small."
1.0,Cute necklace. But it broke the first time wearing it.
1.0,They are not as pictured. The band is not the same. It’s a small band that is really uncomfortable. I don’t recommend these because it’s a pain to even return.
1.0,I brought an 8-9 year old size . They were too small my toddler could’ve have worn them. I wouldn’t recommend.
1.0,Too small returning for refund lol cheap
1.0,It is not sturdy and the locking set lever easily disengages while setting the code.  Hour of my life wasted.  Buy something else.  This is junk.
1.0,It was very big and the color was off . I wanted the blue and it was more of a lt blue-teal color .
1.0,"I bought these vinyl gloves specifically because I need ones that are ""lightly powdered"", as most other brands do not offer powdered gloves. The packing slip lists the product as ""Safeguard Medium Size Lightly Powdered Gloves, 100 Count"", but the box of gloves clearly states ""Powder-Free"". I should have opened the package immediately upon receipt because it's way past the date of eligibility for me to return the product. Lesson learned; open all of your Amazon packages immediately to check the contents."
1.0,I had to return because they were too big for kids.
1.0,"Seem ripped out the first time my son wore this. His bike was in the shop so now that he's finally able to ride he has a ripped jacket that's no longer waterproof. Tried to go through and do a return, but it says the return window closed yesterday."
1.0,I ordered a size 11M TWICE. Both times they came a size too big.
1.0,"meh.  cheap material, looks good only from a distance.  wouldn't waste your money"
1.0,Looks like a dark disc and not anything like the picture that sold me on it.  I’ll keep it because of the hassle to return it but it’s not pretty like I thought it might be.
1.0,Ugly material too hard
1.0,El número que pedí fue 3 m y me llegó un número 34
1.0,"The fabric smells, is see-through, poor quality and ill fitting. Not as described."
1.0,Too high in front with a drastic high low style. Arm holes were very large
1.0,Disgusting! Came in like this!!!
1.0,I will simply say that it is NOT what I expected; the mechanics of this junk watch has been a failure since I opened the box.  It doesn't work as advertised and the Customer service from the vendor is less than desirable service.  I am NOT able to send it back or get a replacement; AMAZON filters the communication and the vendor dances with poor excuses to approve a return.  FACT: since I get the junk and the lousy service i have boycotted the vendor and Amazon.  My purchases mean NOTHING to both company's all for a $100.00;  - I just got my $100.00 opportunity to tell the truth.
1.0,The jacket doesn't light up when I move the switch to either position. I received batteries but it doesn't turn on.
1.0,Poor quality Flimsy
1.0,Both bands were easy to install and moderately comfortable but both broke in less then a months worth of use. The linked band won't clasp anymore and the mesh magnetic band broke away from the area that connects to the watch.<br /><br />Cannot recommend this product.
1.0,This is a sub par windbreaker that is not waterproof. It is not a rain jacket. I returned it. I live in Seattle. I need a real rain jacket.
1.0,I wanted to love this shirt but I just couldn't. Arms were way too long even for the fold over puff and shirt was too short.
1.0,Not supportive at all!! I wear a 36DD so I ordered these bra’s in a size large to wear to the gym. Pretty sure I have black eyes from my boobs bouncing around the entire time I was on the elliptical. 10/10 DONT recommend for workout purposes.
1.0,trouser fabric is good<br />but very bad seams
1.0,I was very disappointed with this dress. At a cost of $34.00 the material was flimsy.
1.0,"This dress was WAYYYYYY too large! I’m 5’2”, 125 lbs, and it looks like I was wearing a tent. I’m returning this and I don’t recommend this dress to anyone, unless you want to wear a dress that’s 4x too large for you"
1.0,Just way too gaudy and big
1.0,"Do not waste your money, cheap cheap cheap!"
1.0,Thin fabric fit like a Medium instead of large
1.0,Cheap rinestones missing and it has broken from the attachment
1.0,Too huge
1.0,"It looks like moths already attacked it before it got here. 1 wash and it would be over.<br />I like the cotton feel but, this is a seriously cheap sweater. Definitely wouldn't give as a gift.l"
1.0,I should’ve trusted all of the other reviews.. it was way too small. I ordered this for my oldest son and it looked like it was made for a baby doll. Especially the hat!! I don’t know who that would ever fit. I was very disappointed. I ordered a medium and a large just in case and both were the exact same size!! What a joke.
1.0,Does not fit true to size. You have to upsize by 2 if you want to just fit in them.
1.0,I have a large head and felt these were a bit too snug. The mirrored green lenses were a big disappointment due to me being able to see my own eyes and cheeks in a reflection from the inside of the lens. They looked great and it was large disappointment that I am having to send them back. I bought these for a fishing trip and had to use a cheap giveaway pair due to the headaches they cause.
1.0,perdió color solo usándolo tres veces
1.0,This is junk.
1.0,Thy hurt my toddler feet.
1.0,Does not look like picture!
1.0,"The dress is pretty, the fabric quality is great, the dress was way too long. I was going to get it tailored, because I wanted to keep the dress. But it cost more to tailored it, then the dress. So I returned it."
1.0,The chains coming from the deer head are uneven and come to a close that could fit around a 3 yr-old's wrist only. I have small wrists and this is just ridiculous. The picture is not accurate b/c the chains are longer and look like they might actually make sense in the picture. Disappointed.
1.0,"Cheap China crap, dye job uneven and splotchy. Back to Pendleton."
1.0,"These run small, had to return.  They run small.."
1.0,Does the job but my son has blisters from wearing them and the soles keep coming out. I ended up tossing them out after camp.
1.0,Lousy product. Was surprised to see the too very loose & straps on back was not fitted the way it should be & looked out of proportion . it wasn’t nothing like the picture shown<br />it is my worst workout top & I was disappointed.
1.0,These are small.  I bought for my grandkids between 4-10 age.  My 4 year old can wear but to small for rest.
1.0,NO GOOD<br />CHANGED COLOR AND TURNED FINGER BLACK
1.0,bad quality. don't buy it.
1.0,Didn’t fit my foot properly. Appears that straps  weren’t measured properly from foot bed to top of foot. No way to adjust. Sent back.
1.0,Extremely cheap material way too large way too long underneath the arms went almost down to my ribs I had to send these back but I’m still looking
1.0,Terrible flip flops! They fit my son great the first day but after that they loosened up so much and all the colors faded right away
1.0,Missing the other earrings!
1.0,Poor construction and woven so loosely you can see through it.<br />It looks like a warm sweater.  It's<br />not.  And huge.
1.0,Poorly Made...Fell Apart
1.0,"Wood looks good. Stone looked poorly fitted, seated, and glued. Nothing like the pics. Sure enough, both stones fell out within a couple of weeks. I did not wear them in the shower or swimming."
1.0,"The watch I received is similar, but not the same as the item advertised. The watch I got has a band that is a less-appealing brighter shade of blue and has cheap rhinestones embedded in the metal that circles the face. It has roman numerals as opposed to rhinestones for the numbers on the face. I will be returning this watch."
1.0,"They work pretty reliably, and last at least a few hours. It would be nice if there was glass or crystal or something to cover over the movement, as it is, it seems to me it can be stopped or damaged by a wayward finger or piece of fabric.<br /><br />I'll try to remember to come back to here after I wear them a few times.<br /><br />update: the fact that the gears are exposed to the open air really ruins them. All it takes is a little bump for a gear to be knocked out of position, or the balance wheel to be bent out of shape."
1.0,I bought 2 for my granddaughter and grandson and you can’t put them in time not good
1.0,False advertising these pants are Asian weight so large xl 2 xl 3 xl dont fit like the normal sizes i usally wear an xl got thesen 3xl culdnt get one leg thru neva ever
1.0,"I bought this because the strap that came with my phone case had a metal chain that kept getting stuck to the magnetic.....that case was 8.99 , this replacement strap was 8.49  and this was very inconvenient and ridiculous."
1.0,"I'm not sure what I should've expected with the price being so low, but they have all completely fallen apart! Two fell apart the first time I tried to put them on. It literally looks like they were put together with some glues and dollar store fabric. Don't waste your money."
1.0,I ordered the maroon and black flannel and received this.... it’s also very flannel color and not like the description
1.0,This ring broke the very first time I tried it on. You get what you pay for I guess.
1.0,The hearts would just completely break off... literally crumb to pieces!
1.0,Very poor quality didn’t fit right the bra area wasn’t flattering at all would not buy again
1.0,It is poorly made. The snaps broke and the seams came apart.
1.0,Very poor quality.. Odd shape and hung crooked.. The two front sections draped apart at the bottom (although it fit and was the  correct size for me) so it appeared not to fit and I looked pregnant. It's really not good.
1.0,It do not come with a comb. It didnt even look like a veil. It looks nothing like the picture. Please don’t waste your time or money.
1.0,this is terrible elastic  was literally tied knots to a rectangle piece of open weave fabric.  I must say_<br /><br />ya got me...SMH
1.0,Terrible.  No stretch to them...the stretch is what should keep them up.
1.0,"Definitely doesn't fit the way the picture shows. My ears don't fit like shown, so it doesn't sit on my head like shown. When I do manage to get it to fit&sit, it doesn't take too long before it just slides off.<br /><br />As of now, would not recommend."
1.0,This watch is not waterproof. I wore it in the water for about 1 hour and it is now broken.
1.0,"The leggings i received were TERRIBLE QUALITY! I would rank them 0 out of 10. The material was cheap and scratchy, see-through, not at all an athletic fabric. They fit badly as well, i returned them immediately when i got them in the mail. Hate them!"
1.0,very blurry. double vision effect.  not fun to use at all.
1.0,SEE THRU. So disappointing. Do not buy
1.0,"Way too much velcro. Extremely hard to button up, weird closures. very long inside hem. Overall poor design."
1.0,Junk. Lower lens on lh side broke in half while putting them on within a week.  Hadnt even dropped them or scratched the lenses yet...very disappointed. Not worth it to send them back.
1.0,Not at all like the pic.. It looks like children’s bulky Halloween jewelry. It’s in the trash.
1.0,"It ripped within days of me buying these, terribly made. Don’t waste your money, it seems like a good deal but the quality is not worth it."
1.0,XL was more like XS
1.0,"Sent back, kind of cheap looking."
1.0,much flimsier than looks in the picture.
1.0,"So disappointed with this watch band.  I put my Fitbit in the band and it was way too loose.  I was afraid that it would fall out.  Because of it being loose, the buttons would not work.  Over all, I do not recommend this watch band."
1.0,"This watch stopped working after just a couple weeks.  I thought the battery needed to be replaced but when the watch technician opened it up he said the mechanism was actually broken.  You get what you pay for, I guess. Such a bummer."
1.0,They are so flimsy and bent the 1st time I put them on.
1.0,I wish I never bought it! It broke with in two days. Found it on my bathroom floor!<br />Now I know why it was only $75.00 dollars.
1.0,I’m not a expert but mine crystal were either color enhanced or not real. Very disappointed but there are many other awesome starter sets from other companies so I gave the bad set to my daughter who doesn’t mind.
1.0,"Extremely cheap, thin fabric.  And if you are taller than 5’3”, forget the fit.  The inseam is about a foot too short 🙄.  Good luck.."
1.0,I ordered 32x32 pants and received 32x40 pants. Pants do not have real ripstop material and feel as if fabric could split upon bending and crouching down. Waistband has elastic waste wich just ruins the fitment. Not worth the money period!
1.0,It did not fit and did not look like the one in the picture when I ordered.
1.0,Fell apart in a week
1.0,"This dress is coming from China, and if you have a problem you have to deal with the seller, not Amazon. The fabric was a mess. The polka dot pattern is horribly crooked and looks terrible. I was approved for a return and took it to UPS who told me it would cost between $300-$400 to return it. I will not wear this dress, and it is just a loss. Don't order from this company."
1.0,I ordered the largest size<br />  I am a 16/18. According to the chart it was 3 sizes to small.<br />And had deodorant stains.
1.0,The quality was poor<br />Not at all like picture<br />Item was returned
1.0,Is really cheap material is not worth buying
1.0,to small and took to long to get
1.0,"The dress looked way darker than it looks in the picture, and I didn't really like the feel of the fabric"
1.0,Hard material feels Billy and color not true to pic
1.0,Sheer and too small
1.0,"Socks lasted about 3 months before they wore through. I’m on my feet walking for about 6+ hours a day. These worked well for that in the beginning, but it was short-lived."
1.0,"Ordered at same time as my new S3 watch. Product data clearly indicates compatable with the 46mm S3, unfortunately the pins in the ends are approximately 1mm too long. End result is that I ended up ordering a different product."
1.0,Their fine sunglasses I guess? Just NOTHING at all like the pictures. If you’re looking for tortoise shell looking rims with large dark brown lenses these are not it. Frames are yellow cheetah print with light brown small lenses
1.0,"CAUTION. Seller posted misleading size chart. Notice text that says to expect 1-3cm variation in lengths. A variation of plus/minus 1 inch is pretty big in my opinion. When I stand up with these shorts on, the padding sticks out like a flap several inches behind my butt. These shorts are not stretchy or tight-fitting as advertised. The material is cheap."
1.0,Was so tangled up when I received it. Unable to fix
1.0,Looks cheap. Fabric is cheap and off black. Would not buy again- it fits like a sack. Not flattering unless you’re 400 pounds.
1.0,"I would give zero stars if I could. When I removed the shirt from its protective packaging, it had a black stain on the front, it is unwearable. Sending back."
1.0,Horribly made! Don't waste your money
1.0,poor quality cloth very cheap material used
1.0,"This is quite possibly the smallest item of clothing I have ever bought sized XX-L. It's barely thicker than a regular shirt. The button slits are horizontal not vertical making it difficult to button. I'll ask my fiance who is a third my size is she wants it. If not it's going right back to the store. Upside, color was nice and it got here fast. Hopefully my money will be back in my bank account just as fast."
1.0,"The size is not well explained. I ordered a size 5 for my daughter, but that’s a Men’s 5, women’s 7, which is not explained on the site."
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:24cf28c6d661b5aff018dc20f0a7d48e]] The lehenga sent to me was used.<br />- Smelled very bad, sweat mixed with perfume.<br />- The top has stains at the front.<br />- The top has sweat stains under the arm area.<br />- The stitched and the zipper were torn."
1.0,Broke in less than 3 days. Skip this
1.0,Item is too small. Measurements on pictures say 10 inches wide however these measure 9 inches wide. Had to return it.
1.0,This item is made SMALL!!!!  I ordered it so that it would flow and hang.  I ordered it in the largest size possible because I wanted an oversized linen shirt.  That's not what I received.  I guess I should know when its coming from a forgein country it wouldn't be made in American specs but they should have that on the description of the item.  Trying to retune it is just too much of a hassle; I'll just give it away.
1.0,My purse came with a slice on the flap. Not good.
1.0,"These were very cute and had clean stitching. I liked the patterns and quality of the product. However, the pouch was way too big to protect chapstick. I was interested in this product to keep me from continuously losing my chapstick, but it slips out VERY easily. This is more of a lighter pouch as a lighter fits nice and snug in there."
1.0,Not a terrible top but It doesn't look like what is in the picture...Not sweat shirt material....I'll give it as a gift to someone.
1.0,"Where do I begin, these are obviously for newborns cause they are tiny, an i mean extra tiny like for a barbie doll. Dont buy this at all, this is  a disgraceful item they lied"
1.0,The skirt is almost too small to pull up one leg.  You mis-read the size!!! You will see what I mean.  Susan Tindall<br /><br />I want to send it back.  Please send someone to pick it up.
1.0,"Utter crap. Sewn weird, collar is way strange and it's just crap"
1.0,Looks exactly like the picture. Once I picked it up immediately noticed its made out of cheap lightweight material. The watch is pretty but I'd rather so end more for a well made watch.
1.0,Nothing like the picture orange red in color.  This item was to large in the chest and I'm a 32 D. No wire support as shown in the picture. Very dissatisfied!!!
1.0,I was totally not a fan of this product not very user-friendly was very hard to get my duty belt adjusted on it so I sent it back it also kept snagging my belt loops on my uniform trousers I mean if you like Velcro snagging your pants in spending 10 to 15 minutes hassling with your duty belt this product might be for you but it wasn’t for me I need quick and efficient this was not that
1.0,Do not buy!  Not saltwater resistant ...take a look in the pics!
1.0,These are cute and well made. But order 2 sizes up.
1.0,Terrible quality broke the first time opening the package!
1.0,Was not pleased with any of these. Were very small for adult nose and hard to open.
1.0,Broke after about a week and a half of use...
1.0,I just ordered my Tommy Hilfiger purse in April and it's already coming apart. I took pictures to show the stitching is coming apart! Not satisfied at all!
1.0,Hardware is not silver as described. It is cheap and poorly molded.
1.0,"I ordered this because of its specification indicated on Amazon. But in addition to scratches and stains on the goggles, they are also not filtering laser at all. This is serious issue if they were to be used as &#34;safety&#34; goggles.<br /><br />They are shipped on time and come with the free box as suggested.<br /><br />&#34;Product Description<br />Laser exposure to the eyes is very dangerous and must be prevented.

1.0,Large and sheer
1.0,These do not stick at all. Useless
1.0,Place it in my pocket and the straps came undone at the face of the watch.
1.0,This product was crap. Crumpled and would not hold shape at all. Reeked of chemicals. The lighting was peeling off. Only negatives to say. Didn’t even let my son wear it. Absolutely NOT worth purchasing.
1.0,the print is great but this product will not fit a grown males head!! It did not fit my female smaller head. I gave it to my friends 4 year old. false advertising. made me sad
1.0,"So many things wrong with this order. Bought the skirt in the navy and it was perfect. So much so that I bought it in black and that's when it all went south. Yes that is a freaking dead bug with its mummified legs hooked into it, plus it's not the skirt I ordered! It had pockets which added more hips that I didn't ask for and it had a freaking dead bug attached. Clearly it had been worn because it had no tags on the skirt! I'm beyond upset...I'm disgusted!"
1.0,"Product is see through. Does not fit properly. I will say the person I talked to about the first size I ordered and wanted to return said to keep it and they would send another one for free so I was hoping for a better quality but no, same issues."
1.0,"The shirt is true to it's size, but the screen print was not pressed on correctly in my case and there's a black dot stamped on under the graphic that looks like a stain. Also, after receiving this shirt, I realized that the tall tower was the famous Willis Tower...that's not in Detroit, and although people might not know that, it's a tad annoying for me because the graphic has nothing to do with the city. So, I never wore it-I just used it as a rag."
1.0,"They seemed to have been assembled with very cheap glue, therefore when I opened the package they were in pieces."
1.0,Why would you put white thread on a green dress? I don't even know why there is stitching across the chest to begin with! None of the pictures I looked at had this.
1.0,I qaa
1.0,Fit is terrible
1.0,"I looooved this jacket, the length is just what I wanted. I'm 5'2 and it goes down to below my knees.  I love the 2 way zipper and the zippered pockets. It is also very warm. I got a large and it fits me perfectly.<br /><br />BUT,<br /><br />only 4 days of wearing it I felt cold air on my side, reached over and there is a big hole in the seem on my side. I am soooo bummed."
1.0,Looks very fake and not a great product.
1.0,They didn’t fit
1.0,All bark and no bite. They simply didn't work! Didn't work above 35 degrees much less below 35 degrees! My feet were still cold. Don't waste your money!
1.0,bought two neither one will tell the correct time past one hour
1.0,"I'm 5'6 145lb, typically a medium in anything. I ordered a large of multiple zaful bikinis, including this one, knowing they run small, all in different styles because I'm aware some styles fit certain body types better than others. Every single bikini ive tried on does not cover my boobs (I'm a full C and I either have severe underboob or my nipples are showing in these tops) I also ordered a large in a bikini I had previously purchased from Zaful in a medium that was too small, and the large top is literally smaller than the medium. No matter how much I tighten the straps or shift things around, there's no way I can fit into ANY style of Zaful's large top (strapless, v-cup, tube cut, etc.), which is insane! Zaful is selling products for body proporations that don't exist. If you're selling a large it should fit like a large, not be smaller than a medium. Waste of time and money."
1.0,Very cheaply made for the high price.
1.0,Not cotton. Not a racer back. I don’t like it at all.
1.0,they pilled after one wearing.
1.0,"This is a really cute band, but won’t fit over my protecting my watch. I can get one side in, but not the other. Will have to return."
1.0,I've owned the black floral for 6 weeks probably washed it 4 times and looks like I've worn/washed it for years. Totally faded- not worth it
1.0,"Cheap earrings, post came off after one wearing.<br />Also irritating to earlobes"
1.0,Looks like a moo moo. Would probably look good on the right person. Does not come off shoulder like picture suggests
1.0,The dress fit and looks nothing like the picture
1.0,These earrings came with plastic backs. I should have returned them but I decided to keep them. Lost them the first day I wore them.  You get what you pay for.
1.0,"I returned this since what is show in the picture and what arrived are two different things.  The product that arrived was without any charm, no shine, and the beads appeared worn out."
1.0,"I own  several leather coats and this coat is very disappointing. Looks great in the ad but when seen up close, It is too thin, flimsy and looks so cheap.  It is not worth the price being asked.  Also, an individual will need to layer sweaters in order to be warm enough even on a cool day.  I would not recommend this item to anyone."
1.0,Cheap necklace broke the day my daughter played with it.
1.0,"The sleeves are HORRIBLE!!!!! I literally cut the off, and took the dress to the tailor and made it into a one strap dress. The glitter constantly falls off. But again your get what you pay for. Also it arrived 3 weeks after the initial delivery date 0/10 don’t recommend"
1.0,"Item was a very cheap, thick, polyester fabric. The large was too small for my 34 DD chest. Returned it right away"
1.0,"This dress was so far the worst online shopping experience. The fabric is low quality, the shape is weird, the waist is ridiculously high, it would probably only work for very short people but I am 5’8’’ and it looks terrible. In addition, my arms are not too skinny for my general size but sleeves are to wide which kills the whole look. Returning."
1.0,Color is very gray.
1.0,Looks cheap . Don’t waste your money !
1.0,"bended too easily and broke the tail piece after the first couple weeks, and then broke in half about a month later"
1.0,Well..I opened up the bag and only had 1 glove .
1.0,"My mom loved mine so much I ordered her one for her birthday, and it arrived today just in time but with missing diamonds. Soo upset and now it's too late to order her another one in time. Is a beautiful ring though when the gems aren't missing."
1.0,"Not for anyone who actually has boobs. Bottom layer is stretchy, but the top sequin layer has no stretch and no room for breast larger than an A."
1.0,Color too orange
1.0,One of the insert pieces snapped the first time I tried to wear them. I was very careful because so many reviews said they were delicate. Apparently I was not careful enough. Not happy at all.
1.0,Says 925 sterling silver but I’ve been wearing them for weeks and they have completely discolored and started peeling along with leaving green marks on my ears. So they are not 925 sterling silver. Really disappointed
1.0,"I can't say how this fit because it was so scratchy I couldn't put it over my head. When I took it out of the package I thought it must have been cheap wool. But no it was a polyester blend. Seriously, it felt like the scouring side of a dish sponge. I don't understand the other reviews. Maybe mine was defective."
1.0,The material is super sheep
1.0,I ordered my usual xl size and I felt like a sausage when I got it on. At least two sizes too small. Will be returning.
1.0,Cheap broke when I took it out
1.0,Doesn't have the 100 face masks only recieve 50
1.0,I got a totally different hat than what’s pictured. It does NOT say CBS News. 😡
1.0,Placement of ear loops make it impossible to wear without covering eyes. Not made to actually fit proper human anatomy!!  Cats love playing with it though
1.0,"It says there is a crown, no crown. The outfit itself doesn’t even look like a Loki outfit. We bought it for the crown and we’re going to make our own costume and my child was just  going to use this costume for dress up but it’s really ugly. Not worth anything if no crown included. They call it a “grown” but had a picture of a crown and cape with it. I assume it’s a typo since it is a Chinese product. Very misleading, avoid at all costs."
1.0,Had to give it away. Ordered an XL expecting it to run a bit small (I wear an 8/10). It was probably a 2/4. Adorable but I would have ripped it in two trying to put it on.
1.0,This did not look like the picture. Material was cheap and the lace does not lay flat. It was awful. I returned it.
1.0,Material isn’t great at all
1.0,Lost its shine within a month.
1.0,Ordered for both of my helix and it only came with one earring for the helix
1.0,FALLS OFF POOR MAGNET DON'T BOTHER. SELLER IS USELESS
1.0,It looked in the picture to be a full length slip but it was only 3/4 long. It was very small. I was disappointed.
1.0,not polarized
1.0,One bracelet you can’t adjust at all.  Too inconvenient to return one.
1.0,"The material quality, the cut and design were not as described.  Very disappointed."
1.0,Broke after using several times
1.0,Seller did not give me my full refund. Don’t buy this dress poor quality
1.0,Terrible I returned it the stone fell out after two weeks I had it. Nice looking but it broke.
1.0,"Nothing like the picture!  This is why I’ve been hesitant to order any clothes online. Driven by the success of friends I decided to try this one. I don’t know where the mix up was but i received a straight, long, slim dress no where near the beautiful flared dress in the pic. Wrong color, wrong design. Very disappointed. Couldn’t use it at all."
1.0,The overall style clasp was made poorly and broke almost immediately
1.0,"These are very inexpensive, but you basically get what you pay for.  There is no elastic in the legs so they just ride up and end up serving no purpose.  I'm not a large person and the large was still too small for me.  They fit in the front up to the waist but the back only comes half way up the butt.  No, I do not have a huge butt!  Just got what I paid for."
1.0,Cheapest thing ever bought
1.0,"You need to be very small to wear this. Looks like it would be very pretty, but I'm a larger woman and had to send it back."
1.0,After 4 swim lessons these broke. Disappointed.
1.0,Love the look but the gold is already tarnished/turning dark after one wear.
1.0,Not a bad quality tee shirt but 3x is like A female XL. Disappointing and a waste of my money.
1.0,"I got this unfortunately I got 2 of the same color for some reason, but I also thought it would have been made to fit as it says but it isn't or they sent both in worng size but it's nice if ur a smaller build"
1.0,Very thin and cheaply made!!
1.0,I bought three different colors of this shirt in the same size. Or at least it should’ve been. There was no sizing consistency and not one of them was remotely as cute as the picture. They’re so bad I don’t even want to attach photos to this review.
1.0,It was pretty when I got it a couple days ago however the glitter and design is already coming off. Very cheaply made.
1.0,It had a missing stone or two when I opened it I was very disappointed
1.0,not good material and fits well but looks so cheap so im not wearing it better buy from the lees more expensive but best quality and this ones are not slim fit i bought the pink one too and is so loose being the same size def a waste of money
1.0,"I love the style of this dress but it is totally see through. Sadly, had to return."
1.0,This watch is bad sub to pride and pinion never by a hubolt it is garbage
1.0,I bought a small and was swimming in it. It's also NOT A SWEATER AS ADVERTISED.  The colors are far more vibrant than the photo.
1.0,Very sexy but doesn't not fit as expected. Wished they had a bigger size.
1.0,No sirven solo 😭 un mes basura 🗑
1.0,Terrible. The lowest quality fabric. Rude seller with horrible customer service. The size measurements online are incorrect and it will take over a month to get your dress. Don't bother!
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:35db30c5f52b6543c7465d51a4e616e9]] Unfortunately, Looks cute online, but product does not look the same. It is low Quality and cheaply made. There are gaps where thread should be and it’s like that for every single pair here. I would pass up this offer it is not worth it and I was disappointed."
1.0,"It turned in less than a weak. Very disappointed this was a gift to my mom, I then had to go and take it back. How shameful that was 😔."
1.0,It broke the day I got it.
1.0,"This bag is hideous, cheaply made, and a nightmare to return.  I ended up just throwing it in the trash.  Never again."
1.0,This product is not made very well.  I used it twice and the grummet pulled from the side of the bag.  Can not be used because the handle was can not be replaced.
1.0,This shirt runs incredibly small and the lettering is faded (maybe intentional)
1.0,Nunca me llego la campera
1.0,It was fine. But definitely not the same item as what was advertised. The neckline is completely different. Returned it.
1.0,Muy pequena
1.0,Horrible to get on a kids feet!
1.0,I didn't realize how tiny this was.  I guess it would be fine for a small child to put a few coins in.
1.0,"It’s not at all what I ordered. It’s not denim, it’s just a blue cap. The lettering is just shiny and looked like it was made in someone’s basement. I suppose I should have expected that. Would not purchase again."
1.0,"Normally I wear a small or medium depending on the maker but I ordered a medium because the description says it's a junior fit. I am a 5'7&#34;, 32 old slender woman and junior fit indicates &#34;teenage size&#34; to me.  So I ordered a medium to be on the safe side to ensure that it would fit. The medium is the size of a nightshirt on me!! I'm pretty disappointed that this shirt did not fit and not sure if this item is able to be returned for a better size."
1.0,These are not worth any amount of money. They do not support any where. And if you put your phone in the pocket they will begin to sag on that side as soon as you start walking. You have to keep pulling them up.
1.0,Cheap. Hinge broke within an hour.
1.0,"Be aware when you buy this , I have a black stain on my skin and a painful bump in my ears"
1.0,"The rose gold wears off fast. If you order, get an automobile detailer to ceramic coat it."
1.0,Picture does not match color assortment. See picture
1.0,The top fits well but the bottom did not go around my hips as expected.
1.0,It is see through! No backing just stretch lace. Unable to wear!
1.0,"This is a kids watch, or a woman's watch. It's all plastic,  and tiny. It's going back"
1.0,Material doesn't hold up. Gets thin and see through after a few washes
1.0,NOT what I expected... waaaay too small! I won't be able to wear it
1.0,"I tried every angle, every adjustment and they do not improve my vision while using them.  I have different prescriptions in each eye.  Maybe they work for other people."
1.0,"Wow. This item is horrific. I followed the instructions to size up (for reference I am typically an XS-S and that's moreso in juniors sizes.. I almost always ignore rec's to size up, which usually serves me well bc even then the allegedly small item is sometimes too big) - and went with a M to be safe. I could not even get them on. I have never had a &#34;medium&#34; be so tiny. It is truly like children's sizes. And yes, it is scratchy, and borderline see-through, and cheap... but it's a costume and they are ALL scratchy and cheap. So had they fit, I still would have worn them. This is the only item I have ever ordered that I will be returning. And it leaves me with nothing for Halloween."
1.0,Fake. Hold nothing
1.0,"Unfortunately, the item I got, doesn't work as its described and expected."
1.0,"NOT recommended.<br /><br />Size issues: My hand measures 8-1/4”, mid way up the LARGE size, fit EXCLUDING finger holes is good, but likely NOT for a hand larger than mine, since the finger openings are already TOO snug for comfort though my fingers are not fat or unusually big/muscular for a mans hand, I usually wear medium work gloves unless I want a loose fit.<br /><br />Functional issues:<br />Don’t confuse these with GEL type cushions like I did!!<br />I bought these because I needed a padded glove for supporting myself while shooting video on my hands/knees. The pad material is too hard, not much give, raised pad concentrates weight primarily on ball of thumb, immediately worse than being bare handed, I do ride a road bike and would not consider these suitable for supporting weight on handle bars or hard landings in rough terrain.<br /><br />Vibration: just for review purposes I tested vibration with my SawzAll type reciprocating saw, could not discern that it made any difference at all since the pad is much harder with minimal squish compared to other shock/vibration absorbing materials.<br /><br />I am returning mine."
1.0,"The chameleon mask looks amazing in the picture, but when you spread it out to wear it, it’s impossible to even determine it is a chameleon!  It was just wasted money.  No complaints about the quality and fit."
1.0,"I should have known as the price is so low.  I sent in to my granddaughter and it too forever to get to her!  The hat was just a piece of felt, did not have any real shape and ripped right away.  She showed it to me and I told her to throw it away.  Live and learn."
1.0,"I couldn't wear it on the beach, which is the reason I got it.  Very little to no ventilation.  My head was overheating."
1.0,The Material plus it was more expensive than the one that banana republic sold not the same quality at all
1.0,Very comfortable when I tried on.
1.0,not a good item
1.0,Backpack tore within 2 weeks
1.0,Had to return because it was way too short. Not for tall women at all.
1.0,Uncomfortable. Save your money for a better slipper. Feels like I'm walking flat footed and it hurts my feet
1.0,NOT TRUE TO SIDE.  SUGGEST ORDERING 2 SIZES UP
1.0,"The hat was too small. I have an average size head and was very disappointed with the fit. Love the style with the buttons on the side, unfortunately it didn’t work for me."
1.0,3X is more like a medium
1.0,Awful. You need to size up at least 2 sizes. Returning the product is a huge hassle also.
1.0,Absolutely horrible - after wearing the shoes for 2 weeks the sole detached from the rest of the shoe. Would NOT recommend!
1.0,"when i got this, i thought this will fit my doll, it was so small. the clasp is so small you couldent get it on by yourself."
1.0,Scrunchie arrived broken in the middle.  Hair quality looks noticeably fake :(
1.0,"Would not purchase, very large and look cheap."
1.0,Not impressed. Cheaply made import
1.0,"I was so excited to get these and loved the look of them. The legs are a great fit, but the waistband elastic is very loose (almost non-existent) and by a 1/4 mile into my first run wearing them, they had slid halfway down my butt cheeks."
1.0,Doesn't look like picture at all
1.0,Nice sunglasses with a nice case but they are NOT polarized. I specifically bought them because they say they are polarized and labeled as such. I have polarized Maui Jim’s and I tested these against those glasses and the Woodies are not polarized…it’s simple to tell.  Two  polarized lenses held at right angles will be opaque.  I even did a test I got from Google with my cell phone to double check In case I was mistaken these lenses are not polarized.  Very disappointed because polarization makes a huge difference.  Going back
1.0,This is a peace of junk and no place does it say you CAN NOT RETURN  it. I am now stuck with this heavy horrible looking item. It doesn't look at all like the picture..
1.0,Didnt like the material.  Too thin.
1.0,"The keychain is not close to Glen Green, and the checkered flag pattern is printed onto the keychain using a very low resolution printer. Horrible keychain for a classic Corvette."
1.0,"Came quickly, adorable necklace. Extra length which was cute. Unfortunately after only 2 hours of regula wear it fell from my neck. The claps seems to be defective. Very disappointed 😔"
1.0,Loose fitting and too thin for full protection
1.0,"Poor quality, not green like I thought."
1.0,"My wife ordered these from Walmart and she loves them. She assured me that they were great, so I placed the order for these. I don't know if these are factory seconds or what, but I used them one time and had major issues. I didn't want to put too much pressure, so I filled them about half way full. She said I could probably add more, but I pack less clothes than she does anyway, so I just left them partially full. I had trouble with two of the three bags trying to get them to zip. Finally, she got them to zip up, but when I went to unpack them, they had busted at the zippers. Remember, my wife has used hers for probably 5 trips with no issues, and helped me pack mine - with even less in them than she packs in hers, and they didn't even make it from home to our destination. I am extremely disappointed."
1.0,Its just the band.<br />Very misleading
1.0,They lasted one month. The black onyx insert already missing. Three them away. Sad.
1.0,This is not the ordinary basic key ring. Threw straight to trash. I only wanted about 5. Had to get a pack of 50 and they weren’t even the right ones
1.0,"I bought these thinking they would be great but they are way too small.  I even ordered a size up after reading the other reviews but they are so skin tight, there is no way I could ever wear them in public.  Now they are very comfortable but not what I expected."
1.0,Material is extremely thin
1.0,"The picture turned out good, but I had a letter missing on my hat."
1.0,"These goggle fit great, look nice, and have a good seal.  They are clear outside of the water but once you go underwater they become very blurry and you can’t see anything.."
1.0,"After reading some of the reviews I thought I’d get this dress, however, when it arrived I didn't  even get what was ordered.  And if I did, it does not look like the picture at all. The material was also awful, super cheap, this should have been a $5 dress... even though, I’ve bought some $5 dresses of way better quality than this. Returned for a refund."
1.0,Everything that I have tried to order has been too little and I'm even going up a size🙄
1.0,Incredibly poor quality. They were shedding and falling apart right out of the package
1.0,"Brought 6/17 and used very little, back up cable. Not working now."
1.0,Terrible fabric- hate the dress don’t buy!
1.0,The mask failed to make it with the extremely cheap oversized costume.
1.0,"I am a huge fan of UnderArmour, and have been for YEARS! When body building, I would not wear anything else!  I have owned MANY tactical shirts, heat gear and cold gear now and in the past and I dunno what the hell happened to UA, but this shirt is waaaaaaaaaaaaay tooooooooooooooooo friggin big!  I need the shirt right now right now, otherwise I would have returned it.  This is no where near XS and I swim in it (I bought an XS, even double checked the tag to make sure it matched what was IN the shirt).  Am I going to have to resort to children's sizes?????<br /><br />I spend a lot of time outdoors and need tight fitting clothes, otherwise it is easy for bugs to get into my clothing (I always use UA as my bottom layer).  I am very, VERY disappointed in UA -- I have wasted my time and money.<br /><br /> I hope not all UA gear is like this now, otherwise I will have to go with another brand.<br /><br />Once I find a proper fitting shirt, I will donate this one.  Maybe a fat chick can wear it"
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:f3089ecce3d285e7dd7f55e5d12bde7f]] I went by the size chart and got the biggest size available this thing does not go around my waist, let alone go around a thigh . It must run 2-3 sizes smaller than actual size. It’s a shame because i was really looking forward to taking it out of the package and getting right to my work out ...."
1.0,Terrible quality should never have been made into jewelry. Turned my neck green after only 20 minutes of wear. I would never buy this again.
1.0,this earring got my 2 year old an infection. no longer needed
1.0,It was beyond too small.
1.0,The huge oversized collar makes this shirt unwearable. Looks ridiculous.
1.0,"Nothing like the product pictured. Much, much bigger pearls and bigger hoop."
1.0,"the length is fine, but the size runs small"
1.0,"Terrible cut, flimsy fabric."
1.0,"They look good on my face, but damn, the quality absolutely sucks."
1.0,"Cheap quality, poor stitching. They're too tight, and come far past my knee so they have to be triple folded over which hurts my leg, cutting off the blood flow. The stitching in the heel is so inferior you can see my foot through it! I use the same size & type of socks from other companies often; too and never had a fitting problem like this.  ""Jennifer"" contacted me multiple times to ""make sure you are 100% satisfied"" with my purchase and couldn't drop me fast enough when I told her the issues. Basically told me my feedback would be used to 'improve her products' and handed me off to Amazon!<br />However I'd ordered a pair of Blitzu Compression Socks from another seller and was amazed at how well they worked. For less money the Blitzu's were superior quality and pretty much eradicated my foot & leg pains; I hardly NEED compression socks at all now!"
1.0,"Was super excited for this flannel which I ordered in the Balsam Sunset Plaid color. Unfortunately, the flannel I received was a totally different (and ugly) color than shown in the product photos. Turns out, the product shown for Balsam Sunset Plaid—that I wanted and expected—is actually the product photo for the Aqua Grey Elias Plaid. (!?)<br /><br />So, buyer beware! You might not get what you think you’re getting. Returning it."
1.0,"Th material that was listed is wrong , its a cheap plastic feeling fabric . The color was blueish white .? and just completely not what's pictured. Save your money ."
1.0,This is not a sparkly mask. There is no sparkle it is a print. Totally deceiving
1.0,"Baby birthday is always a big holiday! We threw a party and decided to buy a great outfit. We chosen from several outfits. Yeah, the package came very fast. But I'm have shock! The letters on the T - shirt are curves, all the stitches are curves! The T - shirt is very simple. Curves stitches on the skirt too. I understand that these clothes are meant wearing for one time. But why it should be all curve! It's not worth $15. I'm very upset. And I don't have time to get my money back and buy something else. Now we're gonna have to wear something different to the party. Thanks for the ruined mood!"
1.0,Chain was NOT as described. Thin and knotted up. Clasp would not up up . Turtle was not as pictured with the blue and green. ( see photo) Sending back
1.0,I like the fold over waste band but the fabric isn't very thick and very see through.<br />Bought for vacation so didn't find out until I was away.<br />Too late to return  😔
1.0,"Broke the 2nd time I put it on, first time adjusting."
1.0,Too small the small size !
1.0,I'm having a hard time thinking of something positive to say.  It is VERY lightweight and unlined.  It doesn't have any structure to it.  It runs very large.  The decorative buttons are too heavy for the fabric. The belt is it's only closure and it's too lightweight to hold the coat in place. I look like a sack of potatoes in this coat.
1.0,The quality of the jacket was subpar<br />The look was not to expectation<br />Just over all not a good purchase
1.0,"this ring was beautiful...just what i wanted. 10 days later, the stone fell out at work. i looked everywhere for it to no avail. pretty upset about this. would like my money back, we'll see what happens."
1.0,De muy mala calidad y corre pequeño
1.0,This product is absolutely not silk. The cummerbund is one size and barely stays on me (I’m a 32 waist). The bow tie looks and feels cheap. Would not recommend at all! Spend some extra money and buy something higher quality
1.0,They came with the glue that was holding the lights already separated from the wings so we had to hot glue them before they could be worn. The wing also broke almost immediately after being put on.
1.0,"This dress is nothing like the picture, plus it has cancan and no where did they mention this."
1.0,"This is not leather. It is a very uncomfortable band, as well."
1.0,only good for cloudy days... does not work for bright sunny days
1.0,This quality is terrible! I’m returning it feels sooo thin and I intended on having this for the fall but it’s like thinner than a swim suit
1.0,Stupid don’t have instructions never able to use it
1.0,"Disappointing,  It says made for men but the XXL size is closer to a woman’s large"
1.0,I ordered these pendants specifically for the surfer and baseball items.<br />Not one. A bunch of gymnastics and football. Something that I don't even know what it is...I had to send them back..
1.0,It come alot smaller than what is the regular size.
1.0,"Skull button popped off during first day of wear. Sending these back. They were decent otherwise, but I do not recommend them!"
1.0,Shoulder straps are difficult to pull on.
1.0,Sickening to sell these to non natives. It is wrong.
1.0,poorly made! T CZ fell out of both the first time I wore them
1.0,We ordered two of these. One medium and one large. We first received the medium from “Your favorite t-shirts” on September 3rd and it was of great quality and labeled as a Disney product just as shown in the ad. We later received the large from “RUIJINCHANGSHANGMAO” on September 10th and what a disappointment. It is of the absolute lowest quality. The shirt itself is a generic no name brand product that wreaks of vinegar. It is not labeled as a Disney product. The print seems to be from an iron on patch that someone printed from a home office printer. The entire image is actually smaller on the large than it is on the medium size. RUIJINCHANGSHANGMAO should be ashamed of what they are selling. Your Favorite T-shirts on the other hand sent exactly what was promised.
1.0,"Two speakers are different sizes; the one with control panel if about 3 times larger than the other one. Looks awful on a head with the speakers in it. The shorter the hair, the obvious it is. Hat itself is not that bad, but for 40 buck there are many much better alternatives."
1.0,It is awful!
1.0,"This is not at all what I expected.  I was looking for a purple jeweled mask, this was material only"
1.0,Big gaudy
1.0,Color wasn't the same as photo.
1.0,"I ordered the largest size and it was was too too too small for me, would not even fit over my toes."
1.0,Bought for my son who has Sever’s Disease. His doc doesn’t want us to have to purchase the custom insoles b/c his feet are growing so fast. His insoles usually run about $50 but thought we’d give these a try.  They were excellent at first. He said they felt better than his old insoles. Now after 6 weeks the cover has peeled off and the foam is coming out in pieces. We will have to go back to the Sol insoles. The 1 set of inserts lasted through 3 pairs of shoes. These didn’t even last through 1 pair.
1.0,"It fit as expected, but the material felt like cheap fabric plastic.  It comfortable at all. I couldn't figure out how to tie the back? It made literally no sense. It was very clearly cheap made. Don't waste your money."
1.0,We received these shirts seemingly used with strong perfume odor due to body odor.  We washed it so many times but the odor stays.  We can not return because we washed them so many times.
1.0,I received them BROKEN...the lenses are cracked....they are VERY VERY CHEAPLY MADE...PLEASE DO NOT BUY.<br />THEY ALSO HAVE SHARP EDGES THAT HURT MY FACE....
1.0,They don’t work. And now Amazon says I can’t return them but I can’t find out why. Hmmm. Beware of the return policy.
1.0,The watch looks amazing but I have worn it less than 10 times in 3 months and the hands dont work... The little sec hand is ticking like it should but the minute and hour hand don't move ever... Huge bummer
1.0,This item’s sizing is so very incorrect.  Not true to size.  Very disappointing.
1.0,Very bad quality. It broken after the kid wears for an hour.
1.0,This is my second Buff and the first one was nice and seamless this one has a seam and its other materiel sewn into it it looks cheap and not worth the money i expected it to be the same quality as the first but its far from it
1.0,terrible quality tried to return and co wouldnt let me
1.0,"The color of the Dixie Peach should be a color like Vaseline or petroleum jelly, not  red it doesn't even smell like it"
1.0,Super small. A 5t fit like a small 4t but a child in a 3T could wear it. My son is slender and he normally wears a 5t which is just a little big for him. This product was just too small. Not made correctly.
1.0,"Yeah,  you have to pay attention to European/Asian sizing but still this was small and narrow. Very cute shoe and even well constructed overall but tooooo small. The buckle is also just for show, so you have to figure out exactly how to work it to stay.<br />Update: when I inquired about getting this corrected or refunded the best they could offer was 20%. BEWARE!"
1.0,"For a size 7 they was to, to small he could not pull them up, and he is 7years old."
1.0,Not what I expected from description
1.0,"WHY would they print numbers on the bottom of each sock , SO TACKY! Very disappointed!!! Was looking everywhere for these kind of socks , return !!!"
1.0,"The dress was not exactly the same as the picture, the sleeves are too tight. It not worth it."
1.0,These masks were thin as paper. They can't be protecting you from anything.
1.0,Gauges did not measure the same as expanders.
1.0,"This scarf is very short, unlike the picture. I was not able to even wrap into infinity form and my neck is small/average"
1.0,This was poorly made for the price and is was to big for travel . I sent it back as it was not useful for me  .
1.0,"This ring looks incredibly cheap in person, the band also bends really easily which I don’t like so I’m sending it back. I’m so disappointed!"
1.0,Very cheaply made. It is made with aluminum of some sorts. Just some kind of metal that's about as good as plastic.
1.0,The hoops wouldnt stay closed so I've never even been able to wear them. The CZ is placed terribly on the other earrings.  Will fall out. Dont buy. Just invest in real diamonds.
1.0,They feel apart the first time I washed them.
1.0,"The worst piece of junk jewelry ever.  It came, falling apart.  Would never order anything from Fun Daisy Jewelry.  I'm sorry I never got a chance to send it back.  Once I took it out of the package and realized I had to go out and find something else to go with a particular outfit I just put it back in the box and forgot about it. So, it was never worn, looked like something from a secondhand shop.  Some parts loose because hooks not tightned.  This necklace is a piece of junk"
1.0,It was a piece of plastic didn’t even have a chain or cord!  Something you would get in a gumball machine for 25 cents
1.0,"Obviously item was cheap, the 3 dials underneath were painted on and nonfunctional"
1.0,"The look of these is great, but the quality is garbage. The heels are secured using only some sort of nail, there is no glue, and they are very unstable. Just putting them on for the first time I could tell they were unstable, and I tried VERY hard to avoid putting my heel down first, and still BOTH heels became so loose that one of them actually fell off. These are not $50 quality, would not buy again"
1.0,Material is too thin and size ran really small
1.0,"I had to return this item. I ordered an XLarge and came in, actual size of a medium."
1.0,Junk no way to replace battery.......... There is no pocket to access the switch. Look for hat that shows pocket for battery.
1.0,These aren’t the correct size which really bums me out considering I was so excited to wear these. I’m willing to edit my review if the seller could refund me the right size. They’re very cute just way too big definitely have the sizes wrong and if you plan on buying make sure to take a size or two off of what your actual size is.
1.0,One size does not fit all. I am tall and thin and the pants were mid calf. The pants and made for a short thin person. I returned.
1.0,"I can’t say enough about how poorly these are made and the scalping price that’s associated with it. 40$ for two masks that are not assembled requiring a rough plastic circular piece to be stuck in the hole to hold a thin filter. These are no better then a thin cloth mask you can buy at any local store. Don’t waste your time, money or patience with these.<br /><br />They are comfortable and the strap goes around the back of your neck. They are thin, filter is poor and a huge ripoff."
1.0,Much larger than size sent for
1.0,I was disappointed with this piece.  The top oval was much bulkier than pictured and seemed to be glued on a bit messy.
1.0,"Way to big, definitely a males necklace NOT a girls. I paid more for this knecklace with such low quality looking antlers. I ended up returning this."
1.0,Not Sterling Silver so the silver fades off and starts to turn reddish color around the band if you get it wet! I went swimming multiple times and left it on in the showers and noticed the color change after approximately a week of having this item
1.0,"I bought these when they were pretty big for my son, so two years later, he's finally getting real use out of them. Unfortunately, these get wet inside, which makes you wonder how waterproof they are. The strange thing is, they take forever to dry. Even a day of being over the heat vent and running thru the dryer, the inside still feels damp, not very useful in the constant winter cold. If I could, I would definitely return."
1.0,"According to the ad, there were 4 bracelets.  I did not realize that there were 4 identical pieces to this product.  It came up with all the other multiple bracelets.  I would not have bought it if I knew this."
1.0,"I thought these shoes would be great to wear with flare pants, but they are so huge and bulky they are actually very ugly.  I am disappointed."
1.0,"The pins were too short.  Sent to us from our friends in  the Most Populous Nation on Earth.  I couldn't re-use the previous pins because I had to destroy them to get the old broken band off (no pin removal tool, and I doubt it would have helped).  Pointless to send it back."
1.0,The fit is too large for XS.
1.0,The gold coating started to turn green after a few days of wearing it. Would not purchase again.
1.0,"This tank top is terrible. I purposely ordered cotton so that it feels like cotton. This feels nothing like cotton, it’s gross. And it’s very thin. It’s a cheap tank top and I’m returning it"
1.0,"didn't like it looks to much like a ladies watch, I gave it to a woman"
1.0,"Bought it end of April this year, now end of September. Put it on this morning and the prong was missing. Quality control?"
1.0,The sleeves  on this dress are rediculoudly tight very very thin<br />And it does not stretch
1.0,"Ordered ""red"" it's ""orange."" It lasted 2 months before it broke."
1.0,These are garbage. The first time I tried to screw the back onto one of the earnings it broke!! DO NOT BUY
1.0,"Not only was this dress way too small and very clingy, but the fabric is that of a cheap swimsuit. I am furious that I waited too long to return it. :/"
1.0,"I was setting the bar low for this Casio watch, and I was not disappointed.  This priceless timepiece lasted for three weeks before the frame of the watch snapped making it unusable even with a new band.  It now makes an excellent pocket watch."
1.0,First of all it had a chemical odor soooo horrible had to wash it several times... Not to mention I ordered a small and came in a large... Dont waste your time... The smell never went away even used the Lysol additive several times... Had to just end up throwing away .... Sad thought from reviews and all it was a safe choice.. But NOPE
1.0,Bought in January and rope has come unglued and unraveled
1.0,Way too small and don't fit my ears at all.
1.0,Very itchy
1.0,Deceiving sizes
1.0,Fits more like a button up shirt than a robe it's pretty and will probley soften more when its washed and dried but it no where close to fitting :(
1.0,"I just got this item, don't look like the picture and the quality is poor, the fabric is too thin that you can see thru it. Very disappointed."
1.0,For the price you are better off buying Smiths or Oakley.  The technology is nice but so disappointed that Dillon Optics doesn't stand behind their product.  Purchased a fantastic pair of glasses less than a year ago. Only worn intermittently and babied the entire time.  The coating has begun to degrade. Admitted that they know the coating can wear off sometimes but that is not covered by warranty.  Better to spend your money with a company that stands behind their products.
1.0,I gave it one star because of the way the shoes came in packaging. The box was raggedy looking and the shoe only had one label printed in the left shoe but not the right shoe.
1.0,"Way to small.. I ordered two sizes up and the bathing suit didn't even come over my breast.  Also , it doesn't look like the picture"
1.0,"Does not stay on , need to send back. Uncomfortable. Doesn't deserve 1 star"
1.0,This shirt is so small I couldn’t even give it to my 10 year old daughter cause it’s that’s small... love the shirt just to small
1.0,It was more like a store bought Halloween costume.
1.0,"Beautiful dress, but elastic broke in sleeve after the first day I wore it. Very sad."
1.0,This is NOT silk👎🏾👎🏾
1.0,Very thin. Returned.
1.0,Runs small - but great for Halloween
1.0,Way too small! I got the same size as my uniform jersey an adult M and this looks like a small at best maybe even a youth size. I don’t even think this would fit as a shirt.
1.0,I really liked it until the pin broke off.  I used it to keep my scarf in place.  I am going to try a more expensive one next- You get what you pay for.
1.0,I returned it wouldn't work for me.
1.0,Gave to the neighbor. I ordered a 2xl. It was snug on my 120 lbs neighbor. Buyer beware.
1.0,Way too large. Very long. Stretches out even worse after a few minutes of wear.
1.0,I recieved it as a gift and it has stopped working even after replacing the battery .
1.0,"Robe fit until it was washed, then it barely covered my chest.  My wife threw out the shipping bag."
1.0,They literally broke as soon as I put them on my face. I am sad and disappointed I wasted ten dollars on such cheap sunglasses. DO NOT BUY.
1.0,They are very cute and seem to keep her feet warm but she has a hard time walking around in them they get all twisted up.
1.0,Way too small. I wear a 10 and the fit feels 3 sizes too small.
1.0,I have this sweatshirt to my son for Christmas and his worn it maybe 5 times. The letters are iron on and have already come off. Super disappointing this sweatshirt only was able to be worn a few times!
1.0,These broke within five minutes of putting them on my toddler. For being kids sunglasses I expected them to hold up to the regular wear of a child.
1.0,size WAY up if you want this shirt to fit as expexted.
1.0,Poor quality! Very small fit. Bought for my daughter and she can just about get it on. Took ages to come.
1.0,I had written a great review earlier since I think this is such a cute purse BUT the quality is TERRIBLE! After only a couple months the spot where the strap connects to the purse tore.
1.0,Not happy with what I received 😢
1.0,"Bad inversion, is completely different to the photo, I don’t like it."
1.0,"These were the top-rated flip-up sunglasses on another website, so I didn't pay as much attention as usual to the negative reviews at Amazon, many of which warned about the product breaking.  Bottom line: the sunglasses arrived, fit on my glasses well, and flipped up and down as expected.  That was the first time I used them.  One day later, I was able to put them on my glasses, but the clip broke irreparably when I tried to remove them.  So I got one use before they broke.  Even for inexpensive clip-ons, that's not good.  Keep looking, don't buy these!"
1.0,"I bought this thinking it would be a cheaply made faux corset, at least to appear like a full corset in photos or under a jacket. The center piece that has the design is so very small! It's barely enough to cover the bellybutton area, the rest is just cheap elastic band. I thought based on the photos it would be mostly the cheap patterned design on the front, with the sides and back being elastic, but no. Not worth the money at all!"
1.0,It’s see through and really short in the front and really long in the back. I only bought because a blogger recommended and I got sent a completely different sweater than her.
1.0,This band does not fit - do not buy these bands. I gave it one star because I liked the print - I wasted money on two of these bands - only one out of three fit.
1.0,Just ugly!
1.0,The sizes run way to small
1.0,Easily scratched!<br />Spend a few more dollars on other brands!
1.0,Not really like the picture
1.0,"The second time I wore this I noticed there was already a hole in the sleeve. Super bummed at the poor quality of this. While it’s a waffle print and light weight which I love, I had hope for it to hold up a bit more for the price. Wish I could return it and get my money back :/"
1.0,"Do not purchase for expensive earrings. They do not work, and come off after awhile.<br /><br />I’m so disappointed and angry that I trusted these earring backs with my good earrings."
1.0,Cute but lost the ball within a week
1.0,"This thing sucks...Once the money clip gets opened up to put one single bill under it, it is sprung and won't go back. So Cash ends up in your pocket not under the clip. Also forget getting a card out quick at all. This thing is useless."
1.0,"The buckle fell off the first time I used it, I had to tape it together for the rest of that day."
1.0,Different from pic....crappy material
1.0,Horrible material very think and metal wasnt good ..seemed like more of plastic
1.0,2nd day of normal wear around the house and it broke. The chain is so thin. I wish I wouldn’t have paid so much.
1.0,The shirt fit too small and was see through.
1.0,Sizing was WAY off. Material is super thin and a bit see through even in black.
1.0,Looks like I’m wearing a pillow case.
1.0,Where the canvas is should have a stiff insert b/c the hat doesn't keep its shape at all. Very disappointed. I'd give it a zero if I could.
1.0,This is cheap looking don't even wast your money on this
1.0,"Ok, please read carefully, it won’t let me review both pairs of pants I ordered in separate reviews even though these pants are worlds apart different quality. I am a size 14, 5’10”, 185 pounds and I ordered an XL in both leggings.  I gave 3 stars for this review because I wanted to give 0 for the Camo Pants and 5 for the Silver Sequin Pant.<br /><br />Camo Full Length Legging: ZERO stars, Horrible quality, scratchy material that felt like burlap, about 3 sizes too small and what part I could actually get up my legs turned white when it expanded. (See photo). Thank goodness for free returns! Do NOT buy the Camo ones! Even if you are able to order three sizes up, the material still isn’t squat-proof and feels awful.<br /><br />Silver Sequin Legging: OMG, these are so cute! They have a double silver band around the right thigh that I was worried would be restrictive but it’s not.  They are regular spandex so they fit great all over. The material is thin but not the least bit see through. The waist comes up just below the belly button but not low rider. They are plenty long (I have a 36” inseam) and the silver all over the legging is silk screened on, not actual sequins so the legging is extremely comfortable. I used to be a dancer and these reminded me of the type of pants we would dance in, very good quality and I’m pretty sure they will make me run fast as lightening now! 🏃🏼‍♀️💨⚡️"
1.0,"It took a very long time to arrive, but I knew it would since it was coming from Hong Kong. That was ok. But after opening it I noticed the chain looked very cheap, and the blue heart in the middle was attached or glued in crooked. It looks like something you would get at a carnival or from a gumball machine. Price was very cheap so I guess you get what you pay for. I was curious about Amazon's really low priced items so I ordered it. Now I know. I will gift this to a little girl for her to wear while playing dress up. Or I may hand it out for trick or treat this year for some little girl. She may like it and wear it. I do not recommend this."
1.0,"I got these sandals for my son. They arrived Monday. It's Saturday and the soles are tearing. So, my son is a pretty typical teenager. He's probably a little hard on his stuff. But we've never had a pair of shoes fall apart so quickly. Even the super cheap flip flops you can buy for $2 at the gas station last considerably longer than these!"
1.0,Packing was horrible with only a think plastic bag and an envelope. The posts were bent. One post was almost flat against the earring. I gently straightened them in hopes of getting some use. I’m not sure how long before the post snaps off. Earrings on beautiful but this is an epic fail.
1.0,Way too big for kids or even adults. Would be nice if they offered different sizes.
1.0,Broke on the first day!
1.0,Product was broken upon arrival. You get what you pay for.
1.0,I was very disappointed when I received this hat.  I had purchased it for a friend who has been fighting cancer.  The inside of the hat was completely frayed and would cause a serious irritation to her scalp.  It was also very smashed. :(.  I Had to return it
1.0,Awful.  Cheap looking and poor quality.  Has some kind of cheap rope that is not shown at all in the pic that goes around the neck.  Wth?!!  Very deceitful as if I'd seen that part of it I would not have ordered.  Total waste of money !!
1.0,I got these yesterday and they dont stay on. they just dont clasp well. I think they may have gotten a little bent in the shipping.
1.0,Only one of the three lights worked.  They were a stocking stuffer for my son.  I was embarrassed  that only the one worked.  Should have paid more attention to the other reviews that had the same problem.. There is also no way to open the mini flashlights to replace the batteries even if I wanted to.  So I paid the price for 3 and only had one that worked.  I will update if the seller replaces this item.
1.0,Terrible. Looks nothing like the photo. Don't order these unless you want a cheap pair of cut off jeans that aren't even cut evenly. Returned these so fast.
1.0,I disliked that its missing the metal hoses were the string goes in and it doesn't have a string came damage. It was a gift.
1.0,Biggest disappointment! These rings are total crap. The sodder on them is poor quality and the designs are pretty ridiculous.
1.0,"Too small, thin"
1.0,Shoe popped after 1 month
1.0,"I gave these tanks one star because they are not what they claim to be.  For compression shirts, there is no compression.  I tried one size and they had no compression . I even ordered the next size down. Still nothing.  A slimmer and shorter fit, but still no compression.<br />If a comfortable tank top is what you're after, then yes, buy these, but if you're looking for compression, do NOT."
1.0,The material is weird it's not a cotton sweatshirt would definitely not buy again
1.0,Avoid!  Did not heat up and light did not work on both.  Reviews below are accurate.
1.0,I returned they were huge.
1.0,"This scarf is not as advertised.  It is not large enough to fold and tie around head or neck, as pictured.  This was needed as part of a Clark the Shark school program.  It is so small that it will not fit as a bandana around a child's neck or head.  A total waste of money on something  needed for a school project!  Refund window is closed, so it's headed to the landfill!"
1.0,Ordered this product but the stand did not come with it.
1.0,"Oh my god, this shirt was so freaking huge. Hated it."
1.0,"Ordered a few of these for my girlfriend, she loved the colors and how soft they were, but when she went to wash the first one and followed the instructions on the tag it shrunk more than a full size. She normally wears a small but I ordered a medium just to be sure after she washed the first one it was about the size of an extra small, she couldn't even put it on."
1.0,"It is too small to fit around my girlfriends ankles, she wears a size 9 shoe. Also my girl is five foot eight but only weighs 115 pounds, her ankles are not big."
1.0,Looks like I received the 19 mm version for my Gear S3..gonna send it back and try again. .
1.0,Received different color and size.
1.0,The fabric is uncomfortable ... just double check to make sure you like this fabric
1.0,"Just received my package.  Beautiful royal blue outfit looks as pictured.  As you can see it has been worn...a BIG NO, NO!!  I ordered the 2x and I’m 5’5 195 lbs.  Given the amount of stretch I’m sure the pants would have fit fine. I can’t say for sure without trying them on. Made in China so you have to usually go up a size or two just to get to your size.  Pants look long but I’m sure heels/wedges will take care of that.  So disappointing!"
1.0,Came with a scratch and dirt was in the case.not even worth the wait. Got it because of mirror lense.
1.0,CHEAP!  Did not receive the earrings with the set.
1.0,We had to return these because of the prep quality. These arrived broken.
1.0,I don't like at all
1.0,Cheap quality. Zipper broke even before my daughter could try this on. Just avoid this.
1.0,Bust too small but the skirt is just right.<br />We are sending it  back.
1.0,Within the first hour of using this the strap fell apart. Holds up as well as the football team.
1.0,Returned wouldn’t stay closed.
1.0,"I could probably give you a more accurate description on fit if my daughter could even get her hips through the neck to slip it on. We ordered a size larger than suggested because she wanted a slouchy fit. The neck will fit up to her thighs but she cant step in any further. So, if you have no hips and no butt, you might be able to get this on, otherwise don't bother."
1.0,yuck
1.0,The wallet I receiced was not as described. The color was a light brown instead of a granite color.
1.0,"I ordered a little big, but they were really big so had to set aside for a few months in the closet. Finally they are fitting but within a month of wearing them there are several cracks and now leak. I would never buy them again."
1.0,According to the shirt tag is a small I cannot even used then from how big they are. My husband used a medium and he was able to fit on the size small I ordered
1.0,Ordered the men’s large. They are so small I can. It get them on. My wife can not even wear them.
1.0,They would be nice if the stones were set straight. Both center gems are crooked. I will keep them only because I have no time to reorder from another vendor.
1.0,"I ordered an adult small for my daughter because The ad stated that the sizes run small. Well, i'm 5'11&#34;and the small is too big for me. The dress looks like a huge plastic garbage sack:("
1.0,"Cheap fabric, lays on the body all wrong. Not worth it"
1.0,"Ordered to wear as a cute postpartum dress that hides the leftover baby bump, but it’s just so baggy and unflattering. The cut at the bust is awkwardly high so looks horrible on a large chest. Just feels like wearing a potato sack."
1.0,"Ordered a small for my teen daughter, it was way to low cut and not appropriate for her to wear. It is lower cut than pictured."
1.0,Poor quality. Didn't last long torn apart in couple months.
1.0,My wife loved the ring we had it for a month and two stones fell out not liking it now
1.0,one star because get here fast but do buy they put your fingers green and they break fast dont waste you money
1.0,This broke soon after I put it on. You get what you pay for in this case.
1.0,Not a functional earing. Didn't fit comfortable and did not stay on ear.
1.0,it is tight and matierial sucks
1.0,First wash shrank teeny tiny!
1.0,I wasn’t impressed with this set. I  bought it to wear only vacation in the Caribbean and gonna just throw it out.<br />Bought a medium and bottom is big and the top is small.
1.0,These pants are deceiving they fit way too small even the relaxed fit wouldn't fit a normal size person if you order the correct size I got them as a gift and after 30 days there's no return or replace option Amazon has no contact number so Amazon please do something about this help me
1.0,I wish that I could give NEGATIVE STARS...Soooo frustrating. I ordered these gloves TWICE for my daughter and had to return them BOTH TIMES for the SAME REASON.... The gloves are NOT the actual size that they are tagged as. GET IT TOGETHER...
1.0,"Item was too small, was not packaged well and was expensive to return"
1.0,Felt like a burlap sack
1.0,"Didn’t fit, impossible to unscrew some of them."
1.0,Dress was not as advertised. Short torso.
1.0,The lens is a little to big and doesn't fit in the frame
1.0,I only wore these once and they tarnished and have a metal smell. So the front and back are now different tones. :(
1.0,"Beautiful leather, very well made, and a great shade of red.  A little tight.  I actually ordered a half size up and still a little tight in the fingers (I've worn the same size for years and other brands have nor problem filling properly)  The leather is so supple I think they will stretch out just fine.<br /><br />Update:  2nd time I put them on they ripped right across the middle of the cuff on the inside, not even on a seam.  I have never seen a glove do that before.  Returning.  Do not buy these very cheaply made.  A real rip off!"
1.0,This is a very cheap looking purse.  The lining and zipper closure did not lay right.
1.0,Purchased for a studio 54 party. Cool design but very cheaply made.
1.0,I tried to return the item and can't.  In the trash
1.0,Haven't had it but one month and this happens.  Carried it about 6 times.<br />Can't return cuz it's 2 days too late.  Not happy.
1.0,"This is costume jewelry for a child not an adult.  Shipping took over a month and a half and was so disappointed the picture is very deceiving, the jewelry was plastic. No star!!!!"
1.0,See through!!!
1.0,Ugly style when put on.
1.0,This shirt came and it was literally a crop top at best. It barely covers 3 inches past my chest. I would give this 0 stars if that was possible.
1.0,Very thin fabric. Will not serve as a useful handkerchief. Sorry I bought them.
1.0,They were dry rotted and coming apart.
1.0,"Oh my, they showed up the size for an adult!!"
1.0,Este producto me cobraron 2 veces porfavor de verificarlo gracias
1.0,This bracelet broke the second time my son wore it. The beads went everywhere.  He already gave the pink one to his girlfriend so I can’t return it. He is very disappointed. Very poorly made.
1.0,Wish I didn’t wait to open this until after it wasn’t returnable.  Loathe it.  Never wore.  Trash
1.0,"Don’t remove the tags until you have worn this for a day!  This is just a bra, and not a particularly good or nice one.  I bought it for the purported “posture correcting” feature.  When first put on, it did feel like it was helping to keep my shoulders back, so I removed the tags.  Mistake.  The bra stretched out after a few hours of wear and now offers no support, much less posture correction."
1.0,Was excited to get these glasses because I've been looking for half frames for awhile. They were so cheap and junky. So disappointing. Threw them in the trash.
1.0,"A primera vista me encantó! Luego una vez que me lo probé toda mi cara y mi cuerpo se llenó de pelitos finos propio del suéter . Procedí a lavar la prenda pero igual , seguía votando mucha pelusa por mi rostro , brazos , pecho , etc . No lo recomiendo. Tuve que tirarlo a la basura ."
1.0,The leather straps come loose from the silver part. I bought these for my daughter for Easter and almost every necklace she has made has come loose. Very frustrating.
1.0,It was way to small and had damage in several places! Very unhappy with this item!
1.0,Ordered light gray and received black
1.0,Looked like a wool sweater my grandmother would wear. Not long like in the picture either.
1.0,This product didn't hold up to machine washing in cold water.  Only had it a week and it shriveled up after washing
1.0,Dislike the neckline . Likes the stye.
1.0,Nothing like the picture. Very cheap feeling and unhappy with product. Will not be repurchasing.
1.0,I even read the sizing chart and it did not match the chart at all. Plus when returning the item O have not been refunded after almost a month of waiting for the refund.
1.0,Quality poor
1.0,Listing was for 5 pendants but I only received one
1.0,The whiskers broke/fell off way to easily. You cannot adjust or try to spread them apart at all because the plastic just breaks.
1.0,Within a few trips the handle extension mechanisms on both of the smaller units that I actually use broke.
1.0,I didn’t like the material of the dress it look to Cheap not the right material .
1.0,This item came quickly it was very deceiving . I bought the 2 -4 size since I have a 3 year old granddaughter ! So disappointed I don't think my cats paw could even fit it!!

1.0,Looks pretty cheap when I received it. Was. Or satisfied at all. Never left the house with it.
1.0,Arrived crushed. Returned
1.0,I got a XL and it is way too small. Too tight on the arms and cannot button. There I'd absolutely no stretch. The belt is cute.
1.0,"Yes... they are comfortable, they are soft and true to fit..HOWEVER... they DONOT stay up, constantly sliding down and the seams are poorly made. Sad because they feel great on the  skin."
1.0,Ripped with the first use! 😡
1.0,Not what I thought. I thought it would fit but it didn't. This product was made in China and had China measurements.
1.0,Turned colors disappointed !
1.0,"Don’t buy that dress, i buy and they send me somebody’s used dress, dress is so dirty and very very poor quality so please don’t buy"
1.0,Was too short
1.0,I’ve had these shirts for a couple of months and the neck is already worn out looking on both.  The material is good and soft but I’ll probably be getting rid of these soon.  Would not recommend buying.
1.0,The item that arrived was not what was advertised. It was very disappointing.
1.0,"The sweatshirt quality was just fine.  HOWEVER, it took 2 months to ship it to me and because of that, i was unable to return it - the colors did not work with what I had wanted - and they sent me 2 and charged me to two!  I am unable to send either one back and now I'm stuck with the same ones that I don't like.  I reached out several times to the manufacturer to try to return and received crickets.  So, save yourself the trouble."
1.0,The red bled and the white turned pink
1.0,The key clips broke and I lost some keys...
1.0,"It looked great on my wife, until she washed it, and that's when it started coming apart.that is when it left fuzz balls on all of our other clothes which is not wanting to come off. It shrinks up and lots shape ."
1.0,"This is an ordinary thin leg stocking, worn over the head .... Nightmare!"
1.0,"too small for my wrist, an ordinary average guy"
1.0,I got these specifically because they stated that they were sterling silver they were not they were plastic they bent really easy as well as all of the silver paint chipped off inside of my ear and made them hurt really bad underneath it was like a brown/gray plastic. Do not buy these because it’s a lie!
1.0,Cheaply made<br />Had for less than a month and the sparkles peeled right off
1.0,Lenses had fallen out when I received them and every time I wipe them they pop out.  Very cheep
1.0,"I ended up having to order and reorder for a total of 5, YES,  5 before one worked. I have 2 in a package I want to return and get reimbursed for. First one didn't light up, I called to exchange it. They said keep it and sent a different one. That came and the plastic piece to activate the battery wasn't there, so that one didn't work, I think they just replaced a bad one with one that had already been returned  because it didn't work. Finally got one that worked. Very disappointed."
1.0,Very very small. This should be for a child
1.0,"I went by the chart and it’s entirely way to big. I’m practically swimming in them. Also the fabric is weird and snags easily, and refuses to shrink no matter how hard I try."
1.0,I ask myself over and over why did I buy this
1.0,"Loved the fascinator, but the way it was package?<br />Pissed me off!!!!<br />It was balled up in a 4×8 in box!!!!<br />What did they think &#34;I&#34; was going to do with this mess....<br />The pop ups were flat and the coverup kept rolling up.....<br />Poor packaging"
1.0,I DIDN’T receive the pack of cards that was to be included with the mini album ... I don’t want to return but I’d like for my Pokémon cards to be sent to me . Patty
1.0,The legs fit but the waist band does not stretch enough 2 fit over my normal sized hips. Pants are very ill fitting & seller will not refund.  DO NOT BUY!!!
1.0,"This shirt will shrink immediately after washing it, even using a delicate cold wash, and without drying it. It fit great for the first wear, but shrunk about two sizes after washing and hang drying."
1.0,set doesn't fit as described. waste of money bc I can't wear this.
1.0,"I first ordered a 2XL, it was too small.  I sent it back and ordered a 4XL, and it also was too small.  It actually was the same sixe as the 2XL. I returned both items and will not reorder UNLESS the item is MADE IN AMERICA and sized correctly."
1.0,"Pulled and pilled instantly. Boxy, the sleeves are huge compared to the body"
1.0,Believe everybody when they say it shrinks...wayyy too much.
1.0,"I wont purchase this brand again, blazer, the material quality its horrible and looks super cheap compare to other brands, thumbs down on this one. -F"
1.0,Says 3x fits like lg
1.0,Huge. Ugly. AND I had to pay for return shipping. Will avoid this company in the future.
1.0,"This looks pretty,But after receiving it as I take it out of the package it falls apart.was not happy it will take more time to return it so i bought the links to fix it....NOT HAPPY!!"
1.0,"Very strange material, definitely not cotton, feels like plastic with spandex. Unfortunately I waited too long to return it before I noticed the odd see-through material."
1.0,I am expecting a group of headbands but I only got one and you know it is not the most comfortable thing in the world to silky
1.0,Scratchy and cheap
1.0,"Cute item that is total kitch—you can even plug in your compatible phone from the bag to the receiver & talk on the “phone”!  That said, item was ordered new; item was received broken—the bottom hinges were busted & a poor job was done attempting to “fix” it—completely uneven & wouldn’t close with a cell phone in the bag. The wicker on both sides was damaged—burned? had what looked to be bbq sauce on it & smeared makeup—no joke! Returned ASAP, we were not offered an exchange, so we are taking the refund. If you purchase this item, check it carefully.  Very disappointing."
1.0,The product chain broke 1 day of wearing.
1.0,They slip off you’re head. Pretty material. That is all. Do not recommend at all.
1.0,"Jacket is nothing like what the pictures shows.  Very cheap quality, is not fitted like the description states, the hood does not stay on at all.  Completely different from the product picture/description."
1.0,"This is the third time I've bought this for my Oakley MAINLINK glasses and all three times, I've recieved nose pads for CHAINLINK glasses. They look simlar but have a slightley different shape and it doesn't fit well. The earsocks have a different and thinner material then OEM. They slip off of the hooks and won't stay on."
1.0,"The shoe is too loose. After placing inserts to help my foot not slide, by the time I got it buckled the strap broke. NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO WEAR THEM!!!"
1.0,The chair was extremely small and unstable. Seems more fitting for a child rather than an adult.
1.0,"The rim of this hat is oddly formed. Looks nothing like picture. I've tried to bend it and readjust how it fits, but it just isn't working. Although it was inexpensive, I recommend you save your money for a better hat."
1.0,"the color was burgandy at best, the size was wrong.-dissappointment !"
1.0,Looks nothing like the picture. Fit is totally unflattering.
1.0,My grandson wanted these brackets because he read it would bring good luck. Lol hasn’t yet.
1.0,My son wears 4.5 wide shoes and these size 5-6 slippers are way too small.
1.0,I’m very disappointed. I ordered this dress and this is what I got. And it’s a size XL when I ordered a medium.
1.0,Wrong size in length
1.0,"I lost the gear fit bc it fell out of the band. I bought another gear fit and the new one fell out, luckily, I felt it hit my shoe. I then super glued it to the band. Band has a nice feel, but a bad design. If you thought it hard to recognize the gear fit coming off your wrist, try having it fall out of the band."
1.0,Terrible it is the time I couldn't used it because I am still trying to open it the little ball is very hard to usncrew 😒😖😖😖
1.0,This is a nice wristlet but is not the one I ordered or paid for.  This is described as being 8.5 inches in length.  The one I received is 6.5 inches in length.  I would not have paid this kind of money for a wristlet so small.  Very disappointed and sent it back.
1.0,"The dress looks really different than in the pictures. It's made of a really cheap looking material, like a Halloween costume."
1.0,It was tarnished and broke five minutes after opening!
1.0,I thought this would look exactly like the picture. The colors are different and the length is completely off. Wish I couldn’t even give this a star. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY
1.0,Paint is very sloppy. I was expecting the quality that is pictured and this is not that.
1.0,The neck was not put on wright. Going to use it for a rag.
1.0,Nice material too small
1.0,This print is so cute but gave no stretch. It was very tight in the hip/ mid section (not flattering unless you’re going for the spongebob look) area and kind of loose fitting towards the top. I’m 200lbs.. 5’6.. not plus size friendly IMO. Hope this helps.
1.0,"The material was thin, felt like a table cloth, also had mold on the sleeve."
1.0,The opal red heart detached and fell off within minutes of putting it in and I lost item
1.0,Originally they had xlarge on the site and that’s what I chose. When the dress came it said large. Went back to the item and they charged the sizes stopping at large sizes only. Do not recommend if you regularly wear xlarge.
1.0,Horrible quality. Material was hard and scratchy. Returned ASAP
1.0,Wallet compartment Extremely small and I’m a size 7 and barely put anything in it
1.0,When I received the tags only 5 out of 6 worked and now only 2 work. I admit it was fun to watch the dog’s run around at night with the lights on. It kinda looked like a video game. That only lasted 2 weeks so I had to toss them and purchase another set from another company.
1.0,This product is junk....Every bag had broken lights....The figures were  glued on upside down...
1.0,"If you need a relaxed fit in your torso, and parachutes on your arms, this is your fit.<br />I only sleep in it, because it looks like a complete mess. It also stretches out and gets even bigger as I wear it.<br />Large had the body of an xl, but the arms of a two person sleeping bag."
1.0,This is just a ribbon with a bow attached. There are no clips or snaps to size the ribbon. Not worth $10. Amazon should investigate their description ..literally a ribbon in a tiny plastic container bag
1.0,I have been wearing the small ones pretty much non stop in my second holes since January of this year and they are not Stainless Steel. They have since the beginning turned my ears black and now I can see where the plating is coming off and it looks copper colored not stainless steel. Very disappointed that I received an item that was falsely advertised and cannot do anything about it.
1.0,"IBTC...40A  Yes, some of us plus girls have flat chests. This bra arrived with the unipad (one long pad for both cups) twisted on one side. When I would try to untwist one side, the other side twisted.  Eventually I got it straightened out, but as far as a push up bra... the pad isn't much thicker than a heavy maxi pad.  This bra flattened me out rather than add anything.  There is also nothing to keep it from rolling down."
1.0,Several of these broke just going over my wrist the first time.  Better for a cheap halloween costume not for daily or even regular wear.
1.0,"material is so thin, you cap practically see through it, unraveled after first washing. Does not even make a good rag! Don't waste your time or money!"
1.0,"AWFUL! This is a fake no brand, cheap dress with loose threads and came with a frayed purse handle. This is NOT a Disney item as advertised."
1.0,This material was terrible and was too big at the top.  It was just not flattering at all.  Returned IMMEDIATELY!!
1.0,It was very small.  But I guess that is why it was so cheap.
1.0,"Really poorly made. My son was so excited to get it for his birthday. On the second time wearing the zipper broke, and he can't wear it again.  It also runs on a smaller side."
1.0,awful not even the correct size
1.0,"Ordered a 3X for my husband. Shirt arrived on time BUT it is incredibly small. My son wears a medium to large men’s shirt and it’s too small for him also. When I asked the seller about it, I was told that I didn’t read the description close enough because it’s a Chinese sized shirt, which is “two sizes smaller than US sizes”. Nope. Not mentioned in the description and it’s much smaller than just a two size difference.  It is a nice shirt- but order it four sizes larger than you normally would."
1.0,Small cut not American sizing
1.0,I think I got a faulty pair because I love the other leggings by 90 Degree but this pair fell apart at the crotch seam after 2 wears. I always take good care of my leggings so not sure what happened.
1.0,1 star because I can't go any less. Doesn't even fit close to how it does on the picture.
1.0,100% do not recommend. Item arrived covered in dirt obviously used and nasty I took one look and threw it out. Gross product.
1.0,"My son was really excited to have these light up sneakers however they are horrible. They look cheap, which I’m not shocked since the price was low. The lights only worked for a week! Don’t buy! Waste of money!!!"
1.0,Did not work.
1.0,Fell apart within 2 days of having it. Don't buy!
1.0,"This ring looks like it came from a high end bubble gum machine.  Rings from Ring Candles look like real stones, this opal stone looks 100% plastic.  Not sure how it received such high ratings."
1.0,the color is green not blue
1.0,"Poor quality. Fate of socks worn one time. Ive ordered before, but this batch was the worst."
1.0,These socks run large and are kind of chinsy.
1.0,Very disappointed in the fabric.  Felt exactly like burlap! Ugh!
1.0,small and ugly
1.0,"I ordered a 2X for my husband.,  he has owned several of these coats in a similar style., a 2X was always a perfect fit., this one is too small, short in the waist and sleeves.,  I am returning as we speak.,"
1.0,Would not recommend. The luggage broke on my wife's very first flight using it. She then had to scramble in a foreign country trying to find a replacement for her return home.<br /><br />Picture attached.
1.0,Smaller then described
1.0,Absolutely horrible customer service. Won’t return messages. I’ve had it up to my eyeballs with this place.
1.0,"Cheap polyester, awkward pockets, frumpy"
1.0,"If you like to say you're larger than your actual size, this is just the coat for you! This coat was *supposed to be* a XXXL, ordered for my extremely tall and somewhat stout son. Upon opening the package, we found said coat with all tags proclaiming that it was a size XXXL, but a coat that is barely a size large. With much moaning and gnashing of teeth, the return process was started. Amazon did an amazing job with the return and gets 5 stars for the ease of the process, however, the teeny tiny manufacturer of this teeny tiny coat gets a teeny tiny 1 star for not delivering what was shown.<br />Found a Columbia parka at a local store and was more than happy to pay the extra for the quality and fit..."
1.0,Cheep quality. Catches all dust and hair easily.
1.0,I ordered a medium red wine dress and I got a large navy dress. It even says medium red wine on the package.....
1.0,The color of this dress came out dark blue instead of what shows on amazon website.  Disappointed.
1.0,"When I received the product, it was very cute but the material was like plastic. It didn’t last more than 3 swimming days and it torn apart. See the pictures. I wasted my money. I don’t recommend this shorts, not at all."
1.0,"Well they look nice, but didn’t make driving at night any easier."
1.0,This ball must be made out of something crazy toxic. It melted and ruined the wood finish on my table just by sitting on the surface!!!
1.0,"If you would use a different or thicker white material, this would be an awesome dress.  The current material is too thin.  It isn't flattering for curvy girls and you can see thru it, even with the appropriate undergarments."
1.0,"The locket on the web page looked beautiful, the inscription has a wonderful meaning, and it looked like it was to be a very old and treasured gift.  I bought 4 of them. A friend's son is getting married and I wanted to give it to the mom, daughter in law to be and daughter in law now.  I was so very disappointed in the locket.  It is rickety, the clasp does not close well, and it is not sturdy at all.  It has a cheap tin feel to it, it clanks when you wear it.  I closed the locket; the flat sides went in together, so it was smashed simply by closing it.  I gave one to my little girl.  The first day she wore it to school, it was torn off her neck by accident but the necklace itself was of such poor quality that it was inevitable. She cried. Will return 3 of them.  I would have been very embarrassed if my friend would have gotten them before I saw them.  Everything about the locket looked good on the screen but very poorly made."
1.0,Cheaply made didn’t fit made for a kid
1.0,"These socks fit ok when I first put them on. I’m a size 7 in women’s shoes. However, after washing and drying them on low heat and delicate, they shrunk enough to fit my 2 year old. Now when I wear them they stretch out so much that the fabric seems like it’ll tear at any minute. They had great shape at the beginning and definitely were no show, just what I was looking for, however, the quality of this product in the long run is awful."
1.0,Stopped working after about 30 minutes.. Returned
1.0,The dress seems to be made incorrectly and poorly.  The dress is short and rather see thru.
1.0,It did not fit me at all. The bus is way too small the dress does not stretch at all. The lining is more like a yellow instead of a nude color definitely returned it
1.0,Beautiful designs. Socks poorly made. Last only about 10 times before they wear through.
1.0,Fake Item
1.0,I love Mordernmiss and the style of this blouse. But this blouse is not the same quality workmanship as most of their other items. The sleeves pulled away from cuffs at the seam leaving a gapping hole and both sleeves have unraveled. I noticed other areas coming apart at the seams as well. I took it to a tailor to fix but was told even if they re-sewed the seams it would happen again and in other areas of the garment. I am hoping I can get a refund or exchange.
1.0,"What I want to say I can not write here, it's that bad!! Don't waste your money!"
1.0,"I was excited to get this in the mail today until I opened it and saw that the tag/label had been CUT OFF the scarf.  WHEN I felt the material, it did not feel like 100% cashmere as they state on here.. Needless to say, my return label has already been printed and it will mailed back first thing in the morning!"
1.0,Not even close to being as large as the photo shows. I'm 5'9&#34; and the sleeves hit me at the elbows and the back of the top hits mid butt. Bummer.
1.0,"Ordered 2x received maybe large. Way to small. Material was weird, not the same at the other two I ordered. Oh well regifting."
1.0,"alarm stopped functioning after 2 days of using it, buttons doesn't feel good when pressing it."
1.0,"This shoe came in the perfect size for my son 7.5US but the shoes came and one of the shoes lighting did not work, I looked and one of the cords to the light button was broken and there was no charger in the box for the shoes! smh! I will not be repurchasing anymore items from them!"
1.0,Way too large... I think order two sizes down. They are stretchy too... Material thick nothing like the pic 👎
1.0,"Size runs very small, asian size"
1.0,These socks are super thin and poorly made. They arrived with thread already coming loose. Don’t waste your money on these.
1.0,The dragon broke off the earpiece after 4 wears.....
1.0,they are cheap looking and cheaply made. Would not recommend.
1.0,I couldn’t give them away!! I originally bought the mess again for my best friend and usually enjoy statement pieces she could not stand to look at these she said they were so hideous he wouldn’t be caught dead and then I tried to pawn them off on various other people even people I thought could pull it off still didn’t want these I would save your money and make something yourself it would probably look better than these do.
1.0,Horrible quality! No pockets and runs very very small! Wanted to not give one star but I had too :(
1.0,"I ordered a large because I am busty. All of my other swimsuits this style are a size large, I have about 6 but they are not this brand. There is no way the sizing is accurate because it didn't even cover half of my breast. I had my mother who is a s/m try it on and it still didn't cover everything a top needs to cover."
1.0,"Too see through, sent it back."
1.0,The quick release pin is a hair too short for the Garmin Venu. It's fallen off twice now
1.0,I was told by my jeweler if it does not say mossanite on it it will not test mossanite. So does this one is the question. I took my diamond tester II and my diamond tester P7 and he told me neighter would test moissanite so is he right?  What does it say in the instructions mine said it would not.
1.0,Did not like the material or the fit. I returned it.
1.0,"Useless product. The hat is tiny, doesn't even cover ears.  If you look on the 4th picture down, they have photoshopped the hair over the person ear because mask doesn't actually cover it. They have also used mannequins with hair covering ears to fake the effect. This can only work for a toddler.<br />The front mask is attached in a way as to further expose the ears and keeps sliding off. I'm a woman and my head isn't even that big.<br />The mask portion is too big in the neck area and too small in the nose area, so keeping it on is painful. I have had to construct additional pieces from fabric for this to work. The ugly logo in the middle of forehead with this already atrocious construction makes the experience of wearing this deeply shameful."
1.0,dont buy this it is japan size
1.0,"The arms were tight no stretch, I ended up cutting them."
1.0,"Ordered a MEDIUM for my tiny 4'11"" 11-year-old daughter and it was BEYOND too small. Don't walk - RUN away!"
1.0,Received this one as a replacement for first one ordered and the credit card holder has ripped out. Only lasted a few months and order says return date is past!
1.0,an XL was size 2?  what is going on?
1.0,"Spelling errors, misleading, poor manufacturing"
1.0,Shirt is short and the arm pits are huge.
1.0,"I love the look of this ring.  I wore it for 3 weeks when I noticed that the silver band had split apart right in the center of the back--it didn't show when viewing from the front.  Usually, when that happens the temperature of the heat while casting the metal was too high.  The metal breaks apart easily."
1.0,the neck tickles your chin and the dress is super large and baggy not what the model looks like
1.0,was small and cheaply made
1.0,"We tried these twice. The first time my toddler handled them, they broke. I was watching and he was not rough with them. So I decided to give them another chance, maybe it was just that pair. This time he fell down. They broke instantly and gave him a black eye. Why didn't we just stick with Babiators?!"
1.0,Horrible opal is coming off
1.0,Doesn't Even stretch. I purchased my regular size and I couldn't even get it up my hips
1.0,"I ordered a 18 slim, the pants didn’t have a sizing tag on the inside. It’s look like a men size 34"
1.0,Garbage.... Very thin and unfinished
1.0,"Just aweful. I waited a month to get them, just to find that they were nothing more than stretchy cut fabric. They weren't even sewn on the ends to keep them from fraying. They dont even stay in place. What a waste of money and time. Huge disappointment."
1.0,It came very small and very bad quality
1.0,Not strechy and the elastic bands hurt and the thumb hole cut into my thumb
1.0,Very rough around the neck line. Itched and scratched really bad.
1.0,By far the single worst waste of money I have spent in a LONG time.
1.0,The first pair was great but then I lost one of them so I bought another pair and they are so cheap. They came to me all bent out of shape and it's not the same thing. Very disappointed.
1.0,sent wrong order. haven't returned money back yet.
1.0,Bought this for a nose ring and it came insanely smaller than expected.
1.0,Loved the look of the bag and asked for one last Christmas. It lasted about 2 months and the entire lining just shredded  😞  Planning on looking for a purse insert/liner to ask for this Christmas....
1.0,poor quality fit
1.0,Can't really comment on the fit as I couldn't get the dress on.  Too small to fit over head and shoulders.
1.0,The large fit like an extra small. The sleeves aren’t quite long enough. The fabric retains odors.
1.0,Cute dress but the top splits open and shows your girls😩U have to wear a shirt underneath
1.0,The fabric did not fit the description. Top layer of fabric looks cheep. Two different fabrics.
1.0,Less than one star. This shirt is very low quality and cheaply made. The buttons were barely sewn on and one was almost completely off when I opened the package. It is also very short and boxey. I ordered a medium.
1.0,"This is a very nice looking watch, but very cheaply made. .  I dropped it from about 4 feet, and the crystal shattered.  I have over 100 watches, and I have never had this happen before.  I have only had it a couple of weeks.  IT does not come with any warranty. They said that they would fix it for $50.  Seems a little steep."
1.0,Color wasnt has shown in picture
1.0,"I'm big, like 2X, and usually Buykud dresses fit me fine.  But this dress was way too tight in the chest."
1.0,I am 5'7 160 lbs and the small swallows me. The material is cheap very disappointed.
1.0,"Used the key chain about 8 months then it fell apart, It look like a quaility unit but didn't hold up"
1.0,"Horrible, the paw prints started to wear off in 3 days. ."
1.0,They were damaged before even used. Don't buy
1.0,Disappointed. Clasp doesn’t stay in place. Comes undone. Multiple times in a manner of minutes.
1.0,"I’m a teacher and I bought this backpack to use in the new school year. After only four days of use (carrying only my laptop and a notebook), one of the straps broke.<br /><br />I ordered it in July, and the return window closed, and now I am stuck with a broken backpack despite the fact that it didn’t survive less than a week of use."
1.0,Great fit but quality isn't great. 3rd time wearing and threads unraveling. Wouldn't recommend.
1.0,Dress came in sky blue instead of royal blue. It is not the dress that is pictured. Will never order again
1.0,Ordered 2x more like a large.
1.0,"the fit is just weird, nice design but the fitting is horrible"
1.0,They are the worst
1.0,Order xxxxxxlarge from China
1.0,"The x large jacket I ordered is about the size of a medium.  I liked the jacket otherwise, except the zipper is on the left side like a woman's jacket."
1.0,The material is shiny and weird it’s literally a completely different piece of clothing that the picture . Trust me just don’t even try it . Save the trip to returning it.
1.0,Was really cute if it fit
1.0,Ordered a set of 2 evil eye Rakhis and only received one. Very disappointing.
1.0,Sock tan small and the cuff was not as high as pictured
1.0,"Ordered this when there weren't any reviews and knew it was a gamble. The product arrived with someone elses hair on it. There were black marks on the fabric, and I found at least one hole in the fabric, as well. Returning this immediately."
1.0,"We should have read the previous review before ordering. My daughter ordered this and has the same issues. Cover up is too short, no symbols on the back, the buttons do not open in the front.. very disappointing."
1.0,"Figuring this is a keychain, I expected the back side to be consistent with front, meaning truly 3d in complete sense.<br />It's not like earrings or whatnot that you may get away with flat or empty backside.<br /><br />Having said that, I would've been still happy enough if the hummingbird didn't look so awkward & ugly.  The beak is overly thick, long, and out of proportion in shaped of zucchini.<br /><br />I may even tolerate THAT if it had cute circular eye. Instead, you see what you see in the pic.<br /><br />Bottom line, complete and total dissatisfaction.  I won't use it, may be someone will want it because return isn't worth my time esp. after submitting this review."
1.0,This is a 2mm braided nylon rope.
1.0,"This product is &#34;paper-thin&#34;, and it's not for frigid winter in my opinion.  Unless you want a helmet liner, this beanie is not worth buying."
1.0,"Poor quality, dislike"
1.0,"Not very happy with this. Have already ripped the hem out as it was too short as the small did not work for my 5’5”, 118lb frame.  I see those shrinking incredibly as the pant part (aside from the waist) is 100% cotton.  While the pic is super cute, this just doesn’t look good. If I had not taken the hem out hoping that would help, I would send them back.  I bought others that were polyester for cheaper that look a lot cuter. Will iron them and hope to get a wear once or twice on vacation. Don’t expect to wear them after."
1.0,Poor quality lenses.
1.0,"Always turned over, grabbed onto everything and terrible quality."
1.0,Large was short. Tight and not very stretchy. More like youth sizes.
1.0,"Post are too large on these, and they bent of the first day. Amazon refunded our money back and told us to throw away the product. Do not buy these even on me an adult the posts were digging into the side of my head."
1.0,"I was very excited about this top. However, I returned it as soon as I got it. I ordered a Small after reading reviews that said this top runs big. Even with a Small it was like a mini dress! There were also several white spots on the inside and outside of the shirt. Very disappointed."
1.0,These pants would have been cute if they would fit they run 3 sizes to small and on top of it when i got them all the belt loops where ripped off. Also my package was 3 days late and i have amazon prime and yet still couldnt get them on time. I have tried to return them but it is impossible to do so. I am not happy at all about this.
1.0,This is trash! It is a cheap shiny material so ugly.
1.0,"The band (under the bra cups) rolls up immediately after putting it on and feel so uncomfortable. The size fit fine, a 2x. If I got a 3x, it might not roll, but the cups would be too big. Alas, my search for the perfect bra continues. Sending this order back."
1.0,The dress came almost to my ankles and I am 5'3&#34; other dresses like this that I have bought came to my knee or just below.  The next was right up against my throat this was horribly made
1.0,"The description to these socks says &#34;little girls&#34; so I was buying these for my toddler daughter.  Received these and they were definitely women's size 9-11!  Gave one star because  tHe quality and color looked great, but had to return as they were way too large!"
1.0,It took a long time to come plus It looks nothing like the picture the tutu was super thin I would never order from this seller again
1.0,"Cheap, looks nothing like the photo. Smells of a chemical something fierce. Can I return this for a refund?"
1.0,Tarnished after wearing a few times. Wouldn’t recommend.
1.0,"Horrible! Fake reviews, don't buy it."
1.0,Could not wear. Too small.
1.0,"This product is very very far off on sizing. I normally wear a medium, this shirt will likely fit my size 6 XS daughter."
1.0,The trident is a tad shorter than expected. It is very poorly constructed and I had to super glue the top to the pole 2 min after taking it out of the box. The gold paint was chipped all over and continues to chip. I would like to add that after this review the company reached out to me with excellent customer service.
1.0,Was not impressed. The material is like a shiney spandex and very unforgiving.
1.0,Not worth it! Nose pieces don't even align and half of the glasses were scratches.
1.0,broke in 3 weeks the hinges  are cheap  i would  never buy this again  over priced for what it is
1.0,This boots were beautiful and fit perfect!! BUT the very first time I wore them they started peeling. I had them on for 2 hours at school and that was it! Huge waste of money. I’m so sad because I really thought I’d love these!
1.0,So bummed! I always wash clothes I purchase before I wear them and this poor quality shirt didn’t even survive ONE wash and dry! The image is chipping off and I never even got to wear it...
1.0,Demasiados pequeños p mi gusto
1.0,buckle will not stay on
1.0,I thought there was embroidery on this dress. When I got it I realized it was just cheap print. Material feels spandex. I really did like it. Had to return. I would recommend looking elsewhere.
1.0,Returned! Wrong style for me!
1.0,ZITY's sizing is indescribably ridiculous. Amazon was great and handled return fast and easy. Don't buy this shirt unless you need an extra large....or order an extra small if you need a medium.....maybe!
1.0,Not happy its broken when i received this ring
1.0,Band feels nothing like the original. I ordered a large. I put the band on and it’s not even the right size. The package must be marked wrong. I compared old size and new band not even close. I can’t even get it off to return it without wrecking the new one. That’s a waist of 12 dollars.
1.0,Promptly fell apart.
1.0,"I ordered the extra large, but still too small. Quality is good, but sizing is off."
1.0,For $10 they're extremely cheap quality. They bend so easily.
1.0,"These socks were described as able to fit men's shoe sizes 6-12. The recipient I bought these for wears a size 11 shoe. These socks were laughably much too small.... they looked like they were for boys. Though they were soft and cozy, I can't give more than a 1 star rating if you can't get the size description right."
1.0,This is not like the picture. The bottom is crop and does not have the same hemline as the picture. My sweater is uneven (bottom) and the sewing is frayed.
1.0,"Love the design, but the clasp broke off quickly."
1.0,I bought a 2xx  washed and dried it once and it srunk down to a large
1.0,Junk! Starts to peel the coating away within a few weeks of my dog wearing it.<br />Wish I could get a refund .
1.0,This heart pendant is very cheap looking.
1.0,"Already have a pair. Blue lenses, like them a lot.  These came in purple."
1.0,Arrived broken. Was retuned for a refund.
1.0,These are the cheapest shoes ever. They may be cute however they are poorly put together. My toddler wore them for 3hrs the bow came off one shoe and the shoe separated in the front like it was talking. BRAND NEW SHOES. How????
1.0,Hinge broke on the third time wearing them.
1.0,Not happy the earrings have broken. I have sent an email .
1.0,Too narrow.  Fits too big. No cushion. Fabric too thin
1.0,"The shirt looks nothing like on the pictures color,fabric and fit are off. Feels and looks cheap. I would not recommend it"
1.0,They were ripped when I got them. I want a refund.
1.0,Made badly the emblem isn't in the middle of the grimy of the cap
1.0,"Grommets fell out after one wear, leggings are completely see through which would be fine if they weren't supposed to be 'pants'. Im so sad i wasted my money, i thought this would be a nice addition to my wardrobe but turns out they're just garbage. If i wanted ANOTHER SEWING PROJECT I HAVE PLENTY ALREADY. DO NOT BUY."
1.0,Not what I expected. Too tight. Not at my liking.
1.0,This watch lasted a grand total of 24hrs. Don't waste your money.
1.0,It does not do what it says it does . I could not get it to flip and stay the way it shows on the picture at all.
1.0,These slippers bottoms are made of cloth..if you're not walking on a rug you can kill yourself with these cheap slippers
1.0,"Very thin, bad quality"
1.0,The ring message fell off..... Poorly constructed
1.0,"These are so so cute but my daughter only used them twice and all the glitter stones fell off, so definitely not worth the price."
1.0,Tried but it didn’t when our
1.0,"Its super cute, but broke the first time I put it on today. Hoping I can find a chain small enough to replace, but I'm going to have to cut the broken chain to even get the cross off. So sad, because it was the exact style I was looking for."
1.0,Don't waste your money it is cheap! Broke in 1 hour.
1.0,"We bought this for a wedding, he normally wears a 10/12 so i bought a 14 just to be safe and he can’t even get the pants up past his legs they are so small. The tie is also broken."
1.0,"I did not like these pants for lounging.  For me the waist sat too low causing my lower back to be exposed when I sit.  The legs are too long causing the bottoms to bunch at the bottom.  They did shrink quit a bit making the length of the to legs fit better, but with the short waist they just were not comfortable to wear. I am 5'7"" and have a slightly long torso and legs. I usually like longer pants but these were way off in length."
1.0,I was surprised that even though they were loose on my they were still very see through. Ended up returning
1.0,"The<br />Size is not true, too small"
1.0,"This came late. Is not a sweatshirt, very thin AND says to handwash! Terrible product but my teen decided to keep it. Would not recommend. We bought a large so it’s over sized."
1.0,I bought the Large size and it fits a small size person.
1.0,"The distance from the base of the mock turtle neck to the bottom edge of the front of the sweater is only 10"" maximum. That is not even long enough to cover my breasts. The image that is posted online clearly depicts a model wearing a sweater that hangs well below the waist. Completely incorrect"
1.0,The bows fell off while unpacking
1.0,This item is for very petite women.  It barely fit and only comes with about an inch leeway for the attachment.
1.0,"While it is mostly cotton, the shirt feels like plastic.  It doesn't feel like cotton."
1.0,"Extremely thin, see-through material. Not at all the right expected size. It couldn't even be tied around the front - I ordered a large and I wear a US size 10 normally. Don't waste your money!"
1.0,"These rings weren't exposed to hand washings, lotions, perfumes, etc. And yet within a week one of the four was so completely tarnished it was unwearable. Within the month, all are too tarnished to be worn.<br /><br />Reviewers are excusing the subpar quality  because these are  &#34;silver plated&#34;. I have several silver plated pieces I paid less than $5 for that I've been able to wear a few times per month over the past year that don't look this tarnished. Silver plated isn't an excuse.<br /><br />Beautiful presentation: Velvet drawstring bag, black ribbon."
1.0,This dress definitely doesn't have the &#34;flattering&#34; shape that is shown in the images. I always wear a medium and this one fit like an XL on me. Returned.
1.0,Band already broke. Cheap material and cheaply made.
1.0,Liked but two small
1.0,Very disappointed in this product for as much as I paid for it. My daughter tried the outfit on and there were 2 good size holes in the neck line of the costume.
1.0,"I hate it because it's too small. I read the reviews and ordered a 3x, I wear a size 16. The 3X was more like a size 9! I gave it to my niece. I will no longer order clothes from Amazon. I am tired of giving them away because the size is not a true size!!"
1.0,"Cute but tiny...too tiny to close, therefore cannot wear."
1.0,"I m in Colombia, so I ordered this item to a box mail that I have in USA, last week I received my sunglasses in Colombia,  when I opened the carry box I found a good product but the sunglasses coming with some soft thing in front  of the pad nose and this off of the frame, si I couldn't send back because i m In Colombia"
1.0,"Not full as it's pictured here, more of a head scarf."
1.0,I wore this one time.  After just one hour there were 11 snags.  So badly I had to leave work to go home and change because the holes were exposing skin.  I work a desk job.  One of the snags came from a small hang nail.  You sure get what you pay for with this.  I highly suggest not buying this sweater
1.0,"Material is awful, feels like a heavy thick, polyester.  Also very large in fit.  Phots seem edited to make it look better quality than it is.  This was a return."
1.0,I had this necklace for about 2 weeks. I went to turn it so the clasp was in the back and the chain snapped completely in half.
1.0,Advertised as a tragus but not made for that as it does not stay straight.
1.0,The watch is completely plastic except the back cover . I was very disappointed and to lazy to request a refund so I threw it away into the garbage . Im going to pay a few dollars more and buy from the store real steel .
1.0,The color was terrible on me!!!
1.0,Cute top but very short. Not ideal for tall women.
1.0,Cheap junk. Lost top gem within 2 days.
1.0,Junk. Arrived in a manila envelope. Most of the links were stiff and would not swivel. There were scratches on the clasp despite a protective covering on it. The end links had so much slop and play that they were nearly impossible to get the spring pins installed. Overall very poor quality. You get what you pay for. Will be returning.
1.0,Very cheap construction... I am returning
1.0,Item came in with TWO stains. Highly disappointed.
1.0,"The jade leggings are NOT AS DESCRIBED. They are polyester and spandex, NOT nylon and spandex. I have a navy blue pair that are nylon and they are much softer and more breathable."
1.0,Read the reviews. It would fit a child. The bib is only 1/4 of what I need it to be.
1.0,Can way too small. I am a small to medium in sizes and this outfit came basically as a size zero. Definitely order up in sizes if you're interested.
1.0,These earrings kept falling off my wife's ears. She had to bend the prong in order for them to stay in her ear. Then she had to bend it back in order to remove them
1.0,"I had to return this product.  I had the proper waste size, but the legs were not proportionally sized and couldn't get it up to my waste.  I'll never purchase something like this from the internet again.  I'll have to see it in the store so I can try it on before purchasing."
1.0,"Wierd odor, airing it out in the sun"
1.0,VERY BAD PRODUCT I WANT TO RETURN ASAP!!!!!!<br />It felt a part
1.0,to tiny to fit in the ear and cheaply made
1.0,"Arrived with one month until expiration. Ended up with very bitter, no crema espresso. I wanted to return, but it's not an option.  What happened, guys? Usually love Segafredo coffees for their rich smoothness."
1.0,Poorly printed graphic; waste of money
1.0,"I'm 5'5 125lb and this was too small for me. It was way too short, it barely covered my butt. Not flattering. Returning."
1.0,Cheap the gems do not stay in the bar. Very poor quality
1.0,Sent them back - too wide
1.0,Horrible quality. Paper thin and like tights. Fit is very small too.
1.0,This is very small and a very cheaply made product. It’s also not the same color as in the pic
1.0,Way too big for me and I’m 5’8. 226 lbs
1.0,Once pulled into place they stretch out snd continuously roll down.
1.0,Completely see through material.  Too thin.
1.0,Rips along seam
1.0,Bought them for my fiancé for Christmas based on the size of her other numerous pairs of leggings made by a vast array of companies and these aren’t even close to being able to fit her.
1.0,This was suppose to be a size small and it would fit a large woman. It was way too big and boxy. Very disappointed!
1.0,Terrible quality.  Not realistic.  Can't see out pf eye holes.  Scam alert!  Can't even return for free.  Must ship back to China.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!
1.0,received the wrong keychain. not worth the hassle of replacing or returning.
1.0,Only one horn lit up on each headband. Disappointed
1.0,Colors aren't as expected to be and doesn't fits as it's supposed to
1.0,"Got these for my 13 year old son who wears an 18 normally and these were extremely small. They are probably equivalent to a size 14 slim. Also they are very thin, like they may tear or rip easily. Had to return."
1.0,Fabric is extremely thin. The V-neck in the pictures/on the model looks longer than what you actually get.
1.0,these pants smell terrible such a strong plastic smell do not buy tried to return and is still pending a request for two months
1.0,Couldnt even get the magnet inside my nose. Total waste of my money.
1.0,I have has these for less then a few months and they are already falling apart. The seller should replace. This is ridiculous.
1.0,"The item (boys compression pants) is labelled as a 2 pack. Two pack implies (at least to me) that the order would include 2 pairs of pants. Nope. You only get 1 pair of pants. Dishonest seller/ misleading title. Low stars for seller, not item.<br />Pants haven't been worn yet, but they feel nice though. Should do a decent job of keeping little legs warm during activities."
1.0,I have been wearing Barton Perreir<br /><br />a Mens frames for many years and have several frames. this was the first Amazon purchase and received them bent and out of shape when placed on my face. my optometrist for the past 25 years after putting in my prescribed lenses worked for an hour in trying to fix the frame .<br />an impossible task after I  spent  $250.00 for new lenses<br />THESE FRAMES YOU SENT WERE DEFECTIVE BENT GARBAGE. !!!!<br />WAITING YOUR RESPONSE BEFORE I PROCEED
1.0,It stated that this watch was for middle aged and elderly woman. The face is much too small for that
1.0,I am very disappointed with the quality of the oensie. My son has wore it twice and two of the snaps have fallen off. He now can't wear it at all
1.0,dont bring it into water it will turn to rust
1.0,"This is my first swimsuit I have purchased since I became Plus sized about 2 years ago. I have only been wearing shorts and an oversized shirt if the occasion for a swimsuit ever arose. I was very excited to receive this ProEtrade Women One Piece Swimdress Plus Size Swimsuit Swimwear Bathing Suit. To finally build my confidence enough to actually purchase and then wear a swimsuit again after so long. I'm so extremely disapointed I probably won't even attempt to buy another suit again. Ever. I read the size chart, I read the reviews to make sure the size chart was accurate. It doesn't fit. I chose the Black dot swimsuit size 16. Which as I was reading was the size I needed for my height and weight. It doesn't fit. I wouldn't wear it in my house all by myself let alone out in public. My weight and height is not any different from any of the other reviews I've read, or the size chart says should fit. So I'm not sure how I received a suit so ill fitting, when it seems like most the reviews on here are positive saying for a 5'6&#34; with with a bigger chest this is great for. One of the questions even states, &#34; I noticed in all of the pictures that the women were more &#34;endowed&#34; on the top than I am. Will this suit work for a smaller chested woman?<br />Answer: I believe the suit will be ill fitted for smaller chested women. There is plenty of material to cover up the chest area. You don't get that squeezed in feeling. Being larger on top, this suit does offer comfortable support. &#34; The little cup of the top of the bathing suit didn't even fully cover my chest. I was falling out. It was uncomfortable.<br /><br />No. Definitely not. Pretty sure it's for smaller chested women. Or smaller than me chested women. Wouldn't purchase again. Wouldn't recommend to anybody. Wouldn't even approach the subject. I'm happy for everyone who did find that it fit and worked out for them."
1.0,"Does not fit, hurts"
1.0,He advised it is too snug.
1.0,Fall apart
1.0,"first day of my gym , leggings ripped. such a shame.  couldnt finish my work out . some guy at gym told me that it ripped, it is terrible. bad product dont buy.!"
1.0,"My husband bought me 3 different colors of this style.  Not a very flattering fit.  Bulky stitching connecting the skirt to the waistband, bigger than a normal small.  Colors are nice.  Returned all 3."
1.0,Hate em. They’re horrible. Do not buy these at all.
1.0,"The dress looked completely different from the pictures. It was 2 different materials poorly sewn together. The ""ruffles"" at the bottom was a completely different material from the rest of the dress. I ordered a large and it resembled a robe on me... by far the worst purchase from Amazon. Luckily I was able to return with no problems."
1.0,Did not realize it was a silky material..not too fond of that. And the arms are alot longer than should be for the size..not 100% pleased but not worth returning
1.0,Shower curtain material. Do not buy
1.0,"Poor design, shorter than expected."
1.0,Way to thick was hard to breathe in and didn't have much stretch
1.0,"I ordered these in 2014 and really liked them.  After many washes they held up well.  I used them so much I wanted another dozen on hand.  What I got in 2015 is thin, synthetic fabric instead of the thick, absorbent cotton terry cloth I got before.  A vastly inferior product.  As I wore the first one, in less than an hour the stitching came unraveled.  These are almost useless as head sweat bands."
1.0,I felt like a cupcake. I was hoping it would just go straight down.
1.0,"Wife wore it for about an hour before every single piece broke one by one. I was so shocked it was that bad.  I know you get what you pay for, but during a 7 min walk, the choker fell off my wife's neck with the chain broken, then a min later an earring broke like the metal was THAT fragile and thin.  The hand piece broke a few minutes later and she was just walking/standing.  Wish we could get our money back since she wore it for about an hour. Ridiculous."
1.0,this watch won't work and it is cheap I ordered 1 watch and got 2. Don't have any way to send them back. HOW???
1.0,"The lenses are nice. However, the squeeze mechanism is very poorly designed. It sticks out right next to the bridge on your nose and makes it virtually impossible to squeeze and take them off of your glasses. You have to take your glasses off to remove them. I would not reccomend these."
1.0,"This sweater looks nothing like the photo. The color is more creamy, the fabric is different and the fit is off. It fits like a normal sweater not an oversized chunky sweater as seen in the photo."
1.0,The hat was torn looks like one of the vent holes
1.0,The package said birthday cake charm which is what it was supposed to be but I received a #21 charm didn’t have time to return it had to make some stupid excuse to pass it
1.0,size is different~~~ not 2mm
1.0,Product looks like picture. I would not recommend the watch. The time will randomly stop. Changing the battery does not help.  Flawed product
1.0,"Worst sweater ever, IT WAS SPLIT DOWN THE SIDE WHEN I RECIEVED IT... couldn’t even wear it."
1.0,Cheap cheap cheap. Arrived with moisture under the watch face. Stopped working in less than a week. Save your time and money and don't bother.
1.0,He just didn't like it.
1.0,Broke in half within a week.
1.0,The jacket was the right length but the material felt cheap and horrible. I immediately returned.
1.0,Did not like this. Returned it. Picture shows it to be black and it was not.
1.0,3 of mine weren’t rose gold they were tarnished and ugly.. wish I didn’t actually need one of them or else I would send them back 😔
1.0,This is the worst quality ever. Cheaply made it and terrible fabric quality. Don't waste your money.
1.0,The material is very cheap and clingy. Not like the picture! I'm 5'5&#34; and 112 lbs. I bought a small and it was way too big on me.
1.0,"Nothing fit , cheap material, do not waste your money."
1.0,"Piece of junk. Built like tissue paper, the holes aren't all punched out and the one I use is already stretching. I bought a different brand 4 years ago, $4 more, and it's as good as the day I bought it. Should have stuck with the same brand.  This strap is so flimsy I have trouble feeding it through the buckle."
1.0,Worst
1.0,It’s just strange I feel as tho I’m in a moo moo goes in at ankles and really heavy pulls is all the wrong spots
1.0,"I would probably really like this product if they sent me it as described. Came with only one key ring, but the description specifically says it comes with two extra rings.  Not sure if they have terrible quality control, or if they figured I wouldn’t notice. Either way, I won’t buy from them again."
1.0,"I got my pair of Bombshell leggings in the mail with a hole in the butt area. I wish that for almost '$90 I would have received a quality pair of leggings but was very disappointed. They fit 'ok', a little big in the waist. I ordered a size medium."
1.0,"quality not good,,,,, logo omega !!?????"
1.0,"Horrible quality! The image is so pixelated and distorted you can only see it properly from 10 ft away. Very cheap iron on image, not screen printed on shirt. Don't buy."
1.0,Pretty pendant. Poor craftsmanship. Only wore for a few hours when it fell off the chain somewhere while I was out shopping. Waste of $25
1.0,Product arrived open and used seam is across cup looks awful.
1.0,"Poor quality, uncomfortable, worst fabric, dont waste your time/money. Strange style"
1.0,No control and horrible VPL.
1.0,I thought this was going to be all different sizes of the earring because that's what it seems like in the picture. Slightly disappointed because it was only one pair. May return.
1.0,"Too thick, big and combersome but would be good for catching feral cats or other aggressive animals.<br />Waited to long to return"
1.0,Says it’s a winter coat but it’s more like a jacket
1.0,Don’t purchase. Turned my finger green.  Cheaply made
1.0,"I ordered according to the size chart, the recommended size for me, and my usual size I order, which were all three the same, 2X, and usually fits loose.  The top was way too tight. Material was also strange, not breathable at all. Also had a strange smell. Also not a 3/4 roll up sleeve.  You get what you pay for. Took a chance on a $7 top and this time I lost. Sending it back."
1.0,Shoes were not true to size and were needed for a wedding and I had to run out last minute and find another pair
1.0,If your planning on ordering 0-6months...be prepared to recieve an outfit thats equivalent to a 2T. My son will not be able to wear this forever!!!
1.0,"too tight, small"
1.0,"Way too short, very cheap material."
1.0,Bad material. Tears easily
1.0,I ordered a size bigger and the top was still too small.  I like the material of the blouse.
1.0,Wristlet is way too big. Almost as long as a lanyard
1.0,They are sooooo bad. Size is way off and product rips - avoid!!!!
1.0,Wore twice before the batteries corroded.
1.0,too small for anyone older then 4
1.0,"I bought this dress for a work dinner and I was really disappointed. 1) it didn’t come with the tie belt as described so it lacked the pretty shape which it would have provided. 2) I am quite busty and curvy so I purposely bought it slightly larger, depending on the belt to make it look nice. And there was none. 3) the neckline slit stands up so nicely in the picture but the material the dress is actually make out of plus the way the slit is done, it doesn’t actually stay that way. It curves back, like a collar and thus due to me being busty it was far too revealing for a professional setting. 4) it took longer to arrive even with my prime shipping so now I have 3 days to buy a new dress... and it’s thanksgiving weekend so I don’t even have the time to go shop."
1.0,Flimsy earrings. Would not last
1.0,"The skirt too big, the top too small,  size is very misleading"
1.0,Nice looking watch but made in China and it only worked two days. Took it to a jeweler who also said it was a nice watch. Put a new battery in it. Still did not work.  The seller said he was giving me a refund. Mailed it back yesterday
1.0,Sizes run very small - about 2 sizes smaller.
1.0,This jumpsuit was not good quality the bottom was all bad made
1.0,"This mask is made for a baby, I have a 6 and 7 year old and it was very uncomfortable, didn't cover their nose and pulls on their ears."
1.0,The ring arrived really tarnished. There were black marks around the band in several places like it had been soldered multiple times.
1.0,This aren’t real K94.  There are counterfeit.  Way too large and seems if the maker made them out of paper towels.  No protection whatsoever!! Do not buy!!
1.0,"Terrible boots for snow and melting snow my toddler feet got extremly wet, very disappointed with this boots"
1.0,Poor quality. Broke in 2 weeks
1.0,"I'm on my third one of these bags in a year and a half. Luckily I've only had to pay for it once. But that doesn't matter. The first time,  the wire that gives the bag its shape starting poking out from under the bag stabbing me every time I slung it over my shoulder . The Second bag had the same issue. Just opened my third and last one to find out the shelves are sewn into the bag all wrong. Both shelves are inside the mesh zippered panel instead of one being inside and the other right below it. Poor quality control. I'm going back to the OGIO LOCKER BAG when this one self destructs. Wish I could get me money back to buy the OGIO."
1.0,The band fits fine and doesn’t look bad but the the two bands on either side of the watch is where the problem is .. as you are wearing the watch the outer decorative bands on the outside of the watch press on the buttons and turning on siri all day long so now in forced to look for another band without the side bands
1.0,My husband order this for me for Christmas in an XL.  I ended up giving it to my daughter that is a size 2 to 4.  It fits her perfect.  I'm not sure how an XL qualifies for a size 4!!!  So disappointed in the sizing.  It was a beautiful skirt.
1.0,The dress faded significantly after a few washes.
1.0,"Cute, but arrived with a hole in a seam on the arm. Arms were also oddly short. Will have to return bc of the hole"
1.0,Viene una más chica y una más grande lo de arriba a una se levanta mucho muy ancha se ve feo
1.0,"Que cosa mas fea. Ni siquiera tiene la manecilla del segundero, obviamente no funciona."
1.0,They feel great breathe great the price however for a single pair is insane
1.0,It’s very thin and extremely to big for my face!!!
1.0,"The posts of one of the earrings arrived bent. I tried to bend the post to the straight position, perpendicular to the surface of the earring, and it broke off.<br /><br />The earrings are very pretty, but unwearable.<br /><br />The earrings were shipped in a soft box with inadequate protection for the posts. If the package is put under any pressure the posts can be easily bent.<br /><br />I contacted the company. They graciously offered to arrange a refund, and did so with shocking speed, even though it was well past Amazon's return date.<br /><br />BONALUNA has great customer service."
1.0,"Not what I ordered! Pic 1 is my order with 3 bras: Grey, black and white. pic 2 and 3 is what I got. 2 bras. Look nothing like the picture. I didn't take them out to try them on because it's not what I ordered!"
1.0,I was very disappointed because this is how my earrings arrived. I packaged them back up and returned them immediately.
1.0,"They are cuite but they broke the first time I used them,."
1.0,"So disappointed with this product. The style and mustard color are cute, but it is poorly made. I wore this to a nice lunch out and within one hour of wearing it the seam of the right pant leg ripped open. So embarrassing and a waste of money. Save your money and do not buy."
1.0,"Belt I received was nothing more than trashy pressed vinyl. It is garbage costume store quality. Something one would expect to pay $3.99 for, not $50. Company is lame for scamming this junk as &#34;genuine leather&#34;"
1.0,"HATE them, I'm a sixe 16 a 2x should fit, MORE than fit. Sorry I bought them, not impressed, beware, DO NOT BUY"
1.0,"So i ordered a XS and I am 5 2"" 110lbs and i was one too short for it and two it was still too bigg for me and three the fabric is a bit sheer so you could kinda see my underwear  0"
1.0,These are not workout shorts they don’t stretch and the inseem is so low that you can’t even move your legs far enough to walk let alone workout…
1.0,Received a completely different dress...
1.0,My first impression was that they are pretty however after wearing for a couple days three of the silver balls came right off of the posts and the 'silver' has turned dark and dis-colored on the posts where it is in contact with skin.  I haven't even tried the other two pairs on assuming they would do the same thing.  I wish I had tried them out right when they arrived because now it is too late for me to return or get money back.  Don't waste your money- these don't even deserve 1 star.
1.0,"All of the blue came off in a day, very cheap quality."
1.0,Very disappointed with the time of order to the time waiting for it. I don't recommend it at all. Don't waste your time and money with this seller.
1.0,Ordered my usual size and had to return it because it was waaaaay too small
1.0,I wish I could give negative stars! This outfit was a major disappointment. Looks nothing like the product picourse. Very cheap material! The material is very sheer and show EVERYTHING!! Don’t waste your money or time! Glad I had a backup outfit for the occasion I wanted to wear this outfit to
1.0,"Cute shorts. Unfortunately, didn't pay attention that they were Velcro and not tie up. After they got wet, they just slid down my child's body."
1.0,I don't like nothing about it. It fits too tight on my  body. You should add a buyer beware discretion for this item in the description.
1.0,The product I received is not what is pictured. The masks will not fit over an adult's chin. Far too small and absolutely not what is shown in the pictures.
1.0,I had read that this runs small so I ordered 1 size up.  I normally wear a large or xl.  I ordered a XXL and the fit is way too tight across the back and arms.
1.0,dont waste you money
1.0,Way way too small sent it back
1.0,"If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Weirdly sized and too big in the waist. They are also really cheap, thin material. They are as see-through as tights, so free show for everyone if you wear them to work out in ha! (5’9” 150 lbs, ordered my usual size, M)"
1.0,Not near as pretty as the picture
1.0,"Read these reviews! The letters are so small. It looks ridiculous- this is worse than an iron on for a school project!<br />Returning - oh and not a free return, so be prepared to pay for this mistake.  So disappointed"
1.0,Is not that I think
1.0,Too small. Quality not good.
1.0,This holder is too short the glasses stick out too far. It isn't made the best either.
1.0,Was hoping these would be better.  The color/paint chipped after one day of wear
1.0,These pants we're too small I'm 32 5'3&#34; 158lbs most weight in tummy and the band part was real snug the legs were just right tho but that's about it!! I gave it to my 10yr old daughter she loves em she's pretty small so these did not work for me but my 10yr 4' sum daughter loved em so I guess its good it didn't got to waste
1.0,Pins to set watch all fell out after less that 10 uses
1.0,size of a sports bra for xl
1.0,No got what i paid for. Instead got a woman top.
1.0,Horrible meant for a kid
1.0,Runs small I returned to the seller. Get a size up.
1.0,"So disappointed. This is my 3rd pair of Goodr sunglasses and I won’t buy them again. All 3 pairs of sunglasses, you can see it start to peel on the inside of the lens. I’ve only had them 5 months and apparently the South Florida weather is too much for them to handle. Update 1 month later: The outer lens isn’t durable either as you can see the outer layer beginning wear. I love the fit, I just the lenses to more durable. I have a salt water pool and water got on the lens over the weekend. I rubbed it with my finger and coating flaked off."
1.0,The piece I received wasnt even steel. It was a cheap bendy plastic piece. Highly disappointed in this.
1.0,"I received this item timely and the fabric is pretty soft. I wore this around the house for about two hours before I decided to put my phone in my pocket and it went straight through. Yup. The pocket was not sewn together so it's completely useless to have a zipper on a pocket that can't hold anything. Bummer too, because the fabric is super lightweight and soft. I got these for summer runs, and unfortunately, they are useless since they can't hold anything in the pocket which was the whole point. Won't go through the return process on something so cheap... but I can't recommend this product to anyone."
1.0,Got because of the sale. It doesn't meet my expectation. Run too small and it is not a good quality.<br />Be careful the size run small
1.0,Poor quality. Looks terrible after the first wash.  Order it big.
1.0,Very cheap material I will be returning.
1.0,"Had 2 pieces of plastic (I assume for magnifying) and I couldn’t see through them at all, it was like looking through greasy lenses. I returned them promptly.  My other reading glasses in the same strength work perfect.  I just wanted smaller glasses I could look over for distance instead of taking the ones I have now off and on or looking over them with my head tilted."
1.0,"This was broken when I received it, the cameo was unglued and loose but the packaging showed no signs of distress or abuse, it looks really cheap."
1.0,This shawl was paper thin and had loose strings where there shouldn't be
1.0,"Cheap quality, not true to size, returned 👎👎<br />I would not recommend or buy again."
1.0,This product was too small for me & even for my 8 year old daughter. It also smelled like incense pretty strong.
1.0,Bought the largest size and very tight in the breast area. i'm a 38DDD
1.0,"When the package arrived the paper tag was not attached to the socks and it seemed like they had been opened before. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and threw out the packaging, only to discover that the never worn socks have holes in the heels! I am very disappointed in the quality of the purchase and would return the socks if I had not thrown out the packaging."
1.0,"Cute, fits right. Some, little, tummy control - but they sent me a completely different swimsuit. I want the one listed with the spaghetti strap on both sides."
1.0,I loved these bracelets so much and was going to ask for more for my birthday but then noticed a kink in one and then the other and I only wore twice so I will be returning.
1.0,Received a giggle in a flimsy mesh pouch. I ordered this especially because of the case which will prevent it from scratching in my gym bag. Returning it.
1.0,Dont waste your money on this . Disappointed in product
1.0,"I tried it one day, it like any other day! It’s a waste of money! Do not buy it, find something else that’s better!"
1.0,I’m typically a 1-2x as I yo-yo a lot. This didn’t fit my “skinny” friend who is a size m-l. The material is weird. Way too small. Not worth it at all.
1.0,"These are not working.  They absolutely don't stay on and after just 15 minutes wearing it, I had to take them off because they kept slipping off!!"
1.0,Sterling silver is all I can wear that doesn't hurt or inflame my ears after wearing for 1 hr had to remove due to pain and inflammation
1.0,El primer día se le callo un tapón cito del agarradero
1.0,Material and color are nice but set is too snug
1.0,Never goes to the waistline
1.0,These are not laser safe. Someone could easily go blind trusting this seller. This is insanely dangerous.
1.0,"The worst, cheap material. Would return if I didn't have to pay for it. Thought I would give it a chance even though it was inexpensive because I liked to print. Mistake. Don't bother."
1.0,It dosnt fit my hand an i got the smallest size
1.0,The pockets are in a ridiculous place.  They start at your ribcage and end at the top of your hip making the tunic looked weird.
1.0,"Denim is still bleeding color after 10 washes! Too many streaks , colors uneven."
1.0,The clasp on these earrings was so poor that the first time I wore them I lost one only gave it a one-star because it wouldn't let me submit my review without it otherwise no stars
1.0,"these are HUGE, like embarassingly big. i wouldnt wear them."
1.0,"So after my beloved dog of 12 years passed, I ordered a 2-Pack of this pendant so that my mother and I could both have some of his ashes close by since we had him cremated. First of all even though I was charged for 2, only one came! This was so disappointing because it left my mom without a necklace before we had him cremated so we had to spend the entire day before his cremation searching jewelry stores praying we could find one in time for her. Secondly, the one that did arrive broke once I opened it to remove the urn to place the ashes. I had to crazy glue it back to protect my baby's ashes. This item is such a disappointment and I wouldn't recommend unless you want to risk losing your precious ashes. If I could give zero stars I would."
1.0,I ordered an XL based on other reviews the top was smaller than expected. I bought a L similar suit last year from a different seller and the top fit fine. This suit is SO small. It’s probably between the sizes ‘small’ and ‘medium’ and no way is an XL. I’m pretty disappointed as it’s really cute. Guess I’ll be returning it.
1.0,"No lo compren, solo te gastas tu dinero y es de muy mala calidad."
1.0,This product is not true to its size.
1.0,"First the dress arrived rolled up in a clear plastic bag very wrinkled. The dress was huge. Not true to size at all. The material and overall look reminded me of my grandma's drapes. The cups around the breast area felt like cardboard. I gave it one star, because it arrived when promised. Would not recommend."
1.0,the ball broke on the second day and grabbing the card does not work when I try to put the card out of the pinch is a total failure I lost my money.
1.0,"I ordered this product on April 20th or the 21st, and it did not arrive until May 2nd. This would not be a problem normally, except that I actually had to pay for shipping on an already overpriced item, and it did not arrive in the advertised window of April 25th-28th. I needed the item as a gift for the 29th, and I will now have to mail it to the intended recipient late, in fact I would not have bought it if I knew the shipping would be so slow. Nice necklace though."
1.0,The color is not the same as in the picture.
1.0,Fabric was cheap and super wrinkled. Not at all as they make it seem.
1.0,"This case will not look good for long, it is paint and mine came already scratched! As a Cowboys fan this is not how I want to represent my team. The company has not responded to means of yet on a fix for my issue. I will keep you posted."
1.0,very very cheap. the material just feels like something from the dollar store
1.0,Item runs small and the fabric is very itchy and uncomfortable.
1.0,Cheap!!!!!!
1.0,They come to big and the bow doesn’t look right
1.0,"the sizing was very small, so I’m disappointed that I can’t wear the skirt this summer."
1.0,Definitely not True to size.
1.0,Broke in like a week :’)
1.0,it's nothing like it was described. It’s too small and it's cheap plastic.
1.0,I Returned this necklace! I loved it in the picture but it was very different when it came! The sun looks like a gold metal in the picture but was painted on with yellow paint. The dark black looking mountains were actually a gold color. Not at all as advertised! Cheaply made!
1.0,Came broken I’m not returning them
1.0,The fastener (little metal knob) pulls out of the band when you take it off and is a pain to put back in. Real time waster when your trying to get ready for work.
1.0,The fit is off especially on the shoulders.  I have all this extra fabric hanging off lol.  Don’t waste your money!
1.0,"I'm sure the dress pictured is very nice, but that is not the dress I received. It was also larger than I expected. Will return."
1.0,This was a joke. I ordered one size up from my normal large to a XL as the reviews suggested.<br />I laughed out loud when it arrived! It looked like a youth sized small.
1.0,"Way to small. The suit fit me everywhere else but the bust part barely covered my chest, and I DO NOT have boobs, like, what so ever. Don't get me wrong, I love having small boobs, but this top did not cover like it does in the picture at all! so if you are going to order, make sure to do it a size up or two."
1.0,These were to rough for me they irritated my arm.
1.0,I wanted it like this hat but it ended up being too uncomfortable to wear. If sat at an odd angle rubbing the skin on my forehead and causing skin irritation.
1.0,"Oh, I am supposed to review the hat and not the team.  Team sucks, fans the same.  Hat is good quality, would be better in ""Big Blue"" colors!"
1.0,Dislike: the back clip was rusty and bleed onto the hat.
1.0,Regretfully these sunglasses arrived without cloth or case in the description. They had fingerprints on them and they looked like someone tried to hard to get them on and returned them making the hinge very flimsy.
1.0,Runs way small and is super cheap.<br />We weren’t looking for much based on price but this wasn’t even worth the $ we did pay.
1.0,So disappointed. Looked like it was stitched together in a class by new students :( poor fit! small pockets misplaced bad weird fit :(
1.0,The tongue is just slightly too short to reliably engage the other piece when putting on the wrist so it falls off frequently. POS.
1.0,"Not worth the money, they are soooo tiny about 1/8” of an inch!"
1.0,I bought one of these and it worked once.  I could not get it to work again.  I returned it and got a replacement.  The replacement had a defective male USB plug and would not work.  After trying 2 that were defective I decided to give up on them.
1.0,The color wiped off of these using the microfiber cloth after only 4 days. I don’t know if they were just defective but the Merrys sunglasses I typically buy are half the price and the lenses stay intact for a long time. Very disappointing and certainly cheap.
1.0,This dress was nowhere near as expected to be. Definitely would not recommend buying. Thin dress. Very unpleased. Hope this is helpful
1.0,Should have returned . Did work and one want stay inside any shoes
1.0,"Horribly quality, design, and sizing."
1.0,This is supposed to be for adults but was the size a 7 year old would wear.
1.0,0 stars  please do not buy waste of money
1.0,"Crappy would not purchase this product again, would not recommend."
1.0,Sewn poorly. Very cheap looking - doesn’t line up symmetrically.  Have to return
1.0,"This was not at all like the picture. It appears to be a soft, light blue, pattern. Instead the color is blue and grey with thin gold lines. It’s all polyester Which makes the dress appear cheap. What I wanted was a light cotton country dress with a light cornflower blue design. Instead this looks like a Cheap 70’s throwback. Not worth it. Better to buy the real thing second-hand."
1.0,Purchased one pair from a store and they were way too big.  Purchased here and were a size too small.
1.0,The dress is made of some type of plastic material. It feels like a picnic table cloth and it’s very cheaply made. I did not order a sauna suit but that’s what I got.
1.0,"RIP,  very  bad, the first day"
1.0,"My daughter loves this backpack but now, after it’s 10th day of use, the zipper totally broke!  And of course I’m 3 days past the 30 day deadline to return it.  Soooo irritating!"
1.0,"Very cheap material, shows white underneath"
1.0,Make sure you buy one size larger than you are because they never sent replacement socks.
1.0,The screen print is so awful!!!!! It is stiff and has a plastic/rubbery feeling.
1.0,Not what it supposed to be! For someone skinny trying to tone up there body!
1.0,I used the yellow sunglass for one day and it broke immediately.  I tried to use these sunglasses as delicately as possible but one of the screw from the handle got loose easily and it broke<br />Very disappointed with the product.
1.0,Both pieces are starting to breaking and there is a blue color in my skin after wear the swim suit
1.0,They are a slim fit
1.0,No es realmente el tamaño que se dice
1.0,Charm fell off hours after i first wore it. Dissatisfied
1.0,I ordered my regular size but was too small.
1.0,Everything broke after 2 weeks.  Cheap crap!
1.0,Missing one of the straps so it’s pretty much useless
1.0,Broke the first time I wore it.
1.0,Están muy reducida
1.0,What can you say.
1.0,Cheaply made!  Design is not embroidered only stitched at few points.  Do not buy!
1.0,This is extremely thin material. Quality just isnt there.
1.0,Didn’t look at all like photo!
1.0,The clasp fell apart on day two.
1.0,Very distorted and distracting glare within the the sunglasses. Very disappointing.
1.0,"in the picture that advertise to this product it shows two necklaces as in the picture above, but i received only one necklace. where is the other necklace. when i order it it didn't say it's only one nicklace."
1.0,had a really bad odor  Smelled like dead fish
1.0,Very poorly made. Has a weird shape and 100% sheer.<br /><br />Looks very awkward not at all like the picture (structure-wise)
1.0,"The material was thin, wasn't like the others I ordered. The size said 4x but it had to be a 1x. I couldn't get my arms in it."
1.0,This product was sent to me destroyed in pieces through the mail. I'm NOT a very happy camper that this item was delivered to me in this condition. I'm very angry and disgusted that this item was shipped looking like this.
1.0,I like the way they look but frame broke with in a few weeks.<br /><br />none left as frames all cracked
1.0,"While this is a cute shirt, it is thin and not a sweatshirt. It seems like maybe some kind of brushed nylon. It doesn't even have a tag so you know what fabric it is. I washed it before wearing it the first time. It looked nice. After the second washing it is already pilly and disappointing. It looks as though it has been through the wash a hundred times. If you plan on wearing it more than once, don't waste your money."
1.0,"This was advertised as LADIES' sizes, but arrived a CHILD'S size 5X!!!"
1.0,Don't waste your money. Stone has zero opalescence and it came loose after wearing it twice.
1.0,"The picture looks really cute. However upon opening the package. The fabric was nothing like I thought it might be. It feels like cheap sheets. I washed it thinking it might soften the material but Nope. Won’t be wearing it ever again, put it in the donation box."
1.0,Cheap piece in junk. It’s more like a general dollar store toy.  And it can NOT be returned .<br />I paid $18.00
1.0,Looks like a potato sack.  Poor quality fabric.
1.0,Frustrating... cute pajamas but I only received 1 top instead of the 2 pictured.
1.0,I was not impressed with these wings at all. The quality was not up to par. I did not receive the headband which I need for an event in 2 days. This package was also delivered to the wrong address but thankfully the home owner brought it to me!
1.0,I gave this to my son as a birthday present and he put his belt buckle on it and snapped it and both snaps fell off!
1.0,"This belt is not like what's in the product description.  It is a leather belt but that's as close as it gets.  First, the sizing info is way out of whack.  This is a standard belt and you should order your regular size.  Second, the buckle is not replaceable unless you cut some stitching.  Third, there was no punch included for additional holes.  Fourth, the leather is not hard like one of the reviewers stated- it's soft and unlikely to last any longer than a regular belt.  This is just a regular standard belt like any other.  If you like the style, go for it.  If you are looking for something a little more in a leather belt , keep looking."
1.0,"Too tight. I am 5'1, 114lbs 29in waist.<br />Too tight. Too tight, too tight.<br /><br />Very odd fit. Have to wear the waist way up high for the length to be correct.<br /><br />Material is strange, not lined.<br /><br />I try them on and put them back and try them again. I dont think i can wear these"
1.0,"I ordered my size (based on their chart) and it wasn't even CLOSE to being big enough!  Like 6 full inches away from closing!  Additionally, this thing is absolutely NOT as long as the picture depicts. Boo all the way around...returning."
1.0,It does not fit my cut....i gave it away....it was cute and made prefect....just not for me....looks just like pic.
1.0,The sweet 16 fell off the first time she wore it
1.0,"Great looking shoes but dangerous, I have hardwood floors and my kid can’t walk in these shoes ."
1.0,"I was so excited to purchase this earring because it looked like a perfect match for my holiday outfit. It arrive broken. It was packed in regular big envelope without any padding a. As soon as I open the package, one of the CZ stone fell out. See the pics. Very cheap! Not worth $12."
1.0,If I could give it a zero I would terrible dress none of the measurements were right. Just over all did not like the dress I wish I could get my money back!
1.0,Fits way smaller than it should. Looks nothing like the picture. There’s not even a neck line it’s a tiny cutout with a piece of fabric sewn between and the fabric is too long so it’s droopy. So ugly. Will be returning
1.0,The elastic band was all twisted and it was sewn so tight that I couldn't untwist it. Material felt sorta nice but mine was all scuffed.
1.0,Not satisfied lining already separating from threads.
1.0,Product fit like a belly shirt. So disapointing
1.0,I truly loved the look of this when it actually stayed on my arm...It unlatched many times and I lost it one day..oh well
1.0,Ripped after one use.
1.0,Do not buy it's not accurate sizing at all I got a 00 and they're definitely not 00 wayyy smaller sucks ☹️ I was really looking forward to these. I'm really really sad about this
1.0,Female part of the thing came off the first time I tried to put it on.
1.0,It came in a Ziploc bag it was smashed and creased in horrible condition sent it backSmashed increased
1.0,These pants were too big.
1.0,The dress is very ill fitting and is very wide below the waist.  The material looks and feels very cheap. Waste of money.
1.0,"The shorts where a great length and fit but the stitching was odd and bulged out, creating an unflattering hem below the waist where the shorts hang at the hip."
1.0,This skirt is thin.
1.0,hasn't even been through more than a dozen or two wash cycles and the material used to print the pattern on the fabric is just flaking away and disappearing. Using overly gentle wash and dry settings. horrible knock off of a traditional large hankerchief/bandana.
1.0,I do not like the feel of this fabric at all
1.0,Necklace broke right down the middle after wearing it for only a few hours
1.0,Really cheap stone that broke within 3 days of having it. My fiance was so excited and then heart broken when it broke!
1.0,My dog chewed one off and I found the clip still hanging on his collar. Chewed up disk some parts missing (maybe inside him)
1.0,Poor construction  fell apart.  No customer service response
1.0,They were broken when I received them. 😕
1.0,if your tall and want a long hoodie this aint for you ordered a medium sized hoodie and was too short ended up giving it to one of my friends
1.0,It was not true to size and very cheaply made. It will be returned.
1.0,"I ordered this and had it shipped overnight as I was going to an outside event with rain forecasted and I needed a rain jacket. The rain did arrive and I was soaked! There is nothing waterproof about this jacket! If you're looking for a light weight windbreaker, that's fine, but it will not keep you dry even in light rain!"
1.0,"be aware: if you want to return the bowties, there is a charge for the return. It is not like most other items on amazon that have free returns. I did not realize this when I purchased them"
1.0,It didnt look anything like the picture.  Also this is a red dress not burgundy.
1.0,"First use, zippers broke. Seriously, FIRST use. Have to return now."

1.0,"Don't stay tied, cheap, feel like plastic"
1.0,"don't look like the picture,  very thin material , arm sleeve are to thin as well,  they don't cover much of my arms"
1.0,Sorry to say that it is of such poor quality that I could not tell that it amethyst.
1.0,"I am busty 38D 150lbs 5’4”. Besides the fact that it didn’t look right on, the stripes have cutouts so it’s sort of see through. You buy a suit like this to hide imperfections!  This was returned."
1.0,"Tried to return product too small, vendor said I have nothing to return"
1.0,It was not true to fit sent back two weeks ago hVe yet got refund
1.0,Too tight. Material very thin.
1.0,"Nice product, but broke off the secure ring as soon as I put it in my keys.  Not sturdy enough."
1.0,"Very pretty, but won’t last longer than a couple of uses."
1.0,"Did the other reviewers have stretched earholes??? The part that you insert into your piercing is HUGE and THICK and hurts like a bitch. I don't know how no-one else has mentioned this? I wish I could return these. Otherwise, they look like a good quality pair of earrings but what's the point if they're too painful to wear?"
1.0,"These are very flimsy bracelets, break easily and they look like they are made of beads, not chakra stones. If you are looking for costume jewelry, then buy these because they are pretty, but if you are looking for chakra jewelry, look elsewhere."
1.0,Cheap AF<br />Doesn’t stay on unless held in place
1.0,I sware I didn't know the silver part was glittery. Gah what a waste of money lol still cool for a female though
1.0,"Watch wasn't working when I received it. No response from seller so I had to figure out how to open the back of the case to see if it was battery. Then I had to buy some 377A batteries to see if it was the problem. A new battery corrected the problem. For a cheap watch, it isn't bad. Just aggravating."
1.0,"Well, if you're truly an XXL (particularly with a large bosom), you can't wear this. I can't wear it. I thought it would be stretchy enough but it's not. The fabric is soft & thick, so thick in fact that it would have been too hot for summer nights in Arizona anyway.<br /><br />It's only about one size too small, unless you like your pajamas to be roomy. Size up once to fit, size up twice for comfort."
1.0,Poor quality cheap looking
1.0,Very bad quality 2 times use it and it is damaged do not buy it<br /> They get damaged with nails<br /> Very delicate fabric
1.0,I used these for about 5 times already. And they still cause the ball of my foot a lot of pain while I cycle with good form. I would expect me to get used to them by now but the pain is so unbearable. These are probably great shoes for others but not for me.
1.0,I received these as a gift. Several pairs came with holes in them and several more didn't last beyond the first washing. The quality of these socks is horrible. Don't let this &#34;deal&#34; fool you. Pay a little more for socks that will last longer
1.0,"Product very cheaply made. Fell apart the first time I wore it. Tried to fix it but chain kept breaking in pieces. Finally just threw it away, not worth trying to find a new chain. A waste of $8.99.  Also, much smaller than pictured. The item pictured is twice the size of what I received."
1.0,"The fabric does not feel like cotton to me at all.  The masks are too small for an adult to wear and should just be advertised for girls. I wanted to return these masks but was going to have to pay shipping-disappointed in this purchase, will be giving these to friends who have young children as they are useless for myself and two teenage daughters."
1.0,"Too short for a size too big, front ruffle is stiff and looks like babydoll (not in a cute way). Cheap, stiff, non-silky fabric which doesn’t look like the picture in the slightest."
1.0,"Cheaply made, bought for my sister and she couldn't  make it fit"
1.0,Was really wanting this dress but its too long and the dress in olive is totally see through.
1.0,"The dress is pretty but cheap made and for me personally it's sized funky. Maybe if I had giant boobs it would've worked. I did as the site said and ordered a size up but the dress only fit in the waist and hips and was WAY to big in the bust and I'm a 36D so if you order a XL and weigh 175 at 5'7"" tall like me get a large or have DD+ BOOBS and get a Xl."
1.0,Not pleased with this purchase. The watch is not working at all.
1.0,The color is completely different from photo and I'm underwhelmed by quality.  The stitching on the sleeve came unravelled. I'm also not sure that I would call this a blazer.
1.0,This item must run in Chinese sizes because it is way smaller than advertised. I had to send it back.
1.0,"The straps are too small to completely wrap around an adult's head. However, it fits my teenager. In my opinion, this mask is ok to get for an older kid or teenager."
1.0,Cheap looking and not worth the money
1.0,Se rompió el primer intento de uso 👎
1.0,I bought this product for the renaissance festival. I am typically between the Jean sizes of 6-8 so I bought a size Medium. Which did not fit me at all I couldn’t get it over my thighs and I have an average build. I’m 5’4 and 150 pounds so I will not be keeping this item I am returning it.
1.0,"The teeth are too  rugged for fine jewelry, any jewelry really."
1.0,This dress is not flattering at all. It fits weird and is uncomfortable. I’m returning it.
1.0,The sweater is colorful but very thin material.
1.0,maker must use different sizing methods
1.0,"This is a really pretty dress - if it fits right! I based my purchase on the sizes that the manufacturer described, but it did not state measurements for the upper chest and the arms. The upper chest and arms are too small. The zipper was also not sewn right. You couldn't zip it up or down without feeling like it's going to break any minute! Too bad! The design was really so beautiful! I am glad I chose to buy this dress with free returns."
1.0,It does not look/fit at all like the picture. Small and not flowy. Very disappointed and do not recommend. Will be returning.
1.0,Hi I really want to return this product . I used twice and then the zipper broken . I can’t  fixed .  And I can’t ever retuned now since the window returns of Amazon police it’s closed .  It’s no fare for stuff the we buy and got bad  in a few used . I just putting my money on garbage . 🤬🤬🤬🤬
1.0,"The dress looked like the picture in design and cut, but didn't quite fit the same. I did end up returning this one, but mostly because the fabric was so cheap and rough. I think I would have had skin irritation if I wore this for a whole evening."
1.0,Love this so ordered another but it never came and Amazion would not refund . They order delayed numerous times . I reached out numerous times but was only told I could reject shipment . Disappointed
1.0,Had a strong urine smell to it! It was totally unusable...
1.0,These were for a costume and were super cute but broke right away.
1.0,I ordered Medium and I think you tag it with Medium size but it’s actually a Small Size.<br />I already ordered Large and Medium sizes in different colors (Tye Dye) and I’m returning the large size because the Medium size fits very well. Now this Red Floral says Medium but in reality is a small size. Please be careful in putting your tags. If it is Medium then it should be the actual size Medium. I don’t want to feel very disappointed because someone is not putting the correct size. Thanks.
1.0,Don’t like skinny ties.  I’m almost 71 and don’t feel like a teenager.
1.0,They were great for the first 2 weeks. Until The color of the skull changed. It's not very appealing after that. I took the skull off.
1.0,Never tried it on. This product looked like it had mold on/under the overlay. I returned it !
1.0,"Way to thin, see through had to return them."
1.0,"Don""t buy it bleeds all over my sheets"
1.0,This sweater is so short that I sent it back. Didn’t fit at all like the picture portrays.
1.0,The worst choker ever! Mine wasn't even on the clasp evenly. One part of the necklace was bigger than the other. The quality is so cheap! I didn't even try to refund it because it's not even worth it.
1.0,"Material is transparent and cheap, badly made, for one-time usage."
1.0,"Tiny, broken when arrived"
1.0,Not linen!! The cut is very unflattering as well. Very stiff and straight in the legs. No flow. The color is also not as expected. Very disappointed in this purchase 🙁
1.0,They roll up. Not worth the price. There is no return allowed because I tried. Better off at a sport store.
1.0,The item very small not worth it
1.0,Not the size that I want
1.0,Looked like a beautiful dress and I tried it on for the first time and the straps snapped :( I was super excited to try it as well.
1.0,CHEAP. Very disappointed in the product. They literally printed out the wings on poor quality paper and simply laminated them. Spend a bit more and get better quality online.
1.0,Not as illustrated. Horrible. Thumbs down on this one.
1.0,bu fan  kuan  yi  tian  yi  tiao  cha  ping  yao  chu  li  jiu  jia  QQ:1836772232
1.0,Appeared to be cheaply constructed and did not fit!
1.0,"I love palazzo pants and needed to replace a few pairs that were getting worn out. The brand I normally buy were out of stock, so I decided to give this brand a try. When I received my order, I was dismayed to discover that the waist was too small. It would have stretched and fit me fine except that there was a zipper and so the stitching would not allow the fabric to stretch properly. Glad I only bought 1 pair... I will not be buying any more of this brand. I wouldn't have bought it in the first place had I know that there was a zipper!"
1.0,So small! And thin material!
1.0,Wrong top came.
1.0,Bought my size based on the size chart...too small! It also kept rolling down. I can't wear it.
1.0,Not an every day bangle. Scratches and tarnished like crazy. I’ve only been wearing mine for two days.
1.0,Returned because they were too small. Designed in China for Chinese man.
1.0,I have no idea how this product has five stars. This product does not work at all.  I would give it is zero if there was a such thing. Do not buy and do not believe any of the above reviews.
1.0,"These are paper thin, and the visual quality is highly suspect. After trying then for only a couple hours I had a massive headache. Setting then aside for a day, tried again the next day with the same result. I will say they are the correct shape, and they do not fall out, despite the thinness allowing a bit of back and forth wobble. For the price I was not surprised, and I bought them more as a curiosity than anything, but I won't be using them even in old ""beater"" glasses."
1.0,This tights did not last long. Started to form holes
1.0,Flimsy broke crappy
1.0,It’s that non Stretchy  jersey under armor material. Not comfortable do not recommend at all
1.0,Fell apart within two days of wear - buy a different option!
1.0,I order an 3XL and it was way to small. I order two hoodies of the same size one was small and short but this one was smaller that the first one. Most of the items you find here in amazon are from wish and they come from China and are very small.
1.0,Me agrado solo la apariencia al principio pero a los días se pusieron peor que un arito de fantasía varato no se porque dicen que es plata de ley cuando no lo es una verdadera mentira estafa.
1.0,do not purchased this  throw to trash can。
1.0,i am large and ordered xl but the dress looks like small-medium. material looks cheap
1.0,3 pair were already broken and just loose beads....I don't expect the others to last even one wear.
1.0,"Black and white part looks wash out, cheap looking"
1.0,"If I cloud give it 0 stars I would, it worked once then broke."
1.0,The material is so bad that it looks dull with bubbles on it in just 1 wash.<br />Not at all worth the amount i have paid.
1.0,Product was not baggy per correct size.
1.0,Best bra I ever wore until two weeks later it fell apart while running errands then had to run home after zipper unexpectedly broke and they were running free.
1.0,Terrible print quality. Looks faded and worn. Ordered these for our business hoping to pass them out to clients. Super disappointed.
1.0,"Very cute, arrived with one earring broken though. Probably need better packaging on something so delicate."
1.0,"These turned my ears blue-green almost immediately.  One of the stones fell out a couple days ago.  I know it’s a cheap product, but they’re really bad quality."
1.0,Bought to put on mocossin soles..way to stiff
1.0,This bracelet is way to small for a man's wrist
1.0,I ended up having to return the top because the seems started falling apart after only wearing it twice.
1.0,"Delivered on time. They are uncomfortable at the sole of the foot because they are too small, if the bottom part was wider it would protect the whole anterior part of the sole of the foot making it more functional. Not a good buy."
1.0,I was expecting a sweater. This item is more like a long sleeve t-shirt that is cardigan style. I returned it.
1.0,Not at all as pictured the size is ridiculously small
1.0,"I normally wear a 1x, so bought a 3x as I like them loose, it was tight and can’t wear and  no paperwork as where/how to return!"
1.0,Very poor quality.  Poor sewing on the shoulders with material all bunched up at the shoulder seam.  Do not buy this.
1.0,"They came broken, the diamonds fell out. I tried putting the stones back in but they fell right back out again"
1.0,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible!<br />Received item super tarnished, actually black! It took me a half hour to clean before I could give them as a gift.<br />I know silver tarnishes but it shouldn't be received as new in the box looking so terrible! Very unhappy customer!"
1.0,I like the sticker but what you get for the price is very cheap!  I would not recommend buying this product to anyone.  Its very small and cost no more than 20 cents to make this. Very displeased.
1.0,"Very small, not for an average adult male foot, I returned."
1.0,Very cheap quality. Super thin. I’m 5’1 about 150 pounds. Ordered a medium and it fit
1.0,Was way to small not what the actual size really is<br />It did come really fast tho and it was packaged nice
1.0,Unfortunately the clip that attaches to the watch face broke shortly after wearing it.
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:cb7934cf22e4224f01de39b5877f3900]] The product description stated that there would be 7 different colors. Red, Yellow, White, Pink, Blue, Purple & Multi-Color. There were 6 Purple, 4 Blue & 10 Multi-Color. These were purchased for a specific purpose. Without the different colors, these head garlands are unusable for my purposes.<br />The product received did not match what I purchased.<br />This is FALSE ADVERTISING.<br />I thought I had found exactly what I was looking for. No such luck."
1.0,Super ugly shirt it's like something the telytubbies would wear
1.0,The packaging was terrible. The rings themselves were ugly chipped up plastic. Not wearable for the most part. Looked nothing like the picture or the description. It was a waste of money honestly. I was so surprised that Amazon even allowed crap like this to be sold on thier site. I was extremely unsatisfied in what I recieved. It was all a lie. Now im stuck with 20 disgusting fake chipped up plasitc septum rings
1.0,Material is too hot and dress is shapeless for curvy figuers
1.0,Can see throw both layers. Cheap fabric. Not worth the purchase
1.0,"Ordered an extra large in women's it fits like a extra large in girls. This seller does not use the correct size chart. I am so disappointed because I wanted to wear this jumper during the month of October, during breast cancer awareness month."
1.0,"So this is not a dress - it's a very thin night gown.  Not only that but it seems like it was made for a small child.  There were several different styles to choose from, so to be clear I bought the one that looks looser fitting on the bottom like an A-line shape with the tie in the back rather than the body con style.  It's absolutely unwearable in public.  TERRIBLE!!!"
1.0,"The hands were off, so it couldn't be set properly.  It was hard as crap to get the pins out to make it smaller.  Then it barely held a charge.  I already threw it away after less than a week.  But it does look pretty."
1.0,very thin and not enough weight to it to drape and lay nicely when worn.  Disappointed
1.0,Bra on this bathing suit unstictched...it was a great fit but the quality sucks!!!
1.0,I've ordered these at 3 different time in 3 different color combos. They are the same brand and the same style. Notice how much smaller they are? Why are they getting smaller?
1.0,These are not jeans at all these are leggings that are light washed colored and I do not believe it is the same as what's in the picture . RETURNED item
1.0,I ordered a large and they are more like. SMall.
1.0,This looks like something my granddaughter would play with!!!!! It looks terrible I wouldn’t be caught out in public wearing this!!!
1.0,"Cheaply made, don't close right and bends very easily"
1.0,"Nothing but an overpriced T-shirt. The material is thicker than your average Walmart T-shirt, but if you are not comfortable with your body...don’t buy this dress...it shows all of your imperfections!"
1.0,"Either one of the letters fell off or it's misspelled.  But either way, it's going back. Very disappointed with the quality."
1.0,Really doesn't look has how it is on Amazon not good quality totally different 😔
1.0,It was ripped on the sides!
1.0,"Received with a dead battery.  Pull tab to block battery contacts wasnt anywhere in the bag or box.  The battery only activated a small, red indicator light.  I figured I could go buy a new battery and remove the microscrews to replace but I purchased a new bracelet and I wasnt going to jeopardize my ability to return the item by having them claim I damaged it.  Buyer Beware."
1.0,"If I could give it a minus star I would.  I have had my Apple Watch for 6 months, never had any trouble with any bands.  I wore the watch with this band and now my watch is gone.  Somehow it came off my wrist and I didn’t realize it.  Now it’s gone!!!!  I’m so mad at myself for trusting a magnet band!!!"
1.0,material was as thin as paper. ripped already.
1.0,"Not able to review product need to return unable to see through the lenses, description stated the lenses were ""smoke"" and the glasses came blacked out."
1.0,The stone was a lot darker than the picture.
1.0,If I could give less than a star I would!  The dress was an extra large but was really small!  The material was really cheap and the dress was cheaply made!
1.0,"Cheap looking and gaudy, too bulky and no brilliance. Waste of money. Bought as a gift, but going to trash"
1.0,"10 ‘lockets’ but only came with 1 chain. What am I supposed to do with the other 9 that don’t have chains? Given the finish on these, you can’t just use any chain, you need one that is multi-colored like the locket- good luck finding that!"
1.0,Very small  disappointed waste of money
1.0,LOL so I read the reviews in advance and knew it could be very short in the torso but im only 5' so I had hope. I was wrong. it was super short and I'll have to send it back. The suit itself however aside from the fit seems like decent enough quality for its price and the print which I got was the gears was really nice in person! Just wish it fit properly.
1.0,"Way to small, did not fit as expected..."
1.0,Received my earrings and one of them were broken. Very disappointed. I was looking forward to wearing them for my birthday next week.
1.0,They last about 4-5 months and they won’t stand behind them
1.0,Too big. How i can received 2X (one size less) before dec 12?
1.0,"Talk about abysmal quality and disappointment. I have tons of blue light glasses- TONS, so when I saw these and jumped at the cute colors they came in. To start with 2 out of 3 came scratched. You can see the scratch on these pink ones in the left of the lens. To add insult to injury I got a fingerprint smudge on it and cleaned it off with a glasses lens cloth and lo and behold THE YELLOW “paint” or whatever it is they use to cost the lens literally wiped away. These are a complete waste of money."
1.0,"terrible condition, looks like a rag"
1.0,"Completely not what I expected, gave it before I looked at it. I looked stupid because it was not the right thing...."
1.0,Dress was not the correct size ordered. Was also Ripped in the front.
1.0,Pearls fall out. Not good quality
1.0,Beautiful glasses but the construction is just awful.  I’ve managed to keep them alive for a number of months but keeping them clean is a nightmare because the lenses pop out SO easily.  They are just way too fragile.
1.0,"Shiny material, real cheap"
1.0,"Just bought it. This thing has been in the 90 degree sun for two days with no clouds, and the lights don't work at all. The only feature I was concerned with when buying an umbrella was the lights. The company is in China with no toll-free way to call, so I'm emailing them. This should be fun.<br />UPDATE: The email address is a dead link, and does not work. I did not have the opportunity to try the umbrella until a few weeks after receiving it because the table I ordered for it was on back order, and now, even though I have been sold a completely deficient product, Amazon will not allow me to return it. I am out the money I spent. Do not buy this product, and do not expect Amazon to be fair or reasonable if you're cheated out of money."
1.0,"Too thin, flimsy."
1.0,actually it wasnt till I opened them that I notice the left side was defective ..it makes me dizzy on picture u can see where the lens its uneven
1.0,"Cute top, but doesn't run anywhere close to size. I got an XL which should have fit or been a little big, but it fit like a small of extra small. Returning immediately"
1.0,So cheap! And the skate is black! Not able to give this to my daughter!
1.0,Love the fabric and color. It just is too small for an XL. Fits like a medium. So disappointed
1.0,too small for my 3 year old
1.0,Very poorly designed does not work very well for a small or large bags please don't order not worth the money and the trouble returning
1.0,"Too bulky and can't put it in any pocket, too large to hold , very inconvenient"
1.0,"I ordered a large and it fit like a small. The design was super cute, however, the quality of fabric and stitching does not constitute a $100 price tag."
1.0,does not look real at all 🤷🏾‍♂️
1.0,"I am so sad. I love this shirt, but it came with blood or ink spot stains.😿 I tried to get rid of them myself, but I haven't had any luck."
1.0,"The size is way too small!  I bought a 3X for my daughter to use after the birth of her next child.  The reality is that rather than be a 3X (U.S. size 22-24) what I got was probably a size 12-14.<br />Other than that,  the pajamas are pretty,  look comfortable,  seem sturdy.  But I'll be returning them."
1.0,This is cheap quality puts lint all over your clothes I DONT recommend it at all
1.0,I bought these thinking they were going to be great. They are super thin and feel like paper
1.0,returned items after much go around with China based vendor. Get local vendor with good products that fit Americans!
1.0,Terrible quality. Can not wear a bra with this dress leaving large busted women with no support. Wanted to use these as bridesmaid dresses but no way. Lace almost ripped trying to fit an arm through the hole. Returning item ASAP.
1.0,La verdad muy mala calidad en una sola puesta se puso negro perdio el color completo. Deberian devolver el dinero.
1.0,"100% Polyester shirt advertised as 100% cotton. I never would have ordered this and it took a month to arrive. Looks and feels more like underwear than a tank top. Overall, worst purchase I've made on Amazon."
1.0,Dress ripped in the back seam after wearing once.
1.0,"This looks great but I only wore it for about two weeks and it fell apart, literally.  It was a good thing I had long sleeves on when it happened or I would have lost my fitbit. What a wast of money. I couldn't fix it, had to throw it away."
1.0,Poor semis.
1.0,This would have been a great cufflink set. If they would sent me both cufflinks as Airforce as I had ordered. But what I got was one Airforce cufflink and one US Army cufflink. The quaily of the cufflink is great I would have love have both cifflinks  to be Airforce being that I am a Airforce Vet.
1.0,I received an XSmall jacket.  The label on the plastic says 4X.  The jacket size did not fit the label on the plastic.  There is no way to return it since it was made in China.  I would like the right size sent to me
1.0,Just didn't work for me... it was longer than tunic length so it came to my knees and it was much too clingy therefore showing all my flaws and the arms were too tight. Just a wrong material for us bigger girls
1.0,I like the concept of this swimsuit after having children my stomach isn't what it used to be. Ordered the size 4 since that size is what fits me normally and the straps just are too tight. Plus the cut out in the front is annoying. Wish it fit better
1.0,Made for a little girl.

1.0,Se rompe con demaciado facilidad
1.0,Literally a button for a shirt.  Do. It but this product.  False advertising
1.0,"As it is a gift I can't tell just yet about the sizing. The feature itself works but be ready to invest some extra money on buy glow pen a side. the one that comes it's extreme cheap, it could not be poor made. Cellphones light ""works"", meh not really, you barely can see it, so not a cool effect with it. i tested a led lantern and it worked, so now i just bought a set of keychains expecting to work too. I read reviews and i was expecting a little more lucky, but just like most of the people here, you just have to be prepared for the glow pen malfunction so you don't disappoint the kids. def frustrating have to have extra costs for something already not so cheap."
1.0,Cheaply made.  Too small and it stinks
1.0,Missing jewels
1.0,"Odd! The sweater is not long and the pockets are strange. I am. 5'11"", but it's not long at all, barely covers my butt. The pockets are THICK and aren't sewn in so they flop open. I was able to get a partial refund and hope to maybe make this into an ugly sweater."
1.0,Disliked this sent it back very thin material
1.0,I will be returning this item for a refund extremely tiny charm
1.0,doesn’t change much. Night lights still”starlight “

1.0,I bought my bracelet on the 3rdit broke not even two weeks later. The copper discolored in under a week. So disappointing
1.0,Thin ugly material. Color is good but it looks like garbage
1.0,Very odd shape- super tight on the bottom but huge on the top. Very short as well. Would have returned it had my daughter not loved the front. Overall cheap poorly made product
1.0,I thought I was getting a watch band but it's only the little black &#34;sleeve piece&#34;. Seriously 6.92 for that one tiny piece???
1.0,Low qulity
1.0,"The neck thing is awful, isn't tight so it dangles"
1.0,"Was cheaply made and when filled to capacity, it could not be zipped closed.  Gave it to Goodwill."
1.0,It didn't even fit my watch. It said it was compatible and not true.
1.0,It snowed today so we got out the gloves and tried attaching them to my daughters coat. She always loses her gloves. Well these snaps were an utter fail. One of the pink ones wouldn’t snap on one end. So the. We got out the black ones. I went to snap it on and the entire thing broke. Ugh. Out of 4 snaps only two actually worked. So on one sleeve she has a black glove clip and on the other a pink one. I want a refund. Wish I didn’t have to waste my time sending these back and could just get a refund for a faulty product. I had such high hopes.
1.0,The fabric was too stiff and didn’t hang at all - it was like wearing plastic
1.0,Not what I was expecting didn't like the middle line in my face
1.0,I love the pattern. But u have 2 b anorexic for them to fit your calf. They also run about 1/2 size to big. Wish they had same pattern or close to it but shorter so they would fit the calf.
1.0,"Just got around to wearing these socks and was shocked to see a pair torn. Right on top, so now I am wondering if the material is cheap or what the issue is. Very disappointed. Was so looking forward to wearing these......."
1.0,Fabric is too thin and the sizes are way too small! Had to return!
1.0,"Very cheaply made - starting falling apart on day 2 of arrival. I didn't end up using it at all. It catches on every piece of clothing, especially the delicate materials. I have small wrists, but it pretty much suffocated them. I gave it to my niece because it's pretty much a toy (and worth less than a buck)"
1.0,"Not a match, one pearl was round, one pearl was more flat, both with different clusters. Disappointed, these are so nice, good size, packaged well if one wanted to gift it, but not matching pearl. I Wil be returning them"
1.0,I have brought 3 pair of these and all 3 pair have broken in the same spot of the neck piece within 2 months. So I gave up after losing 120.00 dollars.
1.0,Very tight in the sleeves I got a X-tra large and had to give to my very petite Japanese co-worker. My 12 yr old couldn't even wear it.
1.0,"Cute but they don't stay clasped, probably will lose one soon😥"
1.0,"I was looking for a cute sun dress for summer—sadly, this was not the one for me. Perhaps I didn’t read the description closely enough, but this was not cotton; the fabric was flimsy, staticky, and felt synthetically silky on my skin. The cut of the dress also wasn’t flattering on me; it wasn’t simply a relaxed fit, it billowed out on me. (I have a more straight, slender body type—this might fit differently on other body shapes/builds?) I wanted to like this dress, but couldn’t and ended up returning it. The summer dress search continues..."
1.0,"Too large for my child's head, tried for my own eyeglasses and it's loose on me as well."
1.0,"Its absolutely does not look like the photo...sorry seller ..im at a lost for this one. The cut was all wrong, its literally like hey im going to make a dress out of my imagination without ever seeing an actual dress."
1.0,Does not work. Period.
1.0,Everything fell apart very cheap
1.0,"I should have guessed from the awful product picture on the listing, but I took a chance. What I got was not the “stylish elastic metallic beads bracelet [with] quality flag prints protected by epoxy laminated finish” described. Nope. What I got was a “c” bracelet apparently of cheap plastic wrapped in yellow thread. I contacted the seller and, thus far, not a word of response. A one star rating is too generous."
1.0,"Very plain, cheap looking, poorly made, wasn't worth just the few dollars at all"
1.0,Late
1.0,"They were way too short, the hook couldn't even make it to the other side of my nose. Really disappointed, I was looking forward to using this product."
1.0,"I thought I'd try this TLT brand because the socks look the same as the Rashabsox brand which I bought before and loved. Not so. These socks are a few dollars cheaper, but they are worthless. The non-slip rubbers crack and peel off after just 1 day of wear --- and i haven't even washed them! They also roll around my feet a lot more. Counting on Amazon customer service to help me with this, and going back to Rashabsox (fingers crossed that their quality hasn't gone down ...)"
1.0,I was expecting leggings but I got stockings instead.  They are completely see through (i.e. can see your underwear through them).
1.0,It looked very cheap.
1.0,"This shirt is extremely small and short. Even after I reviewed the sizing information it still was not right. I have tried to return it, but they want me to pay $5 for shipping cost. It’s not worth my time, I might as well throw it in the trash."
1.0,"Terrible. Cheap dress. Poorly constructed. Came all the way from China, and has no return policy except to refund you money for alterations. Not a good buy."
1.0,I don't like this is not a good working watch
1.0,"Material of this top is extra thin and not like the picture and description at all. The neckline is like a rounded necked tee-shirt, not off the shoulder. I ordered an XL and got a large. I tried to return this but you have to sellars approval and after almost 2 months have not returned my request."
1.0,"The first time I washed these, one came completely unraveled!  I don't think that should happen.  So, essentially, this was a single use item."
1.0,Too short and the end is way too small
1.0,"Only one shoe lights up out of the box.  If it worked it would be fine.<br /><br />I bought this as a novelty gift as we just moved to AZ wanted them to shine a light on any scorpions on the floor.<br /><br />Return policy requires paying postage to return.  For the price or shipping, I'll just eat it.  Wouldn't buy again now that I read through reviews and see that others had the same issue."
1.0,Cheap looks like kids toy jewelry do not order
1.0,"First wear was great, but after washing it the fabric started beading up. Horrible for the money I spent on multiple colors."
1.0,"First of all this is not a dress. It's a poop brown polyester nightmare shirt and a heavy grey skirt. The shirt won't stay tucked in, it's itchy and the patch details on the sleeves don't look like the picture."
1.0,The review submitted for shoes was meant to be for vest - not the shoes.  The shoes should have a 5 star rating.
1.0,"Let me start off by saying this item took forever. Which I expected. When I put it on, I realized that this was a women’s cut tshirt. It does not say anywhere in the description or to even give you that option to choose, which I would never pick womens cut. Needless to say it’s a waste of money. Size down because women’s cut makes you look wider. This shirt could have been half decent if I sized down a size or too. At least it would have been tight and looked cute, now it just looks like I’m wearing a pillow case."
1.0,"These belts, while they are ""small and slim"" are actually bulky because of the way they are made to adjust to whatever size you need. Also, once you adjust, it doesn't stay. It loosens easily and quickly so I'm constantly having to readjust throughout the day. I wouldn't have gotten them had I known. But I have them now and I deal. Lol"
1.0,"Unless you are using it as a cover up, the white is see thru. It’s t shirt material. I returned it."
1.0,First time my daughter wore them for less than an hour the one shoe would not turn off. We plugged it in because nothing else worked to get it to shut off and it finally did shut off but now won't come back on. I have a very disappointed 11 year old.
1.0,"I actually hated this dress. It was butt ugly, the material is def not what is pictured, and the colors were not as vibrant. I purchased this dress twice, one for me, and one for a friend. I won't buy anything else from farktop."
1.0,"This shirt fit perfectly everywhere except for the fact that the size of the arm holes is abnormally small.  The side of the shirt actually presses up under my arms.  I am not a heavy person, this is definitely a problem with the cut of the shirt."
1.0,Not the size stated
1.0,the handle broke as it is very weak and not good for rigorous travel
1.0,"It is not the size of the lens of my sunglasses, which by the iyem description is the same model.<br />Waste of money, the lens dont fit"
1.0,"This is really poor quality. I wore it once and the bar already started to discolor. I would not recommend this product to anyone, even if you are looking for something inexpensive. It's more worth it to spend 10 more dollars and get something you can wear many more times. The shipping also too forever. I am all for getting good deals, but this is a terrible one."
1.0,"The dress is a little thin, but really cute. Unfortunately, I bought it for a trip, wore it once before I left and all of the stitching came out of the midsection. It's unwearable now for my trip. Very disappointing."
1.0,I wore these once and they were pilling from jump street! Not quality material. Sux cause I like the fit and look. Bummed!
1.0,This hurt my husbands head. He took it off after about 10 minutes and accidentally dropped it. It broke upon being dropped and that was th end of it.
1.0,"What a waste, this fits like a large not a xxx-large! Terrible!"
1.0,"Says it was delivered, it was"
1.0,"I purchased this cloth to polish the bracelet portion of some watches I have.  The cloth arrived quickly enough, but the zip-lock bag was not closed - Product was probably dried up.  The cloth didn't remove any of the tarnish, much less polish it!  A total waste of money.  Sorry I didn't get some Brasso or a Blitz cloth - they work!"
1.0,El tipo de material es súper malo no vale la pena honestamente.
1.0,Not a grown up scarf
1.0,The fit was awful
1.0,"The design is cool, it is labeled as a one size fits all which I would agree with if you are a 12 year old."
1.0,Thin and cheapie feeling
1.0,Had these a short time and one of the rubber nose pieces fell off and is lost. Unable to wear without. Wouldn’t buy again knowing that these are detachable and unable to wear without.
1.0,"The zipper is horrible. Purchased this sports bar was at the gym and Bam!!! Yeah, either I’m going to get a free membership at my gym or asked never to come back. So embarrassing."
1.0,I really liked the  look of these but the first time I wore them the bottom of my heel came off and I lost it:(
1.0,Looks cool for my little brother he was excited. Once he started wearing it we noticed the cheap silver plating peeling off of it.
1.0,"These are one gauge up than what they are marketed as. I ordered 2g, but they are meant to fit 0g."
1.0,Worn once...in pieces!
1.0,Had to return product. Showed up missing stones
1.0,I ordered this because my husband and I have the same phone and I wanted to be able to tell them apart easily. I received it quickly but it was not sticky at all. Wouldn't stick to my phone. Wouldn't even stick to my finger or table. i followed the directions and have used many decals like this in the past so I know I did it right. I contacted the company and they responded very quickly and offered a refund or replacement. I chose replacement thinking it must have just been defective. I just received the replacement and it also does not stick to anything. What a shame.
1.0,it was a very cheap design. i hate it and would do anything to get my money back<br />i dont like it
1.0,Updating review***<br /><br />DONT BUY THEM!!! You’ll regret! They look nice on the body of you DONT move lol every 3 steps(not being exaggerated) you’ll have to pull them up. Imagine working out! Impossible!<br /><br />After working out on them they def don’t stay up. I have to keep pulling them up.<br />I’m now with two pair of pants that look super tight but don’t stay up AT ALL. There is no way those pants are to work out.<br />JUST A EASTE OF MONEY!!!! Regret it so much!<br />DONT BUY THEM!
1.0,"Received it not working, and cannot get it to work"
1.0,"I don’t even know if it fit too small or too large, because if possible, it managed to be both at the same time 😝. I’ve purchased my share of China cheapies, and it’s always a risk...lost big time on this one! Fit was so off it was just unwearable."
1.0,"Kind of looks like a moo-moo, but that might be in style now."
1.0,I ordered the royal blue.  I don't like the flimsy material of the top.  Too clingy. The color of the top didn't match the color of the skirt.  I didn't even try it on.  It's on it's way back.
1.0,"Did not work out of box. Plastic thing on watch stem that you remove so it wood start ticking, was gone. Makes me think this watch was repackaged ."
1.0,It was extremely tight around my wrist. I returned the item
1.0,Way to small and cheap material!
1.0,Waste in adjustable elastic.
1.0,"The belt looked fine, fit well, and was a good color. However, within just a few uses, one of the leather straps by the hole for the buckle broke! I used the same hole each time and the buckle seemed to fit easily. Yet, the leather broke. I will use it until it becomes too noticeable."
1.0,This was a really cheap pair of glasses and they were not able to be adjusted
1.0,Trash. Didn’t stay on at all
1.0,The quality was not good. It wasn't attractive or cute at all. Looks cute on the model but not in reality.
1.0,It was small in the busy and the fabric wasn’t what I expected. Cute dress just not on me.
1.0,"It is what it is. The light isn’t very bright, and it doesn’t respond very well to sound. The music has to be VERY loud for it to respond at all."
1.0,Returned. Cheap
1.0,CLEARLY NOT A HALF INCH!! I’m not sure who measured these out..... but they are much smaller than a half inch.... which is disappointing considering this is the second time this has happened..... I know I should have gone to my jeweler but I figured I’d give it a try. Never mind.
1.0,"This was really unfortunate because the dress was very cute and the size was good, maybe a little short for me (personal preference). I ordered a medium and I am 5'6 and 143 lbs. The problem with the dress is that the seam on one side of it was all messed up, the fabric got bunched up into it and it left a corner of the dress sticking out on one side, making it look a bit awkward and badly sewn. So I'll be returning this one."
1.0,Tiny. I wish they fit as they are lovely. The new Asian sizes on Amazon are driving me crazy! An XL is a size 10 to 12 in US sizes. Not even close to fitting my size 16.
1.0,Breaks easily. Doesn't rip out hair. These are the kind of hair ties that sorta breaks apart after each use until it finally pops
1.0,This was a complete epic fail. We tried to wear it different ways to make it look like something besides a sheet. But no luck. I thought maybe I got it too big so I had my mom whose bigger than me try it on. It still look like an oversized sheet. It has no form to it and the little ruffle look does not exist.
1.0,"This shirt is cheap, it's wide and awkward and based on the reviews I ordered up 1 size and that was a huge mistake! It's like a tent on me"
1.0,"The hat fit nicely the one time I got to wear it. It was supposed to be foldable. It was not, the hat just started coming apart after the first wear. I was not happy with this purchase at all."
1.0,"Don’t waste your money.  Flimsy, poorly fitting and made of fabric that is neither warm nor durable."
1.0,the size tags were missing. very small for an xlarge
1.0,"Doesn't stay on, very difficult to wear."
1.0,"I read the reviews but thought i would take a chance anyway.  Sometimes reviews turn out to be wrong.  Not this time.  I really wanted to receive mittens that are made of felted wool and looked as beautiful as the ones in the picture.  Well the ""gloves"" I received were thin probably synthetic material and looked not a thing like the picture.  Amazon didn't even want them back.  I would love to find the ones that are pictured.  They would be great for arthritis treatment."
1.0,The fabric was awful and wrinkled and too small
1.0,After wearing shorts once they fell apart. I’ve only had them a little over a month.
1.0,The mask is sewn in such a way that you can't read the first line of the sentence which makes it ridiculous. .not to mention the folds are pleated up instead of down.<br />All masks are sewn with the pleats down .  Cheaply made. Cabt wear it so it's a waste of money.
1.0,"Crappy polyester fabric, weird sleeves, medium was huge.  Returned it"
1.0,It was to long could not wear it
1.0,"The mask is nice and the rhinestone look good but the mask itself is too big as if all elasticity has been worn out. I have never used it for tha reason, but it is nice. So unless you have a larger face, I can't recommend it."
1.0,"Beautiful dress, the size is way off…size 10 is really a 6/7T…runs way too small. Very disappointed"
1.0,DID NOT WORK!!<br />the plastic threads broke every time!
1.0,"The design is beautiful, but the size is off."
1.0,"After just one wash, the threads are coming apart at the seams.  Really like the fit and color of these, but the quality isn't there.  I expect I'll be seeing holes in the seams soon."
1.0,"I was swimming in the dress. Maybe I would've had a better fit in 2 sizes down, but I didn't bother to exchange it. The material felt too plastic-like anyway. And the dress was too long for my 5ft 4in self."
1.0,Uh-No! I should have read the reviews more carefully. I wanted a feather robe and this is not it. The fabric on the sleeve is a fur not feathers. The stitching is of poor quality as well. Because the fabric is so light and the sleeve and end of belt fabric is so heavy this just doesn’t work. Not for me!
1.0,Did not like them. Cheap quality. Uncomfortable!😟
1.0,Wrong item sent paid express and getting no where with seller.  Fabric is dull and itchy
1.0,Nada cómodo
1.0,This is extremely cheep! It's sucks looks like something I could have gotten at the Dollar store! Uncomfortable and not fluffy like in the pic barely anything wast of money worst jacket iv ever gotten!!!!!! SAVE YOU MONEY!!!!!!
1.0,looks janky and fit super weird
1.0,Only came with one ear ring.
1.0,"The stripe design was positioned a little funny on the front of the blouse. It does not look like the picture. Also, it is little bit small, and had low-quality stitching that was unraveling before I even put it on. I sent this back. Too low-quality. Scared to wear it or wash it."
1.0,The colors were brighter and cheaper looking in person. I couldn’t get over how cheap and crappy the bright and not matching colors were so I returned it.
1.0,It was perfect when I got it. Washed in cold water and it shrunk from a large to an xs! Hung to dry and pulled and stretched to no avail. Gave it to my daughter and it's short on her even!
1.0,Slightly tighter than I'd like. But decided to keep and gently hand wash tk minimize any shrinkage.  Now wishing I had returned.....it is pulling badly!
1.0,Description said fits 45mm. Box says fits 42-44mm. QR code scan for digital watch faces was a porn site address
1.0,"Flimsy, much smaller than the image of pencil thin model wearing it. I restyled mine into a blouse."
1.0,Dress feels and looks like it's made from paper. I wouldn't recommend it.
1.0,Mala calidad ....
1.0,Size not even close to correct.
1.0,Very flimsy and short in length. Not tall girl friendly. Item was returned for refund.
1.0,I ordered XL and it does not fit . It would fit a medium person. Very cheap material and does not look like the picture. Will never ever order clothes. The come from CHINA and it should state the size runs small want a refund on all my clothes.
1.0,"I bought small size, but when i wear it, it looks like medium or large. Size is not correct and quality is okay. better to check something else."
1.0,took forever to get. Wasn't worth the wait
1.0,It has zero padding and was shipped all twisted up.  Still can't get it straightened out all the way. Poor quality and not worth the money
1.0,"Beautiful watch, exactly whatvI was Looking for; however, this watch needs to be worn at all times or left on watch winder at night. If i taake it off at night the next day i have to adjust time manually because it stopped overnight. Very dissapointing. I plan on returning but unfortunately no longer have the box it arrived in."
1.0,Did not like them. It gets tangled in my hair way too often. It has taken chunks of my hair out. The clasps broke after only wearing it a couple of times. And it get s kinked
1.0,"The patent leather toe is so hard, can not stand the uncomfortable fit."
1.0,It was way to short through the shoulder area. Actually made red welts on my shoulders.
1.0,"I bought the tan one and liked the shape but didn't like the color, so I purchased the black one, but the shape was completely different! It was tighter and not the oversized look that I wanted."
1.0,"I’m a truck driver and on April 21 I spent $190 on this safety plus sun glasses because I needed them for my job, with in the first week of use they had scratches all over the lenses even though I took really good care of them, those lenses are supposed to stop a bullet and yet they had scratches in less than a week, I think I got ripped off I don’t think they were original.😠"
1.0,Muy malo
1.0,It is made of Metal<br />And even still it got dropped<br />TO the ground hit the wooden floor and some how broke in two
1.0,Horrible product. There was absolutely no stick on the earring to even stick to my daughters  ear for a second. Worthless. Very disappointed.
1.0,Was pretty when it arrived but it was way too small. If you want to order this dress order at least 2 to 3 sizes larger than what you need
1.0,"First of all, the description is completely misleading. It says ""6 packs"" which would logically imply 6 pairs. Who would wear just 1 sock? Even so, when we got our package we only got ""4"" instead of the ""6"".  If I had known that the $13 is for just 2 pairs of socks, I would not order this."
1.0,It was marked large but was obviously a small and since it shipped from China the cost in postage to return it was more than I paid for it.<br />I loved the pattern and colors but was very disappointed that the size was so off.
1.0,"I'm not even 5' flat and I ordered a small which usually fits too tight but I ordered out of blind faith and when it came in, it was wayyy to big. Fits like an XL!"
1.0,"These shoes didn't even last a single day. My daughter wore them on the first day back to school--and only turned on the lights at recess--and by the end of the day, the light in one shoe doesn't work. I followed the instructions to reconnect lighting system and it didn't work. I will be returning these. So dissappo"
1.0,Tela horrible
1.0,These are literally a joke.  They are no where near the size I bought and feel like paper.  So disappointed.
1.0,"Way too small, not impressed with the quality either"
1.0,They are way to short. Sizes are not right
1.0,Very itchy and hard to breathe
1.0,Doesn't at all fit like the photo
1.0,"I bought 5 pairs of these for flower girls. They all fell apart within minutes of being worn. The material is bafflingly awful. It shouldn’t be used for shoes. Also, the glitter is giant and rainbow colored."
1.0,They fell apart after I wore them once.
1.0,"All the materials used in these were awful. The zippers are so cheap, that within the first wear, the one on the right side stopped working and wouldn’t zip the teeth together. Eventually the sipper became detached. Once thrown in the washer and dryer, threads started to unravel and come out. This is so cheap it’s not even funny"
1.0,terrible not true to size dont waste your money
1.0,lol horrible. Do not buy
1.0,"This dress stinks, obviously worn and returned.  Really gross, have to send back.  Made me feel sick to my stomach it was so bad.  Super frustrating."
1.0,"Way to big, And the cut is unflattering"
1.0,"Not what I expected it's a kid's hat. Would not recommend this product for an adult, for a child it would be fine."
1.0,"It was not  expected, to short for mini dress.."
1.0,Poor quality. Way too small and I don't even have big breasts.... Didn't expect it to be too nice
1.0,It didn’t come in the bag
1.0,Returned it …
1.0,"This item is way too small for a women's size, description is wrong."
1.0,I wanted to buy this hat but stopped in my tracks when I realized it was made of rabbit fur.<br />There is no reason anything should be made from REAL fur nowadays with all the alternatives.<br />I will not support a company that kills any animals simply for its fur. Sorry!
1.0,Holy Cow!  Extra Large must be a child’s extra large!!!!!
1.0,"These are super cheap looking plastic coated plastic.  The ""paint"" was already peeling off the end of the frames when they arrived."
1.0,"Too tight in the chest area, the chest seam splits the chest in a weird way, do not like that part- it’s basically unwearable for me. Too bad because the rest of the dress is cute and well made."
1.0,Bra fits but top roll down if you bend over or lean forward.  Not what I expected.  How do I return?
1.0,Too SMall. I cant even wear it :(
1.0,If I could give it zero I would. Bought these for my grandson for Christmas. January 29th the entire bottom sole fell off. Walked on it on dry ground only. My advise. DO NOT BUY. GARBAGE. He's lucky he didn't fall when it came off. The potential for a hospital visit is very high from this crap.
1.0,Don't buy these! Cheap ass metal turns your skin green/black.. not happy.
1.0,Definitely not American sizes. I ordered an XL and it fit like a small. Bummer. I really liked this style.
1.0,Did not fit. Runs very small.
1.0,It did not fit. Nor was it the style she was looking for.
1.0,The gloves just didn't give me the relief I wanted. I have very bad arthritis and use my hands for retail and it doesn't give me the support !
1.0,I have had these sunglasses for about a month and they are the cheap plastic around the nose piece has broken on each side. I am very easy on sunglasses and they go in their case after use. Not impressed with the quality at all.
1.0,We need this dress for a wedding.  The dress does not look like the picture.  Company would not issue full refund.  They wanted to negotiate and didn't even do that in good faith.
1.0,NOT AS PICTURED . DO NOT PURCHASE
1.0,Fell apart first use at Disneyland poor quality dosnt even cover this .
1.0,It’s torn omg when I got it
1.0,they run a little small. i am usually a size 8 and always wear a medium but the medium fit more like leggings that joggers. i would size up.
1.0,"Bought a size small for my 7 y/o and they fit my husband, who is a mens XL."
1.0,I don't know. I haven't been able to get it hooked up yet. I think a good diagram on paper would help a lot.
1.0,Nope. A total hack job. One side is completely chopped off and uneven
1.0,RETURNED. TERRIBLE REFLECTION FROM METAL SIDES. BOUGHT TO BLOCK SUN ON SIDES...MAKES IT WORSE
1.0,Sizing incorrect
1.0,Very thin and keep rolling under your heel!
1.0,"I stopped ordering clothing from Amazon after being disappointed multiple times from items shipping directly from Asia with sizing issues and products that did not even resemble the photos whatsoever. After reading the fairly positive reviews I ordered 3 of these dresses (black, white & yellow) to wear as nightgowns because the description said 100% cotton and I liked that they had pockets. I should have known they were being sent from China because the shipping prediction was 30+ days. I received this item more quickly than expected, (13 days). The problem is:  There's absolutely NO way these dresses contain even a miniscule amount of cotton. The tag says 65% cotton 35% Polyester but it is a lie. I just compared it to a swatch of 100% polyester and it's even worse quality than the 100% poly. Fabric is like a cheap Halloween costume. What looks like embroidery in the white/red dress is a cheap screen print that is sewn so poorly it is completely unwearable, it doesn't match up at the seams. White & Yellow are completely see through, I'm wearing black panties in the photo for reference. As for fit- I ordered a small and they fit fairly well except the armpits are quite loose and would need to be taken in if I decided to keep this. For reference I'm 5'6"", 120 lbs, 30D (29"" band size, 34"" bust) and the dress hits approximately 3"" above my knee. Overall, the dress is cute and probably worth around 5-10 dollars, not the 25$ I paid. If you're expecting cotton I would not order this dress"
1.0,Construction pattern too loose for small size.  Not attractive as shown on photo.
1.0,The product arrived with blue dye marks (lines down dress). So sad because it was super cute other than it arriving defected.
1.0,"The product isn't terrible (besides multiple scuffs and Scratches and poor connection of the mirror to the acrylic), but it also isn't what I ordered.<br /><br />I ordered my first hat case from them a few weeks ago and in ended up coming with plastic risers and didn't look like the photo. I didn't have time to send it back and I wasn't going to make a big deal of it.<br /><br />Then I ordered two more, not bc I liked my first product, but I just wanted all three cases to match.<br /><br />This second order I receive two of the ACTUAL case I ordered. The only problem is they don't MATCH, and are lower quality and smaller than the first one they sent me. Also it is full of SCRATCHS probably from a drill."
1.0,The mondor dress is good quality but the vendor makes you pay for shipping on return / exchange products which not clearly stated on their website. The dress runs very small size.
1.0,Cheap fabric ripped while taking the tag off
1.0,Buyer beware of a good deal?<br />It wasn’t worth the return hassle
1.0,The product is poor quality the neck hole is extremely large or overall not worth it at all thanks for hearing me out
1.0,Way way too small. This is like a child’s shirt. No way this is an adult size.
1.0,"It feels heavy duty but the loop where the end of the belt slides in fell apart after almost no use.. Additionally I received the wrong size and never was able to get a replacement or refund although I returned it.  I’ve bought 2 of these, only got the one and it fell apart.  I’ve bought Trafalgar belts on Amazon for well  over a decade and they owe me money.<br /><br />Life is too short to deal with their issues…. Move on"
1.0,Broken within a few months.
1.0,Cheap made. Not what I expected
1.0,Wayyyyyy too short on the butt. If you aren't a size 2 this will make you look super wide. I returned it.
1.0,These took over a month to get on prime. Complete nonsense that they say 2 days. They run small and are not the material you could stretch a little without seams breaking.  Cheaply made.
1.0,Product stained my hat.
1.0,The watch ban was to cheap feeling it was flimsy
1.0,Already tarnished.  😡
1.0,These turkeys came broken.  They were not attached to the headband.  Waste of money! Don’t bother ordering.
1.0,These kept falling down like they were baggy. I will probably donate them because I won't wear them again. Super soft though.
1.0,Not as pictured at all. No ruffle at bottom and no stretch . Returned same day I received
1.0,the bracelet is beautiful but the clasp does not work so I am returning it.
1.0,"Se rompen muy fácil,en menos de un mes use las 12 no good"
1.0,It’s alright it’s just HUGE I thought it was a tote bag but it’s a big gym bag. Like bigger then a duffel bag. Great if u need to pack for a few days but for work
1.0,DONT WORK AFTER 3 1/2 MONTHS DONT WASTE UR MONEY
1.0,For a 2xl it is really small in the upper arms.
1.0,Masks are very small size even for a woman.  Difficult to breath.
1.0,"Cheaply made, and the clear ball is not very clear, it's very blurry."
1.0,Frustrated ... bought these for the gold tights. Pack included silver no gold.
1.0,These lenses are junk!!!! Was no where close to correct fit and outer coating came off as i was wiping them off with the cloth that came with the lenses!!!! I was so livid i stomped them into peices and took the loss on the money! DO NOT BUY!!!
1.0,Quality of tank top was very poor. Very see thru fabric. Not what I was expecting
1.0,"The writing was minuscule. You needed a microscope to read the passage.,"
1.0,"I ordered a Medium (I'm usually between a medium and large) and it was WAY too big. The color was quite off from the picture - more more dull. The material felt more like a nightgown, rather than a dress. I suppose it would be more suitable for a swim suit cover up.  I ended up returning."
1.0,One of them came completely bent n im very aggregated!!!
1.0,These turned my ears green!! And I can't give zero stars or I would.
1.0,"Really, really cheaply made. The crochet patches are knotted and are sure to come loose on the first washing. Took one look and wrapped it back up to return."
1.0,"This is a cute shoe, however it is made for kids with wide feet"
1.0,Love 90 Degrees and have several pair. But the most recent capris ordered are not capris - ankle leggings! Very disappointed.
1.0,I used these for my wrists they were very very small!
1.0,Did not fit me because I have more of a booty compared to a waist.
1.0,Sooooo cheap looking. And not returnable. Very disappointed. I've seen McDonald's happy meal toys that will last longer than these sunglasses
1.0,I bought these slippers for my wife for Christmas in part because they were so well reviewed. They are already starting to fall apart three weeks later. Not a well made item and doesn’t hold up to basic usage.
1.0,Ordered xl and it fit like a large
1.0,It wasn’t wide enough to where
1.0,Too big and came dirty! Don't buy
1.0,I ordered a medium but the size runs small. The arms holes were really low and the material very thin. The photo shows a loose draping fit in the back but this was not the case. Not what I expected. I will be returning for refund.
1.0,Bad really bad quality
1.0,Boot was almost one size too small and is slim. If you have wide feet this boot is not for you
1.0,Really disappointed. The picture made them look bigger than what they actually were. Too small. Weren't quite as shiny as the picture either.
1.0,Very cheap plastic. It plays scary sounds so LOUD! it is not worth the price. I do not recommend at all.
1.0,This is not a sweater and it is a weird thin material returning it very disappointed for my Christmas gift
1.0,This is vvery poor quality
1.0,"A lot bigger than I expected, and you can see my glasses and eyes thru the lenses. I personally don't like them. As far as quality they're nice and seem sturdy but I won't wear them."
1.0,"poor quality lens,gears and frame .just does not work"
1.0,Traveled 8 hours on the plane
1.0,They were a bit flimsy so it made walking uncomfortable.  They are also fur instead of leather.  I wasn't a fan.
1.0,"Too short! It was not even close to my ankles. The fabric was cheap, but not unexpected.  Returned it."
1.0,The quality was awful. The print was pixelated. Not recommended.
1.0,"The picture of this skirt has been designed to show the true cut and color without showing how terrible it looks in reality. I tried to like it, but it is a flimsy fabric that is stitched in a way that seems as if the seamstress was being paid $1.00 a week to pump these out. Maybe it's just me."
1.0,When they say sized small that is totally inaccurate 4t is definitely not the size of the underwear and if I didn’t have a 2 year old that was about to start potty training these are a total waste of money and material.....
1.0,Cheap and cheap feeling and looking.  Looks much better in the picture than in real life.
1.0,"I'm sorry, but I can't include pictures because I'm not taking it back out of the quadrupled bag I put it in to stop the smell. The dress was packaged in a zipper bag, inside a plastic bag, inside the shipping package. No wetness to be found on the 2 outside packaging. I unzip the bag the item is in to find a wet dress that smells so bad I got an instant headache and almost threw up on my kitchen table. Im not even exaggerating. Its BAD. The belts are full of MOLD and also wet. This was the only item I found with good reviews and this item is worth negative 20 stars."
1.0,Bottom part coming off. I put back together but again coming off.
1.0,Did not recive this. A completely different suit arrive. It was a black and white thin cheap material pants eith a white t shirt. I was very disappointed because i has planned my son to wear this for holidays.
1.0,"So uncomfortable and in no way flattering. Every lump and bump of your body shows and seems to squish out in places that I've never had happen in other workout shorts and capris. The whole ruffled butt thing is awful. I don't know how anyone could think having and intentional wedgie is flattering let alone comfortable. I wore these during a very light workout on the treadmill. I was barely even jogging and even just walking quickly most of the time. I spent most of the time adjusting, picking, pulling... yuck! I actually stopped mid workout to go upstairs and peel these horrible things off and put on a normal pair of workout leggings. Never again will I opt for wedgie shorts. I can't return them because I wore one of them, so I guess I'm stuck with what will probably just be used as dusting rags."
1.0,Poor quality. Looks like a dollar store item. Don’t waste your money.
1.0,It is very cute design but the controls look unnatural! I had to return it
1.0,Looks great but broke after a few weeks.
1.0,"These fit great, but after one COLD WATER wash the fabric absorbed some color from another item and is ruined. Would NOT recommend"
1.0,"I purchased this watch as a gift, expecting a high quality piece of jewelry based off of the price and reviews I had read. The watch itself is handsome, and the shipping and payment went just fine. But it broke after the window in which you can return it. So I essentially gave the worst gift ever, cheaply made but not a cheap price. Very disappointed in Amazon and MVMT, I had higher hopes. I will not buy this brand again."
1.0,It's so transparent! Don't do it!
1.0,Specifically measured my husband to get the right size and they sent a 2xl. No where in the description or in the ordering process did we see 2xl anywhere. I ordered a 17-17.5 neck 34 sleeve. How is that a 2xl!? This was for a wedding. Now I have to scurry around and find a shirt that fits.
1.0,These wedge did not fit my arch hurt my toes.
1.0,This is not what I thought I ordered and paid over $40 on. Such a scam! This isn't what's shown in the picture. This is like a sleeping robe + loungewear. How am I supposed to wear this to a concert I have on Saturday and today is already Weds?! 😠 😡 😤
1.0,"I loved this handbag. I saw the bad reviews but liked the bag and I have been looking for one for so long. I decided to try it. Mistake. The metal clasp on the side broke off, the first day. I just went to Walmart, got home and saw it was broken. The front zipper on the pocket was also very touchy, just a matter of time before that broke as well."
1.0,"I ordered two, the black colorful one is wonderful and is perfect, so cute, super comfy! But my rainbow one is defective :( one side goes in perfectly but then the other won’t go in passed that spot, disappointed"
1.0,I ordered both the “T” and the “K” which are my daughter’s initials. The “T” is beautiful; however the “K” came already missing a stone and these are suppose to be Christmas presents. I cannot give her the “K”. I will have to order another one. A bit disappointed.
1.0,This dress looks homey.... I will not buy again and forgot to send back. I gave to good will.
1.0,The material was not what I espected
1.0,"Looking at the pictures and the price, I thought this was going to be a LOT more luxurious than it turned out to be. I should've looked at what the material was: 95% polyester and 5% spandex.<br />This cloak is not something I would ever pay more than $10 for. The outside of the cloak is the same material as the small $5 blankets you can find at Walmart. The inside of the cloak is sweat-inducing material, which makes zero sense to me. The cloak does not come with the sleeves buttoned so that part can be confusing. If you hold the material up and try to look through it, it's thin enough that you can see shapes through the other side. The hood is very ""witchy"" looking. Regardless of whether or not you end up liking this cloak, it absolutely is not worth the price it is going for."
1.0,It was the wrong item. Nothing like pictured.
1.0,Enough elastic to fit a Barbie Doll. I weigh 106 lbs. way too small for me by about half.
1.0,"the bra doesn’t have the measurements they say, it’s much smaller. This is already the second one I buy, the first one was small and the one I bought bigger came even smaller (38DDD = 30 was supposed to be 41)"
1.0,"total bust! if your looking for a good quality bandana, this is not it. it only has print on one side, &#34;toma hash 100% cotton made in china&#34; is printed in 1/2in. letters on the bandana. save your money and find one somewhere else"
1.0,A xxl is like a large
1.0,"Can’t order correct size .  Every time I select the size that I need, my order keep changing to a medium size .  I called Amazon customer service and they had the same problem .  I tried to order the swimsuit months later it was the same result .  Would not recommend unless you need medium size  swimsuit .<br /> To bad,  because the swimsuit was really good quality ,"
1.0,Way too small and fabric was not good quality. Very cheap. Returned it.
1.0,Didn't work for me. Wanted it to work because I love big flowy comfy lounge clothes. This was just too much fabric to deal with.
1.0,Very strange combination. I ordered an XXL based on the other reviews however the bottoms were too big and top way way too small.
1.0,"They fit tight and are not as y’all as I wanted. If you’re a plus size girl, or just have large calves they strangle your calf. You also will not be able to  see them out of regular knee high boots"
1.0,"This hat is for a 1 year old. But I have never seen a 1 year old with a head big enough to wear this hat. Maybe it is a larger kids size, or even small adult. Way too big to be in the 6-24 month category that this listing mentions though. I’m pissed that I have to drive somewhere to return a hat that the seller lied about."
1.0,I purchased the polarized pair and they are 100% not polarized. I do like them just disappointed I didn't get what I paid for...
1.0,Terrible sizing.
1.0,The hat is beautiful but doesn’t fit. Not even close. Definitely not once size fits most. I’ll have to return it.
1.0,"Looks can be deceiving. Does not look like the picture. Ordered burgundy, lighter in color, thin material and looks absolutely cheaply made. You get what you paid for!"
1.0,"Does not fit as expected, moreover, after the item was returned, the seller never issued a refund."
1.0,The band won't stay on the watch face. It appears that the spring that holds the band to the watch is much thinner than the  spring for the original band. I sent it back once but the second one did it as well.
1.0,Doesn’t hold a charge and not easy to use at all
1.0,Order 2-3 sizes bigger
1.0,"I ordered the ring without reading reviews. Its light but cute. But in the band it says ""aways in my heat"" like others have said. So I returned it and got a new ring. Same misspelling in the band. Skip it and order something else."
1.0,Very cheaply made. The Buffalo print is a sticky piece of contact paper that overlays a really cheap earring. Not worth the hassle to return
1.0,These were not the quality hot socks usually are. I spent 15 dollars on 6 pairs of socks that all ripped holes within an hour of wearing them
1.0,These gloves are not like the picture at all. The material is very thin and transparent and there is no ornamental stitching as shown. Not to mention the fingers are poorly sized and sewn. The pinky is absurdly long and some of the fingers are too tight. Very dissatisfied.
1.0,originally I gave this sweater a 4 star for the color.  it runs extremely small and the finishing is horrible.<br />also not tags what so ever not even a care tag so not sure I believe this is not legal according to custom regulations etc....
1.0,Didn't like the sharp edges of the wire it's already ripping the mask😐
1.0,"I have purchased this shirt four times, each a different design or color, and I have loved all of them EXCEPT this one.<br /><br />The fabric is entirely different from the other shirts. It is scratchy, thick and has no stretch. The sewing is sloppy and doesn’t line up with the stripes.<br /><br />But most importantly, this shirt STUNK like nothing I have ever experienced. It smelled like a combination of the rankest food smells and formaldehyde.<br /><br />It went straight into the washer with Persil Intense Fresh scent and I have never known that detergent to fail, but fail it did. It took THREE washes to even begin to remove the odor.<br /><br />Between the odor, the scratchy fabric and unflattering seams, I’m not even donating it to Goodwill. I am tossing this one."
1.0,I did not receive the 3t shirt.. just the adult one 🙁<br /><br />The point was to have matching shirts
1.0,"No compression at all , material is very thin and they run big<br />I ordered a small at 145 pounds 5'7"
1.0,This would have been a great top if it had been much longer. The front is as high as my bellybutton and the back falls just short of the top of my buttocks. It is being returned.
1.0,I wear a woman's small and I couldn't even get the small on (top or bottom)  it was so tight.  Perhaps the small is a juniors size?
1.0,"What a waste of money. Delivered 30 seconds ago and going straight in the trash. They are so huge, no normal human can wear them. These are sized for Andre The Giant, so if that's not you... don't bother."
1.0,Nunca lo recibe
1.0,"Bought a Large in this because size chart said a large was a size 10, got it and it clearly says 6 in the shirt."
1.0,"The lenses were not polarized and the frame was not Cerakote. They were just black lenses, gloss black frame with no markings to indicate style, model number or other typical Oakley markings found on the inside of the frame arms. The glasses arrived in an unmarked, white box with no soft case or anything else to denote that they were Oakley's.<br />My guess is that they were counterfeits.<br />Very disappointed in the entire process..."
1.0,This thing breaks the first time I put it on my hand
1.0,This sucks the photo is too big the nose covers half your face
1.0,What. What is this? This is not in the model picture. This has an enormous pouch pocket thingie on the behind. This is just about THEE most unflattering cut - it has to be a joke. I kind of want to re order it because it’s so absurd it has to be a mistake. I was floored and had to take pictures of this thing. Super disappointed.
1.0,"Sending this sweater back. It’s someehing I could purchase at Walmart for $10.  The material is cheap, and it looks nothing like the photos. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Too big to wear. I don't usually like giving negative input, but I would save your money. I was pretty disappointed."
1.0,Was more expensive than comparable towels and was small and flimsy...disappointed
1.0,It broke the first day into 2 pieces first time we touched it. Going to send it back.
1.0,"The sweater arrived looking like an elephant had worn it.  The sleeves were sooo long, the front panels sagged low and the back was hiked up. Never again."
1.0,"I work in a hospital and this lanyard was put under almost no stress. Simply hangs around my neck holding 1 badge. In less than 1 year, the clip broke free from the lanyard part. Very disappointing."
1.0,Bought this for my husband as a replacement for his wedding ring; a coin ring I purchased from a seller on Etsy who no longer is in business. Within a few hours my husband's finger was nasty green. Gave to him for Christmas so now I feel extremely bad.
1.0,The material is super cheap and shiny. It’s like the material used for costumes. A shame because in the pic it’s beautiful
1.0,Very poorly made.  Quality is poor.
1.0,Really bad material gets dirty fast
1.0,Does this look black and blue???? Really???
1.0,"Poor quality, cheap material overall very disappointed"
1.0,"This would be a great product if it looked as shown in the display picture.  However, the legs openings are very wide - 13.1 inches. They look very baggy. After two size 14 jean purchases, I had high expectation for the shorts. If they had been the same width at the inseam as the jeans (10.5 inches), they would have worked. As a suggestion, the legs should be tapered."
1.0,"I have had this for less than 2 months but the strap kept coming off.  Last week, it fell off my wrist, hit the concrete and cracked. Now the touch screen does not work. Only works for tracking my sleep cycle now."
1.0,Quality was poor.
1.0,The dress did not meet my expectations the size chart was very incorrect.
1.0,"Pretty scarf for the price. Color and print as shown.<br />TOO BAD that it wasn't sewn correctly. On one side there is a 2&#34; area where the sewing machine didn't meet the fabric, so the thread is going across and the material is hanging underneath.<br />I suppose I could get a needle and thread to fix it but I shouldn't have to."
1.0,The lens broke.
1.0,Very uncomfortable would not recommend
1.0,These boots were very comfortable and I would have loved to use them daily but after 3 days the shoe has separated from the sole. It was only glued to the sole. Not stitched. I was VERY disappointed in them. I'm NOT going to throw them away but will now need to have them repaired and buy another pair of shoes I CAN depend upon
1.0,The design looked faded before the first wash.
1.0,Broken charm in lousy condition
1.0,Missed the return deadline.  Too large for a small (the top). The shorts fit well. Go figure. Very nice if I could wear it.
1.0,Didn’t last more than a couple days before it broke apart. Measurement was also smaller than advertised.
1.0,Uncomfortable lump in middle of shoe and 1/2 size too large. Just plain ugly. Returned. Look cheap.
1.0,Horrible bag. The lining inside is not tacked down so every time you take anything out EVERYTHING wants to come out. Too bad no one else mentions this or I would not have bought and been stuck with it. It arrived while I was out of town and I missed the return window so I’m stuck.
1.0,I only wore a pair once and the stone fell out.
1.0,It came broken in two pieces.  The spiral had snapped off from the stud at the base.  It cannot be fixed.
1.0,Has absolutely 0 Magnetic Properties. Wont even pick up or hold a needle. From inside or out side of the ring.  I will be returning.
1.0,It fits for a child's wrist and not for a grown woman's wrist.
1.0,These are so large that it's difficult to walk. It's the enormous top part that doesn't come close to anchoring the foot---huge gap between the top of the foot and the band on the slipper. The size of the bottom was correct but not the top. Big waste of money. No wonder they were so cheap.
1.0,Very easily broken and made from cheap plastic bands
1.0,"My daughter already used several that were ok, but after she realized majority of the charms are broken and cracked. Wouldn’t recommend."
1.0,"returned it, so unflattering on a big chest."
1.0,"I've been using this for a week. Works great, decent looking, and price was affordable. I haven't checked the power reserve, but wearing it 6 hours a day will give enough power to stay over night. Highly recommend.<br /><br />Update: It's been 6 months since I bought this watch, and it stopped working without any specific reasons..."
1.0,Good if you want your kid to be very sad when it breaks in two pieces during normal sword-like playing.
1.0,"Most uncomfortable shirt if ever bought.  The size was correct, VERY thick, heavy, low quality shirt.  Horrible, SHINY, iron on design.  I do not recommend this at all."
1.0,Shirt is very cute. However it is very short for the size I ordered.
1.0,Fits much smaller than listed.  I usually like things to fit smaller but this was way to small. It fit my 7 year old. Plus it is very thin as well. I returned immediately.
1.0,Arrived with only one speaker working....and the one that did work sounded tinny and legend and cut out...I was gonna try an keep it with only the one speaker working but even that was CRAP...long story short...YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR
1.0,"Heart already fell off, my mom wore it for only 2 days! Smh"
1.0,The sole of the right boot was punctured.  Garbage.
1.0,"Unfortunately, I only received the skirt, there was no top in my order. I paid for a 2-pc dress, but got only one"
1.0,Came in crumpled up and unusable
1.0,"Product cut differently than the image. Poor fit, not happy with this top."
1.0,"After reading good reviews, I bought this hoping to replace my aftermarket band that kept falling off the Gear Fit 2, which I purchased to replace the OEM band that wouldn't stay closed.  Unfortunately, the metal clasp of this one would not stay closed and kept springing open.  Also, one side of the band wouldn't stay attached to the device, and the other side almost wouldn't come off.  I'm returning it, sadly.  Ultimately, putting this band on changed my situation from having my Gear Fit 2 fall off once every few days and losing it a few times but luckily finding it each time, to not being able to have the band stay on my wrist more than a few seconds without opening or detaching.<br /><br />On the other hand, I did not experience the pin tool durability problems I read about in at least one other review, and the band was easy to resize.  The installation instructions were poorly translated and made no sense whatsoever, but installation is so straightforward that the instructions were unnecessary.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I think I solved my problem with the replacement band by carfully swapping the connector bracket with the OEM bracket.  Nothing from this purchase was useful for that."
1.0,"Item is two sizes too small. Package sticker said XL size, but it is M to S."
1.0,So it's completely  see through and the straps are very short so if you have a chest at all don't bother. I'm 5'8 140 lb and chesty. It's longer and wider than it looks in the pic it looks like I have on a white trash bag nothing like the flowy summer dress in the picture.
1.0,"One pair came faded gold with black. Same pair had bad clasp, wouldn’t close even with pressure. Don’t waste your money."
1.0,a little too yellow
1.0,It's not cut right at all. Won't fit the side of the watch where the pins go. So makes it completely useless. I can't stress enough not to order this product.
1.0,Not a very comfortable material. Had to return.
1.0,"Wore this to a ball. The tape came loose during the middle of the evening. I had not been wearing it for more than 2 hours at that point. I had to excuse myself to the ladies' room and remove it. I should have just gone bra-less, which is what I ended up doing anyway."
1.0,Request to return because top was too small never heard back from seller so I now have a top that’s too small that I can’t wear or return
1.0,The waist was not pleated as pictured. It’s not made from quality material.
1.0,Made for someone with a TINY head. It is cute but I can't wear it.
1.0,The fabric is really thin and cheap. It arrived without the hairbow.
1.0,This dress is COMPLETELY SHEER. I was wearing black underwear and it was clear as day. I would never wear this out in public. It's more like bedroom lingerie if you like that kind of thing. I requested a refund and got denied unless I would send a photo.
1.0,Very cute color but the major flaw is the material does not wear well at all.  My daughter wores these one day and they are ruined.  Luckily i only got for her Halloween costume but should have lasted longer
1.0,The nipple ring came damaged (screw rusted) and one screw was loose and the ring fell apart before I even tired it on. Very poorly made.
1.0,I bought a size XL and couldn't even think about putting this on. It fit my friend who's a size Medium.  It looked so good on her that I gave it to her. Its actually very pretty.
1.0,"The fit was nice, surprisingly. I told my husband “look at this sweet dress, it was only $15!” I tried to wash it (on cold, delicate cycle) before wearing it out and the blue floral print bled all over. It stained the rest of the dress as well as the other piece of clothing I washed with it."
1.0,"This arrived with no holes in it, and since I don’t own an awl, I am returning it immediately."
1.0,The watched only worked for about 15 minutes once we took it out of the package.  We couldn't get it to light up or to even show the time.
1.0,"I had high hopes for these polishing cloths after purchasing some earlier that didn't work at all.  These were barely any better.  They are nice and large, but the cleaning part of the cloth doesn't have enough tarnishing solution to work.  It takes a LOT of rubbing to clean any tarnish off.  My hands hurt (arthritis) so the less work, the better.  I purchased some other cloths (yellow ones) that work much much better."
1.0,Never got a chance to wear it. It broke... Poor quality
1.0,Looks nice but I was very disappointed it’s not sterling silver it’s fake it changed color right after me wearing it a few times
1.0,Odd sized waist - not proportional to rest of jersey
1.0,The clasp broke in a week.
1.0,"Not worth it, came with a lens popped out, bent cheap metal, and wrong color"
1.0,"Nothing like the photo...the back is completely different...it is stitched with white thread,so you can see it. Dont know where these companies get their photos...but at best it's a cheap copy...material issothinits see thru"
1.0,I purchased a XL Tshirt and arrives a Small (S) Tshirt!!
1.0,This product is not at all what it looks like in the picture. Do not purchase it. It took forever to get to me. Horrible material almost like swimsuit material. Buyer beware. I have to pay shipping to send it back after the company lied. Comes from China. Don’t waste your time and money!
1.0,"This is the poorest quality suit I've ever tried. Went to put it on and feared it would tear so didn't. Asked for the free return as advertised on Amazon web page and they first asked for a photo of problem (did they want me to tear it????) and then said I could return but had to pay cost (US to Canada!) and send them a tracking 3. This is a scam, big time.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01MS0A9TD Dokotoo Womens Vintage Classic Strappy Padded High Waist Stripes Plus Size Color Block One Piece Swimsuit Swimwear Black 3XL]]"
1.0,"The shipping cost is almost the price of the dress. When the dress arrived it had a HORRIBLE smell when I opened the bag. I had to shower once I took it off. The length of the dress made me trip as I was trying it on. The cost of the dress, shipping, cleaners, and alteration was NOT worth it!!!"
1.0,"Size up for sure, 2 sizes if possible"
1.0,the fingers are too skinny. One of the seems was undone right after taking it off of the cardboard they come shipped on. my son is 5 average height
1.0,Turned green after one wear. Very light weight.
1.0,It was clear. Not white
1.0,"Great dress but way too small, order 2-3 sizes larger"
1.0,"You can see tattoos through material!!! It states that you can’t, but you can!"
1.0,The second time I wore them they broke on the side right around the emblem.  Don't waste your money
1.0,Washed twice and the print is flaking off horribly.  We own a ton of t shirts and have never had this problem with any other.  I ended up tossing it.  Sad.
1.0,Broken after a few uses...
1.0,"You get what you paid for, just wish I didn’t forget to return it. Didn’t care for the material and kind of box shaped"
1.0,Cheap looking and far smaller that the size shown on the lable.
1.0,Only buy this if you have a very small head.
1.0,My neck was green this is not silver
1.0,"The “protective coating” has already started to peel, and we just opened the box last night. DO NOT BUY!"
1.0,I was so excited about this dress but it just looks awful on me. The pockets stick out and make my hips look huge.
1.0,Clips do not fit on windows. Waste of time. Very disappointed.
1.0,"No buenos, material demasiado corriente"
1.0,Lasted less than 2 months before the straps and handles sewing came apart.<br />So cheaply made...
1.0,"Leather cracked within 1 week of use where it wraps around the quick release.  Looked great, but not durable at all."
1.0,No good its to much thin clothes
1.0,This would fit a child but not an adult.
1.0,"I don't know who these gloves were modeled for but that man had some seriously long thumbs! These gloves were supposed to be a classy gift for my husband and turned out to be a belly laugh when the thumb was longer than the fingers! Obviously, they are being returned. Wake up quality control!"
1.0,"very cheap material,i returned it."
1.0,"The rubber nubs peel right off....as does the stitching around the top..Very, very poor quality"
1.0,They were red not fuchsia
1.0,"They are really hard to install, felt like I was going to break my frame."
1.0,These were not squat proof and were sheer. They fit well though
1.0,The holes for the buttons were very poorly stiched. They basically cut the slots so the buttons could go through and the shredded threads grab the buttons when you try to undo the best and get stuck. Basically can’t get out of the vest without a fight and worry of pulling off a button. Very dissatisfied
1.0,Never fit me  súper mad
1.0,Around my ankles before I even got in the car. Not worth the money.
1.0,"UPDATE TO UPDATE: These pants have started to shred all over. Not just the seams. The other pocket is going now. I’m not buying these again since I’ve only had them a few months and I’ve had a pair of courderoy leggings from another brand for YEARS without even a seam wearing. Disappointed because the colors and feel wearing them are amazing. See photos of both pockets and random holes which are near the seams but look like the fabric is unraveling rather than tearing.<br /><br />I loved these pants for two wears and washes, then the back rivers started to rip out of the pockets. Im going to write the company and then I will either raise or lower the stars. Otherwise they fit great, have a nice color to them though I do see how the lighter colors are “see through” since they have a transparency to them, and I love the feel of them. Not too heavy or too light. I’m 5’ 10” and about 205 lbs and they come to the top of my foot and sit nicely around my waist without digging into my stomach. They have cute little jewels as the buttons and in the rivets. I’d buy more if I knew they wouldn’t all rip at the rivets. Stay tuned for update!"
1.0,Very cheap quality and very plain looking
1.0,The insert is cheaply made. It has already broken down after just a couple of weeks and separated from the flap that holds it into the wallet.
1.0,was advertised as a wide width but it is not...very tight and uncomfortable
1.0,"Bought for Christmas 2014, Tarnished after only 1 wearing, I neglected to return it in a timely fashion and so I ended up throwing it away this past weekend."
1.0,Lmao it would have a 0 if i could! These pants are terribly made and of poor quality. The size i ordered is absolutely not the size i received even if the pants say they are. They didnt even stretch? And high waisted? Yeah okay way to blatantly lie about your product.
1.0,Nothing at all like pictured on FB that took me to this order page. You can get something like this at Spencer's for 2.99. Over paid buy $7.00 and very disappointed.
1.0,"Bought this for my mom as a gift and though the idea of it was cute and the card message it is attached to, the necklace broke within a few days of wearing. So I was saddened when my mother called to tell me this"
1.0,"Adorable little earrings but one of them won’t clasp right and easily comes undone. Thus, I don’t wear them for fear of losing one of them. Frustrating!"
1.0,runs way to small
1.0,"3 days after I bought it and charged it, it doesn’t work."
1.0,Not at all as advertised. Vacuum packed and an absolute wrinkled mess. Fit isn’t flattering and the pictures are misleading.
1.0,Falling apart and difficult to clean. Very disappointed
1.0,This is the weirdest shape and material. It’s big in places and small in places . It’s weird shiny material. I’m super unhappy
1.0,Watch arrived in seemingly good condition. Band broke the next day. Would not order again!
1.0,Came in bent and just cheap. Not good for cartiledge piercings. Will not work with other labret backs either.
1.0,Sent them back
1.0,I ordered these boots for my 5 year old on October 15th...today is November 7th... not even a month later and they are trashed I’m so upset she has only worn them maybe 5 times max
1.0,I want what I want not a replacement stone. Three strikes you're out.
1.0,"The fabrics & color is so good, but the size of the sleeves is small! Ridiculously small! My daughter is size 4 and she had her sleeves tight! Only 4 1/2 inches! I'm really not going to mail to return merchandise! I think I lost my money!  Imagine the model of the pics is  00!"
1.0,Not flattering at all . Plus the arms run small on this . I usually wear a small and I ordered the small but wasn’t happy with the look of this . So I said I sent it back .
1.0,"This scarf is not the color in the photo. It is also not cotton. It is a darker more mustard color. I am a former clothing designer and when I saw the color, I decided I would simply lighten it up with a quick dip in warm water with bleach. It was worth experimenting with, and I was willing to take a chance as it was inexpensive, and need a bright yellow scarf for a trip I'm leaving on shortly. If this fabric were cotton, the color would have changed immediately.  Cotton fabric + bleach solution = color change. Always. There is no cotton fabric dye that has no reaction to a bleach solution.  30 minutes of soaking later there was no color change whatsoever. I rinsed the fabric out, tossed in the dryer and it came out perfectly smooth and unwrinkled, and still extremely mustard. There is no texture, as one would expect from cotton fabric. It's got a slick polyester feeling to it.  Sadly I have no use for a cheap mustard synthetic scarf. I gambled and lost!"
1.0,I am lover of dresses especially rockabilly dresses. This was so poorly made and I need it by Friday. Disappointed
1.0,"These were the smallest earrings I have ever seen in my life.  They are so small that when I dropped one, I couldn't find it, so I just got rid of the other one.  DO NOT PURCHASE!"
1.0,"What an awful phone system! I ordered over the phone and after getting my credit card info, I found ordering and getting out of the automated system really frustrating. The voice-controlled system didn't follow my instructions and added on some upgrade that I didn't want and there was no way of talking to someone or fixing the problem through their system. I tried and tried to find a way to go back and it was obvious they didn't want me to be able to fix a problem with the order. When I called a different phone number to trying to fix it, it is a number that only deals with delivery, not possible to fix the problem before it sends. Now I have to send it back and they wanted me to cover the shipping and handling costs. The marketability potential of the product is good, but they seem to be making a lot of enemies quickly. The ""upgraded"" glasses magnify slightly when fully extended, but they look ridiculous when extended and don't work at all if you don't have them extended. Neat idea, terrible product."
1.0,"Total junk! Zipper fell apart the first time I wore these, never even washed them. Would never buy these again.<br /><br />JIM"
1.0,Horrible dress!!! If you are skinny girl don't buy it. It's too big. Nothing like the picture. I return it.
1.0,I bought this hoping for the best even though I read all of the reviews about the writing on the shirt. To my disappointment the writing on the shirt is completely unreadable. It is sad that this super-cute item is such poor quality. Returned it immediately
1.0,The dress came damage. Very disappointed I'm going to return it.
1.0,Complete trash
1.0,Kids size
1.0,"Cute but very small, give them to my niece,"
1.0,Too small & tight.<br />Definitely wrong
1.0,This bra is terrible!<br />What a waste of money I bought two of these in different colors and they suck.<br /><br />It won't even stick to keep my boobs together and it just falls right off your skin!!!<br /><br />Wish I would of tried using it within time to return it but it was too late to return this junk.
1.0,I bought two of these one for myself and one for a gift. These are horrible!! Very cheaply made! They came practically falling apart! When you put them on the clip constantly comes undone and my boyfriend actually lost his watch while working not noticing it had came undone. I would not recommend buying this watch band!
1.0,"So tiny, I had to return."
1.0,not flattering..very large more like a trench coat ..not cut to fit..very bad tailoring..i don't recommend this piece i got rid of it..
1.0,"Material sucks. I ask for leather, not plastic"
1.0,Es de Baja calidad la tela parece papel  orror Mala compra.
1.0,Cheap made material
1.0,Did not like that the bodice was a different material than the skirt. Too long waisted for me
1.0,"I got the blue/grey colorblock sweatshirt. Most importantly: it's not a sweatshirt. It's made of really cheap fabric, like Halloween-costume-from-a-bin cheap, so even if you decided to just use it as a top you're going to be uncomfortable. As other reviewers have pointed out, the seams aren't going to last very long, it was probably assembled very quickly to get as much out the door as they could and it shows."
1.0,In real life looked nothing like on the pictures. Returned
1.0,This frontal shed so bad I’ve never seen anything like this before. My goodness!
1.0,This bracelet broke within 24 hours of wearing it. And the “stone” or “gem” is a piece of plastic shaved to look like some sort of rock.
1.0,Ring is very cute but the stones are the same size as the post and it slides around.  Put it in a conch piercing that is  10 years old and the stones made my piercing infected.
1.0,They looked tiny but were bigger.
1.0,1star this suit wouldn’t stay on the bra strap loops. It would’ve been absolutely cute but for that I was extremely disappointed with the breast structure & tiny clear straps included I used some I already had and they still kept coming out the entire evening I had to keep adjusting shifting and pulling til I got tipsy I let it all hang!! Oh oh yeah and the snap between the legs also kept unsnapping exposing my goodies had to put on black bottoms for security. I want my money back.
1.0,They do not perform as described. Wrong instructions with them but that didn’t matter as simple to use they just don’t work.
1.0,"I’ve never before seen anything so sloppily made and sold on Amazon. It’s mind boggling! Where do I start? 1) This fabric isn’t fabric at all but more of a rippable thick tissue paper, 2) None of the plaid pattern matched up (every single seam didn’t line up), 3) I believe this was sewn in a matter of minutes - maybe child labor in China? Red threads were clumped and pieced back together then sewn in at the seam lines, and oh yes number 4) I ordered a small and received this tissue paper cloth in what looks like would fit an XXL woman. I tried to describe this as best as I could. This isn’t a favorable review, however, it’s an honest one. I’m returning this product obviously."
1.0,Son muy duras
1.0,Returned not flattering
1.0,This HAT is trash.  Once it is washed you'll be lucky to get it to fit on an orange.
1.0,"seller did indicate that the item was 'Japanese' fit, but I did not expect it to fit a small child. Additionally, I have had problems attempting to return the item."
1.0,"I bought these based on the description on Amazon.com.  I have read the instructions and tried to find information online about them, but I cannot adjust the nose bridge.  In fact, the nose bridge cut into my face."
1.0,Headphones don't work.
1.0,"Waited way too long & was made very small, more for a child. Will never order from them again."
1.0,Although the price is cheap but the quality is not worth 1$. The color is a little bit darker and it looks better in the picture!!! I don't recommend it to anyone. You have to plug the battery by yourself!
1.0,After using for less than a month one of the metal hooks that holds the strap on has broken. Otherwise it’s a good bag which I get tons of compliments on.
1.0,"Multi link chain is very delicate and that chain broke while putting it on the first time, much less wearing. The chain has low quality metal and can be bent easily with a thumbnail."
1.0,Came broken. Necklace is so cheaply made don't recommend
1.0,TOO SMALL THE LOOK WAS GOOD AND THE MATERIAL COLORS WERE FINE
1.0,"Something is wrong inside the boots my daughter 16 months old size 5, can’t step all the way down in the boot with the heals, even though there is plenty room for her toes, so they keep falling off.. just a poor design... too bad they looked so cute."
1.0,"It was a good sized back pack. The zipper was poor quality, very hard to open. WORST of all is that it had a super strong synthetic plastic smell that would not go away. It was quite offensive. Left in garage for over a week thinking it would go away, but it did not. Had to return."
1.0,Stone fell out second time I wore it very sad
1.0,I measured as suggested.  Barely came up to calf . Very disappointed.
1.0,These are the absolute worst. I cannot tell you how horrible these wore. Broke 3 trying to install.
1.0,Not even close to what isn’t showing I the picture. Fits super small! And quality is not satisfactory
1.0,Turns black.
1.0,this material looks like it will fall apart after first washing.  It s awful
1.0,"When I first saw this, I immediately fell in love and I had to have it. I even put it on my baby shower registry. I didn't receive it for the shower, so I ordered it myself. So when it finally came in, the size tag was on the outside instead of the inside. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed. So I gave it only one star because I love the print so much I'm going to use it, but having the tag on the outside is ridiculous."
1.0,"This watch was super cute but the band broke 2 months after purchase, and the return window is only 30 days."
1.0,The rings seem to be coated in a cheap layer of film that peeled off to reveal a plain silver nose hoop.
1.0,Glass shattered after 9 days of wear in a strictly office environment. No trauma that I can remember. I looked down to check the time and 50% of the face was shattered. Very disappointed as I spent hours trying to find the perfect watch. I will never purchase from this company again.
1.0,No good.👎👎👎
1.0,in the picture they look larger but when they arrived they were small i kept them because i didn't want to go thru the trouble of sending these small earrings back
1.0,Disliked. The hat wasn’t deep enough. Maybe for a toddler. Returned.
1.0,basically fell apart after using about 4 times
1.0,Looked like the Ts I usually get but the grab on to your skin
1.0,Cheap material. Medium fits like an XL.
1.0,Didn’t fit the blaze at all. Returned immediately
1.0,The cheapest made thing I have ever bought. The crown came with the Velcro not attached to one side so my son never got to wear it and the Scepter is like it should be sold at a dollar store. So sorry to say this but it's true.
1.0,"The sunglasses were fairly much as indicated. However the &#34;decorative&#34; box was significantly too thin to contain the glasses. To keep it closed they wrapped packing tape around the box leaving a large bulge which strained the glasses inside. They also placed a large sticker with product info on the box.  If you intend to use the box as a gift box, as I did, you should find another vendor...."
1.0,Frumpy like a potato sack. Zero shape.
1.0,Design was ok but material was cheap looking. Had to return.
1.0,Looks cheap... Pictures are. It what they appear. Looks like it came out of a fun all machine.
1.0,Started falling apart after 3 months. Not worth the price.
1.0,"They look large online, but were very tiny in person.  I sent them back....way too small."
1.0,"POOR QUALITY,.  The material ripped during the first wear. I emailed the seller and got nothing in return.  Absolutely terrible!"
1.0,Product had gem not in line with chhakra and had a hole on side through resin. No care was taken to make this.
1.0,"will be returning, have not yet had chance...run to small"
1.0,Both necklaces broke within a week.  One of them the clasp snapped and the other chain broke.
1.0,I didn’t even get the correct dress.
1.0,Wore it once and it already broke in several places!
1.0,"For the price, i wasn’t expecting the best, but i was at least expecting a little bit of sparkle."
1.0,This stuff does absolutely nothing to ward of dogs from chewing.  It smells absolutely awful and causes you to cough up a lung.
1.0,Not what I expected. The turquoise is not polished and shiny. It has a muted look. But the price is low.
1.0,Size up up up
1.0,"I bought this product thinking it might be helpful for the mask mandates in my county. It looked lightweight and breathable - I was hoping it would help with my anxiety about my mouth and nose being covered, while keeping me safe. Unfortunately, I never got to test it because it doesn’t stay up! I didn’t feel right returning it because it had already been on my face, so it’s just sitting in a drawer."
1.0,The material is not what it looks like in the picture. I was expecting a normal cotton blend sweat shirt and this was a weird shiny material very cheap
1.0,"Band was as pictured. Loved the colors. But can’t use it, it won’t fit my Apple Watch."
1.0,The fabric on this is terrible. Like scuba suit material. The shirt is cute and quite a statement piece but couldn’t get over the fabric being so weird
1.0,"I was looking for jogger sweatpants. Disappointed in these. They are more of a knit material - not polar fleece. I was expecting sweatshirt material because of the ""sweatpants"" title. Will be returning these."
1.0,"These are really cute, but after only 1 time of wearing them the cape part starts to fray and unravel.  If you are ok with eventually cutting off the cape, they will be fine for you."
1.0,Balck ones are see through. You can see the whole buttcrack standing or squatting. Can't wear underwear because they will show too. Material varies by color. Some of them are super clingy ans some are more traditional yoga pant material.
1.0,My dad  received the apron and no chef hat?!?! And this was a gift that’s the sucky part WHERE IS THE CHEF HAT?!?!
1.0,Though the rings are adjustable it still requires small hand.
1.0,Was not all good.
1.0,"Mine smells so moldy I can't wear it. Went online to see what I could do to get rid of the moldy smell ... right now it's in ziplocked baggy wrapped in newspaper. I'll check it in a few days and see if it has helped. If not, I won't be able to wear it! Too bad because I really like it. I had it on my wrist the day I got it and one of my friends said &#34;man, I smell mold!&#34; - they didn't know I had it on because I had long sleeves on. Quite frankly, I couldn't stand it anymore myself. That's when I online hunt began."
1.0,It doesn’t fit right
1.0,Purchased two & both are being returned.<br />The material is so thin you can literally see your hand thru two layers. For the price I was expecting much better quality. I wear plenty of dri fit athletic shirts and know the material doesn’t have to be paper thin to work.
1.0,no compression whatsoever... a 40.00 teeshirt
1.0,"Ordered a 3X, this was so small it would have probably fit a 12 year old."
1.0,I'm not sure how to add pictures but instead of getting a belly button ring I got an iPhone 6 plus case...
1.0,No pants just the top.
1.0,"Not delicate and pretty like the picture. They are big, ugly, and cheap looking without the level of detail shown in the pictures. They arrived without the backs as well. They are going in the garbage."
1.0,"Despite ordering the size I usually get, it ended up being much smaller than what it was supposed to be."
1.0,the Gloves are a thin stretchy material that actually stretches too much. The fabric slides around on her hand and causes her to loose grip.  Almost as if the gloves are gripping the bar but her hand inside just slips around in the glove when it stretches and causes her blisters to be worse. If the material were more sturdy like elastic and less like swimsuit fabric it would be better.
1.0,It was very pretty. The earrings are a little big and heavy.
1.0,This shirt material is like paper. It wrinkles SO easily and looks SO cheap in person! Not at all as chic as the photos on here. All of the buttons even have threads sticking out. Do not buy from this vendor 🚫🚫🚫
1.0,"Horrible material, not good quality"
1.0,"They do not look like the quality pictured, AT ALL."
1.0,"Really, really bummed about this dress. Contemplated keeping it and trying to redo the sleeves but just so. Much. Material. Fabric was very nice, but there was so much of it. I could have cut and sewed a whole other shirt."
1.0,I don't like the material and it needs to be ironed
1.0,Arrived very heavily tarnished and really to stiff to wear.  Returned.
1.0,"its not the real  Betsey Johnson necklace, its a poor replica. The ring inside the locket broke off after wearing it only Once! Very unhappy, wish it weren't advertised as BJ, guess I have to buy my jewelry elsewhere"
1.0,"Too heavy, flop forward. Doesn't lay against the ear."
1.0,"There should have been 24, only has 22, and package says 36 on it? So package has obviously been opened before. There is no way to even get these things into your nose. They are TOO flimsy."
1.0,After receiving these my son refused to wear bc they looked like Frankenstein shoes. He thought he could wear these shoes as normal every day shoes just with wheels on. If these had a better design so they weren't so Frankenstein-ish this would've been money well spent.
1.0,"These fit strangely loose in the hips on lean muscular man. 5' 8"" 145lbs. Returned this pair but a diferent color of same pants fit better."
1.0,"Made very cheap, avoid!"
1.0,The clasp broke the first time I tried to wear it.  Very cheap.
1.0,I ordered A size bigger than I normally wear.roo tight. Wash it in gentle and pockets unrevelled. Came out a wrinkled mess. I threw it away!
1.0,I’m really disappointed in this dress. I’m 5’6 and length is awkward in terms of which shoes to wear. The fit is not comfortable which is surprising because I have another dress from this brand that is amazingly so. The colors are much brighter in person and it makes the overall appearance pretty cheap. The skirt is rough and a different material than the top.
1.0,Got the XL I'm a size 10.<br />38C top. I'm bummed because<br />this is a cute suit. The top straps don't<br />adjust and it's so tight. I'm shocked because I'm normally a L but figured I should go one bigger because of others posts.
1.0,"THIS HAT CLEARLY SAYS ""CAPTAN"" IN THE PICS, BUT WHEN IT SHOWS UP IN THE MAIL, IT SAYS ""CAPTAIN"" ON IT. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. IVE NEVER BEEN SO LET DOWN BY CORRECT SPELLING. I WANT MY MONEY BACK"
1.0,"Thought it was great at first.  Used about 6 times and all of a sudden the buckle would NOT RELEASE and on further inspection a screw had fallen out and the buckle just came all apart, (spring and parts and things)."
1.0,Me agrado el estilo.No me agrado la tela de mala calidad.Gracias
1.0,Too small and cheap quality
1.0,Faded fast after like 2 wears will not repurchase
1.0,Each and every one of these broke. This was poor quality!!
1.0,super cheap crap!!!!!!!<br /><br />The plastic is thin and the head of the hammer was tilted to one side. looked like something you might find at the dollar store.
1.0,I got so allergic to it my skin was swollen and red. Stay away!
1.0,"Horrible! Buttons are are horrible you can see the diaper in between the holes, looked like the outfit was ripped!"
1.0,Nothing like picture. Just a tube sock
1.0,The bras were flimsy and a couple of them had holes from moths(?). I returned the same day I tried them on. There was no way they were high impact.
1.0,"This shirt looks like a sewing project gone wrong. The collar and pocket flaps are so strange looking, like just a couple boxy pieces of fabric sewn on randomly. The sleeves are very large and billowy but the cuffs are too tight. Overall just very poor quality and I returned the shirt."
1.0,do not waste your money.
1.0,"Not glasses, more like thin plastic, look great but made me sick to my stomach when trying to drive in them."
1.0,"Really bad proportions, not like the picture at all. Very poor quality."
1.0,Color was more pink than beige .. very short
1.0,Who ever made the sizing cut lines on these failed so badly!!! I wear a 9 mens and cut them on the 9 line and they are way to small for my shoes so now they are just trash. Its like they didn't even try to make the lines match real shoe sizes they just threw some random lines on there.
1.0,I was pretty drunk when I bought this ( I think I thought it was funny) anyways it’s pretty thin and not the best  and the side had hole in it ...the print is awesome but I found out the eyes are by an artist and basically stolen....dear artist sorry I was drunk and didn’t read the reviews
1.0,"I guess you get what you pay for... the stone broken,<br />when we opened the bag, not sending it back to much trouble no more than we paid for it!"
1.0,I was super disappointed because the size is just way too smal I even ordered a large & it still was too smal super disappointed in the product
1.0,"When you buy a bag of 40 of anything you hope that all of them work and at most you're limited to one or two that don't work. In this bag of 40 pieces, only two worked and that's being generous. I tried each and every one of them and one worked great, the other barely glowed. All the other 38 pieces do work work at all. Stay clear. Do not waste you money on them!"
1.0,Recieved a solid bikini with no cut outs. Top had triangles the size of a slice of Sicilian pizza from new York and the bottoms were also solid designed as a scrunch butt thong. Going to order 1 more to see if they can get it right and if not will return both!!!
1.0,I bought the pack of glasses back in May & 2 out of the 3 are broken with careful use. Do yourselves a favor & spend the extra money for quality.
1.0,The eyelet on the shoe ripped though when tying shoe. Shoes were only worn several times.
1.0,Not the same color on both sides the band has to flip over to fasten so the inside shows its a much lighter color.  Looks ridiculous.
1.0,"I wear a large in nearly every piece of clothing I buy. I would need a 2X to fit into this jacket. Material was translucent, so that the poorly made shoulder pads were visible. Returned immediately."
1.0,These bags are no strong at all. After one month they all need to be thrown into the trash
1.0,"As said by nursegreeneyes, only one keychain, not a pair or set"
1.0,"packaging so small and simple, doubtful the product is new"
1.0,It was a little low cut for me. I knew it would be a little low cut but it was def not how I expected
1.0,Fabric is very cheap quality and dupatta is horrible. It just looks beautiful in the picture. Not comfortable. Not worthy. Disappointed.
1.0,"These pj's come out of the washer so wrinkled that they have to be ironed.  The sleeve cuffs are not sewn down, only tacked in one spot.  I really liked the original cotton version, bring them back."
1.0,This shirt should have been 100% cotton and isn't. I am allergic to polyester AND  I still had to pay postage to return the mis-advertised product.
1.0,Does not look like picture. Looks like oversized men’s T-shirt. Not flattering
1.0,Good quality leather and a good fit but the fingers are too square! It looks funny once you wear it. Also they’re priced too high compared to nicer looking gloves out on amazon. Going to return them.
1.0,"The blue colored tint came off after the first use. I rinsed it only with cold water to remove sweat and used the micro towel that comes with it and it came off. Poor quality, should have bought the real thing."
1.0,I really was looking forward to wearing them but the shoes were to small from the top area! Very disappointed. Now I’m trying to give them away.
1.0,the colors don't even match<br />weird fit
1.0,"spandex size does not fit properly to head.<br />My crown size is a 21 / hat size 7 (which is a female small), and spandex is still incredibly tight.<br /><br />Shrinkage crushes against eyelids /eye lashes, making it hard and painful to blink.<br /><br />Front seams in one of the hoods was also split due to a skipped stitch in sewing.<br /><br />would not buy again"
1.0,This does not have any glitter or bling on it
1.0,Sleeve were long and waist was short.<br />Sweater was very thin.<br />Not worth price so returned.
1.0,Way to small for ages 1 to 3. Not a time slip either. Very disappointed. Not as advertised and way to small. My grandson is 1 and a half and not very big nor are his feet and these are smaller than his 2t socks by carter's.
1.0,"The halfmoon/tassel part of the earring doesn't stay in place. There's nothing there preventing it from being turned on its side, which makes these look silly while wearing them.  I may use some glue to hold them in place, but only because I can't justify returning them at such a low price."
1.0,This is not true to size at all and the pants are made way to short!
1.0,The hat did not meet my expectations. It is just ok
1.0,"I ended up returning this bc the shape was just weird. It felt as though I cut the top of a pillow case and slipped into it. It had no give, or bounce. Very stiff."
1.0,Description is not accurate and you can see out of shield
1.0,I ordered the size that matched my measurements but it was too difficult to put on.
1.0,I ordered 5 of these and every one fell apart.  I can still use the clock and the 2 little eyes are kind of cute but the wings were unusable.
1.0,If your calf size is 18 or larger don’t buy too tight in the xl
1.0,looks like a clown suite
1.0,Gems kept falling off
1.0,Horrible. Looks like a pillow case
1.0,Had to return.  Not a flattering look.
1.0,Ripped pretty badly within the first few weeks of normal wear.
1.0,"Not even one star. It was broken in three days. Also, I was told that it is made with a toxic material."
1.0,Dislike. The material looks very different and the prize was cheap $11 while I purchased but they made $28 while shipping.
1.0,Had high hopes but it didn’t stay up on my 7 year old.
1.0,"I originally purchased this bag for a Christmas present last year.  It held up okay, but by the end of the dance season (July) it was ripped at the top by the zipper.  I purchased it again in September for my daughter's birthday since she liked the design, and it has already ripped again by the zipper.  My daughter is not rough with the bag, and only carries, tap, ballet and jazz shoes in it."
1.0,Flimsy and not well-made.
1.0,Material is thin and see through size runs extremely  small
1.0,"Beautiful bracelet, but doesn't fit a hair tie. great concept, poor execution."
1.0,These shoes don't have good quality. The ankle straps were uneven and the back of the shoes were extremely stiff. I had to return them. They looked very cute though.
1.0,I have been using these for 1 month and they already have a hole in the palm.  Not happy with the durability of these gloces.
1.0,"It's been over a month and a half and I still didn't get my necklace, it must be delivered by foot from China to the United States. Extremely dissapointed, I didn't even get any tracking information."
1.0,Does not work at all !!!! I’m very disappointed! It is a great looking watch and easy to read. I I followed the instructions but it did not work at all. What a
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:662f5ccb0f864490ee5ae80d018b9845]] I hate this product and I wouldn’t recommend anyone else wasting any $$$ on it !<br />First off it’s extremely soft , it’s not a hard eyeglass case so if someone were to accidentally sit on the box or toss the box in my backpack and it accidentally get smashed or squished some how my glasses would be destroyed! 😡<br />The item took forever to get here it took a month and a half ...<br />It’s definitely of very very poor quality! Don’t waste your money!"
1.0,"When I ordered the bracelet, it was black and orange. The item I received was blue and orange. I am sending for a replacement and will hopefully get the correct colors for my coaches by valentines day"
1.0,This 'choker' fell apart in my hands as I took it out of the package.  Never even made it to my neck to try on!!!
1.0,There was a hole in the dress in the strap.
1.0,"I ordered a medium, i was very disappointed,  this jumpsuit could not even pass my thighs waste of money. I would not recommend"
1.0,Ordered a xlg but it fits like a med. Very disappointed. Will NEVER order from them again!!
1.0,"At this price I might have expected them to last a month or two, but they are really junk - I only got about a week out of one pair & another was unusable out of the package.<br />I wore the black pair 3 times before the started pilling (which I know happens with fleece leggings) - but this was SEVERE pilling and looks trashy.  The brown pair had 2 runs in them before I even put them on - they were hidden so I wore them & surprisingly they didn't pill as bad as the black, but the runs got big enough after 4 uses to make them unusable.  The grey pair was threadbare on the top and completely unwearable out of the package.<br />Returning them after 2 weeks of getting the most out of them I possibly could."
1.0,Size small is actually a large. The cut wasn't knee length at all. Just horrible.
1.0,This product is very cheap. Do not purchase you will be very upset. I’m 5’3 and it’s a little pass my knees. I’ll be getting a refund and will never purchase from this company again
1.0,"Item received is NOTHING like what is pictured. The item received is sleeveless, shorter, does not have tails for tying, has two pockets, and has different buttons and stitching. The top is also very fitted and overall, a different style. Do NOT purchase!"
1.0,what a waste of money. the instructions are crap!
1.0,So scratchy I can't wear it.
1.0,these are hoop earrings
1.0,I used them less than 10 times and the arm fell off. Definitely do not recommend.
1.0,"SHORT is an understatement, needs to b about 3 inches longer/not as described"
1.0,I ordered the same dress in a different fit was completely different - same size! Unfortunately did not return in time to get my money back.
1.0,It was  horrible
1.0,"Cheap and useless. The push spring pins that hold the links together are two separate pieces. A cylinder and a rod. The cylinder is meant to stay in the link, but when using the tool that comes in the box or any tool for that matter, the tool/pin used to push the spring out is the same size/larger than the cylinder inside the link. This means that when you go to push the springs out of the links to resize the watch, the tool pushes the inner cylinder out of the link and permanently breaks the link. If you only push it half way through, then try to remove the spring it doesn’t come out. The tool is designed to travel all the way through the link, which pushes the cylinder out and breaks the watch. Any other watch uses a regular bobby-pin style spring and has no inner cylinder to break."
1.0,"Quality is poor. Seams are not even on both the sides of it looks awkward. Extremely low rise. If you have curves like me, stay away. They are barely covering the top of my butt. Don't plan on every wearing these!"
1.0,I don't think that I've ever had a mislabeled product until now I ordered these for my 9 year old daughter that I think isn't that tall for her age but when I received these tights they were more black then navy blue and when she tried the mm on the crotch was at her knee caps they looked like they would fit a child between 6-8 I ordered 10-12 unless these were meant for toddlers it was mislabeled and they were way to small
1.0,"These basically fell apart after a few days. They did not fit, very cheap and not worth the money you will be spending on it."
1.0,Tiny returned them
1.0,Cheaply made and design rubbed off within a day of wearing them. I guess that’s what happens when you purchase something at a lower price. I’d ask for a refund but it’s not worth my time to go through the trouble. Just don’t buy these. You’ll be disappointed
1.0,Halo ban broken - l wings stuck together.  I would not recommend this product.
1.0,Very disappointed in these. I love my old Nike sports bra and these just don’t meet the same quality. The elastic band is very cheaply made and seems as though it will not last very long. Such a shame
1.0,The fabric is too thin and clingy. I got a larger size than recommended so it fits loosely by because it is thin it shows all my lumps and buldges!
1.0,never ordered this
1.0,I returned them. Paper thin bottom. Nice color. Suggest you order one size larger.
1.0,"These are smaller than suspender buttons, my tailor said that they look like coat buttons."
1.0,Very flimsy..not wht I expected..
1.0,"Really ugly, strange material that does not conform to body or abide by the laws of gravity. Weird shape that is super unflattering. I’m convinced this isn’t the dress pictured. Beware"
1.0,Did not look like picture nor was it long enough. A waste of money
1.0,"The pants are really thin. I can see through them. I ordered an XL (normally a size 14) and there is no way I can even put them on. As soon as I finish this review, I'm going to try to return them. I'd return them even if they did fit."
1.0,The item arrived broken and I was very sad because it was for a theme party where my son was going to be Urkel. Not a very happy camper.
1.0,Wore for less than a week and the zipper part is pulling away from material
1.0,Terrible fit for me and felt cheap and scratchy
1.0,Reasonably priced product but the shipping was terrible.
1.0,"Not working, not in one piece.  Ugh."
1.0,"It was just awful.  Straps and tags inside the slipper scratch your feet up raw.  Socks might've cured, but they made the slippers not fit right.  With socks on, the slippers were too tight in places and slid off my foot in other places."
1.0,"Super disappointed. Looked great online in the pics. Arrived ill-fitting, cheaply made, and overall misrepresented in the pics. Bummer. :( Returning it as soon as I can get around to it."
1.0,Not made sturdy. Product came broken. I think it would be a pretty necklace if all the pieces were connected. End was broken off or the string broke.
1.0,"Absolutely terrible product....after one wash on cold....shirts coming apart.<br />Also, shirts shrank up a lot.....definitely would not recommend."
1.0,"Order a size 12, pajamas that arrived would have fit a year old baby"
1.0,I’ve bought these in the past and they lasted for months but this purchase broke after a week of wear.
1.0,Did not look like the picture at all. Do not buy!
1.0,WAY too small! I ordered a size 14 and it’s the size of a 6x. Very disappointing Christmas Eve gift
1.0,Bought this as a present for my gf and couldn't be more disappointed. Do not waste your money unless you want to pay for return shipping!!! Ear cuff was entirely misshapen on one side and the wave design was not uniform at all. Looks very cheap.
1.0,"I have purchase many scarfs, this is the worst quality, or worst quality control I have ever seen. The scarf is not straight at all. It look like a kid have to cut the scarf. The whole scarf is almost like a zig zag pattern. Have to return it."
1.0,"I don't know whether this was intentionally sent to me like this, but it arrived with a huge stain and several small holes in the front. I don't really know what else to say. The pictures speak for themselves."
1.0,I was excited to receive the product but received totally a different product
1.0,The clip just opens up & all your keys go everywhere! Save your money!
1.0,These are way too big to be kids gloves. They are the same size as adult small.
1.0,Ordered size C32 and they feel like A cup bra. Their sizing is inaccurate. Dont buy!
1.0,I was very disappointed when I saw my package. This bracelet is missing nearly all of the large stones and some smaller ones. The package wasn't even opened and you can see that stones have fallen out. This is a terrible product and needs to be returned. Do not waist your money.
1.0,Described as one size fits all. Well... no! Not a chance for me to wear it. Not an adult size. Fits my 3-year-old grandson tough.
1.0,This runs very small. Order the next size up!
1.0,Not loose around the toes
1.0,I ordered their largest size of 3X. These bras didn’t even fit my 15 year old petite  niece. Awful 😞 fit and very disappointed!! Will not recommend to anyone. This is a shame though as these bras are quite beautiful!
1.0,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT
1.0,They fall off when the winter blows !
1.0,I loved them when I got them ! I put them on and they turned my fingers green! So no I won't be ordering any more of them!!
1.0,I purchased these for my almost 4 year old daughter. And they are so big she can’t wear them. When I searched for them they showed up under toddler/little girl earrings. They are for more adult women. Maybe try to put the measurement in the description so people know.
1.0,I sent this dress back. The material was a thin polyester feel and itchy. The color was a weird peach/off pink. Not as pictured
1.0,Tarnished within the first couple of months .
1.0,I ordered for a 6 month old but these could fit a 2 year old
1.0,"TIRED OF MISREPRESENTED GOODS ON AMAZON? AVOID THIS SYNTHETIC, NOT CASHMERE, HAT!<br /><br />For the price, I expected these might be factory seconds, if not just the leftovers that weren't sold at wholesale. But this listing are simply using the manufacturer's name. NOT CASHMERE. NOT WOOL. No content tag, as required by law, and rough to the touch. To be certain, did the burn test and the fibers melt into hard beads of plastic when burned, so... SYNTHETIC.<br /><br />Even if you want a cheap acrylic hat, these are sewn my machine inside at the top, not one piece construction as hats are usually woven. This means that this hat is likely to unravel at the seams at the top. Also, you can only fold up this beanie as shown if you have a SMALL HEAD.<br /><br />The one thing I can say is that it's a really pretty, true red. If that matters a lot to you, and you have a small head, and you don't care if acrylic fibers mess up your hair, it's worth the five bucks. ; )"
1.0,These boots are really stunning but are almost two sizes too small! Had to return them.
1.0,Shipping was good. The first time I ordered this I thought I pushed the wrong button and got a large instead of a 3X so I ordered it again making sure I hit the 3X when it came this time it was still just a large there must be a problem ordering anything else but a large buyer beware
1.0,"Too thin and too stretchy, band does not hold up socks on legs"
1.0,I loved this dress but what is with this sizing?!  I'm not a twig (5'8&#34; and about 200 lbs - normally size 14) - I read the &#34;size chart&#34; so I knew that the 2xl would be a close fit but geez!  3xl?!
1.0,"Waste of money. Very heavy, and small. I should have followed the other reviews that they were too small."
1.0,This polish did not cover anything on the white leather saddle shoes. The polish is white but it is not “polish” from years ago.
1.0,Wrong color and late getting them. Not very happy with this order.
1.0,Way too small. I ordered a medium which is my normal size and I couldn't even get it past my shoulders. I have had some Grace Karin items that ran small but this one seems like it was a child size medium. The style is certainly not appropriate for a child.
1.0,"Nice material, but measurement is misleading customers who are small and petite😐😐😐"
1.0,Shapes weird  too long
1.0,Cheap and Trashy
1.0,Product came broken and lights never lot up. Very poor quality
1.0,If it fir I might have liked it. But it was toooo small.  Maybe 2 or more sizes too small!!
1.0,I had these sunglasses for only 5 months and they were gently used.  The ear piece snapped lose from the eye lens at the hinge.  I contacted zeroUV supplier & they referred me back to Amazon. Amazon refunded the money without hesitation; but I would NOT recommend these sunglasses as they will break fairly faster than 5 months if you are not careful.
1.0,"Wow.  What a POS.  It was supposed to be cotton but it's a weird fabric.  It's almost like a brushed flannel, but not the soft cozy kind (made of cotton...).  Sort of like those super cheap stuffed toys you'd see at a fair or 99 cent store.  Awful, it felt synthetic and flammable.<br /><br />The sweater arrived crumpled in a ball, they made no attempt to fold it.  I get that it's an odd shape, but it can be folded if you take pride in what you sell which makes me think that even the person who &#34;wrapped&#34; it knew it was garbage.<br /><br />The color is not a dark red, as the description indicates.  It's bright and very primary, so you'd look like you were wearing a stretched out clown nose or melted crayon instead of a flattering color.  Just awful.<br /><br />Also, it had strings from other fabrics attached to it (so it would be a magnet for picking up lint if one was to wear it).  Garbage, just garbage.<br /><br />And, yes, it's made in China."
1.0,"Fell apart after worn once, unraveling"
1.0,Horrible shirt! The sleeves are too short and the band at the hips is overly tight. It's difficult to get the draping of the neckline just right. Not flattering at all.
1.0,Too small to br the size requested. Runs very small.
1.0,"How is it possible that there is no shirt??!? Cheaply made. I bought bigger based on reviews, but shouldn't have."
1.0,Please BEWARE! The white blazer is not white. It’s cream!!! I got this blazer in hopes of wearing it with a very specific Easter outfit. I needed a white blazer and this is NOT it! Returning.
1.0,"Feathers are smeared and design has several places it is missing, including over seams.  Very poorly done"
1.0,Did not work at all.
1.0,Bad quality !  Too uncomfortable.  I do not recommend!  The spamps were on the opposite side.  Very bad size and fabric.
1.0,Super itchy fabric. Like fiberglass...
1.0,band glued to benzel
1.0,made for short and huge person...
1.0,"These carabiners are not appropriate for anything weighing more than a few pounds. Consider them to be decorative more than anything else.<br /><br />Had the weight distributed between two of them for my 6 year old's swing with each locked and sitting static attached to the hinge, and the metal deformed until it snapped open after a few days. Luckily my kid was hardly moving when they did snap and didn't get hurt.<br /><br />We're talking about a load of maybe 60 pounds and use of approximately a week here. If the seller was honest and upfront about the pathetic capacity of these carabiners it wouldn't be as major of a problem, but the way they sell them as heavy duty is manipulative and deceitful."
1.0,Worst shirt ever. feels like plastic and its ugly. the small is too small in the arms and too big everywhere else. not at all flattering
1.0,Absolutely love the style and the color of these glasses but unfortunately I can't wear them because they are way too big for my head
1.0,"I looked at the reviews before purchasing this item. They all said order biger. So I did. I wear a 1XL.  I ordered a 3XL...  It might be a medium, looks closer to a small."
1.0,"I never review products but I had such a horrible experience with this shoe that I had to do it.  I went to Yosemite on a week long field trip with a group of 8th graders I teach, upon some of the first few steps I took in the snow the boots ripped open at the toe, my feet were soaking wet all week.  The shoes also have little to no padding or support for hiking.  If you’re doing some light LIGHT walking around I guess these could possibly be ok, but I would never EVER buy these as a pair of boots to rely on."
1.0,Tiny skimpy things!
1.0,I usually don't have a problem bras fitting cause I'm so small. I have never bought size 36 or a C I should of in this case. Size runs very small
1.0,"These are nice earrings, but after trying to wear them I found that the part that goes in the ear hole is to wide for me.  I could only wear a few minutes before they hurt my ears.  If they had used a round it would have been much better."
1.0,"Tassel fell off after 4th wearing , another tassel about to fall off. Very disappointed in the quality."
1.0,Battery died within a week and then after having it replaced the front glass fell off when my granddaughter touched it.
1.0,The picture of this shirt gives the illusion of a tee that covers the hips. I'm 5'1&#34; tall and weigh approximately 128 pounds. I never had wide hips. It doesn't reach below my navel.
1.0,"I love the Black open toe and purchased the same size in pink for a little color, they were so tight and very uncomfortable.  The Black open toe is great, the pink not so much won’t be buying any more of the pink, can’t wear, bummer"
1.0,I should have read the reviews more carefully prior to purchase . I can only echo what many others have said . I did buy the black band as a replacement . It does not fit . After spending an hour trying to replace the band I finally put the old gray one back on which slid back on with no problem !  Garbage .- I guess  you get what you pay for.
1.0,Lost all 4 ends within 20 minutes. Too small to get on.
1.0,Don’t waste your money. The top felt like a swimsuit material. It looked nothing like the picture and the small looked like it could fit a medium. It looked awful
1.0,The only part of this dress that looks like the picture is the coral top. I love the teal flowers and the light pink and the design and color of the leaves. This picture is what I got instead. I am super disappointed and sending it back.
1.0,"Is not what you see in the pic. There is another piece of material added to this mask, so it is not just lace. Easy fix though with a seam ripper."
1.0,Only wore for 2 days before it started tarnishing and turning brassy
1.0,"After wearing only a few times, the rose gold<br />playing has completely come off. I did t realize this until I went to put it on yesterday.<br />Tried to initiate a return only to find out the return window closed two days ago so now Im stuck with a necklace that is ruined;  I’ve had it less than a month and worn 3x. Very unhappy!"
1.0,Doesn't come with any pins and is plastic
1.0,my glasses  have slipped out of these multiply times with these poorly designed cheap imitation of the original Croakies.<br />Would not  buy again or recommend — don't waste your money.
1.0,It was like industrial material.  And it was like a medium in Size instead of xl.  So substandard for amazon to sell it!  Not buying clothes from Amazon anymore!!
1.0,Wore this it last for 1 month all the junk in the coat start flying out all over my jeans pants shirts I threw it in the garbage after one month...
1.0,Absolutely not true to size. Material cheap looking! Will not buy from this seller again!!
1.0,"They are supposed to stay up on your tummy but they dontb, they roll completely down and its super uncomfortable !"
1.0,The zipper never worked well.  Now it doesn’t work at all while it’s freezing outside.
1.0,Very very disappointed. I was super excited for these so I can play with the kids and take pictures of them in the cold weather. My hands were frozen within minutes of going outside with them on. Don't buy!
1.0,It didn't work at all the mouth was closed when I spoke. Not worth the money.
1.0,Nothing like the pictures. Made very cheaply for the price. Took  over a month to arrive. It is cheap china piece of junk. I would send it back if it didnt take so long to get something else in. Not worth the money.
1.0,The back criss cross came apart. My daughter wore it once and the back criss cross detail came apart. She is only two so the dance leotard was on the bigger side so there is no reason why the back should come apart.
1.0,I have a broken ankle and bought these to keep my feet a little warmer. After 12 days the strap is starting to fray on a few pairs already and I'm not even exercising in them..... Only hobbling around with a knee scooter. Not happy and definitely will choose something else when I order more.
1.0,"The wider you stretch the ring, which is hard to do, the more it pokes into my hand between my fingers.🤌..It was just a little tight but since it's so uncomfortable I'm returning it and because I really don't like that little hole on the rings tip which I don't understand it's purpose but whatever.."
1.0,"These socks are not what I thought they were.  All were different size , had a bad smell, gave no support at All"
1.0,Not as expected at all !!! Poor quality and bad shape !!!
1.0,"The dress is well made and what I expected.  Problem is, it arrived too late for my daughter to try on for a wedding, so I needed to return.<br />I was offered either $20 for an immediate refund, or an address in Portland to return that has been flagged by both Paypal and Ebay as an ""empty box"" scam.<br />Amazon would only offer to connect me with the seller.  Help!"
1.0,The shape of the neck and how it rests on your neck is at a point... not rounded. Hangs funny off of me and I could care less to wear it.
1.0,Don't waste your money. Looks nothing like the pic. It's rather see though. Fits like a car suit for holloween. I will be returning it
1.0,Material uncomfortable and it runs SMALL.
1.0,"These replaced a previous purchase that had such LOW heel and sides that they would not stay on. I returned them. These were a nice fit and stayed on my feet well....Six months later .  Tops are holding up well, but the bottoms are literally falling apart. The bottoms are very short lived."
1.0,Fell apart when my wife put it on!
1.0,Bad quality shoe. Too large of the size. Seller does not respond to any of the messages. Requested return 1 week ago and still did not hear from the seller.
1.0,"Too small, not what was expected"
1.0,"The camel tow is REAL ladies and it’s super uncomfortable. I guess if you have no female anatomy down south at all, liken to a non anotomically correct Barbie, then these will work for you."
1.0,The quality on these is really cheap.  They're not as thick as other versions and they have a tendency to break quite easily.
1.0,"Returned due to poor quality, garment didn’t even have a tag identifying the brand, the size, the materials used or wash information."
1.0,"Bought from woot ,Followed instructions to get them wet to form on your hand,let them dry and the second time I used them for Light yard work the seams on the fingers on both gloves started coming apart,Bad cheap threads I suppose .now a second finger is busting open.The Leather seems fine ,to bad it wont stay together.<br />Update: not water resistant.,leather is getting very stiff."
1.0,Too damn small
1.0,Super cheap material. Not worth the buck. Super thin and everything shows. Is not comfortable at all. Regret buying it.
1.0,El producto se ve bonito pero son in omoda
1.0,Had to return an empty case and get a refund.
1.0,"Hi...I'm just so sad about all this..I ordered five of these necklaces for myself and my bridesmaids. I don't have much money, and planning a wedding has been so difficult and stressful, but I really wanted to get something special for my girls, which I thought would be these necklaces. Long story short: I wore the necklace once, and it is tarnished already. I did not shower in it and was very careful with the water. But after one day of wearing it, it is brown and tatty. I'm so embarrassed.. I will have to face my bridesmaids and let them know I'll get them better ones. Money wasted, time wasted, heart wasted. Such bad quality. I will be asking for a refund."
1.0,They are gorgeous... but WAY TOO SMALL.
1.0,Broke after about 2 months
1.0,"I ordered two of these because I thought the price might reflect the quality. It did. The ear cuff is poorly designed, and it's heavy. So, not only will it not stay on your ear well, it will make your ear hurt as well."
1.0,"The picture that shows of this cute top is Not what I recieved!<br /><br />Who ever sewed this got half the shirt right in front, and the other half was sewed on the other side on the back!<br />Nothing matched on each side on the front or back!<br />It looks like child labor of a 8 yr old!<br /><br />The Zipper in front would have been nice if it was sewed on straight, but it wasn’t.<br />The pink and red stripe is sewed on a little bit on the very bottom.<br /><br />Inside the sleeves are tabs to button to keep the sleeves up. On one side it was sewed on the right way, but on<br />the other side it is sewed in backwards.<br /><br />Even the stitching at the bottom is not straight.p<br />I can understand a little mistake, but the whole shirt is one big mistake.<br /><br />The top of the shirt fits, then its tappered down!<br />I wear a size 10, this is a extra large, and gets tight as it is sewed down the sides.<br /><br />Do not waste your money on this shirt.<br /><br />Where is Quality Contol!<br /><br />I think this is the first time I gave a One star, and if I could it would be minus any stars.<br /><br />I hope other people that recieved this shirt got one that is sewed together Properly."
1.0,Terrible sizing. Ordered XS and its too big . This has to be the only XS that never fit me.
1.0,"The necklace was brown in 2 days, I had to throw it away. SMH"
1.0,I was very disappointed because this top runs extremely small. I ordered a size Large but it was more like a size extra small. Super cute though; which made it even worse that it didn’t come close to being the right size.
1.0,Item was listed as organic cotton - it is NOT. It is a plain Gildan cotton t-shirt. Fine shirt but not what I ordered. I bought eight of these and had to return them all separately.
1.0,Horrible fit so I returned it once and the replacement was horrible fit and had a big yellow stain on it<br />--buyer beware!!
1.0,Dress fits like a sleep gown and the material is not flattering at all
1.0,Not at all what is advertised very cheap and not what is in the picture. DONT but this product
1.0,I really loved these earrings.  But one broke the 3rd time I wore them. I just tapped the virgo symbol and it broke right off
1.0,"Bad quality, cheap material, looks terrible. Got similar dress from another vendor and it was so much nicer. This one will never leave the house."
1.0,I literally couldn't even get this on and I am a small/ medium woman this fit my 9 yr old daughter hoping that my Halloween isn't costume free this year.
1.0,Way to small. Most of the stuff I bought I had to give them away because didnt fit ugh.
1.0,NÚNCA lo recibí
1.0,Save your money. The storage box is cool...that's about all.
1.0,Did not fit true to size and had to be returned. Runs very small.
1.0,"I returned these boots immediately because they felt very cheap, had very little padding on the interior. I did not wear them except a quick try on. I would not recommend for anyone looking to do any serious activities, they felt like they would fall apart in a short amount of time."
1.0,I do not like the fit. I returned. Material and colour is okay.
1.0,"The directions given in picture 3, do not work, the temp isn't high enough for sublimation ink to transfer. The purpose of the  purchase was to sublimate."
1.0,Didn't come with a belt.
1.0,"Horrible! got the large, but felt like a sausage trying it on, bought it for the built in bra, which is basically 2 tiny pads that you can’t remove and offer no support, couldn’t wear it"
1.0,to small for an xl
1.0,Poor quality fake Kaye spade wanna b
1.0,Fake leather
1.0,These are so see through highly disappointed
1.0,The pants were marked as medium but fit as a petite small.
1.0,"Not a fan. looks like it was meant for a woman anyway, although the description is mens.  Arms aren't long enough either."
1.0,"It’s silky and feels good but that’s it. A real shame. If you’re looking for a snug and comfy pajama set, I personally would never recommend these. It’s more for a cute look and there’s nothing wrong with that, but I was hoping it would look cute and be comfy. But didn’t work out for these reasons: I ordered a size much larger to be safe and the waist was so small. The rest of the pants fit the size as expected EXCEPT the waist - basically a size or 2 smaller which is unfortunate. My waist is 25-26 but it was about 23-25.. which makes it so much worse since the top is a crop top. My bust is 34 and the crop top ends well above my navel. I wanted something cute to show off to my husband but it was the absolute opposite. I’m going to use the fabric and make a pillow case for the tiny pillows my dog has. The fabrics are great but again the sizing didn’t work out."
1.0,Earring is defective.  One earring does clip closed.  Very disappointed cause I couldn’t give it as a gift.
1.0,"This top is very pretty, I ordered 5X.  Review said it was equal to a 2x in this country, I can wear a 1x or 2x depending how it is made, but<br />when I got this top it fit like it was maybe an XL size.  It was way to tight.  Really disappointed.  I will keep it for awhile to maybe help<br />motivate me to lose weight."
1.0,Turned black just after about 3 wks
1.0,One of the bands started peeling all of the Mickey off the second day I wore it. I put it in the garbage. Total waste of money!!!!!!<br />If zero stars was a rating this would get it. 👎🏼
1.0,See through fabric. Cheap fabric.
1.0,"This is probably my worst amazon purchase to date! Was really excited to receive this dress, however upon opening the packaging I was immediately upset by the quality of the item. It's far poorer quality than the description let on. Further to that, the dress had so much loose threads and pieces all over that it would almost IMPOSSIBLE to have it organized for when I want to use it. Very upset by the whole thing and because I had to use it abroad, it makes it difficult to return, although I believe I deserve a refund! Save yourself the heart break ladies, pass on this item!"
1.0,It's a nice necklace for the price  but the closure was placed to fit a child's neck . I should've returned it..
1.0,"Kinda cute, but also very very badly made."
1.0,"Really bad, the string had no claspe in the middle so I couldn't even try it on, I tried putting in one side to see how sticky it was but it was bad, was not worth what I paid for."
1.0,"Horrible - flimsy plastic fabric, nothing like the picture"
1.0,"Bought this for my daughter, she plays basketball and wears a head band all the time. She had issues with headbands sliding off and after reading reviews on this one's I had high hopes..  Unfortunately,  the material is very slippery,  and they won't stay put.. They went back to headband drawers..  Will keep searching.."
1.0,My 5c won't fit right.
1.0,"I got a medium which is my normal dress size and it fits way too lose on top. Not great quality, but, like I said; you get what you pay for."
1.0,Wasn't the same pants I ordered from the first time. Very dissatisfied.
1.0,"Really disappointed - Not Orange, and the head of the Lobster is Tilted Sideways.  I was literally going to throw them out but I decided to put them in a yard sale - might get a couple bucks for them."
1.0,"Looks nice, but so weak, it broke almost right away. Flimsiest umbrella I've ever seen."
1.0,false advertising; these are not bell bottoms but rather straight-leg pants<br />yuk
1.0,Sleeves are not long enough & everything else is too big! Fits like a medium but extra small arm length! Cheap!
1.0,"Terrible cheapest piece of crap I have ever bought.  You get what you pay for.  You are better off going to gucci..  I got an XL because it said to buy two sizes too big, as it ran small...  it was sized for a child- no kidding...it is also different from picture, it is a shirt, super cheap thin material..  sending right on back."
1.0,Don't plan on wearing this unless you are size medium and under.
1.0,Too short<br />Caused problem with getting glasses on and off<br />Made one pair of sunglasses break<br />Stopped using
1.0,Bought necklace for myself. Was very disappointed because the virgo writing on the necklace heart u can't see it. The little heart keeps coming through. Looks like a regular necklace. Would not recommend it.
1.0,I ordered size M because it is what I always buy the brand Johnny Was. Blouse I received seems a 2X. I can do two with her. I'll have to take her to cut her at least 10 centimeters on each side.
1.0,"I have a black pair of this same shoe...a ""real"" vionic.  What I received was not the same as the shoe I owned.  The straps were thin and felt like vinyl therefore fit was different.  returned...doubt will buy through this vendor again.  May try Zappos...same price...free shipping."
1.0,"First, the smell was pretty strong when I opened the package. The gloves were all stuck together and one of the designs got ripped off and stuck to another glove, completely ruining both gloves."
1.0,Broke after 2 days.
1.0,Had to return them.  I think they would have fit but there is no zipper and the waist was too small to get them on.
1.0,Spray function broke within 6 months
1.0,They don't look anything like the picture. Material is very very thin.
1.0,One leg is shorter than the other one
1.0,Worst thing I've ever purchased from Amazon.  Material kept catching on the wheels so suitcase wouldn't roll and put holes in the material.  I threw both covers I bought away when I got to Rome.  Only gave a one star because It was colorful.  Don't waste your money!!!!!
1.0,"It's red, white, and blues. Picture shows blacks so I returned it."
1.0,"very thin  material, blisters on the way"
1.0,"Disgusting! My “new” dress arrived balled up in a bag, inside out with deodorant all over it! That’s just repulsive!"
1.0,"Dont waste money, I was excited and put these on my car, the minute I got on the road to town the antler broke off and blew away. Sad."
1.0,"I did not know that these lace mask would be so flimsy, back tie not long enough , some eye cut out to small, especially if you wearing lashing....."
1.0,Left front pocket was not sewn properly. Did not notice until the first time I wore them and I tried to put my wallet and couldn't do so. When I checked the pocket later it was obvious the pocket was defective.
1.0,As SOON as I put it on the first sneaker of my husbands it ripped. Immediately. Junk.
1.0,Put my phone wallet in my pocket and after my walk I found that the dye from the pants had totally ruined and discolored my phone wallet. I would not machine wash these pants as the blue dye will ruin your other clothes.  Tried Clorox with peroxide to clean my wallet and that did not work.
1.0,Too small for an adult ear by far. Horrible product unless you're possibly buying it for a child.
1.0,Totally garbage. Utter waste of money.
1.0,"I wanted this to work for me like all the other small-busted ladies who commented, but it just didn't. I'm probably smaller than a 32AA, and this was still gaping, like most bras on me."
1.0,Bought these for my son. All of the sizes were different and none of them fit even though I ordered his correct size.
1.0,too flimsy and the paint peeled off in a couple of days.
1.0,This is very pretty but it’s silver. The picture represents it as being gold but it’s not. For that reason I had to return. And the misrepresentation is why I only gave it 1 star.
1.0,Only good for women with small chest
1.0,I thought these were going to be washable fabric but they are 2 layers of very thin ( 1mm) spongy material that has the earholes punched out and sew down the nasal ridge. The nasal ridge is not held down with any metal bridgepiece ( inside or out) so glasses will still fog up. It won't stop any viruses as you can sorta see through these...they wouldn't even be good for allergy sufferers. But you can breath through them easily and that the only plus. I don't expect much washablility or longevity.
1.0,it has broken only wear one week！bad quality!
1.0,This watch is huge for a women’s watch. Very difficult to adjust to fit on wrist- requires special tools
1.0,This item was just like a man's tee shirt...if that was the look I wanted I could buy a pack of Hanes or Fruit of the Looms tee shirt for $9 instead of $18 for one tee
1.0,"Hate it! I am very petite. I can wear a 30 or 32 but based on the reviews of it running small I ordered a 34 A/B. As you can see by the photos, the outside of the package says 34 but the garment itself says 36. It’s enormous on!! Even on the smallest notches it’s HUGE around!!! What a total waste of money!!!"
1.0,I cannot open the clasp.
1.0,"Very small , difficult to put it on, bend easily, don't stay well on the ear"
1.0,"Be nice if the listing mentioned ""BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED"".<br /><br />You will NEED to buy batteries!"
1.0,"Waist is very small, while the skirt is too large. Poor fit"
1.0,"I wanted so bad to like this, but I had a few issues. First the two chains were not the correct length so that the triangles lined up. Instead they were crooked and constantly needed adjusting. Second the metal was scuffed in a few obvious places, making it look really cheap. Lastly the size was not ideal, I was maybe hoping for something more dainty. It was a gamble but one I think I will be sending back unfortunately."
1.0,I like the styl but they are to small for my man face. So im returning them
1.0,IS VERY CHEAP QUALITY
1.0,"Dress was made poorly, it was like the inside was one side and the out side a completely different size.. and looked nothing like the picture."
1.0,"Came broken in 3 pieces. Plastic is cheap and very brittle. I believe that if it would have already been broken,  it would have shattered the 1st time it was dropped which is alarming for a product made to hold and protect an expensive drone."
1.0,This dress is awful. It is a square tent with sleeves. I love the material but would never wear it outside my house. So NOT worth what I paid for it. Sending it back
1.0,"Runs small as well as very very hard to take off once sweaty. It pretty much sticks to you, definitely need another individual with you. Would of been way better if it had a zipper on it."
1.0,This is the second set I’ve owned and I should’ve known better. Both pairs have broken immediately due to small falls. Both times they immediately snapped and are unusable. I will be seeking a higher quality product for longevity
1.0,Smells bad...really small
1.0,Tiny and way too short. Not at all what I expected. I’m 5’7” and the shirts barely came to my hips. Immediately returned.
1.0,"the fabric is cheap, the color is awful and the fit is .... bizaar, actually.  I'd like to return it but the closest UPS store is 30 miles away."
1.0,"Very see-through and too small on the top. I will be sending it back, but it may be a good fit for someone else."
1.0,Socks so tight and non-stretch that I couldn't get them on.  Glad I only bought one pair.  No more for me.
1.0,Too small. Very cheap quality. Came disfigured. 3rd world garbage.
1.0,Cheap shiny super thin material. Don’t waste your time even ordering because you’ll end up returning.
1.0,barely took it out of the package. a satin piece of material. would look like a nightgown on. returned.
1.0,"I was thrilled when I found this line of products.  I watched all the review videos that were posted Pryor to making my choice to buy this item.  Union receiving it I followed the directions and put a pair of yellow Vans into the water and cleaner mixture..did it clean then yes, did it take the color out of the shoe yes.  They went from golden to faded in less then 30 minutes.  Luckily they are just for around home shoes.  It reminds me of the same stuff you buy to lighten your hair.  Same concept.  So yes it will clean them. But it will also eat the color out."
1.0,I love the design of the wallet but I have had mine less then a year and it doesn’t hold shape the money clip sticks out very far. See photo<br /><br />The money clip isn’t loose but the leather has shrunk down and leaves the clip exposed to catch on everything
1.0,It seems more like a woman’s shirt. It buttons on the left and the fabric is thin and tight for a men’s large.
1.0,I've never been this disappointed in a purchase I've made online.  Cheap material; Very thin - not sweatshirt material at all.  color not even close -it's  such an ugly RED.  Ordered an XL but is maybe  Medium.  Don't be fooled by the picture or the product description.  Look for a proven quality item.  There are many featured through Amazon.
1.0,Really disappointed in this one !  Not sure if it’s the color or the style but unlike others of this brand / just not happy with this purchase.  It’s well made for the price .  Perhaps in a dark color it would look good !
1.0,"Similar to another review, the mechanism that holds the Mi Fit device in the strap broke in less than a week.  I'm surprised that it was designed in a way that the springs are exposed.  It led to one of them falling out in just a few days of light use.  Disappointing."
1.0,"Didn’t like it, my shoulders slope down and straps felt they were falling off"
1.0,POS
1.0,"The nightgown is sleazy fabric, runs very small and smelled ""funny."" Very poor purchase choice, do not make it! Wonder if the all the products from this vendor are as unsatisfactory as this item."
1.0,Made very cheaply
1.0,The tulle ripped at the waist and the emblem came unglued the day we got it. My daughter was so sad. DO NOT BUY as it is not worth it
1.0,"Unfortunately, it came bent and smelled bad, and didn't look like the picture. The material is cheap and not attractive."
1.0,Highly dissatisfied. My worst purchase on Amazon in years. One of the shirts is so poorly made it is unbearable. One shoulder strap is normal and the other is 4 times as long. This is an unbearable irregular item and never should have been sold. Of course I already unpacked it and put it on before realizing and then couldn't return it.
1.0,No es la taya nombrada
1.0,I've never seen material like this before. Don't know what it is
1.0,"Fabric is thin and sheer. Was expecting a more substantial fabric fit for monogramming, however, the fabric is so sheer it can't be done. It will tear, catch and break the needle. Very disappointed. Description should have mentioned these were of sheer fabric."
1.0,"Way too small, I barely can fit my wallet in it."
1.0,"I would give 0 stars if I could. First the print matches but the fabric is the slick shiny type (it would show your cellulite if it was a solid color luckily the print will hide it)  not like regular yoga pants, they are not loose at all and I'm 5'4&#34; and they barely cover my ankle and again it's not loose. it's like a standard boot cut flare yoga pant.., there is no real fold over either so don't expect that to happen. I got an XL going by previous reviews. I'm still in search of the perfect boho palazzo pants but these aren't it."
1.0,"This is my second coat, was hoping this one would do better. It did worse, just several weeks in all pockets torn out and jacket torn under both arms. Not worth it."
1.0,I wore this 2 times and it was already tarnishing . Super disappointed
1.0,I feel these run extremely small. My 14 year old son couldnt even fit in them
1.0,Too small and I had to pay $5 to drop it at ups.
1.0,Vest was probably miss labeled. XXL should fit chest to 48&#34;. I'm a 44&#34; and this was probably 4 -5 sizes too small. Vest measured 39&#34; . Competive cyclist wanted to charge me shipping to send back. Garneau sent a prepaid label but I haven't heard from them. So no vest and no refund.
1.0,"While the fit was comfortable, that was the ONLY positive about this dress.  The material is cheap and stretchy so it does not fit loose as the picture shows.  Since it was wrinkled when it arrived, I tried to iron it for the first wear and the red color bled all over the white stripes, FROM AN IRON that was set to a cooler setting! I can’t imagine the bleed when it’s washed! I’m definitely returning it, terrible, terrible quality!"
1.0,The quick release clasps release too quickly and easily at random times. I tried crimping the metal for a tighter fit but it’s almost impossible to get it just right. The mesh band is useless on a watch as hefty as the Fenix 5x. Way too thin and flimsy.
1.0,"literally absolutely tiny little metal balls, they didn't even have gems in them. Never buying again. Still keeping assuming they're quality but DO NOT BUY not worth your money"
1.0,The pendant is too small and the necklace is too thin
1.0,Couldn't wear damaged hat.
1.0,"Horrible Quality, wanted to return them... they told me to keep them, gave them to a friends child and the zipper broke the second day wearing them..."
1.0,Feel and for great . Only problem for me is that I'm 5'9 and were a bit short.
1.0,Strap broke the first time I used it. Didn't even make it into the pool.
1.0,"The fabric is indeed stretchy. The ruffle at the bottom is horrible though. It’s supposed to be ruffled and asymmetrical, there are no pleats in the ruffle so it looks like just an odd piece of fabric sewn on the bottom. The bodice is sewn so that the cup seams sit higher than where your breasts should be, making it look very awkward. It fits and feels like a Halloween costume. Do not buy."
1.0,"Poor quality, zipper ripped on second use."
1.0,"These undies were outrageously long - they came up under my bra - but not as wide around the middle as another brand would have been.  Plus, the leg holes stretched out so far, it was like wearing 'tap pants'.  Just crazy!<br />So, if you want to channel the 1940's, have thighs the size of a rhinoceros, but are otherwise as long-waisted as Madame Maxime of Beauxbatons (11' giantess from Harry Potter), these undies are for YOU!"
1.0,Literally broke apart on the day of arrival.
1.0,Chain broke not even 10 min after having it out the box so I don't recommend buying take your money else where
1.0,it is a weird fit. cheaply made
1.0,Huge! Lousy material.  Poorly made
1.0,"Very poor quality.  Gave it away, did not like the way it fit or anything about it."
1.0,Not happy I ordered my size according to the size chart (12) and doesn't fit.
1.0,Its pretty enough but the center slide doesn't stay in place.
1.0,NOT non-skid at all. Really bummed that I missed the window on returning these. A waste of money.
1.0,I loved these earrings when I ordered them. The back of the earring broke off my first time putting them in.
1.0,Clasp broke while trying to use for the first time.  Not returnable and no customer service.  Do not buy.
1.0,"Extremely cheap, thin fabric! I couldn't even figure out how to put it on! Mailed back!"
1.0,Bought 3x for the length. This is barely 26 inches supposed to be 31. Very cheap material. Do not bother with buying this! At least there are free returns on it.
1.0,La tela es muy transparente para el precio
1.0,Started to fall apart within an hour of wearing it. Had to change shirts before it completely gave way. The stitching where the fabrics meet are poorly done.
1.0,"I don't like how it looks with my Garmin Fenix 3 HR, color does not Match.<br />material feels like cheap."
1.0,"This set provides zero support.  It doesn't have any support.  The bra doesn't hold up anything.  The pants don't provide any support either.  It is cute in the photo but not that cute on me, because it is the wrong material for a legging and sports bra set."
1.0,It was too big- didn’t resemble the Amazon photo at all. Didn’t fit as shown in photo. Returned product.
1.0,it looks okey not as good as pic
1.0,"I don't know what age child these would fit.  Should say toddler maybe or even baby.  I opened up the envelope, yes so small they fit in an envelope and was very disappointed.  I had to go to a costume shop to buy another pair."
1.0,The description is completely inaccurate. Within 30 minutes green finger. So infuriating
1.0,"The diamonds fell off easily, cheap quality."
1.0,I received a child's size small twice.  Not a woman's medium.
1.0,[[VIDEOID:3b475ce5dc4c3d4b560c9cba59bdd771]] I did not get the phrase on the bracelet I expected was supposed to say not sisters by blood but heart not the generic friends forever heartbroken
1.0,"Swimsuit material, nothing like it looks online"
1.0,"Hi, The actual item I received is not as large as it is shown in the pictures. It is about half the size shown. It will only fit a small child not a  grown adult, comfortably. I was really disappointed by this purchase. Misleading pictures for product. I did check the measurements....they fit if material is stretched thin.... not an accurate portrayal of this product. I would not purchase this again. I really wanted to like and use this scarf but can not."
1.0,Will not stay on if you love at all!!
1.0,"I usually get this type of shirts size x-large because I like them a little bit lose, but I purchased this one size XXL and it fits like a small/medium. (I am a size 10 in dresses, just to give you and idea how small it runs)."
1.0,0 stars. Gave me a completely different dress in the mail. Very frustrated. Returning.
1.0,Fell apart in the first washing.
1.0,"VERY disapointed! The product description said they were light -up, and they are NOT! Now I have a little boy in tears because what he opened as a surprise gifts not what I told him he would get. Oh, and they are also a half size too small. If it wasn't because he needs rain boots this weekend, I would return them."
1.0,"I'm usually a L in most name brand clothing (5'4&#34;, 36D/8-10 pant), but saw the reviews that this ran small, so I ordered an XL. IT WAS TINY. Not only was it skin tight, it was super short and come close to fitting like the model. The XL was much more like a S. Luckily it had free return, so I sent it back."
1.0,Cheaply made product to thin
1.0,Received a broken bracelet and the bag where it came from was ripped.
1.0,I'm frustrated with this item because it does not like from the advertised photos. Three thumbs down!!
1.0,The fabric is thick and not what was expected.
1.0,Didn't fit very disappointed
1.0,This blouse looks/fits nothing like the picture. For example the sleeves are completely different!
1.0,Too small and very see thru
1.0,Came broken. But forgot to return.
1.0,The embroidered symbol looks different than the picture. The hat is a little large with a wide flat rim.
1.0,"As I now see others have noted, the “red wine” dress is bright, primary red. I highly suggest changing the item description to accurately reflect the color. Even “monitor variations” could not distort the color as much as it is."
1.0,Dress is much too small and we’ve been unable to contact vendor using the number given by them. Sad situation!
1.0,Not true to size they run small
1.0,thought they came with the kids very disappointed when they didn't come with the little boys
1.0,Pretty and very large hoops. Cheaply made...was missing a stone
1.0,is not size large.  having major trouble getting refund. Had to place a complaint.
1.0,Stone fell out right away and the sizing is iffy. Seller accepted my return at no cost.
1.0,I ordered these mittens.  I ordered the item coded as A-green.  There was also an item coded as D-green.  The A item looked really nice.  The D item looked like the oven mitts other people mentioned in their reviews.  Both times I did not get the mittens I ordered.  I would give no stars if I could.  It seems that  whom ever handles the processing of these orders doesn’t pay attention to the codes
1.0,Dress was way too small. I should have ordered two sizes bigger.
1.0,"This product I bought was made for kids,didnt fit my kids and couldnt fit me either, it kept falling down"
1.0,False advertisement..Not even close to a 2x..im a size 14-15 fit me like a medium...so wrong😠..Had to return it..
1.0,One foot is perfect and the other has a metal piece to small it is hurting the toe.
1.0,This charger already broke. I will need to order another one. I barely used it!!!
1.0,"So incredibly cheap. Cheaply made and looks cheap. Absolutely see-through. The fabric has a bad static Cling and feels like plastic. The shape is... well, shapeless. I rarely write reviews but OMG 😱"
1.0,Replacement band.  HAd to use Drexel for it to fit.  Not worth the effort to return.
1.0,"it doesnt fit this is the 2nd one and its larger than the other one but is too small and i dont have a big fat wrist.i gave it to my wife rather than go thru the hassle of another return,how in the world can this product get good reviews?it is pretty but because you can not open it it willnot transfer over your hand to the wrist."
1.0,Im 5'2 and they didnt even reach my knees. The toes area was wider than any other part of the sock and were just cheaply made and not thick like i was hoping.
1.0,"Disappointed. This dress was so wrinkled when it arrived and every time I wash it and hang dry, because it was small, I have to iron it. I'm 5'8 and it hits my mid calf. The waist is fine but the bust area is super small as well."
1.0,received  them damaged and never got to wear them
1.0,"Much too small, not clear on listing that an XL was woman's size Small"
1.0,Was not fitted or flattering out all I am a small and the small swallows me very disappointed
1.0,"Both of the necklaces broke on the very first try on.  I would really like them replaced!!  The actual butterfly is very pretty, but the strapping comes out of the clasp."
1.0,"I haven't wore these band much at all, and it is already broke.  Very disappointed."
1.0,Really bummed it not work out! Super cute shirt but the extra large fits more like a large. Very snug!
1.0,"VERY SMALL, very thin, cheap!"
1.0,Shipping took quite a while. Material is cheap! Would be embarrassed to carry! Smelled foul and was sticky. Never again!!
1.0,"did not include extra spring pins as shown in the product images. the press-pin that holds the clip that attaches to the ""hole"" side of the watch band appearts to be a folded/pressed peice of metal and not a spring pin; came out one side after opening the latch one time. great idea for modifying a watch band, final product... not so much."
1.0,"The socks are white on the inside. When you put them on, the fabric stretches and shows the white interior. Instead of black socks, they end up looking grey. The art is also too low on the sock and ends up in the shoe."
1.0,I got a large because I wear an 8-10. I cant get them past my thighs. I have to return them. They feel weird too almost like a plastic instead of fabric.
1.0,Lies. Avoid at all cost.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!
1.0,"I was looking for a rayon product.  It said rayon,  it is not. You could buy this dress for $5 at Walmart"
1.0,Very cheap material and flimsy.  Very sheer and lightweight.  Piece of junk.
1.0,The material! It pulls up in the middle around the knees up to the thighs. Was looking for spring office wear but this doesn’t work. Plus it’s full of static even after two washes it clings and pulls up funny doesn’t hang nicely down. Disappointed
1.0,These slippers run at least one to one and a half sizes too small in comparison to a regular shoe size. The appearance and delivery were as expected.  Overall. I was disappointed with the purchase due to the variance in size.
1.0,"Watch broke within 2 weeks of using, band came apart after 2 days... even when it did work it didn't keep time."
1.0,"I loved how it looks, but it does not work properly. I have to adjust it every week since it falls behind. I wish I could return it."
1.0,to wide make me look like a wide load
1.0,The end broke off after one day wearing it!
1.0,"Battery not working, lasted only for 2 weeks then it stopped working."
1.0,"Do not order this item, you will not get what is pictured"
1.0,Read the fine print. This hat is not  cotton. It's something else that feels like those paper jackets that are handed out for free at the county fair.
1.0,Very small.  I can usually wear and XL and I can’t even get this over my thighs.
1.0,There's no way it would stay on your body unles my shoulders or boobs are too broad.
1.0,The glasses are terrible. Quality is poor and cannot use them.<br />Do not buy them! Kiosik glasses at Mall much better!! Nothing like they are described. 😕
1.0,"Wife writing review: The bottoms were horrendously not like the photo shows. The different colors make a weird lump over your crotch. The top's straps were also oddly long. Fit was ok for the top, but still not as good as the photo shows, there was some white showing from poor sewing. Would not recommend to anyone, not nearly as nice as photo. Needless to say, I returned."
1.0,"These are flimsey and are made of the same material as braided hairbands, but they are not elastic. I won't be ordering any more, but will get the large spiral gemstone holders instead which will be more sturdy."
1.0,"For the price of these I expected so much more. I want to draw your attention to the product description so that you don’t make the same costly mistake as me.<br />The waistband is made of saggy elastic which gapes and is very baggy at the back. It does not look good at all. I asked lots of my friends for their opinion and they all said the same thing, they look cheaply made and do not look right with the wrinkly elastic waistband.<br />Had the product description noted that the waistband was made of loose elastic and not a regular fitted waistband then I certainly would not have purchased them.<br />The overall look was ruined ."
1.0,"I received these last week, and tried them on over the weekend to wear for a hike. They fit as expected for my waist size.<br /><br />Halfway through the hike, I noticed that my pocket with my keys on them (car key + 2 house keys) started to sag. Once the hike was over both pockets has collapsed. This was a t terrible purchase, i should've gone to TJ Max or Wal-mart for better quality."
1.0,Terrible product. It fogged up completely after only 1 day of use. The worst mask I have ever owned!<br /><br />Also the nose part is very rough making it uncomfortable to wear.
1.0,"This shirt is ginormous and has a really weird cut to it. The back is much longer than the front. I am planning to alter it so that the hemline is the same all the way around, but I just haven't gotten around to it. Had I known the style and sizing ahead of time, I would never have bought it. My advice: take a pass."
1.0,Cheap material and poor fit.
1.0,Tiny......and i wear a34b...can't get it round me and does not hang down low enough<br />Prob great if u are  petite in general
1.0,Fabric looks like it's for nightgowns. Not the quality i expected for the price.
1.0,It was beautiful but they just need to get with the program with the big girls the jacket was to small but overall it’s comfortable and cute
1.0,Do not waste your money! They do not work!
1.0,Lost the whole bottom the first day. The top and bottom ball both screw off and I could not get them lined up. Really cute and glad it wasn't much money since I only got to wear it one day!
1.0,I love the look but so cheaply made it broke the first day wearing. I was very disappointed.
1.0,Wouldn't pair with any device we tried.
1.0,It was broke when I received it
1.0,"No, we didn't like it. The measurements advertised are not accurate."
1.0,Bracelet chain turned my skin green.
1.0,"I ordered this sweater based on another product I purchased from the brand ""Tecrew"", t Cruise product with excellent real as this product look half-assed, the stitching was different the sweater sinner and the product looks horrible when I put it on.  I returned this in knowing that not all things are the same regardless of the same model in the same photo being used in the advertisement of a product that look similar. I will be weary from this seller and I will never buy from them again and I advise if you want a good product not to buy it from them either and by the way the product physically stank stunk when I received it,!"
1.0,Not what I expected.. It's very thin and is some type of paper fabric.  Not worth the money - look like it will tear easy.
1.0,Polarize layer is coming off after only a few moths. Never seen such a thing.
1.0,"While the product appears to look good, it is made with very cheap material. I washed the capris in the wash, appropriate water temp and type of wash (gentle cycle- since that’s how I was most clothes), the side had a tear going from the waist area down to the button.. contacted seller and they said the item was out of the return/exchange timeframe, except I reported this immediately after getting item and washing. Well within the timeframe of their return/exchange policy."
1.0,"This ring is pretty, but it's not sterling silver. It left a blue ring around my toe after wearing this."
1.0,"We received this today, not impressed with the quality. It arrived with tassels on only one arm, all kinds of loose flips of yarn coming out all over it. Clearly a reject that was thrown in for shipment. Definitely want our money back!"
1.0,"This was supposed to be an ankle bracelet, yet it just fits on my average sized wrist! I understand it is inexpensive, but come on!"
1.0,Returned sweater. Poor quality; looked cheaply made
1.0,Though it would be smaller and not what I wanted .
1.0,"This dress is so poorly made that the skirt part straight fell off the bodice before/during and after trying it on. I was all confused wondering if I somehow put my head through the wrong hole and then realized the skirt wasn't fully attached to the dress and it was slowly getting worse as the one thread holding it together just unraveled.  So yeah I don't think it was properly sewn together in the first place.  Super disappointed because it would have looked really cute, but I'm hesitant to give it another chance because having the bottom half of my dress fall off in public would royally suck."
1.0,Very small.  I bought 4 of these and only one person could wear them.  Waste of money.
1.0,I didn't receive the tie that was supposed to come with it
1.0,This top would fit most 3rd- 5th graders but not an adult woman
1.0,I love the look and feel of this band.  :) :) :)<br />But after ~ 2 weeks of light use one side of the band simply broke off.  :( :( :(<br />There seems to be two screws that hold the band to the clip that connects to the watch.<br />Both screws fell of the side that completely broke off.  One screw was missing on the side that remained attached.<br />(See Pictures)  I am not sure if there were any other pieces / springs etc... that were lost when the one side broke free.<br />Bottom line - it was a great band for about 2 weeks.  I really liked it.<br />Hopefully Shangpule can fix the quality issue.  Now I need to go find a new band because I tossed the original one that came with the watch.
1.0,"These have a hole in the material.  Not a tear , but a hole with a plastic grommet covered with velcro.not a valve but just a hole!"
1.0,Missing belt - not flattering at all
1.0,"I'll have to return my dress because it didn't ship with the waist tie. It's a cute dress, but without the tie, it's too boxy and loose for my taste. I tried finding a place to email the sender but I didn't have any success with that. 1 star because it's annoying that I have to waste my time returning the dress. It would have been cute otherwise, but beware the tie might not ship with your dress."
1.0,"I bought this item based on reviews. I pulled out all the tarnished silver that I own and was ready to use this. I used it on the day it arrived. I can see the cloth getting dark but none of the tarnish in my collection of silver jewelries came off. I spent about 45 minutes trying to get it to work, making sure I followed the instructions and it's WORTHLESS!"
1.0,Adorable but dragon fly broke off and lost it. Very disappointed
1.0,"The color of the band I received is much more orange than the color in the picture. It also does not have the aged look like the one pictured. The band is very uncomfortable and stiff. I’m hoping it will become more flexible the more I wear it, but it’s so uncomfortable to wear that I don’t know if I’ll ever wear it enough to know."
1.0,The zipper fell apart entirely so now I can't use this ! I wore it 2 nights while nuring my newborn.<br />Now my return window is closed. I am extremely unhappy
1.0,2 of the 4 unraveling after less than 2 weeks of use.
1.0,"I literally receive this item like 8 minutes ago and Im so disappointed that I said I had to post a review. First thing I noticed was this isn't actually leather. It feels like a plastic chair material or what you put on a table. Then it had this weird smell. The lace is cheap and looks cheap. In my opinion, it doesn't even look like the picture. I will be returning this asap. Then they charge 27.99 this dress not even worth 5 dollars even if it was I would still return it. I brought a leather skirt from eBay that was better than this."
1.0,They sent me a dirty shirt. Ketchup or salsa all down the front with the rags already cut off. Very disappointing.
1.0,Wore this for a few days at work. And the strap broke. It wasnt even on tight or carrying anything more than my cell phone. Cheap piece of crap
1.0,Poor quality.  I attempted to adjust to my wrist and the pearl broke out. Never wore it :(
1.0,"The watch may be fine but the directions are awful and the setting procedure is far more complex than any other I've seen and this is just an analog watch with day and date. The instructions are contradictory, written by someone who has English as a second language and warn you of possible damage if you do it wrong. Nonsense.<br /><br />I communicated the foregoing to Burei and received two responses, both wrong and both with the same minimal English, of which a sample follows:<br /><br />To set the time: pull the crown out to position 2: Turn the crown towards you to advance the time and backwards to reverse it.  When you reverse the time only the day name will reverse at the previously noted breakpoints, not the date, unfortunately. One last quirk is that if you stop the watch at the advancement points of 12, 2, or 4:15 AM, you won’t be able to change the day of the week while in crown position 1; it’ll stay stuck on the current day of the week name. This is time restricted area. To set the chronograph hand: if the chronograph hand didn't 12 position , put the crown in position 2 , push the right button until the hand in the 12 position After you have set  the watch , be sure to press the crown back to its normal position. Note:  Every watch have time restricted area. In this time don't adjust the watch, Otherwise it will damage the movement.<br /><br />Despite my providing the exact information on the watch's box both responses were for a chronograph and inapplicable to the actual watch I had bought. I am unwilling to agonize over how to do something that should be straightforward as I've been setting watches for 60 years or so. Even if I had figured it out if I then forgot during the twice yearly resets for daylight saving then I would have broken it. So I returned it without ever putting it on. I mean come on, Burei! How can you make something so simple so complex? Others may have sailed through the directions - or didn't read them - but I'm cautious and try to do what the manufacturer recommends. Never again with this brand."
1.0,We received damaged bracelets-the seam on one end of the bracelet was not sewn shut so the metal band on the inside slipped out and sliced my daughter's finger very badly.  Finger was bleeding for hours.  Beware.
1.0,"I bought this combo to go in addition to the Halloween Costume I bought my son. The wand in the original photo had a blue light at the top so it looked real. Once I received the wand I quickly figured out it doesn’t take batteries, it does not light up, and the plastic is barely aligned together and looks as if it will fall apart. The wand is absolute junk. Don’t waste your money just spend a little more for something that will last more then 5 minutes."
1.0,The idea is cool. The product is not. I sent in a selfie with an inspirational message..... It looked like the guy controlling the laser was at his first day on the job. The spacing in the words is terrible. It just looks low quality. It’s a shame really. The picture is not that great and the overall keychain is really small. Very dissatisfied. I would not recommend.
1.0,The red made my daughter’s white tights pink and after washing the dress the white on the dress turned pink
1.0,Product tarnishes and it’s not silver I’m really upset that it says sterling silver but it’s not I would like to send all three back I know it’s past the time frame but it shouldn’t tarnish
1.0,Most uncomfortable bra I’ve ever purchased.
1.0,It’s a pretty product i just wish it came in bigger sizes.
1.0,"after waiting more than a month, bad quality, small hole in chest. you get what you pay for. crap"
1.0,These giant and I will be returning them .
1.0,This dress is not true to size at all. I am normally a large this fits like a small is extremely tight and short. There is not free returns so it’s not worth sending back.
1.0,These are only 21.95 on disney lands acutal website.
1.0,Very disappointed not at all what I was expecting. Got it for a small graduation gift and now it is too late to order something else. Do not buy this product so tiny can't read it!!
1.0,The material is gross feeling and it’s super small totally not impressed
1.0,"This jacket is nothing like the jacket on the show. Color is all wrong, fit and everything about it is just terrible. Do not order it"
1.0,Was excited at the combination of pearls and garnets but they look cheap.
1.0,I bought this for my 3-year old daughter and the elastic lining fell out of it after a few uses.
1.0,Post were bent when received.  They were put in a very small bag that did not have enough room for them. Not happy
1.0,In less then a day the silver was gone and my had was stained green I could have dealt with the green but the color going away was horrible
1.0,I ordered a small and it is way too big :/ I ended up crossing the top so it got a little better. Not flattering with my body shape and quality is more worth $5 . Not 20 something. Did come in cute packaging though
1.0,"This product is not a TRUE blazer/coat. It is a thin sweater. I was very disappointed. It does not look like the picture. The material is flimsy, and thin, like a polyester knit material. There is no lining, no heaviness, and the sewing on the side makes it look cheap, and inexpensive looking. Not good quality at all. Totally not my style, but the picture was!  It has been returned."
1.0,No es lo mismo a la imagen es basura no tiene la marca como se muestra en la imagen
1.0,"Item not as described, not as pictured. Will be returning."
1.0,I purchased these glasses twice and twice they were defective at the same place. Tired of sending them back. They have to be junk seconds.
1.0,"No son de Buena calidad, tampoco de plata.<br />Se pone negro y con nada se puede limpiar para que quede bien."
1.0,Not true sizing.  Xxl is more like a medium.  Even haf other people look at it.
1.0,"I'm very disappointed in this top. I like this brand and this must be an garment made with errors.<br />This 3/4 sleeve sweater  is nowhere near an extra-large. The sleeves are very snug, the shoulder area is large but it tapers to a narrow waist that doesn’t stretch enough and is very uncomfortable.  The “overlap” is just way too much and I had difficulty removing it.<br />In the photo the overlap is shown attaching up higher than in this one."
1.0,Dingy looks used. Not pleased at all.
1.0,Terrible item.
1.0,The top was too small with no stretch and pants slightly too big and fabric was too thin
1.0,Could not remove pins to adjust band.  Could not return.
1.0,If I could give it a zero rating I would
1.0,"These are not narrow, so if you are looking for a narrow show do not buy these. I could get my whole hand between the top of the shoe and my foot.  They were just what I was looking for but didn't fit my foot."
1.0,"I like the idea, but the hat was too small. The shield surrounded me well, but it was difficult to see out of because the material was creased from being folded in the packaging, I think. I returned with no issues"
1.0,The dress looks like it was printed on a 1999 home printer and screen printed onto the fabric. The leaves are blurry. So awful. Cheap quality.
1.0,Too large and too cheaply made
1.0,"Item was cute , but was very small not true to size at all"
1.0,Broke very fast and want money back
1.0,Bought for my 10 year old. The sizeable elastic inside the waste busted on the first wear while he was at school and had to manually hold them up all day.  He hasn't used them since. Trash.
1.0,It doesn’t look as nice as it’s picture and the quality of fabric and sewing is not good. It’s just not a flattering dress unless you’re very skinny. I am already thin but have curvy hips and it just looked horrible on.
1.0,***  TO FLIMSY & CHEAP FOR ME  ***
1.0,"Fabric looks nothing like what was shown in closeup images.  They are very short legged,  I am 5'9"" and of slender build, I ordered Xlarge and they are too short.  Color is not accurate.  Would not purchase again."
1.0,"It's very cute, but it fell apart after using it only three times, and I have super thin hair.  Don't waste your money."
1.0,The grey one is not cotton and it does not match the description at all
1.0,zoomies are not worth the money. I am really disappointed in them. advise not to buy. they do not help at all close up and not much good far away. the sunglasses part is a total joke
1.0,Braclet broke when I wore it the same day.
1.0,"I was so sad. When I got it, it had a weird smell so I washed it thinking it would work but no it was still smelled horrible. Don't buy"
1.0,These bras are crap. All three bras are now in the garbage after only a couple of wearings because the zipper broke on all 3.  Don’t waste your money.
1.0,Small on top and bottom and wierd in middle
1.0,the part that is supposed to be wood is plastic.<br />cheaply made and put together. i think they would<br /> have fallen apart very quickly. i won't have to<br />find out because i returned them immediately.
1.0,"Cheap, scratchy material with holes"
1.0,"Just like all the others I've tried, these are too small! I thought by the reviews I might have found the ones but no. I'm sure I'm not the only one with a stomach. There is never enough material and stretch to cover it. I guess I'll have to buy maternity!!"
1.0,With on an hour my finger started to turn green. Very disappointed !!
1.0,Fake so my finger started turning green
1.0,"Going back. You have to have 3 arms to attach this watch band.  Looks nice, but can’t even attach without help from another person."
1.0,This wrap is not firm at allllll.
1.0,Just as previous review said it is shorter than it looks comes way above knees
1.0,"While this dress was lovely to look at, the fit was TERRIBLE! The body of it was actually a bit baggy (and I have curves). But the chest and arm areas were tiny and had no stretch whatsoever! Probably have to have a size A cup and very slim arms to pull this off."
1.0,Looks cheap and on the small side.
1.0,"You can see right through these leggings and my wife didn't even have to do the ""squat test"" to see the pattern on her underwear."
1.0,Top zipper broke within the first week.  Returning it.
1.0,"I got it way before I was suppose to so that's good but at the same time I got it; it runs to small, I am 5'3 at 150ish lbs and I got an M and it still was to short.<br />So I ended up returning it so my advice don't buy this."
1.0,This is a terrible sweater and it smells very bad upon arrival
1.0,"The dress is cute. But couldn’t even wear it. Had a chemical smell, washed it with specialty dark detergent and faded after the one wash. Super disappointed."
1.0,This is such a disappointment!! Super thin and stiff and just plan ugly. I’m about to request a refund.
1.0,"I paid for a size 4x, and received a shirt no bigger than a 1x."
1.0,Material was not as pictured
1.0,Dress was delivered with a large hole along one of the seams. Material is thin.
1.0,Very thin material. Poor assembly sewing
1.0,It wasn’t long enough to fit & im very skinny. As soon as I sat down. It completely popped off. Disappointed
1.0,The color wasn’t what I expected. It was more like a BLUE blue not like on the picture like a beautiful indigo blue. The material is cringeworthy and clings to the body. Everything jiggles and you can see all your imperfections through the fabric.
1.0,"Unfortunately, I didn't get yo send back in a timely fashion."
1.0,"These mittens look like they were designed by someone who has never seen a human child's hand. The proportions are ridiculous - the thumb goes all the way up to the fingertips, the wrist opening is huge, as is the velcro strap so it can't be tightened, also the mitten ends right at the base of the thumb so literally none of the wrist is covered. When I go back to read other reviews, they are completely fake and written about other products. Super shady. I wish I had noticed that from the biginning."
1.0,I do not have the shirt yet
1.0,The shirt fits but what I order and what I received is not the same shirt. Very disappointed. I bought the pink one earlier in the year and loved it so I ordered the white and it's not the same shirt. :-(
1.0,"Whatever the stone it is, it gets lost in your hair and becomes invisible.  Will only work for very short, light color hair.<br />Arrived in a poor packaging with a handwritten note ""obsidian stone"" and no other prove or certificate. Looks cheap"
1.0,I would like to down grade my review to a 0 if possible. Now 2 pairs have split . The very thin fabric has just completely torn across the bottoms after only wearing twice. Definitely a total waste of money
1.0,"These were super cute but I didn’t realize how heavy they would be. I originally purchased for my 5 year old daughter who loves dinosaurs, but I couldn’t even wear them."
1.0,Does not fit as intended. Doesn't even stretch well. Will be returning.
1.0,Look very small and ugly. Not close to the picture
1.0,"I'm Irish, so I thought they were quite cute. But one was upside down when I put it on they were crooked they were poorly made almost like a child made them"
1.0,Very cheaply made. Straps constantly come off purse. Not what I had in mind. Of course the price should have warned me..
1.0,There not very good ware them once and the got tattered would not get them again
1.0,material is horrible
1.0,Sizes should be true
1.0,Horrible for and cheaply made so it was returned promptly.
1.0,The stone is huge and does not look flattering. And the ball to secure the ring is super hard to screw on almost making it impossible to wear.
1.0,"I have a complaint !!!  They repeated the same colors and in the photo where I had seen the scarves had other colors and it turns out that those colors that I had seen in the order I bought did not come either, it is not fair !!  I really didn't like it."
1.0,Not as pictured felt more like a cheap version of under armour and it was very loose
1.0,Too big for my toddler and cheaply made. Been sitting out of the package for over a week and still has a giant crease in it.
1.0,Very disappointed with this shirt it was for xl person
1.0,"These glasses were great at first. However, I just noticed lines on the lenses that go from one side to the other. They’re not scratches abs they weren’t there in the beginning but they completely cover both lenses!"
1.0,"These are completely flat across the front and look dumb on.  But that's not why I gave 1 star, that came because the lense pops out every time you try to clean them. The lense it's self is terribly cheap and thin. Wore these for ten minutes and pitched em in the trash."
1.0,These offer so little heat that even INSIDE my home I can't notice them turned on - they definitely do not provide additional warmth when out in the cold elements.
1.0,I was so disappointed it was for a birthday tomorrow I will be returning it and repurchasing it in rose gold is that possible
1.0,Way to high.
1.0,"This is a junk.  Leather is paper thin.  Shipping took forever.  Comes from China, not US.  Don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!"
1.0,A mi hija no le gustaron Para nada y tuvimos que devolverlos espero que me devuelvan mi Refund
1.0,It br0ke apart.
1.0,Horrible quality. Tears easily. Super cheap.
1.0,They are too wide for my foot
1.0,Broke after wearing one time.  Very flimsy.
1.0,tough to get cards out. Once you take the elastic off nothing to keep the sides together. putting money under the elastic is risky as it is not real tight.
1.0,Not as pictured very cheap spandex not same colors or patterns. DO NOT BUY
1.0,"These might fit a child but definitely not an adult foot. I couldn't fit all 5 toes inside and there is no stretch so i attempted to use these on just 4 of my toes. I was only trying to protect my sheer nylons from ripping at the big toe and these were extremely uncomfortable. Even with just 4 toes in these my feet were swelling around the seams. The seems are also extremely thick and in incredibly sensitive locations where you put a lot of your weight so these caused blisters. My feet are so sore now and they actually had cut off circulation on my 2nd littlest toe because it didn't fit over my littlest toe. The seem for the padding was right where you put all your weight in the ball of your foot so it was painful every step and the padding didn't cover the ball of my foot so i even blistered where the padding was supposed to relieve pressure. Terrible design. Needs to be stretchy material and sized to fit your foot, not one size fits all. Im a size 9 btw so you can imagine how small these are by the pictures"
1.0,"The pants are transparent, too small and tight."
1.0,Tiny tiny tiny! I'm 5 9 and 140 and ordered large and I didn't even try it on it is sooooo small! Thought I accidentally ordered a child's sweater! I really wanted the navy white combo. Oh well! Returned it via Amazon locker. Super fast and convenient!
1.0,"earring was so small, I couldn't even tell what color the stone was.  I've already lost one because it went all the way through my ear and fell out."
1.0,"Watch looks great and felt good on, very light.  However after wearing it for three days 2 of the screws fell out of the back of it.  I have a desk job so it is not like I was out in the field where it got jostled around alot.  Returned the watch."
1.0,Way overpriced. Hot Topic had this exact same necklace for like nine bucks.
1.0,"I really wanted to love this dress, I have 2 others from this company and they fit me perfectly. However, on the first day of  wearing it, it ripped along the seam on my left forearm. I didn't do anything weird in it, it didn't fit too tight, it just ripped for no reason. It's a shame because I could have loved this dress. I am 5'7"" and 125 lbs and I got a small."
1.0,Cheaply made. Shorts are tiny
1.0,I returned mine.  The masks are cute but too thin to be effective.
1.0,Not what I expected it to be. it is the worst I have seen. they don't do what they say their supposed to do
1.0,"I would give this no stars if I could. I own a Vivomove HR watch, and these DO NOT work. As soon as you touch the plastic part that attaches to the watch the pins spring out of their holes and the whole band falls off of the watch. There is NO way these could ever hold a watch on someone’s wrist even if it was lose. Do not waste your money on these cheap watch bands. You are getting what you pay for with these: nothing."
1.0,"Garbage. Too tight, pattern was messed up. Comes from China."
1.0,This is plastic that doesn’t even cover the sodes of the earrings with the picture.
1.0,The pants I ordered came on time but when I opened them they had an oily stain on them they were dirty the print was done on the dirt and some fuzzy lint! I am not very happy to see this when it should be brand new!
1.0,"I returned them right away. I can tell they were cheap and wouldnt last that long. Probably wouldnt make it through a delicate wash.<br />But it did look like the picture, and the white fur stuff was super soft, like rabbit fur. But now your foot slides around. And they are a little small. Order up.<br />I decided to just get mine from Walmart. Like all my other previous slippers like this."
1.0,"Lasted about two months before snapping in two. I wore it only around the house, never pulled on it. Oh well. Ya get what ya pay for."
1.0,This mask does not protect anything
1.0,I bought the &#34;size 12&#34; for 2t-4t and its way too large. My daughter is 3 and wearing 3t. This would easily fit a 5 or 6 year old. Sizing guidelines are very inaccurate.
1.0,Tarnished after 1 wear
1.0,The picture looks like a well made sturdy hat. But what you get is a flimsy child’s size hat. I should of known you get what you pay for.
1.0,"Should not have this advertised as LED. It is misleading.  I didnt read the full description and thought I ordered the LED mask. I wished to exchange for the LED but the option is not available and there is no refund. So, this was a waste of $30."
1.0,It look nothing like the picture!
1.0,It look like a child purse
1.0,The part that goes through your ear is huge. I couldn't wear any eating for a week after I wore these for a few hours. They are hard to close & just as difficult to unlatch & get off your ear. They went in the trash.
1.0,"I wanted to like these shoes. The styling is nice and they looked to be comfortable, but the manufacturer appears to have sizing issues. I ordered a size 10 and I felt like Cinderella’s evil stepsister when I tried them on – they were just too small. I see other reviewers have had the same problem, and I wound up sending them back. Based on my experience and that of other reviewers, I would steer clear."
1.0,"The bra was too small. My body poked out of it in very unflattering ways. Yes, I'm over-weight, but the XL should've fit me. I've sent both bras back."
1.0,The opal sticker fell off within a week...
1.0,Concept of design is cute but doesnt fit well...fabric is low quality.
1.0,"Took forever to get here and it was so wrinkled, had to send it the dry cleaners."
1.0,So disappointed. When my husband opened the belt up to put his buckle on the the snap buttons broke right off.
1.0,I only got 11 of the rings. Out of 17. And they didn't even give me the ring that made me get the pack. Would not recommend. And one came broken
1.0,Sizing is a major issue with this country.<br />I will NOT be buying any clothing from them until they learn the proper sizes for American bodies.<br />Sorry.
1.0,"Zero star. Don’t bother to buy this. It says great for summer, no air coming in, very cheap. It’s just for display. Can’t even return it not worth my gas dropping this off."
1.0,"Firstly, this was not shoes I had purchased. Pls changed your questionnaire.<br />Feedback: I liked the design and color and am even fine if it were to fit a bit too large. But this comes with a very cheap plastic. It's too fragile. Hence I returned."
1.0,"First let me say the crystals are beautiful. But  I have not had these 30 days yet and the alloy bail is just that ...alloy! I wish these had a sterling silver or, a stainless steel bail because mine are not silver anymore they have copper showing through and that’s really ugly. 😩"
1.0,The holes in the metal lattice allow the sun to stab you in the eyes. Very uncomfortable.
1.0,Item arrived broken and will unfortunately not be replaced in time for the holiday. I purchased this for my niece. It came in good time with packaging in a hard plastic case. No cracks in packaging but the face plate was hanging off the panel of the watch and the strips ripped off. Very disappointed because this was my surprise gift for my niece to go along with the LOL dolls. I will be returning and am weary of reordering.
1.0,"Hate the quality. Ordered a small, arrived as big as a medium. Very baggy instead of firm fitting"
1.0,The soles fell apart last week. 3 weeks of use and now they are trash bound. Poor product.
1.0,"I purchased this bracelet in March and after very light wear, it's completely tarnished. I would go as far to say this is a knock off because I have several true Alex and Ani bracelets and not one is like this! So disappointing!"
1.0,Looks like the item came from a gumball machine. Disappointed...get what you pay for!
1.0,"So, I was going to go with 2 stars because they do fit, but where do I draw the line?<br /><br />First of all, it's rare that I write a review, but something is not as advertised then that's just not right. If these were indeed &#34;Mirrorshield&#34;, then I wouldn't be able to see my own eyes like the original mirrored Oakley lenses.<br /><br />Second, when I popped out the original Oakley lens, there is a HUGE difference in quality. I thought it was a joke and I was being Punked because the replacement is flimsy and half the thickness.<br /><br />I'm not sure how this company gets away with this and how they are getting so many reviews, but a good review isn't deserved this time. If they want to prove me wrong, send me a lens that's ACTUALLY mirrored like the description, then I will update my review."
1.0,I wore them a few times but I noticed out of nowhere like the shoe itself was coming apart which is weird I can only assume it wasn't made properly or maybe just a bad batch of shoes I got.
1.0,Can’t see out of holes  Return or fall down. I returned.
1.0,Very cute! Unfortunately the bed of the slipper is very slippy and actually hurt my ankles trying to grip to keep them on. Sad. Gave them to my daughter and she experienced the same thing and we ended up throwing them out.
1.0,Bad quality 🤮
1.0,"When I got the case, the spring was messed up and the case didn’t close properly. Will send back for a refund."
1.0,"I loved this blue jean dress, great material,style on point.  it fit perfect every where except my bust. I'm a 38 🙄And I order the largest size listed. Also the button holes had to be cut open. I'm not sending it back will give to someone I know."
1.0,The dress is pretty and fit as expected but I only had it on for 5 minutes to try it on and the sequins cut my arms. Definitely not something I could wear
1.0,"It will tarnish in about 3 weeks, to black"
1.0,They are lightweight and comfortable to wear  but I only got these because it advertised as anti-fog but they fog that’s why I’m giving it one star.
1.0,"The material is very stiff, even after several washers. Already rip at seam."
1.0,Vest was not black and gold
1.0,CHEAP DON'T BUY
1.0,"I really like this sunglasses, they fitted well, looked great but came unscrewed first day after wearing them"
1.0,"The bra sticks out on the sides of anything you wear, it continuously peels off on its own. Does not stick to skin well, came with no instructions on how to wear or put the strings through (must assemble yourself) which isn't difficult but still would have been nice.<br /><br />Update just to double check that I put 1 star cause it's that disappointing..."
1.0,I didn't have these on for 3 hrs before the seams came undone and my toes were coming through them. Don't waste your money. They are VERY poorly made. Huge disappoint.
1.0,So small and cheap looking
1.0,Looks cheap. Weird fit. Too large. Box was damaged at delivery so could not use it to return the item. Not worth the shipping costs to return. Do not buy.
1.0,"Not good quality, VERY cheap...maybe $1 or $2 ear rings"
1.0,"Difícil creer que sea verdaderamente piel, es muy parecido al vinyl.<br />Strong believe its real leather, its like plastic."
1.0,I really wanted to love this dress but the fit was a little weird for my body. I thought it would just be an oversized fit all around for a boho look but it seemed tight on top and oversized on the bottom. Wasn’t what I was expecting so I returned.
1.0,"Way to big for this woman's face, maybe better suited to a big man's face"
1.0,Very cheap.  Material was already coming out before I went to the gym. All my other leggings from other stores were perfect.  Such a bummer since I love the color.  :(
1.0,"EXTREMLY SMALL!!! Got a large, came looking like a xsmall/small"
1.0,Hideous! The material was felt terrible and the opening for the head was too small. Bad on many levels. Returned.
1.0,Not good Quality I bought this eyeglasses 4 months ago and the leg is already damaged. I have to buy a new ones.
1.0,Just got them delivered yesterday. My daughter wore them for about 2 hours. She wears a size 12 and they ran too small. They wer more like a size 10
1.0,"I bought these for work to cover up my tattoos, they are so thin that the tattoo shows through. The stitching was already unraveling when I received them. Also, The top part doesn't stay up, it falls to your elbows. it's worth it to pay more for something that will actually work. Wish I could return."
1.0,Was not correct Size as advertised
1.0,"the photo shown does not reflect what I received. while the skull design on the front is the same, I was expecting a compartment like the photo shows, expecting I could put my medication for the afternoon inside (It's a very small pill) but the ""compartment"" in the ring is so shallow, you wouldn't be able to fit much of anything inside...even folks using it for more questionable purposes may find that it's not going to hold enough. the silver color on the ring looks more like paint than actual metal. overall not satisfied. On the other hand, my 6 year old was happy to add it to the dress-up collection."
1.0,The lens are pretty
1.0,"I ordered a couple sizes up after reading the reviews but they still were way too small, the fabric is also this really uncomfortable stiff synthetic crud, but they were super cheap so I guess I got what I paid for."
1.0,Too narrow at the thong.
1.0,Poorly sewn.  First time I put it on the seams on the bodice started to unravel. Yucky nylon material and poorly made.
1.0,Charm discolored after only a few wearings. Very disappointing.
1.0,Strap broke after 1 week
1.0,"Too small must be a  child watch. No billing or packing slip, No item number to send back to<br /><br />china"
1.0,Fits very small and short
1.0,"So disappointed in these.  Isotoner's quality has taken a nosedive.  Not even through one winter and linings of mittens have torn, requiring hand repair.  And they are noticeably thinner than other pairs I have had.  Wish zero stars was an option.  Look elsewhere, especially if you live in the frozen tundra like I do."
1.0,not ugly but not the product might have expected better quality finish and more and i do not get the brand allegra
1.0,Piece of junk that fell apart when I took it out of the package. In the process of returning.
1.0,"Completely terrible. Won't fit on any type of ear, it just falls off. Even from something as cheap as this I at least expected it to wrap around, not just be a plank. You can't bend it either. I would definitely not recommend this awful thing they call jewelry."
1.0,Lo único malo es que los estampados son de muy mala calidad y son un plástico pegado que se daña muy fácilmente
1.0,"I returned these immediately. The fabric was cheap and itchy, and they were definitely too small. I thought the tucked shape would be flattering and fun, but they were so uncomfortable that I couldn't wait to get them off. These were awful."
1.0,Dislike time always changing
1.0,Horribly made with tangled stringy fringe. I'll have to cut it off or just throw away.
1.0,"It’s $10 for 1 earring, not a pair! You can get a pair at Hot Topic for that price."
1.0,causes pain in my piercing and also caused me a lot of green on my nose
1.0,"Just by pulling the underwear on to try them caused the fabric too rip, not once...but twice."
1.0,The one is stuck currently in my ear. No matter what I can’t get the threads to break loose. The quality of the art itself is not good at all. You can hardly tell what it’s supposed to be. Asked for a refund. But I have to send them back. I sure how well that’s going to work since I’m unable to remove one. I might have to break it to her it out at this point. So yes very disappointed in this one.
1.0,"It is cute at first glance but wow completely see-through cheap thin material! If you can see my booty posing normally, just imagine the squatting! It would not last a whole leg workout for me, chile my booty would tear that right up. So disappointed because I’ve been looking everywhere for squat proof leggings and with the reviews I was hopeful of this one but nope! 💔"
1.0,"I was dissatisfied with this shirt. A large isbig on me, this shirt, which was a large, was smaller than expected. Did not fit at all."
1.0,They stop working 3 day after we got them
1.0,The product came with a large hole in the middle of the fabric
1.0,"Este producto es una estafa , sólo la use dos veces y voto el brillo y se puso negra , voy a quejarme a amazon por este artículo q no sirve psra nada ."
1.0,"I have never met such a terrible item on amazon,also I don't know why there are so many good reviews,have they try the necklace on?this necklace claim Not Allergic,but I feel Itch when I put it on,the quarlity is also hard to bear,to my surprise,it lose color and drop crystal,only after 2-days wear,the following pictures show you the truth,the chain contact with neck fade obviously than the end of the chain,though this is not dear,but it is not the cheapest one,I don't know why it could have so bad quarlity"
1.0,Very cheaply made and mine came broken.  Would not buy again!
1.0,I like the  Color but it was too small
1.0,"This dress is definitely not made for anyone with curves. The location of the pockets is in such an awkward spot and it makes you appear wider. The bottom of the dress is stiff, not flowy, which I was hoping for. Requested an immediate return."
1.0,I was so looking forward to these earings. When I got them I immediately tried to put them on and I noticed that one of the earrings was not the standard gage for standard earring size. I could not put it on with out ripping my ear piercing wider than it normally was. Basically the cat tail was too fat to be an earing. I was so disappointed that I couldn't wear them. I still have them but now I don't know what to do with them.<br /><br />Sad Cat Mom.
1.0,Already broke. My granddaughter is so disappointed.
1.0,"Demasiado pequeño, en la foto de promoción se mirá más grande y el diseño es espantoso de muy mala calidad si estuviera bien hecho no importaba el tamaño pero el dibujo está todo borroso"
1.0,Completely different shirt the second time I ordered it. First set was awesome. Second set was too stretchy and did nothing for me.
1.0,I bought those shoes prior to our vacation for my 2.5 year old and they  lasted less tan  2 weeks. All of the stitches  on the front  started  to come off.
1.0,"I expected this to fit tighter, but it would not stay up. I’m more on the petite size, so I wasn’t entirely surprised, but my husband has a normal size adult head and could not keep it up, either. Kind of pointless if it will not stay in place. :-("
1.0,"I have several pairs of leggings from this brand. I love them, they are soft and usually fit well. This pair seemed a bit small. Second time I wore them the seam ripped out on the rear. Luckily I hadn't left the house yet."
1.0,terrible screen respone with this protector
1.0,too small ad material very thin
1.0,I ordered these as a gift for some and they are not even close to the size listed.  I just kept them for myself and wear them around the house.
1.0,"YOU GUYS. I am 5”3 size 4. The sweater fit good over leggings, could have been a bit longer but was nice and loose. The first time I wore this out to bar. I was sitting there sipping on drinks in a comfy chair. This shirt UNRAVELED all the way down the sleeves and down my sides. My bra was hanging out. It was funny but also embarrassing. I buy most of my clothes from amazon and this was the first time this happened. Do. Not. Buy. This. Sweater. I was naked after one drink and it was not intentional. Never again."
1.0,turn my finger green
1.0,The stones do not look like this  and it is not 8mm long they are 6mm. The WHOLE reason u got them was for length! Not happy
1.0,The chain arrived broken
1.0,"Thin, weird synthetic pajama material, negative dye printing for the words. This is a sad, flamable pajama top, not a sweathirt."
1.0,The size was fine they are not well-made they are coming apart and I only washed it once never buy again.
1.0,It is not sterling silver maybe plated but still turned my finger green.
1.0,The back of this dress looks nothing like the picture. I will be returning this.
1.0,"I didn't get the tail, just the wings. Halloween is ruined"
1.0,The product was not as good quality as expected. Had to return the item.
1.0,This looked nice on the site but biggest waste of time and money being i had to pay return postage for a horrible piece of merchandise.  Will never buy anything from this seller again. Seller refused to refund money!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,order larger than you normally wear
1.0,Do not buy this if you’re expecting what’s in the pictures. What came in the mail was a Tshirt material. It’s not a sweater material at all. it’s very cheap in the way it feels and looks. Do not buy. Falsely advertised!! If I could give 0 stars I would.
1.0,Such a cute dress ordered a size up. Cute cover up wrinkles easy and 3 buttons popped off while I was buttoning wouldn't recommend
1.0,I ordered 3 of these and 2 of them broke while removing them from the package.  The metal piece does not hold up...especially not for children.  We did return the product and they are processing the refund.
1.0,I disliked these because they have something on the lenses maybe I'm not use to the polarized lenses (haven't ever had a problem with other polarized lenses). Also they fit awkward.
1.0,This keychain broke in less than a week.
1.0,"This boot was very disappointing. They run a little small, they are very hard, and smelled like moth balls from the packaging. They do not run in half sizes. They are very pretty and I love the color, but I will have to return them. It also took weeks to get them."
1.0,Wore them twice And then the frame broke the third time I opened them. Seems like they were screwed too tight or something cause opening and closing them was real stiff and caused the frame to break around the lenses. So now there in the trash
1.0,"My daughters necklace broke the 2nd timesheet wore it. Other than that quality issue, it was a cute concept."
1.0,Plastic coating Started to change color
1.0,"It fits, but the material is too thin and the colors are not what was expected.  I am not comfortable wearing it.  Giving it to Goodwill!"
1.0,too small and cheap material
1.0,the size is not right didn't fit
1.0,poor quality and looks like it will fall apart...
1.0,Came broken and very cheap quality
1.0,"It was returned. It mentioned in the description that it is a sweatshirt but, the fabric is very thin such as a tee. Long-sleeve tee."
1.0,My came with the dragons face broke off
1.0,At least it had instructions on how to repair an EXPENSIVE PIECE OF PLASTIC  that shouldn't have come with 5 big dents
1.0,Cannot read any of the writing on the animal really not happy with the product
1.0,"Totally wrong color as listed- was supposed to be red, but it's a bright magenta. Also, it is a polyester type material, not like the material described. I gave it to someone else, as it is nothing like what I was wanting."
1.0,When worn the top doesn’t look and feel like the picture. The back was cute though.
1.0,These are absolutely awful and have no compression at all very deceiving. Fits like a regular tank but it is silky not cotton.
1.0,White dress is completely see through
1.0,"I was excited to receive this ring, i like rubies.  I was so disappointed when it came in and it took forever to get here only to realize the color was nothing like what was pictured,  not even close. The color was more of an orange color.  It also appeared that the stone was placed upside down.  Will have to figure out how to return it."
1.0,Extremely poor quality.  The zipper doesn’t work properly.  When I get it to actually zip it doesn’t lay flat it’s all bumpy.  Wish I hadn’t trashed the package I certainly would have returned.  Absolute garbage
1.0,"These only lasted my husband a month before the metal hinge fell apart. Long keeper, indeed."
1.0,"I will say, it has come off a few times. Not the magnetic part, but at the clasp next to the watch.<br /><br />Update: I keeps falling off and now my watch is broken!!!!!!!<br /><br />Also, when I went to the product reviews, mine is mysteriously not there."
1.0,"I had high hopes for the Thinx line of underwear. I had hoped that it wouldn't be bulky and feel like I was wearing a pad. But, alas, I tried two different styles thinking I'd like one more than the other. Nope, they both felt like I was carrying a potato in my pants. I will stick to my tampons and light days pads."
1.0,"This is not an mask.  The mask barely covers nose and mouth, and the ear loops are so short that it makes your ears stand out.  Would not buy anything from this seller again."
1.0,not even remotely close to the advertised size
1.0,IT’s comfy but the shirt is itchy I washed it and it’s still itchy for some reason!!
1.0,Looks OK.... Not worth $75!  I thought it was a better quality.. For $75.  This is a $19.99 helmet at best.  It's a flimsy rubber/latex.  They have metal ones on here for $45..get those.
1.0,Did not work on my watch
1.0,"I got them in black. The shape was as I expected, not round like other people on here thought. It is very difficult to open them because the bar is stuck into the receiver. You open the receiver and can't really get the size right to keep it functional. These are the worse quality earrings, not even worth $1 as far as I'm concerned."
1.0,"I've been a seamstress for 50 years, and this is the cheapest workmanship I've ever seen. The material is so thin there is no way it would keep you warm. Also, runs small. I ordered a 3x and it fits good. I usually wear a large."
1.0,"Very thin, I was brushing off lint, caught my finger on it, and it broke with barly a tung."
1.0,Two shoulder has the very different width and more than 5 places unstitched.
1.0,The Moana dress I ordered for my daughters birthday party didn't come with the necklace and came with the wrong flower! the flower I got was a really small pink flower . I will definitely be returning  this.
1.0,Broke in half
1.0,"It is too small, making it very difficult to put the lock that came with it.  You can easily drop the back part and not find it."
1.0,No parece original.
1.0,Too baggy at the top for me.
1.0,Only wore once won’t accept refund
1.0,I like the way it looked but it sadly came apart the first day I wore it. It is cheap for a reason. Very poor quality.
1.0,Fell apart in less than 2 weeks.
1.0,Did not get power charger
1.0,Too short for slouchy fit but too long for beanie or cap. Seams immediately started to rip out and show tattered wear after one wash.  Poor quality
1.0,IT was for litte girl NOT A WOMAN AT ALL I WAS VERY UNPLEASE..In FACt ANGRY CAUSE ENDED UP BUYING 2 OF THEM PLEASE DON'T ADVERTISE AS A WOMAN SIZE BECAUSE IT'S A LIE...
1.0,My daughter is 10 years old and is a 14/16 in size ordered her these shirts and it fits my six year old who is a 10/12 in size. Very disappointing
1.0,I liked the ventilation but they did not hold up the padding went away rather quickly I’m very disappointed in these
1.0,Ordered my size. None of them fit. They were all too large. They didn’t look exactly like the picture. Returning them.
1.0,Zipper broke one day after return window
1.0,"The product was so cheaply made.  The size portion was inaccurate, Small really fit like a medium and the length felt like it was made for someone 5'11."
1.0,Very disappointing...top was described with asymmetrical irregular hem. Well I have Never seen one designed like this...very long in the front and short in the back. I thought I had it on backwards.
1.0,Well one of my socks are put together wrong the mermaid and sea weeds are actually on the bottom of my sock. Not very happy with this.
1.0,Broke already. Missing diamond.
1.0,HOW DO I RETURN THE TROUSERS???
1.0,Did not like sent back
1.0,"The design is cute, but the embroidering at the bottom does not have material covering the interior, so it hurts and scratches when you sit down."
1.0,Did not like the fit of the shoe.  Very homely looking.
1.0,pretty rough. not soft at all. would not recommend if you like to lounge around the house
1.0,I would not recomend any if these hats unless they have options for sizes and honestly these are for children or just people with super small heads in general
1.0,Did not like the material. Too thin and looks cheap .Not worthy for the  price. I have  to return  it .
1.0,It's just a band.... no loop to hold it up.
1.0,I ordered a size larger than I normally order and it was so tight across the bust (I'm not huge) I do not recommend at all. I sent them back.
1.0,It was not a true fit. I ordered an XL which is what I always buy. I'm also long torso and it didn't fit at chest correctly it did cover enough...
1.0,Not true to size. I wear a 2x. Bought a 3x so they'd be loose. This was like putting on an XL. Very disappointing.
1.0,Clip broke less than 2 weeks after receiving this in the mail.
1.0,I am not happy with this ring at all! I got it and it already looked tarnished. I have a nickel-plate allergy so I ordered this ring because it said it was sterling silver(925) and the only thing that is sterling sliver in the ring it the “bed” that the lab made stone sits in! I will be returning the ring very soon!!
1.0,I used this bag for 30 minutes  or less  . Both handle come right out of there holes
1.0,"I am a 34A--on the small side. The cups themselves were way too big for me, and I had bought the smallest size. They covered my boobs and then some of the surrounding area. Once I put them on, they stayed on for about 10 minutes before peeling off slowly. I had followed the directions and put them on once I had cleaned and dried my chest. Maybe if you are more endowed these would work better for you, but they were terrible for me.<br /><br />What I did find that works are these nipple covers: [[ASIN:B001PU9A9Q Nippies Skin Reusable Thin Silicone Nipple Cover Pasties ADHESIVE- LIGHT Size 1]]<br />They stay put, but do not offer any support. If you are a girl who doesn't need much support I recommend skipping this backless bra and buying nipple covers instead."
1.0,"Very very disappointed!!!! Nothing like the photo. This is false advertisement. Not long at all, different color.. (Light blue) not even a denim look! I will never again order from this  company. Purchased XL and fits too well instead of big. It barely drapes. So freaking disappointed for real!"
1.0,"This did not make a difference in night driving, still see glares."
1.0,They suck for welding
1.0,Good for one 4th of July party but garbage afterwards.  Very cheap material.
1.0,They won't stay up and are not made for a garter when you try to tighten them they look wonky and it feels like you are ripping them
1.0,I'm not sure what this  is made of but it sure isn't cotton or linen. It's scratchy and hot. I'm sending it back.
1.0,"This watch looks pretty, but doesn't really keep time. I couldn't trust the time it showed at all. Also, it is not water resistant (condensation appeared inside the watch after minimal water exposure (washing hands, etc). Also, the blue plastic detail on the knob fell off after only wearing the watch a few times and the glass cracked very easily (although, full disclosure, I did drop it about 2-3 feet onto the floor- I feel like most watches would have survived such a fall better)."
1.0,Its been 24 hours since my 10 year old opened it and is wearing them and he slipped and fell 4 times at home with them.  Oddly he likes them but they are dangerous and honestly they look very cheap and overall not made well.  Even if they were safe to wear outdoors they look cheap.
1.0,It would fit a 4 year old- but not over shoes.  My 10 year old wanted these to where to comic con.  Fail
1.0,"This sleeper is mislabeled...it is NOT fleece, it is 100% cotton. It's a nice soft knit feel but it's not fleece."
1.0,"When the shirt first arrived I was very happy with it but, of course, I washed it before wearing and it shrunk! The texture of the material also changed and became more stiff.  Yes, I followed the care instructions. Looks like something my grandma would wear now."
1.0,Low quality. The graphic probably won't last through a wash. Will be returning.
1.0,"The description says that these are silver, and the picture shows the 925 silver stamped. I paid more for these thinking that the advertising was correct. They are party favors and are sold for $1.99 each elsewhere. Not at all what I was looking for! Very disappointed. Would not recommend if you are looking for something that matches the description  and the price. One broke within 3 days. Another turned my daughters finger green. Not real silver and NOT worth it!<br />I sent them back in one package and they only refunded one. Horrible, dishonest experience. Am still working out trying to get a refund-avoid the trouble and buy a different one!"
1.0,Filmsy & very cheap material.
1.0,"Terrible quality. It started ripping in the first wear. It looks cool, but the quality is not there."
1.0,The material of the hoodie is thin... the hoodie threads came apart by the pocket so basically its just a t shirt with a cowl neck. Would not recommend do not buy
1.0,Material is very poor quality. Fabric pilled after 1 wash.
1.0,"I wouldn't recommend this shirt...it is 100% cotton so have to iron it and if you dry it, it shrinks"
1.0,fell apart at stitching after first wash in a delicate cycle.  fabric is so very thin and fragile
1.0,Sized way smaller
1.0,"small, and my head is VERY small, also very different than in the picture! didn t use it"
1.0,I was very excited to get this watch. It says that it's waterproof. I was specifically looking only at waterproof watches because I want to be able to wear it at the lake and in the pool. The first time I did so I noticed the condensation under the face plate a couple days later.  I'm past the return period on Amazon and will have to contact the company directly to use the warranty. If they respond well I'll update the review. Update: I followed the contact links from Amazon and got no reply. And now the watch doesn't keep time correctly. Not worth money I spent on it!
1.0,"Muy pequeña, parece de juguete"
1.0,Stay away
1.0,This thing is way too big. If your head is the size of a bowling ball you might barely fit into it. Worst $6 spent.
1.0,"As expected, most fabric has some chemical smell so I washed it. ALL COLOR washed out. I now have a blotchy white scarf."
1.0,My son has worn these shoes 2x and they have already broke and are coming apart. Super bummed.
1.0,"First, I thought I was getting multiple colors in the 4 pack, 3 out of 4 were black and the other was gray. Second, the quality of the fabric is not very good. I ran these through the wash before ever wearing them, they were fine going in, but one of them had a large whole at the seam after it came out. Not very satisfied with this product."
1.0,After 5 punches the tool now breaks off the tip of the non tapered end spitting out your collar stay in 2 pieces . short return window so I am now stuck with it. Should have known to just buy a bulk package of collar stays. Don't fall for this gimmicky tool
1.0,I bought them for my 3 year old and she lost them the same day.
1.0,The glitter part peeled off in less than a week.
1.0,This product came whit out the crimp beads. I have too charms like that.
1.0,Rings I’ve sized are inaccurate
1.0,"The band does not stay during exercise, the pins are too small and under the  pressure the band pops idd"
1.0,This is not a true Pandora Charm...You can see the logo for Pandora on the example but when my charm arrived today it came with Pandora packaging but looking at the charm there is NO Pandora Logo on the side and there are no threads on the inside to work with an actual Pandora bracelet!! Very disappointing!!! I have requested a refund/return.
1.0,I washed this dress before I wore it on a delicate cold water cycle and it still shrunk to the point where I can’t even wear it.
1.0,"This outfit arrived without the suspenders. The shirt was marked as a 95, which is a 2T rather than the 18-24month size that I ordered. The fabric is thin and not very soft.<br />I contacted the seller but got no reply in over a week, so I am returning the outfit."
1.0,I ordered these for an interview. When they came in the mail I took them out of the package and tried them on and they ripped right down the seam.
1.0,Cheap quality! Color stripes at bottom does not look vibrant nor are they anywhere close to the width in the picture! Dont buy!
1.0,Bought this to carry shoes In needless to say only one pair of shoe would fit in here. Waste of money.
1.0,"These broke when trying to put them on. Also, my left ear got infected from metal"
1.0,"WAY too long, even cinched up. The product I received was not what I saw in the picture. No jacquard pattern in the fabric, just plain black. Size was too small, as well."
1.0,Belt is beautiful but they run small.....Large is too small....I think even an XL would've been too small.
1.0,Very disappointing.  The dress is very small and has not stretch.  This XL is more like a M/L.  It’s a small fit
1.0,"Don't waste your money.  It seemed like a good deal but the rose gold rubs off after just a few days.  I'm not sure it's actually sterling silver because my ears kept getting irritated and infected by them, and I do not have sensitive skin.  I would just order from a reputable maker."
1.0,Way way WAY too small.
1.0,"Wore out in less than a month! Cushion in bottom went away, stitching in tongue seperating"
1.0,"Also, broke the 1st time I wore this."
1.0,I have had this product for less than a year and it has turned my wrist green. NOT COOL AT ALL
1.0,the fabric was not kind to my skin. had to return it. It wasn't flattering either.
1.0,The glass fell out only after wearing it 4 hours! I loved it and got many compliments in that four hours. I am crushed because I really loved this watch!
1.0,Horrible no vale nada feo
1.0,"I was excited to receive this post. When I went to put it in my conch, the center heart stone fell out. I was unable to get it back into the prongs. Very disappointed that I never got to wear this post."
1.0,"If I had known this shirt was actually from “Shein”, I wouldn’t have bought it. It is cheaply made and had strings coming off the sleeve as soon as I opened the package. The back is completely sheer so not appropriate wear to work unless you have a tank top underneath. The sleeves are tight and the overall shirt is not figure flattering. I’m not sure sizing up would have helped at all- it probably would have just made me look like my body shape is a door. Super disappointed."
1.0,"This shirt is a crop top.  It doesn't look like the shirt in the picture at all.  I was hoping it would be a normal sized shirt, but unfortunately it isn't.  I am sending it back."
1.0,I ordered size 6.5 blue skecher foamies and they are literally an 8. I ordered another pair of skechers foamies on same day from different seller because neither seller had my size in both colors. The 6.5 pink pair from other seller fit perfectly.  Definitely put in for a return.
1.0,"ugly, poorly constructed.  It was a waste of my money"
1.0,When washed longer fit. shrunk  to a really small size. Not a good product. Can't wear.
1.0,"Poor fabric quality. Came straight out of the dryer with tons of wrinkles. The buttons in the pic are dark & blend in with the shirt, but my blue shirt came with bright white buttons that stands out. Disappointed in my purchase."
1.0,Screw top is impossible small
1.0,"It’s very hard to wear… and also this is not new one , used one"
1.0,"This item is very cheaply made, it’s not worth $20. The pants are see-through in the light and it came with a hole on the pants down into the legs."
1.0,Awful! Don’t waste your money. I ordered a medium and it’s xtra small material is cheap and the design is cheap and a iron on. Also it only has one star because you have to in order to submit your review  or it would have zero stars !
1.0,"Looks very fake in gold, picture showed silver. That's what I was expecting."
1.0,Product fell to bits within two months.  Total junk :0(
1.0,"Trash,please don't buy"
1.0,Will not buy from seller again!  So small can't hardly hold in fingers to put in your ears!
1.0,Very very small. For a 4x...
1.0,"Love love loved these pants, however I bought 5 pair of them and one of the seams on one pair was completely defective. After one time of wearing it the seams started to come undone 😫"
1.0,Very disappointed. I've only had the bag two months and one of the straps has already broken. Glad I didn't buy the black one too.
1.0,I ordered two different items from this seller.  The first (striped shorts) arrived quickly and was very nice though a smaller fit.  But the second item (grey) shipped from china.  I waited a very  long time for this to arrive.  And the product was terrible.  Legs were unfinished and looked like they had bee cut with a packet knife.  I threw them in the trash.<br />Customer service was very nice though.
1.0,Frame cracked 24 hrs after receiving.  Light weight and cheep.  Optics are questionable. Magnification is not the correct  - too strong.  Don't purchase - cheap - get what you pay for
1.0,I usually wear a 3x I ordered the 4x and it fits like a 2x would I have to return it. Bummer it's cute and the collar fits weird too.
1.0,Horrible nightgowns. Fits very very small. I bought a black one and the dye transferred all over my pillow and sheets. The white one was very thin and of poor quality.
1.0,Mask didn't work upon opening it...
1.0,They changed color and left a blue Mark in my ears…
1.0,strap buckles part inside the shoe sticks out really far and wore my poor daughters foot she has a terrible blister and she had on white frilly socks! Horrible purchase cheap product even the buckle doesn’t work or make sense.. amazon should 1000% drop this seller
1.0,"Mine was received with very weak and tearing rubber handles. I'm sure they will break very soon due to the poor quality. The beads are very pretty, but not a true purple."
1.0,"The bracelet is beautiful, but the closure is terrible and I just lost the first time that I used. Please you have to improve that. Beauty doesn't matter if it isn't useful."
1.0,"Absolute garbage.  The clips don't instill any confidence.  The magnets and the clasp may be strong enough to stay while you walk around, but the way you install them onto your lace is by using an extremely small screw (1 per clasp).  They WILL rip through your lace and they WILL disappear.  I burned the end of my laces to make them firmer for easier install, but they broke several times as I was leaving my house.  I just gave up and spent more money to replace the laces.<br />It's a great idea, but exceptionally poor execution."
1.0,wayyyyy to big for conch piercing the bar is also not long at all. poor quality do not recommend .
1.0,"Wtf? Three pieces, all different length even though they are supposed to be the same size! How hard is it to make clothes the same size?The material is different as well. Who the @@ makes these clothes? Waste of my time and money. Returned once before as sizing was unrealistic."
1.0,The fabric was not acceptable. Returning.
1.0,cheap crap
1.0,Broke within a day
1.0,"Waaaaaaay too small, I thought I'd be safe with medium and I'm nervous even the large wouldn't fit. I'm 5'3&#34; 136lbs way too small and tight in all the wrong places. The graphic is adorable and the material is nice but the sizing is way off. It did arrive sooner than expected so that was cool but I can't wear them. :("
1.0,WAY too small in the chest/arms area.  Order atleast 2 sizes above if you want to be comfortable in the upper part of this dress.  Dress is unwearable for me.
1.0,"The arms on the sweater are extremely long and the neck of it is extremely tight.  Seems as if it was constructed incorrectly.  First time I have ordered from this company and it will be the last time..given that I would have to pay for the return and it costs almost as much as the purchase to send it back.  Very, very dissatisfied with product and service."
1.0,I live the pink but the large wad too big and a smaller size isn’t available. Will you be getting more?
1.0,"Very bad quality, so disappointing. Just receiving it ."
1.0,"I wanted to like this soooo much, but it was not flattering in the hips and torso area, and I’m not big at all. Cheaply made and colors were super muted"
1.0,"I'd never buy these again. The first day they ripped on the side from just bending, they are the same as all the other shorts I have no issue with. Trash."
1.0,"Literally so wide. SO WIDE. I'm pretty small, I'll admit, but this is definitely wide. The material isn't very good, either, so I imagine if a medium or large girl with substantial tatas tried to wear it, the straps (thin fabric/thin width)would stretch in one wear or snap completely, and it's not very elastic, so it would be more like a tight shirt than a bralette."
1.0,"This was a great idea until we got it and tried to use it. It charged just fine, we followed the easy instructions to set the settings, and after wearing the watch for one day, it just quit. Now we have to keep it plugged in just so it will actually work. If we unplug it from the charger, it stops working. Not a great product for $35. Poorly made. I'm returning it."
1.0,It broke the moment we took it out of the package.
1.0,Runs very small and it didn't look like the picture at all it actually came like a sweater there was no gold zipper
1.0,The 2 star rating is due to the quality and fitment. The quality is really cheap hence the thinness of the pj's.<br />It's thing like a wafer. the top is sized smaller than the bottoms which is really a hit or miss.<br />I would say also the price was kind of not priced correctly for what they were selling.
1.0,doesnt work as expected even by buying 2 sizes smaller than my regular shirt.
1.0,What a joke. Buy American! This top kept popping up everywhere I was on the web. Finally I relented after reading reviews. It is a sleazy material that looks like it could melt. I ordered 3x because I am a 2x. It fits like a size 12. Shame on me. I took a chance and it was a bad deal. Oh....and if u don’t mind waiting 6 weeks for it then order away. Lol
1.0,Very thin and bad quality of material that sticks to the body. Made my neck area very warm that you just want to take it off as soon as possible
1.0,it broke after couple of months
1.0,"Runs large, and did not come with the suspender straps. Pretty disappointed since the suspender bottoms where the main reason I decided to purchase this outfit for my little girl."
1.0,To small by bigger size
1.0,I was disappointed because it was too big. I bought the small and it wasn't a great fit. The shorts were baggy in the front area and the shirt was too long.
1.0,Packed in paper wrapper
1.0,Runs small bad blisters.
1.0,XL (size ordered based on other reviews) was too large and style not flattering. Fabric is very odd and not comfortable.
1.0,Cut was awful and it had elastic in places it shouldn’t be.
1.0,"HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! FIRST of all, took over a month to get: and its very cheaply made. Feels just like that fake costume material they use on kids halloween costumes."
1.0,Product is super cheap.  There is no heel in the socks. They are barely half way up my shin and are stretched tight at that they are very uncomfortable.  The coloring fades to a white/pale purple because of how thin the material is. I will not buy again.
1.0,Broke as I was putting them on
1.0,The set of 3 black lava stone studs came in a pretty black bag along with the card shown in the photo. I should have known by the care required that it meant they were not made well. The first thing I noticed was that the earring backs were too loose to stay on so they give you tiny plastic nibs to keep on it as well. But the worse was when I was taking off the middle size pair on the first day I wore them and the ball detached from the stud. I retuned them. Don't waste your time.
1.0,The wires are really floppy and the battery pack is super heavy! And has to be hooked somewhere. My little would not wear it!! Don’t buy! Waste of money!!
1.0,"Absolutely the worst piece of cheap junk we've ever ordered (my elderly fathered insisted on getting them). Total failure as a product, plus they doubled our order for an outrageous S&H fee. Simply horrible. Avoid."
1.0,[[VIDEOID:fddb762f40f213bd03cd5e7103dc9331]] This not safe
1.0,This boot came in and it was not at all what I pictured.  The shoe runs big and the calf of the boot was tighter than it should be.  They do not stay up and constantly slide down. I returned them.
1.0,"I was disappointed.  In the picture, it appears to be pearly white, and the &#34;Swarovski&#34; crystal really sparkle.  In fact, it is more of a brushed pewter, and the &#34;crystals&#34; look more like rhinestones.  It is okay, but I wouldn't have paid this much, if I would have seen it in a store. Maybe, $5.99, with free shipping. Speaking of shipping, it did arrive earlier than expected."
1.0,"5""5"" - 155 lbs - Size M<br />This is not even remotely the item pictured. 1) I was skeptical when I realized that USPS had put it in my mailbox... along with quite a bit if mail and it fit easily....<br />2) As I was taking it out of the bag, I could clearly see through the material - almost like netting. Solid matrix of holes that my ceiling light could shine right through.<br />3) The shape is like you would expect of an oversized hoodie - boxy and narrows a bit at the bottom. Shoulder seams fall several inches down the arm. Hood is standard to small. None of the cute A-line shape like the pic.<br />4) The measurements.... my God. The bust is over 8"" larger than the size chart. Sleeves are 3"" longer. Length is about 3.5"" shorter.<br /><br />I've had some bad buys that were poor imitations of the pictured item.... but this one is by far the worst - especially for almost $40. Sending back and hoping I actually get my refund."
1.0,This isnt waterproof for 4 feet let alone 200 miters and the only gauge that works is the on that has the time
1.0,"Mine were WAY too big, I ordered my usual size.  Plus the legs flap around, they are like clown pants.  When I went to return them, you have to pay for shipping and the seller lives in some strange foreign land and shipping costs more than what you paid for the pants.  Hence they offer you 50% back and you can keep the pants.  Well, that's something.  But now what do I do with the brand new pants??"
1.0,Al dejar durante la noche para. Se retrasa el minutero. Sin una semana de uso y sin golpes cae una perilla del reloj. Total decepción. No vale la pena. Quisiera devolver....pero me resultaría más caro. No recomiendo.
1.0,Ordered the “Royal blue” color opened it up and it looked like their teal color that is advertised. I figured it was just a mix up and we got the wrong color so I processed a return to get the correct color and the replacement was the same color. As you can see in the picture the shirt is a typical royal blue and the pants laid on top are far from it.
1.0,Clasp broke after two months. Very cheap quality.
1.0,The waste was fine but the legs are too tight and not happy with this product
1.0,"They did not fit at all. Even when I tried to fit them to my teeth, they still would not fit. I even tried to give them to my husband and they were still to big. They were only good for a prop at my 80s party."
1.0,CAUTION.. not as pictured. Cheap quality. They are way lighter and thinner than pictured. The pink is super light. It is not the same product as pictures. Won’t be buying again.
1.0,cut small cute look I cut the sleeves off they were tight and it works as a jumper so I kept it.
1.0,The are of low quality and are ugly. It is just a cheap screen print on the outside of the underwear. Do not buy.
1.0,Looks and feels cheap.. but it is !
1.0,"Would not buy again!! They are way to long for the size, and so thin you can see right thru..."
1.0,"Nice material, but returned. Looked weired on me. Definately not as expected. Runs small so ordered 2 sizes up. Still a bit snug around the waist and thighs, and legs too long. Not attractive at all and not as shown in the picture."
1.0,The dress fits very tight on my chest I am a 36C and the length isn’t long enough for someone my height.
1.0,There was a large hole in the front of the dress
1.0,The shirt smells horrible ... can’t figure out what the odor is and I ordered a medium that fits like an extra small.
1.0,"This shawl stick is absolutely beautiful but unfortunately the shell material is too brittle for its intended purpose.  Within a couple of days the tip lost its smoothness (chipped off), leaving a slightly jagged edge which catches on the yarn, so no longer any use for pinning a handmade woolen shawl :("
1.0,Not true  I size and it looked cheap
1.0,broke in half after 2 weeks.. its just a bad design not even worth sending back.
1.0,"Rusted within a week, pinches the skin, and pulls the hair. I threw it away."
1.0,This item has been returned.......did not fit and very cheaply made for a DNKY garment. Also came stuffed in a plastic tube......don't think these wrinkles are coming out. Will post again after return is completed.
1.0,It is not cotten or leather. It is some type of plastic. It melts when held near a flame. Cotton and leather don't melt.
1.0,cheap quality. turned my neck green. unfortunatley past return time. DO NOT BUY.
1.0,"I really like this nitie BUT it says in the description that it has ADJUSTABLE STRAPS and it does NOT!!!! So it falls OFF my shoulders all the time and does NOT FIT CORRECTLY. The seller had nothing to say about NOT telling the TRUTH about it except I could send it back.. I am NOT spending my time and driving to take this back when they were WRONG, why should I, gas is too expensive to have to drive to town to send back something they lied about. I am NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER and will NOT buy from them again."
1.0,"I wear a women's size 7.5 shoe.  These socks are so large that they slip, twist and turn on my feet.  I have found that while walking the socks turn on my foot so that many of the grippers are on the side and top of my foot rather than between the soles of my feet and the floor.  This defeats the purpose of wearing socks with grippers."
1.0,Runs very short (and I am not tall at all). Sleeves are too puffy to fit in a coat. Cuter in pics than in real life.
1.0,They aren’t well made. They fall apart. They snap off the glasses easy. Don’t spend you money. I didn’t bother to send them back. It was to late.
1.0,fabric was cheap and size was small
1.0,"Looks and feels cheap. I'm embarrassed to give it as a graduation gift to my niece tomorrow as planned. Will have to just give the standard ""money in a card"" now.  Disappointed but not surprised. My fault for waiting until the last minute to get something."
1.0,I ordered an XL so I would have plenty of extra room. I prefer my shorts decently baggy. These were skin tight and had no stretch whatsoever. I am normally a medium. I can't even imagine how tight those would have been. I do not recommend these at all. There is absolutely no way to size these correctly. Save your money!
1.0,I bought 3 pairs a couple of months ago and loved them so I wanted to buy some more. The 2 pairs I got are black and now they are see through I am very disappointed. Will not buy again
1.0,It just broke on a sunny day -- definitely NOT SAFE .... beware
1.0,"Broke on 4 days. Ends were not attached well<br />to beads. Wanted refund but had very few beads left, so nothing to send back. Pretty but don't buy it."
1.0,Way too small. I don't like it at all. It barely has any weight.
1.0,Don't waste your money. Just order smartwool or thorlos. Hese got a hole in the heel after two uses of general use in an all terrain shoe. We didnt even hike with them yet! They ate very thin. More like a dress sock if that is what you are looking for.
1.0,The logo on the front of the hat is far off center and very noticeable. I was excited about wearing this hat but it is so far off kilter that I'll never wear it in public.
1.0,"The latch does not fully close unless it’s forced but even at that, doesn’t appear there’s enough space to hold the rod in correctly. And idk what the screw adjusters are for since neither fits into the screws."
1.0,Picture and actual garment different. I returned
1.0,Poorly designed. Claw that holds leather insufficient.  Leather very hard.
1.0,Too big and material cheapq
1.0,very cute but no Protection.
1.0,They were scratched. I returned them.
1.0,"Legs too long, light weight, material does not breath, not good for sweating."
1.0,I hate this cardigan. the color is wrong... the fabric is weird and its very itchy. Cardigans are meant to be comfortable... this one is not.
1.0,Thought these were very very small and then they came with no backs.
1.0,lost my order
1.0,This has no shape and it fits oddly
1.0,They do the job but they are stinky and just generally crappy sandals for the price. Havianas are so much better.
1.0,"No tiene etiqueta con size, de acuerdo a mi talla demasiado pequeño..."
1.0,"Cute and fits as expected, but faded a great deal after just one wash."
1.0,Doesn’t look or feel right .
1.0,El material está feo nada que ver cómo la foto y nada barato quiero regresarlo
1.0,"Looked awesome, but one of the antlers broke off the first week"
1.0,"Looks nothing like the pic or description. Wide and baggy fit, different brand. Ordered slim size and they aren't. Terrible quality."
1.0,I tried the jumpsuit on when I received it. It was too large on the shoulder area and it when way lower than it should have.<br />Its was too small for my liking's around the waist and I felt that it showed all my business. I am a small woman and I rarely feel this way
1.0,GOT STUCK WITH SIX BRAS WAY TOO SMALL
1.0,The bottom rubber pieces start to fall off immediately. Didn't last one day out on the beach
1.0,"The eyelets are very loose and pull with the laces. The back scrunches at the lacing. I tailored mine to have extra material and boning in the front and back lacing so that the eyelets have more fabric to hold to and the boning to keep it from scrunching. The original boning in the front was very sharp and poked holes in the inner side, so I replaced it. The hood is poorly shaped and looks and feels a bit like wearing a trashbag made of a windbreaker. I'll probably remove it. Not as shiny as the photo, but I kinda expected that. It's very long on me as I am very short, but also was expected."
1.0,"Received this dress as a Christmas gift and was really excited. Other than it being a little longer than I had expected, the fit was pretty good. Saved the dress for a warmer day and when I put it on to wear it the thread under the seam of the bust started coming apart. Literally the thread!! NOT the seam itself! The whole bottom skirt under the bust seam came off! Never got a chance to wear the dress! Also, because it was a gift and the person who bought it took their sweet time getting the stuff I needed to return it in time I just had to throw it away! 😢"
1.0,"I wear a 1x/2x depending on the cut... I, thank goodness ordered this in a 3x thinking maybe it cut small like most gowns... Well it is cut small but, the real disappoint was the material it was made out of.. It's like a polyester tee shirt material... I was expecting it to be more.. Very disappointed!"
1.0,"There was absolutely NOTHING I liked about these cheap masks. Cheap fabric, cut raw with no stitching.<br />The Chinese are infamous for manufacturing CHEAP and UNSAFE PPE products. Advice:  Do Not Buy Chinese PPE."
1.0,Returned. Material was bad quality colors were not like pictured!
1.0,"I was in the market for a 100% cotton waffle weave bathrobe.  I purchased the light blue robe with white piping.  Contrary to the site description, the content tag indicated 60%/40% poly cotton.  On a size 16 woman, the large robe was slightly small at the hip, so tended to open up on the bottom. The robe seemed well constructed and attractive, but I returned it due to the misrepresented and undesirable fabric content.<br />**This review indicates a size small was purchased.  I purchased and received a large. I can't edit this.**"
1.0,Broke in first 5 minutes.
1.0,"Waste of money. And beware: most of the scarves listed on Amazon are also synthetic and misrepresented as Pashmina-cashmere, sometimes listing silk, as well."
1.0,Did not come in the size I ordered and the face covers for the watch were backwards. There was absolutely no way it would fit on the watch and be functional.
1.0,Only wish I could rate this ZERO star! I bought the Honda keychain less than a yr. ago and teardrop logo part keeps detaching from keychain. I second above comments that this is pure JUNK! The spline part should be welded at the very least. I threw this junk in the trash and got a solid one. NEVER buy from this unethical seller again pawning Chinese garbage!
1.0,Don’t bother to use the size chart because it’s not correct.
1.0,Missing one shirt... black?
1.0,Not what I expected to small and didn't wash well either had to return them.
1.0,Didn’t make return date now I’m stuck with it. Too small and too tight. The size is way off I’m a curvy size 6 in women’s clothes<br />The medium was way too tight<br />If I need to purchase more than one size up then I’d say the item should not be sold in the USA as women are not structured to be a medium and a size 4<br />Color and material are gorgeous<br />I was very disappointed in the sizing
1.0,"The metallic accent makes it look like you're wearing Brillo pads on your legs. :-o  They are also too narrow to slouch and are only thigh high for a 10-yr-old. It's not worth the postage to return them, so I'll donate them."
1.0,Both ends are like this. How do I use it?
1.0,HORRIBLE.  STAINS...POOR QUALITY...INCORRECT COLOR.  DO NOT BUY.
1.0,No pude usarlo
1.0,"The “banana” piece is literally stuffed pantyhose attached by fishing line. So not worth it..$19.99, maybe.."
1.0,These are designed for a baby
1.0,"This was more of a long sleeve t-shirt. Order 2-3 sizes up, as it runs very small. Disappointed in the product"
1.0,"How does it fit? Where. On my feet or my chest? I am only reviewing this item because of the second photo in the ad above. I wanted to buy some socks, and admittedly, I didn't buy these, but... The photo is of a sizing chart for a bra.<br />So, is it socks or a bra?"
1.0,This was a gift for our volleyball team. How embarrassing to give with misspelled word on all 24 of them!
1.0,I bought this at a full size larger than my actual size so it would be easy to slip on. Rosie O'donnel would have an easier time fitting into Gisele Bundchens bikini than I have of getting this on my foot.
1.0,leaving open space all around and making the cute little filter pad even more useless!
1.0,Pants didn’t have an elastic band on the hem which made them too long!!
1.0,These gloves are NOT made of cashmere and they are itchy!  Too bad because the style is nice.
1.0,The chain broke within two hours of wearing it after it arrived. I was simply cooking and doing dishes when it fell on the floor.
1.0,I ordered a medium for my daughter that wears a 6 and she couldn't even get them on. More like a little girls medium.
1.0,I ordered a medium and it fit my 85# 12 yr old granddaughter who is 5 feet tall?
1.0,"Runs real small, no stretch at all ..."
1.0,These facemasks didn't fit my face. Nor did they fit my daughters. They cover the nose and or mouth but not both.<br />Measurements definitely don't add up.
1.0,Received a different style dress but it’s tags on it and packaging matches the correct dress. The one we got was a hooker looking short fitted dress with a slit up the front and a deep v neck. Wth
1.0,"I have large calves, so I look for this type of boot with the buttons, since solid calves are usually too small. These fit (tightly) around my calves with leggings on, but the overall fit, especially in the foot, was just uncomfortable.<br /><br />I would not recommend these boots, but they will (tightly) accommodate 24"" calves"
1.0,The first day I put them on the stitching came apart. I had to return them. Will not buy again.
1.0,"At all, I mean the opening was tiny...had to return"
1.0,At 5’7” this came about mid calf
1.0,This is definitely NOT 5/16&#34;
1.0,Very small. Think smaller than your pinky tip.<br />Also the pink coating is flaking off as I wear it. Most of it is now silver.  Not happy with it!
1.0,"The size of the ring was way to small. After reading some of the reviews, I was hoping it would stretch a little over time, but it didn’t happen. My ring actually broke this morning so I decided to write this review."
1.0,It was cut in a way that the back is a lot longer than the front and there is excess fabric on both sides of the body. A very strange ungainly fit. I was hoping to love this piece and to wear it all summer long. Guess not.
1.0,The dress is of poor quality. It’s practically see through and u can’t wear it to work
1.0,Stem too long it hung from my ear
1.0,"Read then reviews so I ordered a large, unfortunately it didnt help as I am 5'11"" and the hem hit about 5 inches above my belly button. Will have to return, cute for a crop top though."
1.0,Bad wuality
1.0,Don't buy they're not worth it...they were broke upon arrival. They were cute and worth it until they wouldn't clasp at all. Waste of money.
1.0,"Quality was so bad. Almost plastic looking. My sister brought my order from USA to Africa, I had to literally donate it!"
1.0,"[[VIDEOID:a4675d467c9202f19ffc073c2f81c06c]] Only one side in the box, beautiful box, but one side if earring"
1.0,Very cheaply made.  I bought if for my granddaughter's recital but did not give it to her.  I bought her something else.  Don't waste your money.  The clasp is ugly and fragile and hard to clasp.
1.0,Nice material. Not quite like the photo. Dress does not flair. Also is only partially refundable
1.0,"I should have read the fine print before ordering. I knew the bottom half would be rubber but I somehow expected the top half to be leather, as are other similar looking boots. The upper half is synthetic, fake leather and is hideous. Returning."
1.0,"I wish I could give this product 0 stars.  I don't write reviews very often, but I purchased both a black and a dark blue band from this seller.  The band comes in a package labeled ""ACESHLEY"".  Both of the bands I received do not lock into place in the watch, and there is also no way to secure the watch to your wrist.  The metal post they have on the band does not fit into the holes on the other side of the band."
1.0,The size is way off. Way to small. I ordered a 5XL shorts when I normally only wear a 3 or maybe a 4XL and I wasn’t even close to being able to button the shorts. A 5XL is more like a 1XL short. Very disappointed. When I was going to return the shorts they wanted me to pay half of the cost I paid for the shorts to return them to get my money back. Don’t waist your time or money.
1.0,"I bought these and  after 2 months of the package getting lost in transit I finally got them, took them out of the bag and they were such a crappy material, the rainbow on the left side was almost halfway ripped off, the elastic was broken inside, and they smelt like burning plastic. I would not recommend this product I had a terrible experience."
1.0,I hated this item and all the others I order from this company.  The items had no zippers and they was not sewn correctly.  I really want my money back including shipping.
1.0,Really poorly made. Disappointed in this item entirely.
1.0,"The material is very thin; the leggings are see through; these are not gym appropriate clothes; if you're only planning on wearing around the house, they're suitable and would be comfortable but as far as wearing out, no way."
1.0,"The earrings came broken, I never write bad reviews but it's just disrespecting the costumer. All of it is broken and you really don't have to do much for it to be strong and not fall apart"
1.0,The seams are irregular and stands out. I will not wear the skirt. The uneven seams are too noticeable.
1.0,1. It was not real leather.<br />2. It had a very strong chemical smell that irritated my nose and hands.
1.0,Do not WASTE YOUR MONEY. This doesn’t even<br />Meet the level of costume jewelry. Looks like a 25 cent item down a gum machine. Should be NO stars!
1.0,So small should be for a child
1.0,The blouse was unfinished missing buttonholes. Poor quality
1.0,Felt like it kept falling off—not the best material—definitely won’t be wearing them<br />Donation pile
1.0,Terrible...never again!
1.0,Doesn't go in correct
1.0,"Not the quality I would have expected. The color was faded out of the box and the fabric and stitching are poor quality. Incidentally, if you live in a hot climate, this hat DOES NOT BREATHE."
1.0,"I bought this to use on my silicone adhesive NuBra & frankly, the push down-pop-top is stuck in the closed position. In order to use it I have to unscrew the lid, and pour/dribble a small amount out. The product seemed to work up a small amount of lather, which is fine and good. I'm just peeved about the potential for waist when having to &#34;pour&#34; this to try and equal what should just be a couple of drops from the pop-top-lid."
1.0,This product is supposed to be unbreakable and it is already starting to crack.  It is harder than the one I had so it is irritating on my wrist.
1.0,I returned these because they looked like a “sunmask” instead of sunglasses.
1.0,Caused severe allergic reaction and could not wear it never had a problem in 8 years with other rings.
1.0,"Very thin, I am returning them."
1.0,Colors aren’t what they appear in pic. It’s hot pink not purple.
1.0,The shower curtain is super cute but it came and has dirt all over it.
1.0,"These do not fit like a workout top, but rather very loose. Workout and athletic tops should have a snug fit."
1.0,"These fit as if they were cheaply made.  There is excessive material at the waste that is frumpy and not well fitting it all.  I expected yoga pants, as these are claiming to be, which are tight and fitting.  These are loose like Sunday afternoon around-the-house pants.  I do no think buying another size would change things as they fit in length. I won't wear them."
1.0,Mine literally broke the very first time I put it on.
1.0,"I bought this item for my wife a little less than a year ago, the fabric is starting to come off on a few places. When I asked the seller about warranty, they declined to provide any and did not even provide any manufacturer warranty information. A purse like this should last more than a year."
1.0,Watches are of no use if they do not work. All three watches arrived not working. Will cost more than the watch to purchase new batteries.  Will certainly never purchase from this seller again.
1.0,The straps are way to big with no adjustment for them
1.0,I sent this coat back to camel and my bank account has not been refunded! The coat was a size smaller than what we needed if you would refund the money or send me the coat a size larger that would be nice!!
1.0,Shirt is way to small and I sized up two sizes so I bought a 2x still to small
1.0,My glasses don't come anywhere near fitting inside these goggles. Total fail.
1.0,"These are poorly made and for almost $40, I am really annoyed."
1.0,Very poor quality plastic. Cheap! I found the same style with better quality at the drug store for $5.99.<br />Disappointed and a waste of money just opened the box 5 min ago and threw them in the trash.<br />The lenses look horrible they reflect but you get this uneven shine from the lens that looks horrible!<br />Don't buy.<br />on the other hand it did come nicely packaged...hahaha
1.0,"So tiny, I'm not sure will even fit in my ear. I got it for my conch, but will no fit."
1.0,These rusted after one day of wearing them. They are terrible quality and are very difficult to get in. As someone who has lots of piercings and has a lot of experience with earrings I was not expecting these to be so flimsy and rusty after ONE DAY
1.0,"Liked the style, but it fell off easily and the silver button part came out of the rubber within 2 days."
1.0,Too large.  If I had not worn them would have returned them.
1.0,"yall j look like a clown from the 90s with tht big hat on , even on my bd it was hugeee"
1.0,The buckle will not attach to leather belt strap . Strap is thin and fits inside buckle but will not tighten up onto belt strap once inserted into buckle .
1.0,"Way smaller than expected, order larger than you think you need, not happy at all."
1.0,Low quality and runs very large
1.0,Pretty but tiny
1.0,"IS REALLY UGLY,  DON'T LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE, AND IS TO SMALL"
1.0,Great shoe for about a month to the shoe get wet very uncomfortable one good Factor the shoes lightweight tore up with a composite toe meet the material
1.0,they don't help night time driving
1.0,Falling apart and itchy!
1.0,Be careful if you have a large chest. It quickly became a crop top and was a couple inches above my belly button. Looks like the bottom of the shirt was cut off. Will be returning.
1.0,Read the small points for sizing before buying! Awesome return policies
1.0,Definitely not as pictured. The polka dots were huge! The dress is just frumpy. Not flowy and cute at all. I wish I had thought to take pics but I immediately repackaged this item to return. So disappointed.
1.0,"They sure make this look much cuter on the model.  I am 5”3 and 125 pounds, ordered the small and it just looked odd on me.  Not flattering at all."
1.0,Material very cheap and fit beyond to small. Petite daughter could not wear at all
1.0,"This is the worst excuse for a jacket I have ever seen. It is not anywhere near as thick and stylish as shown. The tag with the care instructions, size, and fabric content was cut out of the jacket. I used their sizing chart provided by the seller and this was still way too small for me. I found a very similar jacket at my local Wal-Mart, $10 cheaper, great construction and true to size. Buyer beware and do not waste $29.99 on this cardigan/coat!!!"
1.0,Would give 0 stars if possible they are TINY
1.0,Is not good quality by price
1.0,Very sad that I still cannot find a glove that will protect me from thorns from my rose bushes. This one does not work at all. All thorns get into the glove.
1.0,Purse was super cute but I had to send it back because it had such a terrible odor. It literally made me gag and stunk up the entire room.
1.0,This watch was a waste of time and money. Don't bother to get this watch. Very hard to read the time and will not stay on for more than a few seconds after pressing the backlight.
1.0,it's nice looking but I had this real bad headache and blurry vision after I wore it for an hour! never happened before with or without any other glasses. it might be just me idk
1.0,Didn’t have time. To do this before but not worth the price value is worth 5.00 not good
1.0,Seller shipped while there was a cancellation in process within sec of accidentally pressing the buy it now button... seller will not communicate. Do not want shirt....
1.0,Worst quality & sleeves aren't puffy. It's also see through
1.0,You can see these through shirts.
1.0,Photo is very deceiving. This dress is not full at all. Material is a cheap thin synthetic. Looks like a nightgown. Ordered a size xl and this fits like a med. The hem is coming undone right out of the package. I will be returning this. Dont buy save yourself the hassle
1.0,Broke after one day
1.0,"My first thought was - I look like an 80's pizza parlor waitress.<br /><br />I could not pinpoint how much this top look VERY different than what I imagined.  I should've read the information - 80% polyester.  I shouldn't have expected a cotton-type billowy top (as pictured), instead, I got a shiny polyester material that reminds me of a pseudo silk nightgown.<br /><br />I could not figure out why it looks so off.  Maybe it's the straight cut or the material?  The arms aren't as long as pictured, should be below the elbows but it falls inches above.  The body area is supposed to have a billowy feel, but it falls straight down.  I purchased a pink, the picture has a pink tint to it, but it's just white and stripes.  Also, the chart shows the bust and waist area as 49.61 and 44.88 (respectively), it's measure is actually 42 all the way down (doesn't vary -  straight cut down).  The length was longer than the measurement chart suggests, which I like.<br /><br />Maybe I'm too big on the top and should I have ordered something larger? (I ordered a medium - I'm 5'1, 135 lbs, 32C, and usually wear a medium).<br /><br />It's a little sheer, so you need to wear a camisole with it.<br /><br />Pro - it's lightweight."
1.0,I normally wear a size 7 and have wide feet but their size 7 left me with over an inch of room. It also is costing me 5 dollars to return them so I'm not going to try another pair like planned.
1.0,Falsely advertised as full grain leather. Nope.
1.0,It was too short but large in the waistline.
1.0,Terrible.
1.0,They do not fit the FitBit Flex properly.  They are too large to function properly.
1.0,"I bought this watch and loved the looks of it.  I wore it for 12 hours to make sure the self-winding had enough activity.  When I set it and wore it, it lost 20 minutes in 2 hours.  What a disappointment."
1.0,"I loved these sandals at first.  More comfortable than Rainbow Sandals I've always had.  Unfortunately,  the top leather and is delamination and shrinking and the bottom of shoe is delamination.  I am by water and salt water and go to the beach a lot.  The process of sandals getting wet, drying, baking in the sun causes these sandals fail.  This has never happened with Rainbow Sandals in 15 years of having one pair.  I hope Reef figures it out because in my opinion the Reef sandals are more comfortable than others I have had."
1.0,Does not fit bbig faces it's made for skinny people or kids.
1.0,I returned the jacket.  I ordered an Xlarge which was about the size of a medium.  The quality of the jacket was awful.  It looks like something one could purchase at Party City for $9.99 for a Halloween costume.  I would not recommend this jacket!
1.0,My son normally wears a medium but we bought a large to be safe and he can barely squeeze into it..
1.0,Came missing a button
1.0,Way too small to fit
1.0,"SNAD-The tag indicates this is 95% rayon and 5% spandex, not cotton as the description repeatedly states! I will be returning this!"
1.0,As cheap looking as the cost indicated. Should have known better.
1.0,Doesn’t fit as shown very smsll
1.0,Purchased for my daughters at Christmas. By January they’re totally tarnished after wearing twice.
1.0,"This item is crap, crap, crap. I ordered one for my daughter for Christmas. She wore it one time and the zipper in the back broke, so her bottom would be exposed. I returned it and received a new one. She wore it one time and now there is a hole in the crotch. The material can only last one night. Very crappy for almost $30. Skip this onesie and get a different one. Very disappointed because the fabric is very soft and could be nice but it just isn’t durable at all."
1.0,"Not the same dress as pictured. This model works for Hopes Shop, a cute online boutique. Will be returning this dress."
1.0,Small does not fit right. It’s also not cotton. It’s nylon. Sending back for money. Using my prime more often. Paying closer attention to clothes shipped from China. Prefer US.
1.0,Absolutely Loved this shirt. However only able to wear one time. During washing the blank print bleed all over the shirt which ruined it. So upsetting for the price and only getting to wear it once.
1.0,"Very Flimsy, doesn’t fit the face well and poorly made"
1.0,The ring holding it comes off the pendant. The watch keeps falling off the chain because of how it is made. Don't buy it. Poorly designed
1.0,A real crappy waste of money.. The dress I received is huge and misshapen and the pattern is totally different!
1.0,don't support racist hate groups
1.0,"I order it 1 size larger than I needed, just to be safe. A U.S. size 18-20, it was closer to a U.S. size 12!"
1.0,broke immediately
1.0,"When I unwrapped, I realized I didn’t pay much attention to what the fabric was. This is very rough to the touch and feels…inexpensive (which it was, of course, but still). It was full of wrinkles. Looked like I’d need to spend a lot of time ironing that I don’t have. It’s also giving Little House on the Prairie vibes. Maybe the black would have been better. I didn’t even try it on…it will go back, unfortunately."
1.0,completely see thru
1.0,"The quality of the graphics on the shirt could not have been any worse.  Fuzzy pictures with dull colors.  They say that color brightness varies, but this was just awful.  I won’t but from this company again."
1.0,Nothing this hat is garbage looks great on internet but a piece of junk when received. Very cheap wrinkled and looks used. Don't buy it
1.0,"Purchased a 3x, fits like a size 6."
1.0,"Washed my hands and the charm turned brown. Disappointing, but you get what you pay for."
1.0,"Took to a mechanic shop and they said it was no good, had to buy one from the dealership at a very higher price"
1.0,The weave is nice but the hat is enormous I ordered a small and it is more like a large so it top sits on my head and the hat can spin
1.0,Would never buy again
1.0,Total trash. Arrived rusted and dingy.
1.0,"You gotta be kidding me. Too small and tight for size 10. Really cheap feel, as if made of cardboard. Crap."
1.0,Broke Already
1.0,"This watch band looks amazing but it will break after a few wears. I ordered it and it broke after a few wears. The company was excellent in sending me a replacement which broke after only two wears. Unfortunately I can’t give a good review for this product. Looks great, seller was great but product may need to be taken out of production."
1.0,"When I bought this, it was about 25 bucks. It was lost in transit and I had to have a replacement sent. I'm glad I did all this when I did because it's not worth 25 bucks, let alone the 53 it is at the time of this posting. The advertised dress looks mellow but fun, bright but not gaudy, and simple but comfortable in design. What I got was like sweat shop levels of awful! Thready and untrimmed to the extreme, and so clownishly neon bright that I bet it could be seen from space. If I'd paid 10 bucks for this, then it'd be fine, you get what you pay for, but for 25 or more? Nooooo. I in fact DID get a 12 dollar dress alongside this one, but from a different seller. It's amazing and I love it, and I'd rather have gotten 3 from them rather than just one because of this awful travesty. This thing reminds me of unpacking one of those $8.99 plastic bagged halloween costumes for little kids at Walmart, made shiny but badly and with the understanding that it's going in the trash within the week."
1.0,This fits more like a t-shirt than a dress. Very short.
1.0,The one I ordered was too thick. Must have clicked the wrong one
1.0,Too small this dress was not for an adult at all i had some other new dresses so i didn't get to this one to let y'all know it was too small because i would've sent it back ASAP!
1.0,"I hate the chest part, it's tight and feeling like binding my chest!!! Then it's loose down.  The sleeves are way too long 😫 !  These are make for A cups or NO CHEST woman."
1.0,"I took them out of the box, the slid on easily, I do have a bit of a rear so they were a little tighter around the hips but still would have been easy to zip...except the zipper broke the first time I pulled on it. I don't mean, reattach the ring broke, I mean the zipper snapped in half with barely any pressure."
1.0,they do not stick to hold up the breast on the breast they stick so much it about rips my breast off
1.0,"Cute but it falls apart! Only after the first wash, my two kids have received several holes in their onesies. Very disappointed."
1.0,"Cheaply made. The three silver bars have crystal stones on one side of them & 1-2 depending on how you looked at it were put on wrong so you couldn't wear it with all the crystals facing outwards . This might not bother everyone, but it was extremely annoying to me ."
1.0,"These are very thin, single layer, synthetic fabric, just punched out from the fabric, not sewn -- for show only.  With the new guidance to use cotton, multi layered masks, these were a waste of my money, unfortunately."
1.0,Dislike it because it is cut very small to be a 3x but I'll keep it because don't feel like sending it back.
1.0,Ordered this shirt once and had to return it because it was advertised with the Adidas Logo and it came without the logo. tried again and once again NO LOGO!  Once again had to return it.
1.0,I thought it was cotton don’t like that material at all
1.0,"Nothing like the image! The pants have a strange triangular cut outside the thigh that make them look like they have stupid wings. The fabric is also uncomfortably coarse. The fit, however, is very good (I have a 40"" waist and 34"" inseam)."
1.0,Sides of shoes fell apart and lights stopped working after only a few wears.
1.0,This popped off every time I moved my arm a certain way.
1.0,Button came off after second wash
1.0,like the fabrick but the size was too small even though. I ordered up a size.
1.0,"They fit good but they dont stay up. They are also supposed to offer relief for groin problems, superficial hip pain, or the cold sensation sometimes associated with bladder or prostate problems. They do not help at all.<br />To expensive and 20% restocking from this seller."
1.0,I am very disappointed. The band I bought stated it was for the vivosmart hr plus but it does not fit.
1.0,This dress arrived damaged and none of the other items in the order were damaged so I don't think it happened while in transit.
1.0,"I ordered these based on the picture.  Should have read the reviews, they are just cheap plastic blue/red/white chips, not the ones pictured.  Very dishonest IMO."
1.0,"I gave this to my son for Christmas. I thought t was beautiful and knew he would love it. He only has one self winding watch and he wears that one most of the time so he didn't use the watch winder immediately. Unfortunately I just found out that it only worked the first time he used it but when he tried a second time, it didn't work at all."
1.0,The colors aren't true as they appear on screen. This is very dark burgundy.
1.0,"I bought this dress for my granddaughter. It was darling. When she was trying it on, the sleeve fell off. I returned it & decided not to re-order."
1.0,Poor quality!!! Picture is too pretty conpared to what it really is.
1.0,"I purchased the purple pendant.  What a mistake!  When you go cheap, you get cheap.  The ""turquoise"" in this pendant is not veined nor is it ""chunky"" looking as you are led to believe from the pictures.  The pendant also looks considerably larger on the mannequin's chest than it really is.  The dimensions are listed; however, the pendant's  large bail  is included in the sizing.  Also, the picture shows the turtle's back to be solid silver.  Mine is hollow and shows the ""stone.""  I purchased a matching stone bracelet from this same company.  It appears to be of better quality, i.e. it's heavier and has a little more veining; however, I will be retuning both items as they were intended as a set.  The nicest thing about this pendant is the included silver chain.  Suggestion:  the Amazon Collection has a gorgeous 18k yellow gold over sterling silver genuine jade turtle with included chain for $36.37."
1.0,Not happy with this purchase.. it’s very small n lightweight.  Much better picture than the actual item itself.. I’m returning it
1.0,"It seems unfinished. If you buy wrong size or even if it’s defective, the company will not allow you to return. Do not waste your money until this company changes its policy."
1.0,"Want to spend money on a cheap jacket that barely resembles the product photos, then look no further. Plus, this is a third party seller that doesn’t care you’re unhappy with their shoddy products."
1.0,"I have to wear masks to work for COVID... yadda yadda...<br /><br />It looks great, and I wish I didn’t have to say that after only 2 wearings the threads holding the mask to the top elastic band ripped.<br /><br />Disappointed with that, because, otherwise, it is nice.  At the time, it was also one of the more expensive ones I purchased."
1.0,The dress is not as pictured. So disappointing!
1.0,Didn't work.  Returned and replacement doesn't work either.
1.0,The fabric is very cheap material. Not breathable. The fit is little bit off for me. This dress is for very slim and tall person
1.0,"So far, 2 of the pairs broke with any pressure upon tying within a week of freshly lacing up into shoes.  One pair would have been a fluke.  2 pairs indicates to me substandard construction, and I won't purchase again, nor will I recommend."
1.0,"I purchased a medium and what I received was extremely large.  I mean, comically large.  I purchased a brown version of the same shirt previously and it fit just fine.  I guess it's a lottery system of sizes.  Good luck."
1.0,Thank Goodness they were Cheap and I only ordered one pair. These earrings Do Not fit My Ears as they Fit the Models Ears. With that being said they do Not look like you are wearing multiple earrings. Yuck! I will prbly never wear these and they will collect dust in my jewelry box. Just odd looking since they don't curl in under my Lobe. Wish I could return!
1.0,NOT GOOD
1.0,What a piece of crap
1.0,"Cute, but very low quality. Fell apart within first 2 weeks of normal wearing."
1.0,Extremely too big! They are made for an elephant ear.
1.0,The chest part is very narrow and the waist pouches out in a very unflattering way.
1.0,-No blood splats.. :(<br />-unexpected hole placed underneath right side chest.<br />-Don’t know what is the use for tiny amount of red ashes that comes with paint brush?
1.0,"Aprons was to small, didn't meet my expectations.this is my first review,in a long while.just because of this Item"
1.0,Runs really big..
1.0,Very cheap looking! Picture and model make it look deceivingly pretty when it's a piece of junk. I bought this on Ebay and it's exactly the same thing. Not worth 10c.
1.0,"This was bough to wear to a wedding and when it got here to my surprise it was folded and in a bag, it was so wrinkled that I had to take it and get it steamed it still has wrinkles. Not good!!!"
1.0,very fast shipping and delivery..the dress however looks like a cheap potato sack. dont buy. dont waste your money.
1.0,Tore on first day of use.. the pearls were loose and falling off
1.0,Unless you wear it under your arm pits you should just put it around you knees. That's where it's going to end up at by lunch time.<br />Constantly rolling over itself and won't hold shape.
1.0,Very bad design. Proportions are off
1.0,"Both antlers fell off twice while driving (rolled down the window partially to allow air in) and had to stop in the road, make a u-turn and pick them up. Installed on the passengers windows instead which seemed to fit better for a few days until I noticed why; the plastic was wedged under the rubber liner of the window and not actually on the window. I just got home and saw one of the antlers fell off somewhere on my drive back from an errand and now I am left with one antler and nose. My kids are so sad.  Wouldn't purchase again because despite how cute my van looked for the 4 days I had them, they were always a hassle. :-/"
1.0,These earrings made my ears all red and swollen after wearing for a few hours.
1.0,I bought 2 pairs of pants from this company and both times the zippers on all the pockets broke.
1.0,"Poor quality- strings hanging off of dress. See thru, tissue paper thin. Knew it would run small so ordered two sizes up. Well I should have ordered 10 sizes up. Ridiculous!  Not at all like the pictures. Very disappointed!!!"
1.0,This is not worth your money
1.0,"Purchased a 2XL for my son, and it barely fits as a medium. Don't waste your money, unless you're smaller sized."
1.0,"These razorback shirts are NOT compression shirts, at all. The only reason I am giving this one star is for the delivery time.<br />The quality of these shirts are not great. I am very disappointed. I should not have to go to the trouble of returning items that I thought was true to the description."
1.0,Sizing is WAAAY OFF! I'm usually a 12 to 14 so I bought the XXL. It was soooooooo tiny! It fit like it was a MEDIUM! I guess the folks in China making it are basing their sizing off of tiny Asian women. So ridiculous. I couldn't get it in the return package quick enough. I'm pretty much not going to buy ANY clothes online.
1.0,Broke too easily.
1.0,Mine came apart after just three or four uses
1.0,Such poor quality and the rubber looks completely worn out after short walks.  Our son is 1+ and I will have to say these are great for slip on and off but wearing around outdoors these will look like a pair of adult worn shoes that were worn for 1 year!  Please look elsewhere
1.0,This dress is HORRIBLE!! It was not made as pictured and fit terrible. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!
1.0,"Horrible necklace. Looks like halloween costume jewelry vs casual everyday. Looks cheap and feels very cheap and plastic like. I get that it’s cheap from the beginning, but that is horrible"

1.0,Pieces of crap just a piece of foil<br />DON'T BUY VERY EASY TO BEND WITH OUT any effort
1.0,"first item came defective - very low quality plastic bladder that leaked a lot of air along the plastic seam.<br /><br />in addition, the flag does not stand up straight like in the picture.<br /><br />lastly, there are no instructions on how to rig up the clips and string, and i cannot figure it out even after the seller sent a thirds party youtube link of a different float setup altogether."
1.0,"Top doesn't fit.  My boobs did not fit at all, I got a small and it was still to big.  They were swimming in the cups"
1.0,"These glass had great potential. However, the fit was all wrong and I had to send them back. They were too tight at temples and too loose on the nose. The glasses extend way too far past my ears and would slip down easily.<br />For me it was not a good match."
1.0,They hang at weird angles. Some look more like Easter eggs
1.0,I going to give one star just cause I got the blazer on time but all the buttons were off in the bag and Brocken this was very cheap. 🙁
1.0,It’s made of hard rubber. Not comfortable
1.0,"Waaaay too large! Order a size smaller. Now I'm stuck with 3 shirts that are useless. I really liked the brand, however I'm thinking I'm going to buy clothes from a different vendor."
1.0,"I ordered this weeks ago for my daughter and new grandson for Mother's Day.  It arrived late and without the onsie!  I am very disappointed! And again, THERE WAS NO ONSIE INCLUDED!  I am beginning to wonder if paying for Prime is even worth it."

1.0,"Cheap material, very little filling.  Definitely not an XL.  Returning ASAP!"
1.0,"My son bought this for my birthday present. It looked fairly nice, cheap looking but ok. After only two days off wearing the necklace it broke in two. I would not recommend this to anyone! Even if it is cheap. You will be wasting your money!"
1.0,Horrible customer support from this company....Gi's are just ok in quality.
1.0,"For the price, the dress is gorgeous. HOWEVER, it is very cheaply; made don’t expect to wear it more than twice. Also, I will NEVER buy from this seller again. This dress has definitely been worn before as it smells STRONGLY of body odor and there’s a small tear in the lace where it attaches the the yoke."
1.0,"Wasn’t too satisfied with the bag, really sagged and I didn’t put a lot of stuff in it!"
1.0,I love this bracelet and door it no doubt however I wore it for 2 days and it broke
1.0,Very cheap and doesn't hold.
1.0,This dress was just cutton no Spandex whatsoever it was too small will be returning
1.0,Material is very thin.  Design is nice but looks like might wash out after a few washings.  Going to put it in a frame with picture of baby.  This is not practical for using as intended.
1.0,"I ordered this expecting to use it for a photo shoot for my newborn, all the feathers were damaged and it looked nothing like the photo. Disappointed."

1.0,it broke within a month.
1.0,Bad purchase
1.0,My daughter wore these around the house to get her used to wearing flip flops and within an hour they broke! Please save your money and avoid!!!! 1 star because they are adorable.

1.0,The frames cracked within the first 60 days.
1.0,"Cheap junk, all scratched up and took 2 months to be delivered."
1.0,"Not sturdy enough, maybe ok for kids but not adults"
1.0,"2 tight on my arm. Wore 1 2 x. Full of runners, like pantyhose. Sucks I bought 3 pairs"
1.0,These earrings are flat shaped pearls and very dull.  The picture makes them look round because of the angle but they are actually flat on the back. ugly and cheap.The positive product reviews are all from people who received them for free to review.
1.0,Upon receiving package noticed it was missing few pieces due to package being received open
1.0,A XXL fit like a large.5
1.0,"I think I have all ready reviewed this item.  It was a really gross misrepresentation of the photo on Amazon.  I did return it, and got a refund."
1.0,"Fits strangely, doesn’t hit curves correctly"
1.0,I returned this swim suit.....it was a odd fit.
1.0,Cute purse Pom Pom! I like the roses it ads a cute touch and it matches my new LV bag. BUT after barely having this the flowers are peeling and one fell off:(
1.0,I wear L/XL but after reading reviews chose to order an XXL. It was not even close. The shirt was actually more a Medium size and did not fit. The shirt also has no give to it and is not “loose” as it was described. I am returning it. Very disappointed. One star for quick shipping.
1.0,"Barely covered anything, Sizing way off. I'm 32 b and weigh 115."
1.0,The quality of the product is not good. I used these for less than 6 months and 1 of the straps broke.<br />Hope they can replace it for me.
1.0,This item shrunk 3 inches in length. The waist is so high it looks ridiculous on. I am so sad 😞. I washed it in cold water and hung it to dry.
1.0,Elastic is completely worn and wavy. This is totally unacceptable for brand new ANYTHING.
1.0,The strap did NOT fit my daughter's Nano glasses.  It was too big to go through the opening of the glasses.
1.0,Very upset. I bought this swimsuit for my daughter for our family vacation. We get ready to go swimming and I go to put this on my daughter and the zipper breaks. Good thing I had packed an extra swimsuit for her or vacation would have been ruined.
1.0,"They simply don't stay on pants, clip keeps falling off."
1.0,"This beanie does not have enough material to be called slouchy and it has a peculiar way of standing up on your head when you put it on. I thought maybe it was just my small head that was the problem. I bought 1 as a gift and 1 for myself and we both pitched them, so it wasn't my head causing the poor fit. Don't waste your money."
1.0,Got a size 11 for a shoe size of 8.5. They were so tight they couldnt fit past the heel of my husband's foot.
1.0,"the size was too small for the average or larger face. the thickness was good and no complaints there, but the noseguard location was a bit too low for the mask to fit right."
1.0,Came a month late and it was a ten pack when I ordered 50.
1.0,"Bought this because we were having trouble finding an orange dress for our 7 year-old. Wish I had saved my money!!! Whomever sewn this needs to find another job. There was two separate seams where they completely missed the material and left gapping holes. That alone is bad enough; however, there are uneven seams all over, the neck line is all messed up, and worst of all it apparently has mold in two separate places!"
1.0,"...because it looked like a five year old cut and sewed it...literally no saving it and I have a sewing machine. Everything was crooked and CUT crooked, not just sewn poorly. Please don't waste your money."
1.0,These earrings and the star in particular are much smaller than what the picture looks like and seem much more feminine in real life.  I gave them to my wife.
1.0,"I like that the package came early. BUT I can’t use these bracelets. Majority of the bracelets are tarnished already and or fading. Also, these are on the smaller size."
1.0,One of the earrings was broken when they came to me. Because they were so inexpensive I didn’t want to pay to ship it back. I may try to glue the pieces together. But super bummed cus they are gorgeous.
1.0,These are HORRIBLE. Don't waste your money. The straps bulge out away from your foot and look ridiculous!
1.0,The worst masks I ever bought. I spent almost five on the same day. They broke so easily
1.0,Very cheap quality for the money! One came in with a hole in it!
1.0,Looked like a dolls dress when I opened it. Didn't even come close to being a regular size let alone a plus and it had this tight uncomfortable elastic band where it did not need to be. It is too bad as cute style.
1.0,The clip to necklace is seales
1.0,Just no.  No.  Please no<br />Thanks
1.0,"This is very misleading to show a mask on a kid or say ""kid"" in the product title for this particular mask. Unless they mean ""adult-sized"" children, no kid will fit these."
1.0,Terrible quality. Returned item. Don’t waste your money
1.0,"Tried to put on, the size was not even close, way to small. Fits my  small children."
1.0,"These earrings look black to me! I really needed them to be purple to go with a dress I'm looking forward to wearing. Returning them is out of the question. I don't have a UPS store close to me, and a pickup costs $11!"
1.0,They were not round toed so narrow and didn't like
1.0,"not good, waste of money"
1.0,"I ordered 2, one arrived broken."
1.0,It simply fell apart before I could put it on.  I had bought it to wear to a special graduation.  Luckily I had a backup.  Didn't return it because I liked it and had thrown away the box and everything elae
1.0,It doesent look anything like in the photo its more as pj's.dont waste ur money
1.0,"i purchased these for my cartilage. they look slightly cheaper in person than i was expecting. ever since i put one of them in, my ear has been infected due to the cheap metal. i ended up throwing them away and wasting my money. i suggest buying quality items when dealing with piercings."
1.0,Needed to return item as it did not fit properly. It did not fit according to written description or how it appeared in image. Not happy with product!
1.0,Underneath attached shirt is way too big and attached sweater part is way to small.
1.0,The material is cheap. Very off-putting. This looks more like a bicycle jersey.
1.0,"The size is smaller than it should be. The band is thick. The designs are not as detailed, theyblook like blobs of metal. (ZOOM IN) on my pictures and you will see the blobs and no defined design on wolves or vine."
1.0,"My girls have been wearing these for a few days now, a new one each day. Sure enough, every single day the masks have broken mid-day, leaving them to find alternatives in school. The glue is very weak and isn’t lasting even a day, the straps snap right off of the mask! We all wear disposable masks and have never run into this issue before. Don’t waste your money."
1.0,Had the shoes about 3 months and the bottom sole is already coming apart.
1.0,"At the time of purchase, nowhere on this page did it say that the black sunglasses with rhinestones on the edges were child size! So imagine my surprise when I opened the package to see small, flimsy little sunglasses! Super disappointed with this misleading listing. The seller needs to update the item info to accurately describe the sunglasses."
1.0,the chips don't heat up in your closed hand. i have an authentic chip and it heats up when i hold it.
1.0,Ordered the red but the suspenders were almost a burgundy color.  The bow tie clasp doesn't stay closed.  Cheap construction.  I re- ordered some that were a little more exspensive and they're perfect.  Save yourself the trouble and order better quality to start with.
1.0,"My husband and I both tired to attach this to my Fitbit Versa several times, and after comparing it to other compatible bands, it is noticeably different and will not fit. Waste of $."
1.0,"material used is garbage!!  ripped along cargo pocket and completely up and down leg, the first day wearing them!  Do not waste your money!!!"
1.0,I like how the dress fits very comfy for hanging around the house. The problem came after 2 or 3 washings. It’s a navy dress that now has white looking pills all over it
1.0,"The LED stayed lighted too short a time easily to read, and, for an undetermined reason, it seemed slow by an hour or two, or fast by ten or eleven hours, within less than two days."
1.0,This was suppose to be a birthday present for my Granddaughter but the one outfits was too small and the other had a stain on the front of the shirt. It was really  a big difference in the sizes.  I am very upset about this and have never had this happen before thru Amazon. I don't have time to send the outfits back and now I am left with no present for her to open . VERY DISAPPOINTED !!!!!
1.0,Dollar store quality<br />Update 11/27/18<br />I have received 6 emails from this seller and have asked for it to stop and still get emails.
1.0,Washed once and the graphics melted off the shirt.
1.0,Dress is horribly made and you have to pay for your return shipping.
1.0,Stiff material and oversized. The quality was horrible and the size was off by at least 3 times over.
1.0,too cheap take a piece of paper and sew it together?
1.0,"Too small for adult, too depressing for a child. We bought this for a yard boy (mannequin) and even that may be asking too much. We can fix it with creative lighting, right? At least the grimace part is right, you’ll grimace if you buy it."
1.0,It was lose on me and see through. I usually wear a medium I am 140 lbs abs 5”4”. It was baggy on my body and the pants were showing my underwear. I immediately returned this item.
1.0,"I am a size 1x. Ordered a 4x just to be absolutely safe (reviews say runs small).  It is SKIN TIGHT.  NOT TEE SHIRT MATEEIAL, but shiney stretchy material and the red is NOT red but a maroon color, not like the American flag.  Very cheap and disappointing.  Now nothing to wear for July Fourth."
1.0,No sirve 😡😡😡
1.0,"Liked this very much at first, but I have had this item exactly 2 weeks and  the  zipper has separated and no longer functions .  I would not recommend this product."
1.0,I bought a cup size bigger based on reviews and it is still about 2 cups sizes too small...I've worn the same size for 20 years so this is aggravating.
1.0,The heal collapsed when I put the shoe on. Way too narrow. I can't wear them. I hate to give a bad review but these shoes deserve one.
1.0,I returned it. The fabric was a bit stiff and the arm wholes were too big for me
1.0,"Add instructions, I shouldn’t have to look up on YouTube to see how to use your product. I will be contacting Amazon for my money back."
1.0,No like berry bad scrash everything
1.0,what happened about getting what you ordered.  I ordered one with a zipper....<br />going back
1.0,"I actually bought 2, a brown one and a navy blue one, after wearing the blue one for 4 hours the first day the fake leather peeled off( see photo)<br />I should have returned it,  because I am not very happy, but just thought It would be replaced with another one and it do the same thing. It was very embarrassing, had no idea it was a photo type fake leather.......go figure, made in China"
1.0,"I ordered my normal size but this was a very short Waist pant that although purporting to be high wasted sat well below the waist, but not low enough for hips.  So they rolled when you tried to walk even.  The legs were long enough and I am 5’6”.  But the waist was so odd and the fit was not comfortable.  They did not feel tight, just short."
1.0,Wand arrived broken in half and the tiara was so small my daughter could not even put it on her head. Very disappointed!
1.0,The sleeves are really short and the material is really cheap and it runs small.
1.0,"thin fabric, i'm usually a medium i got a large fits like s/m. i don't recommend"
1.0,The material is awful.
1.0,Not what they used to be. Won’t be reordering these. They have changed something and a very uncomfortable to wear. Legs are shorter than they used to be which makes for a very uncomfortable fit. So time to find a better underwear brand
1.0,The strap fit perfect just the button to keep band in place would not stay within the band very annoying
1.0,"I haven't had this belt 3 weeks and the ""skin"" of the belt is pealing of horribly! Won't buy this again!"
1.0,Ordered XL & got XXL<br />Very long & sheer<br />Would make a great swimsuit cover up<br />OR a comfortable night gown
1.0,Shrunk after 1 wash :(
1.0,"too Bad the dress is gorgeous but the sizing is so wrong. The waist is ok, chest is ok, but the arm hole was cut too small that it’s way high up and so weird. Returning. And I ordered pink, but I received orange pink.<br />I usually wear size 8-10 for lady size. But since this seemed like more like junior design I ordered L size which is supposed to be size 14, and still tight and weird size pattern."
1.0,I’m 5’0 and weighs 115 ordered a small and they way to big in the front area sad cause besides that there cute thick material very nice material came pretty fast also.
1.0,The poster wrinkled and had creases all over due to the gloss. It's not possible to fix.
1.0,"Worst quality ever! Seems are frayed,  fabric is NOT even close to sweatshirt or t-shirt material.  Not labeled at all. No washing instructions or nothing telling what this fabric is made of.  Very dissatisfied and disappointed."
1.0,The smallest wings I have ever seen the wings the model has on are not the ones sent to me very deceiving  I wish they would be truthful about what we are buying the ones that was sent to me wont even fit on a mannequin they have to be a child's size which isn't mentioned in the ad the wings on the ad are bigger than the model such a sham
1.0,Chain broke immediately
1.0,maybe i recieved the wrong legging the faux is all over the front not on side as i expected......will not spend extra to send back as they were less than 10.00...will be donating them
1.0,"Bleh! does not look like this, not what you want I promise."
1.0,"material is too thin, so see through on the top. there is one more layer on bottom, so it is ok.<br />the size wise, I ordered medium size as usual that is too tight for me. I am disappointed by the quality of the dress, it looked like a one time of costume dress than a real dress. as the pictures, there are loose thread everywhere."
1.0,"Cheap, flimsy and really small, I would not recommend this to anyone. I wouldnt' even pay a $1 for it."
1.0,"Does not look like the image online. Solid gray, no variation in color of 'fur'.  Looks and feels cheap.  I will be returning this. Does not say Chic&Cozy brand anywhere. HatButik is the brand name on the tag for the item I received."
1.0,Stiff and scratchy fabric
1.0,"Material, hard to move my arms the elastic is too tight."
1.0,"Cheap! Cheap! Cheap!....... Don't buy dresses from this site... I'm extremely disappointed and you will be too. I'm a small frame woman and short: this dress fits like a zip-lock bag made into a tee- shirt. I even ordered twice my size. The picture is deceptive to say the least!  Save your money, time and temper."
1.0,Flimsy material and the shirt was way too big for the small size that I ordered.
1.0,Did not Like the material and the<br />Colors were not as vibrant as the picture made Them appear.
1.0,1st pair came tarnished - ordered a replacement and the 2nd pair came tarnished as well. Then i was charged for the 2nd pair because i didn’t send the first ones back. Not worth driving to the post office to return cheap $10 earrings. Entire backside of all 4 clasps were basically black and nothing like the picture.
1.0,This was a Christmas for my granddaughter and very disappointed! It was a nice color but it doesn’t fit right! Zipper is on shoulder with opening to hood also on shoulder!
1.0,Not as big as I was expecting
1.0,"These are the tiniest earrings that I have ever seen, only a newborn baby could wear them they are so small. I haven't even taken them out of the little ziplock baggie the were sent in."
1.0,It doesn't look like the picture. Cheap quality and smell bad. The back has white lines has can't be removed. Not worth the price at all.
1.0,Item worked poorly. Returned.
1.0,"I'd give this zero stars if I could. It looks nothing like the pictures. The colors are insanely bright and the pattern is not cute at all. Wish I could return, but the return policy is ridiculous."
1.0,Fit tight
1.0,"Worked fine the first time. The second time I use them, one of the clamps came loose."
1.0,They balled up after one washing.
1.0,The color is gorgeous but the sizing it way off. Irdered a 2X but it fits my medium wearing niece.
1.0,I returned this horror for a refund. What I received looked nothing like the photos. The dress was an utter disaster.
1.0,Bulky and small. Not wearable. Huge led lump in mask over mouth: didn’t work at all. Size is far too small for someone to wear and wouldn’t cover nose because of bulky led bit that weighed it down. Just looked ridiculous. Led didn’t work at all. Complete waste of money. Seller is dishonest and scams you. Will not let you return.
1.0,Last not even a week
1.0,The dress pictured is not the dress that showed up
1.0,Clasp Broke the 1st day
1.0,"I'm 5'11, 160lbs, althetic frame with a muscular lower body. I deadlift, squat, etc. often<br />1. These are not high waisted. They sat right on my hip bones and then slid down. I kept having to pull these up! When I pulled them up, I had a very unflattering camel toe.<br />2. These are not ankle length, they are calf-length!<br />3. The fabric is cheap. I felt like I was going to pull a spongebob & rip my pants every time I squatted.<br /><br />Overall, extremely disappointed"
1.0,Just received a Chamberlain garage door opener for Christmas. It only came with one opener.  I researched the product determined this was the proper product for my opener. When I received the pair of openers neither one worked. Contacted Amazon and was told I could not return because they are hazardous(?). So now I'm stuck with 2 non functioning openers and no help from either Chamberlain or Amazon. Buyer Beware!
1.0,Did not attach as described
1.0,"I ordered this for golf season in NJ<br />So in all fairness it sat, CLOSED, for a few months.<br />I was able to stamp 15ish balls before it turned to poo.<br />The stamp WAS great, exactly what I wanted.<br />Very dissatisfied with how long it lasted. (insert joke here) but really, I will never order this product again."
1.0,turned green and my finger back after two wearings
1.0,Could have bought from Chinese seller for third the price ....size is total bs terrible product
1.0,"This dress is very cheaply made, the fabric is very cheap.  This dress is fine for lounging around the house, but I wouldn’t wear it in public.  And the bottom of the dress and the sleeve holes do not have a proper hem!!  It will not survive more than 1-2 rounds in the washing machine."
1.0,Web was much lighter than picture<br />Crew socks was almost ankle socks<br />Cheaply made
1.0,"After 7 days the stitching is coming undone, cheap. Buyer beware."
1.0,There’s only one earring in this box. The description says earrings plural! I didn’t read closely enough. I bought to wear to a holiday party and could only wear one.  Super disappointing.
1.0,I didn’t even try on this dress due to the hole in the shoulder but I could see and feel how cheap the dress was and very thin material.
1.0,They took a small bra and just added girth and cup without adjusting for cup placement.  Everything 'fits' but the cups are so close it gives you 'uniboob'.  Very unflattering and uncomfortable.  I can't believe I wasted $30 on this.
1.0,Very cheap and very very small.
1.0,There was only the advertising picture to like. This hat is so poorly made that the clip would neither hold to the headband or the head. It fell apart. The hat LOOKS excellent but that is as far as it goes. Do not try to wear it. Put it in a hat shop window.
