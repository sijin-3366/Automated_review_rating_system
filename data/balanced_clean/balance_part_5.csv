2.0,Thinner than expected. Tight around the arms
2.0,Arrived with a hole in the shoulder seam
2.0,One shoe actually shrunk from the heat 😳
2.0,It looks pretty..... but mine fell apart when it's worn the  3rd time
2.0,Love the fit and style however the pattern was very different from what I saw in the picture. I understand it won't be the exact same but I expected the same pattern at the very least.
2.0,"The material was flimsy and shapeless, and the proportions of the dress were off (large bust, too small waist). I would not purchase this item again."
2.0,"The watch band runs large and no tools or instructions are sent with watch to take some links out.  Took it to a jewelry store, they took out as many links as possible and it's still a little big."
2.0,Hardly any arch support
2.0,"Very little support, bra pads fell out in washing machine."
2.0,"This shirt is very see through. It is made of fabric similar to thermals. It is not soft- it is a bit rough upon arrival. The shoulder straps hang by the neck and not at the bra strap line. So if you're looking to hide those bra straps this isn't going to work even with cross straps. When I tried it on, the peek-a-boo shoulder hem doesn't lay flat against the skin, it bulges out into a U/cup shape(see photo). The bulges happen for both shoulders and both the front and back of the armpits. Kind of like you're waiting for someone to tickle you lol. The arms are very long and went past my finger tips. The body panel fit up top even though I'm super busty but was very tight around the waist. I think it wasn't a good pattern or the cut is off proportionately. I am 5' 5&#34; and usually a 12/14 for reference. I purchase a size 2XL. The length is perfect for wearing with legging which is what I was hoping to do but I am returning it because it wasn't love with all the misshapen parts."
2.0,"I think this just might be the single most unflattering and uncomfortable thing I've ever put on my body.<br /><br />I'm 5'4"", 220lbs, 40DD and generally wear a size 16 dress. I ordered this in my usual size, and it hung off my body like an ugly sheath dress. And I'm even 32 weeks pregnant currently! The fabric is awful; it's so noisy and stiff and does not have any stretch or give whatsoever... but it also doesn't hug your curves or leave you with any semblance of a flattering figure. It doesn't matter how you tie up the front, it just hangs there and doesn't cinch in the waist at all. The sleeves were comically large. I put this dress on, took one look in the mirror and immediately took it off.<br /><br />No. Just... no."
2.0,"Loved them, but I'm down to 1 they are on very thin material.  Easy to break"
2.0,Not large. Way too small
2.0,Runs very small. Missing the black tie bow.
2.0,Very disappointed. I thought it was a sweater dress and it's not. It's a shiney spandex like material and the busy and sleeves are very tight. So if you have any kind of chest the material stretches and turns the navy white. The pattern is still very cute so it will be going to my daughter.
2.0,color is different from the pick and looks cheap
2.0,Did not fit my 8 year old. Too big. Should not be listed for girls as they fit Women’s sizes. Cute otherwise.
2.0,Very cute but was only able to use mine twice before the chain snapped.
2.0,Not deep enough for head. Feels as if it can easily flop off. Donated it.
2.0,The bag does not seem to be of the best quality ..which was not too bad..but the colour is off..it is more of a orangy reddish pink..Very colour..
2.0,Disappointed. These cuffs were not evenly sized. One cuff was both longer and looser than the other on at least 2 of the pairs. Also loose in general. Faux fur looked ok but ugly gray elastic in all of them so it doesn't blend in with the color of the cuff.
2.0,I usually wear M took a XL it fits . Its doesn't really do much as far as tucking.  It's more like a thick swimsuit material . You get what you payed for . Will bot had bough if i tried it at a store
2.0,The metal buckle brakes after 20 wears... on out third belt
2.0,The outer road ring broke the first time I tried to put watch in the case!
2.0,Weird fit on these shoes...... and I love UGGs. I sent them back.
2.0,The gloves are not warm ar all. Might as well not wear gloves at all. Should be sold just for looks.
2.0,"It is too short for tall people… it fits perfectly but too short, it finished just in my back part."
2.0,"The over swimsuit is cute and the material feel like any other swim suit material. but for people with bigger boobs that need some support it's not really good unless you tie the strings super tight to hold them up. And the bottoms come below the belly button and are bunchy in the crotch and the butt, NO GO. These companies need to do better with the sizing because i even measured my self to see exactly where i am and then the bathing suit was still off!"
2.0,"I was so very disappointed in the spelling of ""taking "" otherwise a nice, soft t-shirt. Zoom in on picture,  I didn't notice it before I ordered it."
2.0,"The tie was thinner than the specifications stated and is too thin to be worn as a corporate tie.  If it were thicker as stated, it would be nice."
2.0,Very uncomfortable to wear. Creates a lot of pressure on the top center of my forehead. Sucked
2.0,"Fits skin tight, not like photo. Bunches up around my neck,  Don't buy this based on the photo.  If you do buy it, it will work."
2.0,"Second time buying this dress from Wellwits. The first (grey) was too tight for its alleged sizing, with no stretch. Had to return. The second (light blue/mint color) came with one button buttoned, and all the other button holes still shut, lots of loose threads, and thin, crumpled material. I'm honestly shocked, as my daily, go-to dress also comes from this seller, Welwits, and it looks like this dress is made by an entirely different organization. NONE of these variations are even near worth the price we paid for this dress. Ick"
2.0,Some of the seams are not straight.  I wish I would have inspected the dress carefully before it was too late to return them.
2.0,"They fit well and are ok.  The problem is that the fleur-de-lis do not look like fleur-de-lis.  They look like some kind of cross thing.  No one is going to see them and think ""fleur de lis""."
2.0,You can not wash these or they will have holes in them. Other than they are cute and kind of itchy.
2.0,Not true to size. They are wide and to big on my son.
2.0,I have ordered this item twice where I ordered a smaller size than the first. The bottoms do not have elastic around the leg openings and makes them too big. Luckily I can sew and will have to fix it myself. I should mention that this is not a licensed Bluey product and is a knockoff.
2.0,Shrank so much on the first wash that I never got to wear it :-(
2.0,"It was absolutely tiny, I got the largest size and it wouldn’t go past my thighs. I’m a size 16 and it wouldn’t fit my size 12 roommate either."
2.0,Funky more of a shower shoe than a slipper
2.0,The top fit great but the bottoms are very small. Quality isn't all that great either.
2.0,I normally wear large or xl. I ordered large and it did not fit. It more like a small size.
2.0,Sorry they were to thick.  I expected them to be a little thinner .
2.0,Product fabric very light. First inspection. Not a square bottom. It’s flat so packing  certain items won’t work well
2.0,"Much smaller than expected.  I wanted them for myself, but will gift to my young niece.  They are pretty though!"
2.0,"These were not for my, they were for my son but he said that they the bridge on the goggles hurts him and he really doesn't wear them. They are his &#34;extra&#34; ones if he ever forgets his Speedo goggles now."
2.0,This is more for a toddler than a child. I ordered for a 6 yr old to small.
2.0,Material felt good. Incredibly small. I wear an 11 shoe and my girlfriend wears a women's 7.5. These socks fit her perfectly. Not sure what they were thinking...These are certainly not Large socks.
2.0,Very cute earrings.  However they are not pure silver.  The coating has faded and they are not as pretty.  Wish they were solid 925 Sterling silver!!
2.0,"Disappointed, post is very long and bent. The design could be really nice if not for being so thick and blingy. They look like they came from a gumball machine, which is too bad because the design itself is really cute."
2.0,"I just got this jacket today. It fits well. It’s stretchy, flattering, and the color is right. But, when I pulled it out it had a horrible chemical smell, and like some other reviewers mentioned, the buttons literally jingle loudly when you put it on or move around in it and they look cheap.  For the annoying jingling alone, I’m going to return this. It indicates that it is very cheaply made, and the smell doesn’t help. I’ll pay a few dollars more for something that doesn’t sound like a Christmas ornament."
2.0,After three days the band started snagging on everything it crossed paths with and after one week one of the links broke. Also if worn too long it leave green stains on you skin. It’s a really pretty blingy band that compliments my ring but I’m very disappointed of the little time I was able to wear
2.0,"The bead on the drawstring fell off before the first time I even wore this. Took it on vacation, just poor quality and I don't expect it to last more than this one trip."
2.0,"Even though this is really cute, it is HUGE!!. So disappointed that I will not be able to use it for the occasion. Size down!!"
2.0,Buyer beware!!  The shirts are EXTREMELY small and then you have to have pay 1/3 of the cost to ship it back.
2.0,While it fit around me the cups are so small they might fit a B-C  cup at most. Which is a shame as otherwise it is rather well made. I noted that the metal piece turns sideways and the fabric bunches when pulled tight. For the price I might try to add fabric to the cups. I ended u gving it to my neighbor because it fit her perfect. She is a size 12. 5X my foot.
2.0,"Honestly, nothing is good about this product: too small, not good made, fabric is bad<br />Returning"
2.0,This is NOT a sweatsuit. It is a thin outfit. Ran too small had to give it away.
2.0,"I like these for running on the trails as they are comfortable and light with good colors, but I've found them to be unusually slick when running on some types of wet surfaces. For example, when walking on a wet wooden boardwalk I was sliding all over the place while my running buddy had a pair of Brooks Pure Grit 5s and her footing was normal. Twice now the shoes have lost traction after being exposed to a slight amount of moisture and I've taken a tumble; and each time my sense was that I couldn't justify the lack of traction. On a recent vacation I had to switch from hiking with these shoes to hiking with my normal Brooks PureFlow running shoes as the PureGrit shoes just couldn't handle any moisture. I'm going to shop for a new pair of trailing running shoes given the unfortunate experiences I've had with these shoes."
2.0,The lenses were too wide for my face and the glasses seemed cheep.
2.0,Bracelet is very small. Purchased as a gift for a child but not sure it will even fit.
2.0,So this thing took foreverrrrrrrrrr to arrive. Not too fond of the fabric and there aren't any pockets like the pictures show. Ordered the same style dress from other sellers and was very pleased with those.  Don't feel like wasting the energy to send it back so I guess I'll just use it to bum around the house or as a nightgown.
2.0,The color was different than depicted; I will be returning this.
2.0,"I love the length of this of this body chain, but it broke the first time that I wore it. Although I have tried several times, I can't fix it."
2.0,"Size is smaller than advertised.  Purchased for womens size 9, fits my wife's size 5 foot."
2.0,This shirt must run really small. Be careful and order one size bigger than you would normally. Its a shame!
2.0,Drop them one time and their done.
2.0,"These capris are nice for the first ten minutes, then they start slipping down and I have to keep tugging them up. It's a somewhat cheap material, and my gray pair got a hole in the inner thigh with the first wear. They're good for work but that's it."
2.0,I decide to rinse with water...as I dried lenses with microfiber cloth the  film started to peel...
2.0,"Didn't fit as expected. Looks different than picture, more like a sneaker than a hiking boot."
2.0,I ordered this product XS and it is big.
2.0,Thin vinyl
2.0,"I returned this top immediately. I am a 34 C, and the fit (S-M) was fine, however I disliked the material. It didn’t have any stretch and it just looked and felt cheap."
2.0,Boots are to big
2.0,"I was really excited to find this wristband because of the strap which fastens like a watch. The normal one fell apart for me so I thought this would be better. This one didn't unfasten (the only reason I gave 2 stars), but it is made of a poor quality rubber which allowed my UP to fall or fly out of my wristband, something I didn't have a problem with before. It made it impossible to wear at work because I almost lost it so many times. I would not recommend this product to anyone who actually intends to keep their UP."
2.0,This jacket is very thin the train is so sheer doesn't look as pictured. It's a cute jacket but definitely for 70+ degrees maybe even summer night
2.0,Good until they broke. Not very durable
2.0,They say online athletic workout shorts I just received them They are swim shorts this is false advertising
2.0,I expected it to not look as cheap.
2.0,"Look great, just break easy"
2.0,Super cheap see through fabric. I ordered the blue in the xl and got the black. In the process of returning so we will see how this goes. I normally wear a medium and the xl is still too small.
2.0,I disliked the fabric a lot.  Fit is fine.
2.0,"The soul is okay, but the material attached to the top of this slipper is cheap and loose so, if you walk with any speed, your foot slips off the heal of the shoe. I use them to walk from my bedroom to my bathroom and I walk slowly. I will not purchase these again."
2.0,"Love them, but  they get old and pilly right away... would not buy them again. 😢"
2.0,The socks are nice but they were listed as plus size and they definitely are not wide calf
2.0,"They were the correct size, When reading they tend to break around the lenses. Maybe they push it in too much."
2.0,I ordered an XL and received a small. Not at all pleased because I ordered it for a friend. She has a large bust so we will have to see if it will fit there. I live in Trinidad so returning for the proper size is not an option so if it doesn't fit it's a waste. Otherwise the top's colour is nice and vibrant and for a small it looks true to size. I have a low rating because I triple checked my size and still got the wrong size sent. If it doesn't fit her it's a waste of money.
2.0,I wish to return.....I am a day late on the button! Please approve the return on both dresses......
2.0,"I am a contact lens wearer who has recently started wearing her prescription glasses more. I have bought the sunglasses that go over your glasses. I find them to big and make me look like a bug. So, I decided to buy these clip-ons. They are very fragile and you have to be patient and handle with care when you use them. Also, don't forget to put them back into the protective case when your done wearing them. Another big production that takes too much time and effort!!! I do like the way they look on top of my glasses and the lightness of the product. I also find the lens gets dirty and it's hard to see. So, I guess I'm back to square one with my bug eyes, ugh...."
2.0,"The picture of the product made it look shiny and golden. The actual badge came tarnished and dull. I still used it because I was going to a costume party (husband was the ""sheriff"" - I was the Deputy), and needed the badge, but would not recommend this one."
2.0,Its okay but sparkly
2.0,"Absolutely beautiful and I loved them for three days. Then a stone fell out while I was wearing them out to dinner. I got them on Prime Day for $12.99 and can't even replace them for the same price now. We had a good run, the earrings and I. But they're going back for a refund and I'm on the hunt for the rose gold and morganite look again."
2.0,"These are very warm and comfortable.  I ordered the same size as the shoes I wear and the fit was good.  Slightly tight at first, which I think is good for a slipper, but it loosened up after wearing them on the first day.  I bought these to replace my Minnetonka shearling slippers and I prefer these by far, much warmer and better coverage especially when I flip the cuff up.<br /><br />I have no need to replace these, but was happy to see the write up included with the slippers that included details on how to replace them if needed.  It felt like they really cared about the product.<br /><br />I would buy these again if I had a need to do so.  4/5 stars, I only give 5 stars if a products exceeds my expectations and proves durability over time.  I've only had these a week so I can't speak to durability yet, though I have no reason to believe that they won't last.  Even if they only last a year I would buy them again.<br /><br />EDIT:  I have now had these for about 3-4 months and have to change my review.  When I first got these they were great, very soft and warm.  They stayed that way for about a month, then they were pretty good for a couple months, and now they aren't really doing the job anymore.  The wool seems to be breaking mid shaft and I have noticed that a lot of it simply was never attached and came out when I took them off.  Feeling the inside of them I can tell that the wool is getting pretty matted and there are even bare spots on the sole.  I like how much of the foot these cover  and at first they were great but these just didn't last nearly long enough to have been worth the money.  I won't purchase these again."
2.0,2 parts of this broke within 10 minutes of giving it to my 9 year old
2.0,"I bought a medium, my size is medium, this dress wouldn’t pass my breast, if you have small breast it will probably fits you!"
2.0,"Missing the Nike logo, so unless you don’t mind it looking funny you need to buy a screen print Nike logo. Shirt is fair quality overall, but again, looks funky."
2.0,I love the necklace especially being a turtle and green ! It was pretty big size !<br />With in two days the necklace broke on me 👎
2.0,"These were cute. Fit as expected. Unfortunately, the threading was lose and it was smeared black as if the ink bled."
2.0,Can I say cheep!Find something else.
2.0,"The bracelet was indeed wonderful looking....however, I soon discovered the animal heads were not stainless steel as the listing claimed....the the band of the the bracelet did appear to be made of stainless steel, but again, not the decorative animal ,or &#34;Dragon&#34; heads as stated I expected the entire bracelet to be %100 steel....I will keep looking for one elsewhere.....this one was returned immediately."
2.0,Ring is beautiful but gets bent so easily. I bumped my hand on the fridge and it bent out of shape. Maybe just built a little to delicate. I’ve had it on about an hour because I received it today
2.0,"This was odd fitting, it wasn't small but it almost wasn't long enough. A cheap material, not worth the money."
2.0,Not as long as pictures. It took forever to arrive bc it came from China. I took a chance bc it wasn't super pricey. I wouldn't order again.
2.0,Too small. The feet were too long the calf part was too small. I ordered the largest size they had to fit my calves and the feet part was huge but the legs were too small didn’t fit 151/2 calves. I measured my calves when they were swollen 15 1/2 inches. Could not pull these up.  My friend loves them I gave her these and several other different manufacturers pairs that didn’t fit. I need a brand for short chunky people.
2.0,"Do not buy this if you are muscular or well-endowed. Getting the fit at the hips correct means that there is way too little allowance through the groin. Either a muscular butt or a substantial manhood will make this product very uncomfortable. Should you have both, congratulations, but you will never wear this happily."
2.0,fit nicely but did no really like itt
2.0,Earrings are nice but really big and heavy
2.0,"I have been looking for light weight athletic pants for a long time. I took a chance hoping that they would be similar to the cotton ones I've been wearing, but they are a polyester blend that doesn't breathe, and they are cut a little short and the legs are too wide at the bottom."
2.0,"The fabric feels pretty cheap. And the colors in the photograph appear heathered, but in person are very bright. I don't care for the pink. Returned."
2.0,Looks nice but runs very small<br />I will have to return it
2.0,"To small, seems cheaply made; but for the money I guess I should have expected it. Boone, Iowa"
2.0,"This bra was horrible.  The boning is not stiff enough, so the sides of the bra bow out, noticeably sticking out under your arms like wings!  In addition, the bra ran large and offered minimal support."
2.0,Caution when reading the sizing chart as the sizes of the delivered product are much smaller!  Ordered a medium based on measurements and the shirt was WAY TO SMALL.  Quality of the material is ok and appears that it would stand up to wear and tear.  I missed the return deadline as I was traveling internationally and was hoping to have this accompanying me.
2.0,No instructions on how to remove lenses and replace with other colored lenses and not break them.  Nice packaging though.
2.0,"While this dress is super cute it is paper thin (it's pretty much see through) and does not fit correctly. If you are bigger then a size 2 I'm not sure you will even get it over your chest. It was so tight on my arms at the top also. I do have thicker arms, but it was crazy how tight it was."
2.0,"Ordered 1 size up, that’s a 2 xl, NOT EVEN CLOSE, a xl tall in the Columbia Bahamian shirt, PERFECT 6’3” at 255 lbs, wouldn’t fit on any of my thinnest days in 30 years, 2 or 3 size up, who sizes this stuff ?"
2.0,They were too long!
2.0,The bottoms are too small
2.0,"Thin t~ Shirt dresses; ordered a 2x not long enough, thin material~using it as a shirt."
2.0,I bought this cute top to wear with my paper bag pants which I must say is a beautiful ensemble but it feels like cheap plastic. Not sure if it can be washed since it feels like it can break with a minor tug. This is really cute but poor quality material.
2.0,So very short!!!!!!!
2.0,Nothing what the picture and description states.  Very unhappy with this product.
2.0,I had many compliments when I wore these really cute capris however there is a lot of give around the waist very little elastic if any at all  so they were hard to keep up.
2.0,The item ripped the first time my daughter wore it. The ribbon isn’t sewed on very securely to the hem.
2.0,"Really pretty, lovely fabric but you could fit two of me in this. The arm cut outs came down to the bottom of my rib cage."
2.0,"The boxes are great! Well made, magnet works, cards are cute. The biggest issue…. I ordered a pack of 4 boxes for $35 ish dollars and they only sent me one box! I worked with Amazon to order the missing boxes and again, they only sent me one box! Amazon is now investigating the company. But seriously, I paid for 4, I should have received 4!"
2.0,"I actually purchased this to wear with leggings, but the hip area was way to small<br />(and I don’t have big hips) I tried to purchase another size, but couldn’t find them available."
2.0,Not the same as the other one I have. Same brand and color of the tag but not the same blue
2.0,"I am 5'3"", 116 lbs with a 25"" waist and 20.5"" thighs. I ordered a size medium for extra room in the legs since they are intended to fit loosely.  I felt choked at the waist with fabric, just too much of it. The drawstring was a faded gray/brown that didn't match the pant color. The hips had much extra fabric and the pockets were on the side of my thighs instead of on the front of the pants.  They looked too weird to keep. A small may have been better, but they had a boxy style that didn't flatter my figure."
2.0,"El modelo es muy lindo, emulando al reloj clásico Omega. Sin embargo, lo siento pesado en la muñeca y cuando fui a un relojero para sacarle un par de eslabones, pues me iba grande de muñeca, costó bastante porque el metal es una lata y se raya de nada."
2.0,It wasn’t true to size I had to give it to my daughter
2.0,Part of the ring started to rub off and now the line down the middle has a piece missing.
2.0,I thought the hoodie was made out of cotton because there really isn’t a lot said on it it looks different from the picture than it does or did when I got it so therefore I do not wear it I wanted a cotton jacket for the winter it’s a great print but the material It’s not for me thank you sorry
2.0,Tarnished after 3 uses
2.0,The top was a bit too large and the bottom seemed to be too tight.. not a good mix for me :/
2.0,So cute!!! That’s the stars. Great color. Zipper really stinks. As soon as you start going up the bottom opens. Only giving stars cause it’s so cute!!!
2.0,"I bought it for my wife, they fit  as she expected but the problem is the sewing, the moment she wore it the strips  got loose. I would never buy these bras again"
2.0,"Nice necklace BUT I never wear it because the main pendant (the heart), does not sit flushed against your chest. They welded it in a way where there’s a hook-like piece at the back which causes the heart to turn on its side. Very poor design."
2.0,"I got the Aoxjox seamless camo shorts and were in love with those so wanted to give these a try. These were much tighter and had a tighter seam at the thigh so it very visibly dug into my thigh. All around fit was different and if you have bigger thighs and butt I think the camo is much better. Got the red color in these and they were not squat proof at all. I got the medium in both and the camo fit better, was more flattering, more comfortable, and was actually squat proof so highly recommend those over these. My waist is 27”, my hips are 39”-40”, and my thighs are 23”"
2.0,They don't stay in place<br />Keep sliding down.
2.0,Very see through. I Have a large chest and it was very boxy on top.
2.0,"Item is too small, when the size states one size fits all. ITEM IS NOT TRUE TO ITS SIZE...FAIR WARNING!!!"
2.0,Low quality material and see through. I returned this product.
2.0,"These are very cute, but they fit weird and they are poor quality fabric.  The first pair I ordered ripped within 2 wears and the replacement pair I bought has also torn."
2.0,Runs very small and narrow
2.0,"Wanted these socks for summer wear. Pros: lightweight, comfortable material. Cons: socks slip off my ankles. I have a larger shoe size, so the socks might work for smaller foot sizes. However, it might just be a problem with the socks, regardless of foot size."
2.0,"used the charts for sizing, way too small"
2.0,I thought that I had more of a light green tint to it however it did not
2.0,Poor quality. Returned after 2 months.
2.0,Very pretty but runs extremely small<br />I’m a Large but ordered an XL and still didn’t fit
2.0,Beautiful earrings but are small enough for a small child or baby. Had to send back
2.0,I could only get 4 to 5 bills in this bank and I wanted it to hold at least 10 bills ( $100’s) in it. Too small for my usage and the lock was hard to do and the key is very flimsy! I don’t think it would last for years of using.
2.0,"Good looking watch but, losses 5 seconds per day."
2.0,"Looks good and seems to be made well, however I will never know as the sizes run 1.5 X smaller than normal. The XL I ordered was more like Med .  Had to give it to my wife."
2.0,This shirt runs ridiculously small. An XL looks like it would fit a toddler! Plus you have to pay to return it!
2.0,I used it for 5 months.  The top clasp that holds it shut cracked.  Now the wallet does stay closed.  The plastic clasp needs to be more robust.
2.0,ordered 3xl which isn’t true to size. Shipped from china cheaply made and fit is terrible. Wish i had read reviews before buying.
2.0,They’re pretty enough but they’re hard to close.  Levers don’t snap closed easily.
2.0,Looks very nice on and is adjustable to fitting but poorly made unfortunately! I had high hopes but it didn’t work out for me! Came apart at the seems.
2.0,Looks good but fabric is very thin--not warm at all.
2.0,"Comes wadded up in a bag--you will have to get the wrinkles out.  Clearly you get what you pay for--feels like liner is about to fall out, cut not even, buttons are all about to fall off right out of the bag.  This product may last a few wearings, best to avoid unless you like to throw money away"
2.0,"The front of the choker is nice, but the chain & fastenings are so cheap, ugly & tacky that I'm going to be replacing them with better-looking components.  Since people see other people all the way around, not just each others fronts, the back is as important as the front to me."
2.0,"Nice weight, to small for my arm. Will pass them on to my son or return"
2.0,I have worn a perfect size 7 for over 40 years. These shoes were more like a size 9 -- very long and the straps were way too loose. I returned immediately.
2.0,Diamond on top scraches roof of mouth
2.0,to simple
2.0,"True to size, not off the shoulder...fabric is OK, a poly blend but the print is a great camo print. While sizing is true to size it is definitely NOT off thr shoulder. A more accurate description would be is it is a, short with s large neck hole. I'm debating cutting just on rjr outside of the collar seam to make it off the shoulder 🤷🏻‍♀️"
2.0,"I was not impressed. The color looks phony. I asked for a large and it was too tight, I plan on seeing if any of my friends want it."
2.0,"I purchased 3 different sunglasses, and this pair was the better one, and I kept it. I used it when driving for 8 months.<br />Recently the  side broke, while I had them on, driving - fatigue of the frame material.<br />Writing to the supplier, amusing that there is warranty for the product (which is not disclosed anywhere), I was informed that the product is out of warranty, and they provide 50% coupon to buy another pair.<br />The frame material is too week, made of thin plastic, not relay a quality product, with no warranty.<br />I purchase it for $15 now it is $23.<br /><br />Update: the new pair broke too, after a month and half, same problem.<br /><br />Ordered DUCO and the glasses are made for better material, comes with case, hotly different experience ( for $1 more)"
2.0,"They tarnished quickly and looked cheap. Some of them were extremely small. They couldn’t even fit my pinky. Mind u, my fingers are quite small already."
2.0,"The shorts look good from a far, but they are practically sheer once worn as the fabric is paper thin.  Very cheap quality."
2.0,I was very excited for this necklace. The absolute only way I can wear it is if I send it to gold plater. The chain is really cheap and even the stone is not as clear as the picture. Very rough cut!
2.0,Received this order only a few pair were of fair quality that I can wear.
2.0,ordered for gift
2.0,The idea is great but the leather was very stiff.  Easy to snap on but difficult to unsnap.  It feels like the snap will rip away from the leather eventually because it’s do card to open the chap.  Known other similar ones but not made if leather.  Disappointed
2.0,"I really liked this little watch for the couple days it worked. I want to be able to quickly check the time. I clipped this watch onto my belt loop and stuck it in my front pocket. It was large enough to read at a glance, but small and light enough to not feel it in your pocket.<br />I am trying to avoid pulling my phone out to see the time and ending up distracted by notifications, as well as avoiding a wristwatch because I have eczema and have experienced skin irritation issues in the summer wearing a Fitbit..<br />Unfortunately, after a couple days it quit working. It could have just been defective, so I thought about exchanging for another, but I don't want it to stop working again after the return window ends, so I will continue searching."
2.0,"I ordered several of these tops at the beginning of the summer in various colors. While I love the fabric, fit, and colors... that is where the love affair ends. After wearing a couple of them 3 times, washing in cold on delicate, and air drying, 2 of these have started to come unsewn at the top along the neckline where the edging is over sewn . A third had to be returned upon receipt because it actually had a series of small holes along the back seam. I thought that was a fluke but see now after some time it is a matter of quality workmanship and materials. I would advise against purchasing this product. It is of course too late to return them but be warned that"
2.0,I have washed these 3 times with lots of fabric sotenor and they are still stiff and wrinkle easily.
2.0,Cute but smaller than expected. Quality is that as you’d find in a 99c store and not as pictured or worth $8.00. I needed a tortoise shell look earring so I’ll keep and wear them  until I find a larger pair of better quality.
2.0,"The fabric is thin, however with the appropriate undergarments. I feel this skirt would be exactly what I would need to wear to Spring/Summer events. There is a button hole in the waste to feed the tie through, however it does not allow the skirt together properly at the waist. So unless you're planning on wearing this with a swimsuit it's going to show everything underneath😳 a closure or snap on the inside seam would-be a more ideal design. Still deciding if I will return or not? An insert card on how to tie skirt for dummies would be appreciated."
2.0,"Fun for the colors, but very thin and weak quality so depending what you need it for they could work great. If you're actually trying to keep the sweat out of your face, they don't absorb much."
2.0,Jacket is cut very small
2.0,"When I received the watch, I was a bit disappointed because it wasn’t how it was in the picture but hoping stepson will like it regardless."
2.0,They fit great but they aren't very durable. Crotch ripped after about a month.
2.0,"A little small around the waste but otherwise made ok. I returned this item due to the skirt poof being unflattering around my hips. I expected a goofy tulle skirt, but this was like a lumpy poof."
2.0,Seem to be good quality and they are polarized lenses.  However the fit is not good.  The nose piece is uncomfortable. I had both of my sons try these on and neither found them comfortable.
2.0,"Feels cheap, poor quality"
2.0,It was really big. I need to send it back. I am 5’7” and 116 and a small was way too big
2.0,"Bought this dress for my 5'6"" daughter. When it arrived, it was too short, not only in the overall length, but from the waist to shoulders.  This dress is made for a more petite person.  Dress came about 2"" above knees and we were looking for something below the knee."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:9e5ad11420366ec9a86c62cde23a2452]] I normally wear a dress pants in size  12.  I read so many reviews especially body types and weight like mine . Some said their pants were too small and some said their pants were too big. I ordered  what was suggested by Amazon and the size chart XXL. The company is not following the same pattern. I am 5‘9 and 195 lbs. Pants did not fit me at all.  I’m so disappointed that I have send back. What a hassle..
2.0,So far two pair if the earrings have broken off in my daughters ear leaving the plastic post inside
2.0,"This is a popular sweatshirt for young boys so when I ordered it for my Grandson, he loved it.  However, the sleeves are way too long for the fit of the sweatshirt.  Fits fine through chest & hood so a size smaller would have been too little for him.  He is tall for his age (8) so he does not have short arms.  I have to take this to a seamstress now to have the sleeves shortened in order for him to wear it because they are at least 6&#34; too long.  This garment just isn't proportioned as it should be, especially for the cost."
2.0,I like the ring very much the two colors were great. But after I wore it a couple of days the color started to come off.<br />The size ran true.
2.0,"The saying is funny but the shirts are from China and must run in their size scale. I got a 3XL anticipating it would run small and it fits like a womens large. It’s 3x’s smaller than the label. If a women's large or smaller works for you then great.<br />Also, getting a refund was pretty easy HOWEVER you have to ship it back to China and the label is in Chinese and says you have to add postage when they claim “free returns”. No idea how much that will be. Not happy about it!!<br />Overall, it’s definitely not worth it to me to buy from them!  There are much better companies out there!"
2.0,"Tight fit, very little stretch. I got halfway in it and I was stuck. I mean arms up in the air like an ape stuck. I started to panic. The bra was covering my face and I couldn't see if my curtains were shut, hopefully the neighbors weren't getting a show as I twisted and bent and said swear words. After quite a bit of time I was finally released from this brassiere restraint. And it's such a darn cute bra I (briefly) considered giving it one more shot. But no."
2.0,Took FOREVER to arrive & isn't good quality
2.0,I am petite and would have like to order a petite size however there was no where to indicate petite even though the size chart showed it came in petite.  So I ordered a medium and this style just did not look right.
2.0,The metal of the belt is completely different than pictured. I bought it for the sole reason of the metal being a bronze/gold color for my daughter's wedding but it's a pewter/dark gray instead. A nice looking belt but I feel jipped I didn't get what was shown.
2.0,"This is a very cute tank top, but it runs very large. I ordered my normal size and it was two sizes too big. Also large arm cut- outs."
2.0,"Disappointed, pants do not look like picture and are short for a 6'2"" young man."
2.0,"I wear a larger, bought extra large and they are fitting like a large and snug. I bought them for Christmas. Had them on 4 times since and the material has bumpy cloth balls on it as if I'd had the pants for years. Poorly made."
2.0,"Not sure what I got was even considered a shirt! Very cheap material, made in China, color was not at all like pictured in the multi stripe!  It ran small everywhere, especially in the arms and the overall length- it was like a belly top if you lifted your arms. I returned this top!"
2.0,Bought it for a band replacement but it couldn't fit the watch. Luster fades quickly in the space of a few days.
2.0,"I was anxious to wear my ring as soon as I received it! After having had it on for approximately 5 or 6 hours, when I removed it from my middle finger, I  was left with a wide green stain where the ring had been and it was very difficult to get the stain off my finger. I guess you really get what you pay for..."
2.0,"Sizing is waaay off!  I ordered XL, stated to be US 16-18, but it was a generous small - maybe medium at best!<br />Will be returning this asap!<br /><br />That said, love the color, pattern and fabric.  It is a thick, crinkly cotton that looks wonderful...if it fit!"
2.0,Don't buy this if you're overweight thinking it'll help.<br /><br />The material is incredibly thin and has no strength whatsoever. This is purely for showing off your pecks and abs if you're already built or at least skinny. I was looking for replacement Compression shirts cause Champion stopped making theirs and these are not legit compression shirts. They don't hold anything in place.
2.0,The pants are not flattering if you have a large behind and legs. The product is for the slimmer woman.
2.0,The clip on the band broke on the first day I wore it.
2.0,"No XS available and Small was way, way too big for my girlfriend."
2.0,To small with no &#34;give&#34; room. Returned.
2.0,The shoes were are nice as they look online but they were too small. Must order one size up.
2.0,Made one-two sizes smaller than indicated
2.0,"The watch was super cute, but the battery died after about a month."
2.0,Look great on. I love the way they looked and wore them everywhere for a week until a lensed popped out. Tried taking them to get the lense put back in but it was the frame that broke.
2.0,"This didn't work for me. The buckle is so long that the leather keeper would have to be on the other side of the first belt loop of the trousers. However, you can't get the keeper through the loop, nor can you fit the buckle through the loop from the other side. It is a good piece of leather but for me it's unusable. Maybe I should buy a straight razor and use it for a strop."
2.0,"The saree was too small yet the skirt was too large, plus the zipper was super finicky. I kept the skirt but ordered a different top.<br />I typically wear medium, size 10 jeans and an about a 36B bra size. The whole for the head was very narrow and the sleeves were skinny as well.<br />Completely honest, I had to ask my dude to help me get it off because I was stuck more than a mammoth in a tar pit."
2.0,I ordered C's. They're too small and Im usually not a full C. Maybe I should try Ds. Im just going to use them to cover my nipples like big pasties. They're not good for support of any kind. You can see the entire outline also.
2.0,"I wore these around the house for about an hour. The sole is so stiff they are hard to walk in. I actually tripped a few times. There is absolutely no cushion/support. They made made feet and back hurt so bad.<br /> Also, there is no way they are real sheepskin. They feel so cheap.<br />I definitely returned these"
2.0,The product matches the looks.The hinges feels hard and you have to convince the ear ring  to close and open the clamp.The locking is not intact and one ear ring opens soon after locking.Item # c26.06.05Ho RKD16053006267 2020911450<br /><br />was very supriseed at price and amount of efforts in designing its looks.Could be issue ith this product alone.looks good when worn.But arrives 1 month delayed :(
2.0,Item received looks nothing like the item in the picture
2.0,Not a good quality of material.
2.0,I like the band but the protector doesn’t work very well with the touch screen feature. You have to push really hard and sometimes it works and other times it will not.
2.0,The top of this outfit is annoying it flips up and it doesnt stay in place. So if you buy this be prepared to go and get some kind of fabric tape or have someone fix the top.
2.0,Too big and cheap look
2.0,I didn’t realize this was a vinyl graphic otherwise I wouldn’t have purchased it. We shall see if it holds up in the wash. Also was disappointed that it showed that it was a prime purchase/item and it took 3 weeks or more to come in.
2.0,"Too small. Too thin. Seems like they are made for a child's foot. Unless you have very petite feet and looking for something very sheer in an unsoft material, steer clear."
2.0,don't like the pebbled leather
2.0,The sizes run small so I was a little disappointed because it won't fit for long
2.0,they look like they have been worn.
2.0,"This top was disproportionally boxy, wide, and short for the 2xl size."
2.0,"Disappointed...... not at all what I expected. It is very very VERY thin material, definitely not good for winter. It's also a bit short, I expected it to be a little longer. Overall I think it looks super cheap but it's not worth the hassle of returning for $15.00."
2.0,Very thin and cheap looking. I could completely see through it. It was also too small even though M is my normal size.
2.0,"This product is similar to compression shirts I bought at Walmart in 2012. Walmart discontinued selling them (under the 'Starter' brand) and they are my go-to shirt under my suits. The fabric is a little stretchier (If that's a word) than I had hoped, but it will do what I need it to do.<br /><br />I rate the product with 2 stars because of a peculiar smell. The product did come in what appeared to be factory packaging, so I believe the smell may have just originated in the factory. However, I wanted to try the shirts on to make sure they fit properly and noticed they smelled almost like cat urine.<br /><br />I'll give them a wash and see if it comes out and will update later."
2.0,"Beautiful bralette, but came damaged. Large hole in the side."
2.0,waited a month for this very uncomfotable
2.0,"The fabric is very sheer  and definitely flowy.  The v-neck is not very pronounced.  I felt as if I were wearing a thin version of a man's white t-shirt.  For me, it was not flattering at all."
2.0,"Very disappointed in the poor quality. I figured it would be PU Leather and not Genuine Leather as advertised, but it was plastic. The red color dyed plastic material rubbed off easily. I sent it back to amazon. One thing nice about it was the design."
2.0,"I ordered this skirt in white with intentions to wear it to an all white affair. I wanted to wear the sheer skirt over my short shorts. When I took the skirt out of the bag, I immediately noticed there was a hole in it & it’s dirty. I immediately contacted Amazon in attempt to get a replacement. However, the skirt is no longer available in white. I’m very disappointed because it complimented my outfit perfectly. Now I have to find something else and hope to receive it in time."
2.0,"I loved the reviews on these goggles so I went for it. I swim with contact lenses in my eyes, so I NEED leakproof! I was excited to give these a try, but one lap and I was disappointed! LEAKED."
2.0,"I think the picture is very misleading.  The oval holes in these jackets are not big enough for the ruby posts to sit inside of the jackets.  The rubies sit on top of the jackets, not inside of them.  From the side, these earrings are tall like a two layer tiered cake.  The posts on the ruby earrings are at least a full 3+ mm longer than standard posts so that they're long enough to go through the entire height of the jacket and still have enough length to go through an ear and an earring back.<br /><br />I bought this set because I was looking for oval ruby earrings the size of these stones (6x4 mm) without the white zirconia jackets.  Independently, I was also looking for white zirconia or white sapphire jackets that would hold a set of 6x4 mm oval posts of a different stone color that I also bought from the same manufacturer.  I figured this set would be perfect because I'd get both items I wanted in one purchase.  It didn't work out the way I had hoped.  When I put my standard size 6x4 mm post earring into the jacket, it also wouldn't fit inside the jacket so the post that stuck out the back wasn't long enough to also get through my ear, let alone hold a back.<br /><br />I also knew I wouldn't be able to wear these ruby posts without the jackets because the posts were so long they would have jabbed into my neck from the back of my ears.  I already have a pair of coral post earrings with posts that are shorter than these rubies and I know I get little scabs on my neck behind my ears from getting stuck with the posts every time I wear them.<br /><br />Finally, the color of the rubies is a mix between pink and red that clashes with most of those colors.  The color looks pink against red clothing and it looks red against pink clothing.  This set looks best when worn with white or a contrasting color like green, blue, or black.<br /><br />The set would look nice on a woman with larger ears than mine, but I’m not sure a woman with ears large enough to pull them off would think to buy them because the stone measurement is small and the picture doesn’t show how high they sit up off the ears.  These earrings just weren’t what I wanted or expected, so I returned them."
2.0,"The bracelet is very pretty and sturdy, so I was very disappointed when the clasp would not hold the ends together.  I tried several times, and although there are safety hooks on either side of the clasp, they also did not hold tight.  The bracelet would just fall off my wrist.  I am returning this."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:1dc7efbfd57d2e1a57f79c989071e807]] Photos can be quite deceiving.<br />Looks nothing as pictures posted the material, the color looks nothing like what's posted.<br /><br />I was excited to open the package and I was disappointed."
2.0,It shrunk after the first washing making it uncomfortable to wear again. Been busy at worked and just tried to return it and missed the return window by 2 days
2.0,"Faded after one washing, just o.k."
2.0,Does not fit like the model shown here. I hate when they use photo shop so much.  Material was okay.  Fit large compared to size chart recommendation. Didnt like the fit because you have to have a larger cup size for this to look good. If your larger then a C cup it might work best for you. Just go smaller in size bscause it runs large.
2.0,too small for 12 1/2
2.0,Shirt arrived missing buttons and surprisingly there were no extra buttons had to find a seamstress to repair.
2.0,"the pocket is perfect for your phone while running, snug enough it won't pop out. Shorts don't ride up. Only downside is I wish the waist was a little higher. Overall, I would purchase again.<br /><br />Update: since first purchase. I made a second purchase and manufacturer changed material and they are not stretchy anymore like most work out shorts. Would not recommend"
2.0,The material was a very poor quality and it was super small!  I had to return.
2.0,Very pretty when I first opened it but it tarnished after 2 days.
2.0,Pants look great but didn’t come with a button to close them. I had to sew one on.
2.0,It advertises that it is a shacket but it is a flannel shirt at best. Material feels cheap and his thin for a flannel. It is cut like a barrel…. Big around and short. I was very disappointed. I will be returning it.
2.0,It not what I had expected.  The embellishment were stick on not even rhinestones.
2.0,"Put this on my Fossil Gen 5. Got the ""long"" thinking it would fit me no problem. Not even close. My wrist is a bit over 8"". Long story short, if you're a big guy, look elsewhere."
2.0,Definitely not sterling silver! Feels cheap and broke my skin out after wearing only a few hours. I have a lot of sterling silver jewelry and this is definitely not the same material.
2.0,"Plastic and cheap feel to them. Come with three lenses and no instructions on how to change them. Work it out for yourself. Very narrow and pinch the nose and scrape behind the ear. Uncomfortable after 5 minutes. The dark lens is barely dark, smoke lens maybe from a ‘light’ cigarette and the clear lens is of no use at all unless worn for a costume party.<br />Two stars as the case it comes in is decent and useful to carry your better quality glasses in. Should be clearly marked “children’s costume glasses”"
2.0,My Boys wanted this. I didn't know it was that small.
2.0,"Super skinny pants and skin tight on me. Good material and design, just can't be comfortable or move in them."
2.0,"Cute, but I discovered afterwards that  you can purchase this exact same tiara for $1.00 at any Party City."
2.0,"I ordered a size up since I don't like clingy...it would have been fine but the underarm portion was so extremely large, there was no way I could wear it."
2.0,This necklace broke within 3 months. Loved it but not the best quality.
2.0,"I love the ring's function and fit, but mine is mostly green with one tiny spot of barely noticeable pink - not rainbow like the pictures showed. Disappointed in that."
2.0,Low quality. Tarnished almost immediately
2.0,Nice tie but not the color advertised. It’s a little frustrating.
2.0,It was cute but I lost it on the first day!
2.0,Too small. I ordered an xl. Fits like a medium
2.0,"Hey, it was very inexpensive, the dragon was cool, as they usually are (being imaginary), and I didn't have to drive to any more truck stops looking for a biker/trucker whatever chain wallet anymore. For a couple months anyway. Then it started fraying, chain keeper broke, insides became outsides, and my bills, as in dollars, became experts at hide and go seek. So I played also and hid it in a garbage can couple weeks ago, at a truckstop no less, one with an excellent inventory, and not at all cheap. You pays yer money, you takes yer chances..."
2.0,"The wooden is cheap and stain is very uneven with some spotting. Very disappointed in the appearance of the wood. Texture is rough and definitely no top coat or sealed so can’t use for drinks, plants etc without doing my own top coat of sealant first and for the price I shouldn’t have to do that. Also returns are direct with company, not Amazon and you have to pay to ship back yourself."
2.0,Fell apart fairly quick. Loved the pattern on the case though.
2.0,Ordered XXL<br />And it doesn’t look right.
2.0,"It's a drap grey, brown with maybe a hint of green<br /><br />8/28 A second one was sent and the material is different, more synthetic feeling. The color is a dark olive or army green and not like the pictures so I will be sending it back"
2.0,Pretty but snags so bad. I returned it.
2.0,"The words Love are barely able to be seen or felt. Not at all like the picture. I would of sent it back but I would of ended up owing them money...shipping as much as the rubber ring. It fit and was comfortable, but don't buy it for the engraved word, &#34;love&#34; cause you cant tell its there."
2.0,Faceted Black Tourmaline Bead Bracelet looked different in online pics. The beads are really small...I expected much bigger beads. The bracelet opening was really narrow as well. It should've fit my 5.5 inch wrist but I couldn't even get it over my knuckles. I tried adjusting the cord but it was really tight and wouldn't budge. I guess it wasn't meant to be. I wouldn't recommend if you prefer bigger beads and if you are not familiar with adjusting this type of bracelet.
2.0,"The title pretty much says it. I bought this just before my baby was born and wore it once afterwards. After one has a baby it's pretty common to have a bit more to cover around the tummy area. This doesn't even do it after I returned to my pre-pregnancy figure. On the upside, the fabric is nice and the cups fairly supportive. I think that it would have a nice smoothing effect if it I wasn't constantly tugging at the bottom hem to pull it back down into place. I'm 5'8"" but have a pretty short torso for my height. It could possibly work for very petite ladies. I would skip it if you're over about 5'3""."
2.0,Item was listed as cotton and was a nylon blend.
2.0,Only purchase if you have a VERY short torso. It does not cover my chest fully! Fits very small too.
2.0,This cloak might be ok for children but not for an adult.  I couldn't get it around my neck.  It took weeks to get it.  It didn't cost much so it went into the trash.
2.0,"Updated:<br />The sunglasses is starting to break apart after less than 1 week of use. See last 2 photos.<br />Here are some of the pro's and con's about this sunglasses.<br />Pro's: The sunglasses came in with nice box, stylish triangle hardcase, and a nylon sack Great if you are giving it away as a gift. As indicated on the box, it has UV protection lenses. The lenses are oversized, which is the main reason why I bought it. One thing which I think is very thoughtful is it also come with a tiny screwdrive for the sunglasses.<br />Con's: The quality of the sunglasses was ok. It does feel premium. It definitely doesn't feel like a designer's sunglasses, more like night market quality. (You get what you pay for.)<br />Overall, I'm still happy with it.<br /><br />Even though I purchased this product at no cost, the opinion is entirely mine. As an Amazon customer, I rely on customer reviews to make my purchasing decision. So I hope this review will be helpful to you as well."
2.0,Was way to loose for me around my tummy. I ordered the large. I'm 5'7 and weight 160
2.0,"I’m overweight (size 8 or 10), and these give me the thigh version of muffin top. It’s like the manufacturers think your thighs and calves are the same size. Quality is fine, just not happy with the size/structure. Opening should be wider than the foot (because even at a healthy weight my thighs are still bigger than my ankles)."
2.0,Too small but too long for a 5 foot short old  woman .I should know better ;I'm too old to wear this style. My mistake so I didn't return; will just have to find a slim TALL YOUNG GREAT NIECE who will DARE wear this awkward dress.
2.0,Yea these are not “work” boots! They are not built to last or protect. They are fashionable that’s it though.. go to Walmart and get those Brahma or husky boots for cheaper than these and truly wayyyy better
2.0,"These run very small. The 4 year old I gifted them to loved the design, but they were too small for her hands. Super disappointed as the listing indicates it should fit up to 6 y/o. The lining inside is nice and soft, but bunches up when putting on and off. Overall very cute but not practical."
2.0,The brass bracelet is beautiful but The jewels fell off before I even opened the package.
2.0,Nice socks but too small and tend to slip.  Size 11 shoes.
2.0,"Cross is way too high almost chokes you, it’s not cute!"
2.0,Pros: It was great having all the various sizes.<br /><br />Cons: The black studs have a coated stem (paint or something) that peels of easily. My ear was irritating badly because it was rubbing off inside of the lobe.
2.0,Strap was not attached when we received them.
2.0,This is really cute but the arms are so tight and not tight in a cute way tight...tight enough to feel like a Chris Farley impression of “fat man in a little coat” tight.  And I don’t have exceptionally large arms.  It just fits weird.  If you are a size 0-6 you probably won’t have a problem but us regular sized girls will.
2.0,"i don't love this shoe measure. i would have preferred it as the actual size, its in inches and centimeters so you have to google what that equals in shoe size. it also did not come with the tape  measure."
2.0,"This dress is terrible, cheap and see through. Would not recommend."
2.0,Falling apart  and wayyyy too big
2.0,"When the bracelet arrived, the turquoise stone had fallen out. I had to use glue to hold  the turquoise stone in place. The bracelet is unique, but not adjustable.  I will wear it, but will not purchase anything again from this vendor."
2.0,Runs extremely small I bought the biggest size they had which I believe was a 12 upon reading reviews of how small it ran & that was for my 4yr old. My 4yr old usually wears a 6x & the size 12 robe is still tight on him. He can wear it but it's right kinda hard to put on & definitely can not tie or button it. It doesn't even come down to his knees maybe mid thigh length & again this is a size 12 for my 4year old who usually wears a size 6x.!! The robe itself is soft & would be comfy especially for the price so if u have a smaller child I suggest buying three sizes up & it might work.
2.0,"It is nothing like what it pictured. I didn’t expect it to be exact, but my whole key chain is one color (black!!). Seems like it will hold up okay for a little while."
2.0,This runs super big and is not the material in the picture :(
2.0,"Although these are sturdy and well made, the hooks were too thick for my ear holes and my ears got infected. I have very sensitive skin but I was hoping maybe my ears were distressed because of the gauge/thickness of the hooks. I tried one in my belly button piercing for a minute and it got infected too. They are pretty but too big and not the right kind of titanium for my extra sensitive skin. I had to return these."
2.0,Theo fit well and are very stylish.  However I've learned since getting them that they offer very little protection and are band from school.  So they're use is mainly for a fashionable look at this point
2.0,It's not very good quality. Incredibly cheap for the money spent.
2.0,"I really liked these earrings - unfortunately, after wearing the earrings only once, the post fell off the back of one of them.  I haven't tried repairing it yet - but one would think that they would have lasted for at least a little bit longer!"
2.0,"it was a little too flouncy at the skirt and not very flattering. I am curvy and it only accentuated my bubble butt. As for the sides they were a little too exposed...they sides near your breasts go straight down, so a little too much skin. other than that, it was a cute print. I returned it a bought another way flattering suit for about $5 more."
2.0,It is like a kids shirt way to small for me and I am only about 145lbs. Think of it as a kids shirt so if you are buying it for a child it is good if not get like 3 sizes up.
2.0,"My son has two pairs of everyday shoes, so these weren't even used every day, but after four months the sole has completely come apart from the rest of the shoe. He loved the shoes so we are very disappointed they didn't last long."
2.0,Was able to use the product a total of 2 times before it stopped charging. This is apparently a common theme with this item
2.0,Most safety glasses will not fit!
2.0,"These were so tight, it cut off circulation on my toes.  Not to mention it was extremely difficult to get on."
2.0,"I am 5’3 and 135lbs. I ordered a Medium in both Navy and Black. Both dresses fit great and true to size for my body style, but my only downside is that they are shorter than I imagined. They go right below my knee, was hoping to be more mid calf or maybe even a couple of inches longer like the image shows. But if I wear them with knee high boots in the fall, the length will be fine. Or with a skirt extender...<br />The material is soft and cotton, not the dressy silky material which is what I was hoping for. Very modest and flattering. I could not wear this dress with a belt as it would raise the hem length and be above my knee. But if these issues don’t bother you than these are the dresses your looking for!<br />But for me i returned them bc they just were not what I was expecting.."
2.0,Product is a bit too large
2.0,"not very happy with this purchase. i put it on when i first got it to make sure it fit and it fit wonderfully. very beautiful. but during the first wash in the washing machine, THE ARM SLEEVE CAME OFF THE DRESS! so i am now having to re-sow the arm back on to the dress. other than that, it’s great but $40 for a dress and the sleeve comes off before i even get to wear it? not worth it"
2.0,"the zipper on top keeps getting stuck in the material and though it has a lot of pockets the only big one is on top, and the one over the flap things in front. the rest are useless."
2.0,Runs huge will be returning.
2.0,"I've become a fan of SheIn and I've been wearing a lot of clothes that they provide, but I was not a fan of this. The concept was cute, but the application of it was bad. Also, I had a lot of stray strings and it looked like it was kind of coming apart."
2.0,Fit atleast 2 sizes smaller
2.0,"These are good for going out bc they give a pleasant shape to your boobs, but THEY ARE NOT COMFORTABLE TO SLEEP IN.<br />Not at all."
2.0,"I received it for a week, but I only wear it twice times. It too dark inside the car. I don't see clearly my GPS, so I have to take off it when I was driving. I buy it online, so I don't know it too dark. I don't have the time to return it. I think maybe I will wear it when I walking."
2.0,The material is thin and shows every little bump (cellulite) on my skin. Not flattering.
2.0,Didn’t feel good on skin and the zipper didn’t work well. The price is not equivalent to the quality.
2.0,"For the price, I would hope to get a better hat. Hat is extremely flacid, floppy, and quite ugly. Get the desired badging and have it sewn onto a better hat."
2.0,"Really wanted to love this shirt, but Very box and thin, see through thin.  Also the shirt is short, if I do not wear an undershirt my stomach will show."
2.0,Very pretty but it broke not long after I bought it
2.0,"I would like to start off by saying the look and finish of the band is very nice it fits well into the look of the watch because I have a black silicone case cover purchased separately and from a different vendor. It came with a very inexpensive(cheap) pin removal tool to adjust the size of the band and I do have to say that the pins did come out without a problem at least on mine oh, I had purchased a band prior, again from a different vendor and the pins would not come out.<br /><br />The reason for my two star review is that the double locking mechanism opens up all the time on its own it does not stay closed at least five or six times a day I have to re-close the band and besides the inconvenience of that I'm afraid that one day it'll slide off of  my wrist  without me noticing. It started doing this just over a month after I purchased it I now own it for two and a half months at the time of this review"
2.0,"I have had two of this exact wallet in the past and they both were great, the band that wraps around it never broke and it felt sturdy.  I was dissappointed when I ordered the new one as you can feel the quality has gone down.  Especially the band around it, it will most likely break.  I've only had it a month and it is looking pretty bad.<br /><br />Timbuk2 - What happened with quality?"
2.0,Dialike
2.0,"I think these are cheap plastic welding goggles painted with a sort of bronze patina look.  They might be fine for brief usage as part of a costume, but (IMHO) not for any sort of multi-hour use. I had hoped to wear them for Burning Man, but they turned out woefully inadequate for that purpose.  The first problem is that there is no padding at all between the eyepiece plastic and your eyes, so they get pretty uncomfortable to wear for more than a few minutes.  Also, the nose bridge &#34;noodle&#34; thing is not easily adjustable, so they only fit your face size well if you get lucky.  And the glass lenses were a bit &#34;foggy&#34; to look through, and cleaning didn't help.  Also, the elastic strap doesn't really fit the theme, but that might be an acceptable compromise for comfort and ease of use.  Still, I'll bet they could find something which looks sort of like leather laces while still having some elasticity.  They come with a decent little bowtie mesh baggie for storage.  While I returned mine unused, I'm giving two stars because I think they could be useful for some people.  And at least the price is right."
2.0,"So this sweater is as pictured, and is nice. I like it. Super cute. The reason it gets two stars, is it comes unlaced and it took me 45 minutes to lace this thing up. The sweater is nice and light, good for spring or fall."
2.0,"I was aware of the need to order 2 size up - ordered XXL (I usually wear Large size), but still way too small. Funny as the waist band looks to be about right for XXL, but the rest below feels tiny... I do fit into 34 waist pants... Go figure. I feel like this undies are made for kids. Two stars because the quality if the materials seemed not too bad for a price."
2.0,"Definitely cheap made material and see through, however the dress is comfortable. I'm not too fond of the dress which is why I'm going to return it."
2.0,I pulled them out and immediately noticed they were not full length even though the pictures were?? Theyre like mid shin length?? Super disappointing because they feel like a really good material.. im 5'3 and got a medium they should not have been that short i dont even have long legs
2.0,"Got this for my daughter(21y) and she liked it at 1st, but I was very disappointed with the look/quality.<br /><br />Then she realized that the zipper is really non-functional as it only spans about 1/2 the width of the bag (centered) leaving large gaps on either side open so if you drop it or tip it, all small items slide write out!<br /><br />I would have returned it immediately, but it's too late now."
2.0,Great disappointment. Is this a knock-off of the real thing? No directions of any kind included. Extra batteries included but no directions as to how to install them. I thought I read something about a flashlight--not in this version. I found it plenty loud and I think it would chase some off and call others to your side. But many of the websites on Google are advertising a DIFFERENT product. Check it out before you buy this one.
2.0,"Bad quality, cheap"
2.0,"Decent looking sweater, but ran much too small and flimsy material tore almost immediately. Not a worthwhile investment even at a cheap price."
2.0,"The post is super long on these, not ideal for littles"
2.0,way too thin
2.0,"I did not know what to expect with this item being that there were no real reviews on the product itself, but unfortunately the product came less than satisfactory. The dress was a midi dress but the slit in the dress came up to my crotch area and also was way too small than what the product was described as. I always wear medium in dresses and this one fit like an extra small.<br /><br />Very disappointed since I was hoping to wear this to a wedding."
2.0,"I liked them quite a bit-until the frame cracked and busted irreparably with one slight drop. I only expect a replacement pair of identical glasses.  Thank you, Michael Coplan"
2.0,No me gustó para nada la tela modelo bonito entalle perfecto
2.0,Bought the adult size. It is super super tiny. Gave it to a friend who wears an XS. It looked ok on her. hat is tiny too. Thin material.
2.0,not sure who measures this but would only fit a child. Had to cut neck straps and tie behind neck to fit a woman.
2.0,I sent it back. Was super thin and clingy.
2.0,2 necklaces were broken. The others look fine but sad my favorite ones aren’t wearable.
2.0,"I really like the style and cut of this dress, but the material is thin and slinky. I ordered brown, and although the material isn't see through, it will show off your pantyline, lovehandles, etc. I wanted something to mainly wear around the house but that I wouldn't be embarrassed to run to the store in; this dress is not it."
2.0,That one is poor quality.
2.0,Make my feet look like clown feet.. :/
2.0,"Not a fan of the material, was hoping for a comfy cotton."
2.0,"It was good at the start very pretty! But after two weeks of wearing it also taking off when going to sleep and taking a shower, It still broke then after fixing it started to turn my neck GREEN!! You get what you pay for...."
2.0,"The description of color said white. Not so, it's a off white almost a cream color and the fabric is a little heavy. I thought the linen would be light weight. A bit disappointed."
2.0,It was cute but way too long and I couldn't shorten it.
2.0,Product material very uncomfortable and tight fitting. The overall product is cute just not comfortable.
2.0,"I think I've finally learned my lesson with buying clothes on Amazon.  While these shirts felt like they were of sufficient quality and had a good cut to them, the colors are so drab in person.  They look like the cheapest of the cheap and not at all like the great colors in the pictures.  I packaged these back up as soon as I opened them and saw the color.  The only one I'm keeping is the white.  So I can recommend white, and I would guess black is safe as well."
2.0,"Because I read some many reviews about it running small, I ordered a 36C, but I would say this probably fits more like a 34/36B. Although the band (on the loosest hooks) and the cup were fine, the straps are ridiculously short. Even adjusted to their maximum length, they were very tight.<br /><br />Also, this is the ITCHIEST (most itchy? Lol) bra I have ever owned. In. My. Life!<br /><br />I wore it to work after washing 1x and had to take it off mid morning!  (It's always freezing in my office = bad/rock hard nips, but I could wear my jacket the rest of the day without any questions = bearable.)<br /><br />Washed it a second time, with liquid fabric softener this time, and tried wearing it again(not to work! Lol). Got through 2 hours and had to take it off. Haven't tried to wear it again,  but I might give it another couple washes and try again.<br /><br />It's too late to return it and it's so very pretty. My boyfriend thinks it sexy, so this may just need to be my &#34;15 minutes of fame, before it hits the floor&#34; bra! ;-)"
2.0,"Out of this set of 6 bands I was able to use 2.  4 of the bands had pins that were just too long to fit my Gear S3. The other band, the pin just broke as I was trying to clip it in place.  All in all just absurdly poor quality stuff here.  I really loved the colors in this set, I was able to use the black and orange, the rest are garbage.  Not sure if this is a bad batch, or just overall poor quality crap."
2.0,"The shorts shipped very fast and were very reasonably priced. Follows the saying you get what you paid for. Last minute Christmas gift for my hubby. They were way to big, they went down to his ankles. They were much bigger than other shorts of the same size, like twice the size."
2.0,Runs way too small.  Had to return.  Make sure you size up.
2.0,"Our Grandaughter is 8 and she noticed right away that the eyes on SpongeBob & Patrick were the wrong colors. She said SpongeBob didn't even look like him, more like a blob. Disappointed!"
2.0,This dress took forever to be delivered and when it finally showed up it was damaged. Stitching is pulled out in several areas. Will be returning and not ordering a new one
2.0,The color isn't right.
2.0,The title says it. It’s great out of the box then after a few washes it’s as work out as it they were owned for years.  I returned them
2.0,"Too thin, and I asked for a 5X to make sure it would fit. but I received 3X instead."
2.0,This was very poor  Quality
2.0,"Very hard to put on due to small size and the style of the closure. Otherwise, very cute."
2.0,"Within minutes of trying this on, I was back online ordering a another NATO strap. It looked really cool and the material feels of quality; however, I find myself constantly adjusting to make it secure around my wrist. When my wife initially saw it on my TUDOR BRONZE, she commented  “that looks cheap.” Just a reminder, she’s referring to a strap on a $3000.00 watch that she picked out, but the NEW Strap  looked cheap. This was a week ago, and I still refuse to speak to her."
2.0,bad quality sound
2.0,"Initially liked the shirt, fit well, however there are loose threads hanging all over the shirt, and the loop that holds your sunglasses fell right off. Need the shirt right away so do not have time to return.  Would not order again."
2.0,Was disappointed
2.0,not what iI expected
2.0,"Soft fabric, nice print and good cuffs. Fits OK in the shoulders, but does not hang well; width through waist and hips small in proportion to shoulder so it pulls back from the front instead of flowing."
2.0,The length of the dress is wonderful but the neckline is pretty low-cut.  The pockets stick out unless you have something of decent weight in the pockets but then that pulls the neckline even further down.  Good for smaller sizes but not for anyone XL+.
2.0,The whole thing is awesome; even the silicone vent flap is well positioned and comfortable. However. the hook the straps have that goes on the back of the skull is incredibly flimsy- the rest of it is not. I can't fathom giving a 3+ star rating to a product I've had to DIY.
2.0,"the lettering on the back of the shirt was crooked (it was tilted to one side, not straight up and down the back)...the shirt itself is good just not happy the lettering was crooked considering the price of this shirt"
2.0,Cute but smallish
2.0,"I bought these for my niece for her birthday, unfortunately they hurt her ears."
2.0,These aren’t bad but the sizing is a little off and they really don’t hold support with hiding as well as I thought it would. They aren’t a bad price and are SUPER sticky but I would buy smaller if you want a good lift.
2.0,"Have been wearing MK pants for almost 8 years and they still can't seem to maintain QC in size and fabric, even among the same pant style. These were supposed to be a 35"" but almost exactly the same fit as four pairs of MK 34"" in my closet. Have had similar variability in fabrics in other MK styles. Still like their pants but it's something of a hit and miss."
2.0,"I am very disappointed, as I received the beige one & liked it - so ordered more colors & they were a different.<br />One Beige is 95% Polyester 5% Spandex / another Beige ""says"" 65% Cotton 35% Polyester (no spandex) / and ""then"".... the Gold one says Cotton 69% Polyester 26% Spandex 5%... Thing is (ironically and hmmmm) The ones that ""say"" cotton are like the material that makes you sticky hot... doesn't breath, and feels yuck to touch & wear.... The one that is 95% Polyester is somewhat soft.  I have purchased Sweaty Rocks for my daughter as well, this is the first time, as ordering a variety of this shirt that it is clear of the up & down quality."
2.0,This is a cute top but I feel like it runs a little small. I have a small body and wear a 34a. It came up past my belly button and felt very thin and see through. The fabric was also quite shiny.
2.0,The ankle of this slipper sock fits so tight it is uncomfortable.  I am a medium size woman who bought a man’s sock so it would be a generous fit.  I can’t imagine how these would be comfortable for a man.
2.0,"Kept great time - until 2 days after Amazon return period 1 of the ""ears"" fell off (where the pin holds the band on). Contacted Casio, received reply, but then nothing for over a week. For the price, not worth pursuing for a replacement. Buy cheap, get cheap."
2.0,"Received today. Overall cute and comfy material. Colors more pastel than expected but not a big deal. Biggest disappointment was the hole in the arm and a stain near the bottom of the front panel. I could live with the stain but the gaping hole near the shoulder is definitely a problem. Disappointed because the item is really cute. If anyone is interested to know...the item came vacuum-sealed, so compressed that the contents looked like putty! Could not even tell the texture of the material until all the air released."
2.0,"physically came apart after 8 months of use. first the bands used to hold down the strap, then the clasp itself."
2.0,The ring is very pretty however disappointed as the picture shows a jewelry pouch which i assumed would be included and wasnt. This was a gift for some one and now I will have to go purchase something to put it in. Not happy about that at all.
2.0,"I got this shirt for my husband who is 6'3"" and 185 lbs. I ordered and extra large and it is way to baggy!<br /><br />This shirt is advertised as a slim fit shirt and pictured on the model as a tight shirt. However, this shirt is not even close to a slim fitting shirt. My husband is a slim guy and you can blatantly see how wide it is on his arms and across his chest and stomach. Even if the hubby was all ripped like the guy in the picture, it still wouldn't fit. The second model pictured is a slim guy similar to my husband build and it obviously doesn't come close to that picture either. It is also kind of short, so even if we went down a size or 2 it would not fit right.<br /><br />It says that this is a cotton and polyester blend in the product description. However this is a mostly polyester shirt. The pictures of this product make it look almost similar to a thermal or under tank top, almost like a flat black. However it is shinny, like a compression shirt would be.<br /><br />He will most likely just wear it around the house as that material is comfortable. However, for the price of this shirt, I would not purchase it again or have purchased it if I was in person.<br /><br />I took off one star for the description saying slim fit when it is not.<br />I took off another star for the misleading photos of the shirt being tight.<br />I took off another star because the fabric is not described well of pictured accurate."
2.0,I should of read the Real reviews first. After 1 wear the waist band twisted while I was wearing them and i couldn’t flatted it out. Put them in the wash now it’s 10x worse. UGH. No longer wearable. Turns out I’m not the only one complaining of this problem. This is majority of the reviews they try to hide.
2.0,overall just not it. they dont look anything like the picture shown. overall dont recommend.
2.0,Buttons and quality is cheap
2.0,"Okay, got it as a gift. Kind of tacky but it works"
2.0,Will not hold up to constant wearing.  After 3 weeks they were stretched and offering no support.  Buy these for casual usage only.
2.0,"I ordered these because finding a case for oversized sunglasses is tough and I like the style well enough. The sunglasses are just as pictured, but the wire frame was loose on my face and behind my ears, and I generally wear sunglasses off the rack without adjustments. Also, the sunglasses need to be put just so to fit into the case."
2.0,"the pearls got unstuck from all the earrings ,dont waste your time"
2.0,needed to order larger size
2.0,I purchased 3 of these as bridesmaids gifts and I had to use a blade to get the latches opened and the get stuck open now. one of them also has a dark spot on the bracelet.
2.0,This dress is thinner than most t-shirts. I was planning to wear with tights but it shows everything underneath and kept riding up. Even for $12 it’s not worth it.
2.0,They don’t provide much compression.
2.0,Ok but not worth money
2.0,"this is a really cheap piece of costume jewlery. It doen't have a real chain. It has not clasp, the &#34;chain&#34; simply attatches by two ends to the jump ring."
2.0,I love the price and such a cute print but you get what you pay for...patterns don’t match up at all and some panels are upside down.  Not worth the hassle of sending back but I’m disappointed.
2.0,Had to keep adjusting to stay on my ear and eventually the piece broke off
2.0,"Bought these for a sleep cap for my recently permed hair.  Even with my hair wet or damp, I couldn't get my hair into it.  My assumption is that these are for shorter or tightly curled hair.  They were also not very big to get my large head into.  So if your head is bigger than 19inches its gonna be very tight."
2.0,Described as having a zipper closure...it does not!
2.0,"If you click on the 'Size' selection button you'll see there is just one size available ... 48"".<br />This happens to be my size and thought for the price I'll order. It was a mistake. Even the 48"" is the only available size listed and the tag on the shorts I received said 48"" it's nowhere near that waist size.<br />When measured, it was just a fraction over 36"". Totally unacceptable and completely false size statement.<br />Sent them back immediately!"
2.0,"The band is not designed to close in the middle of your wrist. Instead, at least in what I received, it sticks out almost on the side of your arm. It's uncomfortable and gets caught on things. This band makes it unwearable, even though the watch itself is great. I have the &#34;steel&#34; version of this watch, and that version closes where it should in the middle of your wrist."
2.0,"Fit was okay.  Shipping was late.  Quality of dress was poor - material was all polyester, strings hanging from seams, EXTREMELY wrinkled (I've ordered other gowns online and they were packed and shipped in a box to avoid wrinkles, this was shipped in a bag), etc.  Not worth the money."
2.0,Very thin material. Looks similar to picture but not worth the money. I expected higher quality.
2.0,The top was WAY to small and I got an X-Large based off the other reviews. I'm a 36D and I figured it would fit since a lot of my tops are just a size large but it did not
2.0,Cute but runs short and small and snags very easily ...pretty much will wear it once or twice and toss.
2.0,"Started out comfortable, but ended up marking my hand up. The multi sizes are just widths, and I found you are best putting it on after your ring is on. It occasionally feels like it's going to fall off but the plastic is a good texture, soft yet rigid. I wore it all day one time and have rather having a loose ring instead of using this again.  I may try other designs down the road"
2.0,Giving it two stars since you can not replace the batteries and it arrived not working at all.
2.0,"The swimsuit appears exactly as the picture shows, however the top is too small. I ordered according to the sizing chart and measured myself prior to ordering. The swimsuit fits around and ties in the front, regarding the top, but the cup part doesnt even cover my breast up to the nipples. The bottoms fit perfectly, but you can see the shape of my loose skin through the bottoms from having children. The material isnt see through, just can see the shape of my wrinkled skin through the bottoms. If you dont have this issue, your fit should be smooth. The cups for the top need to be bigger. I will be returning."
2.0,"The Small was huge! Which is odd as I've ordered other joggers from this company and they were extremely form fitting, which I prefer."
2.0,Love the shirt. Just fit tight around arms and white started to turn black and rip.
2.0,Very poor product
2.0,"This dress had a very odd cut. The wrap-around bust is far too short, meaning the horizontal seem goes across the bust like scrubs instead of under the bust like it should."
2.0,Not as easy to use as I thought.
2.0,did great till the glue came off and now its just junk
2.0,These hair nets was just what I wanted but they was just too darn tight and uncomfortable on my head
2.0,The arms were tighter than I expected and the placement of the pattern made the stomach and hip areas look bigger.
2.0,"The sizing is wrong on this. The chart shows I wear a medium and after getting it, I clearly need a small. Very disappointed in this!"
2.0,"The size guide is very inaccurate. Says Large is supposed to fit a Men's 11.5, yet barely fits a Men's 9.5. The overall quality is fair. I kept them and gave them to a size 9 instead."
2.0,14 is like a ten not good in sizes
2.0,My husband has a very small head for a man but this hat was too small for him it’s more of a child sized hat
2.0,These shirts are adorable! After one wash though to my disappointment the wifey lettering faded significantly and the shirt fadex to a darker gray. The hubby one in the same load was perfectly fine. Mine is now too shrunken to wear and faded. So sad!
2.0,"It looks gorgeous in the description,  but even with the lining, it's totally see through. I'm not willing to layer it to make it usable. It has a lot of stretch, hits me a little above my ankle and I'm 5 10"
2.0,the 2 panels of material are just tacked in the top middle so they overlap. which is fine if you're small chested I guess but since it's not 1 piece cut in a sweetheart it's prone to gaps. otherwise I liked it. pockets are nice.
2.0,The pictures look more real than the actual product.
2.0,Was disappointed by this purchase due to writing being an iron on appliqué vs embroidered. It wouldn’t have been durable and writing wouldn’t have stayed.
2.0,"I like everything about the jacket, except for the collar. It's very awkward when wearing and wont lay down flat. Pokes up into my neck the whole time."
2.0,"I weight 200 lbs. am 5'10"" I ordered a xxx large and it was still to small. Tight around the arms and chest."
2.0,My daughter loved the colors and was excited when she got them.  However one of the pom pom's fell off after the first wear.  Not made to withstand much.  Disappointed to say the least.
2.0,Nice shirts. Somewhat small. Delivered to front porch and left there. The wind blew it to the yard. The box was all torn up and the shirts were all wet and muddy. Got most of the stain out but not all.
2.0,A Little disappointed in the size of the circles. They are very tiny. Looks a little cheap.
2.0,"The lace sleeves are already coming unraveled, I wouldn't suggest buying :("
2.0,"I bought these for my niece and nephew and a little over a month, bot of the zippers broke. :/ This is highly disappointing, because they both loved the jackets. Other than that, they were great, but I am highly disappointed that they didn't even last the season.<br />I can't even find a way to contact the manufacturer to get them repaired."
2.0,Returned it..
2.0,Sound and everything is great. If it fits your head. It barely fit on mine and even then only one speaker was able to cover an ear. Looks like another gift or reselling it for me sadly.
2.0,I should have read all the comments! I will be returning this item. It looks nothing like the picture!
2.0,This is a very poor quality item. Most terry cloth items imply cotton. This is a sleezy polyester. And there are no inside ties as described. I will donate it to a thrift shop and start over at a different retailer.
2.0,Not happy with this product. It's not big enough for all my gym stuff. Zippers don't move easily and snag. It doesn't fit in the lockers at my gym.
2.0,"It is not a legit Dodger jersey. The MLB website has the real jerseys for the exact same price. I wouldn’t buy again. Over all, the Jersey was in good condition, the stitching was a bit off and the name on the back was not stitched. It looks like it was just ironed on. So I’m sure it’ll peel off."
2.0,"The material doesn't feel like silk, but some sort of poly. The cufflinks center is cloth not a pearlescent plastic like the photo eludes too. They also rust stained my shirt the first time I wore them. I'll be returning this item."
2.0,"The color is pretty and the dress is comfortable. But it is not the same dress as pictured. It was a gift, so we are going to attempt to exchange it, hopefully they will send the correct dress this time."
2.0,"I bought these in medium, which is what the side charts all said my size was. I thought, “I’m not a medium. I’m definitely a large”. But the size charts said differently!! so i bought the medium. and guess what?? my gut was right!! these are WAY too small for me. NOT THE SIZE THAT IS ADVERTISED. I’m going to have to return them. Don’t get these. And if you must, size WAY up. seriously, these mediums are more like an extra small."
2.0,"I usually wear post earrings like this non-stop, unless I switch them out for something fancy.<br /><br />I would have preferred a screw back to these, because the post was bit short, didn't have a notch at the end to hold the fastener more securely, and after a week I have already lost one.<br />I have small earlobes, so that's not the problem. They just are cheaply made.<br /><br />I guess you get what you pay for. They looked nice for the six days they stayed in."
2.0,"This... Wow, what a let down this was. It's very small and it's not what I thought it was. I thought it was going to be long, but it's not. It's almost a crop top. There's also a huge bar code on the back that is not shown in the pictures. Very disappointed..."
2.0,"Sweater color is accurate, however size was not what is pictured. I ordered a large and it fit more like a medium. Definitely not oversized"
2.0,Im giving it two stars because i like the colors and design .
2.0,"This is fitted, and very tight on me."
2.0,"The glasses work very well, but the quality of the lenses is very poor so they scratch easily. I have been using them for two weeks and am already having issues seeing through the scratches. Have also been using the provided cleaning cloth and still scratches."
2.0,"This product is not true to size, very upset when I opened it. I ordered xl I usually wear large but buy xl alot so it's more flattering and  this was definitely not an xl. More like a semi bigger medium. The cups were so tiny it didn't even cover all of my boobs! And product is very cheaply made the picture looks nicer then it is in person. I would say unless you are a small figured girl with B to small C cup and not many curves then maybe try this if you dont mind a little bit cheaper look and feel. But for us curvy or thicker girls, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I only gave two stars cause it does resemble the picture and wouldnt be that bad on if it wasnt so tiny!"
2.0,"These pants fit and look great, BUT the material is an ugly shiny swimsuit type material.  Looks cheap.  So bummed, returning."
2.0,"For the money, it would be fine for a child. But there is no way a man should wear a watch this small. The strap is too short and the clock face too small. That doesn't really come across in the description or picture. Once you see it, you'll understand. I'll use this as a beater watch, outside hiking and on the trails. But this is not something I will wear daily. I have since purchased a proper watch for an adult."
2.0,Not for a bigger bust; I’m a D-cup and this gives very little support but it’s very cute.
2.0,"looks cheap. smelled weird, and looks awful on"
2.0,Nice shirt. Runs small. Too bad
2.0,Stay away !! Deer washed away on pants & hat after very first wash. Baby girl never got the chance to wear it. Would've been a super cute outfit. But u get what u pay for so I can't be disappointed. 🤷🏾‍♀️
2.0,"Okay product, bearable. The keychain broke off from the chain part 2 months after receiving product."
2.0,"The only thing that matched the product imagine was the color. The bottom was high waited but nothing like the picture. Sizing is fine. Ordered a M because I’m 130lbs, 5’2, and with small chest. Will be returning this."
2.0,"I wasn't a fan of the material, and I especially didn't like how it sat on my belly. It made my belly look much rounder than I'd have liked, as I bought it as a postpartum dress. I was super excited when I purchased it because I love the colors, but the material and fit just weren't flattering on me. I'm 5'1&#34;, and I think at the time was about 114 lbs. It might look better on me now that I'm back down to my original weight, but it just wasn't doing it for me at the time."
2.0,"This shirt is not flannel. It's a heavy twill, not soft but thick and stiff material. A good shirt if that is what you are looking for but not a soft flannel. Returned."
2.0,"In less than two weeks one of the hour designators came lose and is floating around inside.  ☹️<br />After a month another came loose, after 2 months the band came loose upon examination it was drilled off center and the watch is unrepairable"
2.0,Smaller than the other joggers they sell
2.0,These boots were so cute in person. I was so excites to get them and then to my utter dissappointment. They didnt fit. I wear a size 7.5 in everything. When i put these on my toes touched all the way to the front. I was barefoot also so there would have been no room for socks. The boots themselves were beautiful and did look way expensive. I had to send them backand there was no option for exchange for another size so that was pretty dissappointing also. I would have exchanges for an 8. Too bad. Getting my money back.
2.0,"Decent build but there was no protective wrapping, showed up broken"
2.0,You can see through the whole dress except the boob area which has 2 layers of fabric. The fit was good and would love the dress if it wasn't see through.
2.0,Wasn't was I was expecting.... I got silver with diamonds and although I got an 18g (it is small) I didn't expect the diamonds and the ring to be so dark colored and have no shine what so ever. I previously had just a silver ring and it shined a lot more than this one did (same size with no diamonds from another company). Wouldn't order again.
2.0,The color is really nice and so is the texture. The only reason I'm giving at such a low rating is that the stitching around the thumbhole's on both of them is all fraying and probably won't last long. The only thing I could do was burn the threads and hope of winning a last at least one or two wearings. We will see.
2.0,"I know shopping for shades can be tough and frustrating for those with large heads, so it's great that this exists as an inexpensive option; however, the overall quality of the product mirrors its low price point. I purchased one pair and the lower part of the frame broke after few weeks of infrequent use. I chalked it up as random chance so I went ahead and purchased another pair, and the frame broke in similar manner after less than a month. It wasn't as if I was abusing the thing, I was using it for less than 8 hours a week during my bike rides."
2.0,"This watch does not keep time.  Don't know what else to say.  Nice looking but doesn't keep time, that's all"
2.0,"Cute dress , however you need a flat tummy! Perfect for someone without rolls, material is cheap."
2.0,I really wanted this to fit my daughter but it is tiny! I’m pissed I can’t return it and I even paid for shipping!!! Should have known better!!!
2.0,This is a very cute piece but I found it really too bulky and heavy to wear on my ear.
2.0,"Didn't last long at all. The string popped within maybe a week. Maybe consider making the and a little longer, it was a little tight on my waist."
2.0,"Very thin material, wanted heavier and stronger material for outside chores but  not durable. Ok for inside, lounging I suppose"
2.0,I had to return this and this was my safety dress for an upcoming wedding. The bustline had sort of strange puckered darts that were oddly placed.
2.0,"My lil guy wears regular width shoes, but these are too narrow for him, even when we were up half a size because they don’t come in half sizes which is what he is. He did not want to keep them on and he likes wearing shoes. Definitely not for wide feet like some mentioned when they don’t fit regular width feet."
2.0,"Cute, but only got 2 wears out of it. :("
2.0,Size does not meet as mentioned
2.0,Update: stopped working and it hasn’t even been two years.<br /><br />Old review: It’s very quiet and beautiful. I like that it holds two and then stores others that don’t need to be spun!
2.0,Material isn’t great.
2.0,"These pants do not retain shape, they get stretched out after an hour of wearing them. Very uncomfortable."
2.0,"I am very disappointed, the bag rip within 2 weeks"
2.0,TERRIBLY TIGHT. My husband couldn't even get them on and he is not overweight nor does he have big legs. He has worn compression stockings for many years but I will probably send these back as even with me helping him we couldn't get them up.
2.0,I really did not like this hat but I should have known as it was really cheap.  Weird but it felt like it was made with card board.  I got what I paid for but my granddaughter was able to use it for Halloween.
2.0,The touch screen part does not work.
2.0,"This earring is very small.  It's only just large enough to fit over the edge of my ear.  The picture provided makes this earring look much better than the actual product.  I also found that the stud on this earring is slightly larger than a normal post earring, and I now have to either find a new post, or stretch my cartilage piercing to be able to wear it"
2.0,Too slouchy
2.0,This dress is really two long I am 5’2 and got the large size
2.0,"Unfortunately I had to return this dress. It makes me sad too, because I loved the colors. It was a beautiful pattern as well.<br /><br />But.... the fabric was too thin. You could almost see right thru the dress.The &#34;belt&#34; that came with it was about a half inch -1 inch piece of material.  :("
2.0,I felt frumpy in it. I thought the top would be a little more form fitting but it's quite loose and the material looks cheap. It has sheeny look to it and it's thin. Reminds me of 80s leggings! Had to return.<br /><br />For size reference: I bought the small. I'm 5'5 about 140 lbs and a 34/36 B
2.0,The holes in these shoes pinch the bottoms of my feet.
2.0,I purchased these as a retainer for my nose piercing while I had imaging and a laparoscopy done. However I purchase jewelry normally from Body Candy so I’ve been buying 20g size for about 3 years... these are more like 18g!!! It comes w many but I had to scavenger hunt the skinniest one and BUFF it with a nail file to be able to fit properly. Did not feel like doing that with the rest of the pack so it’s a loss... I recommend looking at more options if you are a size 20g
2.0,too small--- not really plus size !!!!
2.0,I wear a size 18 and the jacket barely fit.  I couldn’t comfortably button the bottom part.
2.0,The material is almost completely different from their short sleeve shirts. And the size fits smaller as well. I bought the short sleeve vneck and crew shirts and I think they're great but the long sleeve feels cheaper and runs smaller. Not certain how that works?
2.0,These are not very well made and stones fell out within days. Plastic on the back is rough and irritating. Also - not a true 10mm post. Measurement includes stone as well.
2.0,Feels like bathing suit material... I ended up wearing it as a swim dress... wanted it more for around the house
2.0,Product did not come with furry boot covers. Very disappointing!
2.0,Really liked the style however the handle drop is less than noted in description. Also hate that center zip pocket.
2.0,"Fit is super weird. Colors are as pictured, but sleeves were super loose and the overall shape is short and boxy. I’m 5’7 and it’s way shorter on me than I expected and way shorter than I like my sweaters to be. If it fit like the picture made it look I would have loved it. Disappointed to have to send back."
2.0,Very cute. But highly disappointed the product is made extremely small and arrived damaged. The straps were made incorrectly so when my daughter went to wear it for the first time the spaghetti straps actually snapped on the one shoulder before she could even properly wear it.
2.0,"These gloves were great, but quit working after laundering (without the batteries, as the instructions indicated was OK) only a few times."
2.0,"As pretty as it is, I’m going to have to adjust the clasps on the earrings and bracelet. They do no work properly. Within the first 5 minutes that I had the ratings on they were falling off because the hooks didn’t latch.<br />The bracelet does not even clamp down."
2.0,"Very cute watches, but after a few months of wear, the actual watch falls out of the &#34;band&#34;.  Also, all three of them stopped making accurate time. Even after replacing the batteries in all three, they would run either 20 minutes fast or fall behind an hour."
2.0,The material feels super cheap and doesn't fit right. I have a bit of a booty and when I wear these they give people a show when I bend over.
2.0,"They don't pull up in the back. Maybe that my bottom is too big. However the other brands I've bought in this same style fit and pull up just fine. I'll keep them though, I've got several nephews of all sizes so I'm sure they will fit fine on one of them."
2.0,Hideous. Its just a big sack. Looked 9 months pregnant in it and I'm fit.
2.0,"The description says 100% cotton and lace however the material is not cotton it is like some sort of crepe paper material, and it doesn't feel good to the skin I might add.  The lace portion of the dress is beautiful which a shame this would have been a lovely piece"
2.0,"I received a copy of these earrings, completely adhered with debris from when they poured the mixture into the mold.They didn't even try to clean it up so it looked like the original."
2.0,"Cute but came with only one strap ,,,"
2.0,"Was so excited to get these because I thought they were so cool and unique! They came very well packaged in a cute little mint green jewelry box, but when I opened up the little plastic bag I side, I was really disappointed. One earring's closure arm/fastener was already broken off, and the pair were not even symmetrical. The one with the broken fastener looked super bent. I'll be returning these. :("
2.0,"Not sure what to say here.  A bit thin, even with the lining and somewhat shapeless.  Length is perfect and I'm 5'7&#34;"
2.0,"Would fit a bcp pregnant woman great.<br />Breast area very small, stomach area too big."
2.0,Break easily😔
2.0,Not for a man.....will work well for Woman
2.0,"The anchor is pretty but this piece of jewelry is extremely difficult to get off. I spent half an hour trying to remove it with can grippers, rubber gloves, and anything else that had a good grip. Trying so many times caused the skin of my ear to come off. On the no dangle the ball is the part that screws off, however it's the opposite direction most jewelry unscrews."
2.0,Zipper broke after a few uses...
2.0,Metal turns green after two showers
2.0,I really wanted to like this shirt to wear to work but it was wayyy too small.  The ad needs to specify Asian sizes.
2.0,"UPDATE: I’ve lost 4 pairs of these already because they just randomly fall out of my ears throughout the day. I take them out when I shower and I don’t do any vigorous arobic activity or anything, so there’s no particular reason they should just keep falling out. I won’t buy these again...<br /><br />I LOVE them! If you have thick lobes these may not be for you, but they fit mine perfectly. Their nice and short and all of them are beautiful colors."
2.0,"price is right, but item does not look like picture. it is very badly painted. does not look like an eye."
2.0,"I was really excited about these pants based on the reviews, however, they didn't live up to the hype. There were many reviewers that compared these pants to the quality of Lululemon and other high-end brands. Personally, I have no idea how people are making this comparison. These pants are made very poorly, they have no compression, and the strings are already breaking and this is the first time I'm wearing them. If you are looking for a cheap pair of yoga pants, these will likely fit the bill. If you are looking for high-quality workout gear, spend your money on a quality brands like Lululemon, Nike and/or Athleta."
2.0,"The Ties are nice, but more of an Emerald Green.  I was looking for Dark Green, as the color stated.  I needed hunter green.  That is an accurate description of Dark green to me.  So, I'm not pleased with this purchase.  I will be sending the ties back."
2.0,The fabric is thin and shiny It didnt go with the dress. Kinda looks like Lycra not cute at all
2.0,Cute shirt but not Ladies sizing. I wear a L in ladies.  The XL was way too small.  Was told I could return it.
2.0,I purchased an extra small and I'm swimming in it. It's huge. I washed and dried it in the dryer and it's still twice my size. The fabric is very nice. It just shouldn't be marked xs
2.0,It's cute and comfy but I got the wrong color ordered blue got purple
2.0,"This review is for the second of two GLO Bags I have owned. The first GLO I owed maintained very well considering I stuffed it with two pair of shoes and other junk on a daily use basis. I finally had to ditch it after da wifey told me it stinks and to get it outa here! Since the first one lasted about 2.5 years thought I would order another. I really like the compartmentalization and the upright fit in most gym lockers. The second one is now 9 months old and is not holding up nearly as well as the first. Just as FYI I noticed a 'MADE IN CHINA' tag on the inside of the second one, not sure if it was there on the first. The second bag is the same in appearance, however, the workmanship on the second bag is much different than the first. The snap rivets have pulled through the material on several of the shelves and a spring wire used to keep the bag upright when it is placed on a counter is poking through at the bottom corners. This one is flimsy compared to the first. I will not try another. Needless to say I am ready to swing over to the OGIO gym locker bag due to track record for that bag when this one finally bites the dust."
2.0,"I purchased one of these vests a couple of years ago. The exterior fit-and-finish, is really great and still wear it because of that.<br /><br />However, the gun holsters, and the interior lining finish is well, frankly, crap.<br /><br />The holster straps are anchored at the edge of the holsters, making it very difficult for them to actually hold a gun in place. Because of that, this is the only vest I own that doesn't seem to like to hold a gun in place. Stopped carrying in the vest because almost every time I'd bend down the gun I was carrying would fall out.<br /><br />The velcro tabs holding the gun pockets closed, seem to be of poor quality as well. They're fraying and won't hold the pocket opening closed anymore.<br /><br />Did not get the vest on Amazon so no ""Verified purchase"", but the pictures speak for themselves as to actually owning the vest."
2.0,"I wash and dry all clothes I get before wearing them. After just one laundering, this top lost a button. It is very thin. So thin it’s see through. As in you can even see my skin through it. I ordered this as a top for work, underneath cardigans but that won’t happen.  This was disappointing for me. I ordered my normal size and it was a tad big, unusual for a button up."
2.0,"Doesn't tighten as much as the wristband that comes with the gotcha and the hole is snug. I've notice a lot of comments saying that if you tighten it too much it has a risk of popping out which hasn't happened to me yet but it does come out a lot more easily, a slight tap to the gotcha can make it pop out of the holder. The quality looks good otherwise and my BF who has a larger wrist than me will be keeping it but I will be replacing this soon."
2.0,The snap has failed after only 4 mounts.
2.0,"About the only thing that was good out of my purchase was that it came early and container it came in. Other than that -really doubt it's really 100 or 90 pcs like shown. My biggest problem,  everything you try to wear breaks into plastic particles. Made from the dreaded &#34;toasted plastic&#34; everyone hates. I rather pay $20 for 5 steel (metal) ones than to do this again...<br /><br />Altho I always make this mistake all the time"
2.0,Love the look and design.  4 months in- it broke. Not very durable.
2.0,"Had mine exactly two days before they broke on the left ear attachment arm. Great looking glasses, just not durable at all."
2.0,Not sure what clothes my toddler needs to wear to be able to fit these on.<br />It can't fit over a winter jacket (to tight) or underneath (to bulky). And my two year old has a very hard time finding the hole for her thumbs. We are not using them.
2.0,Just use tape or go to a jeweler and get a real ring guard. Overpriced. It works but so do a lot of other things...
2.0,It fits more like a skater and way longer than expected. The fabric is rayon it is not a soft T-shirt fabric like you would think. I’m still trying to decide if I wanna send it back or not
2.0,The only place the dress sat right was at my chest area. It fit like a box everywhere else and looks cheaply made. The material was also strange; felt like a mix between polyester and the material Halloween costumes are made of. I honestly expected better quality stuff on Amazon but this is some Wish quality dress
2.0,"I have a long torsonand do not like my dress shirts to stop at my belly button. If you are into crop tops, you'll love it."
2.0,"Website doesn’t not clearly identify what justifies a size. Is a large 10-12 boys? Boys 12-14? No clear definition. Now I need to return as it’s too small. Nice look, thin material."
2.0,It looks beautiful but it arrive broken. Really disappointed because I waited a month for it.
2.0,They said 7 but are too big for me!!!
2.0,Had to return. It was too tight around my thigh and I'm an average weight for my body type.
2.0,Not good. Peel at first used.
2.0,Turns
2.0,Didn’t like how the string is sewn in and can’t be removed. They are not bright in color but rather a pale almost dingy look. After first wear/wash the name on leg faded. Would not buy again.
2.0,Dress wasn’t as pictured👎🏾
2.0,I did not care for this product. The picture is adorable.. and it is light weight chiffon ruched.. It just did not look right on my body type. I really wanted to like this.. Would look much better on a tiny petite frame.
2.0,Pretty but color is changing to bronze
2.0,"I originally loved these skirts. They're very comfortable, nice fit. After washing them twice the fabric is now all fuzzy and pilled. Looks terrible."
2.0,This dress for too big. The v-neck was way to plunging as well.
2.0,"nice color.<br />It feels too small in the tip of the toes, but still slips out from the foot while walking. I will try to buy ankle padding."
2.0,"the printing quality of the shirt was .. not what I expected , the face was extremely blurry. My husband still loved the shirt I just wish we could have seen it more clear"
2.0,"This dress is beautiful, but small around my bust and had to be returned. The return is not handled by Amazon. I paid to return it and receipt by the vendor is confirmed as August 14, 2022. Amazon notes say a refund was issued, but there is no credit on my account. If I had not checked to confirm the credit was received, I would have assumed it was since I git a message from Amazon saying the refund was issued. Terrible service. I have requested an update from the seller again since Amazon does not/will not provide a refund from this vendor.<br /><br />Update! A refund was received after I showed proof if delivery of the return."
2.0,I didn’t know that I needed a power source for the the gloves to operate
2.0,These are pretty earrings nice presentation. The problem is the backing. I definitely wanted screw backs that's why I purchased these particular pair of earrings. However I can barely even hold the back between my fingers they are so very small. I have very small fingers so you wouldn't think there would be an issue but there is!!! I hate the thought of putting them in because its such a project!!! I would not recommend this product and I am sorry for that because they're are really pretty =(  just not worth the effort!!!
2.0,"Wont stay on the bra straps as I put on my bra.  I have never heard of sweating under a bra strap but, they make me sweat under them..... they dont breath."
2.0,"I can't fathom the thought that basically everyone who owns these shoes are 100% satisfied. I begin to think I'm crazy or delusional. Nonetheless, these shoes were absolutely awful for my comfort.<br /><br />They were 1 size larger of a feel (aka way too big) and extremely uncomfortable. The ankle area kept digging into my skin like a cast. I kept asking other consumers if they faced this issue and no one could answer.<br /><br />The worst issue I faced was the arrival of the shoes. They were scuffed and filthy. I contacted the seller who clearly made me feel like a lying scam artist.<br /><br />I ALSO asked the seller for advice if maybe I was doing something wrong when wearing these, all they could really say was just return them.<br /><br />Bummer!!"
2.0,Good enough to take on a trip for 1 time use.
2.0,The small tags(make/female in photo) are blank and my “girl” elephant has a chip
2.0,Definitely not as pretty as advertised picture. Beads are pretty dull and cheap looking. Would not purchase again.
2.0,Too big and hard to breathe through
2.0,Very cheaply made. It will start to rust and become an off orange color. Not a good look.
2.0,They are painted which i didnt realize and after 2 days tge paint chipped off the rings. Not what i was hoping for. But are comftorable!
2.0,"I got the black. The pants are printed skin tight spandex leggings, not a loose pant as pictured. The top is shorter than pictured, more like a form fitting short sleeve tee that sits just below the back side, not as close to mid thigh as pictured. This would work possibly as a lounge set for home. The only thing the same as the pic is the print, not the fit. And I'm not at all very big - 5'2&#34; and 130 lbs. Returned the set. Very disappointed in the misrepresentation."
2.0,"These suspenders are much shorter than I expected them to be, so they barely fit me. As for the bow tie, it's too big. I'm sorry to say this, but I didn't like this purchase."
2.0,"While I received what I ordered I was disappointed about the quality of the tattoos, most ripped just trying to take the plastic covering off of them to apply them."
2.0,"Way too big, doesn't really look like the picture either."
2.0,Looked like the pic but weird material. Not comfy material.  Also is way to small
2.0,sizing is crazy. size reported to be a 10 was more like a 22. could have put 2 of me in it. 3x is xxxlarge not szxe 10.!
2.0,"The ring is beautiful, however, I wear a size 6.25 and this ring is not true to size. Then the connection piece has the rings so close together that my ring would not fit in between. I'm sending it back and ordering a different one hopefully the next one will fit better."
2.0,"I felt like it was tight for a medium. It was also made out of cheap material, and I was expecting more because of the price I had to pay for it. It’s a very itchy material, so be cautious of that. I wouldn’t buy it again, although it worked fine for my Where’s Waldo costume for Halloween."
2.0,Shades were poorly made. Had to bend the frame to make it fit securely
2.0,The cord that keeps it tight at the waist cane out on the second use. Very visible and lightweight so great for running but useless without the cord.
2.0,They move out of place all the time.
2.0,When I first got the charm it was beautiful. Becoming a grandmother for the 1st time I was excited when I saw this charm. Received as promised and it looked spectacular on my Pandora bracelet however after 1 week the color started to change and now it's just brown. Glad I didn't pay much for this. My grandson is here and I'm going to go buy an authentic Pandora charm.
2.0,"The neck is too high and the arm holes that make the 'cold shoulder' are too deep.<br />Poorly proportioned.<br />I couldn't be bothered sending it back, so I gave it away."
2.0,Cute but they dont last long. They bunch up after washing and drying.
2.0,When i wear this watch i get a dead skin on my wrist
2.0,Ended up being too long and uncomfortable. I took it out around 28 weeks.
2.0,"I liked these goggles very much when I first got them. I'm a serious, daily lap swimmer, and found after a week that the goggles leaked and the nose bridge clip kept unsnapping - you can snap it back together, but it's annoying to go from crawl to backstroke in a 50 meter pool and have to stop to reclip your bridge back together. So they are my back ups only."
2.0,I bought this for pictures.  Its huge! Also too wide and not long. Just not good.
2.0,I love the color and the lace but I picked my exact size and it ended up feeling like a small when I bought a large
2.0,"...makes a swishing sound when I walk. I guess it must have something to do with thick thighs, I don't know. The noise of my thighs swishing was enough to make me worry about people hearing it, so back they go."
2.0,Es demasiado pequeño le quedo como blusa a mi hija no importa el size que elijas sale pequeño.<br /><br />Al parecer es para niñas menores de 6 anos y que sean bajitas.<br /><br />Sobre la calidad es buena y es bonito pero muy pequeño.
2.0,"Not impressed. Has a ""Tinny "" look to the finish."
2.0,"I got these for my three and five year olds to protect their ears when playing the drums and for an upcoming concert they're going to. They do protect their hearing but they are nearly impossible for my kids to put on by themselves, even I have a tough time getting them on their heads and they are SO tight on their heads they can only wear them a short time before they're unbearable. They also get stuck and tangled in their hair every time they go to remove them. I wouldn't recommend these."
2.0,"Quality is pretty good for the price, that's why I gave 2 stars. However, the fit is way off. I'm a true American size small, not tiny Asian size small, and this is still way too big on me. I can't even get it hemmed, because all over from the pants width to the jacket sleeves etc is too large. Not worth the effort to fix it. Too bad because the quality was nice for the price."
2.0,Did not fit as shown
2.0,Short... some had kinks... just not good...
2.0,"My grandson loves this shirt but I doubt it will last. The stitching on the hem is loose and likely will come out. The neckband is twisted. Overall, the quality of the sewing is poor."
2.0,Not clear
2.0,Ordered a size larger than I usually wear bc of the reviews. I am 5’6” 130 lbs and ordered a large. It is still WAY too short and see through!
2.0,Doesn’t fit like in the picture is too long
2.0,They are adorable and my daughter loves them but was sad when one of the loops at the top popped off the third time she wore them.
2.0,It was pretty but it broke even with gentle wear.
2.0,Loved this bracelet so much.... Wore it about a week and a half and it broke while walking the mall.... :/ I was so sad.
2.0,They break easy when you open or close them too much to adjust the size
2.0,"I'm only 5'5&#34; but the front was extremely short on me, probably 3 inches from showing my underwear. I had to return it. If the front was longer I would have kept it in a heart beat"
2.0,It said order a size up which I did. I normally wear 8-8 1/2 I ordered a size 9/10 thinking I have a little space to be comfortable. They were so tight on my feet. I ended up returning them and I hardly ever do returns.
2.0,"316L my ass. My nose/upper lip turned green almost right away. I can't find clickers in any of my local shops so I thought I'd give online shopping a try and I regret it. It's cute, but you can only wear it for a short time if you don't want to be green."
2.0,I like the fabric. But the button snap at waist has a sharp ridge that pokes into skin. Returning.
2.0,It's look nice if it works ..it will work for a day then it starts moving slow or dont work at times
2.0,"I love the color of this shirt (blue) but hate the fit. It rides up throughout the day and I find myself constantly adjusting it. I got an XXL to prevent a bad fit  because I have large boobs, but it didnt help. I dont think the sizing is for large breasted women (40 D). Dont believe the size chart.<br />I also bought it in white hoping it was a fluke and this one will fit better but it did the same thing. I will not be purchasing anything from this company again."
2.0,"All the pieces were there, but adult size runs small. My husband is 5'9"" 140 lbs. I ordered a medium, needed a large or XL. It is a costume, so it's thin. Not sure what you would wear underneath???  Not bad for a costume, but not great either."
2.0,"These tanks fit pretty small, if your looking for a loose fit tank top, or if your an average size man, these are not for you"
2.0,I guess you get what you pay for - Kind of cheap looking - Compared to my letter Pandora charm
2.0,Buyer beware - this product is BYOB. You have to bring your own baby.
2.0,"Loved the  Color, sunflowers are my favorite flower but what got me to return it was the plastic decal they used for the flower.  It is very stiff not sure how it would hold up after several washings.  I returned it"
2.0,"I really wanted to like these, but they arrived defective with multiple small holes in the socks. The compression is very minimal making them simply defective colorful socks."
2.0,"No zipper in the back so it's a tug n war to get over your head,in the description it says zipper on the back"
2.0,Their is the weirdest fitting shirt.  I’m 6’1 and ordered a large.  The large is unusually long!  Looks goofy!
2.0,It was a very cute picture and the color is great. I was hoping to use this as my Christmas dinner dress but it came and the material is not what I expected and it is very large.
2.0,Hat does as nice as pictured. Strong plastic smell. Does not fit well around hat given folds around.
2.0,"I wear a large but ordered an XL just in case.  It was very snug, too small.  It felt like a medium."
2.0,Did not fit my watch too big
2.0,"Comfortable and looks good, however the one clasp is completely stuck and will not release without me prying it lose with a knife, which of course is damaging my gear fit. Other clasp releases just fine....."
2.0,Give it a 2 cause of the material it wasn’t a nice cotton material hate it
2.0,I bought this for my girlfriend since she loves dandelion poofs. It was an instant hit and she loved piece. I’m sad to say the quality of this piece is pretty bad because the necklace broke within a couple weeks. She only got to wear the necklace maybe 4 times before the pendant fell out of the metal wire that holds it. I’m pretty disappointed because my girlfriend loved this necklace.
2.0,I ordered x large cause I am pretty much all boob and that size didn't even fit.....
2.0,"I ordered this necklace a few years ago and loved it - so pretty.  A friend also admired it every time she saw me wearing it, so i bought one for her when her birthday rolled around.  It is no longer the same necklace.  It is a different color and shorter.  They need to update the picture, as their vendor has &#34;updated&#34; the style.  The seller was good about responding to my question, and I have other pieces from them that I enjoy wearing."
2.0,This is a gold case with a PINK band. The package even states it’s pink.
2.0,"As a person who typically wears Mens M-L or womens xl-2xl, there’s no way this a mens costume. Will be returning, surely disappointed."
2.0,Nice design and good quality but description states clip with post. These do not have a post.
2.0,It was dirty when I took it out the package
2.0,"The inside of it is white and made out of the material that comes off, itches really bad"
2.0,"I'm not certain how the leather neck strap is supposed to fasten to the apron. If you look at the pictures provided you will notice that there isn't a buckle or button. There are two brass prongs that push into the leather strap but they pull out immediately. I thought that I might be missing a fastener but after inspecting the photo I ascertain that it's just poorly designed.  I also would question the fabric's description as ""Heavy Duty Canvas"". The fabric is far from heavy duty and could stand to have a higher thread count."
2.0,"This wallet started out okay but now it is bulky and lumpy, like several pillows in a pair of yoga pants and the snap on the outside is not staying closed. So my wallet is always sitting open. Not kewl... It has alot of slots for credit and business cards and ID's. And that is why I got this wallet. Now you might say I have too much in my wallet but when I cleaned the old wallet out I only put part of my stuff back into the new wallet. So very disappointed. I took a while to change to this wallet because I hate changing out my wallet or purse. I would probably send it back if I hadn't waited to use this product"
2.0,Cute but way too small. I'm usually a small/medium and a large was still too small.
2.0,"These, while having a cute pattern, seem more polyester and plastic (like a table clothe). They may work for painting and crafts, but I would not want to use them near a stove."
2.0,Very cheaply made. Trying to put them on during a quick rainstorm resulted in ripped ponchos and wet concertgoers.
2.0,"material is paper thin, runs small and I even got a size bigger than I normally wear<br />wouldnt buy again and wouldnt recommend"
2.0,"LOVE THE STYLE AND COLOR, IT IS VERY TIGHT!!!!!"
2.0,cute style but the thin material doesn't seem to work well with the buttons and it runs a couple sizes small if it should fit like the picture. The XL fit like a glove and that's not the look I wanted.
2.0,"Navy color is very pretty. Material is nice; soft and thick enough. There is a gold sheen when you stretch the fabric. Arm holes are smaller/tighter than expected. Length is as expected.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel the neckline is a little to high and the way it makes the top area look just doesn't lend to an overall complementary style. I wasn't looking to have ""the girls"" hang out but think the neckline would be where your average cute tank falls, not so high on the chest."
2.0,"Bought the XX-large, it was a bit too tight and not at all as pictured. Was sort of just like a long sleeve work-out or pajama top. I'm short (5'2&#34;) and the front was inches shy of being a crop top while the &#34;long&#34;  back hit only at my natural waist. However, the material was actually really nice thick jersey (that kind that feels great to wear for pajamas but clings to your body). I'd say if you are petite or a smaller size, the XL-XXL might fit like a shorter version of the picture."
2.0,Truly disappointed in how this fit. It was simply too big even though I bought extra small. I will now have to pay a tailor to adjust to my size.
2.0,I ordered this along with the black leather bracelet from the same seller. I'm returning this one because the other one from the same brand broke immediately and I'm concerned about the quality of this one as well. It's definitely a lot more flimsy then the Pandora bracelet.
2.0,"OMG, size is more for juniors than women. Too small, I wear a xxl, bought it ended up giving it to my 13 year old, slim daughter. Not happy...."
2.0,Insert iRx broke without touching it
2.0,"I ordered these as Christmas masks. The description indicated they were red and green, but the colors were really off. The red was more like a rust color. The green was ok, but the decorations on it were not even close to red."
2.0,Returned it - too large but it was cute
2.0,I was very excited to order this item because it was recommended by several Instagram style influencers.  I tried it on immediately when it arrived and was disappointed with the quality of the material.  It is soft and stretchy but the quality just felt cheap.  It added a lot of bulk in my opinion and was not very flattering.  This one is going back.
2.0,"The shirt is nice, great material and design but the size is super small for a large."
2.0,"It comes in a month later, the lace only covers your forehead, and you have to be extremely careful not to pick out the nicks from the lace or the whole thing will come apart. If you're going to take photos, hold it at an angle on your forehead so it covers your eyes. I gave it two stars because the head band piece is also small. It won't go behind my ears fully. It sits slightly above it."
2.0,"SUNGAIT is clearly run by smart people. The packaging is top notch and the customer service is even better. If only they invested more in design and materials. These glasses feel about as cheap as they come, and the design is very lacking. They do offer a full refund if you don't like them, so if thrift items are your thing you may as well try them."
2.0,Much bigger on my face than expected
2.0,The lanyard work okay. However the are very thin.  The lanyard itself could be a little thicker.
2.0,"This tool is not the greatest option for holding the balls for my ear piercing jewelry. I purchased it so that I might be able to change my jewelry out on my own, but it just doesn't cut it. The tines are to long and awkward so it's of no use to me. :-/ It will probably serve a better purpose for working on my cars."
2.0,"An ok blouse, but not for me. Runs very big, so you might want to order down a size."
2.0,It's nothing like the one in the picture.
2.0,Not True to Size very Small. I Return it & still have not Received My Refund. I had to Pay $16.00 for return Shipping!!! OMG. & it was a very Dingy White Cheap Material.
2.0,"The color was drastically different and while the company gave me a 10% discount, I couldn't return it without paying (the expensive) shipping back to China because of their disclaimer about the color changing from item to item.  In the picture, it is a bright beautiful blue, but in reality, it's hard to even see the watch-hands because they are very dark, like a midnight blue.  Then it stopped working and I had to request a full refund anyway."
2.0,Horrible and very stiff. Hated it and it feels awful
2.0,I purchased this back in February to match a hoodie with the same pink logo. The cap was  blue and pink in the logo and the back of the cap was Velcro
2.0,"The green glitter came off after about 2 days off wearing the ring, it is now just a black ring! Very very disappointing! They could have solved this problem by adding a thin clear coat to it, so much potential yet it still needs some tweaking before it is a nice ring!"
2.0,These were made of cheap stretchy fabric and are beyond too small in sizing. Almost like a lycra legging than anything. I would be embarrassed to wear these as a business pant to work.
2.0,"I wanted to love this product, but after just a couple of washes, it became slightly see through, making it impossible to use."
2.0,Rides up and doesn't fit as well as other styles
2.0,Way too big in the shoulders. Looked like a moo moo.
2.0,They did not send the right size I ordered 14 16s and they sent me 10 12s but they were comfortable fabric was nice.
2.0,"We loved these, but a screw came out after less than a month of light wear and tear."
2.0,They were too small and I had to return them
2.0,"I bought 3 of the 30 - 36 and after &#34;Trim to fit If the belt is too long for you, you can trim the strap length to fit your size&#34; the first belt I then used it as a guide to trim the other two. One of the three belts Automatic Ratchet insert on the inside of the leather belt was off by 1 inch. I assume all three belts were fabricated with the same quality control.....not true. So now one of the three belts is to tight around my waist and cannot use."
2.0,They were beautiful while they lasted.<br />The more I wore them the looser they got. Now they fall out of my ears within a few minutes
2.0,Color way off and it doesn't go off shoulder like picture
2.0,Bought this as a gift for a friend - it came oddly packaged in a small box that was dirty and had (what I hoped was an unused) guitar pick inside. The bracelet itself is smaller than expected and harder to open than we hoped for. The fit bit fits nicely inside but wasn't worth the money.
2.0,Less cushion
2.0,"I wear size 6.5 to 7, hence ordered these in size 7. They are too small and to make matters worse, the plastic (yes, it is made of really hard, stiff plastic not rubber or jelly) is so hard that it scrapes my skin and toes a lot. I have many blisters just from wearing them for three days."
2.0,"Glasses were fine, but came in MOLDY packaging. Yuck!"
2.0,Broke after 3 uses.  Cheap junk.
2.0,"Okay, very well packaged but very weak materials. They lasted long enough to cover her toes and then the ripping started. Apparently, made for short people with tiny feet. An eleven year old child couoldn.t even attempt to get them on even though she was very cautious at wearing stockings (up and coming model). For us a total waste."
2.0,"* Poor quality<br />* not vivid colors as pictured<br />* No ""saggy layer"" in the back, is a straight beanie--not a beret type--"
2.0,"This mask is very small. It barely covers my nose and mouth. Also, the strings on the side are very long and do not stay tight. Save your money. 2 stars because the mask looks good. Too bad it doesn’t fit properly."
2.0,"The sleeves are oddly wide and long, yet with wrist cuffs that are snug, making the sleeves look like parachute pants — not a good look. The fabric texture isn’t good, and lint and hair stick to it easily. It was cheap but still a waste of money since I’ll never wear it."
2.0,"This is a nice looking bar, but the quality is bad. After a while of wearing it, the other end of the arrow was turning green. It would have given me an infection. I had to replace it. I do love the way the arrow looks, I just can't continue to wear it."
2.0,The hats were folded in the package. So had has a horrible shape with creases. What a mess!
2.0,"The back of the cutout says ""class of 2021"" in small lettering.  The shapes are not symmetrical so if you try to double up it the backsides will still show somewhat.  The glue dots included are not sticky/sturdy enough to hold the weight of the cutout so you will need to use your own tape/glue."
2.0,The bottom of the dress is weird. The corners poof out.
2.0,Looks different in the model<br />The top was loose<br />The shorts fit perfectly<br />The clothes was not lined so you  to wear something under or else it will show.
2.0,"I really liked the material and the design, but the jacket ran soooooo small. I am a 14 and ordered the next to largest. And they charged me for the more expensive design, but sent me the less expensive design. I had to send it back."
2.0,Did not meet expectations. Find if you are a size zero. But this was supposed to be for a plus size body. Not! Gave it away.
2.0,Has to be a completely flat surface. Randomly falls off. Temperature sensitive. Good for putting your phone on the mirror in the bathroom but not much else.
2.0,"The biggest issue I have with this product is that the ends of the sleeves perpetually roll into little bands that cut into my arm. This is a compression top, therefore supposed to be tight-fit, and to have such a flimsy and uncomfortable aspect to it makes it only tolerable for a short time period. I have a few other brands that are much more comfortable and with which I do not have this issue, so it is avoidable."
2.0,I suppose the price reflects the quality. Very thin material.
2.0,Made of pretty cheap plastic...
2.0,Very little and a headache to lock to my ear...once you get it on is cute if u want very small earning...
2.0,"It is a nice dress, nice material, but XL? C'mon, get real!<br />After trying it on, we gave it to a MEDIUM size person. It is a bit tight on her, but tolerable--at least before washing it."
2.0,ARMS reach down to the middle of my thigh.
2.0,Runs big. Looks and feels cheap!
2.0,I didn’t like because it’s not cotton for my baby 6 months
2.0,Loved the design of the jersey but XXL was way too small for me and I'm a slim guy who typically wears L-XL. I had to return it.
2.0,Not yellow at all more orange plus shipping took twice as long as intended.
2.0,"The colour is way off. The pink that I got, looks very much like peach. The sizing is somewhat as expected. But the shape of the bottom is not as the photo here, it is a lot straighter. Not the nice asymmetrical hemline like the photo.<br />No need to say, I will be returning this tomorrow."
2.0,I ordered an xl saying it is a 18/16 but it is more like a 12/14 and it is very thin.
2.0,"It is a very cheap looking watch. The band may be leather but if it is, it’s veneered. It will not hold up to daily wear. I would not recommend buying it."
2.0,Purchased these June 2017. One of the side arm pieces broke on me the other day. Completely snapped off like a cheap pair of sunglasses.
2.0,"I've really enjoyed other Berchirly products (I bought a messenger bag that's held up--albeit with a fair amount of Duck Tape--through most of my undergrad program), but this one's strap broke off quickly and doesn't have a good mechanism for a personal repair. Otherwise, the bag is fine, but, since the whole point of the bag is to be able to wear it, I'd say it didn't live up to my expectations.<br /><br />It broke in about two months of pretty light use."
2.0,Was very impressed with the look of these earrings until the stones started falling out after being worn 3 times! Not happy ☹️
2.0,Cute but fit is waaayyy to small
2.0,"AMENDED REVIEW:<br />Below is what I said before I actually handled the bracelet, never even got to wear mine, I moved it twice in my jelewry box and the next time I touched it, was to wear it and it broke! I have no idea how it happened, just fell apart in my hands.<br /><br />I ordered eight, I received eight, took about two weeks to get. I bought them for wedding party gifts.<br /><br />When I opened the package and held the bracelet it felt like more plastic then fabric.<br /><br />You definitely get what you pay for."
2.0,"I disliked the fabric.  I thought it was going to be leather, but instead it was more like a vinyl material that wasn't worth the cost."
2.0,Did not look anything like the pants in the photo when i received them😔 very dissappointed
2.0,"When they sized this up from the sample, they only sized up the outside.  The neckline on the model is wide, nearly off the shoulder, but the XXL is almost a crewneck.<br />Fabric is nice though.  Not too short."
2.0,I believe I would have been better off if I went shopping to find a much better quality apron.  The material is very thin and artwork is not sophisticated at all.  I would not recommend this to anyone.
2.0,"I looked at the pictures and the reviews, and these shoes are mostly what I expected for the price. The quality isn't great. I'll be returning them because the color looked nothing like the picture in the description, and actually nothing like the other user pictures. I ordered the taupe but received a light grey. They seem okay for the price, though."
2.0,"I love the first picture of that thick fabric warm cozy sweater - don't know where the modle got that one from....<br />This thing is thin and not as cozy, warm or magical.... also has oddly cut sleeves -.-<br />Would not reccomend"
2.0,Almost impossible to get it separated without scratching the ion plating.
2.0,was hoping it would be much more 'flowy' than it is.
2.0,"Not impressed at all. Like another reviewer, these are NOT ankle socks as I had hoped, nor are they all cotton.  Yes, they do have cotton in them but they also have acrylic and spandex. There isn't a cuff at all & the top of the sock cuts in deeply. Would NOT recommend these to anyone with any kind of leg/ankle circulation issues. Not really sure what the &#34;cute animal&#34; is on the gray pair or any other pair!! These were not what I had hoped or expected. Very disappointed!!"
2.0,"I ordered color ""D Green"". The color was exactly as shown, but that's the only positive I have. These are cheap drawstring shorts. They are not quality cotton material. They do not hold their shape at all.  They bunched up and wrinkled after just sitting down dinner. Even after taking them off and hanging them up, they were still bunched and wrinkled. Quite dissappointed."
2.0,Very short in the arms and tight for an XL.
2.0,Bought for my 12 yr old daughter because she loves dream-catchers and she says they are very uncomfortable and will never wear them.
2.0,"I don't like leaving less-than-stellar reviews, but one can always hope the manufacturer might make changes.  These slippers are a good value and very comfortable.  The challenge is that they are really extra roomy in the 'dorsal' area (top of the foot, opposite of the arch) so they tend to actually slip off when I am walking up my stairs, which is about 10 times a day.  I have big feet (size 10 womens) and high arches, so typically shoes run tighter on me.  I figure if these are so super loose on MY feet, they would not do well for those with narrower feet.  Other than that, they are great - if you just walk or shuffle you won't have an issue.  It's just the act of lifting my feet that causes them to slip off.  Annoying when you are walking up the stairs holding things, which is often for me."
2.0,fit small then after first wash it was smaller .. this is not worth it
2.0,"I love the boots It looks very nice ,unfortunately I have to return it ,I usually wear size 7 and I order 7,30 to be on the safe side but it didn’t fit ,I couldn’t even get my foot in it !"
2.0,Doesn’t compress much.
2.0,They did not last long but they are great.
2.0,No me gusto no especificaba que era de plástico
2.0,I love this jacket however it most likely not United States sizing because and extra large is still tiny. Sooooo disappointed.
2.0,studded gem scratches the top of my mouth
2.0,The length is shorter. There was a thread in my vinyl behind the image...I should shouldn't have pulled it.  it pulled off the lettering
2.0,I really like the material but they are NOT one size fits all. They are huge. I have a lot of extra room at the finger tip. I’m a petite woman but my hands aren’t super small or anything.
2.0,"The GLASSES ARE GREAT and well made, but you have to have the right Rx glasses or they will not fit properly - because there is no nose piece.  There is no rim on the bottom and the top rim must ride on the top of your prescription glasses rim - if they are small glasses, the sunglasses just will not ride right.  It also distorted vision a bit.  Get the regular glasses and you will see that they are a 5-star"
2.0,"While the shield looks cool, the arm braces are flimsy. They are barely tack welded on and one broke off the first day I had it."
2.0,"These bralettes are really cute, but extremely elastic-y and basically compress you. I am a 36B and ordered the XL (which came with a label of XXL on the bralettes themselves) and they are still a little too tight after taking the padding out. They're probably fine for things like yoga, hiking, climbing, etc. if you're trying to hold everything in, but not comfortable enough for everyday wear."
2.0,"I love the shirt and I read reviews that the shirt runs small so I ordered at least two sizes larger to avoid disappointment, however, it was still too small."
2.0,Bad quality belt not what i expected the buckle is the only thing im saving to put in a real leather belt
2.0,"As I planned to wear these under something, they are still very see through."
2.0,The shoulder strap connector broke immediately on using it. The handles are beginning to fall apart.<br />I liked the shape of the purse but it is not study enough for every day use
2.0,Not for long use but ig it gets the job done
2.0,"The chain is so pretty, but the second time I wore it the chain broke.  I am glad it broke at home and not at work, would be more upset if the charm had gotten lost."
2.0,"Very dissapointed, this broke within a less than a week of setting it up. The ends on the framing are flimsy. Waste of the money, unfortunately."
2.0,great robe but ordered black and it came in dark blue
2.0,"Pants dont fit like they should, way too tight in areas they shouldnt be, and even ordered a size up. Definitely not happy with the quality."
2.0,"Looks really cute, but not durable by any means!  It was broken within the first 5 minutes, did not even make it to school working.  The wires pulled right out of the battery pack when my child was trying to take it out of the pouch to turn it off.  Definitely not durable for kids. We had one very disappointed kid."
2.0,The bandanas frayed after being laundered (before wearing) and I had to steam iron every single bandana due to extreme wrinkling.  The color assortment was good.
2.0,"I wouldn't recommend buying this brand. It is not a contemporary fit, very scratchy; reminds me that like a lot of other things that are made in China, it's probably best to stick with American brands."
2.0,Super big. Will have to wait until she's a toddler.
2.0,The color was off. I had to send it back. It also felt very cheap.
2.0,"Very high around the armpits - not flattering. The dress would be better if the armholes were deeper and/or adjustable so the whole dress could hang lower on the torso. As it is, it's a little too high and looks like a potato sack. It was cheap so I'll wear it for the wedding I'm attending, but it's not flattering and I'm disappointed. I'm 5'9&#34; 140lbs.<br /><br />The blue color has more brown than cream as a base."
2.0,"The dress is too small. It is not a regular size dress. The material is not nice. Also , the print is not a good print like the picture. And the seller doesn't  do returns. So , I am stuck with a dress that is way too small. I will never shop with this seller again."
2.0,"The 7 mm fit beautifully, but within 3 days my nose was irritated and infected 😩"
2.0,This covers everything but lacks support. Does not prevent your breast from jumping/bouncing around. Cute & fits perfect that's about it.
2.0,Well made but not XL. Ordered an XL and received items that are more like a size M. I wear a size large/16-18 in tops.
2.0,"I should have read the product description rather than relying on the photo- I thought I was getting an Elvis portrait pendant, but instead got the Taking Care of Business logo. The image of the product should be changed to reflect the actual necklace that you're getting."
2.0,"Difficult to insert and does not hold securely on my small lobe;  that was one of the reasons purchased, the size.  Will keep, too troublesome to return and not a bank breaker."
2.0,It's cute but runs so small
2.0,caught in bath netting and broke 1st day I wore it. It is very pretty
2.0,"OMG I was so impressed with these shoes when I saw them on someone else. The sole is great, the upper part of the shoe doesn’t have any padding."
2.0,Probably would order 2 sizes up.
2.0,Only if they lasted longer
2.0,"When my watch died, I thought this would be a good temporary watch to use until I have a chance to shop for a new one.  The case and band have a finish that looks like shiny black lacquer paint, not anodized metal, so there is no mistaking that this is a $25 watch.  Don't know how the photographer got the matte look in the product photos.  The entire watch and band were covered in a heavy shrink wrap material that adhered tightly to the surface and took several minutes working with a knife blade to remove.  The showstopper for me was the pin removal tool provided to remove links in the band, the reason I ordered this model.  The intended method to use this tool was very unclear, and it broke instantly when I tried to use it.  Not interested in paying a jeweler to adjust the band of a $25 watch.  This product is going back.<br /><br />UPDATE 8/22/18: Since I posted my review, I notice this product has been flooded with 5-star reviews that are not marked &#34;Verified Purchaser.&#34;  Don't be fooled by fake reviews."
2.0,"I don’t know about anyone else — these t-shirts like many other “soft” “slouchy” stonewashed LOOK IN PHOTOS are not even close. More like boxy, stiff, cheap! Please vendors! Please Amazon!<br />Get real with your product representation. Out of 20 or plus summer clothing items I purchased this summer I’ve had to return/ exchange ( size not accurate/ fabric not as shown/ not even close to photo 17 times?! I kid you not! Hey Bezos come doen from space and get your Company Right! Pls."
2.0,I bought 2 different styles of Dinosaur Train slippers for my grandson.Both pairs bottoms were worn through within two weeks.(only worn inside house on bare floors.)The slippers are cute and my grandson loved them but they are not durable enough.They should be made with leather or rubber bottoms instead of thin cotton blend material.
2.0,Didn’t really like the material and it fit slightly large<br />Returned
2.0,"Way too long, need to shorten"
2.0,"I was so excited about this shirt. I bought it a size bigger then I normally wear but it was smaller then I hoped it would be. And it is polyester. I hate polyester, it’s hot. So I returned it."
2.0,"The time it took was excellent but the product did not match the picture when I open the product and it look light blue not dark navy as I see in the photo I was mislead and disappointed at the same time. Very UNHAPPY ABOUT THIS THANKS ALOT!  :,-("
2.0,Broke after the wife wore it twice. Material is not very strong at all. Looks great but you might loose it quickly.
2.0,"THIS IS A NON traditional, but very pretty bracelet  with various tones on pink and red on it and a fun, wrap around design.  It is pure fun, unless you are bothered by the cancer and reproduction warnings."
2.0,"The color in the picture is vintage looking, but the actual boot is not AT ALL like in the picture. I’m returning them."
2.0,This was not a quality product. The stitching wasn't uniform and the material was thin.
2.0,"It would have been a Merry Christmas if the watch wasn't broken! It keeps time, but the knob to change the day of the week, wouldn't change! It was stuck on Monday! I followed the instructions on Amazon to return the watch. It didn't cost me a penny and my money was refunded within 24 hours. (edited review)"
2.0,"Got this as a gift for my 11 years old son. He loved it and it fit well, but the clasp broke in 3 days. No way to repair it."
2.0,Headband was missing.
2.0,"Fake leather, fake/cheap metal, the Eagle head is very lose and spins around a lot. Other than the talon charms, this is only worth maybe $10 at most."
2.0,Eh. Not the best quality.  Could have made one for cheaper than I paid for this but just didn’t have the time to make my own.  It served its purpose but price doesn’t match quality
2.0,"I liked these shorts very much, but there was a major design flaw. The wide elastic was too big for the tunnel it sat in, and it was not sewn into the fabric. As a result, the elastic waist did not sit flat, kept twisting and turning upside down, and the shorts sat unevenly on my waist, they were uncomfortable and looked terrible. I tried to make the elastic sit flat from the outside but it kept turning over and twisting pulling up which made the shorts unwearable. I eventually tried to trim the elastic and sew it in place myself but that didn't work, so I had to threw the shorts out. Uncharacteristic of me, but these shorts were so frustrating!"
2.0,"It looks lovely, however it’s not made tough!<br />The front pouches zipper broke off before she even had a chance to use it!<br />I’m beyond disappointed and glad we doing another to replace it quickly."
2.0,I have normal sized D cup breasts and I’m average weight and height and ordered a medium. It feels like it’s a petite size because the waistline seam is right under my nipples when it should be a good 2 or 3 more inches lower. And this is with my bra on with my breasts properly supported. It’s not a size too small because the rest of it fits me just fine. This had potential but the waistline seam is too high. I feel I’m either too tall for it at only 5’4 or it is simply too short. I just want a flowy dress that is not an unflattering sack on me and I don’t think it exists.
2.0,Not very well made. Had strings dangling all over the hems. It’s very thin so you have to wear a slip. The neck is so low cut that your slip will show unless you pin it together.
2.0,It was of poor quality.. after one wash it looked like it had been washed repeatedly..
2.0,Fabric not soft.  Returned
2.0,"After using for 3 weeks, the sewing on the front pocket started to come loose.  I put a safety pin on it to hold it together.  Then the zipper broke.  I don't think I was overloading it.... just put my phone and wallet in there."
2.0,The legs are way too tight!!  They fit well - they are just SO TIGHT in the legs that you feel like something is pulling at your skin.
2.0,"it is an awesome design, looks cool, but it stopped working the first week i had it.i thought about returning it, but i do like the artwork of the piece, so i never bothered."
2.0,"The ring is too uncomfortable to wear, the earring is only comfortable for a specific sized ear.. not a problem for me, as I bought it for the ring, but buyers might want to take that into consideration before dropping the money on this item."
2.0,Ordered the hat for a costume. Nice sturdy hat and looks nice. I ordered a small but received a large. Big difference in size.  Very disappointed. If I'd gotten the correct size I would have given 4 stars. Maybe even 5. It's too late to return now.
2.0,Not comfortable....and it’s itchy!<br />Slips down off the face!
2.0,does not run true to size!!  I am a 8-10 and the medium is way too small!
2.0,Way too small. I will be returning.
2.0,It looks better on webpage than it really is! I have to return it.
2.0,No 2nd strap in the box. Arrived with much oxidation. Presentation box looked awful. It appears to be a used watch sold as new but I can't attest to it.
2.0,After few months of usage the band just broke and tear.<br />Looks like the leather is just the cover not all the way.
2.0,"The ring was not bright and sparkly like it was in the picture. I ordered a size 6, but it was at least an 8."
2.0,"I had to super glue the band to the watch as it kept disconnecting, but then the super glue would wear off (99¢ super glue). Replaced the pins with the original band pins, and haven't had a issue since."
2.0,The lining inside these socks bunches up under your toes.  It's very uncomfortable.
2.0,"Quality of cloth and snaps are very good, until second wash in cold water, gentle cycle, gown ripped down one side about 16 inches, not along any seam. Just tore!! Very disappointed."
2.0,The bracelet  was really cute at first but then it started to change colors
2.0,Dress fit perfectly but so bummed I had to return it because of poor stitching
2.0,"I love the colors and the fit isn't bad in terms of true to size but the material is flimsy and chintzy.  I wouldn't buy these again although for the price, I can use them up and throw em out and probably get my monies worth."
2.0,Ok for Christmas costumes.  Needed to include the tights
2.0,My son bought these with his birthday money. The first day he wore them  three of them fell apart.
2.0,The collar was backwards
2.0,I received this with a hole in the black sweater. The only part I really wear is the tank top underneath which is so nice for layering. The sweater however is scratchy and uncomfortable.
2.0,Disliked that only women can wear these....had to order other products for the men in my family
2.0,"i purchased this jacket for a tall(5'10) woman with long arms. this jacket is waaayyy off. it needed like 3 inches each sleeve. its meant for the short and thick body type. if they put up a size chart or measurements, then i couldve avoided the heartache of a failed gift. :(<br />The jacket itself is decent for price, though. (does have awkward suede leather smell, almost a shoeor insecticide, but that usually will go away)"
2.0,"The band itself is pretty nice, and looks good and is made well, however, no instructions or tool were included to remove the links for sizing to fit your wrist. Had to take it to a jeweler to have it sized to wear it. If you have big wrists (and I don't) it would be fine, but for those of us who have small wrists it causes problems.<br /><br />Adding to this review, the band fell apart off my wrist after one day, tried to put it back together, but kept falling apart. Maybe that's why there were no instructions to remove links, but this is a lesson learned, you get what you pay for!!! I'm very disappointed!!!"
2.0,"I don’t like the kind of cloth, when I saw the  picture before to place the order , it seems like polyester but is not."
2.0,This top was good quality but runs about 2 sizes smaller. Had to return.
2.0,"While it’s a pretty style, the top is short and the material very thin. It’s definitely not worth the price."
2.0,The clasp broke on day 1
2.0,To Big for man. More of woman watch.
2.0,"I love this pattern, but the material is see through. I tried a few different things but you can see right through the thin fabric."
2.0,Very cheap material for the price and smelled like cigarette smoke right when I opened it.
2.0,It looks well made and attractive.  Thank you. Deborah
2.0,"It’s a great graphic featuring a John Lennon lyric. Unfortunately it is printed on a cheap scratchy Gildan shirt. It doesn’t come in a woman’s cut, so I sized up in order to customize the boxy fit. But the fabric is just so junky I don’t know if it’s worth the effort. I would have been happy to pay more for this design on a higher quality tee in a more flattering cut. I probably should have returned it but tried a washing/soaking routine that has worked in the past on uncomfortable fabric. It was not successful this time. Don’t waste your money."
2.0,great wallet at first. all of the metal peices were very durable of course. i broke the plastic clasp that kept it shut and some of the plastic partitions broke within 3 months.
2.0,"I wouldn't recommend purchasing this hat. They really should show the picture with the flamingo's neck laying over on the side because there was no way it was going to stand up. The quality of workmanship and material was really bad, also. It wouldn't have been worth half the price I paid."
2.0,"After the frame of my old and trusty MTB sunglasses snapped in half, I bought these HiHiLLs, together with the [[ASIN:B06XPB8ZDM Torege Polarized Sports Sunglasses With 4 Interchangeable Lenses for Men Women Cycling Running Driving Fishing Golf Baseball Glasses EMS-TR90 Frame TR033]]. This way I could directly compare the fit, looks and quality of both.<br /><br />It’s a clear case of “you get what you pay for”, as the Toreges, although slightly higher priced, are the better glasses. The sizing and fit of these HiHiLLs is horrible: the frame is way too wide, and the glasses sit too high and too much forward on my nose (probably to make room for the myopia lens insert). The photos show how the Torege frame will give a much tighter and smoother fit and therefore a better look. I also prefer the more glossy finish of the Toreges, as compared to the cheap plastic matte look of these HiHiLLs. The comfort of the nose bridge is similar: unfortunately not great, but hopefully satisfactory for a 1-2 hour bike ride.<br /><br />Considering the number of accessories and value for money, these glasses could deserve 3 stars, were it not for the poor, unacceptable coating on the multicolored (rainbow) lens: one corner was missed completely, resulting in an asymmetrical finish, rendering the lens useless for me. This is the reason I remove another star and I’m sending these back to get myself another pair of the Torege sunglasses to be used for driving."
2.0,I was disappointed because the item was sized smaller than advertised.
2.0,broke a few days into wearing
2.0,Very small. Wouldn't fit anyone out family over 12 years old.
2.0,"Knowing the sizes run a bit smaller, I ordered the 5X, thinking it should fit like an XL.... It fits like  Medium. I can get it on, and zipped, but feel like if I move it burst apart at the seems. And it is SHORT, I have a long waist and it barely goes to my waist, raising my arms would pull it up to my chest."
2.0,Nice wallet but really upset to receive it and realize it does not have the opening at the top for cash.
2.0,The color is actually a creamy yellow. It is not a true white. I will be returning.
2.0,Honestly disappointed in this whole outfit..... I’m sorry I’m never a Debby downer but I was disappointed
2.0,For the price I was expecting a bit more. The top of the dress is beautiful. The bottom half of the dress is very disappointing. It is extremely sheer (you can see right through it). The quality of the fabric is terrible and feels so cheap. Will be returning. The sizing is very off as well.
2.0,to big bought bubble wrap instead
2.0,"The first thing my husband said when I put them on was 'those look cheap'. They feel cheap as well. The entire frame flexes in a way that makes me worry about structural integrity when I open them and put them on. They weight next to nothing, which reinforces the fragile impression. I have not managed to actually snap them yet, but they are not comfortable and I am not sure I will pick them up again to test their fortitude. I will not be using these."
2.0,"Terrible!!  Couldn’t cut with them. Also the thumb covers are two pieces so when you try to cut, the top end with the blade comes off completely. Waste of time and money."
2.0,This runs way small and I thought the front being longer would be cute like it is on some things but it's just like having a scarf or shirt tied around your waist that you want to twist or tuck cuz they're awkward hanging down front. The only thing I like is the color (Charcoal grey) and that it full closes completely over my upper belly where I'm often self-conscious in recent months with health issues affecting weight. I&#34;ll keep it for around the house and it'll prob me more comfy when I lose a bit of weight. Normally I'm a size of mostly 2 sizes smaller though. I wanted this to be roomy.
2.0,Chain too Short and The hearts were too big and heavy to wear all day.<br /><br />I got at a discount to review
2.0,"These are great hats(!) but OR needs a vice-preside in charge of sizing.  I recently bought a new Medium which was smaller that the old Medium I’ve been wearing.  A few years ago a friend saw my hat, wanted one - but having had the sizing problem before I ordered three, all the same size.  Each was larger or smaller than the others.  He kept one and we sent two back.  Great hats - but trying to get one that fits is like, I suppose, playing roulette."
2.0,Not well made and small than described- not full flowing skirt
2.0,To small up top and big at bottom
2.0,"Well love the tie dye, the fit is not loose!  The cut is small so you should go a size or two up if you want it roomy (which I did!)."
2.0,"Im too tall for it, as the split is so high if i pull it up. If i pull it down, then my cleavage will pop out. It wasn't good support in the top either. Just not for me"
2.0,bought three seperate pairs over time.. All of them completely different fits and colors....
2.0,"They're okay, super see through though"
2.0,Not satisfied. The skirt needs to be altered to fit.
2.0,Great concept but too small
2.0,smaller than i expected but its ok
2.0,The top grill was to big in didnt turn out right with the glue paste
2.0,It’s okay.  It served its purpose as a beach cover up but i wouldn't buy it again
2.0,"They seemed like a cute idea and like if they were going to be nice but they don't stay on like the picture. As well, seconds after putting them on two of the gems fell off so I mean they're pretty much useless after that because it looses its point. I mean probably good for one time wear or in my case to try them on. Really a shame because they appeared to be super cute."
2.0,"It's a nice looking jacket and their customer service is very good. However the 1st jacket I bought worked great a few times, but stopped. I went to return and they immediately sent out a replacement (good customer service). I received the new jacket and charged the battery so I could use the following day. Unfortunately  the new jacket didn't work, it came on for about 10 minutes, produced no heat, then shut off and the battery showed 88% of charge remaining. I made numerous attempts and it never worked properly. I'm returning the replacement jacket today. I gave 1 star for the lock of the jacket and another for customer service. After 2 attempts I can't recommend this jacket and that's after I did recommend it to people on my job site who liked the look."
2.0,"I have a pair of 6mm studs that I love. These are 4mm diameter, a fact I didn't see on the description. They look tiny on my adult ears. I gave them to my daughter."
2.0,Way too tight get the 15-20 mmhg
2.0,Band is too short for an adult.
2.0,"I ordered the large size. When I got this shirt, I felt like it is XXXL. I had to return it back."
2.0,Had hope this would be a fun bikini.. but I didn't like how it fit.
2.0,"Product was great for a month then one of the lights on the shoes started acting weird. Only about half the lights light up and when you plug it in to charge it, it does not blink like the other shoe. The shoes are great, the lights are not the best quality."
2.0,"So at first I thought this was really cute right. It has a Gucci style to it so I though go for it I love a preppy look. Lol this was a mistake. First of all I will say it was nicely made not cheep looking at all it would be a good product for say, a flight attendant....and that’s what I look like a sad flight attendant.  The ruffled sleeves could probably take you on your own flight.  The ribbon waist has no stretch at all so standing is the only ideal position.  I am 160 5’3” and bought a large and this was TIGHT like a tiger.  Length about three inches above my knee so length was nice.  The tie on the neck is very nice looking. If I could axe the sleeves and earn more room or stench I would keep it. Also it smells like dirty armpits but I would be afraid to do anything but dry clean this. HARD PASS, unless of course you are a short non-curvy woman. I look like my mom made me wear it 😒"
2.0,"Very thin material, very disappointed"
2.0,the feather came off the first day.  For the price &#34;what do you want&#34;  LOL that's it for me ...
2.0,Got wrong dress never wrote to apologize switch the dress it went up in price.
2.0,One pair came with a hole in it but others are great quality
2.0,The sleeves are too long . 😕 quality not as shown in pic also. I usually wear small but it seems xs would have been better
2.0,See through after one cycle in the washer/dryer
2.0,Nice charm but it won't fit on either of my wife's 2 pandora bracelets.
2.0,"Just as the others have reported, the necklace I received was not the one pictured when I ordered it.<br /><br />Unlike the others, I actually like the necklace I received better than the one pictured in the order. I have no idea if they are similar in value or not. If I had ordered the one I received, I would have given it 4 stars. Since it isn't what I ordered, it gets a low rating, but I gave it one more star for being something that I did like."
2.0,"I got these to wear instead of PJs when working from home. I had hoped they would fit like normal pants/sweatpants, however they are huge in the legs!! The waist and length fit, but the legs are so wide they look ridiculous!! They are warm and have pockets. Just huge legs."
2.0,"Purchased dark grey, the dress came in grey heather like color. It is definitely way way lighter from the picture. Not a big fan of the material as well. It is kind of those light fabric that sticks to your skin so it shows you your ‘extras’ everywhere. Brighter side is i’m 5’1 and the dress not dragging on to the floor so it’s petite friendly."
2.0,"The color, and the sleeves are nice but it sags across the chest area, and just doesn't fit right."
2.0,"While these earrings are beautiful, the color doesn’t even remotely resemble what you see in the picture. They are basically transparent, which means that if it is amethyst, it is of a lesser quality. For this price point of $50, I would say that takes quite a few stars off, even if it comes with a nice bag."
2.0,Too wide for some of dress pants. Can come “unhooked” on accident. I do like how it will not stretch out like a leather belt.
2.0,"This purse is not as expected. There is only one internal pocket , not pocket on the back as the description says. The color is a little different as well."
2.0,These are really cute but very poorly made. They have multiple areas where the seam was hanging out or sewed really weird. The mesh is not thick like in most of my yoga pants its very thin and can easily tear. Not very durable for working out.
2.0,Child size not men
2.0,Gorgeous dress but didn't down the way I expected it to.
2.0,Fits like a large bit a 2xl
2.0,Necklace was beautiful but one of the settings had come out and needed to be fled back.
2.0,"Great shirt! It's nicely made and a beautiful design. My 10yo loves it but it's big enough for his father!<br />Very confusing sizing, terrible customer support and 4-5 week shipping! Beware."
2.0,Bad stitching
2.0,These were super fun when they worked.  One of the shoes stopped working after about an hour of wearing them.  I think the cord shorted out or something. I'd pick a different brand.
2.0,"The shirt arrived just crumpled/rolled up in a plastic bag within my Amazon box. It is what I would call a camp style, relaxed fit shirt which I prefer as I find it more comfortable and cooler than fitted styles. The color in the listing was darker than what I received (see uploaded pics). Shirt I received was more toward light blue. I prefer darker colors as they aren't see through. This was unfortunately translucent as I was wearing an orange tank top you could see the color through the fabric. It also means if you get it wet it will be even more see through. Worst of all the sleeve tab was missing. I ordered the long sleeve version and their listing pictures a sleeve tab going through the fabric loop so you can hold up a rolled sleeve but there were NO TABS on the inside or the shirt, just the loop on the outside of the sleeve. If it had the tabs I would keep it despite the fact the color was not as pictured but now it's going back to the seller. It's too bad because the shirt actually has some nice features such as the mesh in the upper back to help vent air and button down collar tabs."
2.0,"Beware, doesn't come with the pins."
2.0,The pants fit perfectly but they slide down every time I wear them to workout in.  With the high waist line they were not suppose to do that but they do. I don't reccomend buying these because they don't stay up.
2.0,"Love how the product looked , However since the hook is WAY too long i cannot wear this earring at all. Super bummed out . Wouldn’t buy unless ur head and neck is super far from ur ear lol"
2.0,"Got two one did not survive washer, it says machine washable but it had a tear at the seam in the center back"
2.0,"My excitement to receive this bag was met with great disappointment when I opened the box. Not only is the top main zipper only sewn in along 3/4 of the top opening, but there's a hole in the inside bottom lining seam. Returning the item and off to start my search for the perfect bag. Again."
2.0,"When outside could feel the wind through the pants, the fit is weird tight on the waist,  near the groin it's loose and looks awkward, loose near the knees.  Only good thing about them is that the inside is soft."
2.0,Not too crazy about it...  looks very different in the picture when it was purchased.
2.0,This dress is cut way too small. I sized up also.
2.0,"PRODUCT WAS VERY WELL MADE, BUT DOUBLE FLARES MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT IN."
2.0,i was giving as a gift. But it really is small and cheaply made.
2.0,Giving it two stars because they were just too large for my taste.
2.0,"I got the watch because I like the design and wanted something I can wear everyday and not worry about destroying it.  Design is great.  Love the look and feel  but hate the fact it stops every couple hours.  Even after winding it like the instructions say,  and manually shaking it, it stops.  Mind you I move constantly for work. !!  Wouldn't recommend."
2.0,"Let's just say that someone this Christmas will love this shirt @ goodwill...brand new w/ tags. Lol, even my 4yr son said he thought it was ugly and to get rid of it.  It doesn't look like the picture at all and it's way too big for me. Oh well, someone could use it, but definitely not me. Oh and the shipping was horrendous...I forgot I ordered it, thats how long it took."
2.0,"The dress is ok and the antennas are good quality but the wings are so UGLY AND CHEAP! There's no wire inside them to give them any shape...I guess for the price I shouldn't complain, ($8) I just didn't expect the wings to be so bad....."
2.0,"Not as pictured. It's very poor quality, extremely thin. Fits awkward.  I tried it on but never actually wore it as it looked nothing like the picture. The picture looks like a nice cozy sweater, this is not it. I was extremely disappointed. This is definitely not the sweater shown. I have found the actual sweater shown for a few hundred dollars. Not willing to pay that much, but I did find it on a reputable US site. I hoped that since this was on amazon it would have been better quality. Oh well."
2.0,"I was so disappointed in this slipper.  It’s stiff, not fluffy or soft at all.  Clunky looking, not what I expected. I like the sole of the shoe, doesn’t slip or slide...good grip for an old lady such as myself.  For the money, this is NOT worth the huge expense."
2.0,I ordered a pack of these 2 weeks ago and they seemed to be a good value especially to wear while doing house chores and yard work. So this week I decided to order another pack in the same size just different colors except both packs contained a black pair. When I opened the package I noticed they seemed a bit bigger so I tried on the black pair which I already had a pair of in the same size. The new pair I bought just 2 weeks later was huge it started falling off my bottom after I put it on and walked into the other room. I know unfortunately there is no way I lost that kind of weight in 2 weeks and all my other close fit. Point to the story the sizing is inconsistent skip the purchase and return.
2.0,Pajama was tighter in a leg.  It seems to be sewed wrong.  Too bad my son removed the tags before I could try it on.  And I was unable to return it.
2.0,These are adorable just be prepared to fix the string.
2.0,"Socks are way too long. I'm 5'4&#34; and had to fold over the top 2 inches. The cuff is same amount of compression and hemmed. Once it was folded over that was 3 thicknesses of compression. Had the cuff been a regular knit, it would have been comfortable to wear folded over."
2.0,"This sweater, which isn’t exactly a sweater at all but a thin material, runs small.  I wear a small or medium and after reading the reviews, ordered a medium.  Nope, still snug on the arms.  This is my second order of this same item, but supposedly different “brands”.  Nope again.  Seemed different in the photos, but they’re not. They’re exact identical cardigans and the charcoal isn’t charcoal at all but an alternating thin stripe of a light and dark gray.  And the band along the bottom hem is slightly gathered and looks odd cupped under my rearend.  Both have been returned.  Shame, because I really wanted this long cardigan to wear with leggings and I tried to purchase it twice!"
2.0,Not what I expected at all. Not very cute. Waste of money.
2.0,"Doesn't fit well.. loose, falls down"
2.0,"I've used this band on my Fitbit since purchase, but find that the edges of the band start to ""frey"" and come undone.  There's nothing like having small pieces of metal catch on your sleeve and shirts.  I'm ordering a different band with hopes that I don't have same issue."
2.0,Looks and feels cheap. Does not feel overwhelmingly comfortable. Not exactly inexpensive either.
2.0,Looks good fits horrible
2.0,The material was ok but it ran small
2.0,"I bought these for my 7 year old and she loves them, but you definitely get what you pay for. The wire these are wrapped in are very thin and cheap. The loop broke off one within the first few hours of being worn. There was no tugging or pulling or rough playing of any kind it just fell off. Had to rewire it for her. Now what I did not pay for was to receive one chipped and cracked! If it would have been the pink or purple one you might not notice the damage as much, but it was the clear crystal and it's very obvious. Very disappointed..would not recommend."
2.0,"Ok, was a bit misshapened but still good for price."
2.0,"The bracelet, which is not the one pictured here, was silver plated, not sterling silver."
2.0,Very tight/clingy material. I needed a dress this color for work but it would not work for a professional setting.
2.0,Material is good however the eyes on the side for the lace to pass through started popping out just from trying it on when I got it.  I could not use it besides it was to big as will.
2.0,Color changed immediately
2.0,"works great  for a big table cloth, but way too big for my bod!  Looked like a blanket walking a head around!"
2.0,"Gorgeous monokini, but way too small. I'm a medium, 5'4, 125 lbs, and you would probably have to order a large for it to fit right. But it is one sexy swim suit!!"
2.0,"Cute, but the design is printed on the outside of the case so it will peel/rub off. I’ve had mine for about 9 months and it’s almost entirely gone."
2.0,"I bought these for my daughter to wear to dance class. 2 pair in different colors. They're really pretty, BUT THEYRE SEE THROUGH.  Coming from Adidas I would expect the material to be stronger and not show my child's hind end."
2.0,It has rubs red crumbling lint after seat belt on top of it in car.
2.0,I saw the exact same shorts (same picture and everything) on Shein for 9 bucks. These shorts are very wrinkly and you can see right through them. If you wear a nude thong you will be good to go. Im 5 feet 115lb and I got an xs. It fits and I have some room.
2.0,Don’t really like the material. It honestly looks and feels cheap. The cover up is very long as well and I’m short (5’3).
2.0,Item was low quality material. Looks like it will have a matted appearance over time. I would not recommend. Happy I can return.
2.0,"Bottom fit good, but top didn't want to stay!"
2.0,Although these are really cute almost half of them don't match. For example I have a solid blue one and half blue half white one. Or a solid brown one and a half brown half white one. Almost half are like that so I can't make earrings out of them I'll have to make necklaces I guess. 6 pairs are like this so looks like I'm making 12 necklaces lol
2.0,"I just got the pants and tried them on. The fabric material is not soft at all, maybe that's how they make the pants sturdy? There is also a  problem in stitching, see the photo. This is the first time I buy pants online. A little disappointed at the quality."
2.0,The design on the front is very rigid so you loose all your shape in it.
2.0,"this staff should not be sold, poor quality  just like coloure glasses, nothing personaly  won t be my first choice"
2.0,Band does not stay engaged in the 2 slots that are on the watch very well. Sometimes I feel them disengage and my watch falls off
2.0,I really liked the design of the shirt but with so many ordered on line they are thin cheap material and the sizing has to based on child sizes or made in China.  I ordered the extra large and it is equivalent to a medium.  I wish companies would advise of the sizing issues or use better quality shirts that are true to size.  Another wasted purchase.
2.0,Now everything is a yellow glare.
2.0,Writing is barely legible
2.0,"I bought the dress in white and was very disappointed. The top of the dress is low quality, fits strangely, and is totally see through. Not a good fit for a busty lady. The bottom chiffon part that is supposed to be see through is nice and a great length. I am so sad because I was really excited about this dress. Definitely returning it."
2.0,The clips that hold the band to the fit bit come easily disconnected easily. Also most lost my fit bit many times.
2.0,Sleeves were nice and cool and felt good on the arms but biggest problem was no cuff or rubber on upper edge to keep them from rolling or sliding down constantly.  This was the only problem I had was constantly pulling sleeve back up and just got too irritating.  Tried to return them but package never got picked up even though the ticket was called in so just ended up giving them away to young teenager.
2.0,The worst never order again
2.0,The top will not stretch and skirt was fine
2.0,"This shirt is cut much shorter then pictured. I’m 5’1 and it’s too short for my torso. Also, the neckline is higher than in the picture. The fabric is nice and thin, but the front edge of the shirt is sewn from two pieces of fabric that appear to curl upward. I wouldn’t buy this again."
2.0,"These are worth their approx $13 price but no more.  As others have said, they really do fall down terribly badly.  The plus is no muffin top, but if you want to actually work out in them you will need suspenders....."
2.0,"I wear blended bifocals, and I'm just not prepared to shell out another $300 for blended bifocal sunglasses. I thought about getting a pair of single vision sunglasses, but then not being able to see close up is annoying. I have chunky plastic rectangular frames on my glasses. I tried to get some clip ons, but could not find any which fit. The biggest available size was wide enough, but not tall enough. Too bad, because they looked good & hugged my glasses tightly.<br /><br />I decided that I would have to go with flip ups, because they came in larger sizes than the clip ons. These were the biggest I could find except for the ""Hello, I'm from planet Pocket Protector"" big square ones that hang below my glasses about 1/4"". These are 1.5"" high, exactly. So are my frames, but the sunglasses still ride too high, leaving about a 1/8"" noticeable gap at the bottom. I modified them a bit...took off the little bars that sit on top of the frames, and gently bent the lenses so that the lenses on my glasses are barely covered, although, because these are flip ups and not clip ons, there's a fairly big gap on top, so that sunlight from overhead can still be problem. It could be I'll never find a good fit for my glasses. If you have skinny rectangular frames, these would work. Clip ons would be better. Have chunky rectangular frames, zip so far."
2.0,"They were OK. My son loves them. They are cheaply made, and one is off on the hinge so it snaps open and shut. I would not purchase again :("
2.0,"broke before they were ever worn, but did receive a refund"
2.0,got 2 one fell apart in short time
2.0,The shoes had little to no arch support as the description implies.  The picture on the website looked like the shoes were darker red and better quality than they appear in person.
2.0,"This dress was nice to look at although when I tried it on it was very itchy. The size it exactly as it states, I am the same size as model in size. I sent the item back I didn’t not like the material."
2.0,"Considering the price I paid for it, I suppose I shouldn't complain. However, it broke into a million pieces after dancing for a few hours at a wedding. Would not suggest buying"
2.0,I liked this shirt but the arm holes hang way down and the neck is tight. I ended up returning this.
2.0,"It’s a gorgeous dress, but realize that the size was way way too small. I am a big girl (5’7” 220lbs), and the 2xl could not zip around my 40 inch chest and my 19 inch arms"
2.0,Looks like poor quality...disappointed. Not fully plated with gold either
2.0,The pockets already tore off.
2.0,I followed the size chart and ordered a large as I am a 42 arm length and a 34 waist. I got the shirt and it is more like an extra small. Sleeves ended by my elbow and the waist was for someone much smaller than a 34.
2.0,This is a super compression shirt! Very uncomfortable unless of course you like this tight feeling style. .
2.0,The size chart is off. It is also a bit flimsy and too big! Print was nice.
2.0,"Ripped at the seam the 2nd or 3rd time I used them.  Kept using them anyway, the padding is in the right spot for road riding."
2.0,"The stings are incredibly long. I had to tie them around my waist. The straps are weirdly placed and not comfortable at all. They are so short that even when I made them as long as they will go, the dress was still in my armpits. And the v neck is not nearly as deep or flattering as the photo. I have never felt worse in a dress. If you make it a sexy length that you can actually move in, it shows the cooch"
2.0,"Made for a child, returned."
2.0,pretty pattern but fit me like a maternity shirt and I'm a pretty curvy gal size 12 and size D bust
2.0,It toooo big we can't say it handbag for daily use
2.0,"Just did not like how it looked on me, had to return it."
2.0,"Dress was way too short, couldn’t wear because of this. I’m not a super tall person either."
2.0,I am a size 14 and ordered the XXL. It does not flow like the photo shows. It is not even cut in a manner that it would flow like a babydoll. It's cut like a slip. Other than that it's fine. It's stretchy and very pretty.
2.0,Wasn’t close as soft as the fluffies I’ve been buying for years.  Very disappointed.
2.0,Material was extremely rough against my legs. Cant wear at all. Too uncomfortable
2.0,The gun did look ok to my cosplay bit it did not look like the same on like in the picture it is shown
2.0,I read the review and decide to got with an XL and it was too small. I normally wear a XL. I really like the dress.
2.0,"The material feels rough, almost like how umbrellas material feels, I guess that's so it's waterproof. The mask is kinda too big, and the way it's built is really odd. It's folded in a strange pleated way in the top and bottom so the pretty picture is also folded in and can't be seen. The image should have been shrunk and centered at least so you could see the full image without the folds. Also, the image is grainy almost like a photocopy of a photocopy or an image they blew up. The thread seems around it are white, not black like in the picture. It does come with a pocket for the filters. Also, it came late. Overall it's just ok."
2.0,"These boxers overall are nicely made the fit is probably average however the color dye on the black boxers, even after washed 5+ times, mark my sons skin with ink and he ends up with an outline of the black boxers. This never happened b4 .. needles to say, we no longer use the black boxers."
2.0,I didn't realize exactly how small the earrings were. Not what I expected.
2.0,Cheap looks better in picture...but what did I  expect for low prices.
2.0,"the connect with safety pins, not clip on - very cheap looking."
2.0,It made a great gift for one of my friends
2.0,Way too big I ordered a 4 to 5 year size and it's huge on my daughter. Very disappointed in that but looks just like the pic
2.0,would not stay on
2.0,"I wanted to love these. I've had my double lobe piercing since the early 2000's and was hoping these would look really cute. Please be warned these are actually very sharp and rather difficult to put in. I struggled for about ten minutes on each ear to thread through the back and front and find the ""direction"" they went in. When I did finally get them in they looked awkward and too small. I might have bigger ears though so these could very well fit on a smaller ear. The jewelry itself was very pretty. I'm not sure if it's real silver based on the oversize stamp on it but I didn't have any issue with itchy ears or changing color."
2.0,They keep falling off with every few steps making her and I both irritated. However they are very cute.
2.0,Junk lenses pop out to easily! Not good for my motorcycle helmet use! Threw out!
2.0,This shirt was not even close to fitting.  It ran very small.
2.0,The color stains when you sweat. Not good at all.
2.0,It's a nice necklace
2.0,"This wasn't warm at all, but it was soft and looked okay.<br /><br />It is quite airy and does nothing to insulate your head from even the slightest of wind chills. Maybe get this as a summer cap for a colder place just to look cool."
2.0,Hard to adjust the length. Took me almost one hour to remove the third block. The first two was relatively easier.<br /><br />Cannot find the word Japan on the package or the watch itself.<br />Why would someone advertise it as &quot;Japan...&quot;?!
2.0,These are so loud. Walking in them is awful because they make a very loud noise when they touch anything or rub together
2.0,Nice quality but soooo small!!! I need to alter it to fit my 14 year old son. Even tight on me and I am petite
2.0,Cute dress but I have to return. A &#34;small&#34; is too big - I am 130lb and 5'4&#34;. Wish they came in XS.
2.0,"Ordered size 11 and recieved a EURO 29. The insole measures 6.5 inches. The color of the shoe appears gold just as the bow. What I received was a matte gold, almost brown shoe and the bow is shiny gold as pictured. Sadly I will be returning the sister set I purchased."
2.0,Runs small. Cannot adjust straps. Comfortable material.
2.0,The arms are too short and the material is not Sweatshirt material as stated
2.0,I did not like the way it fit my foot.
2.0,"No me gusto  el material , talla es más grande de lo normal"
2.0,I got two Foxy lights and one Freddy light. The Freddy light didn't work...I don't recommend.
2.0,Doesn't work for long
2.0,"It came in a bag that said ""made in China"". Handmade? I doubt it."
2.0,I have not wore the dress yet but its not for women with small breast and it fits tighter then I expected and i didnt know the ruffles around the was a separate piece and the hole for the arm is kind of small
2.0,The product is pretty average . Not too good with deep stains .
2.0,If you have boobs is too small.
2.0,Didn’t work for me. Very loose. Maybe I got a bad batch
2.0,"The dress is beautiful! Fits great! Downside, after wearing it one time the strap in the back breaks. I haven’t washes it or anything."
2.0,I don't own this product partially because from the info given there is no way to know if it will fit.<br /><br />most bangle bracelets are sized by inner diameter.
2.0,"I returned these earrings because they are tiny!  They are so small they look like baby earrings. They are about 1/3 the size of a dime and I would have wanted them to be around the size of a nickle.  Kind of a mean trick I thought and the time wasted repackaging, printing and affixing return label and taking them to UPS drop off.  I suppose some people wouldn't do that and that is what they are betting on.  :-("
2.0,Not long enough for ladies snow boots
2.0,"I'm a big lady & this is still to big for my wrist, it bunches up to where you can't really make out what it is, I ordered 3 for my granddaughters & I and all 3 has broke already."
2.0,"Material is good but the size too small & I can't use it,  medium size would fit me better ."
2.0,the triangle choker didn't close around my neck... so i technically only got 7 of these.
2.0,"The sizing is off, the shorts are too big and the zipper didn't work right. I sent them back for a refund."
2.0,Returned for a different color
2.0,"I ordered this watch for my Mom's birthday.  She loved the watch and the unique design, and she received many compliments on it.  We thought it was a great purchase, EXCEPT for the fact that only 5 weeks later it fell off her arm while she was running errands, and by the time she noticed it, she wasn't able to find it.  A watch should last longer than 5 weeks, so not a great price if you have to keep ordering another one.  I'll contact the seller and see if they will replace it, which I hope they will."
2.0,I usually wear large to extra large. I wanted this to be loose so I ordered a 2x and it is skin tight
2.0,Top has potential and very cute color but it feels cheap. Its almost like I wrapped a piece of cloth around me. Wished it would have worked but sent it back the next day.
2.0,NO STRETCH AT ALL!! Looked great but DIDN’T feel great...the fit was fine until I tried to walk...too stiff and again NO STRETCH...NONE!
2.0,"Very thin wire. Tarnished easily.<br />If you look at my photo, the small. Gold ring in the middle is a normal sized wire probably 1.0. These are. 7 and bend using your fingers easily. I tried them for the heck of it. The ring on the left earring was worn once. Tarnished. The one on the right unworn. Compared to the little ring in the middle they look already junky.<br />Save your money and buy from Joann fabric of Michael's type craft store. Way cheaper and better quality."
2.0,Broke the first time I wore it an hour into the dinner. I was able to fix it but very cheap!
2.0,"Size too big,quality no well very"
2.0,I followed the reviews and sized up….you don’t have to. it’s a much thinner material than I was expecting too.
2.0,Looks gorgeous however broke soon as I put it on. Chain super thin. Very delicate
2.0,Had to return it because the material was very revealing. You could see right through it. The bust was also cut to expose my breast. Had to return it
2.0,I do not recommend doing yoga in these at all. The material is extremely thin and the slits just don't sit quite right. I really wanted these to work and they just don't.
2.0,Yikes. The quality and color are pretty bad. I wouldn’t waste the money on this.
2.0,pretty cheaply made and looks dull and cheap when wearing and stem breaks and bends.
2.0,The sticking is off on these.....when you go to put on your foot you can actually feel how tight the threads are. ...... and they also do not stay pulled up....this is first pair. Will update as I try all 12.
2.0,Super cute and feels good quality. I’m 5’4 and 145lbs and the medium was just too tight to be comfortable. So I sized up to a large. The medium and large are the exact same size. Very disappointed.
2.0,"These underwear I received are no longer the equivalent of the Knockers I bought originally. The fabric is much lighter weight and an entirely different construction. They are no longer 95% cotton / 5% spandex as advertised. Apparently they don’t come in colors anymore. I wouldn’t waste my money on these again, which is an absolute shame as I loved these when they first came out."
2.0,seam tore first time wearing them and it took a long time to receive them after they were ordered
2.0,I purchased the Charcoal/Black band and the quick release mechanism on the long strap will not stay on my watch making it impossible to wear. The other side stays fine and I don't have any issues with any of my other bands. The band is also slightly darker in color than I was expecting; there's very little difference between the black and charcoal colors.
2.0,ordered lilic but got a pink one
2.0,The dress looks a bit cheap and fits big
2.0,The print is crooked on the case. Really detracts from its appeal.
2.0,Too small for my grandson.
2.0,"I had ordered the white color and it was definitely see through. I am returning. Also, the material is pretty cheap for being almost $30. Should be half that price or even less."
2.0,With this ring for some reason the sterling silver is not shiny it looks faded; very unsatisfied. It’s a gorgeous ring I bought as a birthday present August birthstone; but unfortunately something is wrong with the material.
2.0,"I wanted to love this bathing suit. As other reviews have mentioned, check the size chart and follow it. The sizing is definitely different from American sizing. For reference I'm 5'7&#34; 36DDD with a pretty long torso. The length of the suit was great.  Although the rouching made me feel a little more covered up, it was not all that flattering. The problem with the fit of this suit is that the molded cups were pointed upwards. I'm all for looking perky and having some lift but that is not what this suit was trying to do. In fact, the upper portion of the cups were completely empty. From straight ahead it looked good but from my own view or a view from the side - not good. Additionally, the fabric was very thin. I have tattoos on my lower back and they could all be seen through the fabric. I gave it two stars based on length and comfort. I did return it for a refund based on the reasons above."
2.0,"This is a beautiful printed top however, unlike most T-shirts, the material is similar to that of a swimsuit.  Also note that the sizes run small.  There isn't a size or 'how to wash' tag in the neck and it is difficult to determine the front from the back.  Very disappointing."
2.0,"They make a version for stilettos, but these shoes were high heels, but not stilettos. So... I bought what I thought was appropriate.  They were too large for the high heel and couldn't be worn.  These were for wedding shoes so now they are trash."
2.0,You get what you pay for here. Is it a mask? Yes! Is it a great mask! Not so much. It's hard to see out of the mask. It feels kind of flimsy. I didn't return it because I didn't have the energy to go through the entire process for the price of what I paid for the mask.
2.0,did not like this top at all
2.0,"This product is not gonna cover your titties 😭 I didn't realize this was self-tie so that's on me, but there is NO way to make that ribbon look pretty. I was super excited, love how the shirt feels and looks, but... I am never gonna wear this shirt ):"
2.0,Not what they claim to be
2.0,"Didn’t click in daughters hair very well .  Kept falling out .  He does have her have thinner hair,  so that might be the issue."
2.0,"Really pretty and a really nice fit. I wore it for an hour and my finger started to turn green so I took it off. I look at the page again and it says do not expose to air, do not expose to water, do not expose to sweat. What can I expose it to exactly? Sounds like I shouldn't even be wearing it. Title should say plated because it is not sterling silver."
2.0,Loved them until 3rd wash zipper broke. Only 1 week into wearing. If that didn't happen these would have been my favorite pair of pants hands down. For you military or LEO guys You'll find these super comfy.
2.0,I have purchased these in the past but this time ordered them twice and both times had to return because too small!  Normally wear XL but had to return those and then ordered XXL and those ran too small also!  Very disappointed!
2.0,The product is too thin and tight.
2.0,No buttons or fasteners to secure the dress...only the belt!!
2.0,The cut is not flattering & runs large.
2.0,they were too small for my boyfriends nose
2.0,"It is sold as real leather, but it is not. I like the design and was showing it off to a friend who pointed to a frayed corner where the “leather” surface has rubbed away, exposing the fabric backing.<br />I only received the wallet 5 days ago and have used it while shopping and riding the bus. I wear Docker’s style pants with soft fabric, not a tight pair of jeans.<br />Amazon needs to crack down on vendors misrepresenting products as real leather when they are not.<br /><br />The price was cheap so shame on me for foolishly thinking I was getting real leather at that price. Again, I like the design and would pay more for real leather.<br /><br />UPDATE: I returned the “black” one, which was made from “faux leather,” though it was not labeled as such. Even today, it says “leather.” Return was easy at Whole Foods. I order the one with the “color” described as “genuine leather-black.” It arrived quickly and IS genuine leather. And I love it. But avoid the cheapest “black” model. It is advertised as leather, but it is not.<br /><br />The reviews of the different versions, made from different materials, should not be co-mingled. It increases consumer confusion. And the resulting disappointment and returns."
2.0,Once you wash these a few times the color fades a lot and they look really old. I bought a similar pair at the same time and have washed those just as much as these and they still look brand new unlike these
2.0,It is very cheap plastic like a dummy glasses on the display glasses.
2.0,Looks nice if you don't move your hand...at all. The chain for the finger is too long so I had to twist it to make it shorter. Also the wrist bracelet is too big but the main issue is that the snake doesn't stay on the top of your hand when you move. It's cute for a novelty one time wear for a costume party but that's about it. Light weight. Pretty. Probably can't get it wet.
2.0,Love the glasses but we have had numerous issues with the screws coming out. They are different screws so we are having a hard time replacing them
2.0,For a plus size shirt it was to clingy. returned
2.0,"I really like it, but it gets moisture in it and since it is supposed to be water proof in is very hard to evaporate out"
2.0,"It's too small and I don't like it, I thought it would be more large, it's very good quality but too small"
2.0,"This looks like a fuzzy rug, nothing like the picture"
2.0,"looks nice, until you wear it then the chains keep getting twisted, and the metal leaves, catch on every fabric i wear - cheap"
2.0,"Fabric feels cheap, it came larger than expected."
2.0,"Way too big for an infant. Might fit her as a toddler. Very disappointed in the size. They are very soft and good colors to have in the collection, but will have to wait a year or more to wear."
2.0,"Not a big fan.  Was a bit stiff and smaller inside than originally thought.  Bought it for a particular occasion, but ended up using something I already had."
2.0,This was pretty but way too big for my body I am tall but slender and this hung oversized.
2.0,Nice dress but the fabric as cheap and it runs large
2.0,In the advertised picture this dress has more material and does not show your breast. The actual fitting shows all of your goodies. The cross pattern is different also. Disappointment!
2.0,It was perfect for the first couple months until it started to tarnish.
2.0,size not as expected. Order 1 size larger.
2.0,It has the look and feel of something from a gum ball machine.
2.0,These are not breathable nor for working out. Don’t recommend them.
2.0,dont like the lace
2.0,Shoes are very cute my son loves them but they do run pretty big! Size 11/12 is more like 1/2.
2.0,It just didn’t fit the way the picture shows.  Very bulky in the back
2.0,"Not like the sales photo. When placed on head, it looks more like a shiny clown wig than anything else. The side hair was much closer to my eyes than shown in the photo, and the bangs had about three times as much hair as in the photo. Having thin hair in real life - I'd NEVER thought I would say that a wig had TOO MUCH hair! Ugh."
2.0,The design is nice but the quality lacks. I will wear them for as long as the last.
2.0,"I purchase the LaCrosse men's 18"" razor snake-proof boots as a Christmas present to myself, I got it a few days before Christmas,the boots looked so nice I decide to wear it a bit to  break it in,only then I realize how uncomfortable it really is, the side padding hurt's my ankles every time I walk,I told myself maybe because it's new that is why it's doing that,i've been wearing the boots five days now, for about six hours a day and the side padding still hurt's my ankles.<br /> LaCrosse Men's 18"" Razor Snake-Proof Hunting Boot,Mossy Oak Break Up,11 M US."
2.0,The bracelets were said to be crystals they are not. They are painted beads.
2.0,"While i do like this shield,  i wish they would make the bands more sturdy. They just cracked so easily.  At least this one did last a 2 months while some others a couple days or on delivery."
2.0,"I knew from reviews to buy a little larger size. I normally wear misses size 12 . I purchased XxL and it is still too small , going to try with good under garments else send back"
2.0,"The grey part of the scarf literally sheds EVERYWHERE. Even after 3 washes, the shedding isn’t any better. Also, MUCH bigger than it appears in the photo. I feel like it’s a throw blanket."
2.0,"I had to return the gloves. There was a major defect in the material. For 200 bucks, I would expect a much better quality control program by the vendor. I did reorder another pair so I'll wait to see the outcome of that."
2.0,"I got this today and the color of the sweatshirt is different from the logo, no matching as the photo of the product depicts. Seems like a nice sweat shirt but it did seem big and larger than a XL should be. I would order a size smaller"
2.0,Sleeve to long
2.0,"This fits small. Even though I bought it one size larger to account for shrinkage after washing and drying. It was still too small. This is the issue when buying clothes online, especially if the sizes are not true USA sizes. The top is correct as far as color and pattern and it was pretty, but does me no good if I can't wear it."
2.0,"It's made of a really cheap material, the yellow dress is paler than the picture, and the shoulder part is almost like a drawstring . The dress was too large, but that was my fault. Even if it fit well, I still wouldn't wear it out, so I returned it."
2.0,Nice casual headband. Doesn’t look like picture and not tight enough for any sport.
2.0,"This picture for the dress is not the same dress you receive. The waist falls under your boobs not at the waist line.<br />Changes the whole look of the dress.<br />Ordered 2 sizes to confirm it was not me.<br />Don't bother, you will not receive the dress shown.<br />I only gave them 2 stars bc the return policy is so easy."
2.0,"These are extremely narrow shoes. Even a size up won't help if you have average/wide feet. Cute, but non functional."
2.0,"They were very pretty, but the part that goes in the ear was not smooth and because of the shape of that piece going in the ear made it difficult to put in and they irritated my ears.  Will not wear."
2.0,It's a beautiful shoe but they need to use better glue or sew the the edges around. I haven't wear it for ones and it already loosen of around it
2.0,The hips on this are too big for skirt.
2.0,"Price was great but the material is fragile. First day we put the bag in the car trunk it got a dent from touching the car wall. In 2 trips the bags were destroyed. This last flight I took they damaged the bag, the entire wheel came off. Shopping again."
2.0,"Attaching the band to the watch is IMPOSSIBLE!!! I have been working on attaching off an on for 2 weeks and have only one of the 2 sides connected. Bottom line do not buy the watch in the first place, it come with a leather and nylon band and the leather wears out very quickly. VERY frustrating!"
2.0,The ties on the straps are big and do not sit flat
2.0,"I've used this umbrella for about 6 months now and I am so disappointed.  A friend had an umbrella with the nifty automatic open/close feature so I ordered this Totes umbrella.  It's Totes, so I had reasonable expectations - they should be ashamed of this item.  My free promo umbrellas are better than this one!<br /><br />Good:<br />- Small compact size when closed.<br />- Open/close button - why I bought it.<br /><br />Bad:<br />- Mine is RUSTING, I dry it out, but no matter.<br />- After pressing the button to close, collapsing the frame requires brute force.  Fighting with a WET umbrella defeats the point of trying to stay dry.<br />- No wrist cord"
2.0,I did not realize they would be so big
2.0,The chain broke within a night
2.0,I really loved how these look but the buckle attachment fell off the 2nd time I wore it. It fell off while I was wearing it and I must've lost one of the components because there is no way for me to put it back together.<br />I wish these would've worked. I guess the attachment is just bad deisgn.
2.0,"Super thin.  I just opened the box and have already put a hole in two just putting them on.  I normally get a size small but thought I would get a medium this time.  So they weren’t too small, they were just very thin.  You could see through them. And they were pretty pricey considering I had to pay 9.99 just for shipping.  Cost me over $30.00. TooThese gloves are not worth spending the money on."
2.0,"While I returned this product, I gave it 2 stars.  The color I got is completely see-thru, I am uncomfortable to wear such items out.  I really like it though, just needed thicker material."
2.0,material is a bit rough inside I was expecting a softer feel of a sweatshirt material. Arms are also tighter then one would expect on this top and I felt like when I bend my arm there was a tighten around my elbow and you could feel the seams rub. I got a small and I am 5 feet 2 inches and about 120 lobs. Maybe a medium would of fit better but I do not care for the material.
2.0,"I was so excited to receive these! When I went to try them on, they fell off my face! I have a big noggin so that has never happened before. After looking at them for a second, it seemed they were somehow bent outward from the middle metal portion connecting the lenses.  I bent them slightly and they will stay on now but they are still not snug. This will have to be a pair I wear to the pool or in my car. Not to the lake or beach which I frequent often. They would fly off easily."
2.0,"These were ok. Pretty good construction, weak plating tho, chips pretty easily."
2.0,After a month the shoes wouldn’t charge anymore.
2.0,Wavy brim. Same material as Tilley. Not same look thanks to the brim.
2.0,"I loved this too until I washed it, and it pulled terribly. I'm very disappointed because it's so cute and comfortable with leggings. I ordered the wine color, and color is nice. It fits true to size."
2.0,"cotton feels and looks like linen, I ordered white, but it is like dirty white, returned"
2.0,"I bought these based on a recommendation from another site and then seeing that they advertised some kind of thing for glasses to prevent fogging... It has been a non-stop frustration with either fogging of my glasses and/or my breath being funneled up into my eyes causing them to itch, water, and dry out. When I find a position where my glasses don't fog up, they're sitting so far down that the top end of my vision is going over the top of my glasses.<br /><br />If you don't wear glasses these are probably just fine, but if you do, heed everyone's advice saying to look elsewhere."
2.0,"I got a graphite belt with a silver buckle, which is ok, but I wanted a brown one with the bronze buckle as the picture shows. There is no brown one available, had I known this, I’d have picked a different brand. Ensure you check with the seller first!"
2.0,The buckle tore off as I was taking the belt off.
2.0,"The slit is very high up the thigh. If one is not careful it can open to much exposing undergarments. I really didn't like that therefore, I returned the dress."
2.0,Strap broke within 2 months.
2.0,"But it does not have lining, very see through!!!!!!!!!!"
2.0,I have very large boobs that are super heavy.  I had high hopes for this and wished it would have fit.  It offered no support nor did it fit.
2.0,I bought this for a wedding.  Nope.  It fits and feels like a liturgical dance dress.  Right at the top and lose at the bottom.  Matter of fact I actually shared the dress with our dance team who is looking for new dresses.
2.0,I'm 5'4 and about 155lbs. I ordered an XL and they were tight and every time I bent over my butt crack showed. I normally wear a large in bottoms cause I am pear-shaped but reading the reviews I decided to go up a size. NOPE!!! Go up 2 if you like them comfy and somewhat loose. Will be returning and not reordering.
2.0,"Too small and too tight around the chest area. Overall, too short in length. The material and the color is great. Will definitely see if i could order a size up and possibly go with other colors."
2.0,The picture doesn’t do it’s justice. The material in the pictures aren’t the same compared to the actual product and after one use it’s stretched out. It’s decent overall..
2.0,"The nosepiece came loose during the second wearing.  They are clear and nice, but hopefully the next pair is more durable than that."
2.0,"Something wrong with bifocal, distorted, could not read as well as my other ICU readers. Was supposed to come with a case, did not."
2.0,Clasp unfastened itself several times. I removed one link and it was loose. Then removed a second and it was way too tight. It’s a beautiful band though.
2.0,"This earrings are really cute and they haven't tarnished but the center ring on one of them broke off after two wears. I'm planning on just taking off all the rings that don't have the post and wearing them like that, but of course that's not ideal. Wouldn't recommend."
2.0,"These glasses are nice, fit my face well and provide good reading magnification.  I spend lots of time on video calls, esp now, and wanted anti-reflective or anti-glare glasses.  These were advertised as such, but provide plenty of glare, so back they go."
2.0,Cute look watch but battery wasn't working.
2.0,"You get exactly what you see, but the chain makes my skin break out every time I wear it. Disappointing because I really like the look of it."
2.0,"I'm not impressed with the quality of these.  They feel cheaply made.  They snag hair like no other pair of sunglasses I've ever owned.<br /><br />They are packaged in the worst way possible.  They shipped the glasses in a soft sided pouch.  The sunglasses were not protected inside a case or box.  The glasses were sitting outside/on top of the box that contained the case.  They were only protected by one layer of bubble wrap, so the frames arrived totally bent out of shape and one hinge felt like it was bent so much it felt jammed and took a lot of force to open and close."
2.0,"Loved the dress, but it did not fit as an XL.  I was very disappointed because it so cute.  Rather than return the two dresses, I gave them to me granddaughter."
2.0,I got the green and lilac color because I wasn’t sure which one would work best for a wedding I was attending. The lilac looked immensely cheap and not at all for an evening look. The skirt in the bottom IS short but somehow it all came together
2.0,Larger than expected. I material was very flimsy I felt and didn't give as much structure as I would have hoped. I also found the adhesive didn't hold up well and I only used it twice.
2.0,Lost one in first week! Kept wiggling out. Not heavy enough to hold itself in my ear. Disappointed! They were cute.
2.0,I ordered a 4xl and they looked like medium at best.  Caution on purchase.
2.0,The side slant pockets stick out. Not a good look.
2.0,The ribbon is too short
2.0,Way too small - can’t wear it
2.0,These are too see thru for me.
2.0,"Nice shirt, but fits loosely on the cuffs around your wrist and after one wash the logo is already coming off."
2.0,"This is a really cute mood ring.  My 4 year old son loves novelty jewelry like this, and he thought this ring was pretty great when it arrived.  As for the 2 stars, I will say this:  This ring fell apart within 2 weeks (honestly, I wasn't expecting much quality for $5.99, but it wasn't even being worn that regularly).  Also the placement of the guitar is slightly awkward as it seems to get in the way a lot. We did attempt to glue the guitar back on in a different position which seemed to help, but the glue failed in the end.<br /><br />I would probably just keep your six bucks, unless you are looking for something temporary that will eventually fall apart."
2.0,"I was looking for a compression top for exercise (dance).  The top fits, but has no compression or very little.  It will make a nice camisole, and I will keep them, as not worth returning.  Three tops for $20 is a really good price - even for a cami and good colors."
2.0,It was very small and had an odor to it
2.0,Runs a size smaller
2.0,"Poor quality and shirts are made small. Also all the shirts were different in sizes. One fit like an extra small, one fit like a small, and one fit like a medium. Arm length was also short on all the shirts and didn’t even come to my wrist. Will not ever buy again! Wasted $30😡"
2.0,I didn’t like the fit.  The color and design were awesome.  It just didn’t feel like a comfortable fit on my arms.
2.0,The fit is completely weird. The material is nice however.
2.0,For small ladies the butt looks diaperesque
2.0,I would give this an awesome 5 star review if there wasnt so much glare! Ok glasses if you are able to ignore the glare.
2.0,Not entirely invisible.  Can't get rings to go over the guard.  Nice idea but needs improvement.  Would not recommend this product.
2.0,Fits well but the material is not breathable what so ever! The only thing I like about it sadly is the design.
2.0,The rubber part of the clip slide off and no able to get it back on the clip.
2.0,This band was pretty but poorly made and I question whether it's genuine leather bc it ripped after having worn it 3 times! Amazon processed the refund quickly.
2.0,Battery lasts all but 20 minutes before it dies. It’s also a little hard to connect for it constantly disconnects itself or makes itself “out of range”. Maybe mine was defective. Unable to contact seller regarding this
2.0,"Material is not as stretchy as I was hoping, they don't seem to have a lot of butt coverage. Because of this, there wasn't a lot of waist left for the &#34;high waist.&#34; The waist also was very loose and definitely didn't have any tummy control which is unfortunate. I won't be buying these again and I don't think sizing up would make a difference."
2.0,It said 100% cotton but it feels like polyester
2.0,Doesn't look like in picture
2.0,"The size runs very small. I was sent a large, but ordered a medium. I m glad I received a large in error because even the large fit a bit snug."
2.0,Odd fit up top. I plan to return it.
2.0,"READ THE SIZING! I bought for a 3 MONTH old, not a 3 year old. Unfortunately I bought two different prints....They are cute just not the right size."
2.0,"This came with a broken clasp. I couldn't open it at all and had to replace it. Once I did this, I realized that it doesn't lay well at all. Disappointing."
2.0,"Slit to high, and top is not made for breast"
2.0,Make sure to size up or two
2.0,They look nice however they do not cover as much of the black as the pictures show.  There is a huge color contrast between the band and the watch face and it looks silly.  Returned them
2.0,"Color is a beautiful brown love the sport bra, the leggings were NOT squat proof. I felt like the leggings look more like panty hose . Maybe a different color might work . But I would not recommend. Will be returning. For reference I’m 5’2 134lb"
2.0,Cute boot but they were delivered with broken zipper. Will be returning them
2.0,These run really small. Get about 3 sizes bigger
2.0,I did not get what is advertised. This hoodie is way too thin and the hood is huge. Waited too long for this upset
2.0,"The bra fits as expected. Unfortunately, after one wash, the hooked straps came out of the tops of the cups, and because one of them is poorly sewn, I can't get it back in. I tried using a needle to pull the tight fabric of the loop up, but it didn't work.<br /><br />So basically I bought a strapless bra. Too bad I never use them."
2.0,"I wanted to like this dress, because the material is so cute and the price was great. Unfortunately it ran huge. I normally wear a size 4 in dresses and ordered the smallest size for this one. The back piece was several inches too large and the chest area was really loose/revealing too. Bummer!!"
2.0,I bought a large and it was really big wish it fit correctly cause it’s super cute
2.0,The leggings ripped with the first wear. The top doesn’t have much support if you have a bigger chest.
2.0,I really like the strap but my daughter doesn’t like them because they fog up.
2.0,"Love these frames, but.. The only problem: The fancy &#34;Burberry&#34; design on the sides comes unravelled and ultimately peels off. Have gotten these replaced three times and have just given up. :( Love these glasses and the way they look, but very poor construction. Boo."
2.0,The material is very cheap and sort of stiff.
2.0,"The images are almost comically stretched out.<br />The product images depict skulls that will line up with your own face/jaw. That’s not at all what you get. The imagine is stretched across the entire (extremely thin, but you get what you pay for....) thing so when you’re wearing it you have no idea what you’re even looking at. The main features, the skull ones are practically garbage because there’s no knowing what it is. Your face is indeed covered to go into a store, but seriously it makes no sense to stretch the image like this."
2.0,"I was so exited for my new pointe shoes, especially at this price.  Although when i received them in the mail they were way to small.  I am a size nine is every shoe i have and these fit no where good.  I am  so sad because now i have to miss a class with pointe shoes.  They are beyond uncomfortable."
2.0,Cheap quality. The shirt looked dingy and faded after one wash cycle. Would not recommend this item to future buyers.
2.0,Tore at seams very quickly
2.0,I returned this dress!  I ordered a size larger then I normally wear and it was too small.
2.0,"These are all pretty much the same size, no midi rings.  Also, the gold tone/paint was already chipped off on several rings upon arrival."
2.0,"I'm very sad with this product. The etching is rough and within two days, two of the charms fell off (I bought 4 bracelets). I was able to hear one of them as it fell to the floor, but the other charm is lost somewhere."
2.0,"Letters came off 2nd day wearing it.they  gave refund but no replacement,,honestly refund was fine."
2.0,"This purse was purchased for me off my Amazon wishlist. When I first received and started using it, I really enjoyed the style and space. Other reviewers who stated it is spacious but doesn't seem bulky are spot on.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the hardware that attaches the purse to the shoulder strap broke at 10 days of use- while walking on a sidewalk covered in snow none the less. Thus, my belongings were wet because snow had managed to enter the purse between the time in which the hardware broke and I was able to pick it up off the ground.<br /><br />The bag was not overstuffed with especially heavy items, so I am very disappointed in the break. The purse is large and has two straps at different lengths- a selling point for me. I will try to find a way to replace the broken strap and keep using it."
2.0,Way too small. My granddaughter might like it.
2.0,"The vinyl is not thick enough, the zipper keeps sticking and the traps can't support the bag well because of the quality of the vinyl."
2.0,I really liked pattern on skirt but black material on top looked very thin and looked like it would start pilling quickly.  Returned.
2.0,I love the softness of the slipper and the color. However they are too wide and slip off of my feet usually as walking.
2.0,"Cute, but every clasp has broken."
2.0,"Let me start by saying I loved the print. That is the only reason why I didn't give this product a 1 star. However, I was very disappointed to find that the seam that should have been in the back was right down the middle of my dress (as seen in pictures). The sizing would have been spot on everywhere else but it's quite long. I'm 5'7&#34; and curvy so I ordered an XL and it was dragging on the floor. I'm also top heavy and since the dress is Lycra-Ish (stretchy material) it fit well but then looks lighter than the rest of the dress when adding a little stretch. It was not too tight, just not printed correctly. Quality assurance was not done on this product. I am returning my dress."
2.0,"Worn once. The brown leather is tearing after one use. Disappointing. I love my gold band and plan to purchase more. I just want a replacement. Love the watch, cheap bands"
2.0,The material is not as soft as I had hoped. Cheap stitching. Color was great and the side hang is cute. I was just looking for a softer feel. Also the material has a strong odor
2.0,Didn't like metal closure. Plain leather strap would be easier to close. Calendar too small to read. I sent it back.
2.0,"These goggles do not fit well. They boast being able to block the wind, and were recommended for cutting onions and blocking the offensive sting. The problem is, there is a large gap between the foam padding and your face, the goggles don't have much flex, therefore they don't provide a snug fit.<br /><br />If the goggles flexed more, they might block the wind better.  The foam feels well made,  and appears to be adhered to the frame well enough.  Just needto flex more."
2.0,The ring turned quickly after I purchased it. It's embarrassing to wear and it's condition
2.0,Material feels like rubber
2.0,belt too short.  size not noted.  could not give away cause friend couldn't use easily
2.0,I wanted to love this shirt. The fabric is lovely and comfortable. It fits. But the cross hatch detail in the front is flumpy...doesn't sit right. I change my mind every time. Headed to the donation pile probably.
2.0,Doesn't make me look any different
2.0,"Basically a throw away necklace to wear once or twice.  Cute but messy, the threads fall out everywhere."
2.0,"Bought for 5 yr old for Christmas. Within 1 month she had obliterated them and I ordered a second pair. Second pair began coming unglued at the seams within one week - so much so that I thought the new pair was the original pair I'd replaced. Wouldn't pay more than $5 for these where quality is concerned. Wouldn't waste your time or money. Once you buy a pair, your little Shopkins junkie will insist on another when they wear out and you'll be in a perpetual cycle of purchasing very overpriced (knock off) shoes monthly or tell them no more and make them very sad!<br /><br />These are made in China &#34;flea market&#34; shoes for sure!"
2.0,Very tiny. And the back part got damaged when I was taking it out of the package. I don't recommend to buy this.
2.0,"I bought a pair and when they arrived there was a hole in the seam.  I contacted amazon and they quickly sent me a new pair.  Sadly these also have a hole in the crotch seam.  They are so soft and fit great, but I'm disappointed in the quality.  I'm returning both pairs for a refund."
2.0,Bueno pero pensé que era más grande
2.0,"Cute design but see-through, top was tight, and looked faded and worn after first wash."
2.0,This runs extremely small!  I wear a size 4 and the medium was way too small for me.
2.0,Not good quality. I returned it.
2.0,Can never get to unlatch.  Had to cut it off!
2.0,Ordered for work a medium but it is tight and material is not a good quality.
2.0,Fabric didn’t hold up well. If you get this also get a fabric shaver.
2.0,The coating on the out side of the lens has started to flake off. I take care of my sunglasses and keep them in a case when not in use.  I cleaned them the other day with a lens wipe and the coating flaked off in three spots.
2.0,"Much smaller than I expected (can't imagine why it's called a Large Star Pendant), even though the overall dimensions are included in the description. Still, the bail is much too small for the 6.5mm stainless steel chain I also purchased to go with this pendant. The chain that comes with it is delicate and thin, way too short to even fit completely around my neck, and therefore useless - I tossed it. The craftsmanship of the pendant is mediocre, and I feel this product is over-priced for its true worth. Maybe one day I'll have a chain that will fit with this pendant (in which case I would wear it), but for now it will sit in a tray in my junk drawer until then. Knowing what I know now, I would not have purchased it."
2.0,These were too small in the wrist and were uncomfortable to wear for more than a few minutes.  My wrists are between small and medium so this should not have been a problem.
2.0,The onesie feels like a regular quality onesie but there are string that are poking out. I haven't washed it yet so there is really no reason for the strings Also when I went to adjust the tutu the bow just fell right off. It was absolutely not sewed on very well. The sequence kept falling off but that is to be expected.<br />Giving 2 stars because even though the quality wasn't good my baby sure looked cute in the outfit.
2.0,"I received this package yesterday and the pants are missing.  I like the jacket, but I need the pants too."
2.0,Way to small for an adult !
2.0,"I'm very disappointed with this jumper.  The material is so thin and the dye is not set, so even the initial buttoning of the jumper, I got dye all over my hands. Hand washing took seven times to get the water to become light gray.<br /> The pockets are set way too low.<br /> if you are going to even attempt to use these pockets, your arms will have to be twice as long.  Maybe there decorative or supposed to be like cargo pockets but they are made like something that should be at your hip not here mid thigh.<br />Because I know it'll cost me money to return it, I took off the pockets and I'm going to put one at the chest like a pair of overalls and the other at the hip.<br /> And even with that I doubt these will last more than a season the material is just too thin and is already snagged badly when I removed the pockets."
2.0,"Shirt seemed to be fine quality, the sizing was in T-Shirt sizes so I ordered a XL and what came was a metric sized dress shirt which equated to a small or medium t-shirt size."
2.0,"there is an area next to the front foot, that almost looks like there was supposed to be another paw and it broke off. kind of goddy looking."
2.0,Way too small and I am  small
2.0,"Not nearly as cool or sturdy as in the picture.  Flops over, doesn't stand up. Looks kinda cheap. Wasn't worth it."
2.0,"Although beautiful, it is very small as if for child pre-teen. Not womens size."
2.0,"I bought this for use as an adult and the hairband with the ears fits great and is cute.  The tail, however is very short and is made in a permanent 'kink'.  The tail is more of a dime-store kid quality than it appears.  Would be good to list the overall length of the tail in the sales description and that it has a permanent kink made into it like the tail has been broken."
2.0,"0% stretch<br />Not for big breast at all, I'm the slightest.<br />Did not look like picture on simple appearance AND the material IS 100% different than the picture. Lol it it terrible 😩"
2.0,Way to large for your face
2.0,"These earrings are cute and the ones I got seem fine.  However, there were only five in my package NOT six.  And two of them are identical."
2.0,"Cute. But they don’t stay on. The clips are TINY and not regular alligator clips. Also the clips have ribbon glued all the way inside, which in my opinion makes them even worse because they do not grip the hair. But they are cute. Just not very functional."
2.0,"Color was great, but the goggles leaked the entire time I was swimming. Really unfortunate because they matched my suit perfectly!"
2.0,I purchased this ring because it's supposed to be tungsten carbide.  I'm allergic to nickel.  After wearing it for 2 days I broke out and had to return it.
2.0,I haven't even had these shoes 1 year and rain water is getting inside. I spent good money for these shoes. I'm not happy.
2.0,"Wish it was better quality, but unfortunately, it was like wearing paper. I don't know if it would repel any water???<br />My daughter loved the pattern and colors, but just not able to use it."
2.0,Well made but way to small
2.0,"Sooooo beautiful! Too small :(  Even for the smallest people in my life, can't give it to any adult."
2.0,"I'm a short person, with slim arms and this sleeves don't stay in its place, always go down. Definitely I when I come back Colombia I prefer by the sleeves to the people on the traffic light."
2.0,Very disappointed in the charm.  Not at all as bright and colorful as the picture.  Very dull color and could hardly see the color and clover.
2.0,The pink doesn't look like the same as advertised.  The material  and quality is not very good. The lining is not pink but cheap black fabric.
2.0,"This is a lovely dress in theory, but in reality it doesn't fit right.  I'm a size 6-8 and the Med size was too tiny to even get on.  Would have had to buy a Large or XL to fit my American sized Med body.  Be aware that most of the Vine clothing is off-brand and Asian made, so the quality is questionable and the sizing will be extremely small."
2.0,I bought a large and the tag say large but it fits more like a medium.
2.0,The dress is very cute but the fabric is incredibly thin so it's see through. If it was made out of slightly thicker fabric it would've been perfect. I'll be returning.
2.0,"After washing, they shrunk up so bad that they slip down my waist while wearing. VERY uncomfortable and embarrassing."
2.0,The image. Began peeling after the 1st wash.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this...but..it is way too large..I wear a medium and this is huge. The worst thing about this item is that it is made badly..one side of it..the front hem to be specific, hangs lower than the other. I know that my body is not lopsided, it is not perfect but definitely not lopsided. I have never had anything look like this. It is not a flattering item to wear. Not pleased at all with this purchase and I will not be buying more. I gave it a try before buying more colors and I am glad that I did."
2.0,Not the quality I was looking for
2.0,Way too big and long. Won't stay off the shoulder as others have said. For the price I'm keeping it as a gym shirt.
2.0,"I usually wear a women's small for dresses in this same style (I'm a 34B), but this was difficult to zip up and had a bit of a &#34;muffin top.&#34;  The fabric is not what I anticipated - very smooth and flowey, seems fairly cheap."
2.0,"For the price, the quality isn’t that great. The material is very thin and see through"
2.0,"I’m 5’ 7” and 150lbs.  Got a Large.  I got it on, but the shoulder had a poor sewer line, and the material felt very thin, so that it wouldn’t drape the way it’s pictured.  It was also too short.  The sleeves were sewen in rolled up position but even if I ripped the stitches, there wasn’t enough material there to be a long sleeve.  The shape of the dress is too drastic and reminds me of oompa loompa pants."
2.0,It’s hard to tell from the picture but this sweater is thin and to thick at the same time. It’s a little tight and ugly as sin. It’s fluffy like the inside of your red wing slips after a year of wear. That’s the out side by contrast the inside is rough and feels to light to be called sweater.
2.0,Should have passed on these as they look cheap and damage easily.
2.0,I ordered this for my daughter size 10 women’s thinking they would be BIG. They fit her perfectly so there is no way this is sized in men’s sizes. Perfect for her but do not order thinking of it in men’s size! Also one eye doesn’t wiggle like it should.
2.0,"Great watch, but this price is $200 ABOVE full retail. You can walk into an authorized dealer and pay significantly less with a five year warranty."
2.0,Very cheap. Not like the picture.
2.0,I love the sunflower pattern. The wallet itself is way to bulky. It doesn't have enough card slots. The strap isn't long enough to cross over on my shoulder. It's not what I expected it to be. :(
2.0,I'm 5'10&#34; 220 lbs athletic. The rear clasp does not stay clipped to the shirt. Opening your pants and Reaching down in them multiple times per day geta old fast.
2.0,"very heavy, no under hair strap or tie to keep on and not very flexible. Disappointed, I had to buy another one at the last minute."
2.0,Rayon material. Wrinkly and shows all your flaws. Returned.
2.0,"This zipper pull or purse/backpack fob looked great in the photos and it does have nice bright colors, but it looks from the photos like it will be about this size or a quarter or a nickel, whereas when this arrived it is practically microscopic!  This was a gift for my mom and she cannot make out what is depicted on it.  Also the lobster clasp that is there ostensibly to attach it to a purse or zipper handle is so small that it is really difficult to try to fit it onto a normal handbag zipper.  Not sure it's worth sending back but I would not buy this again or recommend it.  I also find the seller's listing misleading--yes, photos are often magnified but sellers should make it really clear that is what they are doing and should clearly indicate the actual size when they are using highly magnified photos.  Not cool."
2.0,Not what I expected and had to return it.
2.0,"The back of this leotard is lovely.  Unfortunately, I made the assumption that the front looked like the other leotards I was looking at, with a neckline that would be around collarbone.  The front is a deep V-neck, and reveals far too much cleavage."
2.0,"Great looking and comfortable lounge wear. HOWEVER, after one wash, the right outer and left inner seams fell apart. Now using as a rag. Sad that the workmanship was so shoddy."
2.0,They Broke in 2 days by just placing them on
2.0,The material is soft but when its stretched it makes the pattern faded. But the most disappointing part is that people say these are like the align but the waistband is not at all. There is a 1/4 inch elastic in the waist band that pinches your waist.
2.0,"cute but fabric is see through and the shoulder bows, you have to tie yourselves"
2.0,Bought for a 2-year old with a slightly larger than average sized head.  They were ridiculously tight and had to go back.  No way would they have lasted through age 4!
2.0,"This bathing suit is so cute but it doesn't fit me and came with a stain on the inside of bathing suit top. I ordered a medium, which is the usual size I wear. I'm 5'7"" a 37 in bust and 37 in hip. I'm going to return it and get another one. I was so hoping it would fit..."
2.0,I loved the silhouette but the arms are way to small!! The color isn’t correct I was expecting khaki and opened to find it be light pink. I was really bummed because I would still wear it if the arms weren’t to tight. It ruins the whole jacket.
2.0,La use para navegar y los broches soltaron óxido y la mancharon. No resiste para el mar.
2.0,But doesnt hold its shape and fell of my arm
2.0,"Small, non-breathable, wobbly and no support. Very surprised at Hoka. Had to send these back."
2.0,"Fit was fine and not too clingy, unfortunately felt like the fabric was too thin to be modest. Hanes shirt is much nicer fabric for this price point."
2.0,The material did not suite the purpose of the weather I wanted it for. Too soft
2.0,Not a good quality material. Does not fit well.
2.0,"They are very cute, but they do not stay in place. I got them to keep my hair out of my face during kickboxing, but they just straight up fall off with activity."
2.0,discolored like oxidation in blotches that won’t polish off.  Looked nice for a short time.
2.0,The RGB7 version is not colored.  The lights are only white.  If you think you’re getting a colorful display you would be wrong.
2.0,It’s my child’s size but for some reason it’s big. Not the correct size for him. Need to order one size down.
2.0,"This hat looks good on the site, but it is made of very thin, floppy material & is made for a larger head."
2.0,"Use the product for a sweet sixteen birthday gift, I’m very disappointed, embarrassed and unhappy that the product was not in good condition instead of a nice shiny sterling silver it is tarnish and dark!  Products should be inspected before mailing them out!😔😔"
2.0,"These socks get 2 stars because they fit and I like the design/ look of them.  They are too thin.  When wearing you feel every thing you step on, I'm talking a stand of hair even.  With shoes they rub and you blister.  I would not recommend if you prefer soft cushiony socks."
2.0,"Can hardly see the gold and the handle is so tiny it doesn't look like a handle at all.  When I first opened it, it looked like a little elephant.  I returned it."
2.0,I had to return this top.  The pockets made it flare at the hips in a very non flattering way.  Going to stick with the no pocket version from now on.
2.0,"Not only is this bag much smaller than I expected, it's also stiff, and the zipper is oddly placed; all of these factors make it difficult to fit anything in the bag. The pockets are practically nonfunctional. I've owned evening clutches with more storage space. Also, the strap hardware is stiff and cheap. I frequently have to force it to pivot so the strap will hang properly, without twisting. I only gave this bag two stars because it does look like the image, but if it weren't such a hassle I would have returned it."
2.0,Just got the outfit and the belt styrofoam material melted and stuck onto the plastic bag which then peeled off when I took the costume out of the bag. Possible melt due to the extreme hot weather last couple of days. Such a waste.<br />The arms are also very tight.
2.0,"Received this dress for an event and it wasn’t the dress for me. First thing the dress was very heavy and a thick material that wasn’t ideal for a summer event. Secondly, the dress was very unflattering if you have any type of tummy or booty. I bought the dress in pink, it may look better in black!"
2.0,"I thought this would be good for my 5'1&#34;  petite frame, since people complained about it being short. It's an ok length... Actually longer than I was expecting, and didn't hug my figure in a flattering way. I think this would be best for a 5'3&#34;-5'5&#34; small-medium woman with longer legs than torso."
2.0,Nice to have an inner glove that's easy to use while temps are really cold. Outer glove isn't warm enough for below freezing temps while skiing .
2.0,No dura
2.0,I thought I’d look hot in these on my beach trip but I looked like a was wearing a oversized sports bra from the back. It held my boobs up but not what I was expecting.
2.0,"it has a lot of strech, the material was ok, my waist is 32, hips 46 and it didn't fit right, it was too big around my waist, fine around my hips, it fit weird around my crotch area didn't like it."
2.0,Belt is poor quality. Disappointed
2.0,"So I looked at the size chart which said US size 8 would be an XL well I ordered the XL and I’d say is more of a 12-14 if not bigger. So annoying, returning and getting a medium and hoping that solves the problem but we will see."
2.0,"I ordered these pins as a one day delivery which was great!  Got them on time.  I really wasn't expecting a whole lot since there were 50 pins and it didn't cost a whole lot of money.  But I was a little disappointed that 5 of the pins didn't work at all and roughly 5 pins were faded.  Kinda like it was a bad paint job. I was only able to use about 35 of the pins.  2 of the pins didn't have the switch that turns them on and off and I was missing safety pins on a few.  Luckily I didn't need all 50 on that day.  Keep that in mind if you need ALL 50 pins.  They are little flexible soft rubber glued to a 1/2 inch plastic circle that houses a tiny LED light.  There is a tiny safety pin that comes with it, but it is not attached to the pin.  You open the safety pin and feed it thru a hole in the plastic, but if the plastic is not shut properly the safety pin stays pinned, but the pin itself falls off.  They are hard to pin onto clothing with the pins that were provided.  Problem is the pin was so small you could barely get a tiny pinch of fabric in the pin.  Some of the pins would then end up upside down lol.  When the lights were flashing you really couldn't tell anyway.  But it was cute watching all my co-workers blinking while we were eating in the conference room.  If you are expecting regular quality LED pins these are not for you.  They are great for young kids and Adults who aren't too picky about what the pin looks like.  They also didn't last much longer than 6 hours or so.  I'd give an extra star if all of the pins worked.  Like I said for the price it was ok, but only if all the pins worked.  Sigh."
2.0,Color isnt what i ordered. Cant get links out and tool broke. Took to jewelery stores and no one will touch it. So have watch that cant wear.
2.0,"If you're a size 8 and above, don't bother buying these. The were the worse. I'm a sz 8, and basically gave them to my 16yr. These are for little girls, or women so small, that they appear childlike in body. This ain't for no Puerto Rican thighs."
2.0,couldn’t see the floral design and was too short (because of larger hips)
2.0,"Although this is a good bra, it is extremely uncomfortable. It pokes under the arms and the straps are plastic, not very sturdy. If I wear it only sometimes though, it serves its purpose."
2.0,"These are not no-show socks unless you're wearing some pretty tall sneakers.  I tried to use them for boat shoes and a pair of Vans that are sort of halfway between boat shoe cut and a running shoe. Completely visible in both, so I returned them which was an easy process.  They did seem to be of good quality, but definitely didn't work for what I wanted."
2.0,Smelled like chemicals and fits very tightly mind you I have a 27 inch waist
2.0,"It too big for my baby,very big it can fix 5 years old girl."
2.0,"These masks are built nice enough but they are for a child, too small for an American adult male."
2.0,Everything else I bought from this company ran sooooooooo small. My kid couldn’t even wear it. But this top was ok
2.0,quality is not good
2.0,Ordered 18 mo size and what was sent probably wouldn't fit a newborn! The box it was shipped in was unnecessary as it was so large it would have held 3000 outfits! Box came damaged and if it wasn't for all the packaging material the outfit would have fallen out.
2.0,"Bigger than I expected and seem like the post will separate from back if earring quickly.  Love the color and design though, just don't expect them to hold up over the years."
2.0,"Wayyyyy too big. Even when I exchanged it bc I thought it was just a mistake, the replacement was just as big. I kept it for the future bc it is very cute."
2.0,"They are long and bunch up in the bag. I purchased them because they are cute, they have already started unravelling"
2.0,This looks very but the it green nob fell off and it has stopped working
2.0,way to large... material felt good tho.
2.0,"I thought these were great, but, my one year old broke them while just walking, on the 3rd wear."
2.0,received an ipad cover instead of a hat.  same color though.
2.0,"I had to trim these to fit my glasses, which I expected, but the ""stick-on"" doesn't stick very well on my polycarbonate lenses. I have used the ones you apply with water in the past and these are similar but not as good, which is to say worthless. The adhesive side is so low adhesive that you can't tell which side it is. If you do manage to press them in place so they stay for a little while they have the same air bubble problem as the water application ones do, which obscures vision and hard as I tried I could not get rid of them no matter how I applied them. It appears they worked for a few other reviewers but not for me. I imagine they might work better on glass lenses, especially larger round lenses where they might not need to be trimmed to fit."
2.0,The white pants are see through. I am returning these.
2.0,Its honestly really weird and short. I feel like something with the &#34;drapey&#34; look like this would fit &#34;drapey&#34;. I'm 5'5&#34; about 125lbs I got the M and its still pretty short on me. Its also that weird clingy material that shows every roll and sweat mark. You could easily see my bra line through it. Which I would expect if it was thin but its not really that thin of a fabric. Its also quite a bit of fabric in the front area there because its thicker than it looks. I give it two stars because I like the style and the color- just not the execution of the design. and I did wear it a few times before I gave it to good will.
2.0,"I read the reviews and realized it ran small, so I ordered up two sizes. It is still rather tight for sleepwear. It is soft but I prefer sleep wear to be more loose. Very disappointing."
2.0,Cheap material did not like
2.0,"The pattern of this sweater is really nice, however the inside of it feels really scratchy."
2.0,"This is not a warm jacket, its great in late fall, but not for below freezing temperatures."
2.0,Nice but disappointingly there was a large tear in it upon arrival
2.0,Advertised as having some stretch but did not - returned (larger size not available)
2.0,"This was a long piece of fabric. It did not come with instructions, so I sent it back."
2.0,Cute and look just like the picture but they broke while I was wearing them for the first time.
2.0,"very small, order two sizes larger than you need, look nice and feel nice, hug your stomach it youre looking for something bigger these arent it"
2.0,Barely fits two ties.
2.0,"At first these were great... Fit as expected too. However, these faded and look horrible after less than a month. Two have broken since then, but the last one looks so worn that my husband doesn't even bother to wear it and sticks with his uncomfortable metal ring. Will be looking for a similar product elsewhere next time."
2.0,The straps were different lengths!! One side was significantly longer than the other. They are not adjustable.
2.0,I love the pearl set I bought. Exactly what was pictured. The only issue I had with it was the clasp for the necklace and bracelet were of cheap quality that you would find on kids costume jewelry.  It was very difficult putting them on as the clasp kept turning and slipping from my fingers. Only thing I would suggest is have someone with long nails try and put it on for you. Short nails do not work.
2.0,"Although the cardigan is large enough in the body for my wife who wears a size 8 blouse, the sleeves are almost impossible to get into and out of without help.  My wife is quite slim--5'5&#34; and weighing 120 pounds.  She doesn't have muscular arms. She expected to be able to wear this over a long-sleeved blouse but could hardly get the sleeves of a short-sleeved blouse to lie flat.  The sweater comes with conflicting info as to fiber content.  One side of the hang tag says woolen fabric while the other says acrylic and linen.  Fortunately, the washing instructions tag sewn in the garment says acrylic and linen.  Obviously the manufacturer hadn't printed a tag for this specific item.  She was also disappointed to see dry cleaning recommended in the care instructions or hand washing, flat drying and ironing.  A lot of extra care for a pleasant, but not extraordinary, item."
2.0,"I am returning these......there is nothing really wrong with them, they just seem really cheap and they are huge."
2.0,"My measurements are less than the seller's medium description (36 bust, 28 waist), but when I zipped it up, the waistline became an Empire waist. Sadly, it looks like maternity wear on me. My guess is like 90+% of tops it's designed for a B cup. If you're a B, it will be comfortable and cute, with a nice feminine flare. It's light and stretchy, probably breathes well, and has hand-sized pockets.<br /><br />BUT, the seams are done completely in white under a dark gray stretch fabric, so as soon as you twist, it shows, and there are spots where it showed without any stretch. I crossed my arms to look at the back and thought something had ripped. It's not supposed to do that. If it had fit me well, I'd have just run my serger over it in black. It would have been worth the work for the price and unique cut. But, it didn't, so I had to return it.<br /><br />I'm still toying with the idea of getting the largest size and tailoring it because I love the design and the fabric. It's hard to find hoodies that don't look like hoodies."
2.0,"These are somewhat bigger than the usual eyeglass cases, and look and feel cheaply made. The hinges are stiff. This product is inexpensive and works fine, but I would not buy it again. I'd rather get one case that's a bit nicer."
2.0,Gave to my GF for Christmas and we took to a professional to have it sized and they wouldn't touch it because they said it was cheaply put together that it would most likely break. Still sitting in her drawer not used :(
2.0,Love my bracelet however felt ripped off after seeing the exact same one for less than $10.00!! Got me and it will not happen again.
2.0,"I’ve bought this set before in different colors, but this particular one was too small."
2.0,I was expecting It to be better quality..
2.0,Slick tacky feeling material that clings in all the wrong places.  Unfortunate return
2.0,"nothing like the pic and the neckline is horrible. at least on me, i have large breasts! sleeves too big as well. only good thing is, it has pockets!!"
2.0,"It’s really cute and I wish it would lay properly, but the difference in length between the two chains makes that nearly impossible.  After initially putting the necklace on, it goes all askew and hangs crooked so you’re either left fixing it all the time or leaving it a tangled, lopsided mess."
2.0,RECIEVED WAY TO SMALL.... ordered a size larger still too small
2.0,Soft and comfortable but seam split up the arm after washing it one time.
2.0,Very thin! Nothing like actually sweatpants at all.
2.0,"These slippers looked great and perfect for a Doctor Who fan. Unfortunately they are way too small. I ordered an. XXL, size 11-13, but it fit a men's size 10.  They are also pretty cheap feeling, but I was ok with that because of the low price.<br />It's a cute idea, the design is fun, but there was just no way it would work."
2.0,"Wire gauge of top spring bar makes these feel VERY Flimsy. I bought better on the strip in Vegas for $5, lasted Years before they broke. I'm not too confident in these... hope I'm wrong. had no idea they came from mainland China, either."
2.0,"The &#34;gems&#34; were either glued on cockeyed or they were bumped during the drying process, but they were not seated on the base correctly."
2.0,Pay ore get better
2.0,"I can manage no arch support, but the stated size 7 is too small for my size 7 foot. A little narrow too. Have returned the sandals."
2.0,The chain rips my hair out. I can't wear it until I get a new chain and I'm really disappointed.
2.0,"When I first got it I liked the shiny look to the black shirt but, unfortunately, that's all I ended up liking. The tie that was included was snagged all up and down it and it was way too small for the size of shirt.  Thus, the tie was useless.  The shoulders fit well on my son, but the shirt has a very boxy shape making it far too large around the chest and waste - definitely not a modern fitting type of shirt. Additionally, when I washed the shirt (hoping it would somehow fit better after a wash) it wrinkled up like no dress shirt I have ever seen.  I really wanted to like the shirt, but there's just no reason to."
2.0,It fits well but is not of very high quality!
2.0,"This lower priced version is not as good as the original.  The groove is not as deep and the bands don't stay on it, even brand new ones.  I bought the original when it came out last year, but after 6 months the rose gold finished chipped  away.  I thought I would get this cheaper version and then wouldn't care as much that I had to replace a couple times a year, but it isn't as good as the patented one."
2.0,This jacket does not fit as it looks in the photo. I spent another $45.- to try and get it to look like I expected. I could have just spent $100.- and gotten a really nice jacket.
2.0,"Very thin, cheap looking, waste was very tiny"
2.0,Didnt fit the watch the listing said it would. Not worth the hassle of sending it back. Waste.
2.0,If you want a thin silky strip then you might like these. These &#34;stretchy cotton&#34; headbands are so LIGHT and THIN that they feel like silk. The point is that they have NO BODY WHATSOEVER. They don't stay flat when you put them on. They tend to wrinkle up into a narrow strip.
2.0,"This was really nice and I loved it until I tried to wear it, way too small, and I have fairly small ears. Probably just going to give it to someone else."
2.0,"It was very small; and it was supposed to be 6.5&#34; long, but only measures 6&#34;. It was attractive..."
2.0,"Fabric is super thin and see-through. Also ultra clingy, not something I would wear in public. Maybe as a swimsuit cover up? Or maybe better suited for the less-curvy"
2.0,"I returned it- it just looked so elegant on the picture but was funny looking when I got it. It was also see-through and the sleeves were too loose(where the rubber bands are) so it just didn’t look right. It was also too tight in the chest area so I am guessing it just is not meant for my kind of body. I didn’t like it because the style wasn’t what I expected but if you are into ruffles and stuff, it might work for you."
2.0,"I loved these when I got them. They fit well and were comfortable. However, I maybe wore them a dozen times in the past month and the sole is separating from the boot. I'm extremely disappointed."
2.0,5'8 and 155# avid cyclist.<br />Too tight around the thighs.<br />Padding too wide through the crotch so I'm not exchanging for large.<br />No review on material or comfort as returning so didn't ride with them.
2.0,Fit okay but the material is cheap. Wont last
2.0,"As others have stated, this is a very solid, very attractive piece. It feels well made, the details of the individual charms are very clear and charming. However, the chain feels like it has very sharp, splintery edges on the long sides of the chain links. Additionally, there are a couple areas on the Mother chain that do not appear to be plated all. After only two days of wear, I figure I may just have to get another chain so I don't end up with a scrape down the side of my neck."
2.0,the yellow is much darker than the picture
2.0,"The costume I received came in a plastic bag that looked dirty and was already open on one end. The dress was folded over once and stuffed into the bag.It was very wrinkled and smelled like chemicals, or like someone had already worn it and tried to clean it (It smelled musty to me). Some of the stitching on one of the bows was broken, and if I pulled on the ribbon it would've come right out. The hat was smashed flat and there was no way to get it to fit on my child's head. The hat was WAY too big, like an adult size (my husband put it on and it fit his head.. no way it would fit a 5-year-old). Other than noted above, I didn't see any more problems with the dress. Overall, it seemed like it would make a nice costume. I was just very disappointed at the smell, packaging, and oversized, flat hat. I'm returning it for a refund and going with a company I've bought from before."
2.0,I was trying to order this for my 7 year old and I followed the size chart but when it came it was even too small for my 4 yr old. I had to donate it.
2.0,Bracelets are nice but very small like for a child
2.0,"I’m very dissapointed, the color was not as in the picture (it’s lighter), and the material was not as expected (thin cotton knit).  It fit perfectly but could not use it for the ocassion I bought it for,  it looks cheap.  Not worth the price."
2.0,The selling point was the size 12 X 9. The actual size is 9 X 9.  I guess I'll make the best of it.
2.0,"I loved this ruffle detailed pants, it fit right at the right length and all. Material quality is nice, not cheap. Most of Allegra K outfits fits me really well. But sadly after wearing it around the house and testing the look in the mirror, I just felt it wasn't perfectly fit on my body, main issue is the butt and thigh area. It was too loose on me and hanging on the butt and thigh area. If only it was an extra 2-3 inch slimmer,  I think it would look better. I think it was made for a curvier person."
2.0,Super cute and would have been a great accessory if it hadn't broke in the first 5 minutes of wearing it.
2.0,"I purchased a size small.  I'm 5'1"" and it hung way beyond my bum in the back.  The material is soft, but a thin t-shirt material."
2.0,I purchased both a large and then a large the large was to small and short and the xlarge was huge just didnt look good on me I'm a size 12
2.0,awful material too small its like a halloween costume material!
2.0,"I purchased this dress for a casual outside party. It is an ok quality fabric that looks like it is already starting to pil . Unfortunately the size “small” fit really big like a medium + (perhaps mislabeled?) especially in the waist (I’m 5’6 132 pounds with a D bust ). I would have bought an x-small but it was not an option. In order to wear this dress so it didn’t feel like a muumuu, I had to put a belt around the high waist line which was ok but was awkward and didn’t stay up because of all the xtra fabric. It didn’t fit at all like the girl modeling it who actually is thinner than me, but somehow was much more fitted on her.  So either the sizing was misrepresented or I got a defective dress. I don’t usually buy clothes online for this exact reason. I had planned to return it but forgot about it and realized and tried to return it literally 1 day after Amazon said the return window had closed so now I’m stuck with it. Perhaps it will shrink down to how it was pictured? I also noticed that the price dropped on this after I purchased so also bummed about that as well. Lesson learned."
2.0,I really wanted to love this top.  But it was not comfortable.  The material felt weird.  And the inside was scratchy.
2.0,"Although this boot for true to size (I got it in the mail today) it is absolutely not the same boot in the picture! Which I searched very hard for a specific boot that was NOT all shiny. This boot is all shiny, it does not have the dull color on the top like this picture shows. So I will be giving it 2 stars for the fact that they sent a product that isn’t like the picture!"
2.0,Color was not like in picture. Plus frame was very thin and a bit tight
2.0,The fact septum's are good to try if you want to see how a real one would look on you. Unfortunately these really don't give a realistic idea because it's hard to keep them in place.
2.0,"Iron on is perfect, love the gold. Onesie is very cheap for the price. I wish it were on a better one since it's for a 1st birthday"
2.0,Love the top. Was perfect for the holiday season but before I had it on for a hour the decal began separating from the top. I'm sure I can re-secure it but it speaks to the quality of the shirt. Wouldn't purchase it again.
2.0,Went by the size chart. Ordered xl and it fits my 9 yr old.... so it fits like a small.
2.0,The bow on one of the rings fell off the first time i tried them on ....what a blow !!!!!
2.0,"This was not true to size and was too large.  Also, the way it ties in the front is not very flattering and pulls the fabric strangely."
2.0,It was soaking wet when it arrived.  I smelled as if it had been dropped in a sewer.  It is outside.  Hoping the smell will leave.  Probably not though. I really like the way it looks but can not use it at this point.
2.0,Its a neat collectable but I had to repaint and modify it to my standards... for the price I paid... it should have been better...
2.0,Tie bars are too thick and long for skinny ties. It looks ok on the traditional wider ties.
2.0,This bag is a disappointment.  It is certainly not worth the $132.63 that it is supposedly marked down from.  I have bought better purses for the $22.98 that this one costs.  I can't get it to stand up straight like in the picture.  There are threads sticking out which need to be cut off.  The lining is somewhat stiff and I have yet to find the detachable shoulder strap.  I do not recommend this bag to anyones who wants quality.
2.0,I do not like the material - it doesn’t hang well and it’s too short for my liking.  It also runs very small.  I had already sized up one size - but I workday suggest sizing up two sizes - or just not wasting your money on this one.  Sending it back.
2.0,This was very pretty but I didn’t realize it was fully see through. I didn’t like the fact that I had to wear something underneath it besides a bra so I returned it.
2.0,"Really weird. Got the 7-8 for my small 5.5 year old & they’re nearly too small. Really really slick. And, strangely, very little stretch in the actual leg part (and she has small legs). Would not purchase again"
2.0,Broke after a month!!!<br /><br />Loved it when I first got it!!
2.0,The shirt is very tight a size XL is med
2.0,To small after washing great if wife was 8
2.0,Order a size up from your normal. They run small. This is weird because i have the same ones in medium and they fit fine.
2.0,"I returned this item. Photograph is deceiving - the model must be a teenager - it barely comes down to your waste, NOT your hips. Also, it says that the garment is made of organic cotton - it doesn't feel soft, like good cotton does, and has lycra or spandex. I personally don't like the quality of material or the cut, but like the original graphics and like that they are on the back, leaving the front plain and simple."
2.0,Size was good but quality was poor
2.0,My daughter said the inside of this was scratchy and she didn’t like the feeling of the outside. This is not a breathable material!
2.0,"Wanted to love this, but the sleeves were way too tight for the rest of the shirt. It’s almost like the wrong size sleeves were sewn on."
2.0,"Received the Bracelet.  I was disappointed with it's appearance.  Granted there would be some differences between the picture and what you receive as no two are alike, but where in the picture does it show orange/pink hues to the stones and pink hues in the turquoise coloring. Plus the pinkish stones do not look like they are set well in the settings.  I am not happy with the coloring at all.  The bracelet metal itself is well made and polished.<br />It was disappointing to us as we consider it dramatically different from the Amazon photo.  The seller should several different photos so the public knows the degree of variation.  We will not buy from this seller again."
2.0,to small for a adult more of a purse for teens
2.0,"cinch cord end holder does not keep cord in as it should,  good thing for gorilla glue.  Wore for four months not everyday and did not hold up as expected.  I only walked on paved surfaces.  Very disappointed on quality.  First time sandal wearer, loved wearing sandles but can't afford to buy these every couple of months.  Will probly try different brand.<br /><br />Jim H"
2.0,"The adjustable strap that holds the maskon your head doesn't stay attached, which is extremely annoying. It doesn't really change your voice so much as amplify it, like a cheap kids' microphone. I bought this for my son and we were both underwhelmed. It's very cheaply made for the price. He's enjoyed cheap Halloween costume masks more than this one."
2.0,"I purchased one pair previously. It was the bright orange featured first in the offering here, I liked by it so much I bought another right away, exactly the same great fit etc. BUT then branching out with another color left me seriously dissatisfied, very poor fit running at all least one size smaller relative to size accuracy and not as many cool features."
2.0,"I had ordered this hat expecting the one in the picture. Oddly enough I got the same hat I bought from a different company and paid half the price for. One size does NOT fit all. It's huge, and it looks like nothing in the picture. The picture looks just like the one I was issue from the military only Navy Blue, so I finally thought I found what I was looking for. I was way wrong. This is nothing like the standard issued ones. They fit very large, and are of different design. I also paid double almost triple the price (due to thinking it was the one I was looking for.) Not happy with it at all."
2.0,"The material was OK – but was tighter than expected, and the belt hang loose sometimes, and sometimes it became tighter on the other end."
2.0,Way to small. The design of the fabric was as expected. The quality was good. Just be sure and order a size or 2 bigger.
2.0,"Cute cat, but hoop was super thin and flimsy.i returned it, too cheap. If it was on a thicker hoop, I would have loved it."
2.0,Numbers are too small
2.0,Just didn't like the way it fit on me.  Not crazy about the fabric.  Returning.
2.0,"This dress will be a house dress.  It looked an felt like a slightly, almost sexy Mrs. Roper dress (Yes Mrs Roper from Three's Company).  A lot of extra material, going a size small would not fix this.  It is comfy,  but again I would not leave the house in it.  Also I am 5'7,  If I were 5'10 there would still be a lot of material."
2.0,"The fit was great, I would have given these pants 5 stars if the elastic hadn't broken"
2.0,"So disappointed. I wanted a loose fitting shirt, but I'm absolutely swimming in it! I look ridiculous wearing it. Maybe would've worked had I ordered 2 sizes smaller."
2.0,"My shoe size is 8.5, but this sandals does not match with the size chart, it's bigger.<br />You can see the difference.<br />Sadly it's can't be return or exchange for a smaller one."
2.0,"The material in the picture is made to look silky, but it person it’s thin, cheap and crunchy. I purchased a large, and it fit like a small. Don’t waste your money. The only pretty thing about these is the print. Even the pants were extremely long."
2.0,"I was really excited about getting these and it turned out to be a disappointment. Although I ordered a size Medium the product I received was sized as a Small/Medium. The fabric seemed really nice and the design was really cute but (I'm guessing to accommodate the &#34;small&#34; side of S/M) the crotch area was cut way too small, resulting in a really terrible camel toe. Also, the company advertises their nice box packaging and the product I received came in a plastic zipper bag. Was very disappointed and had to return."
2.0,1 showed up bent and kind of fragile like it was going to break
2.0,"Great glasses for office wear, but the ear bands are VERY TIGHT, they cause headaches every time. If you have a wide head, you’ll need to bend them to fit properly."
2.0,"It’s pretty, but the quality is not worth what it costs. I think it is very much over priced."
2.0,cant zip it up
2.0,"I bought the blue. The color is nothing like what's advertised and the material does not have the texture like the photo. It's nice enough fabric, but not what I was expecting. Sending back."
2.0,Material was cheaper feeling than expected. Not flattering at all
2.0,"These shed so bad and within minutes, the ears looked horrible! The “fur” looked like a bad haircut! Once all the shedding fake fur is gone, they might look better."
2.0,They are really pretty but the rosary came in 3 pieces!!!  They were broken & the middle group only had 9 crystals which was suppose to have 10.
2.0,"Itchy., also a lil boxy"
2.0,"I bought this for my daughter to use and it definitely did not last long. She's had it for 2 months and the ink is wearing off and the closure is cracked and almost broken through. We didn't expect a whole lot for the price and it is a very cute pattern. She's also dropped her phone quite a bit and it seems to have protected the phone, which I guess is the main purpose of a case. That's about all of it's saving graces. But it's pretty much needing to be replaced very soon, which my daughter is very bummed about."
2.0,Didn’t fit well. Shoulders and bust small.<br />Fabric and delivery time were good.
2.0,"I wish I would have listened to the other review on this item... I figured since I’m on the smaller side of S (I wear a size 4 and S is 4-6) I would be OK even if I did have to go a size up since I would be in the small range... WRONG!!!! Also, I’m 5 ft tall and the pull of the garment since it doesn’t fit crotch to shoulders is mind blowing"
2.0,"Sadly, one arrived with a flaw. The lace is pretty, but I won’t be able to wear them to my function on Friday."
2.0,"The eggs don't stay open, they just fall shut. The glasses have plastic lenses which are unnecessary for toddler play, and a potential safety hazard."
2.0,"I ordered a size XL based on the chart they would be perfect.  Well let me tell you they DO NOT!  I couldn't even get them up to my low thighs.  They are TINY.  No way could a woman who wears a size 14 get her hinnie into these.  So, back they go.<br />Hint sellers - do yourselves a favor and use a proper size chart so you don't have to eat the return shipping."
2.0,Super tight very uncomfortable
2.0,They don't look as good in person. They just make my feet look huge. And they are kind of hard to get on your feet. I will be returning these
2.0,Way too small to put any picture in it. Why make a locket you can't put a picture in? Especially if it opens? I eventually did get a picture in it after multiple attempts...but it's so small you can barely tell who it is.
2.0,"It’s definitely for bustier women, good material but the top is a little Grammaish"
2.0,The shoe looks great but as far as comfort.. No stars had them on less than an hour and couldnt wait to take them off.. Toe support cuts in to you baby toe. Also there is not enough padding on the tongue where your laces ties up on your bridge. I was very disappointed
2.0,"It was what it said it was and got there quickly but it won't latch on to my fit2, making it unusable."
2.0,Very durable!!!
2.0,"The color is great, but one of the straps won't click into place. I know it's the strap because the one that does fit, works on both sides of the watch."
2.0,These ended up almost being a kid sized glove. Not happy with the size on these. I understand the knit/stretch one-size-fits all winter gloves - but these are tiny.
2.0,"The package came, and one of the earrings arrived broken. The necklace appeared fine, but I was disappointed overall."
2.0,Somehow I paid 23 dollars for this and it doesn't snap shut. Usually i wouldn't write this kind of review but this bugs me a lot. For $23 for a compact mirror made in China you'd expect top quality. The Tattler twins' pic is good though. And now the price suddenly lowered by several dollars... Seems it was raised because i expressed a lot of interest in it. Hopefully we can resolve this
2.0,I upsized to a medium due to the reviews and it was still very tight.  I'm wondering if the scalloped edges with begin to fray over time???  I thought the fabric would be a bit heavier too.
2.0,One looks like a star.  The other earring is totally misshapen.  Keeping because not worth returning.
2.0,"(2.5 almost a 3? I'll explain)<br />These earrings are rather pretty. They have the whole feathers and beads thing going for them. I especially like the look of the white pair. (For reference, these are style-2) They still look pretty when you get them but they have their share of problems.<br />They are a bit heavy so you have a little lob drooping. Not a significant amount but it's there. For short wear they would be fine enough. The biggest problem is that they aren't the best made earrings. The chains that hang down look okay but one of them was already broken off of the red pair of earrings when it arrived. The chains don't seem to be of a super strong or sturdy brand so I was a little leery about straightening them out since they were a bit kinked up on both pairs. I was so afraid I was going to break them I just left a kink or two in them.<br />I really hate when I rate something low because I want to love things but I have to be honest as well. I couldn't get to a three because I don't know that these would hold up for very long. They are pretty. They just aren't all that well made."
2.0,"The mechanism is brilliant but the finish on the leather turned tacky.  It sticks to the surface of denim and also sticks to itself in spots where it overlaps and pulls the finish off.<br /><br />Great box, nice mechanism but bad leather processing."
2.0,"did not like, but I gave them to someone that did like them so I am happy"
2.0,The tops fit nice but the pants ran very small.  i ordered 3 different and every pant was small.
2.0,It would be a great sandal if sizes were true.  The sizes run small.
2.0,Ugly material
2.0,They are gray not navy blue & poor quality material.
2.0,"The suit was very nice, but the sizing chart definitely did not provide the expected results.  Order at least a size larger.  Be aware that you will have to keep after them for the full refund."
2.0,Won’t stay on my daughter’s feet.
2.0,It was only $4 but it has a lot of defects in the way it's made. I don't wear this. Waste of money.
2.0,"Sent the wrong color, but nice scarf. Bummed."
2.0,The zippers on 2 broke the first time I used them. Not impressed!
2.0,Not very good fit of your tall and lean.  Had to cinch belly
2.0,"The hat is quality, but it looks like a typical baseball cap when it is put on. ! was expecting something a it more classy for the money."
2.0,"I’ve actually had this exact piece of gorgeous jewelry before and lost it. Well, the one that actually looked like the one in the picture that is. But it was from a different place. When I got this in the mail I was shocked that one of the reviewers that said it was different and cheaply made, was literally on point. It looks like the pic but different. It’s much smaller width wise, fatter height wise, and the purple crystal is much darker. It’s still pretty but it didn’t make me happy. I wasn’t even sad when I lost this one too. I was actually more sad when I first saw it than when I lost it. I’ll be ordering from somewhere else for the real one again. Hope I don’t lose it this time because it’s really beautiful. I got compliments on it everyday, everywhere I went."
2.0,Runs very small- I ordered a XXL and it fit like a Large. Also not as long as shown in picture. The jersey fabric is nice but it doesn't fit well
2.0,"I needed this dress for a costume for a swing dance to ""Baby It's Cold Outside.""  When I received the costume in the mail some of the stitching was coming out.  It was definitely not in a wearable condition.  Thankfully I know how to sew so I was able to alter it and it was perfect for the dance.  If you are smaller chested this must be altered before you can wear it."
2.0,"Main complaint is the fabric, its not soft at all its very hard scratchy plastic feeling. Not the most pleasant thing to wear, which is a shame because the colors they offer are great, this ones really great looking in person. The cut is kind of loose and boxy, like a sweatshirt, it did shrink length wise so not ideal for a person with a longer torso."
2.0,Not too impressed..socks slide down my feet during workout..tried smaller pack before I put too much $$<br />Comfortable just don’t stay put 😢
2.0,"I am going to have to return this suit.  I am 5'7&#34; and a 36 C cup; I ordered an XL (I usually wear an 8 or a L).  The bottom fit okay; it's cut a little high in the butt area. It really should have more coverage back there.  I would keep it but the top is not going to work.  It is way to small to be considered an XL.  The cups are more of a small B cup.  It covered very little of my breast.<br /><br />I don't know how well this suit would age because I haven't worn it out and as I stated above I am returning it; However, judging by the material it may hold up for one summer.  The color of the suit is a little off as well. I ordered the green; The color in the photos are a strong, rich green but what I received is more of a muted/faded looking green.  The pattern is the same as the photo.<br /><br />Compared to the other suit I ordered at the same time, the quality of the material is inferior."
2.0,"Very cheaply made, as expected. It literally fell apart when I took it out of the packaging. I was able to fix it, but still."
2.0,"The bag itself is gorgeous, and came looking just as I expected. The quality seems great, and the fabric, handles, and hardware all seem heavy-duty enough that I don't think I'll have the same ripping problems some people have had.... if I ever get to use the thing! Mine has the horrendous fishy smell other commenters have mentioned. It's disgusting. I ordered this bag specifically to use at a job interview- the bag came (as scheduled and expected) the day before. I pulled off the plastic and immediately gagged! I hung the bag up to air out AND sprayed it with fabric refresher. That didn't help at all. So, I didn't get to use the bag for its intended purpose, and as of now (nearly a week later) it STILL stinks like fish. I have it hanging outside to hopefully properly air out, and if it doesn't I think I'll have to just toss it."
2.0,"I love the looks, but he bra gives very little support. It would be much better if the straps were adjustable . They are too long"
2.0,"No es buena calidad, se rompió muy rápido"
2.0,"Vastly disappointed in the stone selection as this ""Indian agate"", which normally have predominately green color schemes, looks like a polished turd.<br />""Each crystal quartz pendant is natural that the color is slightly different from pictures"" is a massive understatement. There's not a speck of any color other than brown and hints of white on this thing<br />The cordage and way they tie around the rock seems to be okay but time would tell<br />wouldn't recommend this crystal choice, but it's amazon so are you surprised"
2.0,I got the medium &#34;sand&#34; color and I wasnt satisfied. It didnt look like the picture it was bright color.<br />And the medium is too big. I tried to get a refund but I had to pay $9 to ship it back.
2.0,Don’t waist your money. Not worth 5 bucks.
2.0,"Cheap material and very small for a medium. I'm 5'7"" and 140lbs. I wear a loose medium but this was TIGHT!  Itchy and does not was well. I do not recommend."
2.0,"Product seems ok - decent material and thickness, but I received the wrong style, twice.  I returned it and asked for the correct style after the first one, only to receive the same incorrect style again.  I wanted Abstract Geometry, but received the Argyle Flower both times - so beware if you're trying to order that one.  I just returned for a refund the second time because I wanted it for a ski trip and didn't have time to order again (or much faith that I'd get the product I ordered)."
2.0,"1 star for expedited delivery, came in 3 weeks earlier and 1 star for really nice quality sewing. Great color, nice fabric but... I ordered an XL to ensure a nice fit... WRONG... based on the measurements provided by the vendor the jumper should have fit someone with a 39&#34; bust and 33&#34; waist, well, I wear a 36 C bra and have a 29 inch waist but you know what... I could not even get the jumper up past my thighs!!!  If you have a very slender build this jumper would fit very nicely (remember... I ordered an XL).  Let's see what happens with I try to return this!<br /><br />Update regarding return process: I knew that I may have to end up keeping the jumper and just have a % of the full price reimbursed... and that is exactly what happened. They offered a 30% refund and I said I would feel better with a 50% refund and they said OK :-)"
2.0,"I ordered the ""earth brown digi camo"" gaiters and received the ""sky blue digi camo"". The label says earth brown digi but obviously the colors are wrong. I am disappointed with this, but the quality of the product seems to be good."
2.0,"This product has a lot of promise, but its design has a flaw that will increase the likelihood it will break early.  While it’s nice to have the slope side, the other three corners are pointed.  If something drops on one or if dropped event from a foot off the ground, the pressure from the impact will cause a small hole at that point."
2.0,"Both items were too small. I’m 5’8, 145 lbs, my hand are not large, and my shoe size is an 8 1/2. The quality is ok, but I would not recommend this product."
2.0,I use it for my bangles an to just play around with with my niece. They cook for her she’s 9
2.0,I really wanted to love these pants and maybe its just my body type.. I have long legs and a shorter torso.. when I put these on they were super comfy but not cute at all. The material at my crotch was all buched up but the pants were very tight around my booty which looked awkward and if I pulled them up so there was not so much extra material in the crotch the pants were way too high and not flattering.
2.0,Arrived dented and would not close.  After reading reviews I was crushed.  Decided just wasted money and now have to decide where to get something that will work for my dad<br />This was gonna be to put my moms picture in. She passed away Nov 7
2.0,Beautiful to look at but way too large for my small ears. The concept was great but the fitting was just off for my ears they sort of just hang there.
2.0,Came on time but was missing a diamond so had to return :( very pretty and great quality though.
2.0,It was kind of thin and neck told small.
2.0,Horrible rip off. They are advertised As 100% cotton... Not. Amazon should address this.
2.0,"The watch looked nice (not as nice as the picture), but when i went to take it out of the case, the buckle fell apart.  Luckily my husband was able to piece it back together. A little disappointed."
2.0,The bra is definitely sticky enough but it didn’t work for me. I have size c mom boobs. Didn’t provide any lift or support. Boobs were still just as saggy and shapeless.
2.0,Pretty dress design but horrible quality. The dresses for my daughters only last 2 weeks! They ripped and the flowers disappeared giving a result of a poor quality dress. They were to the trash. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Super cheap looking and itchy fabric. The fit was fine though and was a cute cut, it’s too bad they used such a bad synthetic material."
2.0,"I ordered this necklace and requested the name Katie for my daughter. Instead I received the name Lauren. The necklace is quite lovely, dainty chain with the word Lauren in cursive. I'm very disappointed as I was looking forward to giving this to my daughter."
2.0,"The crochet is see through everywhere, up the leg and top. Not what I was looking for."
2.0,The speakers are not loud needs to be more noise canceling type
2.0,This shirt was smaller than size indicated.
2.0,"This is a nice watch, decent size and looks good, but, the light function didn’t work on mine, I didn’t care about that too much, but the band, is a cheap material it lasted about a month, maybe month and half. You cannot expect a great watch for this price."
2.0,This dress doesn't look quite like what the picture advertises.  The sizing is small and the waist is much higher than the picture leads you to believe.  The dress seemed to be made a good quality.
2.0,"I had been wanting this wallet for a long time. But the ID windows came stained with ink and the plastic is opaque and not clear and see-through, which sort of defeats the purpose of having ID windows. The rest of the wallet looks great, but I'll have to return it because not being able to use the ID windows makes it not functional"
2.0,"The product shrunk upon my first washing.<br />Also, the top continually unbuttons.  This is<br />an upsetting aspect of this purchase."
2.0,Shorts were approximately 2 sizes smaller than advertised as actual fit.
2.0,"The look great, light and somewhat comfortable to wear. However not sure if it was just this pair or all have the same defect that water still gets through. It was clear at first then the anti fog was gone with in days."
2.0,"The bag itself is cute and classy, however IT IS NOT TRUE TO SIZE LISTED.<br />I ordered the small size. Looking at the product description,  the small is 38cm (14.9 inches) long, 13cm wide and 26cm high.  Normally, handbags are measured by the base panel to publish the length and with, however the base panel of this bag measures only 30cm long and 11cm wide.  I expected a variance of maybe 2-3cm for manufacturing differences, but 8cm? That's over a 3 inch difference than the listed size!  Due to this, a bag that should have been able to hold my 13in (33cm) Macbook Pro is too small.  I have reordered in the larger size since its a nice, economically priced bag for me to use in the office, but be aware of the huge variance before selecting a size!<br /><br />Bag measurements taken from description:<br />Big size: 48cm(L)*15cm(W)*30cm(H). Small size:38cm(L)*13cm(W)*26cm(H)"
2.0,"Umbrella does a good job blocking the sun, and I love the color.  Other aspects are frustrating--broken snap so cannot bind umbrella tightly; takes 2 or 3, sometimes more attempts to click the umbrella to stay open.  Returning the item."
2.0,Don’t understand why it didn’t just come in the size I ordered. Had to cut and punch hole. Screw that goes on backside where it attaches buckle started Corroding  quickly.
2.0,A little too diamond-y for me.  I should have looked at the picture closer.
2.0,There was a piece missing on the lens but other than that they will work
2.0,Did not like....quality of elastic used very poor.
2.0,"I can't seem to get this manufacturer sizes correct.  Some are small, some a huge (the one size)  I purchased this directly from the seller and paid additional expedited fees and it was 5 days late.  They reached out to me, but did not refund the expedited shipping cost as you would expect.  It will cost too much to send back - it does not fit anything like the picture.  I'm not sure what I will do with this, the arms and back are to snug to give to a larger person. Oh well live and learn, this vendor is not for me sadly.<br />Update - The vendor said they would pay shipping cost"
2.0,"I love this bag. I have another one in blue from a different retailer so I ordered this one. Within a few weeks of using it, one of the bolts holding the smaller handle broke and was lost. I am so disappointed."
2.0,"I received a 34X30 pair of jeans.  Since you only could order by waist size, beware the lenth may be wrong.<br />Other than that they are a nice pair of casual jeans."
2.0,Look nice but very bad quality. I wear a small size but I ordered medium. It fits well.
2.0,"The small hand on the watch gets stuck , when trying to adjust the time. Which was a problem I had with the watch. So, I returned it back to the company."
2.0,"This dress fits so oddly in the chest/arms. The chest is so loose I haven’t been able to wear the dress yet. The waist and length are correct for the dress, but wow! Unless you are incredibly well endowed up top, this dress will leave you needing a tailor. Sad, because the fabric is vibrant, beautiful and not sheer which is what I wanted. It just doesn’t fit."
2.0,"The blouse on the pic advertised looks loose fitting and the length in back a little long. I got an XL , cause I wanted that look as well, but was disappointed. The XL fit more like a medium.  I gave it 2 stars, cause I like the print on the blouse, but it's going back, cause it runs too small (not true to size)"
2.0,"ORDER 3 SIZES LARGER, MAYBE FOUR!!<br /><br />Really like the light weight material and the color for visibility as I walk in the mornings when it is still dark.  This runs supper small.<br />I ordered a 2XL, fits like a medium/large, while I wear an XL.  Sleeve length is perfect.<br /><br />Two stars because of small size causing me to have to return."
2.0,"Received it just in time for an out-of-country trip, however it came with a hole in the seams."
2.0,I like that these earrings came with traditional butterfly backs and plastic backs. What i don't like is the pictures show the post near one end of the bar and also pictures with the post centered on the bar. The earrings I received the post is not centered but is near one end making them want to dangle and not be sideways like shown. Also I can't make them tight enough (without hurting) to make them sit on my ears and not dangle. I think if the post was centered on the bar they would sit nicely on the ear. Not what I was expecting.
2.0,The item was way to small
2.0,"Kids love the shoes, but the quality leaves a lot to be desired. The pull tab on the Velcro strap has already come loose after less than 2 weeks of wear."
2.0,Great quality but runs extremely small.<br />Purchased for my 4 year old daughter and had to return and reorder a size 7-8 girls.<br />My daughter wears size 5T or XS/S GIRLS in USA standard sizes.  Luckily returns were easy and free and ordered in time to make an exchange.
2.0,"I saw a lot of good review for this skirt, but when I received it, I could not get it to zip up. It took 2 people (my boyfriend and myself) to get it zipped up, I literally had to lie down on my bed and pull as he held my skirt. Then once I had it on, I couldn't get it off. It was hilarious and frustrating all at the same time. I loved the skirt too, the pattern was beautiful and the material was very sturdy and soft. Maybe I'll buy this again one day in hopes of a better zipper, but today is not that day."
2.0,"I am a person of average height, 5'6&quot;.  These house do not make it up to my knee.  they need to be 2 1/2 to 3 inches longer.  however, they do have good support and are lightweight.  I will have to return these."
2.0,"Not great quality t shirt material, stiff"
2.0,"No side pocket, sleeves too long. very disappointed. A Birthday gift for someone 0verseas. Inconvenient to return, recipient will make the necessary alteration."
2.0,Super short.
2.0,"Doesn't do much for night driving. Doesn't seem to make things brighter or reduce glare at night. Works well on a cloudy day and they look nice, but if you want them for night driving, don't waste your money."
2.0,"This is for kids and it's huge, and uncomfortable.  This watch has no sim card slot either if you want your kid to be able to call you then obviously this isn't it for your kid.  I'm rating it low due to battery life, overly large size, and the screen quality is really bad."
2.0,So ugly. The buttons are flashy and too much. The shape is no my flattering at all. Immediately returned.
2.0,The tutee would barely fit a one-year-old the 40 will barely fit a two-year-old runs very tiny
2.0,Comfortable but does not ware well.  I wear it in the house.
2.0,I ordered a small and it was way too big. The syle was the same as the photo but did not fit the body the same in the hip area. It fit like a large.
2.0,Cool hat. Awesome quality. But is a child size. Not adult size as advertised. Very disappointed in that.
2.0,"Weird synthetic material that would not work in the southern US.  I always by a large, but it seemed a bit tent-like and fit odd."
2.0,You can tell it was made in a factory.. Looks like it was poorly put together.. Has a nasty smell to it.. The lettering was pretty clear.. The necklace piece of it was way too long.. The picture looked so much better.. It looks cheat so I suggest if that's what your looking for than but it
2.0,"Color was not at all like expected. I refuse to wear this dress. It's thin and poorly crafted but fit as expected. I should have paid more attention to the reviews. If you're looking for a purple dress, look elsewhere."
2.0,The dress is beautiful on screen and in person. Within an hour the bottom of the dress continued to snag on the shoes recommended. This caused the dress to rip at both the bottom and mid waist at seam. It looked horrible during wear of an hour. The outer layer of the dress is a mesh material which was very easy to tear. I would not recommend this dress for a child. 2 Stars
2.0,Thin and no tags.  Appeared to be worn already.
2.0,They are not as good as I expected. Looks cheaper and not as real as it looks on picture.
2.0,"this product turned my wifes wrist green in like a month. Do not buy if you ever get wet, sweat or are human"
2.0,son muy abrasivas en la nariz
2.0,I had to send this back because it was way too small.
2.0,Pretty but runs small. The extra large fit like a medium. I'm returnin it.
2.0,"Doesn’t fit like it should.  Also, there is a flap of material that tucks into the bodice of the dress that constantly comes untucked and looks silly. Doesn’t look like ut should. The green color is beautiful."
2.0,"Way to small, order 3xl. Gave them to my Son that wears large. I gave then 2 star only because they are made from what seemed to be quality materials."
2.0,"It's cute and comfortable but it started fading right after the first wash, especially the panda on the t-shirt. Also, fuzzballs started appearing after 2-3 washes. Won't buy again!"
2.0,"It literally says ""sweatsuit"" so I thought it was SWEATS. The fabric is weird, kinda like leggings material, but it's soft af. The ""tie dye"" looks off in person. The pant waist is TOO LONG and I literally have to pull it up to my bra or it looks like I'm wearing a diaper. Don't do it."
2.0,"Cute, but cheap. Ear piece pulled off when just gently putting them on the second time."
2.0,Hard to open/expand=breaks easily. Glued end on 1 and it's holding so far...
2.0,It was too much of a gap at the bust and felt like it was going to fall down. Cute fabric though
2.0,"the shirt quality is fine not great but good enough. The print seems that is should hold up, after a few washes, I'll edit this comment if that changes.<br />The problem is that is runs very small, I bought a 2xl and it feel about slightly smaller than a large.<br />Still a nice shirt, just be aware of this."
2.0,"Fits ok !! Concerned about the side not having a strap ,, it easily falls !!"
2.0,"Zipper broke on first try-on, and based on the size chart, I was not in the wrong size. I would have just returned it but my package with this item was claimed to be lost and I was refunded long before the item magically appeared on my doorstep."
2.0,Bought these for my 11 year old who is under five feet and maybe 100 pounds and the medium is way too small will be contacting the seller for an exchange.
2.0,It had some weird yellow stains that when I washed the outfit got even more yellow. Not seen very well. Shrinks when washed.
2.0,"Looks so classy, much better in person. Problem is they quit working after 6months. Very disappointed ☹️"
2.0,"This item was defective, the strap was sown together twisted."
2.0,"The dress feels too expensive for what it turned out to be. Its baggy, sheer, and is a bit awkward. It also comes with a long tie-around ribbon but the dress doesn't come with the holes for the ribbon the go through. Weird dress."
2.0,"I ordered a pair of these. They are beautiful but one earring came disattached from its hook. I contacted amazon for a replacement. They sent one and that too came broken. Otherwise, they are gorgeous."
2.0,Looks nice on. Although it looks nice it feels like poor quality
2.0,Cute shirt but scratches your arm
2.0,"I recently started bike riding and I bike about 20 miles a day. During these bike rides, I often feel pain from my saddle and I wanted to rectify the situation by purchasing leggings with a chamois built-in. I thought the skirt was a nice added touch because then I wouldn't have to worry about showing any panty lines (assuming the skirt would cover them up.)<br /><br />The material of these leggings is very cheap. I expected it to be cheap, but it's so cheap that I expect that it is going to rip after one or two washes. Definitely not worth $28 for that reason alone. (Also, the skirt does NOT hide panty line...that's how thin and cheap it is. Now I can only wear it if I have a long shirt on top. See photos.)<br /><br />As for the comfort factor, I did not find the chamois to be very comfortable. It's there...it just didn't seem to reduce enough pressure. I still felt plenty of pain.<br /><br />Overall, I regret buying these leggings. I do not think they are worth $28...maybe $8, since they will likely only last a couple of washes. I have already worn them while cycling, so I don't think it would be right for me to return them, but I will definitely not be buying them again and do not recommend to others. I am giving them a 2 star instead of 1 star because it technically comes with everything that was promised, it just doesn't work well.<br /><br />If you still want to buy them for some reason and are curious about the sizing, I am 5'6"" and 220lb and I bought a size XXL. It seemed about right for my height and weight."
2.0,"Good size, wrong color it is not MARPAT."
2.0,"Purchased new 7 months ago. Light walking on a polished concrete floor which can be seen in the background.<br /><br />I read the reviews before purchase and decided to purchase based on the favorable reviews.<br /><br />I'm not sure what happened with mine. A Monday boot? Because these things are literally falling apart after 7 months. 2 days ago, I noticed the leather heel separated from the upper on the right boot. Today I noticed the same thing on the left.<br /><br />I liked these boots when I got them. They looked good, felt good out of the box and the price was good. But I'm in a situation now where I have to find a new pair of boots in the next few days because these are falling apart so quickly.<br /><br />These boots were not mistreated, or dipped in acid. They were polished to a high shine and taken care of like my old garrisons - which lasted for 6-8 years in a heavy duty machine shop. While I wasn't expecting these to go that distance, I didn't expect them to wear out so quickly, especially since they were worn very lightly."
2.0,"I returned item.  It fit fine, but the pockets at the waistline added too much bulk just where I didn't need it!"
2.0,really cute. Bought for wearing with my combat boots but sadly zero stretch ie they don’t fit all the way up so sad really wanted to like these I don’t think a large would work either. If you have any but at all they probably won’t fit. great for someone long and lean.
2.0,The material is stiff and uncomfortable. Not what you need from a painting smock.
2.0,seems cheap and scratches very easily
2.0,"Cute denim ballet style slip-on flats. I wear a 7 1/2 in shoes, and these are an 8. The fit is perfect so these run small. There’s no sole support and you can feel the hardness of the ground through the shoe. Rubberized bottom. The heel backing is very stiff, hard, and tight against the back of the heel. I tried to break it in with pressure of my hand, but the material wouldn’t give. When walking, it pulls on the Achilles’ tendon and that nerve that runs on the back of your heel. After test walking for a few minutes, my feet and heels were hurting. If you’re used to wearing a hard backed pump, you probably won’t find any issues with these. Those days are gone for me, so these aren’t comfortable on me."
2.0,The belt is not a quality belt. The sizes also run really small.  I would get the next size up from what you normally get.
2.0,"If you thought you'd be able to buy a full grain leather watchband for about $25, you're wrong.<br />This watchband is not full grain leather. It is cheap bonded painted stuff.<br />I was suspicious about the low price but took a chance on it because I was just curious what my watch would look like with a leather band.  Learn from my experience: If full grain leather is important to you, pay the premium price elsewhere because what you're buying here is not it."
2.0,A cheaper quality item than I thought it would be...but it's ok for casual wear.
2.0,Great shoes but they were to small.
2.0,"Not a fan of the material, and the coloring is not quite what it looks like in the picture. Definitely not my style. Disappointed."
2.0,luego de unas pocas puestas se estiraron muchisimo y se han vuelto muy incomodos
2.0,Doesn’t stretch at all so wired
2.0,This pajama set runs very small. I am unable to wear it.
2.0,"Fit, but very bad quality"
2.0,"This was supposed to be a 3x, it’s more like a 3 extra small. My skinny friends can’t even fit this!"
2.0,"This looked super cute online but in reality, the pockets were a disaster. I have other short dresses with pockets and I think it's just the way this one is constructed. They stick out and are very noticeable. Not what a curvy woman wants to have happening around her waist/hip area... it immediately went back."
2.0,"If you are looking for a pair of lightweight, stylish sunglasses then look no further.  But if you also need the optical clarity that glass lenses provide (and as advertised in the description), then keep shopping, Though they look better than the sunglasses found at your local drugstore, the plastic lenses have the same quality as the drugstore offerings.  Very disappointing..."
2.0,it broke after a few uses
2.0,It turned my ears green :(
2.0,Won't stay closed
2.0,"Good quality and fit!<br />Update:  I gave it 5 stars after trying them on and they felt great, but once I got a chance to actually use them this socks failed.  they would not stay up!  keeps sliding of my heels.  SUPER ANNOYING!  I'm keeping 2 stars since they are soft and I liked the colors.  But they could benefit from a small silicone strip on the heel or they are useless."
2.0,The fabric sucks and they were super baggy.
2.0,"Beautiful, the stones over time lost a lot of their clarity. Attempted to clean and no change."
2.0,Cheap fabric and faded colors.  Didn't like the matching tankini top especially.
2.0,"Not what I expected,  but when I compare picture to product it's right on. Look carefully before ordering!!!!"
2.0,A lot bigger than I expected and the material is thin.
2.0,Nice patterns.
2.0,"This is like wearing polyester pants only in shirt form. Although pretty design, it is not warm and is way too staticky."
2.0,It was like a choker necklace. Too small for me
2.0,"I really wanted this blouse to be awesome. Even when I touched the fabric and thought how cheap it felt, I still was going to give it a try on.  But the blouse just didn't hang in flattering way.  They color is gorgeous but the fabric is a deal breaker."
2.0,"The black opened up just fine, the gold and silver  not so much. I did get the silver in my nose BUT it was horrible to get out. I thought I had to cut it off. I ended up sticking scissors in-between the inside of the ring and opening them up so it would stretch the ring out."
2.0,"The arms on this are way to small for my daughter, who still fits in some 4T clothes"
2.0,"First, let me start off by letting you know that I am part of the Amazon Vine Program so Amazon did send this product out to me for review. The Milacolato are very small, kind of a turn off for me but they are a cute. The chain on the earring are thin which is make feel like you have to be super careful not to break it. The stone don't have a really good shine, maybe it's the cut. I feel like these earrings would be more for a little child instead of an adult. The earrings are very light and comfy to wear. Overall very small but nice for a child."
2.0,Feel flimsy
2.0,It didn’t fit as expected! It was too small with minimal stretch.
2.0,way too short I need to use a legging but it's cute enougth
2.0,WAY too small. Got the Medium-busty for my sister who is a size 34G/34DDDD and she could barely get it on.
2.0,The material is not good.
2.0,"Very cute but broke the only night I wore it, within an hour."
2.0,They are very hard to put on!
2.0,I washed them prior to wearing them and they're still itchy. So I returned them.
2.0,"So I'm about 5'6"" and 128lbs. I ordered the black romper in a size large. Its definitely not very baggy...fits as expected I guess. I could've used an xl. I would order another but I would not be able to wear it more than an hour at a time. The material is super itchy and scratchy and I'm not usually sensitive to stuff so the idea is cute, the execution falls short."
2.0,"I normally wear an XL but this was way too small for me.  It's cut very small in the arms and not much room in the bust area. Cute dress but sadly, had  to return it."
2.0,"These are sturdy and well made, but the six prongs add a lot of metal and take away from the gemstone. That may be the way the heart shape has to be set to make it secure, but I dodn't like it. In addition, the prongs are long which makes the gemstone sit high and away from your ear and they stick out from the earlobe."
2.0,Came apart after a few weeks
2.0,"The letters started falling off after a single wash. The stitches are for show, and the letters are only glued on.  Do not buy if you plan on wearing or washing."
2.0,"The photo of the dress looks really cute, but in person it looks very cheap.  There were multiple strings hanging from the dress, and the ruffling just didn't look good.  The neckline was rather loose (the gathering), but as I've found on Amazon with clothes...consistency is not as it is in a department store, so you may get a dress that is made better than I did."
2.0,the fabric is so thin and it rides up my legs as I walk to embarrassing heights. Fabric is just cheap it wasn’t worth the money.
2.0,"Pretty, but waaaaayyy smaller than I expected"
2.0,The material seemed cheap so I returned them.
2.0,Runs 2X small
2.0,The pads shift about in bra top.
2.0,"The fabric on this was nice and soft, with a little stretch. Unfortunately, it was way to small and tight through the mid section and I am returning it."
2.0,"Way too small, more for small woman or teen.  Looks like someone made it themselves at home.  :-("
2.0,Item runs small cute doe... looks kinda cheap as well.
2.0,"the puffy Sleeves are too wrinkled, don’t think I can iron them after washing it. Don’t like it"
2.0,Beautiful but defective
2.0,"Fits bigger than size. Based on their size chart, I ordered M and it was way too big around arm."
2.0,"I'm on the fence about this item. I ordered XXL based on the size chart but received a large. I'm a size 8/10. The quality is good and it's a modest ish swimsuit (obviously modesty is defined differently for everybody). I hate the cups. I'm a d cup and these just don't work for me. But I can just remove the cups and replace them if I want to. The shorts that came with it weren't really made well in the crotch area. It was made like a regular boyshort style no flat crotch was made. I hope that made sense. So the seams would be very irritating rubbing against sensitive skin. The seam is right in the middle of the crotch area. Over all for the price it's a decent swimsuit. You can see the pictures and decide for yourself. I'm 5'5&#34;, 150lbs, and size 8/10. It hits me mid thigh."
2.0,Too see-through for my taste. Almost no ankle hole
2.0,"I purchased these boots for walking my dog in NY state. I've had them a few weeks and although they seemed OK at first, they are now leaking to the point my feet are soaked. They are cute and comfortable, and would be OK to wear during dry weather, but I'll need to purchase other boots for snowy/slushie/rainy conditions."
2.0,They were really cute and I got compliments on them..but they started to fall apart the first time I wore them.
2.0,"It’s a nice looking belt, so +1 star.  I ordered for my waist size, but it was too small for me to use initially.  I lost some weight, so after a couple months of it collecting dust, I was able to use it.  Yay, me.  However after only about 4 months of fairly regular use, the belt broke at the buckle.  My previous belt still works after 10+ years of frequent use.  I’d not recommend this belt"
2.0,The chain wouldn't stay in the right place on the t.
2.0,"The size chart in the description was off as I went with a larger size based off that & it was way too big. Misleading details in description & pics as the one I received did not have pockets.<br />I do, however, like the material as it’s lightweight & flowy. I’ll return it & give it another go. Hoping for a better fit & pockets."
2.0,I don’t like ironing.
2.0,Extra large fits much smaller than typical extra large shirts .. size accordingly
2.0,"It does look cool in photos, but then I put it on and discovered it to be just plain weird."
2.0,Would be nice if it was more slim fit and more like the picture also I had to pay to send it back what a joke
2.0,Made  a big mistake on this one.  I vcannot  hardly see the face of the watch much less  the time.  NO  lite  on it
2.0,"I like the product, but it was ripped the back of it.."
2.0,"My selection was a long-shot at best...as I had an old Oakley frame for which this product was not actually designed.  So, I shaved a bit off and used some glue and have a somewhat workable pair of sunglasses now."
2.0,Tag was on the outside of the shirt
2.0,They fit kinda weird
2.0,"I did not like the material, it wasn’t soft to the touch, fabric looked cracked. Maybe after washing with fabric softener it will be better? I don’t know… I ended up returning it so can’t comment about absorbency or durability either."
2.0,To small not sized correctly
2.0,"It’s probably a nice shirt, but it runs really really small"
2.0,"(not as pictured! The one that the model is wearing is different from the one I received. Mine looked like the photos of just the cover-up, which has narrow sleeves and rounded lace accents, not v shaped accents)<br /><br />Pretty cute, but lace was not hemed (finished) on sleeves So They will probably fray out eventually. Arms are very tapered. Ended up giving it to a friend who wears a small and is 5'2&#34;, and the arms were a bit narrow on her too. Dolman type sleeves not flowy sleeves."
2.0,"After washing with other dark clothes and placing in dryer as usual, they came out smaller than my other ankle socks.  I realize they are wool but they were also a blend.  I have 100% wood boot socks but these did not perform in a similar fashion.  I will look to cotton blend from now on."
2.0,"The picture shows this as a nice thick rain jacket, it isn’t. It is a thin see through material. Luckily we mainly bought this for a Halloween costume but were expecting to have a durable rain jacket to use for the rest of the year. We will see how long this lasts with a 10 year old wearing it. I’m not expecting much out of it."
2.0,"Way lo small, super hallow. Way to pricy for such small chain."
2.0,I ordered my usual size 8. Left fit fine but right 1 slips in back felt more like an 81/2. Have to send back. They look nice good quality
2.0,Very pretty but turned my wrist green
2.0,Very cute but tangles easily and the chains kept coming apart. I did ally tossed it.
2.0,"It was very cute, but it fell apart in my washing machine after the second wash. The first wash was to get rid of the &#34;new hat&#34; smell and the second was to git rid of the dog slobber from my dog trying to play with it. I agree yes my dog could have loosened the fabric but I still don't think half of the fur on the face should have come out when I washed it!<br /><br />On a positive note the product did have paw pads.<br /><br />All in all if you don't wash it or let your dog get a hold of it it should hold up fine and of course be cute, but I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone wanting a durable hat."
2.0,"The coat is too big, and the zipper is terrible, it sticks and is sharp to the touch. Its warm that's all I can say about it."
2.0,There was some loose strings as if it was a rushed job and the fitting wasn't accurate as listed. I won't be buying from this seller ever again and will be returning it.
2.0,They were soft I guess? That's the best thing I can say about them. You can finns original quality ones for about $20-$30 each if you look hard enough.
2.0,Very cheap clasp material
2.0,"Runs small and material is very thin! My son wore it once and it already ripped in the crotch area!!! I'd send it back, but my son really wants to wear it for Halloween and there's not enough time to get something else. I just sewed it up, but buyer beware!"
2.0,"I thought this would be a comfortable fit, but it’s not! Not a stretchy material. If you’re curvy, an XL will NOT fit you!!! I thought an XL would actually fit me loose. I’m normally a size medium/large."
2.0,"I got one of these for my soon-to-be mother in law and the “mother of the bride” for my mom. The quality and presentation of these necklaces are pretty poor. One was so tangled and I was scared I was going to break it trying to untangle it bc it is so thin. This is what I would expect for $10, not $40. Honestly, I bought these bc of the cute sayings but I can’t get past the quality to actually give these to my mom and MIL."
2.0,"These glass look and feel ok, But you can't use them because their is way to much glare on them. Save you money for a better pair."
2.0,"Nice material and they are very comfortable. The reason for the low rating is because they are way too short.  I am 5' 5"" and they only come to my ankles.  I returned them which is a shame because I did like the fit and feel of the pant."
2.0,"Great fit.  The stitches along the pouch started to unravel just after one wash. Great fit, but awful product."
2.0,"These earrings are pretty cute, and they look exactly how I expected. However, the posts came bent, which is often a problem with pure silver because it’s so soft. But still, it would be nice if my new product looked new.<br /><br />These also bothered ears, which isn’t normally a problem with silver and gold. I will say that my piercings are still pretty new, only a couple months old, and maybe it was squishing them all day with the supportive backs and having something so heavy dangling off of them when they’re technically not fully healed wasn’t very good for them. I’ll have to try them again in a few more months to see if it’s any better, but for now, I’m not very happy with them."
2.0,"These fit my face oddly--they were tilted forward on my face, like I would have needed lower ears to make them sit flat on my face. Didn't like them at all and returned them."
2.0,Sizing was weird. Shoulders fit well but bottom was narrow. Bunched up over breezers.
2.0,"For its intended purpose, not enough room elastic too short.Cuts your circulation off."
2.0,"The zipper came split, but easily resolved after closing and opening 2x. The bag is cute, but I fear after a few uses it would fall apart at the seams. It doesn't feel sturdy.<br />Also, the bag has narrow openings. Its deep enough, but if you need to get anything large into or out if it, it's going to tear the zipper, or stitching. If you have light stuff, it may work, but not functional for me."
2.0,Material really looks cheap
2.0,"It’s too small😭😭😭 I’m so sad. They don’t stretch much, and I somehow managed to button them, but barely. They aren’t really high rise, it only came up to my belly button."
2.0,"I ordered a size S and received a size S, but the shirt was bigger than a XL. I'm 5'10"", 160 lb. Most of my golf apparel are S or M as I prefer a good fit (not a tight fit). When I put on this golf shirt, I looked like a grade school kid wearing his dad's clothes. It's ridiculous. I've had shirts that were one size larger, but never anything like this. Was this shirt made for the land of the giants?"
2.0,"Fit was fine, but very poorly made. The hat material where it is sewn into the flexfit band is all bunched up and wrinkly, even when wearing it. Does not seem like a genuine FlexFit hat, at least like none of the 10 others i’ve owned. Returning and buying direct from Nixon."
2.0,Super cute. HOWEVER- it broke me out within 7 hours of wearing.  I can see the chain and unicorn emblem on my neck.  I bought it to match my daughter but obviously I can’t wear it. Super bummed. It was a much angrier red about an hour ago. Glad it’s fading quickly.
2.0,Was so excited to be purchasing new Groucho glasses for a birthday party. And then sooooo disappointed that they fit like children's glasses. The side arms are so short they did NOT make it to the ear...
2.0,Not impressed when I received it I had a hard time fitting it around my ear.  Still does not fit right when manipulating it.  Do not waste your money.
2.0,"Definitely size up. If you want it to be flowy, double size up. It also arrived late and it does not come with a pre-paid return label."
2.0,"You get what you pay for. Very cheaply made, the inside doesnt hold cards they all slide all the way thru, I thought someone stole my CC but it slipped down behind license."
2.0,The quality is very cheap. It's like t-shirt material made into a dress. It's also see through. Thankfully I had purchased a back up dress at Target that was less money and much better quality.
2.0,"Loved the glasses, but after minimal wear one of the screws that held them together fell out :("
2.0,Felt cheap. Didn't like it. The band that comes from Apple was much better
2.0,"I’m giving it 2 stars only cause the latex material makes it feel more comfortable. Other than that I was not at all pleased. The eyebrows and mustache look like they were hand painted and you can see the imperfections; for someone picky like myself that was a problem. Also the eyes are ridiculously small (I added and image with a dime next to it so y’all can get an idea) You can barely get a clear view. And tbh this was one of the higher priced masks and I personally don’t think it’s worth the money . I actually bought a second one (different vendor) for cheaper which was the one I ended up using. Which  reminds me: they do not return/exchange so be careful. After seeing that the item didn’t satisfy my needs, I tried to start a return & they won’t let me. I would think twice."
2.0,Most of the pictures on some of the rings are distorted or too dark to see what it is.
2.0,"This is the second one I need to return, generous sizes.  My husband usually wears large in a sweat shirt, but even the medium is too big, especially the sleeves, they are very long."
2.0,I was so excited about these earrings. When I got them they were way heavy and uncomfortable. They also had a stone off and in the bottom of the box. I returned them.
2.0,"Ordered this dress for work, but it's way too short! The mesasurements were totally off!"
2.0,"Pretty, but the material is so thin. I'm afraid it is going to rip too easily."
2.0,Very tight fitting not for big bust ladies also catches too much lint i will have to return it as i don’t feel comfortable with this much tightness. I’m usually a size small but even with a medium i believe it is too tight (small pictured)
2.0,"The bag is super cute and spacious; however, when I got it, it smelled so bad. No matter what I did the smell wouldn't go away. I tried sprays, laundry sheets, smelly sachets...nothing!"
2.0,The material is awful and it’s runs small.
2.0,"The patches are different and do not say ""ride or die"" but have a large pair of scissors on them that says ""fresh cut""<br />The print on the back is kind of cheap looking and definitely not a shirt worth $45. Also when they say ""relaxed fit"" they mean it."
2.0,My regular inexpensive reading glasses (+1.50) are currently unavailable so I purchased these...........<br />End result:<br />- blurry vision<br />- weak magnification (closer to +1.00?)<br />- tossed into the trash.<br />Truly a waste of money
2.0,Glasses were amazing but broke after 3rd wear. Pretty disappointed
2.0,"They are lovely but small, I gave them to my 12 year old grand daughter, she loves them"
2.0,Runs small had to order 2 sizes up
2.0,"I wish this ring could be resized. The website did not establish what size it was, its too small for my finger. but its cute, which sucks."
2.0,I bought this for my wife and she hates it. She said that the material is cheap and the pictures posted of it on Amazon are misleading.
2.0,Stone was beautiful but cord was cheap and itchy.
2.0,"While assembly was fairly easy, there were multiple issues. The two top nobs had been broken off and still obviously placed inside the box together. It wad obvious that they were broken as they both had jagged plastic on the bottom and you could see the other half of the plastic in the corresponding holes. Next, 2 holes had to be drilled myself as the holes it came with were off so far i couldn't make them work. Next, the slotted pink shelves on the upper unit, the whole thing was drilled so off square it really strands out how crooked out looks. Lastly, the pink little box that goes on the back wall wad totally split at the seems and i had to use superglue and a clamp to make it work.<br /><br />This assembly was much more difficult than it should have been and the QC process obviously failed on my box. If it wasn't Christmas weekend when i put this together for my kid, the day before Christmas eve in fact, I'd return this for another. I had to MacGyver this thing together at enough places that i can't recommend it for most folks, not everyone could do it."
2.0,"Hard to get off, trying several types of socks since my doctor is concerned about my varicose veins. My legs are not big. I bought large sized stockings."
2.0,Plastic button broke when I was tightening screws. Tossed it in trash
2.0,I loved the mounting but the center stone was just too big. It is also an 18&#34; chain which it was suppose to be but you called it a 16&#34; when you ask for my review.  This is for the 925 Sterling Silver 3A Round Cubic Zirconia Pendent.
2.0,"I bought 2 pairs of pajamas for my grandsons, one 24 month and the other 3T.  Both pair would probably fit my boys, but they are very small.  The problem is that, unfortunately, the pajamas are meant to fit very snug as in thermal underwear.  That's not what I expected when I purchased them and so I am going to return them and buy some different kinds."
2.0,"I seldom give 2 stars for the product I received. Honestly, I love all the details of the cat. It is cute. However, it is sad when you received the box that is already opened by someone. And they have a label said that it’s a new item which makes me feel deceived."
2.0,Honestly doesn’t fit better than other tees. I followed the instructions to measure and honestly not impressed for a $25 shirt. The material is soft though
2.0,"I really wanted to love this dress - it's such a cute color and cut. The problem is, it's totally see through and the fabric quality in general is very subpar. I'm going to keep it but I doubt I'll ever wear it as a dress, probably just a tunic with leggings."
2.0,"Looks like the picture, different material as expected but runs small had to return it because of the fit"
2.0,don't really like this piece. Looks really cheap in person.  I did not pay very much for it but just don't like it.  Would have returned it if it had cost more.  I'm just going to donate it.
2.0,The material s very uncomfortable.
2.0,They are way too big from my nose
2.0,"These pants fit well and were comfortable on my son, but only wore them a few times before they ripped at the seam in the back."
2.0,The fabric & color are fantastic. If it were only a little too roomie I would have kept it. But it was ENORMOUS! Very huge. I returned it.
2.0,Flexible band 3 weeks in and it color peeling.
2.0,"I bought this dress two times in 2017 (two years ago). I fell in love with it. It was made of a thick stretchy material that was incredibly comfortable and made you look fantastic. My dresses got some wear and tear so I decided to buy this dress again. What I got was a dress made of this shitty, see-through, less stretchy material. Its itchy and not comfortable. I'm so saddened that you switched to this cheap material now. BUYERS BEWARE, pictures from reviews are most likely made of the old, better material. These dresses are now made of cheap material and not worth it."
2.0,"The neckline of this dress is a stretchy elastic band. That may help it stay up, but it also looks really strange. The material was pretty thick which is nice, but I couldn't get over the odd neckline. It reminded me of the top of sweatpants. I returned it."
2.0,"I am 5'2"", 120 lbs, and I wear a Sm or Xsm in most brands. I got this in a small, but it was very uncomfortable. I am 32C, and the cups were large enough and supportive and wouldn't likely show nipples.  But, the straps were entirely too tight and aren't adjustable. I lasted about 10 minutes before I had to take it off.  Otherwise, appears well made but I didn't wash it in the machine because I don't plan to wear it."
2.0,Torn crotch
2.0,This is our second purchase. Lobster claw broke on the first one. No way to fix. My daughter bought it for her boyfriend’s initial. She wanted it fixed but kits were more than the necklace. We paid for another one. Hoping this one lasts!
2.0,Elastic band ripped within a couple weeks
2.0,"I bought three different veils from SAMKY to try on and while the edge was really pretty and the length was exactly what I was looking for, I felt like the tulle was just too stiff. All of the veils were like this and if I hadn't tried on veils while dress shopping, I would have thought this is just how they are. I ended up buying a David's Bridal veil that was on sale for about the same price as these veils and it was a significant difference in quality. I wanted to love one of these veils for the rhinestones and price but the quality just didn't do it for me."
2.0,"They rub against my foot, very uncomfortable."
2.0,"I read the reviews. I kinda knew what to expect, however I hoped that I may be one of the few that had a great experience. I ordered the gold and was pleased with the fit and proceeded to order the silver. The silver arrived and fit considerably tighter.<br /><br />I really only needed one wear out of these as they were part of Mardi Gras costumes. I also had no idea how they should be cleaned after what was promising to be an unusually hot Mardi Gras. My concerns of cleaning the pants were dispelled when both pairs of pants shredded, beginning at the back pockets and proceeding through the inseam on the first wear.<br /><br />They were fun while they lasted."
2.0,"Mmm very thing material,  nice for only 2-3 times wear ."
2.0,"I expect the quality that is advertised on the product image. That is not what I received.<br /><br />I’ve bought Lugz shoes several times and they usually have very small dislikable details that are still acceptable.<br /><br />This time, I bought the royal/navy blue and the all white ones. Both have disappointed me, knowing its errors were caused while manufacturing and should have NOT been sold. The biggest deficits are from the left white shoe being on a bad angle & the right blue shoe having the white outer layer going over the blue thin line design. The white outer layer is not placed correctly on both the blue & the white shoes."
2.0,The sizing is inconsistent.  No two are the same.  What's the point in buying a multi pack if they're all different sizes? I'm not  happy with this product.
2.0,If you're standing it the right position this dress is lovely but dont sit or slouch or everything unwanted shows. The material is thin and it clings showing the line of under garments and any other curve and personal imperfection.
2.0,Product didn’t fit. These are made for kids and cheaply made. Not worth the $18.
2.0,"Just horrible. Talk about a misrepresentation of photos, dimensions, sizing. Off by about 3 sizes. Torso is super short and narrow for the sizing dimensions I ordered."
2.0,Wonderful material nicely made but way too small....xxl is a medium
2.0,the sneakers have no arch support
2.0,Not even 5 days and they started changing color already.
2.0,The top is nice in material but the beads comes right off after I wore it once.
2.0,"ITS PLASTIC !! & it doesnt have form, & it's cut like this )( instead of having an hourglass shape. You get what you pay for!"
2.0,Please note if you are purchasing these shoes in the U.S. that the sizing on these shoes is not based in the American shoe sizing system. These shoes were way to small for my son. He could literally only get half of his foot into the shoe. I had to return to Amazon. Do yourself a favor and if you are going to buy a generic shoe make sure that the shoe itself is based in the American shoe sizing scale.
2.0,I love this bag but I ordered two and only received one....
2.0,The battery did not last even 3 months.
2.0,"I wore it twice and the chain broke. The heart is darling, great color, but I'll have to find  something to hang it from."
2.0,It’s as cheap as anything. Falls apart as soon as you get it wet.
2.0,"It’s a really nice earring and very detailed but I had reordered this earring thinking it would be the same size as the first one and it wasn’t, this one is bigger and a different color than the first one."
2.0,Definitely getting what I paid for. I'll honestly never wear it.
2.0,"The reviews that I read on the site said “true to size”, so I ordered a medium. I’m 5’6” and 125 lbs and have always worn a medium, but this should be ordered at least one size larger. Loved the style though!"
2.0,"These didn't last long.  After a short period of time, the ring relaxed and the segment piece no longer fit snuggly.  Thus the segments fell off while wearing them which can also cause you to lose a nice earring piece that you've attached.  I don't recommend this product unless you are okay with taking them off every time before you shower and buying new ones periodically.  While washing in the shower, the movements next to the ear caused me to lose earrings down the drain."
2.0,Very dull pink color and runs big and wide
2.0,"It's difficult to day if it runs small or large. The shirt is snug, and the pans are HUGE!  The whole outfit is pretty strange.  But I'll make it work."
2.0,"Way too large and is very cheap material. Don't go with size recommendations, they're incorrect!"
2.0,"These earring look cheap. The metal is flimsy. The stone sticks up to high so looks weird. Even for the good price, I sent them back because I new I would not wear them."
2.0,Awkward fit.  Giving to my 7 year old
2.0,Very cheap looking and rough finished! Poor quality
2.0,"I ordered this sweater in red, and received orange. Don’t order if you have your heart set on a particular color. If you don’t mind getting a mystery color, go for it. The sweater itself is decently soft and the sizing is fairly accurate (this is meant to fit loose!)<br />It would have been really nice to have the red sweater I ordered though."
2.0,"Looks nothing as pictured, but at 5'10 size 16 I should have known better. It's really short so I'll keep it and wear it with tights I guess."
2.0,Loved the look and feel but does not support me. This bra gives no support and everything just hangs down. My boobs come out of the top make shirts look funny. I tried to adjust the bra like pulling it down in the back etc and still not a good fit and definitely no support. You get what you pay for.
2.0,Decía que tenia la solapa de satin y no fue así. No me gustó! Lo quería con la solapa de satin y no slim fit… en español no estaba claro que era slim fit…
2.0,"Floppy latex kind of material, decent quality. No eye holes. Only 2 small holes in the nose so we had to cut the eyes out."
2.0,"I ordered this item in January! And I JUST opened it up and was shocked to see it. It’s ok, you get what you pay for. It’s not completely smooth with weird bumps and the white dots are very small, but again, you get what you pay for."
2.0,I ordered these pajama pants for my husband to wear to our Christmas Eve Pajama Morning tradition we have every year. I ordered a large and unfortunately they fit more like a medium. Was unable to wear :(
2.0,Latch comes apart within 5min of wearing it
2.0,"I was looking for a secure type of pants and the RFID was the reason for the purchase. Unfortunately, the pants left out the other part of the security aspect. It has no buttons, zippers or anything to close the pockets. I will keep the pair I purchased, but am already looking for another company that can provide that basic security of keeping pickpockets away."
2.0,"These were not what I expected and I'm considering returning. We already owned 8 of these and wanted to buy 4 more to complete a set of 12 but the 4 we received look MUCH different. They look like they were spray painted silver -the pictures show undertones of copper, consistent with the original 8 we currently own, however this is not the product we received. Very disappointed. Will likely return and purchase directly from the artist."
2.0,Was very small for a key chain. Was quite disappointed
2.0,These work great but not really well made. The pull string broke on one after a few wears.
2.0,"This product runs small, but is good quality"
2.0,very cute but the shoulder straps rubbed against my skin and gave me a burn
2.0,"the ring it's heavier than expected (which is good) I believe that the ring size it's not correct cause I ordered an 11 and it was a little big but not too much so it is perfect, problem is, that the skulls don't look the same as in the picture.<br /><br />It's a shame cause I can see that the quality of the ring it's very good but well what can you expect for this price?"
2.0,"the strength of sight and UV, glare reduction is good but made is supremely cheap. It broke too after a few tries i forced myself to attempt looking at the anazon reviews. Wouldnt recommand unless really in budget."
2.0,"The material is really thin.<br /><br />When I bend my knee, I can see straight through the leggings. It's not like I bought ones that are too tight either, cause the leggings wrinkle at different parts of my leg. I'm not exactly sure what makes these different from regular leggings.<br /><br />The only reason this product is not getting a 1 star is because the price is fair for what it is."
2.0,I ordered up a size (usually XS/S and ordered M) and the bottom was way too small and cut into my hips. The top fit perfectly (34B for reference).
2.0,"#1 When advertising as Straw hat it should be a straw hat and not some crazy plastic feeling material. If it's straw it must have been pulverized and something added. #2 hat fit great but because it's made of some funky material it has whatever shape it has and Always goes back to that same shape. Expected a lot more for price, back it goes"
2.0,"not sewed to well. quality is low and not true to size. had to give it away. There is no shipping labels or receipt in package, so its difficult to return"
2.0,Love the top very cute. I wear size  large and it fits my daughter who wears size small.
2.0,"too short AND SHORT WAIST FOR ME. IM 5"" 7"""
2.0,Its too big to be a small.
2.0,Not as great as I expected.
2.0,"Very tight. The pink was also see through. I usually where a small. This small was way too tight on waist, butt and thighs."
2.0,I have purchased several set of nonstretch boxers in same size that fit with no problem.
2.0,This is a pretty necklace but it irritated my skin very badly and left a scar.
2.0,"The fabric was a heavy, double-layer linen and cotton blend that was much thicker than I expected, and certainly too warm for a summer top. The fit was very snug for me (~ size 14/16) . A US size 8 might think this top was loose-fitting. I returned it."
2.0,"The necklace itself looks very cheap. I only wore it a couple times before I got rid of it. The individual chains kept getting all twisted and it was too much of a hassle to fix the chains every half hour when I wore the necklace. Honeslty don't waste your money. Also the charms aren't evenly aligned. The triangle charm is slightly off which is fustarting and just makes the necklace look ridiculous. Spend your money on a better more expensive necklace, not this cheap junk."
2.0,"This anklet is very dainty and pretty but it didn't even last a week before it broke. Also, I have fairly large ankles and this was too big for me."
2.0,I did not like so i returned but it's well made.
2.0,"Did not fit well, I believe it is  made for a longer torso than mine. Love the style though"
2.0,I ordered a 3XL THINKING I would have a bit of wiggle room. They look like a small with a 3XL label.<br />They look and feel nice by touch but that's all can judge it on. Had to give to my niece.
2.0,Fits perfectly but had to return it.  Material is rough and very scratchy.  Would have been very uncomfortable wearing it all night.
2.0,Tired of misleading titles. Bought it because title said slim fit. Nothing slim fit about this. It’s like a regular cheap black Hanes shirt plastered with a thick decal that is uncomfortable and will probably wash off after a few washes. Will be returning. I don’t get why sellers aren’t just honest you know we will return it if it’s not as described.
2.0,Bulkier than we thought.  Moved around in the glove a lot as well.  Looking into full sized glove instead.  Will be better fit.
2.0,changes color dont buy
2.0,"Love the fit of this shirt, but I was surprised when I read the label for washing. It said to wash separately or ""Dry cleaning recommended"". Since it's red, I decided to play it safe and wash it in the kitchen sink. It definitely isn't color fast. The wash water didn't turn super dark red, but it was definitely pink. Very glad I hadn't included it with the rest of the load of laundry. I don't know if the other colors will bleed, I only tried the red one. Very disappointed because I really like the shirt!"
2.0,"Heavy, and constantly popping open on their own!  Will not stay fastened closed!"
2.0,"I found it not as loud, as I thought it was suppose to be. I put mine on my purse and if it is bumbed in any way the pin comes out and it goes off. Like in Walmarts, home etc. Not what I expected. I wouldn't buy it again. I got 3 for me, daughter, granddaughter.<br />I also should of read the reviews."
2.0,"The plastic piece used to close the design in the keychain falls out super easily. I have had many friends lose that piece of plastic and some, unfortunately, lost the artwork inside. If you tape them shut it functions, but then there's a piece of tape on your keychain. I would recommend spending some more money on higher quality keychains to avoid it falling apart."
2.0,"I did not care much for it, to thin.<br />Feels like a summer cardigan."
2.0,Cheap and way too wide. Falls off. Only good if you're babies foot is super wide.
2.0,"As a female, it is hard to find this sort of aesthetic in our pants so I thought I'd try the men's and I usually enjoy the fit of men's pants but these were so tiny with 0 stretch, so even with the largest size, I could not wear them. A real bummer. Hopefully they make these in larger sizes in the future."
2.0,"It's not the best material,  but it will make a great beach dress"
2.0,"Earpieces are not made with elastic or stretchable material so I'm having to stretch the fabric to get it to work,"
2.0,Not very flattering unless you look like to model photo
2.0,I’m 5’3 and 120lbs.  I got a small and ended up returning it.  It was too big on my and really big in the armpits.
2.0,"Picture of dress is done what a slight difference . The bottom of dress is different, yet beautiful"
2.0,The material is very nice and soft and its well made but...........There is no way this hat is meant for a baby!! Im a 23 year old women wearing it over my braids right now! My child wouldn't fit this until she was grown.
2.0,"If I had the chance to feel the fabric before purchasing, I wouldn't have purchased. It's that awful t-shirt fabric that's stiff and slightly itchy and never softens. Color and fit are good, but I'm disappointed with it."
2.0,Largest size was still small without much extra so it did not hang well.. material was heavier than described.
2.0,Sweatshirt not Sweater
2.0,"The shorts look good and fit nice. My problem is the pockets are to small. My iPhone just narrowly fits, however when I sit down it falls out. Anytime I sit in the car, the phone is dropped on the floor."
2.0,Quality not as espected. Looks different from picture because the fabric is very thin and transparent. It’s not voluminous.
2.0,Wanted this for my dog. Lasted one day. Very poor metal
2.0,They fit snug not sloutchy as in pic.
2.0,Material is very cheap and thin
2.0,"Nice design, but too small."
2.0,"They're mediocre socks. Fit is okay, but they're kind of rough and a little tight-feeling at the top.  They seem like they shrunk a little in the first wash, not dramatically, but just enough to make them just a little too snug for comfort."
2.0,"Al cabo de 3 semanas de uso en la parte inferior al lado de la tapa, se le hicieron burbujas en el metal como oxido, modelo chevere, brazalete muy bonito y resistente, una pena lo que le sucedió,la entrega fue rápida."
2.0,"Looked pretty but the sizing they gave and the actual size are two different sizes. So it is not safe to go base off the size given. I chose 6-12 months, but this thing is for a 2, maybe even 3 year old. Cute clothing though."
2.0,"Already broken, too weak."
2.0,"This skirt fit very nicely and was the perfect  floor length. But it was very disappointing that while wearing it the first time, I discovered a small hole  in the middle of the skirt. It was a small hole,  but not appropriate to wear it in this condition."
2.0,"not the greatest, the thumb pad fell off the main part, had to reattach with rubber cement, wears down and quickly as the standard set that came with the controller."
2.0,This was big hat for a woman.  Larger than my normal hats and the material was hard. It was very light though. I returned it.
2.0,The material is really thin.
2.0,"Way smaller than expected. I ordered it as a gift so I returned it and was disappointed that I then had to pay shipping but overall glad they accepted the item back promptly and refunded my card as well, minus the shipping charge."
2.0,Great Image...not to keen on the material
2.0,"I knew as soon as I saw this it would not work.  The leather and style is very good.  But the buckle to open and close the purse is very difficult.  Even to get small item you need to take it off to unbuckle and buckle it.  There is no safe way to leave it open.  So for me, I can not use it."
2.0,Described as winter sky…looked blue on my screen. Not blue.
2.0,Adorable suit! Looked great on. Underwire poked out in two places almost immediately after trying it on. I was so disappointed. :(
2.0,"Love how soft these pajamas are, very comfortable.  But the plastic piece on the strap broke after 2 weeks so only way can wear it is by sewing it together, which I will do because these are so comfortable."
2.0,"Material looks love cotton or similar, but it is very cheap/ polyester, shiny, my daughter says they look like hospital shirts."
2.0,Comfy. But very thin and not compression leggings
2.0,"Didn’t fit my 6 year old very comfortably, it was sitting almost right on her eyes. The material was extremely thin and when my daughter spoke the fabric was getting sucked into her mouth because of how tightly/stretched the mask was."
2.0,"These kind of hats should have a reference size, so one knows what to expect when buying it."
2.0,"Bought for my husband and it's way too short. Read the reviews and even the Q&A where the company told someone else to stick with XL for guy who was 250 and 6'3. My husband is same height so figured it would be great. This is so short of he lifts his arms the bottom comes up to his chest. Width is fine, but there's no way he can wear this. The pic shows it hits where you'd hope, but that isn't the case at all for us. Looking for contact info to see if this is normal and get an exchange if not."
2.0,Really loose fitting.
2.0,I ended up returning this. I thought the leggings were super scratchy because of the sequins.
2.0,Great quality hat but runs very small.
2.0,Quality differs from the Tesla pants I last got.  Material and fit uncomfortable.  Got a hole in the mesh part when I took it off.
2.0,Returned ugly
2.0,Gorgeous but they don't fit my ears
2.0,"For starters, do not use these if you are dealing with an active rash under the breasts...ouch!!!  They just do not stay in place unless I am very still which is most definitely not me!  Also, I don't know if it because my skin is very sensitive but I find them rather itchy and harsh feeling.  Just did not work for me."
2.0,I didn't really lije the fit nor the material.
2.0,Dress was beautiful but the material did not allow much GIVE for the fit. I think there should be more size options.
2.0,"The bottom hem was not straight. There was a difference of about two inches from the left side to the right. Its too bad bc I really like it otherwise, but it just looks ridiculous and sloppy."
2.0,"I love 5.11 products but these gloves were very uncomfortable, especially in between my fingers. The thumb was also just a tad too long, not a big  deal but i do not have the level of dexterity i expected with these."
2.0,Color is much different than advertised.
2.0,"Very thin and cheep looking. Much smaller than I anticipated. I thought that it would have antique looking finish, but it doesn't"
2.0,"It ordered a large but it was a very small large. Out of the four different large sweatshirts I purchased from different vendors, this was the only one that won't fit."
2.0,Did not fit as any other scrub top I have ordered did. Weird material.
2.0,"I have bought two of these dresses as they were great at first. However, after several months, the fabric doesn’t hold up so well and it becomes clingy and doesn’t look so good."
2.0,It was beautiful but fell apart right away.  The hanging part between the the wings broke.  It was broken when I received it. So sad because I liked it.
2.0,"First, it says the band is ""easy to wear with the pin and adjust,"" however, it's on an elastic band with no visible way to adjust it and comes with no instructions.  Also, according to the product description 'It fits for 5.5""-6.9"".'  My wrist is 6.5"" in circumference, so it should fit rather snugly, but as you can see in the photo, it's very loose with a gap between the band and my arm.  That results in the Fitbit not staying against my wrist so that it cannot measure heartrate, etc.  I will be returning this band."
2.0,"I am 5' 1&#34;  36-33-43  bought a medium. Nice pattern-  top fits but bottom area is too narrow. if i had bought the large it would of fit at the bottom but very big on the top.  Don't know what kind of measurement they use..not right at all... weird.  Won't recommend .  Also, the price is tooooo much...$17.95  should of been $8.00"
2.0,It fits awkwardly. The area for the bust is up too high. Not underneath the breasts. It runs a little large and is loose. But the area around the breast is just a terrible fit.  No pictures of this on me. It looked terrible.
2.0,Very poor quality. The materials are cheap and poorly constructed. One of the arms on the pair I got was extremely hard to move and I felt the cheap metal would probably break soon if I kept them. I definitely think they are cute but the cost is a bit high for such poor quality.
2.0,"Super cute design, but there is not structure to the waistline, so they constantly fall down. Too annoying to continue to wear them. Sucks, because they are really cute. I wear a size 7/8 5'8&#34;, 165lbs. I don't have big hips either, which doesn't help to keep them up."
2.0,It is lovely to look at but after a day or two the lettering became detached from the ring and catch on things.
2.0,"The umbrella is  very heavy and hard ,for my hands to open. The concept  is unique it is just not made for someone with arthritis in hands..."
2.0,"I had to return these: I don't think they were genuine silver and they were rather smaller than I expected, though they were quite pretty and had a nice movement to them. I have a nickel allergy and all of my earrings are .925 sterling, which I don't have a reaction to. However, I did have an allergic reaction to these earrings so unfortunately they had to go back."
2.0,It looks OK but they don't appear to be that well made and not a hint of sandalwood!
2.0,looks and feels great but changed its appearance and became pillowy after first wash. Will not be able to order any more even though its a great sock otherwise.
2.0,"They are very thin and the plastic in the hook very hard to take off, the break very easy ."
2.0,I kept this but it really isn't very nice. The material is scratchy and not really a good oatmeal color. The color is more yellowish. If I hadn't washed it to try to get to soften up I would have returned. I typically where a large/12 and this fit just right.
2.0,"Tapers were fine, just the tunnels itself really dried out my ear. My ear swelled up and caused a lot of pain because of the low quality of the tunnel itself."
2.0,"It fits well, looked good.  Notice the past tense? It has been up for 2-1/2 weeks and it’s already faded.  Too bad. so sad.  Cheap. Cheap. Cheap."
2.0,Gas door wouldn’t close with it in there
2.0,"Cons: Magnets are weak, the only thing that keeps them attached is the notch in middle.  the tints are very minimal.<br /><br />Pros: Cheap but you get what you pay for."
2.0,These things are so friggin small. Buy two sizes larger if you want these. Wouldn't fit a 180 16 year old
2.0,"Heavy, hard to set-up, runs down too easily. Next time will get a known quantity."
2.0,color was darker than pictured.  Looked like the color of dirt.
2.0,They keep you very very warm
2.0,"Ordered a medium. I am a medium. Checked sizes, it's much too large, and not slim at all."
2.0,It is huge; size down.
2.0,PJ did not fit. Our son wears 12/14  Even tho ordered size 14 it fit like a size 8.  Couldn’t even pull them up properly. But product looked great.  Just sized very badly
2.0,Ugh. I wanted to love these. They broke immediately when they arrived. They are definitely cheap. They are cute and might work for a costume if you want to glue them to keep them working. So disappointed. Extra star because they sent a small gold color bracelet along with them. Easy return process.
2.0,I usually wear a 2x but according to the chart I ordered a 4x. Well it fit more like a 1x. I could get it on but it was way too small. Otherwise it was very nice.
2.0,"Incredibly short. If you're 5'7"" or taller don't bother with this. It's also made of super thick polyester, so not as elegant as the pictures suggest"
2.0,"The boots look beautiful!  However the sequence  fabric is not stretchable, I could not zip the boots around my ankles. There was no return address either.  I was a bit dissapointed."
2.0,This shirt was HUGE.
2.0,Pretty disappointed! There are no sequins on this shirt as advertised...just a stick on picture of a wine glass! Also runs small.
2.0,Fit great until I washed it.  sleeves shrunk a couple of inches.  The length shrunk a good 3 plus inches.  That was disappointing.  The only plus is the fabric was softer after the wash
2.0,"My wife found these to be a little starchy and thin.  Beyond that there will pills and they started fading after one wash.  She thinks they're fine for wearing around the house as they're reasonably comfortable.  On the plus side they have pockets and a drawstring, but other then that she found them generally unremarkable."
2.0,"The arms are tight! I am 5’8” & 140lbs...The arms squeeze at the top pretty badly, fits everywhere else. Will be returning."
2.0,They are really hard to get into my piercings for some reason and one of the earrings were broken when I got them. They are also quite heavy for how small they are. I was really excited about these and they just didn't  live up to my expectations.
2.0,Fringes are bad
2.0,Not for a toddler - too small. Would be fine for an infant.
2.0,My daughter was so disappointed! This is supposed to be a women’s and I ordered her a extra large and it fit really weird.  Too small and too big in all different places.  Then you look at the belt and it’s not attached in any way with Velcro that doesn’t work.  Definitely don’t order
2.0,I felt like a sack of potatoes.  Would have been great as a maternity dress as there is a lot of room in the belly area. I returned it
2.0,I had em for about a month till they ripped
2.0,"Fit weird, kinda look like baseball pants. Not a fan and waited too long to return them"
2.0,Didnt really last lights went out quickly
2.0,"Not the fit I expected. The actual fit is somewhat boxy. The picture online shows a more shaped fit. This is 100% not the case.  The sleeves are shorter than how they appear on the picture.  The fabric is soft, but I do not believe a $26 price tag should accompany the shirt. It's more like a $15 shirt. I think I will be returning it.  I do have to say, that the packaging was very nice. The shirt came in it's own zip top bag which kept it nice and neat."
2.0,Product not made very well
2.0,"I gave this two stars because I liked the print, but that was the only thing I liked about this dress. It’s see through and fits snug. Order a size up or two if you want it loose like it is on the model, but honestly, this dress was a disappointment. Returning."
2.0,"It’s soooo cute...but sooooo see-through!  The material was so thin that the points were twice as white as the rest of the dress and you could see my belly button and my underwear right through the skirt!  Maybe in a darker color it would be ok, but white was not the best choice.  It will be returned."
2.0,"I read s lot of reviews before purchasing this bag, and I wanted to love it. It is super cute, but the zipper broke from regular use on the second day I had it. I've been walking around with an open bag for weeks now. And it starts to look dingy and cheap very quickly. Next time I will spend a little more for a better bag."
2.0,Awkward fit and somewhat open in the back so cant wear a bra
2.0,"it's a stretch to call these ""sweatpants."" They're basically a tshirt for your legs. The cut is really weird. The crotch is super long and hung at least 4"" below my crotch, then the legs were pegged. And that waistband string hung below my knees.<br />I'm 5'8"" and usually wear a size 12 jeans, I bought the L and they fit but were very odd and therefore uncomfortable."
2.0,Hard to put them on our little one.  Cute and well made but difficult to use.  The sole has almost no grip.
2.0,The hoodie was way to big
2.0,"The looks of the watch is pleasing . and it wears well. The problem is at the end of each month you have to manually change it to the first  of the month . The date runs 01 through 00 before it gose to the first of each month . When you get to the 30th of each month you have to push the date button until you get to 00 in order to change the date . What is bad is that the watch runs 30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37.38,39.00. It gets old after a while<br />and While the watch is nice to look at I would not buy it again"
2.0,"way small. like Asian sizing or something.  Can't wear for the foreseeable future.  Disappointing.  Otherwise, it seems great."
2.0,I was super excited about this purse I got it for a vacation I was taking. It arrived on time but the manufacturer made it poorly. It arrived Friday evening and Saturday morning after arriving at the airport I noticed the zipper was tearing. It was sererating from the purse. Then later that afternoon I was walking when I heard a snap and my purse went flying. I looked and the strap snapped off. Now I’m out of state and have a purse without a functioning zipper and no strap to hold it. I will be returning this when I get back home.
2.0,"Material is fine, but the colors are deceiving in the picture. I chose the grey option, but the grey is way lighter than the picture. Plus the collar, top part of the pockets, outline of the sleeves, and bottom of the garment are a light GREEN (not a dark grey as pictured), so it takes away from the style."
2.0,the bottom came apart before I put them on. looks pretty. needs to be glued better with a better glue.
2.0,"I purchased this watch because of a recent purchase of another Speed Master homage from Pagani Design. I was disappointed with this one as my attempts to size the bracelet resulted in one broken and one bent pin removal tool (including the tool that comes with the watch).  No matter how I tried I could not get the pins to budge.  The watch is beautiful, but I can’t wear it with an extremely loose bracelet.  I would have rated this product 4-5 stars, but I’m sad that I was unsuccessful with this watch."
2.0,Gave this to my mom for Mother's Day. It was pretty but unfortunately fragile as it broke after only the second time she wore it.
2.0,they look blurry to me
2.0,didnt fit so well
2.0,"I expected a bit more. When they came I was really excited, but when I opened them one of the bling pieces looked like it was about to fall off. Then I looked closer and there was a HUGE glob of glue under it AND it was glued on crooked. I found 3 with glue coming out the sides and crooked. Not impressed at all. Yes they were a lower price, but not low enough to be this crappy. I could buy $4 earrings at Walmart that were better quality than these."
2.0,"These glasses have nice frames, I'll give them that. The plastic is thick and the green is vivid. The lenses came pristine - not a scratch. The problem is the mirror coating. The right lens has more coating than the left, which obscures your vision if it's not bright out. I'm keeping these because I wanted vacation sun glasses that I won't miss if I leave them at the hotel (It's a thing I do...).<br /><br />I would purchase with caution."
2.0,I could’ve lived the rest of my life without this necklace.  The color was supposed to be a rose gold but it’s actually a dark brass looking color and the initial is much bigger than expected and lays kind of weird.  Keep looking. This probably isn’t what you’re looking for.
2.0,Poor quality. The thread is unraveling from the crown.
2.0,"Ordered the pink to match with some holo chokers I have, and was immensely disappointed to find out that the ""pink"" color is actually just a warm purple. It's best described as a dusty orchid color. Also, even though I bought a size smaller than recommended, it's still loose on my waist. The texture is as expected for such a cheap item and I don't expect it to last long, but that's not as big of an issue as the color being advertised wrong."
2.0,"One of the front buttons fell off the very first day. It was a birthday gift and my daughter didn't care so we kept it. Also, the buttons don't have corresponding button holes so you can't actually button it up. Kindof odd. But again, my daughter loves it and wears it nearly every day so not a game changer."
2.0,"Dress was as pictured as far as color and cut. But while it is a T-shirt material, it is a very heavy weight.  Too heavy for the cruise it was bought for. Returned."
2.0,different looking
2.0,"Love the fit and color. However, the inside is pretty rough feeling even after a few washes and fabric softener. Belt loops came off in the wash. It was a pain but I sewed them back in to avoid a hassle with a return. I never would have paid this much money for this."
2.0,Se ve diferente
2.0,Kinda bummed out since this bag was the perfect size and canvas material. BUT the one I received had broken zipper pull straps. I can definitely DIY some makeshift ones but I really needed the purse ASAP for a trip and now I have to scramble to fix it :/
2.0,"I love the colors but the fabric feels like polyesther and/or synthestic.  The socks are very thin and they don't bunch up, but sadly my feet sweat when I wear them and my feet are not prone to sweating."
2.0,The gloves are huge. And the hat is warm but also pretty big.
2.0,"Was difficult to change out some links as some pins wouldn't come out. The tool included to remove links broke so I had to improvise. Then some pins fell out making the watch fall right off, luckily nowhere that damaged the watch but could have been worse. Pretty frustrated with this product."
2.0,Not that great.
2.0,It's cute but wares super fast. The bottom is completely rubbed off after a week
2.0,"I loved the size of the bag and the slim storage capability. But after only one use (when the bag was full), the strap ripped out of the fabric, breaking it. I’m not sure I can even return."
2.0,This was my daughters birthday present. The package I recieved was broken. I've sent it back and they sent me an E-mail saying they refunded my money which they haven't and accused me of modifing it and breaking it. I only got 2.90 back and not the 14.90 I was promised. They did say that they genererously refunded my money because there policy normally doesn't give refunds. So nice! thanks for a broken piece my daughter didn't get to even wear!. The product was nice looking if it wasn't broken. I have tried to get my money back but just keep running into problems. I just wanted another item of the same thing instead I paid about 12.00 for nothing. 14.90 minus the 2.90 they refunded. Disapointed!!!
2.0,These glasses are decent. The are smaller around the eye than I like.
2.0,These don't fit over glasses. Mine or a dozen other people's.
2.0,Pool area worthy at the most
2.0,"This is not the same color or pattern as Irish Heritage.  If you are expecting similarities between this and other kilts/skirts, abandon those impressions.  Also, you get what you pay for here.  It's a very very cheep material."
2.0,hard to stay on the ear
2.0,Did not look like the picture. I ordered a size up as I am a bit chested and still disappointed with sizing.
2.0,"The eyes are not good. Poorly positioned and hard plastic with mesh, hard to see out of, can see the seams of eyes too much"
2.0,Pictures look cute but it's not worth ordering.  It's itchy and doesn't look good at all. The knitting was very inconsistent to where parts had small gaps that would only get bigger. Go with Paul Jones if you want nice cheap cardigens/shawls. I promise you you'll love them.
2.0,"These glasses have a cute style, but they block out a LOT of light. I first tried them on indoors while I was looking at my computer. I wear reading glasses for books, and I have a pair of distance glasses for use at my computer. Without glasses the text on the computer is blurry, but I can read it if I squint. When I put these on, I couldn't read a thing. The text was really blurry.<br /><br />I don't wear glasses outside or while driving. I need them for reading, computer work, and I occasionally wear my distance glasses for watching TV. These glasses block out so much light that everything outside is blurry. They're not too bad if I'm wearing them in the shade, but when I stand in the sun, the light bounces off my face to the back of the lenses, and then I can hardly see anything.<br /><br />I would wear these outdoors in the sun only if I had a visor to block the overhead sun from my eyes. I just don't like walking around in a blurry world I can barely see."
2.0,Way to big for a 5 year old... I’m 26 and it fits me!
2.0,"I love the way the bra held me up. But it was sooooo uncomfortable. The first time, I would say the first couple of hours were fine then I realized that I kept adjusting it because it poking my ribs and bulging out from the sides. The second time it did the same thing almost immediately, And the PAIN OMGOODNESS!! I MUST RETURN."
2.0,The buckle after one month of use will not close anymore
2.0,Cute but you can tell quality is pretty low. Part of the clasp was missing. You get what you pay for.
2.0,"The smallest pair came broken. One of the tiny hoops do not close. This is probably super rare, but I was very upset that I couldn’t wear them right away!"
2.0,I would like to return this dress as it is too small in the chest.  However I do not have a printer and cannot print out a return label.  HELP!!!  It truly is a lovely dress buttttt....Can you all send me a return label please.......
2.0,Pedí mi talla usual y me quedo grande
2.0,Cute sweatshirt but it runs about 2 sizes too small
2.0,Bag seemed good at first but after a a few months the main zipper broke and has rendered this bag useless. Not sure it can be repaired. Not worth the money I paid.
2.0,Super cute but ran very small
2.0,I didn't want all 4. Just 2 out of the 4. I like the 2 I picked.
2.0,"I love the fit of the shirt, but I’m extremely disappointed that it’s hot pink instead of red.  I gave it 2 stars since this is really important to the overall theme of the shirt."
2.0,"Well, just received hoodie and notice it was really thin material.<br />Also, packaging made the very wrinkle which I needed to wash 2x, then steam iron, before thinking about wearing the item.<br />Might give hoodie as a gift."
2.0,"They are soft and very low profile, but all for nothing because they don't stay on."
2.0,"Fit to big on top.  I purchased this in a large and it swallowed me up.  I usually wear a 12-14, 5'8&#34; and 170 lbs.  I tried another dress similar in the style from another manufacturer and the Large was way to small."
2.0,"I don’t much care for this band the magnet sticks to anything, and keeps coming apart"
2.0,Saggy in the butt. Not flattering.
2.0,It’s fits perfectly on a small wrist! But it broke in 3 days. I’m not very active throughout the day and it just broke and my watch fell. I’m glad I was at home and not in a public place because I would have lost my watch.
2.0,Very cute bands but super tight and already came undone! Wore it twice.
2.0,Cute bra but so not for high impact running and crossfit. Tons of side boob.
2.0,"I realized before I purchased it that this was ""Made in China"" and the price was too good. I also knew it meant the coat would probably run small and the color would be ""off.""  But nothing prepared me for what I received.<br /><br />I usually wear a Large in a winter coat so I can wear heavy clothes under it.  Because this is from China I decided to order XXL and thought it would be perfect.  NOT!!  The XXL was tight even though I tried it on without a sweater.  Also, the zipper was hard to zip and when I finally got it zipped up, I couldn't get it all the way down and had to step out of the coat while it was still attached.  AWFUL!!<br /><br />Also, the fur looked VERY cheap, which was expected, but even after fluffing it out it still looked awful; it is too tight around the neck and the hood wasn't big enough.  Also, I thought I had ordered a beige color and received a nasty brown color.<br /><br />All in all, this coat is TERRIBLE and I do not recommend it.  Thank goodness returns are so easy with Amazon because I'm taking this POS to the Hub tomorrow.  I  need to get rid of it right away because there is no telling what will crawl out of this thing."
2.0,Cute print. Very thin fabric. VERY small. I ordered an XL and it fits like a medium.  Disappointing.
2.0,Not the best quality. Pretty much fell apart.
2.0,I wear a size seven shoe and these wouldn't fit a foot much bigger than mine.  They are very thin and the non skid plastic dots on the bottom are so thick that they are uncomfortable to walk on if you don't have a thick sock on. They slip off very easily.
2.0,"My costume was messed up. The head was upside down. I couldn't see! I had to keep pulling the eye part down. It filled up just fine, but the entire head was upside down. You can see from my picture the difference in the stock photo and my photo."
2.0,Arrived totally smashed and mis shapened<br />Looks faded<br />Looks like child’s hat
2.0,I guess you get what you pay for. I can't wear any of these. They are too thick and the design is horrible.
2.0,"Not happy with it, site said its 42 weist<br />And im 38 it didn't fit at all,"
2.0,Brazilian cut on the liner under the skirt.  Beware.
2.0,There is no stretch to this dress at all.
2.0,Order arrived quickly but the battery is pretty much dead and the second hand looks like it is having a seizure. The face of the watch is so raised that you scratch yourself. My son is so bummed that the battery is dead but he doesn't want to exchange it so now I get to fork out more money for a battery.
2.0,"I ordered this is a surprise for a Star Wars fan, but the one I received was not the one pictured."
2.0,"The hat is very nice. Quality looking and made well. Vibrant! But, after wearing it on a hot, sweaty day, the hat smelled like a fish. Took  a lot more washing to remove the smell. Haven't sweat in it yet. We'll see what happens."
2.0,I am 5”1’ and petite. It was fine up top but way too long. I felt like a child in her mothers clothes.
2.0,Just got this hat in today to replace my old worn Mopar hat and this one is so much thinner and flimsier. Looks good but feels cheap :(
2.0,cheap but you get what you pay forl.
2.0,Purchased 3.... One for each wrist to combat time space continuim issues I was experiencing when warping from planet to planet. Not shiny and very drab but the price was right.
2.0,"I ended up returning this dress.  The color is nice, but you cant see there is a seam right down the middle of the dress.  The pockets are also bulky and bunch at the hips."
2.0,I was unsatisfied its not as nice in real life as in the picture
2.0,Nice fit and color. Directions indicated to Hand wash and lay flat to dry or dry clean (which I didnt realize or wouldn't have bought). Still faded quickly.
2.0,they might have been already worn eww honestly thats just gross<br />i seen some left over crust that i use to have on my<br />other piercing jewlery after i would switch them. if they were going to<br />resale someones returns they could of at least disinfected it or made<br />it look new ... you get what you pay for i guess
2.0,"I wished that I could send back............way, way too large, and not the quality that I was expecting. Don't know what to do with it.  :("
2.0,"Decent looking tie clips and not a bad price. Problem is that two of the four clips had rough edges on the back. Tiny little imperfections that pulled on my tie's fabric and pulled out threads when taking it off or putting it on. Two clips I will never use and threw out so I don't ruin more ties. Disappointed. Two clips work as advertised, but of course are not the best looking ones. I would avoid buying again. Not sure if it will be visible in photo, but the chipping along the edge of the clip is what causes the snag point."
2.0,Material is not the best.
2.0,This is such a pretty earring but the front piece has come out several times and today it was no where around when I noticed it.
2.0,This shoe was entirely too big for my 2 year old as he wears an 8. I purchased these shoes for my grandmother's home going service as to it was an all white event because white was her favorite color. This shoe is like a pat and leather shine not what the picture portrays at all. On top of that the shoe looked as if it was going to melt in the sun...
2.0,It's too short in the torso!
2.0,The blue is actually mint green. Not blue at all!
2.0,These laces are stretchy polyester and when I unraveled each color they were not the same length—maybe off by an inch.  Kinda disappointing! Giving 2 stars because of the fast shipping.
2.0,"I really wanted this to be my go-to running hat. I live in the desert of Southern Utah and so the sun can be oppressive. I also don't always wake up early enough to get my long run in before the sun is out, especially in the summer. So I purchased this hat to allow me to run outside on days when  I wake up late and still want to run outside.<br /><br />The main problem with this hat is that the velco straps aren't in the right place. I actually don't think that velco really works for the design at all. The entire face front should be trimmer and brought in closer to the face and neck. As it is now, the front face cover hangs too loosely and doesn't conform to the face in a way that is comfortable. The front flap sort of just bounces around when you run and the eye slit never really stays in one place because the velco securement is too slack. The design team needs to go back to the drawing board and figure out a way to provide a head covering that is more form-fitting around the neck and face while still allowing ventilation. I have ordered the iColor running hat and am going to see if that works for my needs."
2.0,Sizing is a joke.
2.0,"I received this item as a gift from a family member but I did not like it.  I'm an Amazon Prime member and I tried to return it only a week after purchase, but I was not permitted to return it.  Be careful!"
2.0,"I don't usually write reviews.  I have before when I had something good to say about the product.  For this shirt, I have something good to say and something not so good.  The good is I like the looks of this shirt. The not so good is about the sizing of this made in China shirt.  It is sized in Chinese sizes; however, they give you a guide to convert the Chinese to US size.  Well I am 5' 10&#34; tall and weight 160 lb.  I am not large buy any stretch; so I ordered  the Chinese equivalent of a US medium.  When the shirt arrived I tried it on and couldn't even button it up.  Then I tried the Chinese equivalent of US large.  It was also too small.  I am happy to say that I am now wearing a US XL (chinese 3xl) for the first time in my life, and my wife says it is too small.  For slim Cowboys only"
2.0,The small size was VERY small and the washing instructions for a set of flannel pants (hand wash  and line dry) were very disappointing. Other than that the colors and material were very nice.
2.0,I fell in love with this sweater however when it arrived and I figured out how to put it on it doesn't fall as the picture. It def isn't as long and will look lopsided if you drape it off the shoulder and that's what I was hoping for. It doesn't cover as much of the back or towards the bottom of the back as shown. I'm in the air if I'm gonna return as it's not what I expected. And it's completely see thru. I so wanted to o love this sweater and it fall on me as it did the model. NOT
2.0,The title says Dual-Lense but they are not
2.0,This mask doesn’t stay in place no matter how you try to adjust it. It is very annoying. I don’t recommend.
2.0,"Too frágil, weak and didn't last too long before they became loose."
2.0,This shirt is not for someone with a long torso.
2.0,"I know this was cheap, so I did not expect major quality, but one of the stones fell out. It basically means the pair is useless. I didn't throw them out but I really should because I know I'm not gonna wear them like that.<br /><br />Anyway, it looked cool for 5 or six times. Basically, it's a nice looking pair of DISPOSABLE cufflinks. If you are ready to wear them a few times and then throw them out, then you will be happy with them."
2.0,These are not for babies. They are made in china so be aware
2.0,It was not clear in the description that the smaller bag did not have the side aater pouch. That was the whole reason for me buying this particular back pack.
2.0,Somewhat large and parts of the white braiding had an orange stain on them
2.0,"Alright... Here's the thing, this is the WORST material I have ever worn. That being said it looks just like the picture, and works fine."
2.0,Runs small ordered a size large and it fit’s like a small
2.0,"This was not what I expected, especially for what it cost.  I have processed a return.  The clasp is too small for me to be able to open & close it by myself.  I was hoping the adjustable nature of it would allow me to put it on over my head & adjust to shorted length, but not so.  It's so dainty, I'm afraid it would break & as previously stated, the clasp is too small and difficult to open & close."
2.0,Not as advertised I wanted the solid lines as picture shows but instead received one with dotted lines. It's a nice material and would've kept it had it been what was shown.
2.0,"The material is not soft. It is more crunchy. The crotch is shallow. It feels too small when I sit down. Overall, I did not like these pajama pants."
2.0,Bib is the thickness of a light T-shirt. Doesn’t really serve a purpose other than decoration
2.0,This swimsuit is not for women with a bust! Also the top is black and white and the bottom is navy blue.
2.0,The gloves were not perfectly fitting in all the way with the palm of the hands!!! They were out of shape.
2.0,It would be a very nice jacket if the sleeves weren’t too baggy even in a smaller size. It looks weird in the body. I returned it.
2.0,Deceiving pictures. Printed on and almost blurry In person.<br />Do I return it or wear as a pajama shirt.<br />Would not recommend.
2.0,Couldn’t keep it standing
2.0,Mask is too large...
2.0,"For the price, home lounging and outdoor walks these are perfect.  I love the pattern. I do not recommend them for squats in the gym!  Too thin - Under $20 I would not expect that anyway."
2.0,I am very annoyed that the clasps on the straps were not already on.  I had to assemble them myself.
2.0,"Size is right.  However, can't tighten the straps enough to fit, especially around the heel."
2.0,I can't really wear this top unless I lose weight.
2.0,Very cheaply made. Came with strings hanging everywhere.
2.0,"I had been looking to get some type of pendant to wear for some time to express my Lutheran faith and this was exactly what I wanted.  The necklace though is not that great.  I'm not sure if it is the workmanship or what but it has broken twice within the first 10 days I had it.  The first time it fell from my neck while walking and luckily I was able to notice that it did and not lose it, the clasp that connected holding it around the neck was not fully closed but I was able to repair this with a slight crimp from my leatherman.  The second time one of the smaller links came undone and I have not been able to repair this one so I was stuck spending the full price for primarily the pendant and will have to purchase a necklace to wear it from."
2.0,"It was cheaply made. The mesh was just weird and awkward, the sleeves were very long. Not good quality fabric and the embroidery wasn’t the same as in the picture"
2.0,"I typically wear medium to large tops. I ordered these in XL hoping to get them a little looser for comfort to keep me warm this winter. Even though each of the 3 tops had an XL tag, the sleeve sizes are 3 different lengths ranging from just to my wrists to about 2 inches too short! Even being XL they fit like a medium top typically would and are way too tight in the arms for comfort. It's a shame as the fabric feels really soft at least. Also be aware the Pink Heather doesn't look at all like the picture, it's an extremely bright neon pink. Overall really disappointed with this purchase, waste of money."
2.0,"Loved the flag, didn't like it falling of my shirt because of deficient fixture.  Since sending it back is not money efficient, Amazon can just reimburse me (or not, not that big deal, just don't want others to be disappointed in the product).  Slava Ukraini."
2.0,Poorly made. Mechanism that keeps it open broke after a couple uses and wouldn’t stay open
2.0,Loose top
2.0,"They have excellent pockets on the thighs (for some reason the other colour did not have the same pocket location) and they fit well, however this particular shade is see through."
2.0,"Shorts look and feel great but after 6 months, the trim that seals the seam around the zipper is coming off the shorts. This is a problem because the black trim seals the seam between the zipper and the fabric so the fabric is now going to fray in the wash. Really disappointed in the quality."
2.0,Socks are cute but incredibly thin.  Came apart after one wash.  Very disappointed!
2.0,Bought this for my wife.  The pants fit did not match the jacket.
2.0,"The band is fading all over after only one month. I never have it near water. Very disappointing. The small rhinestones are very dull, I was expecting it to stand out more. I would not recommend this band."
2.0,I normally wear a large and ordered 2 sizes up but it fits like a medium.
2.0,"Cheap, looks cheap"
2.0,"Dress was cute, but not true to size so had to return."
2.0,I can't get my foot in the boot
2.0,"The first one I received had a large hole on the fabric (not at a seam). The company did send a replacement. Both arrived fairly quickly but are shipping overseas. The jacket runs about two to three sizes too small. The quality is alright. I gave it to my mom, the cut and fit were great for her but she's petite and thin."
2.0,After one wash they were starting to pull apart
2.0,This is cute and well made. A little lager than I’d expected. However I’m very disappointed that the fabric has the number 35 clearly written on it in permanent marker. I don’t understand why the seller would send in this condition. It is clearly visible while wearing.
2.0,I ordered a 2xl which is usually big on me but this was way too small.
2.0,Product is good for shoes and high heels I guess for women for work boots or any other kind of boots it's not very good it's not the sellers faults the products fault I will deal with the seller again but I won't buy this product for boots
2.0,"Bought this as a gift for my husband only a couple weeks ago.  Fit is on the smaller side of what I'd expect for the size ordered, so there's that consideration.  There's not much give to the fabric, either.<br /><br />What I'm not happy about is that after only a few wearings, the exterior is pilling significantly.  I might expect that for an off brand or a very inexpensive sweatshirt.  I have a fabric lint shaver, but I certainly didn't expect to have to use it after only being worn three times.  I wouldn't buy this item again for that reason alone."
2.0,"These slippers are cute but the sole is VERY thin ergo, it's like walking on concrete. There is no arch support.  I would not buy them if either one of these things are an issue."
2.0,"Cheap, Chinese sweat shop quality.<br /><br />I have several beefs with these toe socks. Maybe I am spoiled since my first few pair of toe socks were the injinji brand (which btw are absolutely amazing i nthe realm of socks!) BUT these just scream cheap. First, they arrive as pictured each pair individually wrapped & packaged which is completely wasteful and made me feel like very wasteful having to unpack age each pair and toss a completely unnecessary amount of packaging.<br /><br />As for fitment, these are horrible, the little toe never comes close to lining up and it takes me almost 4x as long to put these on as it should. They are thin and get crusty very quickly.<br /><br />For the money i would HIGHLY suggest buying 2 or 3 pairs of quality socks and forgoing these."
2.0,"It runs very very small ... It's really cute and my 5-yr old,  very petite  grandson was excited about it bc it looks like a racing flag but it eased even too small for him"
2.0,size runs super small.  I ordered a 5 for my  5 year old daughter; as that is what she normally wears and it fits my 3 year old better.
2.0,My boyfriend bought this for me but the XS was way too big! I’m 5’6” and 130 pounds.
2.0,"The printed part is thick and stiff and looks strange around your armpit area. Shirt was a thicker material too which would’ve been ok, but I returned because of the armpit area!"
2.0,Don't look like pic. Way thin. Poor quality. Short hem.
2.0,These are two different sizes. The clickers are 16g and the other two are bigger. So I cant use them. I dont need two different sizes for one piercing.
2.0,The fit on the shorts was small for the usual size that I wear.
2.0,I was a little disappointed it wasn't that shiny and bright
2.0,Too small will not a standard school binder.
2.0,"Description says that can be used with one hand. Well, when you only have one hand and they don’t work, then description is completely wrong."
2.0,Style not flattering for a plus size gal.
2.0,"The plastic was more like a film, they were thinner than dry cleaner bags. Tore just trying to put them on."
2.0,Fair quality for price but rums small
2.0,broke after about a year
2.0,I felt these sandals in an airport store and found them to have good cushioning so I ordered a pair only to find that the sizing on line is too small.
2.0,"I actually really did love this, gave it as a gift and the recipient loved it too but the chain was catching in her hair (sign of poor quality) then very quickly and easily broke.  I tried to contact for a replacement and was sort of sent in circles to go back to Amazon for a replacement.  Maybe when I have extra time I can try to follow up on this again, but if it were my company I would have just sent along a new chain to keep a happy customer."
2.0,I got an xl to have that wide tunic like feel from it. To start off the top was extra loose (expected when you go up a size) but the bottom got progressively tighter to where the lace at the bottom would almost cut into my legs. Perhaps mine was just badly made since it has so many positive reviews.
2.0,The shoes are super cute but they do run a half a size too small.. I wanted to exchange the sizes but the company didn't offer that option.
2.0,Giam always runs tight and small not comfortable for working out in.
2.0,There are fibers that are present that I kept inhaling.  It felt like I had cat hair trapped in my throat.  I was out shopping and had to stop to buy a replacement mask. The color is pretty but these are not meant to be worn over the nose.
2.0,"This is a cute top, but the neckline is WAY too low!  I am 5'6&#34; and the neckline is so low that there is no way I could wear a bra with this, and what with me wearing a 4X a bra is an absolute necessity!  I only paid less than $7 and it is certainly worth more, if it fit, but since I will have a $7.50 return fee.  Since it will cost me money to return it, I will try to take up the neckline and wear it around the house.  Just know that if you don't want a lot of decollete, chose another top!"
2.0,Shirt was not a xxl. Small
2.0,"Item nice shining nice chain fyi very light weight, did not expect that at all."
2.0,Beads were flimsy and band broke with beads flying everywhere after wearing approximately 10 times. Really like the band just wish it was more durable.
2.0,I ordered a small for my daughter this skirt runs on the smaller side and is not as long as it seems my daughter wears a 6-7 so I ordered the small and it comes to mid calf. Order up a size!
2.0,WAY TO SMALL...GET 2-3 TIMES BIGGER THAN YOUR NORMAL SIZE...WAS DISAPOINTED WITH THE PRODUCT...IT DOESNT LOOK OR FIT AS IT SHOWS IN THE PHOTO....
2.0,"came with nleaf distorted, I was promised a new one but one never came."
2.0,"I'm sad. This looked really cool and my son loved all the pockets. It even did a good job holding the water bottle on the side. But, the main pocket zipper broker in 2 weeks."
2.0,"Ordered my normal size for Ryka and shoe was way too narrow, painfully rubbing my bunion!"
2.0,didnt realize that these are smaller than a dime.
2.0,"It does it's job, but it's uncomfortable, its scratchy & pokes my back all day. The hooks are opened to wide, so it kept coming off when I would but on my bra, so I used pliers to pinch them down more. I've only had it a few days & the seam is already undone from the elastic meets the fabric."
2.0,Sleeves are too big and the color is not as depicted. Had my hopes high but it feels like a very cheap dress and it also itches.
2.0,The shoes are definitely not leather. They fit my son very well and are very warm. But I'm not sure how long they will last.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:412f17a221f383d6853bbd55b1f5b305]] I would not recommend this product, not bright and vibrant in the picture as it appears… Thin sticky dull hat"
2.0,The neck line of the top is way too big.  Not what I was expecting.
2.0,"When I purchased these Bandolino Amy jeans, they were supposed to “sit at natural waist.” They are hip huggers!!! Fit everywhere except they rode very low in the back. Returned for refund."
2.0,Too thin for a man to wear
2.0,"Unfortunately, They still fogged up. 😢"
2.0,"Very cute, light cotton fabric but it’s not a long robe at all. The description and the picture led me to believe I was buying a robe that would go well below the knee. However, this robe hits me mid thigh. That’s a huge difference. I’m bummed I didn’t get a long robe like I wanted."
2.0,I've been looking for this set of earrings for a few years. Sadly these were way too small and I returned them.
2.0,"Sole is too thin, barely wear any shoes. My son got blisters on the back of heels. I bought another pair of Fresko Water Shark with adjustable closure at the back and &#34;real&#34; sole and is satisfied with those instead. Price reflect the quality."
2.0,Too small. I can't even wear a nightgown under it.
2.0,"Baggy , size down 1 size , this is very cheap material .. low low quality obviously made in China .. I’ll use it to wash the car 🤷🏽‍♂️"
2.0,bought this for shoulder surgery.  with how uncomfortable it is its not worth the little bit of ease it provided when removing shirt.Only buy if you really need.
2.0,Product is very thin and very tight for a man.
2.0,"I did not like that this dress was advertised as 100% cotton and it clearly wasn't. Wasted my time. I returned it. It was cute though. I also couldn't tell by the picture that there's a decorative zipper across the front. Nice overall dress, just not what I was looking for. I can't say how it fits. I didn't try it on."
2.0,no instructions on how to use them
2.0,"Actual quality of fabric poor, picture does not show actual fabric, wish I could return it."
2.0,XL fits like medium
2.0,Finally...the hat is pretty simple...i could have made this myself....Took forever to receive!!
2.0,"the red is not the deeper color shown in photo--much more red-red, much brighter<br /><br />lace is scratchy, but--that's ok-not a dealbreaker<br /><br />you know it runs small-don't pretend otherwise<br /><br />we like it...but, we don't love it...esp. for $18"
2.0,The lining is really itchy. Doesn’t fit like in the picture. Fits more like standard pajamas. Thick which is nice for when it’s cold
2.0,Save your money.  Looks nice on line but cheap in person.  Plan to return.
2.0,"Sad, i like the design. However the product looks like low quality once in my hand."
2.0,"The slit is in the strange place.  If you have fuller hips or thighs DO NOT buy this dress.  It looks bad.  The dress is very pretty, but it does not fit all body types"
2.0,"Sized up a size for slouchy loose fit.... waaaay too big and neck hole is like a t-shirt size opening, and scrunched elastic at the bottom.. not taped material... not off the shoulder as photo depicts.. material is cheap... reminds me of the printed tank top material you see at bargain stores where the inside is white and the outside has the printed pattern or color. Would not recommend if you want it to look like the model photo. Very disappointed"
2.0,"VERY see through, someone actually threw money at me  .. No but it’s very pretty but extremely see through"
2.0,These pants look nice but slides down below the belly. Not a fit.
2.0,this dress makes me look pregnant!  The waitline ends up right below my chest....I returned it.  Quality feels pretty decent.  Would've kept it if the waitline is lower.
2.0,The scepter is a great size but the blue came chipped.  I reordered it and it came the same way again.  This should be  sold in the dollar store.
2.0,Really disappointed in these. The patterns were really poorly done and the tights looked nothing like any of the pictures. I'd return them but they're not even worth the trouble. The only upside is that they do not squeeze too much at the top and they are rather comfortable.
2.0,"Should have bought one of these years ago. Wind-proof, water resistant and toasty warm at 0 degrees F.<br /><br />UPDATE: Lowered my score from 5-star to 2-star, because when I wore to ride my motorcycle I discovered the clasp wouldn't hold; blew off twice and I ended up carrying it home. Sorely disappointed.<br /><br />UPDATE: Male half of the clap broke in two places. Went to Hobby Lobby and bought a bag of nine high quality clasps for $2.99. Now these suckers HOLD!"
2.0,I would give it 5 stars for the images but the fabric is horrible as an apron.
2.0,"I bought three square scarves in one order, all from different sellers, each with an intriguing design. Of the three this one was the biggest disappointment. The fabric is virtually chiffon, when I tought I was getting a dense satin (when done well I actually prefer satin to silk) - and the colors look weak and faded. The design is gorgeous, the execution is the problem. If this design were on a lush, liminous satin and the colors had been more saturated this scarf would have been the star of my collection (the navy... I really would have loved the predominant navy). This one is kind of embarassing to wear in public after having been seen in better scarves so I probably will just sig, imagining what might have been..."
2.0,Falls apart wont stay on the ring it hangs from. Too bad because it's really pretty.
2.0,Small size it's not slim at all. It is too large. Not satisfied at all with it.
2.0,"Very cute. The large diamond is quite bigger than I thought, really like the smaller ones. However, I ordered a new nose ring because after 9 years my diamond fell out of mine and lost it. The straight edge of this ring is much longer than my old one and causing the end of the ring to constantly tickle and make my nose itch (like I have to sneeze). Going to try and bend and shorten the stem myself or take the diamond out and put it in my old one. The straight edge of the stem is about 1/16 to 1/8 longer than my old one! Which in your nose makes a big difference.  Also causing the ring to stick out from my nose and looks funny, keep pushing it back in. Hopefully can adjust them to fit comfortably."
2.0,"The material is lovely - soft and snuggly. Gorgeous print and colors. Sadly, the shape is like a maternity dress. Small shoulders, nice fit inbust, then poofs out  at stomach like I'm 7 months pregnant. I am 5’2 and 110."
2.0,"This is an absolutely gorgeous skirt. The only problem is it came without a lining, so I had to go to the store, buy appropriate material and sew one in myself. Without a lining you could see through it."
2.0,"Only gave 2 stars, because I don't like the material. It was a gift. I saw pictures, and it looks like a Jersey knit. Plus the arms are a little tight and uncomfortable above the elbow to shoulder. Will give to co worker"
2.0,Nice fabric but cheaply made. The seem runs all the way down the back of the sock and the fraying is visible. I suggest spending your money on a more quality sock.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this, but it is way to short for me!  The photos make it look like it is right at the high waist line, but it definitely is not. Others more confident and younger than me can no doubt pull it off, but I will be returning it :("
2.0,I loved these partially because of the silver zippers on one of the thighs. They're an ugly gold color with these gaudy charms. I'll be roving those and see if they're even somewhat salvageable after that because I  hate gold detailing.
2.0,"Awful quality but at a low price, I should have expected less. Passed on to my daughters as toys."
2.0,It run small and very uncomfortable.  Returned it
2.0,Poor quality--it sheds when used. But you get what you pay for...
2.0,They don't stay on as a cuff. They slide off and sangle
2.0,"I bought this for my child.  They picked it out.  It is so tiny I almost threw it away by accident.  $3 shipping for this and the $10.00 price is ridiculous.  I guess if you really love anime.  But this is the SMALLEST keychain I have ever purchased and never would have spent more than $3.00 had I known how tiny it really was.  Yes, I know it says 1.5"" in the description--but I didn't pick it out."
2.0,"Great color, great material, but shrunk at least 2 sizes upon washing! Super disappointed, cannot wear this."
2.0,"These bike tights are soft and the pattern is cute, but they are too tight around my thighs at the leg opening. They aren’t made for women with muscular legs like me. This is my second pair from a different company and I had the same problem with both pairs. Also the fabric is not sewn in at the seams in the leg portion of the tights. The extra fabric just sticks out beyond the seam.  Subpar sewing at best."
2.0,"This is a low end, inexpensive belt that truly only fits an extra small waist.  Don't imagine that because it stretches it will fit anyone larger.  You get what you pay for.  It's cheaply made and won't fit most people."
2.0,"The size and material was good, but, the workmanship on the seams was horrible.  Three of them did not survive two washings before the seams began to unravel.  I turned them inside out to keep my fingers from pulling the loose threads."
2.0,"Headband was WAY TOO TIGHT. Would've fit a child's head well, though."
2.0,"Very cute study sandals, but dont expect the glued on bow to stay put. One was already off when I opened the crushed box it came in. I re glued it using gorilla glue but the surface is smooth so it didnt stay stuck very long. It doesnt look horrible without the bow, but it looks very plain, so I havent been using it. The bow should have been sewed on, considering the nice quality of the shoe Im surprised it wasnt. If you have a heavy duty needle you could attempt it, but I dont, so I probably wont."
2.0,This product did not fit as it should have too small
2.0,Bought a large but probably should have bought a medium. The neckline hung way too low and was wide on the shoulders. Medium is what I usually get but after reading the reviews opted for a large. The fabric is nice and soft and the color is very pretty. I really wanted to like this however the pleats at the top do not come down as far as they show in the picture. Even on a large the pleats on the front only hit me at about mid chest. This made the shirt look very awkward when wearing. I'm a 36DDD so this might be very flattering on someone who is smaller chested. Will have to return.
2.0,"It’s more size 13 instead of 10, too big to wear."
2.0,Not completely what I expected<br />Not comfortable
2.0,"They did not stick well at all, kept falling off."
2.0,We bought the yarn and it’s supposed to be like a green and when we got it. ITS LIKE A CHAMPAGNE COLOR. Not happy with it.
2.0,The shirt itself was fine but the image was so dark you couldn't tell the picture from the background. The picture on the front was correct but the picture and the writing on the back was printed backwards.
2.0,"Front button came off when I first tried this garment on.  Pretty pants, just not the quality I expected.  Returned the same day."
2.0,"I like the unique 3 section design of this, but it seems like a pretty cheaply made shirt.  The material is quite thin (definitely not a sweatshirt as advertised), and the pocket sits very low, and is very small.  It just looks, and feels, odd.  Like the pocket is the size for a child's size garment, but it was accidentally used on an adult one.  Its too bad, because the design is decent otherwise, but, it just seems cheap."
2.0,"The outside pockets are so small they don't hold my cellphone, readers or a water bottle.  The inside has no slip pockets."
2.0,Like the style and feel but easily comes unlatched.  Bummer
2.0,"Super cute! Buuuttt, the size chart is way off.  I got a large and MAYBE an XL would fit if I had the patience to order them again. It forever to receive them."
2.0,I bought 2 pairs of these for a trip to the boundary waters for a 7 day trip. I liked the way the fit but in 7 days both pants ripped out in the crouch area. Granted this was a extreme trip with lots of active portages but I still feel for the money I’d never buy again!
2.0,I initially loved this bracelet. I ordered it in Feb2018 and just had opportunity to wear. I received several compliments on it but only to discover later two stones came out and one totally removed. I have the coordinating knecklace so I will order bracelet again at least I’ll have the stones if I need to replace....
2.0,It's extra large size
2.0,"i'm updating my review. these goggles fog up. after a few months, the strap broke. i'm disappointed."
2.0,This is not a unisex hat. This is a man's hat.
2.0,"The quality of the material was good, but the fit was snug, even when ordering a size larger than normal, and the button hole sewing was poor. The buttons kept snagging.  I'm returning."
2.0,Difficult to read. Picture looked better than product. Not sure if I’m keeping it yet.
2.0,"You get what you pay for. This is a cheaply made item that will only withstand about a month of daily wear, and then it will fray and fall apart. There's nothing wrong with the appearance or fit of the belt, though. If you just need something for short-term use, like for a costume or a special event, this would be fine."
2.0,This item was cheaply made. It broke the first time I tried it on. I would not order this product or from this company again. You get what you pay for.
2.0,Way to small. Im 5 ft 4 200lb and i cant zip it up! Xl? more liike a medium. get 3 or more sizes up fabric is nice print is cute
2.0,Belt buckle broke after 5 or so uses.  I like the concept and thought they would be sturdy based on description but snapped while putting it on.
2.0,palm sweats where the inserts are.  and I don't normally have sweaty palms.  I bought this at my doctor's recommendation so that I could still ride my motorcycle.  it felt awkward and definitely not a good thing to wear on a motorcycle.
2.0,"OMG I struggled so much putting this on. I was sweatting like crazy and had to pull it over my head and I feel like I almost dislocated something trying to do it. I wore it throughout the day and it felt very comfortable when on, but trying to get it on was NOT easy at all. Possibly I should order a size larger, but even still it did not have appeal. When taking it off I had just as much of a struggle and I ended up tearing a hole in it when taking it off.  Kind of wish that it had some instructions as to how to put it on (Maybe a silly question to ask, but for someone new to compression shirts, this thing is dangerous)."
2.0,cheap tacky look
2.0,"Wayyyy to large. I ordered the same top on white (it came in cream) in the same size, XXL from the same seller, and the black was wayyyy to large, the white/cream fit snug but good. Inconsistent."
2.0,"It looks very pretty, however the quality is poor. Change so quick. Delivery was not too bad."
2.0,Lasted 3 weeks before bottom of shoe came apart.
2.0,Not water resistant
2.0,The embroidery was snagged in several places. Very itchy and too long.
2.0,Slit is too high to wear to work; top is broad
2.0,This dress was good quality and a beautiful color and style. I would size down. Got a M.<br /><br />The only con is the dress came stained so I had to return it.
2.0,Poor quality for the cost. Wouldn't recommend.
2.0,This was great at first (I bought 2) but after a couple washes the color washed out!
2.0,"I did not like the fit or material, returned these immediately. Seem very cheaply made. I knew I would never want to wear them."
2.0,Said black background but it’s navy
2.0,Cheap quality and tear easily. Took past the expected time to receive ... Over 3 weeks
2.0,I know I'm short but this would be too long if you were close to 6' tall
2.0,couldn't open them no matter how hard I tried. Had to return them.
2.0,"Can't wear accept for rolled up sleeves, button placement is terrible, and itchy feeling. Good color and design but still crap for a hefty price don't buy."
2.0,"There are big holes where pockets should be, but there aren’t any pockets, so I guess I’ll have to sew these brand new pants."
2.0,"I liked the shirts, then discovered when wearing they rolled up at the waistband, and after washing the elastic started fraying."
2.0,It didn't blow up
2.0,"Style cute, fits fine, but fabric unbearably scratchy w no way to soften"
2.0,"Very cheap and thin material, but is super cute"
2.0,"not for me, gives a wide look when worn, makes you appear larger than you really are. wish I ordered a smaller size I guess, pretty colors and silky material though. will probably donate so someone can wear it bc it is pretty"
2.0,These are great glasses if you want light weight floating glasses. If your a very active person I would stay away as they break at the hinge very easily. I broke a pair and just figured I was to rough on them ordered another pair and almost immediately broke the second pair enough of that. I emailed the company both times and heard nothing but crickets
2.0,"i’ve been able to wear one of them without a problem and like it a lot, but the other one is completely stuck together. i’ve tried using pliers, rubber gloves, etc. and it still will not unscrew. if it wasn’t defective i would have given a higher rating"
2.0,"Beware of how small these run.  I ordered a medium, as that is usually my normal shirt size.  I usually order a size up when ordering from here, but the shirt looked like it was a looser fit.  Wrong!  I could barely move my arms up and down, as the shirt was super tight across my chest (I'm a 36B).  Had to return.  Shame, because it's a beautiful shirt."
2.0,Lens pops out constantly. We've had them for literally a week and most of that time has been in a case so minimal usage.  It won't be long before we lose a lens or it pops out and someone steps on it before we get it.
2.0,Good for Game Day!!!
2.0,Super uncomfortable. You can’t keep them on for long. The metal part on the nose is very heavy.
2.0,Beautiful looking socks but were not even close to the size I ordered
2.0,"It fits fine, but the fabric is weird. Not what I expected at all. The red is like a cheap red. The dress is made of some weird cheap fabric, it's shiny, like nightgown material? Shiny knit fabric. I am keeping it but it's not what I was expecting."
2.0,I really wanted to like this dress. It came in the typical white amazon packaging and upon opening the package the quality is so bad. I saw this dress on a certain Instagram amazon influencer and thought it would be a good purchase. BOY WAS I WRONG. Terrible quality which is unfortunate because the price is higher than it should be. I returned the product and received a refund. Don’t be fooled by positive reviews the quality is extremely thin and dress does not fit my body. I’m 5’7 145lbs (typically most things look great) but this made me look like a rectangle with no curves.
2.0,Super cheap feeling and very lightweight and smallish. Was expecting more.
2.0,They broke after a short time wearing them during the rehearsal dinner
2.0,"Not sure if its the brand or just the product type in general, but I bought a pair and they hurt my feet. Even sitting down at work, they were uncomfortable. I threw them in the trash the same day. gave it 2 stars because the packaging looked good, too bad the product sucked."
2.0,The dress was very pretty.  I wear a size 2X and read reviews that said the dress ran small so I ordered a 4X and it was still way too small.
2.0,The material is weird and you can see straight through the dress. Very cheap looking and I’m most likely returning. I’m sad because it looks so cute online.
2.0,It doen't really look like the picture. Super disappointed
2.0,Tried these on everyone in my family and the hat is just too small needs to be a little deeper to fit. Had to attach a string to keep them on our heads.
2.0,"Got XL based on size chart which is 2 sizes up than what I normally wear! It did fit around my body and was made very well, but the sleeves were huge and the neckline is so low, there definitely would have been a wardrobe malfunction... I’ll be returning it."
2.0,The top was smaller than the shorts
2.0,This is actually the third pair of these that I ordered. The first two pairs worked great so I gave one to a friend of mine. I decided to get myself another pair to replace the pair that I had given away. This pair must’ve been defective.<br />Wore them out on a short 3 mile hike with wet leaves as it had rained last night. As you can see by the pictures when I came home and took them off they were pretty soaked right through.
2.0,Inside zipper broke after a couple weeks.  If they put in quality zippers it would be well worth the money.
2.0,I bought this set to wear with a gold tiara. However it didn't match. The color is not a true gold as it appears. Looks more like silver rhinestones on a hint of gold medal.
2.0,The product is cheap. The heart was not centered and it was only half sown on the bottom.
2.0,Nice quality.. But the stone is not dark green=/ way lighter than the pic!!
2.0,"It's a very cute swimsuit, but beware. Online it is labeled as 3 to 6 months and it is very clearly tagged as a 6 month swimsuit. I had to return it because it was too large for my daughter."
2.0,The dress is nice.  The straps and the back strap are too big.
2.0,"Disappointing to get this from Capezio, which is supposed to be a pretty high-end, ""known"" brand.  Neckline didn't survive first wearing without extensive unraveling at the neckline, and that is with absolutely zero tugging or hijinks from daughter wearing it.  Just poorly sewn straight out of the gate.  Good stretch, good price point compared to the usual overly marked-up ballet retailers.  But crappy basic hemming."
2.0,I would have given 1 1/2 stars but you can't do half because I was really disappointed with these socks because I opened the package and multiple socks had holes in the top before they were even warn. I am very unhappy.
2.0,Ordered one size up because I wanted it to baggy.  It was so small
2.0,I bought this watch for my father and it's so disappointing that it just stops running all the time even though it was cheap it wasn't worth the money
2.0,Mothers dress size is even smaller though I took a larger size
2.0,"I ordered a large, I'm 5'9&#34; and a 36C and it's very tight around my shoulders and doesn't come close to covering my chest. The sleeves are not baggy like shown. Most likely will give it away."
2.0,Product feels extremely cheap. Doesn't even wrap around one of my thighs. Will be returning.
2.0,Very cute shirt.  I actually ordered 2.  This one came with a hole in the seam on the left side down near the tag.  It looks almost like it was cut?  The first one was perfect but I feel like the quality in the second one was a lot less.  I'm not going through the hasle of returning it when I can just sew it up but the seam should have come solid.
2.0,Extremely cute but the fabric got cot and then tore at the dress so now I have lines from missing threads which ruins the dress. If the dress was a different material I think it would make the dress perfect.
2.0,"First off, these overalls are super cute! Sadly there are very short in the torso/higher waisted. So definitely not for me who has a long torso even thought I'm 5'3. I ordered a xxl, and it fit comfortably. I usually wear an xl pants. Anyway, I ended up returning them do the fact I couldn't properly stand up. Btw, the overalls have adjustable straps and the longest setting was still too short!"
2.0,"Eh, just ok, they broke"
2.0,"The print looks ok, but the cloth is really poor quality, I'm not really peaky but i think is a $7 to $10 dlls value. or less."
2.0,Se quebro al dia siguiente
2.0,"I own a number of reproductive vintage dresses and although this dress looks like it could be, the fabric is lacking. I was disappointed as the print was so cute. I had to return. Like a number of previous reviewers stated, once wearing the dress, it fits okay here but it's too big there. And again, the fabric is no bueno."
2.0,"This dress was to large, I am 5'4 and weight around 115, the dress also took forever (like 1 month) to get here, I ended up returning today and shipping was $30 so before you buy just make sure you know that if it doesn't fit you or you're displease you will be the one to pay a return the return cost and can range around what I paid.<br /><br />The dress felt loose and I was dragging it on the floor when I walked. I used it for 5 minutes and decided to change because the dress just felt huge on me, I thought it would have a ""slimmer"" look :(<br /><br />2 stars for how nice the color was, -3 stars because of return cost, how long it was, and how big it felt"
2.0,"Only one item. This name, pucture n price point is deceiving. You only get trunks for ur child."
2.0,Gold color doesnt match my other gold rings.
2.0,"These pants took even longer than the expected delivery date to arrive (which was over a month). They are made of extremely cheap material, buttons, and zippers. When I walk, they're so LOUD. They're like plastic pants, not anything close to faux leather. It literally sounds like it's pouring rain when I walk. They are very uncomfortable - from the material, to the placements and roughness of the details, to sitting down, to the stretch - everything. They are not form fitting AT ALL. They have this hideous sheen to it. I will NOT be wearing this. I am hoping for a refund because I am very unhappy. I waited all this time for this......<br />I HIGHLY recommend NOT to purchase this item. They do not fit, or look, like the photo. You will be VERY disappointed if you disregard this review and end up buying them."
2.0,"Too low cut for my taste, at least when I have it on.  It looks fine in the pictures, but if you're busty it makes you look even more so.  I sent it back."
2.0,After using for about 2 weeks 2 of the grommets have fallen off.
2.0,"the quality of materials was not bad. the fit was awful. i am a size 0 so i ordered a size bigger thinking i could hem it or take it in, but that was not the case. the shoulder straps didnt even go over my slim shoulders and the breast of the dress fits more on your throat. i was mislead by the photo and the other reviews on this website. i will be returning my order! i would not recommend this dress unless your tits are literally oozing out of your neck..."
2.0,The dress was not fit to my body at all.... runs small and to much padding in the breast area making... it was not flattering at all
2.0,The material and quality of this dress is cheap.  Reminds me of something at Forever21.
2.0,"The necklace is nice and shiny but the product is wayyy too big which is a big throw off for me, i personally like big jewelry but this necklace is just to big to the point that it makes it look fake, if it was smaller it would be perfect"
2.0,"The dress looks just as it does in the picture, but the fabric is very thin and when you put it on it feels very cheap. Would not recommend buying."
2.0,The  chain is tangled with small knots and cannot be untangled. Please advise.
2.0,This lingerie was not very stretchy as per the usual fishnet stuff. The white was awfully yellowed and I am overall unimpressed with this particular set.
2.0,Broke working 30 minutes of putting it on. Metal is scratchy around the neck.
2.0,"Awful fabric, pretty but my kiddo won’t wear it due to the uncomfortable fabric."
2.0,These run way smaller than most brands. Unfortunately I discovered that after washing them one time before use.
2.0,"So I wear XS/S… I am very petite, but I lovvvvvveeee oversized sweaters so I ordered an XL… and it fit too small??? It’s soft and cute, but it’s also not worth it because it’s so freaking small. Is this like a child’s sweater? Like it fits fine, it does fit a little weird, like the arms are fine and everything but the waistband is kinda funky… not happy with it tbh"
2.0,"The satin is great, bit the hole is misshaped and very small. I wiuld not buy it again!"
2.0,"Well, it definitely isn't turquoise like the picture. It is more opal like the description.<br />I'm disappointed bc I really wanted the turquoise, but it is what it is. I passed over so many opal ones to get the turquoise one, but oh well.<br />I'll still wear them. They're not ugly. It's just not what I was hoping for and excited to get."
2.0,"After reading the reviews, I expected more."
2.0,Way smaller than you might think
2.0,Nice vest but runs extremely small.  Bought a 2xl for my husband and had to return as it fit more like a large.
2.0,The seam was in a strange place on the thigh area which made it too tight on the thighs but fit well everywhere else.
2.0,Does not say ESSENTIALS FEAR OF GOD.
2.0,"The color was not Red, and after being used 4 times, it started to peel and had holes. Would not recommend unless you are just using it around the house. Not restaurant quality 🤦‍♀️"
2.0,"Was very excited about these at first but after wearing them twice and having to keep push the backing over and over to keep them in<br />place even with the rubber stopper piece on the back , I was bummed because they are cute but just to much of a pain to keep having to<br />readjust over and over again to make sure they are sitting on my ear correctly."
2.0,"Ordered 2 sizes larger than my regular size (normally wear medium, ordered XL). Fit good, material not very good quality."
2.0,These are so cute but the quality is low. It was fraying at the top.
2.0,"Ordered a large, fits more like a small medium"
2.0,Looks better in photo
2.0,I kinda don't like it I want my money back
2.0,toes cannot touch the ground - this is not good when you are learning to walk. Is very important to stand on (all) your feet.
2.0,I like the shirt but it was way short. So I can only wear it with high waisted skirts.
2.0,Definitely very short. I’m only 5’2” and the large was not a crop top but too short to wear as a regular shirt.
2.0,The piece is very small.
2.0,"Decent quality, just hard to keep in"
2.0,Came in for clearly a very petite woman when I ordered a 38C. I couldn't even try it on. I'd guess it would fit a 30A or B.
2.0,"I like that it comes with a ""filter"" so that is helpful. However, the bacon strips aren't clear. People have to stand super close to you to see they are strips of bacon. If you are standing that close then a mask isn't enough for me. The straps are adjustable (bonus) but they are starting to twist and bunch up from use. The nose piece wiring is already shot. It's just not a GREAT mask."
2.0,"Cute, but does not fit like the picture shown and is more white than see thru off white.  Sleeves are tight also.  Honestly for the price it works but not what was expected at all."
2.0,The only piece that fit me  was the thong. Totally misleading in sizes.
2.0,Very pretty but partially covered the photo lense and needed to be cut to fit
2.0,Great way to stay organized when you are traveling and need easy access.
2.0,"One foot is larger than the other, very loose and hard to keep on."
2.0,"It was labeled the correct size, but was actually a size smaller.  Other than that it was fine."
2.0,Had to be returned. Ran small
2.0,dont like the way they fit
2.0,"Unfortunately, the grippers really don't grip very well & the sock slip around. I returned them."
2.0,This is sized smaller. I had to return..order a size up
2.0,"Beautiful, but very noise! Can't really use it."
2.0,Pants is way too short I'm 5ft 4 123  lbs and got a size small . waist fits great but length of pants needs a lot of adjustment . I would have returned it but I have no time to go through the process  so ill most likely throw it in the grabage . Waste of money. Please put measurements of Inseam of pants and waist size so that people know what they are buying . The color of the pants also doesnt match picture shown. I got a lighter blue than whats shown.
2.0,Stem too large.
2.0,Holes in toe area emerging after just a few wears. Would not recommend or buy again
2.0,Very clingy order a size up
2.0,"Very small and light, including the engraving. Should have looked for more detailed description"
2.0,Very cheap looking like i could have came from dollar store
2.0,I really liked this bracelet but it broke twice and even superglue wouldn't fix it.
2.0,It was really small and tight and just fit weird.
2.0,"Looks great but snags super easily.  After one day at school, it was a wreck."
2.0,"The bottoms are way too small, even though I used the size guidelines before ordering. The top is constrictively tight around the rib cage (I do have a large rib cage, though) and loose in the shoulders and bust. I can't wear it. The overall quality seems fine, and it looks as pictured, just doesn't fit me."
2.0,They were a good size and I liked them but they broke in Two by simply cleaning them. Flimsy.
2.0,"5'4"", 160lbs, M size;<br />fits perfect."
2.0,Very thin material compared to other brands I’ve gotten.  Loose fitting too.  Got my average size 8 yr old an XS because he likes them tight and these are loose.
2.0,"So, I would have loved this but the material is so clingy. It fits loosely but as you move shows everything. I bought the light gray, maybe the black won't show as much of my body. I am 5'7&#34; and I loved the length, reached my feet!"
2.0,Very cute but broke the second time I wore it.
2.0,"We had issues with the product quality, but the seller addressed it timely and is in the process of issuing a replacement.  Thank you."
2.0,"For the price, it's ok.  The &#34;gems&#34; around the iris are out of alignment.  Not interested in buying from this seller again."
2.0,Nice enough looking. However the post of one earring snapped off while trying to remove the back. Didn’t even attempt the other one. Sent back the same day. Very pretty though.
2.0,"Fits well in the waist, but there isn't any butt room so they ride down in the back in an uncomfortable manner."
2.0,"The view under water is much better than the other pair I bought with curved lens. Seem to fog up less than the other pair, but I have a small head for an adult and these are just too big and leak water."
2.0,Not as wide as I hoped they’d be and they don’t stretch much
2.0,This item fits not right and too big. I would like to return it.
2.0,thin tie very pretty
2.0,"It looks like I've entered a wet t-shirt contest when I wear this. Not only that, the brand sent to me is NOT modchok, but something called...styledome? This is NOTHING like the product shown. It's also of incredibly cheap quality and I can hear the sewing come undone when I put this on or take it off. This is going back."
2.0,"I purchased this bag a few months ago. Arrived early in the mail. Looked just like the picture. Very roomy. I love dragonflies and was so happy to show this off. I have been carrying as my every day purse. Was very happy in the beginning. However, today I noticed that in all four places that the straps connect to the outside of the bag, it is tearing. Does not look like it will last much longer and does not look like it can be repaired. Started out very happy, now very disappointed."
2.0,This did not come with the clasp or buckle. It is just the band which is ok but it’s too short. The length fits barely around a medium sized wrist.
2.0,I would like to start this by saying that I could have received a faulty unit.<br /><br />The claps wouldn't stay closed and the connectors kept disconnecting from the watch.<br />In the end I sent it back after trying to work with it for several days.<br /><br />If they can fix these problems it will be a great replacement. Otherwise enter with a little caution.
2.0,The photo is deceiving.  My wife if around 5'7&#34; and the socks do not go above the knee.
2.0,The lower straps were to large
2.0,"Absolutely adorable dress. Fit me really well in the body but wayyy too short. I'm 5'10 and 155lbs. My lady bits were literally hanging out!!! Total bummer. I ordered a medium, going to try a large. Hopefully it'll long enough in the crotch<br /><br />Update: I ended up ordering the large, much looser of a fit which I didn't mind but again it was way too short in the crotch. I wore it out in Vegas, because Vegas, but I was tugging at it all night long and I guarantee I accidentally flashed a few people. Really unfortunate because I love the dress, the top part didn't bother me as other reviews had said, it fits on the top exactly as you would expect it to, it's just slit right in the crotch and if you have any hips at all it just spreads the slit :/ pretty crappy"
2.0,This was poorly made and  I ended up returning it.
2.0,"Flimsy,not worth the price. And the material is smelly. Don't bother"
2.0,Much smaller than expected.  Never received the mother of pearl clasp opener.  Not worth the money.
2.0,"It's way too hard to fit properly into clothing that's sized as small, medium or large. There's too much room for error and it's such a waste of time to have to return items that don't fit. Which, I am going to do. These shorts fit a tad loose at first then after 5 minutes they were falling off of me! Weird enough that even though they were big they still seemed to flatten my figure rather than look good on. Just because there are rounded seams above the pockets doesn't mean they will enhance your figure... Bizarre fit."
2.0,Got this for a Halloween Elf Costume.  The bangs hang clear over the forehead and totally flat on top.  Wasn't what I had hoped it to be.
2.0,"Did not fit, gaped in the chest and arm pit area. Cheap fabric, but nice color. I had friends try it on since I was not going to keep it and it did not flatter three very different body types."
2.0,The band did not come with a buckle and it is shorter than the fit bit large band.
2.0,"I loved these rings and I had them on for a week straight, in my defense the easiest way to untangle them was when they where on my hands, they told that whole week to untangle then one of the rings fell off, I didn't think much of it and just fixed it (I make earrings so I had extra parts to help) then everything just fell apart, the charms, the extra chains, everything, I tried to put them back together but I had to untangle them and I wasn't going to start a two week project I probably wouldn't be able to complete, so on top of me not being able to use them the right way (since they where tangled) and them breaking this is a solid two stars nothing more nothing less"
2.0,A lot shorter than it looks in the picture
2.0,Badly done. Can not read the print!
2.0,I like the style and fit of these but they started unraveling by the 2nd time I wore them. I have 1 pair left that hasn't come apart.
2.0,"They see through. Yes, they are warm but when you bend over you can see through them.<br />I won’t leave the house with them on."
2.0,At first it looked well made but it broke about 3 weeks after I started wearing it. Not well made at all.
2.0,Really didn't see an improvement...my wife and I wear wool socks when it is really cold here and they perform much better than the 35 below socks. Glove liners were just ok..wouldn't recommend these.
2.0,Would slip off my glasses and not hold them.
2.0,This ran big as well.
2.0,"Lasted two gentle washes before serious fading of text and pilling of fabric, looks like it's been worn every day for a month. Fun item but wasn't worth the cost, cheap fabric and screening."
2.0,Not a very good quality look. We're trying to return this product.
2.0,"They were to small and not wide enough. Need to offer wider sizes. Also in the picture they look really shiny, but when I got them they were very dull, not shiny at all."
2.0,Was to small sucked cause I loved the color
2.0,"yet another ""unisex"" item that only works if you're under 5'7"" as a male. i need UV protection from wrists to shoulder these stop at just above the elbow and would be uncomfortable/unwearable if they were a washing or two away from being any tighter. they'd work in a pinch but i won't be using them. these would probably work well enough, if i were female or asian. as i am not, i'm not part of the ""one size fits all/most"" crowd. so i can chalk it up to caveat emptor."
2.0,Nice sweater but shrunk in wash and dry!  Still fits but about 4 inches shorts that the original length.
2.0,It's suppose to fit tight and it doesn't I even went down to an xs still doesn't fit tight (compression not true).
2.0,These smell strongly of moth balls - even after washing several times. Pretty gross.
2.0,"En el paquete llegó uno de los 4 llaveros con el aro quebrado, por donde se sujeta a la cadena."
2.0,Not at all as pictured. Loose in the sleeves longer and slightly hanging in the back- not. I checked the sizing chart and purchased accordingly. When I received the material had a rough texture to it. From the information given I was expecting a Linen shirt which it definitely did not have a linen feel.  Although I can get the blouse on it is tight around the arms and shoulders and very hard to remove.
2.0,Wasnt a fan of the top flared out a little to much for me
2.0,"Too large, it looks boho cute in the picture but ends up just looking like a dowdy funeral dress."
2.0,"1–1st problem is it’s soooo short. I didn’t know it was a crop top. But it’s hardly even a crop top bc It’s >2” shorter than an average crop top!!! It doesn’t even come past ribs.<br />2–2nd issue is the seam at the back is kinda trash.<br />Like they designed it to be edgy but it looks cheap because  it should be Inside out—but isn’t. All the other seams like that are on the inside except this one.<br />Maybe it’s damaged??<br /><br />3rd - The pattern is cool and quite opaque for a white base—but the length of shirt’s front/back and the length of the arms are all very, Very, VERY short.<br /><br />4- if it fit adult bodies, it might be comfy. It’s sorta child sized or doll sized for length.<br /><br />1.5 star rounded up to 2 stars ⭐️ ⭐️<br />I got a medium. I usually wear a small or a medium at 5’6” ~135-140lbs<br /><br />If it was longer in arms/ length, it would be 4stars. The seam on outside takes it down from 5.<br /><br />It’s unable to be worn like this."
2.0,The picture is not as bright as it appears when u purchasing it. Instead it is faded and not no where near as glossy or beautifully brighten as the advertisement
2.0,Nice shirts but fit too tight. On top and very loose on the bottom
2.0,"Palm area is small/short, the wrist is big. Fit is not good."
2.0,I thought this was the cutest shirt when I saw it! I knew it would be perfect for my workouts. And so I ordered it. It was going well until I put it on! I gushed at it forever until I raised my arms! My heart just sanked! The shirt rose up to my breast area and stayed there until I pulled it down. I couldn't even scratch my head without it raising up! I wanted this shirt to be that shirt and now my heart is sadden. If only the bottom would have been a tinch longer. I found that if I tuck it under my sports bra its good for a minute. Whats sad is I can't even wear it under another shirt because it will ride up leaving me looking goofy
2.0,Definitely not what I expected the stone is so small and you can't even see them unless you have a magnifying glass and the color is very very pale
2.0,The handkerchief came in a baggie. There is no way I can give it to my father without a box.  Sooooo disappointed!!!
2.0,Fits on the bust rather than below. Could work but a bit distracting. Returned.
2.0,"If you're looking for a high quality product, spend a little more and purchase one from a big brand. These are thin and will fray easily. I purchased these in the beige color to cover up my forearm tattoos and they are hardly opaque enough to serve that purpose."
2.0,Looks cheap and took a long time to arrive. Do not recommend.
2.0,I’m the description didn’t said it was extra large size.
2.0,"I ordered this because of all the wonderful reviews on it!  It is apparent to me now that many were stretching the truth on their reviews of this. So to start with I have over 10 years experience with corsets. They do work. It takes time and making sure the one you get is sized correctly for you. As soon as I put this on I noticed my belly part sticking out. And I don't have a big belly anymore! I am so mad I did not return it then because a good corset will not let that happen. I do not mean to be ugly but I honestly really think an ace bandage will work better than this. A few weeks later two of the hooks bent. I was using pliers to try and fix them but they were so weak they kept bending. I contacted the seller and asked for a refund and I never even got a reply! How rude! That is what you are dealing with! I guess many would say that you should of known by the price what you were getting. I guess they would be right!<br /><br />What really blows me away is that some of the reviewers have compared this to the squeem. That is like comparing a BMW to a scooter. This is nothing like the squeem!  For those of you unfamiliar with the squeem it came out about 10 years ago and was the first to use stretch material as a corset. I wore mine for over 4 years everyday before it finally wore out. As word spread how effective they were the price went up through the roof. I am not sure if the quality is still as good.<br /><br />The reason I give this two stars is because I think this would be a inexpensive way to find out if you are a candidate for a corset. My girlfriend noticed my new corset I had ordered after this one. She wore this one with the bent hooks for two hours and said no way. I told her then do not waste your money on a corset then because this is a want to be corset! A real one will be much stiffer! ( but in my opinion a tad bit more comfortable)<br /><br />The good news is I did find one on Amazon that helped me lose over 3 inches and to my surprise it also helped me with my figure. It was also not too expensive and reminded me of the squeem!<br /><br />So if you are looking at the picture the seller has with this, then do not be fooled. This will not do that unless that is what you already look like!  Anytime I write a review that is not 5 stars I receive no helpful votes. But my honest opinion is this product will do nothing for you but waste your time and effort! This corset is just too stretchy to do any good!  I hope that helps! ray333ray2001@yahoo.com"
2.0,Such a beautiful piece but one try and it was loose. Had to return it. Wish it had been made with better stretch material which remains even when worn many times.
2.0,Beautiful Color good fit but cheap thin fabric.  It will only serve as a sleep garment or house dress.
2.0,I love the necklace and the quality is great. Why I gave 2 stars is the advertising is a bit misleading. I thought a bracelet came with this purchase do to the picture of a bracelet too.
2.0,The top was too loose and sloppy looking on me but it could have been the color on me too. I returned the item.
2.0,"Not impressed with the quality, larger than the regular aviator sunglasses."
2.0,The filigree is pretty but we left those things under a bright light for a day and a half. Nothing. It was supposed to be a cool gift for 2 young girls. Now we have to get something else. Total waste.
2.0,"Ordered the animal print for my daughter's &#34;puppy&#34; themed birthday party, received the ice cream cone print. She was pretty bummed.<br /><br />Apart from receiving the wrong item (and not having the time to get a new one) - the item itself is actually fairly nice quality. The material is soft and spandex like, and my daughter likes twirling in it.<br /><br />Had I received the right dress - this was totally have been a great product for me."
2.0,Just ok late delivery very disappointing it came after promised delivery time almost a month later . The funeral can and gone I’m so upset and it looks kind of cheap smh
2.0,Not large enough to even see when worn
2.0,Fabric is cheap and pattern is just on surface. Tight across the chest and I ordered a size up.
2.0,"I ordered this pajama set and a shorty nightgown from the same company.  I got the nightgown in a large and this set in a medium.  The large night was much too tight on me, and this medium set is a little big.  So the company has a problem with sizing.  This pajama set is pretty comfortable but the top is EXTREMELY thin, to the point of being able to see through it.  It hides nothing.  That's not really the look I want in my jammies."
2.0,"There's are pretty but after one day of wearing them, my ears were stained orange. Haven't worn them since."
2.0,"Nice dress for the price. I'm 5'4, 130 and ordered M it was tight. I would have ordered a size up to a L instead. I'm curvy and don't mind showing my curves, but this dress just snuggled my curves a little to much."
2.0,"Material very slick...slides all over the place, no grip especially when driving!"
2.0,I always try to give honest reviews because I read reviews before I purchase many things. I bought these for my 10 year old daughter... they are super cute and comfortable... but quality was NOT good.  Today is Dec 11th.  We got these in mid October...  the front of both shoes now has a mouth. Now... I will admit my daughter wore them to school ALOT and she is not easy on shoes but they now look like they are 3 years old.
2.0,It wasn’t tapered at the waist like in the picture.  It kind of ballooned out.
2.0,"The dress is cute and fits as expected, but it is very clearly poorly made. The clasp broke as I was trying it on for the first time and tried to tighten the straps. The fabric is pretty flimsy as well."
2.0,"Fabric wasn't nice as I would have liked.  Sometimes polyester is made to emulate natural fabrics, but this is not one of them.  The print is nice.  It's a snug fit."
2.0,"I would NOT recommend these iWatchbands. The part  that helps secure the band to the watch, there is a small spring inside which kept coming falling out, making it impossible for to put the spring back to hook it to the watch. Without the spring, the watch band cannot stay secured on the watch."
2.0,I'm not happy Amazon/ Pembrook with the way my socks were delivered. No envelope or anything just on this see through Ziploc baggie. Good this everyone was honest and didn't help themselves to my socks. I think I'll be more careful next time who I order from.
2.0,"Really loved these shorts but just two months after buying them, the large zipper in the back is completely jammed. I used that to bring my phone on runs and now I can’t because the other two pockets are too small. I would’ve highly recommended them otherwise but I bought them for the three pockets (I use the other two for a house key and a bottle of mace since we have lots of coyotes and bears in our area). I tried exchanging them but I am a few weeks past the return window. It’s too bad because otherwise I would’ve recommended them."
2.0,I love how they feel and look but they are to small for me. I should have went up at least one size if not two.
2.0,"Have you ever looked at the reviews on a product that you have and wondered why everyone else hated it but you loved yours and had no problems with it? I think that is what the other reviewers of this watch are going to think when they see my review. First off, the watch arrived in a  ziploc bag with NO instructions.  There was not even a link to a website with that had the instructions. I could not get the functions of the watch to work because i had no instructions so i had a difficult time figuring out how to make it work.<br /><br />  I can say is that the watch fits kinda snug, it seems to be made more for kids than adults.  I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions. I received no compensation for this review and I am not required to give a positive review. I am also not associated with the seller in any way."
2.0,Felt tight on my wrist and the material was stiff. Wore it for about three days before switching to a different band.
2.0,"Product is cute and looks like the picture. The only issue I had with it was I ordered the medium and they sent me a small so becareful there since these do run on the small side. I'd suggest ordering a size larger than your regular. As well the bottoms are ""cheeky"" so if that's not your thing I'd skip this one."
2.0,"I bought two sizes too small for maximal control.  Unfortunately, there was no control at all:  all measurements with/without the garment were exactly the same.  Save money and buy a nice slip that will do the same."
2.0,"Great value...packed well. Did arrive with scuffs around the tray. Upon setup, also notice that one of the rubber feet was missing."
2.0,Much more pale color in person than as displayed in picture. False advertising. And the bag is much more affordable when purchased from original seller. But of course everyone has to make a profit.
2.0,"I love snakes, I had a similar pair I wore in my tragus piercings. They broke, so I bought these. THIS PAIR TURNED MY EARS GREEN!!!!!!! I'm so disappointed"
2.0,"Cons: Sizing is extremely smaller then what's described and doesn't follow U.S. sizing standards. The weight of fabric, fabric, and stitching, could improve. Pros: Design and Style."
2.0,Received these 4 days ago and half of them did not work but I notice when I dropped one it started working. The ones that didn't work I tapped each side of the finger light on a hard surface or snapped the rubber band. After doing this I only have two that wont work right.
2.0,Awkward! Very confusing and didn't look like the photos on the model. Looks more like a weird misshappened poncho than a blazer. Returned.
2.0,This dress was large enough in length and body to tie the knot as on the model.  But its too small to fall off shoulder.  Plus material is super thin so underwear will show.
2.0,The metal is nice the silicone it comes with gets messed up easy and there aren’t any extras
2.0,This dress will look good on a very small non curvy girl like pictured. I'm only a size 10 but when the sash is tied around my small waist it just bunches up there and doesn't lay flat. Therefore there is not any scrunching. The scrunching is only made by the tie sash and how it drapes. That doesn't work for my coke bottle figure. The fabric is good and it's a very interesting style but won't work on every body. Not mine.
2.0,"I was hoping it'd be a little baggier and wouldn't cling to my thighs. I have wide hips/big butt/thicc thighs and am pear-shaped so thats likely why. I think the fabric could be a little more structured because it was pretty flimsy. To be fair its cheap clothing and so you can expect thin polyester.<br />The color of red is also not quite as shown its a lighter red in person rather than a deep red.<br />The belt that came with it has a hard time staying put and rides up the back because there are only 2 belt loops on the sides (pictured).<br /><br />I would only recommend this if you don't mind something that is thinner/flimsy and needing to be altered or messed with in some way.<br /><br />I could probably make it work but it's probably not worth it if I don't feel 100% comfortable in it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Lightweight<br />- Affordable<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Innacurate color (lighter red, not dark)<br />- Missing belt loop<br />- Flimsy"
2.0,Length is good. Tummy control is NOT a feature they should advertise
2.0,After only using the pouch for a couple weeks the decorative bow located on the flap completely fell off and is now missing. Phone fit nicely... but cannot say it is put together that well.
2.0,it's not good quality at all
2.0,"I bought these twice in bigger sizes and still had to give the Large to my 12 year old (i'm 5'7'', 140 lb and usually wear a medium). They are decent shirts, just really small. And not just tight, they aren't stretchy enough to be comfortably tight. I gave two stars because the quality is decent but they just don't fit."
2.0,"It's a nice looking purse with quite a bit of room but it did not last. It smelled like burning plastic, started to peel and eventually the strap fell apart."
2.0,Very cute and fit well.  Very thin material
2.0,"If I had used it right when I bought it, I would have been able to return.  But it didn’t rain until 5 months later so I missed the return date.  The black button on the top broke off, strap starting to rip, hard to fit back into its bag.  Such a shame because it’s very compact.  Bought an umbrella for $8 at TJ Maxx which is more durable.  Cute color though."
2.0,It is very unflattering.  Makes me look twice as heavy.
2.0,The fabric didn't feel that great either. I personally prefer cotton for its absorption.
2.0,the item received was not the same as the photo. We received a red tee shirt not a longer gray sleep shirt. The logo was the same. It also was shipped from China and took weeks to get here
2.0,"I did not like the feel of the material, and it came all wrinkled, so I returned it.  Too many other fabrics out there that dont wrinkle so quickly."
2.0,"Bought this for my daughter to wear during her part in a Christmas play. It was about 3 sizes too big, had way too much tule, and we just didn't like the quality/look of it at all. Once the Christmas play got closer and we took it out of the package, it was too late to return and has sat in my daughter's closet untouched since."
2.0,Fit is really small. I ordered two sizes up and it’s still too small for my son.
2.0,Crappie matterial
2.0,I purchased this watch for my son in May and it broke in July.  Is it covered by warranty?
2.0,"the top does not fit.. this is now the SECOND pair I purchased for Christmas Presents, and neither one fits..... the sizing is off."
2.0,Did not fit as promised
2.0,Not quite what was pictured. The elephants are upside down on the hat. Post came from China
2.0,"It is a bit tight around the chest but it’s long for a blouse, it’s more like a tunic. I ordered M. Returning."
2.0,Too tight across the stomach
2.0,Was delivered broken
2.0,"cheap fabric, the sleeves don't stay up, and the sleeves are too long. The length is too short and it doesn't cover your private area or butt. The thing that wraps around you has a corest pattern and it doesn't look so flattering either."
2.0,"The belt isn’t made of very good material, it started peeling as soon as I slid the buckle around it. I wouldn’t recommend this belt. I’d say to spend a little more money on a better belt that will look nice for longer. Also it was far too big, my waist is 33 in."
2.0,Very sad about these. Definitely pay a little extra and buy the brand name Salt waters these just aren’t holding up. The Velcro isn’t a good idea.... they come off their ankles after only a few minutes of walking in them. Seriously a pain. I’m hoping I can return them.
2.0,The piece that holds the band pin to the watch just broke off now the watch is unable to attach the band. Watch although working is useless since it cannot be worn. The wood grain is weak.
2.0,Fits too tight for this size.
2.0,It was a little bit too large but it was pretty thank you
2.0,"hard to tell from the photos but it is a little tapered and the top isn't straight. I was looking for a squared top hat, had to return this. The material is also cheap looking but you get what you pay for."
2.0,"Really pretty set but came tarnished. Wouldn't come clean, had to find other jewelry for a wedding."
2.0,"So my daughters party is in a little over a week and is obsessed with Dinosaurs so of course thats her theme. I bought these for the gift bags, and when I received they were nicely packaged the bracelets, key chains tattoos and rings were all in good shape, but when I went to test the stamps, almost ALL of them are dried out. I think all but 2 or 3 are dried out and you can barely see it on skin or paper. I would have loved to give 5 stars but the stamps, that the kids would have probably used most, barely work."
2.0,It says 6x but fits like a 4x
2.0,The belt does its job. Good quality build. Just lacks all style. The belt material is like a thick seatbelt with grooves.
2.0,I had a simple pair of these shoes which this company stopped making. I ordered these but they're really for climbing the alps or trekking through a dangerous wilderness.  VERY complicated shoe and heavy for just normal walking.  But I am guessing great for hiking.
2.0,I loved the glasses and the way they looked but they came with a bent frame so be sure and check that
2.0,I like the look okay and even the feel but they are too small. I would definitely order up a size when ordering these.
2.0,people think its a crocked V-neck
2.0,I like the shirt the way it fits is perfect only problem I'm having is to of the buttons are cracked in half it's like two are .here's a picture of it
2.0,"I was at first happy with this purchase, but the tote didn't last six months before falling apart.  The handles pulled loose, and though the price was quite reasonable, it isn't worth the additional expense to have it repaired/mended, so it is in the donations bag."
2.0,"There's not much to it, it falls off and just hangs off my ear at any provocation, it's a neat idea and i could actually keep it on but it ends up hurting my ear and it doesn't really look good, too bad :("
2.0,I wanted to love this . Size is great for the person  but the box was a joke !!! It is not stamped ITALY. Last the clasp failed the magnetic test leading me to believe the clasp is plated . I need for a gift now don’t have time to shop around  lesson learned do NOT BUY GOLD ONLINE.
2.0,"The watch skips. It will go 5 seconds forward, then one second back... I’m guessing that wouldn’t be a battery issue since it’s still “working”"
2.0,Jean's! Look like they were made for a girl
2.0,very inexpensive object
2.0,Bought this because it said it had &#34;quick release pins&#34;... Actually it doesn't. It has normal watch pins making it not something that you would want to change out every few days. The band is small and the finish is rough. I guess you can't expect the world for 17 bucks but there are no quick release pins (like on the band that comes with the Samsung watch itself) so beware.
2.0,Nice shorts if you don't mind pulling them down during your workout
2.0,Very thin material not very good.
2.0,"The jacket fits relatively well. It is a little large, but I wanted to be able to wear bulkier shirts under it so that’s fine. The style is cute. The lining is thin and on the rough side; so feels very cheep. But worst of all, it has a horrible moldy, plastic type smell to it. It smelled too bad to even put in the closet, or bedroom for that matter. I have had to air it out in the entry room for the past week to even stand wearing it. The smell was so strong that the whole room smelled horrid for the first 3 days. It feels like leather, but does not smell like leather at all. Very disappointing, means I was so looking forward to having a leather jacket that smelled like leather. If I wanted a jacket that smelled like moldy plastic I could have gotten a fake leather one for half the price. Very disappointed!"
2.0,I ordered this from Blink Blink City for end of year parties for school classes.  There were several that didn't work.  Contacted the seller who said they would send out new ones immediately.  Never got them and the seller never responded to subsequent e-mails.  Disappointing!<br />The finger flashlights are fun for the kids and are a novelty item that doesn't last a long time.  The lights were different colors instead of just a white light- Very Cool.<br />Would have been happy if all of the flashlights would have worked when they arrived!
2.0,The size chart is not accurate and the items are small. Finally poor quality for the price which should have been $10-$15 not near $30.
2.0,Had to return it. It was super small.
2.0,This dress was cute but huge. I ordered a small and it was way too big. I’m 5’2 and petite.
2.0,Baby head bands did not look like the picture posted. I was too embarrassed to give them as a gift. The headbands were crushed and looked cheap. Purchased another gift. Donated the baby headbands to good will.
2.0,I am not too crazy about it. I taught it will be a little bigger and the necklace looks and feel cheap
2.0,"pro: Dress arrived on time. Dress was pure white.<br /><br />Cons: not like picture. See through, so you can barely wear undergarments. Looks like the fake version of the picture. Needs to be accessorized."
2.0,Hat is big and is loose fitting
2.0,"I got them for my son, they are much too big, and the quality sucks.  You get what you pay for.  Live and learn"
2.0,"I love this skirt, but it's almost more of a lavender or ""dirty"" pink... It's not nearly as bright as the picture... I haven't been able to find a shirt to pair with it yet because the color is so off. I will keep the skirt, and I love the skirt, just pick a different color unless you want to be tormented trying to find a shirt to go with it...."
2.0,Much smaller than an XL in AMERICA
2.0,"I love the look of these, but one of the lenses popped out for no reason the second time wearing them.  Don’t waste your money"
2.0,"Top-hem came apart after first wash what a disappointment. I like the product fits well stays on my large arms, it has no seam - tube like. On the second wash the whole tube sleeve disintegrated, whole wash was entangled in rubber type threads."
2.0,For a crop top this could be cut a little bit better. Still kinda boxy. Almost as if they just cut 5 inches or so off a regular fit button down and called it a day. The picture on the listing leads you to think the material is little thicker than it is but the material is thin. Nothing wrong with that but would be better as a regular shirt but this should be tapered a bit more on the sides.
2.0,Metal earpiece to insert in ear came bent completely flat. Does not include any back piece/ clasp
2.0,Quality is not what I expected.
2.0,"I ordered a large because the description said that should fit my size (5'5"", 115 lbs, 34A). It fits fine in the front but is really loose in the back. It's a very awkward fit and I probably won't wear it"
2.0,It's wayyyyy too small. I only rated it 2 stars because it was shipped earlier than expected.
2.0,"Check your sizing before ordering!  This was child-sized for me and wouldn't fit (I'm 5'6&#34;, average build woman).  Had to return.  Too small and too flimsy."
2.0,"The touchscreen fingers just don't work for me. I've tried on my Google Pixel and my Galaxy tablet. They seem to work better for my wife on an iphone though, but for me they are useless for smart devices... Beware. Note: I have 2 cheap $10 or less pairs of touchtip finger gloves that work absolutely great with my phone."
2.0,"This dress/top wasn't like I expected at all. Material and cut was cheaply made. Not something you would ever see in any American mall or store. Maybe a pajama top? Wasn't too small or too big, just was sewn poorly. The return and shipping fee would have cost more than the item itself. Lesson learned - you get what you pay for. The seller was gracious enough to refund 50% of the cost but there's no use in keeping it and I certainly wouldn't gift this item to anyone."
2.0,"Pretty color but runs small, sadly."
2.0,"I’m 5’4” and my daughter is 5’2” and the size small rides up in the crotch on both of us. The dress has shorts built into the lining. The chest area sits way too high. The length was just above the knees on my daughter. The overall cut was way off. It is very orange in person and not melon colored like online. We did like the color though. The V-neck cuts very low and if the chest area actually sat in the correct place, it would be difficult to wear a regular bra with this as it would show in the middle of the chest."
2.0,Ordered a size 7 but since it’s such a wide band it does not fit like a normal size 7 should. It’s a decent ring for costume jewelry otherwise. But the sizing is definitely off by probably 1.
2.0,"The bag is already falling apart. The zip’s in the front are not zipping right, they unzip is the middle of the zipper."
2.0,"The round parts of the conversion pendants are too bulky to hide and tend to make the pin/pendant protrude in an unnatural and crooked kind of way.  I will try again with another pin but I doubt that it will be better.  Unless the pin is large and clunky, it would be hard to hide these things.  I think that if you have very large pins, these might work but I'm not happy with them at all!!"
2.0,I was surprised to find that the fabric was low quality.
2.0,"Shipped on time and exactly what I ordered. However, the hinge kept popping open. I almost lost it several times so I super glued it together."
2.0,"I really wanted to like these but they are very cheaply made! The temples are not sturdy and are loose, no matter how much you tighten them! The plastic feels like recycled garbage! Sorry I don't recommend and will be returning them."
2.0,"It smelled odd, and was bent in some places. Not my favorite."
2.0,Loved the design but backpack didn't last.  Straps broke within 5 months.
2.0,I like the color & style of the band but when I receive it it was very heavy and I have small wrists. This may be good for someone with big wrist.
2.0,"I ordered these from another website, just a warning to all. I couldn't even get my foot into the shoe, way too narrow in the shoe part of the boot, but the shaft width was perfect too bad."
2.0,Way too tight. Sticks to the skin and hides nothing. Will not be buying more.
2.0,too small the size is totally off
2.0,These pants were really long wasted and had a bizarre fit. Too much fabric in the stomach area. Tight at the top of thighs. The fabric was unbelievably soft.
2.0,I didn’t care for the sweater so I retuned.
2.0,break easy
2.0,I wear an extra small and ordered a small butt after washing I couldn't even get the top on! Will be returning and ordering size medium. Otherwise the flannel is very nice and the color is wonderful.
2.0,Doesn’t seem like Tottenham quality
2.0,It was OK.  I had a better one that remained cooler longer.  This one dries out quickly and doesn't stay cool as long as another I've had.
2.0,"These are breathable as advertised, but barely come above the ankle and constantly slide down."
2.0,The dress would have been beautiful if it wasn’t sewn together so horribly. The button in the front came of in like two seconds and the material itself was bad too
2.0,"Went with torn seam.<br />Runs small, but for me it was still ok."
2.0,"These are the kind of synthetic material that will rip and pile on a single sharp object, including even the slightest imperfection in your hands (think: a really small callus). They look like the kind of tie that I expect a guy working at rental car lot, or perhaps at the local electronics store to wear. Basically, a low class tie that fits the bill for some job in which a tie is mandatory. So if your goal is to check the &#34;I have a tie&#34; box, these will do.<br /><br />But if you actually want to look decent, and definitely if you spent some money on your other clothes, don't hang a $5 tie on your neck and walk around with a cheap piece of fabric that says &#34;LOOK AT ME, A CHEAP TIE!&#34;"
2.0,The dress was great fit. But the material is horrible. Very cheap looking. I returned it. Just not for me.
2.0,"The first one I ordered was too big; according to reviews the product ran small. So, I returned it; seller was very accommodating to me & gift recipient. Note: This product appears longer on amazon web page but it is short...only covers your upper waist, makes muffin top show. Seller should state that it is short.  I may have wasted $65 on this because I decided to keep it as a 'trainer'. However I ordered a longer fitting one afterwards. Too much hassle in returning it."
2.0,too small to see any detail
2.0,Measurement descriptions not accurate
2.0,The product stated it was stainless steel but that must have only been for the bracelet because after only a week of doing day to day showers and dishes the charm faded.
2.0,Poorly assembled and arrived missing parts. Looks cool otherwise.
2.0,Eh! Not really impressed. But I'll wear it.
2.0,They run really small in the sizes. They wouldn’t even fit my 5 year old.
2.0,Shirt was wayyyyy too small
2.0,"This is wayyyyy tooooo big!!  Unless you have very large ankles, don't bother buying this!  Disappointed as it is very pretty, but unfortunately I can't wear it!  Asked for a refund and they gave me $1.00 back.  Wow......  Oh well, at least it was cheap enough to not lose sleep over!"
2.0,Just cheep
2.0,Will work as a coverup but white is completely see thru
2.0,"I got these fingerless gloves so my hands can stay warm when I type in the winter. After washing it by hand, it started to pill. My main disappointment though is that I find they are too tight to type with."
2.0,It was too large so I just passed it on to my friend. She loves it.
2.0,Lacked any support
2.0,The quality and color is very nice but the sizing is really small.
2.0,IT'S A BIT TO SMALL 📌
2.0,This dress is super cute but sadly it fit strangely. I've boughten other dresses from the company that were also a size 6 and they fit perfectly. This dress was just too small and the sleeves were extremely tight. I don't want to go up a size because I don't want it to be baggy elsewhere.
2.0,"Ran little to big and material was thin and see through.  I am 5'2, 128lbs and ordered a medium in white."
2.0,The thing fell apart when I went to put it on thw first time.  Had to tie the pearl back on. Very inconvenient. It does look like the one in the picture and it is very cute!
2.0,"These are firmer than the originals.  That would be bearable if I could just cover it with some thumbstick covers, but since the thumbstick doesn't have as much height as the originals the covers rub up against the controller."
2.0,very cheap feel and look
2.0,"Meh. It was kinda cute, but the back is kind of billowy like there's too much fabric-- but not in a cute way. More in a floppy, scrunched-up fabric way. Also, because of the tan color, my husband asked me if I got a new job as a car mechanic. I'll wear this on casual weekends where I don't have to see lots of people."
2.0,"I used the size chart and ordered an xl. When I got these dress I can’t wear it. It’s huge. Additionally, for $29.99 I expected a much better quality dress. Not impressed at all."
2.0,"#1 The liner is there, no problem, but gets in the way so no way to close it.<br />#2 The handle is uncomfortable to hold and impossible to carry on the arm to give the hands a break.<br />#3 The cat loves to scratch on it.<br />#4 It is cute just not workable."
2.0,The material is super thin and almost see through.
2.0,"Way too small for men's glasses, looked like children's glasses on his face!"
2.0,It was not at all what is pictured.
2.0,Demasiado pequeña a la talla que se anuncia
2.0,The panties fit like a large at best and the robe an xl but the bralette and shorts fit fine.
2.0,it broken right away
2.0,They’re plastic not metal. Thought they would be smaller. Uncomfortable to wear
2.0,Way too tight and hard to pull up.
2.0,The earring were not what I thought they were. The have an odd shape. These earring are not your typical hoop shape and have a flat side. If they had more of a traditional shape they would be perfect. They have great shine and sparkle. It's not worth returning once you pay for shipping.
2.0,Order for someone twice your size fits really tiny.
2.0,Overall jeans are nice but the pant legs are way too short.  Had to return with disappointment.
2.0,The liner gets messed up every time you pull your hands out. Making it difficult to put them back on.
2.0,Runs super small: couldn’t even get the bottoms over my thigh
2.0,"I really loved the pattern and it fit how I expected, though it was very long. The big issue was that there was a large hole in the back right along the waist at the seam. I’ll be returning this one."
2.0,Not what I expected the 3rd day 3 light stop working.
2.0,Way smaller than I expected. Runs 2 sizes too small since Asian sizes.
2.0,"I like that the band is breathable. It's not itchy, and the sweat doesn't get trapped under the band causing an odor.  But it keeps falling off. Not very secure."
2.0,"I don't know if I got the wrong product with a different sized label because other reviews make it seem like these shorts fit great but that was not so in my case. I knew they'd be short, but they are way too short. The fit isn't good, and I ordered true to size as instructed. The gray color and design of the shorts is nice, as pictured. The double layer is stretchy, and so is the waistband, but the design of the waistband makes it so that the inner band inside of the fabric folds in on itself, making the entire thing bend awkwardly. Also, the shorts have no pockets at all, which I was willing to look over if the fit was good, but it is not. I'm thinking maybe I got a one-off pair that was mistakenly sewn with the wrong size tag on? I don't know, but overall I had to unfortunately rate this item as I received it, and the fit just wasn't good."
2.0,Ordered my size 3xl and it was labeled a 3xl but was probably only a large at best in real life. Two stars because their customer service was great
2.0,"Cap, goggle case, and ear protectors were good. Goggles straps and design was comfortable. Only thing is under water the vision changes and is blurry. Above water vision is perfect and clear. Must be something with the lens. I have other goggles and the vision is the same above and below water. My friend ordered the same goggles and his is fine."
2.0,I have been snorkeling and diving for over 50 years and know what a mask should do. I bought these for playing around in my pool with my grandkids. They are comfortable and easy to adjust. They fail however in the reason you wear goggles under water. The cheap plastic lens made everything double vision. I can't believe the manufacturer ever swam with these it must have been a computer designer who never swam under water. Stay away from these it was impossible to concentrate on swiming when everything was double vision. Get ones with real glass.
2.0,These are two sizes too small.
2.0,Bulky and stiff. Hard to latch. I returned it.
2.0,So so big brim but not the perfect hat
2.0,In no way was this a 5x - and I did check sizing before I ordered (normally I wear a 3x)
2.0,The colors are dull and the text is sewn into the stitching so they are difficult to read. Not worth the money and time it took to ship.
2.0,"The front is cute, the back is very unflattering because it just hangs and doesn't have any contour."
2.0,"I received this watch last Thursday, really like the look and design of the watch but it doesn’t keep time , loses 15 minutes a day , contacted Burei customer service said they would refund $3.00 for the battery. Love the watch , the sad thing is I was getting ready to purchase another one but I guess I will have to look elsewhere"
2.0,Not well made. Not a warm flannel. Will be returning.
2.0,They were the correct size but somehow when walking they moved and my little one ended up losing them.
2.0,Baggy in the waist - material thick and itcy.
2.0,The material is very low quality and it does not fit well.
2.0,"Pretty, but had a horrible smell out of the package. Cheaply made and much shorter than what the picture shows. It did fit as expected size wise, I wouldn’t recommend it, if you want to wearing  with leggings or with a long tank."
2.0,These gloves came with a weird smell can’t get rid of.
2.0,"Cheap pajamas, scratchy material and I don’t expect them to last very long."
2.0,"muy delgada, la verdad ni la recomiendo"
2.0,"Arrived cracked right down the middle, I super glued it because I couldn't be bothered dealing with a return."
2.0,"The necklace itself is fine but it's not navy blue.  In dim light it looks navy but in regular light or daylight its very clearly purple including the rope.  It's not worth returning.  But I still dont have a navy blue 36"" necklace!!"
2.0,I got the wrong color and the size is too small too. Looks good but not wearable for a long time.
2.0,The page selling these says hand wash is recommended but machine wash is an option. It says nothing about the socks needing to be line dried. I live in Florida. It is too humid to count on things like socks drying before they start to mold or mildew. These are being returned.
2.0,metal was not storng enough and the heart piece kept falling off my girlfriend said that it doesnt matter though she liked it.
2.0,This is a tight fitting dress. The material is thick.
2.0,Very flimsy n chap looking
2.0,Oversized is right!!! Way too big and goofy looking.  Will be returning
2.0,I was very disappointed in this product. Ended up not even using it. For being a snowsuit this product is not waterproof or water resistant. Soaked it right up.
2.0,"These leggings are cute and fit my children well. However, they fell apart during the first few hours of normal use.  I bought two pairs (one golden and one purple) and washed them once before the first use. Then my children had it on for only a few hours and the result is shown in the attached pictures. The gold coating rubbed off and yellow fabric is showing. On the purple pants, the outer coating seemed to have fallen off at the knee. They are cute but definitely too expensive as a one-time outfit."
2.0,Fit was small
2.0,cute but to small for me
2.0,"Cheep, you get what you pay for"
2.0,I should have 'listened' to the first reviewer; these boots run very narrow and are very tight.  Sad to say they might end up collecting dust in the closet until I give up and bring them to my local church.
2.0,Very light and comfortable shoes. Good breathability. Only negative is possibly the inspection prossess because my tounge for the shoe is sewed on crooked and shows my sock underneath. Also runs a bit small
2.0,"Returned them, because they were smaller than I was looking for."
2.0,I wore this one time and the letters started peeling off. I would not recommend this to a friend.
2.0,"Nice looking gloves, they just don't keep my hands much warmer than the $1 gloves from target. How is that possible?<br />Update: after a few months, all the tech padding on the fingertips fell off, so now I can't use my phone. Just don't buy these. Better than nothing though."
2.0,Material is nice. Over all happy with product but the skirt runs small. I will be returning unfortunately. Wanted skirt to lay on my hips more. It fits up around my waist but then is to short it doesn't even look like a skirt.
2.0,"The shirt is not the one pictured. Its a knockoff. It is wide, short and the open space on the chest is much smaller."
2.0,Lt foot not sewn correctly and uncomfortable to walk
2.0,Looks cuter in pic
2.0,It was ok. I ordered an xl and it fit like a glove. I usually wear a small in buttondowns but it was missing a button on the sleeve and it didn’t come with an extra one
2.0,Probably a nice mask for a giant . If you have a small face like most woman this will be way to big . Wish they had it in a small .
2.0,"I bought this hat for my son for Christmas. The hat is wonderful and he loves it, but to his disappointment the stats that are taped to the inside of the hat are for the 2015 Superbowl for the Patriots and the Seahawks! And when I called to try and at least get the correct stats, I was told the hat was sold out. So we tried calling the manufacturer and couldn't get it from them either. My son is a true Cowboys fan and Emmitt Smith is his all time favorite player so it was so upsetting to give him this gift that was not completely authentic. I feel someone should have at least tried harder to make things right."
2.0,My husband bought this for me for Valentine's day. The inside pocket that is stitched into two pockets has completely undone - it can't hold anything in it because it all just falls out of that pocket. The outside stitching (above the vertical zippered pockets) is tearing as well. Too late to return it now. I have only been using it for about a month and a half - not even every day. I am very disappointed that is happening already.
2.0,Its rather heavy and too narrow at the bottom
2.0,Was off centered
2.0,"These are really pretty but were here much smaller than I expected.  They are definitely for a baby/toddler. I used them in my 2nd hole piercing but the stone feel out on the 2nd day of wearing them, so I just threw it away. I'm kind of disappointed but they were pretty"
2.0,Misshapen waste of money.
2.0,"Listing says ""Big and tall"" but the tag in the collar says ""slim fit."" Sweaters are too small. Unfortunately I had shoulder surgery and didn't get a chance to try them on before the return date. Guess I'll pass them on."
2.0,Pretty big on my average size wrist
2.0,The color was not was it showed in the photos in amazon. It’s a much lighter color and not what it looks like at all.
2.0,"Strap broke on less than 10 hours of use.  Merchant said &#34;too bad&#34; out of warranty, cannot replace."
2.0,Looked like a cheap cocktail dress. Definitely not a win for Christmas card family photos. 🥴
2.0,The button locations are VERY difficult to operate correctly. Not sure if they are slightly off place what the problem is.<br />I have to press them very hard to make them work. It`s NOT comfortable to work with.
2.0,"This bracelet is totally gorgeous but the rose gold color didn’t last. It faded within a month, and I didn’t get get it wet or sleep with it on. It was beautiful while it lasted though! One side note is that it did stay sparkly. As for size, I have a small wrist and it fit me perfectly, so it does run small. I had no issues with the clasp, surprisingly since my two year old likes to grab on to it pretty often. I loved this but even at this low price point, it’s not worth it for just one month of use."
2.0,Cute dress but the tie is annoying rather than just having a zipper and it was WAY too small and I’m normally an 8 in everything
2.0,The tie designs are great. The material they use it cheap and thin. You can't even wear a tie clip without the tie scrunching up.
2.0,"Returned, Ordered dark green and bright green one and both that arrived were teal!"
2.0,Inexpensive appearance.  Not worth the money
2.0,This took Much longer than expected to arrive and when it arrived it smelled awful of mildew. I immediately washed it and the smell is no longer there but the belt stank so bad I had to throw it out. I didn’t return it because I liked the dress but will use a different belt with it. It does fit tighter than expected but good thing I lost some weight.
2.0,"Looking at this set it appears as though the smallest two suitcases are suitable for carry-ons....WRONG. The middle size, in fact, is about two inches too wide and I was called out for it in line boarding a plane so I had to gate check the bag. Had I know that I likely would not have bought this set. The smallest is too small for even a short trip and the next two sizes need to be checked in with the airline so none of these are really good options if you want a carry on bag for a 2 to 3 day trip."
2.0,"They were a little more pricey than I wanted but I decided to try them anyway. At first I was super excited, they were exactly as pictured and soooo fun. But then I put them in. The back screws on, which at first I thought was cool, super secure, right? No. The back doesn't stop turning when it's on all the way.....it just starts unscrewing the front. Both sides unscrew. I had the hardest time telling when to stop turning the back so I kept losing either the fronts or backs. Ultimately both fronts fell out and I didn't realize it, I found one, the other could be literally anywhere. Yes, one side could probably be glued, but for the price I'd think they wouldn't require extra work to wear them."
2.0,Absolutely adorable and just like the picture. However the button pops off and zipper constantly breaks.  These also run a little big so if you are still interested be careful on the sizing.
2.0,This could have been a really cute dress but the top is definitely not cut as you see here.  It barely covered my shoulders and definitely did not cover my bra by any stretch of the imagination. I sent it back.
2.0,"Having already bought an Aoxjox legging before in x-small, I took the seller's advice of sizing up and got a small in this pair.<br /><br />Unfortunately the leggings was still too tight. Despite this, it was too wide at the ankle. The material had no stretch to it. Overall disappointed and would not recommend."
2.0,"I really liked the top, but the bottoms look like someone photo copied leopard print off of high glossy magazine pages and taped them on to the bottoms. And they are about 3 sizes too small."
2.0,"I got these as a gift and gave them back to be returned.  I am red green color blind.  They are just like any other colored sunglasses. Everything looks more green.<br /><br />I can not see more colors.I can't see colors on multiple different color blind tests that other people who aren't color blind can see.  So I cant see more colors.  Green looks more intense and jumps out.  They are just green aviator sunglasses.  Not worth the huge price tag.<br /><br />I could tell the difference between brown and green easier.  My friends tried it on and said green was more intense.<br /><br />Normally i can't tell the difference between green and brown, blue and purple, other minor shades of colors.  Everyone thinks i'm color blind so I can only see black and white.  While that may be the case for some people i can still see a lot of colors and i can see a difference in shade and colors.<br /><br />I think that youtube video is a fake made by company to scam people into buying these glasses.  Maybe these glasses do work for some people?<br /><br />As for the balloons in the package.  I could tell you what each color of the balloons was before i put on the glasses. The balloons in the package made it seem more like a scam to me.  Like the company CEO thought lets put these in here but not a simple color blind tests to show you that the glasses actually work.  If these glasses were $100-$150 mark I would still have them and be enjoying them.  But charging $350 and lieing about what the glasses can do is not cool.<br /><br />EnChorma.  If you are reading this I would be more than happy to try out any of your other glasses to see if they work.  If I put on your glasses and can see other colors i couldn't see before I would be happy to pay $350 for them.  And I will pay $350 for them.  Next time include color blind test cards if your are going to charge $350 for the glasses.  Not some cheap balloons.  I hope your company isn't a scam and you are actually trying to help color blind people.  But these didn't work. Shame on you for giving me hope that i could see all colors."
2.0,"The dress looked cute but when I put it on there was something weird about the neckline. It was sticking out as if there was too much fabric. The dress fits well in the bust and waist but the neckline is not lying flat. The fabric, even though very pretty, is a little stiff and scratchy. Another thing I didn't like about it is how narrow the hem is."
2.0,"Bought these to use as intended as sweet bands, they were as described and would reorder 3"" versus 2"". Did not handle washing as well as wanted got 5 and still have 3 left after some time."
2.0,"I would have like the wording on the outside of both legs. It was only on the outside of one, not both. Ended up wearing a different pair on my wedding day."
2.0,"I’m 5ft 4, and high waisted. The tie of the robe is near my chest, way too high and attached. Sized very small."
2.0,"After wearing one time you can tell where my seatbelt lands and rubbed against the fabric, and now there is an obvious line where the fabric frayed across my chest, also another spot on my shoulder from where my purse strap landed. Can’t be repaired and makes me very self conscious about wearing this dress again. Also very sheer fabric, no bright colored undies with this dress."
2.0,The top part is way too large and looks like wings on the sides of not on properly. The rest fits ok digs in on legs a bit
2.0,"I read the reviews and descriptions and chose an XL. First, the fabric was too thin. Second, the XL was not flattering or fitting. Cut was not as expected."
2.0,"I have long, slender hands, so the fit was not a problem, but these gloves do not stand up to simple wear.  The third time that I slipped them on, the leather tore at the wrist.  The first warning should have been when I unwrapped them and there was inconsistency in the appearance of the leather pieces that are stitched together to create the whole glove.  I suspect that these gloves are made from cast-off leather scraps that are then highly processed to create a soft feel.  The processing undermines the hide fibers, creating a thin, tearable product."
2.0,too small and narrow
2.0,"Shipping was lighting fast and design looks cute, but the material is very thin, sleeves are a real short feminine cut and the shirt itself is short and wide........... awkwardly short.  And wide."
2.0,"There’s not one thread of linen in this outfit. It fits well, looks nice, has a linen “look”, but it has none. It’s rayon, polyester and cotton."
2.0,"The cuff cuts into your ear.  And when arrived it had been smashed due to poor packaging, bubble wrap will not protect the cuff when made so poorly."
2.0,"ankle feel unsteady, unsupported."
2.0,The bar is very short and color doesn't really stand out like the picture shows. They are still pretty but I wouldn't buy them again.
2.0,"I received my package today, and it only had the bracelet in it. I was disappointed since I was looking forward to the bracelet and necklace."
2.0,"Nice garment, however there is a hole in the seam  of the neckline.  Not too bad right not but could spread as washed, worn, and dried. I 'm not much of a seamstress,  so doubt I can fix it. Any suggestions?"
2.0,"One key is defective. The picture shows the center cut is not the same length. This prevented one key from fully inserting into ignition and would not turn. The other keys center cut was long enough and did work. I could not program them to open the doors though. All in all this was an expensive failure in lost money, time and gas."
2.0,Cheaply made and shoddy materials
2.0,Too heavy-- flips over upside down quite a bit
2.0,"Really bummed out! This is a hard curved mask that isn't flexible, but it came packed in a flat bag and was totally broken when I opened it up. The packaging job was very very poor, and due to the material it's made of, it can easily snap. I bought this specifically because it said &#34;fabric covered plastic&#34; but it is more of a porous plaster type material with decorations on it, NOT plastic. I was really excited to find this one because of all the amazing reviews, so I'm pretty baffled that it snapped so easily in transit. I put it back together to try it on at least, and it fits nicely and I do like the design. However, it also has a pretty strong odor that would bother someone sensitive to chemical smells."
2.0,"This leather never came from aliving aniamal, the bag is flimsy in construction, stitching is untidy and the strap  is very thin and knots onto the side of the bag so not very secure.  The flap closure is fiddly."
2.0,The details on it snd stitching is great but you can breath or anything in it. Plus it is lopsided to one side and hurts my ears and I don’t have a large head.
2.0,I bought this as a gift for a lady with three daughters and I thought it was attractive.  However it was too small for her neck and it was very cheap looking.  Also the hearts bunch up so you can't really see them.
2.0,"This  dress is cut for someone young,tall, thin and is looking for a juvenile dress, it is not cut for anyone older than 25, short, curvy and looking for something that is flattering to the figure. A hippo in a tutu comes to mind. Sorry ,I couldn't bear to post a photo. It did fit true to size and at 5'4'' the length would be perfect. It is just not flattering for a women with curves."
2.0,"shirt looked exactly as expected, a little stiff but still cute. extremely disappointed to discover that there was a missing a button right in the middle of the shirt when I opened the package. missing button was nowhere to be found nor was there a replacement button."
2.0,Irregular fit for sizing and the smell was awful.  Had to return
2.0,A bit cheap looking. The metal isn't real strong.
2.0,"Didn't LIKE THE fit felt a little tight  wasn't quite long enough,  didn't have a  zipper or buttons for closing. BUT other than that IT was very warm"
2.0,"You get what you pay for. These are not natural ""real"" druzy. Disappointed in the material but color is pretty."
2.0,"Nice neckline..<br />The material is see through. You can wear a cami underneath.<br />This top runs very big . I thought it would be long ,baggy for leggings, but for me its to big. The stitching is not done well.<br /><br />I wear a medium to large depending on the top, and this was falling off of me ( I’m older 5’2, 130).<br /><br />I think this top is something I would  see in Walmart..I’m not a fan!"
2.0,Not bad for the money. But up close it looks very cheep. The gems are glued on very sloppy. Some of the gems where placed on their crooked.
2.0,"Very poor product, not as expected"
2.0,Dress was a bit too small.
2.0,"I would give it to a toddler if I knew any, as clearly those are the humans it was designed for.  Sucks bc I bought it for myself to wear."
2.0,"Right out of the box I was sad because there is a weird green gem glued crooked on the top. It isn't straight, AND it isn't seated all the way down (I never even saw it in the picture because it is all the way down between the four prongs on top!) Mine is sticking up and will snag everything :( SUPER upset!! I have to give this as a bridal gift TOMORROW! Then, I started looking at it, and one side looks okay, another one actually looks GOOD, the other two look horrible!! You can't read the words &#34;POLICE BOX&#34; at the top, and the panels all have, I don't know, maybe extra gunk from the mold on them. Too bad the only side that looks good is one of the sides you can see how crooked the gem on top is. This has to be one of the worst looking TARDIS products I have ever seen. If I had more then one day I would return it and not even think about giving this to anyone, ever. I'm giving it two stars only because I like the weight and size of it. I could and SHOULD have been made well."
2.0,the chains broke
2.0,Have not worn the item yet because I was very disappointed in the size. Thought it would have been a bit bigger or rather longer.
2.0,Did not fit my glasses.  Turned back for credit.
2.0,"Colors on site not same when shipped, much duller colors"
2.0,It’s a pretty ring but it is SOO MUCH smaller than it appears. The band is very narrow and the blue isn’t as vibrant as in the picture. Also runs small.
2.0,It doesn't fit at all... feels a big T-shirt I definitely have to get it adjusted...
2.0,The sleeves and bottom hem were a slightly different color than the dress.
2.0,"These earrings are beautiful and delicate.  However, the little rubber backs that came with them broke while I was taking them off to wear them.  I was able to use some other rubber backs with them, but they won't stay on!!  They are constantly sliding down, and I find myself adjusting them every 10-15 mins.  You also have to squeeze them a little to help them stay in place, which is very uncomfortable.  This is the first time I'm wearing them and I have a headache.  Thinking about returning them!"
2.0,To small. Want to return for a larger size
2.0,"Although 100% cotton, they were rough and hard to breath through.  Made my face break out. Also very wrinkly after washing. The only nice thing about them was a heavy nose wire, the made for a tight fit and won't break anytime soon."
2.0,"clasps are very hard to close, even allowing for being new. wire that goes through the pierced hole is too thick for my ears"
2.0,This dress runs a bit large. Much longer then advertised in the photo and doesn’t quite give off the same look. I returned my first order then reordered a size smaller. Fit much better but the dress is still long past the knee. Would be perfect if it was shorter. Warm comfortable material thicker than I assumed it would be.
2.0,"I was super excited to get this. I was a bit disappointed that this was very obviously a rainbow colored one instead of the pictured pink-blue-yellow color. I got A-color2 so keep that in mind, it's rainbow colored.<br />(Not that I have anything against rainbows, it's still pretty but I wanted the PICTURED PRODUCT!)<br /><br />I went to hand wash this in luke-warm - coldish water with mild soap.<br />To my surprise, the glitter or color coating on the rhinestones started coming off and sticking onto my hand, even though I was super gentle. I didn't rub on it or use harsh chemicals at all.<br />If you're going to use this without ever washing then maybe it would be ok but the fact that I'm getting so much fallout with even gentle washing makes this not really suitable for masking to avoid a virus.<br />I'm guessing with further washes the rhinestones will just be clear.<br /><br />The PM 2.5 filter included was a bit different from what I'm used to too, more flimsier, so I just discarded it.<br />This does NOT have a nose wire either, so you'll have to add it yourself. The mask craftsmanship is ok, it doesn't have loose threads or anything but the top part is a little misaligned on mine, not too noticeable though.<br /><br />Overall a bit disappointed. It's an ok mask but the brilliance won't last long."
2.0,I love my floating charm but unfortunately 3 of my rinestones fell out. I have had it almost 2 months.
2.0,Nice shirt. But definitely ran small.<br />Had to send mine back
2.0,"This bra caused an allergic reaction, similar to other reviewers. The adhesive material caused irritation."
2.0,They were way to big but aye i’ll just have to take a few beads out no biggie but I can’t do anything with the gold chains because yeah to wide still cute tho
2.0,Needed some additional stitching to keep them together but u get what u pay for
2.0,The quality of the fabric is good but the stitching is poor. After only 3 wearings in a classroom environment the stitches on the back pocket have separated.
2.0,"Was cute but did not fit right, to tight through chest and shows the rolls."
2.0,"Originally looked good, but paint started peeling away just after 2 years of ownership. My V is never outside of the garage more than a few hours at a time, is only hand washed, and overall taken exceptional care of. I expected it to last much longer given the circumstances."
2.0,Bigger than expected. Blouse too short. Again oversize clothes with short tops. Smh
2.0,"Pretty, good for young giŕl"
2.0,"Clunky, Too Big, Not what I expected."
2.0,The product is very well made however it doesn’t fit many cards and is very difficult to get them out when you need to use them. It’s a good thing so they don’t fall out but it’s a pain in the butt when you need to get a card out to use it. Also hard to fit a lot of cash in the clip. Other then that good product
2.0,"Runs small IMO. Ordered medium based on other reviews, and it was uncomfortable tight. I normally wear 8-10 in pants, and am a fairly fit individual with a white girl booty. (5'9&#34; tall, 145 lbs)"
2.0,Ordered 3 sizes too bug and it's still way small. Cannot even fit it around me.  Very disappointed. Otherwise it is cute.
2.0,I was so happy with this item until the wing strap broke after an hour of wearing. It's held together by glue and couldn't be fixed at the time. I'm sure it will be fine for a child's outfit just didn't last for me as a adult.
2.0,Snap on one side doesn't work
2.0,"Lasted 2 weeks, very light duty"
2.0,"I think they must've changed the material they used to use, because this material just gets stinkier everytime I wear them. I've sprayed them with a disinfectant, but EWWWW!  Wish I could get my money back."
2.0,I got this product because local citizens of my county believe this will draw out toxins from the body and cure back and body aches and pain. I have to say at first I believed it work - but I know believe it was all in my head and it does not do what I thought. Plus the one size fits all is not true for all men. Its a very nice bracelet but I believe its just that a bracelet.
2.0,I’m 5’3 and in the 250 weight range I can fit a large at H&M got a two XL they barely fit and they are far from high waisted
2.0,I wouldn't buy another pair.
2.0,It turned colors
2.0,To small. Not big like the ones everyone is wearing.
2.0,It's torn apart for little use over the winter time. It's a mistake to buy this.
2.0,It's Asian sizing so you have to go one or two sizes bigger. I wear a small normally and I ordered this in a large and its long and perfect and just how the picture is. Came faster than expected but when I opened the package the cardigan had 3 large holes in it...
2.0,Quality was nice but size was way too small
2.0,[[VIDEOID:ae0d0d7d0ee5a7a53e25777990cd79f]] I was sent the wrong colors which will not work for my job. I ordered two black masks. Also these slide too much while trying to talk or yawn which also would not be acceptable for a work environment. Two stars for the care in the packaging and I might wear them running errands
2.0,"I don't see how this headband, being spandex will stay on! I wasn't even working out and it slipped to the top of my head. I then took 2 pieces of velvet and sewed one in the front and one in the back and it stays better. Maybe manufacturing can look into this"
2.0,"Quality is there, but they really need to stress how small they run. I am a m-l and really on the medium side however I should have gotten an xl. So I can not give them a high rating."
2.0,The item is as advertise but with a really big face too big for me
2.0,Ordered for my 4 year old and the top fit but bottoms are way to big even with a swim diaper on.
2.0,Products were cool looking. However poorly made. Some pairs did not stretch like socks are suppose to fit.
2.0,"Purchased XL, more like a M.  Inside was cheap looking.  Coat is very thin.  When I opened the package, there was another multi-taped torn packaging inside.  Apparently this was returned from another customer who lived in Iowa.  How do I know?  They sent me the product in her return envelope with name and address attached."
2.0,"I thought these were so cute, and my daughter loved it! However, her bracelet broke during her first day of school and mine broke 2 days later. We tried to re-tie them with our own slip knots, but they kept falling off."
2.0,Doesn't feel like any of my other merino products. Very soft. Not a flattering cut if you're athletic
2.0,So cute in person but disappointed within the first few minutes out wearing them they ripped easily. If your one to scruff or drag your foot I don’t recommend.
2.0,"I got this dress and was really disappointed. When I put it on, it was just ""frumpy"". The seam around the waist looked really off and didn't fit the rest of the dress. The material was really heavy and thick."
2.0,"Was very thin and didn't fit was, too short"
2.0,"Really wanted to like them but they were much bigger than expected. Felt like wearing a large diaper frankly... very uncomfortable. Ordered as recommended per sizing table, but need at least one size (or maybe two) smaller."
2.0,"I bought this to replace another Star Wars ""Rebel"" wallet that I purchased elsewhere several years ago. That one felt better and held up great. This one feels like cheap plastic - like a kid's wallet - and I'm debating on whether to keep it or send it back. Very disappointed."
2.0,They are smaller than expected and so lightweight the small sections twist when wearing. What can I say....the price should have told me!  There is one that sells that have larger segments that is a little better quality!
2.0,Cheaply made though attractive. Little foot things fell off during first week of use.
2.0,This thing shrunk almost to the point of unwearability. Buy one size up.
2.0,Loved it but fellapart while at elvis impersonation show 😥
2.0,I read that this fits small.  I am a 38c so I ordered a 40d and wow!  It is so tight you can’t breathe!  The cups are way small and you spill over.  Disappointed.  Quality is good so 2 stars.
2.0,"I am a size 14,and wear a large,due to a larger bust. This XL dress is so tight across my chest I cannot wear it."
2.0,"In picture, they look sparkly and bright. In person, it looks like a cheaply made and tacky Christmas craft. Glitter seems to be outside of plastic. Wanted to compare to Kate Spades. They both look different in person."
2.0,"These are not compression tanks. These are tanks that are made out of stretchy, thin fabric. Probably good for just wearing around, yoga, or as a top for working out but don't expect an compression benefits."
2.0,I dont know what i was expecting but it looked a lot smaller and i ordered a large....didnt close over the girls......#sad
2.0,Needs way way more stretch.
2.0,pros; fast delivery and very cute<br />cons; should come in different sizes and once it gets wet and stops working.
2.0,"Hard to get on. Used them for  traveling and was uncomfortable about one hour into my trip. Compression is great, but I have found other compression stockings more comfortable and easier to get on with the same amount of compression measurement."
2.0,"Looked cute in the pictures, but the &#34;tassles&#34; were further apart in real life, exposing more stomach and giving it more of a &#34;what wild animal attacked you?&#34; kind of look vs artfully shredded. Also, and it may be because I'm a little larger up top, the v-neck came down further than pictured. It was basically down to where the top of the tassels are in the picture. So maybe an inch lower. I was really disappointed because the swimsuit looks so cute in the picture, but sadly, it was only in the picture."
2.0,Ni me lo medí pq nada más de verlo sabía que no me serviría . Devuelto ahh y me cobraron la devolución 😔
2.0,"I chose this solar light because it had a nice look and feel to it when I saw it.  I am sorely disappointed that at night, after a full day of sun, it emits very little light.  As in a TINY bit of light.  The manufacturer can remedy this problem by using a larger solar lighting system.  Until then, don't waste your money purchasing this item."
2.0,Mechanics and metal finish look good. Clear cover over hands is plastic and not fitted to metal nicely. This plastic piece looks cheap and i had scratches on in after only a couple days.
2.0,Pretty color but the top was see thru and the side seem had a hole. Returning.
2.0,As the title says the rings only fit on my pinky finger but for the price there perfect for props if you want to add a chain to it and make it into a necklace
2.0,"They suggested ordering a size up, I usually wear a large or a 14, the size chart said the XL was a 14-16 so I thought the 16 would work but it is way too small. I have to return now and that is a pain! That being said, the dress is really cute!"
2.0,Not thick (actually thin) for the winter. Not exactly water proof. It will get wet in the rain without direct exposure.
2.0,No le quedo a mi niña
2.0,I ordered a large and they were way too small!
2.0,"Bought this for my 20 month son. I got the 3 T and it looked like it fit just right, which means it runs on the small side. However, once he got into bed and tried to move around I noticed that the pants restricted his movements. I would not recommend this product."
2.0,I'm 5ft5 ant these pants were way to long. Even if I wore heels with them they were to long. With my walking shoes on they were at least 3 inches too long. I wasted my money 😕
2.0,"I really was looking forward to this top! Everything was wrong! Followed sizing chart but this was smaller then stated and the color was way off. I ordered pink, which in the picture looks more like blush pink. What I received was bright pepto bismal pink. Very disappointing!"
2.0,Bonitos pero demasiado pesados para andarlos más de 15’🤨
2.0,"Arrived with a missing stone. Also, the back of the earring posts were bent. In the photo the color looks more gold than it is. The gold tone is barely noticeable (except where the stone is missing). I purchased this set to wear one time for a costume party so I wasn't expecting high quality or long lasting. I was, however, expecting it to arrive intact and looking like the photo. Fortunately I ordered early so I still have time to get something else. Don't waste your money."
2.0,These are very light weight and comfortable but I can only use one pair since the screw fell out of one of the temples of the second pair and even an optometrist is unable to get it to screw all the way in securely.
2.0,"This fit as expected, but it appeared to be made pretty cheaply. The fabric surrounding the holes at the top was a different shade of green from the rest of the dress. The skirt was too full for my liking. The fabric felt like a shower curtain. I returned this dress."
2.0,"These are cute, but way too tiny. I bought them for my 4 year old and they fit my 1 year old."
2.0,"My daughter is heading to Peru and it was suggested that she have a lightweight windbreaker/rain jacket with her. I thought this might be a good jacket due to its ""waterproof/windproof"" claim. I can see that it will be wind resistant and possibly wind proof, but it is not water proof and I would be hard pressed to call it water resistant. To test it my daughter put her arm in the sleeve and flicked her wet fingers over the sleeve to simulate a light sprinkle. The jacket quickly got heavy and wet and stuck to her arm. I had a can of waterproofing spray for camping equipment and I sprayed the jacket with that and she will be alright now. The other thing to know, is that it runs small. She is 5'5"" about 120 pounds. She normally wears a small or medium in juniors, and I bought her a large to possibly accommodate a sweatshirt in higher elevation. The most she can wear under the L is tank or a t-shirt. She cannot fit a sweatshirt under it. So I recommend sizing up at least one size if your putting something heavier under it. I got the hunter/black color and the color is nice. It also came with a small pouch to carry it in which I also sprayed with waterproofing so she can stuff her wet jacket into it if needed."
2.0,Product was very cheaply made and very small.
2.0,This product only look beautiful does not stay in the shoe…. It’s Spin around until It eventually falls out without you even knowing I would not recommend it to anyone to buy it … unless you want to waste your money
2.0,"Shipping was fast, but product was not what I was expecting. It had a very strong chemical odor and was much too small and flat to work as the type of petticoat we will need. However, it was cheap...so I guess I got what I paid for. Sending back and ordering a more expensive one."
2.0,Sizing chart is way off. This was way too big. Tried to shrink it and it's still too big. Holes to insert/ remove pads is very small - almost too small. Inserting and removing is difficult. Adjusting pads when the bra is on is nearly impossible.
2.0,i ordered a large and it fitted way to small! I followed the size chart but was still way to small for me
2.0,Bought this dress after reading the reviews about how great it was… however it’s not so great for me.. 5’11” at 275 lbs - and 26 weeks pregnant carrying mostly in my stomach/ hip area… I tried this dress on and we’ll I didn’t love it right away.. I tired “fixing it”- adjusting it to where it look “right” on me… and still didn’t like it. The material is like a cheap satin material. Which wouldn’t bother me as bad if it fit right or if I wouldn’t have to worry about rips and tears in the mist of wear and tear of the dress down the road.<br />Sure the dress looks great on the model in the picture… but it’s doesn’t mean it’ll look great on all… if I didn’t have my prego belly I might- I BIG MIGHT- keep the dress
2.0,it is too short for my neck. I need extender to make it fit
2.0,wasn't the size i expected
2.0,Too small.  Didn't fit well.  Small pockets.  Didn't come with belt as shown in picture.
2.0,doesn't look as cute as my other ones.
2.0,"Quite small.  Also, the colors under the clear dome are not quite the same as in the picture."
2.0,"My daughter ordered this outfit in a small. It says a small is a 26"" waist, my daughter has a 22"" waist, so we thought, ""room to grow!"" Boy were we wrong. Can't even zip it all the way closed on my tiny daughter. However, top fit fine. Outfit is grossly mis-sized."
2.0,Too large and waistband is also to narrow.  Buy at least one size smaller.
2.0,"Product was disappointing. It is smaller than advertised, made from poor material, designed badly and fits poorly. It isn’t functional"
2.0,"I ordered the 4 pack that is described to include 1 black pair, 1 gray, 1 burgundy, and 1 olive. I was sent a brown pair instead of the olive green. Big fail on the sellers part. These were also huge on me in the whole top portion, especially the waist. I am normally a size small in leggings, but am not super skinny by any means, so these should've fit nicely. These leggings will likely only fit a size medium or large, and no one who is petite. I am 5'2'' and 125lbs."
2.0,"Not thrilled with the sizing. The other reviews stated that they were happy with the fit, but I need to lose at least 10 lb. to have it fit like it should based on the measurements, which defeats the purpose of trying to buy a loose, comfy dress."
2.0,I ordered a size 8 and it comes as a 2XL. It's small in the crotch area so be careful to not bend over.
2.0,"Case is difficult to install...plastic snaps does not easily fit. Problem is that the batteries are removable, so I do swap batteries from time to time. Inconvenience of the installation process outweighed the convenience of Qi charging...especially since the Qi area on this back is very limited. I have to remove the thin protective rubber cover, then I can put it on the Qi pad...and move it around so that the blue light comes on...not very convenient at all.<br />I've stopped using it."
2.0,It is a nice romper but it too closed up on the neck area and does not sit well.<br />Also it has a zipper in the back. I thought it was a pull on.....Back it goes
2.0,Great fit! 2 of three tights ripped on the very first use. So disappointed because we usually receive great products from this company.
2.0,Shortly after buying this for my boyfriend I started to discolor. A year later he still wears it but it doesn't look good.
2.0,"These necklaces look and feel cheap, but they're kinda cute. A little too big for my neck, even when clasped to be the smallest size, but luckily for me, the clasps are weak and easy to pry open and closed. I bent them open, cut one end of the cheap material until it would fit around my neck, and it worked.<br /><br />The chokers with bands of two and three look the worst. They're uneven and get tangled up, and don't look sophisticated when worn around the neck. The band of one is fine though."
2.0,"Really cute, but too small so baby couldn’t use them"
2.0,They are inexpensive rings and that is what you get. They are pictured with more detail than what the actual rings look like.
2.0,Low quality.  There is literally brad-fasteners holding the fold of the boot.  The “wool” part is almost shag carpet material.
2.0,"The material is so unpleasant. Im super disappointed because the design looks cute in the picture but just doesn’t sit that way because of the stiff material, and is uncomfortable to wear."
2.0,"I've given this item two stars, because it is has a nice weight to it and it looks great; however, it's fallen apart twice. Thought we had it fixed the first time, but nope...Disappointing!"
2.0,Everything was good with the size. But the skirt had no slit in it like the picture. Just not what I thought it would be. So I returned it.
2.0,"Somewhat see through and suuuuper short in the front, barely covered what needs to be covered.  I bought a medium which is my normal size, typically wear a size 6."
2.0,I told them in sizing I wore a 10 extra wide! The sent me a 9. Too tight.
2.0,This t-shirt I would advise you to size up to the next size because it can be a tight fit.
2.0,"Product came defected. A hinge was stuck, so the necklace wouldn't sit flat. Other than that, the jewels sparkle beautifully."
2.0,"I bought this dress to use for an engagement photo shoot because I loved the floral design. However in person the dress really doesn’t complement most shapes (unless you have unnaturally wide hips) and even with a belt, the dress still looked bad because it would fold over with a belt. I think you just need a very specific body type with this dress and I also think most people don’t have it. Also the floral design looks more like blobs of color in person than soft flowers."
2.0,It looked a little matronly for my taste.
2.0,I ended up giving this watch to my daughter
2.0,"Too short and clingy, also there’s some weird stitching color on the front as shown in picture. Will return."
2.0,My daughter loved this dress but I washed it before she wore it and it shrunk so much. I understand clothes can shrink but this was way more than normal. Very disappointed.
2.0,"I’m putting this out there because I believe they deleted my comment on their Facebook ad. I purchased there Shefit bra after they appeared on Shark Tank. Good cup support but material scratched in places and over time with wear and wash, the Velcro straps DO NOT stayed adhered and I had the right size and I’m not large busted. I had to stop several times to reattach. Will not purchase another one."
2.0,Very thin and light...looks like dillar store find.  Couldn't give as a gift.
2.0,"Cute earrings but meant for someone with tiny ear lobes, a child, for example."
2.0,A small is equivalent to an extra large However I love the material material it is made of it is super soft and silky  Was very disappointed when I could wrap the sweatshirt completely around me
2.0,"It is somewhat misleading as the model's waist is high..? but it looks a little funny on me that the skirt part flares out from around my chest...  I knew I would not wear it or enjoy wearing it, so I returned it."
2.0,"They looked cute online, but in person they were just whatever. Maybe I was expecting them to look as lovely as they do in the picture. Also, they broke already and I never even wore them. Definitely was a waste of money."
2.0,"After two wears, the skirt came apart at the seams. I was really surprised because the skirt was loose and didn’t pull anywhere. I may be able to repair it but Im concerned that if I wear it again it will continue to fall apart."
2.0,"This bathing suit is very cute, but made for skinny,skinny bodies. The top is very small. The XL  TOP FITS a ' A cup! The extra large bottom fits a size 8 butt! Too small"
2.0,I bought these for my son. The crotch came down to his mid thigh. Too funny.
2.0,"I'm not really impressed with this watch. The price was certainly attractive,<br />But overall the fashion pretty much equals the price!<br />  Peter L."
2.0,"The back one is not a tank top, it's a shirt. Not advertised properly."
2.0,The quality was not that great at all but it is what it is
2.0,I am a little confused on how it bends? I tried and would NOT consider this bendable.
2.0,"color was very washed out,  very pale."
2.0,The material was so cheap and  for this price  that's a lot of money for low quality material
2.0,"Doesn't keep a person warm, at 35 degrees, still cold."
2.0,Normally rompers don’t fit me because I have a long torso. This did not fit. I ended up giving it to a friend and it was perfect on her. I do normally wear an XL in rompers and she’s normally a Medium
2.0,"Nice quality but runs extremely small! I’m 5’2” 105, I usually wear an xs but read comments so ordered a medium, it’s still too small! Go up at least 2 sizes"
2.0,The fabric feels super gross. J<br /><br />I expected it to be a cotton blend or some sort of linen based on th pictures but instead it's a super synthetic fabric. Not my jam.
2.0,Is not like picture.
2.0,This was soo small.  I ordered a women medium and this looked like a child’s size
2.0,"I got the yellow one. It's cute, but it's entirely see-through. I can see my entire bra and skin, underwear, everything. You have to wear this with atleast a slip underneath. But even then, you can see the entire outline of the slip. I wouldn't buy it again knowing that."
2.0,I had to return the buttons as they wouldn’t pair with my system
2.0,I used the first band two times when the rubber end which goes onto your glasses broke. They should have provided a much more sturdy end piece.
2.0,Because these are 100% cotton I ordered up. Thank goodness I did but they are still very uncomfortable from the knees down. Once washed and dried they fit more like a size large from the knees up. From the knees down they are tight tight tight and I have fairly thin legs. I really need to return these even though I washed them alreadyy
2.0,It's see through! Please make these in a thicker fabric. I got the pink and you can see your bra and underwear through it. I wear beige or white undergarments with light clothing..still showed through.
2.0,"It does not fit my wrist, too large and there is no way to adjust it."
2.0,This sweatshirt is hard to wash.  They suggest dry cleaning but who dry cleans a sweatshirt.  The material is dull looking and nothing like a regular sweatshirt.
2.0,Does not stay in place.  Holes too big. no good for Covid19.
2.0,"I just love this necklace, I was so excited to get it and the first time I wore it it broke when I was trying to take it out. I wish it would be more resistant. Is a shame because is beautiful."
2.0,refund not received 4/30/20.please credit my card amount of order
2.0,"I was disappointed with the shirt. The fabric was thin, the colors faded from the first wash before even my daughter wore it, and it fit small."
2.0,Very  nice but missing the lock.<br />I can't wear ..
2.0,Runs small... personally I would size up
2.0,"This is when you know you have purchased a cheap product - when the metal clasp on the leather band is one color and doesn't match the metal color on the watch case. Also, the watch was ticking when I received it, rather than having the stem pulled out. Who know how long the battery has been in use. It's really a shame because the watch was otherwise nice. Won't buy from this seller again."
2.0,The opening and closing of the clasp isn&#34;t smooth and when closing the hole and clasp don't match up on all of them.
2.0,Necklace is well made but the stone in it is not complimentary to the stone in the matching earrings.  I kept it but did not give it as a gift.
2.0,"There wasn’t anything wrong with how these were made, but the color in person is so much different. They looked fine in the picture. I was expecting more of a tan color but these are BRIGHT orange. I’m gonna be sending them back."
2.0,"Fit weird, thin, no tags (like the brand). Too expensive for what it turned out to be."
2.0,"I wanted to love this and I really liked the idea 💡 behind this romper. It has a very boho feel with not enough boho material. It was definitely too small on me even though I could actually button it all the way, but I was literally popping out of it in the bust area. I’m 5’3 128 lbs. with a 34DD. I have a small behind and most times I’m in between sizes S/M, sometimes even L depending on the item. I went by the size chart and judged by the look of the pics online I went with the small. I would have needed  a L or even bigger to look like the photos shown. It had pockets, well, sorta, put my hands in as soon as I tried it on and there was a decent size hole in it, stitching seems to be shaky. Not a linen type of material like it appears to be. And of course, I forgot to read the product description of what it was actually made from, my fault. But I do feel that the companies that sell these clothes are very misleading. Just not what I expected. The 2 stars is for the color being correct and it being very lightweight for hot summer days. If you don’t mind the material, believe me, size up at least two sizes! Just not for me, I sent it back the next day."
2.0,"Looked so cute on line...then you get it.  yikes!!  it reminds me of a cheap jersey you would get from China.  Then, the kicker, it has a fleece-like lining!!  so gross."
2.0,My daughter is very tall and thin for an 8 year old and these leggings were even too long and thin for her. They wouldn't fit any of her school friends either. Really unfortunate as the quality of material and stitching is excellent and would have been super warm for winter. Just poor sizing/fit.
2.0,They don’t fit well on the nose. They keep falling off. It is hard to tell the front from the back. But on the positive side they are small and cheap
2.0,I really wanted to love this band but it’s already peeling I’m so sad about this
2.0,"The hair tie fits on the bracelet, but will not stay on. The grooves are not deep enough for the hair tie to stay in place. The bracelets are cute and can be worn without the hair tie. Although disappointed that it didn't work the way it was supposed to I am keeping the bracelets anyways."
2.0,"liked style, enjoying it."
2.0,The writing is on the same side on both socks so you can only see the writing from one side...
2.0,Absolutely loved the dress but it runs way too small. Bought a 3X because a  2X usually fits me loosely so I decided to go up a size just to be safe. But it fits more like a 1X than a 3X. I wish it did fit it is a very pretty dress.
2.0,"Picture looks like 3 quarter sleeve but sleeves are long. A little smaller than expected but still fits. If you want that drape-y look, order a size up. Cute and comfy, nice material…a little bulkier than expected. Good for autumn with leggings. Too warm for spring or summer."
2.0,"I usually wear a size small, but the dimensions on this dress fit funny. The shoulder caps were somewhat squared and boxey looking on me."
2.0,"Nice while it lasted. It looks pretty heavily worn after just a month of normal wear. I’m disappointed it didn’t last, and I’m already in the market for a replacement."
2.0,"This &#34;tunic&#34; is a dress.  Much too long. If you are tall, or want a cute swim cover up, go for it. But I returned it."
2.0,"Keeps very good time but all the stop watch hands just stopped working, won't reset to 0 and after about 3/4 minutes just stops. Watch part works good just for five year old's. But only lasted 3 day stop watch part of it just quit!!!!!!!!!!"
2.0,"I didn’t like that they were a little too short, but i’d Have to say the color was more coral than rose.  I’m gifting them to my mom."
2.0,The boots sensed to be cheaply made. I was not impressed at all and would not recommend these boots.
2.0,There is no instructions on how to put it on. It's just one big long thing. I would not recommend this to aanyone.
2.0,Laces worked great for my 5 year olds shoes initially however they wore through and broke after about 3 months. Not sure if it was the laces or the shoes.
2.0,One month after my purchase the part that hols the shoulder strap ring to the bag broke and now I can't use the strap.
2.0,It broke already 😡😡😡 isn’t too strong to wear it
2.0,"I really wanted to like this band. However, the links snag on absolutely every long sleeve I've worn. While they don't leave the worst marks, it's frustrating to pull apart and has ruined the quality of my shirts over time. The magnet, while cool, does not stay secure on my wrist either. I have small wrists and need the band to be secure while weightlifting, but even with the smallest activity like walking I find myself constantly adjusting it to stay secure.  I had to switch back to my silicon band for these reasons, which is sad because I do like the fit, feel, and look of this metal band better."
2.0,"I bought this in the red body choice with the striped arms. It definitely runs on the smallish side. It's also shorter than pictured, as are the arms. I'm 5'8"", 160 lbs, and normally a size large is loose on me. This shirt fits tighter than I'd like. If it was longer, like pictured, and a bit looser, it would probably be one of my favorite shirts, but not loving the fit all that much. I definitely would never dry it in the dryer. Other shirts I've purchased in the same style, size Large, fit exactly as pictured and are very comfy. This one is kind of a miss."
2.0,a little small in the arms
2.0,Loved this at first and it’s really pretty but now the little stones snag my clothes. I won’t wear it any more.
2.0,Thin material. Easily rips
2.0,I really like the look of these sunglasses and ordered about 6 pairs but I have discovered they are not very sturdy. I have had three pairs break in the same location - top part of the frame near the bridge.
2.0,This is okay I probably won’t order again I’m 5’6 about 240/250 and curvy I ordered a 2x but would get a size bigger for the pants if I could the top is good tho . I plan to lose weight so I’m not tripping but I think the bottoms could be more forgiving for 2x
2.0,"This is the second style of nightgown I've tried from Ekouaer - the first style was way too big (both XL and L) and would barely stay on at night, so returned it.  This style was WAY too small.  I usually wear a large to X-large in clothing, so ordered an XL first - it looked shrink-wrapped on me.  Send that back and (for the first time in my life) ordered an XXL - still way too tight to sleep well in.  I don't know what Ekouaer's issue is with sizing, but I give up and will move on to other brands.  Too bad, though - the material feels lovely and I liked the style."
2.0,Great product just order at least one or two sizes bigger that what you wear.
2.0,"The front is way too &#34;low rise.&#34; That is, the waist band and draw strings are like literally on your junk. Not up at your normal waist line like a regular speedo. Looks good in the photo, of course, but not very functional to actually wear."
2.0,The skirt is pretty I’m 145 and 5’6 and ordered size small and fit just right not tight a bit lose is pretty stretchy so I’m sure I could have ordered a size small to make it tight. What I didn’t like is that after sitting at work all day the skirt stretched and lost shap so there is a bubble of stretched fabric on the back and front from when I was sitting<br />this type of material is the one after you put it in the dryer a few times it looses all elasticity and ends up being huge.
2.0,Cute on but didn’t hold up long. The fabric showed wear after wearing it only once.
2.0,"I like the shirt, but I ordered a Youth Medium. I don’t know what kind of medium-sized youth would fit this, my 9-year-old is swimming in it. Looks like a dress and comes down to his knees."
2.0,The fit was awkward.  I returned this item.
2.0,Fit great looked great and within 3 washes ripped in the crotch. So embarrassed. I was out!!! I'm 5'3 140lbs and ordered the mediums.
2.0,Top not as expected. No way to wear bra. Just an oddly placed piece of fabric covering bust.
2.0,"I bought this dress in a large and it was too big for me, but I did think the dress was very cute and would try a Medium.  I returned the Large, ordered the medium and when I got it in....it is a totally different dress!  Different material, different style with spaghetti straps!! So weird!  I am hoping to return this one and get the medium of the dress I actually ordered! Crazy!"
2.0,Absolutely beautiful but it broke after one use :(
2.0,"It's nice for costume jewelry, but the aqua is light blue.  I showed the<br />online picture of it compared with the necklace in person to the one receiving the gift.  She agreed there is a very big  difference in color."
2.0,LOVED the earrings but sadly one had the flowers break off  from  the earring the first time wearing -so sad.
2.0,It show my bra to world it didn’t dix right. I know to large or what the neck line to low.
2.0,"These shorts seemed so cute, but unfortunately they have a strange fit that looks odd if you have any shape to your posterior... I typically wear a medium, but heeded warnings about Asian sizing and purchased a large.  The waist fit fine, but the thin overlay didn't fall nicely, and hit way higher in the back then the front. I returned and tried an XL as well to see if that helped, but same issue.  Seems like these just won't work for most body types."
2.0,Smaller then expected...didn't fit like picture
2.0,"First, the fastening pin is broken so I cant wear it. It took 3 days to set the time. Weirdly, it wouldnt let me even GET to the time until I left it alone for a day then I could change it. Tried everything. Then all of a sudden, it worked. Directions are almost useless. Buttons are not correct."
2.0,very cute dress but not what I expected
2.0,As a guy it's kind of hard for us to find clothing in our size without taking perfect measurements so when you take measurements to find out that the shirt was completely wrongly measured off of their measurements I don't know what to do about it but all I can do is leave a review
2.0,Wendy them back too too small
2.0,"Had the glasses for 2 hours before they got a scratch on the lens right in front of my eye. This was done with normal usage (I'm pretty careful with my glasses). Definitely not worth the money, returned immediately. Gave it two stars because they do look decent and the hinges on the glasses made them pretty comfortable."
2.0,"All 3 of those Venus fly Traps died. Seriously angry,disappointed"
2.0,"I bought this because it was supposed to handle my new 13&#34; laptop. I needed a shoe horn to get it in there. Zipper started fraying on first day. A &#34;sling backpack&#34; makes me think it was a sling, but it was very uncomfortable."
2.0,"I was very disappointef with this hat when it arrived. Not because I didn't like it or it was bad quality, but because of packaging. It arrived in a shipping bag rolled up and rubber banded to make it smaller. I ended up not wearing it because it's so lumpy and mishapen. I am going to stuff the center and hope I can smooth it out, but I am not hopeful."
2.0,"Pardon my review for sounding frumpty-dumpty, but at 34 and as a new mom with the doomed mom-bod, this item didn't really drape as I had hoped. I'm a 34ddd, size 12ish, with particularly pronounced hips and butt, and this just looked like a too-short silk robe. I loved the minimalist, almost asian simplicity of this in the pictures -- something I DO think is still achievable for more slender gals who consider sizing up just one size. My bosoms were all kinds of exposed, as was the bottom of my cheeks, and the fabric was quite thin, so needless to say, I couldn't keep this for it's intended purpose for a wedding guest dress."
2.0,"These shorts are a great price and I always love a pocket on the side (this one's on the right leg).  They are pretty short waisted, making the correct size seem too small (I'm 5'8"", 165lbs).  The waist band is just an inch-wide elastic inside a much bigger channel.  I never wore them beyond just trying them on, but I feel certain that elastic would twist around easily.  I returned them."
2.0,"Had to send this back. The slit was very high, there was nothing to keep it closed at the neck area so it was very revealing. And the fabric in the blue and white one was SO thing you could see right through it."
2.0,"I bought the black collar with the silver studs and ring, and let me say this: this ""leather"" is not even a centimeter thick and backed with a brown/grey ""suede"" tissue paper thin liner. Its very cheaply made, and doesnt look as well made as the one in the picture. My husband wears it, but i'm disappointed i paid this much for this. You'll get triple the quality for the same price if you just take a trip to the mall or look on hot topic or spencer's online."
2.0,"The material, for that reason I was not able to give the third 🌟 star.  This is expected with on line shopping 🛍"
2.0,"cute but in no way, shape, or form mirrored. You can see straight through them...........bummer"
2.0,Came with some kind of mark on thigh had no time to return or I would of
2.0,The material is silky so it’s very slippery.  It will not stay on my daughters face.  Constantly slipping down.
2.0,As soon as i worn one it came apart
2.0,"its an ok blanket, but the end threads are already loose"
2.0,This is very very see through
2.0,"The elastic waistband is very thick, uncomfortable, and these run small"
2.0,The cups are way too small but the band fits perfectly so sizing up wouldn't work. It would be super cute if it fit and seemed like decent quality.
2.0,Smaller then expected even though I followed sizing recommendations
2.0,"Pink not purple, and pretty large."
2.0,"I really liked the look of this top online, but it was quite disappointing when it arrived. The item had a horrible odor to it, the lace is quite stiff, the gold beading also included pointed stud's which I didn't notice when I was looking at it online (my fault there). You would need to wear a camisole or top under the garment as it is quite sheer. Just not quite what I had wanted."
2.0,Be aware the shirt is not made from 100% cotton as stated in the product description but from 100% polyester. Besides this the overall quality of the shirt feels very cheap. You can get much better quality shirts for this kind of money.
2.0,"Very cute, but smells horrible!!! Like mildew, gross!!!!"
2.0,Does not fit in the slouchy way shown in the picture
2.0,Once u have a loose thread the whole knee pad comes apart. No machine wash friendly. My baby is not a chubby baby and the pads leave her a mark.
2.0,Broke even before I showed it of. I got to repair
2.0,"The green color was beautiful.  The fabric was light and the crocheted edges were pretty. However, I am short, 5'2"" and large busted, 38D, and this cover up was tremendous.  I felt like two of me could wear it.  I also didn't like the tie under the bust.  The tie was not at waist line and I am high waisted.  It created an empire waist and made my already puffy belly look like I was 7 months pregnant.  This was not a flattering style for someone short and full busted.  If you are tall and thin, it would be perfect, however, I would order a size down."
2.0,"Muy bonito, pero llego mojado y con mal olor."
2.0,I love the design....but when it arrived it was bent in several spots and the sticker was jumbled.  I was able to pull it off and reapply it once i had the dents pushed out.
2.0,"I don't know what I expected... Very poorly made, didn't really look much like the pic. I should have known better though, for the price. Took around a month or more to show up."
2.0,One size does NOT for ALL!! I really liked these leggings but they were soooo small and not good stretch at all! I was disappointed.
2.0,"This bag is incredibly cute but after using it 2 times, the strap came off of one side. I'm really disappointed and will be returning"
2.0,looked like i was wearing a chalkboard. Material felt like suede not really in style.  returned.
2.0,Way to heavy. Look cheep.
2.0,Very disappointed.  I have owned the product for 5 months and the button that clasps the purse closed has already ripped off.  Would like to return the item.
2.0,I ordered for ages 7-8 and it looks like it’s for a toddler!
2.0,"A few of the buttons were damaged or broken on arrival, which isn't a big deal considering they are cheap and there are so many. What I am most upset about is the fact that these buttons are advertised as for clothing, but they start to fall apart with one wash. After just one wash, the paint is already rubbing off of the buttons."
2.0,The pearl bow tie seems like it is missing a ton of pearls. You can see way more of the white background material than the picture shows. Makes it look bad.
2.0,Too clear ! on the pic they look waaaay darker.
2.0,Don’t buy this - it’s comfortable but shows too much under clothing and makes your breasts look extremely pointy. Very odd looking.
2.0,Nice material but tooooooo small.
2.0,The material is too thin and frail for work. The design isn’t height proportionate. I like the design and pockets and would like the product with adjustments.
2.0,Pretty anklet but string is starting to fray after only a couple of weeks
2.0,"The shirt is not a nice shade of yellow as it appears in the pics. It's like a crayon yellow vs the buttery yellow I thought it would be. It also feels very cheap. I thought it would have a soft, vintage feel to it. But it is thick and stiff and boxy. Also the design is a weird kinda glossy black."
2.0,"I cannot for the life of me figure out how to adjust the bracelet in order to put it on and off.  I want to send it to my granddaughter but not until I can tell her how to adjust it.  It's very tiny, I doubt a hand would fit through it."
2.0,"I was surprised at how small the earrings were when I got them. They look like they were sized for a child, not an adult. They are too small (short and narrow) for me, so I gave them to my young niece. They are beautifully styled, but they don't stand out at all when I tried them on."
2.0,The intent in the design of this top is cute but the execution leaves a bit to be desired.  The fabric is very nice and soft but on the thin side.  The fold over portion on the top could use a stitch or two to keep it in place as it tends to ride up when you wear it.  I have tried to wear this on a number of occasions but just feel uncomfortable in it because the fit is just not right and I end up choosing to wear something else rather than be self-conscious all night.  I'll probably end up donating the garment to charity.
2.0,"It was rather small but beautifully designed.  I found it hard to expand fearing that it might break.  It seams that these styles are designed for women who are very, very thin."
2.0,I like the shiny leggings that really grip. These are not like that.  They creep me out -- feel all crawly when your wearing them.  If you like that jersey kind of fabric -- go for it.
2.0,Size matters and these run very small. Bought as Christmas gift and too late to return
2.0,Cute top. Unfortunately it seems to be for petite small female.
2.0,"I gave this away immediately. It was super thin, super clingy and very cheaply made. It was inexpensive, so I should have expected this, but it really looked cute online. Not so on me!"
2.0,-Like if you tried to squeeze a 38 butt into a size 35 pants... Not the most 'loving' britches a cat can wear.
2.0,Construction of crotch area causes binding & discomfort
2.0,"Looked great out of the box, and for the first time I wore it... but by the time be of the day it had fabric “pills” all over it. Do not recommend."
2.0,"The dress itself was pretty, but it had a hole in the back seam. I'd suggest if you buy it, you check thoroughly."
2.0,Well- this is weird.<br />Even without the sports bra this cut is very strange. It’s got “caps” for your shoulders or something? Maybe it serves a purpose like preventing sunburns. I don’t know. It’s a no for me and will be returned.<br />Gave it 2 stars because the material wasn’t horrible. It had a weird odor though.
2.0,It's a slightly padded case. If you're like me and wear big glasses then this may not be for you as it barely fits mine. Disappointed.
2.0,This sweater is warm cozy and soft. Problem is it is falling apart. It is snagged and yarn is pulling out all over. I’ve followed the washing directions and yet it continues to get worse. I’ve tried to pull the snags back through but more just keep popping up. It seems to be doing it more on the back panel than the front. It’s too late to return so I guess I’m just wearing it to clean house in. :/
2.0,"I got this bra in black and white. I'm a slender 5'5&#34; with an A cup and these were hard to get on. When they were on, the straps creep up awkwardly and pinch a little in the armpit area. The black fabric is okay...you can't see through it. The white fabric is as thin as tissue paper and you can see EVERYTHING. Overall, ok for $5 but I'd invest more on a sturdier and more comfortable bra."
2.0,"was supposed  to fit a Galaxy Note 5 - again, it did not.  Yes, phone  would go in, but so snug a fit as to not be convenient.  Would like to return it but not have to pay return postage.  Want to assist here??"
2.0,This rain coat is not water proof. It protects you from light mist but can't handle actual rain. Beware you will get wet.
2.0,"Feels super comfy, a-little on the smaller size but that’s okay as an under motorcycle jacket anyways, however! When it says no battery it means it takes a battery but it’s not included in the package; this can be misleading so be careful when ordering! I am not sure how one could make it work"
2.0,Shoe fit great. Durability not so much. Straps broke in under 1 week of normal wear by my daughter. Didn’t contact seller for assistance. Obviously a low quality product.
2.0,"Watch itself is nice but the clock face easily slips off the band.  My daughter after wearing it for just 2 days, had the clock face fall off and drop into a drain. That was the end of it, she came home with only the band.<br /> Not the best idea to have it slide off so easily, it should be attached."
2.0,"The fit was nice. Pretty detail.  After one gentle wash, it had picks everywhere."
2.0,It was a gift. She said that the qualiity of the material was poor and felt  very flimsy and tight.  She could tell as soon as she tried it on but unfortunately she didnt know how to return it. I told her I would try to contact Amazon which Im doing now. Any help would be appreciated.  Helen T. Harris
2.0,"Unfortunately, got holes in them on the first day. Blisters too. Not for hiking, but good for just wearing as a warm fall sock with boots."
2.0,It was definitely longer than advertised as well as much looser. It was also see through
2.0,"The 2 tops fit like a large, the bottoms fit like a bad muffin top-getting small. Quality was ok for the price which is why this got 2 stars. Didnt get down to return it in time so just a waist of money:("
2.0,"They ran small, waiting to hear if i can exchange"
2.0,My wife says that the bottom was too long (she is 5'3) even with wedges. The top part is way too tight (C cup).
2.0,"This dress is so cute. But so so cheap. The fabric is very thin and definitely see through. Also, it sheds nonstop. I have purple fluff coming out in bunches. It'll be a hand wash and hope I get more then 2 wears."
2.0,Nice material but doesn't stay up on your arms
2.0,These flip flops had very little cushioning and flex from front to back. They are a full size to small. Overall not comfortable and could not recommend.
2.0,Not as expected. Runs very small and cheaply made. I should have read the reviews!
2.0,Beautiful dress I ordered it for my brother graduation wasn't able to wear it because it is extremely small I am a 3X I ordered 4x for extra room I'm going to turn it into a maxi skirt dress is an amazing idea has pockets that's why it gets the two stars
2.0,"My kids are very little and these are still very tight fitting over their heads.  Once on their face, it looks like their little noses are getting crushed.  They also say it feels like a swimsuit and feels cold (which is good on a hot summer day, I guess).  Back to cloth masks, I guess."
2.0,"The item is a fairly weak magnet. It can easily be pulled apart and you will lose your jewelry. Partially my fault, because I didn't realize that was the only way it stays attached. A stronger magnet may have worked better."
2.0,Arms got loose and broke off of both pairs. Disappointed as I liked everything else about them.
2.0,Thin material & too large to stay in place.
2.0,"I loved the first set I purchased, as the color perfectly matched many of my clothes, but this time it was definitely not teal. It was more of a flat pea green and is nowhere near as beautiful a color."
2.0,Poor quality.  Faded and got lint after first wash.
2.0,"The color and design of the purse is great except the handles are short so it doesn't lend itself to a shoulder bag unless you use the long strap which for me at 5'4&#34; is too long.  However, that wasn't the major problem...that would be the smell.  It smelled like a stable and no matter how much perfume or scented flyers I put in the bag it still smelled after a month.  Then the zipper came lose from the end that holds it down and one of the rivets that hold the decorative straps on the side came off so the strap fell down.  As always Amazon was extremely accommodating about returning the bag and giving me credit.  Too bad it must go back."
2.0,"After three months of moderate wear (a few days a week). these shoes are disintegrating. The top layer of fabric is pealing off of both shoes. If you're only looking for a few months of use, these are fine, but I'm surprised that something I spent almost $20 didn't last long enough for my toddler to grow out of them."
2.0,"Although it's cute, its much smaller than picture and in my opinion not appropriate for a little girl"
2.0,I thought it had a little stretch to it
2.0,"Somewhat small. I stretch, the chest came up too low,, :(<br />$5 ~ well... I guess I'll just keep it and donate it to goodwill later."
2.0,This item did not look like I expected. The V wasn’t nearly as deep and the “black” color that I ordered had blacks and greys. The one I received had a significant amount of browns and tans. I usually wear an XL (14-16) and ordered an XXL. The waist was Right under my bust and the belt wasn’t remotely long enough. I returned this dress and am hoping to order it again and get the correct dress. Also the label says 90% polyester and 10% spandex. The description online said 100% polyester
2.0,"I really liked the suction and the view of the underwater world, but the rubber seal fell off after 2nd use."
2.0,Too small and very thin.
2.0,"Run small, toddler size 5T and definitely too small.  Cute design"
2.0,Cute for the price... Looks a little cheap... I like it tho...
2.0,It was tight in the breast area and the decoration is just screen print; which  I assumed wrongly it was actual lace. It looks so nice in the picture but just not made for a 2xl person
2.0,Nice as far as just the gloves but the touch pads are the worst I’ve ver had.
2.0,"Upon first opening the color is bright, neon green, which is what I was hoping for. Owning a bigger watch finding bands that fit my wrist, I have tiny wrists, is difficult for me. This band allows to tighten enough that I felt confident to wear working out, which you want tighter than during normal day use. However, this band is impossible to put on by yourself, you have to have someone help you because there is notch on the loops to help keep the band locked but makes it really difficult to thread the band through. This is keeping me from using the band altogether. I take off my watch to charge every night."
2.0,"This dress does not seemed to be made for someone with any kind of chest.  I ordered a large and the waist band was up on my bra.  I wear a 34DD  and usually wear a size 10.  It just did not work for me.  If the waist was where it should be, it might have been fine.  I am returning."
2.0,"Very cute. My daughter (8 yrs) kept complaining that the ankle buckle kept scratching her. Also, the sole tore away from the shoe in less than one month. Yes, my daughter is hard on shoes, but if you make a children’s shoe, I feel, it should be more durable."
2.0,"Looks nice, doesn’t keep time, or date.<br />Because this watch doesn’t have a month setting you have to continue resetting the date.<br />Don’t waste your $$"
2.0,Nice shorts that are way smaller than sizing suggests.
2.0,Not the greatest quality and fit way smaller than my normal size.  I was very disappointed.
2.0,This are ridiculously small.  I waited too long to try them on and now stuck with them. Maybe order 2 sizes up?
2.0,It didn't look as how I expected also the material was too cheap!
2.0,Its see through and looks bad with underclothes
2.0,I’m 5’3 123 lbs and the medium was too tight even though small is my usual size. Also the cut of the shirt is just awkward (especially in the back) and it’s uncomfortable to wear. Feel like it rides up my armpit and overall it’s just unflattering.
2.0,"Super disappointed. I ordered an XL so I would have a loose fit, like the picture. It is skin tight and so short, like almost a crop top length. 👎👎"
2.0,The plastic sleeve inside to hold the drivers' license was cracked. This was a gift.
2.0,"I wanted to like this so much but it was just too big. It was too long and too boxy up top, the neck line was weird also kind of like wearing an old fashioned wedding dress. The back is very see through so it would need a cami under it for work setting. Overall not flattering."
2.0,Cheaply made. Broken in 2 days just from removing.
2.0,The case is very pretty and sturdy. I was only able to use this for 2 weeks because my cards eventually stretched the card area and started falling out all the time. Can't idk losing my money!
2.0,"This is great if you're a 19yo with nice perky tits or have a fresh boob job/lift. There is absolutely no support for your breasts, so they just look saggy. I returned mined."
2.0,"The OZERO gloves have the potential to be great, but there are some serious flaws so proceed with caution.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Warmth<br />- Waterproofing<br />- Smart phone touch screen tips<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Sizing - runs small order a size up<br />- Lining - comes loose and gets bunched up in the fingers rendering the glove unusable<br /><br />I wanted to love these gloves but they were a little short even after ordering a size up and then the lining bunched up in the fingers making them unwearable.  I would have returned or exchanged them but I missed the return window.  So out in the trash they go.  There are a lot of great reviews for these gloves, maybe I received a defective pair.  Proceed with caution before investing in these gloves."
2.0,Necklace arrived with no earrings.
2.0,"I would not recommend. Cheap,Made in China socks. Spend a few more bucks for a better pair that will last."
2.0,It's very cheap looking.  The zippers don't open/close smoothly. I would not buy again.
2.0,This went down to the knees so it didn’t work for me at all
2.0,The facts that the blue circle fell out when I took it out the package
2.0,"I bought this product almost three months ago. I was able to wear this outfit 3 different times. On the third time the zipper broke on the side. Now it is a completely useless outfit and a waste of money. I am very disappointed that I only got 3 uses out of this dress. I received a lot of great compliments on it when I was able to wear it. I loved it before the zipper incident. It fit perfect and made me feel great. I never even used the zipper, was able to just place it over my head. Zipper is a cheap product and not even needed on the dress. I would NOT buy another dress from this company, especially if it involved a zipper."
2.0,"Order DID NOT include the pins to install onto watch.<br />We looked for the small clear bag, it did NOT exist.<br />Very disappointed."
2.0,cant wear this top is too tight for comfort
2.0,Fabric is light weight and again sleeves are too long.  Not what I expected
2.0,"I was not expecting much for $32 and had read the reviews carefully. The watch does not look like the image but looks like it's 100% dark black plastic unless you scrutinize it very closely under bright light.  That's fine-- I expected that after reading the comments. I liked the watch and got a complement or two on it and have worn it every day since receiving it late January. Unfortunately I looked at it this evening and noticed a big old crack across the crystal.  I have dropped many watches over the years, mostly cheap ones, and never broke a crystal before. I absolutely can not think of anything that has happened to damage this one.  So-- probably some sort of defect at play.  I didn't expect it to last forever but would have liked to get at least 6 months out of it."
2.0,"It worked relatively well for a while,  then it seemed to slow down, and not keep the time accurate. Now 9 months later it has stopped working,  it will no longer rotate"
2.0,"Unfortunately the fit was far from what I expected and I'll be donating to goodwill. Bummer, because it's a really cute concept."
2.0,I got it with a piece broken.
2.0,"I expected it to be more flowy, but it was tight around the butt. I am a true size Medium and I ordered a medium. I am returning it."
2.0,Mine was not shiny and pretty like that. It’s dull and I never heard back from the seller. But I like it enough to wear it. :)
2.0,The strings get tangled and caught on everything.
2.0,Wife is a huge Deep Space Nine fan so of course I picked this earring out very cheaply made don't expect it to last long
2.0,The hat itself is a nice material but is big. It either sits on top of my ears or over my ears and nether is very comfortable. Also the white clips for the sun shields are horrible to slip in the little slits of cloth and gets stuck halfway in and hangs when you try to pull it out! Then there’s these white clips that hang way down all around the hat that are not nice to look at as you can see in pictures so I don’t wear in public... and I just took them off altogether because it got very hot under all that cloth!
2.0,Much to small. Not worth the money
2.0,I'm 5 8 and 230 lbs I got the largest size available and still too small it wasn't long enough for my legs and too tight to go up all the way with the shirt nor up over my thighs but it was cute. So if you meet the size require it's looks like the picture and the material is nice. Not that stretchy
2.0,returned. the waist was weird on me
2.0,Cute but not the best quality. Some of them came broken while the others broke down with use.
2.0,"Too small, looks better on picture"
2.0,"I gave this 2 stars because it is a really nice looking purse, but not for anything heavier than maybe a wallet. I used it for little over 1 week to go to work with my ultrabook laptop which is less than 4lbs, my wallet, and a planner. Already one of the straps were coming apart at the seams, see pictures. I was really disappointed since this purse was perfect, but alas the quality of the straps is not reinforced enough, which is just not acceptable since many women carry a lot of items in their purses!"
2.0,The straps detached on 3 out of the 4 purchased the first time I washed them. I will have to hand sew them if I want to continue to wear them.
2.0,"Wow. So freaking disappointed. Saw the other review but thought it would be a 1 off. Ugh! The kurta is Pink - not a soft Mauve. The sharara is Maroon- not any shade of Purple.<br /><br />And at 2x, it’s tight. I bought the black/gold lengha which was Awesome.<br /><br />This was supposed to be me birthday outfit. 😖"
2.0,Too low cut
2.0,"We're avid wakesurfers and use changing towels all the time.  My wife has a Roxy one and I have a Ho Stevie from Amazon. Compared to the others this is very thin and cheap feeling, it's not plush or warm. It looks nice  but you can feel the silk screen or ink on the outside and feels kind of crusty.  My wife likes the looks of it and will use it for the hot summer days but this isn't warm enough to use in the spring and fall when changing out of a wetsuit ."
2.0,"I'm surprised at all the 5 star reviews. I can only assume those were written by people bargain hunting (who've maybe never owned a truly nice watch). My Suunto watch is at the repair shop, and I just needed a temporary/backup watch. But even at the sub-$50 price point, this doesn't feel worth it. The band is a cheap ""conglomerate"" fake leather. And it's made for fat dudes. I literally need to punch additional holes in order for the strap to fit my wrist (I'm very active, but I don't have child-supposed wrists by any means). The setting knob is so sensitive that it's almost impossible to get an accurate time/date adjustment. And the watch just feels cheap. Like something you'd pick up at Target."
2.0,"I ordered a 2x expecting a small band size, what I did not expect is not being able to fit into the cup because they are far too small. I’m only a c cup and while that’s not terribly small it’s not that large either and being that it’s supposed to be a 2x I expected it to be fine. A b cup might fit but anything over will not. That being said if you have a smaller chest this does appear to be of decent quality, though the gem on the front is barely secured (I don’t like the look of it anyway). And if the band size is too small you can easily take a pair of pliers with cutters on them and clip off the metal piece meant to adjust the band and secure the extra straps onto the ends for a tie up bralette."
2.0,"i ordered double X to insure skirt would fit nicely, but the sizes are obvioulsy mislabled"
2.0,way bigger than I expected
2.0,"Very cute- but the pin i got fell off every single time. Tried switching the backing back I thought maybe that was the problem but nope, that fixed nothing. It was a really cute pin and i loved it before I lost it because it constantly fell off."
2.0,"I was very disappointed when I got this costume in the zipper, it was a nightmare, it didn't want to budge, very poor quality hence almost impossible to get up and down. Also the seams are poorly sewn and look like they are coming apart. I feel it runs a little big, I ordered a small and it was not tight, a little loose. I am 5'3 and weigh 119. Buyer beware once I got the zipper down to get it on and then finally back up, I could never get it all the way down again, makes using the restroom complicated. Keep looking if you are thinking about buying this."
2.0,This bag broke where the strap is sewn to the bag the first week I used it. :-( Bummer.
2.0,"Purchased because the original Fitbit band would break and fall off. The material is better than the original Fitbit so it doesn't break where mine broke (twice). However, this band cannot stay on! Idk if it is the clip or the holes in the band, but I am picking up my Fitbit from the floor more than I was when I was using my original broken Fitbit band!"
2.0,difficult to use!
2.0,"Pretty cheap, and not much to look at. Got it for a kid to play with."
2.0,These are really cheap looking. The size of the studs were also either too big or too small.
2.0,I really liked these until<br />I washed them a few times and the stitching gave away in the crotch.  I can’t wear them anymore....well you know why!
2.0,It was only long necklace length. Was not as described.
2.0,Cheap material. Ripped on the first wear.
2.0,The vest runs quite small by American standards.  Suggest you definitely buy 1-2 sizes larger.  Ordered a 2x - ( he wears 1X ).  It is too small returning for a refund.  Putter texture seems rubbery.  It has a thin liner that feels like thin fleece.  My husband decided he didn’t want it replaced.
2.0,"I should have paid more attention to the material. Stainless Steel is not easily bendable. I love that they don't have the ball on the end, but its awkward in my nose and doesn't lay flat so I have lost all but one.  I recommend this for someone with a wider nose."
2.0,arrived well after expected shipped date - too large
2.0,Not the material i expected! Again too small and i ordered a 3x expecting it to fit not baggy like in the pic but at least fit. I felt like i was trying on junior sizing.
2.0,Way smaller than the picture looks. May have to order another style.
2.0,"I received this product as promised.  The Tuile was well done, but the white liner and blue liner seams were unraveled. There was no repair.  The Liners were tighter than expected."
2.0,"I ordered a size up to be safe and it was still too small. Very cute, very good quality, just too small."
2.0,I normally wear a xl  and  this was way to big on me . I love the style and was upset  by the sizing so i say to others please down size  by one
2.0,"As of right now I am rating this 2 stars....and that's generous. I ordered this for my son in an XL as it is MENS and ADULT. It is cut crazy small. Barely a Large by most standards. I was willing to say this happens and have tried to contact so I can swap for a size up, that should be all I need. All I seem to be able to do is return it.....at a COST of $5+ to me! So plan to go two (or 3) sizes up and hope you dont have to contact."
2.0,I took these with me to the beach and now the UV protection the glasses has bubbled up. Not really happy right now.
2.0,Really pretty but the ticking is sooo loud
2.0,The box of the tie looks old and since I got it to give a present I had to do it without the box.
2.0,"Cute and spacious, love the fringes but the leather on the handles is already peeling off."
2.0,Fits really snug. Paper thin material.
2.0,"The XL looks more like a child's size.  They were too short for me at only 5'4&#34;.  Most sweatpants stretch enough to fit me in an XL, but these don't even come close.  Will be giving away to a MUCH smaller friend."
2.0,"Too tight and size not ture,price too  high."
2.0,"This dress does not look as it does in the picture. The material is very stretchy, so I believe it would fit most people. I am 5'1, 180lbs and this dress is not very flattering considering it is marketed to plus-sized women. The dress has very little shape and is very clingy. However, the price is not bad, so it may be worth the gamble."
2.0,"feel good and nice material, but sized way too large to wear"
2.0,This dress cut pretty low. The material was okay. The fit was terrible. Tie is in a weird place. Not the dress for me.
2.0,"First of all, this dress is really cute and I’m a petite female so I love these kinds of dresses. However, the material is very cheap. I’m not sure because of whether it’s 100% polyester or what but I felt like I was wearing plastic bag. I tried it on and it ended up ripping on the side of my waist so be careful."
2.0,"Wasn’t crazy about this on me but was true to size and decent quality, sent back"
2.0,It just didn’t fit the way I thought it would. I know I can take it to a tailor but it was for a quick trip so it wasn’t worth that. Thought the color looked odd with my light skin as well.
2.0,Way too small even to use for a tie!!
2.0,The shirt might have been cute but it came with a big ink stain on the shoulder
2.0,"Mask was not delivered via Prime as promised (not seller responsibility ). Mask thinner than expected, material is a silky finish. Will keep but will not buy again."
2.0,"uncomfortable, even if it weren't too tight."
2.0,Flimsy Nose wire breaks and pokes through fabric and right into my son’s skin.  Happened on multiple masks.
2.0,Just didn't look good on me. I looked like I had a maternity top on.
2.0,cute pattern but was streached out in the neck and way too long in lenghth and sleeves are too long
2.0,"The point of the heart isn't reinforced in any way, so it rolls up into itself making the cut out look like a circle with a point. I plan to embroider the edge of the cut out with a stiff thread to see if that will help it keep its shape."
2.0,Total crap. My fingers are a size 6 and three out of the pack were even too small to go on the top of my pinky finger. Guess u get what u pay for
2.0,The material is rough and the cut is nit flattering
2.0,Awful fabric and pattern..
2.0,"Not as described and when I took them to our local jeweler, I was informed that they aren't even black crystal! RIP OFF!"
2.0,"These were very cheap and thin and there are only two colors, pink and blue"
2.0,"This dress is not the same length as pictured. I am 5""2' so I always expect dresses to be a little bit long on me, but this dress goes way past my knee. Unless the model in the picture is 7ft tall, this dress should not come down that far. Trying to decide if its worth returning or finding someone to hem it so that its about 10 inches shorter. Disappointed because the length gives it a completely different (50's church dress) vibe."
2.0,This watch band looks and feels good. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the pin between the links fall out. I have lost 3 different pins and you dont realize it till the watch falls off the wrist. Because of this I would not purchase again
2.0,"Bad grammar, but acceptable for the price"
2.0,"Runs very small, and for the price disappointed in the quality; very thin."
2.0,A little too much advertising on this cap..i didnt see one like i saw on the show..blsck on black...while my husband appreciated it...doubt if he wears it...
2.0,I barely wear them now as they fit snug on the waist but they are so baggy from there down. uncomfortable!
2.0,"I really liked this bracelet but it fell apart right away, I didn't catch it on anything I was litteraly sitting on my couch and it fell apart.<br />Make a high quality one and I would pay more and buy again.<br />But this one don't waste your$$_"
2.0,Not attractive piece.
2.0,"I purchased the gloves for my 10 yr old grandson and they tore after one day, so not very sturdy product."
2.0,"Warm coat, fits well through body except hood is ""much smaller"" than pictured. Overall quality good but really cheap faux fur around too small of hood."
2.0,"it was not as expected, instead of returning my 5 year old wanted it for dress-up, so i gave it to her."
2.0,"ordered a size 38,  (I wear a 36) the belt that came was more like a 32 not even close!"
2.0,Not what I expected.  Not at all soft.  Felt like a stiff cheap shirt with a crispy iron on decoration.  Returned.
2.0,"Even the ring is beautiful, ring size chart is not right. I bought one as gift following the size chart and size was huge. Also, because return/exchange is over due time I am not able to exchanged for smaller size. Very Disappointed!!!"
2.0,"Cute design for sure . Customer service was good but I had to return them, because I believe quality is not good especially for the price. Stability was not good as you can see in the picture. We only tried them twice and had to return them . Now I have to research for this all over again."
2.0,"I ordered a youth  large and the arms went past the knees.  They honored the return.  I had to order a medium separately.  I ordered a replacement and it had a tear in the mouth, I was so irritated that I fixed it myself instead of returning it.  The only reason I am giving this supplier two stars is that it made my nephew very happy to have one."
2.0,The hat is misshapen and cannot be straightened.  It is too large for an average size head so it keeps sliding down obscuring view.  If this fit better and was not permanently bent I would love it.
2.0,"These pants are quite see-through, but the biggest problem is that they are too short! I'm barely 5'5 and if I wear them on my waist, they end at/above my ankles. It's a super awkward length, not capri nor full length. If I pull them way down and wear the waist on my hips they are the correct length, but I'm really not going for the early 2000s low rise fashion...<br />Otherwise the print is cute, so for a shorter person they might work great."
2.0,Ordered these for my wife for Valentine's Day.  PJ's that were supposed to be a size M (8-10).  They were instead a Small which were a big disappointment.
2.0,"If you're above 5'6"" this will be too short"
2.0,Really not what i thought but i will keep it.
2.0,"***UPDATE - I lost it after a few days because it wouldn't stay in.  I think the wearable length is too short and the bulb on the end isn't big enough to keep it secure.  What a shame because it wasn't cheap and it was ADORABLE too.*** This nose bone is super cute, and I like the design a lot.  It's a bit bigger than most of my pieces but not bulky or oversized at all.  I would say that the little cz in the center is 1.5 mm. The star surrounding it is nicely crafted, smooth and shiny, and also lays flat against my nose.  It is very low profile and didn't snag on my towel when I washed my face.  If you have a thicker nostril this probably will not work for you.  The bulb on the end required a little push to go through, but nothing painful. I can't feel it at all now that it is in."
2.0,"See the Pics attached. Charged around $12 + tax, sticker price says $8. Claims it is a Solar Shield product, which is a particular brand. This one is ShieldZ."
2.0,"The sizes seem to vary in shipment.  Also, the leg seam rips with minimal pull."
2.0,Would have thought that the product would have been thicker than what it is.
2.0,I got these for my thirteen year old daughter and they barely go up mid calf on her. I don't know how that could be considered over the knee socks.
2.0,"It’s a weird stretchy fabric, I was expecting it to be cotton-ish."
2.0,"First off the ""bling"" Christmas tree was off center and crooked, made of a thin layer of polyester and fit nothing like the picture. There is a big opening on the sides when you put it on. Other than that its pretty. For $7.99 I was expecting quality, at least , like what the local retail stores are carrying. And had to wait over a week to be dissapointed."
2.0,"This shirt is not true to size. It fits small. Go up a size more than what you would normally by. Overseas company. I chose not to return it, I’ll just give it to a relative!"
2.0,I literally had to pull the zipper apart because it got stuck so bad.  Would not recommend buying this particular jacket.
2.0,I’m returning item.
2.0,Watch broke multiple times. Each time we fixed it without problem. Then it broke for good. Only had it 4 months.
2.0,First the care instructions say to dry clean?<br />I ordered a medium and it’s HUGE.  Not a fan.
2.0,Wasn’t a fan of this bra so I returned it. It wasn’t supportive enough for me.
2.0,Shirt is too small despite ordering my size.
2.0,"Good material but its runs too big, a L is like XL. Deffinitly it was return."
2.0,Looks like product didn't work well on my body but i love it.
2.0,"The hats are good quality; but, for the price, I expected stitched graphics.  Also, the stripes are iron-on tape.  Very disapointing."
2.0,"I am 5.9 175# and the large fitsngreat. The fitnand feel of these are great, but I should have listened to my gut and not ordered white because it is SEE THROUGH. I Even asked if the white was see through and mulitple people said no, but they are. I could literally read the tag through them before I even tried them on. I'll have to return but I'll probably get them in a different color because they are VERY comfy and soft"
2.0,super long and then tight at the bust line.
2.0,It came to me with stains on it that I couldn't wash out. It also smelled bad.
2.0,"Way smaller than expected, can't see design at all"
2.0,Gave it two stars only cause it’s not reflective but over all a comfy band
2.0,even though I ordered half size big they were still so small I could not even get my foot in
2.0,The top part stays but the legs constantly roll up. Not very comfortable.
2.0,Great pants but the size runs to large. Had to return.
2.0,"Its alright. I looks like a tie and everything and certainly functions as a tie but i have a hard time believing this is silk, it feels nothing like the two dozen silk ties I have."
2.0,Its sized to small to be a 2x.
2.0,The picture is very misleading. Runs very small- if you're not tiny it will not fit you like this.
2.0,Hat didn't fit
2.0,"Could’ve been so much better. Completely see through in the chest, cheap material on the sleeves, loose frayed stitching around the cuffs. Disappointed, but you get what you pay for."
2.0,"I ordered a Large and it was too small. I should have gone up to an XL. My hips are about a 42 so I should have known better. I had to alter the butt area to fit my cheeks and that's when I knew the product works and give you a shapely butt when you buy a size bigger than you normally wear. .I give it 2 stars because the material is sturdy, there is no tummy control whatsoever. If you have bigger thighs these bad boys will roll up and it will be pain for days."
2.0,For $ 16 I would think it would be a little better quality.
2.0,not what we expected
2.0,not so nice
2.0,"Did not consider the fact the straps show when I sit down.<br />Should consider the straps that conect to your sock.<br />Cost of returning was half the cost of the item, to much hassle to return.<br />Will modify the straps myself"
2.0,OK sweatshirt but is cheaply made—lots of loose threads.  Main problem is the inside lining sheds and pills a lot.
2.0,I like Ellazhu for having oversized clothes but this one was too big.  And there were alot of loose strings.  I returned it.
2.0,These should be super cute but are just cheap. The red seems faded and my tassels are sticking out all crazy ways. I can’t seem to tame them. I would not recommend.
2.0,Not a high impact bra
2.0,"Love the watch, but it does not work.  Guess I will have to try to replace the battery and see if that is the cause."
2.0,"They were very snug and I had a hard time fitting my arms through. If you have any sort of body fat on your arms, don't get these. The strings that go around the fingers were very flimsy and felt weak. I was afraid to tug on the sleeves for fear they'd tear. The beading was only thing I liked about these gloves though."
2.0,Too tight around the waist
2.0,Very dissappointed-the band doesn't stay tight and it is uncomfortable. A hassle to return so I'll probably gift it to one of my very skinny nieces.
2.0,"I’m 150 lbs and a 34Dd. I purchase a large, it was snug on the top but fit long and loose from the waist down. I don’t think it was flattering.<br /> I considered a smaller size but the material is not super stretchy on top."
2.0,"This jacket is way too small. Even though the customer reviews indicate the jacket fits 48% correct, it should be more like 30%. I ordered an extra two sizes larger and it still didn't fit my husband. The sleeves were too long and the jacket zipper wouldn't close. I would not recommend buying this jacket."
2.0,"I am disappointed with this necklace. The quality is okay but the design is sloppy. The names encircling the pendant have odd spacing. The o in Jophiel is like a degree symbol. The center is,an odd mishmash of angel wings, heart and ankh.It seemed like someone had lots of ideas but did not take time to execute them attractively. The back of the pendant has the words ""unique inspired by nature"" which has nothing to do with the front of the pendant. At least the chain has a lobster claw clasp."
2.0,Didn’t fit me well but every face is different. Too warm and didn’t cover my nose well
2.0,They would of been so cute too :(
2.0,One of our four year old grand kids chocked on these and they had to pulled out of his throat . Don't recommend . Too small
2.0,"I Ordered the yellow lenses because my girlfriend needed some night driving glasses.  The glasses I received appear to be WAY WAY DARKER that the order page shows them to be.  These glasses cannot be worn in low light situations or for night driving!  These have dark Amber lenses and are ok for SUNGLASSES, NOT NIGHT DRIVING GLASSES!!  Guess the search continues to find light yellow polarized glasses for her night driving needs. BURNED!"
2.0,Not what I was expecting. Quality not great. Not easy to figure out how this is supposed to be fitted. Has lace at bottom and seam down side. Confusing !
2.0,"I’m a size 4-6 and the medium was way to small, it’s very firm fitting instead of cute and baggy like the pictures, I’m very disappointed."
2.0,The color I ordered was beige. It is not beige. It is definitely 100% gold. Would definitely recommend updating colors.
2.0,This ring is pretty much just a piece of metal twisted in to a ring. The ends are open and get snagged on everything. Delivery was right on time.
2.0,It is warm and comfortable abut the item has more creases and wrinkles than the model photo would suggest. The product is way more sloppy than I expected.
2.0,"I would definitely order a size or 2 up if your child is a lil chubby OT was to long in the legs for my son but way way to small in the thighs, butt and belly area"
2.0,"They keep you warm, but after swimming in the cold weather, with cold hands it's nearly impossible for me to peel off because they're so tight at the ankle/lower leg. I wear a 7.5 in shoe and ordered a small. Maybe a size up would have helped."
2.0,"I like wearing sunglasses and was looking for a better pair of sunglasses. i found these and received them in the mail. i loved the design and loved how they fit and loved the lense's they put in them. After about two weeks of wearing them, the lens fell out when I put them on one day. maybe it was just this pair but I was a Lil upset that my new sunglasses broke on me without damaging them. id love to get these again and try them out I'm just afraid they might fall apart"
2.0,"I've only had it for a little while and the rolling part in the buckle (the part that eases the tightening of the belt) has already fallen off.  I was able to put it back in and tried to bend the buckle tight enough to keep it in there, but we'll see how well the fix worked.  I like the leather (seems solid, so far) but I'm disappointed with the buckle.  Frankly I wish it were solid so that I wouldn't have to worry about a part popping off some random moment.  Dang."
2.0,Way too small. Buy a size larger at least
2.0,"Shirt fits the body well, bit the neckline is way too big and looks bulky and gives the appearance that the shirt is I'll fitting."
2.0,Love the shirt but it's way too short. I have to wear a zipped up jacket with it otherwise it would be an awkward in between between a regular shirt and a crop top
2.0,I thought I was getting an adult size hat.  It felt like a child size.
2.0,Ordered up x2 still small
2.0,Love Dooney & Bourke purses. The purse is not red at all. It's more like a burgundy. Disappointed.
2.0,Rotates on my wrist after a couple of hours or so
2.0,Cute choker but very poorly made with cheap materials. I like the design but I have not been able to wear it because the chain is too short. The clasp broke off of the chain after struggling to latch it because it’s so small.
2.0,"The product is ok, but the lenses are very clear and do not work on sunny days."
2.0,It's looks cheap and feels cheap. There was thread comming out of all the buttons and finishes. The loops didn't stay tight on  the buttons. The draw  string barely pulled all the way which made the whole cover up unflattering.
2.0,Well for what I paid I can't be to upset. But it arrived in an envelope and was smashed all to hell. Which leads to all the weird creases and semi crooked bill. Also some of the stitching was coming undone. Gave it 2 stars cuz I still like the way it looks. Just have to doctor a BRAND NEW hat
2.0,"Do not fit correctly, too small too."
2.0,One wash and it looked so worn
2.0,"I figured it was a good deal, but you get what you pay for I suppose, first wash and the graphic was coming off."
2.0,"Nice jacket, good fit and a nice lightweight running jacket. Doesn’t hold up to wear though. Discovered rips from light wear on both sides. Disappointing."
2.0,Runs small and has a small neck opening. I will be returning.
2.0,"I ordered a small and the dress was way too big. I'm about 107lbs. The neck part also doesn't fall to the side like it does in the photo, It's right in the middle so that was a bit disappointing. It just didn't work out for me."
2.0,So cute!! But runs SUPER small!
2.0,"These are very cheaply made. The denim is thin and scratchy and has a terrible chemical smell that doesn't wash out.  The stitching is awful and the pocket lining is made of a plastic feeling poly material, not cotton like most jeans. Even the button is very cheap looking. They also fit really weird and have what appears to be a defective seam that twists towards the front but only on one leg. I wore them once and they've already stretched out enough that they don't stay up."
2.0,I wanted so much to love this bathing suit. I awaited its arrival anxiously only to be disappointed when I put it on.  The print is nice and delightful for the summer very &#34;In&#34; with the current styles and trends and I thought it was sexy. Not many options for sexy one pieces that keeps things where they belong. But the bust area was just too small and my chest kept popping out. It fit perfectly everywhere else and I was surprised that the small black material in the middle was stretched so thin and the folds were sliding to sides of my chest exposing me. I'm only a 36 B/C and I even bought the large to accommodate this but still nothing. I deeply regretted sending this back. I wish the middle section fold were made stronger or up a little higher? I still maintain that it is a beautiful one-piece
2.0,"Very pretty when it arrived but after wearing it just once it changed color and started turning black, had to throw it out, such a waste"
2.0,"Not swim suit material- more like a nylon . Really cute, but feels extremely cheap."
2.0,"The  braiding unraveled immediately where it ties, plus there are not as many beads on as shown, there are 4. I knotted it back myself & put in it my 90% off bin, it sold for 50 cents."
2.0,"These were bought for my bf to wear to his Christmas work party. When he bent down to tie his shoe, the crotch ripped. This happened while at the reception."
2.0,Not what I expected very cheap looking returned
2.0,I really like this bag but after one days use the molle webbings are starting to detach from the back pack. I know it’s not an expensive back but thought it would hold up better than one day
2.0,They are very but kept moving.  The fit was not good for my size 8.5 feet. Also not skid resistance.
2.0,I did not like wording on one of the masks.
2.0,some of the rivets came out
2.0,"Very very small, I wear a 14 and the larger they have looked like a child."
2.0,"The title had me under the impression these were waterproof. The outside is a fabric/felt like material that soaks the water right up, nothing hydrophobic about it. If you can keep them dry they are pretty warm but don’t go making snowballs in them because they’ll be soaked. The touch screen function works fine."
2.0,"Not true to size. Nice material- would wear well, but probably 2 sizes off. Runs small."
2.0,Not as nice as pictured
2.0,"Very stylish and love the shoe's style straight out of the box. They fit my feet well, but because I have a cyclist's calf I can't fully zip them up. Total bummer and I had to return them since my calves will only get bigger during track season and not less."
2.0,Fits small and too sheer.<br />Looks more for lingerie then beach
2.0,"The fit, color, and overall look of these jeans are not what is pictured. The crotch is wayyyy too low. The flare is from the upper calf down instead of above the knee. Im 5'5 129lbs.<br />My first negative review on an Amazon product in 3 yrs. Dang it, I wanted these so bad, too! What a let down."
2.0,"Want to like it. Want to use it. I really do! I love all the compartments and the clutch inside, it was exactly what I want inside a wallet and it would've been perfect! Unfortunately it is bigger and a lot bulkier than I expected(without cards) and even bulkier when I put a few cards and some change in there. There's a huge gaping space when the wallet is closed, even bigger and awkward to close when cards are put into the tight slots. I don't mind the card slots being tight because I know it will stretch in time.But it just didn't work out :( I put a picture of the wallet with a few cards( I couldn't even put all my cards in yet) and some coins and you can see the huge hole I was talking about. It's almost there, the 2 stars are for lack of functionality in design and in the end, I can't use it. I'll have to return it sadly."
2.0,"Very heavy, very think waistline. I thought they would be soft and flowy, they were not. No problem with return.,"
2.0,Way Way to heavy to enjoy. I use it as a throw
2.0,I have been ordering dresses online for the last month in this same size. This dress out of 6 that I have ordered is the only one that did no fit.
2.0,The inside is made of inferior quality material and is very loose so access to stuff sometimes take a while. I have this bag for about 10 months and it has already started stripping off. Would have been a lovely bag if the material quality was better.
2.0,Product is very thin and can see through.
2.0,Not a fit for me. The foot part was too big and the opening was too small. Horrible fit. The opening too tight around my ankle and foot would fold under my toes causing me to trip.
2.0,"I was happy at first, it is not as durable as I believed or hoped. Plan on a short shelf life. It has lasted 2 weeks."
2.0,They are too small they fall a lot i got size0 and they don't fit good
2.0,It's not at all what I thought it would be. Very cheap looking.
2.0,"The pattern and material is very nice, however there is no lining in the top! There is nothing to help keep your girls in for any support"
2.0,It’s a nice suite but not sure if I like the cuff written on it 😂. The jacket is a tad tight around the shoulders.
2.0,Pretty but cheaply made bag (you get what you pay for). Lining of Interior pocket tore within a week of gentle use.
2.0,"These underwear are flattering but overall, they just can't stay where they're supposed to.  They ride up in jeans and or if you're working and squatting - you'll get wedgies and all of the thigh material ends up in the creases of your groin.  Not comfortable or practical for daily wear."
2.0,had this a few months wore daily eventually where the clip fits into the band stretched out and the clip just comes out  from the back when you try to secure the watch in the hole. now its useless
2.0,"I ordered large per the chart provided. The gloves are marked as Large, but they are too small. I gave them to my wife. Order a size larger than the chart recommends."
2.0,Such an unflattering old lady dress
2.0,The fabric isn’t breathable so I’m sure it’ll be hot. Also this definitely runs small so order 1-2 sizes up. Cute shirt otherwise.
2.0,I was hoping for a true board short.  These were too tight.
2.0,Watch Band is horrible!
2.0,"Good quality, length & fabric feel...waaaaaaay tooooo smalllll!"
2.0,Necklace arrived broken.  All the pieces were loose in the bag.  In addition the chain looks unfinished. A shame since the stone quality was nice.
2.0,Not wide enough to put much in to be usable as a purse - for me anyway. The craftsmanship is really good.
2.0,"Fit is weird. Fabric near your side boob is loose. Very clingy material so it will show your humps, bumps & lumps. If you're short it will be long on you."
2.0,"I am returning the product.  The letters look like they will peel off any minute, very cheap and a bright red, not at all the correct color."
2.0,It looked nice in photo.  When it arrived the color was not as expected.
2.0,"They are soft, too soft, with no arch or heel support. Feels comfortable at first, but becomes uncomfortable after walking for a while. Would of returned it after the first long walk. Will try to find insoles to make them more wearable."
2.0,the seam around the waist of the shirt was not sewn in two places...it’s cute but😐
2.0,"I was disappointed in the material. Gave it away, as did not like it."
2.0,"Runs much smaller than,  I  expected"
2.0,"Good assortment of colors, however they are drastically too small to be effectively used as an actual pocket square!"
2.0,Ran really small and extremely tight in the chest area. Busty women beware!
2.0,I returned this item because the Cat image is pixelated so it just looked very cheap. There was not enough cushioning for me not a big enough lip. I got my money back quickly and easily.
2.0,This shirt was nothing like it was described. We received the shirt and was ripped on the side.
2.0,Doesn't really look like the picture and the quality seems pretty bad.  I'd recommend ordering one it 2 sizes larger than you need.
2.0,"Materials soft. Comfy. Red had already gotten onto the white before i received it somehow. In a cold wash it bled all over the rest of the white. I wont be wearing them out of the house so itll work, but the high top is way too high and i have to roll them or they wont stay up. Cute but arent great for me."
2.0,Fit too small.
2.0,"Two stars because although shipping was fast and products were as described, i purchased these as a replacement top for an internally threaded 14g navel ring i have and the screw (the male screw on the ball) was too small to fit (into the female screw on the jewelry itself). It would go in but not actually screw. Seems as though they'd work well in something correctly sized, but unfortunately there is little way to tell!"
2.0,"the top part is really loose, the string the holds it up is really long ."
2.0,"It’s cute, but the zipper didn’t work and it was way too small! I ordered a medium (I wear size 8 normally) and it was a tight squeeze. Also the zipper being busted was an issue, so I can’t even zip it up"
2.0,I ordered this and received the petite charm. It's cute bit I need the larger one. I thought that's what standard size meant.  They need to say petite if that's what they mean.
2.0,Cheap materials and sits very high. Wouldn’t normally pay more than $5 for a hat of this quality.
2.0,They were way bigger than I thought....so I used them as earrings instead.
2.0,"Nice glasses, but the gold and chrome turns after wearing them for a week."
2.0,Cute fabric. Waist was set too high(almost empire) I am 5'4&#34; and bust was very flattening 38c.
2.0,Well I ordered these for everyday use and the first time I put them on the snap on the waist came apart and now will not stay together also the button on the waist will not clasp because the hole is sewn together. The other pair that I had ordered are perfect and as exspected And that’s why I gave them 2 stars but they need to pay a little more attention on the quality control of this product.
2.0,"First, the packaging was poor. They arrived in a plastic bag there was nothing inserted in the boot to hold the shape. I have to remove one of the embellishments belts to get the boot on, the length is ok but the width is wide. The material that is constructed with is very very thin. I will be surprised if they last more than a few wearings. I realize that these are relatively inexpensive, however, they charge $9.99 to ship them.  This being said, the style is nice I will wear them a few times, then throw them away. It is a waste of my time and money to return them. Very dissapointed."
2.0,Not sure if all beanies do this but it wasn’t round at the top when I put it on. I looked like I had horns. I tried to wash it also but still didn’t fit right.
2.0,These socks are extremely tight and I have very small feet.
2.0,"I loved the graphic and HAD TO HAVE this shirt. The fit was more snug than I expected. Definitely size UP one size! I was very disappointed in the crunchier feel of the fabric after I washed it. It shrunk a bit. I returned the shirt and will not be getting a replacement. Had the fabric been softer and held up after one washing, I would have exchanged rather than returned for a refund."
2.0,"In the photo of this hoodie, the material looks to be great quality. WRONG. The material is cheap and has a weird shine to it and it’s extremely thin.<br />If you’re expecting quality, this hoodie is not for you. Quite disappointed."
2.0,The necklace broke after I put it on.
2.0,"I used these on two of our dogs (the most nervous and anxious).<br /><br />When placed on the dogs the collars gave off a very strong soapy-lavendar scent... almost overwhelming to the people around the dogs.<br /><br />After more than a week, no noticeable difference in the dog behavior.<br /><br />I will not be purchasing again."
2.0,I received this as a gift. It fits but it rubs against one side of the watch and I'm nervous it's going to ruin the finish on the watch. Also the buckle is tricky to use. I love the design and feel though. It seems fairly stretchy too.
2.0,"Bought this for my wife so she might wear her grandmothers ring. The ring was very small so the very small tabs of the ring guard fit. However, the sharp, cheap metal of the ring guard dug into the palm side of her finger. Brought the ring to a local jeweler who also pointed out the products flaws and provided her own product - which works. Should have gone to the jeweler to begin with."
2.0,"I'm so disappointed in these earrings. They aren't even 1&#34;.<br />To the seller, you should put the size in the description."
2.0,did not work on receipt nor after I set hands -am reluctantly returnibg it.
2.0,"For me there was two major issues with this dress.<br /><br />1. The bust area where the fabric crosses over is sewn together in a way that makes it look pinned. Like your purposely trying to hide your cleavage in a dress that shows to much. This makes it look really cheap and I don't really understand the point of the extra stitches there to make it look that way. Why not just let the fabric overlap on its own?<br /><br />2. The fabric under the arm bunches weird so if you do the sorority pose in pictures with your hand on your hip (guilty), the fabric just looks odd. It even exposed my bra in some pictures.<br /><br />Other than that it's a nice dress and its very comfortable but it does look like a $10 dress you got off Amazon. I think I'll wear it out and about in the summer rather than to fancy events."
2.0,"With all the positive reviews, I had high hopes for this dress. It just didn't work for me. It wasn't flattering at all. The sleeves stuck like little wings and the length is too long. (Im 5'2 and it went down to mid calf)  The color is actually more maroon/burgundy than purple. The material is nice but I will be returning."
2.0,"The color is spot on to what the picture shows (I ordered the purple)...so that's a plus! But, unfortunately this tunic runs big. I ordered a large and it looks like a 2XL. I will be returning or exchanging for a small."
2.0,"For starters and material is nice. The pink is what it shows in the photo. But I will say I think it is pretty ghetto that you have to tie a knot for the strings so that way you’re able to use it as a cross body bag. Other than that it’s pretty spacious, I have an iPhone 8 plus as well as my keys and a small wallet and I do still have some room. But the string, well I should say the strap that is so that you are able to make it a cross body is pretty cheap. I find it quite dumb that you have to tie a knot on the inside but that’s just my opinion."
2.0,"Way too small.  The return instructions from this maker is very confusing.  Amazon honored the credit to my account.  However, still having issues trying to return."
2.0,"So I bought this strap because it seemed like a great deal for actual handmade Horween on Amazon. However, when I received the strap it was shorter at the lug width than what I purchased at 18mm. I even purchased the smallest size and it was still short. The strap was also cut at uneven widths, tapering shorter to the lug ends, which is opposite of what you want in a nice watch strap (see my pic). Reading the previous reviewer's caution, I emailed a rep from Archer/Helfen to see what can be done. They asked if I tried to install it on my watch to see if it fit. Of course I did, but obviously still shorter than the 18mm lug width. I didn't want to risk damage to my nice watch, so the rep at Helfen said to just return the strap for a refund or exchange at a discount.<br /><br />So I returned it immediately because I didn't want to waste anymore time and effort on exchanging it for another short strap. However, when I inquired about purchasing another replacement strap, but at a larger size, I got no response from the rep at Archer/Helfen. Instead, I got an email saying they were terrible sorry for this experience and to make sure to leave them feedback on the product and service. So I am!<br /><br />For a Made In USA product, I expected quality control to be higher, especially when it comes to lug width and cutting. The quality of the leather is nice (why the 2 stars), but this isn't made by Archer and the customer service was extremely unhelpful. This is especially true when I unsuccessful tried to purchase this item again to give it another chance."
2.0,"I ordered size s, I.m 5.2 , 110 pounds ,"
2.0,Doesn’t look anything like the photo.  Ordered gray which is dark in the photo.  Received light grey and is more brown than grey.
2.0,"Bad quality. Seams off, very poorly made"
2.0,"Does not look like the picture.  Quality is alright, that's why I gave it 2-stars.  Don't have time to go through the process of returning it."
2.0,If I had to describe this robe in one word ...it would be HEAVY !  And it runs big also.  Bought for my 86 year old mother and it weighed her down !
2.0,The value is great but I didn't wear them because the posts had been painted black and the part where the clasp meets was chipped so you could see the silver part underneath. Made it look cheap. Also they were smaller than I thought but looked decently made otherwise. Personally would've liked the post to be silver. Returned.
2.0,"I was so excited for this dress! The fit is nice, a little loose. But it’s so see through you can see my belly button lol. Bummer."
2.0,They aren’t what’s pictured.
2.0,"The watch bands are beautiful, however, after two days of wearing them the steel handle that straps the bands together feel off when I was taking them off after a long work day. It was very disappointing."
2.0,"It looks fine. However, I ordered a large and it barely fits around my wrist. Not worth the shipping fee to return it.<br />Won't buy it again due to inaccurate size."
2.0,I chose this as a gift for a granddaughter who birds and cooks.  She liked it but I was disappointed in the quality of the material.  I expected it to be studier.  She loved it but for the price I paid I had expected more..
2.0,"I gave them 2 stars because after working out in them multiple times I finally realized they were see through. I felt so embarrassed, also I wore them 4-5 times and I already have a rip in them. I just think the material used to make these shorts are kinda cheap."
2.0,Cute shirt but go 5 sizes larger then you would normally wear
2.0,"The green was brighter, more of a kelly green. Chiffon always means slick polyester in my experience. I forgot.  I don't like wearing the material.  The sizing was just wearable but I ordered larger than I am because I like larger.... so order accordingly. The style is as cute as it appears."
2.0,Too wide and too long. Not able to use
2.0,"This item was great on the top, too big on the bottom, and the material looked like a garbage bag on the bottom. I tried using a light iron and drying on delicate (since its sensitive synthetic material) to attempt to get the wrinkles out, to no avail. It absolutely could not be worn. I loved the top, and I'm sure the allover lace ones are fine. I regret not getting one of those!"
2.0,"Almost really cool. I was really excited to get these. When they arrived, all four movements wound and functioned correctly however, the two larger ones pop out of the case as if they weren't fastened in. the only thing holding them was the winder. Another serious issue is there is no cover over the movements. These have tiny gears and the smallest piece of dirt or lint will completely gum them up. If they attach them in the cases and added a clear cover these would be significantly better. as is I'll be returning them."
2.0,Color is not as pictured. It doesn’t look as realistic as I expected. Disappointed.
2.0,I bought 2 pairs and these pants are way too short I order a size 14/16 and they fit size 10/12 way too short.
2.0,"Good material, super cute pattern, but WAY too small! I got an XL hoping for a flowy fit and it fit me like a medium would!"
2.0,Maybe my earlobes are unusually large....I don't know....but they don't wrap around my ear as the picture shows.  They are pretty though.
2.0,I loved the way these earrings looked. Really really loved the look but after a couple days 1 of them broke. I Am Not Happy
2.0,"I was hoping that the Merino Wool would be less itchy, but I couldn't even wear them 15 minutes before they came off.  Plus, the top band is very tight.  Not for me."
2.0,"I’m 5’1”, 32B, was 107lb pre-pregnancy, and I bought this to wear early on in my pregnancy, before I needed maternity clothes. For an x-small (XS), this is way too big and seems more like a Medium. It’s big in the sleeves, chest and torso. And for me, it hit right at or right below the knee, an awkward length for a swing dress.<br /><br />That said, the fabric is soft, and I would imagine this washes well in the washer/dryer. If you are about 5’5” and a 32C, I would guess this would look perfect on you."
2.0,"Extremely uncomfortable. Shoulder strap is way too wide which causes it to dig into your neck and shoulder when wearing. This product is not made for smaller framed people. When adjusted to its smallest size, it hangs loosely on the back. The bag itself seems like it's good quality I'd just be happier if it would fit smaller framed people better."
2.0,The length is a little short! And makes your stuff come out the sides a little! But very pretty and soft fabrics
2.0,"This product has accurate sizing, fits as expected, and is color true. However, I found it disappointing because I have ordered many similar dresses from other makers on Amazon before, and this one has the worst fabric in my opinion. It's a medium-stretchy, medium-thick cotton... think cheap underwear bought in a pack of six material. Because of the material thickness, the dress kind of puffs out from the body under the bust. It doesn't lay nicely, and it's also a touch short (I'm 5'7"" and it is about an inch off the ground). All the other versions of this kind of dress I've purchased before have been a sleeker material that lays much nicer. I suggest looking at similar dresses from other makers instead of this one."
2.0,"They are cute, but too bad they don't fit. Too big. I am returning them. They are a bit flimsy and slip around, so the grippy bottom makes it rotate around my foot. Bear in mind, my shoe size is 5.5 - 6, and I have very narrow feet. So one size does not really fit all. I suppose it would work for larger sizes or wider feet.... maybe..."
2.0,"i give this 3 stars because it is not red, as the description says<br />it's HOT PINK. i hate hot pink., waste of my money"
2.0,Looks very cheep
2.0,Love tgem but they quickly lost their grip and now the do not stay up my arms too expensive to have this problem after only two days
2.0,"Even though this watch is railroad standard, it looked to cheap for the price."
2.0,size runs very small :(
2.0,"I bought those pants for my brother in size M, they were some what small ! But he liked it !"
2.0,"I am a 38DD and got the Xl thinking it would fit. It didn't, it was big enough to just cover my boobs. So for all the girls that are big chested I would not recommend buying this."
2.0,This is a very shear scarf with no stretch at all. It's small and would be pointless to use while nursing.
2.0,Too large is it too late to return it ?
2.0,"I bought this for a Disney Hollywood Studios trip. It was darling and perfect for the day and fit true to size.<br /><br />It fell apart in the wash the very first time I washed it and bled badly on all the other clothes.<br /><br />Great for a single wear, but nothing other than that."
2.0,"I purchased these and gave one to several friends. Every one of them, including me, were not happy with it and have not used it since."
2.0,Great looking watch however I've started to have a problem after a short period of time with the date staying correct it seem to want to always advance every 12 hours.
2.0,Product is labeled a briefcase/messenger bag. It is to small to even hold my tablet and would not work as a briefcase at all.
2.0,Reminds me of Seinfeld's Puffy Shirt.Not good...
2.0,"After two washes, holes started to happen. Won't be reordering."
2.0,After just five wears the swoosh sign came off of one shoe.
2.0,"Compared to the caps I get from Beretta, they look counterfeit!"
2.0,"Disappointed because they are cute, but I am not a fan of the material and they run SMALL!"
2.0,"Bought teal and purple, returning both. Much bigger and clunkier than the picture shows, although the colors are beautiful. If you like clunky, huge jewelry, this is the item for you."
2.0,"too small, not flattering, the stitching that is supposed to go under your boobs was too high."
2.0,I didn’t like the cut in the front it came up higher than expected
2.0,"Material not as expected. I thought it would be a more sturdy, more of quality type of material"
2.0,"If you're skinny and OK with very clingy material, this dress can work for you. If you are thicker with some areas you'd prefer hidden, this dress is not for you."
2.0,"Got this today and was disappointed by how huge it it. My baby will be born in a few days and I was hoping to have something warm for them to wear in a couple months when the weather gets chilly but there’s no way this would fit for a long, long time. Description says for babies and toddlers but this looks more like big-kid size - almost I could wear it! Can’t decide if I should return it or just suck it up and put it in storage for a couple or few years until they can wear it... It does seem kind of soft and decent quality (better than I was expecting) at least. Either way I’ll need to find a different winter hat for the baby to wear during their first few months since I can’t use this. Last pic shows a pair of Gerber 0-6 month hats for size comparison."
2.0,Bought this in a small and it definitely was not a small. It was huge! oh well story of my life clothes are to big. I wish this brand was more size inclusive and carried XS or XXS
2.0,This charm is not great at all it is hard and the fur feels stiff.
2.0,Cheap material with lots of strings hanging. It very see through and you have to wear a slip or everything shows! Defeats the purpose of being cool.
2.0,Sizes are small for adults who are medium built
2.0,Quality is just ok. Sizing is off. Ordered correct size- but it was too small.
2.0,Not the size that it was listed on the description.
2.0,I wear a 14 and the 3x was too small. It makes a cute dress for my 8 year old.
2.0,Order a size bigger than usual.
2.0,Very beautiful peace but it has no weight to it and rides up the cord constantly. The cord fell about within the first hour of wearing it
2.0,"The earrings in reality, are cheap looking. Not very satisfied with what I got. I may return them."
2.0,"I probably made the mistake of not zooming in on the photo from a laptop or desktop computer. I ordered this off my phone. I thought it would be see through gun metal colored glass beads on black. Because the color I ordered just says black #2.  Not black & silver. These are very cheap plastic solid bright silver beads. The kind you get off Hollywood blvd in a stripper store. So it lacks weight & quality. It's just ok, not nice enough for evening wear."
2.0,I got a great deal on this but now I know why. It's got super complicated yet flimsy straps and hangs weird.
2.0,VERY PRETTY BUT ISN'T TRUE TO SIZE...didn't use for photo shoot
2.0,"I have purchased and used 3 other &#34;ratchet&#34; belts, including one other one with the &#34;lift the front of the buckle&#34; release mechanism.  My current purchase of this type, from this company, has not performed as well as the other three.  After just 3 or 4 days, I'm finding that the ratchet mechanism is slipping, getting looser. I hear the click as it slips.  Probably 5 times in the four hours I've worn the belt so far today.  I suspect that the spring mechanism on the release mechanism isn't strong enough.  Lifting the front of the buckle is noticeably easier on this belt than on the other one I have with this type of mechanism.  I have never had slippage on belts with the other type of mechanism (small release lever on the side of the buckle).  While I prefer the easy lift release mechanism when it works, I expect to discard this belt when I get home tonight.  Lesson learned."
2.0,"i need to transfer spray bottle liquids to something like these bottles, with an easy action sprayer.  but the spray must be adequately atomized so it does not make a mess when one uses it, say, for deodorant or facial toner...with this product, big runny drips result.  also, the labels are black!  got white ink, anybody?"
2.0,"Cute dress, just not made well."
2.0,"Very nice, silky material but I noticed that after a few weeks, it was fading. It was a deep purple color but now it’s more of a dark pink."
2.0,the body of the shirt fits perfectly. the arms of the shirt could only fit a stick woman I think... I really don't think my arms are so disproportionately large on my body that they should fit that snugly. I'm giving the shirt to a petite friend but I'm still not convinced it will fit around her arms.
2.0,While this necklace may be great for some...it does not meet my needs or expectations..will try to return...maybe online is not best for jewelry
2.0,"The shirt seems yo be decent quality, the pants though are most likely 90% polyester, i can't read the tag its in a different language. I imagine if you go to your local flea market these outfits could be found among the rows of cardboard boxes on the floor with everything costing under $5."
2.0,The colors bled into the white. It just looks dingy now. Washed once. Also the nude bra lining shows  at edges of suit and makes the top look cheap. And it was full price $$$
2.0,"This tie is not white, it's silver. Have to send it back."
2.0,"Cheap, fit was weird, not as structured as it appears in the photos....floppy."
2.0,I ordered a size up and the shirt was EXTREMELY small. It is a nice looking shirt but I way too tight.
2.0,We got the wine red color in size 12 for our 11 year old and the sleeves seem shorter then normal and the color was bright red and not like the color was described or looked. It’s definitely cuter in the pictures.
2.0,"What I like is that the size was perfect. What I do NOT like is that the color is all wrong and not what the picture indicates.  It's not tan with brown, but white with gray... Why?? It's NOTHING at all like the picture!"
2.0,Will be returning...  Ordered larger and still too small
2.0,"I thought this was a dark navy, however appears to be blue and extremely long."
2.0,"I didn't expect Raybans quality, but I have had these cheap plastic neon shades where the lenses are at least darker."
2.0,Large and frumpy looking
2.0,"I was so excited they had a licensed Harry Potter ring! But I was highly disappointed that the blue bled into the grey within in about a month. I make sure to take my ring off before I shower and put lotion on, so I’m not sure what caused it."
2.0,Way to thin and tight would have to wear something under it so no thanks!
2.0,Oversized sunglasses are the bomb. These are a bit TOO oversized though.
2.0,I ordered large and it was still too small
2.0,Very flimsy. No support. Only for aesthetic use on A cup women. I will probably be using these as head bands.
2.0,Shrinks quickly when washed
2.0,Didn't look like the picture when it came. It was a lighter color and seemed much bigger
2.0,Blue film on glasses has already bubbled and created spots you can see looking through the glasses
2.0,I've been using this bag for less than 60 days and the metal clip on the side for the long strap snapped in half.  Poor quality.
2.0,"cool but i got what i paid for the ""stone"" on top is not a stone its a small piece of cool foil encased in resin basically plastic the actual ring portion is made of stainless steel with a fake gold plating to be honest I don't know if its real plating or not after about 6 months of daily use it the thinner part of it started to fade"
2.0,I love it but it didn’t fit as expected
2.0,"I can say the fabric doesn’t have a good quality, it gets wrinkles so easily, and also I washed and it looks like an old blouse. I don’t recommend it."
2.0,These are way too difficult to get on.
2.0,"They are very nice! Very comfortable but the tail and the decoration of the bunny were missing, so i have one slipper with a tail and the other one is missing. I could return but is too much work."
2.0,"This hat looks great in the picture, but I'm disappointed in it.  Looks-wise, the brim is noticeably narrower than a traditional Irish flat cap.  Why mess with success?  Size-wise, it's a bit snug.  S-M-L sizes for hats means, half the time you get a poor fit.  Worst of all, the sweatband is uncomfortable.  It's scratchy.  I'm not going to wear this hat very often.  If you can't try it on first, you may want to pass on this one."
2.0,Not the type of material I expected though
2.0,"I love elephants, so I was so excited to buy this. It broke in 2 days and I lost it. I was disappointed."
2.0,Don’t like how it pushes my boobs up<br />Not trying to show them off trying to hold them down so they aren’t bouncing when I’m trying to run
2.0,The zipper broke after the 2nd week on the grey bag.  I guess its not for every day use.  Very disappointed other than that  which is important to carrying items the bag hold what you need to go to work and school.  Just the zipper cant keep up.
2.0,"I would not recommend this crop top for 2 reasons. The first one is because the material is uncomfortable. I think I will use it just when it's cold, because it is made with the kind of material that itches. And secondly because it is too short. I thought it was going to be longer, but I can't raise my arms, otherwise I would flash everyone but it looks really pretty though"
2.0,looked super cheap and not flattering as shown in the pic. sent it back.. discolored on some parts of top
2.0,"No the glasses are made of cheap material.  Very light, glasses are very wide and don’t stay on your face due to build in nose guard"
2.0,I bought 12-18 month size for my 12 month old and they are huge.<br />Hopefully they will fit in the fall.
2.0,Pants looked very worn a d faded after first wash.
2.0,Smells bad. Don't buy
2.0,"Not the same as advertised, could be vastly improved with the addition of an underwire and better shaped cups.<br /> Due to other reviews, and their size chart, I ordered a M ( I’m usually a S) and wish I had ordered my usual size.<br /> It is comfortable, and with some alterations (and fashion tape) could be cute, but I probably wouldn’t buy it again knowing what it really looks like.<br /><br /> The whole thing is transparent EXCEPT the cups, and it’s very stretchy. The color is a bit different than advertised, and the cup shape is completely different.<br /><br /> I’m 5’3”, about 115lbs, 26” waist<br />Ordered a M, should have gone with S"
2.0,"The pants fit nicely in the bum area and the length is nice but it is “pouchy” in the front. Not really feeling that. If that was different, I would definitely love these pants."
2.0,"can not get the clasp to unlock.  Appears to be good quality, but will have to return if I can't get it open"
2.0,Cute but changes colors
2.0,"Cute shirt, but the proportions seem to be off. It is much wider than it is long which makes it very awkward​ to wear."
2.0,"To small and the light is worthless, it only lights up the top left corner."
2.0,"Although this backpack is a good size and looks good, within two days of buying it a gigantic hole ripped inside. (I was not rough with the backpack in any ways and did not attempt to overfill it). I have had it for about a month now and the two bottom zippers already broke off. I have had it for less than a month with light use and it is already falling to pieces. In my opinion it is poorly made with cheap parts that break easily. It's cute but not practical at all. I do not recommend this product it was a waste of money."
2.0,"Not as nice as other Miabella items I'd ordered sorry to say. I actually had to return due to a defect on one of the posts,which made it next to impossible to take off the clutch. I didn't try to reorder."
2.0,Didn’t like the style or the fit. Material seemed thin. Just didn’t look good on me.
2.0,Ordered a medium and it is it still skin tight
2.0,bad clasp design.  Won't stay on.
2.0,I just receive my package today I was very excited so I decided to try it on to see how it fit I have to say I have a very big butt and the dress fit short on my backside..and the material thin I like the color but I think I will end up giving this dress away to my sister once again..
2.0,"Not sure if they sent the correct size since the inside tag was already cut off. The XL was extremely small so small i dont think the XXL would help much. The material is very nice, but if your a true XL it will be a bit snug. This picture shows a tan XL Tshirts from H@M underneath for size comparison."
2.0,REALLY big.  Look ok- like to wear them to the pool.
2.0,It is easy to use and worked great for a couple months but it’s been for months and now the battery barely makes it through the night.<br /><br />***Update***<br />Now the band is broken.<br /><br />It worked great at 1st but the battery issue and now the band.
2.0,"I didn't pay close enough attention and this is yellow, not silver.  I don't wear yellow.  PLUS, one of the red stones was already loose in the bag when it arrived.  I didn't even bother to return."
2.0,"I really like the look of this bracelet, but the clasp is very poorly designed, and I think it is going to break with little use. At the price they want for this bracelet, everything about it should be well made. Also is quite small. I would not have bought this if I had seen it in person."
2.0,After less than 6 washes there is a rip under the arm cheaply made
2.0,"the green color in the photo is dark and great, but the one received is a very light green... Very light Green 😡"
2.0,"Cheaply made, broke within weeks of purchasing the product. I would not recommend buying this product. Find something that looks like the will last longer and pay and extra buck or two."
2.0,"These are beautiful looking horns, very securely placed on a sturdy headband. However, the horns are far too heavy, and any movement of my head made the headband w/horns slide right off, either front or backwards. I was sad, as they really are lovely & well made. Unfortunately, for my head/hair, they're really unwearable."
2.0,Not that comfy kept sliding up and there hardly any slouch to it
2.0,Lens popped out after just a few days.  I had to return them for a credit.
2.0,Fit a little too small. My biggest issue would be be fuzzy balls every where.
2.0,Broke the day of my wedding. Item is not durable.
2.0,Size 48a was too big for me
2.0,Its a cute pattern but I have a longer torso and it just wasn’t long enough. Plus the boob support is really lacking
2.0,The item has a weird musty smell to it and it's not the leather. The fabric smells very funky. Wasn't what I expected.
2.0,"I ordered this for  a Derby party. The hat arrived in time and is a pretty color and good size. However, it was shipped crumpled up in an envelope! Who thought that was a good idea? It has two huge bends in the brim - I tried to iron them out, and steam them out and neither worked. I would return it but the shipping will cost as much as the hat. I ended up buying a hat the day before the party at Bed Bath and Beyond. This Amazon purchase was disappointing."
2.0,"the fit is VERY SMALL. I ordered a size up, large instead of medium and the fit is probably a small...."
2.0,When you wear the hoodie it feels like something is missing and that would be the pockets. Ther are no pockets! Whats up with that?
2.0,I ordered a 3xl and usually3xl are very big and roomy from other brands. The jacket doesn’t even come together at the zipper. Much smaller than expected. I need it for a Halloween costume so I need to keep it or I would return and reshop
2.0,"They function, but the stirrups never sit right where they come together around your ankle. This particular material will remove and cut your leg hair... both legs now have an area with missing and very short hair."
2.0,"Its a really nice little bracelet, key word here is ""little"". It's made for a small woman or child's wrist and is very flimsy metal so if you try to bend it at all it will break."
2.0,Too big. Not cute.
2.0,I was very upset when my kids wore these for the 1st time it got black.  it's a dirt catcher and hard to clean.
2.0,Very pretty but the cross part came off after a couple days and got lost too easily :-(
2.0,I actually loved these shoes but I can't give them a higher rating bc I haven't had them two months and I don't wear them everyday; well the sole of one of the shoes started coming off
2.0,Bought size 12 for my almost 11 year old. Too small. Bought size 16. Still too small.
2.0,"Cute, but won't last long.<br />Both lenses popped right out of the frames. I attempted putting them back in, but it wouldn't stay put."
2.0,"Much to my surprise, this product arrived from Germany as an import.  In American undershirts, the size &#34;medium&#34; which I always choose, fits me.  Apparently, medium in Germany is something different.  The shirts were too narrow and too long, so I can't use them.  Since they come from Germany, it's too much trouble to try to return them, so I'll just take the loss and keep looking for what I need."
2.0,Product is very beautiful but very flimsy. Broke on day 1 with only two small keys attached. Very disappointed.
2.0,So I got some cool glass but I wanted the pink and the ones I got are obviously blue.
2.0,Beautiful top. How were it is too small. I ordered 2 sizes up and it is still tight in chest and arms. I gave it away
2.0,Super  cute tee with the perfect stretch.
2.0,My daughter has really fine hair so it has been difficult finding clips that don't slip out.  I was excited to find these but when they came in the mail I was surprised to find out that the clip is held in place by two very sharp pointed metal prongs. I'm just not comfortable letting my 18 month old run around with something that can easily gouge her eye out.  Not sure why they are designed this way. I feel like the ends of the clips could have easily been rounded without taking away from their ability to stay in place.  I'm giving them 2 stars instead if one simply because they are a cute design and actually do hold in place well.
2.0,Cute ring but tarnished soo fast! Missed the return window or I’d of gotten a refund.
2.0,"This watch is not my style.<br />It's too low-priced.<br />It looks too cheap.<br />In short, it's a mistake to buy this.<br />I want to return it, but I'm thinking of giving it to my nephew because it's too much trouble."
2.0,So...the lace is white....not the champaign color it appears to be in the picture and it is a bit loose. I would not have ordered it had I known that it was white lace.
2.0,"Extremely poorly made, had it less than an hour and realized the velcro was glued on, rather than stitched, so it was falling apart quickly.<br /><br />There is no adjustability,<br /><br />Shipped incredibly poorly.<br /><br />Would not recommend."
2.0,"I understand that it is cotton , but it is very thin and was afraid it would rip if I stretched it after washing. Not a good purchase if your ironing board is not up."
2.0,Smaller than stated size
2.0,Looks like a goggles.
2.0,I have bought 2 pair I use them for work  one pair has already lost its closing device at the waist
2.0,It is alot smaller than shown so i gave it to my 8 yr old daughter she was wearing it and it just broke the day after recieving the only reason you are getting 2 stars is cause it is cute
2.0,"Cute colors, Didn't expect it to feel so much like polyester. I feel like it doesn't breath well, and  I bought them for the gym.<br />I wouldn't order again."
2.0,I really was disappointed it is not the same material min was delivered with a hole in the pants. I just wasted money and threw it away because wasnt sure how to return and it was my birthday outfit.
2.0,"This necklace is beautiful, but gave me a rash :( Really bummed because it's a great length and really pretty."
2.0,"If you have any curves at all, I would suggest finding something else. These are clearly not meant for women with hips/thighs and the label clearly indicates a size M/L.  I typically where a size 18 so was surprised at the fact that these do STRETCH to fit......but they definitely hug in all the wrong places."
2.0,Fake leather earrings too big
2.0,The color is as described but the dress look cheap
2.0,"got lot of compliment at first but within a month, threads started coming off"
2.0,"My package took forever to get here, it got lost.<br /><br />They are waaaaay to small. Won't even go past my thighs definitely not a 3xl."
2.0,I'm 5'2 and ordered a medium but was still too large. The wasitband is too high up. I've bought better quality off Wish for much cheaper. Avoid buying from this seller.
2.0,"The picture on the listing isn't the same bracelet that they send. I received a kid's toy bracelet.<br /><br />Sodial is a good vendor but make sure you want this for a child, not an adult.<br /><br />."
2.0,very thin material and runs a little small. I think if I get one in black it may not look as see thru. Need to return for another size at least
2.0,"Unfortunately, this product does not fit my small wrist.  I don't know that it would fit many petite women.  I have spent way too much money purchasing different watch bands that fit my Pebble Time Steel in attempts to fit my very hard to fit wrist, and I have yet to find one that is one of the breathable mesh that is small enough for me.  The band itself, though, is good quality and the magnet is quite strong."
2.0,Quality 👎🏻
2.0,"then this will work for you. And if you want tons of padding, which I don't want or like, so I removed it."
2.0,"While it looks nice, the zipper broke the first time my daughter used it."
2.0,Not what I expected I gave it away didn’t like the material
2.0,Ordered 2T and they fit more like 24 month. Nice shirts but would recommend ordering 1 or even 2 sizes too big.
2.0,"I thought I would try one of these highly rated $50 HUK shirts: not impressed. These are made in Guatemala and the stitching is unraveling, on a new, unworn shirt. Or did I get one that was already returned. Either way, I’ll stick my Columbia spf fishing shirts. Not recommended, pictures attached"
2.0,handle broke first time I used it.
2.0,"It hangs akwardly - the picture had me believe it basically spans nicely to the shoulders, but it just kind of hangs in a lumpy mass."
2.0,Well I wear them daily. The rubber in the toe and top of foot is cracking. I do spend a lot of time with my toes bent when on one knee gardening. Less than six months wear. Wouldn't recommend.
2.0,"We ordered size small, but these gloves were huge on our elderly mom.<br />Guess that’s an inherent risk we take buying apparel online."
2.0,It would NOT fit in my piercing but all of my other 20gs fit so its definitely not 20g.
2.0,The shirt itself looks beautiful but then you have to put it on. It's about 3 sizes too small and its wet tissue paper thin. Didn't fit anyone in my house unfortunately
2.0,I ordered the XL and it is tiny.
2.0,"An okay watch, but the so called light is almost useless since it's too dim."
2.0,Did not like how it looked on me. Overall I still like the skirt.
2.0,"I absolutely love the way these legging feel. Great compression with full coverage. That being said, I'm disappointed that one of the pairs I purchased already had a hole in the inseam. I've worn them a total of 3 times and washed them once following the care instructions. I wish they held up better because I love the way they make me look after having my baby."
2.0,Soft and cute...about all it has going for it...if you wear a 2x might want to order 5 or 6x...if you wear a medium order xl or 2xl..
2.0,"It is cut very small. It also looks as if it is an undergarment and not something you should wear outside in public, unless you match the material very closely. I still have not found any of my sleeveless blouses that it looks appropriate with. the sleeves are very thick and I even ordered a size larger than I anticipated. I think it's the perfect idea but still have not been able to wear it. After losing 20 lbs it is still not comfortable in material. Now if you are looking to give your arms shape that is what it will do. For me it feels like the same material made from firm control panties. It doesn't have much stretch to it. I don't know how else I can explain it."
2.0,"I bought them for my Halloween Costume, my girlfriends and I were ABBA! Upclose they were two different blue colors, I didn’t care because they were cute and only going to be worn once! They were comfortable to wear as we know most clip ons are not. Get them, but don’t be surprised if you get two different blue earrings!"
2.0,"It's beautiful, the fabric is gorgeous and soft, but way too small and I ordered a bigger size than what I wear because there was a suggestion to do so. I am so disappointed. I wanted to wear it this weekend."
2.0,"Wasn’t sure to do a review or not, since it has nothing to do with the seller or the hat... it’s nice looking hat but, however I’m out $15 bucks bc I never received the hat.. got told package was delivered in the right area.. but maybe someone stole it, try checking with you’re neighbors for the missing package.. So figured I’d at least give it a 2 star, could’ve been more but didn’t get it.. so pretty bummed out."
2.0,"Cheaply made and terribly sized. Nothing impressive with these. I even sized up to a large (I wear a medium in just about everything) and they still cut in at the sides and were too small. I would have done better going up from a medium to an XL. Only get these if you are super into muffin top...<br /><br />I was hoping these would be similar to my much beloved but discontinued Target (Exhilaration brand) underwear. Because they look super similar. They are not. The fit is terrible, the fabric is meh. Oh well."
2.0,It was much bigger than most I've bought in the past...if you have a face that is real wide it will suit you...
2.0,It might work well for roadside visual assistance but the flashlight is worthless and not worth the money.
2.0,This material was rough and not soft. This was a different material than my other tie dye pjs in this style. They also ran a full size smaller. Had to return.
2.0,"The color is correct, and the overall design is the same as the picture but there are a few flaws with this item. The overlap portions of the material (top section) easily fold up so i had to use double sided tape to hold them down. The body of the shirt does not have the folds shown in the demo picture and is instead just a large piece of fabric. The material is soft and stretchy, but also pretty see through. The straps are very short so they more so just touch the shoulders than actually hang like a spaghetti strap would. Maybe my body type wasn't the ideal type for this item, but i haven't had this issue with other Amazon products. Overall, it's a comfy garment but not the cutest or easiest to wear."
2.0,I do not like the feel of the material. You get what you pay for I guess..
2.0,Was a really cute watch but it was broken when received.  Loves the small white band and colors but couldn’t use.
2.0,It’s soooo hot! Like more than others. I don’t feel like the cinch helps hold it up either. Hard to teacher with it on
2.0,"you get what you pay for. my eyes were hurting all the time when i was wering them, too cheam of material."
2.0,These did not stay on my head.  They constantly slipped and I was adjusting it.
2.0,"Like others have mentioned, the side access does gap out making you look funny. There is not stretch to the material there so it just hangs and sticks out instead of pulling back into shape. But the shirt does fit nicely.<br />The color and cut were fine, but returned because of the ""wing flaps"".<br /><br />I do have another short from a different seller that has this type of access and I Love it because it keeps its shape better and has more stretch. If you are flatter chested than me, this may work for you, but not a good material choice for larger breasted women (38DD)"
2.0,"If you wear it while you shower or swim, it'll get fogged up inside and it's quite annoying to take on and off. it could be better."
2.0,Pretty cheap but did the trick on those cold winter days. Also ran very small.
2.0,The dress would have been cute if the collar had been sewed on straight and the buttons were lined up. It was so bad.... Returned.
2.0,"The glasses themselves are very high quality, nice frame, and very nice packaging. However, when testing out the glasses at night; I did not notice any difference in the glare from lights on the road while driving. In some cases the glare mixed with the constant yellow, made things even more blurry to an extent. Especially with large clusters of headlights in longer range distance.<br />They basically just made a yellow hue over everything, and made some darker areas on the sides of the road a little brighter. I cant say I would recommend these glasses for people looking for good anti glare lenses for night time driving. But the quality of the glasses themselves where above my expectation."
2.0,"The socks are pretty, and wide enough — but too short (and I’m 5’4” so we’re not talking about a tall person).  What this means is, they gather around my ankle in no time. Nurse Mates brand fit much better."
2.0,"Just bought this for my daughter for gymnastics camp and on the first day one of the straps broke on it.  Was really disappointed, as my daughter loved the pattern and fit, but clearly doesn't hold up well when worn."
2.0,"The dress was made well except for the neck line.  It's completely uneven, 1/2 of it is higher in my chest than the other side.  It looks so cheap, like a child made it."
2.0,The shoe fits fine but the quality was not as expected.  I've had this maker's product a few times in the past and this particular model of shoe does not reach that level.
2.0,Look cheap and tacky
2.0,Loved the look of this bag but smelled like Colorforms. Couldn’t get it to air out-too much of a plastic smell to use. So sad because I love everything Penguin.
2.0,"The quality of this scarf is as expected.  It is 55% acrylic and 45% viscose (rayon).  It's the color that I have a problem with.  It is not as pictured, or named.  I bought the burgundy.  I was hoping for the rich deep cool toned red that was pictured.  Instead I got what I would call medium dusty rose.  There is a dullness to it that defeats my whole purpose in buying it to add a &#34;pop&#34; of color.  It just looks grayed and old to me.  I work professionally with color, and it is very important to me.  The only praise I can give it is that it was inexpensive."
2.0,"Very long strings and very thin, not the same material is viewed in the picture. Very cheap and itchy"
2.0,"The size is very inaccurate,  I wear a size 8 and could barely get in it.  Once on incredibly to short."
2.0,These are cute and all but they are SO TIGHT. My daughter is a month old and these left purple indents on her forehead. They are like ridiculously tight and the nylon is surprisingly thick.
2.0,Disappointed at how small this was.
2.0,Sold as a stretch bracelet.  It is not.  Cheap lobster claw and chain connection looks like an afterthought addition.  Bracelet is cheap and looks it.
2.0,"Ehhh. The shirt is cute and I really like the color, it fits nicely but theres just a cheap vibe to it. I couldve bought 3 better quality shirts from ross for the price of just this one. It is completely see through so definitely need to wear something under it and the sleeves are weird how they're sewn, the picture makes it look nice and pretty/feminine  but mine is kind of butchy maybe I got a dud but I'm not too impressed."
2.0,"The gauge is too small and too short. They fit kids not adults, but they are pretty. Make them stronger and longer to fit adults."
2.0,"It was way too short along my torso, so it just stretched around my curves and made my body look awkward. Would not recommend it, I even bought a size up to ensure it would fit"
2.0,"Bought this coat for myself in a 2X , which is what I would normally order. I am 5’3” & weigh about 200 lbs. I could not even close the jacket around me to fasten it! The arms were also so tight I could hardly fit them into the coat. Very disappointed with this purchase. Returned it."
2.0,Cute but they tarnish after a few days.
2.0,I was very hopeful about these as I have photo phobia and must wear light protection all the time. I feel like I read carefully about the Fit as it is so important with fit overs. As you can see from the posted Q&A the seller indicates that the temple to temple dimension is 5.7in. In my photo my glasses measure just under 5.5in. For whatever reason the selection to return or contact seller is not functioning correctly. Disappointed
2.0,Bought  large for myself and it fit my 10 year old daughter perfect and she's your average size 10 year old. It didn't look like the picture either very thick and not so comfortable material
2.0,"I love the design on this dress and it could have been a very flattering fit. It's just way too small. I was hoping it could make a cute top, but that isn't the case either. I'm 5'5, 155 lbs and ordered an XL."
2.0,"love the look and the idea, but its very cheaply made, cannot clasp it tight enough myself.  the ring is adjustable  and thin so always out of shape.  chain from ring to bracelet should be adjustable.  if not on your wrist tight it will hang and get in the way and drive you nuts."
2.0,"The sleeves are short, not close to elbow length. And the shirt is very, very roomy. It was inexpensive, so I won’t send it back. But won’t wear it."
2.0,Thin black Frame broke after first week of wearing them.
2.0,The dress was as pictured but it fit so weird and the material was very cheap feeling. I returned it because the top part of the dress was way too large.
2.0,"Cute suit, ran small, and you can see right through it. I waited too long to return, and now I'm stuck with it. Waste of money."
2.0,Doe not keep it's fit.
2.0,I don't expect 13 dollar sunglasses to be good quality but it would be nice if they weren't already broken when I got them.
2.0,Too large and very boxy.  Tha material feels stiff.
2.0,The sizing is way off from the size chart. Size up two sizes to get your size. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Definitely not cotton, soft but polyester, returning it"
2.0,it is too heavy for my hair
2.0,"I  ordered a size  that was too big, but also it is much longer than I expected.  It would look unflattering with a swim mini skirt.  So I returned it.  I had purchased another miraclesuit  and it was much shorter.  I couldn't tell from the picture that it was different from my previous purchase."
2.0,The waistband is too tight. They take very long to dry.
2.0,I have difficulty turning the knob
2.0,"This holder is a little flimsy, just not as stable as I thought it would be. It would work for light earrings, but nothing else."
2.0,"If your kid is big enough to fit these your kid needs real shoes - not these.  These shoes are so huge I can't imagine they'll fit her until she's well past 2 and by that time I think she's need shoes with actual soles and a lining...  These are advertised as &#34;firstwalkers&#34; by they are really just crib shoes.  They don't even have a lining so I think the seams on the inside would rub against her feet if she DID walk in them.  They do LOOK like the picture, which is why I gave it 2 stars, but these shoes are not worth even the dramatically low price because you get what you pay for big time."
2.0,The one i received is a lower price and a button up tunic. Returned.
2.0,poor qualifty.. too large. I should not have bought it.
2.0,"You can see your bra, not recommended."
2.0,The men's ring is A little small for a size 9
2.0,Too thin. I did not like it and will not buy again.
2.0,It is so short. I stand-alone at 5’9” and it doesn’t even cover to the top of my thighs. So disapppinting. No way this is a dress. It doesn’t even work as a beach cover up. Cute style just no way anyone with any height to them can wear it.
2.0,Warning slippers lose their shape and become to loose to wear.  Wore for two weeks and than the slippers were falling off my feet.  I tried wearing think socks but nothing helps.  I stop wearing them
2.0,"It was a beautiful dress but I'm a petite. The dress was to long waisted. The skirt hung down to my calves. I was really bummed. I'm a 36 C ' 5'1 -125 pds. I ordered  medium. But, even if I ordered a small- (& I would) but I need something that hits my knee & isn't so long waisted. So if your a petite it won't fit."
2.0,I like the jacket but the second time I wore it one of the zippers fell off.
2.0,"This outfit is a cheap knock off of a Rare Editions brand outfit I got for my daughter last year. I was thinking this was the same thing. The material is very thin and the fit is very odd. The top is slender through the torso but long and the pants are baggy and sloppy looking but would be way too short in a smaller size. All that being said, my daughter did not notice or care and was happy to have a fun holiday outfit."
2.0,"While the socks look really good, they are somewhat too small and do not fit well enough."
2.0,Cheap stuff made in China is not always worth the hassle. This would be one of those cases.
2.0,Not stretchy material. Not comfortable. Made super small. Stiff. Made for small framed Asian ladies. Pretty dress but I was disappointed.
2.0,"They are warm, so that's a good thing but there is a very shallow crotch-- I've never seen anything like it. and super shiny fabric-- nothing like normal sweatpants. I don't know what to compare it to, but the fabric seems cheap and inappropriate for sweatpants. Also there is an elasticized cuff at the ankles, which I was not expecting. The 2 stars are for warmth. Not keeping them!"
2.0,Very cheaply made. It looks like a product that you buy at a corner in NYC. Not impressed at all. Money not wisely spent
2.0,From the description I was expecting a cloth that would clean my jewelry. I rubbed to clean my jewelry and all it did was take some dust off.
2.0,"Plastic,not worth the money,nothing like the pitcher."
2.0,It was tolerable even though the size was large around the top area.... But the sleeve fell off the first time it was worn. Very disappointed. I'd like my money back because this product is inferior.
2.0,"I really did want to like this because I'm giving as a gift.<br /><br />Sadly I think I may have to return it as the blade seems like it is separating?<br /><br />The design is nice. The case could be better but the blade edge is poor and it looks as if one of the darker lines or layers on the blade is a rut and run of a cracked blade. See pics.<br /><br />I am suppose to giving this as a gift tomorrow and it showed up today, I will now not have time to order something else and may have to forgo giving a gift or giving a damaged blade.<br /><br />This should not have made it past quality control."
2.0,Updated 11/30/21: I’ve only had this hoop a few days and the sparkly part of the hoop just came off 😞 it was stuck on with glue. I don’t mind the gold hoop but disappointed that it doesn’t have the sparkle part anymore.<br /><br />Original review:<br />I bought the 16g 12mm hoop and was a little worried that it would be too big but it fits perfect in my conch piercing! I’ve had this pierced for a little over 8 months now and was ready to make the switch from a stud to a hoop. So glad I did!
2.0,"Love the design.  Great detail.  Very dainty. Expected them to be bigger.  Not a good fit for me, however they will make a great gift for my niece."
2.0,By the picture you would assume the product is like a cardigan a bit on the bigger side. ITS NOT its super small. I ordered a small thinking it would fit baggy like the picture shows. It does not. So order a size up if you want it. But also it doesn’t look as pretty as the picture. Kinda basic white shirt thingy not worth the money. Also if you have big boobs like me it’s not gonna tie all pretty like the pictures it’s gonna look stretched out and strange.
2.0,Was way smaller than I expected.  Very cute bag just wanted bigger not a 6 in bag.
2.0,Not at all like the color shown. I bought 2 different ones same color as shown and they a light neon pink which I already have so I was dissappointed that color is not anything like it appears on site
2.0,Metal hardware is the only thing that is okay and sturdy. The leather is incredibly flimsy. The construction of the flower is flimsy and wont last very long. The middle of the flower is over hotglued together. It's still cute and will use but it is NOT worth 20 dollars. With the price I expect more quality that what I received.
2.0,Tops are small
2.0,"This blazer was promising from the pictures. However, I was overall disappointed. The color and the weave of the fabric is nice, but that is about it. The fit is weird to say the least. The shoulders are oversized and heavily padded. The shoulder seams were also sewn improperly and does not sit well. The body was also slightly oversized. While tailoring would probably fix some of these issues. Paying for tailoring does not seem worth it. It would be better to save up some more and buy a nicer blazer."
2.0,The straps are thin like a plastic bag. I don’t see how it will hold the weight of the apron overtime. The apron itself is nice while very long.
2.0,The sizes are INCORRECT. My son is in a size 7. And this was definitely no 7 in toddlers. Sucks they looked really nice too.
2.0,Returned. Too flimsy.
2.0,Irritated my skin so I had to stop wearing it
2.0,Doesn’t work. There is no instructions and no way to know if the chip is been installed.
2.0,"The dress is TINY, and made out of SUPER thin material. Was super cute, but couldn’t even get it on it was so small. Since large fits like a small, and it’s the biggest they offer, I’m sending back for a refund."
2.0,Too small and I ordered two sizes up from my normal size. It’s pretty but isn’t built for an American bust area.
2.0,Very large hat. Fit over my head and my daughters.
2.0,"The dress fit me awkwardly, the waist on the dress was too high for my natural waist. I did not send it back because it makes for comfortable lounge wear."
2.0,These are as wide as a house and the arms are too short.
2.0,This outfit was so wrinkled and itchy I donated it.
2.0,"14 of the 40 didn't work--I assume the little batteries are dead, but there is no way to change them. At least I can give out the others, and didn't pay that much.<br /><br />Just be aware--40 lights for $8 sounds great, but assume up to half of them won't work on arrival."
2.0,very flimsy material.
2.0,Ordered an adult large. Upon delivery this was not an adult large. This shirt was sized for a child. Returned the shirt.
2.0,"I love the dress but I always wash everything before I wear it. It got a 3"" hole wear the smocking meets the skirt. So I guess after I sew it I can wear it"
2.0,Weird material not very comfortable and doesn't stretch very well also a little on the thin side not great for a face mask
2.0,"I loved the material, the fact that there was no glare while driving, the frame is wood and not plastic, everything I loved but accidentally they fell off my hand, hit the concrete and then the frame was broken, couldn't use them anymore. Love the idea but needs improvement, I'm sure the company will get along"
2.0,The pants will suffice for my costume purpose
2.0,These are not subtle.  At all.  I have a pretty big head and these look huge on my face.  I feel like Max Hedroom or David Lee Roth in these.  I was aiming for Lisa Loeb. LOL They are clownish.
2.0,The dress was beautiful. But my only concern we ordered Blue but when we realized it . The color was like a blueish green color. We ordered Blue. It reflects a green in the light. That’s not what we wanted.
2.0,I wear a size 7 in regular shoes/boots. With steel toe boots I always order a size up. These boots are uncomfortable in the toe area and feel too small. I will be returning them.
2.0,Runs large. Shows any watermarks
2.0,"Gave 2 stars only because shipping was much faster than expected.<br /><br />This top is NOT like the picture at all! The white tank underneath stops under the bust leaving the abdomen completely exposed because the criss cross overlay is see through. I'm very disappointed, I ordered this to wear to a wedding but it's only suitable for wearing to the strip club!"
2.0,Cute but cheaply made. Glue shows on front.
2.0,"This definitely did not live up to my expectations. I lost one of the little diamonds within the first day-and then 3 more within the first week. And just so you know, I’m not hard with my hands at all and have never had an issue with any of my other rings before. I was pretty disappointed in the quality"
2.0,The main stone came off while taking out of package
2.0,Do not like the way it fits! Cheap looking
2.0,It comes off ring easily but it does the job
2.0,"After some time the gold has worn off, and stitching is coming apart. I loved it at first, but will soon be looking for a different one..."
2.0,"I did not like the way the detailing looked, very deferent from picture."
2.0,Definitely not a traditional 7 inch short! These are way longer than my 9 inch Reebok shorts.
2.0,I don’t like the spandex material. Other than that it’s an ok dress
2.0,"I really wanted to love these shorts but I just could not. While I like the cut and style of the shorts on the picture, they seriously look like a diaper when put on. Material feel coarse and is very stiff so not flowy like I'd expect/want them to be. I'm 5'7.5&#34; and they covered my butt fully. The tie for the waist is not attached. They just look and feel cheaply made and I do not recommend them at all."
2.0,Watch strap was very stiff.  Also too big for my wrist even though I have a fairly large watch.  Not very comfortable.  However..it was easy to install and I did like the color green.
2.0,"Ok with everything else, but small for any chest bigger then an ""A"""
2.0,Was broken when I opened the package
2.0,These glasses are cute but the lens are not polarized as indicated . Just a purple lens is all
2.0,Not Happy I received 4 pairs of supposed to be leggings but after I wash them I saw they where tights and the fleece inside is not like the picture shown  waste of money definitely not happy don’t show something and ship something else
2.0,"The tie tack looked great & was sized well. However, the pin was not long enough to go through my husband’s tie & attach the clasp."
2.0,Great looking shirts but run real small but made good Re- gift!
2.0,While the material and construction is good the item is way too long for my wife.  Instead of returning the item she will attempt a modification or pass it on to someone for which it will better fit.
2.0,Fabric is not what I thought. It will do
2.0,"Adorable boots, and my kiddo loved them. But they didn't last long before they cracked and feet were getting soaked. Maybe 3 or 4 months."
2.0,Love the bag but not the quality.  After 2 months the lining is unraveling.
2.0,I got this outfit tried it on and loved it but to my surprise their outfit came with a hole right in the croch area smh besides that it could have been perfect.
2.0,Little according to the purchase
2.0,"While this coat appears to be of good quality, it is very large and shapeless. My regular size was far too large, and even when I sized down it was unflatteringly roomy. If I went another size down, the sleeves would be too short. Unfortunately I'll be sending this back."
2.0,"It's okay product, I thought it would fit loose but it actually is a very tight fit. I am cup c, and it is very form fitting and sheer."
2.0,The green is not the one in the picture. It is made nice. You need to order a size up to get the flow to it as I saw in the comments.
2.0,"Can't adjust length, the clasp is at an angle and won't stay closed,"
2.0,"The electric was sewn too high, which made the dress fit too short. It’s a mess for me"
2.0,"Very disappointed in the wrists. Oversized, blown out. Not tapered like the rest of the sweater. Gives it that sloppy look.<br />Sweater feels great, great fabric, great feel.<br />But unfortunately defeats the whole purpose with the wrists being like that."
2.0,The top wasn't as described and is much too large for the size as the tail is almost to small. Very disappointed in merchandise
2.0,"Looked forward to this costume and was careful to read reviews. I am close to 6’2” and my arms were too big to allow air into the sleeves, the elastic cuffs were way above my wrists, and with my head through the hole my body was pulled forward and down. Not designed for tall people. Also had instructions in Chinese, things written in ballpoint pen, and even the amazon tag had Chinese characters."
2.0,"The tassels come down too long on my foot, and actually interfere with my ability to walk.  The overall look is much clunkier than the photo depicts."
2.0,I returned this product. It smelled of smoke and even though I am typically a size 2-4 dress size and a small bathing suit (medium in some brands) the suit fit like a child's suit. On the plus side my refund was processed quickly.
2.0,This product is a very thin material. It does not work very well as a scarf to wear with clothing or coats. The print on the fabric is very good the fabric is also very soft but it is very very thin.
2.0,Does not match the picture at all. I am very disappointed with these. The zipper part goes only half way down when the pictures shows the zipper going to the bottom of the shorts.  The fit is what I expected from the reviews. The shorts are a spandex material not at all jean quality.
2.0,"I am male, 6'4&#34; and wear size 13 shoe.  I ordered the XL and can't even put the socks on.  Since the socks aren't tagged with a size I don't know if they sent the wrong size or if they are just poorly constructed.  I recommend you search for other socks."
2.0,I get that they are hook earrings but would have liked a rubber clear backing at least. Had a previous pair and lost one due to lack of backing.
2.0,We ordered 3 dresses and only 1 had rhinestones and sequins. The other 2 were plain. Did get the dresses quicker than expected.
2.0,"The size is accurate and it looks like the pictures but I just can’t stand the material. It doesn’t feel terrible to touch so i was tricked into wearing it, but the entire time I had it on I couldn’t wait to take it off bc it was so thick and way too hot."
2.0,"I actually really like this product, i like the blade and the fire starting capabilities as well as the whistle  . All the mention work .  The compass doesn't work in any of them.  SO if you are buying this for the hidden blade then its good but if you are buying this for the compass don't waist your time."
2.0,Very thin cotton. I ordered it larger expecting it to be smaller and probably going to shrink. Not a great buy.
2.0,"Very poorly made; they look like seconds.  At the waist band there are many long loose threads just hanging out where the machine must have missed the elastic.  I stretched the waistband and several more threads popped.  I tied off  the threads to prevent further unraveling, but I’ll be surprised if they survive the washer."
2.0,product was what i expected but was a different color than ordered. I ordered Light grey and a greenish color arrived. Otherwise they are OK.
2.0,Plastic part where holds the screw got cracked and arm broke off.. within a year
2.0,"For the price, I expected more durability.  I use this on my Casio which I wear a couple times a week, mostly at the office and occasionally playing catch or going on hikes.  Unfortunately, the edges of the strap are fraying and really coming apart.  There are cheaper versions of this type of strap, and I hoped that this one would last better.  I do have to say, that the strap is comfortable, and fit perfectly with the included pins."
2.0,"They're constantly slipping off even if I tighten them up, they eventually slip. I use these all day, can't say I'm that impressed."
2.0,They don't look anything like the picture.  The fit is very ugly.
2.0,I ordered size small (I am size 4 in jeans) and I feel I am drowning on these pjs... such a same because I love the print :(((((((
2.0,"The belt fits me fine. I usually wear a 36W in jeans. The only problem I have is that the metal part that flanges out scratches my stomach. I have literal cuts on my stomach from this belt so I wouldn't recommend it. Other than that, it's a sturdy well made belt. If you buy it, I'd recommend finding a buckle to replace the one it comes with."
2.0,Purse was not nearly the size that was listed in the description and details section it’s way smaller. Highly disappointed with that would not have payed that much for this size purse. Beautiful other wise exactly like pic except much smaller. Overall not very satisfied considering I can’t fit all my things into it.
2.0,tight across shoulders even in a size up
2.0,"Im giving two stars because this belt seemed to be the miracle cure for my husband's belly rash, but unfortunately the buckle broke after only a month of use.  I understand they are plastic, but I expected more for the price."
2.0,I have a size 10 in a dress of the same design.  I ordered a large and it was too small.  Needless to say I was very disappointed.  I ordered this and another similar dress.  Both were too small.<br />I decided to keep them and try to loose some weight.  I don't like to return items.
2.0,Had I read the reviews I would have known the skirt was too small...
2.0,"No support, and there were sequins missing on the straps upon arrival"
2.0,runs small in sizing
2.0,"If you are thin or athletic build avoid. From, the chest up its great. After that it looks like a maternity dress. Unless you are really jacked or have a huge gut I'd get something else."
2.0,Too Wide!!
2.0,Terrible material with no give at all. Looks cheap
2.0,I wore it once and noticed that the silver in the underneath had worn off where it touched my desk. Other than that it is beautiful.
2.0,Green paint peeled off within a week of wearing it
2.0,The dress was ok. I will probably pass it on.
2.0,"At the time I bought the Medium it said it would fit 32"" waist. Now it's showing correct sizing. Too bad I can't replace it cause they were really nice."
2.0,"I absolutely loved it! It was my favorite.<br />Sadly the guitar handle catches on everything, it would snag on everything, it eventually broke when it snagged while brushing my hair. It happened just outside of the 30 day return window so I can't excange or return it."
2.0,"If you want to buy this dress you need a bigger size than you are.  I bought my size and when I went to put it on I could not get the zipper pulled up near my mid back area.  Obviously, your back is not part of the measurement so I had no way of knowing this.  The dress has no give in the back area so I could not try to force it up.  What’s worse is I bought this dress in winter time and since it’s short sleeves I did not try to wear it until the first warm day.  By the time I realized it didn’t fit, it was too late to return."
2.0,"This shirt had such potential! Unfortunately, the front is a few inches shorter than the back of the shirt. The result is a beautiful...mid-drift baring shirt. Not what I was expecting, nor what I was wanting. Buyer beware! If you have a short torso, this shirt will still work. If you have an average or long torso, you'll be in for a surprise!"
2.0,Its stretchy but when spread out shows white and doesn't sit right
2.0,Way to small. Fits like a small or even a bigger XS
2.0,Terrible material and fit...
2.0,Shoes were very cute but the size was not accurate.  Need to order a 1/2 size larger to fit.
2.0,They would not stay up!
2.0,Not what I wanted. I'm a 36DD so when I buy a sports bra I look for major support and this one doesn't provide that at all. It just lays there. And the padding in it moves around everywhere. I went for a hike and half way I realized the padding had gone to the middle!! Had to stick my hand in there to fix it 😒 The only reason I gave 2 start because the bra did fit
2.0,I'm normally a Medium across the board. I could have ordered a small and they would have fit perfectly. The medium is big around the waist and the legs have wide legs.
2.0,"The bottoms fit perfect, but maybe needed a size smaller on the top.  I feel like if I were to wear it to the pool I'd totally flash someone."
2.0,"I bought this for my grandma.  It’s very small and delicate as if it was made for a young girl.<br />It’s too late to return it, so I’m giving it as a Christmas gift but I’m really not happy with it."
2.0,"Item doesn't have alot of durability.  After 2 trips,seam separated and stitch came out up near the shoulder strap"
2.0,"This bathing suit is gorgeous! The fabric is of a good quality, it is just waaaay tooo smaaalllll! I bought an L and it fits like a Small, like really, really, really small!<br />I got stuck with it becuase it's international shipping, I will probably resell it... It seems to be that I'll have to purchase the XXXL just not sure I would though."
2.0,The fabric is super thin and I expected it to have more stretch. I even went up one size and it was still too small. Not satisfied with this.
2.0,"This is an okay quality leather mini-bag that can hold a phone and the essentials from your wallet. It's definitely cute. Here's the thing that concerns me. This arrived surrounded by two pieces of white cardboard in a cellophane bag. When I took it out of the cellophane, I noticed the cardboard was almost completely stained by brownish oily residue from the mini-bag, as if the bag had been treated with some kind of oil or dye right before packaging. I am afraid of using this bag--afraid that it will stain my clothes or stain a surface I put it on. So I will not be using this."
2.0,"cute but seriously ... who's ears are that small?  the cuff is really pretty but it is really tiny and did not fit my ears (I don't have large ears), also it is made for those who have a third ear piercing, if you don't have one it will not work."
2.0,This jacket runs small. I ordered a size Large.<br />You should order 2 sizes up.
2.0,Too small so i dont use it.
2.0,The material is very thin which would be nice because it’s hot on the 4th of July but it sticks to itself. Looks cheap
2.0,"these were way to big for my sisters nose-needless to say,they are collecting dust sitting on a shelf, because they wouldn't fit-it hurt her to try"
2.0,"I have wide 10.5 feet and these shoes fit comfortably.  These are the first pair of driving shoes that I've owned and it wasn't really what I was expecting.  They are very thin, almost like wearing socks with soles.  So the price is kind of high for what it is, but I have no other basis for this analysis.  I haven't used them yet, however, they are very comfortable.  I'll add in more on the review after a day at the track.<br /><br />*Update:  The shoes aren't bad comfortwise, but the thin string shoelace eyes came apart on me after 3 track events.  I wound up buying some GeForce shoes for almost $80 and they were very sturdy, comfortable, and is better than these.  In other words, these shoes are a waste of money and I don't think I will buy another Sparco shoe again."
2.0,"I'm 5' 5"" and 160, normally a size 10. This fits like a bandage. Way too tight. Order at least one size up."
2.0,One broken when I received it....but cute!
2.0,A little too small and slip off my feet. I wear a women's 7. They're too thin for what I was looking for an too small. They're more of a stocking material than a sock material
2.0,Very disappointed In pockets. Not large enough for cell phone. Very disappointed.  Love the color though
2.0,Not what I was expecting. It’s really loose has no shape or form. I don’t like the material. Doesn’t look like the advertisement.
2.0,"the cover flap for over the charging port is not well fitting and i can not hear the phone well with the plastic covering the receiver hole...should keep the phone a bit dryer than without the case but the mute button for the ringer has obstruction of movement... so that is at least three strikes against purchase of case so you're out at the ole ball game...should have bought a case at retail establishment, would have cost the same and had it the same day. oh well, live and learn...not to buy online what can be purchased locally."
2.0,did not fit in my tragus hole so I can't use them for there. A little difficult to put on
2.0,"Overall, the fabric was a good weight and very soft and the color was as pictured. However, the cut was not flattering and I ended up returning."
2.0,This shirt fit oddly funny. It’s loose around the waist and super short when you try to cinch it tight. The color is cute but not what I was expecting. I also bought one in gray with the trumpet sleeves and that one was true to size and looked exactly like what was pictured on the model. Definitely order the trumpet sleeved ones if you’re looking for that tight-waist look :)
2.0,Even smaller than described and not even the same color as the photo.
2.0,Perfect..love them
2.0,"Was okay.. my daughter is 4. I ordered a size up, 5/6 size. Threads hung off of it everywhere so I trimmed them off. The shirt is fine. The shorts have that scratchy material. I think I'm going to return it, I personally am not crazy about it."
2.0,"Though these glasses provide a brightening effect because of the yellow lenses, they are not polarized. They do little to reduce glare from oncoming headlights.<br />The funny thing is they don’t even work on the hidden image card that comes with the glasses that is supposed to demonstrate the polarizing effect."
2.0,Necklace has only 1 charm not the 5 that is shown in the picture.  The chain is short so I will also need to replace the chain.  Would not buy again...
2.0,Showed up on time but after a month the blue paint started rubbing off
2.0,Runs super small my 3 yr old wears a 5 and the ones we got would not go over her foot
2.0,The clips (especially on the larger two) are uncomfortable and aligned poorly so they begin to hurt pretty badly after 45 minutes or so...
2.0,dress is beautiful but way too small. When I tried to return it they ignored me...BEWARE!!!!!!
2.0,CHEAP..CHEAP...CHEAP......METAL AS THIN AS FOIL....YOU CAN HOLD IT BY ONE END AND IT FLOPS AROUND LIKE A PAPER TOWEL !
2.0,My jacket had no pockets. Also quality is not good. Very cheap material.
2.0,Items fell apart.
2.0,Although the description is listed as white.  Not white at all!!!
2.0,Was nice just to loose in the shoulders
2.0,"Products work great if you are not doing any real aggressive lifting.  However,  I have to constantly readjust during CrossFit workouts."
2.0,Disappointed. The material is really thin. It is not see through but you cannot wear it bras less for my free the tata's ladies out there.<br />But overall fits great. Debating if I will return it or not. Was expecting the material to be like a T-shirt... not like an undershirt if you see what I mean.<br />And the cuts are weird. The shirt fits but the collar and arms are tighter than expected. Give you the impression of being chocked
2.0,Two thick it looked too big
2.0,Air gaps on either side of the upper compartment caused by openings by the zipper.
2.0,The tshirt i received looks like its been worn before
2.0,"Hmm, the size seems accurate until you get to the fingertips. There is excess material in the fingertips to make the fit seem smaller, which creates a bulbous look & feel in the fingertips. Otherwise, these gloves would have been nice, as they seem otherwise soft and decently sewn together. UPDATE: I contacted seller and the issue was resolved immediately to my satisfaction. Seller was very polite and professional. Thank you."
2.0,She wears it and says she likes it but I found it too plain.
2.0,"Had to Return the pants , they are very comfortable but I hate there is no option to choose the length on the pants , maybe you all can adjust that in the future ! You can only choose the width ."
2.0,Items were not packaged properly it looses its shine when packaged in Vacume packaging
2.0,"I’m a size 4 and ordered a XS, but the dress was still too loose. The stitching on dress was poorly done. However, the fabric of the dress is soft. Will most likely return the product."
2.0,They have too much grip on the bottom to get them into a shoe.
2.0,I did not like how the xl looked like a medium and the shiny material the pants where mad of
2.0,"Sadly, as much as I liked it, it totally discolored. Don’t know what metal it is, don’t believe it’s sterling silver."
2.0,Fabric is not soft at all.  Feels rough on skin even after washing using a softener.  This top runs small.  Better to order a size up.
2.0,"Nice to work out in but they are not compression fitted..  if u are looking for compression, move on..."
2.0,Poor fabric! Very expensive for the quality.
2.0,Flimsy and cheap material
2.0,"Paper thin, and they stretch like thin elastic. 95% cotton ???"
2.0,The picture shows this long enough to cover the backend but it is not.  In the back it comes to my waist
2.0,This mask is just too expensive.
2.0,"Runs large, odd fit, cuts over the busy in a weird spot. I’m pear shaped, Long torso, small bust, ordered large, it fits hips, but odd fit overall"
2.0,I ordered a extra large and it fits like an extra small and it was white not cream.
2.0,The heart broke off the day I wore it.
2.0,The tassel are very thin.
2.0,"I am between an L & XL too, got and XL and it was tight in the stomach area. Also busty...34DD, straps did not support well. Not for busty women or those with post-baby tummy.... had to return"
2.0,They didn't fit as nice as I thought it would it was too big around the ankles. Didn't look feminine
2.0,"Good idea poorly executed. Don't buy these. If they are tight enough to work, they can't be zipped up. I will be returning them."
2.0,Absolutely terrible for riding motorcycle.<br />The glove is made of multiple layers of material and they are not bonded in anyway. This causes slipping between layers of the glove and not safe at all for motorcycle riding.
2.0,"The construction of the item is fair at best. The embroidery is also fair, nothing spectacular. I think the item is woefully overpriced."
2.0,I love this design but they came scratched and hope I can replace with better ones. Very cute!
2.0,"While this is a nice looking watch, it keeps terrible time.  Since I received the watch, and after resetting it 3 different times, it seems to lose about 1 minute every day.  I would not recommend this watch to others."
2.0,No booties and zipper is broken
2.0,I’m 158 Pds 5’2 and the medium was way to big. My measurements are 40-30-42 and I’m only 5’2. I was planning to wear for my bday but that’s a bust . Returning ! Two star is because it came pretty quickly and the color is spot on.
2.0,"Looks cool, but practically unwearable due to how uncomfortable it is. It all digs into my skin way too much and it's just awful."
2.0,I ordered a large. I am 5'9 160. 36B. Bust on this dress was way too big for me. Fabric is pretty see through. Length was great for me.
2.0,Size down but turned out great
2.0,"Returning this shirt. It is thin, right and poor quality."
2.0,Thin and slippery polyester fabric. Not what I expected and sent them back.
2.0,Material too dark. Can’t see the Word Jeep
2.0,Nice but wasn’t what I expected it serves a purpose though it’s only for the area that you’re in
2.0,It came terrible wrinkled.  I am still waiting for it to smooth out.
2.0,These were just Ok.<br />The quality wasn’t brilliant and I was really disappointed to see it didn’t have the standard mask nose bridge metal to keep it from falling off your face.<br /><br />Real shame.
2.0,BUt it broke the second I put it on. I am ordering another to see if mine was defective or if it is a material problem. More later.
2.0,"Runs very small, unless you are a cardboard cutout."
2.0,"Inaccurate description. These are capris, not shorts. Sent back and got an actual pair of sweat shorts that I love!"
2.0,The ring looks cheap. You get what you pay for. Otherwise it is nice.
2.0,too small . had to return the jeans :(.
2.0,The dress runs small.  The material was different than I expected.  The pattern looked different than what was pictured.  I had to return it.
2.0,"The fit was fine, but the fabric was too thin, almost transparent and not as elastic as most yoga pants."
2.0,This strap is meant to look like a nice handmade leather strap but is actually very cheaply made.  Shouldn't be a surprise given the price but don't let the photos fool you.  The band will split apart easily since it is just two thin strips of cheap leather glued together.  Definitely not for a nicer watch.
2.0,Very costume jewelry looking compared to my original one that was stolen
2.0,"Fits in the hip, loose on the bottom half so the twists and fall all day. Very sheer. Not worth the money I paid and I got them on sale. Save your money"
2.0,"These are very pretty.  The reason for 2 stars.  I wore them once, took them out at the end of the day to discover one of the crystals (the whole round blue ) was gone.  Very disappointed."
2.0,thin leather or plastic
2.0,"una tela no muy buena, se estira con facilidad y no talla muy bien."
2.0,Very small. Beware.
2.0,Good looking but not durable
2.0,They ripped in a week for no reason
2.0,After 2 months the black part of the case started to lift
2.0,Hats were tight and the necklaces died within a day
2.0,"Nice mask, but I ordered it in plain black and received one with a swirl designs and sparkles around the eyesand lace around the edges. :/ hope my boyfriend doesnt mind the extra girly designs on it,"
2.0,Quality is not great. Hat does not hold shape like it shows in picture. String fell off when opening. Y
2.0,Why not finish the edges correctly ?  It just has loose seam.
2.0,"I didn’t like that there was no instructions or photo of how to assemble this costume. The material is very heavy and hot, my son with special needs hated it so I’m returning. Also, I feel it’s very difficult to get the shoulders to look like what the photo on this item shows. I also didn’t like the garment bag it was mailed in- very thin with a small hole that exposes the costume to dirt. Might be more comfortable and better options out there..."
2.0,They really dont fit right and not very comfortable and you have to put the string in yourself. Which wouldn't be a big deal if the string wasnt unravelling. Don't recommend for anyone
2.0,Pilling is awful!!
2.0,"It looks like a pull over poncho in the picture, but its not!  Its a shawl with a hood....so disappointing."
2.0,Was an instant return  Made on the cheesy side. Thin material -- poor quality.  Could barely see this garment holding up to only two washings.  NOT sized to fit. Way too small.  Its unfortunate because I liked the logo
2.0,This was just ok.
2.0,"The waistband is elastic, but very stubborn. It is hard to stretch. Fabric material is very good, and the skin on my legs feels as if in silks, but the waistband makes the pants uncomfortable for me."
2.0,"Nice soft fabric but this style is extremely form fitting!  I sized up according to other reviews but the style on this just hugs your body.  If you have a great body and no lumps or bumps, this might work for you.  But it does fit as snugly as the photo indicates ."
2.0,"I hesitated to order this top, most of the reviews were negative and they were spot on. The sleeves are for mutants with childlike arms and I am afraid to wash it due to it shrinking away. Ms. Somers should be ashamed that this product has her face on  it."
2.0,"I am an erstwhile fan of Ellazhu clothing, and this is one of those rare, disappointing misses: The garment is well made and mainly as shown, in color and style; however, there is no way the waist is 43"" and the hips over 48."" My waist measurement is 38-9"", and my hips 46,"" yet these culottes are very tight, especially at the waistband, which can measure no more than 30."" The model must be under 5,' as the hem appears to provide a lot more length--I am 5'4.5"" and these are short as well as tight. With no way to return them, I will keep them in the hopes that I eventually shed that 30-40 lbs."
2.0,"Size is smaller then expected but it was wearable. A little thin material, won’t last too many washes starts to shed out after a few weeks. Very cheap but get what you pay for."
2.0,Pretty and flowing
2.0,"I bought these based on the great reviews. Unfortunately I did not have the same good experience. My daughter only wore these two or three times and each time she got sores on her ankles where the metal buckles rubbed. Also, they fir her a little awkwardly, with too much space in the back of the shoe but her foot nearly hung off of the front. I tried to adjust the straps but that didn't seem to make any difference. I will say the quality of the materials were very good and they are simply adorable, I'm just disappointed that I spent the extra money to purchase these over other less expensive sandals in hope these would become her &#34;go to&#34; shoes for the summer."
2.0,Haven’t had a chance to test the. On the water but immediately noticed that they do not have a snug fit and the lenses will pop out too easily which is pretty bad you can barely touch them and they will fall out
2.0,Too small. I’m 5’ 10” And the 12 wasn’t long enough
2.0,Had to return runs small
2.0,very pretty but upper part of earring has no support
2.0,"It's much longer than it looks inthe picture. I thought it would be more like a choker, it's  too long and looks very cheap- I guess what would one expect for the price.  Thanks though, I think I'll use the cherry ornament for something else."
2.0,Nice color but sizing is grossly small.  I had to give the shirt to my child
2.0,"I was very disappointed❣️The colors were pretty and the material wasn’t bad. I wanted this to use as a cover up over my bathing suit going to the pool and for the beach over our vacation and for the rest of the summer. I received this one size fits all only 1-2 days before we were leaving for vacation. Push for time I put it right into the washer and dryer, then right into my waiting suit case without trying it on! When, I put it on in our hotel to go down to the beach I was so disappointed!!! I am 5’ 2” tall and weigh 125-130lbs. I had on flip flops with a 2 inch sole but this cover up is so long that it still drags the floor a lot (inches)!<br />And, the one size fits all....that never really does, so I was expect it to be a little bigger than me! But, to my surprise when I put the cover up on...... it literally drug the floor and it was so big that I could have had another person get in it with me!! I literally could wrap it around me! This One Size Fits All, is more like One Size Fits Two! To be able to wear it, I going to have to basically take it apart down both sides, cut out several inches and sew it back together. Then cut some off of the bottom and hem it! (Remake it!)"
2.0,"I didn't even open it. It was balled up I'm a clear bag like it was worn, returned, then sent to my house. There is even a hole in the bag. I really wanted this dress now I'm returning it."
2.0,"Ordered these as a Christmas gift, they arrived in a timely manner and looked great but unfortunately only one shoe had working lights. I tried all the trouble shooting tips but it still would not work. Very disappointed."
2.0,"The colors are WAY off. From the photo on the site, it looks like two shades of gray; however, that is not the case. The child’s shirt is more of a brown color. THEY DO NOT MATCH AT ALL. So disappointing as this was supposed to be a Father’s Day gift and now I have to scramble to find something else."
2.0,Not even close to the stated size!
2.0,"This jacket looks cheaply made. The fabric and zipper seem to be made of lower quality stuff. It doesn't feel good. Aside from that, the fit is off. It runs short in the body but not the sleeve. The area where the sleeves attach to the bodice is just weird- I feel like there is not quite enough material at the shoulder, but there is too much in the underarm region.<br />I received this for free as a review item. If I had paid for it, I would definitely return this. NOT recommended."
2.0,cheap quality wrist band
2.0,Feels cheap for the price. Too small.
2.0,"My chain was very beautiful when it arrived, but now that I have cleaned it, its not shiny anymore. It has lost all its luster only the catch is shiny. Out of the box is 5 stars but now that I have cleaned it its just 2 stars. I am disappointed cuz I really like silver."
2.0,These are very pretty but way too heavy
2.0,"Clunky, changing links is frustrating... just overall you're better off sticking with the band it comes with.  If you're worried about a professional appearance, don't be - or at least wait until you see the original band before getting convinced you'll look sloppy if you don't upgrade."
2.0,Very weak seams!
2.0,Stitching extremely itchy on suspender/straps. Crotch area also fits weird. Splurge on better quality overalls that will last
2.0,I would give 5 stars if the size was right.<br />I ordered my size and it was 2 sizes too big.<br />I had someone who wears a size 13 shoe fit the size 11
2.0,There was no jewel as what was pictured.  What I got was just the purple ribbon and black embroidery choker.  Disappointed.
2.0,"These sounded great based on the reviews,  but they were several inches shorter than I expected, and are closer to ankle socks than crew socks. Strange smell to the socks that I hope washes out."
2.0,The thread started unraveling after 2 days of wearing them. The logo started chipping away as well. I got these to replace another similar pair that are 3+ years old and look like they're in better condition than the new ones after just a few days of wearing them.
2.0,My straps were put on wrong I have one in the front and one on the side of my thigh and Velcro isn't very durable
2.0,The picture gives the appearance of a light weight sweat shirt material when in fact it is polyester.<br />Never would have purchased it if I had know that.<br />To small too.
2.0,"This is just a regular racerback tank shirt. It's not bad but it's NOT what is advertised. And yes, I got the right size."
2.0,Was alot smaller than I thought.  It only changes to 2 different colors.  The do not wear it very much anymore since the colors don't change much.
2.0,"I was excited purchasing this dress, and after reading reviews, I decided to order a size up. When I received the dress, the color was identical as shown on the model, but the entire cut of the dress was way off. This dress was not designed to be off the shoulder, and the elastic part around the waste is much too short - where as the model it shows a low waist line and loose, this was just all off.  The fabric was very soft and the color was great, but nothing else met the mark. Not flattering to the say the least. Sad to say I will be returning."
2.0,"I can't even fasten this around my neck because it's too short.<br /><br />The gemstone is very pretty and surrounded by CZ stones , in fact, it looks nicer than I expected. However, the chain looks very very cheap in person. In the picture on the sale page, it's kind of a little twisted, which makes it look nicer. In reality it's flat, and when you wear it, it will be flat and to be honest, it looks like something you might get out of a arcade price counter, if you saved up enough ski-ball tickets.<br /><br />I knew when I requested this that it wasn't Tiffany jewelry I'd be getting, but I did expect the quality to be a little better than this."
2.0,"Cheaply made, not even 2 weeks and it's worn out"
2.0,Nice decorations but the masks were too thin and too big for my kindergarten age child.
2.0,"I'm sure it is a decent product, but it arrived open with the t-bar missing. Since I have a quick release buckle that makes this useless until I can get one."
2.0,I liked the suit but the zipper quality was poor. I had to take the sauna suit to the tailor shop get the zipper replaced with a much better zipper.
2.0,"I purchased this product and received it on July 24th. It is now August 16th and the band has not faired well. I wouldn't think the scuffs on the band would be there so soon. I know that the lugs that attach to the actual gear fit2 are not made from stainless steel because they turned copper colored like most nickel plated things do. If you're buying the product for the stainless steel like I did I would advise against it. The design is pretty good, attaches pretty easily and feels comfortable while wearing it. It just needs better quality attachments."
2.0,"This gold color that it appears in the picture was more like a pumpkin color when it got here. On top of that a &#34;Small&#34; is really a large. I had to pass the shirt to my aunt because I wear small sometimes x-small, but this was diff. a Large. Order 2 size down."
2.0,Horrible. It just fits uncomfortable. Bikinis are meant for women aren't they? So do companies know we have BREASTS. I bought an XL and my bra size is 36DDD I figured this would fit properly but my boobs just overflow.
2.0,"Be sure to get a size or two bigger. I purchased a size medium and they are extremely small. Also, they have a low waist, which I dislike."
2.0,"Great premise, but not practical. Just a stiff board with objects attached. Think of pulling a pg board in and out of your bag. All items exposed and open to being caught and pulled off the board. Prefer these items in a porch"
2.0,I am a g-shock fan. However they have missed the mark with this one. Very hard to operate. Very hard to set up and navigate.
2.0,It was really cute but soooooo small.  I ordered a large and was more like a xs.
2.0,Where is great although a hole in the boxers after 20 minutes of wearing it the scenes in the crotch started to separate
2.0,"While it's nice not to have to deal with the buckle when going to the bathroom, I can't say that it holds my pants up as well as a real belt."
2.0,"Fabric is nice and breathable. The colors and pattern are vibrant and look good. But the ear slits/holes are super high so the top of the fabric pushes up into your eyes, and pushes your ears down & out- it’s a very bad design. You can however wear it propped up on your nose and not use the ear holes at all and it works fine. Regardless my 11 year old kiddo still wears it (but it pushes and leaves marks on the face) and doesn’t seem to mind."
2.0,Jewels came off first wear
2.0,"ordered medium-  unfortunately medium doesn't mean medium all the time. i typically wear 8 jeans, sometimes 10 is too big, depends on the brand."
2.0,The material was not good and they smell so badly like chemicals I decided to return them
2.0,no confort
2.0,Very thin fabric my underwear shows through. Run a size small. Seems began coming a part after a few washes.
2.0,"I LOVE the purse but it is not a vibrant red as it appears, it is more like a burnt brick!"
2.0,"The extra small fit more like a small/medium and it’s way too sheer to wear on its own, you would definitely need a slip under. Other than that it’s cute."
2.0,These shirts are NOT pre-shrunk! They shrank 2 sizes the first washing. I wear medium but I bought large to allow for shrinking - and can’t wear them!  A boxier shape than women’s shirts usually are. Want to return but shipping to seller is $15. Will find someone who can wear them. The ones I received have a nice weight.
2.0,Only lasted maybe a month before the insides fell apart...
2.0,"We purchased two pairs of these last year, and though the fit was a bit strange and they didn't seem of the best quality, they worked well enough. However, this year, they arrived already with a hole in the crotch area. The stitching was also ragged throughout the garments. The texture seemed rougher than previous as well. We returned and spent more money on the City Threads base layers and are very happy with them."
2.0,"It is a nice mug, but I give it a low rate because isn’t microwave."
2.0,"This is a cheap umbrella, no tilt, it's very flimsy, they sell nicer ones for less money at your regular dept stores."
2.0,No llego bien el articulo
2.0,"It hurts my tummy, it's sqeezes it. The bar isn't big enough."
2.0,Fit very tight around head.
2.0,Money clip only good for a few bills not a lot
2.0,Poor quality. Took a month to receive.
2.0,"Not what I was expecting. It felt great but not the finish I was looking for.<br />It was very 'old ladyish"".<br />Good service from this company."
2.0,"Fit really weird. VERY tight and very long in the sleeves and body. Not for me, I returned. I would not get a size larger."
2.0,It is too thin of a material and needs ironing after washing and drying wants to fray if you have time to pamper this lounger then buy it
2.0,This skirt has very thin fabric with a minimal slip. There was also constant static cling to my legs. The product does not look like the image. The skirt was very large and was not form fitting as shown.
2.0,The lace fabrics is very scratchy and uncomfortable. The inside of the top portion of the dress doesn’t stay up either.
2.0,"Im 5'6 and about 130 pounds and i got the medium based on the measurements they provided. It did not fit no matter how hard i tried. The quality of the skirt is good and it came with the bow so i think i will see if i can get a refund and buy a bigger size. The only thing weird is the ""clasp"" bc its black very visible. Ive never seen a clasp like it before."
2.0,I loved this cover-up until I threw it in the wash and it totally shrunk! Make sure to hand wash only!
2.0,I got the black one. One of the worst nato straps. Weak and loose.
2.0,The fabric width on the shoulders is not the same it is a quarter of a inch off. When I tie the front tie it throws the center seam off. It is an imperfect top. I am very disappointed.
2.0,"The part of the case the covers the headphone jack and lightning power cable input was torn off almost immediately by my 11 year old.  It's not very durable, and isn't waterproof anymore.  If you are looking for the waterproof feature of this product, I would highly recommend investing in something a little nicer.  But, the case is nice enough and does help against drops and protects the screen."
2.0,"Brim is smaller than appears, it looks more floppy In the picture. It's cute but smells funny."
2.0,Cheap. Way too small! Disappointed
2.0,Not a big fan but it's wearable
2.0,Beads were much smaller than expected.  I previously purchased a similar bracelet that said it had 3mm beads and the size was identical.
2.0,The skirt was too small. The material was decent and I liked that it had pockets. I ended up still wearing it but it did not zip the entire way up so I was unable to wear it exactly how it was in the picture.
2.0,"I bought a large in this sweatshirt, desiring it to be baggy. Instead, it barely fits at all and even runs short. If you normally wear a medium size in sweatshirts, a large size in this may be fine if you're not too tall."
2.0,"The fit is fine on these, but the quality is quite poor.  the stitching is half unraveled on these and there are extra little strings hanging all over the place.  I'm just using them as sleepwear so when they wear out, they wear out.  I wouldn't buy again."
2.0,"La Joya es linda, pero demasiado grande para el piercing daith."
2.0,"Super small, even with upsizing.  Cheaply made product and it looks like it."
2.0,"Not at all like the legging waistband, very tight. The material isn’t soft either."
2.0,It was not what i expected. My outfit came quit stain with green spots on them. I was so excited but unhappy wen i saw my outfit. Thank god the stains werent noticeable
2.0,This is a very warm very soft sweater/shirt but it is diffidently not worth twenty dollars. It does have a strong chemical smell and very simple very cheaply made. The zipper pocket is nonfunctional.
2.0,"Material was too thin, fit was way smaller than  xxl."
2.0,"Horrible quality, looks flamable"
2.0,"This braceles will not fit a ladies wrist never mind a man. I gave it to my 8 year old son. Believe it or not it almost fit.<br />Give it 2 stars, because it is nice looking.<br />PLEASE change description to small youth."
2.0,"WIFE'S REVIEW:<br />I really like how comfortable these are, but they need longer or adjustable straps. I have a short torso and these fit well around my bust, but ride up so I'm constantly tugging them back down. A bigger size might fit well length-wise but would be too big around the bust. I have several different types of bras and I generally avoid these unless the others are dirty or I'm lounging at home with no plans to go out. For reference, I'm 5'2"" and wear a 36C typically. These are the first sports bras I've ever owned so I'm not sure if this riding up issue is common in most sports bras or if these particular bras are just poorly sized."
2.0,Fits large.  I have small hands but had to get xsmall for there to be any compression.
2.0,"Look much cheaper than the pic shows, there is a lot more empty space around the center stones then shown. I returned."
2.0,This is the second time I bought these gloves because I loved them so much the first time but the second set is so much thinner than the first set. Not sure why that is but not happy about it. They do still keep my hands warm but this time around they just feel cheap and not worth $16. Not going to buy again
2.0,Very disappointed color was so different than advertised picture
2.0,"The ring may be silver, but the ear post isn't for sure. The reason why I got this is because I thought the whole product was silver. After wearing it out for a few hours, it really irritated my ears even two days after taking it off. Will have to return, unfortunately. Otherwise, it's fine if your ears aren't sensitive like mine."
2.0,"Ordered for a friend as a Christmas gift.<br />Didnt come with the neck peice or the small removable tail but instead with a bodysuit that was way to small since it didnt ask for a size or even say it was coming with one.<br />Also the ears are low quality, not like what was advertised at all."
2.0,One of the reasons I bought this item was because the photos and videos showed it had a safety clip on the chin strap. The item I received does not have a safety clip. Very disappointed!
2.0,These are adorable but one of them broke during first wear.
2.0,A large fits like a medium
2.0,"This seemed like such a good idea at the time.  It does run a bit small, so order up.  I found it not as flattering as I thought it would be.  The small slit, I thought, would expose just the right amount of upper abs, giving me a sleek and sexy peek-a-boo look. Instead, the sliver of skin looked somewhat like a thanksgiving turkey bound in tight string, with gobs of...stuff...pouring through the opening.  I'm not heavy or out of shape by any means, but this dress made me look like I've never met a cheeseburger I didn't like.  I'll probably keep it, but mostly because I'm too lazy to return it."
2.0,"Heavy, uncentered/off balanced. Looks cheap and bulky. Not 925. Turned ears green."
2.0,Cute tank tops and nice fabric. Giving two stars because the sizing is WAY off. I have no issues fitting in a medium and I would have needed an XL in these. Disappointed
2.0,Decided to go another direction. The package had a small that made the bag unuseable.
2.0,The lights flashed fully for less than a month. I was given an exchange and the same thing happened with the 2nd pair. Going to try a different company and spend the extra money on them. Too bad though because my son really loved them.
2.0,I love this little outfit and looked adorable on our little man but it is falling apart after the first time he wore it. There are seams in the crotch that are coming unraveled and one of the buttons came completely unattached from the fabric.
2.0,I ordered a size larger after reading the reviews ; still too small.
2.0,"I loved the style.  The magnifier part of the lens is fantastic however the middle to top of the lens distorts.  It is a bit like looking through an aquarium at an angle.  They are not in any way bent of skew on my face.  It almost looks like the image in the left lens is smaller than the right, it is hard to tell what is wrong but something definitely is.<br />I got another pair of the same kind of lens, same magnification, from amazon that works wonderfully, even though I do prefer this style I have decided to send it back since I can see much better over the top of the glasses than through them.<br />Update: I got a prompt refund.  If you end up ordering this and they work well, let me know, could be I got one with a overly thick coating on the lens."
2.0,"THE GOOD: Pretty warm even in near-0° weather. The insulation seems thicker than most I’ve tried, but without being bulky. Nice cuff elastic keeps cold air & snow out of hand area, but doesn’t interfere with my coat sleeve cuff.<br /><br />THE BAD: Strong leather scent I can still smell a month later. My BF said he thought it was normal leather smell, but I’ve never had gloves smell so strongly before, nor for so long.<br /><br />Fingers are a little too long, though I do have small hands. But I’ve had gloves that fit fine before so I still consider this a bit of a flaw.<br /><br />THE UGLY: Already RIPPED a seam! I’ve worn them just over a month. I wear them mostly to wear between getting in/out of a car or to drive, about 2 hours a day max, but often not even that long.<br /><br />There’s an odd seam off the thumb which is a sort of stress point in certain hand positions (see pics). My old black gloves (which a certain famous glove company no longer makes) had a more anatomical thumb design & I’ve had two pairs of them for years & they never ripped out. The fingertips and insulation wore down, but the seams are strong (photo included for comparison).<br /><br />THESE gloves are never going to make it that long, since they have ripped out a seam after barely a month of use. If I wasn’t 4 days past the return window, I’d be sending them back."
2.0,Material not as pictured. The blouse is fine but the skirt is a really cheap material...i know that definitely can't go in the washing machine. 1 wash and that will get damaged.
2.0,Broken when they arrived but otherwise cute.
2.0,Product shrunk quite a bit after first wash.
2.0,This is beautiful and comfortable.  The strings though started breaking soon after I got it.  Really disappointed with quality because it really is pretty.
2.0,So the SHOE was great. Fits well. Son likes it. However we only received 1 of the pair. Yea only the right foot. So unfortunately I will not be trying to buy another pair as we need these and I can’t risk another mistake.
2.0,Shirt is cute and well made but it’s very short on my torso and VERY WIDE. so it was not flattering at all. Looked like an oversized but too short sack.  I like that the buttons were loop with elastic but I would not go out in public with this on.
2.0,It may look emerald green but it is not.<br />The material is thin like a slip. I have see this dress in stores and the material was not as thin. You get what you pay for.
2.0,The jacket is not the same jacket in the picture.
2.0,"It looks nice, feels nice, comfortable to wear! But it breaks or stucks after 3-4 time use! That's why I do NOT liked it!"
2.0,"It is very cute; however, based on the band (fake leather) and the plastic design, it looks very cheaply made. Not worth the cost. If I had known this I never would've never purchased it."
2.0,Not nice.  The material reminded me a sheet/blanket material.  I know that description sounds weird which is exactly how the dress felt and looked... weird. I returned the item.
2.0,"They were a bit too big on me, I ordered the smaller size & they were baggy. The overall quality is pretty cheap too. they are very thing for corduroy material."
2.0,Didn't expect much considering the price (just part of a costume) but it broke the first time I tried it on and I was being gentle.
2.0,The front zipper pocket is not waterproof. I found that out the hard way and had to replace my iPhone. It’s the same fabric as the rest of it. Be careful.
2.0,The material of the fabric is lousy but the colors are ok
2.0,These look super elegant in the picture. But when you see them in real life it's like a plastic teardrop. Not very elegant for a formal event
2.0,"I like it, however, the glass is damaged so I cannot wear it.  I still need to contact the seller."
2.0,"The material was nice and the style. However, it was huge. I bought a size small and there was plenty of room for two more people. The style of the dress is big, but it was way too large for me."
2.0,"Received a decent looking green velvet dress but didn’t look too hard, considering it was covered in lint and reeked of perfume. Thought I was purchasing a new, not used product. Will be returning.<br /><br />Straps looked very flimsy, fabric was somewhat transparent."
2.0,"I was so excited to find these dresses, I bought 3. Sadly they didn't live up to my expectations.<br /><br />1. I bought the royal blue and the fit is great, it's the only one I will get to wear despite a small hole on one of the seams. It's a great work dress which is why I'm sad it's the only one I will get to wear again.<br />2. I bought the real with a floral skirt, color was great fabric was comfortable and it was great for work until I noticed the tear in the front of the dress. (Pictures attached) since i did wear it for half a day i will try to salvage by turning it into a skirt.<br />3. I bought the red with floral skirt. This seemed like a different dress altogether. The first was too small, the fabric was a cheap see through polyester. I will be returning.<br /><br />All in all you get what you pay for and I will be going back to only shopping with stores/brands I know online."
2.0,The strap broke within a week of having it...too much of a hassle to send back. It was cute while it lasted.
2.0,"fuerte. Que los otro, que utilicen material más fuerte ."
2.0,The dress is cute but the way they cut the dress and had the seams it did not do the dress any favors. Mine had a seam right down the middle and it didn’t lay flat.
2.0,It's a big backpack with lots of room buts the straps suck. They got tangled and they just couldn't stay straight
2.0,"The watch is cute, but you get what you pay for. I've only had this watch for a week and it's already falling apart. The wrist band is tearing (as you can see in the pic) and one of the strap bands has already broken off. I needed a basic, inexpensive watch to use so that I don't need to depend on my phone (I have 3 young kids and misplace my phone a lot)... the watch is easy to read, but it's not very comfortable. If you're looking for a decorative watch that you won't wear often, this is a good option. But if you're looking for an everyday kind of watch that is comfortable and will last you a long time... this one is not it."
2.0,Not flattering and looks like a nightgown. Not something that I would wear in public.
2.0,They are exactly as the photo but they broke too easy...
2.0,Pretty but hard to get in the ear took like 20 minutes for each ear.
2.0,This is not an extra large unless you mean an extra large girls size.  I checked the measurements of the item but there is no way it is as big as the measurements said.
2.0,Cute but to large for a person with a small face. I returned them.
2.0,"I ordered the large because I am &#34;busty&#34;. Unfortunately it is still Rather tight in that area but is long on me, so would be much too long if I ordered the X-large. Overall good product otherwise."
2.0,The strap on the small bag broke within 15 minutes of use!! I had to tie a slipknot in the rope to use it for the remainder of my vacation. Disappointing to say the least.
2.0,"It's designed for a man with no genetelia or tooshie. I wish the inside was as smooth as outside. I bought 3x thinking it's going to be nice and loose on him  , and I am not sure what they think 3x is supposed to be , but it's not for a man with extra stuff in that area . My husband doesn't like it."
2.0,Nice looking but super small and fit tight on face
2.0,Too small. Even a size up would have been questionable.  Soft fabric cute top. Too bad.
2.0,"I love this shirt and will be getting more colors.  I’m a size 14 and got a large and it’s a little too big, so I tied it in a knot and I’m good to go!  Not clingy or too low cut at all!"
2.0,These aren't fully true to size and are extremely thin with a very small flare so they almost fall out
2.0,"They are not non skid, they have dots on them but still slide!"
2.0,Description calls this a &#34;boys&#34; watch but the band is way to large for my middle school aged son.
2.0,I got this as a gift but the chain was so badly tangled it broke when I tried to untangle it.  The pendant didn't have much detail on the tiger either.  Disappointed.
2.0,it smells weird. the fit was ok..
2.0,The material of this dress is so uncomfortable!  Way too wrong for summer! I wish I could go back in time and not buy this dress!
2.0,This dress was cute but it’s honestly made for people with bbls. It looked funny on me lol
2.0,"these earring are very pretty, but too heavy to wear comfortably<br />I would not have chosen to buy them if I had known this"
2.0,"These are way too big and slip down easily. I had assumed they would fit tightly, like a knee sock."
2.0,Fabric sucks
2.0,The dots left marks on my legs which I didn't expect. This style was disappointing after having purchased another style by this manufacturer which was very comfortable.
2.0,Disappointingly small.  Might get close to the claimed size if you really stretched it out.  The photo I've added shows the decoration with a man's size 9 shoe for scale. The kid in the product photo must be tiny!
2.0,Wore the shirt once. Washed it in cold water with like colors and dried it in tumble dry low. Shrank.
2.0,This is one of these products that I should have trusted the reviews and skipped it...the necklace was cute but very cheaply made. Came in completely broken in the package just like many others said. You get what you pay for
2.0,"Even harder to get on my feet than the original cooper fit socks I own and once you've got them on, even harder to take off."
2.0,Glasses are nicely made...but only made a slight difference in the night glare.
2.0,"I wasn't sure which option to pick to describe the fit of this bra, since WEIRD FIT is not an option.  On the inside it appeared to have &#34;pockets&#34; that would contain some padding in order to provide some extra lift, but they were empty.  The bra had a very cone-like shape that I can only liken to a Madonna 1985 look.  Before deciding to return it, I tried it on one more time.  I fastened the closure in the front, spun it around, went to put my arm through the first strap and it broke right off!<br /><br />I have ordered other items form this seller that were very high quality, but this one fell below my expectations.  I contacted the seller, and they were very concerned about my satisfaction.  I was able to exchange this item for another item with no trouble.  I would definitely order from them again, but definitely NOT this item.<br /><br />If you found this review to be helpful, please click the YES button below.  Personally, I rely on reviews when deciding what to purchase, and hope that my reviews help guide others.  Your feedback is important to me."
2.0,The. gloves did not have enough fleece. They do not provide much warmth.
2.0,"These fit perfectly and are extremely comfortable. However, after one wash the fabric became thin and fleecy. After two washes they look terrible. Still comfy, but very worn and tacky looking."
2.0,"These boots are so comfortable and for the first month and a half of owning them I couldn't have been happier. They ran a little large but I was wearing thick wool socks so I didn't care, and they had tread on the bottom, unlike many of the boots in this style, which I appreciated while trying to navigate the icy streets of Boston and Cambridge. However, after less than three months of ownership, the fake leather coating has started to come off and the body of the shoe has begun to separate from the sole, compromising the weather-resistant nature of the boot. I had been wearing these to my work (in a neuroscience lab) most days, but not putting any more strain on them than that. Pretty disappointed that they didn't hold up better. I suppose you get what you pay for - lesson learned. My search for a combat-style boot that can hold up against a Boston winter will continue."
2.0,"Runs big. I would order a size down if you want a fitted look. The dress it's a tad bit baggy for my taste, however I kept it because it's easy. Maybe it will shrink when I wash it. Also,  the material is more like long John material."
2.0,They look big enough to fit your glasses but when you see it live there to small so I don't need them
2.0,I return this item it was too small.
2.0,"Eh, it's not the worst thing I've ever purchased.. with that being said, it's far from the best. It is made from swim-suit material, the cup size is very small, and the straps across the front are poorly put together. It is wear-able, but there are better stappy/cage tanks/bras out there."
2.0,"I'm slipping in barre class with these. They probably work okay on a hard floor, but not carpet. :/"
2.0,The short is ok but the top is really tight for a 36 C/D. quite disappointed.
2.0,Bought these to wear under my pants to help with my thighs rubbing together. Honestly I am glad I did not choose to wear them as bike shorts. The seams on 2 out of 3 of these split apart after only 1 or 2 wearings. Not good quality.
2.0,Very costume and cheap
2.0,It's not cut for women with curves.
2.0,They broke in half in my purse and didn't even get to wear them.
2.0,"I am a busty lady, and it fit everywhere except there."
2.0,"Way too long for me. Waist was also too big and the material is heavy, so it was pulling down awkwardly."
2.0,Material is very poor quality. No stretch and can easily tear. I wear a large and I can not fit the bottoms of the shorts. I love the pattern of this set so much. Going to keep and drop a few pounds. However I would recommend to size up because it’s not true to size.
2.0,"So I wish I could give these sunglasses a full 5. The glasses themselves where perfect, loved the polarization the mirror coating on them and they where really cute. The frames and mirror coating was perfect and they were nice and light so they were perfect while on vacation. However having had these for less than a month the soldering came off on both sides of my sunglasses while on vacation and I wasn't able to continue wearing them in fact I had to buy some awful glasses while on vacation. And it wasnt because I pulled them off with one hand or wore them on my head, I've been in optical for years and know when soldering is bad."
2.0,This is more for big breast women. Was baggy on the top area. Also very see through
2.0,Way too small...if u have bigger breaat i suggest a bigger size although the dress itself seems to run small either way.
2.0,Too tight. Wearing it stretches the fabric quite thin.
2.0,Size was too large and they fit loose like my feet are too skinny. Also first time I wore these the threading came off the toe divider. Not impressed at all.
2.0,"The colors are bright and bold, but be careful. They run very small. I also ordered the larger size for my 6’8” son in law. They also ran small, he couldn’t wear them. My husband ended up with the larger ones, and I am using the men’s regular. My women’s size is 9.5 and they barely fit me. You can hear the elastic tearing as I attempt to put them on. Extremely disappointing."
2.0,"Was very unhappy, when my Bible cover was delivered the word GOD was not on the front cover and it was too small for my Bible to fit inside"
2.0,This dress has no shape at all. The picture is cute because the girl is holding her waist and you can’t tell. I wouldn’t recommend it. Maybe if you add a belt it would be cute.
2.0,"Seemed very cute on others who've posted pics but I'm not very thrilled with my purchase. It definitely doesn't feel like cotton, and there's no label anywhere on the shirt to see exactly what it's made out of. I also ordered a size up just in case, but it's still not flattering; every flaw shows lol. I can see wearing the tunic if I order TWO sizes up from my normal size."
2.0,Didn't realize they were meshed. picture doesn't do justice and the hood is a funny shape but decent quality. Wasn't what I expected but good enough to keep
2.0,These gloves are extremely short bot in the finger and at the wrist. Still serviceable but if your your hands are remotely large these will not fit.
2.0,Not as universal as it is described.
2.0,"Bought one as a birthday gift for a friend; returned it for another. Second one arrived worse than the first. Nobody was able to unsnap it without the aid of a knife or screwdriver. Obviously these are not tested before they are shipped. The only reason that I gave two stars instead of one is that the leatherwork is great and it had the leather belt loop I was looking for - only it would be impossible to access the snuff can from the belt, once snapped shut.. Instead of returning this one, I am going to drill out the snap, glue the emblem on and make it a Velcro closure (would love to find something like this with a magnetic closure). If you don't plan on going to all this trouble, good luck to you."
2.0,Quality is Bad!!!! Not exactly what I thought I bought. WASTE OF MONEY!!!!
2.0,Must be sized for a child.  I bought the XXL it was extremely small.  This garment is not made for women in the US because it definitely is not true to size.
2.0,"SLIP OFF FEET, MY MOM HAS A SIZE 10 1/2 FOOT"
2.0,a little smaller than expected even though it is stretchy but sill nice and sparkly
2.0,"Quality is so-so, I’ve seen worse.  It looks like a garment I would’ve made in home economics. Save your money. I’ll use it to lounge around the house but that’s about it."
2.0,I like the sneakers the only thing is.I would suggest is that you buy a size bigger because they are hard to put on if they are the exact size of their foot
2.0,"The design, size and weight of the necklace is great. For the price this looks nice, however the metal necklace charm bends easily with even the slightest touch and it feels very brittle to the point you believe it may break at any second. If I could use this to make a basic mold and then re-cast the design I would, I may look into resin casting to do this."
2.0,ended up giving them to my daughter because they were way to small for me.
2.0,"really cute, but it fell apart as soon as i got it. The button holding the purse strap on fell off completely and i had to glue it on to get it to stay put. It also looks like the stitching on one of the straps is starting to come undone. I can probably fix that myself too but I'm still a bit disappointed. On the plus side, the studs on the front of the bag seem to be set pretty well."
2.0,Fit good but did not like how heavy the material was plus it clings to you in back. Returned it. Definitely not a good buy for a bigger woman
2.0,"Liked it, but sent it back. The back of one arm was missing the stripes."
2.0,Not very good quality. Broke the first day my daughter wore it.
2.0,It looked really nice but I guess I should of sowed an extra line through it because it came apart before I could actually wear it.
2.0,Very cheaply made! The chain looks like its from the $ store and the image is very foggy.
2.0,"Cute, but smaller than I expected. They didn't really match me too well because of their size, but I was able to give them to my niece, who looks really cute in them."
2.0,"I love this bracelet I wore it daily for about a month and a half and it just broke! I am super disappointed about it! All the reviews talked about it being super comfortable and durable, I can’t help but feel like that last bit was a lie"
2.0,It was not worth my money I loved it at first but the chain broke so easily
2.0,"These look nice out of the box.  Then my husband wore them for a total of 15 minutes and one of the sides had a blow out.  Upon closer inspection, I noticed the stitching which should have held the sole to the upper was never stitched together.  Now I'm going to try and fix them.  Sucks."
2.0,"I have finally found shoe liners that actually feel good on, do NOT slip off, and practically hide in my shoes.  They are silky soft, and the little silicone strip that is as thin as a strip of cellophane tape, does not impact the fit of shoes in the heel area, yet keeps them in place.  I wore my first pair for 13hrs straight in low heeled pumps and hardly knew they were there.  Really looking forward to trying them with loafers next.  I think I will hand wash these though so that the silicone lasts, though I think that if you put them in a mesh bag in the washer they would be fine - just don't put in the dryer.<br />EDIT: Worn the second time, after washing and air drying, and they are falling apart. Very sad 😞"
2.0,The dress was cute but the straps are a nightmare. I tried to make the dress smaller but the straps would not adjust and got all tangled. I couldn't even wear it.
2.0,"I have only had this bag for less than a month, and the lining has torn. I love all of the pockets, but the lining has torn so bad, I have to replace the bag already."
2.0,"Sweatshirt is fine, however the decoration is cheap and much smaller than it appears online"
2.0,"Really really pretty in person but I had a terrible reaction to whatever metal these are made out of. Couldn't stand to keep them in for more than 5 minutes without horrible itching.  Avoid if you have sensitive skin. Too bad, I loved the style."
2.0,Too thin and developed hole after few uses. I would not buy again
2.0,"These pants look nice, feel super soft and comfortable, but they are very short, very slim fitting from the knee down, and have absolutely no stretch to them."
2.0,The bag that I received was of a greyish color which isn't what was on the picture.<br />The outer surface of the bag is of a suede material and makes scratches like a cat scratch.<br />I don't know if its normal or not.<br />I thought it was gonna be like the doctor's bag that we see in old movies.<br />I'm returning it.
2.0,Not real feel flannel and is way small.... disappointed
2.0,"I ordered a Large. Fits like an XL. I can't return it because i live in Asia and had this shipped through a forwarder. The quality is great, the fabric and and stitching is ok. i wish i've ordered a Medium. I will buy a Medium if i get to sell this, but im not keeping my hopes up."
2.0,It’s not good!
2.0,cheap!!!!
2.0,Looks pretty but bends too easily!!!!!! Not worth it!!!
2.0,"This Polyester polo comes in a variety of colors, is soft on the skin and lightweight. It has a pleasing design, though the fabric is so thin that the collar does not retain its shape well. But the biggest issue is that the sizing runs way too big. I'm an athletic six-one, 175 and normally wear a Large polo, but the Large in this shirt fits like an XXL. Unless I wear a thick undershirt or pack on another 30 pounds, it isn't something I'm going to be able to use. Recommend sizing down two sizes if you are thinking about buying this product."
2.0,"Too small at the bust, however the legs are disproportionately too long."
2.0,Item is not unisex as a medium is more like a men's small.
2.0,My girlfriend left me.
2.0,"It's pretty if the sizing were right it'd be a 5 star, the bottoms are the correct size  for a 18-24 month old but the top is enormous, would fit  my 8 year old niece. Awkward."
2.0,it had no support for my DD cups
2.0,This purse was just ok.  I sent it back because it was too large.  I will say that the straps are long enough to be used on the shoulder.
2.0,"I purchased in both 9-10 and 11-12, since I am a 10 and thought to cover all bases.<br />Both are too small, and the padding at the bottom is almost non-existent.<br />My faulty really; should have know that $10 for a pair of house slippers was too good to be true."
2.0,"I really wanted to love this dress but there was absolutely no stretch in the bust. Fit great every where else but not for girls with even a slight bosom! In 36 D and 5'2""and ordered the large which was recommended size."
2.0,"Material thin, returned item but was returned back to me with the statement “vacant unable to forward”"
2.0,"I had to send this back. It was way too big, the fabric is not very soft"
2.0,Very bad smell ! Poor quality ! OK for a work hat but not for dress! Seems unevenly sown ! Does not look like pic!
2.0,"Color red does not have opalescent sheen as one in picture, ring was very thin with no green stones as shown in picture. Weird slit around the bottom half."
2.0,Everything seems fine except the wand it’s cheap material it came broken apart
2.0,"A good product, but only came in &#34;one size fits all.&#34;  As I wear a medium size 10, I didn't expect it to be too small--ONE SIZE DID NOT FIT ALL.  I advise only the very small to buy this top."
2.0,Fabric is Rayon. I didn’t know it was wrinkly. Ran small
2.0,It looked like a pretty expensive gift but stopped working after few days.
2.0,They to big on the bottom part and not talking about my arse... and to me it wasn't high waisted either..
2.0,Too large and the size was wrong
2.0,"I guess this belt can't handle line dancing? Second time wearing it the part that goes in the hole snapped off. Don't buy. Spend money on a real belt buckle, not a cheap plastic buckle!"
2.0,"Very disappointed with these shoes. I have a pair of the exact same shoes in black. These shoes came a bit scuffed up, so I used the shoe clean on them and this material does NOT clean very well. It takes the color from the dirt or whatever had rubbed against it, and it does NOT go away. Don't think that the &#34;Ironstone&#34; color variant is anything like the true leather back, brown, etc. It is very hard to clean with very little protective coating preventing them from getting scuffed or dirty. Mine are permanently discolored."
2.0,I won't be able to wear this. I ordered in the measurements recommended and it was pretty far off.
2.0,Very flat and without any bulk at all. It looks like a sweater that you would buy from the dollar store. I returned it.
2.0,These were below the knee on my daughter who is 5’6”. They are for her Halloween costume so we are very disappointed. The quality is nice but they are definitely not what was picture nor described. We bought 2 pairs but I have not opened the 2nd pair yet.
2.0,"Tiny! Said it was for kindergarten age, it was short on my two year old!"
2.0,"I so wanted to love these ties, so much so that I ordered enough stuff to get one day shipping. Ordered last night, they woke me up today delivering - so shipping was ridiculously fast. The ties themselves are ""attractive"" - they do not however have any POP, muted colors and no sheen making them very matte if you will. They clearly are not Silk and are thicker making them short when tied especially since they aren't even the length they say they are in the listing, see pic. I guess you get what you pay for but these are not high end, they are not for professionals, yes maybe a high school prom but nothing more"
2.0,"The pendant is great, but the chain turned a dark color and turned my neck green. I thought it was titanium, but it must be some other cheap metal or coating"
2.0,"I gave this product and extra star only because it's the exact product as shown. I got this as a gift for a friend, he could not fit it at all. I got an XL (his normal size) and it was very snug. The arms were too tight. Disappointed really."
2.0,"I wear a Small or Medium in tops and the medium fit as expected. The design is nice, what I couldn’t get passed is the fact that the fabric reminds me of mosquito netting...two layers of white mosquito netting. Ultimately I’m returning it and I’ve already ordered a nice Calvin Klein top in a similar style that, at least I know is quality that matches its price."
2.0,material is see through.
2.0,cute but sized weird and not great fabric
2.0,Alllllll of them stretched out of shape.2 of them broke and we were very careful to roll the on not stretch them. They are flimsy and the beads very dull. Not real but gem stones as advertised but mine were mostly plastic.
2.0,The top of the hair was really bizarre it made me look like Johnny Bravo. I looked more like SheRa with my own hair.
2.0,Quality sucks!! It's see thru!
2.0,I gives these a 3 star because they are not thigh high they don't even go over my knees they are only knee high kind of disappointed was really look forward to the thigh high
2.0,Split the butt. Had to return but looked so cute :(
2.0,"Not as comfortable as you'd expect, and a weird pouch. More gimmicky than anything."
2.0,"It should be noted that the adjustable strap on this white tie is a black fabric.  So, I wouldn't recommend this tie if you are wearing it with a white wing-tip shirt.  The black fabric is slightly exposed on the backside of your color which makes it look like a cheap-o tie you would get in a tuxedo rental.  I have no idea why they would choose a black fabric for the adjustable strap on a white tie."
2.0,"Not quite the fit and flare as the picture shows, the waist since made me look pregnant.  May just be my torso length and where it fell on me, but I returned it."
2.0,Cheap material.  Not sure how long it will last.  It's ok size wise.
2.0,They are well made but ordered 2 times even oversized and they are still small
2.0,"Super cute, fix as expected but they were ruined after 4 hours.. missed the return window by 2 days so I’m stuck with shoes I’ll never wear again"
2.0,Not great if you have an hourglass shape. The waist was perfect but the fabric squished my boobs down into a lumpy shape even after I tried wearing it braless. The zipper on the side made the fabric poke up and start rolling up my hip on one side unil it was more loose at my waist.
2.0,"Lenses arrived nicely packaged and of course on time with Amazon Prime. The lenses are of good quality, but they are certainly thinner than original Oakley lenses. There is a bit of play with the lenses once inserted into the frames. For the price paid, can't complain too much. Can get 3 of sets for price of 1 original lenses.<br /><br />Edit: after wearing for 6 months, the lenses seem to have layers separating on the edges. Causing some distorted vision to the point can't use them anymore."
2.0,"I was really excited when I got this necklace and loved the look, but  unfortunately I only wore it twice and the clasp broke!"
2.0,"I purchased this shirt in another color and fir was perfect, but this white one came a little small.  I don't know if this is a manufacture issue or the material.  Other than that its good for the price"
2.0,Product is about a size or two too big and is not the same as the picture.
2.0,"Very difficult to install. Very difficult to adjust. While trying to install and then adjust it, I broke 3 nails and bent the silly tool they included. There are no instructions anywhere and honestly I would have paid more money for an instruction booklet. It was very frustrating. Otherwise this band is a beautiful color and weight. I bought this for my Fossil Q, and it fits perfectly and the rose gold matches well."
2.0,"Fits well, but the picture looks faded."
2.0,"I read the other two reviews that said this top was too small, so I ordered one size up. I wish I hadn't. This top is big on me, and my normal size probably would have been better. This tank top also cuts down _way_ lower than I thought it would, revealing part of my bra, so I'll probably never wear it. Would return it, but return shipping is 3$, which isn't worth it for a 5$ shirt."
2.0,"They fit great, and were working well for summer &#34;puddle splashing&#34; shoes for my 2 year old. Unfortunately after about a month of use, they rubbed a big blister into the side of his arch, so we have to trash them. Too bad. They were otherwise nice."
2.0,Item arrived scratched
2.0,Very cute watch but the knob for the dial broke off today-I’ve only had the watch for 3 weeks. If not for that i’d Give it 4 Stars for sure! The length of the wrap seems a bit long but I also have small wrists.
2.0,"The picture is so cute, however this suit runs way too small.  The ""shorts"" ride up too.  I recommend sizing up at least 1 size if you're going to try it."
2.0,Incredibly see thru. They were so cheap I’ll keep them for PJs. But I would not get another pair or recommend them.
2.0,the hole in the bar to put the cap in is painful putting in. your gums get snagged on it. putting the cap on isn’t very easy either
2.0,"Ordered the same size I always wear, and it didn't even come close to zipping up, so had to return..."
2.0,Cute dress but was made odd with two different patterns of material (see photos)
2.0,These felt great at first but upon actually wearing them they became very uncomfortable and caused a big blister. So sad because they are worn and I cannot return.
2.0,Pretty however too large to wear on a pandora bracelet. The charm hangs to low. I placed it on a necklace and it looked great. I like it but gave 2 stars as it can't be worn as intended which is disappointing.
2.0,"While it is the right color and not off-white, I ordered the dress with sleeves and i got a completely different dress. The length of the lace is longer and it's also an xs, which i found out fit me but I'm pretty sure I ordered a small. I can work with it, but find another dress if you want to get what you see."
2.0,Got these through Gander Mountain for jail use. Used lightly for 1 month then grip started coming off. Would not buy again.
2.0,The straps stretched out within the first two days of wear. Now very loose. Foot moves forward which is uncomfortable.
2.0,Not what I expected.....looked used.......paint chipped off.....DO NOT waste you money!!
2.0,Well I was so excited to get this ring finally just to open it up and both of the stones are exactly the same one was supposed to be October and one was supposed to be March now I have to mess with returning it in the mail printing a shipping label that is not fair to me
2.0,Loose fit dose not apply to this product.  Xxxl and fits like a large.  Gave it to the wife. And was a little tight on her..
2.0,Not as they seem. I thought it would be more of a loose fitting tank top and it is not. Plus it is super long and is more like a beater tank style.
2.0,"The listing says men’s watch, but it’s much smaller than my last Casio, Model: W-800H-1AVCF. Not only is the face/watch itself smaller, but the band is much shorter too. It actually fits my 5 year old. I can fasten it, but there’s hardly no band left. I like the color but wish it fit like my last Casio."
2.0,"I was disappointed with most of the bras I got. Some were fine but others didn't last me but maybe 4 months or less. The underwire came off of them during me wearing them. The hooks would twist after washing (even when using a wash bag specifically for bras). And the lace on most wore off within weeks. I definitely wouldn't be buying again. If you want a bra that looks good for only wearing 3 times, then I would suggest these."
2.0,way too small in my nose and doesn’t look good
2.0,Material is very comfortable but it definitely is too small you will need to buy a size up and maybe 2 sizes if you don't have a perfect model body.  Mom body and shows all your imperfections
2.0,"Sheds ENORMOUSLY, & itches."
2.0,No liner made these very uncomfortable for my husband
2.0,They were very comfortable at first then after a couple weeks noticed they weren’t supporting my arch as well
2.0,Extremely cheap looking and made. No holes in the back clasp to put earring through!!!!Won't be using this seller again and I do a lot of online shopping!
2.0,Top and bottoms made of completely different fabric so they feel odd and bottoms discolor immediately…looks pretty worn after one wash n doesn’t match the top whatsoever
2.0,Doesn't work at all for lift.
2.0,The top was made wonderful but the buttons I feel like they didn’t put a lot of effort into it and I feel like the bottoms are made from very cheap  material. Love the top but  actually hate the bottoms.
2.0,to big!
2.0,This isn't a bad watch band by any means but the false advertising of it being tool free with the quick change pins isn't true. It has regular pins and requires a tool to install. It did however provide the tool.
2.0,"Recently ordered again after buying this hoodie at the start of quarantine thinking I'd get the same things, I was disappointed to say the least. The first hoodie I ordered was solid, really good quality, thick hoodie. It even withstood a motorcycle crash going 40 mph and sliding on pavement for 20 feet. (shown in pictures. While the new hoodie looks mostly the same it feels cheap, thin, and sub par to almost any other hoodie i own. It's disappointing seeing an amazon seller go downhill but here we are. I'd look for something built to last like maybe a nike fleece, straight from the nike website and not amazon sellers that cut corners for profits."
2.0,It's really cute and looks good but was incredibly hard to put on because of the design. It was painful to put in my rook piercing and painful to take out .
2.0,The product arrived with a hole in the arm sleeve on the seam near the armpit.  I was disappointed because the dress was exactly what I was looking for with length and color.  I posted that it fit as expected but I didn't try it on.  I held it up to check the length and noticed the hole so I packaged it back up to return.
2.0,cut 2 sizes too small
2.0,Huge. A lot bigger then expected. Had a few blemishes. Returned.
2.0,very small for 3x
2.0,"Wore these on two different Ski trips this winter, both during pretty cold weather. Was barely able to bare the cold on my fingers during the first trip, by the first day of the second trip though, I could no longer take it. Ended up having to buy better gloves at a shop located at the warming hut at the top of the mountain. These also had issues keeping moisture out as well. Just made for a miserable experience.<br />Don't skimp on gloves, spend a little more for a better product."
2.0,A beautiful shoe but the buckle is for cosmetic purposes and isn't attached to the shoe. It's attached to strap but just hangs. The strap actually gets looped thru a clip which isn't secure. I thought I'd taken a picture but it didn't save. Terribly made shoe.
2.0,It didn't have enough stretch.
2.0,I gave this necklace as a Christmas gift for my daughter who now lives a distance away from us. The words expressed the endearing message I wanted my daughter to embrace in my absence. My disappointment was how tiny the heart was; so tiny it really requires a magnifying glass to read! They say that the thought counts - true. In this case size also matters! I was happy that my daughter graciously accepted the gift. If I had more time I would have returned it.
2.0,Way way too large..adorable suit.
2.0,"I purchased two sizes, the small and large. They arrived today in exactly the same packaging and seem to be the exact same size. Why are sizes offered if they are the same socks?!"
2.0,As for a mask for co er face during Covid-19...way too thing material.  Air and moisture  moves right thru it.
2.0,"They look great. They feel nice. Good price for a 2 pack too but they won't hold up.<br /><br />I'm not small, 245lbs. Thought I'd be the one to break one of these but my tiny 11yo girl (80lbs) ripped off one of the straps while trying to hang on after being flipped.<br />Btw, this was only the 2nd time using these.<br /><br />Invest in something studier if you're big or plan to do something rougher than class 0.5 rapids.<br />Hope this helps someone. Take care all."
2.0,This is way to large.  I ordered the 6-12 month and it looks like it would fit a 2yr old.  The headband is gigantic.  Its cute but totally not useable.
2.0,"I tried it on once and then when it was time for me to wear it on my vacation out of the country, the strap broke. It was too late for me to exchange it. The skirt is nice and material is great as well. The waistband kept flipping up and I had to fold it back down several times."
2.0,"I got these for my husband because he is a Veteran and has some bad boot feet, and between his toes is cracked and bleeding no matter how much baby power is used. So these are helping greatly.<br /><br />Issue is they are unraveling at the top that goes around the leg. This is why I am giving it such a low rating. It's not a few. It is all of them. They are being done on delicate cycle with like delicates. Don't hold up well....<br /><br />As with anything toe the fit is going to be different with different kinds and shapes of toes."
2.0,"Love the Cap , But Im very disappointed 2 sizes too small not Adult size ,"
2.0,The sizing is great but the literally used a hole punch to make the “destroyed” look.  Returning.
2.0,"It is stiff, it doesn’t feel flow like regular cotton! It feels more like is too stretching."
2.0,"The material is mostly soft, but more clingy than I anticipated unfortunately. It doesn't fit well for my body type which is curvy for sure."
2.0,The picture indicated these socks would be gray. They arrive to my house Mint green! They are socks and will be used. However very deceptive to the picture
2.0,One of them was ripped inside of the package
2.0,These jammers are not for someone who swims everyday. They won’t last long
2.0,I am very disappointed it is roughing up the edges of my playing cards. I stopped using it.
2.0,"These do exactly what they promise and no extra. They are clear, plastic retainers. People have complained about the inside piece being too large... For me that was not the problem... For me they were too sharp and literally cur the inside of my lips..."
2.0,Fabric quality is not the best.
2.0,"I really want to like this dress, but unfortunately I am not a fan.<br /><br />The material is ok, it is pretty soft but not the best I have worn to date. Overall the dress is well sown. I am a size 14 usually, wear an XL. I am 5'7"" and about 200lbs. I bought this in a size XL and it fits, however at my hiny, I had a weird gathering of material just about my rear. It was really unflattering and weird. Other than that it looked and fitted well, but obviously I can't really run around with some weird bunched up material in that area.<br /><br />I am also not sure about tieing that bow tie right at my neck. The green is a nice forest green.<br /><br />Sadly because of the bunching in the back, I can't say I am am a fan since I really can't wear it as it is at this point."
2.0,My daughter loves these and they give her great traction on slippery surfaces. If they hadn't started coming apart at the front end after 4 hours of wear I would give them 5 stars. Since these aren't meant for only 1 time wear I need to give 2 stars.
2.0,My order came to me with 5 random bandanas and not the pack I specifically ordered. I did connect with Amazon and was issued a $5 credit to compensate. When I tried this on it was too loose. I am a female with a smaller face and these did not fit or stay on. The other big issue with these as face coverings is that you cannot talk with them because the fabric gets sucked up in your mouth. I'm sure these will work fine for hair bands or any of the other uses it describes but it did not work as a face mask for me at all.
2.0,Fits very small - ordered a medium.
2.0,This product was smaller then what I expected and material was very cheap
2.0,"Super cute umbrella but VERY FRAGILE.  The main umbrella bar broke in half after one use and it was only a light rain.  I've seen an umbrella arm break where it attaches to the fabric, but never the main bar just break in half like this did.  So disappointed."
2.0,Make you look like a tank
2.0,It is not like pictured. It is way shorter. It is super thin and cheap material. I guess you get what you pay for
2.0,disappointed in the sizing...not true to size
2.0,El bra tiene una forma muy fea
2.0,Too big to work with constantly in the gatden
2.0,Poor quality and hard to close<br />I change bands all the time and have other deployment clasps that are far better for less money. The clamp is way too hard for my wife to close and doesn’t feel trustworthy even when latched
2.0,My glasses are average size and my head is BIG but these clip ins were too big for my glasses . I'm getting prescription sunglasses from zenni. I also got &#34;over glasses&#34; at local grocery store and these are much better.
2.0,This was nice but I only received one of them when it clearly says pack of 2.
2.0,"This mask would have worked great if it wasn't so tight. My face is not large and it was tight on me, it was even tighter when inserting the filter."
2.0,Rust too fast
2.0,I loved the material and the pockets but the sizing was really bad.
2.0,It fit nice and all but it broke
2.0,"It is completely loose, I meant it seems like someone stretched the thing to see how much it would hold. I love the design, the materials look good enough and the map is great with very decent detail, but it looks like a worn sock that no longer holds on your leg. I am quite disappointed by the product, would be getting another cover in no time."
2.0,Theses are ok to wear around the house.  Not great for exercise.  The fabric is very thin.
2.0,The only good thing I can think of to say about this bracelet is that I didn't pay much for it.  Shipping took FOREVER and it is very cheaply made.  It is definitely not something you want to give as a gift.  Save your money.
2.0,"after the rain, dyed my clothing. only used for work three times by now, carried nothing extraordinarily heavy, and it's already showing some wear. looks like I bought a very delicate bag."
2.0,I ordered these briefs last summer in assorted colors and they were great. This batch in pure white is scratchy .Am hoping they will be softer after washing. Am disappointed in Hanes as the quality has gone down. Cotton is much thinner as well.
2.0,"Too small, fit snug in some areas but long in the sleeves. Good warm material but not what I was looking for, especially because it didn't fit."
2.0,The top screw on piece pinches the skin. Otherwise good quality.
2.0,Just received. The Prong came off completely and would not change the time!<br />The glass looks like plastic as well
2.0,Not the best quality will last you for 2-3 laundry cycle than will have holes and will fall apart
2.0,Very cute belt but it didn’t holed up well after just a few wears. The brown “leather” part is peeling off.
2.0,"Noisy. Seriously, could have 2 windchimes from them."
2.0,I'll start by saying it is a cute belt but definitely cheaply made. The loop fell off before even putting it on the 1st time and it's definitely  A lOT smaller than the measurements indicate. It was nice that they included a belt hole puncher though
2.0,the bracelet is amazing but the chain is very easy to break
2.0,I returned this dress. The material looked cheap and poor quality.
2.0,I was very happy to receive these early. Until I opened them. One of the post had broken completely off and the other bent.
2.0,"I gave this as a Christmas gift.  The bracelet was what I expected it was darling.  The earrings not so much.  I was actually embarrassed to include them in the gift.  You could barely tell they were ballerina slippers.  Most of the pink paint on the bows was non existent...mostly either chipped off or never made it on the bows in the first place.  I told the little girl I gave them to I would get her a pair of earring at a later date as I was not happy with them.[[ASIN:B01DAO1KME Girls Pink Dance Jewelry Set-Dance Bracelet & Dance Earrings, Perfect Gift For Dance Recitals, Dancers and Dance Teams]]"
2.0,"So, I had these for 1 day. The rainbow reflection got rubbed off? Idk how thats possible. Cute design and color, terrible production and material. Dissapointed."
2.0,"Cost was reasonable but sizing is the main reason for my two star review.  While I will not return this, I should have paid more attention to what these meant: Total Length:157cm/ 61.8&#34;. Shoulder Width: 56cm/22&#34;.  That's an XXL.  Huge suit.  Can use it for my huge friend that occasionally helps me with the hives.  But be careful with what size you order."
2.0,"Got it for a Halloween costume, and it was just gross.  The hair looked more like Einstein - HUGE, poofy and scraggely. There was no way to salvage it, and we ended up just throwing it away...  Oh well, at least it was cheap!"
2.0,The shoes are ok. The Velcro doesn’t stay on well at all. My shoes arrived with glue spilled all over them that I can’t get off.
2.0,"I followed the cart and when they came I could fit 3 of me in them,runs way to big got to get them 2 size smaller, otherwise you will drowned in them. Not to happy that I spent the money on them and can't even ware them because they are to big."
2.0,Top runs small. Must  size up one or two sizes.  The fabric is thin but not see through. It would  be ok to wear to the park or grocery store. Very casual.
2.0,Broke after a few times of wear.
2.0,"Glasses worked ok with night driving, however lens cracked when I took them off. No frame on lower part of lens makes them prone to breaking."
2.0,I'm size 16/18 and an XL fits but its super snug as in pic. I'm a 40DD so the buttons pulled however great for sexy time but I'm single right now lol.
2.0,"Thin material. Not good quality. Not quite long enough to go below the ankle for me. Im 5'9"" so yea im used to that, but these are flares so it looks silly. Good quality yoga pants have a thicker and more strechy material. These are just not good. Ill keep them for the summer because the waist is decent and I can cut them for shorts."
2.0,"I was not able to return this because I accidentally removed the tag. I ordered a medium, and it was more like an extra large.  It’s too bad because the fabric was actually very soft and I would’ve like it if the size was true to its description."
2.0,Lots of hair it will for any style
2.0,It’s a nice t-shirt  but the neck line hangs too much it almost looks like you washed it too much and it stretched
2.0,These are usually my fav riding pants but the quality has really gone down hill! These are only a few months old and they already have a hole at the bottom of the knee patch and the seams on the thighs are coming apart. Total waste of money. I’m glad I returned the other pair these ones will be headed to the trash soon enough. For $100plus riding pants I expect better from this brand. Totally bummed
2.0,Fell apart after two times of wearing.
2.0,"pants took a very long time to arrive, but i was prepared for the wait, but what came were these tiny leggings for someone who weighs 90 pounds and they are screen printed. cheap pants yes, but you get what you pay for. I will be finding someone much small than me to give them to"
2.0,They are a bit snug when my grandbaby slides her feet in and she is Petite and still are snug for her as her feet don't go in all the way so I would recommend buying a size bigger
2.0,The base doesn't stay locked into place when you stretch the Bungee cord so very limited capacity for something tall. I returned it.
2.0,this was the heaviest earring. I can't even wear them because they just hang down and all you can see is the top of the pirate hat.
2.0,I loved it when i first received it.... Like 30 mins ago... It fits perfectly. Nice and warm. Then i went to take it off and heard a snap.... I'm so bummed.
2.0,"The top is nice, but the bottoms were way too small.  Also, not great quality.  I  had to send it back."
2.0,Sweatshirt runs small and the print is faded. Also takes long to ship. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Eh, cute but size up and don't do a lot of walking in these."
2.0,I had my doubts and bought the socks anyways. They are too small if you have a shoe size of 12 US.  They need to have a better description/sizes listed for these socks.
2.0,"The fabric is soft and comfortable, but the stitching on the top caused some strange bunching that didn't sit nicely when worn."
2.0,Didn't fit right. I sent it back.
2.0,"I ordered these in a men's big and tall size and the item that came, while nicely styled and patterned, was fit for a woman's size small. Medium at a stretch. A disappointment given the lovely pattern and cool material for the warmer months."
2.0,"I have a cochlear implant, so have to have cloth straps else if metal, the magnetism connection would lock onto the metal part of my implant.  That's just the way it is."
2.0,These are metal posts not plastic. My daughter bought these with her own money and can’t wear them now because she is allergic to metal.
2.0,"Cute style....but, FAR TOO SMALL. Had to return.  :("
2.0,This is more like a medium/large than a small. Had to return.
2.0,Not work good. Don’t buy this watch !<br />Don’t loose your money!
2.0,I love this shirt but it is wayyyy too wide.
2.0,The material felt like paper towels and was completely see through. It didn't fit or look at all like what I was hoping and runs small.
2.0,Did not do the job and stained the hat
2.0,"They are definitely not near true to size...super small...I always buy a large in the brand I usually wear, so I bought a la4he and an d large and could not get either pair on...more like a small and medium..."
2.0,"Really cute skirt but I didn't feel comfortable wearing something that tight. Very snug in the derriere, hips, and thighs. I suggest ordering a size larger if you want to try it."
2.0,"My son can fix in size 4, he’s only turn 3... smaller than I thought, the hat couldn’t wearing at all, not deep to your head, keep fallen out when my son moving his head... don’t like it.<br />I couldn’t return because my son make it dirty at 3s wearing it 😂."
2.0,Not made well. Clasp would  not shut firmly.
2.0,"I ordered this on August 6th and it arrived today August 18th, sooner than i expected (it was supposed to be deliver by september 1st). Well you get what you pay for, low quality and it's nothing like the picture."
2.0,These are glitter and not stones. Glitter flakes off really easily.
2.0,"Sizing is way too big for a medium! It's a cute shirt, but keep in mind that the color is off. It's more of an orangey red than fire brick red."
2.0,The bag is not symmtrical in design and alot of thread came loose from the handle. The material is extremely stiff and makes it difficult to open the bag. Wouldnt purchase again. I live in the Caribbean so returning is not an option.
2.0,"I like the telescope feature for easy storage but the part that goes in your shoe was flimsy and bent within the first week. We can use it bent, I just feel like it should have held up. Great concept too bad it wasn’t sturdier."
2.0,I like that it is long and has slits... I don’t the cheapness of the material and the arms were very tight
2.0,Way too small  I ordered  xxl  I am 6'2&#34; 215lbs
2.0,"Very cute, but the silver toned plating is very thin, and wears off quickly. There's bits of copper showing through, and I've only worn ta small handful of times."
2.0,changed colors in 1 day wearing
2.0,I bought the L/XL. I am 6'1&#34; tall and wear a size 12 shoe. The sock only comes 3/4 up my calf. This leaves a compression ring around my leg and if you are using these to prevent swelling you could be in serious trouble. The reality is it is a little bigger than a large and a little smaller than an extra large.
2.0,"Too small, not trifecta size"
2.0,Too small in the shoulders
2.0,Unfortunately this doesn’t work for long torsos! I am 5’4” 135-140lbs and the fit is a mess on me! The waist area is big and gaps in the back and the length of the swimsuit is too short. It’s really cute and nice quality though!
2.0,"1.) The gloves come from China and take weeks and weeks to arrive. I wondered if they would arrive in time for winter, they did.<br />2.)  I ordered size 4-6. I can easily fit my hand inside the mitten. They are too big and the Velcro closing is a joke.<br />3.)  I will give them a try, but am sure they will not keep out the snow due to the fact that the wrist opening is much too large.<br />I don't recommend."
2.0,I found myself constantly pulling them up yet the size was accurate.
2.0,I ordered this for a trip to Iceland.  It was much to large and too heavy to pack so returned it.
2.0,Chain was cheap and wasnt steel turning skin that nice green colour when you wear like a copper piece.
2.0,"I was excited about getting this but when it came, the design was pretty but the material it was made of was disappointing. I’m sure it’s stainless steel as listed, however, it feels almost plastic like. In fact, my husband swears it’s plastic (I’m giving the makers the benefit of the doubt, though.) I know it was inexpensive and in this case, you get what you pay for."
2.0,"Washed it once, all of the writing on the back came off... Not a happy camper"
2.0,"Top fit perfectly, the bottoms were very big"
2.0,The material is too tin was expecting something thicker
2.0,"The colors are great and bright but the fitting on me is somewhat large. I’m 5’1 and got the small size.  It will need a small alteration to fit better. I would cut the sleeves off a little shorter though, so I don’t look like I’m wearing a curtain."
2.0,I love but falls apart to easy
2.0,Horrible material and see through
2.0,"Sweater didn’t seem like it would last very long. Was too thin in many spots, and had a couple frayed spots too."
2.0,Way too big for my size need to size it down like two sizes
2.0,Only 2 of the 6 hats fit my head... because they’re different sizes and materials. Very bummed.
2.0,They are very front heavy and constantly slid off my face as a result. They aren't malleable either so you can't really adjust them to try and fit your nose or head better. If it weren't for the cheap quality they would be super cute!
2.0,"This is an inexpensive product..it wears that way.  Not the most comfortable, legs stretch too much during normal usage."
2.0,"I bought them for a heavy pendant I own....not a good choice! Because the product is stainless steel, it doesn’t match well with sterling silver or platinum plated items. It looks more black/tarnished than true silver. Also, the end pieces are too large for most bales to fit over."
2.0,"I ordered the correct size for my son, but the headpiece is so small he can’t even attach the Velcro pieces. It looks like it’s meant for a 3 year old. I don’t know if that’s how it’s supposed to be or if it’s the wrong size but we are very disappointed. The costume itself fits fine but it looks like one wrong move and it will tear apart."
2.0,"Inexpensive set of 2 bracelets.  Could not get the end off one of the bracelets.  Was able to get an end off the second to add a charm. After wearing two times, the end fell off and I was unable to get it to stay on.  Luckily, I was able to find the charm.  Will use the first bracelet as a bangle only."
2.0,Were smaller then stated
2.0,"Even tho this is 14K gold, it is thin and cheap.  You'd think after spending $55 they could have put it in a jewelry box or something other than a little plastic bag.  Don't waste your money."
2.0,These are so cute! However a piece of mine broke whenever I was trying to put them on. I also noticed that one peg is shorter than the other. :(
2.0,"Item fit fine, but the top is hard and molded. Arrived with a dent from it being folded inwards to fit into the other bust for shipping. Would not unwrinkle. I returned the item."
2.0,Cute but not worth buying. I didn't realize that you could pull the bow part out until my son got into my daughters bow box and ruined all of them before she could even wear them
2.0,"I ordered this dress in Blue, size small to wear during my summer family vacation.  Wanted something light weight, comfortable, with minimal effort that I can throw on to go out with the family.  I'm 5'3; 160 lbs and usually wear a small in maxi dresses.  This dress was a loose fit on me and the color is not blue, but rather purple.  I'm sure that this would appear to be a minor detail to most, but I ordered this dress in blue and expected blue.  Due to the ill-fitting design and misrepresentation of the color, I will return this garment."
2.0,This dress looked cheap & ran very very small. Returned
2.0,Very cheap feeling.  I can't see how this is leather.  I wish I had listened to the negative reviews.
2.0,"Not an adult size, too small that it's more for my toddler's head more."
2.0,"To get these on you have to unthread the points on these, then run the rod through the back of the wedge, through your ear, then through the other side of the wedge. Ate this you have to screw the microscopic point back on with one hand,  while the other holds the mess together by your face."
2.0,"Fabric was low quality, borderline feels like a tent and plastic like. The bow/tie was missing from my package. It fit ok, but was boxy and not super flattering. Was hoping for more of a linen. I wouldn’t even want to iron it because I think it would melt. Very see through, even with the “liner” it was still super see through, I’d have to wear a full nude colored slip or body suit underneath."
2.0,The photo is not like the actual purse. The proportion with the model is super off. The purse is a lot smaller and the hardware is cheap looking gold. Not as in the picture. The tote is small and can't be carried in shoulder by handles and the long strap is across like a cheap cross body . Pocket in front in picture not in the actual purse. Leather looking in description.. cheap vynil. I am so disappointed.
2.0,Not what I expected inside
2.0,Unfortunately this is rediculously small - so sad cause it's a Super cute swim suite<br />but it is seriously extra extra small !<br />I purchased it for my friend she is only 112 lbs and she's fit / toned she wears a XS or small in everything.<br />She loved how cute this looked and was so excited to get it and we read reviews<br />indicating that it ran small so we ordered her a Med<br />but it was super small and would not fit her at all. :(<br />It seriously is so skimpy and unless you weigh under 100 lbs and are very slim I don't think this will fit.
2.0,larger than I realized & not blue<br />they are a nice item
2.0,Mm<br />No me gustó la calidad<br />Podría mejorar
2.0,"I have one pair of Faith Skinny jeans.  I really like the jeans and wanted another pair, twice I have tried to order Faith Skinny jeans and twice Divine Skinny jeans were sent!  I ordered size 8 because Faith runs a tad big.  They are my favorite jeans and are so comfortable.  (If only I could get them.).  I do not want Divine Skinny.  They are not made the same at all.  Good luck getting the jeans you order."
2.0,I likes the finish but it is huge.  Not a very tight fit and doesn't hold its spring.  I would stick with a good quality metal or stainless.
2.0,"I was super excited to get this jumpsuit, looked on pic exactly what I wanted. As per size fit, I purchased xl, and xxl. My regular fit is L. XXL fit perfect everywhere, BUT crouch ._.<br />Look at the pic. If you have boby like mine (I am 5.7” regular build. Then this is not for you. I wish it could be loose on that area. I had to change quickly to another dress for the party, otherwise this could have been my favorite jumpsuit. SAD!"
2.0,"This watch was not compatible with my watch. I had a local jeweler, make one of the image of this one and it  turned out really nice."
2.0,I've already have had 6 destroyed gloves(unwearable) from the first box of the thousand I ordered. I will not be buying these again.
2.0,The earrings do not appear anything like those worn by the model. The three smaller stones are almost indistinguishable from the setting but in the picture they are brilliant and prominent.
2.0,Would be fine..except they came with a gouge already through the coating. Returning
2.0,"The chain was in a separate bag from the necklace.  Came out of the bag tied in a knot.  Nothing I did, including a magnifying glass and straight pin could get the knot out of the chain.  It is so incredibly FLIMSY and thin, there's no way my 80-year old mother in law could deal with that, even if the chain could be untangled, which it can not anyway.  Too close to Christmas, I have had to take one of my own sterling silver chains of a more decent weight to put the pendant on to make it acceptable.  The pendant itself is pretty.  Not nearly as vibrant in the colors as the photo here, but it's not bad, and it's about the size I expected it to be."
2.0,"I wore mine as a bracelet, and it was great for 2 days. Then the third day, I was rearranging the beads and I guess I popped something because they became loose. I took them off, made a knot to tighten them, and that worked for about another 4 or 5 days then it loosened up again on their own, I didnt touch anything. These beads are beauties but maybe they're to delicate for me and my lifestyle.  I'm on lookout for something new, I really wanted to have these and wear them forever."
2.0,"This is a bit oddly sized. The sleeves are borderline too short, and the sweater itself sits almost above my waist. I like to have length in the torso and good coverage, this doesn't provide. The feel and look of the sweatshirt are great, but the size and shape of it DO NOT work. I am 5'4"" and about 135# ordered a M"
2.0,these are very small (much smaller than other sweatbands made by other companies); do not absorb much sweat. Only get if you want a smaller band.
2.0,I can't close it all the way. The material is too strong.
2.0,Very nice...but way smaller than other clothing of this same size.
2.0,Loved the print but this dress was very uncomfortable. Strange non-stretchy slip part and little arm bands were super tight! The stiffness of slip thing made the outer layers fall awkwardly. Super unflattering and returned. Would love a softer more comfortable version with stretch for flexibility!
2.0,"Ive had size 00 ears for 20 years. I wear my regular 00 earrings daily. I could NOT FIT THESE IN MY EAR. I tried in the shower when everything is soapy and slippers and skin is warm and stretches easier...i tried lotion, i tried a little baby oil...nothing. The flare is too big and i was terrified to blow my ear out so i didnt attempt it any further.  Be aware when purchasing."
2.0,Changed color after wearing it a couple weeks.
2.0,Not true to size and it is cheaply made. Not layered as it appears in the picture.
2.0,It is an awesome design but runs at least one size smaller.
2.0,The most unflattering item I have ever bought on Amazon. I threw it out.
2.0,I like it but it was not the same color that they show in the picture
2.0,"Decent looking shirt, although not as cute in person, and the quality seems okay so far. I'm 5'4&#34;, 110 lbs, and wear a size small in pretty much everything. I ordered this in a size small but it is gigantic on me and fits more like a really big medium. It is not very flattering. It's fine for wearing around the house, but that's about it. There are no care instructions on the tag so I put it in the dryer anyway to see if it would shrink to make a better fit, but it did not (although, I suppose it is a good thing that it does not shrink). Overall, I'm pretty disappointed."
2.0,Zipper is cheap
2.0,"I'm 5 5, 120 lbs- ordered a small, it was too big maybe because my torso isn't that long. The material was nice, it's a bit more pink in person."
2.0,I would not recommend buying these costumes. They’re cheaply made from China. They’re extremely thin material. I bought them for my Nieces and instantly regret that. I sent them back.
2.0,The chain broke the first time it was used.
2.0,Don’t really like it cus in the pic looks nice but when I got it. It was broken can’t close it when you wear them
2.0,Ordered a small for a men''s 7/8 size and they run small on length but fit wide on width.
2.0,The watch repair too kit came with no directions and a bent pint on the pin removal device.  Sending this item back.
2.0,"These might be just a good ""stretchy"" material panties but they have nothing to do with actual after c-section support. There is no support at all. Just high waisted panties which are not helpful at all after surgery."
2.0,Not real fox quality. Very cheap. Thin. And lots of manufacturing defects. Also did not revive the color I selected. Don’t sell it if you don’t have it.  Same product offered from China on a wholesale site!  I don’t recommend.
2.0,"Cheap, thin material. If I'm going to wear my daily ID badge with my the logo of my Alma Mater, I'm willing to spend the money on top quality."
2.0,The packaging and the presentation were great. The gloves look good; they allow you enter information without having to remove them; but they do not offer enough protection against the cold.<br />They should make the gloves with a heavier material.
2.0,"Cute, but definitely not true to size. Waaay too small for the size ordered. I gave it to a child."
2.0,These were very small I ordered a woman’s XL and were too small for my mom who is a woman’s Small
2.0,The color of the logo is not what it’s advertised as<br />  I actually purchased it for the black and white logo<br />I got orange and green<br />Ewww
2.0,Looks nice but was uncomfortable and scratchy.
2.0,I was expecting a better quality stone!! I purchased the Indian Agate and I’m not even sure that it’s real. The stone itself looks nothing like anyone of the stones in the ad photos & looks like a composite of plastics & colored  dyes poured into a mold to get the shape of the “stone”. The cord feels like rubber and easy to break. Overall unsatisfied with the quality and my purchase!
2.0,"They are absolutely adorable. But, make sure you order larger size. Normally my little one wears a 2. The 2 wasn't available. I ordered a 4 just because she wanted them so bad. They fit perfectly!! Size 2 or 3 would've been too small."
2.0,"This necklace did not work for me.  The design is nice but it is just too heavy.  Sadly, I had to return it."
2.0,They are pretty.  But too small.  A child would fit this<br /><br />Way over priced
2.0,Too much side boob exposure. I had to move two of the straps.
2.0,"Bought a xxl, extremely small, not cotton t shirt material.  Maybe big enough for my kids to wear"
2.0,I am a small adult woman with skinny legs and these provide no support.
2.0,They are nice quality but I received 4 of the same pairs and one pair that I'll actually wear. Like I said I like the quality but won't waste my money again. Which is a shame because I liked the one pair.
2.0,"Received as a Christmas gift to use in aviation. Unable to use the stopwatch or the Tachymeter functions as the second hand does not stop and does not reset.  The world clock feature is nice and reasonably easy to use but a little difficult to read. I like the window for date, being able to see the previous date helps in low light to clarify the current date. Very disappointed in the second hand not working and will likely return. Also, the manual is not usable and there is no support contact available."
2.0,"The light pink looks nothing like the photo, you can not tell it is pink? It so pale. Disappointed🥴"
2.0,"Not as expected, assumed they were regular Hipster fit and silky feeling. These were stretch to fit pull on's. Not your standard shinny style 100% nylon like other women's panties."
2.0,"I bought these specifically for running and I didn't even have to try them on to realize they aren't going to work. Right away when taking them out of the package I was like ""yeah no, not gonna do it, not even close"". They are much thicker and heavier than I thought. They don't even feel like a polyester blend, they feel like cotton to me and the waist band is wide and thick. I'm a serious runner and there's no way I could go a few miles in these. I don't even like them for working out or other sports, they are just too thick and heavy. I mean it feels like a quality product but not really for exercising which seems to be what they are marketed for. I could see some good yardwork getting done in these if that's what you wanted, otherwise I'd buy some real dry-fit active wear."
2.0,Too Small.  Not proportionally correct through bust.  Darts for breasts too low.  Not enough in seams to alter.  Cute design!  Wish it fit!  How do I return?
2.0,"I am tall and this dress did not fit right.  It is too big in the top.  And I am chesty.  In order to get the chest in the right place, I had to pull the halter straps tightly then the waist band was under my bust."
2.0,Sizing is all wrong....
2.0,The earrings that I have received look nothing like the image provided.
2.0,"Here is an example of having higher expectations for something than one should.  First of all, the fabric is NO WHERE close to cotton.  It's purely polyester. Second of all, the top of the garment is tight and the bottom of the garment is perfect.  The fabric is somewhat stretchy, but not stretchy enough to make a bit of difference.  I really wanted this dress to be like it has been indicated..but alas it is not.  I'll be returning this item."
2.0,Unfortunately for me the skirt was way to tight around the waist I usually wear a large in skirts and after reading the reviews I order the 2 x because I was told they ran small how ever I didn't think they would run that small so the item was sent back .I don't think it would of been a problem is the waistband  would of been elastic but unfortunately for me it wasn't . The skirt itself is quite beautiful and I give that a 5 star rating .
2.0,"Very small, don't fit like the photo. The sleeve is very, very short"
2.0,"I liked the look of this dress, but it is weird. I bought a small and it seemed very big. The sleeves had a lot of room. It's very low-cut. I had my mom sew it a bit so it wouldn't show my whole chest. It's just big width wise. It didn't look good with a belt to bring it in a bit. It's definitely shorter than I thought, which wasn't that bad and has a hi-low style. I kept it too long to return, so I ended up giving it to Goodwill. I just couldn't get it to look good."
2.0,Chipped and turned my finger green after two weeks.
2.0,"These slip back within minutes. I've had to use bobby pins to keep them in place, which is working, but just frustrating that it is necessary."
2.0,"Wristlet is adorable and holds all items intended when I purchased it:  2 iPhones (work & personal), lipstick, credit cards, compact.  Does not look or feel cheap.  I give it 2 stars as the zipper is already giving me problems, and I anticipate will break very shortly.  But, we will see.  Cheap enough that if it goes, no big deal."
2.0,"Just as another reviewer said, the red band on the sleeve of the white sweater, bleeds into the white part. One dry cleaner was able to mostly fix it. That means every time I need to get it clean, I have to pay instead of washing it myself.<br />It is a mid weight sweater and form fitting.<br />I think all sweaters of Patty B run small. I am 5'4"" and weigh 114 lbs. I take a medium, and still tight. The large is too big in the shoulders."
2.0,"Runs small,.way smaller than average."
2.0,"Purchased the ""sapphire blue"" which in 99 out of 100 times is comparable to royal blue--- this was PURPLE! a royal purple for sure! had to return- returning was ok but still disappointed in the poor description"
2.0,The ear paddings ended up slipping off because they were not secured on the glasses frame arm. The lenses themselves were nice. But the frame quality was terrible.
2.0,I loved the look. And feel of the material. However this was at least 2 sizes smaller than I ordered. So I am going to reorder larger size.
2.0,Very uncomfortable on shoulders. Straps too thick and too tight. Want to return it
2.0,The advertisement for these earrings are nicer than the product delivered.
2.0,"Let me start off by saying this is my experience and that everyone's experience may be different depending on their eyesight. I've always had good eyesight and never needed glasses or contacts lenses. However, recently I've been having difficulty with night driving, particularly with excessive light glare and haloing. I'lll give them this, the glasses do help cut back on light glare - more impressively with the newer LED lights. They also helped signs and markers in the distance become more focused. The frames are very classy looking as well. I really want to like these glasses. Unfortunately, and the reason I give them 2 stars, they create a triple vision on nearer objects. When at a stop light, the light and tail lights of the car in front of me have a double (triple) vision effect. Just beneath and slightly to the right and slightly to the left of the main near lighted object will be it's double and triple image. It's almost like a fractal. I don't know if this is a lense issue or an eyesight issue, but it is distracting and for that reason I find it safer to drive without them. Got them on sale for $20 with a $10 coupon, but I'll probably be returning them. Quality frames and great packaging though. I hope others have a better experience with these or their other glasses."
2.0,After washing it the ends roll and needs ironing.
2.0,El colorme encanto.la tela es muy simple pero queda lindo puesto
2.0,"Arm length is definitely too short, very comfortable and soft fabric with a cute design."
2.0,Cute plaid shirt but the sleeves do not reach my wrist so I had to returned it.
2.0,Got a different wallet in mail. Had to send it back.
2.0,Did not pass emissions.  Used three bottles
2.0,It was too small I wish they would have put in the caption that it fits like lingerie.
2.0,"Obviously it's a piece of crap, you get what you pay for but it does look nice as long as your not too close. Also the little bands that keep the extra length of the strap down pulled right off."
2.0,The cape is a very pretty pink but the quality is poor. I bought another brand cape for a few dollars less that was a much nicer quality.
2.0,there were stains on the dress the moment i opened the dress i saw the dress had spots. neckline was off and the slit of the dress was higher up than pictured
2.0,Too small compared to other brands.
2.0,The shoes run big and are too wide for my daughter's feet so I returned them.
2.0,"Too small to wear, otherwise a good buy for the price. Go a size or two bigger than chart."
2.0,Bracelet broke after 2 wears. Very disappointed.
2.0,I absolutely loved this necklace. It broke after wearing it for the second time. I’m disappointed it didn’t last longer.
2.0,"Product was supposed to be squat proof and comfortable, instead it was too big in areas that it shouldnt be, definitely not squat proof and super thin material, does not hold you all together."
2.0,"I liked the looks of these earrings, but the first time I wore them I noticed that one of the earrings was loose at the back; I'm afraid to wear them now."
2.0,Dropped it broke immediately
2.0,I ordered these for my son an he loved them but after the first day of wearing them his feet were the dirtiest I ever seen. I even tried wiping them down but the same thing kept happening. The strap broke on them also. They are very cheap.
2.0,It's low quality all around. It's a good house dress and that's about it.
2.0,The mask looks good but would not stay on my ears no matter how much I adjust it. Wasted my money and it's over priced.
2.0,too gaudy
2.0,The shirt was pretty but it was short extremely short more like a crop top.
2.0,"I have had several watches that are automatic so here are my pros/cons of this particular one:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-automatic, no battery needed<br />-priced cheap<br />-has a day of month count that other watches might not<br />-time seems accurate as long as you stay active throughout the day<br /><br />Cons:<br />- stops working sooner than past automatic watches, will be dead by next morning if you take it off<br />- no instructions with watch<br />- I have not been able to figure out how to set the day of month counter without having to wind minute hand 24hr increments to get the day I want, this is very cumbersome poorly designed<br />- band feels very cheap and I even bent some links when removing them<br /><br />Overall, I guess you get what you pay for.  It works reliably when wearing it but setting the day is a real headache"
2.0,"Not as expected. The colors appear muted in the picture but in reality, the pink stripe is bubble gum pink & the blue is bright baby blue. The colors just dont flow together. Also it runs very large. I usually wear XS/S in tops & got small (smallest option available) & its huge. Had to return it."
2.0,"The beg is lovely, but hard to get into due to the small top opening. there is no outside pocket for cell phones ,keys, etc. I used it for a week and found it too hard to use and switched bags."
2.0,Most of them broke just screwing them together
2.0,"These took forever to get here. Almost a month. The first one clicked in about 5 minutes and looks wicked. The second one, however, hasn't clicked yet. Been on it for 3 days now... Just gonna use it without the bead most likely."
2.0,"The shelf bra was too small, and the tank top itself was way too long (could practically wear it as a tube dress). For the price I didn't expect good quality, but the design is off based upon standard tank top proportions. Would not recommend buing."
2.0,brim would not reshape; very unflattering
2.0,Not as pretty as pictured. Looks cheap and image looks blurry
2.0,"It is a cute outfit. However the proportion is way off! My daughter is the 5 percentile for height and 85 percentile in weight so I thought this would be great for her.  NO!  The legs are even too short for her.  For reference, she is 30 inches tall and about 27 lbs.  The neck area is too big, but it pulls in the crotch area.  I really wanted to like this.  Its not worth sending it back.  However, I won't be able to use it for Christmas pictures like I planned."
2.0,material much to thin not as i expected when reading description not good for standing and walking on concrete floor
2.0,"The fabric is poor quality. After 2 washes it looks completely worn out and messy with little white balls of fabric all over it. The sizing was fine. My daughter is about 4'10 and 80lbs and got the small, it's lose and comfortable but fits fine. I wouldn't recommend, it looks really bad after washing."
2.0,"The white part of the top is muuuuch thicker than the pic. Therefore it looks like some wierd underware.  And the 'tummy control', NOT AT ALL. It's very tin and loose."
2.0,Product is not warm enouth and the fleece is bad quality. It is not a jacket for cold weather.
2.0,This will only fit you if you have a cup size A or B. I ordered an XL hoping it would fit my 32DD no such luck. XL would still only fit a 38-42 A or B cup.
2.0,"Review from my wife. This fits way smaller than expected. Granite, it is China sizes, but the size chart is not correct. In american sizes, I am a 12. I had to order a 3x and it is still too short and snug in the chest area."
2.0,Dislike... look better online and larger will be returning
2.0,Quality was inconsistent
2.0,Way to small ordered a 1xl which is a perfect size usually
2.0,To tight and to short. I gave it away.
2.0,My son loved the design but they ran small. Used them for a two day trip to the water park and the insides and toe areas did not hold up. Will need to get new ones to use for the rest of the summer but not this brand.
2.0,The pendant that I received doesn't boast the same craftsmanship as the one pictured here. The paint used in the feathers bleeds out over the gold and makes the pendant look rather cheap which it wasn't at the price of $35.00... I was excited as all the other reviews are very positive but the reality is that this pendant is definitely not worth the price listed :/
2.0,They fall off so easy 😭
2.0,"When the item arrived the small pieces of ""jewel"" first the crown were mostly broken off."
2.0,"Pretty leather. It smells great. The ribbon ripped out of the satchel on the first use.  It is tack glued on the inside behind a this scrap of leather. The wallet will last forever, the cheap mechanism, weeks at best."
2.0,Not as long as I'd hoped and you have to force the top to be off the shoulder. It just doesn't hang as nicely as what's pictured.
2.0,Bought these gloves to keep my hands from freezing on a cold shifter knob.  They were great until the first snow.  Brushed a little snow off the door so it wouldn't fall into the car when I opened the door and the glove must have gotten a little snow on it.  Next thing I know the index finger has shrunk to about half of its original size and the entire Palm of the glove is hard as a rock.
2.0,"Okay so I bought the 2xl for my husband, wow it could fit me and I wear a Large.  I love the texture of the shirts but as far as the fit, it is way to small for him.  I don't think it came from China but it fit like it did.  If it was for a woman then I would give it 4 stars but nope.  I will just wear it if it fits me, if not the kids are getting them."
2.0,got it to wide
2.0,Would have been nice to know only size was a small
2.0,"Did not look like the picture. Cheap material and plain white buttons, threads were hanging everywhere. Light baby pink not the mauve pink I was expecting. I would pay $5-$10 for this at most."
2.0,"A tad small, cant wear with long sleeves. Disappointed, but not enough to return it. I'll just have to wear with short sleeves."
2.0,"I'm so disappointed! I was so excited to buy these because I have a bad left thumb/wrist and putting on regular sports bras a very hard for me to reach around and pull on but as these are easier to put on, the zipper on each and everyone comes down and WILL NOT stay zipped. The colors are beautiful and they come in a nice bag but that's the only positive thing I can say about these bras. I'd return them but I currently don't have a working printer to print a return label. No the best fitting bras."
2.0,It's very short. in order to show any cleavage at all you have to pull down the shirt otherwise the mesh &#34;v&#34; hits way above the bust. I asked to return and immediately they said you keep the product and we'll give you 30% return. Don't bother.
2.0,Feel very light and kind of cheap- pretty color though
2.0,"Item is poorly made, looks good but is not durable, stripped within a couple months less than 6 of being worn every other week"
2.0,"Didnt like it at all. Material is cheap. I'm a small, it runs big and is boxy, not flowy like in the picture.<br />I am returning it."
2.0,I'm giving her two stars because it fell apart several times I've had to glue it. After I've glued it it's holding together. Poor quality.
2.0,"I guess I can't complain because of the price, but in my opinion, I will not be purchasing another. I purchased a similar one from Amazon...and it was much better quality! This was just ok...not a fan of the material or the sewing quality."
2.0,This suit fits super weird. I have a long torso and it was still too long for me by like 4 inches. I'm not sure what body type would even be able to wear it.
2.0,Returned. Did NOTHING for my plus sized figure. Lol
2.0,"I bought this because of the bad reviews saying the straps are too short ( I need short straps!). The straps were ok but my boobs fell right out of the cups and into the band ( and I don't even have that much sag!) . I wouldn't buy this unless you have really small, athletic breasts.<br /><br />I will say that the customer service is EXCELLENT and they went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied!! Will definitely do business with intimate portal again!"
2.0,One size smaller
2.0,The backs don't stay on and the earrings keep falling out of my ears.
2.0,the material is cheap.
2.0,The day of the week dial does not work. Didnt even bother sending it back. Disappointing.
2.0,You might want to order one size larger than the chart says because it runs small. Otherwise it's very pretty. It was only about eight or nine dollars so I didn't send it back. Just hope I lose about 7 lb so I can enjoy it.
2.0,"The size chart isn't close to being useful. I followed  the chest dimensions when ordering (as instructed), but the fit was loose.<br />Returned and refunded...will try another vendor with U.S. sizes..."
2.0,not like at all looks cheapest rings when you receving and too small size too small!
2.0,"It was too high-waisted for my frame and this made it very short on me.  I'm 5'8&#34; tall, so if you're<br />above average in height, you may want to shy away from this dress.  It would look great on<br />a shorter person."
2.0,"I bought these to lounge around the house in hot weather. I WILL NEVER WEAR THESE IN PUBLIC. I am 5'7"" 135 lbs and carry my weight in my middle section so my legs/butt are on the skinny side. (I am embarrassed by the pic, but I thought it will help illustrate how these look.)<br /><br />Pros:<br />• Thick, sturdy material (good if you want them to last, but may be too hot if using for actual work-outs)<br />• NO panty lines visible (yay)<br />• Good length<br />• Tummy control is fine, but it's not going to actually hold your tummy in.<br /><br />Cons:<br />• Weird construction causes camel-toe. Lot's of seams all over the place. I'm no supermodel, but my other bike shorts don't do this.<br />• Inside seam is shorter than outside so it looks like its riding up on the inside<br />• Pockets sort of 'pull' - may be what causes the camel-toe<br />• Pockets are rather worthless/pointless now that I think about it. A phone would tug down and then you'd really have a weird tug-of-war going on.<br />• RECOMMEND SIZING UP. I bought Large. Medium, which is what I normally wear when made in U.S., would have been skin tight and probably too difficult to pull on.<br /><br />As shorts to wear around the house, they are fine but, as mentioned, I would not wear these in public!"
2.0,They're nice shoes but make my feet look 3 times smaller than they really are ....I'm a nice 9 they fit perfectly. But just not for me
2.0,"The socks I received are not as pictured. They are similar and I’m ok with them, but what I received is not what is pictured. It’s not worth the hassle of returning them. It is a thinner sock which I like for specific shoes. Ex: they will slide easily into a tight boot, but if you are looking for something super warm, thick and cozy for winter this is not it."
2.0,Beautiful design but too short - I am 5'5&#34;  and 108 lbs - always wear a small - but a size small in this suit is too short and tight. AND the company does not allow returns.
2.0,"Bad fit, mask size runs bigger and covers part of your eyes!!!"
2.0,wsored them three times they fell apart
2.0,Did not like the way they fit. They were boxy and Un tapered. I did not feel femine.
2.0,"These were fun, and would be great for a costume or themed outfit, but not really realistic as sunglasses to wear for the purpose of eye protection."
2.0,not what I expected!!!
2.0,"These were VERY low quality, even for China. Only about half of the lights worked, some fell apart as soon as kids put them on. Would never buy again."
2.0,"Looks nice, quality seems okish but chrono hands will not reset to zero..  sending back"
2.0,I ordered a small.  This dress comes down to my ankles.  Not at all what it looks like in the photo.  Super frumpy.
2.0,Very fancy packaging leads you to look forward to a great purchase but as soon as you handle the actual glasses you realize that there is more money in the presentation than there is in the actual product. You can put lipstick on a pig and that's exactly what this company does. These glasses are worth about $1
2.0,"I do think you do need to order up. The outfit was not exactly true to size. I could wear it, but it was not comfortable. Also, I didn’t really like their material."
2.0,Workship does not quite match picture
2.0,"I wear a size 5.5-6, so I purchased the 5-6 size pair. It definitely has gotten way too big and seems to be expanding. I've only been wearing it for 2 months, and now it's too loose around my feet. See pics."
2.0,"I was really sad that this outfit was not more flattering. I ordered 3 rompers and kept the other 2 but returned this one. I really thought it would be great with the pockets and back detail, but the waistline was just odd. The outfit seemed to be made well enough, it just was not flattering once I got it on."
2.0,This romper is really cute and comfortable however it is definitely made for short girls with smaller chests. I’m 5 foot 5 inches with a D size chest and this romper was not long enough at all. The top part barley covers and it gives a very  unflattering look in the lower front.the pant kegs were also above my ankle and looked I’d like I shrunk my outfit in the dryer! i wish this fit better.
2.0,"Returning. This sweater was VERY long. I am 5'6&#34; and the back of the sweater went down to the middle of calves. I guess if you're looking for a long sweater, this would be good. I was hoping it would end mid-thigh."
2.0,Wrinkles very easy ! By the middle of my event I was a wrinkly mess !
2.0,Very pretty.  Don’t fight against headaches at all.
2.0,It couldn't be any cheaper.
2.0,I ordered a size larger than I normally wear and these are still too small.  They are shorter than usual and fitted.  I would order up at least 2 sizes.  Other than that they are of goo quality.
2.0,"Bought this shirt in August, didnt start wearing until winter and its splitting at the seam. Liked the shirt, but not if it only last a couple of months."
2.0,"Good bag until it wasn't. Lasted ~3 months before it started to give out. The first was the top load zipper and then the compartment seams. I utilized it for a set of turnouts, SCBA mask, wildland coat, structure, and wildland helmet. I thought that what it was built for... Wish it was double stitched and the material was thicker... Looks good when new though lol"
2.0,A large shirt was small on my average size 9 year old. Sleeves are short. Order one size larger then needed.
2.0,"Cheaply made, not particularly warm, seems incredibly flimsy."
2.0,I ordered an XL based off the size chart and it fit like a M. Not made for big boobs
2.0,Difficult to put on.  Bracelet is huge in diameter which you have to figure out how to wrap it around your wrist to make it look as advertised.
2.0,"These broke after 2 weeks there horrible, The glass inside it kept getting off and I tried reusing it  without the glass and it just wasn’t the same,but I admit it’s cute it just needs to be more fixed"
2.0,"Sweater was good and looked tough but zipper is a piece of crap, when I messaged seller about fixing it (I'd pay for shipping and all) they just said they dnt do alterations."
2.0,"Phones didn't fit over ears properly, no spaced properly."
2.0,The locket doesn’t stay closed very well and I lost all my charms by the time I noticed and some where Origami owl charms that I cannot find to replace. Better is the locket where a twist to close instead of magnetic
2.0,"The Pom poms were very small and smashed, and did not sit center on the head."
2.0,"I ordered it using the size chart and it is way too large. Use the hip measurement, not the waist measurement. Must return because they are so large they will add bulk under ski pants"
2.0,Bought for my niece for her swim class she loved it BUT two weeks in and not washing it heavily the seams came out on both sides!!?! She’s nine and not heavy set so it’s little big on her… had to get the sewing machine out and fit it she took some Sewing classes too so she enjoyed it but bottom line it’s not worth what I pay for it.
2.0,These turned color very quickly. I know they were cheap and I got what I paid for.
2.0,"Nice jacket, indeed very packable. I ordered an extra large. I usually wear a med or a large but I wanted extra room for layering comfortably. Forget it. I could barely get my arms in.  It give it 2 stars for the quality  and design."
2.0,Def woman’s cut and a lot shorter than in picture. Also seems shorter!
2.0,"Didn’t fit anything like the photo and if you want it to be a little more “flowy” like the photo you may consider ordering two sizes up. The straps over the shoulder jut in towards your neck/chest, almost like it wants to be a halter top but it’s not... hard to explain. The color is beautiful tho, and the material is soft ."
2.0,Really really cheap looking- I have gotten better looking things at the dollar store. They do come quick though!
2.0,"Very cute shoe when on my son's feet but the shoe is too narrow. His toes get smashed together uncomfortably and the Velcro doesn't stay together. He can't wear them, which is a shame since it looks great with all kinds of outfits."
2.0,The buttons are too small for the button holes and will not stay closed. The top is not too small for me so that is not the problem.
2.0,"We bought 3 of them over a 2 year period. Every one of them the wire broke off almost immediately. Great idea.... in theory. We would support buying a few more if the company could fix this HUGE issue. They were used by responsible careful adults, not kids, just to add further info. Weren't abused or thrown about."
2.0,Too small and the snaps didn't  work
2.0,"just got this piece and really didn't like it at all, quality is very poor. couple of pieces are broken. don't know if that is manufacture's problem or shipping handling. so overall not satisfied and upset about amazon's quality control. I would not recommend this piece to anyone."
2.0,the drone was defective one motor would not start until propeller flipped  returned it.
2.0,I tried 4 pairs at same time. This I liked the least. I did not like the way they moved when I lifted my leg to simulate hiking up steep rocks. Or how they pulled down when doing deep knee bends. The articulated knee area seemed to bend more near my shin and there was a lot of movement throughout the entire pant so an immediate return for me. My size is a 36w×32length. And they only seemed a little tight in the thigh. Plenty waist and length. I do have longer shins and larger thighs than average.
2.0,Was so beautiful but broke 2 months after I purchased.
2.0,"Highly frustrated and upset. I ordered both the black (size 6), and the red (size 8). I had to order in 2 different sizes do to availability, yet from the same company. Upon arrival i tried both on. The red 8 fit like a glove, the black 6 fit...not small, not like a glove, but yes BIG and not just big but baggy big. I do not know how something like this is even possible. Now i am out my black skirt as they are unavailable. That and i am afraid to order as CLEARLY quality control is at an all time low. The only reason i am rating 2 stars is due to thus far a quick return. Would have been a 5 had the sizes been accurate."
2.0,This bracelet broke with in 2 days of wearing it.
2.0,Bought two of these and both broke within a month or two. Not a fan.
2.0,The print is blurry and ugly in person. The shirt is smaller then expected and very see through. The sleeves are too short and the neck plunge is deep and falls awkwardly.  I waited over a month for shipment and am throughly disappointed in the product.
2.0,Everything is holding up well. But with in the first 2 weeks one of the cup holders ripped.
2.0,"This bra looks really great, but is is definitely not for plus sized persons. The straps need to be thicker in order to hold the cups up more securely, and the back strap should not be so thin either. I am a 42 I and got a 4X which fit-ish around the band of the bra, but the cups runneth over, if you get what I mean. The straps kept falling down and it almost felt like I was wearing an ill-fitting strapless bra."
2.0,"Broke after owning only a couple of months. The frame over the ear breaks because it’s thin plastic. Take the glasses off with both hands to minimize, but I’ve had dollar store sunglasses last longer than these."
2.0,"The description for these gloves made them sound like they would keep my hands plenty warm in cold temperatures, but they didn't come close.  I wore them in 30 degree temperatures and got cold fingers.  They're also rather bulky and do not provide much dexterity.<br />Another disappointing pair of winter gloves I've tried"
2.0,"It looks really small, i purchased 8.5 to 9.0 mm, and i think you might have shipped 7.0 mm.  I need to it get checked at the local jewelry store i suppose"
2.0,It was advertised as denim. It is not denim
2.0,I'm so upset because I really love this set. The men's is fine but the woman's is already worn and barely seen anymore. It should have been black with silver writing with pink gem like the men's. Or the rose gold with BLACK WRITING so you can still see it.... I hope I get a refund or replacement.
2.0,Way closer fit then I thought it would be. Also I didn't care for the material.
2.0,I really wanted this bra to work. However my usual size band was super tight while the bra cups really gapped out at the sides. A big disappointment. Too big and too small.
2.0,You will get about 2 or 3 uses out of each. Very thin in width and clasp release easily. Great for temporary use. That's about it.
2.0,"The top is too small, I'm 5'9 and it's like a mid drift top for me."
2.0,"It sits very high on the neck, so you either wear it with a low cut top or with a high neck one. Doesn’t quite hit the right length.  Quality is good"
2.0,"The earrings were long enough , they were cut too short to fit whole ear. No I have average ears.. lol Loved the designs but manufacturers measurements were off!"
2.0,Cheap take two pieces of cardboard and cover them up with pink whatever and charge 30+$ for it.
2.0,"The rings look beautiful. After wearing the whole set for only one week, two of the midi-rings snapped, and a stone fell out of one of them. Poor quality product which presented itself as beautiful to begin with, but quickly revealed itself to be cheap."
2.0,This product size is way off... I'm a 36D and it was way to small and couldn't hold the weight of my chest. I'll stick to taping my chest if I need to go backless.
2.0,"Construction is fine, but it looks like a beetle.  If it weren't for the title I'd never know what it was supposed to be.  For this reason I decided to return it because gifts shouldn't require explainations."
2.0,It's nice I just don't know how to apply it.
2.0,Do not like how it hangs halfway to my knees
2.0,"I love the look of this band! I was excited to wear it, but the first time, a screw fell out, meaning the whole band and all the tiny pieces fell to the floor! It was a miracle that my dad found was able to find everything.  I took it home and put it back together - VERY TEDIOUS!! I wore the watch to work the next day, and it fell apart again! I assumed the first time might have been my fault, because I didn't check the screws before wearing it. But the second time I made sure every screw was tight, and tested it by pulling gently on the band. The fact that it fell apart again is rediculous. I'm going to try one more time, then I might have to return / count my losses. Maybe there's a reason to buy products from Apple, and not third-parties."
2.0,"Watch face clouded up everyday that I wore it first week.  Left it for 3 days while it cleared.  First day l put it back on, it fogged up again- again, without exposure to water. Hands are not luminescent."
2.0,I disliked the material weight and the quality is horrible.  These were a Christmas present for my son.  The description for this product should say it's  a Summer weight material as the pants are too thin to be worn in the Winter months
2.0,"The concept of this is great. The execution could be better. One of my clips has already broken off. Also, they are not strong enough and shift easily, making the door hard to shut. The other day, for no reason at all, one of them just slid right off of the door. Still have no idea how that happened. I think metal clips would be better for this."
2.0,"The top is okay, but the shorts are poor quality. They are not a soft or comfortable material and the fit is small. Spend a bit more for a better set."
2.0,"Really wanted to like these pants but: 1. First order fitted way too small. Usually wear a 38-40 inch waist and had to return 4xl for 5xl. They have at least 2 sizing charts that don't really translate well.  2. Draw string on first pair was pulled back into pants when received. Spent 15 minutes getting it out. Draw strings are several inches too short to easily tie. Also, drawstring material lets knot relax like that pair of sneakers that just won't stay tied. Better count on wearing a belt with these. 3. After receiving the 2nd pair, threads in one of the pockets unraveled after just the second wash.<br />Really like the design and light weight of the product. Just lost something in the production. At $25-$30 you should expect better quality."
2.0,Nice piece; but tooth fall off only a week after I got it. Not recommended.
2.0,"Love the fabric, price and design but I wish it fit.  It is WAY too small even tho I bought 2 sizes larger than I normally wear due to posts by others who purchased it."
2.0,I ordered an xtra large and it fit like a medium.
2.0,"The CZ itself is nice but I have only used it once. I have a sensitive skin and the earring from the front to the back it a thicker in an angle to the ear. I wish I see that in the picture. Matching with the small lock. It kind of dig in my skin, it make sit hard to wear all day.<br />I like it better if the earring had a thinner metal. I am keeping it to give it to a family<br /> It might work for others but not for me."
2.0,I wear a 14 usually order xl I ordered 2xl and its to tight in the waist.
2.0,Its not solid leather and looked ratty after 3 months
2.0,"It is advertised as fitting 4-12 year olds.  My boy is above average size for being a 4 1/2 year old, so I ordered the small.  It is not just a little Large, it is stupid large.  Very disappointed in this.  A full grown petite woman could fit in this."
2.0,"Very tight, recommend ordering about 2 sizes up from your usual."
2.0,No belt was with this????
2.0,Top was way short won't wear it
2.0,Doesn't hold up well
2.0,If you are a petite plus size diva and you want to use these as capri leggings this will not work for you.  I wear a 22/24 and these fit like regular stretch pants all the way to my ankle and I'm 5'2 1/2.  First of all I thought they were your normal capri fabric leggings: WRONG!  They are more like stocking leggings.  If it says it on the details sections my honest mistake but they are more like stockings than leggings.  Good to wear under dresses and stuff.  But because its summer I won't wear them.  They were a bit snug but hey its under a dress.  I do have to say the shipping was quick and I appreciated that for sure.  Just a bit disappointed with the quality and length of the leggings.
2.0,"Love the style,color and light weight of the sweater, however the dark pattern down the back is way offset from the middle as it shows in the picture. Looks crooked😢"
2.0,I. Couldn’t get the zipper all the way up
2.0,This product size says medium but it looks huge. It's supposed to be a 4t
2.0,Very sad at the fact that this doesn't fit my ear at all... Had to eat the cost of this :-(
2.0,"They work great for me, really helped my lower leg pain.  I would say they are a bit expensive at 10 skins a pair but I can't find them any cheaper anyplace else.  Also, they are definitely not easy on and off.  On the other hand I can wear them all day long and well into the evening and they really helped me."
2.0,"gave it to my daughter...couldn't keep it up on my waist, too big and kept sliding down!"
2.0,Too small for my face and doesn’t appear effective. Arrived on time.
2.0,Couldnt use thiis bra ..did not fit well.not enough lift and support.
2.0,"I bought these for my small 10 year old. He is very small for his age 4'3 and 58lb's. We ordered a size small and they were SO BIG on his waist and also too short. I thought we could fix the problem with a belt, but they just look funny because they are not long enough. If you have a smaller more slim child I would not recommend these baseball pants."
2.0,"Besides not being true to size, the glitter came off and spread everywhere. Just wasn't a good fit or look like the picture."
2.0,"These just pop in and are too easily opened.  Should have looked closer, because I thought these locked into the opposite end like another brand I recently purchased.<br /><br />You have to have these snug for them to work if pants are baggy, but then when I sit they often open."
2.0,cute but runs very small.
2.0,Does not look anything like the picture
2.0,Cute very cute but fits me to tight and to small. Bought this in my right size and it feels very uncomfortable.
2.0,"I am on the hunt for the perfect pair of underwear for playing pickleball that will suck my tummy in a little bit and won't ride up so I'm not constantly pulling them down over my butt cheeks.  I thought this might fit the bill but unfortunately, it didn't work for me.  Granted my bum could probably compare to Kim Kardashian's but I'm 55 and you won't catch me wearing a thong.  So back to the drawing board.  Other than that, they are comfortable and I can wear them with my compression workout pants but not for the purpose I wanted them."
2.0,"I got a large because that's the size I normally get... Not only is it larger than i expected, when I put it on my husband laughed at me. It literally looked like i was wearing a bed sheet that had a hole cut out of it. Maybe it would look better if i got a smaller size? Doubt it though bc it has no shape. Plan on returning it."
2.0,They arrived a little bent and are super small. Didn't want to deal with hassle of returning so im donating them. Meh quality.
2.0,The shirt does not look like the picture. It is not baggy at all. Cheap material but you get what you pay for.
2.0,"This lasted about 11 months.  However i'm buying the same one to replace it because i can't find anything that seems better.  The Swatch site has one for a few dollars more, with a warning that it only fits a certain model watch but no way to determine if my wife's watch is that model or not -- also it has poor reviews.  I would pay more for a quality band but since i can't find one, i will settle for this piece of **** which at least is cheap."
2.0,"I’ve bought “cheap” jewelry on Amazon before, but never before have I received it in such a poor condition. I gave this product 2 stars due to the condition of the product when it arrived. The little stand that pearls were pinned to was completely crushed. Most if not all the backings were bent or broken into 2 pieces. I was so happy that I bought a separate set of backings at the same time I ordered these earrings otherwise the pearl studs would have been useless to me. The pearl studs themsevles seem to be holding up. The only reason I didn’t return them was because I needed them for an event the day I received them. Definitely disappointed."
2.0,"I really didn't like this. Sizing was great, I'm always medium-large and a medium was plenty big enough but I hatedddd the swim suit material. Ive never worn this outside the house,"
2.0,i wear a 14 in pants so a xl in leggings always fit i ordered a 20/22 and they are way tooo small i would need 2 sizes up to fit properly. on top of being too small the only reason they got 2 stars was because the quality was righ. im not gonna pay for shipping just gonna try to give em away
2.0,This sweater is so thin I could put my fingers right through it in the picture it looks a lot thicker not good quality
2.0,"Way too short. I’m 5,4 and the pants were high water."
2.0,The ring is adjustable in tint which is not in tj description.  The metal is very thin and flimsy.  I returned it.
2.0,These fell apart very quickly. Not the best quality.
2.0,Turned my ears black...
2.0,There was something like glue on the inside lenses.i tried to wipe it off and the lenses got scratches all over it
2.0,I don't know.  I really didn't like it.
2.0,Was looking for a bra that would not retain moisture after a walk and still acted as a normal bra vs a sports bra.  I thought this might be it.  While it does have those properties.....I have washed it twice now and the straps squeak every time I move at the place where they join in the back at the back strap.
2.0,did not work never wore them gave them to my brother
2.0,Sub-quality stitching.
2.0,"These were a very cheap looking material.  I'm a woman with lots of curves who likes to cover up all the dimples and these didn't help.  It's a very thin material that showes all, and when stretched out makes it look even worse."
2.0,Cute style but way too small. The women’s size Large is more comparable to a child’s/girl’s size Large.
2.0,"There's clearly something wrong with the black rubber part that attaches the lanyard to your glasses. Two of five have already broken at the exact same place. And it's not like I haven't used lanyards for years, or abuse my glasses."
2.0,Did  not like that it was actually only 2 arm sleeves instead of 2 pair and also fit tight
2.0,Nice peace but sizing is just not real.
2.0,It's likely china made and sizes.  Very small.  I would likely get 2 sizes about your normal l
2.0,"Shirt is oddly wide, and image isn’t super clear"
2.0,These socks were too thick. The original socks were much thinner and not bulky.
2.0,metal piece holding chain broke first day! Sorry to have to give bad review but it's the truth!
2.0,"Es pequeño, parece más de mujer, no es de mi tamaño"
2.0,way too small and fabric leaves a lot to be desired
2.0,Awful material. Very uncomfortable. Return was easy.
2.0,The way it looks is cheep
2.0,"Similar colors, and quality is not good."
2.0,Terrible quality. Seams/edges are warped. Weird lumps at the side seams.
2.0,Dress is okay. What was I to expect for $10? Main issue/: it's nNOT pink; I got more of a purple almost brownish undertone and body of dress isn't ss full.
2.0,"I love my black hoodie so I ordered both the blue and grey ones-blue size large was like the black one, but the grey one is smaller especially in the arms and the elastic at the waist so you can't really wear it over anything. Disappointing."
2.0,The size doesn't match standard sizes at the American retail stores. Too small and I had to return.
2.0,It did not fit as expected. Way too small and zero support.
2.0,"Appeared used and washed...wrinkly, no shape.  The black one I received was perfect but, the white one wasn't."
2.0,dress looks beautiful online but material is poor quality  and does not look or flattering on..Returning it.
2.0,Isn’t long enough like the picture it fits like a crop top not really what I was looking for but still cute
2.0,My daughter bought this for her and her boyfriend for Christmas.  When he opened his and took it out of the package the whole front piece that lights up fell off.  My daughter was so sad and so embarrassed! I would not buy this product again.
2.0,"Fit small, binding seams, material is low quality and poorly stitches. Recommend Jo & Bette (6 Pack) Cotton Womens Thong Underwear Lace Trim Soft Sexy Lingerie Panties instead."
2.0,"There are not enough gripping nubs on the sole, so my daughter still ends up slipping and falling over."
2.0,I like the vest but I returned it because Above the top left pocket it has a logo on it that says (larger than life) the logo is about the size of A cell phone I wanted a plain vest not one with Someone advertising on it That is why I gave it two stars
2.0,"Gloves run small, I wear an XL and can barely move my fingers.  The cuffed area of the glove fits underneath my jacket allow cold air into the end of the jacket sleeve. Probably a good glove above 20 degree, but not effective below zero."
2.0,Material wasn't what I expected. Very itchy and top kept ridding up on shoulders and I don't have small shoulders
2.0,"It looked weird to me. I have big hip and thighs, probably not suitable for my body type."
2.0,Lining came apart 3rd day.
2.0,Not what I thought it would be. It’s says cotton but the robe I received is thick like canvas. If you’re looking for a lightweight robe this isn’t it. It’s also a faded black like it’s been washed. Disappointed.
2.0,Fabric tears away from waist elastic during wash.
2.0,These were rather stiff and had little stretch. I like all my clothes to have a decent amount of stretch and these didnt. Color is beautiful and length isnt too short but arent grandma short either
2.0,Amazingly beautiful but broke as I was putting it on so won't get to ever wear it.
2.0,"Unfortunately this particular pair of earrings were NOT as nice as described.  The metal was pretty thin, and the detail on the earrings is not a good as it should be. The stones are very small and do not reflect much color or light.  I realize these were not a high dollar priced earring, but I was disappointed in them.  I probably will never wear them."
2.0,"The dress is cute. I mean it’s not a quality product, but  enough for a season and what do you want for that price🤷🏾‍♀️"
2.0,"Tight fit.  Additionally,  the color started to fade after 2nd wear"
2.0,"I wasn't reading closely enough and missed the fact that these are not polarized. That is an important feature, so I ended up buying a different product which is polarized (at a higher price, of course)."
2.0,"These briefs have an awkward cut through the seat, making the them loose in the butt and ride up in the crack. This combined with the limited space in the crotch for the junk make these underwear a definite ""can not recommend."""
2.0,"Can see my bra through it and the ""Girls"" don't like being seen."
2.0,fits weird.
2.0,I'm quite disappointed with these leggings. They fit fine in the waist but pull too much in the legs. The material is soft but is a lot lighter in color then expected. I ended up giving them to my daughter cause she liked them better than I did.
2.0,I got a size larger than I needed and was still to tight.
2.0,Its very pretty but turned my finger green and tarnished after only wearing for a short time
2.0,They are cute but uncomfortable due to the seems and they run small
2.0,These did not fit on the glasses the ends with the hole to slip onto the glasses is too small
2.0,en la imagen se ve mas grande que lo esperado y el articulo esta hecho de un metal muy flexible por lo que se rompe el palio que lo sostiene
2.0,much larger and not as green at all as expected
2.0,One of the strap broke after/during the 2nd wear
2.0,"WAS NOT TRUE TO SIZE, RUNS SMALL"
2.0,The material isn’t soft it is heavier but also feels cheap. I’m not quite sure how to describe it but not happy with it.<br />It also was very large around the neck. I got an XL for baggy fit and the neck is huge.
2.0,"The bracelet was beautiful, but once I opened the clasp, it would not close again. Returned it."
2.0,One might think an XL would be pretty much XL. Not this product. More like a Large.
2.0,Chain broke two days after I bought it. Pretty if it would have stayed in one piece.
2.0,"I dislike these pants because the fabric is thin. Not see through that I can tell, but thin. The quality feels cheap and these pants aren't cheap in my opinion.<br /><br />They are not flattering because the waist is tighter than the rest so if you have a mom belly like me you get this bulge above and below the pant's band."
2.0,Loved the material and cut but the way they did the crotch seam showed a bit too much. Returning these :(
2.0,"The nose and lips are so large that they don't match the person's face.  Rather than elegant, it's sort of comical."
2.0,"Was really excited to get these and wear with an outfit I had in mind, but the olive isn't anywhere close to olive. It's like a heathered brown.<br /><br />They are comfortable, so I will keep, but was hoping for a more true olive like the sweater I compared it to in the pictures"
2.0,Wouldn't recommend for chubby baby. Elastic is pretty tight but leaves mark on skin and it doesn't hold in place when baby crawls. Had to return.
2.0,They provide arch support for everyday use but are too stiff for running and gave me sores after only a mile run. Returning them. Dr Scholls gel inserts  are much more comfortable for running
2.0,I was very disappointed with this handbag simply because the &#34;fabric&#34; of the zippered flap is not the same color and it is tough and hard. I kept it because it would probably cost too much to bother to return it but I definitely will not order again and don't recommend that others order it.
2.0,Really loved the watch when it arrived in December. It's now April and the seconds hand fell off!
2.0,"They work. Have a very very light tint when you put them on. Not good for me in the daytime, makes the screen brighter. My real problem with these is they are extremely tight, with no real give on the arms. They give me a headache to wear. I don't have a wide head, not sure why they are so tight. Feel more like they are for pre-teens. Thinking of returning. I love how light the tint is though, reason I purchased this set.<br /><br />returned, couldn't use them to tight and didn't sit even were uneven placed them on a table to make sure might have got a bad pair but I won't be purchasing them again"
2.0,This dress is so cute! But waaaaay too big.  I'm a size  US4/6 and the small swallowed me.  Disappointed.
2.0,"This shirt's colors are WAYYYY brighter than in the picture. My boyfriend said no way would he wear it, LOL."
2.0,"18 months size runs too small even for my 12 months old. loose threads, thin fabric."
2.0,"It does what its supposed to however, Filters don't fit no matter which way you turn it. Mask itself is made of cheap material. If that's what you need to for it, it works. Wouldn't recommend for daily use."
2.0,"This was very small for its size, for it is beautiful, but I can't wear it. =[. The good news, I hope by summer to be my smallest size ever, then maybe it will fit?!?"
2.0,"It fits exactly as expected. The material is poor quality (But that's what you get when you pay less than $20). When I received the skirt, it had snags and tears."
2.0,"These socks are good in theory -- they're definitely no show for shoes like Vans, Converse, and Toms. The problems though, start almost immediately. They are VERY thin -- so thin, your toe is likely to poke through after a couple wears. The sticky part (meant to keep the sock on your foot) irritates over time, leaving a deep red and uncomfortable mark. The socks also came apart at the seam where the toe section meets the foot section. Honestly, though, for the price... if you're looking for cheap no-show socks.. these are good. You're just not going to get a lifetime out of these."
2.0,Not like the factory lenses. I would not buy them again.
2.0,"Really like this suit, fabric very comfortable, however, the length is very short. Returned for a refund."
2.0,"When we received this item in the mail, I was very happy with it. The material was soft; it fit as expected, and was a suitable thickness. I wanted to wash it before my son wore it, and after one wash, there was a hole in the inside of the leg where the seam came apart that measured 3.5 inches."
2.0,I had bought a 2XL thinking it would fit if I got the dress 2 sizes too big. Y’all...no. The bottom half of the dress fit to size but the top. It was like an XS on a 2XL. Needless to say I returned it. Couldn’t breathe and could barely get it off.
2.0,"This was a poorly made “sweater.” As soon as I tried it on, part of the stitching came loose, and this was straight from the bag. The material is extremely thin, not nearly as thick as it appears in the photo, and the color is much brighter, like a highlighter. The hearts are way tinier than the photo as well. Just really disappointed. This will be a camping top since I won’t wear this in public, and could care less about it getting stained or dirty. Lol!"
2.0,"If I could rate this item as a cool steering wheel trinket, I would give it a 5.  It's cool looking, heavy and seems to be made well.  But it's not a trinket.  It is a keychain and one important thing about a keychain is that the keys should not fall off the keychain.  I've had my key and my key fob fall off the keychain because the mechanism that twists to allow you to put the key and key fob onto it does not stay locked in place securely.  The part that pulls out does not recess back into far enough to lock in well.  Too bad since the construction is otherwise great.  Attempts to contact Custom Werks have not been returned."
2.0,Looks nice on a hanger but doesn't fit right. Runs small at the waist and inner liner (crotch) - would be really uncomfortable to wear out. Maybe if an XL was available it would fit better but it runs small for sure.  The top is much too loose AND wide to cover you (love me some cleavage but this would get you arrested)  Also smells like body odor.. I'll sell it on offerup to try and get my money back.
2.0,"Once or twice a day it either stops or looses time. I have yet figured out how to change the date.<br />Other than that, it is really a good looking watch"
2.0,Not an adult size. Bought as a gag gift so it did the job.
2.0,"Well, I was warned that these items run small. However I did not expect that an XXL from Face N Face would be more like a childs small shirt. There is no way that in reality a XXL would be so small. Or maybe i'm just way bigger than I thought I was. The shirt itself didn't even fit over my boobs, the sleeves, supposed to be long sleeve however are just to my elbows. Small people should buy this product. Even though I checked the size chart, really be sure that it fits, go big because this shirt runs very small. I'll be giving this as a gift to my niece who is 10. Great price and great fabric.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount and/or free of charge for unbiased and honest testing/reviewing reasons. I have received no payment for my reviews, and my reviews are not swayed by my discount. Each review is of my own opinion"
2.0,"The gloves work as described... but they arrived with a hole (about as large as a finger tip) between 2 knuckles.  Super lame.  I'll sew it up... but its discouraging.  Like everyone else is saying, there are quality issues with this product.  But I'm sure I'll be satisfied once I've repaired it."
2.0,I ordered these and some snaps that also says 18 22mm but the snaps will not fit I have some other ones for a necklace that is 12mm and they fit. So did I get sent the wrong ones or something?
2.0,"Does not work at all for smartphone. Still need to use a bare finger to operate the screen, and this was one of the major reasons I brought them"
2.0,"Yes they are cute, if you are looking for a cheap pair of glasses for the lake or ones you don't mind braking these are for you. I am  very Poteet and the glasses where to big for my face and looked cheaply made, yes they were only $5 but most of their products don't look like they would be the price that they are marked. Very disappointed in these."
2.0,The dress was beautiful but I guess the size run small
2.0,Does not stay on your shoulder.
2.0,Came crumpled up and clearly used previously p
2.0,Washed garmet twice and the sleeve seams tore. Cheap cheap cheap
2.0,"Ordered a M, an XL arrived, kept it for an oversized sweatshirt. I think it would be true to size"
2.0,It doesn't look great and the arms are short.
2.0,Would have been great if it hadn't started falling apart after one wash :(
2.0,It was cute but was small. Returned.
2.0,"Too snug, has very little give/stretch to it."
2.0,"Had two pairs, both got a hole in the same place. My guess cheap stitching job."
2.0,They pilled after the first wear. Very comfortable!
2.0,"Cute, definitely run very small, wish they fit"
2.0,It’s cute and vibrant color but the sizing is WAY OFF. It’s advertizied as 18-24 months but the one I received just says 24 months and it’s very large and wide. Im going to have to return and order a smaller size.
2.0,"Boots overall construction and durability are fine, but very poor arch support. If you purchase will need inserts to support arch in boots."
2.0,Didn't like these. Fit everywhere except for the waist. Super uncomfortable.
2.0,"I wouldn't stay on my ear because it was too big. I got rid of it a few days later. If you have small ears then don't get this. Other than that, I like the dragon :p"
2.0,Love the art but the material  cheap and the bottom needed more structure for shape. I couldn't believe it came folded in a bag and could ne put in mailbox.
2.0,This large is like a XL large.  Too big to wear!
2.0,Center seam is Sewn crooked. Cute hat but small fit.
2.0,Way too small. Sizing is not accurate
2.0,"The gold material did not have a high sheen to it, unlike the image.  It looked like a plain beige.  I was not confident how well it would wash.  I was very disappointed in the quality."
2.0,The product and material was so low quality. The fit themselves were bad too besides the halter. Total miss. And totally see through
2.0,I usually wear 71/4 size hat but this particular brand of hat was way too oversized
2.0,"Way too long, need to shorten"
2.0,Didn't work ....bummer.
2.0,This was not size accurate. Far too big for a 3X. Even after it was washed.
2.0,"NOT RAYON AT ALL...I purchased dress because it was described as 95% Rayon IT HAS NO RAYON &  even the label on the dress shows that it is 62% Polyester, 32% Cotton 6%spandex. It fits well and is cute but it is HOT COTTON not for summer and is a cat/dog hair magnet."
2.0,"I ordered this product 2 times.  Both times the print, Woody's  picture, was coming off the back of the shirt.  I like the shirt but I returned it due to poor manufacturing."
2.0,Too small and short!
2.0,"Wish the labeling was clear on the site - (weight/height) this is for an older kid (8-12 years?).  We bought it for our toddler, thinking it would work, but even I fit in this thing!"
2.0,"My daughter is 6, and of slender build.  This was still too small for her,  length -wise.  The fabric however is nice,  more cotton content than another popular brand's."
2.0,Had to give them to my daughter
2.0,it looks cheap.
2.0,"Delivered on time. Material quality was decent, but for a 2x, women's sizing,  this was really, really small. Probably wouldn't order from this company again."
2.0,Super cute earrings but very weak and fragile. They didn’t last long without breaking.
2.0,Disappointed about the material of this. It’s not sweatshirt material. Just didn’t like how it felt
2.0,way too small -teesy!
2.0,This cover up is way too sheer. As you can see from the photo it is not the same product as in the Amazon listing. Did you are okay showing all your business go ahead and buy it. If you’d like it to “cover” you up - don’t buy it. Disappointed.
2.0,Felt comfortable and warm.
2.0,This coat wasn't true to style or size...
2.0,Very shiney material. Proportions were off. Even being heavy chested it still didn't fit right and meant for very broad shoulders.<br /><br />Wasn't a fan
2.0,"I'm wearing just the moon part now because the stone part fell off almost immediately.<br />&#34;stone&#34; is a laughable description as its a glass bead with paper glued to the backing and it doens't fall at all like it does in the pic... i'd love to show you if the stone hadn't fallen off, but the planet part sits under the moon when wearing, so it almost looks like an eclipse.<br /><br />meh. wouldn't look for this again."
2.0,"These fall apart quickly and easily, and barely big enough to fit my 2nd grader."
2.0,"The backs do not fit the post, will have to buy more backs.  Liked the earings."
2.0,"I bought this watch band because I wanted something that would be durable and rugged. I did not want a plastic watch band that breaks after a couple of weeks or a metal one that snags when I wear my watch at work. Unfortunately the buckle tongue is too short and it slips behind the buckle. This makes it a pain to put on the watch. I Didn't mind that shortcoming so much at first because once I managed to get the watch on and buckled, it did not give me any problems. Unfortunately the adjustment holes have stretched out. So, now, if I flex my wrist or if the watch shifts a  little, the buckle tongue slips behind the buckle and the watch comes undone. The other day I was climbing a 30 foot ladder when my watch came undone and fell all the way down to the concrete floor below. If I had a watch with a glass watch face, it would have broken for sure. So now I am searching for a watchband that wont fall apart after only a month of daily use."
2.0,Only two arrived in a ripped up bag
2.0,"One of the clips that held on the straps was broken upon arrival, but was able to fix with a screw."
2.0,"i like the brand and the words on the shirt, but the style and cut is all wrong.This shirt was not as attractive, as it looks online. Way too large and oversize to the max.If you are petite, this shirt is not for you. It is way too baggy in the front, and i am not even a plus size person. Disappointed in paying so much for a t-shirt, that does not even fit the way it should."
2.0,More like a choker rather than a necklace:(  doesn’t fit on larger necks
2.0,"These socks are not at all what I expected. They are very thin, so no warmth. They are too roomy. And they do not meet my standards."
2.0,"a bit warm, but they do offer protection from UV"
2.0,Chain is too short. Turns my neck a different color. It's very pretty.
2.0,"I ordered this mask thinking it would be glittery, like the title suggests. It's not. It more reminds me of a more colorful version of a snow screen on TV. The nose wire was all the way to one side, rather than in the middle; I had to scootch it over to center it for actual use. Not gonna recommend, and still looking for a glittery teal and purple mask."
2.0,"Falls of easily, stretches easily."
2.0,it's look like a toy.
2.0,When I ordered a size 3 I assumed (apparently incorrectly) it would fit a toddler.  The pants were so big they could almost fit me. Probably would have been nice if they were a normal size but they were enormous.
2.0,It's pretty and looks like the picture but it doesn't lay flat on
2.0,This does not look like the photo at all. It’s comfortable but I don want to look like I’m homeless.
2.0,Material is really thin and super clingy. Order 2 sizes up!
2.0,"Way to small. I like small purses, but this was way to small. I switched back to my smaller wallet and it barely fit inside. With the wallet in the main compartment you couldn't get anything else in there. Then I had a hard time pulling the wallet out to use it anytime I needed it. The front and back pockets were kind of smashed in on the bottom so that things didn't go all the way down in. The front pocket barely holds my cell phone, the back one has a handful of pens in it. That's it, that's all it would hold. Sending it back."
2.0,If you like this type of wallet
2.0,"I bought these and went to wear them, the frame was already cracked. When I bought them they were fine. I don't know if leaving them in my car in the garage caused them to have too much heat or what but I never actually wore them."
2.0,looked like a trinket from a machine you get in stores for 25cents looked like a cheap peace of tat
2.0,Very filmsy.
2.0,"I found these to run a little small. I am typically a very comfortable large - like with room- and these larges were tight. They don’t stretch as much as other brands, so they seem a little tight in the wrong areas. They may have shrunk in the wash though-<br />I forgot to try on before I washed/dried them.  Just wanted to share for others to consider"
2.0,"i have bout this 2 times,once as a large and the other as a 3zl, both are the same size, if wouldn't be a problem if this was a stretchy material"
2.0,Loved it but had to return it because it didn't keep accurate time.
2.0,"The top is really cute, but the fabric is super thin and slightly see through, all the seams had pulls in the fabric or small tears.  I was bummed that I had to return it!"
2.0,"These are really small pieces,<br />Some were broken<br />Some don't make sense.<br />Definitely random because you don't get everything pictured<br />Some are really cute."
2.0,"These fit quite large, hoping they shrink..."
2.0,Rides up the leg into your crotch and is very uncomfortable and also does not have a exit flap for your ding dong
2.0,"Didn't use because advertised wrist size was not accurate, the method of securing to wrist used well over an inch of band. The value would be good for smaller wrists"
2.0,Fits very tight in the mid area.
2.0,Very low rise leggings. Hard to keep up on my waist.
2.0,Much thinner than previous purchase of same description. Cheaper and lighter. Not suitable for winter weather.
2.0,Cute shirt but runs EXTREMELY small!
2.0,"The lenses pop out occasionally, not a fashion statement but does cover all eye area from spit spray. Only bought them for coronavirus protection. Cheaply made"
2.0,"Way too short. 5'5&#34; niece tried it on and it barely covered her rear. Would be ok with leggings, I would DEFINITELY go up a size. Colors are pretty. Material thin as expected but not see through. It's not a straight cut, which to me makes it obvious that it's a dress that's too."
2.0,For the price of $40.00 bucks they could have at least put a real piece of stone.....first day i wore this braclet i cracked the piece of plastic they have in this bracelet
2.0,Silver wore off less than 2weeks
2.0,"This is absolutely gorgeous, especially at this price.  However, there is a downward point at the bottom of the nose piece that digs in painfully if you have a ski jump shape at the bottom portion of your nose.  The mask arrived packaged beautifully, and without flaw, except for the design problem.  Also keep in mind that the seller has a complicated return process, including printing your own label and mailing it back via USPS, and also keeps a 15% restocking fee.  They also say they will take 4 weeks to refund your money, and that they will not refund an item that has been returned in less than original packed condition (so don’t take it out of the package).  This would be a lovely item to buy at a brick and mortar boutique, where you could try it on before buying.  I just can’t recommend buying it here."
2.0,Cheap plastic. Broke after a few days of use.<br />The good news is that Amazon provided a refund. Thank you Amazon!<br /><br />I will purchase a different item.
2.0,It's comfy dress but the embroidery is not soft and it is very eechy. Was not soft at all inside the sleeves and around the dress. This was very disappointing
2.0,Expected it to be longer and hang like the picture
2.0,"Too much of a bucket on my head. I have a big head and store-bought hats do not fit on my head. Bought this cute hat, since it was advertised for big heads. Bought the smallest size, but when I wear it, I cannot see where I’m going."
2.0,"This has been a problem since about a month after I bought it, but finally its bugged me enough on this last trip to take a photo and send it. The sewing quality is not good. The lining has been separating from the outer material since I got this. I only have 2 or 3 cards at a time, and ever more than 1 card per slot. Its just not sewn together very well. Looking for a new and better designed one now."
2.0,Poorly tailored dress. Lining on top chest area is revealing and shows the cheapness of dress. Cannot get away with just bra. Lace is otherwise good and looks nice in pics. Fitting is loose in the waist.
2.0,"This item faded quickly, within days"
2.0,"Material was very cheap, felt papery. Does not look like the image at all."
2.0,"This necklace is pretty, but not the color that is shown. Its more orange not red"
2.0,Feels nice but it's too tight.  Gives me a headache.
2.0,These ripped after 5 minutes
2.0,I have this dress in 3 colors now.  The pink is my least favorite.  The material is thin enough that the pink color shows through.  I originally wanted to wear black tights with the pink but you can see straight through the dress and see where the black tights stop on my waist and that doesn't look good.  I will try with my nude colored tights next time.
2.0,"Cute designs!  However, even though the calves are wide, the ankles are so small that my daughter couldn't even out them on.  We will be returning this item.  Very disappointed!<br /><br />Surprised once again that the manufacturer or designer can't fathom that, if you have large calves, you probably have above standard size ankles!"
2.0,"Cute shoes, but I was surprised to see that the sole insert was made out of cardboard. 😳 The memory foam was on top of it. These shoes wouldn’t last long after the cardboard got soaked with sweat."
2.0,"Dress was rather heavy, very ringled. Shipped in  a package to small.<br />NOW WHERE IS MY $24.99, SHIPPING CHARGE.  THIS ORDER WAS FREE SHIPPING.  PROVIDE THE $92.00 and the $24.99"
2.0,I have had this product for 5 1/2 months and the plastic flap that slips into the wallet has already cracked and come apart. It needs to  be more sturdy.  Buyers beware.
2.0,"This is, and looks like, a very cheap jacket. Unlined, serged seams. Very light material that may not be cut or sewn to hang properly, so mine had a tendency to ripple and flip up at the back hem. Actually I was too embarrassed to wear it to work. And for the price (over $40 as of this review) the quality is incredibly poor. A similar jacket at Ross shouldn’t cost more than $24. Or just buy a better jacket."
2.0,Not as pictured or described. Way too tight doesn't look anything like the picture at all
2.0,"Cute but it doesn't screw on with proper orientation. Unfortunately, the top looks crooked compared to bottom piece because you have to screw it tight and it leaves it with a lopsided look. Poorly made but thats what you get for cheap price. It didn't turn my skin green but I won't buy again or continue wearing it."
2.0,Reflects the price. Ill be returning it.
2.0,I have a small head and this is still super small!
2.0,Nice but thoufht I was getting pierced one's!!!!!
2.0,"Red frame is beautiful, but these glasses don't block any sun and you have to pay shipping to return them, not worth it."
2.0,i was excited about getting it.. but it was just weird .. there's a section that is not sticky for your nipples which is actually really nice but it then forces you to wear it in a way that you nipples are in that section and that made it awkward . it comes to far lateral and also pulls your breast down
2.0,"Beautiful skirt, made of soft fabric, but only for petite figure.  Size L would fit about a size 8 and XL maybe a size 10."
2.0,"The print was adorable, but the deep V on the children bathing suit kept us from allowing our 7 year old to wear it. She even mentioned something about it before we said anything about the fit. It also runs small."
2.0,"While the product says that it's a wrap dress, you should know that the color I got (green) is just a pullover dress with a crossover bodice. The material is cheap polyester that is staticky, and while it drapes nicely in the skirt, the bodice fits strangely and looks boxy. The waist hit somewhere between my natural waist and an empire waist, and I'm not sure which it was supposed to be. Returning it."
2.0,I’m so mad that I have to return these because I absolutely love them! The only reason I’m returning is because they are completely see-through!!! Please make these in a non see through material and I will buy them again.  Very disappointing!  Buyers beware!
2.0,"I had read the comments before I ordered, so I order a Xlarge and it fit a little tight!<br />I uselly wear medium."
2.0,"I really like this design. I've bought other bracelets from the designer before, but I find they all have the same issue. The beads don't stay in place. I am constantly adjust them back into place. In this item, the square blocks keep sliding back, which makes the bracelet looks ugly. I need to figure out a way to secure them myself, and perhaps then, I'll wear it."
2.0,It’s very cute and very soft but the thing is it’s way too big on me it goes to my thighs and I thought it would be just a nice little sweater that would fit me but it’s way too big but it’s cute :)
2.0,Smaller than expected. The material is rough not very comfortable. It also smashes my boobs but that's probably because of the fit. Better to go to the store and try them on. I haven't had luck with buying bras online...
2.0,Tiny  This may be suitable for a very little child.  Chain of poor quality
2.0,"My daughter liked it because she wanted one of these...but it`s not a good quality item. The chain broke the first day, the locket does`t close properly after a couple of tries."
2.0,I expect the zipper to break within the first month of winter.  But it feels warm.
2.0,"Lasted three months before the side split away from the back. Cute case, though."
2.0,"Cute hat but very flimsy.  When I removed it from the box there were several creases around the brim.  Left it hanging to see if creases would soften out, but they did not.  Difinetely not worth the price.  Returned it."
2.0,The fabric is horrible quality.  Feels like Styrofoam.  To be fair it was only 16$. However with how many positive reviews it had I had expected better.
2.0,Beautiful top. Runs really small.
2.0,Not a huge fan. I received these way more distressed than the picture to the point where the bottoms were ripped and just hanging from a string.
2.0,The stitching and fabric did not hold up well to one single washing. The fabric is quite soft though.
2.0,"Enjoyed the back, down side is you can’t fit a water bottle or even an iPhone in the cup holder."
2.0,I got the baby outfit I ordered it for an infant. The shirt was size 5 and the shorts were 24 months
2.0,"The picture of this dress is so much prettier than the dress in person.  It is made out of kind of cheap material, but the mesh with the design on it was pretty.  It fit as expected, but I wasn't overly happy about having to pull it over my head since it doesn't zip up in the back.  There is a zipper on the side to let out some material in the top when putting it on.  When I received the dress, it had a bunch of white gunk on it that I was unable to get off so I had to send it back and decided not to reorder one."
2.0,I actually like these pants but they were soooooo small. I gave them to my niece. I am a size 16 regular in woman and I couldn't even get these on. They r really cute tho!
2.0,"Size wise, spot on, but style is VERY boxy, which I wasn't thinking it would be."
2.0,It has elastic that cups the butt.  Feels really weird and draws a lot of attention to the butt.
2.0,Pretty piece but way to small for an ankle bracelet unless your very tiny or a kid.
2.0,Shirt fit well and was very soft but the flag was sticky shiny plastic and stiff. The plastic was stuck together I had to pull apart when I took it out of the bag. I was hoping it was part of the material not like an iron on. Returned.
2.0,Beautiful but one of the pins that holds links together broke within about two weeks of my giving it to my son. Very disappointing because he liked it so much.
2.0,"The style is OK and the quality seems OK for the price but the fit is a little small and they're super see-through. I am 5'6"" about 150 and I usually wear a medium. I bought a large, and they were still a little too tight. I have several tattoos, and that causes some issues with more see-through items. If I didn't have tattoos they would be better, but I would still return them due to the fit. You can see my shark silhouettes tattoo through the pants in the picture. I hope this review helps!"
2.0,"Very small, very.  An actual dime is slightly larger by a frogs hair, if that.  It can completely hide behind a nickel.  The graphics in their pic has great detail, especially on the cannons themselves.  The actual item does not provide the same detail in any sense.  You will need a magnifying glass just to see and read it.  The metal case is to large for the printed art work and the sides of the metal case rise above the edge (not enough rosin), easily placing a fingernail along the edge.  At $9.95 it was my mistake to purchase, BAD BUY.  I would not purchase again if they priced at .99, it is still to much.<br /><br />After further review...<br /><br />Butterfly clasp arrived broken<br />Rosin doesn’t even fill the entire cavity<br />Printing looks like a cheap inkjet, easily see pixels with magnifying glass"
2.0,"Is a complete different dress from the one on the advertised picture, poor quality and not the same at all."
2.0,COULDNT EVEN FIGURE OUT HOW TO WEAR IT. RAN VERY SMALL.
2.0,Ordered an XL the band size is 32!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!  And I ordered larger since it said runs small.  The XL is a medium at best.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY unless you are super skinny and flat chested
2.0,The pants are way too short on this jumper and the top is pulled up tight. I have a normal length torso and it still just doesn’t fit right. Not worth the buy.
2.0,"The display is far too dark to function as a watch for most purposes. The electronically displayed numbers can only be seen, at all, on a certain angle. The backlight might-as-well not even exist, as it does nothing.<br />The watch does look nice, if you like a very very large face and don't need to use the watch for any purpose beyond bling."
2.0,Poor Quality. It had poor stitches and like a ripped hole on the sleeve.
2.0,Very odd design with lots of thick material under the arm along the side.
2.0,This would be great for pre-schoolers.
2.0,"This is really a great-looking sweatshirt, and it feels like a good quality.  The downside is that there is ZERO stretch to the fabric.  You would have to get it WAY over-sized unless you have ittybitty shoulders."
2.0,This product is cute but the was missing a tooth. It was also alot smaller than i expected it dose not fit my face right. But if i put it over a black mask it does what i intended it to. Scare off men. I feel alot safer thank you.
2.0,They barely looked blue much less like true Tanzanite color which should be a deep purpley blue.
2.0,I'm completely disappointed I ordered the Star Wars Rebel emblem logo wallet and I got Boba Fett I mean who doesn't like Boba Fett but I ordered the rebel one. My husband's birthday is tomorrow what I'm going to do!
2.0,I ordered a brown one but a black what came
2.0,"It was too small, by length sadly! Need to exchange for a bigger size! Son usually wears a 10 and ordered a Medium that they said fits a 10-12. Hopefully the large fits! It will be a cool shirt if it does!"
2.0,Elastic band rolled. Lived fit and material but could not wear shirt tucked inside.
2.0,It’s not anti fog
2.0,This was more of an orangy-red than pictured and it was very clunky and cheap looking.  I returned it.
2.0,"ALMOST A SCAM. You can use it to tell time, but it is the most inaccurate, unresponsive piece of junk I have ever bought in a watch.  I figured out within a day or 2 this watch was not for me because it didn't do what it said it would do within any reasonable interval of accuracy. When I looked to return it, I was told I had to send to Poland! :-0 Of course I would have to pay the postage which was as much as the watch. OMG.  For $200 I have a great bit for comedy, but not a worth while watch for swimming in the least."
2.0,Was Amazing for the first month until the green on the inside came off....very disappointed...
2.0,The XL and XXL are too small I typically wear a large or XL t shirt.  The money wasn't eared though as my kids love their new shirts!
2.0,"Tried on a friends hat that looked the same, and it was unbelievably warm.Clearly, this one is not the same. Am going to try to return this. It might be considered warm if you live in California, but my other hats are definitely warmer and look better.The quality of the &#34;fur&#34; is akin to lightweight cotton and its basically like putting a scarf on your head. So...if you are only getting it for style and live in a warm climate this would be ok, but its not at all comparable to my hat with ear flaps , or knitted caps for warmth. And really, it took a while to be delivered, and so sad that quality was lacking, and warmth was definitely lacking. Will try to return!"
2.0,"Fits, but does nothing to control bounce and movement.  Returned."
2.0,"This dress was WAY too small.Very hard for me to believe this is Plus-Size. I read the few reviews that were listed before deciding to purchase the XXL.I am normally a size 14. The dress was EXTREMELY too tight and clung to EVERY imperfection. I think the idea/style of the dress is nice, but the sizing was way off."
2.0,"This bathing suit is pretty and its well made. I got size small and I'm 113lbs, 4'-11"" and 32DDD. My issue with the suit is the bottoms seem to run smaller than your typical size small. The bottom fit more like and XS. It is very cheeky too (not a problem for me but figured I would mention it). You can tell how cheeky it is from my photos, the front is almost as small as the back. The bottoms do not look like the photos on amazon. The bikini top on the other hand is so large. I adjusted the band to the tightest setting and it fit like a 36 inch band. The traps are also way too long even on the shortest setting (as you can see from the photo). After trying the top on, it feels like I'm not wearing anything since its so lose on me.  I feel like the bikini set I got is different than whats pictured on amazon."
2.0,"LOOK INEXPENSIVE, PAID COUPLE BUCKS MORE AND WERE REAL CLOTH AND MUCH BETTER PRODUCT"
2.0,"I'm a fan of Zattcas clothing, but I had to return this item. It did not fit well at all. It hung like a giant pajama shirt and was not at all flattering. I was sad to return this because I loved the print, and I'm familiar with the material as I have several other Zattcas dresses."
2.0,Too small for a child
2.0,"It looks stylish in picture but was blocky on, returned it. Looked like a large T shirt dresd"
2.0,"It was cute, cut felt flimsy. Ended up bent so i gave up and threw it away."
2.0,The shirt I received was not as pictured. It was sleeveless. I was expecting it to have short sleeves. Other then that it looks cute.
2.0,Does not look at all like in the picture.
2.0,The material is not what I expected.  It's like having a long bathing suit on
2.0,"Too small fabric is too transparent  so disappointed,"
2.0,"For the price of this top, I didn’t except a carefully hand sewn garment of the finest wool-viscose blend. But based on all the many good reviews, I figured it would be decent fast fashion level of quality. No. Nope, not even close. What came to mind when I opened the package was “budget Phys-Ed gym class pinafore” for real. The lowest, thinnest, crappiest polyester is proudly on display here. Touching this material feels like it’s gonna curse your skin.<br />I guess it’s my fault for responding to an insta ad for cheap Amazon clothes. If you really want something like this, take the extra step to create an AliExpress account and you can get a whole pallet for what you pay for this one shirt.<br />Do not recommend."
2.0,A cheap China resell.  I shouldn't have paid more than $5 for this.
2.0,"I have average sized feet, but these fit too snug around the toes and ball of the foot. Yes, I tried simply pulling a little slack of the end of each toe, but then they were too long on the toe. Give it a try, you can always return if they don't fit YOU."
2.0,Only one comes so it basically takes twice as long to stretch a pair of shoes. And there are no instructions so I don't even know what do with ONE shoe!
2.0,I Got size 32 and they were way too big.
2.0,"i got it with grey print and not white,thin shirt and smaller size"
2.0,"This is a very warm and soft coat. However, after only a few weeks, the seem behind the shoulder has ripped. Also, only one side of the waist is adjustable-defective on the other side. The drawstrings hang out everywhere, making it look sloppy. I have to pull the bottom of the coat up above my hips when I sit down because it’s a tight in that part, fits as expected elsewhere. This coat will go into trash after this winter."
2.0,I would order 1 size larger.
2.0,It would fit if the zipper didnt get stuck
2.0,I was surprised to see this was sparkly. Which means for my taste I can’t wear it on a regular occasion. It’s also thinner than it appears in the pic and the stitching makes it look cheap. Might be a good shirt for a beach vacation though.
2.0,Charm is cute but it was delivered with a broken chain.
2.0,Feels as if it's made of plastic
2.0,Pom fell off after 2 times of being worn other than that. My boyfriend still likes it.
2.0,Did not polish Silver as expected. Have a wine chiller with silver. Had to sent back for service to repolish.
2.0,"The dress was a beautiful lace but way too big. I'm 5'2"" 125 lbs and it hung on me like a curtain. No shape whatsoever."
2.0,"Definitely runs small! Order at least a size bigger, consider two sizes up.  On the plus side, it is very breathable with the large mesh. I'm giving mine away to a tiny coworker and ordering a different vest."
2.0,Not a good everyday head wrap.  This item is good for a more formal use rather than causal days to day.  Beautiful color though.
2.0,"I love the t-shirt; however, I typically wear a large, but I bought an XL for comfort. It’s like wearing a medium. Go up two sizes."
2.0,These are not sweat pants and they do run small
2.0,This choker is for people with very skinny necks.
2.0,This must be made for someone taller... I’m 5’2” and it swallows me up and comes down to my knees! The inseam is particularly low too! Hoping the tailor can work her magic because it certainly has potential! The fabric is good quality! Durable and cute!
2.0,This is really not a one size fits all. I would have needed to get this taken in about 4 inches on each side. Returned.
2.0,"The fabric description is wrong online. Inside of sweater says 42% acrylic 28% nylon 30% pbt but believe me when I say I’m positive there is WOOL in this sweater! I’m allergic to wool & immediately broke out into a rash after trying this on for less than a minute. Wool is the ONLY fabric that causes this type of allergic reaction on me. It’s very heavy & thick which is odd for the sleeveless type of sweater it is unless you plan to wear a shirt underneath, it would be uncomfortable wearing it as advertised. Returning!"
2.0,"Very large/wide for stated size, I can't keep them on my feet, they are a tripping hazard. Into the Goodwill /thrift store pile."
2.0,"It’s ok. Be aware of dress you’re ordering. I thought I was getting lined & flowy dress shown in first pics. I ordered a different dress with no lining, thin material with no give to it. The pattern is cute.  I was going to return, but it was my mistake & might make a very casual sun dress, at best."
2.0,I have a pair of the regular ones which I bought last year for Halloween and loved so I came back this year for a new color for my costume. When I saw new ones with pockets I got very excited and bought them. The first pair I received had several holes in the butt and along the seam so I ordered another pair to exchange them. Today I received the new pair and once again I am finding small holes near the seam. I will try one more time in hopes of getting a good pair because I really do like the leggings and the pockets.
2.0,It was a good product but I had order a small for my boyfriend and it was HUGE!!!
2.0,fit like a stocking. More of a child size.
2.0,"The material feels like paper, not soft at all."
2.0,"One of the scrawbacks will not stay on, so i used another backing, but i really wanted the screwback feature for my baby so i dont have to worry. If the seller will send me another back or earring or both, i would greatly appreciate it."
2.0,It's super sheer.  Might as well be lingerie.  Wouldn't be caught dead wearing it unless i was going to the beach
2.0,"These really didn’t work for me, and we’re not what I expected. They were very small on my face, first of all. And I do have a slightly larger face than average, but the photos made me think these were oversized and lavish. They are not. They’re about the size of typical women’s wayfarers. Another surprise was they mostly Rita’s brown in the lenses, none of that gold to Greene town that I ordered. Maybe I didn’t end up with the product that I initially ordered, I don’t know. But they sure didn’t look yellow and green.<br /><br />Another detail I just didn’t love where the angular beveled edges of the frames. They were very shiny and that struck me as much more distracting than it had seemed in the photos. I’m sure there are people who can pull them off, but none of them are me! These went straight in the trash unfortunately."
2.0,"The pink floral dress is not even close to the picture.  It was a very weird pink-beige color.  Looked awful on.  I returned it and got another color.  The fit was ok.  Top fit fine, but overall a little boxy on the frame."
2.0,"I was super excited when I ordered this dress as this was one my hubby had picked out after showing him a few photos of dressed that I was looking at. This dress however is made from a very flimsy, see through material. Not all what I was expecting. I don't know if I can even wear this with a dress slip unless I can find a full body one. It is not lined at all either. The material is soft and comfortable but very transparent. It does fit my body well but until I can figure out how I can wear this without any embarrassment, it is going to the back of my closet."
2.0,"This coat is a bit ridiculous through a seamstress’ eyes. It looks just fine. The fake/oddly missing buttons, cheap plastic zipper, orange fur lining and weird false-pockets-that-are-actually-pockets are just strange. Like someone saw a photo and tried to imitate without having actually worn a coat before. Oh well. I need it for early mornings in Hawaii, so it doesn’t need to be all that nice."
2.0,Runs small. Cheap price cheap material. You get what you pay for.
2.0,I don't recommend these for flats. These still show through - the toe area is too large. The material also doesn't wick away the sweat.
2.0,This runs small and the material is not ideal. It makes noise every time you move. I returned it.
2.0,"Cute, but had to return. Very slim fit."
2.0,"Very disappointed when we received this. I ordered a size up for my daughter and as you can see from the photo it's very short on her. She likes it so we will keep it, but i was hoping for a swimsuit cover up that covered her bottom."
2.0,Very flat with no curve to the face.
2.0,Not good quality...washed one time and pants seemed thin.  I like them...served a purpose for one night.
2.0,The dress was see-thru so I returned it.
2.0,"Was this dress worth $15? ... I guess.<br /><br />Look, I'd rather buy American and 100% cotton. But who can afford that right now? So I bought this dress. It's flimsy and cheaply made. It's not lined, but the design is cute and child-appropriate. I'm so tired of  companies making miniatures of adult patterns and trying to pass them off as children's clothes. I don't want my young daughters wearing micro shorts, deep V backless dresses, or the other crazy stuff you see in stores. I want classic children's clothes.<br /><br />This is a very cute, child appropriate dress. But, it's not cotton, the rainbows on the skirt were upside down on one of the dresses I ordered, and they're not lined. I won't say it's shoddy work (the stitches are straight, the flutter sleeves have not been sewn on lopsided), but just quick, cheap, and factory-made dress. But it's such a simple design, I think I'd rather use the $15 to buy cotton material and make my own dresses for them. Not buying these again."
2.0,"These glove may work right in the correct conditions, but not for me. If you get a drop of oil on these things and forget about it. Slicker than snot."
2.0,"Not made for anyone 5.5 or taller, extremely short torso!"
2.0,After weeks of waiting my bracelets finally arrived and the dream catcher bracelet was missing a feather.
2.0,"These were pretty terrible. They are a great size for a septum ring, but the balls fall out constantly. Even when you completely tighten them, within a few hours they fall out. I lost one of the balls within the first hour."
2.0,"The gaiter is soft and seems to be made well, but it does not fit me because it is too big for my face, so it keeps sliding down. I have to tighten the strap a lot for it to stay on but it is still very loose everywhere.<br />The filter pocket is very big and the filter is stiff and small so it falls to the bottom of the pocket when inserted, which made the filter sits below my mouth, no use for filtering any virus!<br />I may be able to make adjustment to it myself but found it too much trouble so I returned it.<br />It works better for my husband who has a larger face, even then the filter mechanism does not work for him either."
2.0,They don't stick too long and not comfortable
2.0,"The shirt was super cute and soft.  I really liked it.  I ordered it to wear to a Christmas Beer Dinner.  I am giving it 2 stars because it was soooooo small.  Had I realized it, I would not have ordered it.  Oh well, it looked great on my size small friend."
2.0,"I love Tevas and wear them all day every day wherever I go. I wear these shoes until the sole breaks and I feel ground under my feet. I even have a Teva tan on my feet. I bought this pair about two months ago and my heels and calves are in immense pain because of the shock pad. The shoe around the shock pad has lowered slowly while the shock pad has remained the same height, thus with every single step, my heel feels the shock pad. My left heel in particular is in pain because of this. I don't know what Teva was thinking with the shock pad, but they must not have realized that the shock pad does not shape itself to the foot, but that it remains stubbornly in the same position while the rest of the shoe takes shape around the foot. I will still buy Tevas, but never will I buy one that has the shock pad. It hurts my feet and lower legs far too much to be worth ANY money."
2.0,Ordered the largest size and it was still too small. Uhhhhh
2.0,I had ordered a small but the bust size was too big. I am a 32b so the small should've fit. Also the dress length was a bit under two feet; it was like a church dress.
2.0,"Weir fit in the crotch area. I know I have a big butt, but the fit was simultaneously too small up top, and too big on the bottom."
2.0,Pretty dress but way too big
2.0,This shirt fits like a child's shirt.
2.0,I purchased this for my Father for Christmas and the inside liner ripped. I feel like it should’ve lasted longer considering he takes care of his things. It’s a nice bag though and he does like it.
2.0,"While attempting to see if they fit my glasses, the lens portion fell off. Only held on by two plastic round 1/8th"" protrusions from the center frame. To put them back I simply pressed them back together. Wouldn't stay together very long, in my opinion."
2.0,"The picture definitely looks and fits better than what I received. The zipper on the costume starts just above the belly button and ends ~18 inches below there. For me, that meant the zipper went from around my belly button to just below my hips. Such an awkward fit because it's snug on your hips and really open and big on the bust line. The white ""furry"" part is pretty thin and not at all fluffy. The picture suggests that the hood is large and pretty--mine is not. It's narrow and not big enough hung strangely, so I couldn't use it to keep warm because it didn't come all the way to the front of my hairline. I'm 5'4"" and 123 lbs. I can usually fit anything and make it work.<br /><br />The boot covers would have been cute if they were made to stay on. They are fastened with flimsy ribbon that broke within an hour on one and a couple of hours on the other. I may be able to salvage those by adding a sturdier fastener.<br /><br />Summary: Buy something else. This item is a waste of your money and time."
2.0,"Had to sew the waist button on, hanging by a thread."
2.0,"The colors were pretty, but the dress runs really small.  I have had fairly good luck with ordering XXL dresses, and they had fit well, but this dress was very disappointing."
2.0,"product quality was BAD!!! shirt very bad quality and really not soft and not comfortable on my bady,..the worst thing,..that is TOO LARGE!!! i have sizing my body actual from the shirt chart..but what i got is too big?!! shame on you amazon!!! i really dissapointed!!!"
2.0,The beads and charm on this bracelet are very small.
2.0,This product looks nothing like the picture. It looks like houndstooth on this picture but what you receive is not this. The material is very thin. The top portion runs small. The only plus is its true to its length.
2.0,"Product runs big. I'm 5'4, 128lbs. and I'm swimming in the small. The quality of the material isn't so bad but there is no form to the garment. Very frumpy."
2.0,really small. gave them away
2.0,"Very disappointed as it was an Easter present for my 10 yr old. It did not work from the moment we received it, wouldn't wind or keep the time. Within a week, the band broke off. I didn't give it 1 star because my daughter loves anything Paris themed and the Eiffel tower design was cute which she enjoyed. Definitely get what you pay for."
2.0,It isn't a silky fabric. It's very thin t shirt fabric. Wasn't happy with the quality.
2.0,Great concept but not Functional in the real world of concrete sidewalks and asphalt the connection severed between the pad on the bottom and the one that would touch my foot within three weeks at most
2.0,This was much smaller than the measurements listed
2.0,total crap
2.0,Way small. Size up. But even then.. material is not soft. I could make a better printing.
2.0,Im size 8 ordered 8.The fit for the size is good. The calf is small. Couldn't pull them up. Disappointed. Returning and have to pay shipping and restocking fee.
2.0,"It’s a nice color and cute style, but insanely short. I am only about 5”1 and it barely covered my butt."
2.0,I really loved this but it only lasted a couple weeks before it broke. It stopped connecting to my watch all together
2.0,"The glasses look great, but the fit is bad. I have a larger face and the frames were to big. I am not sure if that was the design or if the pair I received were defective. If the sunglasses fit correctly I would have given 2 more stars."
2.0,"This shirt was very soft.  I wanted to like them.  However, out of the four pack, two were smaller than the others.  Also, with this shirt the bottom, around my hips, was too tight whereas the chest was too big.  Normally I have the opposite problem - the chest is too tight and the bottom too baggy."
2.0,Comfortable but look cheap
2.0,"The bag is already falling apart. The zip’s in the front are not zipping right, they unzip is the middle of the zipper."
2.0,This is super cute but I only wore and washed it twice before it started falling apart and fading 😟 sad because I really liked it
2.0,"I love the style of the dress but it doesn't fit right around the hips, I'm 5'2 105lbs. It is also a little longer that pictures (but I'm short) I didn't return it because I want to see if a seamstress can make it work."
2.0,"It fits great, even on my 8 month-pregnant belly, but the fabric is super cheap and thin (think bathing suit material...ew). I’m returning."
2.0,I LOVE THE OUTFIT BUT VERY UPSET I WAITED ALMOST 2 months for a misprinted shirt!! Like For Real
2.0,"Runs small. Very thin material. Cheap product, I would not order again."
2.0,"Returned. Ordered up, and it just clings to every part of your body. Not flattering."
2.0,Cheap and cheap looking
2.0,The heating elements in the chest are were not getting warm.
2.0,These are completely see through!!!
2.0,I have to take it to a jeweler in get the band opened! Five folks could not get it unlocked.<br />May return it if unsuccessful or too expensive.. I like appearance of it......
2.0,"Purchased for my recent Mt. Fuji summit. The design was super cute but if you have a small head it won’t stay up over your nose. Mine spent the trip around my neck. When I was able to get it to stay up (I planned to use it for the dust on decent) it was hard to breath through and not because of altitude. Cool product, just not if you plan to breath through it."
2.0,Chain broke second day
2.0,"This bathing suit is very cute, but made for skinny,skinny bodies. The top is very small. The XL  TOP FITS a ' A cup! The extra large bottom fits a size 8 butt! Too small"
2.0,"The material was very cheap looking.  It wasn’t just too tight, I literally couldn’t get it over my head.  The tag was ripped out of the inside and the bag it came in didn’t have a size listed which makes me think it was the wrong size.  It might have been cute if it fit but I will never know."
2.0,"I ordered these thinking there were cute, but there way to big and cheap. Fell apart as soon as i pulled them out of the bag.Tried to send them back but they wanted me to pay $6.00 dollars for shipping.."
2.0,"These do not wash, all the paint comes off.  Don't use these on anything that will be washed."
2.0,"Awkward fit, and it doesn't wash very well."
2.0,looked cheap and the fit wasn't like the model in the pic.
2.0,"At first I was reasonably happy with this wallet, but with use it has begun oozing some sort of adhesive from the joint inside the card holders all over my credit cards. I would not recommend this product."
2.0,"I thought going for a larger size would help with what looked like chiffon material. But it was just long. It's like the they kept the same size but just added material at the end to make it ""one size up"""
2.0,El top no aprieta lo suficiente en la parte baja.
2.0,Looks nothing like the picture..same pattern but style is not the same. I returned it and got my money back
2.0,I have a size 9 foot and bought size 10 per review suggestions and they are still too small.  Their sizing is horribly off. I would go 1.5 or even 2 sizes bigger than you would normally.
2.0,It is easy to install and it is comfortable and super cute however I have only worn this strap for a week and twice now it has came inclasped and fell off of my wrist. Poor quality 😢
2.0,"Typically I wear a medium, but go with a large for extra sleeve length. This shirt is TIGHT in a large. Not to mention there is no shape to the shirt. The sleeves go past my elbows but not where near as long as the picture leads us to believe. I would recommend passing on this item."
2.0,"Awful cheap metal clips...absolutely no support. Material feels cheap. Sorry to say even for brunettes these were too loose, stretchy ..."
2.0,"Awkward fit.  I bought a Medium - 4’11”  145 lbs,<br />36C.  Too long (past the knees), and the pockets are too far down the dress…lucky my hands can reach it them.  I don’t think a size Small would be any better.  Just awkward."
2.0,The socks do run a little large.
2.0,This is so cute! And I've had it for about 3 months. But recently the strap fell off and I can't get it back on :(
2.0,2 stars because ring is a size small.. ordered size 10 but it's not an actual 10.. Should've ordered an 11
2.0,"Immediate return. This is more for a small or a medium, maybe a smedium. Definitely not anything past."
2.0,I painstakingly studied and looked and eye measured...lol...<br />anyways it broke. too small. had to return sadly.  : (
2.0,"These parts are very very light for cargo pants,  my pajamas are heavier than these.  Otherwise I like the style.....s<br />Runs abit small."
2.0,"I pulled the shirt out of the bag and there were obvious dirty fingerprints on the front of the shirt (see picture). They did not brush off like it was just dust. I wear a lot of merino and this is definitely not the softest out there - a little scratchy. It is also very short waisted so for taller people (I'm 5'6"" and wear a M) who want their shirt to cover the top of their pants, this is not the shirt for you! Great price at $30 but also not a keeper when it comes dirty, is scratchy and runs short/small Returning."
2.0,"These gloves are super soft and arrived very quick, they are a bit snug, I hope they stretch out.<br />I needed gloves for driving and to use daily, Colorado winter mornings are chilly, sadly they are not as warm as advertised.<br />No worries, I’ll use them for the spring time."
2.0,I got my normal size and it definitely did not look like the picture. The front knot came up to my belly button and it was tight fitting. I guess you would have to size up 2 sizes of you want it to look like the picture. Very disappointing :(
2.0,This is literally a piece of cloth that will not stay place nor will it cover much
2.0,The battery life was extremely short - got frustrated after a month of giving these gloves a chance - finally decided to return them.
2.0,"Cute shirt, but it doesn't fit well on well-endowed women.  The bust was too tight and I had to send it back."
2.0,"Arrived on time I gave 2 star only because its super cute however I think it is over priced the quality is extremely cheap the towel is see through, the oven mit is also very thin and the ink on the images were smeared on certain areas look at images would NOT RECOMMEND I am even scared to use and have to wash so for the time being these will be only for decorations"
2.0,"It looks heavier in the picture, however the material is quite thin. The fit is a tad bit on the small size, if you want baggy definitely order a size up. It honestly looks like a cheap, medium-sized dog throw blanket. Definitely overpriced."
2.0,Was very suprised in the size. I chose youth and the flower was the size of my palm. The necklace part was so long I was surprised it didn't go to her knees. It only lasted 2 days before another kid ripped off all the outer pedals. But the color is beautiful and it feels thick.
2.0,"Not designed for ladies with hips!  Fits everywhere else for the most part. The color is beautiful, I got mine in blue."
2.0,"They pilled like crazy, even before I washed them.  Will not buy this brand again."
2.0,The picture is bigger than the earrings you get. Almost need magnifying glass to see. They come in plastic bag in box. Big disappointment. A good price would be ten to fifteen dollars not sixty.  They might have to go back. The more I think about it the more upset I get.
2.0,These dont really do anything
2.0,Not what I expected. The material looks &#34;cheap&#34;. Disappointing.
2.0,When they spandex it’s clear and I can see my skin through the pants
2.0,"Beautiful frames, came with all the kit and look genuine, I bought 6 different pairs of Mont Blanc the 675 being one.<br />After 3 months the rubber started to peel away from the underside of the frame.<br />I contacted the seller and was told ""There is no warranty on frames"" I should buy another frame and they'd give me $10 discount.<br />Poor customer service and $10 discount a joke.<br />No warranty on a Mont Blanc product makes me question authenticity.<br /><br />Would I recommend "" Watchsavings "" or purchase from them again?  -  No."
2.0,"These are really pretty and I loved them when I saw them.  I was happy that I could wear larger hoop earrings again.  I wore them and my earring holes began to get irritated.  The issue is not the metal. It's the design of the stem.  Rather than making these with a thin round stem (like many other earrings we are used to seeing), these are made with a stem that is flat and wide.  It tore my earring holes apart, hurt like crazy, and took weeks to heal.  I'll probably pass them along as a gift to someone with earring holes that are larger."
2.0,The fabric is stiff and uncomfortable
2.0,Bracelet is too long. Chain is OK. Nice shine but a bit smaller than I'd hoped.
2.0,"This was for a 17 year old and it was wayyy to small, beads the size of a pin head.  I felt as if it were going to break just trying it on. Also if you wear it with other bracelets you won’t be able to see it because it’s sooo small."
2.0,"I ordered this dress in &#34;beige&#34; for my engagement photos. I love the fit and that it has long sleeves, but... The color isn't at all what I was expecting--it's more of a soft yellow in person. Would have given five stars otherwise.  I won't be wearing it for my photos and only have a few days to find a replacement. :("
2.0,"I expected thin and cheap fabric, but this is terribly rough. Like burlap."
2.0,croked. Cannot get it to fit correctly.
2.0,Only two matched the photo. The other four were not expected patterns.
2.0,"Was only presentable for one season. Very heavy pilling occurred after just a few weeks. It is, however, warm and comfortable."
2.0,"More of a straight skirt than a flared a-line like it shows in the photo.<br />The material id a cheap scratchy tshirt material with a light amount of stretch. The front tie adds a nice cinch at leadt, but it just looks like a long tank top with a weird front tie. Not particularly flattering."
2.0,I tried it on and one of the butterflies caught on my sock and broke off immediately. I was able to reattach it. I will save it for summer and flip flop weather. These are not to be worn in winter sock weather. I do wonder about quality though if it broke immediately just trying it on!
2.0,"It is pretty but it is cheap. For the price I paid I expect it to look the same. The pieces in the middle are cheap plastic that are shiney and pretty and do change to different colors but they aren't put on right, I know I will have some fall off soon and have to fix it. It is way to light for what it is which makes it even cheaper made. Also the chain used to put the pieces together and clasp the necklace in the back is the brassy cheap kind that feels like plastic. So dissapointed and might actually return this. And I don't usually bother returning."
2.0,"MUCH TO SMALL!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!<br />SIZE CHART NOT FOR AMERICAN BUYERS... AMAZON SHOULD STATE IF SELLERS ARE FOREIGN OR AMERICAN.<br />I LOVE THE COLOR, AND STYLE. I WISH SIZE CHART WAS ACCURATE."
2.0,"Sleeves were loose as well as upper back. Bust and waist fit fine. Overall an odd and ugly fit.  Thin, cheap material. Two stars for the nice floral pattern and pockets."
2.0,Cheap material and poorly made. It’s also very shiny
2.0,This bracelet is very cheap looking and the craftsmanship is poor.
2.0,The material is thin and looks cheap.  I am a size large/size 12 and ordered it in an XL . I wanted a loose fit like the picture and it still did not fit like I wanted. It is cut straight and therefore tight around the hips.  I am returning it
2.0,"Too tight, bad fastener"
2.0,"Cheap, but I didn’t expect much at this price.  My son is a huge fan."
2.0,"Kept the sandals since they were such a low price. The gold color looks nice. The strap over the arch is really large, therefore my feet want to slide forward."
2.0,One strand of beads is missing in the very center of the bottom row.<br />Can I get a replacement?
2.0,Very Small! Ordered regular size and it was way too small.
2.0,"The strap broke early into its second use. It was lightly used at both events, carrying a women's wallet and not much else. It's not made very well."
2.0,"It's ok. The shoulder straps are awkwardly attached I guess.  The bag tends to lean away from you when wearing it.  The belt should maybe attached high up on the bag.  I've had it for awhile, and tried to several times, but it's just awkward.  I'll probably try modifying it to see it it fits better.  As is- I wouldn't buy it again."
2.0,"Too small, tiny infact!"
2.0,"The wood pieces started falling of the band within 3 days, poorly made. The look of the watch is fine but the quality of the product is poor."
2.0,"These headbands are cute, but do not hold any amount of sweat, at all. It's actually worse than not wearing anything."
2.0,Size isn’t true. It’s hard finding these for larger chest. DDD. Doesn’t stick well.
2.0,I wore the earrings one day and the gold started to corrode. They were beautiful though.
2.0,These pants are so cute and comfortable but do not hold your waist in at all.  I would say they only flattering if you have a very flat stomach.  They do make your booty look good though.
2.0,"Products delivered are very different what is shown in the pictures.  Quality is OK but designs totally differents.  I expected to received very similar to the pictures I saw at the moment of purchasing,"
2.0,Mine didn’t come with a pull tab and won’t light at all
2.0,"This shirt is very tight. Too tight on the arms and way too short. I wanted to love it because it is so cute, but it's a little see through and very small. I even ordered a size up, but that wasn't enough."
2.0,"Cheap looking. You get what you pay for, I guess.<br />Not delicate as it appears in the picture."
2.0,This dress is very thin.
2.0,Not a dangling ball glass bead like I expected.  They are rounded in front but have a flat black back.
2.0,"Its Ok I guess. I just don't like that it got rusty really fast. Probably  the same day or week I got it. I don't remember , but I hadn't even put it near water."
2.0,The thread at the collar was white instead of brown as pictured. Will be returning.
2.0,"These are nice enough beads inasmuch as they fit together nicely. They are just different from the ones I already own.  The original  beads came from my mother and are small, somewhat glossy and the color is more like a nice string of pearls.  These probably date back to the 50s.  I was hoping the new ones would be more like those.  However, they are  very,very white, dull finish  and a little on the large size ..... perhaps better suited for older children to play with."
2.0,Very snug. Barely fits my 4 & 7 year olds.
2.0,I won’t buy them again.
2.0,"Nice if you like the feel of a hospital gown. The colors and patterns are still nice though, even after the wash."
2.0,Please do not buy this if you are looking for a nose ring..as it is too short to be worn as a nose-piece. i was very disappointed when I opened the box. very thin and small:(
2.0,"I ordered the beige color and the scarf is white. Not beige...probably as white as white can be. I will say that the material feels nice and looks good to wear, but when I order a color I expect it to come in the color that is provided."
2.0,"My daughter really loved the look of the bag, but it got scuffed up pretty easily & after a month or two, one of the straps just fell apart at the upper seam. Had to go buy another bag for her. Very disappointing quality."
2.0,"I liked these. I wasn't expecting them to come with a case, which was a nice bonus.  However, they were very ridged and I felt like there were going to crack from the first time I put them on.  They eventually did only after a few weeks of use.  I was still within the return window, so I sent them back."
2.0,"For most clothes I wear large and they are comfortable a little loose, where mediums are a little tight.<br /><br />The cut of these is nice, i.e. nicely short, but they are also equivalent to a small medium.  Which would not be TOO bad, but this material is stiff and thick.  So very binding to swim or even walk, bunch up strangely and just don't work.<br /><br />Bummer because I like that there is at least ONE manufacturer that realizes not everyone likes ""shorts"" down to my ankles, yet not a ""speedo bikini"" and I hope this would trend more.<br /><br />Please keep up the work GM, but not on this particular item."
2.0,"The corgi is VERY CUTE. Unfortunately, the head/ears are so big that getting it on your existing key ring is impossible. It comes with it’s own keychain, but that one is now permanently bent from getting the corgi on it. I’m guessing that’s why they didn’t put it on the ring themselves. My other keys can not stay on it without falling off, nor can I attach the two key rings. So now I have a fairly useless bent ring with one key and another with the rest of my keys. The cover is also quite large and my key moves around under it so the corgi is often lopsided. Cute idea, just doesn’t work well."
2.0,"This is a cute hoodie, but the material is not good quality. EVERYTHING sticks to it and the material pills really bad after washing. If I had known this I would have not purchased this hoodie for my daughter. I did buy a size up to make sure it fit okay and it fits my daughter well."
2.0,You can see right through the material. They run a little smaller in size but not much and then tend to slip down off the butt.  The soft material makes them slip down often.
2.0,It was to be a gift for an elderly friend. The clips on the back hard to open and too small. A ninety year old woman could not handle it. I'll give two stars for the cameo design on the front that is nice.
2.0,It broke very easily.  I have purchased 3 so far and 2 broke.  The other is not being worn.
2.0,Bought as a ponytail holder bracelet and they don't work at all.  The grooves are too shallow
2.0,Just received and pretty disappointed. Not only did it reek of cigarette smoke right out of the package but it had a long unraveling string from the under arm seam. It was a cute fit but I’ll be returning it because it’s already falling apart.
2.0,"Although the set looked nice, the applique wasn't sewn on well, and was peeling up off the t-shirt. Buy this one with caution."
2.0,Crappy quality
2.0,It is a nice shirt but the neck is way too big. I will have to modify it so it can fit properly
2.0,Screw fell out and don't work now
2.0,Paint flaked off the facemask during shipping 🙁
2.0,"The quality is great, but, silly me, I expected &#34;newborn&#34; size to fit a newborn. It's enormous and there's no way I can take my baby home from the hospital in this onesie as I envisioned."
2.0,Lavender tone to the color.
2.0,The quality of the sweater is not great it's an iron on patch but the sweater is warm n comfy
2.0,Fell apart at several areas of the glove after about 4 weeks.  Not a worthwhile purchase.
2.0,"Not what expected , very dissatisfied! They don't look like the pic and just not what I expected! Too late to return them , but I'll give it to my son! 😞😞"
2.0,I typically wear a size 8/medium. I bought in a large and they are still a little smaller than I would like.
2.0,not a real shaper.
2.0,Product is nicely made and served its purpose but after wearing it for a few hours the straps starting scratching where the fabric is folded over and sewn for the back hooks since it has a coating to prevent unraveling. I ended up mid-Party taking it off because I had scratches! The hooks can only be undone on the back so I had no choice but to take it off. The straps were also not too tight and I even tried crossing them but it didn’t help.
2.0,"Material is comfy, but fit is awkward. The straps will not stay on my shoulders. The pads are very small and don't cover even half, but at least they're removable."
2.0,I don't like it very much...
2.0,I got this product a few months back and I currently only have one ear cuff left as the rest either snapped while I was tightening them to my ear or they fell off someplace because they didn't stay put. The one I still have I LOVE and I wear it all the time although it is slightly painful to put on. I ended up throwing away most of the earrings themselves due to the fact that they turned my ears green after 3 wears. The earrings also didn't have any matches. Overall I wasn't thrilled but you might have a better experience
2.0,webbing to slick
2.0,Too small. For kids
2.0,Poor quality after washing I had holes in all of them.
2.0,"Much lighter weight fabric than I was expecting, so it's very see through. I feel like I need a full slip under this. Beautiful design but pretty low quality."
2.0,"I normally wear a size 38 on all my shorts and pants, so I bought the XL and which has a 38-42 waistband. The problem is that the shorts themselves are size 38 while only the waistband expands from 38-42. They fit kinda snug and push my balls up too much, but maybe that’s because of my size. I’m 6’ 3” and 240 lb. The design and material are pretty great tho. If you order one, make sure the minimum on the waistband is at least a size bigger then normal if you want to fit comfortably."
2.0,"Looked down after a few days to realize I had lost a gem off the edge of the heart. A few days later the heart was gone, too. Kind of a drag when all it has to do is hang there."
2.0,Way too long and tight around the bust area
2.0,"Loved the material. The fabric feels nice and classy, but it does not fit well. I'm usually a small in size and so I ordered a small and it does not feel like a small to me. It was very loose at the waist area as well as the hem although the thigh area feels okay. I gave it to my sister who I would say wears medium and she also stated that the pant kept sliding down and she would have to constantly pull it up."
2.0,Pants are definitely xl in the length but not the pants. I am 5'9&#34; and they drag on the floor .
2.0,"Definitely agree that it runs small so take that into consideration when ordering. Also there is a slit in the middle at the bottom that you don't see in the picture. I have a long torso and didn't like the look, the sleeves were also a little short for me. I ended up returning it 😕"
2.0,"This not a product that I would buy. I am reviewing them for Vine Voice. First they are not really gold, The ear wire is made of surgical steel. There is no mention anywhere that states what the holiday dangles are made of. I found the ear wires difficult to insert in my ears  and once in the wires were straight out and poking the skin behind my earlobes. If I walked quickly or moved my head quickly the earrings fell out. I put plastic stoppers on all the ear wires and tried to bend them down a bit which didn't work well but at least the stoppers kept them in place. I was disappointed. Some of the dangles were huge and looked trashy. The smaller ones looked nice at least for looking at. I thought maybe I was missing something with these earrings so I brought them to my 40+ year old daughter's  house and asked her and my three granddaughters what they thought about earrings. No one liked them.  My daughter thinks the ear wire that is attached to the dangle is backwards and perhaps that is the problem. I came home wondering what to do with these and also with an earlobe that is really sore from trying to get the earring in my earlobe."
2.0,The dress was made of a great material but unfortunately way toon large.
2.0,Looked nice. But it is made very cheaply. The elastic band broke immediately before I put the pants on. The belt also broke after 2 hours of wearing it. Everyone told me that the shoes look like garbage bags. The stitching started coming apart at the seams after just one night. The hat is very small. The beard is trash. I had to buy a separate beard and wig.
2.0,I bought theirs jogger with the intention of running outdoors.  But I was so disappointed when I received it.  There was simply no way to wear it outdoors.  It's so soft that it was completely out of shape on the legs.  The shortcomings such as thick legs and curved legs were completely exposed.  The pocket was broken when I received.  Not recommended at all.
2.0,You get what you pay for.  Jacket construction is poor.
2.0,"For an inexpensive watch, this was still junk. The watch was covered in a  sticky film when it arrived. Looked very very very very cheap. I threw it in the trash."
2.0,"This is the right idea, and it works, but it's not that comfortable for me .  A smooth surface under my feet would be better  because I  have tender feet.  I guess I'm clucksy because I had a hard time getting each one to stay flat . It sticks to itself  while trying to place it in the sandal."
2.0,Arrived broken but my granddaughter did not want to give them up...so we could not send them back. They were really cute.
2.0,I like the style of this dress but it is very thin with excess fabric at the neckline. I bought the black and white polka dot one. Too thin fabric and certainly not suitable for the workplace.I'm disappointed in this.
2.0,Material is good but runs small I’m a 29 inch waist and these pull down I would recommend sizing up.
2.0,They are not at all comfortable.  And i Hiave a sit down job so not on my feet a lot during day time
2.0,the leather belt broke after only a year on wearing it.
2.0,very translucent and thin
2.0,I didn't even try this on because I was so disappointed pulling it out of the shipping bag.<br />Very obvious loose/sloppy stitching.<br />Stripes are uneven at neckline.<br />Cheap looking and feeling fabric.<br />I ordered a medium and it appeared true to size. Sadly that's the only positive thing I can say about this top.
2.0,Love the color but run smaller than the solid colors!!
2.0,"I love the color and so far watch is working.  Just wish I could wear it.  The smell of the band is extremely nauseating!  I've cleaned it with multiple things and the smell will not go away.  I am giving it a week to ""air"" then sending it back."
2.0,"We used these for two nights.  That's about all most of them would hold up.  8&9year olds wore them.  Some tore at the seams, they definetly stretched out quite a bit.  If purchasing, understand not durable."
2.0,Everything is perfect except is not a real opal stone.
2.0,"2 stars for the digital pattern on the out side.<br />Minus 3 stars because the inside is &#34;White&#34;. There is no way to wear this that the white inside doesn't get exposed as you move around.<br />In the last two months I've purchased 15 Chinese knockoff buffs from Amazon, this is the only one with a white reverse color."
2.0,"Very flimsy and cheap material. After two washings, I already have a hole in one of the pockets."
2.0,"Humongous. The small fit like a large, and it is so see-through that you could read a book through it. Also there is no shape to it."
2.0,"My daughter said she liked it, but I thought it looked a little cheap. I guess she'll wear it, not sure."
2.0,"It's cute. But it's really cheap and a lot longer than I expected. It comes down to the chest area, not around the neck."
2.0,The bill is really long. Wasn't what I wanted but gave to my mom.
2.0,Doesn't look anything like in the picture and the size doesn't match. I'm European and I'm used to the European sizes and they are way bigger than they should be.
2.0,Cheaply made and not worth $25.  The pockets are not sewn in so it looks weird when you put your hands in them. The shoulder seam is low as if it had short sleeves and then the long sleeves were sewn on later.  Just sloppy looking .
2.0,"Love these, but, they were missing a button when received."
2.0,"No me gustó, la simetría de las medidas es cero proporcional a la simetría real de un bebé."
2.0,"It's pretty, but it's plastic."
2.0,"I got a 3xl and it fits like an XL I will not send it back cause my other kid can use it! But it runs very small!! The quality of the material looks good not cheap, but the mask smells awful! I'll air it out before Halloween!"
2.0,"The problem with these pants is the bottom of the legs flare out way too much. I mean they look like 70's bell bottoms. Now, I know pants are supposed to flare out on the bottom to fit over mountaineering boots. I'm talking way more than necessary though. Also, the built-in gaiters are flimsy and useless."
2.0,Nightgown is NOT cotton and NOT flannel
2.0,Material soft and nice but see through
2.0,Smaller than I’d hoped
2.0,"For the price, items quality were OK. But two of the masks arrived with damages. One of the items were ripped in multiple places on one side. And another mask arrived with the string missing. I understand the price was cheap but quality control should never be comprised. The pictures for the products did not show any defects and for that reason they will receive two stars instead of four. I had to keep the item and use the ones that were still good because there not enough time to exchange."
2.0,"Bigger than i thought it was going to be, but still cute."
2.0,"The small isnt for someone with a slim build that needs a slim fitting shirt, also strands on the button holes get caught around the button so not easy to unbutton, cool pattern and the buttons look cool"
2.0,"I collect novelty replicas from certain anime's I like.  As a collector I was very disappointed to see that the tape had been placed over the front of the case. When I opened it, the front of the case pretty much tore off as did the lettering on the side. The material the its were made out of is very cheap. For these reasons I had to give only 2 stars."
2.0,"Not what I expected but that was partially my fault. Really look at the pictures provided and the reviews. I'm not a fan of these but they are cute just not ment for bigger people.  They look like a napkin or handkerchief on my face lol again cute print,  love how it's breathable but hate the cut and design. Honestly never even wore it outside my home. I ended up giving them away and I found out they don't even use it. I'm just glad I only paid $3 for this"
2.0,The arms were extremely to small on the dress for a XXL. I had to return the dress.
2.0,Fit is not accurate at all and in my opinion much shorter than the picture.  It just wasn't appealing to me as in the picture.  Customer service appeared to be great and provided me with a quick and no hassle refund.
2.0,"Runs small not true to size, need to buy 2 sizes up"
2.0,"Purchased for COVID use vs a standard face mask. Too thin, unfinished edges (I did see photo representing this after purchasing) and too big. Stays up for my husband but not on me."
2.0,The soul of the shoe was pretty sturdy but the flower fell off within one day.  They are definitely a little smaller than expected I would go up about a half size other than the flower fallong off I think they're really cute
2.0,The earring was to thick for my nose piercing
2.0,This shirt might fit a baby. MIGHT. I am returning it immediately. I was also not paying attention when I bought it - listed under prime so you pay for the shipping too.
2.0,It fit fine - I didnt like how the front was higher in the middle and that was hard to tell from the picture.
2.0,Cute but runs small. Wish they had fit my daughter.
2.0,I normally wear between size 4-6 and I got the S/M. I put them on a week after my csection and literally could not breath they were so tight. So I waited and I am now 3 weeks post partum and they are just now starting to fit. But the top of them is still so tight that it squeezes my rib cage and is very uncomfortable
2.0,No good keep your money
2.0,"The product was supposed to be magnetic but it wasn’t. The bracelets were fair,y attractive but they did not perform as described by the seller. Plan to return."
2.0,"The hat came in inside a very small plastic bag squished and wrinkled. Packaging need to be in a box to avoid the material from being quashed. For the price the hut is good, I give this product two stars."
2.0,They are cute but not comfortable at all
2.0,"Zippers not quality made.  You have to work at zipping some of those pockets up.<br />Velcro on the sleeves won't stay attached at all,  cheap quality."
2.0,"Was really looking forward to these but they were too big and not like oh these are a bit long, they were baggy everywhere and too long. I ordered true to size so it wasn't like I was having some sort of body dysmorphic ordering spree.  They'd probably be nice if they actually fit though and since I live out in the boondocks it's not worth returning so I'm just out some money."
2.0,I did not realize the neckline was so wide. It barely fit on my shoulders. The crinoline skirt was too puffy and I did not like the feel of the fabric overall. Returned it the next day.
2.0,Such a cute dress. Material was nice but this was WAY too small. I'm a 4-6 and I couldn't even get this over my shoulders.  Wish I could exchange it for aarge but no more in stock.  Going back
2.0,The scarf much smaller than it's shown in the picture.
2.0,makes you look fat....sorry
2.0,Didnt work for me sent it back. A little bigger than expected. The print wasn’t what I thought either
2.0,does not auto close. feels flimsy. will return
2.0,I absolutely loved this belt when I first got it. I still do except for the fact that the buckle (ratchet?) falls off every time you open the belt. It worked great when I first got it but it's a real annoyance now. If they could fix that problem this would be the only type of belt I would wear.
2.0,"This is an almost cute dress. Fits nicely. Perfect stretch. However, the flower pattern/ design on this dress is just bizarre and awful. Makes the dress look like it was taken from old school Mario kart Wii (not in a good way)."
2.0,The first set was lost by the USPS but they were nice enough to send a second set. The penny came off the post within a couple of days and then the second earring did the same thing. We super glued them so hopefully that holds them together.
2.0,"For me, the screw backs are impossible. Are tiny and hard to get on and screw in. Tried another back, but of course it doesn't fit. Have stopped trying to wear them. I don't like earrings that I have to fuss with"
2.0,I misunderstood and thought the material would be much more stretchy. It was way to small and I bought a size larger than I normally wear.
2.0,"I normally wear a large, ordered a 2X and it’s still too small. Material is weird and shrinks a lot when washed"
2.0,Pay for what ya get. But it works.
2.0,"It's obviously meant to be baggy, but i really don't think you don't need to order any bigger than usual to get the off shoulder look.<br />I would love this if it was actually gray, as the cuffs are.  but the sweater is like a khaki color. It's weird looking, almost old and worn, but not in any good way. Maybe the other colors are more consistent."
2.0,They are a size small
2.0,Runs big. Very see through. Would have to wear a slip underneath.
2.0,Way too big for a guy
2.0,"product looked nice, but the outer braided straps would hide under my watch. leather was also itchy on my skin but I do have sensitive skin so that is not the products fault, just a heads up for other sensitive skin ppl out there."
2.0,"Necklace is more of a blue black color instead of the silver as pictured, same weight of a small keychain"
2.0,"Super cute and fits as expected but my very NOT active teen, after only a handful of wears, already had the checker area fading and multiple rips with no impact or obvious cause."
2.0,It is really cute but....I got what I paid for.  Zipper broke before the trip.  Used a luggage strap to be sure it didn't open while going through the airport.  Can really only be used as a carry on ... I would be concerned even with a gate check!  Use is for car travel and enjoy its cuteness.
2.0,I don't think mine had fleece.
2.0,"The earrings are beautiful but the clasp was so smashed together when I recieved it  that I couldn't  even lock the earring in place. After messing with it, I was able to pull it apart and chippped my nail :-("
2.0,I ordered an XL for a size 16. It was to small
2.0,It's pretty but the color looks very rusty and disclosed.
2.0,Ive only had the necklace for a couple months n the key is almost completely tarnished! Very disappointed!!! Otherwise the piece itself is beautiful. I wouldn't regret buying it if it wasn't for it tarnishing so quickly!
2.0,I wanted a smaller size. Tighter fit on my head. It’s reall huge.
2.0,"Este artículo tiene el defecto que la talla es pequeña., en la descripción aparece para hombre y mujeres, pero para los hombres es pequeña, la nariz se sale cuando se acomida en la barbilla.."
2.0,"I recieved all four rings,  but only two were serviceable.  The two grey rings were cut/cracked and would have ripped off during wear.  The black and white rings were the only ones that were usable.  So two rings = two stars which is probably more than it deserves."
2.0,"these were silly,  the lens popped out."
2.0,Thus dress is see through! :(
2.0,loved the suit. the bra made me look like Madonna on stage. had to return it
2.0,Disappointed with the fit. Have bought other coach shoes. in this size and those are the most comfortable shoes I own. The fit with these is very different from the others.
2.0,These fit correctly I'm 5-5 145lbs. If you do yoga or workout these are not what you're looking for. The tummy panel isn't sewn in correctly it is uncomfortable and has a inch wide piece of elastic at the top that is very unflattering. The only reason they look like they holding the girl's stomach in the picture is because she is extremely toned.<br />If you're looking for a nice comfortable yoga pants these aren't it. They are pretty cheaply made also when I can get Champion or RBX for this price or less.
2.0,I ordered 2 sizes up and it barely fits how it should. No give when putting it on so hopefully after washing it doesn’t shrink so much I can’t get it on to wear it
2.0,This dress is too thin. Cheaply made. It came with threads hanging loose.
2.0,"Love the product -  not happy with the service. First, I received the wrong size. I sent it back and my replacement was the right size, but wrong color. Very disappointed."
2.0,Adorable but Turned copper after a few wears
2.0,necklace is too tight.  Can not wear it!
2.0,A reasonable looking dress.  But something is wrong with how the cape is attached so it fits oddly.  And the sizing is a bit off so the dress has all kinds of bunches all over.  I will have to have it adjusted.
2.0,"Too smal, very good idea.  But too small when you have a lot of keys or if you have just a few keuys that are large"
2.0,"Expensive, for single pair of socks."
2.0,Description said that it had a wide band...well it didn't.  This was too tight on my head (and no i don't have an extra large head) I really wasn't all that impress with this product.  I could have gotten this same thing at my local beauty supply store.
2.0,The shirt was a little bit stiff and had a weird smell I laundered it and it is not a fabric I would recommend stiff and scratchy would not buy again
2.0,The necklace was a joke and Broke within me putting it on
2.0,"I really had high hopes for these Puma’s Safety shoes. I am a manager of a crane company. Mostly in the office but help out in the yard and warehouse a few times a week briefly each time. Rules are gloves, hard hat, and protective footwear with approved safety toes. I’m in Florida and these looked cool and light to wear all day. Well they are cool and well ventilated but just not comfortable for me. The only issue with comfort is the way they flex when you walk. Where they bend the protective toe cap pinches the top of my toes and foot. So much so it is distractingly uncomfortable. I tried Timerberland Pro and Keen so far and these Pumas. Best out of the three? ........ Timberland Pros, hands (or feet) down. If these don’t break in to a more comfortable day soon, the will get shelved and I will order another pair of Timberland Pros.  Honest as can be. Loved my Puma soccer shoes back years ago but not these work shoes.<br />  The good is, they are good looking, and Puma sent two pairs of contrasting laces. Nice touch. Also they came from a Puma distribution center near Atlanta I believe and they initially sent me an ankle height pair of work boots by Puma. I contacted the about sending the wrong shoes and the made a quick correcting exchange with a prepaid return label and good email communication. I wear a 13 W or 14 W.  Many reviews said they run large so I went with the 13W’s. I don’t think, at least in this instance, that size would have mattered. 😃.  Anyways, that’s my two cents.  Stay safe and wear comfortable shoes 👟"
2.0,The medium size would not even get past my knees. I do not carry a lot of weight in my legs. These did it have a good stretch or fit.
2.0,"Fabric and construction seemed good, but it was way too short-waisted. I'm 5'8, 115lbs, usually an XS in US sizes and bought a medium."
2.0,I'm 5'7 and these pajama pants are about 4 inches from reaching my ankle...too short!
2.0,This top just fits weird.
2.0,The colors in this pair of earrings was not as I expected. No where as bright as the pictures showed. They actually looked a little old but was too busy to go thru the process of returning them.
2.0,Ordered an extra large.  Still to small.
2.0,"These look great but the fact of the matter is that the lenses were just too small.  Probably about 38mm.  The description did not have the size of the lense and I mistakenly thought they would be more like 52 mm.  They might be good glasses, but the ad needs to let folks know that these are small lenses!"
2.0,"I’ve always only bought items with a lot of reviews because I’m always hesitant of something going “wrong.” Well, it didn’t go “wrong” but I’m not even sure what I received. I’m a size 0/2 and this dress was more like a size 4. Also, the ties came down almost to my belly button meaning the low cut portion was no kind of revealing, it was the “v” came down to almost my belly button. The feel is like sandpaper. Maybe I just received a bad batch, idk but beware. Looks really cute in the pictures and the girl above that reviewed it but I’d say if you’re skinny or small or small chested, this dress is not for you."
2.0,followed the size chart but really small
2.0,Body wise fit Lg but arms too small and had a tear in it at seem. Took forever to receive China. Would not recommend buying this
2.0,"Very thin Unforgiving fabric that shows every lump, bump and roll I have.  Would not recommend for plus sized women with the same type issues as me."
2.0,Ordered this dress for my daughter’s prom . She tried on and the right shoulder starting to loose its sewing . Didn’t get a chance to replace the item because of out of order on this color and size . Have to saw the shoulder and pray that she won’t finished naked at her prom.
2.0,The neck strap was too short so the penis part is almost at my chest lol. Other than that the quality is pretty good for the price I paid. Wouldn’t buy it again sorry.
2.0,"I opened it and it had the diamonds glued on top of each other,the things just a mess."
2.0,Wasn’t cut out all the way in some parts
2.0,Not the quality expected. Chain was very thin and pvc material not stiff (thick). The clasp in the front was also offset making tricky to close the flap. Returned.
2.0,Cute boots but name sign fell off after a week. Gets recognized but flimsy in quality.
2.0,About 2 sizes smaller than advertised
2.0,Material is super stretchy doesn’t look like picture.
2.0,"I ordered an A3 white and A3 blue gi. The white gi arrived half out of the package, unfolded, worn, stained, and dirty. The blue gi arrived new in package."
2.0,"These suck, edges are to thick even after three pairs of tights. So disappointed."
2.0,I really wanted to like this. The material is pretty and I like the design of it. However it's super big. I felt like I was wearing a cute poncho.  I'll be returning it unfortunately.
2.0,Not what I expected at all. I'm little disappointed.
2.0,These run very small.
2.0,"Absolutely no support and runs a bit small in the cups, but I understand that size H is rare to come by especially online.<br /><br />Says high impact but that’s a complete lie. These offer no support and the straps aren’t adjustable.<br /><br />Nice design and comfortable material, but useless for me."
2.0,"The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the Large was way too small.  I have dementia and forgot (I should have checked past orders) that I had ordered this before in a Large and it was too small.  I am going to re-order in XX Large and hope that it will fit.  If not, I'll just have to pass on another re-order."
2.0,"I need a different nosepiece and none were included. I emailed MIGAGA, but they had some weird reply about not being responsible for that??"
2.0,Very hard to keep in place continues to shift and move can't tell what it is
2.0,"This is my third product from fair indigo, and the first that doesn’t fit well. I love the stripes, and cut. But the large was too big! My other dress and shirt from this company fit great so not sure what happened on this one."
2.0,Style is bad
2.0,"Super cute, but sizing is way off.  Order at least one size up."
2.0,Broke after 2 weeks of normal wear. My 7 year old loved them while they lasted.
2.0,This necklace broke after 2 days.  BEWARE
2.0,The frames were very thin.
2.0,Sent first one in because it broke the first day wearing it and so did the second one Beautiful but not worth it
2.0,"I ordered “M” and ended up getting an M & aW. These were for my wedding. Nice product, if it was correct."
2.0,Nice looking coat but I wore it twice and the zipper broke.
2.0,I'm a 34 B- and it's not comfortable for some reason.  Plus I felt like it's too small...
2.0,I wasn’t to impressed with the quality but for the price they are not bad. It keeps opening in my pocket.
2.0,"This dress is adorable but did not fit my body type. I have large arms and chest while smaller in the hips and butt so it flowed nicely from the waist down, but was too snug on top to move my arms. My husband said it looked fine, but I felt constricted so I returned."
2.0,"The stone is too big and looks fake.  Overall product looks cheap, but considering the cost, guess it's okay for the money.  Can't see myself wearing this much."
2.0,I love oversized sweaters but this one Is way too big it’s boxy and just does not hang well at all . I normally wear a small and that’s what I ordered . But I’m not sure even an extra small would work
2.0,"I followed the reviews and the chest was way too small, but the rest fit well. The hooks were missing to close the piece that goes around the back of your neck. The color is beautiful though."
2.0,"enamel chips away, doesnt last long"
2.0,"This dress fit well and was super cute the first time I wore it. It got really dingy and faded after one wash. So yeah, if you want a one day dress go for it. I prefer my clothes to at least last the season."
2.0,"The material is shiny, which was surprising. Not a fan. And, they're a tad short. I'm only 5'4"" and they are above my ankle, which I'm not liking. Just overall, not what I expected based on reviews and pics."
2.0,No third zipper pocket as stated... disappointed.
2.0,This dress was not at all as I expected it to be. It was very thin and cheaply made. It was really long on me and not flattering at all. I am 5’1” 34-27-37 and the small was too large.
2.0,The fit is fine but very thin material.  I have holes in the butt area after two months of minimal use.
2.0,"These do not look they are made very well, look cheaply made."
2.0,"WHAT I LIKED WAS THE COLOR.WHAT I DISLIKED WAS THE FOLLOWING  ;  (1). THE BOX WITH THE MERCHANDISE<br />WAS CRUSHED,LOOKED AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN RUN OVER SEVERAL TIMES,BUT THANK GOODNESS THE ITEMS<br />WERE NOT HARMED. (2). THOUGH THE COLOR WAS ON POINT THE MASK THEMSELVES ARE VERY,VERY THIN<br />MEANING YOU CAN HOLD THEM UP TO THE LIGHT AND ACTUALLY SEE THROUGH THEM. BUT PUSH COME TO<br />SHOVE,THEY ARE GOOD IN A PINCH."
2.0,"the colour was a bit purplish rather than sapphire blue, it did not match the earrings (which is blue like it is supposed to be)"
2.0,"Pretty but the clasp doesn't work, so I am disappointed."
2.0,Came with a defect on the fabric and my daughter needed it now.
2.0,Didn’t even try it on. Not hair with the color. I’m sending it back
2.0,"Whatever your size, get one or two sizes larger.  I got the large for someone who wears medium and yet it would not fit her at all.  It is more like a child's large."
2.0,do not fit very small.
2.0,"I don't like the color. However the fit is good. I'm 5ft 5in, weight 160 -170. Fits a bit snug when I'm at 170, fits comfortably when I'm at 160 to 165"
2.0,"NO RETURNS ELIGIBLE for this item, so beware! I thought that ALL Prime items were. It almost took a screwdriver to open this thing also."
2.0,They did not fit my 9 year olds face. They are baggy and fall down constantly. There is also no nose grip so there a big gap at the top.
2.0,Hole in the seam showed up after the first time wearing. Thin material. Not super pleased.
2.0,This wasn’t very cute like the pictures. It looks like a plain black t shirt.
2.0,Ordered 2 pairs bot ripped
2.0,Way too big order a size down!
2.0,Ordered half size larger than I normally wear and they were still too small.  Stiff and uncomfortable out of the box.  I returned these.
2.0,It’s not stretchy material
2.0,This dress was very oversized. I ordered a small and it fit like a large. The fabric was very heavy and it hung like a curtain. Not very flattering and ultimately decided to return dress
2.0,Had it for about 2 months and the clips broke off and ended up buying a better quality one. It was cheap and I got my money worth I suppose.
2.0,Supposed to be a large. Maybe a girls small not men's large.
2.0,"The blouse is beautiful and I got lucky to get one in a large but there was NO WAY to choose the size on ***zon.  When I posted 3 size questions to the board, no one replied.  Pretty, but don't take your chances with clothing online when no one can answer a simple size question."
2.0,Thinner than expected- I like it but the wrinkles won’t come out no matter how long I soak it in water and line dry.
2.0,Se ve bonito...la tela se ve diferente ala q en realidad es....no estira nada y no me mandaron el chaleco
2.0,Earrings arrived way before time but they are not my taste. To me they look a little cheap and the 3D look is way to much for me.
2.0,"builds up lint very quickly, but the print has stayed on well"
2.0,"Very poorly made, I got another pair with a design & those were fine, but these were junk. Seller was AWESOME!!!!"
2.0,Boxy and way to large. Was like a man size and fit. Picture shown was for a female.
2.0,My daughter felt like the shirt was choking her and the material was toooo hot. She complains every time she wears it!
2.0,Very cheaply made in China product. Returned for refund.
2.0,"The spinner center section is loose and misaligned at its seam - it catches on a part of the base every time you spin it. I think maybe someone got a deal on factory rejects, because this sure looks like one."
2.0,"We love UA products, but the dark color and small brim wasn't what we thought. I would try a lighter color next time."
2.0,They lied about description of the coat. It’s very thin with no lining. It’s definitely not a peacoat
2.0,Cheap clingy material and I am 5'5&#34; 170lbs but more of a sturdy athletic build but with hips. The way the pockets laid on my figure made it look weird plus with this type of material...no bueno. Sent it back. If your slender and thin you shouldn't have a problem.
2.0,In the USA the size they have listed as XL 14 is really an 8
2.0,"Got these for airsoft, they fit well but fog badly. I end up with water running down the inside of the lenses as I play."
2.0,Lenses were scratched. But didn’t block vision too much .
2.0,did not fit right
2.0,This dress doesn't fit well. it looks very bulky.
2.0,way to big!!! on the waist disipointed
2.0,Looks fake and definitely too big !
2.0,"Don’t waste your money, cheap."
2.0,"It was a nice color, however it seemed cheaply made.  There were loads of loose threads, and it had a hole in the seem connecting the Cape to the dress. It is tts though."
2.0,I was disappointed when I opened to discover the white tank had one strap that was not connected. So it is useless. I technically only got three since I cannot use the white tank.
2.0,The connecter is slightly too big for the watch so it's very still.  I'm afraid it may break off.  Next one I'll know not to get this type.
2.0,"Came wayy to small it’s supposed to be one size fits all but it won’t even stretch, also you can’t really hear the music playing so it doesn’t really work! The idea is cool but this one didn’t work out! Not worth it."
2.0,Runs super small. I bought these for my almost 7 yr old and they are very small. Soft fabric and cute designs.
2.0,I was disappointed with the very light weight of the fabric (almost like gauze) and poor construction.  Would not purchase again even at the low price.  It is for my daughter and she liked the loose fit.
2.0,"Nice item, 2 for one price. I bought 2 times the item and one of the bracelets in every shopping were defective. I bought spare LED lights and could solve the trouble. The quality control is poor."
2.0,was smaller that quoted
2.0,"Realmente se veía muy bien, pero solo duro tres dias y empezó a desatarse es una lástima porque me gustaba como se veía."
2.0,"I normally wear large. I recommend size up, for sure."
2.0,"This was advertised as real leather, but it's fake leather. Also the wrong brand. I purchased BSWolf brand, but received Travelambo. I'll be returning these."
2.0,"Not sure what Nine West thinks ""crepe"" is but this isn't it. Looks and feels completely like polyester. Really disappointed."
2.0,These socks are extremely thin.  I assumed they would be a bit thicker.... they're almost as thin as simple trouser socks.<br />I wanted to wear them with boots - no go.<br />LCW
2.0,The owl pendent was way too big for the chain. And the chain felt very cheap. Not a fan of the latch it had. I had to send it back.
2.0,"So badly wanted this to be cute and it had great potential. Color was beautiful, but it was too sheer. When daughter wore a bra underneath (necessary as she isn’t flat-chested) you could see every line of the bra and even where the hooks were. The dress was a good fit so it’s not like it was being pulled too tight…it’s just the type of material used. Super bummed and returned it. Also, the chest area should definitely be stitched. Anyone busty is liable to be hanging out after an hour as it just wants to open further."
2.0,This item is not rose gold. It’s peach. It will not match the dress I am wearing for a wedding so I have to return it. Otherwise it would have been pretty.
2.0,"Inaccurate description. The length on an XL is listed as 42.5 and the bust as 37.8. However, the total length of the dress I received (when laying flat) was only 37 inches, and the bust is BARELY 36 inches. That extra 1.8 inches might not seem like much, but it's the difference between this fitting and not fitting. Only reason it's two stars instead of one is that the dress seems to at least be decently constructed."
2.0,Chain broke within a month
2.0,"I eyed these for so long, and I finally got them! I was super bummed to find out the posts are too thick to even get into my earring holes. I struggled with it for a minute, but then I actually bent the climber itself, so I’m just counting this one a loss.<br /><br />They’re really pretty though, if you have wider earring holes."
2.0,I really liked the way these looks BUT gems fell out of them less than a week after owning them and only wearing them twice.. of course I couldn't find the gem to fix it either...
2.0,Perhaps this piece was designed without ever fitting it to an actual human model. All proportions are strange. Giant neck. Exaggerated arm ruffles. Poor fit overall. The bow is okay. Earth to designers: look at real humans! :)
2.0,Returned. Bottoms fit weird and the thumb holes where aligned wrong so the sleeves where twisting.
2.0,Not worth the price. Good fit but cheap materials. I could see if you got 10 but not 4.
2.0,Disappointed in the quality.
2.0,"Very pretty earrings. Received lots of compliments on them! Unfortunately, the post broke off of one earring while exchanging hugs. So bummed."
2.0,The copper half bracelet cuffs will have to be cleaned before using the cuff were black
2.0,4'11<br />135lbs<br />Size M<br />Returned it because the style didn't look good on me. The material was decent. The orange was a slightly different shade as in the picture. The fit was as expected.
2.0,Received short and it looks nothing like photo. If looking for a shirt that looks like the photo keep looking. Received and can barely see any color variation.
2.0,This dress was very unattractive on.
2.0,"The glasses are much more cats' eye than the image makes you believe.  I thought these would be mostly round, with a little point to them, but nope.  I returned them the next day."
2.0,Very thin fabric. See through
2.0,"These are definitely for a small, narrow face. They don’t fit me, but that’s not why I’m giving them two stars. These literally fell apart as I took them out of the case for the first time. They’re otherwise really cute, but buyer beware."
2.0,I ordered a 42&#34; received 38&#34; Belt gave it to my grandson rather going thru the time to return it<br />The belt looks good on him.<br />  Hvave a nice day
2.0,I ordered this thinking it was a denim blue and it's not. It's a light blue like the sky. Love the purse. Hate the blue. I kept it anyway.
2.0,"Ring looked and felt cheap.  Metal felt extremely light, almost hollow.  Returned this item."
2.0,The earrings themselves are beautiful. Only problem is that the backs (all 6) do not have holes!! I am keeping them because they have great color and shine. I am having to use rose gold backs from other earrings I own. Disappointing. Like to keep earrings and their backings together.
2.0,Cute but turned my belly button green
2.0,"Ended up having to return it. It kept reading the PH level in my soil as nearly an 8, which I know isn't accurate."
2.0,"I loved the look of the jeans, pretty flowers and coloring but the button popped off when trying them on, and the &quot;jean&quot; material is odd. Feels very thin, I didn't get to wear them as button enclosure defective , and had to return them strait away. Shame."
2.0,Did not fit me. Way too big.
2.0,well not all that l thought it was
2.0,Size does not match up with actual size
2.0,"Shorts are made with cheap material and is very uncomfortable,  But that's what you get for a $10 pair of shorts."
2.0,The pendant is okay but the chain is junk.
2.0,Shorts seem to be well made BUT when I hear compression I expect a more snug but comfortable fit. The size indicator suggested size Large but I think Medium would of been more to my liking. Mail order can lead you in the wrong direction at times. The same holds true with the compression shirts -- I think I've learned my lesson: talk to a human/buy in person.
2.0,"This slip is disappointing. It is sewn so there is not a difference in the front or back. Too much material in the front crotch area, looks silly and baggy I know it goes under dresses, but it feels uncomfortable with the extra fabric."
2.0,"Snags and extra thread all over. I’m giving them the benefit of the doubt and just assuming I got a bad pair but if your plan is to only wear them around the house then look no further, I would not get these if you want to wear them in public though. They are super soft and seem like they would be really comfortable. Love the double pocket."
2.0,"I love these glasses, unfortunately after a couple months the eye glass part started to ripple and get distorted!  I leave the glasses in my car in the case they come with. I am so sad, loved these.. you can see in the pic what is happening to them and now I can’t see through them"
2.0,"Very attractive shoe in picture.  But, Strap was a little tight ; strap not well made - separates (I had to glue it together. I would have preferred to be refunded for the shoe - rather than just offered to pay postage - which I did receive. I now prefer well-known name brands."
2.0,"It doesn’t stay on the knees when my baby crawls. It just rolls down which doesn’t help. More over the elastic used have already come up but I thought it will be fine. Didn’t like at all. Had good expectations from this based on the reviews. Since I washed a pair, not sure if I can return. Wish I could return and look for a better one."
2.0,"Too small, too flimsy, and too transparent."
2.0,"Colors were no where near picture.I expected lavender in there somewhere, got faded pink & yellow"
2.0,"The fit is good, but I wish I had looked to see what material this was, as I feels rough like a plastic texture which is very uncomfortable"
2.0,Looks well made and like it would withstand quite a bit of beach use... but it's tiny. I was only able to pull the bikini bottoms up to right around my knees.
2.0,"the cloth sticks to my freezer shelves, the chest straps are meant for really large people i guess so check your size, or else you are going to have excess straps hanging down. Sometimes depending on how it freezes you still get wet. the straps and plastic is really cold on your skin although the cloth seems to do a good job. Also please note when you first buy this thing you can only lose weight with if if you are properly dieting and exercising. So if i'm already doing that why buy this vest anyways. But i guess it is nice in the summer and may save you some a/c bills.<br /><br />Do not buy it."
2.0,Side pockets were practically sewn shut and buttons were poorly attached
2.0,The material stretches very fast and has no elastic so it doesn't hold shape. I only got to wear them a couple times before they could've covered a tree stump.
2.0,You might want to get a size bigger than what you normally are because they run small
2.0,"Poor quality, the wrist adjustment velcro began fraying almost immediately and the chest/back material melted in multiple places after being washed. Also the arms are NOT ACU material, they are more like flannel and as a result get very hot and absorb moisture. I would highly recommend a different style combat shirt unless the fire retardant material is a requirement."
2.0,"The glasses fit well and I likes the design. But as you can see from the picture, they did not darken....AT ALL. I took this photo after being outside in the sunlight for several hours and then driving home in the daylight. Found myself squinting the entire time. At $26 price point, not a value at all for just bifocals."
2.0,This sweater feels VERY A CHEAP and it's not that comfortable. I wouldn't recommend this.
2.0,Love the design and quality but the color of the gemstone is not as expected. It has a blueish purpleish color to it and had to return it back.
2.0,"Gross fabric. The shirt isn’t terrible to look at, but it’s that thick, nasty polyester that grates against your skin-like a retro 70’s blouse you’d find at a vintage store. Returning this."
2.0,"things sliding around to where they don't rightly belong in the way that something comfortable does not. Then yes, I would say they were - or if by comfortable you mean you have a two dimension body where things fit as if you were a cardboard cutout, then...alright.<br />But, I do not, I move around, and walk and sit down and stand up and in that process the waist kept going to the hip, and the ankles rotated in the stockings as if I had been playing twister in them.<br />If you can create comfort in a way that suits most of us women, then I would give you 5 stars."
2.0,Too short and boxy doesn’t lay nice
2.0,Gorgeous dress but completely see through which is disappointing
2.0,Straps broke after one wear
2.0,Long but not wide enough. I ended up getting one at Walmart
2.0,I may have to return. Very thin material not quality.
2.0,"Dress was not vey flattering on my body type. 5'3 and 140lbs, 34dd. The color was a nice dark brown. Unfortunately it did nothing for me."
2.0,"Plankton is blue, SpongeBob's holes are green and sandy is green. Don't buy. Low quality. Cheap material. They also started to rip apart when I gently tried to take them off my Crocs."
2.0,"The color and texture are great, but after eating it only once (a full day), threads from the silk texture had come undone making it look very fuzzy, and I had to carefully cut them with scissors."
2.0,"For maternity underpants the price wasn't too terrible, but I wouldn't buy these again. They fit well in the waist but are super tight and uncomfortable around the thighs. I kept wanting to take them off because they were just rubbing me raw. One pair even ripped after only a short time of wearing them.<br />I feel like I should mention that my thighs arent that big, so I definitely would not recommend these to women that might have some more curves in their bottom half."
2.0,It was good while it lasted. Clip broke off in less than 6 months. I would have hoped that it lasted longer than that.
2.0,These were great at first but the coating wore off after six months of normal use. Never used anything but the cloth to clean them and never been in salt water. Not sure if I got a bad set or what but not sure if I'd pay for another set.
2.0,"disappointed in it, I Thought that it was the whole role not just a small amount"
2.0,Too long. They don’t sit at the ankle at a cute length. They end up looking frumpy. I’m 5’3” and got the medium.
2.0,"i thought it was extremely cute and arrived quickly, but it fell off during the first wear and i lost it. Wish that it was more secure and i had it on pretty tight so I was confused to look and see that it was not there anymore."
2.0,My son's foot gets extremely sweaty in this sneaker--and in no other shoe or sneaker.
2.0,I received my chokers yesterday and one was broken in the package 😡 but they did come early. Not all of them fit so its kinda of frustrating hope the others don't break
2.0,"The material is like a nylon stretchy material and the pattern just doesn't sit right on me (5'3&#34;). I will not be wearing it that's for sure, but I don't think they have a free return policy so I might just give it away. :/"
2.0,Loved the shirt but very small for an XL. This was my second small show shirt. Both were XL the first is loose fitting and this one was extremely tight. Disappointed
2.0,I really like mine but it came broken from one side. 😭
2.0,Way to small / short. Giving it away.
2.0,"These are very sparkly and cute from afar, however, the design is not detailed at all. I wouldn't recommend buying for any more than the $1.99 I paid. I definitely got what I paid for with these."
2.0,"The sprayer leaks and makes a mess, not worth it."
2.0,Sizes aren't accurate. Sleeves were too tight.
2.0,Don’t last long
2.0,Not for me. A bit short for wearing or sleeping also the material is a bit warm to get comfy.
2.0,The wires at the side bulge out and make you look like you have a fat roll that isn't  there. I sent them back for this reason. Otherwise they have cute colors and they fit well.
2.0,These did not work feom day one! My son could not use them while using his phone. Definitely a waste of money.
2.0,The rubber loop that holds the frame started slipping off a couple of  wears.  Doesn't hold up.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend.
2.0,"I like the pattern and colors, but it's quite small and uncomfortable"
2.0,Fabric is already fraying after a couple uses.
2.0,Product won’t last tears easy
2.0,"I got this to wear to a blues festival, but the 2X (which is larger than I wear) was more like a size Medium. I will donate it to someone."
2.0,"I don’t know why other reviewers said these aren’t see-through. They must’ve never looked at their derrières in the light of day. Don’t waste your time ordering the black ones like I did. You can see your hand through them without even putting them on! Imagine how much more see through they are, then, when stretched tight across your haunches!"
2.0,There was a stain on the dress!
2.0,Way too small!! Even ordered bigger than needed and still too small. Returned
2.0,I'm returning these shorts. The sizing is way off.
2.0,bad quality :(
2.0,"I bought these in September 2020, but they fell apart so quickly... :/ Unlucky."
2.0,"This towel was super cute and a good size, however after washing it a handful of times, the panda face and ears started to rip and the little paw flaps completely fell off."
2.0,Doesnt sit nicely
2.0,The waist of the pants was really high and unusually large compared to the proportion of the leg seams. Once I washed the pants the length shortened by at least 2 inches making the pants nothing like the photo.
2.0,returned this item as it was MUCH too small
2.0,Sight through Spidey eyes is terrible.
2.0,Weird fit. It has a piece of fabric in the front that sticks out.
2.0,"The color in this was true to what was pictured, but the material was super thin and the seams looked poorly made. It was smaller than I expected, with little room to move in an XL, which is my usual size. Went back."
2.0,Strap broke after a couple of uses.  Just left grocery store when strap broke and all my groceries dropped out.
2.0,net does not spread as expected. didn't use it.  wish I could send it back
2.0,Looks very different then on the picture. print is much larger. Very thing too. Money waisted!
2.0,The watch face cracks really easily if you aren’t careful and the battery life sucks. I had to replace the battery within a week of getting it and after the first replacement I had to just buy a new one because it randomly stopped working and nothing could get it going again. a solid month later the same thing happened to the second watch. definitely avoid this product
2.0,"Bought the floral print, size small. Larger than expected -- my measurements are 34-27-38, so by their size chart I should have been a medium, but even the small was a bit big. Nice material but returned because it was completely see-through even with nude underwear."
2.0,Vinyl is very hard. Nice size bag.
2.0,"Very good quality jacket! Light, warm, for deep Autumn and the beginning of Winter! But, they sent me a completely different color of the inner edging ... This edging, in the Amazon picture it is orange, and on the sent jacket it is gray. It is very sad that I could not give my wife what she liked. She is very sad ... The seller shows one thing and sends another. Be careful when ordering from this seller! And my 2 stars are precisely for this inattention!"
2.0,"The design and fit is good. A bit smaller than other snapbacks, I have to wear it on the longest setting. My complaint is that the edge is much more freyed than the images show. The manufacturing process must be simply to cut the bat shape out of a snapback and sew the edge down about a quarter of an inch from the front. The plastic of the brim is visible and not a black color. Fortunately, my wife is big into DIY and was able to glue down the edges and paint the exposed edges black and it now one of my favorite hats. Of you are willing to tidy up the brim yourself, or you are going for a grungy look, then get the hat. Otherwise you might want to pass if you want a crisp finished look."
2.0,The chain is extremely small from the pic it looked alot bigger. Also the charm is only .5x.25 inches at the most. Completely overpriced.
2.0,They don’t stretch at all so I can’t get them over my feet. Don’t waste your money.
2.0,"Very pretty, crystal look amazing. Broke halfway up 1 side, I thot i could get it fixed but jeweler said repair cost more than the necklace."
2.0,"Fits weird. Maybe it’s my body type. Top was too large and bottoms are short. I have very large boobs so, read measurements and hope for the best"
2.0,"They are cute and would serve my purpose (light yardwork) just fine IF they had &#34;XXL&#34; or even &#34;XXXL&#34;.  As other reviewers have said, the sizing is grossly underestimated.  I tried XL (the largest size they make) on my 10.5 shoe and it was a super struggle trying to get them on.<br /><br />If you have normal human sized shoes (like a 9), and you order a couple sizes larger than you think from their sizing chart, you may also find them cute.  Not super robust, but a nice idea."
2.0,Whilst cheap the build quality is poor and over half of them didn't work.
2.0,These arrived tarnished and are of very cheap quality.  They are very easily bent and my wife was afraid they would break.  The picture looks very nice but the reality is that they are being returned.
2.0,You get what you pay for. I ordered a large because I have a larger chest but a small frame. This top rides up in the front and does not stay on very well.
2.0,"frankly, this product looks better than a 10 bucks tie. like a 15-20 bucks one<br />however, the knot is horrible, i even used my teeth and a spanner to unzip it but it doesn't work (and vegetable oil)<br />glad i got a normal tie as backup plan"
2.0,Getting soon foggy...
2.0,Recieved it and my wife wore it for about a week befire noticing the green appearing in her finger and the inner ring of the rose gold look being gone.<br /><br />Get what you pay for!
2.0,Good cover of the body but it's a blanket poncho!
2.0,I ordered the over sized sunglasses to fit over my prescription glasses. These are not that. Both top and bottom rims of my glasses show outside of rim on sunglasses. Tossed original box and not worth hassle of returning. Do not buy if you have medium or large frames on prescription glasses. I am looking for another company.
2.0,"The arrow tips are super sharp and scratch up your wrists. The opening and circumference  are really narrow (unless you've got tiny childlike hands). Adjusting the bracelet eventually snaps the metal.  So essentially it'll probably break if you try to get it on and once you do, it'll scratch you up. I'd pass."
2.0,"I loved the print so much, they were going to look great for a tacky Christmas party I’m going to. But the material stretches thin in some areas so my undies show through. A size up would be too large. I just don’t like the material. Super bummed."
2.0,"Pros: color is pretty<br />Cons: neckline is way to high, dress is tea length, not knee...makes you look frumpy"
2.0,I got the medium &#34;sand&#34; color and I wasnt satisfied. It didnt look like the picture it was bright color.<br />And the medium is too big. I tried to get a refund but I had to pay $9 to ship it back.
2.0,The top doesn't fit correctly as if it is irregular..the bottom fits fine.
2.0,These are not stainless steel. They will turn your fingers green. No good.
2.0,Really cute boots but they dont fit. I ordered them bigger to fit my calf and upper leg but now I have a boot that is to big on my foot and is still too small on my upper leg!<br />PS : I've been in bed all week cuz I had shofs done in my head so I get pretty wiped out from it. So can I send it off this next week?
2.0,The onsie was too big in the neck so it dropped down to where you couldn't see the one. Skirt was a little tight. Looked just like the picture.
2.0,I didn’t really like them at all.  The frame is good but didn’t really like the choice I had for a small head and they don’t fit a small head.  Lens is bad and I don’t ware them at all.  I noticed some distortion in one spot and just using them to cut the grass the sun was blinding I had to take them off to get the Glare out of my eyes.  I don’t usually write reviews but this time I don’t have anything good to say about this products.
2.0,"For my body type... I did not like it. The material was good. The color was true to the pic, it just did not work for my body type. It fits as expected."
2.0,"The gloves were pretty much two different sizes. The right glove fit fine but the left glove fit my child, the wrist opening was sewn much much smaller than its partner! Bummer"
2.0,"This dress looked like nightgown on me, or possibly a swimsuit coverup, but definitely not a dress.  I got the solid blue and if I was to order again, I would go down a size and opt for a print."
2.0,"I should have listened to the people who said this shoe runs very small. I have the Dream model in the same size  (women's 10M), and they fit perfectly and have just about cured my plantar fasciitis. I wanted one more pair because the Dreams are so soft they are wearing down quickly, but couldn't find another Dream in my size so I tried these. They are over an inch shorter than the others! Why should there be such a big difference in two pairs of shoes in the same size from the same manufacturer? I can't wear these and don't want to spend more to return them, so they will be given away."
2.0,The fit is really bad. The part where the face goes is so far forward that it makes it extremely difficult to bottom up the back. It also doesn't look very much like the character it is made to look like. The price is too high for how poorly put together this is.
2.0,"Ring is cute, only had it a few days but no color change thus far.... Only thing I don't like about it is that there's a big glob of glue on top and it blocks part of the color changing part :("
2.0,"It was supposed to be a 2x however it fits a large more than a 2x. Order bigger. However it is a good fit for length it goes to my husbands hip.it’s like a waterproof material. Also it is small around the stomach, and my husband cannot zip it at the moment. It will take him to lose 20+ pounds to be able to zip it up."
2.0,"I am 5'7"" and 157 pounds.<br />Not like the pictures (different shape, color). The shorts are baggy around the waist. The material thin. I won't wear it.<br />Fast delivery."
2.0,"I am allergic to anything other than silver and gold. There's no way these are actual sterling silver, as within a day after I started wearing these, I had an allergic reaction to them. Not happy."
2.0,The fit is great but the fabric is not.
2.0,I like the workmanship and the overall looks of the bracelet but unhappy with the ease that it comes unclasped. I've almost lost it for this reason and look for it to happen any day.
2.0,This shirt is VERY see through. I returned it the day day I got it. I don't feel it is flattering
2.0,I wore this robe once and the pocket already fell off!!!
2.0,Order one or two sizes bigger than usual. Two inches smaller in every measurement than stated.
2.0,Felt it was a very cheaply made product.
2.0,This strapless bra was useless for someone with a bigger bust size (36D). This might be helpful for someone with a smaller bust. I give it to two stars for the sticky adhesive. It actually sticked.
2.0,So cute. Shorts fit perfectly. But NOT MADE FOR WOMEN WITH BIG BOOBS. Top did not fit at all!!!! Tiny breasts only.
2.0,"I am very disappointed with this item.  First, in moderately cold skiing weather 10-20 degrees fahrenheit, my face was a little cold through this mask.  While skiing downhill, the wind shred through this mask.  Second, after only 1 weekend of moderate use, the front of the mask was worn away.  I would not be surprised if it tore during the 2nd weekend of use.  Third, I have a medium sized head and this thing was wayyyy too big for me.  Finally, the mask traps the moisture of my breath and freezes it, making the mask uncomfortable around the mouth area.<br /><br />The only pros are that it is lightweight and breathable."
2.0,This is very sexy but the fit was weird. I usually wear a size 6-8 a US size M and according to the size chart I ordered a size 2X Asian size. The swimsuit was wide so I had lots of extra room in the waist area and it was short from top to bottom so it was up my butt.
2.0,"I think the concept is good, but the actual product is not. It is WAY too large(and I have a big head).<br />Also, where the bluetooth speaker is located is very bulky..I couldn't wear it for more than 2 minutes..I will be returning this.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. All thoughts, opinions, and experiences are my own."
2.0,Dissapointed in the poor quality of the Buckeye sign.  The graphics look poor and almost faded???
2.0,Chain broke after two days of use. Also butterfly is a lot bigger than I was expecting.
2.0,Cute but cheap! Sad face..
2.0,This had no<br />Support in the breasts
2.0,What a weird fit OMG I was so excited waiting for this bra because of the pictures in the reviews. It feels really soft in your body but the boobs shape is awful. I had a child 3 years ago and you know when you breastfeed it never looks the same anymore. Yes your boobs looks good because they stick together but on the size at least for me didn't work. Beautiful pink color and really soft material I'm just returning it because of the fit.
2.0,The shirt was really thin strange material returned it!
2.0,"I was optimistic about this mask for singing with my chorus, but it's a disappointment. The design is 5 stars, but the fabric is stretchy nylon, making it hot and difficult to breathe through.<br /><br />The design is terrific. It fits close to my face, without gaps, and the plastic strip inserted into the slot keeps the mask away from my mouth and provides plenty of room for my mouth to move, without sucking the mask in whenever I take a breath.<br /><br />But that nylon fabric makes this mask impossible to wear for longer than a few minutes without needing to get fresh air.<br /><br />This is made in China, and it ships directly from there, so it takes a long time to receive as well. And it had a funny smell and required washing before wearing, so you won't be able to hand these out at the beginning of rehearsal and expect people to comfortably wear them that night.<br /><br />Others have posted positive reviews, so that makes me wonder if the manufacturer changed the fabric. If this was made from breathable cotton, it would be 10 stars!"
2.0,"the top is baggy and shapeless. I bought it to wear to an elementary school party, and wanted a full coverage top. This top is Wider than it is longer and the sleeves are so wide but then have a cuff at the wrist, so it looks odd like a peasant blouse. The material is see through and so thin that I will need to wear an undershirt! Not like the picture! Worst part for me is that the black hearts are not faded and distressed like in the picture. They are solid and dark! I bought it for the distressed look."
2.0,Not sure it works well for the glare or halos for the cars coming. Works good for overcast and fog though
2.0,"To be able to use the goggles you need to flip down the folded layer, which makes the hat super tall"
2.0,The dress felt like a burlap sack and has no shape. Its literally to cuts a fabric badly sewn together:(
2.0,It's cute but didn't get in time for Christmas sadly. :(
2.0,"Cheap material, made for someone with an xx large butt, the size ordered was a large,  looks home made, fits home made, seams home made, I'm so disappointed, beautiful pink tho, I'm 5ft 8 inches, and 158 lbs. Long legs, short torso, bigger breasts, fits ok , other wise?  Maybe a medium should have been order ed?"
2.0,Bought for a vacation and it got here the day before I left. The ad said “fit as expected” I didn’t expect them to run small
2.0,This shirt was a size smaller than expected.  I ordered a large and it fit like a medium.
2.0,Es un  vestido paeacestar en casa. Parece bara df dormir
2.0,The skit is not at all full like the model image. Returned it
2.0,"I don't have a pea head but these are way too large. They constantly slip off. I passed them to two friends hoping they would have better luck and they had the same problem. Upside is if you have a big head, the bright color is true and stayed after a run through the washing machine."
2.0,The photos for this sweatshirt give the impression that the waist band is somewhat fitted. In reality it is as wide as the sweatshirt making it extremely boxy. The cuffs are just as bad. Best guess is for the photos the shirt was clipped in the back of the waistband.
2.0,"I loved my purchase, but I've only had it for a couple of weeks, and it already came apart!"
2.0,"See through, thin, the elastic leaves marks in your skin"
2.0,Disliked opening them to put a photo inside..way to hard. Probably won't use them that often..
2.0,"Thin material, not attractive looking at all. Donated to Hope."
2.0,Too bulky around waist.  Makes clothing fit weird.
2.0,Though it is a beautiful watch it gained two minutes the first five minutes I was wearing it.  It has a sweep second hand but noticed that it periodically jerked forward which probably explains the time gain.  The instructions I received were all in Chinese.
2.0,Super tight not the size they say. Graphics are good. Pull tabs were on packaging but when pulled they still do not light up. Disappointed... there is a velcro tab in them with batteries inside the light up part. Not comfortable. Little man was very upset they barely fit and do not light up.
2.0,Cute but cheaply made. The zipper wouldn’t zip up. I tried a hundred way. I wish it would’ve worked because these could have been cute.
2.0,"The glasses were well made and as powerful as promised.  They were of no use, as my father's eyesight is too far gone for them to be effective."
2.0,"Shirt does not come down long enough.  Looks nasty on a ""plus size"" person!!!"
2.0,Not as nice as I had hoped it would be.
2.0,They are cute but sooooo thin. Holes almost instantly
2.0,"The wallet itself was covered in an oil substance that was actually leaking out of the inside packaging, not a good experience"
2.0,"It is cute, I have had two now and both of them broke the day I wore them. Not very happy with the product, but like I said love the look, but need to make the way the bracelet attaches a little stronger so it doesn't break so easy. I will not order anymore and will stick to the leather one instead.:-("
2.0,"The guards look ok, I haven't tried them yet but the band just isn't very pretty up close.  I wouldn't buy this if I had seen it up close."
2.0,Very cute shoes but not safe to wear since the heel strap is too loose.  There’s no way to tighten the strap. The footbed fits like other sorel size 9.5. I’m noticing that this is an issue with their sandals.
2.0,I bought these as a gift and went by the measurements on the size chart but my sister couldn't even get them on.
2.0,Collar was super cute when I got it. Maybe my puppy and the other dogs were to rough but it didn’t last.
2.0,Maybe I haven’t gotten the hang of it
2.0,"This leggings look good but for some reason I could not ge the size I requested XS, they kept sending L size twice...<br />So I gave up and requested a refund."
2.0,returned too long
2.0,Sleeves are short🤬<br />Runs small
2.0,Too thin and small. Disappointed
2.0,The inside has seams that rub and are itchy.  It does have decent support.
2.0,"This really isn't all that better than a homemade cloth mask. It's hot. The filters are supposed to snap together (I think, but can't be sure because there aren't any instructions for assembly). The filters fall apart and get lost so you can end up with a mask with a big hole in it which won't allow you to enter some places. It's expensive."
2.0,More like a hooded t shirt than a hooded sweater. Very thin for the price.
2.0,"I believe they designed these with people who have severed their thumbs at the knuckle. Maybe the designers have abnormally short thumbs compared to the relative size of the rest of their fingers? I had thought that perhaps I have really long thumbs and reach out to guiness to get my record in the books, but no I had others try them and it is the gloves."
2.0,The peace sign photo inside necklace is cockeyed. doesn't sit straight up and down. Wanted to like this necklace. Returning it.
2.0,"The fabric was great, soft and comfy, however, the gathering on the front make it look like you are pregnant if you have any kind of tummy."
2.0,They were a good weight but too small. My daughter is seven and smaller and these barely pulled on her legs. More for a 4 year old at most
2.0,Arrived quickly but is way too big for my ear
2.0,These pants look awesome and they are supposed to be my sons new favorites but I can’t seem to get the right size. I’ve ordered a large twice and both times received a medium. Now the price has gone up on these kind of things so looks I’ll have to pay more somewhere else to try to get a pair like these for my kiddo. Bummer!
2.0,This was cheap and one dimensional so I returned it.
2.0,"These say 20 gauge, but they've got to be at least 18. I know nose hoops are notoriously difficult to get in, but once I got one in, the piercing started bleeding, and took several days to heal again afterward. They're too big for my nose anyway-- it looked ridiculous once I got it in."
2.0,"The tie was in good condition but not what I wanted, quality wiser. I needed a little bit higher quality but I wasn't willing to pay more. It was perfect for the price, if that makes sense."
2.0,Not very good quality material.  I returned it!
2.0,"For some reason I thought these would be more universal for different shapes of glasses, but they are pretty specific for the shape and size of the clip on part. If your glasses aren't the exact size and shape they won't work."
2.0,"I gave it away, gave me headaches it was so tight"
2.0,"not that amazing quality, got a hole in the bigger toe area same day of wearing it."
2.0,The face appears large in the sales picture. But it's a little to small for me.
2.0,Not a great product. It’s slightly thinner than expected. It gets stuck when trying to size.<br />Could not rate more than 2 stars as the product is not worthy.  Thinking of replacing with leather strap and use this as backup!
2.0,Very very scratchy and crappy fabric... kept bunching up and getting stuck to itself...<br /><br />It fit nicely though and it’s cheap if you need it for one night.
2.0,Came out to be slightly small for my husband though we went a size bigger. The design and overall was decent though low quality.
2.0,"Really wanted to love these! However the gloves ripped in 20 min, but overall its costume accessories, and they served their purpose"
2.0,Not the greatest material. Thin but soft. Feels like it would deteriorate easily. Returned.
2.0,My husband has other Field and Stream shirts of this size but this small is too small.
2.0,The back of skirt has two pockets that ride up and bunch the waist band. Skirt looks very bad from the back. I am going to send it back. Looks more like a fitted skirt but is fuller at the bottom.<br />I
2.0,Very hard to screw in the ends and the flat stud was not long enough to fit in my tragus piercing.
2.0,The scalloped edges peeled away and showed through every shirt I tried it with. Gave nice cleavage but wouldn’t stay put.
2.0,Quality was terrible returned
2.0,These bloomers are so cute but they are so tight that they leave marks on my child’s tights.
2.0,"They all are to Small for one thing , And<br />They're not Ajustable , And they are Very very , Uncomfortable like what were you thinking about When you Designed THIS One !!  All I can Say is. , REFUND !!!"
2.0,"Comfy jammies. Great, after I repaired the defective metal 'claws' at the bottom of the zipper. Had this not been an issue, this would have been 5 stars."
2.0,"Soft fabric and is true to size, but color not as pictured,  more of a duller green. The ruching at the shoulder and hip doesn't look anything like the picture either."
2.0,"Technically these are usable. They keep hands warm decent enough, but for anything else, I wouldn't recommend them.<br /><br />The liner is not attached to the fingers of the gloves, so if your hand is tacky or wet, it will pull out the liner as you take off the glove (pictured). It has taken me way too long to try to get the liner back in the finger holes.<br /><br />The other issue is that there is about an inch gap between the end of the liner and the outside of the glove (pictured). This makes it almost impossible to use for anything requiring a lot of dexterity."
2.0,"I always wash new clothing before wearing it. But after this very first wash, several rips appeared along seams. The fabric itself just pulled out of the seam. I am very disappointed because this is not a simple repair - the shape of the garment will be changed. And maybe more seams will rip after the next wash?"
2.0,"size was way to small.  I normally take a large, but ordered an extra large just in case and it was still very tight fitting."
2.0,"The suit was cute and fit well, but the material it is made of is inferior. It is thin and stretched out severely within a few weeks of wear—so much that it’s basically unusable. Other brands I purchased at the same time have held up nicely."
2.0,It was a little too skimpy for my granddaughter.
2.0,"These insoles are not what I expected.  They are hard.  So if you are looking for an insole that has cushioning, look at a another Sof Sole products.  I would not recommend."
2.0,Too short. Cheap fabric.
2.0,"Was everything I'd hoped for when it arrived..super cute! HOWEVER, it broke the 3rd day I wore out. If you are looking for something durable I do not recommend"
2.0,"They fit nicely until I did something stupid like WASH THEM!  Boy did they shrink.  Washed in warm water, more cool than warm, with other Tesla items I own.  As I discovered with their base layer clothes, allow to air dry as dryers beat them up.  So, I air dried with those.  I wonder how much more they would have shrank if I had put them in the dryer.  Never again.  Gave them to a 10 year old neighbor kid.  He thinks their tight.  LOL"
2.0,"To short lenght, fabric and emblems not so good."
2.0,Watch doesn’t sit flat in the band.  But it still looks ok. The skulls look like cheap plastic.  They may be metal but look like plastic.  A few minutes in a mosh pit and the watch fell off and slid somewhere in the crowd.  I still have the bad but the watch is gone.  Overall cheap construction.  I do not recommend this product.
2.0,"Too long for this 5’2” woman, about 5” too long"
2.0,ANSI Z87.1 is not stamped anywhere on the glasses making them trash on the job site.
2.0,"Cool band, good quality, but does not attach well at all, maybe it was manufactured wrong but I can't use it, maybe you will have better luck"
2.0,"Didn't fit at all. Couldn't get it past my chest.  For reference, Im a size 12 and bought a Large. Returned it. Size up in this dress."
2.0,The string is starting to thin out! Sooner or later it’s going to eventually snap apart.
2.0,Design is nice but hurts from inside
2.0,"Nice color and the clasp is nice, but the plastic comes out of the metal support with little force. I super glued it back together and it seems okay now, but not the best quality."
2.0,Returned. Did not love. Large fit. Also too long.
2.0,"I was hesitant about this because in some pix it looked like the front seams did not have a pattern match, but I took a chance. I received the garment and that is the case- the two sides of the garment are not matched at the seam. The dot pattern is all over the place along the seam. To me it's very noticeable and a deal breaker. Returning."
2.0,"the cloth was not as it looked in the photo, is very transparent and the cloth is thin."
2.0,"The item came in professional packaging and looked normal as a new one. While inspecting it, when I put my hand in the back pocket to my surprise I found 2 pieces of candy wrappers! I am disappointed that a returned old item was sent to me instead of a new item."
2.0,"Seems like good quality. Missing piece on band to connect to watch, otherwise cute!"
2.0,The metal plate with the words is not nearly as bright and shiny (or legible) as the picture makes it out to be. Mine is dull and difficult to read. It's also a bit smaller than I was expecting.<br /><br />I'm a bit dissatisfied with it... but for $10 it's hard to complain too loudly.
2.0,I feel like this runs really large!
2.0,"Fabric is thin and light; size 3XL weighs 12.3 ounces or 348 grams. I am 6', 190 pounds. I normally wear XL shirts. The 3XL size is tight at my chest and shoulders. I can get it on but my movement is somewhat limited. There is no ""fly"" at the crotch; the top must be unbuttoned and dropped below the hips in order to urinate. Item delivered 13 days after placing order, the shipment tracking details were never updated after ""Accepted by Carrier"" report until item was delivered. Obviously a garment this inexpensive is going to be a gamble. I guess I would call this bet a draw."
2.0,DID NOT LIKE THE WAY THEY LOOK ON ME SENT BACK TO SELLER WITH NO PROBLEMS
2.0,"Uncomfortable, cheap material. Really disappointing."
2.0,I bought this item for a gift and the Amazon pic did it no justice. It looked like a piece of plastic that came from a bubble gum machine. The only nice thing I would say is it's size and the price. Just wish it looked like the pic instead.
2.0,Fits well but the material is cheap and the pattern is not on the inside of the shirt so forget about rolling up your sleeves. The buttons chipped or fell off completely after 2 washes. I wouldn’t reccomend this shirt despite the fact that the pattern is the bomb.
2.0,Only one of the bracelets were there. And one of the tie strings broke day two. But it is a nice bracelet.
2.0,These are so cute but holy camel toe. I’m sad I can’t wear these.
2.0,No me gustó mucho es muy pequeña
2.0,"They are really ready large, I put sweats on under and they were still huge."
2.0,Did not fit as expected at all. I got the size i usually do in dresses and it just kinda swallowed me and was not flattering at all. Had to return it and did not purchase another.
2.0,The door fit is for children but they are beautiful bracelets.... Wouldn't purchase again.
2.0,Was really cute but really really thin. For 40 bucks go to Marshall’s.
2.0,"Product runs small, not happy with this purchase"
2.0,"The quality is great, loved tha . But returning because they're wide leg calf, and it looks stupid. Also, they bunch up under the back if my knee if u sit or bend leg. I've NEVER had that problem with other boots . Returning"
2.0,Way too small. I ordered a 2t and it looked like it would fit 12-18m.
2.0,"This is a very disappointing top, because the cut is cute and everything ""fits."" The issue is that one bra cup is sewn from the inside, and the other is sewn on the outside. It's stupid! You can see that each side looks different with the ""bra"" portion looking tacky."
2.0,To bold
2.0,"Meh, much smaller than the original I had back in the 80's.  You will not be a sharp dressed man with this accessory."
2.0,Not made for a big boy
2.0,"Earrings has no back so lost one 1st day.  They are pretty however, they are smaller than they appear."
2.0,"Cute shorts but not true to size and run extremely small. I'm usually between a size 6 and 8. I did read they run small, so I ordered the 8. These must run seriously small because the 8 does not fit. Very disappointed."
2.0,"Seller in Hong-Kong (not mentioned on listing).  It is pretty, but very cheaply made & not very long (I doubt it will make it one MC ride without falling apart).  Make SURE to check your neck size in mm and it does NOT include the extra chains on the back.  Seller no speak English well and if you put anything other than 5 stars, you will get a message to change your rating before you will be able to get anything fixed.  I originally rated this as a 3 or 4 star = dropped it after email after email after email.  They even stated that if they didn't get their rating up (was 97%??) they couldn't sell stuff on eBay??  No idea what that meant since this is AMAZON!!  Replacement part 15-25 days from Hong Kong.  Unless you feel  like wasting $9, order elsewhere.."
2.0,"Nice bright silver, but lost a finger the first time I put it on. Not well made. Wouldn’t buy again!"
2.0,Seems authentic but not really durable like the ones that come from the store. I wore mine less than ten times and the thread on the back of my left heel spilt . All i do is walk around in school no heavy labor.
2.0,Not very durable. Scratches very easily. Scratched during the first day. Square and Compass etching isn't as detailed as in tyre picture.
2.0,The gloves were okay.  Nothing to rave about.  They did not go with the costume I purchased so I did not wear them.  I'll keep them since they were cheap.  Maybe the occasion and outfit will arise in the future.
2.0,Wouldn't buy it again
2.0,"This dress is awkward. If you have an average or larger chest and even a small amount of muscle in your shoulders, it's tight. I found the ruffles along the neckline are more appropriate for a clown costume. The material itself is very nice, light. BUT, it should be HAND WASHED. Putting this in a regular washer will destroy it, even on a gentle cycle. I bought it as part of a Halloween costume, so it worked out. I wore it once and threw out."
2.0,Cheap product.<br />Had lines into the colored leather after 1 week.
2.0,I love the bag and the price I paid but the handle was frayed very badly
2.0,"the shirt looks nice but i waited two weeks for a size Medium that was too small on me when i contacted them and after sending various pictures (which they asked ?!) the response was that the delivery charges cost more than the item and it wouldn't be a smart choice, so they suggested i'd give it to family or friends."
2.0,The product works well while new.  In about 3-4 days it wore through; and I don't work out a lot.
2.0,I love the style of the glasses but unfortunately they are to wide and fall of my nose.
2.0,Way too wide.
2.0,Very small for a size small...I ended up giving it to my younger sister...this is for petite XS....and the medium is for small...
2.0,Really nice belt but the hook that keeps it together isn't long enough so I have only worn once and would never purchase another one . It's a shame because the ornate part of the buckle is really wonderful.
2.0,Fit in the body but way too small in the chest. I'm 5'5&#34; 130 lbs and bought a medium. I'm a D cup and there no way to even attempt to fit in the suit.
2.0,They are very small. I had to give them to my children.
2.0,I didn't like the fit of this. It was way too big. Had to return.
2.0,"Sadly, the sleeve-cut on this dress is so unflattering, with that odd bit of extra fabric below each sleeve, that the beautiful bust-line, of each of the women trying this, was diminished. Every one looked better in what she was wearing before. This dress diminishes the side view of the bust, with that extra fabric, making the bust look a bit drab. Given how important a proper fit on the bust is, to the fit of any dress, I can't recommend this dress. The sleeves interfere with the cut of the bust and, ultimately, make the dress far less attractive than many competing garments. Good luck finding what will work for your needs."
2.0,"The picture is cute. It looks like the picture but I would probably should have gotten a size or two bigger. It's short. Very funny looking material almost like an underarmor workout shirt, I planned on wearing it with skinny jeans and booties and a long necklace but it's not long enough to do it, so I'll wear it as a swimsuit cover up. This product would be good if you get the right size. I would venture to say it's very shrinkable though."
2.0,"I opened up the package and the shirt smelled like diesel so bad, I hand washed it several times to get the smell out, it's an adorable shirt but it fits really small in the shoulders,arms and chest area, it's also not very long, you couldn't wear it with leggings.  It is a cute shirt tho, unfortunately I'll be sending it back smelling much cleaner."
2.0,These glasses do NOT help with nighttime glare.  I tried them and the headlights and stop lights still have halos.
2.0,"As reported by some other reviewers, the Velcro straps overlap too much on smaller feet.  They also allow the foot to slide to both sides so in the case of someone like my wife who does not have good control of her feet, they shoes did not work well at all - her feet were simply not held in place well enough.  The shoes might work ok for someone who has better control."
2.0,Very small had to give away
2.0,A bit big on top but otherwise nice
2.0,"The band is cute but the pins are too short for the watch, I should’ve read all the reviews before buying it because they all say the same thing."
2.0,"This worked so well. For a month. I had to go through 3 of these. First after a week the original one I ordered stopped working. It wouldn’t shock at all. I replaced it through Amazon, then 2 weeks later, that one stopped working. Later on I decided to go to the company, and was able to get a replacement that lasted 3 months. For the money, this was an extreme disappointment. I was hoping for a better quality product given the cost."
2.0,Came in the wrong colour.
2.0,"This bra is very lightweight with hardly any support. I wear a large in all sports bras, so I ordered a large in this one, but it’s unfortunately too big. There is no way to adjust it either. The padding is very thin as well. I wouldn’t order it again."
2.0,It fits but leaves openings in between buttons. Doesn’t fit as it displays.
2.0,Cap sleeve stuck out.  Fit vey odd
2.0,Love the diamonds! But I had one pair break and the 2nd is beginning to very soon (between the toes). Black wore off onto my feet.
2.0,Okay this shirt is super cute but I got a large and it fit as if I got an extra small. I’m guessing it came from China with these sizing. I’d recommend sizing 2 up from your usual size.
2.0,This bag is smaller and thinner than I had thought. I was hoping it had a nice wide base for carrying books. I guess the pictures don't really have a frame of reference so it was hard to visualize how large it was. I don't like it for my purposes.
2.0,I read the reviews and was excited about this purchase until it arrived. The neck hole is way small and this is not off the shoulder at all. I did order a larger size to get a big baggy loose feel. The elastic at the bottom of the shirt is pretty tight and uncomfortable. I also ordered the grey color and it looks more of a light tinted purple. It is just not what I expected.
2.0,"The material is really cheap polyester.  The drawstrings cinch up the sides, but not enough.  I am a C-cup and was putting way too much on display at the sides.  The waistline of this dress falls in a weird place where you either have to snug it up as high as you can (and move the waistline up) to get the coverage up top you need, or you have to push it low and tighten the straps within an inch of their lives.  Neither look is flattering so it is going straight back.<br /><br />The dress I got came with ""SMX"" on the tag instead of ""MRLZ"" so who knows what I received."
2.0,"Loved the pattern , but too small and hurts the neck and isnt that visible ..."
2.0,El tamaño no me gusta lo esperaba más grande
2.0,The large was almost like a xl.  Returned it.
2.0,The suit is literally see though. Except the white padding on the top. Which was so permanently crinkled that you could see the bulges in the area when I had it on. Not attractive!! Also ran small for being a 14.
2.0,"Based on other reviews I bought one size larger than normal (Medium vs Small). The shirt for fine, but lacked quality. Looks like a beginner sewing project—one thin layer, no extra stitches anywhere, boxy looking on top, etc. This does not look or feel like a $20 shirt—oh, and, this is a “professional dry clean recommended” shirt...probably because it would fall apart in a normal wash/dry cycle. Thankfully, this was a free return on Amazon!"
2.0,"I was pretty disappointed with the material and size. I ordered a large and am 5' 10&#34; and around 140 lbs. The dress was perfect length wise, but was awkwardly large in my bust area. I am fairly skinny, but have 40&#34; hips, so usually a large fits really well. I would definitely suggest a medium for tall girls with a bust a C or below, even if you have larger hips. The material is thin, so wearing an underskirt (1950's styled ones) and belt may improve the look, as well as the proper bra. Underwire ones are very visible through the dress, regardless of color of the bra."
2.0,Looked like dried weeds in the pendant. Returned and got refund.
2.0,"I ordered this dress in a medium based on the size chart. The length was great and it fit well in the waist. However the bust was strange and my boobs were not fitting in the designated area so o felt it looked odd. The straps were very restricting which made me uncomfortable. The material is very stretchy, and the color is nice. I ended up returning this dress because I did not feel like it was flattering based on the top half."
2.0,The large was too small for my locs. Couldn’t use them.
2.0,I couldn’t use the product. It’s too small with tags
2.0,They say one size fits all not the case if your a bigger girl I don’t recommend these
2.0,"Bought these for my daughter, she loved them the fit was perfect only complaint is these are VERY thin and see through.  She won’t be wearing these out of the house"
2.0,"I returned it as it did not fit me well. Also, the cloth did not seem very elegant."
2.0,"Beautiful, comfortable, but too small for the size we ordered! She was suponed to match with her sister and couldn’t and we Sis y have time to do an exchange. Just a bit disappointed!"
2.0,"A bit disappointed 3X self-claimed with 32.5cm but is ONLY 31.2cm. it doesn't fit 44EUR German Standard / Lloyd.<br /><br />QC issues are not first time through Amazon, did they Check up before verification to sale?"
2.0,Too small to read. Plan to return.
2.0,It looks good but the adjustment in the back flops around and slips loose. This makes the fit for the birds. I would not buy another.
2.0,i ordered an extra small and it was still too big... not even sure what size I actually got because nowhere on the dress or tags did it actually show the size.
2.0,Very weird length at the ankles. And super high wasted. If u lower the waist to try to compensate for the awkward ankle length then it gets baggy in the crotch.
2.0,Love the style but it's not a ankle bracelet it's to small
2.0,I like the way this fits. The white trim turned pink when washed alone on cold. I have washed it 3 times with to try and get the pink out but still pink. I haven’t worn it yet for this reason. Any other color would probably be fine.
2.0,"I liked the dress, but the buttons were too big for the hole or the hole was too small for the buttons."
2.0,The left pocket is sewn incorrectly so that it is not usable. The faulty sew job made it shallow and narrow. The fabric is a little thin but soft. They were cheap so I kept them but I don't think I would buy these again.
2.0,The finish scratched to easily.
2.0,Material is thin. Doesn’t wash well at all. Glad I paid less than $8.
2.0,"Absolutely beautiful money clip! The overall design is amazing and it’s slim in your pocket. I like the larger face design compared to traditional money clip as it protects your dollar bills from being chewed up in your pocket. My major complaint is that the item arrived fully tarnished! I know that this will happen with silver. I use the polishing cloth to wipe off all the excess tarnish. After I was done the money clip looked brilliant and perfect. However, the next day it was already tarnishing again. Not just a little bit but at least 25% of the money clip within 24 hours. By the end of the week the money clip is fully tarnished top to bottom. To maintain it’s brilliant finish I have to wipe the money clip down every day. I have a similar money clip from Vogt and I’ve never had to any maintenance on it. It’s such a same for such a beautiful product! I don’t plan to return it as I love the design, I just hate the maintenance!"
2.0,"Nowhere near the size I would’ve expected it to be.  No support whatsoever,  I think you would get the same support with a Band-Aid  And body tape... It’s more appropriate product for smaller chest individuals"
2.0,The shoe was a little smaller than what I expect but was cute.
2.0,"Very wide ""short"" shirt. Not longer like the picture shows. It's clearly an iron on. Not sure how long it will last. Shirt is on the thinner side. It is soft though."
2.0,Pretty but really really small.
2.0,"Too small, poor quality material"
2.0,It is smaller than I thought and looks cheap.
2.0,The clasp on one earring broke after only two uses. Don't know if it's due to poor quality or just a fluke earring.
2.0,not like description
2.0,"We ordered the small size to fit a child and were sent a larger one that will not fit her. Our daughter likes the print on it, but can’t wear it herself."
2.0,TOOOOO BIG AND HEAVY.
2.0,Fell apart within couple days - doesn’t have good hinge.  Nothing to hold together
2.0,Loved the color. Super comfortable...but it really needs the buttons to save your ears from the mask loops. Would be 5stars if it had buttons on the sides
2.0,This watch is difficult to set.  After trying multiple times I figured the crown does not have a distinct 2 position.
2.0,Too tight for my little ones knees and he isn't a chunky baby.
2.0,"My Wife is very upset, belcro its damage... I must fixed by my own ..."
2.0,loved the shoes but the sizing is wrong.  I bought one size up (9) for my son (whos currently a size 8) and they're way too small.
2.0,"Really cute, but not for daily use . These are something you can wear out but or for walking around in more than few minutes outside. The fur wears off to quick & not water proof ."
2.0,"The red color is very rich..but the sizing is a little off. This dress does not have a zipper so to wear it,  it was to go through your whole upper body. I wear a 4 and sometimes 6 but this dress was too small,  it was suffocating me while trying to put it on. I am 34B and the dress wouldn't go through comfortably. Returning it and will try the next size."
2.0,It only has 3 slots for CC. I am so sorry I could not see it better from the picture :(
2.0,Not a good quality. The package was poor and broken. The tip of the umbrella was fully exposed.
2.0,"Good seller and well timed shipping, but this hat leaves a lot to be desired. It seems very cheaply made. I would not recommend buying this product seems like it's probably made in China. I wouldn't even purchase if I had found it at a gas station."
2.0,The battery  died after only a week. The watch is alot cheaper and plastic looking than I thought it would be.
2.0,"Had really wanted to like this jacket, but its snagging zipper has driven me crazy !! You need to carry pliers to reliably get in and out of it .  Size is a bit small for an XL."
2.0,"5 out of the 6 are just what I wanted. The sixth pair with the lion unfortunately came in considerably smaller than all the others and the elastic band on one of the socks came ripped. I’m not happy that I can’t use one of the pairs. It seems like they need some quality control on their products. That being said the cartoon designs on them are cute! If the sixth one had been right I would have been happy with my purchase, but as it stands I will not be ordering from them again."
2.0,"They don’t stay on your ear, they would give you a hard time."
2.0,This item was a gift/ was not satisfy...  Very inexpensive looking!!!
2.0,It's hard to even make out what they are.
2.0,"These glasses look great on, but only lasted me maybe 3 weeks before they broke."
2.0,"This mask is extremely thin. I read the reviews, I now think that they wrote those reviews for themselves."
2.0,Agree with another reviewer that these feel to be more polyester than merino wool.
2.0,These are very pretty. They don't fit in the holes of my ears. The stem is to thick.
2.0,"You get what you pay for.<br />This same exact wallet from a different, more expensive company lasted me like two years (and still is lasting but I wanted a different color). This ones metal is horrible. The zipper broke three days after I bought it (not filled btw) and then the metal holding the strap broke off so I have to hold it instead of using the strap which is why I wanted it."
2.0,I sent it back. It was to small and the arm holes are way to big my bra showed.
2.0,Very cheap material. The hook was very hard to open.
2.0,Material is a bit scratchy but ultimately this ran way way small.  Even with the sizing chart they give it ran small.
2.0,"The beanies were okay, I guess I'd have more to say about them, except that I was distracted by the fact that there was a live cockroach in my package. Absolutely disgusting."
2.0,it would be nice if both socks were the same size not even worth sending back
2.0,"I’m 5’2 120lbs, ordered size small. The overall fit was ok, just to skin tight for my likings."
2.0,"i love the design, it is very pretty but the product unfortunately didn't hold up well. the threads have started to unravel after one week and the strap on the top has broken. i'll have to figure out how to sew it back on. the seller did issue a refund since a replacement couldn't be made through Amazon. the design and look is sexy and comfortable."
2.0,Clasp very hard to open and close.
2.0,"These are tiny.........for babies  Should not be advertised for women. They are for young girls.  I was disappointed and felt they were way overpriced.  As an adult, I will not be wearing them."
2.0,"I should have sent it back, not their fault. I thought it was going to be flat, It was Square and too bulky for my taste."
2.0,Thought the decal was not as brilliant as pictured and material very thin
2.0,"Immediately opened the package when it arrived and was disappointed to find a strong moth ball scent coming from the laynard, can't stand the awful smell. The design is nice but wishing the zipper was an actual zipper to keep change in. Highly underwhemled with this product, would not recommend unless you want to carry around the scent of moth balls"
2.0,"Didn't come with connecting pins, the ones that connect the band to watch."
2.0,The band construction is cheesy and the latch catches on everything So looked forward to receiving but truly disappointed
2.0,Cheaply made but beautiful. The chain broke on the necklace the day I wore it- I love the way it looks but the stones wont lay flat agains my neck and keep flipping.
2.0,"It started out as a good concept, however, after washing it (following the manufactures instructions) it “shed” all over everything and the lining became a mess. More research needed."
2.0,I was disappointed that this shirt felt more like a Halloween costume fabric than flannel. Poorly made.
2.0,Run small and are on the lower waisted side.
2.0,i  disliked them becasuee  they would not stay clipped  yet they are great looking on!
2.0,"To start with, the wife is normally a size small, 34B, size 4. We read that the suit runs small so we ordered up a size to a medium. The top was still too small and pushed up and inward, but was too narrow at the same time. The bottom was very big in the front, but only slightly big in the back. The front (no matter how it was tied) was cut almost like portly pants. There was about a two inch gap between my wife's waist and the waist of the suit. This bikini is just cut weird."
2.0,"Nicely made but they stretch out and if your calves aren't super thin, they loose their shape"
2.0,The mask looks nothing like picture.  Although everyone laughs when they see it.. I was not thinking it would make me look so stupid.. I just wanted to have a smile that wasn't scary\funny\stupid.  Oh well
2.0,"The citrine stones that I received were mostly white, with very little yellow in them.  Some were chipped.  I can only use a couple stones for my needs.  I'm very disappointed."
2.0,Mala  experiencia cuando lo puse  en hora sr me salio el segundero
2.0,color and graphic is great but the fit is like spandex and is not flattering unless you have abs of steel
2.0,"True to size and cut, but the saturation of the gems in the photo is very misleading. This might was we'll be a clear gem stone. Don't purchase. I'll live with it, I mean what can you expect for buying jewelry for less than $100?!"
2.0,"The inseam was too short. Also without having an opening in the front, like real jeans, I felt like I was doing battle to try to slink it on."
2.0,Incredibly small.  I bought these for my son going into first grade.....no shot of getting it on his face. It fits my 1.5 y/o daughter or maybe a large orange.
2.0,"Fit okay, wont purchase again though"
2.0,"I ordered this twice, sized up three sizes - still too small. You can’t have a single curve to put this on much less wear it"
2.0,"Loved it when I got it, but it fell apart after about a month. The stitching came undone very easily."
2.0,I wanted to love this! It was so cute and the description was just what I was looking for. But when it came - I was disappointed! I bought a 36B and the band itself fit well (at the tightest setting) but the cups were just way to big and the straps which are NOT adjustable are way too long. The fabric is stiff and doesn't feel like it will breath well - I just can't imagine working out in it comfortably.
2.0,The length of the shoe is fine but the width is too wide.
2.0,IT LOOKED CHEAP AND WAS NOT AS BIG AS THE PICTURE LOOKS. SENT IT BACK .
2.0,The torso is too long.
2.0,Unfortunately I didn't notice the white parts of this skirt were COMPLETELY and I mean...COMPLETELY see through until I got to work. So that was fun. It's very pretty and has a nice look other than that.
2.0,Not nearly as heat proof or resistant as advertised so be prepared for a hot hand as you move coals or logs around even if the gloves themselves did not burn
2.0,I got two left earrings so my right ear doesn't look right.
2.0,"The desciption needs to be changed to PU leather, NOT LEATHER!  this is wrong!!!!"
2.0,Ordered 3 shirts and they all had a horrible smell coming out of packet. They seem to hold odor.
2.0,bottom too plush so foot kept falling off to the side - wore them for 15 minutes and then tossed them to keep from keeping ankle injury
2.0,It is advertised as adjustable- but not even close to fitting a 7-7/8 size head. I returned it
2.0,"Great set of plugs, especially for the price. Only complaint is that I only received 14 pairs. The product is listed as 18 pairs."
2.0,Tela de muy mala calidad hilos sobre saliendo y se tardo más de la fecha indicada pésimo servicio
2.0,These 2 pairs fit totally different. Both were on the bigger side and not very high wasted so there wasn't much tummy control. One pair fit like it was low rise and didn't even cover all of my backside. Not a good fit at all.
2.0,Can't see out of these things at all. Constantly have to move and tilt head to focus because they will not stay in place. Keeps sliding down nose. Not durable. Lenses are huge like oversized sunglasses.
2.0,"Fits very small. I'd advise ordering at least 1 bigger than you think. If your a solid medium, get a large.  I'm returning it.<br />Otherwise, good quality, seems sturdy and pretty. Disappointed it doesn't come in a bigger size."
2.0,"Ordered a 3xl... says 3xl... actual size is 1xl... WTF? Who do you think you're kidding? Nice shirt, just horrible sizing."
2.0,"It ran very small, although it's cute."
2.0,"Barely covered my nips...let alone the rest of my boobs.  The bottoms I ordered were supposed to have ruffles and did not.  Cute bathing suit, just not for the curvy gals."
2.0,"I ordered a light color, so I can't speak to the darker styles, but these definitely did not pass the black underwear test. I also noticed that if I bent over the top of the leggings would roll over, which would be annoying doing repetitive bending exercises like dead lifts.<br /><br />I'm 5'5'' and 125 lbs and the small fit well. The fabric was comfortable and I like the design, but I will not be repurchasing."
2.0,"Silver perforated. My foot is a size 9-1/2 but since often hard to find, I just buy 10, so these should fit perfectly but they do not. At all. They were uncomfortable even sitting and as soon as I stood up, my toes were smashed up against the front where I can feel the stitching and my toes wanted to bust out. Since no 10-1/2 and I think 11 would look like boats, I have to return. Don’t understand all the “too large” reviews, but I guess each style is different."
2.0,First magnet came off. Glued it back on.<br />Then elastic band broke off.  Didn't last 6 months!
2.0,This white case looked pink so I give it to my better half.
2.0,"Image was very blurry, not clear."
2.0,I hate to say it but this thing is hideous. I'm 5'9 and 1/2 and 140 lbs but it looks like I'm wearing a tent. It's very wide from chest to lower waist. Just looks boxy and awful. Arms are kind of short. I normally wear a small and tops but ordered a medium and definitely ill-fitting.
2.0,"The fabric was much thinner than I expected and the liner was sewn tightly and ended at the bottom of my butt, so it wasn't very comfortable. Returning it."
2.0,"I'm disappointed in this necklace because the three stones are so tiny you can barely see them. If you're into subtle or ""barely there"" jewelry you may like it, but I found the pendant so delicate and small that it seems better made for a child. The worse thing is that the chain is easily tangled - it came all tied up in a bunch and it took me awhile to untangle it. The best thing about this item is the faux blue leather zippered case the necklace came in - I actually like it better than the necklace!"
2.0,"I’m 5’11, 178 lbs I ordered  large<br />Not slim fit and it gets to baggy trough out the day<br />Stretches, one wash n sleeves shrink"
2.0,Maybe my feet are just too big but these arent for me.  They constantly slide down.
2.0,This dress does not flatter my body at all.  It isnt as form fitting as I was hoping for.  The material is pretty thin and not as stretchy as I would like.  Its that somewhat stretchy stuff but not the really nice stretcy stuff.  I wouldnt buy this to wear out.
2.0,"I ordered  this for my daughter, but as soon as I took it out of the package I could tell that it was very see through. I ordered the white with sunflowers. Returned."
2.0,"Not great at all, fabric very thin, does not look like on the photos, cut seems awkward."
2.0,The reviews that talk about these glass being attractive are absolutely right. They are very nice looking & the packaging/accessories well above average. However I have a pretty good sized head & these things stood a good inch or two off of the sides of my head. Way way awkward looking. Returned them.
2.0,Cheap. Small. Flimsy.
2.0,Didn’t like the inside of the fabric . Scratchy and hard seems
2.0,Item too small needs to be made larger
2.0,it is way too short!!! the picture shows touching the hips it doesnt even come to my belly button
2.0,Way too small.  Buttons pulled.
2.0,"I ordered this for my daughter's wedding (the mothers of bride and the groom were to wear gold) but when it arrived it was much smaller and lighter weight than it appears in the photo.<br /><br />It was a bit more like a large sheer kerchief as opposed to an actual ""wrap shawl"" or real cover-up. It is also very sheer - I think it appears less so because it's draped over a mannequin/bodice.<br /><br />It was also a little more metallic gold (a little bit garish) in color when I needed a softer gold. I ended up buying a lovely gold mesh light weight 'over jacket' from Chico's and it worked perfectly with my outfit!<br /><br />I hope to return the ""Wrap Shawl"" for a refund."
2.0,Super thin fabric! They fit as I expected to be which is slightly smaller than the chart. I would not buy these again. The fabric is way too thin to wear these outside the house.
2.0,Delivered super late was uncomfortable and big
2.0,Dress was nice but definitely only for bathing suit cover up as it is see through
2.0,The black one not the jet black one is actually silver with a gray headband so the manufacture should probably change the color to Silver instead of black...
2.0,Quality of the material was subpar!
2.0,Does not clean silver jewelry. I used as directed - did not remove tarnish.
2.0,"A size too big and went past my feet! Did not look like the picture, disappointing."
2.0,Super cheap material for the cost. Have worn it twice so far to go out to dinner at a casual restaurant and the cuffs and bottom are already fraying. Don't recommend.
2.0,Too big and they feel and look cheap
2.0,"I think it's super cute but just like other reviews the boob part is wayyyyyy too big. If you can sew u can fix it! I'm a size 12 and the body part fit nicely and I have massive boobs so I was like, ok I'll get it but I have triple d boobs and there's so much room left it's weird."
2.0,It would have been nice if the product came without a black stain and strings hanging. You need to do better.
2.0,The waist band is very comfortable. Thats where the good stops. There is a large seam that runs right up the backside. Its not even flat stitched. It gives you a permenant wedgie. The legs bunch up almost instantly
2.0,I ordered the sweatshirt larger than normal to have it oversized. The texture is like a thick t-shirt not at all like a sweatshirt. The print is tacky and not sewen on. I would personally not but this.
2.0,The back that is inside of your nose is to big you can see it
2.0,Disappointed.  After just a few wearing the sole is breaking up the the finish is pealing off.  :(
2.0,The mesh is a really thin fabric and rips very easy!!
2.0,"My sister got this for me and yes, it is very pretty, but it is not stainless steel. It turned my neck green."
2.0,I purchased this as a pick me up after having a bone marrow biopsy. I'm very disappointed that IT DID NOT LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE WHEN IT ARRIVED!!! The ends were supposed to be ROSE GOLD and they're not. I'm in to much pain to return it.
2.0,"This product was such poor quality. This is like... $3 at the swap meet quality. I'm a bra size 34C. My gut told me to order a large just for comfort's sake, but the sizing chart said that would be a medium, and the ratings were mostly ""true to size"" so I ordered a medium. The bralette fit me once I shimmied into it (several minutes and rug burns later) as it gives no stretch to come over my shoulders. Never have I felt more self conscious, I felt like Mike Tyson getting into a tu-tu. It stagged on my nails and everything it touched as I shimmied into it. An extremely uncomfortable experience.  It was kinda cute when it was on, it fit my breasts and band regions... but it's not $19 dollars cute."
2.0,Color fades after the first wash.
2.0,"This is a beautiful case but it is very hard to.press down on the side buttons to control power buttons and volume control. Also the phone charger port cover is not good. Once used the port stays open and does not close; it hasnt broken off yet, but it will soon due to poor quality."
2.0,Love this band but it is extremely difficult to size.  My wrist are small so I’d to remove a lot of links.  The tool it comes with is horrible and broke! So I wasn’t able to size it.  I am planning on taking it to a jeweler to have them do it.
2.0,The necklace looks nicer in the picture.. No earrings in box. Disappointed.
2.0,The cups of suit are molded and very large.  Best for big busted gals.
2.0,"Very cute little charm, but it doesn’t last. A couple of stones went missing in a few days and the loop at the top just broke after only a month or so.<br />It looked good on our little Jack Russell/Chihuahua mix, but just doesn’t hold up."
2.0,Nice lens very cheap frames a bad buy
2.0,returned because of quality and fit
2.0,"For reference I’m 5’4” and about 140-145lbs and I ordered a large based on other reviews. (I’m curvy in all the right places with a smaller waist). I really wanted to love the skirt because I’ve been looking for a similar style to wear with knee boots and sweaters but unfortunately there were a few major problems. 1) the hem is unfinished and very uneven 2) the sizing is wonky 3) the larger you go in size the less flattering. Especially on shorter frames like mine.<br /><br />So beware and know that if you order this skirt you will need to size up, plus not care about the fact that the hem is unfinished. My opinion is this is more of a costume skirt and not something for every day wear.<br /><br />Sadly I ordered 2 different styles from this same company, I also got the one that had the brownish buttons down the front (WDIRAR Women’s Elegant High Waist Button Front Flared Skirt) but they were both exactly the same with the uneven unfinished hems."
2.0,"Made exactly the same as every other Chinese brand on here -- same ""XXL"" stitched in single thread label and lack of typical US labeling (cotton, wash instructions, etc). I ordered expecting it to run 2 sizes too small, and ordered an XXL, expecting a typical Large. Really need an XXXL for a Large. To put this into perspective, I'm 6' tall and 220 lbs. I normally fit a L nice and snugly, or XL loosely. The XXL is about a typical US medium."
2.0,The cut was strange. All the buttons to connect the overlapping portion of the shirt made it difficult to get on. The overlapping portion was cut smaller than the inner portion of the shirt - making the shirt bunch up even though this was the right size for me. Just a very awkward cut. Material was also not worth the price paid for. I returned.
2.0,Garbage. The “high quality” metal button snapped off literally seven minutes after getting them. Never even got to wear them
2.0,"They look nice, but do nothing to driving at night. Not a better driving experience at night"
2.0,It's a cute skirt but the strap feel useless and doesn't even reach. My boots hold it up fine with no straps but still just feels off. I'm going to put a  2nd strap on it myself.
2.0,These pants are not even close to being the size that is advertised.  So beware order at least 2 sizes up
2.0,And the martial is cheap!
2.0,This dress looks much better on the model. Works as a swimsuit cover up or PJ's.
2.0,"The fit was great, but this dress is COMPLETELY see-thru. I didn't have the time to order a slip so I returned it. Cute dress, but very thin material."
2.0,"I was excited for this shirt, but it runs a few sizes too small. I will have to return it."
2.0,"Attractive enough and substantial enough (as cheap sunglasses go) BUT a bit small for my face, so that the biofocal portion of the lenses were positioned inside my normal sweet-spot for reading thru lenses.  Worse, the magnification  (2.0) seems off. . . not as strong as the handful of other 2.0 readers I have in use.  Gave me eyestrain driving.  Returning .  Will try a more expensive pair that allows for sizing to a broad face."
2.0,Not tru to size but very easy return
2.0,Somewhat smaller! More bulky at waist than free flowing. Runs a bit smaller. Need to order a bigger size than usual.
2.0,"Material is nice and overall I love the look of the coat.  This being said, I'm 5' 11&#34; and about 195 pounds.  This coat is quite snug on my biceps and shoulders.  I ordered a XXL. Also there are no inside pockets and if you have big hands they won't fit in the outside pockets either.  I wore the coat for 1 day and have noticed the pockets are ripping and the seams tearing by the outside pocket.  I will be returning this coat and start searching for another."
2.0,It was tight in the sleeves
2.0,"Very thin, nearly transparent material. Total waste of $."
2.0,"First off, these feel worse than a toy. I have to fight to get these to open up and close back down, with the entire thing bending like it's about to break every time. I've bought cheaper glasses straight from china for half the price that felt monumentally better.<br /><br />I also didn't see much advantage to using these when driving at night. Highbeams are still annoying enough to try to constantly avoid, though slightly less annoying than before. I couldn't make out any details any better than normal, and saw no overall advantage to wearing these.<br /><br />There was one possible use I noticed with these, however, which is them acting like blue light filtering glasses. When driving late at night, these may help you sleep better by blocking out the blue light on your drive home, helping your body produce melatonin without being bombarded with bright white and blue lights from other cars and street lights.<br /><br />The product itself is extremely simple, a frame with a tinted pair of lenses. With so many competitors, I would try another one, since these feel so cheap. The case is decent, but the glasses themselves feel slightly better than something you'd find at a dollar store."
2.0,"I wanted mittens to keep my fingers warmer than my gloves do. With these, my fingers were cold during a 40 minute walk at 40° and light wind. Also the knit already looks somewhat ratty after one wear. I will return.<br />I don't know why people say they run small. I have average size hands and they were a bit big!"
2.0,"I would have loved this dress, fits true to size however the dress I received had multiple holes in it! Also the blue is not even close to the same shade of blue pictured. Still a pretty blue but wasn’t what I was expecting. Would have kept it if it wasn’t defective! VERY wrinkly material as well."
2.0,"I almost loved this cover-up--but how it looked and fit were so different from the listing and pictures that I couldn't. First, this is not white. It's  ivory. I don't wear ivory, especially not in a garment like this. Only bright white would make it stand out as it should  Second, the description said the girth/total circumference was 66"". This garment is WAY smaller than that  I would advise only the  truly slender to buy this.Lastly, this garment, in person, looks very, very different in terms of workmanship as compared to the photos. It is not the ultra-refined, breath-taking, ultra-lovely blouse that the listing pages show it as. IF this was just made according to couture sewing techniques, and bleached ultra-white in the manufacturing process, only then would this blouse be what it should"
2.0,Strap is much thinner and feels cheaper than others I have purchased on amazon
2.0,There is no way this product will fit me now.<br /><br />Sinclair.
2.0,The size on this garment was not right.
2.0,"Pretty colors but doesn’t fit my Apple Watch 7 which has a 45mm face, and the package says 42/44mm, returning"
2.0,Good fit and all but still fogs up on me so i cant see much once that happens
2.0,"I loved this dress, and it fit ok, a little loose in weird places. The pleating looked like someone just stuck a sea shell bra on me."
2.0,Did not fit my body type. I'm bummed. It's such a cute dress.  The v goes lower that picture shows but maybe it's just me~
2.0,No doubt that it is a good t-shirt but it not an compression shirt!!! Very unhappy
2.0,I was so excited about this dress. Unfortunately the neckline is way too big and it falls down and shows my daughter's chest. Makes it look like it doesn't fit right.
2.0,Was not was expected.  Top was way too long and the bottoms were way too small.  Looked like cheeky underwear
2.0,Cute idea but this dress had some issues. I bought an XL based on the size chart but the waist was a couple inches too big. I’m 5’ 7” 160lb. Also the lining was also mesh so pretty see through. I could even feel air through the dress when I was moving around. So I guess wear nude underwear and don’t stand in any sunny doorways. The embroidery was pretty and construction seemed fine but the other problems led me to return it.
2.0,"Quality feels very cheap, finishings poor"
2.0,Very thin fabric. Wrinkles VERY easily.
2.0,"Small , cutting off blood circulation!"
2.0,"Started having problems in the first month & has continued to fall apart. The chain broke, the finish peeled off, it doesn't keep time consistently."
2.0,You definitely need to order a size up.
2.0,I was pretty disappointed about the fact that I ordered it because it was a marine corps necklace that said marine corps on it.  I was upset that when it was delivered 5 days before my sisters bday the center emblem was cut uneven and you couldn’t even see the words that said marine corps
2.0,"Looks nice, but last ONLY three months."
2.0,Just wore these today for the first time and the seam has already torn and I have a big hole near the crotch area now. I could probably sew them but just bummed that this happened within the first hour of wearing them.
2.0,Item was pretty but broke the day before an important event(worn 2x)
2.0,Apparently army green is grey
2.0,This dress fit extremely small.  I would recommend ordering a size or two up.
2.0,Pretty cheap but you get what you pay for. The designs dont look good. But they are comfortable
2.0,pretty cheaply made
2.0,"Worked great for just over a year - very quiet motor... then gradually stopped working. now its a great lockable watch case but without a working motor, I have to wind my watch every time I put it on... I guess youc can say now the motor is even quieter"
2.0,"I was pretty excited for these for Christmas.  Sadly, I do not like these at all.  First off, I would order up.  These run very small and run low in the back area.  I wear a 2x in all of my leggings, and I could not get these on.  If you do have any stretch in the fabric, it turns white and you can see through it.  So, even if you can get them to fit but they are stretched, you will not want to wear them.  I personally do not want my leggings loose and would not wear them for just the design."
2.0,"Bought the shoes for a snow storm, upon receiving the shoes they never came in a box and one of the shoes were scruff up on top and the right sole on the inside feels work whereas the left sole on the inside feels new. I wanted a brand new pair of shoes, definitely not what I expected"
2.0,I bought the dark blue dress.  It's cute but extremely see through and there's a slit up the sides that make it too reveling its also an xxl but fits like a us L . Unfortunately probably will never wear but not worth returning.
2.0,"These shoes would've been great for football season.  They are very tight.  If you have narrow feet these would fit, but regular and wide sizes they don't fit.  I had to return them."
2.0,Didn’t last longer than a week. “Diamonds” fell out immediately. Would NOT recommend.
2.0,This shirt shrink from a XXL down to smaller than a Large.
2.0,"I'm actually sad to post this review. I love the design of these shoes, however, as others have indicated, the quality does not live up to the price. My daughter has had these just over 2 months, she does not wear them every day, probably around 3 days a week, but the insoles on both shoes have already torn, making she shoes bumpy on the inside and uncomfortable to wear. So cute, but definitely not worth the price tag."
2.0,It's an OK dress but the fabric wore into that crappy half terrycloth cheap cotton after 3 washes.
2.0,The swimsuit was too small and there was no invoice to return it....so looks like I'm stuck with it..My ratings would be 1/2 star
2.0,Pretty dress but runs extremely small. Size 20 ordered- is about size 12-14!
2.0,"It was an okay product, I didn't like the fact that it changed after a while, and the cuff kept dropping off my ear. It was painful to adjust the clamp tight enough so it'd stay on. But you get what you pay for."
2.0,It is too big for me and it is always upside down.
2.0,The letters are falling off after only two weeks
2.0,These look nice but they ripped the first time my cousin wore them
2.0,"Order at least two sizes larger than you would usually wear, these are extremely small."
2.0,One pair came wrong: one sock R2D2 the other Storm Trooper...
2.0,"The adjustable strapping broke off one side of one of the bracelets before I got the chance to wear it. This has happened to the others after wearing them less than 10 times. However, this is a very inexpensive set of bracelets, so you get what you pay for; some of them are cute.The browns of the other bracelets are too close to black to actually wear with black without appearing to others to be color blind."
2.0,"i was excited to finally get this bag, don't get me wrong it's a super cute bag and it's a perfect size but when i received it the strap immediately fell off. maybe i just received a faulty one but i didn't feel like returning it and waiting for a new one so i had to super glue it in which it tore off again lol it's an over all really cute bag though and if it weren't for that incident i would rate r 5 stars."
2.0,"This bag is cute but really too small to carry anything.  It looks larger in the photos.<br /><br />Also, don't know where to put this, exactly, but it was delivered to the wrong house.  I had to ask my neighbors if they had seen it."
2.0,"This band is very nice and seems to be made well.  However, it is no where near the red color in the picture.  It is actually a deep burgundy color.  Disappointed in color!"
2.0,"Product came on time and well packed. It fits as expected and got the leggins in black, brown and grey. I came out of emergency surgery two weeks ago so i ordered these leggins because i could. Ot wear super tight things arround my surgery.  I used my first pair a week after surgery and the brown pai...as soon as i put it on...bom they get a hole! Not very happy about them ....then i try the gray and black pair and they were ok but this is my 3rd time wearing the grey and black and they seem to be a little thinner right before the waist band and then i figured that is why the other kne messed up....."
2.0,I'll have to update this.  I just realize I submitted a review for this dress on another dress. Either way I will say that the bust for this dress is FULL FRONTAL OPEN! I had to sew together about 5 inches of it to make it wearable for me (36G- ordered XL). Otherwise it is open for 12 inches from basically your belly button to your neck (see measuring tape in photo). Unless you are a seamstress I would not recommend buying this. I gave it such low stars because of the amount of work I had to put into It to make it wearable.  Otherwise the dress is incredibly  beautiful and Seems well made.
2.0,"These pants have the dreaded back flap that sticks out. You know, because the waist is too wide. And they're painfully tight against my knees when I sit down. These pants would fit someone with really skinny legs and a waist that is the same size as their hips and butt. And as I struggled getting the button through the hole."
2.0,Feels light and cheap but gets the job done
2.0,"Way diferente than the picture. The bottom are like bell bottoms, and the distressed are on odd pleases. Practically next to each other."
2.0,The color faded after only a week. I do like it a great deal but wish the color had lasted.
2.0,"It looks very comfortable to see, but after washing a few times can not wear, covered with hair ball ..."
2.0,"Overall the top was cute and pretty nice quality which is why I’m giving it 2 stars but sizing is all wrong , I got a medium and it was pretty big . I’m a 34 C chest and my boobs did not fill it out at all. Had to tie the back to make it fit right but overall I know I’m not a size small let alone an xsmall (which if I want the shirt to fit I might have to get an xsmall) so I’m returning it , won’t be getting another size."
2.0,Like the top but the chemicals used to dye it have an extremely strong odor even after washing. Hoping after a few more washes it will not be noticeable.
2.0,"Cheap material, cheap zipper."
2.0,"Ordered this dress for my 10 yr old daughters birthday party, it fits my 5 year old daughter..."
2.0,"Watchband seemed quite well made, and sturdy, but it didn't fit my husband's Casio g-shock. I mean, we tried everything short of breaking out a hammer to fit that joker in the slot, and it simply would not go."
2.0,"Not comfortable in toe, and they run small.  Size 11 shoe, ordered XL, they fit more like a Medium."
2.0,I ordered this dress for my daughter to wear to her galaxy themed birthday party and it was WAY too small.  I ordered according to the sizing chart but it was no where close.  It was also the largest child size so we ended up having to get a full refund.  I've always been hesitant to order clothes from Amazon where the sizing seems to be all over the place and this seemed to confirm my concerns.
2.0,"These are super cute, but I guess I am learning you get what you pay for.  I had a good experience with the seller refunding my money, but a poor experience with the glasses.  The lens coating started to bubble up around the frames about a month or 2 after I bought them.  It proceeded to become worse and more visible, so that it appears there are strange rings on the lenses.  Aside from that I really loved the light feeling and the cute style.  I am, however, on the hunt for a new pair of glasses that will last."
2.0,"I'm sending this back because the terry cloth is not soft at all. Some people might feel differently, but I'm looking for something soft enough for a kid with eczema. I'd say 'meh' on quality."
2.0,The canvas upper is NOT breathable!!! It is lined in POLYESTER.  Thats PLASTIC and plastic HOLDS your foot heat. Great if its winter but I want toe cover that DOES breathe.  These do not.<br />Rip off.  🤮🤮🤮
2.0,Perfect weight for summer. Two pairs fit nicely but one was too small and marked same L size. Have to return all 3 if returning but I needed the other 2 immediately so I was stuck.
2.0,Neck is way too big
2.0,"Always order XL for my son since he needs the length.  He’s 5’11 and this is extremely short on him. Size is good, but he only wears it around the house since it only goes to his waist :("
2.0,These are no less no-show than my other socks. I was disappointed. They still show with flats.
2.0,"Was hoping it was a sphere, didn't realize it was flat."
2.0,"I can't speak to the durability of the suit because when it arrived, it was so small and uncomfortable that it had to be returned. I carefully checked the sizing guide and measured my 7 year old and ordered size 8 accordingly. Nevertheless, when it came it was a struggle to get the top on and the bottom was too small as well. My kid wears a size 7-8 in most pants, swimsuits, and underpants and a size 26 in her competition swimsuit. This suit is just crazy small. Also, not visible in the picture is a draw string present in both top and bottom pieces of the suit. The tie for the drawstring is right up front and creates an uncomfortable bump in the middle."
2.0,Very tight around the leg.
2.0,Short was super cheap! Can’t wear it cause it rolls above my nipples and ends up at my damn neck<br />No joke!
2.0,The top is the only piece that came!!! Is the bottom coming?
2.0,Looks like a nightgown Or bathing suit cover. Wouldn't wear it out. Material wrinkles.
2.0,I feel the product was to big and flowy. Was not flattering on the body.
2.0,"The material is horrendous.  The color, shape, fit, etc etc. .... are ALL amazing.  But the material feels like sandpaper.  It's so bizarre.  For the price they're selling them for, not worth it.  Now if they say they're made out of recycled material or bamboo ... then I'm all about it.  But they're super scratchy.  and probably hella flammable now that I think of it.  It's like thick paper that's been treated into a cotton like material. super bizarre."
2.0,"No magnetic strength,<br />Dissappointed"
2.0,"I wore this dress 3 times and it was very cute, comfortable, flowy - just what I was looking for. The strength of the adjustable straps and the seam that connects them to the dress is very feeble, it broke while in the washing machine. I'd like to order another one, but I wouldn't want to gamble on this happening again."
2.0,I did not receive a free gift it was wadded in a knot when I got it
2.0,"This fits extremely small, looks likeni have to lose some weight to enjoy this"
2.0,"The dress was a nice fit, but this dress is not grey. This dress is black and white."
2.0,"Really cute earrings, but not wearable. The backs that come with these are too loose and they don't stay on. I even bought different earring backs that are supposed to be more secure - but because the length of these earrings is so short, putting on a more secure back makes the earrings way too tight on my earlobes. Huge disappointment."
2.0,The product came in and is smaller than expected to wrap around the body to give the look that’s in the picture. Don’t recommend for curvy women of the world. :)
2.0,The flowers don't lay on the material as they should. Poorly made.
2.0,Bought a 2x and it’s big enough in the body but the arms holes are very small did not fit
2.0,"I am 5'2 and 138 pounds, 36&#34; bust 28&#34; waist 40&#34; hip. I ordered a medium. The dress was too big and way too long. This would look great on a tall person. Not to great on a short person."
2.0,Runs small in shoulder area
2.0,Too dowdy looking! I will not wear it.
2.0,"These are decent enough, especially for the price, but they are so, so small. If you have anything above a 50th % 6 month old, they probably won't fit too well."
2.0,"I was hesitant to order this bracelet as it is expensive and didn’t look very substantial. I was drawn to the style and color so ordered anyway. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed when it arrived. The bracelet is very narrow, the heart very tiny, and the pyrite stone barely visible. It could have easily been 4 stars if they had increased the size of everything on this bracelet."
2.0,"Not sure what the material was for this legging, fit was ok, true to size however, did not quite like the legging material, it was rough."
2.0,Seams started seperating within 2 weeks so bern hand sewing back together as needed
2.0,"Don't like the product,  in the pictures of the items they look better and not so dull. The items fit, I don't like that are dull and just look dirty"
2.0,they were huge. i returned them
2.0,The dress runs smaller
2.0,"I thought I was ordering a decent project, but it's been six months and the holes in rubber on the band have broken through I have only two holes left on the band and they are the very last two which causes the watch moving all over my arm. I'm looking for another now."
2.0,Size is kind of small
2.0,Too heavy. Too big. Is more gold than rose gold.  I don't like it
2.0,Eh! Not what I expected.
2.0,The design doesn’t suit take into account that some women have wider and rounded bottom. This design is more suitable for slender ladies. Unflattering to anyone who are size US14 and above. Certainly not for ladies with mommy tummy and wider hips. Unflattering.
2.0,Heavier than I prefer but cute
2.0,After purchase I washed this before I used it.  It looked like I had it about a year. Poor quality material and workmanship.
2.0,I thought these would be good for my daughter because she has sensitive ears but the really bother her !! Disappointed because they are beautiful.
2.0,"These looked so promising when I searched for long tank tops, however they are very short and when you raise your hands above your head, exect that your fubpa is going to come out and say hello!  I would not recommend for any girls that are looking to cover their most vulnerable tummy issues, this is not for you."
2.0,"Once you put socks on,  you could barely read it. The material is very thin and the socks fit tight. I purchased these for my mother who wears a size 9 shoe and they were tight on her and the message was all stretched out and not even on the bottom of her foot. The manufacturer could correct this issue but using thicker material and offering different sizes versus a one size fits all."
2.0,"Not exactly as expected.  As I am 6'2"" tall & ~190#, the XL is too large & the L appears to be too small.  I'm an in between size apparently.  The jacket pockets, or at least what appears to be pockets, are non-existent.  It is merely a strip of white ""fluff"" sewn onto the outside of the jacket.  The material is ""ok"" at best.  I guess I'm expecting a bit too much from a $40 item.  Rated as Average, at best.....  The pants do have an elastic band & belt loops so I can run a belt through them to cinch them in place.  Consider this a very costume-like item.  Not really something you would want to wear to a festive, dapper holiday office party unless you can get by with a cheap feeling/looking ""suit"""
2.0,Material was heavy and felt like thick silk. I'm very worried it will rip. Too loose... looks cheap. Flower pattern is different then in the picture... looks very cheap. You're getting your money's worth.
2.0,Very cute belt for the price but the color of the belt in the picture is darker than the belt I received which was lighter and more orangish. I kept because it's cute enough to wear with other clothing but doesn't match what I intended to wear it with
2.0,"The shirt has a nice design and really soft. The material seems to be prone to forming fuzz.<br />The stitching is horrible. After wearing for roughly 10 times, the stitching started to loosen and long threads began to hang from the sleeves. In the armpits, there are two holes. Not worth buying unless you are into patching the holes. Not meant to last long.<br />Will return."
2.0,Junk cotton. Neck too tight. Spose that’s why it only costs 15$
2.0,"I ordered a larger size hoping they would be a looser fit. Top part was baggy, mid section was really tight.<br />If you have a very small waist and large chest they would be a good buy, colors are nice."
2.0,No way was this shirt a 3X! Sizing chart incorrect.
2.0,"While watch band whether it be leather or Twist o Flex by Speidel need to be fully researched prior<br />to making the order.  I failed to accurately determine the size properly, and so, I will be starting over.<br />Motto is, measure twice, order once!"
2.0,Poor quality!!!
2.0,Belt had bubbles and cracks!
2.0,Nice design but it tarnished pretty badly
2.0,"The dress is cute and seems to be well made, however it definitely doesn't look like what I ordered. I'm pretty let down, but the sweet girl I ordered it for, likes it, thankfully."
2.0,The lenses are too thin. The size is correct but the lenses move around because they are not thick enough to fit correctly into the ridges on the frame.
2.0,"The smell of this was horrible. A very very strong chemical smell, and I hope it will wash out or I will have to throw them away. I could not stand smelling that all the time, that is for sure."
2.0,Poor quality. Second time wearing these and they ripped. Buyer beware.
2.0,these jeans are not created for curves. Feel like flattened my rear side and didn't fit as comfortably as I'd hoped.
2.0,I wanted to really like this set. It’s cute but the sizing was off. Bought a medium. I’m 5’9” and 140 lbs. The bottoms were fine but would have wanted them a little smaller. The top was so small though I could barely get it on and off. Returning the set.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:3dcc2b5c3aa42e7c22682a57270ddfb0]] Not crystal glass, very misleading. Watches feel like a toy. Face looks good and watch does also. If you buy this make sure your expectations are low. Look if you want a great watch, just buy a Invicta. Definitely a great idea 💡"
2.0,Demaciados pequeños
2.0,I love the earrings BUT I will not order them again! This is my second pair because THEY DO NOT STAY CLOSED! They fall off all the time and I have lost 3 earrings so NO MORE! It’s a shame because the earrings themselves are lovely. But way too expensive to keep losing.
2.0,One of the earrings has the stone set pretty obviously set crooked in the setting.
2.0,"I bought these on sale on black friday for a little over $12. They are very cheap and flimsy. Which would of been okay for the price I guess, but them claiming that they are $75-90 headphones is a joke. They are a little below the quality you'd find in a shopping mall kiosk. I have a very big head also and the frames were still too large. I'd reccomend just going buying a pair at the gas station for a similar, cheaper experience"
2.0,"the earrings are beautiful. the only problem was that the flower came unglued from the base, since it was metal I could not find something to put them together"
2.0,Loved the pattern. I have small wrists and this was very tight. Very uncomfortable. There was also some loose stitches. I think I have worn once due to how tight it was.
2.0,I ordered a small and it fits like a large. Quality is alright...could be better.
2.0,"Love the color scheme, but the butt stretched out real bad. So had to get rid of it...waste of my money unfortunately."
2.0,Low quality. Extremely stretchy
2.0,I lost it the first time I wore it because it fell off my ear.
2.0,"Super cute and cool BUT my daughter wore them twice and they've already broke the light won't go on anymore on 1 sneaker, I've tried recharging it and all"
2.0,"Great pattern, lightweight but very thin upper and sole. It simply did not last more than a month of moderate use by a 4 yr old (holes in the uppers)."
2.0,I’m a 34DDD and I bought an XL. The bottoms of my breasts come to the bottom band of the bra. Luckily it seems like my breasts will stay in the bra with athletic movements which is why I’m choosing to keep the bra. The straps are not adjustable which is a downside
2.0,"Size: small<br /><br />I'm giving this product 2 stars instead of one, because the fabric *does* seem sturdy and offers some decent compression. However, not enough to actually make a difference to my silhouette.<br /><br />Actually, that's not true. Because even though it did nothing to flatten my tummy, it DID manage to have a flattening effect on my rear, which is the opposite of what it was supposed to do. All of this while somehow simultaneously creating bulges where there were none before, due to the fact that the rear doesn't provide full coverage and therefore cuts into the butt cheeks.<br /><br />In sum, this produced the diametrically opposite effect I was going for.<br /><br />I'm 5'6"" 126 lbs. with only the slightest bit of tummy. I'm not exactly reaching for the stars here."
2.0,"I ordered a couple sizes large because international sizing so width and length were on the money however, it could not be tighter around the shoulders.  This isn't a typical issue I have with shirts or jackets--I'm not a hulkamaniac tearing through seems.  Lastly, material is... odd.  I describe it as a few layers of yoga pants, like combat tights, a higher quality Halloween costume material. If Batman's cape were poor. Wouldn't be so bad material wise if the shoulders weren't tourniquet tight.  As it is, I can't feel this keyboard as I type."
2.0,Constanly slides up
2.0,"Runs a bit small in my opinion, especially if you don't want a lot of stomach showing. I suggest sizing up."
2.0,I would like darker and bigger numbers for my kind work
2.0,. They looked nice except for one of the bars was missing one on the CZ  when I received these. Fail.
2.0,"The clasp is ineffective, and I have not been able to wear them - and there are no instructions on how to secure them correctly. The post separates from both sides - still I've not been able to secure them or where them ever. Wasted money."
2.0,I loved these sunglasses until one side seized up on me and I can’t seem to adjust it. Have only had them about six weeks
2.0,Not actually carbon fiber. Cheap sticker that peels off.
2.0,They're cute! Not the size I was expecting though.
2.0,This was not flattering on me at all! I was hoping it'd be high waisted and with the thick band too it would really help but the skirt didn't go up that high and the band laid right on my stomach which was NOT a good look. It needs to be much higher waisted but the shorts inside prevented me from pulling it up higher.
2.0,"I like the cut on these. They are made from really sheer, but stretchy and breathable fabric. Not for being seen without your rump covered, but helps with chub rub.<br /><br />BUT they are really terribly made. The seams are all crooked and they last perhaps three washings before literally falling apart. I wish I could find something a bit more durable and as comfortable to wear that served this function."
2.0,"Is not girl sizes, it is toddler. I ordered a large and it was a 6 and I expected it to be a 10/12 from description."
2.0,"I had to return the first one I got because the crossbody strap was missing. The new one smelled so putrid that the odor lingered for days after it was out of the house. Too bad. Photos above are of a Google Pixel in the outside pocket. The Samsung A52 5g with shockproof case is a BIG phone. The outside pocket couldn't be snapped. I had to return 4 other cases before this. Be sure to account for squared-off thick, drop-proof corners fitting into narrow wallet widths. The described measurements are ONLY FOR THE PHONE. I finally found a 6th wallet at Walmart; ""Tried & Tru."" Go there and try b4 u buy."
2.0,Not bad but broke with minimal use. Positive: My kids like them for the fact that one pair is clear and one is reflective. The case they come in is also nice but honestly it’s a waste because my kids never use it. The real reason I’m giving them 2 stars is because after using a few times the rubber seal around the eye came off on one of them.
2.0,No breast coverage
2.0,It was really warm but the sleeves were too short and the shoulders didn’t fit. For reference I am 5’10” 150 pounds and I bought the large. Sadly I had to return it
2.0,Wore it once and the strap broke. Material is cheap. Very cute purse but won't last long.
2.0,I also purchased the same in black earlier and the black was much larger and had a better zipper.
2.0,"I really want this dress to be okay, because it is cute but the wire in the bust area is super weird. I pokes out at the bottom I have yet to wear it out."
2.0,"I would not buy this hat, again. It is incredibly flimsy and does not hold shape. The mesh design is such that you can, with the correct lighting— see straight through it. While “breathable” may be an accurate word; I would sooner wear something that looks good on my head and somewhat fits.  I now own 5 of these style hats— 2 of which I just bought and they will likely go in the garbage as I wouldn’t give something like this away because it would be a disservice to the recipient. Spend another 5$ and get a better hat."
2.0,Quality seemed OK but as someone who wears an XL hat this thing was huge. Usually most normal sized hats are a fair bit too small but all the way tightened down it was still easily able to go over my ears. Measurement wise I should be in the middle of the range they offer so I don't know if it was just way off or what.
2.0,The pants are too short. I bought two for a 4 year old and a 1 year old. both pair were short. I went up a size and got a 5 for my oldest and it was still short. But the material is nice and thick.
2.0,"I really like the looks of these glasses, but one of the screws that holds the lens to the frame came off after less than 5 uses, making them lopsided and useless. Good luck finding a screw that small. They were also a bit heavy, and the arms were sharp. Slid down my nose because of the weight, and made my ear area sore after an hour or so because of the sharp arms. However, the company refunded me for them, so that was excellent. They looked really good, I wish they were more user friendly."
2.0,The gloves are warm but I got them to keep my hands dry. They are water resistant not waterproof like they supposed to be.
2.0,don't like the way the boots fit to big not what I though they would be not really a combat boot
2.0,Already returned
2.0,"Zipper handles shoddy. Two have broken in 18 months of light use, hand carried by me,."
2.0,I am very disappointed in the masks. They aren’t cotton as described. The pictures are not at all like masks and there are no solid as pictured. I will keep them because I am in need but AM NOT HAPPY that photos and description  misrepresented the masks.
2.0,The wine colored one is more of a magenta.
2.0,I hate writing a bad review. I love the shirt. Bad news is there is a hole in the underarm at the seam. Guess it will make a good rag.
2.0,Size runs small. Beautiful fabric and color. Just too small.
2.0,Too cheaply made.<br />I loved that when im wearing it the first time. Wish it has a better quality
2.0,"I really liked the concept of the suit: racer back and shorts under the skirt. I usually wear a 16 but sized up based on reviews. Still like the suit but it's just a little too big, the skirt is a little too long, and there is really no support up top. I'd also like to be able to remove the padding."
2.0,"These may say toddler kids but these purely mean for toddlers. These are not ""kid"" shoes. They would fit babies and infants and very small feeted toddlers. If you're child is above 2, don't expect any of these to fit."
2.0,THE SZING IS LARGER THEN APPEARS.  LOSE FITTING AND THEY CRAWL UP YOUR BUTT
2.0,I am a medium and ordered a medium however they fit like XL.
2.0,"Ring came and it does not fit the dimensions listed. Overall a pretty ring, just completely useless because of the misleading dimensions. A complete waste of time."
2.0,I did like the flower face and the numbers were clear.  The way the &#34;gems&#34; were attached made the match like cheap .
2.0,Slides down when wearing
2.0,"after using a bit and after washing,  the glow fades and turns black."
2.0,The photo shows silver &#34;granny&#34; glasses but the frames I received were bright gold :(
2.0,"Just a rectangle and band, Kinda heavy,  but easy to breathe<br />Extremely cheap but it was cheap, so I expected nothing more"
2.0,s<br />Send the kilt back on Feb 7 tracking #1z742 YF8 90 1196  7651<br />the buttons came on the kilt in side both  refund<br />112 2406334 9981851 $30.98
2.0,cute but top too small
2.0,It’s see through we had to return it
2.0,This came shorter than expected and tight.
2.0,Doesnt match the picture
2.0,"when you see it up close, unfolded, it looks like something for women."
2.0,Larger than expected so I returned them. They also had &#34;made in China&#34; sewed into the band in very large red font.
2.0,"Fits a little big<br />Maybe ideal for a maternity shoot<br />Soft fabric nice color, everyone loves dresses with pockets!"
2.0,"sent a skull cap with made in Ch printed right in front , it just happened to be the American flag :( somebody was not doing their job , poor quality control"
2.0,looks worn or used
2.0,The dress was very beautiful. Just that it is notfor curvy women. I ordered 1x and was to small
2.0,Lined with uncomfortable foam. Oversized. Fixable yet annoying
2.0,This is a great handbag But does not have a zipper closure and times can fall out.
2.0,"The seem was poorly sewn on one side, creating a pucker on my hip that was unflattering and made the dress look very cheap.  It was very stretchy and comfortable, but the way the material shifts as you move also makes the dress look very very cheap.  Even at this price, I would not recommend this dress for any occasion."
2.0,I ordered the right size but the bathing suit was too large unfortunately. I loved the style
2.0,If you get a large get an xl it was to toght on the boobs
2.0,Extremely off on size really small cool idea but size is no good
2.0,"I have size 2g (6mm) gauges and have had problems just about every time that I have worn these. The rims are very wide and sharp, so when your ears go to stretch around the rims your ears will more than likely be sliced. 2 stars, only because they look really nice. Bottom line, I recommend against this product. Essentially a waste of money because they are unwearable unless you're okay with scarring your ears."
2.0,Good quality shirt but will need to buy up to 2 or more sized up
2.0,"The best arrived on time, but too small. Generally I'm a large and this thing says large,  but at best it is a small. To top it off, I noticed the zipper travels up the wrong side."
2.0,if you have c cup or larger do not bother with this
2.0,I don't think they were the gauge I ordered and the gems won't stay in. So basically useless.
2.0,"smells like gas , hope it better when I wash it :( runs small"
2.0,These are horrible. Cheaply made and flattening and broken down beyond repair. Waste of money.
2.0,"I have already the size SMALL ( and is too small for my shoes, ) I order this pair MEDIUM and do no fit well, after start walking  the Tingley's Commuter start come out  and difficult to walk, my shoe size is 8 W.  and the Tingley's  MD fits (8-91/2 ). How I can return it ?"
2.0,I was very disappointed with these. They are extremely small. To the point that the edges of the threading are sharp making it uncomfortable to put them in.
2.0,I have a dozen different similar shirts.  This material wrinkles too much and nothing about it is pleasant.
2.0,These shrunk a lot. My son usually wears 3t these shirts both show his tummy.
2.0,Grandchild wore top once cause it was small for size. Pants to big and long for size. Would not buy again
2.0,"It is made well enough, but like many others, is just too small and constricting."
2.0,"They are comfortable and fit loose, which I like.I purchased a Large.  After a few wears and washing they have begun to “pill” all over. I will be sending them back."
2.0,"I tried it on. I just looks cheap.  Smaller than shown in pic.  The edging is ugly.  I wasn't happy with 90 percent of what I ordered from this company.  Mainly because of cheap material, and didn't look good in person.  Also almost always run way small.  Even though the stuff is cheap, I wasted my money because I can't wear any of it."
2.0,The keychain is tiny and the etching isn't as pronounced as the pictures. I would look at some of the others before buying this one again
2.0,A whole ripped in them right away. First day I wore them
2.0,They are pretty my wrist are small and they aren’t super tight so  where the actual device sit on Top of my wrist it gravity takes it and falls down so it didn’t help me
2.0,The material is cheap and the letters seem to just be stuck on. Haven't washed yet but I expect it to peel on washing.
2.0,Not what I thought it would be!!! Didn’t know everyone who wanted to talk on mesh needed to purchase their own.  Thought this would connect everyone and act like a repeater. I was wrong.  Not worth it.
2.0,Just biggish<br />No real shape to it<br />In spite of the cool print it is frumpy
2.0,"Nice pants but the crotch ripped out after a month of use.<br />If I really wanted to ""assault"" something with these pants my balls would be hanging out... different kind of ""assault"" I guess."
2.0,The knit fabric becomes fuzzy after one use. The material and the loose weave cause some of the fibers to pull out and create long fibers that need to be cut.
2.0,Cheaply made. Began ripping at the seams after first wear and wash.
2.0,Not as pretty and convenient to be used with a toddler. Cotton is not soft. I couldn't return in return window.
2.0,"The fabric is very thin (you can see through to my ironing board cover in the photo) and coarse. After washing, the hem stitching came out in places and the fabric started to fray (see photo). Also, they never softened up. The bandanas are smaller than 22” and not square. Nice color selection, but really, the quality is just too poor."
2.0,"The earrings are more green than opaque; so the color was not what I was expecting.  Also, although I did not wear on a regular basis, the stones fell out only after a few months.  Unfortunately the earrings are now in the trash.  I am not a happy camper because they are not exactly cheap AND I bought another pair; I also have the black.  For which the stones fell out today!!!  And I only just noticed other stones were missing.  I must admit I do love earrings, while they lasted, and did get a lot of compliments.<br /><br />I hope the manufacturer reads this review and finds a better way to secure the stones.  I would gladly buy another (or two) pair.  Until then ...another pair just bit the dust :("
2.0,Meh. The ears look more rounded than pointed. Fits far too low over my eyes. I'm returning it.
2.0,"I buy a lot of one pieces, this one did not even come up to my chest. The hole that should be around your sternum won't go past my belly button. I am also short and short torsoed. Usually clothes are too long in the middle on me. This made no sense."
2.0,"I bought this product to use for an upcoming trip and when it arrived it looked like it had been run over by a semi. The product itself had dirt on it, but because it was leather it easily washed off. Overall good quality product to survive whatever it did in order to arrive at my house, but utterly disappointing to get a package filled with debris for a product purchased brand new. Disappointed in this amazon purchase. Would not recommend."
2.0,"Just ok, I was very disappointed  in the looks and it's very hard to fasten without help."
2.0,It's pretty but will break easily. The piece that hooks to ur ear is too big so unless the tip of ur ear is thick then u have to pinch it on and it still sticks too far out. Just not a good fit overall
2.0,This fit is very flattering however I purchased the white with black stripes and it is way too see through. Also the size runs just a tad bigger than most
2.0,Not really good quality leather
2.0,Much prettier in picture. Cheaply made more of a shawl then cardigan
2.0,"The neckline was way different and not at all what I was hoping for. Shirt is still cute and fits well, the photos are just very misleading."
2.0,Not in love with it. It fits large and takes away any shape you may have... would not buy again.
2.0,I bought them to use for typing when my hands get cold.  the heating mechanism is too stiff to wear over the palm and too hot on top of the hands.  Also the fingers are all frayed from having the tips just cut off.
2.0,Cute item but way too small
2.0,It was WAY bigger than I expected.
2.0,Hate it.<br />Material sucks & pants are hella see thru
2.0,"This dress was way way too small, tried to return it but instead the seller suggested that I take $2.40 refund so I did and just gave it to my sister"
2.0,"I never thought that the first tungsten carbide item I'd own would be a bracelet!  And a stunning bracelet it is.  It is so stunning that it seems to have a hyponotic effect on people who will follow it with their eyes as they engage in normal conversation with you.  I liken the experience to that of a snake charmer (you) with a king cobra (them).  It is definitely masculine in all respects (style, heft, thickness, width).  It has a brilliant shine, and it looks and feels far more expensive than its actual selling price.  The clasp takes some getting used to, particularly unhooking it which, so far, remains an awkward task.  If you're looking for a little bling for your arm, look no further.  You will not be disappointed!<br /><br />** Update - 10/22/2012 **<br />I downgraded this bracelet from 5 stars to 2.  While it looks great and was the source of many compliments, it did not stand the test of time for me.  One day, out of the blue, while at work during normal use, a link fractured right in half -- clean cut.  I had expected that the clasp would one day fail but never did I expect a seemingly tough link to fail.  A very frustrating end to a bracelet that I had high hopes of having around for a long time."
2.0,"My daughter really wanted matching sunglasses, so I bought two pairs of these: one kid size, one adult. Unfortunately the kid glasses broke immediately - an arm fell off. It wasnt even under extreme toddler duress."
2.0,The zipper is tackey
2.0,Too cheap and clingy.  Shows every ripple in the body.
2.0,"this dress is just ok. Hung on my body and the material is very cheap and sheer. I’m returning it, the fit is weird. My friend said it looks like “a granny dress”. Not worth the 23 dollars"
2.0,My son used this practice rifle for ROTC drill tricks and the gun broke within 2 weeks of purchasing it.  I don't think this rifle was made to do tricks.
2.0,This broke the second time I wore it
2.0,"Dress was too long and too big on the waist. I’m usually between a medium, large and this dress was too loose and the material was not very flowy."
2.0,"Love this hat, however it was stuffed into a tiny box for shipping.  It’s not recovering to it’s normal shape.  I will likely return this."
2.0,I ordered my size and it was a size or so too tight. Love the shirt. Just disappointed bc I really wanted it.
2.0,not much to say
2.0,"The lining tears very easy; with in one wash it had started to rip and 3 washes later it was a mess. It's not an expensive top so I just dealt with but cutting off the rips and hand washing. Color is a very bright color, the coral is a neon color for sure."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:25bf493389eb2e37feb6285e578badc2]] Pretty swimsuit but It got torn in 2 nd wash .not satisfied.
2.0,Very cute and my son loved it...at first...the problem was when it ripped and my son was having conniptions!! They didn’t last a week. Sorry I bought them...here I thought My kid would be so happy and all I heard was crying because it ripped. Thanks a lot.
2.0,They wouldn't stay up at the top and kept rolling down my legs.
2.0,"Weird material. Weird fit in the busy. Awkward waistline placement. And, the pattern isn't cute in person. Pass."
2.0,The ear holder part on this mask is very thin and started tearing (the elastic) the first time I wore it. I had it on for a 5 hour flight and I noticed the elastic breaking on it.
2.0,"This shirt runs big. Also, the material is a very thin and slinky material. Images are even slightly blurred."
2.0,No me gustó la calidad de la tela
2.0,not as long a photo shows.
2.0,I wear a size 10 and I order a xl and it was to small. I went by the chart and this dress runs very small.
2.0,The size is somewhat larger than the actual size and it wouldn't give you any curve.
2.0,I got the XL shirt and the collar was so big it went out to my shoulders.  Then for an XL shirt the arms were very small so that it was very tight around my arms and didn't allow a good fit.  Very thick t-shirt feel so I will give two stars for that.
2.0,Should have istened to the ones who said the stud fell off. Same thing happend.
2.0,Look good.. but too heavy on the ear due to the weight. And the droopy look of the ear is not good.
2.0,"The fabric is WAYYY too stretchy. The crotch wouldn't stay up at all.  The fabric was super thin and not compression at all.  The waistband fit tight/right, so I know getting a smaller size would not have helped. I pulled the waistband up to my chest and the crotch was still sagging when I moved. I returned them."
2.0,"For me it was kinda tight around the neck and the chest area was to big, but i also have a very small chest. The quality was really nice and thick just wanst for me"
2.0,Sleeves are short
2.0,Not long enough an small. Thin material.
2.0,"this looks way too big on my nose. it was easy to put on, but it looks like i just stuck an earring in my nose instead"
2.0,"I had multiple complaints with this then asked for a refund only to be offered a new one, that was weeks ago.  I still do not have the replacement product.  I gave it two stars because it is cute and stylish but the plastic part is too long and the jewel wont connect to the plastic part and stay there.  I thought this would be perfect while pregnant but instead i have had to let my belly ring close because this took so long to get here."
2.0,"Love this keychain, it’s beautiful... I read reviews about it breaking and thought people were being picky but it really did break after one week😢"
2.0,"The pictures shown as the product are not actual pictures of the watch band, but a photo of the design Photoshopped to look like a band. Actual band is a poor representation of the colorful picture they show as the product."
2.0,"cheaply made. the strap that tightens at the wrist doesn't go all the way around to fit the Velcro, and I have tiny wrists. but does the job of keeping you dry."
2.0,Usually wear a large and this is like a small.  Very disappointed.
2.0,"cute top, but is completely sheer, will need to wear another top underneath it"
2.0,Not the quality that I was used to from Holloway.  Pilled after first wash.  Material is cheap and doesn't flex at all.  Not the comfortable hoodie I thought it would be.
2.0,"Smaller than expected... Not so great for winter, but good for driving. CANNOT use touchscreens with these gloves."
2.0,The colors are faded
2.0,"tight on boobs but way to big and short in the hips returned it, I was going to only wear with leggings but the upper is just strange to the bottom not for girls with curves"
2.0,Its very flimsy and I thought  it would work in my cartilage piercing. Not. I finally get it in and there's no locking mechanism to close it. General piercing and taking it off every night would probably work. Also you only get one earring.
2.0,Zipper on little pocket broke after 1 month
2.0,"These are very cute. However, the post was not glued into the back of the earring, i had to glue it.  The post is also a little short for both pieces; i was expecting the part behind the ear too be attached to the finding but it is a separate piece. I will enjoy them until they fall off or break, because they are cute"
2.0,These glasses are too small allow absolutely no room for your nose and you can see above and below them when you are wearing them. Don't get me wrong theyre pretty cool I used them for my frozone Halloween costume I just wouldn't recommend them to others at the price they're offering
2.0,"Made for old people,  very cheap looking"
2.0,"Not even close to a comfortable fit.  Buy two sizes up, they might be better."
2.0,"I'm an adult male. Sadly, mask was too small."
2.0,Quedan muy ajustadas
2.0,these are too thin.
2.0,"I got the large. It was way too small, sausage casing small. The dress is cute and the fabric is polyester. I am 5'5&#34; and 130 lbs with a straight waist, not curvy. It was tight in the shoulders, tight waist and tight hips. So sad because it is a nice pattern.Returned. I don't dare order a different size because the fit  is unpredictable."
2.0,The band is kind of cheap looking compared to another leather band that I purchased at the same price point. Not impressed.
2.0,"The dress is very pretty - nice color.  But fabric is very see through.  It would be more for a night shirt than to wear out in public.  Also, it did not fit the same way the one I bought in a different color did."
2.0,Look nice and fit the apple watch ok but the metal closure is sharp and digs into your hand if you are typing on a computer
2.0,I made the mistake of purchasing these in hopes that they would hold my xl flare dresses closer but they cannot. I love them as sweater clips but not strong enough for much else
2.0,"Needs a user guide with it . It took me to ask five people to help me know how to open it . No body ever had something like this before . But after knowing how to install it , you will find it a &#34; not bad item &#34;"
2.0,"Not meant for size 10 feet I guess. I do not have wide feet, and these will NOT stay on. I am so frustrated right now as I sit at a doctor's office in my cute heels having to take them off in public to pull the flipping sicls back on. I do not recommend these at all"
2.0,"Good quality,  run very large"
2.0,I really like the original camo print but fits too tight. Wasn’t happy because you can’t find original camo print like this. If it did fit like regular socks “comfortable” I would have bought more than one pair.
2.0,"So small there is no chance of wearing it. I ordered a size above what I'd normally wear to be safe, I don't mind loose tanks, I'd have to update probably 3 sizes for this to work. 2 stars because it seems like decent quality and looked just like the pic. Someone at good will gets to try it."
2.0,"Nice looking watch, but I had it under water for a few second when I slipped wading up a river. It now has water under the bezel that won't go away. Pretty cheap.<br /><br />Update: over a year later and it is going strong. I beat this watch like a rented mule and it just keeps going. Just don't submerge it in water"
2.0,Ok looking sandal. I gave this product 2 stars due to the strap design. My daughter had slight discomfort with the strap
2.0,"Got the light black which has tiny glitter all over it. Fit is a bit loose. Ruffles seem to make the wrong spots look bigger, wider which for  5’4 does not flatter.  Itchy material. Returning"
2.0,Run very small... a size 3 children’s is really a size 2! Otherwise nice shoe for the money.
2.0,Bought over a year ago and my industrial still hasn’t healed from the infection this gave it. DO NOT BUY IF YOURE EVEN REMOTELY WORRIED ABOUT HOW YOUR EAR WILL TAKE IT. also much larger than I expected and got caught a lot
2.0,The color of this shirt is not what I expected. Not a color I would have ordered for myself.
2.0,It broke the day I got it the pendant came off and the clasp broke apart it’s an easy fix but it was kinda sad
2.0,Zipper is cheap.  Mine broke while I was at a children's museum with my son.  Only my 2nd time wearing it.  Very disappointed.  Beautiful dress.  Wish they would put a better quality zipper on it.  Then it would be 5 stars from me.
2.0,Way shorter than the pictured
2.0,I could see why someone might like these but I didn’t. They ran too small and definitely not for curvier ladies.
2.0,"These are not slippers, they are socks.  One pair is spiderman and the other is not."
2.0,The colors are not at all like pictured. They are very faded pastel colors. Faded even more after washing.
2.0,"Lowered my review because there were about 15 defective masks in the batch. Some had no ear hoops, many had no metal band for the nose… rendering the masks useless.<br /><br />I reached out to the seller directly, hoping they would make it right by sending me some replacements, but they ignored my message."
2.0,cheasy
2.0,Not as pictured.  The end doesn't come to a point at all four corners.  Had to return it.
2.0,"When I opened it, I was overwhelmed with an extremely strong odor.  It didn't smell like something I expected from leather.  Also, all of the metal pieces; snaps, buckles, magnetic closures- all had a very sticky, smelly goop on them.  Like, a thick grease, maybe?  I've had it over a week now though, and the smell has not faded in the least.  As I write this, it's on a table across the living room, and I can smell it all the way over here.  It also seems to be pretty cheaply made, but I guess you should expect that for the price.  My wallet barely fits in it.  It has several pockets, but it might as well not, because unless it's papers, you can't really fit anything into them.  I'm just not happy with it, overall."
2.0,"Well, I did not like anything.  It was taking off and it was super uncomfortable, I need to have big breasts so that something works for me?"
2.0,"It should not be a project to get into a sports bar,  but with all the extra straps this one had, it definitely was.  One should not have to look in the mirror to try to figure out how to get a bra on.  Off equal annoyance was that the pads kept slipping out of place.  I have a large bust (C cup) and I found this uncomfortably tight.  I wouldn't recommend for anyone over a B cup.  This is definitely a case of looks over function."
2.0,Way too small to possibly get in my nose. May fit a child.
2.0,The time and date is correct. It is suppose to flash the word Champion but it is spelled wrong. It spells the word Ciampion.  I'm glad my 7 yr old thinks it is funny.
2.0,I'm  5'5&#34; and it barely came to my waist. Girl I picture must be three feet tall.
2.0,I don’t feel like I pump as much with this on. It’s a bit of a hassle to put on as well.
2.0,This buckle has a tendency to come loose from the belt. I keep having to trim the last little bit and reattach the buckle. I wouldn't recommend this belt.
2.0,This product fits way too small. Size 2-3 fits like 12 months but all in all it’s a really pretty outfit.
2.0,Bib fit was nice but these are very thin! Thinner than some of my short bibs. I’ll will echo what another reviewer wrote about how the leg grippers around the calves are way to big. I’m a big guy with big calves and they were still to big. Rode up behind my knees.
2.0,I wore this for approximately 1 month and already the colored pattern is fading.
2.0,Loved this for about two months then it broke out of nowhere. Pretty bummed because it’s passed the window to replace.
2.0,I disliked that the description mention very fast delivery. It took about 6 weeks for the item to finally arrive. And then they were too small; not true to the size.
2.0,Its adorable but the zipper broken a few weeks after i bought it
2.0,It looks better in the pics than in person. The fabric feels cheap like slippery polyester...and it has a chemical odor. would not recommend.
2.0,"The dress was sufficient quality in terms of fabric. The style was nice. BUT it was poorly sewn. As a result, the screen opening exposed more of one chest than the other. When I inspected, the seam lines were askew/lopsided. Seller was very professional and responsive and settled the matter for me but I cannot recommend the dress itself."
2.0,Very delicate did not last very long broke the next day
2.0,The style doesn't work well if you are thick. They also run small
2.0,"I received the bag in one day on Prime and the zipper was sewn in twisted! I was not able to zip it closed. The bag itself was nice and soft and roomy.<br />But I requested a replacement due to the zipper.<br />It took 3 days, not 1 day Prime.<br />The replacement bag was even worse! The strap was extremely short, stiffer material, and the smell was HORRIBLE, like rotten fish!! I sent it back!<br />I still had the first bag, which I liked, so my friend manages to pry the end of the zipper off, take it apart, untwist, and was able to sew it back in. Such a hassle!"
2.0,"cute but seethrough, had to return"
2.0,I received these earrings with one tassel missing. It was very disappointing.
2.0,When I saw -30 ℉ I was very hopeful this would be my last pair of gloves to buy. I was very disappointed while riding my motorcycle in 50℉ weather and my fingers became cold at interstate speed. Surely the wind-chill was no where near 0℉. Gloves feel soft and easy to put on but advertising -30℉ is not being very truthful in my opinion.
2.0,not high impact support - demi cup cut so low you spill out the top
2.0,"This purse is stiff and smells weird.  It does not feel nor look at all like leather.  Must be PU leather, but states genuine leather in description."
2.0,"It  fits quite well, but honestly it had started flaking off the paint after the second day of use. Because of that, I can't reccomend it."
2.0,I bought these cute little gems for my lower lip piercing. It says 16 g but the bar is way too thick for a lower lip piercing. I know its a monroe but i thought it would work for a lip piercing. Makes me sad cause the studs are really cute. Would've given 5 stars if the bar had been just a LITTLE bit thinner.
2.0,Runs on the small side!!
2.0,"I don't like the material inside. When you put your hoodie off, you'll see yourself covered by textile dust. If you're OCD about cleaning, don't buy it. Either way the Russell sweat pants I just bought have the same problem not like the one that I bought in 2008."
2.0,It's like wearing a pretty Glad bag. Cheap 100% synthetic. You get what you pay for
2.0,Do not recommend. Smaller than expected and cheap looking.
2.0,Don’t waste your time with these.
2.0,Weird straps
2.0,The letter M was messed up.
2.0,Didn't look like I expected. cheap/.
2.0,The black and gold lines that make up the heart is marked on with a Sharpie.
2.0,Way too large for my face
2.0,Not as fancy as in the picture
2.0,"The fabric was unusual; shiny, not particularly stretchy.  There was nothing cozy about these pajamas.<br />They were also very narrow.  The length was OK and synced with the size chart but there is no way my normally sized 9 year old grandson could squeeze into these size mediums."
2.0,Bought this for my husband and he liked it for about a day but the sound quality was not good and he kept having to adjust the hat while he worked to even be able to hear anything. Good idea but product fell short.
2.0,"It seems that this tank top was made for big, BIG breasted women. There is so much slack in the armpit area that the material protrudes outward when I tried it on, and I do not even lack in that anatomical region. This is a poorly made product. All I can say is that DO NOT purchase this product in a size small unless you have a D cup and up!!!"
2.0,Not as long as I thought
2.0,It’s cool but ehh it could have been better made<br />Better quality material
2.0,"In the pictures, theres a bit of a gather around the waist, where the top flows a bit over the waistband.  Nope.  The shorts section is way too long in the rise, and there isnt enough material, lengthwise, on the top portion to have any drape.  It's as though the pockets and drawstring waist just needed to be moved down a few inches.  I had high hope, but this just didnt meet my expectation.  I'll pay more for a better fitting item."
2.0,"I was so excited to have this ear wrap cuff, but when I put it on, it was waaay to small!!!<br />It keeps falling off my ear because, I guess, my ear is too big for it....<br />So I bought it for nothing!"
2.0,Get what you pay for I guess.
2.0,product di not lift anything.
2.0,"Well the turtle is cute and easy to see, but the inscription is not easy to read and also says ""Mom loves YO forever."" So uhh... that's a typo, unless your name is Yo. It says 925 on the inside, but definitely not."
2.0,"This shirt has a loose neckline that flops over. After a few washes its already has pilling everywhere. Loved the design but poor quality t shirt. Runs small, I dry my clothes on lowest setting."
2.0,"I bought my normal size(16) and also one size up (18). If you have hips from babies and or even a small tummy bulge from babies_ these may not be for you. The Cargo shorts are he closest to anything I would want in a  Cargp Short ((although I will send them back) I can’t tell you how they  are with a wash~my guess~wash in cold and really set in the color.  If you are a size 2 or 4 (and haven’t had babies OR you returned to your size~ these shorts are in style and can even be worn (If with the right blouse) kind of dressy. One other thing, I am close to 6’ Tall~all legs, long torso ~ I love the length on the shortstop!"
2.0,Not nice pizzas
2.0,Fell apart after 2 uses. It's a nice belt and the materials used seem to be good. It's just that they didn't put it together well.
2.0,The print is really bad. The moment I took it out of the shipping bag/ package I can clearly see the discoloring of the team logo.
2.0,Pretty dress but not well made. Very see through. I was going to extend the inner slip but the quality wasn’t worth the investment.
2.0,This is not what it looks like. The one delivered to me had short sleeves and does NOT look like beach wear. It looks more like a short sleeved dress shirt but is decent quality....
2.0,Top fit...bottom way too big
2.0,"The high waist is cute on the skinny model, but it doesn't reach very high if you have a belly and sits really awkwardly."
2.0,Brake one so quick.
2.0,"It's not really slim fit.  I'm 6'1&#34;, 185 lb, not really slim, but I have a lot of extra room in this shirt.  Not at all like the pictures, as others have stated.  It's just square cut shoulders to waist.  Material is ok, light weight (I prefer heavier fabric)."
2.0,"I got these for my girls, but one girl can wear it no problem. The other one complains she sees things in double. I tried it too and see doubles too. I don’t know why…."
2.0,"The only thing I liked about this shirt were the colors.<br />It is too thick for hot weather and the style did not work for me. There is no space given for breasts at all, and I am not well endowed. It made me look like I had on a sports bra, so not a flattering look, and was uncomfortable. Had to return because a larger size would not have been any better if it was cut this same way."
2.0,"These are impossible to review accurately because I ordered two colors and instead got two completely different hats, one of which I like.  The other hat is a completely different design.  The elastic-y part does not fit snugly and the hat is oddly shaped."
2.0,This is a super cute product HOWEVER I have a small wrist as it is and this band is WAY too small.
2.0,Was a kids medium. Needed a lady medium
2.0,Returned for credit
2.0,"The inside of the slippers are falling apart. All the fluffy stuff is gone, and it feels bulky rough."
2.0,"It looks nice however I put four credit cards, some cash, and my drivers license in the wallet and it expanded to twice the size of the one I was replacing.  The tab in the center of the wallet adds to the expansion. I was unable to put the rest of my cards in it.  I have it away and will never purchase any items made in China."
2.0,"i get the concept, but even as a very small headed person, this is just too small to work,"
2.0,I ordered large and could barely get my hands in gloves.
2.0,"It fit well, didn’t roll down, and smoothed out my upper belly & waist line. That said it didn’t do anything for lower belly at all. It also cuts into your body very visibly from the leg openings which doesn’t look good under a spandex dress."
2.0,Beatiful but much smaller than expected.
2.0,"Love these, but I washed in cold water and found a run. Very dissapointed!<br />Never even wore them out in town yet. Sucks"
2.0,"It's pretty. I use it for my work badge, but mainly it's been in my purse. Not around my neck. Since I bought it 've worn it at school probably a total of ten times. Often, the link would open enough to lose my badge and then my husband would pinch the link back together with his Gerber tool. Today my badge fell, one of my students found it, and when I went to try to put the link back together I realized that a broken lobster claw was to blame. No repairing that. Love the design, but it isn't worth the purchase. If I had worn it every day, all day,it would have broken like this months ago."
2.0,"The flexfit isn't tight & it's misshapen, it has bubbles on the top... It's hard to explain but basically, it's messed up..."
2.0,It's literally fabric glued to those cheap adjustable rings from gumball machines. The bracelet chain is too small so you see the clasp on the side of your wrist. But i paid only a couple dollars so I'll situate it in better jewelry since it's a very pretty.
2.0,"Clasp feels cheap. Considering that's the one stress point, I don;t expect this to hold up over time.<br />Would not recommend"
2.0,5'7&#34; 160 lbs I ordered a us medium. It fit fine until I washed it and dried it. Despite being pulled out of the dryer while still damp it had shrunk a whole size. Can't even button it now.
2.0,"Solid feel, but the lenses barely change color. Lenses fall out when cleaning them. Don't buy!"
2.0,"It started ripping two days after wearing ,its quiet expensive for the quality of the product ,it feels too cheap ,I live in Minnesota and it was nice outside over the weekend ,it couldn’t absorb the cold like I thought it would with its puffy nature"
2.0,"Broke within the first week we had it. Not very comfortable to wear and tricky to put on.The color is a brassy gold with black antiquing. Purchased this as a novelty joke, but would not recommend if you plan on wearing it often."
2.0,I did not realize the postage would be more than the cost of the item. It's one size but to small for me. I gave it to my granddaughter.
2.0,These unisex bracelets/ anklets are very cute but they break in a week
2.0,The color was absolutely nothing like the picture and a hem was very messy. I wasn’t expecting great quality because of the price but the quality is truly poor.
2.0,Very pretty but too small and much too slippery to wear even with bare feet.
2.0,I have another dress just like this with a different pattern. It is a smaller size but is much bigger.
2.0,"Way too small, very cheap material"
2.0,"I love the fabric and the length, and that's the only thing I loved about this dress. The side slit was really high...too high for me. My boob was popping out of the top, and I don't even think the size large would've helped because the triangular shaped top was so small that no matter how much I adjusted, the other side would move. I bought a medium, I'm currently 5'2&#34;, 36ddd, 32, 44. I'm going to return."
2.0,"These are supposedly photochromic. The lenses fit perfectly for my fuel cells, so I can't knock that. But they aren't shaded in any way whatsoever. They are just as clear in the bright sunlight as they were out of the package. It seems to me like these lenses are just clear. They are useless to me."
2.0,It says fade resistant within 800 hrs. I've used it less than 10 times in the less than 2 months I've owned it and it is severely faded. Even bolted down it is not that stable.
2.0,The crystals are a lot smaller than I thought. I can't wear them because it goes through my lip and ends up in my mouth.
2.0,Didn't like them. Felt weird when you walk in them. Wouldn't recommend.
2.0,The dress is definitely as described however the material is similar to a light weight swim suit. No double lining on the chest so if you go braless it will be nipple city. But whatever makes you happy. I am going to look for a bra to wear under but I suspect it will be a challenge. I might return it.
2.0,Very large and almost balloon like. I turned it inside out and sewed it to fit my 8 year old son’s hand and it was better.
2.0,One broke n too big
2.0,"This top looks like it is child's size.  The color is nice, but the fabric seems very cheap.  I gave it away."
2.0,"They're cheap readers. One of the three pairs was unusable. The other two serve the purpose. I have rimless readers from LianSan that are quite nice, but these readers are average quality at best. Not awful but I wouldn't buy them again.<br /><br />Update 6/22/16. Another of the 3 pairs is now useless as well. These are not inexpensive glasses--they're cheap glasses. I'm giving them two stars only because there isn't much to expect at this price. If I hadn't had such a positive experience my other LianSan rimless glasses I would not have tried readers at this price point.  Should have known better."
2.0,"I wear a medium in almost everything, and I ordered this in a large and it was still too small! The arm length was too short, and I’m not sure if I just have a long torso but the length was short as well. Great idea though!"
2.0,"The watch doesn’t work we have tried  but nothing happens although very nice ,it’s not very useful if clock don’t work"
2.0,Battery died after just a couple of weeks after gifting it to my mom
2.0,"One of them is larger than the other, but is ok."
2.0,Not very form fitting. Made me look like I had jelly rolls when I do not
2.0,"I ordered these for my child and two of them are a nice fit, unfortunately the other two are cut larger by about an inch around so they slip off and won't stay snug on his face, defeating the entire point of them. If you happen to have multiple children in different age ranges, this may be fine to buy if yours come like mine did, but these were meant for one child only so two are obsolete. (Pic to see the measurement difference.) Disappointed."
2.0,"Not comfortable to wear, it causes the skin to suffocate. I wouldn't advise this purchase. The design-wise it is temporal, soon it would lose its lustre."
2.0,My hands are way too small for this. It would be better for a person with large hands
2.0,"The idea of these seems great. Compact your clothes, keep them organized. But in reality, they are more annoying than space saver organizers. I was recently in Japan and just ended up leaving these in the hotel room instead of taking them back."
2.0,Material was thin and cheaply made
2.0,Could be cute. Order size larger than you actually need.
2.0,Ended up not being me at all lol.
2.0,"Size was comparable to a large, not even close to a small."
2.0,"While I was excited to see this necklace came in a pretty pink gift bag, and the chain and black backing is beautiful, the image itself seems misleading. By looking at the product image, I expected very metallic, carved brass type details, however it is clearly just a piece of paper underneath some resin."
2.0,"Honestly? Not thrilled with this dress. I thought the material would be more of a cotton, but it's that shiny Halloween costume material. It was covered with puffy polyester strings when I got it. I tried it on and wore it around the house for twenty minutes, but it didn't take that long for me to realize that it wasn't flattering (material showing off any bump on my body and the ruffles in the back making me look wider from the side) and that it was incredibly short. It also had deodorant stains right out of the box, which makes me think someone else returned it and they just repackaged it. Maybe another color would hide the fabric a bit more (I got red), but you'd just be better off getting a dress from Forever 21. The quality of those dresses is far superior, if that paints enough of a picture for you."
2.0,These did not look cute on my son. Wasn’t a huge fan of how round they were.
2.0,"Bought 4.  One Came missing the constellation so we returned for replacement, haven't received it yet so don't know how long it will last.  The clasp fell a second one within a couple days went to Joanne Fabrics to replace with a better quality clasp.  Third one we have had about 4 days now and isn't broken yet.  Forth one, husband won't wear because of color of constellation isn't the color pictured on the site.  Plan on using it for spare parts for the other 3"
2.0,Like the idea but have a devil of a time getting the wristband around and on. Even my husband and son have difficulty getting it on me after I charge it.
2.0,"175lbs, 5'10.5, typically wear large. Ordered size large. Great fit and pretty color. However, the material was bizarre and uncomfortable."
2.0,After wearing the silver version of this ring for about 2 weeks… the color started coming off.
2.0,Print was very washed out and hard to read
2.0,Product was smaller than I expected and quality was and looked cheap.
2.0,"They are made from pretty thin plastic which looks like it won’t last.  They sent me the wrong size 2x.  However, you can’t prove it because they don’t put a size on it. Also, one of the shoes arrived with a slight (but definitely noticeable) deformity (looks like it got stretched and pinched a bit on top). I assume the package got folded and melted in the mail, however, if they weren’t so cheaply made, that probably wouldn’t have happened.  Granted they don’t cost that much compared to crocs, however, crocs are so, so much better in every way. I gave them two stars instead of one star because, well I guess they aren’t the worst deal out there (for the money), and I ultimately decided to keep them and wait for my son to grow into them."
2.0,Chart size very off.  Material smelly too.  Bought for valentine's day and not able to surprise my guy.
2.0,Dislike the stitching on the pocket is substandard and the pockets are separating from the garment.  This is a Medium size zip up hoodie.  I have the same in Large and noticed the pockets are double stitched for strength.  Very disappointed and would like to get it replaced.
2.0,"Quality is fine, but the leather color is not complementary to the beads. Also the the &#34;simulated jasper&#34; look more like cheap plastic...I had to return it."
2.0,"Seams ripped. Good materials, warm and comfortable. But seam over lap and stitch quality lack..  SEVERELY. Plus pockets retain lots of moisture. Definitely warm.  Zippers are kinda disappointing. Great fit. Lots of potential just better stitches and seam overlap.  This brand has a good rep according to some co workers."
2.0,Wanted to like it but the top button broke off as well as the loop that goes around broke off after I washed it once.
2.0,"This watch is very attractive, but VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND although I have a very thin wrist, it pinches like crazy."
2.0,"Product is ok in general, but main zipper never works …."
2.0,Received wrong size!
2.0,Purse started to fall apart after a week. I like the size and color just poorly made.
2.0,"Didn't like the material && the fact that it's super thin, definitely not a hoodie that's gunna keep you warm"
2.0,Scratchy material. Fits so so. The sleeves get twisted up and become uncomfortable.  I wouldn't recommend
2.0,Too big it says 55 but is bigger than 55
2.0,"Very cute design,  however it fits very weird. The brim of the hat is very large along with the top of the hat. When wearing it makes you look like you have a conehead or all your hair is bunched up inside."
2.0,does not work as advertised for brass.  haven't bothered to try it on any thing else.  I would not order this again.
2.0,Based on reviews I ordered a XXL. I am 5'4&#34; and about 160lbs and a 34DD in bust. I was pretty disappointed to have the tank fit pretty well in the stomach area (I'm 24 weeks) and just be way too large in the bust. I could have probably ordered a Large to fit in the bust area and been ok with the belly area because it's stretchy.
2.0,Bicycle warped.  Larger than expected.
2.0,I would of gave them more stars but the top of it keeps coming off. I've done swallowed 3 of the top part.
2.0,"I am 5'8"" 180 and the large does not fit well. I usually wear a large for comfort."
2.0,They are beautiful and they would be been perfect it it wasnt because the key chain pieces fell off
2.0,This is a very good bag. I'm using this bag today for the 1st time and so far I am definitely impressed with it.  Its has alot of room in it and its light weight. The bag is strong and durable. Thankyou I had to change my  review to a 2 star as this bag came apart after 7 months of usage. Maybe  I got my money worth or not.
2.0,I do glassblowing demos in my studio. I bought these to accomodate guests with glasses. I have not yet encountered any frames where they stay down in front of the glasses lenses instead of popping up every few seconds.
2.0,Was very disappointed they were too small😞
2.0,"I’m short, with short-average arms.  The sleeves were too long to be considered 3/4 sleeve, but they were too short to be long sleeve.  It was a very awkward cut.  I returned it."
2.0,No lo volveria a comprar
2.0,Although it looked nice it was poorly sewed the hooks fell off thank God it was black so you couldn't see they were missing. Sewers need to do a way better job on putting on the hardware
2.0,"wrist band cheap,gave this to my great grand kid with smaller wrist.Can't change band to fit me either."
2.0,"Made from cheap fabric, not well made, and fits funny. I would skip this one."
2.0,"The style of dress isn't bad but wasn't sure of the fit so i ordered 2 sizes small and medium. the small was snug so i sent back immediately. Why i didn't try on the medium i do not know. Assumed medium would certainly fit. Well fast forward 2 months, weather getting cooler so I'm going to wear my new dress. Ha! Not a chance. The tag says Medium but this sucker fits super tight. i couldn't even zip up the side zipper. Missed the return window. This company won't consider a return even with the wrong tag on. A size 5 for years, a medium shouldn't have been tighter than the small.<br />$35.00 dress going to salvation army with tags still on. Never will i buy from this company/vendor again."
2.0,The material is very thin and see through. One side of one of the belt loops ripped as soon as I tried it on. Cheaply made.
2.0,"didn""t fit"
2.0,"This is cute, but it is way too fussy for a coverup type dress. I loved the material, the pattern, and the pockets. I hated the fit and the fact that it was really hard to get on. It was way too small in the chest (36 D) but crazy huge in the waist. It hung on me like a sack and made me look much bigger than I am."
2.0,lost color in 2 days
2.0,I liked the watch but the band broke after only two days of wearing it.
2.0,I am 5'3 and 145 pounds. Wear size 9 jeans and 36c bra. This swimsuit was TINY. I ordered a large and will be returning it. It is probably super cute if you are very skinny
2.0,Ordered a size up (12 months and my daughter is 7 months) and it’s still super tight in the arms and legs?? After two washes it looks like it’s years old and faded. Not pleased with this one
2.0,The dress is made from cheap material. Totally disappointed. I was expected a nice flattering dress that I can wear casually. It kind of see through and show my lingerie.
2.0,It turns soon quit. I love the necklace but I would have to a buy new one every five minutes.
2.0,"Love the purse & wallet, but the lining of the pockets in the purse wasn't even sewn to the zipper. I can just pull the pocket lining right out. Have to send to a seamstress to fix."
2.0,I bought it thinking that a hiking back pack was sturdy enough for me. The inner part between compartments ripped about a month after purchase.
2.0,Looks very different on me then the model.  Way too small through the shoulders and arms even for Asian sizing
2.0,Cute dress but it fell apart after one was
2.0,"Material was thin cheap , cut to short ,did not fit comfortable over ears would work better for a child"
2.0,falls apart quickly
2.0,Good leather but diifficult to close due to poor design.
2.0,had to recheck my order to confirm these were not for a child. XL adult looked like it was made for a 12 year old
2.0,"Great space and layout to keep what you need organized and on you. I really do love the way the bag is designed and how it can be used in multiple orientations. The only (big) issue I have is that every one of the supplied clips for the straps breaks easily and pops out of the hook, leaving the strap unsecured and a piece of metal pointing out. It's relatively easy to pop these back in but I had to put tape on it to prevent this from happening. Backpack would easily be 5 stars if the clips didn't constantly break."
2.0,"Cute wallet, a little smaller than i thought but the zipper broke 3  weeks after we got it."
2.0,Very cute but clasp broke within second wearing.
2.0,Our daughter was so excited for these! We ordered a size 9 for our 4yr old daughter and they fit as expected. After about 3 or 4 wears (all within a few days) the bows became loose and fell off.
2.0,"Quality is good, but size is small.  I had to buy another set that is more elastic to be comfortable."
2.0,I return this item after just one wash the letters started to peel off. It's really was to bad as the t-shirt was comfortable and cut great. The decal is the issue it's just poor quality no complaint on the actual t shirt itself. My account was credited quickly so no hard feelings on my end.
2.0,Very stiff & thin.  Almost like there is plastic in the material
2.0,"Description Said 3 pack, only received one mask. It is 3 layers but description clearly said 3 pack<br /><br />Mask looks fine but disappointed by quantity."
2.0,"I wore it once and it already seems, feels like it is tarnished."
2.0,"Even the smallest size was too big for me. Sturdy quality, but just didn't work for me."
2.0,It’s super cute but it’s the first inexpensive item I’ve bought on Amazon where my skin actually turned green because it wasn’t coated. Beautiful work for the price but will color your skin.
2.0,These socks developed a hole in the heel area of the sole after just 2 months of regular use (walking and gym; no running). When I buy a pair of Nike socks they typically last for 1-2 years with the same usage level.
2.0,They look good and seem like they would fit but as they are multi colored gems and NOT JUST crystal gems I dont believe these will work for me and am disappointed as they are the nudes with multicolor not displaued like the pjcture
2.0,TOO TIGHT THROUGH THE CHEST. & MATERIAL NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IN THE PICTURE
2.0,The concept of this dress is awesome BUT!!!! the fabric choice is awful. Looks like it will be nice and soft and comfortable (like cotton) but it feels like it should be a high quality outdoor  umbrella fabric....... a no for me
2.0,SOOoOOOo sheer- even the SLIP is see through- might as well just go out in your underclothes. At least that will look intentional.
2.0,They are really way too small for their sizes definitely not an extra large more like maybe a large or medium what I got they need to be bigger they are sized wrong I could not even get my hand in it
2.0,The orthopedic inserts were separate and could cause a fall. The shoe ran small for my husband and the quality was not good.
2.0,They came chipped and cracked when I received them today wasn't pleased make them cheaper if there gonna come cracked and it wasn't the same as the picture
2.0,Would be cute if it fit. Like at all. There is zero stretch to the fabric so if you have a large chest or arms size up. Where the fabric meets on the front of the chest it puckers so looks like you got some frozen nips.
2.0,The size was not compatable US sizz as advertised. I ordered xlrg to upto 13 these would barely cover size 11 shoes. thogh not an expensive lesson.
2.0,"I'm not thrilled with this bag. I suppose ""you get what you paid for' but this bag looks really 'plastic'. I don't think I'll be using it...I guess I'll return it if that's possible."
2.0,It looks cheap and worst thing is shedding everywhere. It was embarrassing to see my husband jacket full of white hair!!!
2.0,"Run a little small, fit tight."
2.0,I got the xl and there is NO stretch around the waist
2.0,Did not like this product it just did not fit right at all.
2.0,Fits good but it's completely see through
2.0,"They came with a dent on a side,on both, everything else was as expected, lite weight, gold color was right. Not that yellowy gold (that looks fake), i decided to keep them, because i didnt had the time to go and return them. But i would have deffinetly preferred if they came in perfect condition"
2.0,I sent these back because they were not soft like cloud slides. There was nothing wrong with these but they weren't what I had hoped for.
2.0,"Love the idea of this light weight wallet! Looks great too. I bought one for my boyfriend and I. When i first received it I kept it on me everywhere and was proud to flash it! About a week in, the credit card slot tore and this made the wallet look so disheveled.  I was so upset! I never had the time to post a review or ask for a refund/ exchange. I'm not even sure if they would accept damaged items."
2.0,These are way too thin! Not too see thru just summer weight thin. They're also almost too short and I'm only 5'5&#34;...
2.0,"Usually wear Med. This shirt is way too large. Also started to fray  on the edges during the first wear. The color red, though, is a deep, rich color."
2.0,The decal started to peel right away and it’s a shame because the fabric is very soft.
2.0,One arrived split at the seam. A second split at the seam when I tried to lock it down.
2.0,Blue shade scratched off ust from being at the beach.. Only lasted a month
2.0,I want to like this however the quality is awful. I would send it back if I could find the original packing.
2.0,"Though the product description for the &#34;Revo Fire&#34; style says &#34;polarized&#34;, the lenses are not polarized. This was the #1 reason I bought them so I'm disappointed.<br /><br />Otherwise, they're as I expected (cheap and functional)."
2.0,Very cheap looking.  Not worth the cost.  I returned it.
2.0,"Great looking purse, but has strong odor when I unwrapped it from packing.  Hope it goes away. Had it airing out for &#62; 24 hours so far. Still smells"
2.0,"Had to return the first pair because the velcro started to tear. Replacement order did the same thing . So very cheap but so very expensive, don’t buy."
2.0,"Absolutely gorgeous maxi romper that looked exactly as it was advertised. However, I ordered a 2X and I am 5'9&#34;, 36/38 DDD curvy and wear a size 14/16 and seriously struggled to pull the shorts over my rear. After struggling to pull the shorts on, I noticed the torso of this garment was also not only too short, but too small in the chest area as well."
2.0,The quality is poor. The size run small.
2.0,"I liked it, but it already stopped a couple of times. The band is made for a small wrist."
2.0,I would not recommend this product! It lasted for a short time I wore it on a bracelet and the beads fell off rather quickly I was very disappointed!
2.0,"It is comfortable, but it only fits strap bands. And it needs to be a little wider hole is to small. It will fit a Magnetic band but again you have struggle to get it on and Slide it up to the watch. And it won’t fit the loop / Stretch bands. Need to make one to fit those bands.  Also you may consider not having to take off watch to scan. Put medical  pin & ID W scan code on the front.  Being a former fireman/ EMT it would be more efficient & Faster for Medical Teams."
2.0,Not true to size...didn't not fit
2.0,"Let me start by saying that I really wanted this hoodie to be awesome. But after I received it, it had too many flaws. First off it is far too small. I wear an XL in all my other hoodies/sweatshirts. Their idea of XL is a small large.  Second, the drawstrings in the photo are higher quality that what you receive. Third, the material is very light.  I’m giving 2 stars because what you receive is worth the money you get . I would give it four stars if I didn’t have to return it for a larger size."
2.0,"Appearance was good and quality looked good, but it bent trying to put on a pair of boots!"
2.0,As expected.  Low quality externally threated jewelry.  Wouldn't pierce with it.  Very little variety in size.  I'll spend more and buy quality next time.
2.0,I was really excited to get these in time for my Oktoberfest party. They arrived quickly and at first glance I was amazed at the quality. They are leather and sturdy looking. I was excited to try them on right away. But when I opened the package I was met with a face full of mold spores and then noticed that they were covered in mold. Very disgusting and incredibly disappointing. Now I have to figure something else out for my party. Complete bummer. I would take pictures but I don't want to further expose myself to mold. They are back in the bag for good. Giving two stars because if they were not moldy I'm sure they'd be awesome.
2.0,It's a lot smaller than it shows in the photo. Not even a hoodie just basically a skull flap that goes over your face. Only has one button not three. At least it's soft though.
2.0,Cute but do not stay up.
2.0,It was too small and I wish I had returned it and got my money back. Also poor quality.
2.0,These shoes are cute and comfy but poor quality. The metal loop that holds the strap broken in two weeks.
2.0,"I ordered two shirts from Allegra K and that was probably the worst decision I've ever made. They sent the wrong size and the shirt was way too big. I thought maybe I could wear it as is for a casual outfit, but no. When I tried it on I felt like I was drowning. It so did not look like the picture at all. Never order from this brand because their material sucks and they totally screw up your order. False advertisement anyone?"
2.0,"This is as described regarding size, color, and wording. It's not very sturdy.  This was a gift for my mom. She loved it for sentimental reasons of course however I do not trust putting my half on my keys."
2.0,This was way too big.  Bigger than I expected.
2.0,"I thought was was buying tank-top with a regular, breathable screen-print on it, but this the image on the tank-top is made of a non-breathable rubber-like material.  The area with the screen print gets hot, and sweat builds up when you wear it out in hot weather, especially in the sun.  Even in normal temperature it your chest gets sweaty under that screen print, when wearing the shirt (unlike normal screen printed tees, which breathe).  I wouldn't have purchased it had I known.<br /><br />There was no mention in the product description that the image on this tank-top wasn't screen printed like most printed T-shirts are.  This is some kind of rubber transfer I haven't seen since in the 80s (because people hated it!)."
2.0,Within a month the seam by the zipper tore open. I don't carry heavy things in my bag but would also like to add that many people who buy bags of this style are using them to carry text books.<br />I sewed it back together and my own stitching has kept it together. There is still parts that were originally poorly sewn and falling apart.<br />The shoulder strap is in an odd spot so the top part does not fold properly over.<br />Adorable picture on the bag but if i were you i would skip buying this poorly made bag.
2.0,The bar is reall long  and the jeweles  won’t stay flush to your ear.  Have to constantly adjust it  or it sticks out really far and looks bad.
2.0,"Purchased these for my husband; ended up returning as they had little to no elasticity. So repeated uses would've stretched them out, rendering them useless to stay up. [in the course of a day of covering his nose & mouth & lowering it]"
2.0,Very soft. Much smaller than advertised. I had to give them away. You can see straight through them.
2.0,They just last like one week.
2.0,Pretty but much too small
2.0,It not bad. The pearls are a very white. I was lookingfor a more creamy color.
2.0,Cute dress but it’s knee length and the sleeves are more 3/4 length:( I was hoping for the mid calf length that was advertised. Cute dress but not what I wanted… I might just keep it for my 13 year old because I hate returning things.  I’m 5’6” usually about a size 5/6 and 130lbs and ordered a small. The material itself is okay
2.0,"Sized well, really nice material. But they aren’t put together correctly. Brand new, first time warn, never seen a washing machine - and they already look like they are coming apart."
2.0,"Just OK. Would not purchase again. The fit was alright and the fabric seemed to be good quality so I kept it. But after only a handful of times wearing it, the fabric has degraded wear I sit down. I have the same dress in blue and the exact same thing happened."
2.0,"I had purchased the medium olive green which was too big so I ordered the navy in a small, the navy came in a much different material, more of a linen blend feel and fit, it has no give at all so it was difficult to put on and the top is very tight but the bottom is huge.<br />The olive I received first was more of a thicker t-shirt material.<br />I'm keeping the one I originally received."
2.0,"I've had many different article of clothing over the years. Some run a little over sized and some run a little under sized but this item was at least two sizes too small despite what was displayed by the label. Additionally, I know that this is not merely my perception because I had many other similar type shorts and all of those fit pretty much as their labeled size displayed. This is the first time that an ordered item has not even been close to the advertised size..."
2.0,"The sweatsuit was nice when it was delivered but after my grandfather wore it for 2 days without washing, they were completely pilled. I’m extremly disappointed."
2.0,"It keeps you warm, however, stitches come of easily. Nice look but very low quality."
2.0,"I'd say my wrists are just slightly on the larger side of average and this strap is still too tight on the last hole. I gave it 2 stars instead of the 1 it deserves only because of the look of the strap. I love the way it looks/feels. But it's meant for a hobbit or some other small humanoid creature. I still do wear it, sometimes, but always send up taking my watch off in a rage when it starts bothering me. I'd let you know the exact size of my wrist but I am way too lazy to do that. Stop being so needy."
2.0,"Not cute at all. Did not look like the image and was way too small, even after following the size guide."
2.0,"I really loved these pants when I first got them.  They are comfortable and stylish, and fit perfectly at my waist.  However, I've worn them only 4 times and washed them only once (following washing recommendations) and now legs are pilling at the crotch. This is so unfortunate because I really love these pants."
2.0,"Cute necklace, but it is not black like the ad says.  It is a gun metal color."
2.0,"It's a pretty dress and I don't want to stay it runs small but it does have a small hole to put your head in.  It lost some stars because the dress that came in had some brown stains on the front, not sure where it's from since it arrived in a bag. Part of the detail started to fray too. I didn't even have the opportunity to wear it yet.<br />Ordered another to give them another chance... hopefully it will be better."
2.0,Length too short but liked material.
2.0,"See through material, runs very small, don't waste your money!"
2.0,I ordered these shorts two sizes larger than I normally wear and they were still too tight. I wish I would've returned them before taking them on vacation.
2.0,Sorry to say that it’s to long and to loose and the waist is to tight.  🤷🏻‍♂️Weird combo..<br />Purchased a medium size and it’s not comfy.<br />My Jeans are 32W  - 30 L  it should have fit like a glove. If I do a large I’m afraid it gonna be good for the waist but everything else will be like xxl.
2.0,Order a size bigger. Nice sandals but had to return as I am a size 11 and dat size was. A size 10 fit
2.0,"It's totally NOT the way it's pictured. Warm, but anything BUT slouchy."
2.0,I was excited to try this heated vest considering I spend a lot of time outside. I went by the size chart and it was way too small so I had to return it. Very disappointed with accuracy of size quide.
2.0,"The bag itself is not bad…Good size, lined and OK for the money (I knew I was not paying much).  However, the first time I pulled the zipper, the zip itself fell off and could not be reattached.  Will probably still use the bag on occasion, but the lack of zipper is disappointing."
2.0,"After reviewing this product, I decided to get a pair. My first pair lasted one month. I could not  even see while swimming after using them 4 times but the seal around the eyes is not too bad. I contacted the seller who gave me a coupon for a new pair. Same outcome with the new one. Definitely they are not worth my $20. I do not plan to keep spending money on these Splash Pro swimming goggles and to get a pair every month."
2.0,Look like women's sunglasses
2.0,"It's a very pretty shirt, but I was extremely DISAPPOINTED with how it fit me. I purposely ordered it in a larger size because I figured when I washed and dried it that it would shrink up somewhat. But when I tried the shirt on it was extremely snug on me and didn't look good. I ended up just giving my Mom the shirt."
2.0,"I purchased this necklace as a gift for my friend. However,  she was on a trip and I could finally gift it to her last week. The heel charm is a nice size, not too small or too big. The chain ia another issue. It is very cheap. My friend put it on right away and not even an hour had passed that her skin turned green and the chain turned dark. Too late to return. Would not purchase again and if you do maybe just for the heel charm and change the chain."
2.0,"The two earrings are different colors. One brown and one orangish, they do not match at all. They also are missing the metal post needed to attach to earlobe, so you cannot wear them. Useless product."
2.0,"This is listed under a filter for cotton and describes itself as ""high quality fabric"" and ""high quality waffle fabric"".<br />Do not be fooled this is cheap polyester with spandex, mis-tagged most likely on purpose as they are careful not to adress what the shirt is made of on the sale post so that they can claim ""innocence"".<br />It is extremely thin, looks nothing like the photo, is nonsensically cut and shaped, and has many unfinished seams with hanging threads as well as button holes that look to be  made by a person who has never seen one before."
2.0,"The product didn't look like style in the picture.  Also, looks like a woman's shirt."
2.0,it is so cute - but one of the pockets are sewn shut...
2.0,"Not real silver, not hypoallergetic"
2.0,Claims to be compression fabric but is not.
2.0,Thin...poorly sewn...not uniform color...returned for refund
2.0,Over all it looks pretty but when you wear it? It’s see through its not the one that I am expecting the fabric is cheap and I think you can wear the dress good for 3-4 times the quality of dress is really poor.
2.0,"I am returning this for 3 reasons. The fabric is very odd. Super artificial and I fear if I am near any open flames. The fit was ok, but the seam on the chest was separating and it was dead center. The belt is also odd- it dresses it up but there are no belt loops to hold this slick favor. Belt in place and it doesn’t quite line up with waist seam. It’s two parts and it’s been connected like an empire waist. Overall disappointed."
2.0,Picture was too big
2.0,"The look and style of this boot is beautiful however, it has its flaws. Boots run a bit small. I wear a 7 and purchased a 7. They were too snug even with thin socks. I’d suggest going a size up but since there are no half sizes, you run the risk of the being too big. Also, if you’re looking for comfort, these aren’t the way to go. They are very clunky even with the sleek design and they don’t feel very stable when walking. I tried them at gone hoping I could live with the flaws but for the price , I decided to return then and try a different brand."
2.0,The straps broke as soon as she put it on 🙄😫😡
2.0,These will fit a taller woman. I am 5 foot 2 inches. They were super tight and so long they drag on the floor. The material is thin. Prepare to let the world see everything if you wear these. Yuck.
2.0,"i was really exited to get this ring in, but when it came, it felt like plated plastic, it was really light, and small. It felt like if i tried to resize it then it would break. i'm pretty disappointed."
2.0,Material soft and stretchy. A little big but I think if I would have gotten a medium it would have been to small. Zipper opens constantly and at first wash it tore. For the price I paid. I expected more.
2.0,I was a little dissapointed with this screen protector. I purchased this with a Moko case and this screen protector just popped off as soon as i put my phone case on. Its probably a good screen protector just not with the case i purchased.
2.0,These were so cheaply made.  When it arrived it was so tangled I couldn't even get it apart to try it on.  The ankle area was also so small it would have wripped if I tried.  I returned this but it's been a few weeks and I'm still waiting for my refund.
2.0,"The Obi-Wan episode 1 version doesn’t use the red button for power up and down like the other version I have does, it has a huddle little button instead that’s a pain to flip when in hand"
2.0,"I really live this dress. Perfect color, fit great. Even though I hand washed and dried flat it fell apart after about 5 wears. And I and not rough on clothes."
2.0,"Nice quality, but they don't work for me."
2.0,"Loved the look and feel of this sweater but unfortunately after one wear, there were several spots of pulling and it was no longer wearable.  Shame because it was also very comfortable."
2.0,The robe was great until I washed it. It shrunk so much I can’t wear it !!
2.0,Well made but I think the stone was to large and not believable.
2.0,super cute however smelt  my daughter couldnt wear this.
2.0,"Just like many others had stated, the ball fell off of one of my earrings, I thought I could give them a quick fix with some super glue that I had - but then it broke again and by that time I gave up. They were nice while they lasted I guess, but they also appear bigger on your ears then you'd expect."
2.0,"Band looks good, and clasp works well/ feels good. BUT, the band repeatedly pops off the watch body, making it unreliable and so unwearable. Will need to find a different brand with similar features in order to wear my watch!"
2.0,"It looks like really nice quality wide brimmed hat, but it is too big that when the drawstring is tied, it doesn't fit well on my head because it makes the brim of the hat block your view that it is uncomfortable that I sold it instead of returning it."
2.0,Totally see-through and not high-quality material. Returned this immediately.
2.0,"I always wear a medium and these are very small. The lace on the side is not like normal stretchy lace that other panties are made of, they are just like a cotton screened t-shirt with a muggle lace accent...definitely a big disappointment."
2.0,"I bought this 2 sizes too big because I like my pajamas really loose.  I liked the color and the plaid. The pants were 5 inches too long but because it was so cheap, I didn’t feel bad chopping off that five inches. Also no pockets. But I have only washed and worn the pajamas a few times and I will have to stitch a 4 inch strip of seam already. Really disappointed with that as I hate to sew Well, when the price is too good to be true, don’t buy it!  Unless you have a sewing machine and like to sew."
2.0,I loved this skirt and it would have been perfect for my occasion. The material was great and it fit well. The only thing that really bummed me we’re the cuts that were made which are completely uneven. In front and back you can see how one side is way longer than the other. Will be returning.
2.0,Shirt was returned.
2.0,Not dark like I wanted but they are cute the screws come lose easily
2.0,You get why you pay for super cheap quality and feel. When I put them on they don’t look bad I like the style but it seams like they don’t seal you face it’s open on the sides. Not sure if I will use them.
2.0,"Very soft inside and thick, but too tight on the legs for my daughter to even pull them on. Had to return them"
2.0,"Super cute costume! Be warned though, it runs on the small side. The advertising is a bit conflicting because they say plus sizes and the next sentence states small/medium.<br /><br /> I'm 5'7&#34;, 130 pounds, 36C and I can squeeze into this outfit. If I really wanted to I could wear it but it would be uncomfortable. I wouldn't make it over an hour.  There is no stretch whatsoever and it pulls from top to bottom.<br /><br /> I'm guessing a 5 foot four 110 pound body would fit nicely into this costume.<br /><br /> The fur leg warmers are pretty awesome and is the reason I am keeping the costume and not returning it.<br /><br /> The costume seems well-made and the colors are nice. There is a shimmer to the material as well. The fur hat is adorable and fits loosely without falling off."
2.0,Runs small!  I typically wear an XL and the XXL did not fit.
2.0,They are not oversized! they are typical sized... not sure why they say oversized..it was the only reason i bought them
2.0,Only 2 of the 4 pairs are wearable the other two are twisted and broken. Love the two I can wear though
2.0,way to expensive for the variety and colors
2.0,This shirt is made of the strangest fabric.  I don’t even know how to describe it.  The outside is really soft but the inside is very scratchy.
2.0,The size is so not true to size.  Ordered a large thinking a medium would probably be too small. Definitely needed an xlarge instead.  No girl wants to order an xlarge and when she is a medium.  I don't know whatever happened to standard sizing but I promise you I will return every time anything I buy that doesn't fit true to size.
2.0,Supposed to be 5x.  More like a 1x.
2.0,I returned it as it was too tight
2.0,Cute. My 4 year old and 2 year olds loved them. However they don’t stay clasped shut. These earrings are constantly falling off.
2.0,Too boxy and large for any petite/slender body types.<br />Bought because reviews said it was too small for a lot of people but apparently they were cows
2.0,This was thin and the fit was small
2.0,"It's really cute, but it doesn't stay together and is really easy to lose."
2.0,I ordered this a size larger and it's still kind of small.
2.0,"They’re cheap, what should be expected? I wanted a flexible wedding ring to wear to instead of my titanium one. This is my first experience with rings like this, but I’m now left with a nasty ring of dry skin."
2.0,I returned this jacket. We loved the print and the fit but the inside is we so stiff and awkward with all of the seams exposed.
2.0,Son un poco difícil de poner y el cierre se baja
2.0,"I bought these hats for my daughter and I to use Halloween 2022. The hats were too small, even for my 11 year old daughter's head. We could put them on, but they would fall off easily or slowly come off so you have to pull it down frequently. We only wore them a short time."
2.0,This fits way smaller than what the size states.
2.0,"Pretty, however they are very small, toddler size."
2.0,Nice cover but difficult to secure it. Drive in high winds and almost came off. Have to look for a better way to secure it.
2.0,I had used this for one week when the plastic clasp broke.  I fixed it with something else and then the next week the snap on the pocket where you keep your cellphone broke.  Seems it is poorly made.  So disappointed!
2.0,I ordered a small because I do it it would still be small but turns out on it was too big I had to give it to my daughter
2.0,"Ok, so I get my shirts delivered today and immediately noticed that the size is not xxl but rather xl instead. This seems to be the case with every garment I've ordered that originates from the Chinese, they're always cheating American consumers one way or another & it's not worth my time to get into a dispute w/them about it because it's always a lengthy wait to get the right things from them. You won't get xxl so just ignore the option.<br />Anyway, I ordered them big because as you can see from the feedbacks from other consumers, they run small. In my case it didn't even matter because they sent me what they wanted to send me, I had no say. They definitely are tight like Spanx! Xl is more like a medium and the chest part is measured incorrectly because my man nips are exposed on both sides. Unlike the American & Japanese, they will not  measure things accurately and these are likely a cheap knock-off of a quality American brand.  The material used feels fine & the stitching looks good but I haven't put them through a rigorous real life test so we'll see.<br />They will fit a scrawny man or boy but if you're taller than 4' 10&#34; and weigh more than 120 lbs you'll never fit these right.<br />I have to sit & stretch them by hand to even fit them & that's just annoying because they shrink right back to little kid size anyway.<br />Listen to these feedbacks about size & quality because you'll be sorry if you don't."
2.0,"It's a very nice band.  The red is bright and makes a statement.  Unfortunately, I developed a rash from this band.  I believe it's from the lack of airflow.  When on, it's entirely flush to the skin. I don't believe I have sensitive skin, if it weren't for the rash, it would be a five star review."
2.0,"Although I like the color and style, they easily fall out of your earlobe. The hook of the hoop is too short nor did it come with backs” to the earrings."
2.0,It says large bit there is nothing large about this. It won’t even fit on the chain.
2.0,"Good fit, but not very warm."
2.0,"Material felt harsh & scratchy. The t-shirt was slightly tight & short, normally my size is medium, a large probably would have fit better but I didn't like the material so there was no point of exchange it for a bigger size."
2.0,"Very cute. But u only get the rainbow ones. The are much bigger than a 20 gauge so for that I am giving it a really low rating cuz it is falsely advertised! It is way too big for a nose peircing and is more like an 18 gauge or so. Cute tho. And good qualit. Just false advertising drives me crazy, because mine do not fit and I bought them for my nose. So i can't do anything with them now."
2.0,"These are nice, quality is great, but they run very small"
2.0,"The tightening latch does not work properly and keeps loosening on one side.  I was looking for better quality as an alternative to the three-pack of kids' goggles we usually get at Costco, but these definitely fall short."
2.0,Pants themselves are fine. The color of the pants in the photo is misleading. The pants in real life are rust colored.
2.0,"This dress is super long and too small. I’m 152 pounds and 5’6, curvy and athletic- and I ordered a medium and it was way too small. Look at the pic of me in another outfit to get an idea for my size. Hope this helps."
2.0,This is cute but it is way too small. I am a big girl (5'8&#34; and 180 lbs) but only wear a size large normally. This is ridiculously small and I could barely get it on. I doubt this would fit an adult if you are more than 140 lbs and it may still be tight. I gave it to my 9 year old daughter and it fits her great.
2.0,"Update #3: Returning bracelet for last time. It tarnishes in under a week. Not happy about that but more unhappy I have to give it up. I liked it, clearly. Darn it.<br />Update 2: So, rec'd replacement and the misspelling is still there and the punctuation problem is still there. So I don't know whether the vendor bothered to look at all the reasons why I returned it, but I've decided to keep it. Reason being... it being imperfect parallels what it's trying to communicate. That and it'd be a pain to send it back again, wait for replacement, and perhaps be in the same boat. Besides, the scratches were at least not an issue this time. It was clean.<br /><br />ORIGINAL COMMENT: Loved the slogan and the bracelet isn't bad. It's a little scratched and the silver clasp gets stuck & twisted. So, I took that part off and fed the ends into that end, then braided it. It's better. Plus, since it's a little scratched, it'll be like a car's 1st scratch. I won't stress over it getting scratched. If the company that sent this to me wants to make it better, they could send me an unscratched version."
2.0,Make sure you read the fabric information.  Calling it a sweatshirt is very misleading.  It is made out of the same fabric as a compression shirt.  It fits about two sizes smaller than how it is advertised as well.
2.0,"Not really shaped well. If you have tiny Barbie feet this is for you. If you have normal sized feet- good luck!! The ankles are so small it’s almost painful. Not worth the price I had to pay. You’d think that being pantyhose they would stretch SOME so you could get them on- no, other brands in this size work fine for me."
2.0,Runs small. Stretchy material
2.0,I thought the lenses were going to be lighter tinted and more sheer. I purchased the silver and they are mirrored.  I hate mirrored lenses. They are also tiny in width. More for a 5 year olds face.  Lastly they are scratched.
2.0,"The dress was decent, but I wish it were available in petite. It was long for my small frame."
2.0,Small for it's size.
2.0,In reading the reviews prior to purchasing I knew this would run small. I purposely bought a size up M. The product I received would barely fit a toddler.<br />The color is pretty though.
2.0,"The way the dress looks in the picture, made it seem like it was going to be long, but the dress was above my ankles. I'm  5.7 and got a large.<br />I new the medium would fit me better but I was worried about the length.<br />I was a little disappointed. :("
2.0,"Too flimsy for me, also the UV on this material is way to bright even after a double wash and UV blocker sprayed on it. Not going to be useful for bow hunting.  Gave it 2 stars for that. But will work for paint ball or Turkey hunting."
2.0,The elastic around the waistline is so thick and uncomfortable cheaply made
2.0,It was to small for me and I did not like have it look on me
2.0,After wearing in my daith piercing for a month the metal corroded.
2.0,The bow fell off on first wash.
2.0,"The dress runs small and has a tight elastic band at the back. I sent it right back. It felt soft, but order several sizes. Stop putting elastic in dresses that already have belts. Not eveyones torso length is the same.<br /><br />Cute dress. I wanted it to fit."
2.0,This belt stated it was an extra large but it’s way too small!!!
2.0,"Love the way the glasses look but after just one day of wearing them, I noticed one of the arms was tilted and they sit on my face crooked now. They are very cute but the arms are thin and flimsy, and I can see how it would have been easy for them to break like that with just taking them off the face. Also, these are small. Luckily I have a small enough face to where it wasn't a huge issue, but yeah they're not normal sized glasses. VERY cute though."
2.0,"Style: Glossy Black and Blonde Tortoise Shell Fade / Amber<br /><br />Lenses: I really wished these the lenses had an anti-reflective coating. There's reflection from the inside of the lenses, especially around the outer edges. It was really distracting while driving. The Amber tint was perfect; not too dark but not too light, it was just right. Ultimately this was overshadowed by the reflection. Safety first!<br /><br />Frames: I feel like the shiny chrome hinges and glossy finish on the frame are the main culprits for all of the lens reflection I'm getting on the inside of the lenses. The fade from Glossy Black to Blonde Tortoise Shell was executed well but again, I can't stress enough SAFETY FIRST! Maybe if the finish were matte and the hinges were anodized matte black it could prevent the reflection?<br /><br />2/7/20: As of now I give them a 2/5 stars. I will be returning this pair but I'm not giving up! I want to give the Matte Black / Smoke Fast Lanes a try before I give up on them entirely. I really like the style! Will update.<br /><br />2/9/20: They're going to remain at a 2/5 stars. I received the Matte Black / Smoke Fast lanes and they had the same issue. I still get the reflection. It's actually reflecting my eyes and upper cheekbones in the lens. It's not the frame. I also ordered the Paso Robles in Matte Amber / Smoke to see if maybe the it was the style that was just prone to reflection and no... I had the same issue. It's the lens..."
2.0,It fits okay. Not worth the cost.
2.0,These gloves are not warm. I wore them to drive my daughter to school (in the car) with the heat on. Drive was about a 45 minute round trip. The temp. was about 35 degrees F and my fingers were cold. My wool gloves are warmer. Maybe if you are riding a motorcycle in high winds and you put a hand warmer inside these shells they might keep you warm but for everyday regular use? Not for me. They are also stiff and not comfortable on the hand at all. I am returning them.
2.0,I'm missing one part and thats the shoulder piece
2.0,"Sadly, the socks moved a great deal on my feet when I walked making them very uncomfortable. I am returning them, thank you"
2.0,☹️<br />Proportionally not a good fit!
2.0,"It arrived on time. It's a cute neck piece however, when I went to open it to wear, I noticed it was broken. It arrived broken. To be more clear, one of the links was not hooked. I couldn't wear it because the piece that was missing was a critical part of the necklace holding up (the middle portion). Without the piece being present, the necklace wasn't wearable. I'm very disappointed."
2.0,Fit more like a shirt
2.0,"I wore these tops for working in a hot kitchen.  They were comfortable and sweat didn't seem to be visible. However,  the neck gapes and looks weird."
2.0,PRODUCT NOT AS ADVERTIZED
2.0,"I ordered the medium according to the size chart but it is way too large. Given its price, it's not worth returning it. Cheap boxers if they fit you."
2.0,Hello I had bought these to replace some face coverings but didnt realize the material started to unravel making it less tight and just had to re sow. Maybe bad batch?
2.0,Absurdly small.<br />Edit: It's clear from reading other reviews that orders are fulfilled from multiple manufacturers and probably different fulfillment centers. So you're really just rolling the dice on what you'll get.
2.0,"Great denim fabric .  Wish it was shorter …. I took sissies to it.  It’s also big and as I wear it , it gets bigger.  Slides off without in zipping ."
2.0,The little clip that keeps the band from flopping around broke on the first wearing. I found it in my bed so it’s not like I was doing any strenuous activity. There seems no way to reach the company on the Amazon site that I can find. This is the second time it’s happened (we repurchased again because the watch was still good).
2.0,Popped a seam the first time I wore it
2.0,They are cut small. That should be in the description before purchase.
2.0,"Why is each hat a different size? Some are clearly kid sizes? Did I accidentally order a family pack? Also, is there any reason a pack of something needs to be individually wrapped in plastic and then each plastic wrapped item placed in a bigger plastic bag? I am disappointed that I thought I  bought what I thought was many hats, when I can only comfortably wear a few."
2.0,"Even on low heat the decal melted and stuck together. Luckily it still looks mostly okay, but now there's some holes and clumps in the letters. It does fit big girls (~200lbs) pretty well though."
2.0,"Very very tight, it does stretch but it's tight."
2.0,This bag is cute but matches it’s price.  The “leather” is quite plastic and the bag tips over all of the time spilling its contents.  Had to toss it.
2.0,"The size is as described, but the bag doesn't hold any shape on the arm or when set down. It's a hobo, so I expected it to be boho-slouchy ... but I didn't expect it to simply collapse in the middle. I'm returning it."
2.0,not very comfortable for a sleeping bra- somewhat scratchy
2.0,"I didn’t expect much for the price and I wasn’t wrong. These are useless in daylight and barely work at night. Yes, they do help some with glaring headlights at night, but my regular sunglasses do too. The lens is cheap plastic and easily scratched. Best use I’ve found is letting my 4 year old grandchild play with them."
2.0,Did not fit like a dress. Barely qualified as a a large sweater either. Colors were not as pictured. Returned.
2.0,"I was disappointed with the size of the garnet stones. They were advertised as 4mm but measured only 2mm. The necklace is hardly noticeable on the neck, its so small and thin. The color of the stones is a good  deep purplish red and it arrived within the time limit. NW"
2.0,"Absolutely beautiful!  The quality seemed perfect when I received it.  I wore it once, washed it on a gentle cycle. Wore it again and found that it's coming apart at the collar.  Im deeply saddened.<br />If you do order, i would order down a size n"
2.0,The Purse is Cheap Quality - not at all what is portrayed. It is not worth the price listed. Very Disappointed
2.0,Our daughter loves the dress. The fit is small. She is 5'3&#34; and needs to wear leggings with it. The lace top is also a little short waisted for her. It fits her like a girl's dress.
2.0,"Although very well constructed this bra runs very small around, I bought the size I always wear in bras, the size that in other bras fits me perfectly and in this bra it is too tight to wear. Also this bra is difficult to fasten in the back, it has two sets of hooks and the top set is difficult to reach. I should have sent it back but instead I will donate it,"
2.0,"This dress by Honwenle was awful on me. Not flattering at all. The pattern (blue leopard) was pretty in photos but looked like a hodge-podge of designs when I received it. The colors – blue, black and white will appeal to some, but the fabric looks haphazard when you see it. The design is v-neck with a belt (faux wrap) but when closed, it was too high under the breast. Made me look pregnant. It was ill fitting and too big. I plan to return it."
2.0,Its not really white.. sort of a cream color.  Probably will be too warm in the summer to wear since is faux leather.  Nice lenth.
2.0,"Buy a size bigger than you would normally buy, those things are almost too tight for my liking. I bought XL like I normally do because of my big legs and they fit like wranglers"
2.0,I loved the hoodie itself but I got it a size bigger then what I actually wear and it was to small.I should have got it either two sizes bigger It was so tight
2.0,These did not cover my butt crack<br />I orders the correct asian size but the are just made too small.
2.0,The necklace was just clear filament or fishing line. Of the two I bought one had permanent kinks and bends in the clear string. The other necklace's clear string was curled up like it had just come off a spool. It would not lay flat either.
2.0,"I got this necklace to wear with a navy blue dress, but instead of being two blue-tones, it was blue and green mixed with orange.  When put over the blue dress some of the orange goes away, but it was definitely blue and green alternating pieces.  Not recommended if you’re looking for navy and light blue colors."
2.0,I would go a size up. I can't even close it.
2.0,Fits oddly. Not a normal XL
2.0,"Too small. It would've helped if the item had a picture with a little girl holding it to get a size perspective. Good bag for a toddler ballerina. For my daughter, it's good enough for her shoes and her hair items."
2.0,"I have large hands for a woman, this is easily a size 8.5."
2.0,Fits very tight. Photo looks better. The fit is somewhat odd. Don't care for the material.
2.0,I did not like the way they were made.  They were too small around the waist and too short.
2.0,Loved it when it came in.<br />Worn it since Monday. Taking it off during showers and workouts and today the cross snaps in half.<br />Disappointed.
2.0,Ok what the heck?  The length is way off I the one I received! The bottom beads might touch the top of the knot ...urg I would have to say it's at least 4&#34; shorter th as n I expect ....might look like this picture if I put it on my 4 year ago granddaughter.
2.0,Sizes way off!
2.0,cheap looking  and damaged
2.0,It’s ripped after 3 times used.
2.0,"Its cute but poor quality, too snug and the skirt come undone the first wear"
2.0,"I loved this dress when I got it.  It fit good and looked great and reasonably priced, but after washing it, there was a pucker at the side pocket that made it stick out at the lower hip. It only happened on one side so it was a problem with the stitching. It stinks because it was adorable at first and I could only wear it once. Disappointed."
2.0,"Runs a size smaller - is not loose fitting as one would expect with a Hawaiian shirt.<br />Used it for a work function.<br />Colors were vibrant, fresh china factory smell.<br />Would buy again in larger size."
2.0,I was not a fan. The material used is very slick. It was not compression but very loose and baggy. I wear size medium religiously and the mediums they sent me were to big and very baggy.
2.0,Too small for my neck
2.0,"The dress is beautiful, but definitely to small. I couldn’t zip up the back."
2.0,Thought I was getting the shoe pictured but I received a flat shoe with a flower and no ankle strap.  My fault for not realizing the description did not match the picture.  Kept the shoes regardless and ordered shoes that were more similar to the picture.  Guess it can't hurt for the girls to have choices between flats and heels.
2.0,Awkward design.
2.0,material cheap cotton...Not spandex and polyesters as described
2.0,Not the material I wanted but at least it fits
2.0,actually received different shirt but decided I liked it and kept it
2.0,Returned this - cheap material and didn’t look like it would last the event I was hoping to use it for
2.0,They fit very small on my face.  Almost felt like kids sunglasses.
2.0,"This dress is beautiful, soft, and fit well.  Unfortunately, wherever it is a little more fitted, for me my chest, it is too transparent to wear."
2.0,"I got all the rest of the pack, but no R2D2. I pretty much ordered just for that one."
2.0,"The pockets are great, and so is the length. The material is silky. The sleeves/arms are what I didn’t like. They are attached under the arm only, so in me they looked like sweat bands or arm bands."
2.0,Not organic. May not even be 100% cotton (especially shiny printed material on outside). Label says 100% cotton. Made in China.<br /><br />Good fit though and comfortable.
2.0,"the rubberized strips covering each ear stem slip off immediately as you remove the glasses.<br /><br />The lens popped out after a few uses as well - easy enough to pop back in, but not great quality here."
2.0,Shows clear glass lens but the lens comes with print on them so you have to buy new lenses.  Boooooo
2.0,"Had really high hopes, however the piece to tighten the shoes doesn’t stay tight causing the shoe to slip off. We tighten the shoe and then within minutes it’s loose again.  Thought by spending a little more on shoes would mean better quality but it didn’t work"
2.0,"Super cute but almost impossible to do the zipper. Unfortunately I'll have to return it because it takes 15 minutes for someone to help me get the zipper up or down. The zipper just catches everywhere, getting stuck and threatening to destroy the whole garment. I don't think I'd be able to go to the bathroom if I left the house in it, since you'd have to take it off to go pee.<br />For the record, the small fit me nicely. I'm 5'5&#34;, 115 lbs."
2.0,"I sent this bad as I returned the Drone after it didn't link or Bind or Pair with the handset, and the Seller Was Cheeky.  Nothing against this product, It arrived in a timely manner, the package was received open, and resealed, by whom i have no idea."
2.0,They were small I had to give them to a friend!
2.0,"Material is poor quality, itchy,scratchy. I got a large, normally I am a medium and it was still a bit tight at the chest. Too short in length for me."
2.0,"GLASS. Real Mystic Quartz/Topaz cannot be scratched by quartz and will feel cold in your hand because gemstones do not conduct heat the way glass does. This stone is warm and failed the scratch test. The metal does not look like solid sterling and may be plated copper or brass. Time will tell with that one.<br /><br />EDIT: I did find the metal purity stamp, it's on the bail."
2.0,Made well.  I should know because I had to take this dress apart and take it out on both sides by 3 inches on each side just so it would fit my 8year old. It is made for someone with a TINY TINY waist and larger chest. I would estimate that the waist on the size 34 was at best a 24 chest would have been about a 32. Runs very very small.  The stitching is beautiful but unless you have a tiny waist avoid purchasing this dress.
2.0,"Overall disappointed with this purchase. Color is not beige, it’s more ivory or cream with a touch of yellow. Shoulder pads are very exaggerated and go far off my shoulder."
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress because it looks so cute online, but not on me.  I can usually wear dresses like this with a high waist but this made me look frumpy. I loved the length but the dress isn't right for me."
2.0,Pants too long. Did not look like image.
2.0,"I was given the iSnug for my birthday on July 26th and this morning, September 5th, it fell apart. I emailed the company asking for a replacement but have yet to receive a response. The armband itself is just a little too big for my arm and I have to keep pushing it up. If I had to pick again, I'd pick a different brand."
2.0,I was not happy with my order it didn't fit any way it was described. Not happy . looks to me a whole another top.
2.0,I do not like how it is bunched up in the back..
2.0,Shorts were too small
2.0,"I am 5'6 and 150lbs, normally wear a Large. This Large fits like a Medium, not a Large. Even though it is stretchy, the arms are too tight, the dress is too short, and the waist sits directly under my breasts. Very unsatisfied. To return, I have to print a return form for inside the package, then bring it to the UPS Store (10 miles away) for THEM to print the return label. There are loads of UPS pick up points nearby, but they can't print the label, so now I have to trek across town in an annoying way. Unfortunate purchase all around."
2.0,One sided
2.0,Not the same color as in the photo.
2.0,These glasses look great and feel nice but are too fragile. The frames broke from the top of the lens in 2 weeks. They were handled delicately and worn with no pressure added.
2.0,"The material is thick and warm, however, its pretty small/short and would only look right with high waist jeans. Had I ordered a bigger size and had a better fit, I would've given it more stars."
2.0,Its a nice cardigan but the beige color is way off.. maybe more of an apricot color
2.0,"Large, very light  .<br />You get what you pay for."
2.0,I think these look really good on my boyfriend but they are way string-ier than pictured. I like that look on men’s gymwear but just be prepared for it:)
2.0,Found removal of links extremely difficult in spite of suggestions by others. Believe spending double this amount will solve the pin removal issue.
2.0,I liked the look of this watch but it pooped out when I dove into the pool- returned it MB
2.0,The pants were fine length wise but the shirt was super short and wide definitely not made for a tall man the sleeves are super wide it was awarkard ! I wld not  recommend this set
2.0,it's too large
2.0,"Cute and stylish, but the posts and the balls both started to turn black after only a week in my ears. Made my ears itchy, which makes me think they're not really as silver as they say they are."
2.0,"This coat is NOT waterproof! I wasn't outside in the rain five minutes before my back was soaked through. Its a great for mild weather but NOT waterproof and its very thin fabric. I ordered a small and still had to tighten the waist band as tight as I could, the sleeves are large enough to wear three GIGANTIC sweaters underneath. Fabric is nice and soft and zippers work well."
2.0,"Came a day early! it's made of really cheap material. I like that it covers my knees and shoulders, and it fit well. The zipper on the side got really stuck, and was hard to fix. The torso section of red is a different shade of red compared to the skirt section. Definitely a casual dress. Probably won't work for what but bought it for."
2.0,These are not made right. The knots are to big and it doesn't slide right. Dont buy
2.0,They are ok as long as you don't wear them in the heat or get them wet cause they turn color fast.
2.0,This was so much smaller than I thought it would be and ended up giving to a friend who wears a size Small.
2.0,Bebe signs came off soon after recieving. Contacted seller. Still waiting for a response. Hope they can help because the boots are super cute!
2.0,"These were very cute and soft when they arrived, but just the three pair of sweatpants in the wash and they came out pilled and scratchy. I’m not a laundry novice, and have only once ever seen fabric pill this completely this fast. My daughter was very sad about it. Super cute, not sure how to avoid the fabric problem."
2.0,"The outer fabric on the boots reminds me of something a Halloween costume is made of. For infants or toddlers, these are probably fine. For my rough five year old, I needed something with better quality. She would have destroyed these within a day."
2.0,"Printed not real good, wasn’t impressed"
2.0,"earrings were too small, I needed something larger."
2.0,It shows a line in the back through your clothing so cannot wear.
2.0,"It was too big, and the fabric was really weird and plasticy on the bottom. I returned it"
2.0,The mask is too thin for me.
2.0,Bought these for my dad for Xmas and they looked like good quality but from what he tells me the back of the slippers don’t hold up very well and sink in. And this was after only a couple days of wear.
2.0,Did not look like the fabric used in the main picture. Was very disappointed when it arrived and I saw the material. Very thin and feels like elastic.
2.0,The dark leather is not what I received so I had to buy a matching leather watch to opposite the lighter leather.
2.0,This is meant for a nine-year-old
2.0,This is a very cute top but the fabric was a heavier weight than I expected so I returned it.
2.0,"The coat fit good, looks good, but quality is bad.  Likes/dislikes:<br />- There is no pocket on the outer shell chest, it is just the zipper.<br />- The outer shell is really thin, like almost see through thin.<br />- I saw the other reviews so I knew there were no snaps to hold the sleeves in place.<br />- Color is good, my daughter loves it, she says she is warm, but it is the beginning of Winter in Idaho, so we'll see.<br />- One of the zippers on the shell hand pockets broke first day<br /><br />Would not buy it again."
2.0,"The top is very cute and looks well made, the shorts on the other hand looked extremely cheap. The elastic wasn't sewn in well and the crotch was sewn of centred making one leg of the shorts longer than the other... If you love the top and do not care about the shorts it's worth it but if you want to have cute shorts as well I would suggest trying something else."
2.0,These work fine but the seams show through everything and looks stupid. I've seen others that have no seams on the outside and might look smoother under clothes. Live and learn.
2.0,I got this bag a few months ago and loved it but the lining on the front flap pocket tore within the first month so I had quit carrying it. I wish it hadn't torn because I'd still be using it.
2.0,the snaps dont stay.cant wear them too cheap
2.0,Description says 100% cotton first and then 60/40...it is NOT 100%
2.0,Marked up over 50%. My son begged for it for his costume so I bought it despite the terrible reviews. Cheaply made and you could see the actual price of the product that they attempted to cover. What a rip off.
2.0,Shipped 2 correct colors and 1 incorrect color.
2.0,I order one size down and its still too big because the item stretches a lotttttttt .
2.0,Very cheaply made!~
2.0,I had to return mine because the arm hole was too large (I bought a size small). The color is same as what is seen but the fabric was not that great!
2.0,"The lining of the sleeve was just so horribly made. Very scratchy and pokey. Really wanted to like this product, but the pokiness of the wrist was a deal breaker for me."
2.0,"I was shocked by the package in the mail, it was so small and felt more like a shirt than a coat. It is extremely thin material, though it offers some warmth.<br />  I liked the rich dark brown in the picture, it is not an accurate brown, the actual brown of the coat is lighter brown more on the reddish side.<br />  I got a medium and it was the right size in most regards, except it allowed no movement in the arms, I felt if I raised my arms in front of me, I'd rip the coat. This seems a design flaw, no doubt the next size up would be too large."
2.0,"links do not stay flat, leather rolls up"
2.0,Run small not soft kinda rough a little disappointed
2.0,"It's cute, but nothing really exceptional A great value and it will be nice for the newborn to wear during the summer."
2.0,"Very pretty, however runs small.  Size up 2 sizes."
2.0,Tha size is too small.
2.0,It was tangled up & knotted & most jewls fell off :-(
2.0,"I was very excited for this watch. When it arrived and I took it out of the box and put on my wrist, it felt very cheaply made, light, flimsy, nothing like my Seiko 5 sport, so it went right back."
2.0,The waist band was much higher than expected and the top was very thin
2.0,"This shirt is definitely not sized correctly. I wear a ladies 14 and ordered a 2x.  The 2x is snug on me.  I expected it to run small, but not that small."
2.0,Nice concept but cheaply made.
2.0,"Doesn't stay wrapped around head, maybe because I toss and turn too much. Wore it twice and it came off twice"
2.0,"So, I tried putting one in my nose for work the edges are sharp where the top clips in so my nose piercing started to bleed and I couldn't get it in. So, thinking not so much and went another route. By the way, my metal nose rings are 12g so I don't think it's b/c they're too big!!!!"
2.0,"Really like these but I only got 3 masks, Instead of the 4."
2.0,"it's not a flannel shirt as description say, although nice thick cotton."
2.0,it did not fit. the sizing is too small
2.0,Like the quality but the color is way off. This is not brown. It is more plum or purple in color. I will keep it anyway but will have to get the brown one I originally wanted.
2.0,Glasses don't look good on me.
2.0,"The dress itself is fine. It was as described, however I ended up returning it. I purchased the yellow, but it was a brighter, almost neon, shade than in the photo. I was looking for a softer shade. I also don't think I would have been comfortable in the dress. I purchased it for a wedding, and I did not want to be adjusting the dress all evening. The cut on the chest, coupled with the wrap style and chiffon material, made me almost positive or would be slipping around and making me self conscious. This style of dress would probably be suited for someone with a smaller frame and a smaller chest (I'm a size 12/14, 36DDD)."
2.0,Very cute dress.  Material did not hang well.  Bunching at the hips with extra material - did not lay flat on hips.
2.0,"They seem comfortable, but I will need to size up and buy more."
2.0,Quality of item poor- very thin material. Doesn’t appear to have partial cotton as advertised- no label attached. Colors/ graphics nice - the two year old will probably like that.
2.0,The tie clip had the wrong initial on it.  I requested a J but apparently it did not register when I entered my order.  It came with the letter B.  :( :(
2.0,"this dress had so much material that I felt like I was wearing a parachute!  Because of this, the dress is very heavy.  Not for me.  Had to return."
2.0,very nice but super small and high waist banded
2.0,"The silver one broke and I mainly ordered this for the silver ring :(. But I have the black one in and its OK I guess. Rather hard to open and close, especially awhile its in your nose."
2.0,"I like the fabric, very much like the photo on the listing. The hook closures take a lot of finesse to hook together and once together they don't stay connected. I am very disappointed in the sizing of this item. I understand it is an asian size however, the seller automatically upgrades your size for you without telling you. I usually wear size xs, so that is the size I ordered. Going off the sizing chart I was confident it would fit. When the item arrived I received a size Large. When contacting the seller they stated I could reorder my correct size. I informed them I ordered the correct size the first time (xs), but received a size L. I asked the seller if I want a small or extra small how would I get that size and they told me to reorder. No way to get a size small?"
2.0,Cute style! Super flimsy material looks cheap.
2.0,This necklace is cheaply made and not a good quality.  I would not order again but my 17 yr old is happy with it.
2.0,"They're nice, but they didn't wear very well. They are starting to rip. Disappointed in the product."
2.0,"I love the concept of these earrings, unfortunately they arrived broken. It's a pain in the neck to return them because the delivery center is across town and I'm not making a special trip. I'm out the money paid which is disappointing."
2.0,"They say 57 inches for 3xl, but that's not true.<br /><br />I'm a size 51, the shirt got on, but didn't look right.  The front of the top was so very low, that you would have to wear a tank top or tube top for modesty.<br /><br />The body fit strangely.  Baggy(ish) in strange places, somewhat tight in other places.  When I sit down it is just too tight.<br /><br />Returning immediately.  Could have been cute, but their sizing is a mess."
2.0,Pretty color but weird non stretchy fabric and super small and see through
2.0,Skirt was not as expected. Color was off and it was too short.
2.0,"Because ""shipping is so expensive"". I am returning the product because it's smaller than I'd expected (based on reviews). I bought it at a discount, and contacted the seller to see if they'd exchange it and also honor the same price. Instead, they asked me not to return it, and they'd give me a 10% discount? For something that doesn't fit?"
2.0,"Way too freaking small! The top fits great, but the bottoms looks like it was made for a freaking child, probably fits my 5 year old sister. Really disappointed :/"
2.0,Beautiful blouse. Comfortable material. Blouse shrunk upon washing :/
2.0,This did not meet my expectations. The fabric was thin and the style was very boxy.
2.0,Lost color
2.0,"In the picture it looks like its a black hat. When you receive it, its navy blue. Quality isnt good, it has terrible form, looks cheap and tacky. As a subaru owner I was hoping for the quality you expect with a Subaru product. I wanted to put it on two different times and I hated how it looked so i stil havent worn it. Its disappointing."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this, but the torso was way too short and the bust part only came up to my upper stomach!  it was really awful.  I had to return it.  It might fit others, but I ordered a medium and unless you have really short torso, not sure if it will work.  The fabric was nice as was the color."
2.0,"Its so cute at the top, but I don't know if I'm too tall, or too short, but the crotch area just bunched up and looked weird. It also was a bit wide for me in the stomach region. If I was pregnant I bet I would look so snatched in it.<br /><br />The fabric was good quality and the color was cute! Real country vibes."
2.0,Very inexpensive item and it shows in the cap - very thin fabric with no reinforcement anywhere. You get what you pay for.
2.0,"I would be keeping this except that the neckline sewing is incorrect so it rolls over and shows the seam with the liner. Material is nice, love that the dress is lined, and cut is flattering. I may try ordering again just to see if I can get a better quality sew job on the next one. It's super comfortable."
2.0,these earrings looked so cute online. Once I got them in I didn't like them at all. They are huge and the fringe seemed like an after thought to the beads.
2.0,the qaulity is poor you do not accept the merchandise to arrive damage
2.0,"these have a super thick and comfy sole, just the way I like my slippers...  for about a week.  after that your foot impression is there permanently and all the cushion is gone and now they fit sloppy.  wouldn't recommend."
2.0,Not even spelled right
2.0,"Its nice and fits, but the lights arent the same color advertised for the black tutu, which was a major selling point for me."
2.0,"Somewhat small, but REALLLLLLLY cute!"
2.0,"Lindo color y estilo pero muy estrecho del busto, no coincide con las tallas que indican."
2.0,I like the idea and style. Cheap craftsmanship.
2.0,"Advertised as polarized, but definitely NOT polarized. Got compliments on the style though"
2.0,"I love the Piece but the chain is extremely Small, i cant fit it on my neck, and very thin more lol ke a feminin touch to it. I will have to get a chain later."
2.0,Nice but nose piece too big and lenses are too far apart. Not a good fit.
2.0,"I AM RETURNING THIS DRESS BECAUSE THERE IS A DEFECT IN IT. ON THE TOP OF THE SMALLER BLACK PIECE OF FABRIC ON THE FRONT OF THE GARMENT THERE IS A &#34;BULGE&#34; IN THE BLACK FABRIC APPLIQUE.  THE BLACK FABRIC ON THE TOPSIDE &#34;POPS OUT&#34; AND IT IS MORE THAN NOTICEABLE BECAUSE OF THE STARK CONTRAST BETWEEN THE LIGHT PINK FABRIC BACKGROUND AND THE BLACK FABRIC.  WHY THE MANUFACTURER COULDN'T HAVE CAUGHT THE ERROR IS BEYOND ME.  PERHAPS THE DRESS WAS NOT INSPECTED BEFORE THE DRESS WAS SHIPPED TO ME.  GOING FORWARD, I WILL NEVER, NEVER, NEVER PURCHASE ANY DRESS FROM A FOREIGN VENDOR!!"
2.0,Poor quality.  Post fell off of the pearl on the first day.  Company quickly issued refund.
2.0,I was expecting it to be a little longer
2.0,Hey very pretty big except I bought it for my Pandora bracelet and it didn’t fit
2.0,poor quality...seems to be falling apart without abuse.
2.0,"The bottom fits good, but not hold or support.  The top is flimsy and will not cover large breast.  Worse of all you CANNOT RETURN IT!"
2.0,You get what you pay for.  Fabric is cheap feeling and heavy.  Not what I needed for the summer.
2.0,"They are pretty, but bigger that I was thinking they would be from the picture. Wore them for a while."
2.0,Sleeves too long. Not up to my quality
2.0,Seemed like it was good no to fall off even though it was not too big. The cups were not the best.
2.0,Does not fit garmin 935. Sadly will be returning
2.0,"Cute dress. Stitching has come undone at the pocket, and now there is a hole after wearing only twice."
2.0,not good it got ugly quickly
2.0,"I'm a bit conflicted about this shirt.  I bought one and loved it.  It fit great and looked fantastic.  I moved and it got lost so I bought another one.  The sheer part on top was shorter and more narrow on the second one, so it didn't look as good as the first one.  I'm afraid to buy another, worrying I won't get one as good as the first again.  :("
2.0,"I was searching for cotton dresses, this is not cotton"
2.0,Arrived as expected. Watch doesn't keep time.
2.0,"Cute dedign,but too small need to order a size larger than you wear"
2.0,I have a 2 year old and these did NOT fit - they are huge (and my child is not petite at all) the glasses fell right off his face. To be honest they comfortably fit on my face so I’m not sure what age child these would really work for.
2.0,This is my second dress from this company.  The dresses are smaller then what is advertised.  I probably will not order dresses from Lunajany.
2.0,"Let me start by saying that I hate swim suit shopping.  However, I am going on a cruise in January and need a couple of suits.  I bought this one because of the loose looking appearance of the top.  When I got it I quickly realized that I hate the back of the top of the suit.  It has a bikini like tie across the middle of the back area that is less than flattering on someone with a little back fat.  The bottoms of the suit are okay, they are boy short style.  I kept the suit because I am going to use the bottoms with another swim top.  I would not recommend for a plus size woman."
2.0,Cheap & Cheesy... size is great for 3 graders
2.0,"I loved these leggings they look very good and ate extremely comfortable, BUT it is June 3rd and I got them on April 18th and there is a big hole at the bottom of my bum because the stitching came loose. Very sad and disappointing:("
2.0,"Looks good, but not comfy.  Also doesn't hold hair as well as others."
2.0,Gave these to my daughter for Christmas. Several came squished in the package.  They bend easily so she reshaped them but I am afraid they will snap if she has to do that often.  Good thing they were cheap.
2.0,Muy pequeña.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:f0c854a6de3b15f22e948cef1eb36e8c]] Bought this for my daughter. By the second time she wore it the design peels right off. Definitely not worth the money. There’s no longevity to it at all. Very cute when you first open. It looks like it’s good material and will last long but it doesn’t. Would not recommend.
2.0,"moms hat is kids size, and kids hat is doll size"
2.0,Where the bill of the hat meets the hat itself is very uncomfortable.  Do not suggest buying this hat.
2.0,I do not like the ways it looks on me.
2.0,It says on the description blue mirrored lenses but they are not the typical mirrored lenses.  It's more like a blue tint.  Not what I expected but my daughter wanted to keep them anyways.
2.0,"Totally see through, way longer than pictured"
2.0,"Within 10 days of using this product, the bristles were so bent/worn that it is useless!!  Not worth the $$!!"
2.0,The silver rubbed off after a month. Very disappointed.
2.0,Made for skinny people ! Not the average person! Like wearing daisy dukes!
2.0,Made for medium size heads.  Short side profile.
2.0,"My son had worn these for about a week when the laces completely shredded, making the shoes nearly useless.  Amazon was extremely accommodating and took the shoes right back."
2.0,"Item is inexpensive and good material, but mine had a constant protrusion in the stomach area and zipper always exposed."
2.0,"Doesn't hold accurate time, it loses minutes of the accurate set time."
2.0,It wasn’t the best fit. I have to say that the model looks way better then I did. I wear a size 8 but I guess you need to be a 0-2 to have it look right.
2.0,Very cute but way too small and I even ordered two sizes up.
2.0,They slip off after one wash. Don't bother
2.0,I bought these to avoid using sun block too much.<br />I still get tanned and burned at the end of long road cycling day. and top of the sleeve rolls a lot exposing my upper arm where I got burned.<br />It's better putting on sunblock.
2.0,"A bit disappointed, I wear an 8-10 I ordered a 12 because I wanted then to be baggy and they barely fit.  I may return them because if I wash them and they shrink I won’t be able to wear them."
2.0,I ordered the recommended size but it was so big and it did not fit me well. It could be because I’m so short. Not a good dress for me.
2.0,"It lasted just a day... I got this for my daughter, and she only wore once, broke with the first try."
2.0,"I wasn’t expecting anything great given the low price of this costume, but wow even with such low expectations I was disappointed. Made of cheap polyester so thin it’s slightly see-through, ill-fitting, lopsided, lots of loose threads."
2.0,I wore my spanx with it and it ws fine
2.0,Not bad.  A few wiggly parts but for the price not too bad.
2.0,"Comfortable but not durable.  My mistake for thinking that it was maybe a fluke, the first pair were comfortable and helped my poor feet enough for that after the first pair failed I bought two additional pairs, (to have backups) both both of which failed in less than 2 months. These are too expensive to not last more and a few months.  Too bad because they are comfortable...."
2.0,I like Russell products but the sizing is always a bit off.  I previously bought a medium sweatshirt and it was way too tight. My latest purchase --a large--was laughably big. My size hasn't changed that much.
2.0,Cute if you wear a B-cup
2.0,"It fits perfect, but everyone can see everything, the fabric is so transparent =(, so I cannot wear it.<br /><br />But looks gorgeous.  So trans-lucid  T.T"
2.0,"I thought the fabric was softer,  and much larger than expected"
2.0,Supper soft and pretty colors BUT they are a little too snug and short. I could use a XL but they only come in one size:(
2.0,"The bag is OK.  The handles are way too long.  And rolling it back up in to the plastic holder is kind of a pain.  However, once rolled up in the plastic holder it is nice and compact."
2.0,The fit is small for a large size. It's pretty snug in the crotch area. Just FYI
2.0,I’m usually M/L; ordered XL based on reviews- stop to tight
2.0,Very sheer. But cute
2.0,"I like the skirt, but the top is garbage. The string ripped off as soon as I went to tie it- and the lace rips very easily. Low quality, don’t even want to mess with returning it but very disappointed."
2.0,The material was see through even though I wasn’t bent over.  Once I did it was like I was wearing nothing at all. The pants are cute but needs less peeping underwear.
2.0,Very cheap. Looks the same as the AO Pilot sunglasses but just picking up thid pair you can tell how cheap they are.
2.0,"Love the dress, but the bustle didn’t come with it. The dress doesn’t look much like Princess Peach without the bustle underneath. My 7 yr old daughter was disappointed."
2.0,"Good quality, but too small"
2.0,"I buy my daughters a new handbag every year for Christmas. Ranging from $$$-$, this handbag is nice but it’s stiff and the zippers are oversized. I returned them."
2.0,Beautiful and sparkly but clasp broke 2 days after having it and now it’s lost ☹️
2.0,I am returning this garment as the width does not fit my girth!
2.0,Shiny thin material. Overall cheap look. Do not like and will not wear
2.0,"I ordered the wine color, and the color is nothing like the picture. It’s way lighter, not nearly as dark red."
2.0,These bras are very pretty and extremity small ... I had really high hopes .. But no ! I'm a 36DD there's no way these would work even wearing around the house . I wouldn't recommend
2.0,The item was tagged wrong. I ordered a large but the waist tag said medium.
2.0,"I ordered this costume accessory 29 days before my '80s Party, but that wasn't nearly enough time -- the item arrived a full two weeks after the party.  Luckily I paid $2.50 for it, so not much of a loss.  The fit is as other reviewers have described -- not gloves, as stated, but a knit covering with a thumb hole. That still would have been adequate for my party costume, but it became a moot point.  Nowhere on the product page did it indicate shipment from China, or I might have sought out a different item."
2.0,"After washing and wearing this top just 2 times, it has already began to she wear especially at the seams and the bright red is now faded. Very disappointed. Now it's outside the return window."
2.0,"Not at all supportive. The straps are wide set so they constantly fall off my shoulders, which has never been a problem for me with ANY other bra. Useless product. Buy from another brand"
2.0,Rubber necklace and an addition fragile chain that comes with it.
2.0,"Although the style was super cute, they’re not durable enough for toddler use. My 3 year old snapped them on third use because the hinges aren’t flexible and so he stretched them too far when putting them on."
2.0,Sized very small. Even small for my 3yr old. Ended up being useless because of it.
2.0,Extremely poor quality. They literally cut the hem with scissors. So the bottom of the tankini is not straight. Looks like a child may have cut it. Also straps are very short. Hard to tie a bow
2.0,"I love the color and the way how it fit, I just wasn’t happy with the material."
2.0,The boob part is too spaced doesn’t cover my hole boob on either side. I’ll probably only wear it for hubby in our own home. I’m a 36C.
2.0,"The costa Loreto sunglasses I ordered came with a bent frame. Due to this I had to send them back. Overall the galsses are nice, but I was send bad merchandise."
2.0,"Unprofessional. This was intended as a gift and I am leaving the country, so won't be able to return, unfortunately, but it's the last time I purchase anything from Pearl Source on Amazon. I bought quite a few things from them over the years, both on Amazon and from their website. The pearl strand and earrings I bought from their website were exactly what I had ordered. What I bought from them on Amazon tended to be different than advertised--this necklace definitely does not have round pearls (they are potato shaped); I also bought 2 pairs of earrings whose size was wrong (they were smaller). They also have beautiful, high quality pearl jewelry. It's a pity that they are so careless when selling on Amazon."
2.0,"These are not suede as described. They are a thin, shiny cloth that stretches and the “leather” trim is just plastic. They look pretty, but are not what is described and I am returning them because they are not warm and also not worth the price."
2.0,"Runs small, looks more faded then in the pics."
2.0,"Way too large and really  no shape to it. Hated this top so much, I chucked it in the garbage! I ordered a small I'm 5'6&#34; tall, 145 lbs and 34C chest."
2.0,"Great concept but after using it, everything I've placed in the rubberized elastic just fall out.  Literally everything.  I spend most of time putting everything back on the organizer after a couple of days of use.  Mifi device, mouse, external battery, car charger, extra adapter, etc.  I think I'm just moving back to the good old pouch method."
2.0,I wanted to like the dress but the stitching on the neck line arrived undone. I planned on wearing this for a graduation but no longer can. I ordered a large but it does fit me a little big I should have ordered a medium.
2.0,"Its silly  but I spent a couple days looking for the ""just right"" pair of cupcake earrings and I thought I found it. When I opened it they were not as described. They are not two toned they are solid gold color.  I'm not going to waste my time on an $8 item to return and wit for replacement etc. it was just disappointing."
2.0,I really want to love this bracelet. I added a bracelet charm (pandora charm) and it’s so adorable to wear. The reason for the low rating is because it unscrews easily. It is most likely to fall off your wrist if your not paying attention. Ended up returning. :(
2.0,Im not quite sure how they fit!<br />I did not recieve the correct boot!
2.0,The metal band is slightly rough around edges and the magnet isn’t strong enough to keep it clasped. It was constantly coming undone.
2.0,"Appears to be a great product, the outer shell is light and seems durable, also fits great alone! However, I ordered a size small and received a small shell but a medium inner short with the chamois, which also seems comfy IF it were the right size. The medium is baggy on me and does not fit well in the short when on. I am hoping to keep the shell and just exchange the liner, but am waiting to hear from the seller..."
2.0,"I bought these for gifts.  One infant got a rash that was odd, like a raised blister almost wherever the dots were, not like just a flat red spot, but actually raised up a lot.  So not sure if it was just his sensitive skin (he has eczema) reacting ... luckily he didn't seem to be bothered by it, but he was only a  few weeks old.  Also the socks are SMALL - I got 6 - 12 month old size and they barely fit on a newborn, so buy up a size or two."
2.0,Poor quality .  Pictures and words were mismatched
2.0,"The lace tears easily! I perhaps it was me but, all of them tear and badly"
2.0,The wrists were so narrow that it was almost impossible to get them on my 2.5 year old.
2.0,Returned.... Didn't heat
2.0,"THEY RUN SMALL, I AM USUALLY A 14 & I COULD NOT ZIP THE PANTS, TOO TIGHT."
2.0,Smells very weird. Like cheap perfume! Washed and can’t get odor out. Very strange. It’s also see thru. Disappointed.
2.0,Ordered a 5x and in reality it's about an XL. Very cheap fabric. Would not recommend.
2.0,The inscription was so small you would never be able to read it with the naked eye. This was a gift so I typed out the saying and put it in the box with the bracelet just so she would know what it said... Other than that it was nice enough
2.0,Cheap and it did not come with a case as the description says it will.
2.0,"I ordered the two pack and One of them a brown stain on the white part. Very disappointing, I was only able to use 1 for the parade I bought them for."
2.0,"Band was nice but the finish wore off wishing a couple of months. Definitely not something I would recommend for an everyday wear band.<br /><br />The kit was sufficient for the swap, but construction was loose and clunky. Overall the band was very nice, until around day 10.<br /><br />The band started to show signs of distress and wear. By day 30, there were extreme wear marks. By day 60, I ordered a new band."
2.0,The fit was not flattering like on the model. the top half was baggy and bottom was to tight. I returned it.
2.0,"The tights looked great in the package. They were the color and brightness we expected, and they looked exactly like the picture on the website. The reason I gave it 2-stars is because the first time my daughter put them on there was a tear in the seam at the top of the waste band, and as she adjusted the fit the seam lower down on the tights ripped. She was not being rough putting them on, but they ripped easily. I was able to sew the seam so she could wear them for their intended purpose (part of a Halloween costume), but I'm not happy with the quality of the sewing/material used on this product. I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,"This could be a fantastic bra if it were the correct size. I wear a 38D in Lunaire bras. I'm 5'2&#34;, 172lbs. This bra is waaay too small everywhere. I also didn't care for the double hooks. There is a circle with two hooks at top & two hooks at bottom. Bottom ones are easy to hook but those top hooks, very difficult. I love the color & material. Hopefully I'll lose a little weight & I'll be able to wear it."
2.0,Too small through the bust with 2 sizes larger than I normally wear.
2.0,Do not work for dropping weight in Crossfit. Cheap plastic will not stay locked. Spend the extra money and buy some good weight locks.
2.0,The concept of the design is nice but it looks so cheap. The silver part isn't even metal it's plastic. This should be sold in a dollar store.<br />Sorry I purchased. Might get one use out of it before all the beads fall off.
2.0,"These pants are NOT NYC winter warm.  I had to wear a layer underneath them.  In terms of sizing:  I'm 5'3 107 lbs, and I ordered a size 4 sensing that I might have to accommodate an additional layer.  I'm keeping them because they're comfortable and I'll probably use them during cool fall days."
2.0,The dial is too dark relative to the hands’ ability to differentiate from it. It is illegible under most lighting conditions.  I regret the purchase.
2.0,One of the latches will not stay closed
2.0,Wallet is very skimpy.  Credit Cards do not fit well if you put more than two in each side.
2.0,Fits to small.
2.0,"Cuts off circulation in the legs because the elastic bands on top and bottom are very thin and cut into the legs..., support socks need wide bands. These do not have that and are therefore not useful to me...."
2.0,"I ordered the &#34;Coffee&#34; which is a one-size fits all. I am 5' 3&#34;, 120 lbs and it was too big. The material was nice and soft, but it was not flattering on me and basically looked like pajamas. I also didn't care for the color difference on the sleeve cuffs; it was just too drastic for the style and made it look like a little kid shirt. The sleeves were also really long, and I have long arms. I did like the cinching on the bottom sides of the shirt, which made the shirt look cute from the side, but from the front it was too wide, and I even have big hips for a small girl.<br /><br />If this review was helpful, please click &#34;Yes&#34; or &#34;Helpful&#34; below!"
2.0,"These look pretty on screen. In my hands and on my lobes, OH NO!  They look matronly, like my grandmother would have worn in the 1960s. I will wait until my 80s to wear these. Maybe.<br />There's nothing really wrong with these earrings. They are just not what I hoping for."
2.0,Save your money. I wore them for two weeks before one broke.
2.0,sized up and it was still too small by the bottom of the dress. quality was okay
2.0,Decent product but thin compared to another product I got from a different vendor. Gave these to my mother in law
2.0,"Although very pretty, it's nowhere as long as it appears. Very disappointed. 😔"
2.0,Good quality but runs really small.
2.0,"The lowest hole in the shirt fell right over my boob. It would have to be worn with a tank underneath, and I hate having to layer a tank under simple shirts like that, so it got returned."
2.0,The letters are different thickness.  See diff between the  v and e.
2.0,average!
2.0,"Beautiful hat.  Just DO NOT get it wet.  DO. NOT.  I was attacked my a wave at the beach and went under for a split second.  The hat dried to a crispity crisp and is starting to split and crack really bad.  This should be $19.99, not $50.  Far too expensive for its fragility."
2.0,It is too long and not the color I was looking for.
2.0,All of mine are too itchy to wear
2.0,"Came exactly as it looks in the photo, but way too small so I had to return it. Order a size or two up."
2.0,"good quality, but size large is more like a small or medium."
2.0,"I guess I should have read the fine print and ordered a size up. Or maybe two sizes up. I wear a 36, but I like a 38 for a looser fit. So I ordered the 38 but can’t even button them. Quality seems poor, very cheaply made. Both front pockets were sewn so poorly that they have huge holes in the bottom, rendering them useless. Even if they did fit well, I would not be thrilled with this purchase. I strongly suggest you do not buy these."
2.0,Large for the size.  This is pretty if the size was more accurate I’d love this dress.  Good value for the price.
2.0,The bag looks nice but do not put any things slightly heavy in it or it will start to break. The top pocket actually broke open and my phone's fell out during a trip. If it were more sturdy then it would have been a great backpack
2.0,This dress runs small I usually wear an 16 so I order a 3X thinking that I would be safe ordering a size up but it’s fits like a Large.
2.0,order up one to two sizes... arrived on the small side & then shrank considerably!
2.0,The mask was to small for my nose and face.
2.0,"Show was way to small, even after following sizing directions."
2.0,Although these can be “sized down” the buckle ends up resting on my wrist bone. Plus the buckle adds bulk. I’d recommend getting a band sized to your wrist and not an adjustable one. I have a woven solo band now and it’s more much more comfortable and better looking.
2.0,"It was way too tight and I have a small head.  It doesn't stretch even though it says ""elastic."""
2.0,The quality of this product was so so fabulous but the seller kept sending out the wrong size so I couldn’t keep it. I was extremely irritated that the problem kept happening as I really wanted this.
2.0,I bought this set for my anniversary. I was really close to the date so when one of the pearls fell out I didn't bother to return it because I needed something nice to wear. I was disappointed with the structure integrity of this product.
2.0,"Loved how it’s true to size, fit perfect for my daughter. However, material is to thin. You need to wear something underneath so it won’t be see through."
2.0,They were great for a week until all of the clips started to fall off and I had to keep reattaching then and tightening the metal clamps. One of the clamps won’t stop breaking apart when I go to attach it to my shirt. Now I’m going to order a new pair of much higher quality and that’s what I recommend you do now. Go spend an extra $5-$10 on a pair that won’t give you headache.
2.0,"the bracelet I received is the same bracelet-but looks much less pretty and colorful in person.  I will keep it, but just know if you order, that the colors are not as brilliant and it looks cheaper in real life.  But, what should I expect for $20.00???"
2.0,"The dress seem to be stright cut and not as curvy as the picture. It does not not run small, therefore buy your size. Brought a bigger size, thinking it would fit because of all the reviews and it's a bit big."
2.0,My husband is 6'2&#34; and 200 lbs.  I ordered the XXL and it was too small/tight.
2.0,"I like head scarfs, this scarf made from soft thick material, pretty color but it is loose; i have regular head and scarf does not sit in place. I am disappointed because i really like it."
2.0,I ordered what I thought was the appropriate size using the manufacturer's chart. It was so small I couldn't possibly try it on..
2.0,Very cheaply made. Finish is rough. Looks like it came out of a vending machine for a quarter.
2.0,"They didn’t fit perfectly and pop out, even after screws are tightened.  You also get glare on inside of glasses if there’s light behind you.  Something I didn’t experience with the factory lenses.  Wouldn’t buy again."
2.0,"It’s very cute and the drink hole is fine, but this mask tends to slip down a lot. It didn’t in the beginning but after washing it a few times, it’s completely defective. It doesn’t cover my nose anymore."
2.0,Got this in ivory and dress fits accurately however it's incredibly see through so be aware that you need to have nude clothing to wear underneath
2.0,"I love these piercing jewelry, but, unfortunately they keep falling out.  I secure them and check frequently, but, they still end up falling out and they are so hard to find. ugh"
2.0,The quality of these frames are excellent for the price but unfortunately I can’t wear these glasses. The lenses are only my myopic in the center 2/3 of each lens. The sides are blurry and not completed in the myopic range I ordered. This causes you to have no peripheral vision within the lenses. It’s too bad…these would’ve easily been 5 star quality had the lenses been properly finished…which is the whole point of getting them.
2.0,Love the design.  Looks cheapish on.
2.0,The contour didn’t quite line up like it should and they were a little too tight for me
2.0,"Thought the pendant would be dainty but it is not.  The chain has no specific hook for it to be thread through.  The clasp I’d way too small for anyone to close it. I am bringing it to a jewelr tomorrow for either a clasp, or a chain.<br /><br />There was no choosing what gift box this gift  came in. So of course,this was the foam box.both pieces in plastic bags, presented poorly.  Tag says made in Thailand.<br />Disappointed."
2.0,"I received this band in late October 2018. It's mid-February 2019, and while I was on a run yesterday the band suddenly ripped and the watch fell off my wrist onto the sidewalk.  When I received the band I had a feeling it wasn't going to last very long. The rubber is very soft and not very thick.  The little piece that holds the strap against the band actually failed about a month ago, and I have been using a hair tie to keep the band from flapping around and catching on things.<br /><br />The reason I gave this 2 stars is because I wear my watch 24/7, including the occasional ocean and pool swim. The constant exposure could have been a factor in the failure.  However, I'm not very hard on my devices, so it could just be poor craftsmanship.  The bottom line for me is I won't buy this again.  I'll spend more money on something that will last longer than 15 weeks."
2.0,Material is a little weird feeling
2.0,"Gorgeous dress - was so excited to receive.  It does run VERY tight so need to lose those extra 10 to have it actually fit.  biggest disappointment was the sleeves are strangely long.  I normally have issues with sleeves and pant length so this one being too long is weird.  Biggest disappointment is that there is no belt as shown in the picture.  This is a very tight dress and has loops for the belt - so for my shape (square in waist), the belt is needed to define that waist.<br />Dont want to return it, but seeing other shopper pics that have belt - realize they sent me an incomplete dress.  Not cool."
2.0,I know that this cheshire cat tail and ears is made to look a bit shabby because I have seen it in stores looking that way. Mine arrived dirty as well.
2.0,very cheap material and ties. Not worth the discounted price.
2.0,Sleeves are too short. I ordered a size up and if I was keeping it I would go with my usual size. Bummed this didn't work cause it's a great price.
2.0,xl size is very small
2.0,This dress looks nothing like the front picture and it was really disappointing. It fits super awkward and weird. I had to cut it to make it look somewhat decent.
2.0,Junk I would say it is equal to aluminum witch is not a good metal for this
2.0,It was not the right fit. It runs small. Cute but I didn’t like the fit. Will go up a size.
2.0,Not thrilled with the material or the colors.  You get what you pay for sometimes.
2.0,I returned this. I'm only 5'6&#34; and the crotch of this romper was nestled firmly in my...well...crotch. I felt like I was in a vice grip. Definitely for a shorter person
2.0,The overalls also had a green tint to them. I will be returning them.
2.0,"I am 5'9"" and just over 200lbs. I tend to be somewhere between an XL and a XXL in sizing. I loved the look and fit of these on the model, but the largest size offered is XL. I gave them a shot and they fit as tightly as the cotton/spandex XXL tap pant and cami set I got from AvidLove, except the Avid Love set I got is supposed to fit a bit snug, it's designed for it, unlike these! I'm returning them."
2.0,It was beautiful but broke shortly after getting it 😕
2.0,"I expected the scarf to be blue and white, not cream. I can't wear cream. The fabric was great, soft and light, just what I would want in a scarf, very disappointed in the color. I returned it."
2.0,It is big and short
2.0,The sleeves are snug and too long. It is super soft! I got a large when I normally wear a medium/large and it’s a bit too small!
2.0,too big strap broke not quality
2.0,"Pretty cheap looking, but for the price ($3.50 withshipping), it'll do the trick."
2.0,Much smaller than advertised. I ordered an XL and there is no way an XL would fit the sizes is suggests it does. Other wise they were a nice quality and cute colors.
2.0,Pics very deceiving pendant VERY tiny.
2.0,"Runs two sizes too small, color is nice but material is thin."
2.0,They were smaller than I thought so I returned them
2.0,"With an elastic waist, this would be flattering. However, it is simply sewn and has no give, whatsoever. As a result, for me, a relatively smaller chested woman, at a slightly less-full 34D, or very full 34C, I found that the waist really compressed my bust, when I was pulling it on, over my head. Then, the bust was loose, really loose, and the waist was also too loose. In maternity-wear you find this kind of design, only with an elastic empire waist. That is what they need on this top, otherwise, you must buy one that is a little too large and then have it be uncomfortable to put on and take off. It simply isn't flattering, because the waist is so taught that it has no give at all. A standard T-shirt is more flattering, because it will stretch as you put it on and take it off and then conform to curves. This is like a tent with a very tight line pulled around the middle, that still isn't tight enough. I would pass."
2.0,"Item is larger than described, and poor quality. Returned it."
2.0,"I agree with Debit, This was one of the most disappointing purchases I have made. The clarity is poor, the bead is cloudy and it is hardly 3D, although the center of the bead is a raised piece.Hardly any depth to it. I have purchased other excellent beads from this seller, but this one is a dud!"
2.0,it fell apart right away
2.0,WAY to big for size 6-12 months.  These were size 12 which is a toddler size not an infant size.  Pretty disappointed.
2.0,"I had been searching for a pair of these; they’re  without the front seam and have pockets! Super comfortable. They’re true to size and color doesn’t fade after washing. I absolutely love these. However, I’ve only worn them once (washed twice on cold delicate), and the fabric has pilled in multiple places as if I have been wearing them for years??? They’re not going to last long if this is what happens when they’re washed. I really wish they were made with a fabric that actually holds up because they’re so hard to find."
2.0,"So disappointed with this item.  The material doesn't give and it's cut too small.  Also, there was a stain on the front of the item.  Had to return it."
2.0,"Great fit, love the pockets.  Turned my neck, hands, and the shirt I wore a dark blue after just a few minutes of wearing. Dye color not permanent."
2.0,They’re pretty but the gems are too big they make your shoe look cheap. The quality is horrible and they fall off easily. The butterfly’s and flowers are a good size but the gems just fall out with not even a full day of wear. Maybe spend your money elsewhere.
2.0,"The bib is way low and length is a little short. I’m 5’4 and 160lbs I got x-large for sawing logs and hauling, still to short."
2.0,"These glasses are light. They easily fit over my scripts comfortably. The lenses seem cheap, but the frames overall are ok, plastic wise. I have other “cheap” yellow glasses, where the lenses are simply clearer and better quality.. These lenses, again seem cheap and i question if they are even polarized. Travel will tell. I will update"
2.0,Was super thin and cheap. Possibly great for the beach. Ran very small.
2.0,"This would've been just &#34;okay&#34;, but there is way too much material between the thighs, so that part of the suit bunches up and is not &#34;flattering&#34;, to say the least."
2.0,"Not well constructed, the size fit with no problem, it was just not quality."
2.0,"i'm 5'5 and the skirt comes just to my ankles. i would expect it to be longer. the bust is a bit tight, i'm a 34B and it just felt constricting. i could see the fabric stretched out across my chest."
2.0,Did not care for material and sent it back.  Looked cheap
2.0,Más o menos esperaba un alicatado
2.0,Not as pictured. Material is different and it’s short. Like lower shin short. Not sending it back. I’ll wear it around the house like a moomoo.
2.0,"I purchased this product in March 2020. Now in September 2020, it is nearly worn out. Worn about once a week. There's significant pilling all over but especially in the back just below the waistband and between the legs. The fabric is wearing thin for me between the legs fastest including some small holes showing up. The leg elastic is comfortable and stays snuggly on my leg and the waistband is comfortable but does sometimes roll. The ballpark pouch is fine but not life changing. I even babied them by air drying instead of machine.<br /><br />For the price, this underwear is not worth it. It may be slightly more comfortable than a normal pair but not worth 8x the price. Especially when it doesn't last."
2.0,Not much leather
2.0,Size is bigger than usual nike sizes
2.0,Cheap Iron On
2.0,The scarf looks nice but it is not sewed in a loop like an infinity scarf which is what I wanted. I guess I will have to sew it together myself. Seems easier than going to the trouble of returning it. Disappointing that it wasn't accurate to the details of the item though.
2.0,Didn't clean as well as I thought it would.. its still in the jewelry box.  Oh well
2.0,"Within 4 months, I have had 3 of these bands break, 2 of them within a month. I do not feel as if I am doing anything to cause them to break, just daily activities. I will not purchase these again as I do not want to lose my fitbit by the band breaking and my device falling from my wrist."
2.0,Some what large it has a scrunched up waist band and u can’t adjust it I don’t know it just had a weird overall fit. I have a long one and I love wish I liked this one too
2.0,Beautiful but they 100% tarnish so don't buy if you intend to wear them all the time like I did. Now I need to buy replacements.
2.0,Purchased runs extra small
2.0,"The fit was fine, the seam in the middle was super itchy and scratches your nose and lips."
2.0,The shirt is cute but see through. Also wore it only 2X and the hem stitching is already coming undone.
2.0,Its smaller then the size said but its cute colors
2.0,Shirt I received looks nothing like photo. I expected a longer shirt but it's actually very shot. Shirt is cut like a box unlike shown in the pic. Very disappointed! Shipping was very slow for prime.
2.0,"I’m usually a Small or Medium, but ordered a large. It’s not as big as I would like. A bit disappointed"
2.0,Wasn't gold but yellow...
2.0,"Bought this for the bathroom. The design of the bottle which is very stylish and goes with any style. The smell is very earthy and therapeutic, but it fades away quickly. After a few days didn’t smell any more."
2.0,"This dress, while good quality for the price, just doesn't work for short women. There's about 2 feet of fabric that would need to be cut off (I'm 5 ft), and the waist is very high compared to the model in the pictures. Overall, I was really disappointed in this dress. I have to return it since it'll cost me too much to get hemmed."
2.0,"Two days after using it one of the loops that hold the belt tip in place came loose. It was stapled with a,  looks like paper staple from a paper stapler."
2.0,This is terrible. It looked like a giant ugly curtain on me. Returned.
2.0,The grr pants fit mush differently than the black ones A not the same type of loose material and feel like a size smaller ☹️
2.0,Yo estaba muy ilusionado con este regalo para mi esposa.. pero es demasiado delgado. En la foto de promoción no se ve tan delgado. Asumo que se rompe con facilidad. Decepción total.
2.0,"I love these shoes in terms of looks, comfort and price.  The dealbreaker for me is the incessant squeaking that happens within days of purchase.  There are numerous reports online, as well as videos on YouTube, that detail this issue.  Putting baby powder underneath the insole is supposed to mitigate the problem but getting the glued-down insole out of the shoe without tearing it is an adventure unto itself.<br /><br />I've gone through three pairs in 18 months and while the look and feel of the shoe was fine when I moved to a new pair the noise they generate is unbearable ... enough for strangers to comment on it while you're walking around."
2.0,The color is not what the photo describes. I wanted a darker blue.
2.0,"The hat is of the Grey family, on this picture it looks of the brown family which is what I needed for a tan coat.  May keep it anyway but very disappointing, had plans for wearing it Christmas eve."
2.0,"The photos of this sweater in the ad are SO cute. I had very high hopes. So, imagine my surprise when I get it and it fits like a potato sack. The sleeves were so baggy and long and the puffiness of the sleeve was not at all adorable like the ad shows. It definitely made me me fluffy and not in a cute way. I returned the item and am still on the hunt for the perfect causal sweater!"
2.0,Falling apart at seams
2.0,It is not easy to put on and the large runs extremely small
2.0,At first glance I noticed the shoes had a plastic look about them but I did liked the design of the shoes.  Unfortunately they were too big for me and so I had to returned them.
2.0,"Not a big fan of these sunglasses. Given the price point, this isn't surprising. They are very thick and chunky - especially the plastic part around your eyes. This makes them unattractive and uncomfortable. Really wanted to like them, but they will never be worn."
2.0,"This swim suit would look gorgeous on only a mannaquin or a very specific body-type. I bought this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review, and I'm about to break it down so buyers know what to expect with this product and can shop accordingly. IF you find my review helpful, please vote &quot;Yes&quot; below.<br /><br />Here goes. The big beef first: sizing is all over the place. Like I said, it'll fit somebody, but not everybody. It will work for you though if you have a large chest, long torso and a small butt. My wife, who this was for, has a smaller chest, a shorter torso, and a nice-sized booty. Which hangs out of this swim suit in a pleasant way for me but not for her. Unfortunately, the sizing chart that this product's amazon page provides doesn't adequately or accurately describe how this item will fit you. My wife ordered a US 2-4 (small) she is 5'3&quot; and weighs 113 lbs.<br /><br />Otherwise, the suit is very nice. The pattern is cool and the material is quality and quick-drying. Let me emphasize again that the butt is on the smaller side. Good luck!"
2.0,Looks deferent
2.0,"I gave it two stars because it does fit but it just isn't cute. The plaid is red but a orangey red, and bigger than pictured. I wouldn't recommend."
2.0,Too slippery. Slides off shoulders and rides up over breasts when reaching arms up.
2.0,"Like many others, I downgraded my rating because the lining has started to peel back. It also left black marks on my pillow (wish I would have read other reviews first!). I also noticed the elastic band seemed to be wearing out, as I had to adjust it to make it smaller several times. The shape and feel of the eye mask is great, just unfortunate that it is falling apart."
2.0,the finishing is not good and nothing like what is shown in the pic.
2.0,"Cute shirt but the fit is off.  The upper arm area is too tight!  I purchases a 3X, and I normally wear a size 18/20, so this should have fit!!!  But nope, I couldn't get my arms in the sleves"
2.0,"Looks similar to the photos. However, the hood is so big it covers my face and there is no drawstring as described. The strings that cinch the waist have no tabs (I don’t know what they are called) to hold the cinch in place so it just expands back to original size. Also, it doesn’t have any buttons as in the description (but not the photos) so there’s no option to partially close it so it has to be zipped. Overall, it’s not horrible but I probably would have returned it had I not decided to wear it on a rainy day."
2.0,"Purchased to replace a Fossil brand belt of tightly woven canvas. Similiar idea but this is stiff, thin and cheap in comparison. Will keep looking."
2.0,Even a 43 is too smsll for size k
2.0,"The top I got was high quality and fit well, however it did not come with the built in shelf bra. That was a big part of the reason I ordered these tanks. I am terrible at sending things back so I’m sure I’ll just keep this and be unhappy with it."
2.0,Not happy that the pictures shows multiple cats but the description says you get one RANDOM cat very misleading and NOT worth the price.
2.0,Bought these with 4 other girls for a wedding party event. 2 came with bent posts and mine had a one with a bent post and one completely broken off. The ones that weren’t broken were cute. But it seems risky if there’s a 2/5 success rate. A packaging change might help: they were just loose in a small plastic sleeve with card stock.
2.0,Basically an iron-on logo that looks kinda cheap
2.0,"it's a size larger, not very comfortable. cheap material"
2.0,"I was hoping for more, but given the price point, this is understandable. This fur hat looks okay, but feels thin and flimsy. This would provide modest warmth at best.<br /><br />My main critique is the size of the hat, which is way too large. I have a very normal size head, and the chin strap is nowhere near tight, which means the ear flaps blow around in the breeze. Even on the smallest of the two settings it is still too large. If you put it on the smallest setting, then the excess chin straps hang down and look awkward.<br /><br />I wouldn’t recommend this hat given the large size, thin material, and lack of warmth."
2.0,Length is okay but toes are snug and the shoe is too wide and loose around the ankle.  The metal makes an annoying jingling sound when you walk that can only be described as &#34;spur like&#34;.
2.0,"Gorgeous dress, and good quality fabric, but fits way to big. Had to return it. Inwish it would come in xs."
2.0,The seems are coming undone after light use.  I like the idea of packing cubes but there are better options out there.
2.0,Didnt get all pieces...no bracelet and cunfusing product
2.0,Looks good out of the package. Fits well just wearing it normally. Thought I was going to keep it. However this jogger cannot handle a squat day. The stitching came undone after my first heavy set.  It was the first day I wore it.
2.0,Very cool when it actually works but the lights kept going off randomly.  Didn't last through the night for Trick-or-treating.
2.0,I received the product and returned it immediately. I purchased a large & it looked like it was a small. Style and color was accurate but I did not bother trying it on as I knew it was not going to work.
2.0,"This had a great, flattering fit, but the fabric was horrible. Cheap and scratchy. It would be bearable if it didn't cover so much of your body."
2.0,"Unfortunately, they don't hold that well and slide downward after light use."
2.0,"So the blouse style is cute. The tulip cap sleeve is adorable. The dye lot is a more olive then Kelly green I was expecting. Pretty much everything that I order is a medium and fits perfect. However this blouse fits very small. There is no way that it's a medium, not to mention it's cut so short that it looks funny. I placed it next to another dress blouse so that you can see what I am taking about. It's a drag because it's cute but the sizing is way off."
2.0,"This ran pretty small, as least going by US sizes. I got a large and it was very, very tight, but then the back completely dragged the floor too so I'm not sure what to do about that.<br />Material was thick and scratchy. More like drapes material.<br />The top has a thick, wrinkled, gross feeling elastic band that goes across the entire garment from shoulder to shoulder. Despite the body and bust being tight, the elastic seemed too lose, and bunched up and looked horrible.<br />The good news is, it arrived quickly and the actual construction seemed good (sewing, seams)."
2.0,Love the watch but it arrived with a completely dead battery. Kinda bummed.
2.0,"I run the Detroit Int'l Marathon each year and thought these would be great head buffs to show both USA and CAN spirit. I was very disappointed to open the package and find that these weren't blue but black. There is no way to get it over my head as it is about 5"" and not stretchy at all - even considering that the fabric is polyester, which isn't good for running either as not absorbent. I suppose they will have to do as wrist bands, but as mentioned not absorbent at all. They are bit pricey for something so impractical in my opinion."
2.0,I notice no difference at all
2.0,CHINA ALWAYS HAS SMALLER SIZES THEN US SO IF YOU ARE A FATTY YOU BETTER MAKE SURE BEFORE HAND
2.0,Pretty crappy material. It started to fall apart the moment I got it. Very weird fit where it's huge in some places and tiny in others. Only gave two stars because it came decently fast and functioned as a temporary form of robe. Until it completely unraveled.
2.0,"I have to be honest,  cute but you cannot even see the roses - I had to look at an angle.  If subtle was what you were going for...you'd get it with this."
2.0,"Granted, you're not likely to find superbly tailored clothing on Amazon, but I was extra disappointed by this cute dress. I'll keep it as a swim cover, but the loose threads, gaping placket, weird cheap elastic loop buttonholes, and cheaply silky fabric isn't anything I'd wear in any other setting."
2.0,Did not realize I bought these twice. But both times they were too small on my teens and too small on my 9 year old.
2.0,"Cute. Wish it fit, but runs very very small"
2.0,"These should say just for show. They were huge, and had no sizing options. They weren't comfortable out of the box and only got worse as the padding went flat. Would not recommend for actual wear."
2.0,"Although the size and measurements were what I needed, It was much smaller than I expected...sleeves were very snug, and could barely pull i over my chest.  I guess the cut was a bit off.  I will use it for a gift as it is too small for me and the XL is only slightly bigger, so it will be snug as well.  Disappointed.  will not order from this merchant unless I drop 30  pounds, which is unlikely"
2.0,The Quality is not much good that show in the picture
2.0,"This dress is meant for people under 5'8"""
2.0,"The pendent in the front was clamped on backwards I ended up fixing it by gluing it down, which I think is what they intended to do the first time. Also one of the clasp was broken, which I also fixed, at least so I thought. It ended up coming in done and falling off at a festival. Was nice while it lasted?"
2.0,Ribbon wascheap ad falling apart ay ends
2.0,"Size was for a 3 y r old but the outfit was sized for a 7 y r old, not patient enough to wait :'("
2.0,Took a month to receive this product as it came from china. Took 2 ish weeks to get to the US then another 2 weeks to clear US customs. Product is fine but I regret not ordering from the bookstore directly
2.0,"I use my cards a lot for business and wanted an RFID wallet for security. I like the look and design on the outside, however the inside is cheaply made. The card holders are made of thin plastic and broke apart. After a while I just had a stack of cards with nothing separating them. If you are looking for a RFID wallet I would recommend finding a different one until the materials in this are upgraded."
2.0,"I am 5' 7&#34; and these are too short.  They pull hard on my shirt, rubbing my legs and showing creases where they clip on to the shirt.  If you are 5' 6&#34; or taller do not buy these."
2.0,Such nice fabric. Such small size.
2.0,The hat is cheaply made. I bought this for my mom and it took 3 weeks to come!! That's ridiculous because the bow on the hat nearly fell off. As I inspected the hat I could see the bow was put on with hot glue! Also when we got the hat it was all folded up and now it has these dents. Also it had a funny smell!! Would not recommend.
2.0,"In  a normal shoe he's a 1 but it a little tight, size 1.5 not available and size two I can almost fit . It's huge"
2.0,"These were cute for the first wear but after washing them once, it's almost like they just stretched out. I don't wear them out because they look too raggedy which is why l bought them but I guess not."
2.0,"i was so excited to get this dress for a friends wedding reception but ladies if you have large boobs like i do, do not waste your money! it is very see-thru and runs small i am normally a large and it didn't work for me :("
2.0,lost a stone after first time wearing
2.0,I bought a large & it felt like an EX. SMALL. but it was super cute & great support
2.0,"Dont like the way it lays, probably the shape of my head tho. It is a cute hat."
2.0,Tight and baggy in all the wrong places. Ended up going with a different costume it was so uncomfortable
2.0,"They look very nice, but they were very hard to wind and would not even do a full turn. After a few business trips, one would not wind anymore and the glass popped off."
2.0,"The pocket Velcro has already ripped off after a week. The size of the vests are snug, order a size up then your shirt size."
2.0,Too big compared to measurements and typical sizing. Gave it to my daughter who's a little bigger in waist and breast than me.
2.0,Hat is okay but logo is cheap looking application.
2.0,They fall in part on the first day.
2.0,The fabric is a rough scratchy linen type<br />Fabric.  It isn’t a soft flannel<br />type of fabric
2.0,"I am not down with this new polyester print they are doing all of these tye-dye's in. I've since started checking the material but I've even ordered some that say cotton, and when arrived, was polyester weird stuff. But if you like that material, it will be great."
2.0,"...but it's TINY. SO much tinier than it appears in the pictures. I thought this was the size of an average tote bag, but it's practically child-sized. The purse was supposed to include a separate handle so the purse could be worn on the shoulder or crossbody. I did not receive the handle with my order. I gave two stars because the quality of the purse is nice and it looks really cute. However it is definitely not what I expected. I am considering returning it but I'm not sure what I will do just yet."
2.0,"If all you need are the occasional rain pants to put on in case of an occasional downpour, then these might be for you.<br /><br />WHAT THESE ARE:<br />-Waterproof<br />-Very inexpensive<br /><br />WHAT THESE AREN'T:<br />-Durable<br />-Breathable<br />-Stylish<br />-Well Fitting<br />-Quiet<br /><br />My pants ripped at the crotch during the first week.  I was almost relieved since that gave it a modicum of breathability.  It's like wearing a paper bag with a plastic bag over it.  Still though, I'm sure it fits the needs of some."
2.0,I have ordered this bra before and have loved it. I am a little disappointed this time however because I ordered SKIN color and I received a black one.  I needed it for an event and wasn't able to use it.
2.0,The back is too sheer. The shape is not too flattering. And the S/M was a bit too large even for me.
2.0,The opening for the big toe is too small and cuts off the circulation.  The other opening is good but the entire sock is a bit too short and so it cuts off circulation.  I will be returning it.
2.0,While the dress is adorable I went 2 sizes up due to reviews and still too small  returned item
2.0,"Not very heavy, kinda lopsided. With shims it works fine."
2.0,These shoes are adorable but were too small
2.0,I liked the photo of this sweater which looked .more wearable in the pic. It was not a knit that was soft or tightly knit giving it a coarse look.. Takes over ypur body like a big blanket. Not for me.
2.0,"Not great quality, but what can you expect for the price. Meant for skinny girls."
2.0,Order up! They should not be this small in a large!
2.0,Way too big- I ordered at 12.5 for my 5 year old.  They were more like a size 3 (fit my 8 year old)
2.0,"Too short, didnt go pass my ankles"
2.0,Super cute and good quality but don't have all my matches.
2.0,"Poor quality, unfinished seams, cheap zippers and a weird shade of pink.<br />Might be a good idea to spend a bit more and buy something nicer."
2.0,"This was not made for a woman with muscular thighs and rear. I also didn't dig the big side slits, made it not appropriate for work."
2.0,They ripped!
2.0,Not great quality and the monkey keychain fell apart almost immediately.  Its also very difficult to keep clean.
2.0,I loved it until i lost it. It lasted just for a month. The latch that clasps it with the shoe is so poor that i lost it without even realizing that it fell off somewhere. Disappointed and what a waste
2.0,It does a hole is sheep
2.0,The inside started to come apart not long after we got it. My daughter only wore it a few times before it tore up on the inside.
2.0,I like the material but one sleeve for the wrist was perfect but the other was loose and stretched out so it didnt fit my wrist and the red in the letters are not precisely placed to fill to the outline
2.0,This shirt is really weirdly wide and short. Did not like the fit at all.
2.0,Ripped at waistline after one wear during church 🤦‍♀️
2.0,"I got the pink dress and it's more coral, and in direct sunlight you can see through it. It fit a little snug around the arms/chest and I even went by the sizing guide."
2.0,The stitching color is way off and makes the hat look like a knock off copy. And the front is lopsided and doesn’t sit right on the head.
2.0,"The hat is exactly as described and is excellent when out in the sun.  However, the hat looks like the person using the sewing machine lost control. it is very poorly stitched and finished along the outer rim in front of hat. I should have sent it back for exchange. It arrived in the midst of days of triple digit heat and sun and I needed it, so I kept it. But it is a large flaw and the hat should have been inspected and never sent."
2.0,"Buy a size over, they are very narrow. I should have read the reviews first. Will use for rest of season but will not buy from brand again."
2.0,"Shirt looks good, but smelled REALLY bad!! Like awful, stale B-O. It is more of a Junior fit, so a small Juniors fit. We had gotten 4 other shirts off of Amazon for our Disney trip, this was the only. One with the bad smell."
2.0,I bought the dress last year. The dress was made too small. Still sitting in my closet. Unable to where it.
2.0,Easy got scratches but good looking glasses.
2.0,"Material is nice but the sizing is off. Top fit, bottom is too small. I plan to just give it to my granddaughter."
2.0,"This is a really cute dress, and only has one flaw.  The neckline is a raw edge, not sewn.  It’s the entire neckline, so it stands out quite a bit.  The rest of the dress is cute and fits well, but this is a problem"
2.0,Way to small. Kind of weird opening. It is a lot smaller in the inside. Had to return the purse.
2.0,"Nice material and workmanship, but I usually order 2XL from sellers and the fit is fine. This is at least two sizes smaller than that. Returning."
2.0,Look good at first . Got it for my girlfriend for a wedding. But when it arrived noticed the ribbon that it was glued to was uneven and the flower was not glued to the center of the ribbon. And the glue isn’t hidden very well . It’s very noticeable.
2.0,"Ordered for wife. She wasn't to impressed, kinda poor quality and not as flexible as she thought it would be."
2.0,I washed it and the dress shrunk but the slip didn’t. Now the slip is 2 inches longer than the dress.
2.0,I never got this belt. Instead I received one with a chrome buckle. Which would look hideous with the dress I bought it for. And Amazon wasn't able to correct their mistake. And there was nothing else I wanted. So I just had to return it. Bummer.
2.0,quality not well
2.0,"Cheap quality. I love the dress but I can only wear it a couple of times before something falls apart. I bought a grey one and a blue one. I only washed the grey dress once before it got a hole in it. I didn't even get to wear it. By the way, you have to wash it before you wear it because they all smell terrible when you get them. For the price, it should be better quality."
2.0,"Looks poorly made, very cheap. Sequins are spaced very far apart and it's not an off the shoulder shirt. It's also very short."
2.0,"I order this hat twice already expecting that the second time I order it wouldn't come like the first (badly structure ) I think I've order over 8 hats and it's like a gamble some come well done others come horribly made , really like the other hat the I ordered that it didn't come BAD CONSTRUCTED , I don't think Im going to order from here anymore I'm good now."
2.0,"I got the smallest size for my 48lbs 4ft 1in 8 year old, but he fell one time on the basketball court and got a hole in the knee."
2.0,Arrived damaged/bent.
2.0,"At first they were comfortable and provided great arch support, but that was around the house. First day wearing them I found the strap is rubbing my toe raw. Also there is a lot of imperfections on the sole little pokey pieces on the sole cushion. After wearing for an hour it is very uncomfortable."
2.0,"I love the styling of this necklace, but the cheap metal tarnished quickly. I still wear it, but it's definitely discolored upon closer inspection."
2.0,Quality is good but runs VERY small...the company gave us a half return credit to keep it and reorder but the second one in a larger size is a little small as well.
2.0,They're a versatile house/yard shoes but the fur went hard after 2 weeks.
2.0,"Crazy small for an XL. Sleeves short, bodice length short. fit more like a M...but because its super stretchy...a person could get it on, but it doesn't look right. Too thin, tight and small for its size."
2.0,"Disappointing ... I really wanted to love this bracelet and while the silver and leather are nice, the pearls look cheap/gaudy in person."
2.0,"Compared to some other brands, like Nike DriFit running, these shirts do not breathe well and retain heat considerably more. The fabric is also heavier and feels like it hangs too loose, not to say that other brands are form fitting, but this one is much less so.  Would not run in this."
2.0,Very loose and flimsy. Cute style but seems like they will snap easily.
2.0,The mask was stiff and to tight for my face you must have a super narrow face to fit It
2.0,This was short - I bought it for my boys ages 8 & 9<br />For return to face to face- both are ADHD and one is Autistic I had trouble getting it over their head and they came back broken
2.0,I’m giving it only two stars because it came packaged but the bottom of the hem on the dress was dirty
2.0,"First order was great, like how the fit so order more, the second time I notice some small defects on the material , maybe just a bad batch I’ll try again"
2.0,The cut was off and this was WAY too large for my 5 year old.
2.0,"The necklace broke within the first 24 hours. Both pieces are really cute, but are just too delicate."
2.0,Priced too high for the quality of this shirt...should be more like $12.00
2.0,A lot shorter then expected.
2.0,"Had high hopes for these, my wife wore them for almost a month before one cracked"
2.0,Not as pictured. The stitching is a dark orange color.
2.0,"The title said 8. But I only received 4, that is half an order they don't send, while quality was excellent you don't receive what is advertised."
2.0,"For the price, material wasn’t to bad but the cut was not good. I order the extra large as it was suppose to be at 16/18, and that was not even close to the right size. Way to small. I’m normally a 14."
2.0,"The nursing bra doe run small, so do go up 1 size up. The material is very thin. The top do roll-up. After a few washes, the bra is falling apart; the thread from the band is coming off. I treat the bra in the washer under dedicate cycle or hand wash and hand-dry. (I've only had it for  1 month and maybe wore it a few times)"
2.0,These sunglasses are flimsy.
2.0,These fit my 5 year old son like he was a 90's rapper. lol SO BAGGY. The quality is nice though. Colors are as displayed.
2.0,I was not happy with this at all. I expected sweater material and it was more like a T-shirt.
2.0,"It seems to be great quality. The front seems very large from like top to bottom. I'm a 36/38b. I purchased an XL. as I was putting it on I knew it would get stuck around the shoulders so I didn't even put it on fully. If I would have put it on all the way and try to take it off, I knew I would have dislocated a shoulder."
2.0,Fabric is not meant for winter and its too tight and not long enough
2.0,"Not pleased at all. The picture looked elegant but the actual looked more like a horizontal curtain.  I was meaning to return it but I'm running out of time bec our event was few days away. The stitches that separated the torso and the lower body is not even aligned! The right half is higher than the left!. I thought ill be spending more for the alteration than the actual price of it. I stitched the drape to hold it in place, just below my navel...you know, 'gotta make it work. Too bad I forgot to take a photo before I did. I'll  upload a photo later. I'm not going to wear it after. I'm very dissatisfied."
2.0,"Product isn’t as it seems in photo . Poor material , too big"
2.0,"When this was advertised it said it was a Michael Kors purse. It is nice, but not logoed. How can I give this as a named brand?. It's ok, but not as advertised."
2.0,The sleeve was way to tight
2.0,Don’t buy this if you don’t have the adapters for the strap it doesn’t come with them at all
2.0,The dress is beautiful but... I ordered a 2x because I wear a 1x however the dress was so small I have it to my younger cousin that wears a size M. Fits her perfectly.
2.0,"You get what you pay for.  The sun glasses clips were crooked but functional enough to work.  I don't expect them to last long, but long enough to justify their cheap price.  At least I hope so."
2.0,"I was looking for orange stone earrings and found these.  However, when they arrived they were yellow rather than orange, not at all what I was expecting.  The earrings themselves are nice, but not what I wanted.  Had no problem returning them and got a full refund."
2.0,"If you've had Olukai's before, these will leave you disappointed.  They aren't as comfortable as the three other pairs I've owned over the years.  It's not because these are chukka's but I think it's because these don't have the usual leather sole with the projected rubber pads.  These soles are manmade (plastic of some kind) with the same rubber pads.  Perhaps, the rigid plastic just doesn't flex and give like the leather did.<br /><br />They are a nice looking shoe, Not worth the Olukai money since it's not the same shoe.<br /><br />I really hope Olukai doesn't start using this sole design on their other shoes..."
2.0,Good beach dress
2.0,Returned . Hard to open the clasp and it made my ear hurt.<br />It’s pretty but maybe not for your tragus . It didn’t work out for me
2.0,Material can be softer. Felt quite uncomfortable.
2.0,"Something about these ties that just make them not go with anything. They are also to thin and to short, can't recommend."
2.0,"I really cannot comment on comfort, width, and support since it did not fit me personally. I have low instep and the straps are not design to fit my type of feet."
2.0,"The bracelet was supposed to be blue, it wasn't, it was green.  Very disappointed!!"
2.0,I was surprised at how large these glasses are. They are huge and not complimentary in any way. I've reviewed many sunglasses previously and these are cheap looking and feeling.  You get what you pay for and these are not worth even $12.99 in my opinion.  Much better options out there.
2.0,I originally bought this for my girlfriend in a size medium based on the sizing table.  The sizing was too small and had to return it for a large. Recommend ordering a size larger since sizing is not made for smaller sized people.
2.0,The glasses are very stylish but flimsy.  The lens popped out as we were just riding in the car - not even doing anything strenuous
2.0,"Does not resemble the picture. It is gaudy--and has gold ,thick,  coiled threads  embellishing the scarf, which is not visible in the picture. Ugly."
2.0,Guess i'm not skinny enough for these SLIM fitting shirts :0(
2.0,"I ordered the small keychain as a gift and what was delivered was not what was indicated. All I received was the wooden piece. There was no ""HIGH TENSILE STRENGTH TWIST CABLE LOCK KEY RING FOR ULTRA DURABILITY"" and no ""HANDSOME PACKAGING THAT IS GREAT FOR GIFT GIVING."" It was a piece of wood in a clear plastic bag with a barcode label on it."
2.0,After first wash it made the white cord turn light grey so it obviously bleeds black into other pieces during the wash. The main reason I was attracted to this hoodie was the fact that it has that white wide string. Now the string / cord just looks old and dirty. Gave it two stars because I like the hoodie itself but the cord may have to be removed so what’s the point? Returning. Never even used it once.<br />I like to wash my new clothes prior to wearing  them.
2.0,"one of the dangles fell of during first use and was lost, request forreplacement ignored"
2.0,The shorts are great except there are no pockets which I specifically picked this option because of the pockets
2.0,The Sunglasses frame is too small for my face. They do not compare to the real Prada ones!!
2.0,"Flimsy...the first one broke after 2 days. I've been very careful with the others, but not as durable as I'd hoped."
2.0,Smaller than I thought it be. I bought it for my husband had to give it to my eight year old. Better for girl or small child.
2.0,Not enough material to actually keep warm.<br />Too thin
2.0,"they look like a pair of very old socks,all the wool looks like dust bunnies"
2.0,Super cute top but after wearing it twice it tore along the lining.
2.0,"Upset with purchase, thinking of returning."
2.0,Shiny material and way too tight!
2.0,Bought this watch band 2 months ago and it’s faded. Some parts so bad you can hardly see the design anymore. Don’t recommend. Cheaply made.
2.0,Looked frumpy and didn't hang well.
2.0,"I like the jacket, especially being a bigger guy hard to find rain shell that has pit zips.  But from day one the pockets constantly get stuck and have a cheap inner mesh which keys constantly get stuck in.  Just a month into having jacket the left pocket pull came totally off and both zipperss were getting stuck whenever you go to open or close.  Now left pocket is totally broken.  I expected more from this brand to be honest."
2.0,Expected better arch support/more comfort. Disappointed. Returned.
2.0,HOFAM does not want you to leave a negative review but I must. The inside of the socks had all kinds of loose threads. I sent them back.
2.0,"Sizing is way off.  I ordered could sizes bigger, but was still way way too small."
2.0,"Buckle and other hardware are cheap-looking, and don't at all match the gold Apple Watch"
2.0,I've ordered a women's large in other sleeves - but this one was gigantic around the bicep - really looked more like a mens XL.  I'm going to have to make the top of it smaller to keep it from sliding down my arm - and I have well developed biceps - not skinny arms.  I do love the pattern - too bad about the sizing.
2.0,Not large at all. Nor did it look like the picture.
2.0,I’m 5’3 and 140lb i wore medium and fits great. Very stretchy and lightweight. However for the price they are better quality paper bag shorts on Amazon. There’s no pockets and there just one small thin layer. ALSO there’s no back loop so the bow doesn’t stay out on back when sitting it rises up.<br /><br />I wore them with a white body suit and it stained my white bodysuit just from wearing it. Poor quality
2.0,"I was really disappointed with these earrings.  I like the color (silver) and size of these hoop earrings, but it was literally impossible for me to close the clasp on them once they are in the ear!  Before I ordered them I watched the seller's video on how to operate the clasp.  It's a bit unconventional, but it seemed fairly reasonable.  Then, when they arrived I opened and closed the clasp a couple times to get used to it.  (It wasn't as easy as they showed in their video, but I was able to manage it.)  The problem came after I put it through my earlobe and had to close it.  It is too difficult to do when you can't see it!  I tried multiple times, but I was never successful.  It's frustrating and disappointing because I liked them otherwise.  But earrings that you can't wear aren't useful at all.  I recommend the seller create a different clasp for it."
2.0,"For the love of all things holy, don’t buy these. They are an absolute pain to assemble.<br /><br />They arrive flat. You have to roll them, insert tab things into the flap, and it awful.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and find some that are already assembled."
2.0,I'm a size 9 but I should have ordered an 8.5 instead. They're BIG
2.0,"The chain was hoaky too weak for any pendant, the color of the stone is so washed out. On eBay I'd of checked all the reviews but because this is Amazon I expected more."
2.0,The clasp is extremely hard to open and close. Not good.
2.0,"It’s stretchy and comfortable but the pads in the middle shift a lot and it ripped as I was pulling the bra up, so it’s cheap fabric. I was so excited but pretty disappointed!"
2.0,VERY tiny writing. nice sentimental piece. The chain is long but just a flimsy metal latch-key kid kind of metal
2.0,"This is really pretty and looks great on, but I'm giving it two stars because the chain and clasp broke while trying to put it on."
2.0,"The product did not work, poor quality"
2.0,The fit on this is just huge. My husband has a big pumpkin head and this thing sits so low he can not see properly. The inside fur is super soft and the material seems durable. We are sending this back as it is unwearable unless he puts a towel in the top of the hat.
2.0,I had been so excited about these until they arrived.  This large felt like an extra small.  What a disappointment!  Ms. Tee
2.0,These worked ok but I just really didn't care for them.
2.0,"These are already becoming loose and I have only wore them 3 times, I have to go buy a repair kit to be able to tighten them up, if that will even work"
2.0,"Very pretty silicone ring. I enjoyed it very much, for the 2 days I got to wear it. As others have noted, the rhinestones came loose. To me, it appears to be a design flaw. The silicone stretches, but whatever is binding the rhinestones obviously has little to no tolerance to that stretch. Ultimately, the sparkle and stretch parted company fairly quickly.  I’ll continue looking for a pretty silicone ring, and even check back on this one for design improvements because the look is exactly what I desire."
2.0,This shirt is more like a dress. It did not look like the picture
2.0,"Not even a year old, only used seasonally and the snap broke off the back. Very disappointing."
2.0,"The rings arrived as a gift from my bf, but only the heart and the leaf one were midi ring-sized, the other two were simple gold bands. And upon wearing one of these simple gold bands, it turned COPPER...so yeah I think the fact that it changed color on my first time wearing it says a LOT about its quality. I'll still wear them all, cuz I don't mind the color, but you get what you pay for, I guess"
2.0,"Nooooo! Not flattering at all! Gave it away. Could just be my body type - I’m big busted, 5’9”, 180 pounds - but I did not like it at all."
2.0,These were way too small!!!!
2.0,The shirt wouldn't stay pinned shut and the pants were too small.
2.0,Thought it would be greener
2.0,Very disappointed. I am 5'2' and the length barely came to my waist. Back it goes. Picture is extremely deceiving.
2.0,"The charms are as picture BUT I only received 45 charms. It wouldn't have been a big deal if I were missing 1 or 2, but that's 10 short of the advertised amount."
2.0,"Ordered a 3X, it is the perfect size for my daughter that wears a ladies small/medium."
2.0,The skirt itself was what expected but the sizes run far too small. I will most likely not order from this company again.
2.0,Way  Overpriced for the very shin and just gross material that is received it's just not in good condition it wasn't what I expected it I really didn't like it was cheap
2.0,"My fault for not reading the reviews<br />-<br />2 starts for being cute but I'm extremely disappointed. Nothing about these are &#34;knee pads.&#34; They're no different than wearing pants... actually, her pants are more padded. These are nothing more than eye catching sock like leg and knee wamers."
2.0,So this bag seems really awesome. BUT unless your shoes on the bottom are gigantic and take up the whole compartment when you put clothes in this it will never stand up on its own. It’s so incredibly frustrating! I can never just set it down on the bench at the gym. Sturdy wise it seems pretty good.
2.0,I liked the boot but it came ripped so I returned it.
2.0,"I ordered 2 of these, one in an XXL which was too big and one in a XL which turned out to be too small. Im a size 16. The XXL is way too big, super cute but doesn't fit anywhere.<br />The XL I couldn't even get it over my head with out the seams ripping. Once on (after more seam ripping) the bikini top portion fits ok but is not snug enough around my torso and yet to snug on the straps. Im confused by this suit. I really really like it and wanted it to fit but it just doesn't fit right. Im going to have to alter the larger one and make it a custom fit. Thats what I get for ordering from China I guess.<br />The bottoms I wasn't really concerned with because I planned on getting some cute black shorts to wear over it.<br />It took about a month to arrive and has a funky chemically smell.<br />Im really disappointed in this suit. If I can't get it over my head without seams ripping then theres something wrong. I don't have a huge fat head. I have a regular head.<br />Ive learned my lesson and will not be purchasing this item again. 2 times was enough for me. I wish it would have been made with quality materials but Im sad to report its just not.<br />I received this item at a discount for my honest unbiased review."
2.0,It's a beautiful watch but lost time after a few days of wear. I only wore it at school and took it off as soon as I got home. Am returning.
2.0,I was so excited to find this in my size that it was a total let down when i got it. I couldn't even get my head in : (
2.0,"I bought this amongst others, because i thought the price would reflect the quality. Yes it works and all, but appears to be cheaply made. Not worth $15, my advice is to find a cheaper one that will be the quality of the value. Not satisfied."
2.0,On the cheaper side looking. Way too big for a small.
2.0,Kind of tight in the sleeves.
2.0,"I checked and double checked the sizing chart against clothes I currently wear and my measurements, yet when the pants came in I couldn't get them past my calf. Also there was no stretch or give to the material, unlike what the description says, it was very stiff. I'm hoping I got a mislabeled pair, the sizing difference was terrible."
2.0,does not work on  smart phone
2.0,I didn't like it. Returned.
2.0,It's a good watch for the money has kelp perfect time can't beat it
2.0,Extraordinarily cheaply made. Fit is weird and even if it did fit I would not wear it as it’s very itchy polyester. I’m not very picky with clothes but this dress is not worth $1.
2.0,It was cute at first but broke within a day. They did respond fast and sent another one immediately when I asked for a replacement. Only reason im not giving 1 star
2.0,"Glasses looked fine, sizing was good, even came with ""extras"" (little screwdriver, case, cleaning cloth), but they smelled awful as soon as I opened the package - very strong burnt plastic-type smell.  I had to put them in the garage and will be returning."
2.0,"Cheap material... Broke with a week.... No shipping info was given, so I had to check the mail daily hoping to finally get it for a few weeks.... Not made for men's size wrist... For woman or young adults ok"
2.0,These run small around the waist and they are not tagless. The tag rubbed my husband's back so much he had to tuck his shirt into his under ware.  Loved that they were all grey. But disappointed we now have 11 pair that he can't ware.
2.0,"This is our second pair of these, but they didn't work any longer then the first, which is about a week."
2.0,"My 3 year old loved it, very cute, but flimsy plastic frame broke after 3 days so I'm left with an empty pouch."
2.0,Looks nice in pictures but not very nice upon arrival. Flowers look pixelated a
2.0,"I don't like these.  They're pretty cheaply made, I don't think they'll hold up long.  I really don't like the fit or the shape they give your chest.  Too pointy!  They have a very small, thin back strap so it doesn't provide any support holding them up if you have a big chest.  Overall really disappointed. I don't recommend trying these."
2.0,"The costume was sold as an adult costume and did not offer sizes. When I received it it was much too short and small for me and I am 5 Ft 11, average adult size. The package said size large implying it was Not one size fits all and there were options but not when ordering so beware that a large was much too short and small for 5’11 adult"
2.0,The shirt is fit nice but everything else was too small
2.0,My son loves these but he only wore them once and all the strings are coming out and they are falling apart. That's a bummer because they were expensive!
2.0,the way it sinches is actually very unflattering. Makes my stomach look like a bubble and I really don't have much extra weight even. The pads in the bra part are very small and weirdly hard. They are not comfortable. I dont know how anyone with larger boobs makes this top work because mine aren't even that big and it barely contains them. If you are a B cup or smaller you'd probably fit.
2.0,Print is nice but there is no pocket for the filter
2.0,Think I ordered a 4x  it was very snug
2.0,Arrived missing one ring + it runs small.
2.0,Great concept but I couldn't work with it.
2.0,"The hat doesn't come in sizes, and it is not adjustable.  The shipping  (nearly $9) is ridiculous, and it takes forever.  It must come from out of country, but I couldn't find the origin.  Don't blow your money."
2.0,Way too small and I ordered 2 sizes larger.  Gave to neighbor
2.0,Barely fit an average wrist. Not true to size
2.0,"Actually fit pretty well. But the fabric was SUPER cheap, like the fabric they used to make kids pajamas out of in the 80s and 90s before there were rules about being them needing to be fire retardant."
2.0,"Did not like the color , looked cheap."
2.0,At this price point ($20) the quality isn't great. This is more of a $10 necklace. The coloring is very matte looking and when you open it up it feels like it might fall apart. Cute idea but poor execution.
2.0,"I wanted to love this, but it looked fairly &#34;cheap&#34; when it arrived; and that's justified as it IS cheap!  :)  I buy cheap things all the time, but this one definitely had a look I wasn't going for.  I have a normal sized wrist and the watch face also kept swiveling to the inside of my wrist."
2.0,Too short and super flimay
2.0,Great style just way too big for my head going to try something else a different color of this style hat.
2.0,"Not stainless steel, turned green and my ear green within 2 weeks."
2.0,would not stay on the watch kept popping off
2.0,"They are pretty and nice prints, but the aren’t wide enough. They barely cover the nose to chin area, and slip of the nose when you talk. Rather disappointing."
2.0,The fit doesn't work for me.  I expect it to be a little more fitted
2.0,It seemed like a lightweight quality shoe with ties. But the first time my daughter kicked them off the insoles came out of both shoes.  They continued to come out every time we took them off her so I stopped putting her in them.  It was too much hassle for what it was - I would not recommend unless you have the time to put those back in every time the shoes come off.<br />They were a little big - but I ordered her a size too large.<br />But they were cute.
2.0,It’s no better than a mask.<br />I wanted to try it because of the claimed cooling effect. I did not experience that at all and it was just as hot as a normal mask for me.
2.0,Just for leisure or if you are stretching or walking. These roll down at the waist. After the first wash is when I notice the change and realized these are better for just casual wear. The butt looks bigger with these on lol
2.0,These are cute leggings but the fit is really strange. There's a lot of bagginess around the crotch area and the length on the top part is a little weird. They're generally just very baggy and loose on me. I'm about 100lbs and 5'5&#34; and the smallest size was very unflattering on me.
2.0,"I’m someone who loves large jewelry. However, these are comically large and therefore unwearable. I have included a picture for size comparison of a large pendant I own against these to show how huge they are. Besides the size, the pieces came packaged well and look to be made of good quality."
2.0,If you are going for oversized this shirt would deliver.
2.0,"This top was incredibly small.  I had more of my chest hanging out than being covered.  The angles of the sides also cut in much more dramatically than the picture.  I'm not sure what body type would fit this, but it was just poorly fitted and looking."
2.0,"Honestly, it looks like something a Mennonite or Amish girl would wear."
2.0,The snap seperated from the ribbon/fabric it was attached to.  Didn’t hold up as expected.  Would skip on this one.
2.0,Doesn't look exactly like pics
2.0,The drawing on the handbag was improperly did very disappointed after all I paid almost 50 bucks for this😟
2.0,"They're super cute on, but the seam in the crotch came undone the first time I wore them, which made me sad. :("
2.0,"First of all these are MENS, they came with packaging that says &#34;man&#34; on it so they're a bit big, and go ABOVE YOUR ANKLES"
2.0,Was way too big so it was hard to tell but it felt heavy and bulky
2.0,This is a weird thick stiff material. There is zero flexibility in the waist which is meant to sit very high. Not flattering. Blue color is as pretty as pictured but that's about it.
2.0,The bottoms fit perfectly but the top wasn't made for women with a big chest.
2.0,top is extremely large and loose compared to the rest of the dress
2.0,The watch face is exactly as described but the watch band is awful. It feels like very cheap material and will not stay in strap retainers. Would recommend going with a different watch for the money.
2.0,"I bought this costume for my 3 yr old son he loved it. The color was good but the figure was not symmetrical and the quality wasn’t that much well... Fingers are too narrow!!! In the end my son loves it, that’s all it matters!"
2.0,I ordered according to the size chart however the shirt was considerably smaller than expected.
2.0,"The quality of the material is nothing like I expected. It is very thing, see through, and poorly made. Also, size runs very small. Couldn't even lift my arms in it and a medium is normally a bit roomy on me. I was disappointed because it's really cute."
2.0,All broke on me
2.0,"Weird, huge collar"
2.0,Style not as tall as expected
2.0,Fits well...unfortunately the color wasn't the same. I ordered a gray one and the one that came is a grayish purple...
2.0,Cute but tarnished quickly. And falls apart.
2.0,Compression is good but material wears out. I had holes in my toes and soles after one washing
2.0,It’s definitely too small so order an extra or two extra sizes up. Does not fit as expected. On the bright side it truly is a nice blouse you just need to go up a size or two.
2.0,I loved the pictures but unfortunately it's not as nice in person. The pattern does not stand out as much even in daylight and the material is fabric and arrived wrinkled. I would maybe pay 1/2 the price but not $60. Spent a few days deciding on a new winter purse but back it goes.
2.0,"I like the design of this shirt but it is executed poorly.  It looks cute but each section is a different piece of material so you can feel the lines where it is sewn together.  It fits as expected, except for the sleeves are very short.  The material is a polyester type so its not a cozy sweatshirt/t-shirt.  I had to give it 2 stars because it came with a huge hole on the side!!!"
2.0,"Material was thin and size was a bit small. I’m 5’8” and 160 pounds. I usually wear a large bottom, but that was too small. It also fit kind of weird and wasn’t flattering."
2.0,"I purchased this wallet specifically because the pattern/fabric matched the inside of a Vera Bradley handbag which I had purchased last year.  I've had the wallet now for about two months and am finally coming to the realization that I am not satisfied with the design.  Unfortunately, the slits/pockets that are in the flap specifically for holding credit and other cards are so tight, that I am only able to use one side of the flap and have to leave the other side empty because it is almost impossible to remove your cards once they are all loaded.  I had hoped maybe they would loosen up over time, but that has not happened.  I hate to return things, but it really bothers me to use it in such limited capacity."
2.0,"I rarely complains about anything but really was disappointed in not the quality so much, which was poor but the length in arrival. Truthfully even in Covid. It felt for the price point it should have arrived sooner."
2.0,Skirt is really big on this
2.0,"At first glance after receiving them I thought they were great and fit perfectly (size 10.5shoe), but after washing and drying them, they shrunk so much they are slightly small on me now. Not only that, after only wearing (and washing) them a handful of times - maybe 5 or 10 - they are starting to disintegrate. This product is of sub-par quality, so don't expect them to last long. You get what you pay for, and these are cheap for toe socks."
2.0,"Harder than the hubs of Hell to load 12ga shells on, after 1 use the shells loaded easier because the elastic material stretched now I was constantly picking up live ammo that fell out of the belts,"
2.0,"Beautiful hoop earrings! I love the CZ sparkles, however the posts turned my ears black. I pierced my ears 45 years ago and have never had this problem before!<br /><br />I wish I could give them a 5 star for beauty, but not when there's a problem turning my skin black."
2.0,"Ordered 2 shirts of the exact same size. The pink one was way too small...the white one fit perfectly. I'm updating to 2 stars because the material is good quality and the cuff links were gorgeous. Unfortunately, the shirt is unusable because of the size."
2.0,"Cheap. Cheaply made, poor quality. Don't bother. Buy something like this in person."
2.0,"This watch looks good and feels good. I may send it back, however.. going to give it another week of trial.<br /><br />Since I received this watch a couple weeks ago, I have been wearing it daily, only taking it off while I sleep. Three times now I have found that the time is wildly off.. and I haven't been able to figure out if it's just lost all winding over night or if it's just losing time over the days-- hours, not seconds. Today I wound it up again, although when I put it on, it is still ticking along. I keep forgetting to check to see if it's at a dead stop before I pick it up and put it on.<br /><br />Either way, it is either not keeping time or is not working as a true automatic watch, given that it is only at rest for about 7 hours a day. That is plenty of wear and activity that an automatic watch should be self winding."
2.0,"I was really excited to get these pants. The material isn't quite what I expected. It is more of a soft cotton and it feels almost like a suede material. The pants are pretty cheaply made. There was a hole in two of the seams. The pants are cute but with holes in the seams, they are not very wearable."
2.0,Uncomfortable to wear. I need it to sleep in to help my broken nose not bend at night.
2.0,Sizes ran too small. Not for people with thick calves.
2.0,"Beautiful material but I am confused as to why the belt is so so low, it does not tie around the waist as advertised. The loops that hold up the belt are exactly on top of the pocket, I have to take the belt out of the loops in order for me to tie it around the waist otherwise it ties underneath my bottom. I am 5'5 and weight 120, I am considered average height so that should not be happening. If you can resow the loops correctly it is great but if you cant it will cause a problem."
2.0,Two tight at exact size. Do larger size. I am 8.5wide in size will move to 9. I intend on returning if allowable.
2.0,Loved the pattern but they were too big and heavy for what I was looking for.
2.0,I returned this. Runs 1 or 2 sizes smaller than expected. Super cute though! Color matched the picture exactly.
2.0,"It's cute, but really cheap. The handle broke off almost immediately. It's not so big - but also an awkward shape so it doesn't fit well on a stroller."
2.0,"After reading reviews I decided to order a size bigger than I normally wear (which is still the same size in all my other maternity clothing). Once the dress was received, I loved the color - a beautiful bright red, but the size was still too small. I'm going to have to return and order (if I want it) another size or 2 up. Basically size up! At least twice!"
2.0,I felt it was too snug and would put pressure on my Rx glasses.  I returned the case.
2.0,Was disappointed that one side of the scarf is white instead of the floral design.  Hard to use since it’s an infinity scarf
2.0,"I normally wear a 34DD in all my bras to include sports bras. I could not even get this bra on. The shape of the bra is much too small. I have not ever had issues with sports bras ill fitting, but I am not sure who this bra was designed for. You have to be a child to wear these bras. I would not recommend this bra to anyone unless you have a very small frame."
2.0,The gloves do not keep me warm. The cold somehow gets into it and I still feel cold though have gloves. This was just a waste of my money. The only thing I like is the touch screen compatible.
2.0,My daughter loves them but she doesn't want to take the time to send back to get fixed.
2.0,"Possibly got returned item. No brand tags attached, fabric tag only said ""28"".<br />It was Short in the body. Not a shirt to wear with leggings if you ever plan to raise your arms!<br />Sleeve length was ridiculously long ( like a work out shirt).  I could close my hands on the end of the sleeve and hold it since it almost went to my fingertips.  Odd for a lightweight V neck Tshirt.<br />Color was beautiful.  Fabric was soft but tshirt weight. Maybe good for the Southern winters? It would probably shrink to a square.<br />Sadly will return due to cut of body length."
2.0,"I tried to listen to everyone on how it runs small, but it's seriously so small, if you have boobs, don't get it. I'm a 36 D and it I definitely should have ordered a larger size, but I still don't think it would look right with bigger boobs. This is meant for someone with an A or a B cup"
2.0,"Wanted to love them. The material is very thin and the knee cuts are more like slits and not very stylish. I didn't bother lacing them up. When I put them on they were tight on my thighs, loose below the knee and because they are more of a hip hugger style jean, they sit low and causes a ""droop"" and bulge in the crotch area that looked awkward. I ordered the 2X and normally wear a size 16 US. They sizing seemed off to me and ran small."
2.0,"It was a beautiful dress that fit me really well, but I only wore it once. Once it hit the dryer it shrunk down to the size of a weirdly cut shirt. I'm pretty disappointed because I really liked it, but it shrunk. If you are buying this, buy a bigger size and expect the dryer to 'fit' it to you :/"
2.0,"Didn’t like the hoops,  They were thinner than described . Feels like They are more Defoe a teenager than a grown woman."
2.0,"5' 3.25"", 165lbs wearing a size Large. Inseam is 29"" so it is full length on me and not ""ankle"" length as indicated in the description. back pockets are ""fake"" and do not open. 2 front pockets, belt loops all around, and elastic waist on the backside. pants are not very flattering for my taste and the 95% polyester fabric makes it feel and look cheap. I'm sure there are some females who will be able to dress it up with a nice top, cute shoes, accessories and make it rock, but for me, I'm a little plain in that department, so it is what it is."
2.0,Not warm in cold weather. Tore up in 3 months.
2.0,"Cute dress but I looked like a fat cow. The material seemed fine but the dress was too short and showed my fat legs, the dress doesn't hide fat belly either. I am fairly tall but the dress looked awful on me, the dress was too small, too short and made me look fat. I returned the dress. It was a real bummer!"
2.0,Ordered size 4t and 3 of the 5 shirts are fine but the other two are a totally different size and design than what is shown/what I ordered. It’s like they ran out of the size I ordered and they just shoved two random shirts in there.
2.0,"Straight cut, especially the pants. If you have a hint of curves order a size or two up."
2.0,"I recieved this bag and automatically didn't like it upon opening it.When you touch it, it feels gummy, extremely rubbery in my opinion. It does not have a wide opening or a structured bottom, but rather a narrow opening and a small, narrower bottom. This bag would be extremely handy to tote around a laptop or tablet, but it doesn't have much give to it and felt rather cheap. I immediately returned it the next day."
2.0,"Love the look, just made my arm turn GREEN."
2.0,I really wanted to love this dress. It appeared to be made fine it just didn't fit right. There isnt a way to tie it to fit so while it fit on top it was baggy in the middle and wasn't at all flattering. Might be more flattering on body types but it was a miss on my pear shaped body.
2.0,I was hoping the typo had been fixed.... guess not.<br /><br />The rest are great.
2.0,Super light see through fabric more like a oversized tshirt
2.0,"Good for the money (2/3 so far), however after one wash one of the sleeve seams came off. The other two held up fine so I’m hoping I only got one bad shirt. Otherwise, I’d buy them again as long as they hold up. The comfort is nice for a workout shirt, and the shape makes the muscles look good 💪🏼"
2.0,"The shirt is cute, but not a good material. Almost like a dry fit material that is stretchy and the pattern is not the same as the picture."
2.0,"Fits true to size, but shoulders have a strange shoulder pad appearance. Does not fit like picture depicts. Will return."
2.0,"These pants are really heavy, and they are made of Rayon - not a Cotton/Linen blend as the description states. I find they run large, the waistband is very bulky and uncomfortable, and the fabric and ties make them very heavy on my legs, so overall not very comfortable or breathable. They are cute if you don’t mind the extreme bagginess and the weight, but I was definitely hoping for a more breathable, lightweight summer pant."
2.0,"Not at all as described, very dissatisfied."
2.0,The sock is very pretty and seems well made but does not breathe. It's too warm to wear most of the year but I may get some use of it in the winter.
2.0,38DD... this shirt looks like a bra on me. Get two sizes bigger if your built like me
2.0,The earrings were cute but I tried to put on the larger pair and they didn’t clasp
2.0,Cant open the earrings up?!
2.0,"Yeah. NO. I'll keep them to wear UNDER stuff, but these are definitely not one size fits all. And see through as all heck."
2.0,So I wasn't expecting thumb loops ? as if it was an athletic shirt?<br />It had buttons to fasten at the bottom ( as a one piece) but it only had buttons for the back not the front.<br /> so I couldn't button the bottom. and the neck part is loose.<br />I made it work and wore it very cute. but not really satisfied
2.0,"This sweater is cute, sure. No tags, doesn’t fit at all. Not very happy, it’s like it was restocked after someone decided it wasn’t for them. At the size rate, I’d need a 1x or 2x which is crazy since I’m 5’8 and 140 pounds. Ordered a large, can’t even come close to closing sweater in front."
2.0,Works for a handful of uses then the teeth bend off and the product is useless. Get shirt stays from an Army Navy store or other military surplus place.
2.0,"they are small not good for adults , and they fog up"
2.0,"Not true to size, to small"
2.0,"It might be a bit flattering if the color wasn't so drab and if it fit better. However the fabric quality is so low $15 dresses from Walmart are much much nicer. I will return this dress, its not worth the price."
2.0,"The color is not as shown in the picture. It looks like a deep dark red but is a very light and cheap looking red. Wanted it for my Handmaid's Tale costume but color will not work. On the positive side, cloak is very long. I'm 6ft tall woman and it reaches the floor."
2.0,This is NOT oversized by any means. If you want oversized order 3 times bigger. Material is rough and scratchy. I’m returning mine.
2.0,This shirt looks nice on the model but the fit was awkward on me. Definitely not what I expected. I returned it. (M)
2.0,"I love the way the sweater looks in the product photo..unfortunately it doesn’t actually look like the photo.<br /><br />I ordered the Medium, Grey. I’m 5’9”, sporty build, 145 lb, slender but fit.<br /><br />The good..the grey is true to the photo. The texture of the sweater is also very nice.<br /><br />The bad...the sweater does not lay like the photo. Unzipped or otherwise. It is not form fitting, except maybe around the arms a little. Its actually very boxy when buttoned up. As the buttons themselves, it’s difficult to see what the buttons are in the photo, but the one I received are very cheap plastic black buttons. The button eyelets are tight and I over stretch one upon initial unbuttoning, so beware.<br />I’m going to wash it and see if I can shape it to be better. Worth a shot if it works. Really wish it actually look like the photo. Too bad."
2.0,"The small top seemed to be the right size technically, but the way it wraps just doesn’t work. I think you need cleavage. Quality isn’t great overall on the top. Bottoms are better, but sizing is hard when your bottom doesn’t necessarily match your top!"
2.0,These absolutely cannot be worn.  They are too long.  They hang a good 1/2 inch below your teeth so there's no way to close your mouth without looking like you have a fat lip.  Would work fine for Halloween but cannot be worn if you intend on speaking.
2.0,"The cut is very short, sizes run small."
2.0,Broke first day my daughter wore it.
2.0,"I'm not pleased. It doesn't stay in place. Constant adjusting and pulling up. I purchased my size, and my bras from other stores stay in place unlike this one."
2.0,These are junk the size is way off and I ripped 2 of the 4 trying to put them on.
2.0,The product was not the same color as the picture. There was a lot of white stitching all on the front of the mast. I colored the stitching silver with a marker so it wasn't a complete waste. I ordered it for a cake topper.
2.0,Small in size and material is clingy and unforgiving.
2.0,"I don't like writing negative reviews, but hopefully this gives someone heads up on what to expect.<br />I ordered this for an all white party and wouldn't dare try to wear it out in public as it was very thin and extremely see through. Looked more like an undergarment. Very poor quality. I can't speak for the colored items, but the white is definitely not a ""classy"" outfit if that is what you need."
2.0,"Very disappointing. When I first saw it, I was completely disappointed. The different bracelets are not fine & lose, but each is stiff & hanging with kinks in them so they are not straight. The &#34;diamonds&#34; do not all face out, some because of the kinks in the bracelets, face into the skin. Nothing catches the light so there is no sparkling, and the bracelet as a whole is on the small/short side, so there is no movement while against the wrist. So disappointing. If I hadn't purchased it as a gift I would have returned it. I don't know if they are all like this or if I received a 'defective' one."
2.0,"It is lightweight, seems well made, (stitching, material, etc,) but is NOT waterproof as stated throughout the description.  Will be fine with a coat of waterproofing.<br />Out of the box, this cute coat will only protect you for a very quick dash or a light misty day."
2.0,don't like the matrial.
2.0,"I got the gold and liked them, but I keep having to put them back together."
2.0,"The listing title is for the Dr Martens comfort insole, but what you actually receive is the Classic Insole. It automatically transfers into the next model down, and there’s no way to actually order the comfort insole."
2.0,"I returned these.  They came in a package that didn't seem secure so I wasn't sure if they had been used before so you may need a pad or thong before trying on.  I would definitely recommend washing them before you wear them.<br /><br />Also, maybe I overlooked this, but the crotch is not cotton.<br /><br />Other than that - they are cute."
2.0,I thought they would fit like the picture but they don't I can't never find the right pants to fit my body so it didn't surprise me
2.0,These gloves are very poor quality. The only good thing I can say is that they do keep your hands warm - otherwise as you can see in the pictures the stitching is poor. The buttons just fell off as I was putting my jacket over them since they are just super glued on there. The pointer finger is even missing a bit. Contacted the seller and they refunded me my<br />Money - so good customer service but not good quality 😓
2.0,"Be aware that not all of these dresses are made of the same thickness of cotton. This dress's fabric was much thinner that others in the same design, from the same vendor, in the same order."
2.0,FIT SMALLER THAN EXPECTED AND TWO OF THE BUTTONS WERE ALMOST COMPLETELY RIPPED OFF. DISAPPOINTING.
2.0,"Pictures and description indicate belt is included, it is not.  Material is wrinkled."
2.0,"It's not for anyone bigger than an small ""B"" cup"
2.0,"They were beautiful, but one was broken"
2.0,"These boots were super cute, but after the third time I wore them they started falling apart."
2.0,"Pretty disappointed, the material is not a solid 'wine' it is mottled with white thread. The look is too casual. Wa"
2.0,"Was extremely wide, will never wear"
2.0,"This dress is beautiful! However, we ordered three different colors for my daughter to try for a school dance and none of the dresses were the same length. They each had a different cut, dress length, and lace length."
2.0,It looks like it's not original (See the left one).
2.0,Very small and tight the XL is really M
2.0,No support in the top. You will fall out and/or have constant under boob. Pattern is cute but... eh overall.
2.0,Poor quality. Zipper broke after less than 2 months and a handful of uses
2.0,"this bangle is gigantic. I could probably wear it on my ankle if i tried. (i have 7.5in wrists) the two pearls on the ends of this cuff make it so heavy that they swing down, defeating the whole purpose. Pretty, but kind of pointless."
2.0,So the quality is great BUT this is not for a C cup and larger. The top is too small and the straps could never be pulled tight enough to keep it all held in. I am so disappointed because this is the cutest one piece.
2.0,very bag material
2.0,Too big and cheep fabric
2.0,It’s okay for the price but it’s really slippery. I’m going back to another brand
2.0,I have burcitis in my hip so I thought this would help and also one leg is longer than the other.  But it hasn't helped so far.
2.0,I’m happy the color is as it appears. I wasn’t prepared for how bulky and loose these pants would be. I bought this brand in black same size / style and they were an ideal fit ( not snug and not extremely loose). These are sized differently and feel awkward. They make me look bigger than I am. I have an average build. I’m not extremely thin nor am I curvy. I loved the black Amanda jeans so I was surprised these were a completely different fit.
2.0,"Wanted to love these, they feel good, look good, but had a hole in the crotch before I even put them on."
2.0,"I wear it and it start to come out for no reason!! But whenever it stays on its place is discrete. The worst thing, I used it for maybe 2 weeks and It broke with no reason when it was on my nose, when I pulled it out it was just half of it."
2.0,"It's really tight for a large, usually they're really big but it like suffocates my wrist. So size up I guess so don't get if you don't have a super tiny wrist"
2.0,"I gave to my son for a gift and he's 5'9, 150 lbs and has a naturally built physique.  He doesn't like shirts to have an overly tight fit.  I would recommend not to purchase a large but rather an X Lrg.  The overall length of the shirt is on the shorter side too.  I ended up giving the shirt - size Lrg to my daughter-in-law who is 5""5, 130 lbs and the shirt was a bit tight but not overly, the torso length of the shirt for her was appropriate.  The color and fabric are true to the picture descriptions."
2.0,"There's two things I look for in a watch, stylish, and comfortable. This thing is stylish yes, and I do like the design; however, while wearing it, you can feel the metal of the clasp lightly dig into your skin. If that didn't happen, I would give this watch 5/5. I might be returning it, as I can't seem to wear it over a half an hour until I get fed up with it."
2.0,This shirt definitely runs small. It also has material like a rain coat. Not my favorite.
2.0,this dress is way too big! the back of it made from 2 different types of materials ( texture ) returning it.
2.0,I liked the metallic material. I used it as a Luchadore costume for Halloween so it would popped. BUT the sizing ran very small.
2.0,Cute but never worked right. If I bumped it on something the clock would stop. Hit it again and it would start. Too much hassle to send it back so I never did.
2.0,Colors in all these shirts is much darker than pictured.  I have purchased more than just one and all are very dark.  Maybe 5 shades darker than shown.
2.0,sapphires weren't in earings they were laying in the bottom of the bag
2.0,It looks better in the photo than real life
2.0,"When I tried one on with my glasses, they were not anti fog, which is why I had ordered these.  I returned these items."
2.0,looks cool but some of the hands don’t work
2.0,cups to big
2.0,Advertised as 2 pair and only received 1<br />Pair.
2.0,"A few of the clips were bent.  In some cases they did not lay flat on a tie, it was crooked.  2 fit good"
2.0,Rough material. Not soft at all and way too big on my 8lb 20inch newborn more like 3 months size wise.
2.0,"I like the hat but I am not happy, the inside of the bill of the hat seems to be bigger than the outside liner because it is bumpy. it doesn't look nice nor pretty. I don't know where or how to returned it.<br />My e-mail is: yanitza2004@gmail.com<br />Thank you"
2.0,Very short and small.  So disappointed
2.0,The material is great. I normally wear a medium for loose fit and got a large just in case but the large may as well be a small. Don't see myself purchasing these tanks on the future
2.0,"the first day the strip just tore apart without even been used, and since then the pajama has continued getting damaged. Poor chinese quality."
2.0,"I knew it the size and shape would differ so I can’t be too disappointed that it’s small and almost square but I really hoped for something bigger and more unique.<br /><br />What bothers me about this is how dull it is. It’s supposed to be rainbow like, instead it’s a mostly clear, dull pastel colors. Nothing like the photos that are vibrant. So either I got a dude or the photos here on amazon are photoshopped to show much more vibrancy then it is.<br /><br />On the good hand, I ordered it March 18. It was estimated it would be here until sometime from april2-27th. I got it on March 31 so they shipped fast from China"
2.0,Will not stay on my ear the top part keeps falling off
2.0,Kaneki face is pink not worth the buy. Especially on the price it has!
2.0,"It's really cute, and love the idea! But I don't know how some people manage to tie the belt in different ways. As another reviewer stated, I am not able to get the belt through the loop a second time to make it look like a bow or anything of the sort. Now the end of the belt is all creased from my efforts. :\"
2.0,"I loved this purse when I first received it. It looked like a quality bag and the best part is that it is non-leather! However, after using it for a few weeks now it is starting to lose its shape and turning into a bag that looks like a big, square box. I was going to buy one in another color, but I have decided not to make the purchase. If there was a magnetic closure at the top, it would have kept its shape. There is a large center compartment with a zipper, but the outer compartments do not fasten to the purse, which is causing the sides to bow out. I'm disappointed because I really loved this purse when I received it. Also, the handles do not stand up because they were folded into the purse when packaged for shipping. Another disappointment. Had they been left out of the purse they would still be standing upright. Overall, the bag was very inexpensive, but I'm tired of spending $25-40 every few months thinking I finally found a great purse at a great price. The search continues!"
2.0,"I was disappointed with this product, item very small."
2.0,pretty but the clasp is not very secure
2.0,Broke as soon as I tried to put them on. RETURNED
2.0,Not made for tall people. I’m 5’9 and it fit like a shirt and it was too big up top.
2.0,I bought these for my 3 yr old and 5 yr old. These are poorly made. They were fraying even before they got their first wash.  The wrist bands are nice but the head/sweatband is too narrow and constantly flips around. It doesn't stay flat/flush on the head.
2.0,Returned. Not what I expected. It came extremely wrinkled! The color was a little to pink for what i was wanting. I also felt it made me look bigger than I actually am
2.0,I’t doesn’t lay flat on chest but sits up because of the way it’s made.  I’ve decided to use it for wall decor instead of returning it.
2.0,"Thought I liked them at first but realized quickly that the padding is way too thin.  The material seemed of ok quality, it did withstand a few washes and drys no problem.  It had a feel of boxer briefs as they ride high on the thighs.  There are much better options on Amazon for bike shorts."
2.0,too smallllllllll !!!!!!!
2.0,It’s too big even after going down a size and cheap material
2.0,not the same style as the picture
2.0,Great prompt delivery service. Ordered a 3x which is a size up and it barely fits.  Order 2 sizes up runs small. Sadly when I opened it it is already snagged on the sleeve. Seems like good comfy thinner material and soft.
2.0,Too long and like a plastic feel to the material of the dress.
2.0,"First, the top I received is hardly 'dusty pink' it's more like a rust color.<br /><br />Second, this top fits like a second skin .. and I'm sure when I wash it, this top will be heading to the Good Will.<br /><br />I purchased a medium and I'm 5ft, 4, 140 lbs, 34C.  While a large would probably fit better, I think I'll pass on a re-purchase."
2.0,"Way too big. I ordered a 33/34, 14-14.5 small and the body is huge. The shoulders are also quite big. The upside is the neck is comfortable. I am giving 2 stars because the quality is decent. I would return it but I need it for an event in a couple of days. My suit will hide how large this shirt is. For the price I don't mind giving it to charity after I use it.<br /><br />I'm 5'4&#34;, 145 lbs, average build."
2.0,"I love this shirt. Yet, after the first wash, it started to come apart. Each wash gets worse."
2.0,"I liked the jumpsuit, but the material made the outfit look more like lounge wear for INSIDE of the house, rather than outside."
2.0,Took almost 6 weeks to deliver. The product was average. It was not add nice as the picture appeared to be.
2.0,"Firstly, the title for this item is very off. There is no fleece lining in these bloomers. Its a stretchy synthetic fabric. There is nothing thermal about them. The picture of these are accurate- the bottom of the bloomers do flare out. The waist band is extremely tight. It is about a 1/2 inch of so wide. maybe slightly bigger and I can promise it will dig into you. Unless you are as slim as the model. Otherwise, you will feel these bloomers dig into your hips or belly. I'm very disappointed with these. I thought they would be comfortable for around the house for my wife, but instead we are both super disappointed in them."
2.0,"not adjustable, too small."
2.0,"The outfit is adorable. No issues with quality on this one (I've read other reviews for it about defects).  But it is SUPER SHORT! I bought the biggest size for my (just turned) 9 year old who wears a 7/8. When she put the outfit on, the shirt was longer than the skirt. We added leggings to it and problem solved for now. She may be able to wear it a few more times."
2.0,It made a scar on my neck. Not good for everyday wear.
2.0,"this runs a million times smaller than the size it claims to be! The color is spot on -i will give it credit for that, i ordered purple and purple is what i got. the material is stretchy but its also thin, making even the most petite person have every little flaw show through this dress. the material is soft, but it also reminds me of the material they use to make bikinis so im not sure it should be used for anything other than swim suits."
2.0,Did not like the material or the fit.  The shoulders sit really weird and I couldn't get it to even remotely look half way decent on me.  Asked for a refund because not close to what I expected.
2.0,"This is the see through, scratchy lace.  Not the super soft, well lined lace that's making a showing these days in a variety of bralettes.  It makes my boobs look sad, like a worn out bra that mom bought in the 1980s and was still wearing well into the 1990s."
2.0,It's not a comfy bra
2.0,Bought these for my husband. Cute socks but unfortunately too small for him.
2.0,Too short to close
2.0,My 8 year old loves sonic so I thought to but these for him since I purchased two other sonic mask and he loved them. These were way to big for his face. They fit more for an adult. I kept them any.
2.0,Strap broke during my 2nd use
2.0,Fits small. Buttons on the side broke with very little use.
2.0,"It didn’t come with adhesives, I was not able to stick it to my cap with really sucked. I would have loved if it came with the additional decorations too as I saw other reviews mentioned. Overall disappointing for $20."
2.0,The body material was great.  The shirt looked cute. But the sleeves had no give.  I am not a big person and the sleeves were way too tight!
2.0,Little aliens fell off after one use. I’d superglue it back on but it happened at work and I didn’t even know until I was home.
2.0,These are not good. Horribly made with cheap cloth and only would fit a child. Buyer beware
2.0,Cheap and it's  2 pieces.
2.0,Beautiful but it’s more for a bracelet not an anklet
2.0,Cute dress and cut but you can see through it especially up top! Don't buy unless you like to wear scarves!
2.0,Collapsed and lost a of the clippings everywhere and my husband refuses to use it now
2.0,Plastic Lenses keep falling out.  The lenses are very very thin.
2.0,The inside seams are scratchy and the elasticity of the fabric is not good.
2.0,They are awesome! The only problem was that the ones I got were a little loose. The lenses kept falling off.
2.0,Not comfortable...and hard to keep clean...
2.0,The packaging was very pretty I liked that each set of earring was in there own little plastic case. The earring looked pretty until you took them out of the cases the pearls would fall off. I hot glued them back and they are fine now they just need more glue
2.0,I ordered the camo neck gaitors and they sent skull ones. Im not sure if the school will allow them to wear skulls ones and they start back to school tomorrow.  I have 3 kids that needed to share these. 2 of them being girls thats why we went with camo ones.
2.0,"The material is cheap, not worth it"
2.0,Product is very cute and fit as expected but unfortunately they arrived with small holes on the front. I'm going to order another pair and send this pair back.
2.0,"I don't have a small head but these tend to fit loose. They slide down the nose at the slightest downward head tilt. Also the reader at 2.50 strength is weak and the bifocal area is quite small.  I would say they are good looking, but not for actual reading.  For reading strength I would order up if you do decide to go with them."
2.0,I hated the material . Only gave 2 stars because of speedy delivery
2.0,"A bit larger than another set we bought & liked. The smaller ones in this set are cute, but the larger they get, the more you can see they look a bit clumsy.<br />Also, the 2 linked (chained?) pins make no sense for Christmas: a black & gold bear linked to a Christmas tree that’s smaller than the bear? A red-bonneted pig linked to an apple?<br />Oh and the smaller pins have the butterfly clutch tie tack type. The larger pins have the pin backs with safety catch bar."
2.0,"Great looking pair of boots, my only negative is they arnt as “wide” calved as promised."
2.0,"I really liked them when I first opened them, however one of them broke after only 2 days of having it on.. I was in no way being rough with it or over-stretching it to cause this either- I was sliding it off my wrist to shower and it just came apart and the beads went everywhere. Pretty disappointed- not sure if I got a bad one or if they are really just poor quality."
2.0,Wristband broke off within a week and I lost it.
2.0,It’s ok...hurts my ears after a while
2.0,"The outside of the purse is nice. It is durable and attractive. However, I have a two sectioned purse because the lining came completely apart."
2.0,These pants are not made right and I waited to long to try them on. The waist fits like a normal 6t but is way to short for jeans
2.0,Length a little too short for my taste. My main problem was the neck line. It was saggy! Looked sloppy from the get go. Awful. It looked like I got in a fist fight.
2.0,"i am 5'5 and wear a 16 - this sweater was too long, the sleeves went past my hands and the pockets were too low to reach comfortably. but i liked the feel of the sweater , even though it had ""plastic"" smell."
2.0,"While the product looks beautiful upon opening, the fabric is very uncomfortable - I can’t imagine sleeping comfortably in this PJ set."
2.0,uncomfortaable
2.0,The photo did not show that these are the types of masks with multiple folds.
2.0,"When I got these I really liked the way they felt and how they imitated the original PS4 sticks pretty well. They seemed way more sturdy than what the original PS4 sticks ended up being.<br /><br />The problem came when I went to install the sticks. For some reason when either of these replacement sticks are installed in my controller's left stick position, they will rub with the controller when I tilt the stick the furthest it will go. The head of the stick is too shallow to clear the body of the case immediately around the left stick. It didn't matter which of the two sticks I put in the left position, they both had this problem. And they were both fine in the right position.<br /><br />When i took them out and compared them to the original PS4 thumbsticks, they appear identical in height as far as I could see, but there must have been just enough difference to create this issue. I almost suspect there's something wrong with my controller. Perhaps I bent it during the install to cause the left position to need more clearance..."
2.0,"The size fit me overall, but instead of the typical compression I'm used to from brands like Lululemon or Athleta, these had a tight fit around the very top of the waist band, while the rest of the waist and legs felt looser. It wasn't necessarily too tight to fit - it just constantly drew my attention to the fact that the very top of the waist was like a rubber band around my waist and everywhere else was looser. I'm not sure if that description makes sense, but these certainly didn't fit comfortably like any other compression leggings/shorts I've had. Ended up sending them back."
2.0,"This sweater is VERY oversized. I ordered it in a medium based on the size chart provided (I typically wear an 8 or 10 on top), and it's just huge on me. It also is longer and doesn't drape nearly as nicely as the picture on the model. I find the seam between the top shawl part and the rest of the knit sweater to be uncomfortable - it hits at a weird part of my arm and is distracting. That being said, it is very warm. If you're looking for a sweater that looks like you're wearing a blanket, or truly just want something warm for around the house, this might be worth your while. I would recommend sizing down."
2.0,Very disappointed in these bracelets. If you don’t have tiny child like wrists these won’t fit you comfortably. I was only able to gift one of them and had to find a child to give the other to.
2.0,It not enough strong.<br />I have to dump it.
2.0,"Not cute:( super disappointed. Ordered a large but the sleeves are short, fits funny, and looks cheap."
2.0,I love how soft these leggings are but they easily get holes and rip apart even on first use.
2.0,"Disappointing, the basket will not stay closed when changing balls.  My resolve, pic favorite ball and crazy glue it shut."
2.0,"I would love to give a great review but it is way too small. I ordered a size up and it just doesn’t fit, it’s too small even though I ordered a size up."
2.0,This is really pretty except that the clasp broke the first time I put it on.
2.0,I ordered this product for my daughter. She likes it however some of them wrote the first day. But it's a nice product that teenagers
2.0,It looks great and the fabric is soft however the clasp is in the middle of your back where you can't reach to clasp it yourself makeing it difficult to put on and take off.
2.0,"Cute bag, but completely fell apart after just a 2 months."
2.0,"I purchased these for my daughter and she hasn't been able to wear them. The posts are too short for her ears, and she's only 12. The front and back come off making it nearly impossible to get them to stay together. They are sturdy metal though, and the colors are nice. Too bad she won't be able to ever wear them."
2.0,It got fuzzy after first wash. It’s cute but not worth the money
2.0,"It is jewelry and the 'purple turquoise'  was rubbed off of part of the pendant and both earrings before it arrived.  Where it is gone, the silver shines through but I didn't want a silver pendant and earrings, I wanted a purple pendant and earrings! Not pleased at all!!"
2.0,This was really cute for a while but then the silver wore off on the back of the ears and turned gold and started giving me a rash. It was super painful.
2.0,Odd fit. Returned
2.0,"Looks nice in the picture, but once it arrived, it just looks like a cheap replica, also doesn't keep time well. Wouldn't recommend this as a watch, but if you are just looking for Doctor Who collectible, why not."
2.0,"These glasses are a bit weird. The bridge of the glasses that rests on the nose is very narrow, so they sit farther out on your face than normal glasses. The lenses also cause a strange, green refraction at night time. I bought them for cycling at night, but they don't really get the job done. They'd work fine for a costume, etc. but they do look/feel a bit strange."
2.0,"Just got it in the mail open it up and it smells like someone’a perfume and clearly has someone else’s make up on it 😱…not cool, not cool.  Dress is a good quality but I feel cheated."
2.0,They were too big did my head they fall off easy. Look nice and feel comfortable if had a bigger head.
2.0,"I ordered 32s. The size tag was not attached, rather it was just thrown in the bag. I tried them on and they are way too big! The shorts in the photo look like a higher quality material, and the color is a bit different. I like the color in the photo better than what I actually received. Ended up returning them."
2.0,The product looks cheap and fits smaller than needed.
2.0,The shirt looked like the picture but it was too short. Width was normal just way too short.
2.0,"Had to return. Missing belt and broken zipper. May reorder though, as I liked the design."
2.0,I like the shirt. It just runs small.  I ordered x large and it's tight in the arms.
2.0,"DO NOT use on carpet.  The non-skid sole catches on carpet and you'll trip.  When I first tried them on I walked down my carpeted hallway.  I only took 2 steps before my foot got stuck on the carpet and I fell forward.  I didn't fall down, but it's scary for an elderly diabetic lady.<br /><br />They would be excellent on tile, wood or hard surface floors and patios. They are well made, true to fit and the seam is finished inside the back heel to avoid skin irritation or blisters."
2.0,the front was very lowcut but the size overall was too big
2.0,"Shovel/probe pocket does not fit even a smaller than standard shovel and probe! Larger p pocket does and that's what I use, pack is otherwise great. But what the heck, Dakine? Don't call it a shovel/probe pocket and but research what will fit in there. 🤷"
2.0,very snug and had some discoloration on the front. returned it immediately.
2.0,"The color is not red,like orange brown ,the elastic is not strong,when I put it on some of the elastic came apart ,elastic poor quality, so I end up replacing the elastic to be able to wear it."
2.0,They are just what the pictures show and well made but the size is way too small
2.0,They were good at first but after a month one of the adjustment clips broke. Also one of the back Clips often came unclipped. I would shop elsewhere these are cheap. I contacted the vendor but never heard back.
2.0,"I just received this and tried them on. The Pros they look good stylish. As far as protecting they will protect my eyes from saw dust or debris. The cons are every time I take them off the temples feel sharp as if my ears are going to get cut off. Also is it me or does it feel like looking through them, it has a fish bowl effect. Well I guess I will have file down the temples and just have to suck it up when looking  through the fish bowl glasses. For $11 bucks I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,"Cheaply made, too big was told to order up one size! Love the color!"
2.0,it was much to small
2.0,Not the same bright purple color as picture and was big on the chest
2.0,Cheap feeling material. The medium was also too large for me! Not true to size ☹️
2.0,This runs small and the sleeves are very tight.
2.0,The clasp was broke had to be replaced otherwise I like it
2.0,"So sad about the size. My daughter is living in Germany this school year and I ordered this jacket for her because it is water proof, hooded and warm for her cold morning bike rides. However, when the coat arrived ttday, the large is even too small for her tiny host mom. She loved the coat but if the large is too small then there is no way the xl will fit. Confused by the sizing."
2.0,"I like the hat, it should do the job of shading my face adequately. However, the elastic, which is supposed to run through the sweat band, in order to adjust the fit, was only halfway through. The sole purpose of buying this style was for the adjustable band. I'm going to have to find a small safety pin and see if one of my kids can run the elastic through. If they can, I would definitely rate this a 4"
2.0,The band around the waistline makes it unwearable... Too small!
2.0,"The watch band seems fair enough, however it looks like a used band, it has scratches and the packaging is the worst packaging I have ever seen on any Amazon product, more so for something of this price.<br /><br />The band came with no tags or any type of mention to Tag Heur, inside a zip lock with no padding around or or anything to prevent damage.<br /><br />I wouldn’t by this again"
2.0,"It's a child's cape. BOOM and SPLASH are ironed on so not removable. May be too short depending on the height of the child.Overall the stitching around the mask could have been better, but it wasn't horrible. Item stated that it came with stickers, but it didn't. Very disappointing for a kid."
2.0,The shape of the dress is beautiful but it is COMPLETELY see through. I’ll be returning ASAP.
2.0,"Comfortable, but this was advertised as having a built-in bra. No such thing exists."
2.0,"Mine was not the same as the picture showed. The stone is black, but the rest of the earring is silver. Oh well... Only cost $1.99."
2.0,What I received looked a lot cheaper then what's pictured. Returned it
2.0,I like the purse. However the wallet has stitching already coming out so there is a hole in the inside pocket and I haven’t even used it yet. I unwrapped it like that.
2.0,"Really thin fabric, beautiful dress, it doesn’t stretch at all. Not for busty women."
2.0,"Band at waist is super tight, stiff, and thick."
2.0,It shrunk after one wash...
2.0,"The fabric is strange. Sort of cheap and very, very short. The style is super cute, so I was disappointed. I ordered a small. I’m 5’7, 114 lbs. the waist is elastic and fits tight. If this skirt would have been an inch longer and the fabric was better quality, I would have loved it!"
2.0,"This is just a pullover with cuffed sleeves with buttons. That piece of design plus the color are the only reasons why I give this two stars. Otherwise, this isn't quite what I expected. The model is wearing a size much larger than what she would normally wear. The V only comes half way down my chest. Not to the top of my cleavage. A completely different look. I'll wear it for the holidays, but I doubt it will be something I wear again."
2.0,"Fabric is soft, fits a bit snug, fabric has a black mark on white part of fabric right on the left breast area - totally noticeable! Not good!!"
2.0,"Love the design, however the quality is lower than I would have expected from a company like Funko. My shirt shrank and the design started to show signs of fading after a single wash."
2.0,"I was super excited for this purchase; I ordered the dusty pink and what arrived was a bright almost salmon colored, yarn like, see-through, sweater. Also not as oversized as it appears in pictures. Falls off the shoulder constantly and is short. If I saw this at like a TJ Maxx I probably wouldn’t even pay $15 for this. I will definitely be returning unfortunately."
2.0,This is silver. Not white. Runs small.
2.0,Very flimsy and wasn’t really worth the price
2.0,I go to a spin class and these tops roll up as I’m riding. I have to constantly pull the top down to keep it from rolling up to my chest exposing my stomach. I purchase a size up to avoid this from happening but nope. Maybe I should have gone 2 sizes up.
2.0,They would have been great if they would have fit... but sizing was definitely wayyyyy off.
2.0,"Well made, solid. loads of room.<br />no laptop padded area.  Zero padding on the bottom and questionable on the two sides, zero on the ends/edges.<br />No padding on the bottom, what protects the notebook when its put down like a bag this size would be?<br /><br />The center compartment will hold a 5"" thick by 17.3"" notebook easy.<br />Mine not being the size of a cinder block by rather a 2020 model 17.3""  2"" thick notebook, A normal notebook is just lost inside this bag.<br />Now in fairness there is padding about 1/4? thick inside on the two walls where you place the cinder block for safe keeping, if your notebook is like mine  the notebook wont even sit upright in this unless you back fill it with loads of stuffing.<br /><br />Now if I was Indiana Jones and I needed a bag this would be it! Keep a priceless gold idol the size a large brick check the center compartment is perfect for something that large. but to<br />keep a notebook safe this bag wont do it alone, you'll need a bag to put it a padded sleeve or case before you put it inside this."
2.0,Very cheap looking and feeling. Poor Quality.
2.0,Not true to sixe
2.0,"I am a lifeguard and I have lost whistles in the pond and decided I needed a floater. The quality of the floater itself was good, but I could only use it for one day because the chain attached to it broke."
2.0,It's okay I thought it was going to be more long but I'm a bit taller I'm 5-11 and I wear it as a nightgown
2.0,"I was on the lookout for a cute one piece bathing suit this summer and this one seemed perfect. It was a cute suit in the pictures but when I got it …it was not what I thought. The fabric is VERY thin so thin that this could NOT be worn as a bathing suit unless you want everyone to see your goodies…<br />You can definitely see through the top if you look close enough indoors but I’m sure it’s a lot more see through when you’re outside and especially in the water. I got a large and I’m 5’4” and 140 lbs, it seemed to fit be nicely as far as sizing goes. I’m usually a medium for reference.<br /><br />The screen print on the front was a bit off too. You can see that it was already rubbed off on some parts of it. I think this would be okay with some pedals on my nipples underneath and with shorts…. I can't wear this without people seeing everything under it. You can see that the fabric is so thin you can see through it and also the whole suit can fit in the palm of my hand.<br /><br />I did purchase this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
2.0,The earrings are super cute but the clasp broke with just two uses.  :(  I have a very disappointed little girl.
2.0,"I bought one of these watches because I liked the design and thought it was at a good price. When I received my watch, I was very happy with the feel. The leather band felt very good, and it had a nice weight. However, I soon realized that my watch was defective, since the hour hand got stuck at the 6 position and would no longer tell time (although to be fair, it got the time right twice per day). I returned it as defective, and ordered another watch. The second watch I received was not from the same brand. It was much lower in quality, and the band was not made out of &#34;genuine cow hide leather&#34; as is said on the description, but instead from a cheap pleather. I'm very unhappy, since I did not buy other models specifically because I saw that this watch was made with genuine leather."
2.0,"El error fue mío por no poner atención a la tabla de medidas, sin embrago en la foto da la impresión de que tiene una cintura estrecha y nada que ver, el ancho es el mismo desde los hombros, si son bajitas y delgadas la talla más pequeña les quedará enorme."
2.0,The metal part that hangs down is WAY too long. Not up high like the choker. Hangs down almost to my chest. The provided picture is deceiving. Only problem I had with this product
2.0,has some sharp metal and cut my nose
2.0,5x is like an short 2x!
2.0,To small more for babies then adults
2.0,Took almost two MONTHS to receive these shoes. Have had them about a week and some of the lights are already out.
2.0,Less than 2 weeks of wear and the yellow has already peeled off.  Without all the colors its useless.
2.0,I bought this for my mother because my father just passed away and she wanted something that had this saying on it because he always said it to her. As soon as she put it on the chain broke. The charm is still cute and we will find another chain but was just annoying to have it break so quickly.
2.0,No as  appears
2.0,I loved this but color turned in 2 days.
2.0,"I literally just bought this and replaced my older ripped band.  Within two weeks, the new one ripped as well.  And we are not rough users"
2.0,Nice beach wrap - not a dress for going out - very thin
2.0,The bottoms are made so weird it’s not very flattering tbh but it’s cute the top kinda flimsy
2.0,"It is cute and as pictured with only one caveat---It is a major issue, it is much much smaller than what is pictured. It basically just perches on your head, it does not cover your head as shown in the other photos. It is not a hat, it's a fascinator. Beware!"
2.0,"Like a lot of people in here, the corset was too small for me and so I returned it and wanted to order a larger one. The corset itself is beautiful and high quality. I am disappointed that I was not refunded the full amount however and for some reason, their shipping has changed to a slower method so now I can't even order a larger one since it will not get to me on time for the Steampunk ball I am going to 😔"
2.0,Reviewed
2.0,"Arrived on time, nice bracelet. Bought as a gift for my fiancee. Unfortunately one of the links fell out 2 months after receiving"
2.0,The shine on the black beads faded within weeks.
2.0,"My sister bought this dress and looked fantastic in it so I thought I would give it a try.  When I received it, it was balled up and INSIDE OUT!!! Gross.  I tried it on anyway and found that it was not flattering on me at all.  Perhaps a larger size would look better, but the material was fairly course, and I did not like where the waistline fell on me.  Maybe better for a differently proportioned person."
2.0,"Pretty dress, had to return because it was too small."
2.0,"The socks are ok, however for the price I expected them to have more cushioning in the heel and mid foot.  I also expected the socks to be thicker similar to the Nike basketball socks.  I’m glad I only purchased one pair."
2.0,"Orange color, runs small, but good fabric, had to send back , runs small"
2.0,"I like the fit and colors, but they have a STRONG chemical smell.  I soaked them for hours, let them air dry, and I can still smell chemicals.  Hoping the odor will fade over time."
2.0,"More for style than actually blocking brightness from the sun. I ordered 4 pairs of these. The ones with the orange and yellow lenses give a blue tint when looking through them, making outside actually brighter than darker. The black lenses are faded from dark at the top to light at the bottom, making the tint in the middle that you look through not very dark. I wouldn't buy these again as effective sunglasses."
2.0,The pants fit perfect the hat as well but the shirt has a very wide neck which is awkward. For the price though it was not to bad that the shirt didn't fit the pants were my reason for ordering anyways.
2.0,Sucks don’t get it
2.0,Dress was made of very flimsy tee shirt material. No shape at all. Shapeless. Not flattering. Very disappointed. Plus I waited almost 2 weeks to receive.
2.0,"The stitching is so uneven on the bust, normally I never write reviews but this was very disappointing and I will be returning. The crossover back strap also fit really awkward (it goes into the armpit area)."
2.0,Bought this for my Grandson who has adhd & the necklace broke the 2nd time he wore it.
2.0,Liked the design and quality was decent but much too large. I’m usually a small (I’m 5’ 3” 100 lbs) but these didn’t come in small. Many people listed they were too small so I thought the medium would fit but it was way too big. Waistline fit but everything else was huge!
2.0,Was Not Compatible wIth the NEW Southwest 700-800 max planes
2.0,"Nice tunic but XL more like 2XL, too big."
2.0,"Me llegaron rotos. son bonitos, pero muy grandes para caras delgadas y chicas!"
2.0,Broke off the first time I wore it.  The ends are glued on instead of roped so they snapped off at the slightest tug of my jacket.  Pretty though.
2.0,I got the white pearl instead of pink. very disappointed.
2.0,"I purchased these socks because I was looking for a longer crew style. The headline has the word ""long"" in it, and the photo makes them appear longer than a typical crew style. Nope, nope, nope! They are cute but they are short ( before washing). Sigh..."
2.0,"This was not a grey bag like I thought I had ordered. Instead, it was a weird metallic color that looked really cheap. The quality is horrible and the gold pieces are chipped. Defiantly not able to bring this into the office like I hoped. I had really high hopes for this, but I'm left incredibly disappointed. Will be returning it asap<br /><br />EDIT: On the same day of my original review, the seller reached out to me immediately apologizing for not living up to my expectations.They already refunded my purchase which I appreciated, however I wished they had just sent me a good quality bag to begin with. I have added a star for their customer service. They need to either make their bags look like their photos or take photos accurately representing the product they send."
2.0,"Very pretty, but the grey comes right off with minimal scratches! It wont last long in terms of cosmetics. Not satisfied"
2.0,"Brought his as a mother's day gift and after a feed ay of her wearing it, she developed a rash. It's cute though."
2.0,&#34;US Size 38&#34; measure 41 inches at the waist.  I guess an inch tape measure is too hard to figure out.
2.0,Broke within a few days...
2.0,I like the style but the short is too small and the t-shirt is too big
2.0,The dress is a cute style but the pockets are situated in an odd spot on the sides of the dress not like the picture.  It is a basic t-shirt dress but sizing is way off.  It runs about 2 sizes smaller than what the chart indicates.
2.0,Falling apart before I received them.  I returned them.
2.0,"The material was not what I expected.  It seemed cheap. Oh yeah, it was cheap:)"
2.0,These things fit my face. They are huge to be called toddler glasses.
2.0,Thay are great for not being seen. The half ball on top is great the half ball on the bottom hurt.
2.0,I love the look of this watch but we have not had it in possession as it has been to the repair shop several times. I highly recommend fossil but this one might not be worth the effort.
2.0,nice design but very small and the fabric was not great.
2.0,I’ve ordered this top several years before and it was BEAUTIFUL- This time very cheap bad material- I returned it-
2.0,tarnished quickly
2.0,It wasn’t long enough
2.0,"Couldn't get these pants to button. Which is sad because I followed the sizing and even the size suggestion. These are super cute and normally an XL would fit, I wear a large 9 times out of 10. Oh well..."
2.0,"This is exactly the style of lanyard I was looking for, but it's long as hell. Too long to be used with my keys or around my neck."
2.0,Fabric was rough
2.0,I bought them for my 9 yr old but they keep falling off her face.
2.0,"The waist was tiny but the legs were extra long. Had to return. They were well made and soft, though."
2.0,Cute in the picture... shoulder straps make it awkward to carry... Loved the color though
2.0,If I’m being honest the only think this mask has going for it is that it has a cute design. The elastic around the ears is too stretchy and just too big it will not stay up. And the material it is made out of is no good it suctions to my nostrils every time I breath in. So unfortunately I cannot even use it.
2.0,"The jacket came in a bag that was labeled the size that I had ordered, which was age 8/9, but the label on the bag said ""Cat Jackets for Girls Zip Up Hoodie Kitty Sweatshirt Halloween Costume 8 9"" and that was confusing. I was excited to get this for my niece who loves unicorns but I guess that was not an option. I noticed that the envelope package that it came in was smaller than I was expecting and that should have been the first clue. When I took the jacket out of the bag I started laughing at how small it was. I made sure to read *most* of the reviews available for the jacket before I purchased it and they were pretty much positive and everything was true to size. Cool. After I stopped laughing I looked at the tag and it was a size for ages 3/4. I was a little upset because the jacket is adorable and I would love to be able to purchase more jackets in others patterns/designs but I cannot trust that I will be receiving the correct size. Basically when you buy a jacket from this seller you will be taking a gamble on what size you will receive versus the size that you ordered. 5 out of 5 for the quality of the material and build of the jacket and design. Price is also on point. Just be wary that you will be taking that gamble on getting the size you ordered. I now am looking for someone with a child young enough to take this jacket off my hands."
2.0,These earrings look nice in person but the metal material has a tendency to irritate my ear.
2.0,"This dress is not flattering. It’s a strange looking dress. I feel like a blue ornament in it. Also...even though the return is suppose to be free, amazon needs to reach the seller and they need to approve the return within two days. Hope it’s truly “returnable”. I’m 5’2 and 120...I’m not thin, but not a whale either. Wasn’t really going for the blue Christmas ornament look."
2.0,They are so large and d'idées fit my daughter though the quality was good
2.0,Fits weird and quality is cheap. The band is a little tight and the stripes are tight but the rest is baggy
2.0,It's pretty but it's too big.  I'm 5'6 and weigh 148 and I ordered a Large.  It has an elastic waist which i was a little disappointed to see as it makes it feel more casual then fancy.  I'm sending it back but ordering a medium to see if that works.  Arrived on time with Prime.
2.0,"The first one i got was broken and then when I contacted about it they sent me another one free of charge which was awesome. Fair warning though, the draping chains do not lay perfectly flat and the head chain .. while cute... is not the easiest accesory to put on straight"
2.0,"Dress is ok. It wasnt as thick as I expected but its not see through. I'm 5'4"" and it's pretty long on me, longer than I wanted."
2.0,The wallet is stiff and somewhat bulky.  Not soft leather at all.
2.0,"Runs way to big, I do not like how loosely it fits. I'm 5'7&#34; and 150 pounds and a small was too loose."
2.0,nice gift for teen agers
2.0,"12 month update/edit:<br />My 1st impression was very wrong. I really only had to adjust this belt one time and it has been near perfect ever since.  I love this belt. I am going to leave my original rating to draw attention to fist impression vs. 1 year impression.<br /><br />First Impression: I don't understand the design of this belt. The ""extra"" length of the belt goes UNDER the belt. This means you cannot adjust it without taking the belt completely off.<br />Also, you have a LEATHER LUMP in your HIP between the belt and your pant.  My solution to this uncomfortable and difficult-to-adjust design was to flip it the other way on the buckle. BUT, now it has the ugly sewn-side-out instead of the vanity side (see pic). I don't ever do returns/exchanges by mail, so I am stuck with this, but how annoying.  Purchased the Midnighter Slim/Black Noir"
2.0,"There's simply NO way this is 50L. It's more like 25, if even that. It felt like a toy your kid would use for kindergarten. Avoid this pack. Get an Osprey instead. That's rated Top Ten by Backpacking Magazine."
2.0,"Swimsuit is not true to size and was way too small for my daughter. I ordered a XL/9-10. Not to mention that swimsuit was also defective upon receiving it. Gave a 2 star because it is pretty, just wished it fit and wasn't defective."
2.0,It fits waaaayyy small. I’m a blessed girl up top and ordered an xlarge but it fit like a medium.
2.0,"Like style of dress<br />Dislike product appeared used, smelled<br />Already been used by customer???????<br />Not therapeutic feel"
2.0,"3XL feels like an extra large not 1,2 or 3XL"
2.0,The masks run really big on your face.
2.0,"Fits as expected, a little blousy.  I would have kept but it was just a little too see through for me."
2.0,Honestly disappointed....material is very low grade & scratches the skin....these PJ’s did arrive in a beautiful package but the quality is not my favorite & the fit is on the tighter side
2.0,Colors are not accurate. And Amazon is making it increasingly difficult to return anything. The second shirt I ordered was a better color.
2.0,"The zippers are of poor quality...one bag had the zipper split (it was open behind where it was zipped), another one, the zipper did not open all the way around...it was stuck at the 3/4 mark..I didn't want to try to force it and have it break.<br />Also, shipping took too long."
2.0,Not the best quality but definitely not the worst
2.0,"These sunglasses are very cheaply made, very light weight and feel like they will break very easily. The bows are uncomfortable and rough."
2.0,I wanted to love these shades but they are flimsy.  The lens popped out after a week of use and I have not been able to fix it.<br />For the week I was able to use the product I was happy at the convenience but they are not for the long haul.  Would not recommend.
2.0,"I have the exact same shirt, which feels great and fits perfectly . . . but, it was made in Indonesia.  This one was made in El Salvador, and fits tightly around the belly.  Not pleased."
2.0,I did not expect this to be a cotton t shirt dress. The ruffle was sewed on to the sleeve and had a giant hole. Returning.<br />Cheaply made
2.0,Liked the watch band. It took several attempts by both my husband and myself to get this band on the watch it was very difficult. It was easy to remove the links though.
2.0,This was a pretty top and. basically it was loose except for across the chest where it was tight. I bought a size large and the sleeves were tight and it was tight across the chest though I am only a C cup. It was an oddly designed top. I had to return it.
2.0,"The dress arrived all wrinkled.  I'm not sure of the fabric content, but whatever it is, it's just not appropriate for my lifestyle.  I returned it immediately."
2.0,These are so super little!! The picture is twice the size of them. Maybe 3 times the size.
2.0,I had to return this product: it was very hard to open and put on the necklace! The bracelet was too small (and I have one of the tiniest wrists!). I just could not hold the clasp of the necklace and bracelet without it slipping through my fingers!
2.0,The inside of this shirt is white so if you have boobs that stretch out shirts forget about it. The black turns grey and it’s very clearly stretched out. I got an xl and have an H-cup and this is impossible.
2.0,Love the way they look but way way to big my son is an 11 and these are huge on him!!  I'm just going to have to save them for next year.
2.0,"The bottoms are cute, but the top provides zero support. If you are more than an A cup, think twice."
2.0,The material this is made of something a bathing suit would be made of. Wasn’t expecting high quality for the price but this will be sent back.
2.0,I really wanted to love this dress but it is definitely NOT for those with a big bust. I’m a 34DD and the sewed top pattern in this dress is intended for a smaller bust. Also the sleeves are really tight.
2.0,Color does not look like the picture.  Socks were very washed.
2.0,Super thin material and high cut leg holes. Not true to size. Very big on my 4 year old daughter
2.0,It was super cute and worked. The ties were super short making it hard to tie. They would maybe work for a small child but the ties would still be an issue. For the cost and I only had to wear it for 2 hours it worked.
2.0,The sweatshirt is very nice but it is described as 100% cotton.  It is not. It is a 50/50 blend.  My husband cannot wear blends.  It being 100% cotton was the reason it was ordered.  It is being returned.<br /><br />I also purchased one for my son- it doesn't matter for him and the fit is great.  If it was described correctly this review would be a 5 stars.
2.0,"It looks amazing, but it falls off easily and the clasp broke. It also hurts to wear because the clasp is stabbing into your ear"
2.0,The product was not what I thought it would be.
2.0,Did not realize the cross was a cheep thin wood piece
2.0,"Initially when I bought this it was perfect but less than 6 months later and the clasp has broken on one hinge. Unfortunately this is not robust enough to justify the price. I would expect at the very least 2-3 years for a watch band. They have the right idea but wrong execution in regards to durability. The I watch requires you to take it off daily to charge so, of course their is more wear and tear. The hinge is about 1 mm in thickness very thin stuff."
2.0,These pants are comfortable but the material isn't that great and I'm pretty universally a size med but these are pretty loose. I definitely won't be wearing these out in public....
2.0,"I did not like that the dress was a little to long, not what I expected, also I did not like the material."
2.0,"Poor quality,  within a month, some if the letter had come off.  Not good,  since my son initially loved it."
2.0,The first pair broke as my husband was taking the plastic off.
2.0,"I've owned a couple different types of these ULTRA CHEAP blue blocking glasses.  They are always made by some company that you've never heard of before and cost next to nothing.  I don't think they are really blocking blue light, and I recommend that if you value your eyes you would buy a pair from a reputable company.  I'm not sure they are really doing anything.  My very nice pair of prescription glasses has a blue blocking feature and you can see the difference in tint when you move from one to the other.<br /><br />On these the lenses are clearly very low quality, with occlusions (blurry spots), sometimes like looking through a plastic bottle.<br /><br />I just think my eyes are worth more than that."
2.0,"Was unable to use as not made for thicker lenses, or plastic frames. Will not go on these easily as too small of a spring."
2.0,Material is very thin and scratchy. Fit seems to run small. I’ll most likely be returning it.
2.0,Alright product. Will keep your hand relatively warm but they are hard to put on and take off and they don’t offer much maneuverability.
2.0,"Really really cute, but very see through. Would work fine for the beach or as a coverup, but not as a dress. Sadly, had to return."
2.0,"Shirt was to small, but it's not a huge issue, I just wish it was true to size"
2.0,"A little too long to just be an extra layer, almost fits more like a robe or dress, and I’m a tall person, so I cannot even begin to wonder what this looks like on someone shorter. The belt just makes it more awkward."
2.0,"If you're skinny with big boobs, this will fit great. Unfortunately, I'm chubby with big boobs, so this is too tight around the abdomen and way too loose in the chest."
2.0,The sizing chart was not accurate. I got my correct size as I went by the sizing chart and it was way too small and the back would not stay up and rolled down instantly. I was looking forward wearing this under my dress for my husbands military homecoming but not when I will be uncomfortable. Now on the hunt for something better hopefully.
2.0,Will be returning this bag. It is pretty but it came in missing part of the trim on the handles.
2.0,"I wanted to use these for a while before reviewing them in order to give an accurate description. After two months I gave them 4 stars, but after 9 months I must reduce that. I searched many places for boots like these, and this was about the cheapest I could find for the size and durability that I needed. I've used these outside doing yard work, in the snow, and long walks, but now after 9 months the material is cracked in places, which means they are no longer waterproof either. The bootlaces only lasted a couple months before fraying apart. The heels inside have a very stiff chunk inside that chafes against my Achilles' tendon. I guess the only difference between high-tops and hiking boots is the laces? These were good at first and at a very affordable price, and they seemed waterproof until they began to break down, which was less than a year of normal use. Shoes should last at least a year, if not, don't even sell them to me no matter how cheap they are."
2.0,could use to b more tinted
2.0,I wear a size 55 in an authentic dirndl and ordered a 3X. It was way too big so definitely size down a bit.
2.0,Material is very flimsy and super static!! Not a big fan. And I bought it for a summer gathering. Imagine what winter would bring for static! Pretty navy color though.
2.0,I ordered a pair for my 82yr old mother in medium.  They were too tight across the top of the glove.  Those were returned for a large.  The same thing with those.  My mom is 5'4&#34; and I would consider her to be petite.  She doesn't have large hands.  This pair is being given to one of my mom's friends because returning a 2nd pair and ordering again is basically a crap shoot and not worth my time.  I am just going to go to a local store and get a pair that she can try on first.<br />The reason for 2 stars is because of the fit issue.  They are nice gloves and look go be quite warm.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:358cdfd2532078dc5bed4662ab9e52d4]] It’s super lightweight. I don’t like that about it, the sound of it… It sounds cheaply made, it feels cheap for the price to be 70 bucks."
2.0,"Size is good, but when buckled either too tight or to loose."
2.0,Stitching came loose after 2 uses Shoe compartment totally detached<br />Totally dissatisfied with this product<br />Will buy a name brand next time
2.0,The fabric is not comfortable for summer
2.0,These were very small. Did not fit over my husbands calves (or mine). They fit my 10 year old. Otherwise quality is good.
2.0,"Fun colors but sizing not reliable.  Of the three, they ran very small to small."
2.0,Large long... fit as if the shoulders were sewn backwards . Great money replacement. Nqa
2.0,Zipper is cheap and the jacket is thin but it’s cute but not long like the picture
2.0,The eyes look like they are fading and the bracelet looks old because of that.
2.0,I bought it..wore it twice before one of the crystal markers in the watch face came loose and it now floats around inside.
2.0,"Very thin, almost see through.  Cheap material."
2.0,I like the look of this band it worked fine for a while about a couple of weeks later the band just broke so I returned it and now I'm looking for a stronger more durable band
2.0,"I ordered this ring to wear on my left thumb. It won’t even go over my thumb nail! It is on my middle finger on the left hand. It’s tight so it will stay until it has to be cut off! So dissatisfied and disappointed! My ring finger is a 7.5 . This ring must be a 7, definitely not an 11 . If I could get it off I would return but it won’t come off . Bad choice!"
2.0,Cute but plasticky fabric
2.0,"I really wanted to like these pants. They did fit me well and looked good from afar, but the quality just was not there. The material felt cheap and seemed it would pull/catch/stain very easily, so I returned. I’m 5’10” and ~ 175 lbs. and the medium fit me well."
2.0,I thought this would be loose and ordered up...not exactly what I was looking for.  But good quality.  Wish I got next size.
2.0,"It Broke as Soon as I Slipped a Finger into the Ring part<br />My Hands are Quite tiny and Thin, there should have been No reason why it Would Break So Easily<br />But I will say the Metal Quality is okay"
2.0,Small but cute. After wearing it once the chain started to tarnish. Not great quality.
2.0,"This headband looks different from the picture, which really put me off. Not only that, it DOES NOT STAY ON! It literally falls off within a minute of putting it on. Very disappointed and will not be buying again....."
2.0,Cute shirt but not built for an American man! VERY PETITE man.
2.0,This sizes my foot 1/2 to 1 whole size too small!  I haven't tried it on my husband yet to cross reference.  How can I trust it for the kids' growing feet?  Has anyone else had this issue?
2.0,I plan on trying to seam rip out the “padding” but it is very clearly see through... also slightly shorter than I thought it would be. Honestly I’m a little all over disappointed
2.0,The ring became unattached in a short period of time. For the price I would have thought it would have lasted years.
2.0,"i love this dress, at first i was a little unsure about it but still decided to keep it. I love the fabric, the length was perfect for me and it wasn't to tight wich leaves room for growth from the sides 😄 i just feel very comfortable in it."
2.0,"I ordered these shorts in an XXL after reading comments about them being very small. They did not fit so I requested a refund. The company told me they would send me another pair in a bigger size for free. Today I received the XXXL the biggest size they have. I put both sizes together and they are exactly the same just a different tag. To waist is stretchy and isn't the problem, the problem is the cut. They will fit my waist no problem but the legs are way too small. For reference I wear between a 9 and 12 in jeans. For shorts normally a 12-14 because my butt and thighs are bigger than my waist. My 2 stars is because they tried to fix the problem."
2.0,"The fit was super weird on this costume. Ordered a small but you’d have to be 6’ tall to prevent it bunching you everywhere. The material is super thin and you can see right through. The straps and belt as separate, which didn’t seem to work very well. I returned this."
2.0,"the drees is beautiful, but it is really really small. I always wear a 12. I ordered XXL and coudn't even try it on!"
2.0,It does not look as nice as shown in the pictures
2.0,"I like that they are warm. However, they are very short on me, they stretch out really easily, and one is already unraveling."
2.0,I bought these because they were a good price but ya get what you pay for
2.0,I got the 30in gold chain. It met expectations but only managed to last three to four months of wear before there was significant discoloration. I was satisfied with this product all except for the claimed lifetime warranty and short wear-life. The warranty card you receive seems less than secure/valid. The shipping address given for the replacement warranty is not found through Google Maps.
2.0,"I wanted so bad to be able to wesr this, I loved the quality but.. it runs really really small. I had to return it."
2.0,It's isn't as red as I expected; more burgundy. And also very thin material.
2.0,The dress is nice.  I returned because it did not meet my standards.  Should have known for the price.
2.0,I ordered an XL so it would fit &#34;blousy&#34; and it was like an Extra Small!
2.0,"Very flimsy thin material, and fit was bad in all the wrong places.  The print is awesome, and we were bummed that it wasn't a better fit."
2.0,Belt lasted 2 months before it started falling apart.
2.0,I like the outfit but the material n fabric is thin. I wore for 1/2 hour n as soon as I took off the hooded there was the tare. I’m a little disappointed.
2.0,Larger than expected and finish is terrible. Tons of over spray and raised bumps all over charm. Clearly made as cheap as possible.
2.0,Poorly made. Wore the dress three times and washed. Seams started coming undone at sleeves.
2.0,This does NOT fit how they show it in the description. I had to use my jewelry tools to bend it to fit another way. You can tell that it doesn't for because they don't picture it on a real person.
2.0,"The way it's connected at the crotch makes no sense. It basically crosses at the worst possible spot (without being graphic), and that connection creates friction and rubbing. I'm not sure why they didn't just make it rap around the legs and not connect in the middle. They're sexy and cute, but not functional if you want to keep wearing them during."
2.0,"Bought this bag at the beginning of August, just about two months ago. Loved the shape and size of the bag. It was the perfect balance between casual and structure. Used it pretty much every day. That is, until the inner lining of the front of the bag unraveled and came undone. The bag is no more."
2.0,"initially i bought size 4 in pink according to the size description. i really love it but sadly it is too small. So i bought some other color in size 6, it fits me ok, but  the coats stink like  wet dog. I need to return."
2.0,Very poor packaging. 2 pair broken and 2 back magnets missing.
2.0,"I've been running on Salomons for years, but for some reason this style hurts my feet. The heel is a bit larger, so my heel slips. And the toebox rubs on one of the shoes. Not a win this time, Salomon."
2.0,"I love the colors for this suit, and for the price I was like what the heck why not! When I received it I could easily tell the top was too big for me, also didn't help that the straps were NOT adjustable, but the bottoms in size was fine. I am a size 32b/c and ordered a small. I could see this suit working for others though. I ended up returning this product and received a refund."
2.0,Just didn't look as nice in person. Returned 😔
2.0,"pattern is cute, but the color is lavender, not grey. Which i am not mad about, but they falsely advertise that its gray in the picture. just beware of colors."
2.0,"At first , seems decent quality, but after wearing - very evident the magnet is not the same as Apple's more expensive brand.  NOW - it came undone, fell off & cracked apple watch.  Not worth the hassle of cutting corners.  Just get a better band from the start."
2.0,"I use this product from when I'm working outside. Setting up was a breeze and only took about three seconds. My only problem is that this is a one-size-fits-all beanie. I sincerely feel for the average adult male that these beanies are way too small, so much so that mine actually gave me a headache within 15 minutes of wearing it. I'll guess I'll just have to pass it on to my youngest teenage daughter because they don't offer large or extra-large sizes:(<br /><br />Update: Wow, this thing didn't even fit my daughter!??! And she's maybe 5'4 @100 lbs!"
2.0,"This is made of acrylic, so it's itchy and will pill easily. It needs to be more form fitting, as the waist is too big (it doesn't taper at all)."
2.0,"This is an extremely cheaply made garment, with no  real buttons: they are sewn on and the top itself does not open."
2.0,The clasp broke as soon as I tried to put it on. Cheaply made and lighter weight than it seems from picture. Cute piece but not very good quality.
2.0,"The shirt fits fine, but the white is completely see through.  I’ll end up using this as pajamas or. Coverup at the beach/pool.  Maybe a different color would be better."
2.0,"I'm not really sure how this looks because I could barely get two legs in it. Im 5'2&#34;, 130lbs, ordered a medium. It barely fit my 13 yo daughter. Style is cute but sizing if WAY off. Returned"
2.0,I return the Life Stride because it was too big and not padded comfortably.
2.0,"Not the material expected, the material makes it look very cheap . It’s kind of misleading."
2.0,"Sizing was on the smaller size, colors are not as vivid as shown in pictures and material shrunk in cold water washing delicates and hung dry. Disappointed."
2.0,"they don't stay in place, slide down easily. the lace on top is uncomfortable"
2.0,Fit great except that I had way too much side boob happening. sent it back.
2.0,Don’t like the fabric. Loop around neck is way too long & will need to shorten/sew to raise up to make it usable & protect clothing. Long delay. Design is cute but that’s it.
2.0,I was looking forward to receiving these shirts with so many great reviews. Shirts were huge and nothing cute about them. Does not look anything like the picture.
2.0,This thing looks like something an old man wears fishing in person. Very stiff and weird.
2.0,"The arm holes are too large for me, too gaped but normally my thicker arms need that.  It was baggy at top but okay at bottom.  Didn’t fit as expected.  May be okay with a jacket on top of too big arm holes."
2.0,After very short period both screws that hold one of the lens got released. I tightened it but it got released again after a very short period. This happened several times until I decided to not use it anymore.
2.0,Not true to size cheaply made returned
2.0,"SHOuldve read the reviews here first, they run SO small. Returning!"
2.0,"Just got them from the courier (international shipping woes), pulled them out the box, attempted to take the back off to try them on, and the stem came off instead....guess that’s why they’re only 9.99...."
2.0,"Love Michael Kors, the shoes are goregous! However after two weeks of wearing them the stitching began to come apart around the ankle. My daughter wore them maybe a handful of times. I would expect more from the brand as I owe a number of his products and never experienced this before."
2.0,"I bought a travel jacket that was waterproof but didn't have a hood. I thought this Rain Scarf would be a good way to keep my head dry in a downpour. Unfortunately, it was way too big for me (I'm 5'1&#34;) and was too bulky to carry around in a purse. I returned it."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this shirt. I ordered a large after recommendations to size up. The large was a smidge too small so I then ordered an XL. The XL shirt was a completely different material, different stretchiness and was sized smaller than the L. So I guess this is just one of those items that’s hit or miss depending on who orders what size. If it were to fit it would have been a really good deal. Sigh."
2.0,"Looked really nice. However, it was SO TIGHT. I have a small face and there was no breathing room."
2.0,"Crappy item, wore out quickly"
2.0,The shirt pocket is sewn way off. It is more in the armpit area than chest.
2.0,"It was very tight, seems like it was intended for a child."
2.0,"These sandals would have been great except the strap that goes around the heel is too short.  It hits too low on my heel, lower than where my heel bends, if that makes sense.  It pulls at my heel when I walk.  Strange - I have never experienced this with any other sling-back sandals.  Otherwise, they were just what I was looking for in style and comfort.  Too bad the fit is weird and the heel strap is not adjustable."
2.0,Not very pleased with this purchase. Would not recommend. They seem to slip down on my legs. Not as supportive as other socks
2.0,"This blouse is beautiful. I love the fabric, u cannot see through it (I bought the beige).<br />I bought the small as I normally wear an extra small but read that it runs small. It is so tight on me I struggled to get it on and off. Once on, it looked great except the sleeves were the entire cuff length too long. Very disappointed! Will sadly have to return."
2.0,"Sleeves are long, and it fits snug through the hips. If you are wanting to wear it with leggings and hide the junk in your trunk, then forget it!"
2.0,Had to return the item. Size 12 slippers didn't fit length or width correctly.
2.0,This pendant is HUGE and looks really odd.
2.0,"Extremely small. Not sure of the size it says is correct... Bout this belt for my fianc&eacute; in his normal size, but it only buckles on the verge last hole..."
2.0,Don't really keep the smoke out
2.0,"I really wanted to love these Yoga Pants! I'm an average sized woman (size 10), on the tall side and I usually order large or sometimes XL for the length in pants. And in when wearing yoga pants, I love to have my ankles and feet covered as I'm usually running around on hardwood floors at home. I ordered the XL in these pants and was SO disappointed when they arrived. They were so tiny. They were long enough, but right out of the package, they looked as if they might fit a child. Super bummed."
2.0,"The rubber draw-loops slide off the earpieces quite easily.  I purchased these for my outside working glasses and, when the conditions are slightly humid or one begins to sweat, the straps slip off with little or no exertion.  The first touch to adjust or remove the eyewear, the strap is dangling by one side or gone entirely."
2.0,I like the color. The shirt itself stretches out and the v neck hangs low. Definitely looks better in the picture
2.0,So cute on model but I returned because not cute on.
2.0,"This is the cutest swim suit but it completely leaves your butt cheeks out!!!! I was so sad, I wanted to love it but there was no way."
2.0,"I needed a new tragus earring and these were advertised as such. The earrings are cute but the stem is way too long to fit the space for a tragus piercing. The size is just right for my earlobes but I didn't like the look for my lobes, so I'll be returning. Fyi the measurements are listed in the description, so that was my fault for not reading the entire listing. Still, these should not be advertised as a tragus earrings when they are so big."
2.0,"Did not fit, so I can't say much about it."
2.0,5 stars for being super cute. But only 2 stars because I couldn’t even cut through 2 pieces of gauze with these scissors. Get them for decor because they are non functional in the nursing profession.
2.0,"Suit fits very small lengthwise! I am normally a medium- I read all of the reviews and decided to order a LARGE instead of a medium- should've ordered an XL. im a 34C and 5'6, I weigh around 145-150lb."
2.0,"The side wall of the shoe was not sewn down, when I put my foot in it, the side wall fabric would first catch my toe, then second “roll” or bunch as I slid my foot in. The roll/bunched fabric is not comfortable as it digs into the side of your foot when you make a step.<br /><br />Designer: Never should there be fabric in a shoe that can catch toes. If it were layered the opposite direction then a foot would not cause friction to “push back” the fabric causing it to bunch. You sewed fabric into the shoe and left an open end. Very poor design."
2.0,way too small so I sent it back yesterday
2.0,"Not very comfy fit. I've ordered several Marie Jo Avero bras in the past and wanted something less pricey. Color is pretty/price reasonable but there's an awful lot of stiff wire. Not a bra I'd want to wear all day, so I'd rather spend the money for comfort. Disappointed."
2.0,"Liked that it was lightweight, easy to breathe through;  disliked the fit, was hard to keep aligned and was loose for a thinner face"
2.0,"Ring is as pictured and appears far sturdier than I was expecting for the price.  I purchased the rose gold and it matches my other rose gold jewelry nicely.<br /><br />Update February 2017:  I like the ring itself as far as style, fit, comfort, etc. but the plating has pretty much worn off in the couple months I've had it.  At this point, I have a copper ring which isn't what I wanted."
2.0,Very cheap product. The screen protector does not lay against the screen like some other brands do. As well you can not hear on the other end of the phone through the case. You can’t use a aux cable because it does not fit.
2.0,"Unfortunately the sizing is way off for USA. Once received you can easily tell this is a product made in Asia  for what some would say is sizing for th a t country, which normally runs much smaller. The large fits more like a small and the extra large/2x size is closer to a USA womens 12/14."
2.0,"Very cool piece,  but breaks easily."
2.0,Loins very cheaply made and its quite bulky as well
2.0,It doesn't cover the whole bra cup!!
2.0,"The earrings I received are cute, but they don't look like what I ordered, they appear to be the wrong earrings, some parts are the same but they are not the ones ordered.  I am not very happy with them."
2.0,Zipper seam busted when my daughter first tried it on.
2.0,"Very cool watch, but no instructions.  Finally figured it out, but could not figure out how to get it working again when closed.  Need some info here!"
2.0,They’re cute but really don’t take the glare alway really was a waste of money
2.0,Poorly made. The zipper broke the first time I wore it!
2.0,It doesn’t lay on you as nicely as it does in the photo
2.0,This runs extremely small.  I wear a size 8 US women's.  The x-large was still too small.
2.0,"So pretty, I like the fabric, but defiantly not made for girls with big breast. The top is so tight I couldn't even get it over my D sized boobs."
2.0,it was made out of cheap cloth and the seams were sown crooked did not wear it  its in the closet :(
2.0,"I was hoping to add color to my smart watch; however, this band does not stay attached to the watch. Not a happy camper."
2.0,The dress wasntoobbig and it arrives late so I was unable to wear it to the wedding.
2.0,"The masks that I received came in a green and white box labeled Eaaglo KN95. The masks also have KN95 imprinted in the mask material itself, but I am unable to confirm whether these are truly KN95s or common knockoffs. These masks are a bit too tall for my face, leaving a gap between the mask and the underside of my chin, and they are a bit too small for my husband to wear comfortably. The material inside is soft and non-irritating, the nose clip is sturdy and moldable, and the ear loops are longer than average and securely attached so if you can get a good seal to your face this might be a better choice than a loose-fitting pleated mask, but I prefer to stick with KN95 or KF94 masks from trusted brands and sources so I can be confident in their filtration efficiency."
2.0,The hood is small
2.0,"I like the long wrists and the snug knit, but I am not convinced they are anything other than acrylic.<br />They are not particularly warm, and lack the legal import fabric content tag required by the FTC.<br />I did the natural fiber content burn test on part of a seam -- real animal fiber will smell like burning hair and turn to powder ash.<br />Synthetics will melt and smell chemical. This melted.<br />At most, they are a very very very low percentage of alpaca blended with acrylic to justify calling it alpaca.<br />Don't expect too much."
2.0,"Material is pretty thick for someone living in the tropics...will see how it fits, looks larger than usual"
2.0,"although i bought another two from the same vendor, this one didn't fit as expected and advertised as the same size."
2.0,Material is incredibly thin - looks terrible on me because I’m a bit boney
2.0,The gray suit is White and steal blue! Some of the close up pictures depict the color better.
2.0,The bag itself look durable but strap looks cheap .
2.0,Too bad he died before their  purchase could be justified.
2.0,"The fit is good, but it looks cheap."
2.0,"Yes, it is a nice scarf but I returned it because there were two holes!"
2.0,After reading the reviews I ordered a large and they run very small.
2.0,"Cute dress if you're tiny. I have a long torso, bust line of the dress cuts across the bottom half of my bra, does not sit at waist like pictured."
2.0,These are pretty gloves that feel great (deerskin) but they are NOT warm. In 40 degrees they will leave your haands freezing. For warmth I will stick to my leather gloves lined with shearling.
2.0,Only open half way down..<br />NOT ALL THE WAY AS ADVERTISED.  Still too difficulto put on 2yo. Returned and bought a cheap pair of knit ones instead and these work fine for this year.
2.0,"I really like the look and feel of this shirt. Seems to be of better than expected quality for the price. However, the sizing is inaccurate. I ordered a 2xl and the fit would have been small for an XL. I really wish sizing was accurate."
2.0,It's really short
2.0,"Ok let me start buy saying that I had boughten an apron by them a few years back, LOVED IT. Im a full time groomer who works at 2 shops so I got 2 of these, this one and a silver one. First off the black desige is velvet, hair sticks to it. And after wearing the silver one 4 days a week for about a month the velvet is comming off in places. The purple one has pockets , the silver one dose not. The ruffel material isnt the same on both aprons, the purple one collects hair like crazy! The inside of the strap on my purple one is sharp and i find it so irritating on my skin i stopped whereing it last week, (and i only where that one 2 days a week). Im extremely disappointed. I wonder if the desiger knows anything about grooming dogs, because of how much hair gets stuck to these things! I still gave them 2 stars but thats only cuz i think there cute, I would not purchase these again."
2.0,doesn't stay clipped
2.0,Very low quality for the price
2.0,"5 weeks to arrive and wrong color...nice lightweight summer shorts but.......never again!<br />Order the pair shown, and received a dark green and black instead.<br />Belt loops tore...seams started to split...thrown away by December"
2.0,Average; nothing special.
2.0,"Disappointed - thought I was buying a pair, not a single earring.  I may return this."
2.0,Size information indicated these were to fit men's (10 -12). I wear a size 11 shoe and the Sox were very small.  I could not wear them without quite a struggle and great discomfort.
2.0,Hard to get on. Were not east on
2.0,"This bra really flattens you out, it is small to begin with & the extender doesn't do much. They are Asian sizes so I went up a size and ordered a 40C, when I usually wear a 38C & it was still small. To be honest I am not sure the biggest size would have worked, the cups are on the small side! Not for big boobs or women with broad band widths. Might work better for smaller petite women, but honestly do yourself a favor and order this bra: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072F9SKN8/ref=nav_timeline_asin?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1"
2.0,"Unfortunately, this satin chemise did not arrive as pictured. I ordered the light pink one that showed a contrasting trim in ivory. What arrived was a light pink satin chemise with pink trim. The trim felt awfully cheap and rough against the skin. Besides that, I wanted the contrast in the trim as pictured so I had to return this product."
2.0,"Unhappy with this, save your money and buy a better pair!"
2.0,Real cheap looking.
2.0,I normally fit into bathing suits quite well. The top has too much fabric and is made for double D's while the bottoms are made for a size 0. I ordered a medium.
2.0,Fits very awkwardly. I ignored reviews because it was cheap and I have a short torso so I thought it'd be fine but I honestly am not comfortable wearing it.
2.0,"I loved the colors and patterns, however each cap was very small and fit more like a tight beanie"
2.0,To short..Not all bears
2.0,"I really wanted to like this sweatshirt, but was worried after the first wash when I was seeing loose threads in ALL of the seams.  The fabric is nice and medium weight, plenty warm and durable but the seams!  A week after the return window closed I pulled it out of the washing machine (probably been 4 washes now) and noticed that the entire underarm seam on one side has completely separated."
2.0,Purchased 2 and 1 did not work and had trouble returning it. Amazon kept directing me to return to kohl's which is not convenient. So now I have 1 good and 1 for the trash. Not worth paying double.
2.0,Ordered a large. Top fit like a medium. Returned it for an XL. Top fit even smaller. Could have been a nice dress but I'm not trying again. So much wasted time.
2.0,I love the IN BLUE selection. Inexpensive and not bad quality. I have been waiting a few weeks now. Product delivery date keeps getting extended.
2.0,"Pretty watch but had to return because I couldn't remove any links, which I do myself I have the tool, they were so tight I broke one of my tools. It costs $5 per link to remove n I have to take out 5-6 links. Watch not worth it."
2.0,After only three or four washes the stitching is coming out of the sleeves on the gray shirt. Great fitting shirt but poor quality on the stitching.
2.0,"It broke 2 days after the return window is closed, during normal wear."
2.0,Es muy grande no parece talla 6
2.0,"Love the idea. But...right out of the box one clip was already broken. Less than 24 hrs later, another has broken. No way the purse weighed anywhere near 8 lbs. Which the clip is said can hold.  Returning it would cost me almost as much as the purchase price..what to do?"
2.0,The idea of these earrings is golden but they are too soft and bendable in my opinion. One wrong move and that’s the end of these earrings.
2.0,This sleeve fits the device and the cord and the flap stays shut. It’s not bad quality at all except the smell.<br />The smell is so strong that i am returning it. It smells like awful chemicals. It’s actually nauseating. Not the sellers fault. Really just a manufacturing default. I really don’t recommend this for anyone. The smells really just so bad!
2.0,The inside of one of the balls disintegrated after a few weeks so the ball would not screw on properly
2.0,I bought for waist training but just as the other reviews say this is NOT for wait straining. It's cute but will not work for the purpose that I bought it for. Sticking to latex corsets is what I plan to do.
2.0,Poor quality. Returned back to KingSize.
2.0,"Not 4 sensitive skin. These masks will take your skin off if not careful or leave a rash. The “filter” in the mask is the same liner that is removed to expose the adhesive that keeps the mask on your face. If you leave “filter” on its hard to breathe. If you take the filter off, it leaves just the thin fabric sticking to your face and nose."
2.0,"Not for me  they are very thin and not nearly as soft as others.  I think the material will pick too.<br />I returned both pairs, maybe good for under dresses for young person who is thinner."
2.0,Larger than expected. Not my favorite. Kinda cute
2.0,"Seriously no coverage of your ass at all. If your'e into that look good bikini, just not for me."
2.0,"I ordered this for my husband to wear to the concert. It arrived on time, however, I received a medium instead of an XL. Too late for me to return it and get the right one. VERY UPSET about this"
2.0,They will roll down during exercise
2.0,"Poor quality and really short.  If you have a small torso, it’s for you."
2.0,"I did not react to this metal, so that was a plus.  That said, it was not what I was expecting as far as the color goes. It appears silver, but in person it is almost like a gunmetal finish - basically it looked tarnished and I just can’t see myself wearing it since it already looks so worn."
2.0,cute dress but I got a small and if was like a large way to big on the top and I can be either small or medium 5 3' 130 pounds<br />not impressed
2.0,"I really like these socks.  I have at least 5 pair but I am disappointed in that they all wear out in the heal fairly quickly.  I haven't had the socks more than 6 months and they all have holes in the heals.  I wear these socks all the time because they give nice support to my legs and allow me to be active without my legs aching.  Maybe all compression socks ware out quickly. I don't have others to compare to. If anyone at the company reads these, I would love it if they can make the bottom of the socks thicker or more durable, especially under the heal."
2.0,They are pretty rough on my feet.  I'm not sure the sandles are responding well to the impulses as I have the unit as high as it goes before I feel much of any thing
2.0,Already turningy wrist green as it states its silver and it does not change color or cause any allergy. Other then that its cute and simple to wear as costume jewelry on occasion and the price is decent!
2.0,Started sticking within under an hour of light use.
2.0,Only gave two stars because the rhinestones make them look cheap. Also the backs fit a little loose. Otherwise cute.
2.0,the fabric is really thin and cheap. more importantly it feels like sand paper.  don't waste your time and money! sent them back.  really small too.  bummer because it could be a nice style but the fabrication is so poor that it's a bust!
2.0,"I’m a little disappointed that one of the skull beads was upside down... otherwise, packaging is lovely and quality feels pretty nice."
2.0,"I had a completely different look and feel in mind. I thought the purse looked cheaply made and felt cheaply made once it arrived. Nothing like it's picture at all. The color was off and it was extremely flexible. It wouldn't stand up at all, not even with my wallet and accessories inside. I returned the purse for a refund (which was extremely easy, NO issues at all there). I think it boils down to personal taste. Some people might find this purse appealing, but it just simply wasn't for me."
2.0,Just once I'd love the top to look like the picture. I think I've learned my lesson
2.0,Looks cheap.  Poor quality.  You get what you pay for.
2.0,"As other reviewers noted, the straps are HUGE. No padding or support. I'm a pretty large person, and these were too baggy to look cute layered or to wear as bras. Arrived late. Only perk is that I was for some reason sent 3?"
2.0,"Besides the fact that the sweater fell on the small side (about a size or 2 smaller) the orange color (on the sweater that also had black & white stripes) is SUPER bright. Almost florescent. Think, deer hunter. So, outside of possibly wearing this on Halloween (or again, whilst in the woods, hunting) I don't see myself getting much wear out of it."
2.0,See thru and cheap material. Very tight!
2.0,"Fabric is clingy and shows everything. Way to long for 5'2"". Army green color was nice and shipping was really fast but I'm returning this one."
2.0,They dod not fit me very well and they kept falling off my feet.
2.0,"Size runs pretty small. It's very tight and not soft, kind of itchy. Meh. Still looking for the perfect cardigan, and this isn't it."
2.0,Flimsy not a real corset it's for dress up only if looking for the real deal don't bother. Sad I waisted money on it!
2.0,The blouse came quickly and was cute even though I didn't care much for the fabric it still looked good. I wear a size 8 and sometimes a large in tops. I ordered an extra large and I swear it's made for tweens. Very Disappointed .
2.0,"Top was way too small, the bottoms were the XL that it said it would be and the top was only a large, that was annoying because I bought the biggest size for the top to fit. I haven't worn it once."
2.0,They are see-through they rip easily and don’t protect your arm from the sun or anything
2.0,"The stones are too small for you to be able to tell what this is trying to say, which was sort of the point, right?"
2.0,"This was a Christmas gift for a friend. The concept is great but in reality it was pretty beat-up. The box itself was already smashed and torn and the candle that came with it was completely broken, I had to throw that away which was sad because it smelled so nice.<br />I feel like this would've been great had the box and its contents were in perfect condition."
2.0,Starred unraveling within.a week. Poor quality product.
2.0,The opening on these don’t stretch enough to easily accommodate and attach to the ends of most sun glasses.
2.0,it was not very bright or very reliable.
2.0,"Eh, cute but doesn't fit in any way. Even if I unwrap one. Doesn't work for me"
2.0,"This shirt looks good fits well. At first. But after I washed it; it had a ton of tiny balls, fuzz, or pilling. This would not come off in the dryer or with a lint roller. The fabric is just not great in that it does this. If it weren’t for this it would be 5 stars."
2.0,"Very cheap.  Stones had fallen out and I had to glue them in.  However, what can you expect got the price?  I got it to use as a decoration for a Titanic party.  If you want to wear it, don't bother."
2.0,Color was not as bright as photo. Did not come with a belt as shown in photo. Proportion between the collar and armhole is  a little off.  My daughter felt uncomfortable. Under skirt was to the knee and not floor length as shown in the photo
2.0,"These are cute, no doubt.  Very thin, flimsy material. Very small, would probably NOT fit most men or women, but maybe children.  Makes a funny gift for a fan, but no other practical use."
2.0,wrist is so small on the bracelet and I don't have a large one but pretty
2.0,"Doesn't create a good enough seal around the eyes, air drafts to the eyes are very disturbing while driving (a moped at around 35mph)."
2.0,"I love the way it looks. It’s exactly what I expected from the description.<br />However, it is cheaply made and broke two days after I received it. 😭<br />Sadly, I can’t seem to fix it; It’s too worthless to take to a jeweler."
2.0,I like the color and the vibe of the shirt however I think product was rushed.y shirt had several stains and marks from imaging.
2.0,I was disappointed when I saw the zippers. They’re too small for the box’s size and intended use. I will have to very carefully slide the zipper every time.<br /><br />The supplier advertised that they’re appropriate for delivering food. 🙁
2.0,"The sweater looks great, but I wore it twice and it looks like I’ve had it for a while. It has fabric balls where my purse lies and on underside of both arms. Disappointed it this product."
2.0,Didn’t like the gold disc for the top attachment
2.0,Not as described . Not flattering
2.0,"Not even close to what I was expecting. This was basically a shirt, not a dress. I returned it. The cut I found to be unflattering. I ordered a similar style from another seller and that one is great. Two stars given because the size was good, the material was soft and the color black was nice. Cons are that its too short and unflattering"
2.0,No sirve se corta el huele muy facil
2.0,Okay these were the cutest thing everrrr when i put them on but then when you pay more attention to the whisker design... yeah needless to say blood and pain ensued 🥴 but for sure super cute and regular silver ones don't give me any sort of allergic reactions so theres that!!
2.0,"The sleeves attach to the shirt much too low, resulting in you being unable to raise your arms to the sides without awkwardly stretching the bodice. Otherwise cute though, although the white panels on the chest are unflattering and should be removed."
2.0,"You might want to size up on this one. This is an XL which is what I usually wear. The pants fit fine but the shirt is too small and tight around the arms. It is so uncomfortably tight. Only if I could choose the sizes separately, XL pants XXL shirt. Really cute on. Just wish it was as cute as it is in the picture. It's like I received a cheaper version. Love the textured color though."
2.0,"Fits great I did my body measurement and it said get a XXL and it fits awesome! I'm 5,0 210Lb and love the flow of the shirt! Also downfall of this tho is once you wash it shrinks like crazy! I can no longer wear it!"
2.0,Nice wallet but zipper wore out after a month
2.0,It is definatly not as big as it looks. She must be a small girl. My Samsung 7 Edge will not fit in that front pocket. I was so surprised that it was so small. It's ok but I'm pretty disappointed. I was going to get a wallet but I'm going to look someplace else. The only thing accurate is the strap. Booooo!
2.0,"I got these to wear at my wedding and found out when they arrived, they are really unattractive when you wear them.  They were not as comfortable as I was hoping either."
2.0,Size isn’t even close to accurate. Order at least a size bigger possibly 2 sizes
2.0,Clasp broke within the first week.
2.0,it didn't stay clasped. cute but doesn't operate properly
2.0,Not flattering. Very bulky.
2.0,zipper broke the first time I used it.
2.0,"I'm 5'11&#34; and 155lbs and athletic. These fit pretty well actually. They showed through very slightly for particular undergarments but not bad even when I bent over. I would have accepted this but in the few minutes of trying them on, the seam in the crotch started to come undone. So they would work for someone my size but the quality was just too poor."
2.0,"Way too small for an adult, can't use it."
2.0,This did not fit my husband comfortably.
2.0,The font I requested was not used and the bracelet broke on the 2nd day of use.  It looked really sturdy and well  made so it gets 2 stars for that.
2.0,These are not for working out if you have boobs.  No support.  They look like they have built in bra's but they don't.
2.0,The skirt was nice but it ran too small. Seems as if I needed to size up by2.  RETURNED
2.0,the chain cut before I could even wear it so it's disappointing
2.0,The beads started falling off when i wore it. very bad
2.0,"These socks were very soft and comfortable and didn't squeeze my calves much at all.  I love the fabric, but unfortunately after just one day of light walking there were holes in both big toes.  Very disappointing because they were just what I was looking for.<br />(Note I have very short toe nails and this hasn't been a problem with other socks I own.)"
2.0,Fit very small.  Returned
2.0,I was of the opinion the top was one solid piece but the bra section is separated somewhat from the main section.  I did not like that.
2.0,"Listing and product image indicates lining is grey but it is bright white and very obvious. I had planned on removing the lining anyway for a costume, but it would not be wearable for anyone as is. If all you want is gathered tulle skirt and are up for doing the work to make it look nice go for it otherwise save your money."
2.0,"I think the size 6 is more a size 4 or 5. Also, the quality is poor. Tons of loose strings from the material, even  the white shirt. You get what you paid for."
2.0,returned as they had more of a wedge heel than I expected and was a little too small
2.0,I bought this for my son.  The collar strecthed out so much it started to look like an off-the shoulder top. He only had it on for a couple of hours. It looked ridiculous and he had to take it off. He wont be able to wear again.
2.0,"Well, I'm a size small in this brand and own several of the strapless dresses. I like them. This one is NOT the strap equivalent - first of all, the ruched bodice is much shorter. Secondly, ONLY the back strap is adjustable - totally silly! The armholes aren't, so it was way too short for my frame. Unless your female lumps are sticking out of your clavicle, I'm not sure how this will work."
2.0,"The ties looked fair - the emblems were tarnished and the ""leather"" strings were thinner than I expected.  But they were inexpensive and the Prime shipping was fast."
2.0,"Had not problem with comfort, I actually forgot they were there.  I think the loop is great as I have heard people not liking the standard one that clips to your socks. worked great for a week, then the clasps stopped staying shut.  The worst part is the when it fails to maintain the hold now you have the most uncomfortable clasp swinging by your knee.<br /><br />Need a much more durable clasp for attaching to your shirt."
2.0,These pieces were beautiful and went well with my wedding gown. It turned my neck green before my wedding was over. I had to keep it on because my neck was discolored. I was able to return it. Sad I couldn't keep it to wear again.
2.0,The sizing runs very small!! I was very disappointed with this product simply because I ordered the same exact pair or shorts in a blue & they fit perfectly!!
2.0,Looks better in pictures. U get what u pay for. Looks very cheap feels cheap.
2.0,The women's large is more like a medium.  I had to return it to get a women's extra large.  Buyer beware.....
2.0,"I tried this on at a store in town and loved the fabric and quality, but this does not have the same drape and feel of that one.  I've put it on twice and took it off. Not sure I will really wear it, I had removed the tags so cannot return it, otherwise I would return it."
2.0,the fabric is very stiff. I don't like it.
2.0,Only stuck on me once. I tried everything to get it to stick again.
2.0,"The picture was nice but the material was too thick and stiff and very boxy,  more so made for a man or unisex."
2.0,I dislike the feeling of this shirt.. I was expecting more of a cotton feel.
2.0,I ordered a 8-9 for my daughter that wears a 7 and it’s sooo tight. Super bummed.
2.0,"Very cute, but too small"
2.0,"Use the size chart to find your size.  I returned this dress because it is a shiny material.  You can't see it in the photos, but you can definitely see the sheen. I am also not a fan of any fabric that turns white when pulled /stretched.  You can hardly tell those are dinosaurs because the contrast is not enough.  Want to like it but had to return it."
2.0,Not terrible but it's see through.
2.0,"I know you can’t get these anymore as they are discontinued. Perfect fit bit the inside coating began to bubble and peel, making blurred vision. Guess I’m headed back to Oakley!"
2.0,"Should have trusted the other reviews. Idk what I'm going to do with this bag. Probably won't return it,  but I probably won't use it. It's way too big and cheap looking."
2.0,These bras are nice to look at but they have a nipple formed in the front so when you use a thin blouse you can see is image.
2.0,"Runs very small. There’s little pads in the lining that shift and move as you’re putting them on, and it’s nearly impossible to get them back into the correct position once it’s on. Not the best purchase I’ve made on amazon, that’s for sure. It *was* shipped quickly and I received them in a speedy timeframe, which was nice. I just wished they fit true to size."
2.0,It came with two of the stones out i had to crazy glue them back in. seems to be poorly made.
2.0,"I thought that maybe it'd look good, but I got fooled by how it fits the model! It's awkward and does not work well on a woman with curves. Material is fine, thin yet sturdy and cool."
2.0,"Loved the colors. I ordered several of the colors and they were just as pictured on here, but the fit was not great for me. I looked like an old lady in this - had to return them all."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this sweatshirt, but it was such an odd fit.  I normally wear a small and decided to get a medium.  The fit was huge on the bottom and fitted at the top which made me look like a triangle.  I think the only way it looks good is if you are standing like the model in the picture.  I really wish it would have fit as it is super cute."
2.0,This looks nothing like in the picture. Cheaply made. I have a busy schedule so it's difficult for me to go return things so I just wear it around the house to do housework in. Wouldn't be caught wearing it outside.
2.0,It felt cheap.  Didn’t work for me.
2.0,"Great leggings for under a tunic, but not really workout leggings. They are very soft, but not supportive at all.<br />Also, I got two black and one turquoise; no blue, like the order I placed. :("
2.0,"Looks great, sizing seems perfect but it almost fits a little too well. Whenever I wear the ring for more than a day or so, the skin under the ring doesn't get to breath and I develop a rash."
2.0,The fabric of the dress was really thin and the cuts on the side came up much higher than pictured.  I would only wear it as a cover-up.
2.0,Not as pretty as it appears in the pic. More of a ‘Halloween” look than it appears in the photo. Returned.
2.0,This is a silky material but HUGE ! I usually buy a medium I’m busty but this thing fits my daughter who is 5-7” and 250lbs.
2.0,BEAUTIFUL BUT TURNING GREEN
2.0,Nice soft material.. fits well... Not red. I ordered red for a family picture and this is not red
2.0,"Too thin, but goes with every outfit"
2.0,"Very thin material ,seams not totally sewn together.poor finishing job on seams and hems.Wont buy again!!😔"
2.0,The fabric is polyester I don’t like how it looks to tight
2.0,The ring  lost the stone in the first week :(
2.0,"They were falling apart, the pins fall out and the colors fade"
2.0,The top material is shinny and skinny. Disappointed that due to the lack of material on top they are not as comfortable nor as attractive as I expected.
2.0,Super &#34;lightweight&#34; to the point of feeling just cheaply made.  I have liked James Fiallo socks in the past but am not impressed with these ones.
2.0,"I bought this for $7. Normally I would find it easier to just keep it for that amount. But it was so bad, I wanted my $7 back. I’m tall, maybe that was the problem, but when you try on a swimsuit and you can’t help but laugh. That means, no. Just no."
2.0,Plastic necklace is too short for my taste.  More like a choker than and I have an average sized neck. I would change it bit its made such that the pendant cannot be removed.
2.0,It's very annoying.
2.0,Fell apart immediately and had to be glued back together.
2.0,"Very flimsy set, I ordered a size 6, it looks very small.  It's a Christmas gift so I can't even have the recipient try it on.  I would not order this again, very cheap looking."
2.0,See through. Small bust. The material is so stiff I’m afraid to wash.
2.0,Visual image does not match the quality of the actual item. Very disappointed! I thought I could remove some of the tacky embellishments and it would look better. Wish I had just returned it...
2.0,very tiny more for a baby but are cute.
2.0,"They are a lot smaller than expected and they got here WAY latter than originally said. We got them for a cruise we were going on and they didn’t come in till we got back from the cruise. When trying to return them, it wasn’t worth it due to the amount they were gonna keep."
2.0,Great idea but they roll up during the day. During a meeting I walked out and it moved all the way to my waist. I'm a size 6.
2.0,It comes as a set of 2. Unfortunately the rose gold one broke the first day I wore it. I've worn the silver one 3 times now and it still seems good.
2.0,"The ring was nice, but not what I expected.  It was a little, no, a lot too bulky.  I can feel it on my finger at all times.  The size of the ring was wrong so I tried to wear it on my middle finger.  It was not confortable at all.  I did not send it back because it would have cost me the same as the ring cost when I ordered it.  I would have come out giving money away. So it is just sitting in my dresser drawer maybe to become a gift to someone who might appreciate it more than me."
2.0,"These gloves are just basic white cotton gloves.  They tend to fray very quickly and no longer look sharp after just a few hours of use.  Not high quality.  Fine for a costume, not so great if you intend to use them for a longer period."
2.0,It said it is 925 but the bracelet is not sterling silver but I like the bracelet it's pretty
2.0,"worse thing ever, very, very disappointed. too short, too tight, cheap looking. only able to wear in the house."
2.0,The quality of the material was nothing like the picture.
2.0,"Arrived with a few bears off their chain and the chain itself is a little short, but other than that it's cute."
2.0,Super sad that a 4XL doesn't fit a size 24.
2.0,"I have about 10 pairs of compression socks, and I never wash them in the wash machine, hand wash only and hang dry. This is the only pair that has failed. large holes developed on both socks, around the ankle area. Less than a year old, and not sure when I started wearing them, maybe 6 months ago. I guess you only get what you pay for, as they were the least expensive socks I purchased."
2.0,"Quality and material are great. Unfortunately, it does not stay put and slides off. The front is not long or wide enough to cover the front of the shoe if it is pulled back to the shoelace hitch."
2.0,Nice belt while it lasted. Belt keeps pulling off buckle after short amount of time.
2.0,Stitching became unraveled and ripped only after one use. Poor quality
2.0,"The dress fit exactly how i wanted form fitting but lose. I am 5'4"" 38D size 10/12 normally and I ordered a Large. The issue was it was so thin i can only use it as a bathing suit cover up. Even a nude bra was noticeable and no underwear options work and too see through to go commando."
2.0,"Bought this for my buddy, they were too big for her dwarf feet."
2.0,"This dress is ok for work/summer but I will have to send it back as it only fits on the bottom of my body. I'm a 36DD, so ladies like me with larger chests, beware."
2.0,I like the shirt but it is a bit to short in the torso making it quite low cut
2.0,"I liked this dress in the photos but when I received it I did not like the stretchy fabric or the see through waist band. If it would have been a different fabric I would have liked it much better. Also, the decorative waistband should have backing behind it so you don't see skin. I wanted it for a party dress but the fabric is not very classy."
2.0,Been trying to find green earrings I like but so far no luck. I like the color of these but hoop too big and thickness of material too thick for me. I am sure they would look nice on some ladies but not fit my preference.
2.0,Not what I expected.  To loose and floppy.
2.0,"--Feel free to ask me any questions about my review!--<br /><br />This is so small that I had to return it. The quality is really nice so I'm bummed that I had to send it back but it doesn't fit at all. I saw it ran small so I ordered a size up and it's still not comfortable to wear. The material is so stiff, has no give, and it also has very little shape; I'm a curvy girl so that isn't flattering on me.<br /><br />For reference, my usual size is a small; sometimes, in skirts, I'll order a medium. I wear a 4/6 in jeans. I'm 5'6"" and 145 pounds. In this skirt, I ordered a large. It's still too small.<br /><br />--Follow @CassandraMercedes for more Amazing Amazon finds!--"
2.0,Cheap material.  Too sheer can see through it
2.0,It has puffy shoulders that I didn't notice in the picture.
2.0,Definitely way too small.
2.0,Disappointed with the quality and sizing.
2.0,"Not happy to have received only 83 pieces, false advertisement claiming to have 102 pieces"
2.0,The strap came off after a year of normal use.  Still looks like new other than that. The quality did not seem to be on par with Coach.
2.0,"After 1 wear and 1 wash this is what happened. The dress is cute and light weight, but you don’t expect this to happen after 1 time use."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:9b574e3c9c7af63426be65cf1af0ecf6]] I got this dress in a size small, well it doesn't fit on the top at all on me and I'm a perfect size small. It is completely loose in the armpit area. I'm a b cup. I gave the dress to my friend who is a d cup and it fit her perfectly, she is also curvier than me and sometimes is a medium in size. I just don't see how this is a size small? I gave it two stars instead of one because the material is nice and the dress is cute. If you have the breasts to fill out the top I would go for it but if you are small chested I would stay away."
2.0,". Chain is to short . Necklace is hanging on my throat, and this is not right. Contacted Seller. Can/will do nothing about it.<br />  I need a chain which will fit in the holes on the gems, but where????"
2.0,poor appearence looks like something that came from a 5 and 10 cents store
2.0,Runs way smaller than what is labeled. Item returned.
2.0,Well we ordered the dress and needed it like 3 days later and it came on the day we needed it and it was not the right dress it was cute and fit but we had no time to get it fixed so we wore it I just wanted to make the review letting people no
2.0,I'm pretty sure I was sent the wrong size but there wasn't a lable so I'm not sure. Ordered the wine color and it was for sure a bright burgandy. Wrinkles really easy too.
2.0,I thought the fit would be looser across the chest.  I will  probably donate it. Maybe someone else can use it.
2.0,"It was good quality, the width size was ok but way too short for my torso, I’m 5 7"
2.0,"I followed the advice of other reviewers and ordered a size larger than usual (XXL). That was a good call and the shirt fits my torso well enough. However, the sleeves are about 2 inches too short, and I also expected something closer to a tunic length, which it definitely is not."
2.0,"Was so excited to get this. When i opened the box to put it on my watch, one of the leather straps was missing 😞"
2.0,"Top portion too small, arms and chest."
2.0,Nice jacket but I ordered a 4x and it might fit a child.
2.0,"I wanted to like this sweater so much but it just didn't fit right. The color was great and the weight of the sweater was perfect for a light breezy day, but when I put it on, I was swimming in it. Sadly, I had to return it."
2.0,"I didn't expect just a peace of plastic. Maybe, by mistake I bought it, thinking it had lights and did something different, but after all it's just a dull piece of plastic, paid for in gold. I was very disappointed."
2.0,I bought this topper to wear to a wedding. When I received it I was really disappointed. In the picture it looks like it is loose fitting and it drapes. When I put it on it was like a sausage skin on me. The model in the picture must be wearing a top that is two sizes larger than her real size.  It is going back. Too bad!
2.0,"I should have ordered a size up, it didn't fit at all! It's a shane because they are so cute. A little thin, but it could be the size"
2.0,This is a chain and not a choker cute but very disappointed
2.0,seems like a plastic bracelet.  small and tight.  I was disappointed.
2.0,"Underwires came out after a few washes. Cared for with mesh bag and never put in dryer. They're soft and fit well. But, they don't last."
2.0,Not impressed. Co Stanton had to mess with it to fix it to stay in place. Cute design but I wouldn't purchase one again.
2.0,"Very pretty jewelry, but the quality is poor. The posts on both earrings bent terribly just when I was trying to put the backs on for the first time, and I fully expect the posts to break off entirely."
2.0,Satin ribbon wasn't attached and it is huge.
2.0,Chinese/US sizes: they send extender hooks and eyes which are a pain in the butt. Will not order again.
2.0,Way to small!!!
2.0,"This shirt is very thick and in the heat  and sun it becomes stifling, even with a breeze it's been put away for winter use only."
2.0,"The jacket was made of good quality material, and the design looks really cute. But the hood did not cover my child's head. So I had to return it. I bought the [[ASIN:B0195EW8BK Carter's Baby Girls Printed Jersey Lined Rain Slicker, Red, 24 Months]], and it's perfect."
2.0,"Not great. He image is deceiving. It looks like a shine on the glass, but in reality, you get sent an item with the picture of the shine on the glass, then outninder the glass, so it’s not that great looking in person. Kind of like when you make a copy of a copy and then it gets wet and blurry, but another copy is made again"
2.0,"The watchface and leather strap colors go very nicely together, but the watch feels poorly made. The time adjustment dial is located so low on the face that it digs into your wrist constantly."
2.0,"I ordered a size bigger than I normally wear, just to make sure they would fit, even if they were a little big. I wear a 9, I ordered a 10 and they were so small, I had to give them to my daughter who wears a 7! The sizing is so far off, I won't try to re order. They look good, but without trying them on first, I won't take a chance in trying a second pair."
2.0,Just good for the price
2.0,"They looked decent. The fabric felt as I expected it to. However, most definitely NOT squat proof. I didn't order too small, there was plenty of room for give. But when looking in the mirror at my backside, not even in a squat, I could clearly see the goods. I wouldn't even wear them around the house in front of my kids. Returning."
2.0,"I am 5'8' and 145 lbs. I'm rather normally shaped. I ordered based on the sizing of other corsets I've bought. Unfortunately, the bottom of the corset section barely covered my belly button and the lace stopped right below my hips. The shoulder straps were also tight fitting. I tried to wear it without the shoulder straps so that I could pull it down lower but the corset was still too short to look good. Very disappointed becase I loved the picture. I will not be buying a larger size because the corset fit well around my body - I'm concerned a larger size would make it slip off me."
2.0,"The fabric is very soft, but it's way way too short. Not a nightgown at all."
2.0,It fits but there is no material in the top.  If you  are not very flat chested there is no coverage.  It looks very full in the bust but it is not.  Unless you don't mind everyone seeing the side of your breast this may not be for you
2.0,Pictures make this bracelet seem bigger and better than it is. It is tiny and doesn’t blend well at all with my other silver jewelry. Maybe I just got unlucky.
2.0,"Some one said the pants would fit 200 plus pounds and about 5 feet 5 inches. It is fine in the legs but bones about the crotch for me.  The material feels nice the open toe is nice, but I can’t tell if there is a front or back."
2.0,"Do NOT waste your money on these PJs. Although they are relatively soft they significantly shrink in size. I bought an XL for my elderly mother, which out of the package would fit her. Once it was washed & dried it looked more like a size medium!! Now I’m stuck with PJs that don’t fit."
2.0,Cheap papery-type material. The plastic snaps on the storage pockets are so stiff the fabric rips after a few times and renders the storage useless.
2.0,"Pjs are cute however, they run small. I usually am a med/large, so I ordered a large and it was way too tight."
2.0,Its pretty color BUT! It's NOT a night shirt the photo is deceiving. It is very short and XL is more like a Medium in US sizing... I bought it for me but ended up giving it to my young teen daughter instead... the fabric is thin too... not worth the price. 2 stars for the colors but that's it. Will not buy again.
2.0,"I normally wear a large/xl. According to the size chart, a large would be a little big on me but that is what I ordered. Couldn’t be More off. So small it was ridiculous. It came with no belt. So I want able to even pretend to make it fit. And there was an huge cut all the way down the front of it. Aside from all of that. The robe was beautiful. I’m very upset that there was so much wrong with it!"
2.0,"If you are looking for a cheap child's play tutu, this is perfect.  However, if you are wanting an adult to wear it, it will be very thin and flimsy looking.  Also, it doesn't stretch easily to 40 inches, but requires serious stretching, with a band that digs.  It is also not as puffy as the photo appears.  It is only 3 layers think, but it does have a nice satin band.<br /><br />Pros:<br />good child's play tutu  (I would say waist under 25 inches would be ok)<br />satin band<br /><br />Cons:<br />not adult tutu<br />flimsy/thin<br />not puffy like the photo<br />3 layers thick<br />no nice seam on the bottom"
2.0,Doesn't stay in ear. Falls out. Returned.
2.0,It runs smaller than normal I bought a small I normally  buy extra small but glad I didn't.
2.0,"It's cute but was tiny, and I'm not a very big person. Bummed because I was so excited for it."
2.0,Comes undersize wish I could return it I bought two different sizes and did not fit
2.0,It’s such a small purse and they should advertise it under the girls section. The color and quality is great but the picture is an optic illusion.
2.0,Very poorly strung so I returned it. The beads area very nice quality so its a shame it was poorly strung. you oculd tell it would break and scatter in no time at all
2.0,"The cups would only fit an A or B size, I'm a D. Also, the lace is very scratchy and uncomfortable. The little shaped cups are great though in my other bras that have modesty shield pockets as they aren't as &#34;flat&#34; as the other brands so, I guess it was worth the price to get those."
2.0,"When I received the strap I was very exited because I really needed a strap for my ukulele so it could be more comfortable while I play, but when I got it.... 1. The material is super cheap.. 2. You can't tighten it so the ukulele stays very low.... and 3. the hook to connect to the sound hole is very loose it slides around and I am afraid that because of this product being so cheaply made that it will ruin my ukulele.<br />I will not be using this strap ( WASTE OF MONEY)"
2.0,"Very very thin, hard to get my head through. But I'm thinking it will be good for layering to get the look but not the warmth"
2.0,"I returned this. I gave it 2 starts because the material was very nice, but it's nothing like the photo. There is no defined waistline. It just hangs and it's really heavy, so it just kinda looked frumpy."
2.0,Looks cheap:/
2.0,Too bulky for me but my daughter loves it so I gave it too her
2.0,I wear a large & ordered a large & still didn’t fit me so I will have to go up a size if I order another one. The outfit also makes sounds so I didn’t like that so I returned it.
2.0,"Looks cheap,like a toy.I gave it to my 6year old daughter.not happy with quality."
2.0,I bought the dress with the deep v and layers all the way down with lace. Although the style is cute the lace is shiny kinda cheap looking.  Looks sort of like a fancy robe. Size is pretty subjective. Everyone’s built differently but the xl was large on me. I tried this on three times and a wanted to like it so much!
2.0,"Colors did not match description. On the pic it looks orange, black and white, but arrived orange, marine blue and weird looking pink. Bracelet is much wider than similar items I bought and didn’t wear comfortably."
2.0,"The design was nice, although a bit large for my taste. My main complaint is that the ball came off very easily. I had it on as tight as it could go, and even tightened throughout the day and it still fell off at one point and I lost it. Not worth the money for it to come off like that."
2.0,This mask was very large on my face. I have a round short fact and it covered a major part so the makeup was covered and didn’t complete the look I was looking for (Mad Max of Thunderdome Warrior)
2.0,"I wanted straps to make my black travel cases easy to identify on the conveyor belt. Most of the colors are two tone, so I thought I’d give it up to chance. I got a black strap and a rainbow strap. One is invisible on the most common suitcase color and the other is a personal identity statement that you might not want to make. I wonder if they have a large stock of colors that they want to get rid of? It would be nice to see which colors other people receive so that I can be proved wrong."
2.0,I ordered a couple sizes up and they were still too small. Such a bummer. And they stink like chemicals
2.0,Great clarity of optics but the frames are too tight against my temples. I wear a US hat size of 7 1/8. These squeezed too much unfortunately.
2.0,"It's mostly my fault for not liking it. The lenses are too huge, I ordered this as a replacement for my old aviators. I didn't do enough research for the sizes and stuff so for my face, it doesn't look good."
2.0,I should’ve read the reviews before I purchase these. Description is misleading there’s only one earring. And it does not stay on my ear.
2.0,They're nice and all but the button on it already fell off
2.0,"The snap portion is fine, the chain is absolutely garbage quality."
2.0,Wish the quality was better.
2.0,I had gave mine away because it was way too big
2.0,The jumper  looks better online  than it does in real like. Slightly cheap looking. I couldn’t do it. I have an image!! Returned!
2.0,MUCH shorter than pictured- bought to wear with leggings and not nearly long enough to cover what I wanted to cover.
2.0,I liked the dress but the front seemed a little pig in the chest area. I am a 36C. So I dont know why it was doing that.It would just fold over. And it seemed like it was not even. One side seemed a little bigger than the other. I decided to return the dress
2.0,Fit fine. Lousy fabric. Sent back.
2.0,"I was very excited to get this hat, it's sturdy and the stitching is great, but the one time I wore it, I noticed a couple people staring at the brim. It wasn't until an hour or so later did I realize that the small ARMY tag on the tip of the brim was VERY off center. Love the stitching and sturdiness of the hat, but it will have to be returned."
2.0,"I ordered a 5x so it would be large to wear over a shirt, it's very small."
2.0,"This was not what I expected, the quality was very low and did not look the same way it did in the picture."
2.0,"These earrings are so large not necessarily a bad thing but I didn’t expect them to be quite so large... and the enclosure on one of them was lopsided or navy and sat funny  when on. Looks like it was a manufacturer error, also the fringes come off....bad purchase"
2.0,"The print is really cute, however the fit was not as expected. I knew they would be wide legged pants, but the waist was extremely cinched while the pants themselves were much wider than anticipated. Overall, the fit was funny and just didn’t flatter me. I wish I could return them, but you aren’t given the option. The seller only refunds a portion of the pants due to the international shipping cost."
2.0,"Love the wallet itself. It's nice and roomy for all of my cards and I love the color, but it came in the package with 2 scuff marks and a brown spot on it. I'm hesitant about using something to try to get it off, because I don't want to ruin it."
2.0,"I brought a small but should have gotten a medium , the sizes run really small , like a size smaller"
2.0,"It’s not good!<br /><br />I bought this for my daughter but it didn’t fit then I tried it and they didn’t even fit me if you buy this there’s a chance but it’s like 1%100,000,000 that it might fit.<br /><br />If I could describe it in emojis it would be 👎👎👎😢<br /><br />I was soooooo soooo sooooo disappointed when we tried them on"
2.0,Two buttons came off the first wash. Sleeves are too long but it’s too short to tuck into jeans.
2.0,"The bag itself is beautiful and exactly what I expected esthetically. However, the quality isn't great. 10 minutes within my first use, the bag began to unglue and detach on the inside. Very disappointing!"
2.0,The design was great but the fit was horrible..much smaller than the indicated size
2.0,"Great price, but half of the lights didn't work."
2.0,Way to small for size indicated.
2.0,"It definitely did not fit like a XXL should fit, not oversized at all but kinda comfy"
2.0,could not push the back cover back in it's place
2.0,A very unremarkable timepiece once you see it in person. The band barely fit my wrist and the hour markers were painted on instead of applied indices.
2.0,"This dress was alittle big in the waist for me but a belt fixed that. The skirt felt stiff and plasticy so I ran it through the wash before wearing it. As you can see, one of the seams started to come apart right after I took it out of the washer to hang dry it. What is worse is that the fabric has frayed so I couldn't fix it if I wanted to. The dress is otherwise cute and has good pockets, which is why it gets 2 stars. Also, the care guide on the dress itself says handwash only, which isn't what the product description says."
2.0,"I ordered big for both me and my fiance but they were too small. Skin tight small.  Good luck. At least, like always, returns are easy with Amazon."
2.0,The flare looks wrong.
2.0,Ridiculously large! the material is nice but its so comically large. The shaft part s stretchy yet starts out at about 10in long. The balls part i could literally fit over my actual head its so huge! it's a shame because it is nicely made.
2.0,Broke after less than two months. :(
2.0,One of the metal parts of the connector immediately fell off.  Nothing gorilla glue couldnt fix.  Took forever to arrive.  Wearing it now.  About ehat I would expext for $5
2.0,Need more size detail
2.0,Material very cheat and when I receive the Item it came out apart
2.0,There is basically no grip on the heel so it flops. Don’t buy these.
2.0,It's ok Not as I hoped for a teenager willie happy with it.
2.0,it is not like the picture.
2.0,Not liked much. Too chunky.
2.0,This visor has a nice big brim but unfortunately it hurts my head after only wearing for a minute. The &#34;clip on&#34; part extends way in the back of the head-farther around  than most clip-on's which usually sit behind the ear and this is very painful for me.  Perhaps it is because I have a small head? Not sure but I will not be wearing it very often for any length of time.
2.0,It kinda feels like athletic legging material-stretchy and tight
2.0,enormous...many reviewers liked the soft fabric - i thought the whole dress looked cheap.
2.0,"this dress is SO cute, i was really disappointed that it was too short to wear :( to be fair i have a longer torso, but typically with most dresses they at least cover my butt. not with this one. i was too lazy to return it,  so i turned it into a crop top lmao. i'm sure shorter-torso people wouldn't have an issue with the length though!"
2.0,"i bought this for my awesome niece, but their was no size for girls so i got the smallest size possible and yet it was still too big for her who is 13 yrs old. should had sizes for both genders"
2.0,I don't think it's as detailed as much or as deep as the picture shows. The edges are really rounded off and it just comes off as dull a bit.  I was a little disappointed that it kinda lacked detail.
2.0,I thought it would have a velcro size band in the back like most every other hat I've owned. This doesn't so order carefully.
2.0,Thin rubber. Difficult to squeeze open. Older versions were much better but hard to find. I don't understand why all men don't have some kind of change holder or  coins drop in cushions of chairs!
2.0,backs are not silver- so I'm using backs of other earrings
2.0,These boots are not waterproof.  I was walking my dog through some wet grass and water seeped in from the toe of the shoes.
2.0,"The hat is super cute and tiny. I didn't realize that you had to decorate it yourself. Which I wouldn't have bothered me at all, but I didn't even get any of the candy charms. So it's turned into a sad disappointment."
2.0,I am returning the dress.
2.0,"It’s cheap made in China material, fits more like a moo moo. I don’t think Walmart would even sell it. It’s not cute."
2.0,I wear a 6.5-7 shoe & these socks were too small. They ride down in back whether I'm wearing shoes or not. Also thin material
2.0,"Even the skirt is super cute, don’t buy it if you’re thick. It won’t go over your butt for anything."
2.0,A little bit small for my face....cute though
2.0,"i was very exicted to get this wallet, i searched for days looking for the &#34;right&#34; wallet i wanted. it showed up fast but when i opened the box, the smell was very strong, wasn't real leather and looked very cheap. I wanted something of better quality and that didn't have a strong odor."
2.0,"The zodiac design on this keychain is so pretty and when I received it, it was true to the photo. The problem was that the keychain appeared much sturdier and more durable in the photo than it actually was. I thought the medallion would have a little heft to it, but it does not. Also, the zodiac sign is basically a sticker, and a poorly-adhered one at that! I am more careful about my possessions than the average person, but in less than a week, and with normal key usage, the Taurus emblem had fallen off of the keychain, never to be seen again. Now I have this empty, flimsy, sad circle hanging from my keychain. Not cool."
2.0,It wasn’t exactly the same as the picture
2.0,This product is not 100% cotton. It's 85% polyester 15% linen
2.0,I am very disappointed that it is not real sterling silver.
2.0,"I am returning these jeans.  The pants are exactly the same as I bought from Costco,  size 10, average length.  However, the pair I received is 3"" longer."
2.0,Did not fit my body at all.  Tried on with straps going both ways crossing in front was tight and crossing straps in back left gaps of material on the sides.
2.0,It’s a lot thinner than I thought it would be
2.0,(The black is the strapless) they are supposed to be the same size. I am so disheartened that the bra is too small for so long I tried to find a strapless bra for myself but it never worked out. I am a 34D and bought LeBron that size because all the reviews say it is true to size but it is not believe me go up a size( cup). Now I have to try and return it which is a hassle and try in a bigger cup size.
2.0,Look nice but break way to easy.
2.0,It was tight. Size was a little off.
2.0,"This item was very large and bulky, not to mention very cheap looking.  Looked like it was made of plastic.  definetly not worth the money.  Returned it the very next day."
2.0,No me gusto por que se ve que rápido se le va a caer el esmalte dorado y las piedras vienen mal pegadas . Mala calidad ;(
2.0,"The material is good but quite heavy for the summer, and the fit is really tight. I am 5 ft. 2 in, and wear a size 4 to 6. I ordered a medium but even that was tight. Otherwise, the color and style are really nice. You should know that the customer is responsible for paying to return the item through a carrier of her choice, which means going to the Post Office or UPS and arranging for the return. It is not convenient for busy career people, and  Amazon.com should make it a point to include this information when a customer orders items from businesses that don't provide paid return labels. That is why I will probably not order from this merchant again."
2.0,"Loved the fit and cut, but didn't like the fabric, felt cheap and scratchy to me."
2.0,Way too small. Order at least 2 sizes up. I'm a 34-35&#34; waist and I ordered a 36 and it was way to small around the waist. I should have ordered a 38. Product being returned. Jean quality is ok. You get what you pay for.
2.0,Black and blue leggings are completely see through but the grey ones are great. I recommend getting a size up
2.0,The fit is small for the size but I kept them.  They show heavy wear doing minimal walking for a couple weeks.
2.0,"I have a gold one and silver, gold one is almost a year old and in good shape, this one is not even six months and it turned green and then black. Terrible quality"
2.0,The pants part were small and the straps were WAY too long. The bib was missing from the order. If you order this be prepared to return or try on first (before you need it).
2.0,Esta muy corta no abarca El estomago
2.0,Nice quality but the material feels gross to me. I wish I had returned it.
2.0,I really liked these. Severely faded after about 5 washes. Disappointed in the quality.
2.0,"I saw a slytherin scarf at Walmart for $9.99, but when I came back to get it they were sold out and didn't plan on ordering any more so i got this instead. This is literally the exact same one, same tag and everything! Not terribly happy with spending over twice as much on the same itchy scarf. Was hoping for at least better quality."
2.0,"Didn't fit, was too small and uncomfortable."
2.0,"This one looks very nice, but as many others have said, it's way too thick, the button doesn't fit well and it just doesn't do what it's supposed to do."
2.0,Fits small not like shown in the picture
2.0,"Nice glasses, thought it would've been a bigger frame"
2.0,I didn't expect extravagance for the money but these are super cheap looking. I think there is one pair out of the 9 I will actually wear.
2.0,The tights were thin and too small. Dress fit well but couldn’t get tights past my thighs. Had to return it. And the wig is kinda ugly. Yarn material.
2.0,"not the size that I expected it was extremely small I was so upset too because I really liked the design of the shirt, wound up giving it to my daughter who is much smaller than I am."
2.0,"I'm 5"" 4 and this dress was too short for me. I like heels and couldnt wear anything but flats, and was still too short."
2.0,"The helmet itself is just fine, but the visor is completely see-through. It does come with a black balaclava, but you can still see there’s a person wearing it through the front. Not ideal. I’m having to order tinting and try to apply it myself so the helmet looks as it’s supposed to."
2.0,"Sigh. The magnet is giant, but has no pull. The jewel falls off with, quite literally, a stiff breeze (or, ya know, moving your face a tiny bit)"
2.0,"Cute, but for very small wrists. Not mine."
2.0,Loved  them but they broke after about a month. Bummed.
2.0,"Like a previous poster wrote, just like leggings. CIC Collection does sell another pair of metallic pants which are more of a demin thickness and feel. I bought both to compare and returned this one."
2.0,"It’s more of a shirt than it was a dress. Order up in size, it does not fit as expected. If you’re short, than you’ll be fine."
2.0,Not great quality. More like cheap long underwear
2.0,"Very cheaply made and the shaded color was already chipped off upon receipt. If my child did not need it immediately, I would have returned it. Giving it two stars solely for the style."
2.0,"The socks are great, but fit too small on me (I wear a size 10 shoe) I think if you have smaller feet they would be great.  Mine have holes in the toes already cause they have no stretch, and ripped the first day."
2.0,"Cups are WAY too small for the 34-D that I am. I took the built-in cups out and wore it over a strapless bra. This worked ok, but this is still for a much smaller chest than I have."
2.0,This dress is pretty but it's not true to size I ordered a 3X it looks like it's a size small
2.0,"As far as a regular tank top goes, these are fine. They are not compression, which was the main reason I ordered them. As I need a good compression tank, I returned them."
2.0,Didn't fiit right
2.0,Meh. They fit good everywhere except there’s an excessive amount of baggy denim in the crotch area. It looks like I had an adult diaper come loose in the front from the bagginess. An overall unattractive shape in the front. It’s unfortunate because everything else about them is good. I’ll wear them around the house.
2.0,The style looks pretty on the model and in the photo but don't be deceived. The actual fit is terrible. The X in the front of the top keeps moving up to the neck like it's going to choke you. The top was poorly cut and designed. This product may have been designed for smaller people with less curves.
2.0,Super cute put it on and within one hour the band broke off the metal clip
2.0,purchase the correct size but it is not true to size and it is way to large for a little girl
2.0,Not exactly what I was looking for. The material is thin but the seam in the middle makes it difficult to wear for very long. I found it to be very uncomfortable.
2.0,Broke the third time I wore them
2.0,The backs of the earrings fall off a lot n it's not the  best to get a baby. Won't  buy ever again.
2.0,"They're okay...Pants are a little heavy, and too baggy for me, but if you like them that way, these are the jeans for you..."
2.0,"Not impressed, for several reasons. First, they are too short. I'm only 5'8&#34; and they aren't long enough to tuck into my ankle boots, not even a little bit. Also I'm pretty sure one of the legs on the pants is shorter than the other. Second, they don't have as much stretch as I thought they would for &#34;jeggings&#34; and they aren't very soft like other jeggings I own. Third, the material is weird and they appear a bit shiny in the sun. Fourth, these seem to be cheaply made, one of the legs keeps twisting around so the seam start showing near the front of my leg/shin bone and I constantly have to adjust them. They're not comfortable, and not what I expected."
2.0,It only lasted 1 use then it broke. I'm very disappointed.
2.0,Beautiful dress but size runs small. I am 5'3&#34; tall and weigh 112 lbs. I normally wear a size small but ordered a medium because of the reviews. It was still too tight and too long for my height. I may order it in a large and hem it myself.
2.0,Doesn’t look the same as the picture. Plus it is short too. The sleeves were very awkward.
2.0,"I measured myself according to their chart, but the dress was WAY too big around the chest and waist areas. The dress itself felt very heavy while on, and the fabric was not breathable."
2.0,5 of them we broke in some form one missing gem one no opening  😢
2.0,Not what I wanted once I saw it live.
2.0,Not happy!
2.0,I was pretty excited because based on reviews people claimed this sweater is much like the very expensive version.... false. It is very soft and VERY warm but that's about it. I like that the bottom is longer but the sleeves around the wrist are very awkward and uncomfortable. I normally wear L and I ordered up per other people's reviews and I do feel that is necessary but only if you're fit and have large arms... I have quite muscular arms and the XL fit me perfectly but my torso needed a large to give me any other shape than square and therefore it was unflattering.
2.0,"It's a super cute onesie. BUT it is not what is in the photo discription. I ordered a white one with a shamrock on the front and what I got was a white onesie that says Irish Princess (in rhinestones). I kept it, because I didn't want to deal with reshipping, and because it was still an acceptable onesie. But I was disappointed to open it and find that it was not what I ordered."
2.0,"I bought this because I thought it would be a perfect travel wallet- and I could use the compartments to put money into different &#34;budgets&#34; such as food, entertainment, transportation...etc. The compartments won't hold much, especially in dealing with foreign currencies that require a lot of bills. Beyond the fact that it doesn't hold very much the quality is not good. The faux leather is very cheap and would not hold up for long under the best of circumstances,  let alone traveling throughout Asia. I ended up not even bringing the wallet because I knew that it wouldn't hold up and would be a headache."
2.0,Did not fit pregnant daughter. Could not get slip bodice to fit under formal maternity dress bodice. Ended up wearing half slip instead.
2.0,The color was drastically darker than pictured. When it arrived it was a shade lighter than black. I was really hoping for the cobalt blue color jacket but got a light black one instead. =/
2.0,"These were very small / tight considering the xl size.  The inseam was less than 3 inches, probably closer to 2""  They were stretchy and the color was good but had to send them back."
2.0,"This dress fits weirdly around the neckline and the fabric is so sheer and see through, I have no idea what anyone would wear under it... very dissapointing for such a cute dress."
2.0,"Nice dress, great color, unfortunately a little clingier than I thought if would be and shows every lump and bump."
2.0,"I was looking to purchase about 5 sets of noise cancelling earphones/earmuffs for kids with sensory issues in my first grade classroom. Thankfully, I only ordered one of these to try them out. Although these are okay for muffling noise, they are a pain to get on and off. The kids have a difficult time with these earmuffs. The ear part part spins and is constantly getting turned the wrong way. In addition, the ear part pops off and needs fixing quite a lot. I will not be ordering more of these."
2.0,Very thin and see through.  Almost like linen
2.0,these are not that comfy. They are longer than the picture shows. and they feel like plastic.
2.0,"It claims to be Green Nephrite Jade and I thought so at the beginning but after wearing it for two days it started to get scratches which is a sign that it is fake. Real nephrite does not get scratched, in fact you should be able to scratch a piece of glass with it. It does look good on my hand, and I didn't have high expectations considering that it is only $42 but I thought it would look good for at least a year. I would save my money and try to find something that is of better quality since now it feels like I threw $42 dollars. Also the color is like a dark spinach green with no color variation what so ever which is another sign that it is fake."
2.0,I got this for a special occasion.  You can see the picture of the yorkie but the writing is not visible when you have it on. What is the use then?
2.0,Returned. Fringe falling out and sizing was small. Itchy fabric
2.0,After the first wash the seams started unraveling
2.0,"I was so excited for this dress. It would have been perfect for our gender-neutral baby shower.<br />This dress is lined, but still is so sheer. Though I sized up, the dress was so tight around my 38D pregnant bust. But it was huge around my 20-week belly and definitely had a lot of room for the belly growth. Oh well, back it goes"
2.0,"Very disappointed when I got this “dress”. It’s a very thin material and more like a swim cover-up wrap, than a dress. It doesn’t come with a belt like pictured at all, just a sash thing to wrap around the dress which you can’t tell from the picture. Definitely not worth the price. I gave it 2 stars because it is cute material and it does fit, although I would definitely be careful sitting down since it doesn’t wrap very much<br />Will be returning unfortunately"
2.0,"Length is right, but fit is about a size smaller"
2.0,"Shrank in the washer after one wash. The fabric was sensitive and caught hair in it very easily. The fabric was too thin to consider this a jacket/hoodie.  The first overall wear of this product was comfortable, light, soft. I just thought I was paying for something a little bit warmer/thicker and durable."
2.0,It is nice for a tall person but thin materials
2.0,It's the size of a kids purse. I ended up giving it away I didn't realize how small it was
2.0,slides when the child wears them inside the house
2.0,"The wings themselves are beautiful, but the hand/wrist loops were sewn to be about an inch and a half long. Definitely not big enough to fit any hand through. Such a disappointment, because everything else about the wings is great."
2.0,"The stitching and edging are decent, but the buckle is extremely weak.  I wouldn't trust it -- spend five-ten bucks more and get a decent one."
2.0,This was for my nine year old son.  He was so excited to get it and the ends came apart almost immediately after purchasing it.
2.0,Never received the socks or the face rag very disappointed
2.0,"It's shorter than expected, but good material overall. I got the grey/red and it's cute, just short."
2.0,Must sell or give away because it's to small. Not good sizing information.
2.0,it stinks! the rubber must be made out of cheap material or something.
2.0,"Hang dry after washing or it will shrink. I washed this on delicate, cold water. Then low tumble dry and it still shrunk"
2.0,Don't know why the size 2 was way too small. Should have fit perfectly but didn't. Had to return it.
2.0,One wear and they are a mess. Too small for adult feet
2.0,It's cute but it came ripped and the top was too big and bottoms too small. Had to return.
2.0,"This is a nice beach bag. The cooler portion is a nice theory, but is too soft and has no rigidity to provide any protection to anything you are packing. That is unless you are using it for cans or put your food inside a plastic container first. If there was any form of support to the sides to prevent the bag from smashing down on the cooler - this bag would be GREAT. But since we had to add our own reinforcments...it was good."
2.0,"The reason why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 .... is because the price reflects the quality. Having said that.... they are terrible quality and they look terrible. They look and feel more like those old people glasses that were on the ""as seen on tv"" ads. Except the quality is actually worse. The set I got as well were already broken to begin with. They came with a stripped screw.<br /><br />But if you want to use them for a halloween costume or for a young kid who you know will eventually break them... they would be good for that."
2.0,If you touch the screen of the watch at all the time changes
2.0,Looks Great not receved yet .waiting<br />!!!!!!
2.0,"Cute sandal, but doesn’t hold up well.  They started tearing a part only after a couple weeks.  Ok if only worn 1 once every other week."
2.0,Doesn’t stay on very well and the headband has an elastic tie that leaves indents in your forehead
2.0,I followed the size chart but should be ordered my usual size. It was way too big.
2.0,Fabric was soft but the sizes ran small
2.0,"Super happy to get this item in my normal size, but when I put it on my arms felt like they were suffocating and I couldn’t even close the class anywhere especially my chest area even to close the one closest to the bottom. It probably would’ve broken this item."
2.0,Pros-200 mt water resistance(?)<br />  Solar<br />  Casio(can't kill them)<br />  Cost<br /><br />Cons-Digital screen too small for me to read even with glasses on.<br />  White hands on whaite face made it difficult to read.<br /><br />Most of my complaints about this watch are really my own fault. Eyes going bad etc.. Gave it away for Christmas gift. Person loves it. they have no complaints about it whatsoever. Good watch. Just not for me.
2.0,"Ordered a large, ended up with a 2XL. Thanks for making me have to go out and replace this christmas gift. Hiring people possessing 3rd. grade or better reading comprehension skills could possibly fix this (and Amazon's general) issues"
2.0,Too long. Too big
2.0,I was very disappointed with the quality of this bag. Right after the window closed for returns it completely started falling apart with straps breaking both for the backpack function and for the over the shoulder strap.
2.0,Not quite the quality that I expected and it runs small
2.0,My husband loved this band at first but in less than a month the band broke where the clasp is so it is unrepairable.
2.0,I wore this for a whole week and woke up<br />And it was broken. Ugh
2.0,I usually wear a S/M hat. Both of the hats are too small. They move up on the head even after adjusting the Velcro back.
2.0,Didn't fit my shape. Will be returning
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:ac2d677aafa83780975a030b1bc6f26a]] My wife bought me this off of my wish list. It worked for 5 months. Then the time changed and it didn't.  So I tried to calibrate it per instructions with no success. Replaced battery, no success. The hands just shake and vibrate.  I also see this elsewhere for less than 69 bucks. Very disappointed with the overall experience.  See attached video."
2.0,It is attractive but not very functional because it can’t hold too much.
2.0,"Beautiful dress, loved the pockets. I got the black one with sunflowers. It was not see through and felt like a nice tee shirt material. I got a large, my normal size. Fit great except the chest. I’m a 36-C and the material was draping open, there was so much space there, I couldn’t tac the opening closed without it looking horrible. If you have much larger breasts and like to show them off.. this is a great dress for you."
2.0,"Item shipped as advertised, price point was ok. Unfortunately quality was poor and felt plastic like. The strap broke from the bag within 1 month of light use. And fabric around zipper tore as well. Definitely ok for short term use and carrying light items; not reliable for long term"
2.0,"Just received my pants. I was looking for linen pants. These are linen imitations. I failed to read the fine print; the title stated linen pants. I honestly feel tricked. I get it, but this is a bit of false labeling... bait and switch... whatever you wanna call it."
2.0,This cover is thin and does not hinder the touch screen usability.  water gets trapped under it when showering and It is a little difficult taking the cover on and off.
2.0,"Overall, I really like the idea. My son loved the watch. It has been just over a month and one of the spring bars already came out. Sadly we couldn't fine it and upon further inspection, it looks like some of the plastic on the lugs was damaged in the process so I doubt even a replacement set of bars would last long. I'm also not going to spend $5-$6 on replacement bars for such a cheap watch.<br /><br />In the end, spend a little more for something else otherwise you will wasting your money."
2.0,It fits small and they fit tight-order two sizes up for a relaxed fit
2.0,"Bought these slippers because I wear a size 10 1/2.  They fit good.  I didn't want an 11 as I felt they would be too big, so for me these were s good option.  I just got them, so can't comment on their durability and wear yet.<br /><br />UPDATE 5/29/2018: The sole on one of the slippers is coming off and all the cushioning inside is gone flat.  So while these were good to begin with, in less then 9 months they are wore out."
2.0,"This is a really adorable dress that I bought in 3 different patterns the blue/green plaid, the red plaid, yellow and black floral. The frustrating thing was that each dress fit differently. The blue/green plaid was really snug in the bodice. I believe it required dry cleaning. Super cute but I prefer not to have to dry clean and I was afraid the seams might split. The red plaid fit perfectly but I really didn't like the plaid in person. But because the fit of this dress was just right, I ordered 2 others thinking they would be great. Wrong....The last dress was yellow and black and the bodice was huge. All the dresses went back and I was sad. As far as care, I believe the red plaid and yellow and black floral recommended cold water wash. My typical size is a 2/4 petite and I ordered a small."
2.0,"Runs very small. I bought one size up and I should have gone two. Material is nice, lightweight and color is even."
2.0,using my dad's account lol- this is a beautiful unique piece I bought for myself; it is truly gorgeous but mine has a major flaw; when screwing the top knob back on it doesn't line up where is should and doesn't screw back on all the way. When it is fastened as tight as it can go it faces left and not straight.
2.0,"UPDATED:  If you like your breasts to fall out of your bra and you wear a 38E, this bra is for you.  Even for sleep they are out and yea, rather just be braless.<br /><br />I got a XL due to the size chart (cursed with very large breasts, 38E) and while it fit, when I bent over my breasts &#34;fell out and went above the cup line.&#34;  It is a great bra for more of a relaxing  day and sleeping.  I am not used to the racer back, but wearing it more will help with that feeling. I would recommend for a woman with larger breasts to not expect a lot of support from this, but more of a relaxing/sleeping bra."
2.0,Comfortable but short in length & runs small
2.0,"I liked the material with a nice stretch. However, one arrived with a hole right on the boob!"
2.0,Not the compression I expected
2.0,The material is rather stiff so the skirt doesn't hang and flow like I expected.
2.0,Too small according to size chart.
2.0,They slide down very easily.  Enough so that I had to call a fashion emergency Togo home and change in the middle of Christmas shopping.
2.0,"The colors match but the length didn't, one is 45"" the other 48"""
2.0,I received the necklace but it did not include the five different colors pad.  Disappointed as it was advertised with the pads.
2.0,I bought them becasue I have small fingers and my rings fall off. These were too big and even if I cut them down. They just don't work for me. I wanted something that could not be seen and it looks like a have a bandaid on my finger.
2.0,En la foto se ve el marco de color casi trasparente pero en realidad es casi negro
2.0,"I am ampetite 5'2"" woman. This can not be a womans size! Ordered a Medium (my usual size)  thinking it would be a bit flowy. I swear this is a chdrens top. It is TINY. I didnt even bother truing iton. Folded, its the size of a sock. Lol. Ive seen baby clothes bigger than this."
2.0,"This is a very cute set that fits well but at the first wear, the pants started unraveling right away. Very disappointing."
2.0,This product looks nothing like what it looks like in the picture!!!
2.0,I have purchased this brand of eyewear before and it is a quality product.  However these are either factory seconds or just a cheaper line.  I am frequently adjusting sides because they always loosen in a few days.  This should not happen.  I wouldn't buy them again!
2.0,One of the underwear ripped on first wear
2.0,It is not as pictured and I cannot use but too much to pay to return it.
2.0,Really cute!  Wish it was bigger.  I am a size 14/16 and it is too tight in the tummy!  Bummed.  I got the 2xl!  I guess I should do some sit ups but in the mean time .....the shirt will be returned l!!!!!
2.0,Very dissapointed. It's so tiny I had to use a magnifying glass to see the detail. It is not white flowers against a black background but just a flower pattern stamped into the metal. The stones are so tiny they can't be seen with the naked eye.
2.0,"While these are super cute, I wanted the buyer to be aware that they are also fragile.  I purchased two of them, one for each mom for Mother's Day.  The first one snapped the chain within one wearing and the second had the charm come off."
2.0,eeeek
2.0,"The style is nice, but small. Fabric has “misprinted” flower design.  Has random black ink marks."
2.0,"Too short for tall people!!  I am 5’8 “ at 155 pounds, and they fit me perfectly in the hips and the waist, but, they are disappointing  high waters unlike the pictured  model."
2.0,"Loved them, BUT will not stay up it keeps sliding down ."
2.0,"it didn't look like the picture and was way too big. order a size smaller,  it is baggy."
2.0,"As of right now, I give it a 2 star. It’s a Christmas gift for a child so I’m not sure on it will fit, BUT I do know that this fabric is very light weight! So light weight that it’s see through."
2.0,"I do not recommend these glasses for riding; I've ridden with them for one week; early morning, midday and after dark.  Not dark enough for comfort on a sunny day, not clear enough for night. Comfort of fit is so-so.  I bought this set for the clear lenses to ride home at night after work. I do not feel safe riding on city streets or freeway do the level of tint. I'm tossing them and getting a pair with clear lenses."
2.0,"I purchased this a couple of weeks ago, and well. I only got one of the rings. I was supposed to get what was in the picture."
2.0,"They ran too small.  I wear a nine and the 5-9 were too tight.  Gave them to a friend who wears a size 7, they fit her."
2.0,Not as nice as it looks in picture.
2.0,"I used it for a month and the strap broke. The stitching holding the money pocket together is coming apart, and, like other reviewers said, it smells weird."
2.0,"after only a month of use, on of the lights doesn't work anymore! I must say my daughter has been very careful with the use of the shoes, not lighting them all the time, not wearing them when going to places where they could be damage... so a disappointment, she was so happy with the shoes at first, but now, she is so sad, that although taking care of them very well, they don't properly work anymore."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this, I tried, but I just don't. It's comfortable - very comfortable. And it seems good quality. I just don't like the way it lays on the back side (and I'm fairly average/proportionate  in size). It's short (and I'm only 5'4'') and because it's so baggy/flowy you really have to be careful when there's a little bit of wind."
2.0,The necklace was way too small to go around my neck.
2.0,"Thin material. The bibs seemed to be an entirely different size than the shorts/bibs. Cool design but overall seem cheap which, for the price, I guess I should have expected"
2.0,My husband got me these for Christmas and I just put these on today. I really love the color but was disappointed when I put them on as they had a hole in the crotch.
2.0,"I think I missed the mark to return this as I travel for work quite often. I bought the white. The cut is cute and all, but it's completely see through and the material is hideously cheap. It's made out of the material that they make halloween costumes out of...seriously. CHEAP LOOKING. You may be able to get away with the black if you dressed it up, but it's totally just now worth it, you gorgeous queens&lt;3"
2.0,These fit great (I wear a men's size 10.5 shoe) for about 45 mins. And then they stretched out to a size EEE. Wouldn't buy again.
2.0,Its thick and soft..  thats all I like though.<br />The color is off. I thought it would be a warm camel color. The fur has this pinkish tone to it while the drawstrings are a completely different shade... More of a true camel/brown.<br />Very unflattering... I know it's supposed to be oversized but the sleeves were bunched at the bottom and yet the torso part wasn't long enough.<br />Will be returning.
2.0,Horrible quality don't buy if u are bigger than a size 6
2.0,Color not at all like picture
2.0,"As you can see from the picture, the sandals are hardly worn but the lace has already broken. Buyer beware"
2.0,I was very disappointed in the lack of sparkle in these earrings.  They looked so fake! Returned them.
2.0,Used the chart for sizing and these were about 2 or 3 sizes too big
2.0,I noticed no difference at all after one week.
2.0,"The material reminds me of shiny curtains. The design of the garment is very wide and not flattering on full figured women as I looked super wide. While I was able to put it on, the zipper ended up not zipping all the way up. I typically order a 14-16 in skirts and I ordered the XXL in this. It’s definitely not something I plan to keep."
2.0,"When you bend down the top kind of scoops down and shows all of your stuff which is not the best.. that’s why I don’t like camis, that and the under arm part is like right in your armpit, not this top though. The only issue is the front dipping whenever you reach for something."
2.0,Came w a hole near the armpit. VERY VERY thin. Not as cute on as pic/model
2.0,"Too small. Definitely go one size up, especially if you are busty."
2.0,"I received these and they are solid dark blue, not multicolored as the photograph shows them. Quality is okay. Zippers seem a little weak. Will return and purchase a different product."
2.0,"I didn't like these bags. The handles are not as long as pictured, even after extending them to their maximum, they should have at least 3 inches more. The quality is not so good. They are slightly different to the pictures."
2.0,"I read some other reviews that said to ordrer big, which was a mistake.  I had to add a hole to make it fit.  The belt lasted about 3 months.  I noted the coloring on the outside started to rub off and finally the front buckle busted off.  I don't do physicial labor for a living so this is sub-par given the price of the product."
2.0,wasnt what i expected at all.
2.0,Thought it be metal but it was plastic and all the little charms fell of.
2.0,It could’ve been a cute dress if it fit like it should’ve. It was too big I had to pin it just to stay on! If you order please size down!
2.0,Too small and took a very long time to receive it.
2.0,Even thinking I needed to order a size up it was way too small. The item is very nice but it just doesn't work for me
2.0,It came up folded so it was very flat. I feel like if it come stuffed then it would have been nicer. I ended up returning it because I just didn't think it was worth it for the price. You can get a better quality unbranded bag at F21.
2.0,"This tank is a JOKE. Obviously this company designs their garments for small framed women and then simply enlarges the pattern for the larger sizes without taking into consideration how a woman's shape changes with larger sizes. As you can see from my photo, the bust area cannot accommodate my 36D chest, even in the size XL. My bust is very proportional to my size, so there is no reason the XL shouldn't fit besides poor design. At 5' 8"", it also fits me a bit short in the torso, you would have to be mucher shorter for the shirt to be long enough. Needless to say, this one gets returned immediately."
2.0,"I returned this item because it was way too small around the waist and way too long . I usually buy a Large in a skirt but this skirt was so small, I couldnt even zipper it up. The length was brushing the ground, and could cause you to trip."
2.0,"I loved this. My son picked it out for my daughter for christmas. Unfortunately, it broke the first day that she wore it. It won't close. Now it still looks good, but it is none stop noise as she wears it. She can't stand it. It's like wearing a bell around your neck. It works great, but won't stay closed."
2.0,"I love the sign inside. The only problem is I have are that when I tighten it it kind of hurts my ears sometimes and when I put the mask on the little hoops, it can be quite flimsy. I don’t know if it’s because I have a tiny head or some thing and I’ve noticed that it’s starting to fade a little bit and I haven’t washed it yet and I’ve seen reviews that if I washed it it would feed the complete color so I’m kind of afraid to wash it so I might hand wash it"
2.0,"I was looking for a pair of hiking pants, and these ""Lightweight EDC Hiking Work Pants"" came up in the Amazon search results. They had good reviews so I figured I'd give them a try.<br /><br />A few positive points before I try to dissuade anyone from ever trying to hike in these:<br />-Comfortable fit<br />-Water repellent<br />-Lightweight<br />-Plenty of storage pockets<br /><br />And onto the one big con:<br />There's a seam that runs along the back of the knee. This is more than likely fine for every day use, but if you're taking it on a hike, it will rub against the soft skin on the back of your knees thousands of times, scratching away just a little bit of you each time.<br />On my inaugural hike with these, I was lucky that my hiking partner brought along some adhesive bandages to act as a barrier, else I would have probably ended up finishing the hike in my underwear."
2.0,The outside is nice but the inside looks like a child sewed it. Very disappointing for the price
2.0,"Should have read the reviews.  Looks good, but it doesn't stay on well.  I have almost lost it several times in the few days I've had it.  The fastener comes undone way too easily.  Would not purchase again."
2.0,Cheap and not worth it at any price
2.0,"Something is off. No matter how much you push, squeeze, stuff , it doesn’t hold things right"
2.0,It's okay just really big and baggy. I don't really like it. I think I'll end up giving it to Goodwill.
2.0,"My twin 3rd-grade girls are enjoying analog watches. This watch in pink and another in lavender hue is adorable. I realize they were not expensive watches. I purchase them as stocking stuffers for Christmas, however, the girls had a disappointing day yesterday due to COVID19, so I gift-wrapped their watches and place them on their virtual homeschool desk to help change the mood of my 8 years old twin girls. Of course, it worked...the twins were happy. They were acting like smart little girls. Approximately 3 hour later the youngest twin Ka'Mya laid her watch on my nightstand and said, Mame it just fell apart! I tried to repair it but NOPE!  Now I have a disappointed child, AGAIN!  These are cute watches but in my opinion not durable. I expected them to last at least 30 days not three hours on the wrist, only!"
2.0,Fabric and difficult to get into and the cups were not secured very well
2.0,"A bit small for the weight and height listed. They tear pretty easily , but are fun to wear under ripped jeans or to add color to plain skirts and dresses."
2.0,The fabric part isn’t wide enough for a higher arch
2.0,"Believe me, this jacket is too small by a mile. Size up for sure. It is light and thin and seems lovely but none of that matters if the jacket looks like a doll's coat and won't zip up over a SMALL bust. I am returning and ordering a larger size because I like the jacket and I really wanted one like this. I just want to be sure other shoppers really understand this jacket seriously runs small. I don't know what some of the other reviewers are talking about when they say otherwise."
2.0,"Very cute shirt. I saw it runs small so I ordered a 2XL despite normally wearing a medium. Well my plan worked great, it fit everywhere but my chest which is a DD and it almost wouldn't even button over my breasts. Sad to return it but there is no way to make it work for me."
2.0,"The finish on beads wears off quickly on the part that rubs the neck. The length is excellent, longer than most others. I would prefer something that doesn't fade or lose it's color so quickly. If it hadn't lost its luster so quickly, I would've given 5 stars."
2.0,"I'm a 14/16 and could not get them past my thighs. Cute pattern for a thin person, but if u got some extra fat, may not work for you. I returned via amazon prime, and I typically get reimbursed immediately. This time I did not, and not clear why."
2.0,compresses feet / ankles / calves but the cutting in at the top of the calf leaves marks. would not recommend.
2.0,Misleading brand advertisement. Watch hook would not open
2.0,"I like the leggings, but only 1 pair came, and it says 2 pack!  I want the other pair, please!"
2.0,Won’t stay up. Wish they weren’t names brand stamped.
2.0,you need a wasp waist to look like the model!
2.0,I bought the large but it was way too small.
2.0,The material is not as expected. Do not like it. Will be returning it. Otherwise it probably would have been a nice outfit.
2.0,No socks included
2.0,I usually love PattyBoutik items but this one was a no for me. It was way too big and unflattering.
2.0,"i used this to mark my child’s backpack for  a camp field trip. when he came home at the end of the day, the plastic backing of the pendant had fallen off, and the “epipen inside” paper inside the pendant had fallen out.<br /><br />my son is very careful with his belongings - his backpack is in mint condition - and one day of light use is not a reasonable life span for this product.<br /><br />(if you still want to buy this product, i would suggest just wrapping sone clear scotch tape around the pendant BEFORE it falls apart; it shouldn’t be necessary, but should do the trick)<br /><br />i’m not sure why, but i couldn’t find the contact info for the seller."
2.0,For was off and quality was just ok.  Wore it for Halloween so wasn’t picky but not amazing
2.0,This dress looks good but once you try it on you begin to see it doesn’t fit as expected. The waist rides above your waist line and there are no belt loops for the belt. Overall it was an uncomfortable fit for me.
2.0,"Since the product is soft sided, when you retrieve something the whole thing collapses.  There are many pockets inside, all soft, and hard to access.  The inside of the purse gets very cluttered.  I love the look but dislike the functionality."
2.0,Love that these are adjustable but the elastic is do scratchy that  my kid doesn’t like wearing them. 😕
2.0,THey were alot smaller than indicated
2.0,"Seriously, I only gave this product two stars because I still love the idea of it. Otherwise, the gold is so obviously fake. It just doesn't stay on my ear. I would blame my own klutziness, but all of my other ear cuffs stay ni place. Sorry Zehui, the quality of your jewelry SUCKS!"
2.0,"Possibly helpful for men but I do not recommend this product, it doesn't feel like it supports my arch at all. It seems too big. The neoprene and Velcro is great though."
2.0,Definitely not the material expected.
2.0,"I bough the polarized lenses for my Ray-Ban, because I had previously bought a polarized replacement for my Arnette (in 12/2016), that have worked perfect ( and still does) . Unfortunately,  no longer the same quality . One month after using the new lenses I could see on the corner some air between the lens and the film. Now 7 month later is at a point that is affecting my field of vision."
2.0,"The bag is nice. But, I paid $80 for the bag. There was a store tag on the inside that said the bag was on sale for somethign like $35.00. I emailed the proprietor and he responded that somehow he was still losing money on the deal.  I saw something I liked and bought it so it is my responsibility, but certainly make me hesitate to shop this way again.  Again, the bag is great, but not happy with the purchase."
2.0,Not supportive bras
2.0,"I love how quickly it arrived. The actual product was not as good as I expected. The button to turn the phone to vibrate would not work. It was quite a task to get my audio plug to in when i was in ku vehicle. I ended up having to take the whole case off. Great concept, just didn't work out for me."
2.0,"The bag is the size I was looking for but the chemical smell is the worst, haven't been able to use it"
2.0,"By the second or third use, they were already completely fogging up. However, I never have high hopes for the ""ani-fog"" gimmick with any goggles. The reason these are receiving such a poor review is, the nose piece started coming apart within 3-4 weeks of having them. For a little while, I managed to get them to stay together while they were in place. However, as soon as I would move them at all, even to just make a small adjustment, they would come apart. Eventually, the nose piece completely broke and they wouldn't hold together at all. Not a product I would recommend to anyone else."
2.0,"I loved these until, the head of it just fell of one day. I was a little disppointed!"
2.0,"Carbon fiber pattern is cool. The rosewood is an elegant touch.  However, the edges are not a clean finish as pictured. In the picture the edges have what appears to be a black border to keep the cut from showing.  The one I received looks as if a carbon fiber pipe has been cut and then the rosewood is glued inside, without the outer black border as show  in the picture.  You can see some of the glue also.  I really wanted to like this, but it needs some finishing touches to dress it up a tad. I imagine after it gets “worn” the carbon fiber would start deteriorating at the edges without the finish as advertised. Ultimately decided to return."
2.0,En realidad es fue lo que esperaba en muy incómodo al usar y las patas de las gafas son duras me da miedo forzarlas para que no se vallan a parti.
2.0,"I like the poles. I used them on a 2 week vacation in Portugal. I have MS the poles assist with walking. The look good when going out to dinner.  When extended, t.he poles do not slip. For walking and to give better street grip, a crunch tip can be pushed over the pole end rubber cap. The strap cap is attached to the poles with a different type of plastic.  I use the straps to limit grip on the cork hand grabs. The cork grabs do not let the hand slip like poles with plastic grabs.  During normal use, I often drop poles. The picture shows the strap cap broken off from the poles. These are excellent poles, I hope the manufacturer can correct the design. For safety reasons, I cannot recommend.  Amazon honored the warranty and RMAd the poles,"
2.0,"The colors weren't distinct at all. It basically looks like a slightly pink hoop with the slightest hint of green on one end. I got the 8mm one, but it looked smaller than that. It fits so I'm keeping it, but I'm definitely unimpressed."
2.0,"Very shiny, returned."
2.0,Ordered a medium gir a small..poorly made.  How in pocket
2.0,Cute charms but one charm was already broken off when I opened the package.
2.0,"These fit me everywhere but the waist. The waist is too tight, and when pulling them on or off the seams have ripped along the waist. I have only worn them twice."
2.0,No genera todos los efectos que mencionan
2.0,"Tried on and couldn’t even zip it, although ordered my usual size 8.  Runs small and looks cheap.  Material is very rough and almost looks more like a costume than a dress.  Color is very pretty."
2.0,"After over a week the chemical smell is still noticeable.  The lining is similar to windbreaker jacket material, which is cheap looking.  The purse is so stiff & shiny & reeking of &#34;pleather&#34; (plastic pretending to be leather) that I am embarrassed to carry it.  This CANNOT be leather as it was advertised to be.  I should have known that the price was too low for genuine leather.  What a waste of money."
2.0,"they are thinner than i thought they would be,  they are not opaque"
2.0,The lower hanging piece comes detached easily and is not well made. Frankly I thought it was broken upon arrival until we received a replacement and same thing... lower part easily detaches and appears broken. It just kinda hangs there insecure. Other than that it's a nice decorative piece but waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay overpriced.
2.0,sented back
2.0,"Material is truly cozy, but the cut of this dress is really awkward. Sleeves and waist are large, but skirt portion of dress is small and clingy."
2.0,Was too short for my baby girl though I ordered the size that supposed to fit her. The size wasn't coresponding at all.
2.0,"I love the fabric. However this one doesn't have any straps to go over the ears. You just pull it up as shown in the picture on Amazon. That isn't going to work with my hair style, plus I am not sure if it will stay in place if I'm fairly active. I will try it out when it doesn't matter, and see if I can make it work."
2.0,Cute but tarnished quickly. Very disappointed that I only wore it maybe a month before the yellow gold turned.
2.0,"When you first put this hat on it looks good.  However, because it is elastic and not adjustable, it gets very uncomfortable after a few minutes because the elastic constricts your head.  My head size is size 7 1/4.  I would return it if I could. It will give you a headache."
2.0,These are child size. I bought them for adults and did not fit.
2.0,The dress I received was short. It went just below my knees. Not what I expected. Had to return it
2.0,"I wear a medium but ordered a large, and it still was too small.  The pants fit OK but fabric had no ""give"".....I couldn't sit or bend over.  The belt was broken and couldn't be repaired, so I had to buy a belt.  The top was so small that I had to cut the sides of the vest and insert material.  If someone orders this costume, please let them know that the sizes run small."
2.0,This dress looks nice but has flaws.  It was about knee length but the fabric and the fact that there is no back slit causes it to ride up as soon as you take 2 steps.  It goes from a work dress to a club dress in 3 seconds flat.  I wanted it for work so it didn't really work out.  the design is nice and I got lost of compliments on it but the top section over the center band has half a backing on it so you can see through the material for part and see where the backing starts.  Had to bring it to a seamstress to sort this out.
2.0,"Zipper teeth very large, easily fails behind the zipper foot. Purchased in July, September failed. Not quite 3 months. My previous wallet of this style lasted over a year."
2.0,"Being that this is a collar, it should be able to stand up to normal wear and showering.  However, within 3 weeks the plating was coming off in multiple areas.  Probably ok if you wear it for fashion, but not good for 24/7ers."
2.0,"This is not 24"""
2.0,"Tag was taken out of the jumpsuit, I believe it is smaller than stated on the package. Material is nice and the style is also nice. I won't be ordering from this company again because they are dishonest."
2.0,Did not like the black necklace portion. I came with a tear at center. I soldered the jump ring and hope the pendant will hold up!
2.0,"These are cute but again very,very small they are not for adults more like for babies or toddlers.i don't know why they don't put that in the description. I've ordered several pairs of earrings from Amazon and so far I've given 6 pairs away.dont want to go thru the hassle of returning to Amazon anymore."
2.0,Esta bonito pero se engancha mucho en la ropa
2.0,"Tight at waist, did not fit according to size.  Should have been larger."
2.0,It’s cute.  But very snug.  Not comfortable.
2.0,"I bought this as a replacement for a lost watch.<br />The thing that bothered me the most was the difficulty I had in attaching it to my wrist.  The band flops around when trying to attach it.  It would be better if I had three hands.<br />Also, the watch is difficult to read.  The characters are too small."
2.0,it’s only been two days and the big zipper already ripped and doesn’t close half way. it’s barely been used??? i was told to send in a photo in order to get this sorted through. not sure how else to submit this
2.0,The size seemed to big and overpowered other charms. And the tiny ring on it broke within a few hours. Not impressed with this one.
2.0,The sleeves were made for an orangutan. Way too long as are most of Amazon’s tops. Ugh.
2.0,too small and too dark. almost looks black
2.0,The dress is a disappointment.  The waistline is awkward and the elastic in it causes the dress to not stay in place.  It definitely annoys my daughter and she's not comfortable in it and it doesn't look cute. It's made from a semi-shiny cheap material.
2.0,Top too big around breast
2.0,The clasp is almost impossible to open once the bracelet is on my arm. I had to wrestle with it for several minutes to get it open. Seriously. The bracelet looks handsome though and the spacer tool was useful.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:51e23f568496c98ddd6175d9721a7b67]] The little points on the bottom of this cute little guy gets in the way of pushing the key in all the way. It isn't a super snug fit so your key has a lot of space it can move around in which also makes using it a bit annoying and difficult. It is very soft and a thick rubber and this one of course gets dirty quick because of the color. It is really cute, I just wish I could use it for my main house key. I put it on a different key I don't use often. :("
2.0,too small. had to return it
2.0,Tore after 5 washes
2.0,I am a 44DD I am having the hardest time finding a good bra...I ordered this one and I am a little dissapointed.  The underwires in the front poke out and make it look like I have these bones sticking straight out of my chest.  Everthing else is ok...no complaints other than the underwire not laying flush with my chest bone.
2.0,Very thin material and fits much smaller than normal sweatshirts
2.0,Live in Upstate New York my finger still got cold after half hour out side .
2.0,Worn twice and a hole ripped in the side
2.0,"Does this bag look as pictured?  Well, yes, that is until the paper stuffing is removed.  Then it folds over on itself.  There is no structure at all; not on the bottom and certainly not on the side or front panels.<br /><br />The fabric is nice, The hardware is silver-toned (Thank you for your answer, Sherif.)  The interior is fine.  It really is a pretty bag.  I'd be happy if it was not floppy which makes it useless to me.<br /><br />I expected it to be structured because my other CK bags are structured and sturdy.  This is a wide bag- 17&#34; at its widest and I have other wide bags that keep their shape.  I suppose I could try an insert but am not enthusiastic about spending almost 1/2 of the cost of the bag just to give it some shape.<br /><br />What a disappointment.<br /><br />Just a quick ps- does not come with a dust bag which is the first time this ever happened with a Calvin Klein bag.  The hardware is not plastic protected either and is lightly scratched. This alone would not have caused me to return it, but I suspect this was a return.  Product is stuffed with paper, wrapped in plastic and boxed."
2.0,The developers of tese lenses were out of focus when these were invented.<br />You have to tilt your head awkwardly to get a proper focus.<br />Back to the drawin board I guess!
2.0,"While these are very warm, comfortable and darn near waterproof, contrary to the description, THESE ARE NOT FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS! I am an electrician by trade and need to carry tools. The problem is twofold. 1) The outer nylon shell and thickness of the material makes it impossible to wear a tool belt since it won't stay above my hips due to the shell being so slippery and 2) There are zero, and I DO mean zero pockets for tools.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Very warm<br />Waterproof<br />Legs zip to hip to put on and remove easily<br />Reinforced knees for wear<br />Comfortable<br /><br />CONS:<br />No easily accessible upper pockets for pens, notepads, phone, etc.<br />Other than 2 front pockets, there are no others<br />No outer back pockets for wallet, handkerchief, rags etc.<br />No outer side pockets for tools<br />No bottom zipper meaning when you need to go to the bathroom, you have to open your coat to unzip from the top down to access your pants zipper thus releasing all of the stored heat to the outside cold and letting that in instead.<br />The slick outer nylon shell allows no way to actually hold up a tool belt for those of us with small or no hips.<br /><br />Basically, if you want a warm and comfortable Hi-Vis pair of insulated bibs and are in any career outside of construction trades, these are a good choice. If you're in the construction industry/skilled trades, stick with your Carhartts, Dickies, Big Smith, etc. bibs."
2.0,We bought this to try to wear while playing soccer (we thought if it worked for runners it would work for soccer).  It won't stay up over our nose and mouth on its own even if we aren't running .. maybe if we sew it?  But then it is hard to get on.  We will look for something different to try for soccer.
2.0,"I loved the fabric. however, it wasn't made well. The top seemed too short and off centered so it didn't lay properly. Maybe it was just my dress that had that defect. i really wish it worked since it's such a cute dress for the summer."
2.0,Not at all like picture
2.0,These don't come with rubber grommets to protect your guitar. More expensive than other strap buttons for no reason.
2.0,"I was really happy when I received it, however its not very sturdy. I had only been wearing it for a week when the tip broke off.... I still wear it and it looks funny but its all I have for now. So if you can spend a few extra dollars for something sturdier go ahead and do it or else youll regret it like me."
2.0,"I was expecting a navy sweater.  Instead, it was like a purple."
2.0,"This dress doesn't look as pictured. I got a medium, the tie part is so large that it hangs. The fabric is cheap and you can see through the pink. I washed it before wearing and it already started piling. Disappointed because this is my type of dress, poorly made."
2.0,"cute shoe, but either too small or too large"
2.0,"gave it to my daughter, I should've order 1 size up.... it looks good on her"
2.0,Hat to return this shirt. There were holes in the back seams. Not sure why but it was easy to return. I had been looking forward to wearing it though
2.0,"I like the design; it suits my style. However, the watch isn't very good at telling time. I had a pretty good time to set it up, so the fact that it doesn't have markers wasn't much of an issue. At 6:00 I set it, and ten minutes later, it was past 15 minutes on the watch. The hands move too fast. It's cheap, but this isn't one of the parts I should missing out on."
2.0,Brought this for my Birthday Celebration to go out clubbing and it was horrible the silver pieces on the outfit was falling off everywhere  every step or place i went there pieces everywhere. It fit me well and I love the look but it is cheaply made.
2.0,Much much smaller than expected. The quality is really good but not the size
2.0,Nice looking ring but very poor quality and multiple stones fell off on the first day of wear. I was embarrassed that I had given this as a gift to my girlfriend for her birthday... Her finger turned green
2.0,Necklace nice but chain broke i just got it
2.0,"I will keep them as they are comfortable, but they are not as soft to the foot as previous models, especially pure grit 3s. The design of the back of the shoe looks like a senior citizen earth shoe.....ugh!"
2.0,Zipper doesn’t stay up. Pants attract any & all lint. Not a fan but took the tag off like an idiot so here I am. Don’t buy these.
2.0,The angle of this nose ring made it impossible for me to use it.
2.0,I'm disappointed with the glasses. They are not exactly like the picture.
2.0,Too small but pretty
2.0,"I ordered small , fits almost like large"
2.0,They feel cheap and are a bit bigger than most glasses of the same shape. I ordered a single pair for $12 and it came in a nice sturdy case which I was impressed with so I went to order another pair  the day I got the first pair in the mail and the price had already gone up to $18 for a single pair. So I decided to get the combo 2 pairs for $21. Well they showed up and neither of them have the nice hard glasses case that the first one had. Which was the most impressive part of the first purchase. I’m disappointed. Not worth the price! Very cheap!
2.0,I wanted workout pants that were loose overall but tight in the waist to stay up.  These pants do not serve this purpose.
2.0,"Wear these arm sleeves all the time. These have a fun unique design, and will fit if you have huge arms, especially large biceps. For most women I know, much too large, and they really don't have any stretch.<br />Too bad, but product needs improvement, or at least offer range of sizes."
2.0,"Not so good quality. The bird actually broke the first time I wore it, even though I was being careful. The quality of the material and the colors definitely look better in the picture."
2.0,"These gloves are very warm. I haven't tested the waterproofing extensively, but they seem to be pretty adequate in that regard. Where these gloves fall short is their utility. They are too thick to really handle any fine motor tasks. I have to take them off to work with my hands. They also do not work with touch screens, as they are advertised. The first two fingers and thumb have a leather-like material on the fingertip, but do not work due to the material, the shape, or both."
2.0,Bottom on suspenders broke the 1 st time I wore them so I just cut the straps off.. problem solved.. runs really big though.. I’m a size 7/9 and bought a small and they were still slightly too big
2.0,"These things are huge, not practical at all for me. May not bother some people, but I hate having a large keychain. I have a chapstick holder currently that is unfortunately wearing out so I ordered these, but as soon as I saw them I knew there was no way I would be happy carrying one around on my keys. I will be returning them and finding something more practical"
2.0,Didn't work with my fossil Q founder
2.0,The stiching on the soul toe didn't complete the stiching on the left toe!
2.0,Cheap plastic material & inner fabric. Felt like something I would but from the dollar tree. Cute design but very cheaply made. Doubt it'll be able to keep kids warm without having to wear another jacket/layer of warm clothing underneath.
2.0,They were very cheap looking!  Would not order again.
2.0,"I could have downloaded a picture for nothing and did my own iron on. I expected, for the price a better quality."
2.0,"Broke after a week, not fixable. I was so sad."
2.0,Nice fabric but seam is right down the front. Pattern does not match. Weird looking. Shorter in front than back. Not great for $27. Ordered a M.
2.0,"Are these child sizes?? I even sized up anticipating that it would be small and it wasn’t just tight, it was itty bitty. Returned."
2.0,Pretty and could look nice but was received with a lot of tiny beads falling off.
2.0,"Earrings were super cute, but glue came undone on backing within first wear and stones fell out after only a few wears."
2.0,"Product runs very small, the large actually fits like a medium. I gave it away"
2.0,"This tracksuit was comfortable and fit great, but the fabric is so thin and the bottoms are completely see-though. Unfortunately this was returned."
2.0,"Nice, but broke after 1 week"
2.0,"The mask was comfortable on the ears.  However, the clear plastic fogs up and it hot when you wear it for more than 5 minutes."
2.0,Love the stone but the description says the chain is sterling.. it is not. Deceptive
2.0,Very pretty.. but only used them once and jewel f already fell off
2.0,XL is about US medium
2.0,"Look great, but run smaller than their size is."
2.0,So Tiny...
2.0,I returned this because it was just too small. I could not attach it to my purse strap.
2.0,It took a long time to ship and I was not very happy with the quality.
2.0,Hated the nose part made of plastic. Should’ve used regular glasses cushions instead.
2.0,This items was lost by the courier. It was delivered today.<br /><br />I like the earings.  The necklace is too light.  The gem is loose and it looks like it's gonna fall.  The bangles tread is showing. And I've waited for something not worth waiting for.
2.0,Pink color in the top does not match pink in the bottoms.
2.0,"This is a very cute shoe, however it offers not support. Good for looks but not much else, but you can say you got BEBE on your foot."
2.0,kind of small more like an earring for a child
2.0,"Wish I would've heeded the reviews that mention how thin these leggings are. I want to love them because the print is awesome but unfortunately you can see through them and the fit isn't quite right. I bought them for running, climbing, and working out the gym, but there is no way I can wear these in public."
2.0,The Small was too big and had a black stitching around the collar neck which is not showing in the photo displayed. Disappointed
2.0,Didn't love the color of these... They weren't yellow like the picture.  They almost looked like limes.
2.0,small enough to wear to work. They stick out of my nose a little.
2.0,Very cute but started changing colors after just two weeks.
2.0,Pilled up and is rough to wear and old looking now. Material not durable.
2.0,I wasn’t a fan of the material. Looks cheap.
2.0,"The bracelet itself is cute if you like small thin jewelry. Don't get fooled from the gold color, is not REAL gold. After several uses or bath with it, the gold color gets black. Doesn't look cute anymore. Recommended to use it without showering or applying body lotions, etc. to avoid the tar blackish color.  The evil eye are very tiny could barely seem them."
2.0,did not like it. its too much big in the for haed. do not fit well.
2.0,"Bought these as a gift and did not realize until I gave them that the socks were sewn so that his face was right on the seam of the sock, so you could barely even tell who it was... very poorly done, otherwise this would've been 5 stars.<br /><br />The person I gifted them to didn't want to give them up, otherwise I would've sent them back for a new pair."
2.0,It's a beautiful necklace. But the color fades real quick. I wore it 3x by the third use the color started to fade and the paint started to chip and looked black
2.0,way bigger than it looks
2.0,Way to small and very see through. This is very pretty but I won't wear it because I don't feel that people need to see my bra. So wasn't happy and sent it back. ☹
2.0,I liked the look for the three days it lasted. I was taking it off before bed and it scattered beads around my room
2.0,"Bought this for my 9 year old. He is tall but slim and it’s huge, size M. Still he insisted on keeping it. For the price I was expecting a lot more. This is not fleece lined, and the material itself is cheap and thin. It came with a shoelace draw string, which looked awful and broke in a day. I wouldn’t pay more than $10 for a top of this quality.  The colors have washed ok so far, but the white cuff band is dirty and stained after only a short time. Why out a white band on a black top?"
2.0,Definitely more like costume jewelry. Not what I was expecting.
2.0,The memory foam in the footbed is uneven in the right shoe and makes it uncomfortable.
2.0,"They look nice, but they came with a horrific odor. As soon as I opened the package the whole room reeked."
2.0,Way tooooooo big!
2.0,I wanted to like this dress but it’s entirely too big. Cute style if it were just a little less flowy.
2.0,"It's very small to size.  Construction is nice.  It's a bit polyester feeling but I'm not complaining about that, more that the size is prolly 1 size too small."
2.0,I’ll be returning it because it’s large…come ms down over my ears and looks odd
2.0,Returned immediately the fabric was awful and it was way too small.  You get what you pay for I guess
2.0,Shoes are waterproof
2.0,Worked the first couple weeks.  Velcro isn’t as good after that.  Not the best for a patrol belt.
2.0,Great material great price but  To long past the knees I could just  We're pants
2.0,I have a short torso and this shirt barely meets my pant line.
2.0,looks and feels cumbersome
2.0,"Great product, I've bought more than one but unfortunately my latest order arrived damaged while the packaging was OK. I'll be sending it back and ordering again"
2.0,I won’t be wearing this so I just wasted my money. It fits nicely but the quality is awful. It looks nothing like the photos. The black fabric is very thin and just cheap. The silver part is made of this cheap stretchy material idk the name of but I’d never wear in public.
2.0,These run small I even ordered bigger than my normal size.
2.0,The quality was ok not the best but not bad. It did take super long for shipping which was a tad annoying. It doesn't come in a nice wee box like other cufflings I've purchased have.
2.0,"I bought this bracelet for my son a month ago and after 2 wears, all the charms on one side broke and fell off! Very disappointed in this product!"
2.0,"I love the look and weight of this belt and its perfect for work, but its way too small.  There's no way the xl is an actual xl."
2.0,"I bought these pajamas for my son and they were very small. The length from the neck to the crotch was too short and uncomfortable. The fabric was soft, but because the size was so off, they weren’t wearable."
2.0,"Way too large for my size 7.5 shoes. After lacing them up in my pseudo-Keds, there was way too much lace left over."
2.0,"I bought this as a temporary replacement for my wedding ring. I have rubies on my original ring and that is a main factor in buying this ring to replace it.  I was very disappointed to open the ring and see PINK Rubies.  The ring itself is very comfortable and decent looking.  It also seems true to size.  But it is pink, not red as expected. ;-)"
2.0,The shirt would have been fine but it showed up with a stain on it.
2.0,Great shoe if it didn't twist my foot as I walked.
2.0,gave it to goodwill
2.0,"Too small, but pretty. I hope I lose weight."
2.0,Not cute on for me
2.0,Small pettie. Great just kid size
2.0,"Cute dress, but it's a thin fabric that you can see right through because it's white."
2.0,cute top but way TOO big.
2.0,The bag is beautiful but it’s not the bag i ordered and the Seller won’t respond back to me. So I’d be careful before purchasing
2.0,After reading the reviews I bought a medium. I am 5'9 and 155 pounds. It is a little short but looks fine. The dress is very light weight. It has absolutely no structure on the top. The sleeves are sewed on very poorly and every time I move my arms the top falls down. The dress is very pretty and if it was not for it falling down every time I move i would give it a higher rating.
2.0,Glasses were not very good quality. Ear  pieces  came  off first night. Then plastic kept breaking....
2.0,Size 14 with 38C and was exposed to the world lol. Neckline would work if worn with camisole underneath. Cheap feeling like polyester but cute pattern
2.0,I loved them in my first and second holes but when I got my third holes done I switched them over to the opal studs. I can not get it unclasped from my cartilage to change the jewelry. Trying to remove it severely irritated my cartilage piercing.
2.0,"The card slots don't have a bottom seam, so they can potentially slide all the way to the bottom of the lowest card slot. It makes cards a little difficult to get out - I have to strategically place them so that they are easier to slip in and out. Also, the coin zipper area is the same way - the pocket isn't put together in the best way, so change slides around quite a bit. That label &#34;Somlloh&#34;, by the way, is obnoxiously large and not easy to remove.<br /><br />The only reason I'm keeping it is because it holds a lot, and I haven't found a better alternative. I actually really don't like carrying a wallet, and wanted more of a bill fold that would be a good compromise when I didn't want to carry a purse. This isn't quite the answer, but I also can't keep using a business card holder, either. Back to the drawing board, I guess..."
2.0,"I wish I'd thought to read the reviews before I purchased these lights. I bought them to give out as a promotional item for our business at a local fall festival. They were all just mixed together in one bag and not packaged on cards as the description implied. I had ordered a total of 80 and only about half of them would even light up and out of the those 40 about 15 or 20 would only work if you mashed the sides together and held them. I would have sent them back but not worth the effort to recover the 16.00. Needless to say, I will read the reviews before ordering again."
2.0,"Had this product size M a few years ago, liked it. Since lost weight, ordered Size S this year. Unfortunately, they weren’t the same material anymore. Even with the smaller size, they are still feel lose, don’t feel the  compression working at all. So had to sent back."
2.0,"Does not fit like picture to big, square. And boxy. got a medium can’t tell front from back"
2.0,After the first wash it stretched out like crazy and it stayed that way.
2.0,Cheap necklace..it lost its .shine after just a couple times that I wore it..the butterfly better quality though..I wouldn't buy it the set again
2.0,It was chipped and holkow on the back. Generic material
2.0,"I liked the look online but in person not at all. They don’t fit as advertised, the fabric is cheap and they look weird on around the waist line. It’s clearly an elastic band sewn Looped through fabric. Instead of a fancier zipper enclosure, buttons or anything attractive. They felt like overpriced leggings. Do yourself a favor and go to Macy’s, Burlington etc. Try a thing but these. They are not worth the cost."
2.0,"The style of this dress is cute, however it runs big and requires a slip. The material isn’t the best quality. I’ve worn it with strapped sandals and a jean jacket. It’s baggy fit does makes it pretty comfortable."
2.0,"It sure is hard to imagine buying swimwear online, but having booked a trip after end-of-summer sales with no remaining inventory in local stores, that's what I did.  This one was nice enough, but all the folded fabric at the bust line looked bunchy and the saves at the side make it very uncomfortable.<br />It looks great on the model and not bad on me. It was reasonably priced, but I returned it."
2.0,"The dress was very large (I ordered a medium). The material felt like a bed sheet. The colors were vibrant, however. I might have liked it if the sizing was correct because the price was appropriate for the product."
2.0,Not a very thick case like I thought
2.0,Too small and makes butt look weird
2.0,"The color was exactly as described and the price was reasonable.  Unfortunately, I can only give these 2 stars as they only last me 2 months."
2.0,Warning- I think these run big. I went according to the size that my children typically wear and even in my kiddo with chunky flat feet the size down that I bought for my other son was still too big. The Velcro adjustable straps don't allow for a snug enough fit and their feet still pop out. I will be returning .
2.0,Has a very strong odor
2.0,"The zipper broke on the right hand glove after two rides. I use them for commuting on my bike to work. They are fairly warm and look and work very nice, just wish the zipper was better."
2.0,Looked better in the picture dose not fit a head size above 60cm
2.0,Well they're well made by extremely small. I wear a medium size and these would maybe fit a child .
2.0,Broke within first week.
2.0,Cute but very flimsy. Broke a few days after I bought them.
2.0,"Very cute pajama set- son loves the look. Bottoms are cozy but the plastic at the seams between the neckline and arm is so scratchy and uncomfortable, he can’t wear them."
2.0,"Ok, the thought of this Kfubuo dress was fantastic. In my mind, I saw myself wearing this for picnics or BBQs. Unfortunately, the thought didn’t meet the reality. This dress was very “ill-fitting” on me. I looked pregnant even after adjusting the straps! Ironically, I ordered up because I feared that the top would be too tight, especially considering the style. The dress is tri-colored (cream, army green and eggplant) and sleeveless. The material is thin and plain. To be honest, I looked awful. It was so bad that I didn’t want to keep it to even wear around the house or to be.  With that being said, I returned this dress and would not recommend it."
2.0,Too cheap looking & gaudy in person. Item was returned.
2.0,I didn’t like the cut when I wore it. It does not have a nice silhouette but the material is really good
2.0,"Um so the bottom jewels color came off it is now a clear crystal, what the heck I've only had it for less than a month. 👎🏻"
2.0,Item DOES NOT work with the Fenix 3 HR with the heart rate monitor on the back of the watch. The item is ok. Maybe I can use it on something else. Item description needs to be more clear or with pictures that show the back of the watch and how the band will be ON the watch. THIS band covers the back of the watch making the heart rate monitor useless.
2.0,The pattern is beautiful but unfortunately it runs about two sizes too small.
2.0,I bought this twice. The main charm fell off both times. Poorly made.
2.0,Cheap lol it's exactly what it's worth
2.0,"Oddly constructed. I returned it and bought a similar, more expensive version, which was perfect."
2.0,Really awkward fit.  Had to return this shirt.
2.0,Too short and would have been perfect if they were just  a few inches longer so the tops did not show when sitting down.
2.0,didn't realize this was one time use
2.0,I loved 🥰 the dress but it was to small😔🥺
2.0,Cute but was too big
2.0,"Huele muy mal, esta mal terminado y tiene la etiqueta pegada por fuera."
2.0,very cute but fit way to big
2.0,"This is not flattering in the slightest, especially from the back. I am 5’4 and it felt too short and much too wide with so many extra fabric. I would not recommend this item."
2.0,Product was extremly long and the chest area was too small
2.0,Ordered this dress for a party. Color shown was a dark grey. But when dress arrived it was a light grey.
2.0,These are BRIGHT RED like Rudolph's nose.  My 2nd attempt with this seller.  Neither purchase was described or pictured color.
2.0,These are so pretty-and the fabric is great----but they are going down fast-one pair had a defect  there is a line of cuts along the bottom of them--razor? another pair is starting to fray along the lace. Really wish they were better quality-would have bought more!
2.0,Nothing how it looks
2.0,These are not the risk tok leggings. Similar but not quite. Also see thru when stretched. Way to long for me.
2.0,"This watch arrived with a dead battery.  I was promptly given a refund, so I'm not dinging the seller, just this particular item,"
2.0,Dress is beautiful but fits like a shirt
2.0,"Very nice coat, but the XXL fit more like a L. Fits my wife nicely. Instead of buttons, the fasteners are similar to small metal bra hooks."
2.0,Just got these today and thought I was going to have to get the grease. The area in the calves was way too tight.  I ordered a half size down as recommended and there was plenty of toe room but there's no way to expand the calf area. I didn't think I had big calves but now I'm beginning reevaluate my calf-perception. The color and style are cute but unfortunately these are being returned.
2.0,Not the color I like Maxie in China . I was expecting made in Italy bcause is a rayban
2.0,"Waist is large sized, but the shorts are too small in the hips. Cut of the shorts is incredibly low.<br />The waist  band on the shorts has zero give around the hios, and are a low rise cut. While the Top part is stretchy. Makes for a very weird fit."
2.0,"Cute costume. However, we were sent the wrong size. When I went to get another and return this one I saw they were no longer in stock. The pants come up super short, about 6 in. So, boots are a must! Overall, cute costume. Just wish we would have got the size we ordered."
2.0,"was way too small, probably wouldn't even fit a baby's toe!!"
2.0,"The thin silicone itself really isn't enough to disperse the pressure from the straps.  If some gel, within the silicone was present, it would make a big difference.  Not worth the money."
2.0,Poor quality and was torn at the seem
2.0,The picture for this outfit really looks good. Can't complain about that. My item was delivered yesterday and it have a hole in the pants leg. This made me upset. Can't even return cause I from trinidad.. my son love it and it fit well but that hole turned me away
2.0,"**UPDATE**<br />I wore this for several hours the other night for the first time.  Although it's warm and very comfortable, there were dozens of little obnoxious puffs of fabric all over my head, neck and shirt.  Took me an hour to pick the stupid things off.  The fabric is not durable at all.<br /><br />** ORIGINAL**<br /><br />The hat is lightweight and warm.  It will serve its purpose."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:b6095929f71cf9b5c8bc388414041f14]] They are way to big the hoop does not hug or even touch the ear.
2.0,Ring snags on clothing and other daily things.
2.0,"Warm hat, but the bottle are super small and hardly hold the mask in place. It also causes the mask to sit higher than it should. Having my mask jump up into my eyes consistently is very annoying. I have to wear two masks for 10hrs a day at work (outside). I guess I was wishing for too much at suck a low cost."
2.0,"Item fit very weird across my chest, cutting boobs in half.  it did match the photo, bud did not fit as expeced."
2.0,Shirt is more of a thin t-shirt rather than a sweatshirt
2.0,"The size is accurate, but I was hoping for something more. the material is real thin and the seems are quite messy. I doubt I would buy it again."
2.0,The riding pants are more like regular pants than I was expecting. The pockets would not be suitable for riding in my opinion.
2.0,Real cute but package was delivered to the wrong house
2.0,"This brought me back to middle school, static cling and all. Returned the item. Also, it was bright red, not the ruby color as shown"
2.0,Faded On everything my hands from handling them my legs when i wore them
2.0,"I was initially very pleased with these shoes. They are made well and look cool.  My 8 year old loves them, but after only a handful of times wearing them, one shoe won't light up. We've tried charging them multiple times but nothing seems to fix the problem. I want to order more but maybe from another company."
2.0,This is WAY too short to be a dress. Barely covers my butt. Would be a cute dress if it was longer or a cute top if it was shorter but it’s a weird length in between. Not a fan.
2.0,Very cheaply priced and made
2.0,dont like the quality of the shirt.  Can see my skin color a nipples which is not good.  Went to mens wearhouse and bought something much better.  the cumber-bun and buttons were fine.
2.0,Way too small and I ordered my correct size.
2.0,"They didnt work for me, too narrow even though they are listed as wide, they were not wide at all."
2.0,It's a children's large
2.0,I live feel if fabric and style.  Runs very small!!!
2.0,"First time I used it it broke. When to adjust the way the necklace was sitting on my neck, gently moved and and the clip just broke right off. I’m not sure if the rest of the pack is going g to do the same or it this one was defective. Haven’t tried the other one because I don’t wear jewelry on a day to day basis and also clbecause I don’t want to loss my jewelry that I’ll be using with it."
2.0,This belt is nice looking etc but to me it’s made more for looks. This is my belt after a week or so it probably won’t make it another week.
2.0,cute but very cheap looking
2.0,"These shoes are all plastic, even on the inside. I've never seen shoes made like this.<br />Shipping took about 3 1/2 months and when I received the shoes, the remote was missing. So now we can't even turn them on. Will be returning these. Buy local so you get what you pay for."
2.0,I didn’t like that it was too silky and hot and the seems were off and messy
2.0,Material is very thin. Looks and feels more like pjs
2.0,I have been catfished I would pay $10 for this dress it is very over priced it feels like I am wearing a cheep tarp and it has no form to it very uncomfortable I would not recommend
2.0,"Bought two bags for a trip to a theme park for a week. Started falling apart at Day 3 at the stitching- one at the strap that holds the buckle, and the other at the base of the main strap. Disappointing."
2.0,"The large is a size 6. That’s the largest size. 🙄 it was a cute cut, and a nice color, though the fabric was painfully cheap. Literally, it scrubbed me skin shimmying into. 2 stars cuz this would look good on a size 2."
2.0,I turn rusty in 2days
2.0,Supposed to say “It’s On Like Donkey Kong”<br />But instead it says “It’s O Like Donkey Kong”.<br />Disappointed.
2.0,They ravel and were very thin.  Plus you couldn't even tell designs on at least 3 pair.
2.0,"The fabric is nice, sleeve length great. Just not as long as I thought. I am 5'10&#34; and it fits like a flowy long shirt, which was not what I was looking for. And the process of returning, is not even worth the headache. If you are taller, not proper dress length."
2.0,"I am a big Patricia Nash bag fan, and have several of her purses.  This one was a disappointment and I returned it because the clasp was so tight it was really difficult to open."
2.0,It's comfy like most sweatshirts but it is not the same pink that is shown.
2.0,I ordered a size small and I got a large..
2.0,"Poor quality, I've had these a couple of months and sadly they did not hold up well to regular wash and wear."
2.0,"Well that was a surprise, the color in the picture shows pastels for the sky and VW and darker for the word tropical but the colors are very different. The sky and VW are very bold colors and the world tropical is more of a pastel. It’s still cute but not we expected and wanted."
2.0,The top part was way too low and would require a tank underneath.
2.0,I like that it won't change colors bease it's all plastic ....but then it keeps twisting when I wear it :/
2.0,Didn't look.as nice as I thought
2.0,"Not what I expected, it’s completely open in the front and it doesn’t have enough material to cover you well.  Would work for the beach."
2.0,"Super cute, but they arrived with scratches all over the lens:( so disappointed."
2.0,Bought in October 2022. It is now February 2023. Watch has quit self winding. Big disappointment.
2.0,There is no button to push for putting the umbrella up. It folds up poorly. It is not windproof.  Very disappointed.
2.0,Band too short
2.0,Cheap material! Not impressed!
2.0,pockets are way to shallow. Contents fall out of the pockets when you sit down.
2.0,"The pattern on the dress was beautiful, but the material was extremely thin. I bought a small and it ended up being huge on me so I’ll be returning. Size down if you order!"
2.0,The dress is HUGE!
2.0,I have only had this purse for a month and it is showing signs of wear. It has discoloration on the handles. Yesterday the zipper pull broke--the part you pull and the ring on the slide that holds the pull came clear off too.
2.0,Irritated my girls' ears and there are many visible &#34;holes&#34; lacking bling.
2.0,"I ordered an XXXL for my daughter.  She's a large in America and 5'3, 120lbs.  The top was super tight and the bottoma were really long.  It's like they didn't even look at the sizes when they packed it.  Definitely returning the item and ordering from someone else."
2.0,"Get a size bigger. Fits perfect at first. When I start to wash it the second time I used it, I noticed that the bib is getting loose.<br />Jersey and shorts fit didn’t change, only the bib."
2.0,"These glasses broke within the first month of having them. However, the product is described well. Just not worth for the simple reason that they break easy"
2.0,This runs so small and it's not really that well made the mesh kind of gaps.  As everyone said order up several sizes I got a 3XXX  for my size 8/10 M/L usual size.  It fit but the sleeves were short.
2.0,"Reasons why I returned it: material was cheaply thin, runs small, I thought the dress would show my thighs like the model in the photo, but the front part comes well below the knee (I'm 5'8), the green isn't as dark as I had hoped, the boob part was awkward and it simply looked unflattering on me. The return was really simple though and Amazon returned my money surprisingly fast."
2.0,"The the Wristology brand watches. However this watch I returned after purchase. In photo it appears to have white or silver hour markings, but when it arrived the hour markings are in black. VERY hard to tell the time."
2.0,"I ordered in white, but they came in black, paperwork said I ordered black. They were still usable I just had to place them in a different spot."
2.0,I bought this bhai bhabhi rakhi and lumba set only for the lumba with beautiful kaudiyas.<br /><br />But As seen in the photo the kaudiyas/stones are patched with black spots all over not something you wear as you can get allergic reaction. It looked like old lumba.  The rakhi is ok not very fancy anyway. You can get for a dollar or 2 in store.  But I paid the money for the lumba which is not at all appealing.<br /><br />I would not recommend but this set.
2.0,"1st review ever. Love the material and fast delivery. Once it was open it read &#34;best gift ever&#34;. Keeping it because it's still adorable, just wanted what I paid for."
2.0,"Im gonna return this item, colors are not as vibrant as in the pictures.. I got a purple one, and too dissaponited"
2.0,This product seemed extremely cheap. The first time I tried the bracelet on it broke.
2.0,"The little clip that holds the band to the Fitbit keeps releasing and I keep finding my Fitbit flying off my hand. Not for very active people. Also there is an aesthetic flaw, after you put it on your wrist, the part that is visible ends up being two tone on the grey band. Wanted one color on the outside"
2.0,"The fabric quality is super thin, but what really got me, was that the seams were ready falling apart right out of the package! I will be returning"
2.0,Not impressed I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,It's well made. I expected it to cover my lower neck better. To fit under the color of a shirt. It's not long enough
2.0,They were the wrong size
2.0,"Didn't fix my face properly  had to sew bottom  yo avoid having a gap, material not the best.  Again, sure wished we made stuff in America, where quality would be much better than what China is willing to provide.  China will be our undoing."
2.0,"FINALLY got this skirt a month and a half after I bought it, and I tried it on, and it would barely go up past my knees! My 12 yo daughter fit in it just fine, but she's not into the goth look like I am, so I'm sending this crap back... Sucks, cause it's a cool looking, well made skirt, but beware the size chart fits children."
2.0,"Well, the graphics were fuzzy and not clear at all and the quality was a 2 out of 5. I returned it. It looks very cheap looking"
2.0,Sadly I ordered a size up to make sure would fit and can three sizes to small.<br />Its beautiful but sadly will have to be returned.
2.0,"I bought these for my son,who is a big man.  I thought they would be large enough, but they were way, way too small.  I am very petite, yet they were incredibly tight on me as well.  I thought they'd help stabilize my wrists, so I put them on.  Within minutes my circulation was cut off & I was breaking out in a rash.  The fabric is very coarse.  The only reason I didn't give them one star is that they are warm as advertised, they do have thumbholes and they're definitely black."
2.0,Second one. This one also has brand name riveted on crooked across the front of the bag and I was charged a higher price to replace it. I needed it for a trip or would have returned this one too.
2.0,"For this price,you should just pass.The text was super small.If the text was larger and covered more of the shirt then it woulda looked better.I returned it the same day I got it.Pissed cause I wanted this shirt."
2.0,It runs small and cups run big. The size in the bra was rewritten in ink. Should have known there was an issue. Very pretty but unwearable.
2.0,"product arrived on time, however size was much smaller than expected. size was more like a M rather than size actually ordered"
2.0,Mask looks great! Not made for comfort or long usage. Strap will not last multiple off and on movement if planning to wear.
2.0,"Worn it every day for 2 months and have gotten great compliments. Now, it is starting to turn my wrist green when I wear it, so can't use it anymore. I  haven't gotten it wet. Such a shame."
2.0,Starches out to fast.
2.0,"First off, I want to clarify that I am reviewing the black ""Making Magic Happen"" two piece sweatsuit with white stripes. There seems to be more than one product being discussed in this review section. The fabric in the product description claims this is a cotton polyester blend. However, you can tell just by the feel and the sheen of the fabric that clearly that is not the case, and as you can see in my photos, it is labeled as 100% polyester. It is also super thin, check out my photo, you can clearly see my hand through the fabric, it is thinner than any cheap t-shirt I own! Fabric aside, this runs small. I ordered a large because I intended to wear these as pjs and wanted them roomy. I am usually a size medium/large. I am pear shaped 8 on top, 10 on bottom. The top fits fine, but the waistband elastic on the pants is uncomfortably tight and the thighs cling a bit too much for my liking. I am all around disappointed in the poor quality, the tight fit and the misrepresentation of the fabric content. I would pass on these, they are just not worth the money!"
2.0,Double sided tape was not sticky and using glue on hand did not work either.
2.0,Size 3XL is more like a size 10 in kids. Way off in the sizing
2.0,Too Loose ~ It used to be Slim Fit
2.0,"It’s bigger and longer then I anticipated. Its not as delicate looking as it looks in the picture. It’s rather cheap looking in person, but I guess it’s to be expected for $10"
2.0,Not as expected but its ok .
2.0,Smaller than expected and had very thin fabric.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this dress! I have a long torso for my height but the waist on this dress went nearly down to my hips! If I pulled it up to sit at my natural waist it ballooned out and was just overall unflattering. When the waist was sitting where it should the skirt also became a little shorter than I prefer, skimming my ankles rather than the tops of my feet."
2.0,I did not particularly care for the material it was kind of thin. I had ordered other dresses from a different vendor and thought that the material would be the same. It just was not for me.
2.0,"Forwhat I paid, the band shouldn't be wrinkling like wet cardboard. The only reason it got any starts is because the rose gold matched nicely and the metal doesn't seem to be scratching or peeling. And I couldn't find another band that had rose gold accessories."
2.0,The concept was fantastic at first. Really cool to look at. Had to modify a stand for it because you can only hand it the way it comes. it just stopped working. Lights on but no more motion
2.0,"I love the glasses, and for 8 bucks they are a steal.  But, the ad says they come with a soft protective pouch.  They do not."
2.0,Thought I followed the Size Chart Correctly but it was way too big and I was hoping the material would have been a more soft cottony feel but wasn't
2.0,Very small in the pelvis.
2.0,"I bought this item hoping for a cute summer shirt. I usually wear a size 1X to XL. The XL size chart says it is a size 8 so I went for an XXL. The fit is really weird. It is extremely wide and short! If I lift my arms, my tummy shows and it adds a lot of unwanted width. The fabric is also very heavy. It is soft but feels like an old school polyester in weight.  Color is nice and the lace is nice and seems to be a good quality."
2.0,Feel like paper. Great for maybe one or two wears but look very poorly constructed.
2.0,"TOO SMALL ""NOT FOR MEN""<br />I bought them for my hubby, Colorado weather is so funny acting, I'm born and raised,  These gloves are too small and the screen touch isn't worth it. Wish I could say they was warm but I can't."
2.0,Not really well put together and beads are obviously stained. Matter of time until bled!
2.0,Fabric is not cotton T-shirt material.  It feels very synthetic (like polyester).  Runs somewhat small.  Order one size larger than you think you should.  Gave this product 2 stars for the cute styling.  Otherwise it is undersized and sketchy quality fabric.
2.0,Shorts too small and shirt bigger. The decal in the shirt looks like the kind that washes off and falls apart after the first wash. 😬
2.0,Very soft but holes sprouted after only one wear. At least they were cheaper than LLR which also get holes.
2.0,"These pants are pretty cheap feeling. The elastic band is narrow and not sewed down either (so it can twist around). They are also majourly small, so order several sizes up (I ordered a full-size up!). Returning."
2.0,looks very cheap did not like it
2.0,"It’s a beautiful elegant watch. I had wanted it in different colors, How ever the directions are in Chinese only and I’m not able too set watch as there’s no stem."
2.0,Looks much bigger than it actually is. Runs small.<br />It doesn't lay right as well.
2.0,"Sandals are heavy to walk in. Cute style, but not comfortable."
2.0,Not as viewed
2.0,It was too small for me and I order a x-large. This shirt fits my little sister more than me. The colors was good otherwise.
2.0,"Loved color & quality, but runs small. It fis like a glove. My husbands says it's too tight.<br />Dress is sized 14/16 & XXL, but fits like a 12.<br />Also, left sleeve extremely tight.  Nothing's wrong with my left arm. I never have had this problem before. So this is an obvious defect, besides the fact that it runs small."
2.0,The string unravelled after only wearing it a couple of times.
2.0,"This was exactly what I was looking for, but I was hoping for a looser fit, so I ordered a size medium. The medium is still too small and now I wish I ordered a large or a different item altogether. I just don't want farmer's tan while jogging anymore :/"
2.0,I was disappointed because one wire was bent correctly and the other was straight across and the end of it was bent up.  Also on there a piece of the gold plating was chipped off in the middle of the wire.  I think someone should check items before they are shipped out! 🙁.  Needless to say I’m sending them back.
2.0,it’s cute but it runs kinda small im a 32D. The back is very see through and it’s too cropped but it’s probably because of my boobs.
2.0,This item is of poor quality material because it's stiff. It hurts the waste because it doesn't been. L
2.0,Cute little handbag.  Poor quality and material.  The chain used for shoulder is brutal on your shoulder muscle.  Product only last about two months before it started falling apart.
2.0,Nice sweater for my grandpa but it was damaged it has a black dot very noticeable on the front. Return and exchange hopefully the next will be better
2.0,"Not as expected, Insole has some kind of  Uncomfortable bubbles when walking."
2.0,"Too small to fit glasses,they should make the end rubber little bit bigger so it will fit on both reading glass and sunglasses."
2.0,"I dont usually write reviews but, Id hate for someone to run into the same issue we ran into. The shirts are nice, light weight, and the material is comfortable. BUT.. beware the sizes run very small.<br /> I bought these as part of my boys back to school outfits. When we buy clothes at Family Dollar they both fit into a size 14 shirt. (The red shirt pictured). To play it safe, we took their measurements before ordering. I even sized up because, I'd rather the shirts be too big than too small. We ordered a 5 pack of size L ( Camo shirt) and a 5 pack of size XL (Gray shirt). The Large are basically the same size, even a bit larger than the XL. The size chart said the L should be the equivalent of size 12-14, its not. The XL is closer to a size 12-14 but, still smaller than the size 14 shirt that I just got from Family Dollar.<br /><br />If your child usually fits into a size 10-12 order the L or XL. Not the best fit for kids in US size 14 or larger.<br /><br />Personally, I will not be purchasing from this company again."
2.0,Good glasses terrible manufacturing process... These are indeed polarized l.. But i recieved them with a missing screw on the part that folds so i contacted them great customer service tey sent out a replacement. But it was three times with the same manufacturing error so i just took the screws frok the replacements and now i have two frames and one pair of glasses that work
2.0,"even though u can adjust, its to small"
2.0,Dress runs bigger than thought and arms are super tight. The material is horrible and cheaply made. Cannot even wear it for a cover-up
2.0,Poor quality. Use for everyday around house work. Not to wear out of home.
2.0,I purchased these shoes because Vionics has a reputation for being great shoes for people with plantar fasciitis. But these shoes did not fit well at all! The straps were too big and hard to adjust and the shoe bed did not provide good arch support.
2.0,"like the colors, just doesn't fit. runs small you should tell people this. I also need a Q R code to return it. I have already been to Koln's and couldn't return it without the Q R code. You might put this in with the order along with directions on how to return items. This was my first order and I had NO idea how to go about returning it my neighbor had to tell me, if I had known about the Q R code, one trip would have done it. Now I have to return. Don't know if I will order again, to much problems."
2.0,"I was not expecting the three hats to be three different sizes. They seem okay in quality, but I would expect them to be all the same size...otherwise what's the point?"
2.0,I love the look of these gloves but the loop for your finger ripped first time I wore them
2.0,I really wanted to like these. Read the reviews and I did size up to a 2xl. Got them quick. Tried them on and flattened my booty. Couldn't even close the side buttons. I guess these are not meant for ladies with hips. :(
2.0,too small-crap
2.0,Size not consistent with item description. Size may be a junior plus but is definitely not a women''s plus.
2.0,Shipped fast but the studs aren't the greatest. The jewels don't want stay in the shaft. It's like the hole they fit in was bore too big. But they are cheap so you get what you pay for.
2.0,"This band is cute for the price, you’re getting what you paid for. But, extremely difficult to put on/off your watch!! It jams as you attempt to slide it into place and nearly impossible to take off to switch bands. Pushing the button down on the back of your watch does nothing. I had the fear of breaking my watch, I plan on returning. If you don’t plan on switching bands, this would be great for you."
2.0,"Very cute but did not hold up. It has a very short fit, even when sizing up. The material pilled very quickly so we were not able to use it for long. Very warm and stylish, though."
2.0,"Run small, one of  the 3 was longer than the others"
2.0,My husband has another Tilley hat (LTM6 Airflo Hat) and loves it. It's very high quality and looks great.  But this one?  nope.  It was shipped flattened out in a box.  The fabric is flimsy and the fit is way too small.  Had to return it.
2.0,"I liked the look of these, but they reflected back a lot of glare, preventing others from seeing my eyes during video calls.  Also, the side ear piece broke after a few days ago, so they only lasted 6 months, despite me wearing them at my desk almost exclusively at my desk only, so they were handled quite gently.<br /><br />I won't re-purchase for those 2 reasons."
2.0,"I want to love this dress.  First, it runs super big.  I am 5 foot and 130 pounds and I usually wear a medium but I needed and Xsmall in this and it was still super big and required some adjusting.  Second, the dress is comfortable and soft but the fabric is poor quality.  I wore this for a few hours to a wedding and noticed multiple holes once I took it off.  If you are looking for a dress you can wear once and then never be able to wear again, this is the one.  It's a shame because i love the pattern and style."
2.0,"If your big chested, I don’t recommend these."
2.0,"the quality were awful, the should were too small, the ruffle do not stand up, it just lay flat"
2.0,I bought these as a gift and was told the elastic cuff is so tight the slipper has to be much to large in order to even get them on. They are really cute though
2.0,"I bought these shorts for my 10 year old daughter who normally where’s a 12 but I ordered her a size 16 because they do run small. My problem with this product is that when I opened the bag to make sure they would fit I found stains on the front right side of the shorts along with a pen mark and what looks like greese stain on the top part of the overalls . The shorts are cute but very disappointed that they came dirty like that! I half a mind to send them back but my daughter likes them, so I’ll just try and take the stains out myself I guess."
2.0,"This dress looks amazing on the model. It looks as though it would flatter my figure but I am petite, so bought in my size I was swimming in it and it was quite long. I looked rather grannyish in it. Too bad too because like others said it's a very well made dress for that money!"
2.0,Size does not match description. Skin tight.
2.0,Fell apart way too soon
2.0,"Holy cow- my wife had me order this because she likes the slim fit stuff.  I pulled it out of the packaging and it smelled as though it were straight from a chemical factory with rat problems.  Whoa, I tried to put it on, but it wreaked so bad that all I had time to notice was that it felt tight through the shoulders and that was without buttoning anything up.  Anyway, have no idea if the stench is an issue with this manufacturer, I'd assume not and it will probably go away with washing, but I had bought 4 XLT and it was still too small.  I'm 6'6&#34; weigh about 215 lbs.  I'm slender with a somewhat (not excessively so) muscular build.  Anyway, had free returns, so at least that was a positive.  Hopefully the stench was a one time mishap on their part."
2.0,"Please refund my $$ and send the info on returning the product. The coat is attractive &, if I was a Barbie doll & not plus size, it might fit. By the way, I already sent this in."
2.0,"EDITED 5/8/21: I picked up this mask for the first time in weeks, and the straps are MELTING! I had black residue on my hands. The straps are stretched out of shape. It has been sitting on my dashboard as a display. I would not buy this mask!<br /><br />I bought this mask, of course, because I fly a drone professionally. It is very comfortable and fits my face nicely. Being able to adjust the fit is a great feature. it is well made and has a pocket for a filter. Five filters come with the mask and bought 10 more so I wouldn't have to worry about it for a while.<br /><br />Not everyone is going to want a drone mask, but they offer many alternatives as well."
2.0,The Watch is decent but cant read it in the dark bc light is junk. Also numbers are pretty small and band is junk. The band keeps breaking.  If they fixed these problems it would be solid
2.0,"Cheap, flimsy. Beginning to change color."
2.0,Bottom fit okay but top was extremely large
2.0,"The two tops are somewhat different in size.  The white is larger around, but shorter than the blue, they are too thin to be worn separately.  They are better worn together, but both somewhat large.  I would not buy them again because I am not thrilled with the fit or the look, but they are functional and just OK."
2.0,"These feel too cheap. I wanted to sell them as cheap alternatives for regular aviators, but this won't do the trick. The mirror effect looks like a kid toy. Though they came really nice packed. I still have many of them left because people say they look to dark with them on. Its true. I can't chitchat that."
2.0,My bf wanted this. It's so weird. Hes a big muscular guy and this 3x is more like a 2x hadva half.  The material feels like it's from china...cheap... lame
2.0,I returned this dress because the arm holes were huge!  It didn't even help to wear a tank top under it.
2.0,Didn’t have anything identifying back or front. I usually like these type of neck designs however this one was awkward and didn’t lay right. Maybe it was the pattern not being consistent.  Also had 2 areas where the knit material had visible snags.
2.0,Ran way to small!
2.0,To clingy and really not my style.
2.0,"The packaging had me so impressed until I opened it, the print on the wood was double stamped. Was NOT of great quality so much I told my sons to just put it on a keychain but do not put anything on it because of the quality. Bummed because I wanted something my sons could keep for longer that “a week” even at $7 I think for the sturdiness that was way to much."
2.0,They run a little small. Especially if you lift weights in them then your nipple is exposed.
2.0,"Beading kept falling off throughout the night.  Not too happy with purchase, but it was short notice needed and matched perfectly with outfit."
2.0,"First the good news!  The product came in a delightful silver metal can. So my first impressions were very good. An added bonus that I could use in the future.<br /><br />Then the bad news. When I ordered this product, I thought the description stated that it would charge the Fitbit Charge and Charge HR, which I have the latter. (I since I just had the HR, I assumed that they use the same connector, I was wrong!) Within moments after taking it out of the metal tin, I noticed that this was not one that would work for my Fitbit. When I went to write this review, I looked at the description again, and it did not show that it would fit the Charge HR, I though that I made a mistake. But then I read some of the other reviews and it appears others saw the same description as I had originally. So I’m glad that the description is correct now, but this doesn’t allow me to do a complete review. So the warning is: **if you have the Fitbit Charge HR – this product will not work for you! **<br /><br />With that being said, I cannot evaluate if the product actually works with a Fitbit Charge, but I can say that the charger does look and feel like it would be a good product.<br /><br />I purchased this product to review at a discount, however my review is 100% my own honest opinion and in no way influenced by the discount that I received. If this review has helped you make a decision about this product, please hit the &#34;Yes&#34; button below. Thank you."
2.0,The pads are sewn in but the yellow slightly see through so you can easily see the pads. Looks a little weird
2.0,"Violet was pretty, but the design is very unflattering. Sleeves were only 3/4 length.  Skirt not as full as I like. Nice fabric."
2.0,They run small and are thin . Cut your toe nails or these are a rip
2.0,The logo is crooked and not centered and it is very obvious when wearing
2.0,Was not what  I  expecte.d
2.0,Th o.o small
2.0,Short in the torso. Too small for a 12 year old in the 50th percentile.
2.0,Terrible quality fabric - doesn't flow nearly as well as the pictures imply and the fabric creases and wrinkles in a really ugly and obvious way.
2.0,"Won't stay on my face, way to big,"
2.0,It's comfortable but it's about 3 sizes too big. I normally wear an extra large so I ordered a large because the description says runs big. It should say how big! I had to tie it in the front and the back to give it some shape. The cut is square. Looks NOTHING like the photo. I should have tried it on before going on vacation. #disappointed.
2.0,It broke after wearing it twice.
2.0,returned all for refund
2.0,These hats are so cute but the small/med is still too large.
2.0,Had to resew the mitten part...
2.0,Sizing is very off on these. Would go at least 2 sizes larger than you normally buy.
2.0,It looks nice but it’s completely see through!!! Not what I had expected at all
2.0,I'm very happy with the way the ring looks. The stone colors change just like it shows in the pictures the only thing is it doesn't come with a chart to tell you what the colors mean. Also had my name engraved on the inside that looks really nice so overall I'm very happy with this little ring. When I initially made this post I was happy with the rain but as you can see in the third picture the the stone has started to fade away and I have only worn it two times... Edit.. I just received the replacement ring for the initial ring that I bought and it looks perfect it came within a reasonable amount of time so I'm happy once again.
2.0,Material too thin. Looks more for show than functionality. I will reinforce the tie strings before I begin to use.
2.0,"Granted I'm a miniscule 26"" band size, so this is nothing new when bra shopping, but fair warning that if you're petite: the smallest size this bralette offers will not cut it. The cups were decent shape and size but the band hung off of me. The back clasps was huge and heavy while the band itself is just made of thin lace, making the clasp hang and twist uncomfortably. If I had a larger rib cage it perhaps it would have stretched out and laid flat, but the back clasp is still so huge and heavy that I don't think it would be comfortable.<br />Where can I get cute bralettes like this for a lil lady like me?"
2.0,poor fit; waistband was a &#34;waste&#34;
2.0,"I was not happy with the quality of this watch and there were rhinestones missing, the watch was loose in a box with barely any protection. With that being said, customer service was amazing and refunded me with NO hassle and No extra shipping or restocking fees."
2.0,"I am 5'2&#34; 138 lbs and the medium was somewhat large.  This dress is intended to hug your curves and if it is the slightest bit big, it looks quite unflattering like wearing a bag."
2.0,"I really like tgis purse, it's served its purpose. The only thing is the zippers are fragile and break easy. The zippers on the back where the coins go broke immediately ."
2.0,These do not look like freshwater baroque pearls. The clasps seem to be scarred. I thought this may be a used set. The seal on the jewelry box was cut-someone else opened it before me.
2.0,I ended up getting different slippers these fall off my feet
2.0,Way too small. The skirt part puffed out too which was strange. I returned it.
2.0,"Giving a 2 star because when I received the dress it was torn on the side,other than that it's a beautiful dress"
2.0,Product runs small. Company needs to make bigger sizes
2.0,Pretty color and it looks great on others in their pictures but not a great fit if you are shorter or have a short torso. Also had some odd spots/ discoloring. Returned
2.0,"The cord came loose first day I wore it, now the turtles are very loose and I don't know how to fix it, I would like a replacement bracelet but I don't know how to do it, so if the seller reads this can you please send me a replacement bracelet, I will send mine back to you in the package you send me with new bracelet, thank you very much. I hope you read this cause I really would love to wear this bracelet, its so beautiful. Thanks again"
2.0,I didn't expect much for the money. It's an ok hat. I rated it low because the band is not leather but cheesy synthetic and it came shipped in a bag. Apparently crushable doesn't mean indestructible. Even with steam there are some permanent wrinkles.
2.0,"Dress looks nice on the model, but I looked like a clown in it.  Return and refund were easy."
2.0,"My hat came folded in half and now there is a crease in the middle of the brim and will not come out the hat is supposed to be straight by folding it the brim was broken and flops down on both sides,  a relative order the same hat and was  in perfect shape , I am very DISAPPOINTED with the way the hat was shipped folded"
2.0,The arms did not fit me but nice shirt
2.0,"The first day I went to wear my bracelet the little gray tassel came off. The quality of this bracelet isn't very good. Unfortunately, the little clasps that hold the bracelet together wasn't fully clasped and it all fell apart. However, if you want to take the time into adjusting and making sure all the clasps are tight and held together and are very careful wearing this particular bracelet than go for it. It is a very cute bracelet and I loved it while it lasted for the 3 whole days I had it. :("
2.0,It It’s a little tight
2.0,"My wife likes the watch. It works well and looks good on the top. But, the back of the face looks like rust??"
2.0,"Super comfy, nice fabric, washes well, came with holes in pockets. Pockets weren’t sewn shut when it was made."
2.0,Granted the hoodie still looks cool. But there was definitely some photoshop used to make this hoodie looks super 3D. Still like it but looks nothing like the photo.
2.0,"We love the sparkle, but the elastic on these shoes broke after the first time my daughter wore them. Extremely disappointed. :("
2.0,"I’ve had this item about a month, they’ve already started to rip in the buttock seam. I would not recommend this brand."
2.0,missing nose piece
2.0,"It's very thin, wispy, which some may like. The fit was snug in the shoulders and the bodice -the buttons wouldn't button. Length was perfect, but I need to send it back."
2.0,"To be fair, I did look at the measurements before I bought this and thought it seemed fine. But be aware that this toiletry bag is very bulky. I'm the type of traveler who fills my suitcase with clothes, then throws my toiletry bag on top and smushes it all down. I've used this technique for years with a great &#60;insert swedish store here&#62; toiletry bag that my daughter pilfered from me, so I had to find a new one. This one is just... dense. My smushing technique didn't work, even though it wasn't even that full. I had to rearrange and create a hole in my suitcase to make room for this extra piece of luggage. I guess it's nice that the fabric is thick/sturdy, but the con is that it doesn't collapse very easily. If you like your toiletries to be contained in a box-like structure and you're a great, light packer with a lot of extra room in your suitcase, this may work well for you. If you pack like I do, I suggest looking elsewhere. Unfortunately by the time I got back from my trip my return window was gone, so I'm going to have to trade this one with my daughter and get my old, compressible toiletry bag back.<br /><br />Three more notes (I bought the blue & orange bag):<br />1) Luckily, I didn't have any issues with the zippers. I've only used it once though.<br />2) The plastic hook is a little useless. It's small so it won't hang/fit on towel rods. Unless there's a robe or towel hook around, you likely won't be able to hang this bag. Plus it feels like it may break off soon anyway with the weight of the bag alone. I'll have to hack a hook for it somehow for my daughter but I wish I didn't even have to.<br />3) I'm not positive, but I believe the solid black / solid blue bag options are wider than the blue & orange bag that I bought. The dimensions for mine are: H: 8.25 x W: 4.25&#34; x L: 9.25&#34; (see pics)."
2.0,Really pretty but broker the first time I wore it
2.0,Product is flimsy and uncomfortable
2.0,"I normally wear a medium shirt, size 6 in pants.  I ordered a medium here and it could easily fit as an EXTRA LARGE.  I know it's supposed to be loose, but it is too large to even stay on my shoulders.  There's a very thin ribbon in the back to help tie the shoulders together so it doesn't fall down. I'll make it work for my beach vacation this weekend, but I would not order this again"
2.0,Pretty small for a large. Stubby finger lengths on it so doesn't fit.
2.0,"Very cheap thin material, however still cute. You can't expect much though when the price is so cheap."
2.0,"While the style was as expected, we were unable to get the buttons on the left side of the watch to work. We got a refund."
2.0,Ordered a dark teal. It arrived as a medium-blue. The material was a crafty felt/cheap car carpet look. There was no way I would wear that and feel like I looked put-together and well dressed. Sorely disappointed!
2.0,Absolutely beautiful but I sent it back. It was so light weight it twisted on my wrist.
2.0,Took over a month to arrive... way too short to be a full length dress.
2.0,I gave it 2 stars because they're cute case/frames & quick arrival other than that totally waste of money  unless you buying for fashion & I still say don't waste you money.
2.0,"I didn't like how the straps of the dress were not sewn to the dress. Instead, they were connected with the lace up back side. Straps can look lopsided when wearing the dress."
2.0,"This is why I hate buying clothes online. I'm usually in between a L or XL depending on the brand. Unfortunately, this was too small for me. No big deal if you can return it easily. I paid $26ish and they charged me a $15 restocking fee!!! Over half of the cost of the item itself. Absolutely ridiculous!"
2.0,Hem wasn’t straight. Very cheap material. Only redeeming factor was it has pockets. Returned the very next day.
2.0,"Bought for gift, sterling silver coating was lacking in places, won't buy from this seller again."
2.0,"These are very nice and mostly as described by seller.<br />Except, they are way smaller than the 11mm x 10mm as described.<br />They are so cute and well priced. That I’m keeping them and am going to use them for a different project."
2.0,"This is not what I expected. I thought the closure looped through the buckle, but it was just a Velcro closure. The color is not a solid black and for the size I thought the straps should be wider."
2.0,It doesn't fit  right. Its like the makers have never seen an ear. Things are in the wrong places. The only reason why I give it 2 stars is cause it look cool. I suppose I could use it for... decoration... or something...?
2.0,But to me not for fat people. Seriously I wasted my money. I’m sure I can find a better shaped friend to give it to though.
2.0,Concept great<br />Broke within days
2.0,Low quality and not match with My watch Stainless steel - Nokia Smart watch
2.0,"I was so excited when I got the earrings because they were so cute. Put them in, and TWO days later the crystal fell out of one of my earrings. Now I’m not so excited anymore."
2.0,This shirt doesn’t look like it does on the model. It is large and shapeless. It hangs all wrong. I am 5’8 and 140 lbs and the large is what I normally wear. This was just awful. The material felt cheap and was not soft.
2.0,I have an average size adult head and this thing doesn’t fit me at all:( very disappointing because it’s nice material… not sure if I’ll return or what I should do with it now…
2.0,Size up if needed
2.0,"Very disappointed. The 1st pic makes it look like it’s the type of fabric that looks deliberately “worn” and slightly sheer in places, to look kind of “vintage.”<br />But it’s not that at all. It’s a tiny white design on a thick fabric. I wanted it to be thinner and have the worn look, and be more flowy and relaxed.<br />I now see that the 1st pic portrays a very different type of fabric than the 2nd and 3rd pics."
2.0,Over all its just not good quality.  I've had it less than two weeks and it's starting to stretch and fray. If you want style it's fantastic.  If you want function (I.e. work beanie) look elsewhere...
2.0,Cute popcorn sweater runs a little large
2.0,Material is see through.
2.0,"I loved these pants but they did not hold up. As someone who is 5’2, it’s exceedingly difficult to find pants that I don’t step on but these were the perfect length. After a single wash, however, these pants started pulling all over and became coarse. I washed them on delicate and air dryer but apparently that didn’t help. If the pilling didn’t make them uncomfortable and odd looking, I would have bought more pairs."
2.0,"The idea of the gloves is good, but the usefulness is lacking. The mitten flip top barely covers my grandson’s fingers. It also slips off his fingers frequently."
2.0,Doesn't fit well
2.0,You get what you pay for. Not horrible quality but from the reviews I definitely expected more.
2.0,"I purchased the white flats for my 2.5 year old daughter. The fit was great however the quality and color was not what I expected. The color white has green sparkles, the strap is very long and drags when tightened, and there is no liner in the shoe. It also looks like the strap was supposed to be attached to a different part of the shoe."
2.0,Did not know it had elastic around waist
2.0,Runs large. I couldn't keep it on my foot and it kept falling off as I tried to walk in them.
2.0,The color is nice but the backs don't stay on and they are really sharp.
2.0,"The fabric is very thin and started coming apart after a gentle cycle. Also, the fit is very small at the waste so order up a couple of sizes if you decide to purchase for a one or 2 time wear. :("
2.0,"had to wear in a wedding, all bridesmaids magically the same size-ish and we all had problems with the boob lining which is very stiff and very high"
2.0,Easy to attach but need to be pushed back into place regularly. Biggest tissue is the half inch of left over material when I’m wearing the watch.  Velcro placement is made for larger wrists.
2.0,It never glowed and doesn't look like picture
2.0,It is very pretty but it won't last very long. I had mine for less than a month before it started cracking then one day I took it out of my pocket and a big chunk of the side ripped right off. It's good for a short term case but that's about it.
2.0,Asian Sizing. XL fits like a small or medium
2.0,"When wearing these, I have to keep pulling them up all the time..."
2.0,"Pretty, but strap broke the first day I used it."
2.0,Fits tighter than expected. Had to wait extremely too long to get the product.
2.0,The dress length was fine bust area super small
2.0,Only really good for under dresses.
2.0,Too big for earrings
2.0,"cheesy material, and ran really big."
2.0,"Description says that it is “100% USA grown cotton”.<br />It maybe “100 USA grown cotton”, but 30% polyester"
2.0,"Instead of the Jaeger-LeCoultre Hybris Mechanica à Grande Sonnerie that I asked for, my mum got me this hunk of junk when I turned 16. Talk about embarrassing. I couldn't show my face at the Bellagio for a week.<br /><br />This thing is so pedestrian. I could feel it draining the equity away from my second home. I smashed it with my Tanino Crisci and tossed it over a bridge before I was spotted with it.<br /><br />I hate my parents so much."
2.0,"weird fabric, shorts run longish"
2.0,"Not a good for petite woman. I am 4'11 110ish lbs and the dress was too long, the straps were too big the chest area looked droopy. I had to tie the straps in the back to make it wearable"
2.0,"I was very excited to wear these matching sun hats with my girl.  So many issues:<br />(1) The child's hat chin strap runs front to back. So that the bow in on the hat is placed over the ear. If you're ok with that, then this may not bother you. It was a deal-breaker for me.<br />(2) There was no way to adjust the size of the child's hat. Again, if it fits perfectly might not be an issue for you.  Bothers me that the listing specifically states that the kid's hat is adjustable.<br />(3) Adult hat was missing any loops to attach a neck strap to.<br />(4) The neck strap provided was pretty short and if you see my pictures. The ends are the kind that once inserted are permanent. I wasn't going to stick this into the side of the hat and risk it poking out the side visibly.<br /><br />The good, the hats themselves without the issues above were fine and from farther away looked cute. The adult hat did have a ribbon in the brim to adjust the size.  If you don't care about chin straps or adjustability of the child hat then this might work for you.  I did make sure to purchase sold by JudyLee shipped from Amazon, so this isn't a case of another seller trying to hijack the product listing. Sadly, I'm returning."
2.0,loved the color and style. will wear through the summer but was on the small side.
2.0,Has flecks of “bleach stains” and it’s very cheap quality.
2.0,Comfy but doesn’t fit like the pictures.
2.0,"The bra is not comfortable especially if worn with the straps. And my boobs fall out the bottom of the bra.. it's bizarre.. No matter what hook it is on, I tried adjusting the straps every which way and it doesn't help. I wore the bra all day the one day with straps and by the end of the day I couldn't wait to get it off. I spent more time than I wanted trying to pull my boobs back up into the cups. I will say my boobs are 38 years old and have fed 2 kids so they are pretty deflated so maybe that is the issue here. I wore the bra over the weekend with a strapless dress and it did well (boobs stayed in place and the bra did its job) . I def will not be wearing the bra with straps only the strapless option. For the price I may buy it again for the strapless option but like I said before, I will not be using the straps."
2.0,Fabric cheap...fell apart at first washing. Wrinkled easily. Short and not very pretty.
2.0,Kind of looked like a bag...
2.0,"I bought a large because they said it was not true to size. However it was too large. I didn't like the neck line, it was too small"
2.0,"I ordered a size up and it was just barely the large comfy fit I was looking for. I washed it once, didn't dry it and now it's tight on the arms and not at all a large comfy fit. It also doesn't really fit &#34;long&#34; at all."
2.0,Not too fond of these. They don’t stay at the size you adjust them too. Nothing like the one I had before.’
2.0,"Color was too bright. Fit was not good, returned it"
2.0,Fit too small at the hips and the knee pads were sitting low on my knees.
2.0,"Super cute and sturdy, but the charm broke off easily. :("
2.0,I like the dress but it came stained. I washed it sprayed some Shout on it and luckily it came out.
2.0,Cute but my kid broke it in two days.
2.0,These rings are so cute and fit very nice but I got then yesterday night and they tarnished so badly!! I wouldn't recommend buying these rings if you don't like rings that tarnish. I didn't wear them for over an hour and this is what happened.
2.0,I love the suit! It’s perfect fit for me in size Medium but unfortunately the strap is broken. I pulled it out of the packaging like this. Other than that i love it!
2.0,I bought 2 which gave me four units. One was useless because a ball bearing came out of the unit snd made it useless. At least the other three are great. I am just short one please send me another one.<br />Daniel Neal
2.0,Crappy. Looks like a Halloween costume. Chest and arm pits too small
2.0,Not for me. Poorly made.
2.0,"I love smart wool socks, however, these compression socks are too small. The say that they fit a 23"" calf, but they didn't fit my 22.5"" calf. They were very painful and not at all what I have come to expect from Smart Wool."
2.0,"The toggle that holds the elastic cording in place does not work. Also, I have a very small head, and the gaiter is almost too small to fit, and is very tight around the neck."
2.0,"The image is very blurry, looks nothing like it does in the picture. I will be sending it back!"
2.0,"So cute but fits so so so small. I am usually a medium, large if I want a loose fit. I ordered a 12 and I would say it fits like a xs. Not good."
2.0,"The hats wouldn't stay on our heads. It shows a little ribbon, but it wasn't enough to keep the hat securely on your head."
2.0,"I got these for my active kids. The idea is great, but the little rubberized loops don't stay in place. For my daughter, who does gymnastics, they just kept sliding down the arms. Eventually, the rubber loops break."
2.0,"I was so happy to receive these until I put the first one on, man I was so disappointed. They were way to small when I gave a size larger than I usually use to wear them lose. Since My wife always washed them before I wear them she discarded all the wrappings. Now I am stuck with them and unable to use. Sorry .<br />Edison"
2.0,"I run 8 miles 3 times a week, and after a few miles, the bumps on the front of the foot start getting aggravating."
2.0,Came on time<br />Packaging was fine<br />Too bad their sizing way off chart<br />My daughter isn’t big but tall so that’s why I picked this size<br />It was too tight I should’ve returned it but we had no time since it was pretty close to Halloween. Unfortunately.
2.0,It is a waste of money. It doesn’t fit well and it is very difficult to pull the laptop from the leather sleeve.
2.0,"They look nice but they are mismatched, one like the picture and the other clear."
2.0,"Nice bandanas except for being too stiff. Almost like trying to fold up a piece of cardboard to tie around your head. I don't know if they are too thick or what, but they almost feel like they've been starched. I'm going to run them through the washer & dryer fifteen or twenty times and see if that helps."
2.0,Got the wrong product which is pretty annoying I've ordered these multiple times and never had a problem guess I won't be ordering again
2.0,Its a beautiful bracelet to look at but the chain/clasp break
2.0,Fogs like crazy
2.0,The material is not as good as expected.
2.0,"Just like noracora,  the item is taken on a model made of different material. It is not as pictured.  actual item is more like a mans tshirt, square with smaller neck. Flat lighter gray color, heavier (though lighter than a sweatshirt). It doesn't flow nicely as pictured.  This is the third time (to include noracora) these sellers inundate the internet with ads, but it appears they take one shirt, one model and rewrite color and design so the item you see is not the actual shirt or top.  I 100% guarantee you the shirt you get will not be the shirt in the photo.  Dont get your expectations up too high; hopefully they wont get away with this forever.  Also, you will wait forever to get your top. It's too difficult to return so you'll be stuck with it.  Consider yourself pre-warned.  I'm done being had with this misleading advertising of what appears to be very cool clothes."
2.0,"This is a cute bracelet but I didn't like the clasp, it isn't strong enough. I glued the links on the clasp so it stopped coming apart."
2.0,"They don’t fit right, headache to wear them and headache to take them off<br />Something is wrong with their template"
2.0,Dress is made for short females. I’m 5’6 and it’s way too short for me. Ordered a large and it still was not long enough
2.0,"This product was great at first but after I replaced my old band with this one, I have recently noticed that the pin fell out.. now, I have no idea how I'm going to get the band off to switch it without breaking my entire watch!"
2.0,This shirt comes from China. It's way to small. It fits about 3 sizes to small. And you can't dry it or it will shrink even more. The fabric is very cheap and to think almost see through.
2.0,design was not the greatest in person
2.0,"Strings hanging in a few different areas, does not fit to size. Larger than expected"
2.0,"I thought I would really like this belt, and the clasp is fun and unique, but the elastic material is so cheap that it folds over itself when stretched and makes permanent wrinkles and folds, so the belt isn't any good beyond one single use. Really disappointed - I wish I didn't buy it."
2.0,Hard fabric
2.0,Broke after two wears.
2.0,A little small around the waist
2.0,Loved the fabric but leg opening bind
2.0,It's pretty but one of the jewels fell off after wearing it a second time and by the 3rd time I lost it since it's so poorly made.
2.0,Too big for my liking gave them to my daughter!
2.0,Loved that it is lightweight and great for summer rainy days for my average sized 11 year old. I ordered an 11/12 which is her normal clothing size but the sleeves were way too short. I want to reorder for the size 13 but scared it will fit too perfect and she will only get to use it for 1 summer. Bummer
2.0,The picture is highly appealing. But the material was shiny....i have ordered for larger size but got medium.it dint fit at all. I removed the lace in hands so that I can use it like a cardigan ...
2.0,"Size chart is totally wrong. Got the L for 6-7 year old and it could fit me, an adult. Otherwise cute."
2.0,Not as effective as I had hoped. The center section would swell when wet making it awkward to keep in place
2.0,"I thought I was getting 2 galaxy decorating kits, but when they arrived they were just neon decorating kits.  I didn't reach out because I'll just keep the neon kits, even though I was hoping to have something different this year.  Thank you!"
2.0,"I bought this dress for a retro event. I felt the fabric was stiff, and I would have preferred a softer fabric that laid a little smoother. But while the dress itself was cute, the sizing was so off that I had to return it. I normally wear an 8-10 in dresses, so I ordered the 10-12. While I admit I am large busted, I could not even get the buttons within 2 inches of each other to close. Also, I am 5'7&#34; and the waist was about 2&#34; above my waistline. So I returned the dress, hoping to order a size up, but the next size did not come in the color I wanted."
2.0,Looks better in the picture than in person.  It isn't as 3D as it appears in the picture and it is very tiny.  I would not recommend for purchase.
2.0,good looking but HORRIBLE design to remove links..next to impossible! ! This watch is being returned
2.0,These bands are too big for Apple Watch 6
2.0,"If you’re looking for a red skirt, this isn’t it. It’s definitely burgundy. And there are two large slits up the front, which I couldn’t tell from the pictures or description. The fit and quality are fine, they just need an accurate description of the product."
2.0,"Bought this dress based on reviews, but it did not work for me! It was not flattering at all & the material made it look cheap! I’m sending it back!"
2.0,"I have to agree with another person that left a negative review. I used to work in a ski shop years ago and we sold Turtle Fur items. The quality has gone downhill. I purchased a neck warmer recently and the first time I wore it, it was shredding and pulling apart like felt. Not the old Turtle Fur, that’s for sure. I will be looking somewhere else and compare to see if these ones on Amazon are indeed knock offs “."
2.0,"Very, very short.  I am 5'6&#34; and it was way too short for me.  I felt like the sizing overall ran fairly small.  Material was ok quality."
2.0,THis band is super cutem but a little to wide for metal frame. I tried for 45 Min to get the band to fit into frame because I liked it so much but there was no hope of getting it to fit.
2.0,"It's one season bag, the quality is that I couldn't use it more"
2.0,Not was I was thinking hey they'd be.
2.0,"Runs extremely small, returned"
2.0,"Its so cute but so awful. It made my fingers turn green, much to my dismay. I was starting to love it so much too."
2.0,Like the material and color but they don’t fit
2.0,"I love the idea of this dress and was so excited to get it. Amazon suggested a XXL, the size chart had me at a XL, when I got it and tried it on it was way too big. I would have loved to exchange it for a smaller size because it is so soft and comfy, but that option wasn't offered."
2.0,"It just not a cute product once you wear it, extra long, not flattering"
2.0,The bag is very beautiful but I had to use super glue on the short handles that came apart the first day I used it.  This was a second bite as the same thing happened to a similar design hand bag I had bought earlier.
2.0,Product was tight and cheap. About 30 min after getting it one strand broke and I had beads everywhere. Bummer
2.0,The one color I was most excited for was a screw not a L shape.
2.0,See comments above.
2.0,Beyond fitted! Plus when I received the package it came without tags and appeared to already been worn as it had deodorant stains on it
2.0,These are HUGE and look pretty cheap.
2.0,"cheap quality, did not fit. Returned"
2.0,"They are super strong magnets. If left on ear or nose too long, they tend to make you sore. They are bigger than I expected too. But, they are bright and shiny!"
2.0,"It was larger then the others I have received and it may be just me but I feel like the pattern is more of a moo moo like when I have it on.  I am a slender individual so its not that I look big, just feel like its more for an older individual and it funs very big.  Also its shorter in the back then I thought.  This is just my opinion and has nothing to do with the seller shipper or anything, just not my style"
2.0,The clip seems to come loose a lot.
2.0,The mask so small and hurt in the earlobe
2.0,"This &#34;sweatshirt&#34; is not a sweatshirt, it's just a long sleeve shirt. I ordered a large as I usually wear a small or medium in sweatshirts and wanted it to be oversized enough that I could wear it over leggings and have it cover my rear so I could wear it to work. The fit is horrible; the sleeves are too right where the white appliques are and the chest is cut extremely flat, the shoulders are cut too wide and it barely hits the widest part of my hip. I could have made the best of this cut of the fabric had any stretch whatsoever but it is not stretchy and not breathable at all. Over all I am very disappointed with this purchase and am only giving two starts as it is able to fit my husband who usually wears a men's small."
2.0,Broke on the first day. I purchased these for my wife and the first time I put them in her ear they broke. They look great but broke on the first use.
2.0,Low rise waist feels terrible
2.0,Wrong size and  Wrong color was sent 2 stars because the material was quality and the return/refund process was easy
2.0,"I am giving it a 2 star due to the material, although it was disappointingly loooooose (didnt fit snug to keep my legs warm) the knitting was good (no snags). Pattern was cute."
2.0,"Not great quality, they look cheap....however, they were inexpensive, so it depends on what you're looking for. If you're going for the leather look, these aren't what you want. They just look like a very shiny legging. They fit great though, pretty flattering."
2.0,I  like it but I Ordered 2 and only received 1
2.0,I did like the fact that it was not flannel like material.  Flat design with a slight sheen to it.
2.0,The color I received was navy blue.
2.0,I like the look but there's very little elasticity making them useless for me since I need a tight fit.
2.0,"I got the Higher Standards Cloth Face Masks to add to my mask collection.  I am not impressed with these at all.  They run very large and do not fit my face properly.  The masks lack some of the things I look for when purchasing masks.  For example, there is no adjustable nose piece.  The ear straps are not adjustable.  There is no filter pocket.  Plus, they are rather expensive for what you get."
2.0,Wanted to love them for my baby girl. Unfortunately after two pair I was not optimistic about the 3rd time being the charm. They run large. For example we wear a size 11.5 in Pediped shoes. But we needed to size down to a 10.5. Which was not available
2.0,Not worth the money but it's cute. It did end up strangling me a little bit but I think that's the ways its suppose to be. It did break but it was an easy fix. I wouldn't buy this necklace again.
2.0,Definitely not worth the price. The material is thin and cheap. You will need to layer a tank underneath. The fit is cute and flattering though.
2.0,"Great material, runs small.  Came damaged or with a dirt smudge on back."
2.0,"This isn’t really a blazer.  For $40, I was expecting something I could wear to work.  This comes down over my butt, is flimsy and definitey more of a soft cardigan than a blazer.  On me, it looks like a freaking doctor jacket."
2.0,SUPER CUTE! However they feel very cheap and the bottoms are very thin and you can feel the cardboard :/
2.0,"When i received these earrings, one of the shafts was bent. And the &#34;coral&#34; was so skinny...in the silver you could not tell what it was. I believe they sent me seconds. I should of sent them back. But a month goes quickly.  And I was having trouble getting a return label. ( MY fault)  So I will be thrift shopping them."
2.0,"Material is thin as a T-Shirt and I can see through it. I wear a small/medium petite and I swim in the dress. I intend to take it apart, add a lining and take it in 2&#34; on each side."
2.0,I didn't expect these to be mesh. I wasn't thrilled.
2.0,Not good quality the small piece broke off almost instantly. script could not be read whatsoever. Too small and the laser imprint without colour was not able to be seen.
2.0,"The shiny wears off sooner than expected, and it turns my skin green. I am not typically allergic to metals."
2.0,"This item was not centered in the middle of the sash therefore one side was extremely longer than the other and even after it was tied it hung longer on one side. Also, the backing material of the rhinestones was not completely trimmed and lots of excess was around the outside stones. Globs of glue along with strings of glue were also on each end where the hot glue had been dragged across. I was very disappointed overall and had to take rhinestones off and place on another sash."
2.0,I’ve worked in health care many years now and these are the stiffest gloves I’ve ever tried. Also now green as shown in the picture here
2.0,small fit nice color
2.0,"floppy, no structure, Dearfoam is not going to last if it keeps putting out stuff like this"
2.0,"I absolutely loved these sunglasses as soon as I opened the box. They're so cute and fit really well. However, I put them on to run errands the first time and within one hour the arm just fell off. It separated from the frame in a way that can't be fixed. But I really liked them, so I ordered a second pair in a different color and so far they're fine. I'm not sure if the first pair are defective or it was just a fluke. They're cheap enough that taking the gamble was okay."
2.0,Had to return. Too big. I sent for extra small and recvd small..
2.0,"Ordered my usual size, small and the top was much larger. I would say closer to a size Large. Would have been a cute top, though it looked “boxy” regardless, had it been true to size. Unfortunately had to return."
2.0,It's super short. You definitely need leggings under it. It's spandex
2.0,Just like plastic but u get what u pay for 🤷🏽‍♀️ For for an upcoming event
2.0,"I am very pleased overall with jackets size, color and warmth. Not too hot, not too thin. However I am fairly upset that a button on the cuff is entirely missing leaving a hole through the jacket. If I pay top dollar for equipment I expect it to come complete.<br />I tried to make a return and get a new one, but the color is unavailable and is no longer sold on the either this website or Northface themselves. I am stuck with a defective product that would have been my new favorite piece of clothing."
2.0,Three out of four masks were on point. The fourth was yellow instead of neon green as shown in the picture...
2.0,Waste of money !! Dont buy it
2.0,"The color is white, not pink.  Not as pictured."
2.0,"Made only slight improvement to my night driving.  They are nice and very light, but did not reduce glare."
2.0,Ultra small for size.  Should have returned it before 30 days was up.  Would not buy again.
2.0,"Fit my skinny 3 year old fine, but wow this is not made well at all. It came sewn poorly. There are already two holes just unpackaging it, and the stars melted into the skirt making the first layer of the tutu matted. I was able to get most of it unmatted with a little work, but one spot was completely ruined. It's fall, so I don't think this happened in delivery. They are sending poorly and carelessly made products. I am not about to send it back after my toddler put it on, but I would recommend buying with low expectations. It will be fluffy and soft, but it smells like plastic and is not going to hold up."
2.0,"I was so excited to receive this mask, but alas, it's much too large for my face."
2.0,Bulky on a small hand<br />If you have a larger hand or fingers it will look nice.
2.0,"4 out of 5 of these were fine.  The heart eyed one that we hot, was a dud.  The band that kept it on your head kept popping loose, and worse than that, the mask would not light up.  $50 down the drain, and we didn't even get one use out of it in Halloween night.  One of my kids didn't have a costume for trick or treating.  That's really tough, when they're little."
2.0,The legs are very slim.
2.0,"The quality was less than expected, even for a cheaper shirt.  I usually wear a large but like room so to be safe went with XL. I could barely button the buttons.  I worry that if I would have flexed the shirt would tear."
2.0,fit was too small and the style wasn't as flattering as I'd hoped
2.0,This shoe looks good but it runs a bit tight and doesnt look good
2.0,"Fine fabric, but weird fit. Sleeves very small. I had to send it back."
2.0,I gave this top to my extra small niece.
2.0,So different than the picture. Unhappy purchase.
2.0,Fit was too small not as expected or stated
2.0,Pretty disappointed in the top. Not even proportional- very short and larger at bottom of the top.<br />Bottoms are good.<br />Birthday gift for my daughter.
2.0,Aprietan las piernas
2.0,...but for what I paid it does the job.
2.0,Very small and no stretch at all.  It definitely needs larger sizes.  Appears to be very high quality though.
2.0,This item is sized as a &#34;one size&#34; item generally meaning that it is oversized.  It is not.  I would consider it a size women's medium at best.  The fabric is very thin.  I returned it.
2.0,"I should have read the top review carefully - they are 5’1”. I am 5’8”, so not exactly big or tall. It barely covers my mouth and my breath would be expelled outside the mask if I tried talking. My nose hits the inside of the mask where the fan housing is.  This might be very good for a teen or just smaller people. I can see myself using this in a gym when they open or while running since it’s just working out, but not for stores or out doors where you may need to speak.<br /><br />That said, yes you can breath! Fan works well but have not tested how long it lasts on a charge. The cover over rhe filter is held my magnets and can easily pop off. Straps is actually nice but suffers from similar design issue, it snaps on but size and hold of snap i sufficient to hold securely and seems to me can easily pop off as well.<br /><br />Really want to like it, conceptually great may work in limited scenarios, suffers from design weaknesses."
2.0,Very pretty and easy to adjust but turned my toe green after only 2 weeks of wear.
2.0,Nice style but thin material
2.0,"This is useless for the purpose I wanted. I bought the purple/blue space/stars pattern if that matters. I just wanted to wear it around my neck and pull it up over my mouth and nose when I went into a store, which it is shown as being one of its uses. It's way too big around for that. Unless you have a giant head, you can't use it for that. I safety pinned it to make it two inches less in circumference, which made it harder to get on, but it still wouldn't stay up over my nose. The area I am trying to get it to stay up on is 18.25"" in circumference, in case you want to know. Two stars because it can be used as a weird head band or neck warmer (like turtle fur) and the pattern is pretty. I will never use it though. It just isn't small enough or elastic enough."
2.0,"It is pretty, but came too big.  The little one needed a dress asap, so we just tailored it ourselves to fit her.  Pretty easy to do on the waist part if you know what you're doing.  But the sleeves are near impossible to tailor, best just to rip it out.  These are made for short fat kids with Popeye arms."
2.0,"I loved the color (red), the design of the bag, and all the compartments.  But my wallet is 7&#34; wide and this purse is less than 7&#34; wide.  What a bummer.  I had to return it."
2.0,"So, I loved the fit- it was much cuter than I expected. But. Despite the description and tag claiming that it’s cotton/spandex, this feels EXACTLY  like polyester knit. Not what I’m looking for in a summer dress."
2.0,I wore these glasses 2 x and they fell apart at the nose plate. They were no good to me. 😖
2.0,"Horrible material, no stretch at all.. I bought size XL, but fit a size small."
2.0,Horrible. Torn on side. Thin material way too small even after ordering up.
2.0,Just an overall weird fit. Plus the diagonal stitching didn’t look right.
2.0,"This dress is so pretty in design but deceptive and very overpriced; it is cheap looking, and it is not made from cotton/linen but some kind of artificial fiber."
2.0,"Did live price, did love look, didn't like that chain linked first time I wore it."
2.0,i felt like i was in a garbage bag way to big buy a size down or two
2.0,"I really like how this fit. It did run small. I ordered a medium and I normally wear a small (5'5&#34; 110). The medium fit well, but the pattern is so blaringly mismatched that I have to return it. If it weren't so obviously wrong, id have kept it. See photo."
2.0,Quite heavy and not really practical to actually wear on your head.  Lovely to look at.
2.0,"I’m a 38DD and this was an awkward fit. I am an Olympic weightlifter and starting to think the only way to get a bra that fits is wearing two or three sports bras on top. And still, somehow, that option seemed a better fit than this bra. The seams across the top felt like they were going to pop and although I really loved the back of this bra, I felt like I had uninhibited hard.<br /><br />I guess if you’ve got fake tits, this will be fine but for all you naturals out there, this ain’t it."
2.0,This dress was meant to be my disabled daughter's prom dress. She was so excited to receive it. Unfortunately it didn't fit at all. It's WAY smaller than I expected. The zipper is impossible!! I broke two nails just trying to unzip it. The stitching was sloppy. The flower strap was cute but the flowers were attached loosely and just kind of hung there.<br /><br />I'm returning this dress and have already purchased a different one. Thank goodness for prime and two day shipping!! I have 2 stars rather than 1 because the dress is cute just not made well. Plus I knew for the price what to expect. I just wish it wouldn't fit her. I mean they're was no way to even do alterations to make it fit. It's a pretty dress but really needs some improvements in construction.
2.0,The earrings are adorable... But the first day I wore them the campfire piece came off both sides of one earring and one side of the other. I managed to completely lose one of the pieces and had to hot glue them on to get them to stay put
2.0,Not flattering but comfortable
2.0,"I would like to have given this 4 or even 5 stars for price and cuteness, but unfortunately the quality didn't cut it. Ours arrived with a hole directly in the crotch of the pants. This outfit was so cute on and she loved it, so or sucks here was a hole!"
2.0,I cannot accurately review this product because the one I received had a broken clasp. But the design was very sturdy and had clean lines. The company was also very good about the return process.
2.0,"A previous poster made a note that the dress is not white, but actually has a yellow tint. They are correct, the top looks like someone peed on it; the color is not attractive."
2.0,Did not like the material and it looks very small
2.0,"It fit as expected but it looks nothing like the picture, I'm disappointed in the way it looked"
2.0,"Quality and fabric seemed fine but it was way too big. I always order a size large (5’11”, 200 lbs) and this fits as like an XL or even XXL. Will be returning."
2.0,"This top is not cropped at all. It is cute but longer than I expected. Casual look with jeans, yoga pants. But wish it was cropped."
2.0,"I ordered a pink short sleeve leotard and got a purple spaghetti strap one.  Its cute and will work, just not at all what I ordered."
2.0,"Although the earring is cute, the stem is TOO small for tragus piercing. I wish that I could return it."
2.0,Fit like shirt and I’m tall will keep because I like it
2.0,NICE BUT VERY SMALL
2.0,"Fabric ok. Fairly thick. Is not sized US sizing, so order up. Strange exposed Velcro patches near elbows? Just looks cheap overall. Went and bought a Carhartt coat, as I should have originally."
2.0,I do not recommend it. The three pins removers are of poor quality; they bend and break off. This item is a waste of money.
2.0,They cute the clasp are like on the very edge so you have to be very careful when fastening them. *EDITED* Didnt last long clasp fell off during wearing.
2.0,Cheaply made. Stopped working within a month. My mother-in-law wears it still because she likes the color and sparkles. But you can tell it's cheap just looking at it. 2 stars only because she thinks it's pretty.
2.0,They were ALOT smaller that the picture great for second holes.  Beautiful for sure.
2.0,its all in the headline
2.0,"I was very excited for these when I first bought them. I have multiple ear piercings so a pack this large was great! Unfortunately, I've broken 3 of these not even a week into wearing them. I'm not sure how that's even happening. I ended up just throwing them out and going back to metal earring and keeping the nylon earring backs that came with these ones to use instead. Maybe these are meant for people that don't have so many piercings on their ears (I wear 6 pairs of earrings at a time)."
2.0,"Difficult to set , my grand daughter desperately wanted it.  I would have returned it, because I feel it was very cheaply made and certainly priced too high for such a poor quality item.  Pass on purchasing this."
2.0,"Arrived scuffed up, with paint/color transfer from something else. Very disappointed! But the bell has a nice sound to it and it’s cute so it gets a little above 1 star."
2.0,"I got these pants to wear as a casual weekend lounge pant. When I first received them, they were comfortable, breathable, and fit perfectly. I thought I had finally found some nice Sunday pants that would last me a while. That is until I washed them.<br /><br />Side note- there are no washing care instructions anywhere on these pants, so we washed and dried them on delicate.<br /><br />When I took them out of the dryer, they looked like capris. (see picture) I'll never wear these pants again and have given them to my wife. They MIGHT fit her. I'm very disappointed in this product and can not recommend them unless you plan on hand washing them in cold water and air dry every time."
2.0,How the arms connect
2.0,"The top is one size and the bottom is three sizes smaller. I ordered 12 years size and the top says 160 and the bottoms say 130. The bottoms are too small for my daughter. It is a cute suit, but I will have to return it."
2.0,"Unfortunately, I was not aware that the patches were plastic. I did not like this."
2.0,"It looked nice on, but when I got it it had a hole in the seam so I had to return it. I didn’t love the fabric but it wasn’t terrible. Overall it’s flattering but had to return."
2.0,"Was disappointed with this leotard.  Opened the package and my daughter put on and there was a blatant rip on the seam.  Also the stiching was all coming apart.  I ordered a replacement that will be coming in two days.  Do like the feel of the material and was just disappointed that this was defective.  Hoping that the new one is better and if not, both will go back and will get a refund.  The defective one will be returned."
2.0,"I ordered the 3-pack white/gray/black in my size based on the sizing chart. They clung to my body but did not provide any compression. When the shirts arrived, the white shirt had odd dark stains across the front and one sleeve. I wore the black shirt for a day and the dye bled all over my skin and all of the other clothes I was wearing. I was able to figure out from this that the dark stains on the white shirt were the result of the black shirt bleeding on it in the package. The dye did not wash out of the white shirt, nor did it wash out of the other clothes that I had worn with the black shirt. It also stained my skin for a few days. I returned the shirts for a refund, but it seems like nothing can get the dye out of my other clothes."
2.0,"Very cute and a eye catcher but turned my wrist colors, major turn off"
2.0,"These were going to be for a medusa costume (hence the snake print)  but unfortunately I'll have to keep looking.  The material is thin and doesn't give much support. They fit but there didn't seem to be quite enough material for these to be considered high-waisted through the back.  Also the print wasn't straight up my leg, it curved at a weird angle.  Overall just disappointed."
2.0,"The dress is pretty, but the bust area is way too small. I am a size 12 and ordered the Large."
2.0,"The fabric is not see through like on the model. It feels like I'm wearing a way too big surgical gown and looks like I'm wearing a sack. I swim in this and it is not flattering. I am 5'4&#34; 155 lb with an athletic, curvy body type."
2.0,Looked like I was wearing a sack.
2.0,Didn’t really think it looks like the picture and when I received it I couldn’t figure out how to get it to work. As there was no supports I ended up returning it.
2.0,Fabric is too thin for even a night gown
2.0,"Bought these for my grand daughter and her 2 little friends , the cat his HUGE and the chain, when it says LONG it means VERY Long .. Very Disappointed Grand Daughter ..."
2.0,For big arms they don't stay up at all.
2.0,"im giving this bikini 2 stars. its cute, looks exactly like the picture and was well made and probably would have looked great if it was the correct size and the straps had the correct hooks. the bikini i received had rings on the straps instead of hooks so there was no way for me to connect the blue shoulder straps to the back straps like it was designed. I ended up returning it because there was no way to actually connect the rings to the back of the bikini and the bottoms were too small."
2.0,It’s okaaaaay… I wasn’t happy to see it was like spandex material. It looked like it was cotton in the pic but it’s not.
2.0,Much smaller than the size chart says and it's itchy.  Is it made of asbestos or something? If you buy it then make sure to get a size larger than the size chart says.  If you plan to wash in warm water and put in a dryer then get TWO sizes larger.
2.0,Not comfortable cheap feel and look
2.0,"The bag has a great look and worked well for a while. However, after about three months the shoe compartment started tearing and now there's a gaping hole in the side of the bag. I'd suggest saving yourself the trouble and getting a sturdier bag to begin with."
2.0,Had to return twice because they either arrive with pulls or had multiple pulls after one use.  Stinks because the shirts are awesome.
2.0,"It seemed to fit and look fine, but the elastic band in the top was super thin, so after a bit it was digging into my flesh super uncomfortably. I bought this to be comfortable on a 37 hour travel day and ended up leaving it in the hotel room and wearing jeans (which were more comfortable!) for the flight back."
2.0,Doesn't work for someone with bigger assets up top. Way too tight.
2.0,"The loop to clasp at the top was SO tiny, I couldn't get the button through it. The dress also came smelling like vinegar, and felt really cheap. I have a similar dress from shein.com in white and it's so much better made than this one. I returned this :("
2.0,"Purchased as part of a Halloween costume so it did the trick for one wear, but not something that I would recommend for a special occasion or as a ""real"" outfit."
2.0,"They didn’t look as I expected them to, on top of it they didn’t look right on my face shape so I ended up returning.  I wouldn’t discourage from buying but also wouldn’t recommend"
2.0,"Looks beautiful at first, and could be worn. Problem is that before i could even wear the necklace the chain broke."
2.0,The shoes are cute and my little one likes them.  The lights on the other hand only worked one day. This shoes are not rechargeable like other light up shoes. My daughter likes wearing them anyway.
2.0,"Please click through the pictures. The first couple ard from the original manufacturer,  when you get to the end of the picture, the shirt that looks like a printed nylon shirt. Thai is what you are getting. I have the blue one in a medium, the pink one is a large. Please note the difference  in the material quality and texture  and also the difference in size. Save your money. On a positive note it shipped  quickly"
2.0,Dosent look the same at all
2.0,The straps are not long enough.
2.0,"This BEANIE is super small, does not have the extra material (like shown in picture) and only holds a charge for about an hour maybe hour ten if your lucky. Very disappointed."
2.0,"This started out as a great product, keeping my shirt looking crisp and tucked in. However, after a month, one of the clips stopped working. It would no longer close and grip my shirt properly enabling this product useless. I guess you get what you pay for. I would suggest shelling out a couple more bucks for better quality straps."
2.0,"I really like the bracelet, but the stupid clasp keeps coming aloose. and the bracelet comes off"
2.0,the collar is very very very big !!
2.0,Runs small no support
2.0,"I ordered this this thinking it might look cool but it does not. It looks good in the picture but in real it looks like a cheap swimming costume. And the quality of the cloth is not that good. However, what can you expect in five dollars right."
2.0,"cheap fabric, wont stay up gets saggy"
2.0,"The swimsuit itself is cute. But it is cheaply made! The fringe does not look pretty like it does in the pictures. Also the fringe is not all cut, some parts are still together. I am going to have to sit down and cut them all apart. Plus part of the stitching was wrapped in the fringe. I’m hoping the whole thing doesn’t unravel and fall apart. 😔"
2.0,I followed the sizing chart and it was way too big! I measured myself with a tape and everything. Highly upset.
2.0,That are not very warm and comfortable
2.0,"Got this as a potential bridesmaid dress in pale pink, because finding a bridesmaid dress with upper arm coverage is nearly impossible. I loved that you can open the pieces of fabric, cross them in the back, cross them in the front, and tie to get that bit of sleeve. Loved the finished look (although it was a bit tighter than I thought it would be for one size fits all... I'm certainly not obese by any means--I'm on the curvier side, but I do usually fit into one-size things, but this was definitely not flow-y around my hips and booty), but the light pink color was SO light and the fabric was so light (which would have been a plus.. this is a beach wedding) it basically became see-through. Undergarments were on FULL display under normal lighting.. I shudder to think what a flash would have done! So disappointing! Back it goes :("
2.0,Does not serve as slimwear. It doesn't have enough hold.
2.0,Would not fit
2.0,"Sleeves are way too tight!!!  I wanted to love this shirt in the worst way.  After reading reviews on sizing, I ordered the largest size (the Chinese equivalent of 8x!).  I am currently running L or XL for most women's tops. I'm 5'10, running on the heavier side of ideal weight, 38DD.  I could get it buttoned all the way up, it was snug and more than likely I'd leave top buttons undone with a T or tank underneath. Every aspect of this shirt was good-- the length, the curvy feminine fit that gave it a waist and shape, sleeve length, BUT the sleeves were way too tight and restricting on the upper arms (I measured-- mine are 15&#34; diameter-- not skinny arms but no bat wings either).  There would definitely have been shrinkage, so I knew I couldn't keep it.  A shame, because otherwise the workmanship seemed pretty decent-- plaids matched well in front, pockets were cut on bias to match each other, the fabric is a substantial flannel but not too heavy (there is no stretch in it though).  Colors were great and unique.  It makes me very sad to have to return these two shirts because for the price I loved everything else about them.  All I can say is measure your upper arm girth, and if you come in 13&#34; or below you're good.  I don't think Chinese manufacturers truly get the American body-- if a woman is ordering this large, chances are she's ample in the chest and the arms (and seriously, sew a label 8x inside?  How about putting the true size for your market?).  Loose sleeves in this shirt style are appreciated."
2.0,Too cheap looking to keep. Pass on this one!
2.0,The outfit was cute but I wish I ordered a bigger size and it looks cheap so I won’t be ordering anyone
2.0,Bracelet broke after having for 2 months.
2.0,The bathing suit is lovely but I would highly recommend sizing up. I bought the size 2 for my slim 2 year old who still fits into 12-18 months clothes and it fit her small. When I tried it on her it dug into her shoulders leaving red dents when we took it off. Unfortunately I had to send it back.
2.0,It should be as long or longer than the riding shorts. It is about an inch and a half shorter.
2.0,The wife just couldn't figure out how this thing works or how it's supposed to fit.  So pretty disappointing.  Plus; hard to figure out how this little POS cost this much!
2.0,Much smaller than depicted. Looks &#34;cheap.&#34;
2.0,"Ok, I bought this months ago for hiking and walking my dog in wet weather.  For the most part this suit has kept me somewhat dry. That said it does begin to absorb the water in short fashion rather than shed it.  My biggest gripe about this is the super cheap zipper that catches on the material constantly whether going up or down.  SERIOUSLY DON'T CUT CORNERS ON THE ZIPPER and still charge your prices."
2.0,"The actual product is a poor imitation of the Charm pictured.  The team emblem is unrecognizable.  It was bought as a Christmas gift and I left myself too little time to exchange it.  For others reading this, I would not purchase this item again, at any price.  See attached picture & you can compare product to advertised photo to decide for yourself.  This photo is with magnification."
2.0,"The item was okay. But, it doesn't stretch in the back. So, it doesn't fit me. And I wrote to them to them to pick it up. It's packed and ready. It's been more than two weeks and still not picked up."
2.0,The key is for show no instructions for the battery.
2.0,"Would of given a better review if I did not end up having to repair a nearly three inch hole in the outside seam near the calf area. It arrived on time and seemed to look as pictured. But when I opened them up to wear them, the draw string was uneven, which I could of over looked, but then discovering the second defect ( the nearly three inch hole) I was not pleased to say the least.  I won't be recommending this product to anyone else."
2.0,Great for looks but with lenses so light you squint in the sun like you have nothing on.
2.0,"Whichever way you tie the belt, it looks and feels weird. It is impossible to adjust once you tie it in and is hard to figure out without constantly looking at the Amazon directions page. There are no directions that come with the belt."
2.0,This is very very short and is more like a t-shirt. I am not a tall person at all and it is short but can be worn perhaps with some leggings.
2.0,Did not fit curves well and did not like the material
2.0,"The screw-on connector and plastic-coated metal wire are very sturdy. The problem is that the connector is attached to the wire by just a crimped metal housing. This means they're basically just pinched on, and therefore can come off easily with a little force. Its a shame, because if the connector was securely fused to the wire these could be much more sturdy."
2.0,Colors has already started to rub off and fade after wearing a week
2.0,5xl is more like a XL it was for my oldest son but the baby of the house like it and fit good. Printing Design is perfect.<br />5xl es más como un XL era para mi hijo mayor pero el bebe d la casa le gustó y le sirvió así que se quedó con el. El diseño es perfecto
2.0,"Too small, bad quality fabric, bad cut. I,m not sure which body type this coat was made for, but I can asure it is not for a normal woman's body."
2.0,Son loves it but the batteries died before he even had it one day.
2.0,"The armholes were too small to get the ruffle effect, my entire arms stretched it out :(<br />Had potential to be really cute."
2.0,"I ordered a large, put it on and it was too small on me. I love how the pits go all the way up but the dang shirt is too tight to be a large"
2.0,I like the fit but wasn't impressed with the bling gold. I didn't realize it was gonna look this gaudy
2.0,"The silver ring is actually just a gray ring painted silver. After the first couple days of wearing it, the paint all rubbed off, leaving a blotchy gray ring. Great product as long as you don't have your heart set on a metallic ring like we did."
2.0,Wow this band scratches your wrist all day. Walking and moving will Indian burn you!!
2.0,Small fit..nice material though
2.0,"These bibs do not wash well, instead of becoming softer they become rougher as far as the terry cloth.  Also stains do not wash out easily and after many washings the white terry cloth becomes rough and turns a light grey rather than remains white. The snaps on the bib are very hard to snap, especially the one that makes the neck tighter.  These bibs are more sized for a man rather than a woman.  I would not buy these again. The water repellant underside of the bib is thick and does hold up that is the only part of the bib I like.  I thought the bib coming from NorthShore would be nicer."
2.0,Super small fits more like a 10/12 not a 14/16. My daughter barely squeezes into it.
2.0,"I loved this band when I first got it it was easy to put on, very comfortable. But after 2 weeks its already  broken and I had to use a stapler to keep it in place and a bandaid to protect my wrist from the broken plastic. I will be returning this immediately"
2.0,Returned these. Very loud & gawdy looking.
2.0,"We had to cut the elastic gores to get my husband's feet in, so of course wasn't able to return them.  Looked like they would have been what we needed if they had fit."
2.0,these are not for a regular pandora braclet
2.0,"This top does not look like what is pictured. The V is much deeper on the one that arrived, and it’s very boxy. It was very loose on my shoulders. If it would have fit my shoulders, it wouldn’t have had the swing in the torso. Also, the color was printed onto the fabric and so the inside of the top is white. What the model is wearing is cute. What arrived looked and felt very cheap. Not even worth the $11 it was on lightening deal!"
2.0,"They weren't that bad looking and only time will tell if they hold up. Be aware that they are not silver and I made my cousin a teen bracelet out of them, she loves them."
2.0,Same thickness but skinnier than the last one I bought. Product image shows a wider band but that is not the case.
2.0,I'm of medium build and I wear medium sizes. But this Cardigan was very nice but meant for a small person. Thank you for your understanding.
2.0,"Although it is very pretty and the color is great, it is really, really big!!  Even for a man's wrist, it is too large.  And with it being so large in size, the band wasn't long enough to fit my wrist.  Very strange.  I wish it wasn't so big, because it is really pretty!!!"
2.0,Product was too small on top and too large at the waist. I normally wear a size 2 so I ordered a small. I am 5 7.5 and 125lbs with a 34b chest. The dress color is very beautiful and I really wish it would've fit.
2.0,The quality of this necklace is very poor. It looks and feels like plastic.The pendant is no larger than the size of a penny. Its pretty (the chain is the redeeming quality and the only part of the necklace that I believe is sterling silver) but its difficult to get past the quality of the pendant.
2.0,I thought it was beautiful but so disappointed and wouldn't advise anyone to purchase since it falls off your arm and you could lose it very easily.  For me it was just wasted money spent.  The first Ginger Snaps I have purchased that I was very disappointed in.
2.0,Kept having to pull down the shoulders to look as pictured which is annoying.
2.0,Pretty design!  I was confused by the size of the earrings.  They were so tiny you couldn't really see the pretty pattern.
2.0,It is not like what I expected.
2.0,Not a great fit.<br />Material a bit cheap
2.0,The material was clingy. Not what I expected.
2.0,"I inherited an Omega Seamaster from 1966 with a Speidel band. Very nice.<br />Bought stainless band for Apple Watch. It felt light, the pins that attach band to watch are “wire” or a thin metal. The band did not come with any extra links to add a link. Which is what I probably needed. Gave me a pinched feeling on my wrist. For $50 it should be right. Disappointed on the “whole” of things."
2.0,"I wanted to love this as a lounge-around-the-house robe. I returned XL for L and feel it is still too  big and too long.  Even though the picture shows ankle length, I had to  cut some off the bottom so that I don't trip. The other problem is that the material is too heavy for warm weather wear. And since it is sooo long and sooo bulky, this caftan is not easy to take off."
2.0,"Ordered the orange floral leggings, very disappointed in the color. The flowers are more of a gold than orange color. My daughter’s cheer team is orange and black and was hoping to wear the leggings as part of showing “team colors.” Returning these and continuing to look for the right colors."
2.0,"Very pretty, but the 3T shirt was way too big and arrived stained. Flowers fell off the headband in less than an hour."
2.0,"The material feels like a scuba suit and is a lot brighter than in the pictures. For reference, I'm 5'3&#34; an 120lbs and ordered a medium. I wish I had sized down because it's very large. Overall, disappointed."
2.0,"Chain is so thin, looks like it will break easily."
2.0,Too small and was really wrinkled like it was stuffed in the corner or the drawer.<br />Will be sending it back.<br />I was really disappointed because its comfortable  and fells nice
2.0,Material not what i expected. Material thin and cheap.
2.0,"Great watch band material. But after having it on my watch for a few weeks the top clip has started to randomly unlatch letting my watch fall off, I also notice a few of my shirts and my jacket were getting the cuffs frayed by the clasp."
2.0,"I love the feel on my wife but the seam came undone while she was wearing them, this rendering them useless."
2.0,"The cloth was really thin, and the dress was really short, do not recommend this if you want a dress"
2.0,"Didn't like it too much, not as flattering as the picture, it's quite church like more than fun"
2.0,band is uncomfortable and very stiff
2.0,Very pretty but I didn’t read the description. IT ONLY COMES WITH ONE! The side I part my hair on this earring didnt work for me.
2.0,"I gave this product a low rating ONLY because the wire would not stay closed. I did like the earrings just not the fact that the ONE hoop wire would not stay closed. The seller did accept request for complete refund. At this time I am awaiting the refund to be credited. If need be, I will change this review to a higher 'star' rating."
2.0,"I am sending it back.  It is narrow across the bust but baggy up around the shoulders and collar area.  I have gotten other things from Mordenmiss that I have liked so this may be a fluke, but it did fit oddly."
2.0,Extremely poor quality fabric. Nothing like pictured. Material is very thin. When I opened it up I discovered strings hanging all over the back and bottom. A row of sequins coming unattached. It’s also much shorter than expected. Will be returning.
2.0,Wish I hadn't.
2.0,"Cute but the sizing is WAYYYY off. Seriously, do not go by American sizing on this, go up at least one size minimum... length is fine but if you have any curves you're screwed."
2.0,It was labeled correctly but it was definitely a size and cup smaller than it should have been.
2.0,Returning for larger size
2.0,"I was thrilled when I put on the first pair  of these socks.  They were very comfortable and not bulky.  However. When I was at an appointment only 3 hours later, when I took my shoes off, I was stunned to see a hole in the toe.  Even sheer panty hose fare better than these."
2.0,The fit was as expected for American sizes. The fabric is best described as light sandpaper. Quite the opposite of soft.
2.0,My child is 5 yrs. This robe was extremely small. Go up a size or maybe even two sizes.
2.0,"I absolutely love the dress, how it fits and the color. However, I don't understand why a liner wasn't added to this. The fabric is thin, which makes it completely see through. I was disappointed."
2.0,"Bad fabric, I know they say sport fabric but it’s polyester and basically a square. No shape."
2.0,"Style is cute but Thread stick out several spots , had to return for a replacement, and still not like my expectation."
2.0,Pants are fleece!
2.0,"Disappointing...Way too small, and i've ordered similar dresses in the same size that have been great, but this is not even close.  Some of the button elastics were missing or broken.  I gave it 2 stars because the pattern was cute, and material was fine."
2.0,"While they do the job, they’re just not the same. The material is harder and the device pops out often."
2.0,Ordered an xs fits like a medium
2.0,"I love the design and it fits well, however it came broken meaning like...I pulled the plastic tab , set the time, pushed it in, and nothing ticked. I'm hoping it's just the battery which can easily be replaced but still taking time out of my day to fix something that should have came working after 6 weeks to get here."
2.0,"Nice looking watch from afar. Cheap plastic bands on it. I bought mine at a novelty shop. I knew the bands were junk when I got the watch, but it lasted less than a day."
2.0,"This hat is cute, but it doesn't really fit on average child's head.  This is something that needs to be tried on before purchase."
2.0,Is very small and near impossible to put picture inside
2.0,Darling slippers however I'm returning as the soles aren't non skid on hardwoods. Thick soles.
2.0,"Nothing against the product itself but it was too small for my 2 1/2 year old (as intended) and fit my infant much better. Even then, it was a snug fit."
2.0,It is a good quality product. My 2 stars are for the fitting
2.0,Fell part poorly made
2.0,The material is thin and the size runs small.
2.0,Ok quality but the watch is working good.
2.0,"The dress although pretty, was too tight in the arms and chest area. After trying it on moving my arms and trying to  align to my chest wasn’t happening. So disappointing because it was the perfect length, style, fit my waist and down and modesty. Ordered xl in fear of it fitting my problem areas (Chest and upper arms) Because the dress doesn’t come in a larger size in hopes to correct the problem the upper part of the dress I have to return it."
2.0,Crystals came apart in like a day and then this kept getting stuck in all types of fabric especially lace.  Avoid wearing this for a party.
2.0,"The color is nice, fabric is okay, but these socks are stiff and SO VERY THIN. I can’t imagine them being durable at all."
2.0,The product is as described.  I was looking for a bra that &#34;pushed up&#34; and this one certainly does.  The thing I didn't like about it was it also seemed to separate as well and I felt like I had two headlights in my face.  The bra was an extremely comfortable fit.  The seller could not have been better to work with.  I would buy from this seller again for sure.
2.0,"I was so exited to receive this dress for my daughter because it looks so cute on the pictures, until I got it and tried it on her to see how it looked and the zipper is cheap material that it kept getting stuck while I tried zip it up, then while I was trying to unzip it , it got really stuck."
2.0,Not very good printing. Kind of cheap looking
2.0,"I wore them twice and one earring broke while taking them out of my ear.  They are very pretty, but didn't last long."
2.0,I really like the looks of these earrings.  They sparkle and are beautiful.  Unfortunately the back pin broke on mine fairly quickly.  Not sure if the metal was thin or if I did something wrong.
2.0,They are really nice looking.  I'm a size 8 and thats what I order but they are to small.
2.0,"I putted it on and was about to leave the house when I realize and saw in the mirror that the lace part wasn’t elastic itself. Instead is just a piece of elastic strip sew in the middle of it, as it can see in the pic. It looks good, but so cheap with that elastic band there, low quality material and really it’s not confortable, thinking about to return it."
2.0,"I have another dress just like this in a medium that fits wonderful.  I wear size 8-10, so I ordered a medium in the white dress with tan floral accents.  It completely swallowed me.  The picture shows the dress to hit above the knees.  The dress hit me about mid calf, the top was way too large. Because it was so long and unfitted, it looked like a moo-moo on me.  I am returning it."
2.0,This was suppose to be orange and blue and it came red and blue 😔
2.0,Bracelet is beautiful but not magnetic. I am disappointed.
2.0,I receive the sunglasses and notice it was scratch on one of the lens. I was super excited to get these but I didn't expect them to show up they way did.
2.0,This isn't really what I'd call a tri-fold.  It's more of a bi-fold with a flap for your license and a few more cards.
2.0,Cheap and chain is stiff
2.0,I havent purchased this but i can see the glitter thats covered with hard plastic...... cant purchase something like that
2.0,My feet got sweaty. Could see sides with my shoes and not enough support for Morton’s neuroma symptoms. For me didn’t work out and I didn’t keep them.
2.0,"The replacement watch band didn't seem to want to latch correctly to the watch on one side.  The original watch band had no issues.<br />The 2 small screws holding the connector to the watch band eventually fell out.  Even after putting them back in, they will no longer provide a reliable connection.  The replacement band will not stay on the watch."
2.0,"Unfortunately the side pockets are useless.  They pouch out, and are not secure.  They are too small for a phone, and items can easily fall out.  It also looks ridiculous.  I gave it an extra star because I guess you can wear it as an undershirt though I have not bothered yet."
2.0,Returned them. They were very stiff and were never going to be comfortable.
2.0,"Thin material, i figured it would be a dress length but it was a long shirt. There was a hole on the back where a tag should have been."
2.0,To small and didn't fit right
2.0,"My husband ordered me a sweatshirt from this brand for Christmas in my normal size, and it was too small. So I ordered a different sweatshirt (same brand, just a different pattern that was more my taste) and sized up, but it was still too small!! So I would definitely recommend sizing up at least one, if not two, sizes. I did like that the sleeves were long, as I've had issues with the sleeves not being very long on other items I've bought from Amazon."
2.0,"These aren't really chino shorts- the fabric is far too lightweight to qualify them as chinos. I'm returning them because I don't think they'll stand up to an active life. Also, they run small. If you are looking for very lightweight shorts, order a size up."
2.0,"Too small, not noticeable."
2.0,This could easily pass for a 2 or 3 XXL. Sizing is HUGE!
2.0,I wear a large but it was a still too big and fit was off. Shorts were too high and top portion came down too low.
2.0,Very cheap looking very cheaply made wouldn’t order it again for my granddaughter she needed it so she kept it I really don’t know how much wear she’ll get out of it. really long also
2.0,So pretty but broke on first time wearing 😔
2.0,I ordered the bathing suit as an extra large according to the size chart but I think maybe a medium or a large would’ve been better so I would say size down. I am thicker at the bottom than top.
2.0,The product finally arrived after a three month wait.  The shoe barely fit my 6 year old grandson who is growing quickly.  There is absolutely no excuse for that delay.  Never again.
2.0,I actually hated this dress on me and I returned it. I’m petite and only 5’1 and ordered x small dress. It was very long and loose and it looked like I was wearing my grandmothers curtains. I’m very upset I could not wear this dress because I was really looking forward to it! 😕
2.0,"Some of the black buttons on this shirt we’re broken and there are a lot of loose threads. This shirt is also a little big, would have liked if the small was an actual small."
2.0,This runs a size small. I purchased to wear out with my husband. I could barely zip it. I'm a size 12 and ordered an XL. It looks great on the hanger though .
2.0,The bag doesn't sit well and the handle is on the flapb so it doesn't sit well
2.0,"The shirt looked cute on, but the sleeves fit weird and went down too low and draped awkwardly down my arms. The sleeves need to be tightened and tied as well, which just looked like a lot of strings. The material was surprisingly thick which I didn’t like as a summer top."
2.0,"I know this is supposed to be a ""distressed"" or ""vintage"" t-shirt, but the color was off on my shirt.  Instead of being gold (a faded gold would have been fine), the shield logo was almost a shade of green.<br /><br />Fitment is true to size."
2.0,It has a smell like it has been sitting in a damp warehouse and when you touch it the smell remains on your fingers but the style is very nice.
2.0,This item is too large to be a travel storage case.  Something much smaller and more compact would be ideal.
2.0,"I have tried at least four times now to get some dark red leggings to go with a dress/tunic I have. Evidently they don't exist. Even if the seller tells me, ""Yes, they are a true red"" they are all the same, a bright cerise/magenta pink, cherry color. NOT RED! I'm tired of this.<br /><br />Almost all of these sellers are selling exactly the same leggings, from the same manufacturer, often in the exact same product packaging. Sometimes they even sell them interchangeably, saying that they are selling you Santina, and then sending one pair of Santina brand and one pair of Always brand, exactly the same. So just figure out who is selling them the cheapest, for Pete's sake.<br /><br />I guess I have to give up on finding red leggings. Who would have thought that buying red leggings could be an impossibility?"
2.0,Okay product for the price. Turned fingers green though
2.0,"Ordered orange leg warmers, but they are a yellow/gold color. Did not appear like the image."
2.0,The circle pattern is on the front crotch area and is not stitched evenly. Looks funny! I have not worn I need a long shirt to cover up area. Fit is good...material is ok. I give it 2 in a half stars.
2.0,I wasn’t expecting amazing quality but these are unwearable. They are so bent and misshapen that they cannot be used.
2.0,"After trying them on the first time, there is already a run in them. Definitely more like tights than leggings"
2.0,I loved the looks of it but didn’t realize how short it was!
2.0,"This watch was very hard to read, so it was returned."
2.0,They were okay til I started loosing the stones
2.0,Breaks so easily. Pack didn’t last a week.
2.0,"Not the same as ""normal"" USA sizes."
2.0,2 stars because it is a cute dress but it would not go over my chest. Zipper broke also!
2.0,"They’re super comfortable, almost too long for me (guess I could’ve gotten the shorter one). However, when I did the “bend” test, you could read every word on the tag. Not only that, but you could see EVERYTHING.<br />I’m really upset because I really, really wanted to like these. Just thin material I guess."
2.0,"There is no shape to this. It's a rectangle. I have an hourglass shape. This dress looks terrible on me. I would have to wear a belt, which wouldn't help."
2.0,"Disappointed. It looks like someone’s dog chewed on the toggle, the elastic is all dirty and the headband is soiled. It’s clearly been worn and then resold. Gross"
2.0,Sound is alright for the price but airy. The hat its self is the problem. Very bulky and uncomfortable where the speakers are. Hurts the ears for sure! In theory it would be great but it’s just not  executed well at all.
2.0,Dress runs small and its not as attractive as the pic. Will give it away.
2.0,Loved them but the pins are very soft and bent when putting the backs on and have now snapped off. I was only able to wear them about 5 times. Very disappointed.
2.0,"XL is not for Extra Large, it is for Extra Long! And the size of the pants is for a very petite tall person. I've got to figure out a way to get these hemmed. I'm an average height of 5'5&#34; so that is not an issue. There is at least 3 inches to take off and still have a long enough hem to hit the floor!"
2.0,I thought it would fit but it was way to small.  I am short but a plus size.  From the design I thought it would fi.
2.0,Bought for a bachelorette party. It does not have much material at all and it is paper thin ! You can see every part of your body through it. Good for wearing one time but I will probably never wear again !
2.0,"I was ecstatic about my new gloves with all the unique features, waterproof, touch screen, -30 Warmth. The gloves were indeed comforting, touch screen worked just fine. However, when I had to snow blow my driveway as well as two of my neighbors, I realized how COLD my fingertips were. The wind was not blowing and it was not that cold, but apparently too cold for these gloves. I am highly disappointed. I believe I will be returning them to find a pair that is waterproof and warm forget the touch screen features. The search will begin."
2.0,"I was surprised at how cheap the material was. Not impressed by the fabric nor the shape of the gown, nothing sexy about it at all. In my humble opinion not worth the amount of money paid."
2.0,"Way too short, have to tighten everything up to get enough slack to tie them."
2.0,"I love everything about them, with two exceptions. The first being they collect lint like crazy; this can be managed. Second, they were slightly so short to begin with, but I swear they shrunk another three whole inches. I am a slender male 6'1"" tall, 33"" waist x 32"" long (inseam)."
2.0,"These are just ok. Quality of seams is not great. Fabric is not great. These would be fine for the price if they were not too short. I wanted to use them under my work shirts, but these don't always stay tucked in - frustrating. They got shorter after being washed."
2.0,Was not like as pictured. Returned it.
2.0,Poor quality. The headband is terrible and nothing like the picture. The only reason we're keeping this is our daughter likes the cape.<br />Don't waste your money.
2.0,I really wanted to like this blouse but the fit was too tight and too short. If you purchase make sure to size up
2.0,"Obviously did not buy these for the quality, you get what you pay for.  The polish one on pair of earrings faded away after 2 wears."
2.0,"Looks beautiful, material is soft, but way too small. Ordered a 3x thinking that with 2 sizes larger I had a chance at fitting it. Nope, so I gave it to my size small friend. Fits her great."
2.0,"I got an extra small, and they fit great, other than around the crotch. They feel great and the color is beautiful, but I can't really wear them because they look very odd and baggy."
2.0,The Small was way too big for my frame (5'3&#34; and about 105 ILBS). Looked like a sack!  I gave it to my coworker who is taller and maybe a typical Medium. She said it fit her okay. Super cute on the model!
2.0,"Overall, okay"
2.0,Angel wings don't go up like that.
2.0,"It was the correct size, but not really cotton or “breathable” at all. It felt more like a cheap Halloween costume. I also ordered this shirt in black and it was made of a better material. It’s very weird that the 2 shirts were different."
2.0,They're too small<br />I wasted money
2.0,"Cheap, gold and silver color rubbed iff first weear."
2.0,This dress doesn't have as much fabric as the LuLu's dress. I ended up being able to borrow the LuLu's version of this dress and it was way better quality and covered the chest better.
2.0,It’s cute but the diamond fell out the first day I wore it :(
2.0,Sweater is nice and made pretty well but runs HUGE. I’m normally a small and feel like this fits like XL! I like my sweaters a bit cozy and big but this is beyond that. I’m bummed I have to return it! Also. They don’t offer XS.
2.0,Doesn't look like that in person..Very ard to make it look that way..Glad I didn't payy a lot for it.
2.0,Too dark even on bright days.
2.0,bulky for me
2.0,Lights stopped working after a month.
2.0,"I know you get a lot for a little, but it really doesn't matter if one pair breaks and you lose an earring from another because the backs don't hold the earring securely. I walked around for god knows how long lopsided with only 1 hoop in. Would not buy again."
2.0,Me llego dañado
2.0,"Color was so far off from what the item photo displayed. Very disappointed. I was expecting a dark green/blue color and what I got was a bright sea foam green. Shirt is a weird material too, not what I was expecting for a waffle knit. Overall, poor quality."
2.0,Most sneakers require 6 each and only comes with 5 for each
2.0,Center stones look like cheap fake turquoise.  There is no shine. It is flat plastic.  Unimpressed.
2.0,Pictured is a large. The shirt is stretchy hut did not fit the bill. A more prominent properly sewn shoulder pad would have done the intended style justification.
2.0,The image looks like a sticker that is just slapped on the hat and poorly placed on. I measured the image and it is 2 inches by 1 inch. Smaller than expected. fast delivery.
2.0,Haven't been able to wear them yet. Will try again when the swelling goes down a little more. Got a few other pairs without zippers and one of those &#34;donners&#34; that help get the socks on and that works out for me. Will &#34;update&#34; this review when and if I am able to get the zippered socks on.
2.0,"The stones are completely white, they don't even remotely look ""opal-like"""
2.0,It is extremely tight like the others have said (sizes are not accurate.) The description of the item is deceiving because it says Redu Shaper and it is clearly a knockoff. The material is cheap.
2.0,"That’s dress had a very odd fit. It was snug and fit well around my body, but the sleeves were very loose and the small straps just hung off. If I had gone a size smaller, it would not have fit. Had to return"
2.0,Makes you think you are buying 3 pair but it is only 1.  Not a good fit.
2.0,You get what you pay for. The fit is great and the material is soft but it is definitely not panty-line friendly. The fabric is pretty thin so I can't imagine wearing this to the gym (or anywhere out for that matter).
2.0,This is very small.
2.0,"Very, very tiny hoops. Looks bigger in the picture."
2.0,"I only give this product two stars because of how excited I was at first sight (one star). So cute very fetch whatever. When I looked more closer I noticed that the stitching of the heart was already coming apart. My co worker noticed it on the sides of the bag. Anyways, I let that go because I thought it was super cute regardless. But then worse came to worse. After leaving an appointment the strap of this bag completely ripped off. I was only carrying two lipsticks and my money so heaviness is out of the question. I give a second star because it was very simple and convenient to return this item. I had the option to return to a nearby Kohl’s without worries about the shipping and handling. Kohl’s  employees took care of that and offered me a 25% store discount which I used after for a gift. So it worked out but I’m disappointed that I couldn’t keep the bag. It was very cute but not worth it for me and anyone else who won’t like falling apart items. No :/"
2.0,This shirt runs small wish I would of known that.
2.0,Not very good quality. One fell apart as I was taking the back off to wear it for the first time. Save your money.
2.0,The material of the shoes is too hard and it does not feel comfortable for my toddler
2.0,These are not the same shorts in the photo
2.0,Other than one lens being distorted with an uneven finish the lens are not bad.
2.0,"Needs a bigger waist band as it is too lose around the waist. Would have rated higher, but keeps slipping down after being worn for a short period of time. Defiantly needs a bigger pouch as it crushes everything. Needs to be redesigned with a bigger waist band and bigger pouch."
2.0,Small. Need to order 1 1/2 size larger.  I ordered a 9. Which is size I wear  It was like a 7 1/2. Sent back
2.0,"Shipping was fast and that's where my happy ends. The stones did not at all resemble the photo. We got a clear glass instead of opal looking stone, a plain black instead of the pretty marble looking one in the photo and the turquoise was plain without the lines. Very disappointed."
2.0,Runs large. All jersey material. Ok quality to wear for daytime and runningverands but not to dress up.
2.0,"Not cotton/spandex.....more like polyester, the spandex is the elastic in the waistband"
2.0,"Look great and break really, really easily."
2.0,had no idea there was a waist band - good for thin people but not us size 14 ladies ... bummer cuz the color is amazing!
2.0,The red is NOT red. I can't find any true red bands. This one is more orange looking.
2.0,Material was weirdly thick and did not lay nicely.
2.0,love the color not so much the material and was small even though got bigger size
2.0,Sizing is not accurate at all. I have many different welding caps of this size and this one is the only one that is 2 sizes too big!
2.0,"This is an almost perfect product, but the almost makes it far from perfect, the problem is that most nose bridges around the world (if not all) are oily, the resting area of the glasses is highly sleek and add to that the nose oil, before you blink a couple of times, the glasses are already sliding towards the center of the earth, not so much because of gravity but because the surface of the resting area in not adequate, the material used is far inadequate and makes this item impossible to be useful. I'm thinking to sand the tips to have some kind of traction, maybe. The thinkoptics are great at that, they will stay on the bridge, even if you shake your head vigorously, but they get scratched terribly easy."
2.0,"I bout this dress and polka dot shoes for the red night on my sister's honeymoon cruise. I was disappointed because the material was too thin, very tight around my breast area. Most disappointing was the seam of the dress was in the front right down the middle and tge tag was in the back of dress so I knew I was putting it on  correctly. I can't wear it again so I've waisted my money."
2.0,"Way bigger and chunkier, looks likes kid's jewelry. Also very low quality, looks like it was hot glued together. The chain is very cheap too, which is fair because of the price"
2.0,"Worked for about 5 weeks, then stopped working (with new batteries- not a battery issue). So if you’re looking for wheel lights for a weekend at Burning Man, these are prob fine. If you’re a daily bike commuter like me, and looking for lights for long term use to make a nighttime commute safer, these are not the lights for you."
2.0,Please state that the item is smaller than it look. Size up...
2.0,Shirt material was strange- almost like a swim shirt. Just didnt look right for a normal everyday shirt
2.0,These were for my toe. However they are so thin and bendable I’m afraid they would break.
2.0,bag has an odor that won't go away. Must be materials it is made from
2.0,The material was like a cotton...I thought it was a polyester...go one size smaller.
2.0,It's a cool hat and I thought I would wear it evyday but when I got it the bill was a a little deformed and didn't feel good to wear as my others. Its a nice hat to give to a kid if you want to give them a cool hat that they will destroy or get dirty or stained.
2.0,"I found that the thickness of the case was greater then expected. As a result, I returned the item. Couldn't rate anything else."

2.0,"It’s very thin material, feels like single sheet polyester with a sheen to it."
2.0,"Cheap looking. Thought it would look cute, but it looks very cheap. Plastic looking beads."
2.0,It’s gold plated and will turn black and peel off
2.0,White dots don't look like pearls and start popping off immediately.<br />Masks themselves are comfortable once I took all the dots off
2.0,Way too small.  Thin cotton.  Not at all like the Jockey Elance which is terrific.
2.0,I was super disappointed because the color wasn't at all what i was expecting. I ended up returning It. It was a cute sweater
2.0,It looks undone and unfinished.
2.0,"Very small, poor quality"
2.0,I can't seem to get the camera to turn off or respond at all right out of the box hoping to get a refund or exchange. The video I was able to record I recorded from the app and it seems like good quality. Going to try and let the battery die and power it back up and see if it works.
2.0,Very cheap looking. Would be okay as a ring but not a wedding band.
2.0,"The shirt looks nice, however; the sizes are off. I am usually a large but when I received the shirt it looked and fit more like a small."
2.0,"Looks much better in the picture.  I'm not petite, by any stretch, but I'm not huge.  I bought the XL, as I am large-busted (38DD).  It was pretty close-fitting and not flattering, so I returned it.  Had no issue returning it - received my credit right away."
2.0,I got the wrong dress it’s still cute it even has pockets and buttons but it isn’t the one I Ordered nvm I put it on backwards 😂
2.0,I guess you get what you pay for. Very low quality and only lasted about 4 wears before they started falling apart
2.0,pros: the phone holder is handy<br /><br />cons: the zipper gives you the most awful chafing on your chest. and to add salt to the wound (literally) - if you wear it while running/working out the sweat rolls down into the cuts and it burns. i can't wear anything low-cut for days after running in this bra because i have these hideous sores. it's also very difficult to zip it without 3 hands.
2.0,This skirt was inexpensive . The quality of the material is not good. It feels very rough and almost plastic like. Shame because the bird print is cute.
2.0,Quality of Alfred Dunner label going down! I find no longer worth my money!
2.0,"These look nice, but after one wearing, they tarnish . They also tangle so badly that it’s impossible to get them untangled."
2.0,I ordered a 2XL and they looked like they would be a men's size Medium. WAY off in size!
2.0,I honestly expected more based on the description.. however since my grandson thought it was OK.. we'll keep it
2.0,Kinda gross and synthetic looking. I was about to return it and realized it was cheap so I guess it made sense. Definitely not “High quality”. It’s fine for one day but not recommended. It’s gross to the touch.
2.0,"Thud purse is big and very nice looking but when I'm carrying it around not using the shoulder strap the other straps literally come undone and I have to sit there and restrap them. Its like a belt, you have to put them through one metal clip and out the other to reattach. I don't think that's very functional."
2.0,"A soft robe should have a flexible, relatively soft zipper.  But not this one!  Way too stiff and uncomfotable for lounging around."
2.0,wasnt really useful. didnt fit right. stiff and hurts
2.0,Used it once and there was a big hole in the inside pocket. My things that were in the pocket fell into the lining of the bag. Very poorly made
2.0,Was tight in bad areas amd loose where you want it tight couldnt workout in them because I kept having to pull them back up. They are made SMALL
2.0,"Received Umbrella today.  Pulled it out of the box and the lower mounting pole was missing and the slip on protective cover was missing.  Now I have to pull all the labels off the box, attach a return label to the box and take it to a UPS store for a return.  Additionally I obviously can't use it and have to wait again for the shipment of another umbrella that, hopefully, had all the pieces and in good condition.<br />On the positive side, it looks like the umbrella is exactly as advertised although we cannot use it.."
2.0,The top is awkwardly small and very short
2.0,"i’m a small & ordered that. way too big, fit like a large"
2.0,El pantalón me encantó solo que vino con un gran defecto ..una pierna más larga que la otra
2.0,Well they began to peel off and bubble before he even got to use them. The matte is great but the quality is low. I am unimpressed with the quality but the design is great.
2.0,Love the dress . It was too small had a hard time trying to return the dress. UPS was to expensive to return. USPS was cheaper to return the item.
2.0,It Was Too Small For Me But A Very Beautiful Bathing Suit. I'll Surly Size Up If I Buy In The Future
2.0,Didn’t care for the color. Wasn’t a pretty pink.<br />Didn’t like the fit.
2.0,"Super cheap, got scratches on them almost right away. They're small than I thought they would be, they're stiff and uncomfortable, I would not recommend these."
2.0,"These are foam water shoes that definitely fit the ""light"" category.  I do question how long they will last with kids running around on both paved and unpaved surfaces.  The foam is not very dense and I'm guessing will wear quite quickly.<br /><br />I can't comment on the size as I took a risk and ordered them hoping they would fit one of my three children.  The ""34"" size on the bottom fit my 10 yo.  I have no idea what this equates to on their shoe sizing scale ...<br /><br />They seem comfortable (as my oldest confirmed) and are fairly easy to get on and off.  My concern is there are no drain holes flush with the inside of the shoe so once water gets in, it is not getting out.  There is a good 1/2 to 3/4 centimeter gap between the inside sole and the holes.<br /><br />All in all, these would be great for the beach if you are planning on running in the water but don't want to go bare foot.  I wouldn't pay $24 for them though ... likely more like $5-$6 considering the quality and likely longevity."
2.0,I like the fit of these pants but both pocket zippers failed on the first time wearing them. There are also some fraying of threads on seams. I bought these in advance of a hiking trip later this year to test them out and unfortunately I'm going to keep looking for a little more durable pant.
2.0,"Steel linked bands should always be supplemented by fine adjustment at the latching part of the band a few holes that change the size by a small degree.  This band does not include this fine adjustment method.  Without this feature some wrist sizes will see a slightly too large, or slightly too tight fit.  Mine was that size."
2.0,Way smaller and shorter than pictured.  I am size 12 and ordered a large..  it stretches to fit but skin tight ad very short.  Also very thin material so can't wear a cami under it and can see bra...
2.0,Color is weird for the brown jacket. It’s like a rust color almost and not as pretty as the photo
2.0,"my belt came damege , i will reorder again today because is to late for mr to return it."
2.0,I think my stone is actually plastic....
2.0,super small in the waist and no stretch
2.0,They sit up higher than normal glasses. Like they're about to float off your face
2.0,While the leggings were not see through and did fit true to size there was a MAJOR design flaw to the point that I could not wear them. Leggings should not have anatomy. Lucky I had a backup costume
2.0,I gave them away
2.0,These are cute but the moment I put one on the flower fell off. I wore one for about an hour before it broke. Had to fix them with hot glue myself.
2.0,"The dress fits great but extremely see through. You can see your undergarments very clearly. I don’t get how dress makers can’t think of this very basic step in making dresses. I tried it with a thong, very soft underwear and it still shows everything. Very disappointed."
2.0,"I’m a huge fan of the split open back shirts and own 4 different brands.<br />Unfortunately this is my least favorite and least flattering too.<br />My normal size is medium but I ordered large purposefully hoping it would be more loose on me providing me enough room to tie back if I wanted. There’s no way, I will be comfortable tying this shirt back as it will turn form fitting.<br />The large fit me like a medium so I suggest ordering up one size.<br />Also if you’re on the taller side (I’m 5’6”, 32DD, 137 lbs), the length will fit similar to a crop top which I personally am not comfortable wearing.<br />The material is very soft, light, but wish it was longer in length and fit my body better."
2.0,"I should have listened to the reviews that talked about the smell of this thing.  Some sort of old lady perfume, very strong, and hasn't gone away after 2 washes.  It's an okay scarf, but the smell is unbearable."
2.0,The shirt in small women’s size is gigantic - may fit my size L husband
2.0,a small is giant !! and for over $40 :(
2.0,If you want to look like you are wearing a plastic trash bag these are the pants for you!  They are SO shiny. I’m really disappointed because I have been looking for pants in this style and haven’t had any luck. I ordered a medium and they fit well. I just couldn’t tolerate the shiny fabric. So back they will go and the search continues ☹️
2.0,Just ok. You can see through it so whatever you're wearing underneath can be seen.
2.0,"This is a nicely crafted boot, but the snakeskin part had a kind of sparkly shimmer to it.  It wasn't what I was expecting at all.  Unfortunately, I had to return them."
2.0,"Didn’t like the fabric, it is a bit scratchy and stiff so it doesn’t fit like in the photo. The sizing was also off."
2.0,Weird fit with the straps. They were almost too long and just couldn’t make it work
2.0,Graphic is positioned too low. Does not look right when wearing. Shirt and quality is good. Design layout and position fail.
2.0,"Too small for a large, gave it to a friend because it’s inconvenient to return , the purpose of online is yo not go out."
2.0,"I bought this a size up because I was expecting to use it as a swim cover up for vacation, but the chest was still incredibly tight, and I'm not a large chested girl. The color and pattern was beautiful and the fabric was soft and lightweight, but the top seemed really small compared to the rest of the dress.."
2.0,Bought this for my daughter for her birthday because of the cute chevron print. It's the perfect size for her. But the stitching fell apart after 5 months of occasional use. She would only keep her phone and some money in it so its not like she overloaded it with stuff.
2.0,"Meh, totally disappointed it's made of cloth rather than the same material as the wallet. The shape, size, color, strap size are all good. It's just that darn cloth. I'll probably replace it first chance I get."
2.0,"I'm 5’4”, weigh 130, and flat chested. I usually wear a small/medium but after reading several reviews for this item, I decided to purchase a large. I will say the color and material are great; however, the fit is off. It’s a weird fit in the armpit area, making me feel like I’m going to rip the shirt like the hulk when I move my arms. It’s also causing the shirt to ride up above my chest creating a weird look. My arms are thin, but the arms on the shirt are loose in some areas and tight in others, not consistent. I really wanted to like this shirt, but unfortunately the fit was too awkward."
2.0,Very unsatisfied price was not supposed to be with the ring cause it was a gift
2.0,"The fabric is not good, it gives you the feeling of it being cheap. Also, maybe it was because of the color I got (beige) but my underwear is completely visible in these."
2.0,"Two months later both bands are in the trash because the plastic around wear the pin sits broke easily, very flimsy plastic on there."
2.0,I wasn’t impressed with the quality of this product. It feels cheap and is a little bigger than expected. I wouldn’t purchase again.
2.0,"I will say, this dress is beautiful! I really wanted this to work. Unfortunately, too much of my 5’5 130lbs frame, is torso. So even under the best circumstances, I had a solid 2” of cheek that was covered by the sheer lace portion only. I will be returning this, but wish they could make this with just a slightly longer slip under the lace portion."
2.0,The seam rolled up the 1st time I wore it and I haven’t been able to straighten it out.
2.0,Bought the sunflower dress it is really cute amd fits great but gave it 2 stars because it is all around see through so now I either have to buy a slip to go under it or return it dont want the whole world seeing my goodies
2.0,The bottom seem ripped open as I attempted to pull it from the overhead compartment
2.0,too thin and the back in nothing like the picture .
2.0,Haven't worn them in too long and its already missing a stone. Just started wearing them even though purchased in November.  I'm very upset. Not really worth the money.
2.0,"They are cute and comfortable, however they are completely disposable. I wore them once and they were too ripped to wear again."
2.0,Might work well for someone not active or moving a lot. Second time out it started ripping up: shoulder strap and handle ripped off. Pouch inside ripped to where things got lost inside kitties stuffing. Not well made at all.
2.0,I wasn't allowed to return this and the size I got was a 2X and it was to small. Can't even wear as shirt
2.0,They’re cheaply made and gathered on the bottom.. definitely not worth the price!!!
2.0,Very soft and warm but really flimsy. Have to adjust frequency to keep them from falling off.
2.0,"I have a set of these in gray from Costco and LOVE them. I bought these for a 2nd pair, as Costco quit selling them. My Costco Set has been through at least a dozen washes (cold) and dries (low) and have retained their size beautifully.<br /><br />These, however, are like odd yoga capris. They are an EASY 5” shorter in the legs. I really do not like that at all.  I cannot tell if they shrunk or if they were made that short (I washed before I wore them because they’re the same size & product, right?). The model on the advertising here shows full-length bottoms. I suspect this seller purchased irregulars & is selling them here."
2.0,"Super cute slippers, but my daughter needed slippers with a rubber sole - this slipper advertises rubber sole ... but it is not rubber, so it will  ot work for what we want.  They were expensive for just a slipper, and we are disappointed that it won't work for us.  Super cute ... but not what we are looking for."
2.0,"I knew when ordering this item, after reading reviews, it would be a hit or miss. Being that it only set me back $6 I can't expect too much. I received the item in just 9 days, which is awesome as I needed it before the &#34;expected date.&#34; However, upon opening the package and examining it, it appears to be missing a charm/bead. Right in the front where it is noticeable. The color is pretty much exactly what I expected, not darker like some reviews said. Other than the missing piece it is what I expected. I will just try to move one from the bottom to fill the gap."
2.0,"Too small in the waist, had to return. Good quality coat and very good service. I recommend them."
2.0,did not like those. looks cheap. i love animal print but this is picture perfect for flintstones. it is fabric & has a bamboo shoot piece across. must say they did not feel uncomfortable & run true to the size. it just does not look the same in real life. i returned it.
2.0,Nice beach print and vert soft fabric. I have used it to sleep in cause it is so soft.
2.0,Product looked promising but became sort of unusable just after 2-3 uses as it would not seal around eyes and thus would fill up with water.
2.0,"I bought this item because I loved the vibrant colors and pattern and because it was on sale. However, I normally wear a size Small and the Small in this vest was too short and my husband complained that it was a very inappropriate style for a woman of mature age.  I have decided to save it for my daughter when she is older."
2.0,Cheap. Not happy with it. One wash and there was thread from this shirt wrapped around all my other cloths. It has an odd fit. Just not good at all. The pic added is some of the thread that came off in the first wash
2.0,Runs small.  Order size up.
2.0,"Two things would have made this bracelet better. A beter clasp, and the metal of the clasp. The metal is plated, and poorly at that. It is a copper alloy underneath and it already showing through on mine.Not a good buy. It's going back"
2.0,Clasps tight for a while then loosened and kept falling off wrist.  Not worth it.  Would buy more expensive band. It did look good was the reason for the 2 stars
2.0,"Cute , but not very good quality."
2.0,Have to be at least 5 to fit it in their mouth.
2.0,"Cute boots but the shaft of the boot doesn't stretch at all, so it was impossible to get onto my toddler's feet. I had to return."
2.0,"They seem to be good socks, a couple pairs seems to have tiny tears where the colors come together though. I sure hope they last a little while before becoming a larger hole 😭"
2.0,"I have a few of these hats, the quality of this one was not up to par, much smaller and much lighter"
2.0,The print on the one I got is not the picture
2.0,Cute in picture but not so when opened it. Small and doesn't fold over as pictured.
2.0,"Threads everywhere, horrible quality control. Also not a super heavyweight hoodie, it's a medium, weight. Waste of money, don't purchase. If your looking for a great hoodie go with Peak Velocity heavyweight hoodie, excellent quality."
2.0,Falls down on heel. Not real happy w/ them
2.0,Wore it for about a month and it is already falling apart. Had to change to another band. Great shipping and order process.
2.0,The earrings look more attractive in the picture than the earrings that were delivered.
2.0,Length was fine but material was too clingy.
2.0,"I got a large, and the chest was way too tight."
2.0,"I loved the look of this band, and loved that it had an actual clasp because it felt more secure than a regular Apple Watch band. However, every time I tried to wear this, the cheap metal of the clasp would break the underside of my wrist out in a TERRIBLE rash that would get itchy and scabby and last for days after wearing it just once. I tried to coat the clasp in clear nail polish so it wasn’t directly touching my skin - no luck, it still irritated the skin. If you’re not sensitive to cheap metals, this would be a good buy, but if you are, definitely steer clear."
2.0,Very large and too big for me.  Did not lay flat.  Returned
2.0,They don't work well at all.
2.0,This cannot be considered a tunic.  It's just a long hemmed blouse.  Order at least 1 size up.  The t-shirt is not stretchy so there is NO flexiibilty.
2.0,Had a marker stain on them I love the way they fit and feel Just bummed out it was stained w/ a sharpie type .5 in line
2.0,"Disappointed. Was so excited because they were so pretty online. Got mine in the mail and one of the earrings was different than the other because it was messed up. It had a bubble in it, was dull looking and did not have as much glitter as the other one. Returned them :( and was scared if I reordered them they would be messed up too."
2.0,"After two years the lenses are cloudy with permanent spots in the lenses. Make sure your ray bans are from Italy, as this vendor has found a cheap source for want to be Ray Bans. Aviator sunglasses by the real Ray Ban folks don't cloud up or get spotty. China for sure!"
2.0,not as warm as I would have hoped. Kinda thin for winter tights & fluffy inside is MAYBE a half inch thick. the stretch is not stretchy enough it reaches its limit really quickly. I've had better & warmer winter tights.
2.0,Much darker than pictured. Comfortable but wish it was the color pictured.
2.0,"These are not what I would think of as skinny jeans. They are high waisted mom jeans. Make sure you notice the unfinished hem at the bottom of the legs. It looks much better in the picture. In person, it honestly looks like they just forgot to finish them."
2.0,Does not support weight well and will bend like it is a hair tie
2.0,Material too thin; too stretchy. Not comfortable for me. RETURNED.
2.0,"Belt was beautiful at first, but the stones fell off way too easy! I would not buy this again"
2.0,"I mean, I’ll keep them, but they’re SUPER small. Not what I was expecting."
2.0,Love the top. Not very supportive<br />Bottoms run small
2.0,"First, this ""package deal"" arrived without the hood and no hood arrived separately. I only received the gown and tam. Second, while this gown seems very well made with nice material and piping and workmanship, WOW the arms and shoulders looked absolutely ridiculous. My kids started laughing and said I looked like a roblox character. Had to return. I ordered another of these with a different ""brand name"" and they do seem to be manufactured by the same co, but that one had more proportional shoulders and arms. You can check my other reviews if you're curious about it."
2.0,"The blouse was fine enough but the smell was atrocious. I did not read one review about the smell beforehand, so maybe I have the only gasoline/ skunk/ onion infused blouse out there. I'm on my third washing and I can still smell it."
2.0,"It's a cute dress but it is absolutely HUGE! I probably could have fit 2 of my daughter in this dress. It might fit her in a couple years though, so I guess I'll keep it."
2.0,"It just kept opening, in fact of them did the same, which indicates that it may be more normal than defective for these belts"
2.0,Dropped my ring on my bathroom tile and it shattered! Looked great until that happened.
2.0,Not true to size...... I bought a small and it didn’t not fit. It’s too big! Plus the dress does not look like it does on the photos. It also fits weird.
2.0,"These socks aren't worth the trouble. First of all, the ivory colored socks arrived with dirt on them from the factory. Gross! I also find that in the black pair, one sock is longer than the other. I'm pretty sure I got a defective bunch because overall, these socks just don't hold up as well as I'd hoped. Not worth the price!"
2.0,It looks good but broke after few uses. Not strong for toddlers use.
2.0,The fabric is way too stretchy for larger women. I wanted to use it for a post mastectomy breast form but yikes! They ended up horribly uneven.
2.0,"Not that I expected much for the price, but very low quality, they don't stay on your ear :/ I took a file to them, smoothed them out and then re-finished them, put rubber in the hole to make them wearable, but they did not come working or wearable..."
2.0,"The Pendent was ok very cloudy not clear that you can see the tree very well at all,  the chain looked very used not just antique in color no shine to it at all very dull not something I will wear!"
2.0,"Small at the shaft , fit the foot."
2.0,"I loved these overalls, but unfortunately, after wearing them for a few short hours, one of the buckles broke."
2.0,These things fell apart so fast I didn't even know what happened. I loved them at first for the fit and comfortable padding. But they quickly tore apart with light daily use.
2.0,I got these in two colors the pink and a lighter glittery pink. The pink pink once my baby got them dirty and I had to wash with soap they became discolored! Only after being used once they looked like my daughter had used them for ages! The glittery pink since it's another fabric they haven't got discolored. Fingers crossed they stay that way!
2.0,"The dress is cute overall, size up though. Plus I am tall, the dress hardly covers what it needs to."
2.0,Thought they were MUCH BIGGER although cute pattern.
2.0,Runs way to small.Waste of $$$$$$$$$$$ if it shrinks even more.
2.0,The strap is advertised as being 1/2” in width. The strap we received is 1/4” in width. Very disappointing.
2.0,I wear a 38D bra and the dress was to tight over my chest...i cut strap in the back and it fits better but doesnt look great
2.0,"Loved the design and material, however it runs small, had to return"
2.0,I didn't realize that it was polyester before I placed my order. I can't do polyester and that certainly goes twice in summer. I gave it to my sister.
2.0,Cheap looks like Halloween costume
2.0,The sweater was in a vacuum sealed package that was 5inches by 5 inches. I don’t know that the wrinkles will come out or not. The picture shows a thick sweater and it’s really pretty thin.
2.0,"I ordered these for my 11-year-old daughter to wear. When I tested them before even giving them to her, I noticed that the one comes apart with very little effort.  I thought the post fit into the hoop, but it doesn't.  It relies on a tiny little notch on the post and on the hoop. Will be sending them back as the one will be lost relatively quickly."
2.0,Did not have structure....I don’t know if it was only meant to be an at home lazy clothes but I wouldn’t wear it out unless I tweaked it
2.0,These are attractive. The metallic pairs are white on the back and as they dangle and spin you can tell. That was frustrating to me. The black pair is black on back so no worries. They are thin and cheap. They wear well. All in all I would not order again.
2.0,"Quality is good but flower size is too small  ,should be little big..."
2.0,Fit like a potato sack. I got the size they recommended and it was somehow way too baggy but also very tight across the chest (34D). Might be that I got far too large a size but smaller would not have fit my chest. Returned it
2.0,"Had to return - the XL top fits like a M, bottoms fit like a L. Top had no stretch, so it wasn't even just a clingy small fit, it was like a strait jacket. Also way too short - even if it was bigger it wouldn't have covered enough of my XL-needing midriff."
2.0,The shirt was very long. It fit like a dress. Was not appropriate
2.0,"I've had these shoes for a season now and really wanted to like them.  They look cute on but the heel has a bulge that you can feel when you step into these shoes, it's almost like there is not enough padding in the sole of the shoe.  I tried to ignore it but after a day of wearing these, the pain was unbearable.  I ended up having to put a large blister pad on the sole of the shoe and then a gel sole cover over that and it seemed to work but i was still disappointed to say the least.  They feel a bit cheap also so this was not a good purchase for me."
2.0,Expected a better material. Embroidery looks poor. Beads were already loose. Returning it.
2.0,"Very disappointed in this necklace. It may say sterling silver but it tarnishes very fast and very easily for a necklace. I wore it once, put it in my jewelry case and went to wear it a couple of weeks later and it was all brown and tarnished. I had to use silver dip to brighten it back up to silver. I have to do this every time I wear it. Waste of money. Won't buy from this company again."
2.0,Just too close around the neck I felt like it was choking me. I gave it to goodwill.
2.0,Feels good just not great quality if u bend over defiantly can see through!
2.0,the pendant is as advertised but the chain broke before my wife wore it -- while a trip to Target fixed the problem it was an embarrassing gift
2.0,It seems good and sturdy but if you take it in water it's not good.  Water gets in the case and you have to remove the watch too dry it and the inside of the case even if you wait hours the water won't dry unless you take the watch out.
2.0,Great design but about 2-3 sizes too small.  The sizing is not accurate at all!!
2.0,It’s tarnishing already.
2.0,I wanted to give this a 5 star but one thing about this pair of paints is bs. Material is nice and everything was awesome till I tried to put my keys in my pocket. Ripped a whole through the pocket with ease! The material used for the pockets is unbelievable cheap... So aggravated.
2.0,The size of the design is not as large as pictured and the color of the red crawfish is not as bright.  Was kinda disappointed when it arrived.  The strings that tie around are not that long either which if you are not a medium size it will be a little more difficult to tie.  Would have sent back but didn’t have enough time to order something else for our event.
2.0,"The jars do not each have covers, which is what I needed. Perhaps good for organizing, but not for samples, which is why I bought them."
2.0,Comes from China. Sizes are way off the xlarge fits my ten year old.
2.0,Its smaller than its supposed to fit.
2.0,Too small and stitching let lose after already a month.
2.0,"The shoes fit as expected BUT I must say for these shoes to be breathable, they smelled terrible in less than 7 days. I didn't expect them to go a long period of time without gaining an odor but I definitely didn't think they would start to smell that fast. I was highly disappointed because I wanted these shoes to be &#34;daycare/play shoes&#34; but unfortunately I don't even want him to wear them anymore because the odor is so foul."
2.0,"It's a super cute headband, but it's small. It creates lumps in my hair because its so tight. I've had to fix it a few times because some of the links popping open when I try to put it on."
2.0,"Bought this watch for my son's birthday in January 2021. It didn't even make it to the summer due to the band breaking. He really loved the look and feel, so we were quite disappointed. The return period on Amazon is only 1 month, so we're going to have to pay for a new band."
2.0,"Product came in later than expected but it also fits smaller than own size. When I asked for a refund, help nor response ever came and all I wanted was to order a larger size"
2.0,Zippers stick.
2.0,the shorts are not as long as they appear in the picture. they are shorter and slide up easily
2.0,"If you put a phone in, you'll have to remove it... Every. Single. Time. You. Need. Coins...terrible design which is a shame because it's nice quality but totally useless"
2.0,Super cute and comfortable.... however as soon as I put them on I noticed a small tear. One squat later.. torn at the seam almost to me knee.<br />I requested a refund and returned the item.. this was probably a couple months ago and I have yet to hear back or receive a replacement. Overall very disappointed with my experience.
2.0,I have tried washing this 4 times and I can't get the smell out of it.
2.0,"This is a very pretty dress, but not made for short-waisted bodies.  There is not enough distance and therefore, there is a squashed waistline.  Had to send it back for fit issues."
2.0,It broke in about 5 seconds. Was going to give it as a gift but decided to try it out make sure it was a good quality? Literally broke as soon as I put it on. I'm sad because it is really cute!
2.0,"The size runs very small. I’m usually a medium, rarely large, but since I saw this tan small I ordered an XL. It is still too small for me. It’s tight !"
2.0,"Sending this one back. The fabric is quite thin and the color on the bottom is more of a blue-gray and much lighter than navy. The colors in person make the dress look very worn out. I would usually order a large, but based on reviews I bought a medium, and the medium fit just fine."
2.0,I'm 5' 2&#34; and 120 lbs. Material is too thin and tight for my size and liking.
2.0,"Sizing runs really small ....fit was bunchy in the hip area,not loose like a skirt and not flattering at all. Too bad because it looked really cute."
2.0,"It was different color, not bad, but not as good as on the picture"
2.0,"Looks good in the picture, but not in person. The two largest stones are not the same color as the rest. These same two stones do not sparkle, they are dull and lack-luster. For me, the earrings are too heavy.  Liked the color of the other beads."
2.0,"We ordered the right size, size 5/6 for my at the time 11-year-old daughter who is incredibly short and skinny and it still was way too tight and short it was a bother putting them on she never wore them"
2.0,The links are difficult to remove
2.0,So adorable but seriously the sizing is soooooo far off. Is this a juniors????
2.0,Thick. Bought them to fold and go in purse but they’re too thick
2.0,"Looks beautiful, but the plastic parts of the frame keeps breaking. Not strong enough to hold the weight."
2.0,"Nice looking shirt, but large was sized to small."
2.0,The color was just a pictured and fit just fine but once I started moving they would just sliding down which is extremely annoying.
2.0,Don’t like how it fits or material
2.0,"It was too much of a hassle to return, so now I have a dress that’s 10 sizes too big for me in my car! But the quality is nice for the price. I’ll definitely gift it to someone."
2.0,The glitter gets everywhere.
2.0,Wasnt what I thought because what I thought was a stone is a sticker. It also gets caught on a lot of things.
2.0,My husband ordered this coat - it was too tight across the shoulders and way too long in the sleeves - looked totally ridiculous. It is was sized normally it might be ok. Also the fabric was like a microfiber that EVERYTHING clung too... not a good thing...
2.0,It's definitely very aesthetically pleasing but it's very cheaply made if you're going to wear it take it off in the shower or in physical activity it's cute but it did not stand the test of time from the time I bought it it only lasted a month but very cute would not buy again!
2.0,"I really wanted to love these earrings, but they are just too big, too heavy and not very attractive. The fact that they are resin based also turned me off. For the price, they should not be resin. If the resin allows them to be bigger then they should forget it and just be silver and white gold. I don't recommend them. Very disappointing."
2.0,its not worth the price. its basically something you could get at a .99 cent store
2.0,"This fit right in my places, but the leggings were really long. I am not tall by any means, but I think even if you were 5’6 or so they would still be too long and I ordered a small. Also, the material is very see-through and thin."
2.0,I Wouldn't recommend buying this belt. The quality of finish on the buckle is weak. I mostly sit at a desk or am driving while wearing the belt and the buckle looks terrible after only 4 months. The wear started to show up almost right away. I tried covering it up with a permanent sharpie without success. Waste of money IMO.
2.0,Runs big and more like thin shiny material not sweatshirt like material
2.0,I normally don't write reviews but this &#34;navy blue&#34; was a completely different color than the photo.
2.0,"Out of the box, these were exactly what I was looking for.  Pockets, good elastic, good looking.  However after the first wash there were a few that started to come apart at the crotch.  So the seller replaced them, no problem.  Same issue with the next batch.  I've already tossed out 2 pair out of 5.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Maybe you just have to figure these are ""disposable"" gym shorts."
2.0,Why did I even think it wouldn't?
2.0,Es transparente muy grande para el tamaño
2.0,They don/t keep the water out.
2.0,"This jacket is warm, fuzzy, and cute, but all of the buttons came off in the first wash! And the clasp to keep the jacket closed fell off shortly after. It was not worth as much as the price."
2.0,Bought 3x which normally is very huge on me. I wanted them for around the house. These shirts fit my second son who wears a 10/12 in boys. Only thing is the arms are slightly too long for him. Don't bother unless you are tiny.
2.0,Sizes are not anywhere near the norm
2.0,Considering the price ....  maybe I should have given a better review .  It’s holding together !
2.0,It's ok but rides up my lady bits and I really dont like the material. Its feels like a Halloween costume I would buy my kids.
2.0,The material doesn’t stretch at all and there’s no slim shape to it.
2.0,"These shoes are adorable and seemed comfortable for my daughter but the first time she wore them the strap broke. It’s too bad, she really liked them. Hopefully it was just a random defect."
2.0,"The style is perfect, the stitching is poor, the hemming threads fell out after wearing the first time."
2.0,"I have a pretty slim body, I am around 5'6&#34; and 120 pounds. This dress looked like a frumpy mess on me and did not make my curves stand out at all! I had to return"
2.0,color looks cheap
2.0,Poorly made. Really really small on top and just so much fabric on the bottom
2.0,"They were nice while they lasted.<br /><br />But the sewing machine that was putting together the seams along the right edge of the right hand missed. It was basically held together by nothing more than friction (for a good while, too).<br /><br />The first time I put any pressure into donning these gloves, it just splayed right open, revealing the missed seam."
2.0,My earrings aren’t the same shape. They don’t all have matching pairs.
2.0,This under shirt is short like for petites.
2.0,This thing smells horrible when it arrives
2.0,I ordered both  a large and xl...the waist was small on. Both.  I normally wear a large.  I returned both.
2.0,LOOK OK
2.0,"Is it a costume or a model? It is not just wings but has a butterfly body - not very large but it makes it weird when your child has the wings on. What is your child meant to be, a butterfly or some kind of weird appendage on a butterfly's body?"
2.0,"Shoe people that don't have 1/2 sizes, should not suggest that you order the next larger size,"
2.0,"Cap won't stay on my head or keep my ears covered.  I'm done buying knitted ski caps like this, because if they can't stay on your head, they're useless."
2.0,Poor quality. The string part of the earring was bent when I got time and the fold never came out.
2.0,"The dress was way too small and the sunflowers are very orange, not yellow"
2.0,Gave this item to my girlfriend and it always breaks over and over again and has to be taken to a jewelry store to get fixed constantly. It looks nice but durability matters. I am very sorry but have to rate 2 Stars.
2.0,The Mustang seperated from the ring in one week. Not well made.
2.0,Too shin
2.0,"Ok, they fill up with water quickly though and do not drain very well. Also I thought this was a car it is a bunny ... as my very particular 5 year old pointed out"
2.0,The hair silver cutting beard bib is too small for a grown man. The black cape is fine. I would not buy again.<br />I would not purchase again.
2.0,"I should have listened to the review that said if you are voluptuous this isn't for you... I think of myself as curvy- in the right places. No way in this dress! Can't can't cover the girls... the hole under the arm at waist is way, way to big and the material is like a leotard but doesn't stay put.<br /> The color is lovely and if I were a 2,4, or a 6 still, I would probably love it. No lining, too thin to wear a slip...spanks showed, too. i really wanted it to work!"
2.0,None of these fit my nose hole .. its like they are too big in size. I was so excited about them too.
2.0,The label on the packaging says “97% Polyester 3% Spandex” - zero cotton. If you like plastic socks….you’ll love these.
2.0,"The item was very small for a &#34;large&#34;. I could not give it as the gift intended and due to time went to a local sports store and bought a large which fit perfectly. I did not send the item back as it had some damage which I wasn't sure if it was done by me or it arrived that way. We'll just keep it and give it to another grandchild as he grows. Quality was fine, but the sizing was done by your chart and was way off."
2.0,"Cheap, hot fabric.  This was a mistake buy!"
2.0,"If you are like me, you were browsing for barbering/hair assessories and you accidentally tripped over this item like “ooooh what’s this”. I will urge you now, if your expectations are high, lower them to save your self from the emotional power trip. If your expectations are low already, just save yourself the money and frustration and keep on browsing. You are just like me: looking for a convenient way to avoid messy barbering and cleaning. Well, this isn’t it.<br /><br />Firstly, the material is very meager. Folding and storage is not intuitive. The attempt in manufacturing is admirable but not impressive. If you aren’t too strict on that, note that the design doesn’t reliably “umbrella” to catch the hair; at least not all the time. The straps that connect to the next that would fulfill the “umbrella” function should be adjustable to ensure this; otherwise, it looks more like a “plate”.<br /><br />Here’s the part where you and I neglect: if and after you’ve managed to cut the hair and it all lands perfectly in the “umbrella”, how do you get it out and into the trash can without making too much of a mess? That there is the mystery, for there are no instructions. This debacle all rests on your creativity. The hair doesn’t simply slide off the material and into the trash, considering that hair texture is not universal. Some may be greased and oily and others dry. Nonetheless, it’s not coming out of the umbrella without a fight! Conclusively, if you were to conduct an experiment where you cut and clean-up using the old cape and allowing the clippings to hit the floor (using a vacuum or broom) vs. “the new way”, you will not see a significant improvement in convenience in the latter. I used a vacuum to clean the item (because dumping in the trash was not so simple due to the product’s design) and I felt that the old-fashioned cape and floor caused me less grief.<br /><br />The product concept is attractive for its novelty, but the design is impractical compared to the traditional approach. In closing, just use the old barbering cape; let the hair fall to the floor...and use a vacuum."
2.0,Cute stuff but SUPER SMALL. My daughter wears a 100% medium and she could've worn an XL.
2.0,Looks like a jailbird sack. Not at all what I was expecting
2.0,Fit really weird on me. Wasn't flattering at all. Would never wear.
2.0,They are cute but not a great quality. one set broke when I was removing them and the other is already tarnished.
2.0,The top part of the glasses is blurry like it is prescription and the reader part is not as strong as it should be.  We ordered a 2.5 and it is more like a 2.  Would not order again.  Hard to order products like this without trying them on first.
2.0,Supposed to fit loose but it HUGE.
2.0,The color of the hat I ordered was different than the advertised picture. It was suppose to be &#34;olive green&#34; which is the reason I ordered.  I received a chocolate brown hat.
2.0,"I ordered a large and the tag in the tank top is large, but it is a small, and the fabric is very thin and it is cut very low in the front.  When I look at the picture this tank looks like it will come to the hips, it fits just below the belly.  I am 5' 1&#34; and petite and brought this tank to exercise in, but it would be uncomfortable, as I prefer loose tops either large or x-large tanks to cover my bottom and hips.<br />I have gotten better cotton fabric and patriotic tanks from Walmart than this seller.  It's cheap, don't waste your money.  The seller has refunded my money and I will return their item to them."
2.0,It’s cute but SUPER short
2.0,Compressing is minimal
2.0,ACTUALLY I DID NOT TRY THIS THING ON AT ALL.I took one look at it and picked it up and looked at the construction of the hat and the materail and sent it back right away.
2.0,Arena are way to short for this sweater. Photo appears to be a speckles like yarn & product is just one color plain. Cheap quality.
2.0,Said it was a 2xl but my 9 yr old daughter wears it more like a size 12.
2.0,"It was cute, but poor material It is the correct size but the material fit loose and baggy on my daughter so it did not look right. She will not be able to wear this."
2.0,"I got the kids Cortez because I like that the foam around the sole is mostly black, whereas the adults' is mostly white. I just like the mostly black look better.<br /><br />The size I got fit perfectly, and I love the design of the shoe, but I am not happy with the shoe's construction. Very shortly after I began wearing it, the sole began to flake off, which is not great but not a deal breaker for me. However not long after that, the nylon part began separating from the sole exposing glue all along the sides. Not a cute look. It looks really cheap and shoddy, not what I would expect from Nike, youth size or not."
2.0,I ordered up like the site said to and it was still way too small
2.0,It's very pretty but I wore it two times and the chain broke
2.0,There was no volume to the tutu. It arrived very flat and looked nothing like the photo. The bow has cardboard under it. Very disappointed
2.0,Being returned.  Much smaller than expected.
2.0,Looks good on photos/pictures. But once we received it wasn't happy with the product
2.0,The tab used to open and close the laces was almost impossible to operate. Unusable. Had to return.
2.0,These moto pants look awesome and are made to be cool (temp) but they offer 0 protection on the knees and a tiny bit on the hips and basically nowhere else - not what I expected.
2.0,"I am 5'4"". 150 lbs.  Not heavy in the arms.  I am true large on tops and size 8. Ordering a large was way too tight in the arms and mid section and bust. Extra large would probably take care of bust but would still worry about the arms"
2.0,"Shipped on time, but item seemed poorly made. We got this one specifically because of the molded pieces, but it was so cheaply made that they were falling apart in no time. If this had only been 20 dollars or so, no big deal, but for 50 dollars, it felt like a total waste of money."
2.0,"Cute design, but only for people who have a more straight shape. Too small in the chest and butt, too big in the tummy and calves. NO stretch, and mediocre fabric quality. Not worth the price, but I needed something fast and had to wear it."
2.0,"I really liked it, but it from apart after three days"
2.0,Very disappointed with fabric and color
2.0,I bought 2 beanies and in both the stitching is coming undone on the liner the top ripped because it doesn’t stretch very well.
2.0,"This photo looked fine on Amazon.  The actual product is small and would be fine a child or preteen. The product is too childish for my taste.  I sent this product back. At the time the product was $2.99 US currency, now it is up to $6.49.  Don't bother returning this product if you dislike it as you will be paying the shipping. It was too late for me as the return was already in processing and I paid more for shipping it back than what the actual item cost.  I paid about a 1 dollar more. Never again."
2.0,Very thin and fragile for the price.
2.0,I didn't think that the soles would be so stiff.
2.0,"buy the fleece leggings, these are supposed to be the same thing but were incredibly tiny in comparison to the same stores fleece version. I bought two pairs of each. the fleece ones are great except the hip area where you can see the seam meet and its somewhat see through there. i would buy the fleece version again."
2.0,"Wrong color, the picture of the color was much darker than is actually was I returned it"
2.0,THEY ARE OK
2.0,The white was see through. Looked cheap and flimsy.
2.0,This mask is HUGE!!! It covered my entire face so I sent it back. The graphic is adorable but there was no way I could wear it.
2.0,I bought 2 tubes but one of them only lasted 1 hour down the river.  The tube ripped where the clip connection is and my friend ended up soaked.
2.0,"Didn’t like them, didn’t fit and worked the same as regular sunglasses."
2.0,I think I am going to return this bathing suit. I have not worn it other than to try it on.
2.0,Received defective product
2.0,runs like 2 sizes smaller.
2.0,Was longer in front then the back size ran small.
2.0,We ended up returning these because they were too small and too tight even though we ordered the same size as all the other shoes she wears. Overall not impressed by this shoe.
2.0,The bracelet was really chunky. And it broke the day I wore it. I was really excited for this bracelet...
2.0,"They're falling apart so fast, not worth $40 they fell apart like $10 shoes. My daughter is saddened by this! I'm annoyed."
2.0,Size was huge
2.0,The ankle cut is really open.  If it’s a look your going for then it’s fine but I didn’t care for it.
2.0,"It’s misleading how it looks in the pics and when you get it. The spikes are a completely different color than the bar. You can see the threads through them. The fit is okay. Overall, I wouldn’t have bought if the pictures were accurate."
2.0,It was cheap material like polyester.
2.0,I love the design in the shirt but the collar is flimsy and just hangs. Not a fan but too lazy to return.
2.0,It looks pretty on but it will bring u to tears if someone hits ur nose or u take it out
2.0,I liked the cut and feel of this blouse however the sleeves we're too tight and it appeared to run a little small. I ended up returning this item.
2.0,"They slip like crazy....not sure where I can safely wear them...also, the feel of them is very un-noticeable."
2.0,"I would have liked these to be a little longer. In bare feet they were more than an inch from the floor (I am 5'6"").<br />If I had kept them, I would wear an under layer for two reasons: (1) they are transparent (2) they are really itchy!"
2.0,Too large and a bit too thick for a dressy shirt.
2.0,"The hat arrived and didn't really look much like the picture. The brim of the hat was larger in person and the bow was extremely cheap and creased beyond fixing. The packaging crushed the hat and I never could get it formed back right. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this."
2.0,I both the Medium but it was way to big .
2.0,To small I can’t use it
2.0,"Pretty, but much smaller than I expected and needed. The disc is about the size of a dime."
2.0,Para mi regular aveces se retrasa
2.0,"The thread that holds the sole to the top was separated before I even opened them up, so didn't even try them on. I think the quality is poor.. cheap !!!"
2.0,"The dress is nice, But my daughter did not like how it fit, I tried to return it and submitted my request, went to the ups office and they wanted me charge me more than what the dress was worth to return. I want my money back n I want to send this dress back to the seller.😞"
2.0,"I ordered the green in this dress and it did not look like the picture at all. The ruffle was short and ill fitted it did not fall on the shoulder even though I kept pulling it there it kept going on the top of my shoulder and just resting there, the fabric of the dress was thin and felt flimsy.. I was really upset because I bought it to wear to my coworkers wedding and couldn't. It's basically sitting at the back of the closet."
2.0,Use the sizing chart but was way too small. Go up a size when ordering. The material was also very odd and seemed like it would stick to you in the heat. It is a pretty color but I will have to return.
2.0,The picture makes it look like it's gold not silver. Looks like it should cost 2$
2.0,"The material and quality seem amazing.  It has a nice weight and thickness to it.  However, where it falls short is the fit around the waist.  The exposed button side would stay flat against the waistline, giving a cropped look.  But the hidden button side is loose/shapeless, and would drape.  This creates an awkward asymmetrical look.  Adjusting the buttons to the tighter settings did not help, as it closes up the V neckline and made it looked even more awkward.  I typically wear medium, and that's the size I ordered.  I would recommend to size down to see if the fit is better.  Unfortunately I had to return it and didn't bother to exchange due to the fit being a bit strange."
2.0,"These boots look nice and they seem like they should be warm.<br /><br />However, I was disappointed in the quality and warmth. I have only worn them a couple of times and they leak. They also are not insulated and can not be worn in temperatures below 40 degrees.<br /><br />I am very disappointed in these boots and will not be ordering again."
2.0,I bought this watch.  And loved everything about it especially the heart monitor.  Gps and maps...but less than 1 year it stopped functing.  Casino replace the watch but not with the same one. Similar look and function but does not have all the futures..  either there was some serious patent violation or design flaws.  Because 21hr has been erased from surface of the earth.
2.0,I gave it to my daughter-in-law! I did like the color. I didn't want to mess with exchanging it.
2.0,They were not leggings as described there straight leg elastic waist pants
2.0,"Clasp wouldn't close, returning for refund"
2.0,already turning color
2.0,"I'm not mad at this tie. I mean, it was only $8 or so. But it's so cheap, I can't even wear it. So what you're really doing is buying something that you can't really wear. I suppose, though, if you have a 5 foot Ken doll, it would make a good tie for him:<br /><br />• I'm 6 feet tall and it wasn't long enough for me. I'm not a fat guy, so I expected to be able to wear it. It only went down to my belly button.<br /><br />• The music was funny, but once the battery started dying, it was even MORE annoying.<br /><br />Final verdict: It is a great piece of junk. By 'great' I mean it's very good at being pretty much completely worthless. How come I didn't give it one star? Because it's obviously a piece of junk."
2.0,Material way too thin!
2.0,"Changing my review to 2 stars. I’ve had this wallet less than 6 months and already the stitching that goes between the card slots is coming apart, so my cards no longer stay in place. Very disappointed in the quality of this wallet"
2.0,There are a LOT less stones on the actual earring...photo is a false representation.
2.0,This is not a real waart hat I wore it to work and was made to take it off
2.0,I wish this would have fit better because it's so cute. You definitely need to wear a tank underneath since the sleeves are so big.
2.0,"The only problem was the chest area.  It has a built in bra type thing, I didn't know that.  At my age (59), my bust isn't that high anymore.  I tried hoisting up my bust up that high and it was uncomfortable and I came out of place as soon as I moved my arms. so going dancing in the dress wouldn't work.  Otherwise, it was very pretty, excellent construciton, very well made.  It's probably better suited to a younger person or a larger bust person.  I really wish it had fit me better.  I will definitely try a dress without the built in bra feature.  Thanks for making these dresses."
2.0,Not to size but cute and I have to another child who loved it. Walmart grade but fun for July 4th.
2.0,You get what you pay for.  😁. Not wearable.  Except maybe for a costume.  Too big.  Bad material.  Bad waist/elastic.
2.0,Slightly bigger than expected
2.0,"I thought this was going to be a average smaller purse but its not its small, its tiny. It's the size of a 5 year olds play purse."
2.0,Kind of look old fashioned
2.0,The pearls were too big and heavy for a child! The bracelet is almost adult-sized. I'm totally disappointed :(
2.0,"Gorgeous & bright colors, but the slits do not stay over my ears. I just have to just not use them."
2.0,DOOD QUALITY POOR SIZING
2.0,Cute for the gym but not for high impact I’m a 34b
2.0,Thin. Looks and feels like pajama pants
2.0,"I didn't expect much at the price, but was surprised that there was no hat band inside, but the bill is formed by a plastic piece that contacts the forehead. In to the trash."
2.0,Fits to big not happy
2.0,They run large. My daughter cannot wear them for at least another few months.
2.0,Where the metal connector is it’s attached by plastic which broke within a month.
2.0,The size was ONLY good for being pinned to a baseball cap...NOT a jacket label size as the picture showed..disappointment for it's use
2.0,"Soo cute in the pictures, but what is seen here is not what showed up to my doorstep. Some of the other reviewers have quality skirts, so I don't want to speak on all of them, but what I recieved was sheer and cheaply made. If you're a betting gal I'd give it a shot because it could be really cute."
2.0,"The product is cute however, it clearly states there is a quantity of 18 on this listing. I only received 12. The packaging says it has 20 pieces (which it clearly didn’t). I was expecting to receive 18 pieces and I’m disappointed I only received 12."
2.0,"Very cute dress but once I washed it shrunk super small, looks like a tank top now."
2.0,These were ok ... not long enough for me ... sent back
2.0,I thought the lenses were glass and they were plastic with a default scratch in the lense.
2.0,Not dark enough and the lens already fell out
2.0,"I wanted this dress so bad and unfortunately the dress is too small. I suggest to go a size or two up, especially if you’re plus size."
2.0,Arrived broken but I fixed it!
2.0,"The shirt is adorable, but the weight and thickness of the appliqué makes it heavy & uncomfortable. I personally would need a tank under it so it doesn’t brush against me. Disappointed"
2.0,I purchased the item for Dress up day at work (luau theme). It was very thin and cheaply made.
2.0,they have a seam up the back of the brief (didn;t show and didn't like)
2.0,"Item was misshapen, and had gaps in the sewing of the bust area that left you CLEARLY exposed, with no way to adjust anything to cover appropriately. I would have had to sew the dress closed in several areas to even make it decently wearable."
2.0,"As you would expect this is not a high quality item, but all I wanted it for was Halloween. I waited about a month and it finally arrived in a very small package. Of course it was folded very compact and was a little stinky but I tried it on... or tried to try it on. Even though I ordered up 2 sizes it wouldn't go over my chest 38D. Boo, now I need to decide to return it or cut the back open, (it's only for Halloween)."
2.0,The fabric is very see through. Very wide and not even long enough to wrap around my head twice
2.0,A waste of money.  Just pieces of cloth sewed together. Does not fit a bed ridden  person.
2.0,I got the necklace & the earrings but no bracelet?
2.0,This product is too small.  As another person wrote you cant put papers in that top pocket.  Or in my case my ipad is the larger 12.9 inch version and it wont fit.  The lower rating has to do with the page and how that isnt listed anywhere in THEIR description.  Though you can find it in the Q & A eventually had i seen that sooner i wouldnt have purchased the product.
2.0,"4 year old doesn’t like to wear it, “to scratchy!!!”"
2.0,Was disappointed its not white.  Its mire of a cream or off white.
2.0,I think this outfit is super cute but the sizing is all off. I ordered for 6 months and it's so big it can fit an 18 month old.
2.0,"These are nice socks, but they shrank a lot when washed even though I used only warm water and warm dryer.  Even before washing the size 6 to 9 1/2 socks were tight on my size 8 foot.  I've had cotton socks that have remained close to the same original size after several years of wear and washings."
2.0,"After 1 regular day, and 1 short day at Disney, the cork at the top came off. Luckily this happened when my girlfriend went to sit on the couch so it didn't hit the floor. I put some super glue to hold the cork to the bottle, but another 2 days passed and the chain broke. Probably be a good idea to buy a good quality custom chain and super glue the cork to the bottle."
2.0,"I usually wear a size small and when I pulled this out of the package, I instantly thought that maybe I had ordered a children's shirt. Lo and behold, it says women's... I don't know what kind of pint-sized women live wherever they produce this shirt, but I can tell you, I'll probably be giving it away to one of my nieces. They are 10."
2.0,The quality and I was unable to get it in a 3X
2.0,Material way to thin… could see every bump or bulge….
2.0,"I have lots of moissonite and these are not up to par..they look cloudy and like cheap cubic zirconia,"
2.0,Child sized sunglasses!
2.0,It’s a bang for the buck but durags too small
2.0,It's a pretty watch but arrived not working and now it's too late to return.
2.0,"I like the style and color, but it was really big. I order size large and it is fit like plus size"
2.0,"Dec 2017 UPDATE.  After a few months, both sides turned a very dark grey. Tried silver polish, which cleaned it up for about a week,then very dark, flat grey. Wrote seller, advised to cover it with clear nail polish. This just made it look nasty. Tossed it. Dec. 2016: Like the size. Like the style, the heft, thickness....but after three months, the side that is closest to skin is tarnishing, turning a very dark pewter color. Not sure what to do about this"
2.0,"I realize the cut and style of these pants is meant to be loose and flowing. Which is why I bought them in the first place. I ordered these specifically for wearing home from the hospital after hip surgery but they were so oversized and awful that I couldn’t bring myself to wear them in public for even that short amount of time. I ordered these in a medium which according to the sizing chart should have been just fine. Somehow clothing on models in advertising pictures always looks better than when I’m wearing them. Go figure LOL!<br />But I already know this and have for quite some time. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to return them (my fault) because I had washed, ironed (they require lots of ironing!) and packed them away for my hospital stay and ran out of calendar days before realizing they weren’t for me."
2.0,Love the crown. But the sash was supposed to be the same color as crown; which was purple and a sash is slipped over head and an arm. This sash is open. I can’t use it like this. Very disappointed
2.0,I liked that it was pretty to look at but poor in quality. I have a Montana watch I bought 10 years ago and it's high quality. This is thin and flimsy.  Sent it back.
2.0,"If they were made as footies, it would work better for me. They are too tight at the top & cut off my circulation. I roll them down to ankle level in order to wear them."
2.0,"I am bummed about this purchase. The jumpsuit fits great and is super comfortable. However, when I took it off after wearing it for the first time (unwashed), I was covered in black dye. Fortunately it washed off of me in the shower, but unfortunately it also ruined my undergarments. I am hoping that after running it in the laundry it will not bleed dye any longer as I really do like this outfit."
2.0,Way too small about 3 sizes.
2.0,"Love this sweater, the color, the fit, and the way it hangs. Looks exactly as pictured. BUT, I had to update my review because I was only able to wear it twice before a hole appeared in the back of the sweater. I had washed and hung it up to dry and only put it in the dryer on low to ""fluff"" it before wearing and after this last wash, I noticed there was already a run in the back. I loved the look of it but I would not buy again."
2.0,"There is a lot of variety to be sure...<br /><br />But out of the 110 pieces there were only 37, 14 gauges.<br /><br />And out of that 37 I can only use 18 of them as the spike things are obnoxious and I don't have my belly button pierced.<br /><br />I have my nipples and ears done. Both are 14g.<br />I only wear on ball on the front of my ears. As for the nipple having variation is pretty fun.<br /><br />Just be aware 14 gauge people, that there is this risk."
2.0,"The sizing chart is weird. I ordered a xl thinking I needed it to fit for the jacket length (I normally wear a 42 R in jackets), but the pants and too big in the waist and the vest was over sized. Need a set that actually matches in size.<br /><br />The quality is nice however.<br />I returned and am trying a different size.<br /><br />(2) stars be cause of the quality"
2.0,"The xxl would barely cover my boobs. These run very small. I also cannot tie it as shown on the model. I bought the peach kimono. It’s pretty, sheer, and would be lovely if it fit. Idk why someone below said it’s heavy. It’s not."
2.0,"Super pretty but definitely not stainless steel. I bought these for after my septum piercing healed and I missed the window to return them which is disappointing because I’m allergic to nickel, which these clearly have. I wore each for less then 10 hours and finally the discomfort in my nose made me look to see my nose had green on it and was slightly swollen. The metal is clearly super cheap as it discolored in a few hours. If you don’t have a sensitivity then these are probably fine but if you do, like me, steer clear! (Also it came with all 4, I just didn’t bother to wear them or put them in the photos)."
2.0,Great dress!! Fit perfectly but I have to return it because smells like pee!!! I washed 3 times and not luck. I will order it again;)
2.0,Disappointed that it’s so small for a medium
2.0,"Design and built: Stylish and looks nice. Does not look cheap. Good things ends here.<br />Performance: Bad. Just bad. Too much reflection from inner surface of the lenses, especially when you are facing sun. It is so bad that it almost looks like foggy. Not clear at all. Also not for active movement of course because it will not stay on your glasses. It is a clip-on after all.<br /><br />Summary: you get what you pay for."
2.0,I bought a second pair of these clip on shades because I really like that they dont flip up/ have a big hinge above the bridge.  The second pair was clearly previously returned as they were not packaged the same.  I paid full price for both.  There is a discount to purchase returned sunglasses  which i did not get
2.0,This was not the correct sizing
2.0,Strange fabric. Runs SUPER small.
2.0,Thin Material
2.0,Fit is loose. Material sheds and has an odor.
2.0,This product was shown as a hot pink pant legging and when it arrived was much more of a purple cropped legging. It also does not have as much detail as what’s shown in the image. You get what you pay for.
2.0,This is advertised as 50 inch chest it isn't even close.  The quality isn't bad but it certainly runs tiny!!!  The model in the picture has to be stickman!!
2.0,"The pictures make this watch look flexible and like it will rest on your wrist.  The pleather is crazy stiff, so stiff it's hard to snap it, and then it sits awkwardly on your wrist and is down right uncomfortable."
2.0,"Did not realize there was an elastic at hem, had not worn yet. May have it taken out"
2.0,Much two hard to put on for me could only get them just about to the ankle and then no further. I have larger thighs and legs and when ordering these we took that into concideration . I would not tell anyone to buy them.
2.0,To small for adult face and moves when talking
2.0,"It’s very cute, but it loosens as you move throughout the day, and it pulls the little hairs on your wrist, which is uncomfortable. I used it for a couple days and then went back to my old band."
2.0,"I was looking for a longer tank, said yoga tank, but this barley covers abdomen.  Not a long tank if that’s what you’re after"
2.0,the dress not what i expected
2.0,"I’m 5’8 and when I tell you my whole ass is out, I for sure can’t wear this out. It’s a cute dress if you’re shorter also it’s a thick velvet material. If it was longer I’d keep it."
2.0,They're cute but VERY small. It would help if they had extenders. Better for little girls rather than women.
2.0,"So these are much smaller than I had anticipated, more suitable for a a smaller adult or child. They seem to be good build quality but they are not what I hoped for :/<br /><br />I can't even return them since they were $5 it's not worth the cost to ship back so I guess I will give them away."
2.0,"Picture makes it look like a trim fit but it's not, it's an american fit.  It is tight in sleeves and huge around the waist.  If you have a big belly and want to show off your arms this is the shirt for you.  Quality is great.  I may have it tailored because aside from the cut I like the shirt."
2.0,The bracelet broke as soon as my daughter tried to put it on
2.0,Cheap Quality.
2.0,The box is nice. The pearls were a lot smaller than expected and look more blue than black. I got this as a gift for my wife. Hope she likes it. I'm not a fan at all...
2.0,Sandal is to small at ball of foot
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:af808fcceb938e08a7e9441fb1ed86f7]] I normally wear a size L but for this vest I had to order XXL. Big difference.<br />I bought this vest in black, in October 2018 for my trip to Europe in November.  I was totally happy with it but in the middle of my trip I noticed the white stuffing started appearing.  I could pull some of it out but others got to be too long and wouldn't stop coming out.  It popped out throughout the vest and the hood was the worse.  I loved, and still wear it because the length is perfect and its so comfortable.  I want another one in black and maybe Tangerine could come through.  I'm searching for one.  Could you send them this review please."
2.0,"One can appreciate all the technology and all the advertised features this watch can do. However, I would think that the elderly or older aged folks just might have issues following along with all the feature options and sequencing processes of pushing correct buttons to get this watch to do the things it is meant to do. My personal issue besides the cheap plastic makings of the outside of the watch (the watch description does say plastic watch casing) is this watch just did not work from the get-go.<br /><br />The watch is chunky in looks and the plastic build makes for a very strange and light feeling watch when wearing. I do not like the requirements to always keep the watch near my phone for proper synchronizing. I also do not like the idea of placing the watch upside down close to a window to enable the watch to do certain required things per instructions.<br /><br />I followed the directions as provided, I watched the video that also goes into detail for waking and setting the watch. I deleted the app then reinstalled the app three separate times but still had no success in getting this watch to wake up.<br /><br />After a couple of hours of trying to get the watch to work I gave up after I attempted to replace the battery (which the app indicates battery was dead) only to find the screws on the back of the watch are so tiny I would need to take this watch to a jeweler who has the proper tools to gain access the battery to test and/or replace.<br /><br />I am confident that the watch does work under perfect conditions! However, from my experience the watch does not work so I will not be recommending this watch.<br /><br />I have no desires to take any more additional time or resources to try and make this watch wake up and work as advertised. This review is solely my opinion based on my experience. Others may find effective use of and be happy with this watch and I respect their findings as well."
2.0,"These arrived with no print on them.  I kept them because I still need the tank tops, and I didn't think it was worth the hassle of returning them.  Also, the picture makes them look pretty baggy and flowy, but they're pretty form fitting."
2.0,"Although it does state in the description that these are ‘triplets’, make sure you understand what that means.<br />The picture show real whole fire opals. These are NOT solid opals."
2.0,Very cheap materials and very cheaply made= in my opinion cheap jewelry. I'm not happy with them at all and wont be wearing them.
2.0,The dress was for my daughter. It arrived on time and was very cute in person as well. It was way too small however - be aware the sizes are not American sizes
2.0,"Beautiful design, but the spring is so hard and tight. Can't be used one handed to clasp which is weird."
2.0,"I wanted to like these pants SO bad, and admittedly, there are things about them that I love. They’re very comfortable, I like the colour, and I feel like they’re flattering to my stomach. However, the back of the pants are not at all forgiving. They show every single bump, lump, and line. The bodysuits I would wear with it? No go. Underwear (even no show)? No go. Can’t even tuck a tank top in or wear a thong without lines showing. And even if I wore it with a crop top (which I wouldn’t, since these were supposed to be for work) and went commando, they still show every lump, bump, and cellulite - and they aren’t even tight fitting. Also, unless you naturally have a booty, don’t expect these to flatter your backside. I don’t have much of a bum, but these pants make it look practically non-existent. I’m really bummed because I thought these pants would be a win for sure, but I stead were a major let down. I’m considering trying them in a darker colour to see if those would work better for hiding lines and lumps, but we’ll see.<br /><br />As far as size, I’m 40-33.5-39, 168 lbs and ordered the Large, which was a great fit."
2.0,it was in a small box all crutch up. i had to use iron to straighen it out not like picture i would not buy again
2.0,"Looks & feels cheap. It’s immediately apparent that this shirt is cheaply made. Idk what I expected, but something about the shirt just screams Walmart."
2.0,I received mine yesterday after waiting almost a month. The ring is very beautiful but has already started changing colors & turned my finger green.
2.0,"The lenses on these glasses are perfectly flat and are not comfortable when worn; Quality of the glasses is fine - mirrored sunglasses; my biggest concern when ordering was the sturdiness of the construction, and these glasses feel as though they will not stand up to daily use without breaking.<br /><br />Given the &#34;flat&#34; lens and lack of sturdiness, I've placed these in the glovebox in my car for those opportunities when I need sunglasses when driving and have nothing to wear - after the drive, they will go back into the glovebox until I forget the first and second string glasses that I try to keep with me all of the time."
2.0,item was too small. Could not get all my hair into cap as stated to consider for buying.
2.0,Belt is okay but the ratchet doesn’t stay in position
2.0,"screws were loose and didn’t fit the frame. Then a screw comes out, I put it back in, then the frame cracked. This happened again, but on the other side of the frames.<br /><br />I get lots of compliments but the fame itself is too flimsy"
2.0,"If you have a shorter torso and are busty, this is a great suit.  I am 5'5 and 120lbs 34C.  My measurements were in line with a size small.  The cups in this suit (size Small) are huge (at least a DD).  I do not have a long torso and the straps were digging into my shoulders.  The patterning on this suit is all wrong. On the upside, for the price it is well made. The suit has a good amount of covereage and doesn’t feel like it will loose its shape."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:1590b52749bf88d81fff279180d1677a]] Makes chest go up to the neckline, not a sexy or appealing look. 🤷🏽‍♀️<br />Good fit on back and straps are great, but it doesn’t make the chest look good."
2.0,Frames too wide.
2.0,this what not what i expected. the fabric was a bit cheap and the top didnt even fit at all. if purchased might have to get a size larger then normal size.
2.0,Don’t like it and disappointed with the purchase.
2.0,cheap  made not flattering
2.0,"I ordered 7 dresses for a dance for several girls, none of them are marked sizes!! It is chaotic and they don't all seem to cut slightly different and have gaps on top/sides.  No extra material to open up and not easily tailored. I got them because they would come sooner than other brand and paid extra shipping! Now I am looking at sending them all back and getting elsewhere. Sad because they really do like nice."
2.0,"I bought this leotard in a size 2-4 for my 2.5 year old. She is an average size for her age and while this item fit her, it did not leave much room to grow. The skirt could be wrapped around two and a half times and still was slidding off of her. However my concern wasn't with the size as much as it was with the condition of the items. The leotard has dirt on the front and the back and the skirt has a hole in it. I will be returning this item and purchasing elsewhere. I'm bummed because this is a super cute leotard/skirt and my daughter loves it."
2.0,"I have several dresses like this one, but the cut and fit just isn't right. Runs very big."
2.0,the pattern and color were nice but these were as big and loose like boots.  more of a slipper sock than a sock that I could get inside my Uggs.  I had to send them back
2.0,Kinda shiny.
2.0,"Tear in the neckline. Shoulders not aligned. It’s very soft material, but it’s not high quality"
2.0,"These socks are too small. They are warm, but aren't made well and I don't expect them to last long. Overall, I'm disappointed."
2.0,Did not lay like in the picture - what a bummer.  Was loving this suit from the pics!
2.0,Pop socket works good but the bracelet fell apart easily
2.0,Very long. I had to cut mine in half. If I folded it in half it was too tight but if I left it long it bunched up on my neck and bothered me.
2.0,"The outfit is nice, but the zipper snapped in half the first time I put it in her. It is no longer working. I’m pretty disappointed."
2.0,"This dress fit too tight in the arms and top, but was too long at the same time. Also the color is off from the pic. I am returning."
2.0,have used these for awhile now and the new one's are small.. my last pair of size large were a bit loose so I ordered a medium and a large. the medium I can barely get on and the large is tight
2.0,"Doesn't look like the picture at all, was disappointed. The one shown is so nice."
2.0,"I;'m trying to return them,"
2.0,It's pretty dress but made cheap and ran  small in the bust and arms
2.0,"You get what you pay for.  This is a perfect dress for around the house, sleepwear.  Very thin material, not meant for outdoors wear."
2.0,"Patched on shorts not sewn down,  disappointing"
2.0,Glasses were quite a bit larger and wider than other brands  purchased. As a result they were returned.
2.0,This Item does not have the same quality as shown in the picture. The paint sophistication on this Egyptian scarab beetle pendant is not even close to the one shown. To spend almost 50 dollars with shipping I was very disappointed.
2.0,"This item is very uncomfortable, this could be because I dont have enough breast to fill it out though."
2.0,"They looked cute when I put them on but within a couple hours, my fingers were completely green and the color started to come off. I was really annoyed with that mostly because I did like them when they arrived. I had to throw them away after the first use."
2.0,I'VE HAD THIS BAG FOR 2 1/2 MONTHS AND THE BAG IS COMING APART. THE ZIPPER ON THE BACK CAME OFF. THERE IS A WHOLE IN MOST OF THE POCKETS.
2.0,"The band with the fringe along the top IS NOT stretchy like a typical sock. In fact the whole sock is flexible and stretched just like a knitted product and most socks. But the top band does not. These were not going to work out for me. For the record my calf measures 14 inches at its widest. I feel like even if you have a calf smaller than me, if you pulled it over, the fabric could cut off circulation. The white sock is not white in real life. It’s an ivory color."
2.0,"Does not look like the picture, the cut sleeves hang way to much!"
2.0,String fell off one
2.0,"The attachment on the long strap broke one one side. Sure I do carry a fair amount of items, but nothing that I thought was too heavy.<br />Otherwise, the color was nice and I licked that the bag had more structure to it."
2.0,"I loved the jacket, but it was too small in the shoulders and arms; didn't expect arms, thought it was a cape from the picture.<br />Didn't like the wide/out slits, made it look &#34;weird&#34;. Anyway, I am returning it. thanks."
2.0,"I ordered this in 2XL and it is definitely a Large. HOOOOOOOOOWWWW, did you come up with a 2XL. I am so upset because they are cute. UGH, what a waste of money. Now I have to go through the hassle of sending this stuff back."
2.0,NOT for small chested ladies!  If you lean forward the suit comes away from your chest and everyone can see inside the suit from the side.  There is no way to adjust the tightness across the chest.  So sad because the rest of the suit fit great and it’s super adorable!
2.0,"Horrible shirt. Received it yesterday, wore it today and the stitches are already coming off!!!! MUST RETURN IT!!<br /><br />DISAPPOINTED 😞😞😞😞😞"
2.0,"It’s a cute dress but it’s sizing runssmall. Also, it is cheaply made."
2.0,Runs way to small also the material is see through
2.0,It looks like the antique one I had.  But this is thin metal and had a large crack in the base of the metal hourglass case.
2.0,"Loose peasant styles were all the thing when I was coming of age, and even I think this is too loose.  The ""blue"" has no hint of blue that I can tell, it's really quite definitively black.  The material is also very thin.<br /><br />If my review was helpful, please click the button below."
2.0,I used the size guide from Sportoli  should have used the one guide from Amazon.  Turned out to be 2 sizes to small.
2.0,"The day we received the shoe, one of the lights didn't work.  It remained red.  Also, remote had to be so close to the show, you may as well have used the button in the shoe"
2.0,I love the look of this hat. HOWEVER it fits super weird. I’ve never had an issue with hats fitting my head. But it like sits on top of your head. It’s very hard to describe. Almost like a trucker hat but like it doesn’t actually fit on your head. It just rises up. Not my favorite hat sadly.
2.0,"The locket is too big, and comes open easily.  With the enclosed container having cremains in it, that would be an even bigger concern that it may open and get lost."
2.0,The product is too big. I bought a kids size and an adult size and even the kids size was too big for the adult.
2.0,"I was excited about this product, but if fell short for me. I Barely got to wear it because it was tight on my shoulders and the side button ripped very easy. When I washed it the threads were already coming loose. Not great quality for me."
2.0,"Definitely run small. I ordered a Large which is what i wear in everything else. I'm 6' and 190 lbs, fairly fit and these fit very small. Kind of a weird mess-jersey material."
2.0,Great fit. They worked out great for about 2 weeks and the one of the arms snapped off randomly.
2.0,Seemed very strong for 1.25. Much too blurry. I've bought others at a 1.25 that were great. Ive kept them for a couple of weeks but I can't wear them.
2.0,"I was disappointed in this, because you couldn’t tell what it was. It was a gift for a friend and I felt like it looked less attractive  than the photo appeared!"
2.0,It fit well but the material is super thin. You could see the lines from my leggings under it. I returned it.
2.0,Too flimsy and the inside did not last a month
2.0,"I ordered a size 9-10 and they were too small. I wear an 8.5-9 shoe size. I am not sure if they just run really small or they sent me the wrong size. There was no size listed anywhere on the slippers or the packaging. I held them up to a size 9 shoe and they were smaller. My foot hung off the back a little so they were likely more of an 8. I was disappointed because they were so soft and had a hard bottle so they wouldn't flatten out after a while like most slippers. The bottom is not soft but the tops are soft. Even though the toe is open, it is so fluffy it would not be noticable and actually easier to stay on when walking. I am bummed about the size. I ended up giving them to someone who wears a size 7 and they fit her perfectly. Beware of possible size issues when purchasing."
2.0,lasted about a week
2.0,"I really didn't like wearing it, and it wasn't easy to get anything in or out of it. But it is as advertised, and I could get my passport and credit cards/cash to fit in it."
2.0,"These are not flattering pants, unless you spend a good amount of time on leg day at the gym. They're not form-fitting, the way the picture indicates."
2.0,"I ordered this for my Travis piercing, but I feel like it was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, so it wouldn’t work because the opening for the ball wasn’t big enough to fit."
2.0,Very sharp and scratchy gota be careful around your hair and face
2.0,"The shirt fit great wore it to an event. As soon as I washed it, the shirt literally shrank two sizes. Feel like I bought this shirt from wish 💁🏼‍♂️"
2.0,I ordered this in a 4T and when I got it it looked more like a 1T… if a 1 T even exsists. Only reason I’ll keep it cuz my sweet baby can wear it a few  weeks and he’ll be outgrown it. I will not order again from this company. Take your chances.
2.0,I gave it 2 stars they r cute but r nylon not faux leather really don’t describe it accurately
2.0,So heavy fabric
2.0,These earrings are ok. They are not of the best quality.
2.0,"did not like the product , what make the dress cute, is  glue"
2.0,Not impressed. They are very see through and not thick at all. Also they fall down and I'm constantly having to pull them up. Wish I would have returned. I was expecting more with the good reviews.
2.0,Nice dress too bad that didn’t fit me
2.0,This hat is cute the only problem is that is was put in a box half its size and this is what it looked like when I received it. Why??? I tried getting it replaced and seeing if there was a way it could possibly be put in a properly sized box and they said no. We have no control. So buy it at your own risk.
2.0,"I want to love it but the quality doesn't match the price tag. This is a beautiful design, however the leaf accents are poorly attached and fraying. Some fell off while unpacking. And since the shipping took forever I'm stuck with it cause I need a dress now. I've had to trim the accent pieces to prevent further fraying and have used hem tape to secure. If you want a dress ready to wear this ain't it. The dress is beautiful but not worth $100+, maybe worth $50 and that's being kind."
2.0,"They were OK, my feet still got cold and I wore my heavy duty boots and another pair of socks..  :("
2.0,"I like the cold shoulder style and it fits true to size.  I normally wear a large, so I ordered the large in this and it fits great.  I'm 5'3&quot; and 150 pounds.  The color and design also looks just like the picture.  My only issue though, which is a big one for me is the quality looks cheap.  The material is thin and silky, but not in a good way.  It looks and feels like cheap polyester in my opinion.  I like the style of this top, but because of the quality I'll be returning it."
2.0,Looks nice but fit small.
2.0,"This ran even smaller than the reviews stated.  I ordered the recommended size, and couldn't get it over my hips.  Plus the material was very very thin, and it looked cheap."
2.0,"I did receive this quickly, so thats a plus. I ordered the silver, which I noticed is not showcased on the website as much as the gold. The gold must photograph better. In person, the silver looks and feels too light And it even doesn’t sound like metal when touching itself. The monogrammed disk is much,  much tinier than I expected, and I’m having trouble  keeping the monogram side facing out. The chain looks like a bubblegum machine toy chain. Not worth the $82 plus shipping.  This is not Gorjana or Kendra quality. More costume-y like Lia Sophia, for a younger person."
2.0,"Performed as expected for the first several wearings. Tight, comfortable, and stylish. Not at all durable. After 5-10 wash/wear cycles they got very fragile, ripping/tearing along the calf just when pulling them onto my feet."
2.0,"They are pretty, however they seem more delicate in person verse their selling photo, where they look more solid. They made my ears burn and flare up within a few hours of wearing them, therefore I'm requesting a refund."
2.0,"The design of this robe is wonderful, but the craftsmanship is a dealbreaker. Brand new out-of-the-box, it has unfinished, unraveling seams in a couple places, exposed elastic around the cuff. So sad because this was a gift for my husband. He was so excited to get it, only to be disappointed by how poorly it was assembled. For the price we paid, it’s not acceptable, and I’m afraid will have to return it."
2.0,Run really small!
2.0,And you get the 80s shoulder puffiness.  Didn't like the fit but nice jacket. I returned!
2.0,"Not made well, Cross design is uneven. Not a winner."
2.0,Too short and too tight around the tummy. Will return.
2.0,Bought this gift for a friend and fits way smaller than expected. She said if it were true to size it would have been perfect.
2.0,Dislike the fact that only the left side light works and then only a slight glow. Not helpful at night at all and yet not worth the cost to return.
2.0,"The color is not yellow, it’s more like beige. I ordered a yellow and natural and could barely tell them apart."
2.0,Way too big and generic looking
2.0,The tiny metal pieces that keep the bands in the metal face SUCK that it came with!!! Thank God I was sent extras with my watch or I wouldn't be able to wear this because they both broke and the springs came flying out!!!! Very cheap!
2.0,great suit. But the chest part  was to large. Felt like my.  Girls are going to. Fall out and. Im not that big  but still.  Geat. Suit to lay around the pool on not for the river at all. Feel like it  would. Fall apart if I was. Doing anything.  Heavy  Thing with it while wearing it . But love the. Suit  just wish it would of fit on the. Chest part everything. Eles didn't
2.0,It's wearable but it stretches out over your fleshy parts and it grabs your belly and places you don't want it to
2.0,The ears are tiny. The tail has NO OPTION To hook on.
2.0,Stiff hurts your ears
2.0,"Perhaps it's better for women, or guys with small heads, but it didn't fit me."
2.0,Great concept but the band broke....need to fix that.
2.0,The fabric was cheap and not soft at all. I washed it once to see if it would soften up and there was barely a noticeable difference.
2.0,The product looks and feels cheap.
2.0,"I ordered this in pink and was disappointed to receive a baby pink shirt when I was expecting the more subdued, light pink shown in the photos. The fabric also appears very different from the photos. I was expecting a thicker sweatshirt material but in reality this item is a thin ribbed fabric. It is comfortable so that's why I gave the extra star but I look like a clown at a pajama party in this. Totally deceived by the photos and will be returning."
2.0,Horrible looks like it was cut on the bottom
2.0,I liked the earrings but the back loop bars were way to large and stuck out way behind my ears..
2.0,"Nice quality clips, but damn near impossible to get on even with a thinner tie.  Ended up not even being able to use. Still two stars for a quality product though."
2.0,"They did not work for my husband, because, the gloves were not true to size. I purchased a Men's X Large for him but they seemed Medium sized."
2.0,I never actually wore them but the fabric just seemed to odd and like it would adsorb water if wet/ in snow.  Cheap quality.
2.0,"The product was ok, especially for the price, but nowhere close to true to size!"
2.0,The brim is so floppy that I cant see past it. It does not have any shape.
2.0,Arrive with broken box
2.0,"This is not the same dress as the other reviews. The design on the bodice is NOT embroidered-- it is printed on and looks very CHEAP. The lace stops on each side and does not continue to the back, which is what the dresses in the other photos have. The bodice in the back is a very see-through white chiffon-like material. The belted detail around the waist is embroidered and was pretty. Overall, it was very cheap looking and I returned it! I wish I would have taken a picture of the dress before I boxed it back up for return!"
2.0,"I wasn't sure if this would be a gift for a friend or a keeper.  The picture is deceiving.  The beret is not the same pattern and also is a ""dirty"" color.  The magnetic bracelet is too tight and uncomfortable.  I did like the lightweight earrings and the necklace.  I wanted the 4 piece matching set and was so disappointed."
2.0,After reading the reviews I got an XXL. I am a 36D and thought that it would fit. Nope. It was way too baggy on top and the bottoms barely stayed up. The sizing for the top and bottoms are not the same. Would be nice to get one size in the top and another in the bottom. Other than that the pattern was cute.
2.0,No es muy bonito
2.0,"This was not what I expected.  It is made of plastic and seem to be cheap looking, When I contacted the vendor about my displeasure they wasn't willing to compromise."
2.0,"Lace area at the fold of the sock is way too small and doesn’t fit over an average adult size calf. If you have very thin legs, it may work for you!"
2.0,The adhesive on the mustaches were very poor quality and did not stick very well.<br />I have three sons of all different ages and sizes and the eye patches were too tight on all three of them. The earrings and hats were the only things my children could wear through out their pirate theme day but for the price I somewhat expected it
2.0,This shirt fits very different.  I ordered an extra large because I like shirts to be loose on me.  I am normally a medium.  I am 135lbs 5’7” 34DDD for reference.  The shirt fit in the chest area with a lot of room but felt a little snug around the waist.  It was super short and looked like a box even though it was smaller at the waist.  They put double fabric around the embroidery but left more fabric about 4-6 inches around and you can see it through the shirt so it looks a little odd.  If I bend over the shirt slides down and my chest and bra shows!  Embroidery is pretty though 😂
2.0,"Love the shirt, nice light material, flowy in all the right places...but the arm on one side is cut funny or sewed wrong or something and I'm constantly pulling it down. Makes it feel crooked or something."
2.0,I returned the dress.  The tie in front way very big and hung awkwardly.
2.0,"Colors are beautiful but one snag and I had a huge hole in the front that grew by the day.  After one wear, the sweater accumulated fuzz balls."
2.0,This isn’t the print I thought I was ordering. The picture on my order is not the same as this bathing suit?
2.0,"Looks poor, cheap in the daylight.  I can only comfortable wear them at night."
2.0,"I absolutely loved this when I first got it, but over time it’s shown so much wear. I don’t put it in the dryer, and I wash it on delicate, and still the fabric is piling everywhere. It’s such a shame because this is a very comfy cardigan."
2.0,"I measured my glasses carefully to be sure the suglasses would fit over them; they are frameless and not large.  Even so, the sunglasses do not sit comfortably over my glasses.  I am disappointed but will continue to use the sunglasses."
2.0,"Everything I've gotten from Amazon so far seems to only fit Skinny, Small girls, and women."
2.0,"I am a 34DD I ordered the S/M and yes it fit but it offers zero support. My jugs just slide around inside this bra.  The back is super cute, so I am very disappointed that it can't contain my girls."
2.0,Only had it month paint is gone on tires...
2.0,"Pockets ripped on first use, and the waist band is scratchy."
2.0,"You get what you pay for. Price was low but the top was so tight I could barely get it over my child’s head literally had to force it on and squeeze her head through neck line. And once it was on it was so ugly, clown suit. I cut top off with scissors at neck line to get it off & threw it away.  Pants were cute though so I kept those , it’s a soft stretchy material. Under the leg ruffles is white instead of color of pants so that makes material look pretty cheap."
2.0,Cheap material and flimsy.
2.0,"Heart was beautiful, but chain was ridiculously big"
2.0,"Too bulky, they are extremely thick to carry in your pockets. But at that price can’t expect quality product.<br />My recommendation look for something pricier but better quality that you’ll like better."
2.0,Does not stay on way to big my husband wont even wear have to assemble the breathing circle vents seems they would allow germs to go right through the 2 circle vents.  Hard to get on and off.
2.0,It's really big and it fits really funny. The striped part of the sleeves is made from a very different type of fabric that does not blend well with the t-shirt type fabric of the green material; the striped part kept bunching funny on my arms.
2.0,"If you're a member of the Itty Bitty Titty Club, this would be awesome for you. Girls with ""big"" breasts at DDD or F, this might be okay for you. Ladies with BIG BOOBIES, move along. I have 38H breasts and the band under the breasts doesn’t get tight enough to hold the girls. And if you get a band that does fit, then you have so much side boob hanging out of the bra that you may as well wear pasties. Skinny girls with BIG BOOBIES, don't bother. Move along. And if you find a bra that works, TELL ME."
2.0,The straws do not work! We even tried to cut them to where he could suck out of them and they were crimped. He still wore the hat with empty beer cans for looks
2.0,"fabric is different than I expected more a slippery fabric than soft. It is definetly larger than I expected.  fits more like a tshirt dress than a tshirt,hopefully it will shrink in the wash."
2.0,"Poor material quality, does not look as elegant as the picture, bright white color and looks cheap.  I did not wear and missed the return window.  Buyers remorse"
2.0,The logo is a bout 3x smaller than advertised and the hat doesn’t seem to want to fit despite adjustments.
2.0,As soon as I opened it I knew I wasn't going to like it. The material isn't silky the way it looks in the pictures. It's more of a curtain type material. I am sending it back.
2.0,I ordered this dress twice and both times the pattern on the dress was upside down and looks nothing like the picture. It looks like jellyfish instead of cacti. I am extremely disappointed because I really like the dress and it fits me extremely well.
2.0,Bought these for my dad who is 98 and has very thin skin on his arms. He could not use them as they felt too tight and scratchy. I ordered another brand and they are much better for him.
2.0,They tore after 3 uses.
2.0,Disappointed with the product
2.0,"The fit was fine, but it did nothing for me.  There are padded cups within the 2 layers of material and they sort of float around.  It didn't work for me so I returned it."
2.0,"snug weight, long and large arms and breast area, weird material, didn't stay on shoulders"
2.0,"The material is great, but when you move, they fall down. Very annoying."
2.0,It's beautiful but sooooo extremely tiny. I wear a US size 12 or Large so I ordered the XXL. Unfortunately it does not fit no room for boobs. It is way smaller than described.
2.0,These shoes are terrible. The only thing I like about them is the height but they are very unsteady. I wear a lot of stripper shoes and they are much better than these. These are always causing me to fall or trip. Now I only use them for the bedroom. DO NOT BUY !!Be WAre!!
2.0,Sizing is bigger than normal so get a size smaller and it's not exactly what is pictured... I wouldn't buy it again but I still kept it for my days off to run errands in around town. I wouldn't wear it for any other purpose though
2.0,"These leg warmers are SOOO TIGHT!!! I wear a size medium (8/10) and have normal sized calves and these were painful to wear. There is no stretch to the material at all, including the black liner inside. I ended up cutting out the liner and the elastic bands to make them bearable enough to wear for 2 hours of trick-or-treating tonight.<br />Granted, I was wearing them over skinny leg pants (welcome to Northeastern Halloweens), but they were so tight I was legitimately concerned about blood flow.<br />These are definitely not made for anyone bigger than a size small."
2.0,"The hat is too small, it’s like a kids hat not an adult."
2.0,"Well. I don't like it. The reason is, is because it broke and it's not easy to fit onto my ear. It's difficult for me and I just don't like the quality."
2.0,"This hat is super cute... However it has a horrible shape, it is weirdly flat in the front and just doesn't fit right. Looks super dorky, pretty disappointing.  Probably won't wear."
2.0,Product runs small in length and width- order a size up. Very soft and cute.
2.0,Picture taken next to some of my other daith jewelry. You'll notice it's much smaller than I was expecting. I tried it anyways and it kept coming open or the hinge piece would catch uncomfortably on my ear.  On top of that it made my ear red and itchy.
2.0,This device did not fit my watch  since my watch does not have an adjustable strap. If it had a buckle then that would be fine. It should state this in the description!
2.0,Links fell apart after a few months use.
2.0,was just ehhhh……….
2.0,Way to small for a mans wrist
2.0,It is very difficult to tell that it is navy blue - looks like black and I did not want black.
2.0,"The fit is as expected and they're super soft - pretty much the same exact material as the leggings everyone seems to be trying to sell on FB lately. 😏 But the waistband isn't comfortable, it sort of digs in. I much prefer a wider waistband vs these elastic ones."
2.0,Picture definantly looked nicer
2.0,Does not follow sizing chart. About 2 sizes too smal
2.0,"The shirt fit well, but the built in lining was small and would cause the shirt to rise. Forget about trying to lift your arms. The lining is really embedded in shirt, otherwise I would have cut it out. Returned."
2.0,This was too small and hard to get into.  Save your money and get something else that's made better.
2.0,"It’s proper! I wear it everyday. It’s not took heavy, but it’s not so light that it flies around and gets in the way. I love that part of it is matte and the other part is glossy. It looks awesome and, being born in the year of the rat, it channels my inner Splinter.<br />UPDATE: it’s glass! First time in hit the ground it shattered."
2.0,These aren't really plus size. I'm a US size 14-16 and they just didn't really fit.
2.0,"I loved this little carabiner at first. It gives the convenience of a carabiner without adding too much bulk and it keeps everything nice and organized. It's been my constant pocket companion, but I have only occasionally used the carabiner part. I got it about 2 and a half years ago, and for the last couple months, the gate hasn't been closing all the way. This means that my key ring has a tendency to swing up in there and form exactly the sort of snarl that I wanted to avoid! I got the nice titanium one because I thought it would be better quality than that, but it tuns out it lasts about as long as any cheap carabiner but at many times the price."
2.0,"The fabric of this dress is CHEAP and it looks inexpensive. It is a shame really. A softer material would give the beautiful flow that the pictures of the model seems to imply, but the shiny stiffness means I would be embarrassed to wear it in public."
2.0,Fits good the only thing is that the zipper on the bottom only opens about 3 inches so if I want to change her diaper I have to take the whole thing off it buttons on the top left should
2.0,Not as I had expected; looks much like a toy. Very disappointed...
2.0,Tarnished quickly and clasp would not polish back to silver!
2.0,"This shirt started to fall apart after two washes. It was tight when I got it. Didn't love it, but I did keep it."
2.0,"The picture is misleading, I ordered this as a Christmas gift.  I was surprised to learn when it arrived it is the top only, not a set."
2.0,"I feel a lot of improvements need to be made to make this a really good watch. I like the style and the way it looks. It is heavy and bulky, but nicely designed to still look feminine. It can be paired with the app. It does track steps. It does notify you of incoming emails/texts & calls by vibrating. It's just way too complicated because it only gives you a choice to save a handful of contacts. I just don't like the way it functions."
2.0,"Not a v neck but a deep U swoop, there’s no tag inside so you don’t know the front from the back, AND it is also COMPLETELY see-through which was a really big disappointment I was hoping for something thick and cute for Halloween since I’m a big fan of the Coraline movie but looks like imma return this 🙄 it was a letdown to my expectations"
2.0,"These compression socks would be nice except that they inhibit circulation at the top cuff. I bought them to control varicose veins starting to form during pregnancy. Also, I’m a nurse so I know how these things are supposed to function. After wearing them for 8 hours, I had developed a pain at the cuff site (top thick band at top of sock). When I removed the socks, the veins were markedly more noticeable just distal to the sock cuff. After 5 minutes of no socks, the vein appearance subsided significantly.<br /><br />I would not recommend because they impede  circulation, causing pain and worsening vein congestion."
2.0,They are pretty gloves. I gave it two stars because one of the red ones is torn and I’ll have to sew up the seam.
2.0,Bling separating from the band within a week! Not durable at all! Looked pretty for the first week...disappointing
2.0,Crown is misspelled  (cronw) and is super hard to open
2.0,Bought this bracelet for my daughter-in-law who had just lost her brother. The bracelet would not fit over her hand or mine. Sized for a child or tween but not for an adult even with small hands.
2.0,These bands are much narrower then I had thought. They fit and perform just as well as the band that came with the watch.
2.0,"The idea is great, the execution not so great. The quality of the cups is extremely poor and did not fit properly at all leaving a gap. I think you need a very specific body type to make this work. I wanted to wear it under a strappy dress to avoid bra and underwear lines but you can clearly see the u shape in the front through the dress. The straps themselves weren't very easy to adjust and no matter what length they were at, they left a gap on the side as shown in picture.  Returning this item as it just won't work."
2.0,"I was kind of disappointed when I used it because the material underneath the fabric started bendinging up after only a couple of times using it.  I feel like it is cheaply made, I probably wouldn't have bought it if I would have seen it in the store."
2.0,Will not stay open with the provided braked.<br /><br />The lid needs two hands to keep this open.<br /><br />Had hoped for something of higher quality.<br /><br />The opening latch also takes some talent with two hands to open.<br /><br />Do no recommend unless you have 4 hands helping with glasses selection in the morning.
2.0,Such an odd fit and material looks a little cheap
2.0,beautiful top but way too small
2.0,"I love how pretty this is. I made sure to air it out because of other reviews concerning a chemical smell. I didn't notice it on mine. However, I wore this to a wedding, no stress on the material at all and the seam holding the trim on snapped and a big piece detached. It's a simple sew fix, but I wish it wasn't necessary."
2.0,"I thought I would like this, but I totally don't it is very sheer and cannot be worn without something underneath, making this useless.  The size is correct, and just as expected.  The fabric is cheap and thin, and see-thru.  The back is a solid cream color that matches the front, but is a stretchy fabric, and it is very thin and cheap.  I expected more from this brand. Disappointed, low quality cheap fabric."
2.0,"I had a metal 2g spacer in my ears and it was snug.  These floated around in the same holes.  I'll just leave my ears empty for few days to shrink.  But, it's something to note that you'd have to stretch it out a little again to wear metal or silicone that are true 2g.  Also missing one of the cobalt blue with gold veins.  The materials are nice though."
2.0,This set is very cute but runs so tiny. I never even got to wear it. It’s like children size small.
2.0,The set was very pretty and constructed pretty well but runs 1-2 sizes small
2.0,"The heating element in these gloves is a decent sized patch right in the middle of the palm/back of hand.  For me, it gets too warm to sit directly on my palm and I have to take them off after 10 minutes or so.  If I turn them over so that the heating 'patch' is on the back of my hand, it is still uncomfortably warm in the one spot on each hand.  These are handy for a warm up but not wearing for hours (like I need)."
2.0,"Not nearly as nice as I'd hoped. Lenses are loose in the frame, (right out of the package) and actually rattle when wearing. These will go into a glove box as abandoned except for 'emergency' use. All in all, just cheap plastic. They'd have been worth maybe 1/5th of the price and just not worth the hassle to return."
2.0,"These are tiny, more like a children's medium rather then adult."
2.0,It's too small for me. I checked my size on the chart but wasn't accurate. I will return this.
2.0,Backside of necklace was very rough and had to be filed down in many places.
2.0,Returned as it was too loose and see-through.
2.0,"This is a nice jersey but the sizing is way off.  We bought it for our 5 year old thinking it would still give her room to grow, it didnt even fit out three year old who is in 3t clothes. The neck hole was too small to go over either of their heads."
2.0,My daughter loves the case but it's not as nice or made as well as you might think. The case handles are a tough plastic that are always leaning to one end of the case. The case does not close evenly and looks like the hinges are put on slightly bent. It's not much or very noticeable but I noticed it after removing it from the package for inspection.
2.0,By far the worse case I have ever owned - dropped it once from about 8&#34; and the plastic cracked and my phone fell out the top. Do not buy this product.
2.0,Not as described- too small
2.0,"the 10.5 toddler size was an inch longer than my toddler's size 10 shoes.  Also, not sure if its intentional, but the inside soles of both shoes seemed like they were way too big for the shoes - they bubbled up.  Returned these."
2.0,Too tight at top band.
2.0,I can't wear it. Too large.
2.0,Cheap. Loose strings. Looks cheap feels cheap. Is just used for play but if I had bought it for something like a wedding I would be mad.
2.0,"I’ve had 3 pairs of these bibs, one with a gray graphic and one with a blue graphic. The gray ones have held up fine and are dependable shorts for the price. The elastic gripper on the blue shorts came off in the first wash. I contacted the seller and got a replacement but the same exact thing happened. There is some sort of flaw with the blue shorts."
2.0,sleeves are too small my arms doesn;t fit into the sleeve. will give the dress to my daughter she is a small size.
2.0,It's ok. The gold stamped writing isnt done very well.
2.0,Ordered an 2X it's more like a 2X in kids.  Gave them to my daughter who wears 10 in juniors.  Cutting pattern no where close to the picture.
2.0,I liked the look but they don't fit.
2.0,The black ones were un-useable.  They were significantly smaller than the biege and white.
2.0,"Though they came in the pack and were there on time, it was too small to actually fit in my helix piercings. So, had to return it. I got my money back in less than two days though, so that was good."
2.0,Not as bright blue as the picture. Also needs to be wore with a pedicoat or will be to much fabric to wear alone.
2.0,The dress arrived with several stains and the fabric  is very thin. The arm opening is not a good shape.
2.0,This was so small! I ordered a large and there was no way I could have fit in this. Looks like a large is about the same size as a normal store's small size.
2.0,Size small was huge and I did not like the material. Returned.
2.0,"Not really a good fit for a taller person, the waist sits too high. Not flattering"
2.0,Glasses came ok. But they are loose and won't stay on my face. I can't wear them.
2.0,Fabric was nice and thick but garment is big and shapeless. Pocket in seam contribute to the bulky shapeless look . It is going back.
2.0,Should get one star -  but sooooo cute I will give it two. Bow on the front fell off within an hour of wearing. NOT even swimming. Hem on the tail was defective upon receipt. Sooooooo disappointing!
2.0,"Would've loved this. But it broke first time I wore it :/ I know it was a cheap costume jewelry buy, but would have expected at least a few more wears before whole thing broke :(("
2.0,"Nice quality handkerchief however they have prints similar to bandanna. These are not cotton square bandanna, they only have the pattern. The tag says they are 100% silk pocket squares mostly for suits. They would not be useful for daily things like gardening, or utilitarian work. I spent money because I looked at the photo and didn’t read all the details. If you dress up and want pocket squares, they are good quality, if you need working bandanna type handkerchiefs don’t buy these."
2.0,JUST AWFUL!!  NO flavor at all - we hate them!  AND THE PRICE WAS EXORBITANT!!!
2.0,"The bag looks well made and may hold a fair amount but the handles are too short to carry on shoulder.<br />I used the bag today for the second time by adding a shoulder strap from another bag; not good, the skin of the bag is peeling off. The bag is made of poor materials but has a nice presentation. It does hold a lot."
2.0,These are really see through and give you a camel toe don’t recommend for gym use
2.0,Tough to return (to Canada) and it is such thin material it just sags on me...Now I need to find the cheapest way to return it to Canada...big pain
2.0,I wear a small so I order a med as they say that it runs small .well this fit me so big that the shirt just hang on me.can not wear it.a big waste once again
2.0,Does not last long. The flowers on Each headband fell off after each use.
2.0,I really like the watch but this is unexceptionable for the price. The Replacement came and I am back to enjoying the watch.<br /><br />Edit: 3 months later the self winding is no longer working and I’m unable to return it
2.0,Ordered size L. Not what I expected. Skirts need to be displayed with actual fitting size chart.<br />Don't enjoy wearing tight fitting clothing.
2.0,"As mentioned by one prior reviewer, these socks absolutely DO slip off the heel.  (I do not have narrow feet or narrow heels.)  Bummer; they are very cute colors."
2.0,Nothing what I expected.
2.0,"Dress was too large, didn't get to wear it for a wedding I was in."
2.0,"The glasses themselves were fine. The problem was the materials of the frame, particularly the pads that fit the frame to the nose. After a few months of use the pads started to disintegrate, releasing an oil-like substance to the glasses, which then always always looked blurry and dirty. I do not recommend this article."
2.0,Not s god fit
2.0,I liked them but they are too small. Order one size larger than you usually wear. Nice short tho.
2.0,"I cannot really say if this will work as it was way too small.  I do not know if even a large would fit my husband and he is smaller than me.  I was really excited about this, but cannot try it out."
2.0,"Nice material and cute on top, but the slit is right down the middle and is only attached at the waistline, meaning that when you walk the dress exposes EVERYTHING. This would only work with a same-colored slip underneath. Will be returning."
2.0,"Really doesn't work for larger breasts. Such a great concept and I wish it would work because I just need a tiny boost, but it just isn't shaped right for larger breasts."
2.0,I was really excited about this when I ordered it and I received it and my daughter wore hers once it broke.
2.0,Quality of the connector and cords is good. The rings are very small and it is very difficult to get keys on to them. Needed two set of needlenose pliers to try to feed the rings through the cord connections.
2.0,I wish the wood were thinner.  They look kind of awkward jutting out so far.
2.0,I was not able to hang my badge and keys from this. It’s just not very strong
2.0,"I normally wear a L-XL, I ordered an XL and it fit like a Medium. I could never wear this out due to the fact that it is completely see through."
2.0,"I just got this in the mail today and the watch looks really good and the detailing on the back is beautiful, but within having this for five minutes the chain broke. I think I'll be able to repair it, but this watch's price is on the low side for a reason"
2.0,So cute but I have bought two pairs and they broke without any trauma
2.0,"Wasn’t oversized at all ,the sleeves was short and wasn’t sewn right. Disappointing . Definitely wasn’t as nice as advertised."
2.0,Very cheaply made. Don't fit well.
2.0,"HAIR EVERYWHERE!!!!!<br /><br />it's cute, but doesn't stay on, slips around and nothing on it to keep the ends together so when you put it on you better have saety pins in hand.<br />my bed/coats look like i rubbed a white cat on them."
2.0,I didn't even try it on because the material of the skirt has that shiny cheap look to it. Other patterns/colors might be better. The top was cute. Would be great otherwise.
2.0,Hard to do on my self
2.0,Got it a day late. Doesn't sound like a HUGE deal but it is when you live on a main road
2.0,Poo poor quality. I received the shirt and the material is very thin and under the arm it was ripped. I was very disappointed when I got this shirt.
2.0,"After wearing it a second time, the bracelet broke. The hat is made for a smaller head and as people stated in previous reviews... the earrings does not match the pattern of the necklace, bracelet or hat."
2.0,"I love it, but will have to have it altered to be a top. Runs very small below the waist."
2.0,"I love the idea, but the first one I purchased eventually fell apart, and the second one came apart literally the second day of wear. I love the design but the quality is just not doing it for me."
2.0,The prints are out of zoom and look cheap.
2.0,"Waist fit fine, I guess I'm more of a boxer guy, these hugged me too tight down under."
2.0,"I loved the purple camo leggings, they weren't see through at all and were a lovely fun pattern.  However, 3 wears in, and not even working out in them, just wearing them for normal use, they started to pill and wear where my purse rubbed them and between the thighs.  I tried to used my fabric shaver on them to take the pilling off but the whiteness where they had been rubbed was obvious and looked horrible.<br /><br />I have a dozen pairs of the space dye ones, but covid weight gain has me looking for a size up and these are not comparable at all.  Please bring back the space dyes!!!"
2.0,"Cheap ties bad stitching, will last only for a couple uses. A  cheap choice for salemen I guess."
2.0,"I wanted to like these, but ended up returning them after trying them on a few different times. The fit wasn't right for me. Not that they were too small or too big but just ill fitting. And the fabric showed every single dimple on my butt and thighs. You could even see the outline of the front pocket very plainly. The fabric is not forgiving at all. I'm 5'6"", 130.<br />These might work for someone that is extremely fit with a perfect backside."
2.0,"when i separated the segment from the ring there was a lot of black stuff inside, and some yellow crust too. I have to disinfect it multiple times to get rid of all that is dirty. do not use as it comes or you could end up with an infection or worse!"
2.0,It is a very good Watch!
2.0,Not a typical material. Ran very small.
2.0,"Cute purse, but the strap tore off in less than 3 weeks. ):"
2.0,Material not quality
2.0,"I found the sweater to be itchy so I returned it. However, the color was as described and fit nice. Just wish it was softer."
2.0,"It's cute, and I love the pattern, but I only weight 110 pounds, and this dress didn't even fit around me. It is open at the front like a robe, and the photo doesn't really show that. I'm sure the product description would've helped me out. If you are very small, and you want this dress, I would stress that you buy it in a much larger size."
2.0,"So disappointed in quality, there were black lines all over the back of the shirt- ugh.  Should send back, but really wanted the shirt for a trip."
2.0,"The collar wrinkle like hell, it could be easy to avoid via putting a cardboard<br />Now I need to put extra effort to fix it..."
2.0,The fabric was not as expected.  I️ was looking for more of a denim look
2.0,"These are rather thin, which is fine, but my complaint is that the elastic at the top was very tight and made it look like I had like...thigh muffin top? Is that a thing? Like, I'm no twig, I'm a size 6, though, and it seems a bit absurd that these over the knee stockings actually wouldn't quite work above the knee. If you have super thin legs or plan on wearing these like right on your knees, though, I guess they'd be fine."
2.0,"If you have a belly don’t get it, it will cling."
2.0,"I’m 5’5 and usually wear a large, but I couldn’t even zip the XL. The length was great - mid thigh and the quality seemed great."
2.0,"Why is the shirt neck different from what I ordered? Other than that - I like it, but I would like an explanation.....<br /><br />-irritated in FL"
2.0,They are too flimsy and way too big! Disappointed!
2.0,"Had some issues with my order, and the mask themselves.<br />First, the order- My EyeSnug box came ripped open. The way it looked, it looked like I received someone else's returned item. Last thing I want to do is put something on my face, over my eyes that someone else had opened and possibly used. I did contact the company and they allowed me to exchange my opened box for &#34;new&#34; box. The second box I got was not ripped open; however this one was not sealed... someone pealed the plastic seal off. I was not going to deal with contacting the company again so I decided to just hand wash them and try them out...<br />now onto the second problem--<br />Second, the fit- These masks are the largest fitting sleep masks I have ever used. I have tried many different types and brands of masks and never had a problem with the over all fit. These are very long and wide with a very deep nose. I'm guessing the only way these would fit perfectly correctly is if you have a larger nose and a wide face. Otherwise the light will come in from all sides but mostly the nose to cheek area. I wanted these to work because the ones I love cost the same price for only one mask compared to two but I cant. Going back to my holy grail- Bucky 40 Blinks!"
2.0,Colors not even right… purple supposed to be maroon black and red? and it is too small bought one size up and still doesn’t fit right
2.0,The atomic part is scetchy at best
2.0,"I sent these back, it looked as though once I opened it, which I couldn’t do, I would need to glue it shut.  Wasn’t what I wanted.  If it had an easier way to get a logo into it they would have been perfect.  Sorry, just didn’t work out for me."
2.0,"This was very much t-shirt material... a little thinner than I was expecting, but it didn't seem to be see-through. I'm tall, 5'11"", 155 lbs, slim pear, and got the medium (red). The fit was ok, a couple inches above my knee, and I felt like it was a bit tight through the shoulder/bodice area (I'm about a 32D or 34C). I didn't care for it in the back, because I have a round butt, and jersey material always seems to cling instead of draping. It was very wrinkly from being packaged, but it would have probably relaxed with washing. Could be a good casual summer dress, but it just didn't fit me how I wanted."
2.0,Looks very cheap and it's better to buy for a child 11 years or younger
2.0,I did not receive what is pictured/described. Pretty disappointed
2.0,"The actual dress isn't quite as bright and pretty as in the picture. The length and overall fit would have been fine (I'm 5'8"", 150 lb and bought a large), but the darts sewn in to shape the top were meant for an A cup - not really appropriate for the large size that fit everywhere else."
2.0,"I bought several of these for gifts and they were really neat but it's true what they say, you get what you pay for! Almost everyone we gifted them to can't wear them because they broke and every necklace broke around the same area! I tried to repair it and even bought a gold chain so my wife could at least enjoy the pendant, which it the reason we purchased them but they definitely won't last much longer. Next time I would say spend the extra money and get ones made of better quality!"
2.0,Fit too small and took forever to get.
2.0,These were very shiny. I was not expecting them to be shiny.
2.0,This top is a lot longer than the picture shows! Very disappointed
2.0,Aquí dice que ya me fue entregado mi pedido pero yo no lo eh recibido aun que puedo hacer
2.0,"This item is true to size; however, the material looks very cheap, and I will be returning specifically because of the material quality. It is difficult to tell from the pictures on Amazon, but this dress is made of a shiny material that easily wrinkles. In addition, the zipper is of poor quality."
2.0,"It's a cute necklace, but the loop for the chain is off center, so it will never hang straight like shown in the pictures."
2.0,"It is made well, but I ordered a 2XL and the actual size is a 10-12"
2.0,Way too small and very unflattering!! I’m a medium in everything and this medium was so small!!
2.0,"Pants had elastic in back of pants, but was stiff and hard to stretch waist band out at all when pullin pants up or down."
2.0,"I was very unhappy when I received these glasses to find that they are not the color that the photo depicts. Instead of a dark red they are a brighter, cartoon like red."
2.0,"The stripes don’t line up, crooked. It’s pretty see through also. I was hoping it would be better, I still kept it and do wear it, it’s comfortable."
2.0,Pretty earrings but a stone fell out upon arrival.
2.0,The size doesn't match.
2.0,Didn't shine like three picture and clarity is butterflies not vibrant
2.0,little bit itchy
2.0,"Cute pants, good material. ASIAN SIZING. I wear 14/16 and usually an XL and these should be labeled M."
2.0,Small bag
2.0,To  small wrong color more like rose gold not gold
2.0,Material too thin..not what I wanted poorly made.
2.0,Never worn it sat in closet for over a year... scuba cheap material! Shame but save your money
2.0,Love the pants just to big
2.0,The neck is wavy. It’s itchy. I’m sad I spent the money. The end.
2.0,"What I got was NOT fleece. It was a very thin ribbed material. I ordered to wear in cold weather and it most certainly will not be appropriate for that. The fit is nice, it is long enough and I’m about 6’, and it was comfortable. Just don’t expect fleece."
2.0,"They tarnished in less than three days of wearing them and that is with taking them off before bed and not getting them wet. Because I have trouble finding rings for my tiny fingers I tried these. I mean you get what you pay for I guess. I probably should have put clear polish over them right when I got them. They are so cute though ,it's too bad they tarnish so quick."
2.0,"We are missing a screw, only 3 should be 4found the screw in a strange place"
2.0,Too much of a cat eye. Looks cheap.
2.0,returned- sizing was smaller than expected. Not American sizing so be ware.
2.0,"ordered 4-5 for my 5 year old, they fit too small :(<br />they are not 100% cotton."
2.0,They have a head band that only attached on one side.<br /> They roll up on your head and turn the band inside out .
2.0,The first day i wore them the cross fell off. They were pretty. I assume they were not put together correct!
2.0,"The looked great and lenses were dark, but after three or four weeks the plastic frames snapped. Very cheap plastic. I'd give it one star, but about what you expect for the price."
2.0,"I was hoping this dress would fit me, and it was ok, a little “snug” but not uncomfortable. It didn’t look snug so I kept it as it was purchased for special occasion trip. The sleeves are not secured very well but enough to keep the look together. I workout and have muscles so it was snug on my arms and across my back. The stitching didn’t stay as the fabric stretched and ultimately I was only able to wear this dress one time. It’s a cute style and I’ll try to find someone to duplicate it so it doesn’t fall apart.  The fabric also was sewed crooked where the pattern was lopsided. The attention to detail was not there. I wouldn’t buy from this company again. It had so much potential but delivered a huge fail."
2.0,Smaller than depicted
2.0,"Flimsy and out of shape, but for the money spent, at least one pair can still be worn by my child..."
2.0,The ear cuff was to big to stay anywhere on my ear and kept falling off. I couldn't tighten it because the metal was too strong. Not worth buying!
2.0,Runs small so size up. I had to return mine
2.0,The wig was cheaply made and the hair started to fall out from touching it. The bigger issue is that I did not receive the sun glasses that were supposed to be a part of this costume.
2.0,Way too small.  I would suggest ordering 2 or 3 sizes up.
2.0,"It’s a good work dress, pretty modest and loose but arrived with a HUGE RIP 👎 I like the color and most everything about it... the rip is fixable but how lame to arrive that way 🤔"
2.0,Based on the reviews I ordered a larger size and to my disappointment I think they may have sent me a men’s extra-large there was no curvature in the jacket at all it was just a big puffer coat. Super disappointed !
2.0,I couldn’t wear this because of how cheaply made it is. Not actually like the photo. Shoulder straps are badly stiched and not part of the dress as in the photo. fabric hikes up annoyingly almost before even moving.
2.0,Earrings are not as nice as picture shown here. Wouldn't buy again.
2.0,The gloves are very warm and the material is very high quality. My only concern is the zipper on the gloves. They broke off on my first use of the gloves. It was very inconvenient since without the zipper it is too loose. I will have to buy another pair from another company.
2.0,Comfortable to wear.  But the wording is not pronounced and hard to see
2.0,I wear a 34-36 waist. These are still too small at a 36. ?!
2.0,Looks and feels good. Size was accurate. My only complaint is that you can righ through it. So i have to put the same color cami underneath it. Maybe a dark color would be better
2.0,I'm a bit taller than average and this is comically large.  At my natural waist this drags on the floor.  I will be returning this
2.0,One of the bag's stitching is coming off and the zipper is missing the keychain part.. the zipper won't even open. I want to return it but I need it for my trip
2.0,the pair of socks with the smallest fishnest ripped immediately. Before i could even put my shoes on.
2.0,Runs WAAAAY small. Loose threads on top.
2.0,"This dress is not for girls with boobs. I have a D cup and it was a hurdle to get this dress over my chest. I knew right away thus wasn't going to zip up. If they offered an XXL or even and XXXL in this dress I would probably opt for that and it would hopefully be fine. Unfortunately, they don't so I guess I'll just have to find a different dress."
2.0,"Overall decent product for price. Initially wanted to use this bag for gym purposes, on the 30th day, the backpack straps broke and was unable to return item. I did not have heavy items in the bag (resistance bands, hydraflask, floor sliders)."
2.0,"These socks slip into my shoe.  I purchased them because they had a rubber heel and I was hoping they would not slip, but they do."
2.0,"I understand the value of this item was cheap, but many of the glasses came without being together.  Pieces fell out of the bag as I opened the packaging, and I had to put glasses back together."
2.0,too small for average adult neck
2.0,I did not care for the material. It’s a bit heavy for summer. The length was also a bit short.  I am 5’3 and the length came to my ankles.
2.0,Buyers beware!<br />This shirt was made from a very cheap material and I did not like it.  I regret my purchase on top of the fact that they charged $10.99 for the shipping and handling MORE than the shirt itself.  I could not even return it because it would cost another $3.66 to ship it back USPS.  Lesson learned!
2.0,Very thin and pajama like
2.0,I bought 4 of these. They are very pretty but on 3 of the 4 I have lost 1 crystal in each. They still look ok. I am going to go to a local bead shop and see if there is anyway to replace the missing crystal. I won't be ordering any more as the price does not warrant the problems. I'm really hoping I can fix them as they are very pretty.
2.0,"The length of these tank tops was extremely shorter than portrayed. Didn't expect best quality, considering the deal I was getting, but the shortness of the shirt was very disappointing."
2.0,"If you have a shorter torso and longer legs, this item won't fit you quite properly . But that could be just me"
2.0,The gauge size was right but the part that shows was way to big.
2.0,Seams gap under the arms. Color much lighter gray than the picture. Stretches and appears ill-fitting or poorly structured.
2.0,Costume jewlery plastic. Please listen to the reviews. The description is false as many times as it says stainless steel it is PLASTIC. good costume jewlery.
2.0,"Size up, little cheap"
2.0,"Loved the look of this dress and was so excited about it, but it's too sheer. I had to return it."
2.0,Top to big pants to slim robe ok
2.0,"The fabric will be nice for travel. The colorfastness I am not too sure of. After that first wash, the color did not seem quite as bright. The main problem is that any time fabric is just printed on one side and has any stretch to it, areas with any tension on them at all will seem faded as the white back of the fabric pulls.(Therefore, If you are chesty, this would really look bad in that area) In addition, the clingy nature will require you to check your rear area. The fabric gets hung up around the top of your pants. (See the side view photo)However, I like the length of the top. It was just right. I am not a big fan of how the pleating across the chest area looks. I have liked other tunic tops much better.  I will appreciate this top for an upcoming trip, but I will be surprised if it doesn't end up chucked into the donation pile after one season, if it make it that long."
2.0,"I really love this color, but these are super small around the waist, and the leggs are super big, I am sure these are for a swimmer, someone who has larger more muscular leggs, but with the too small waist and the leggs fit too baggy around my back side, I had to return them"
2.0,I like how cushiony it feels but after wearing it for few minutes i felt pain in the bottom of my foot
2.0,"Like everyone says, packaged nicely, although I'd rather have a lighter weighted holder for my purse as this one is really heavy.  For me it doesn't get rid of the glare/halo around the headlights but it turns them yellow which makes it easier on your eyes.  I'll keep searching for glasses that will do more than just be a yellow tint.."
2.0,The material isn’t what I expected. Feels like I’m wearing a choir robe.
2.0,No support. Did not fit good
2.0,Quality is nice but fit is HUGE. I know it's oversized but the width is just silly looking. I usually wear a large on top and it was enormous on me. Sending back.
2.0,Cute. Slightly larger than expected. The studs were bent and misshapen when they arrived. I tried to flatten as best as I could but the back won’t stay on while wearing. I don’t recommend.
2.0,"I ordered this bangle and expected to get THREE bangles.  I was disappointed to find that I ended up with ONLY ONE BANGLE.  The color was true and the bangle was very pretty and just what I wanted.  In fact I ordered two more so that I could get the look I wanted.  I felt, though, that the description was misleading.  If you like this bangle and want ONLY ONE BANGLE I can recommend this one for you."
2.0,"For kids sweatpants, they were expensive"
2.0,"i’m giving 2 stars, not because I don’t love the glasses but because the metal on the black pair contains NICKEL! which caused a bad reaction on my skin and a $12 pair of sunglasses has now cost me a whole lot trying to treat my face. i’ve never had this happen before."
2.0,Returned because too big for my 3 year old and they are very rough!  Cute but not comfortable for kids.
2.0,"I do like that they have no problem connecting to blue tooth and I like the concept.  They have decent sound especially if you can keep the speakers over your ears.-that is one of the problems - if you a moving around even a little the position of the speakers begins to move away from our ears. The cap fits OK to start but began to stretch out pretty fast; stiching construction is OK although recently I have noticed some un-threading. The control buttons also do not remain in the same place which really makes it hard when you want to increase/decrease volume, even recharging the battery...etc."
2.0,"I purchased this shirt to layer  underneath my nursing uniform.  I like the material and the colors. Unfortunately one shirt had sleeves that were different lengths.  The other shirt, the sleeves were too short."
2.0,It is really really tight !
2.0,"I just received this hat in the yellow flower print.  I ordered a medium which is my normal size, but it is quite large.  Too large to keep as it falls over my eyes.  I'm returning it."
2.0,"the boxers started to break after a few washes, my son was really excited when he saw them but then they got ugly"
2.0,It's not friendly for women with big busts. There also seems to be random extra fabric towards the armpit area. Honestly not plus size friendly
2.0,"Cheap, Rattles"
2.0,"Way too small. I'm a size 3, usually wear a small / medium. I wanted to make sure the waist was high enough so I ordered medium. It fits like an XS, super tight and not very comfortable. Order 1-2 sizes up."
2.0,Print lettering on shirt was already cracked and faded right out of the package.  It looks like it’ll completely come off in 2-3 washes.
2.0,Really cute but not enough room for the girls should have listened to previous reviews. Fits almost like a babydoll style dress especially if you are well endowed up top.
2.0,Did not like return product
2.0,Very difficult to get on feet.
2.0,It turned my finger green after the third use and it was such a weird shape.
2.0,Pants were made for someone who is 5’ or less.<br />Way too short
2.0,These rings are so so. But for the price I didn’t have high expectations. They are very flimsy. Put one on and it broke in two when I took it off.
2.0,The bands do fit a 44mm Apple Watch but they’re too long for my wrist. Constantly getting stuck when installing them. Silver pin came off the second time so not very durable. I returned them because I wasn’t satisfied with my purchase since I don’t have any problems like that with the original Apple Watch band.
2.0,"It was very pretty, shorter than i expected. I am a size 14 so i figured i was just too fat. I bought an extender but as i put it on it snaped and fell apart. I never even got to wear it."
2.0,"probably actually fits as &#34;intended&#34;, but to say &#34;oversized&#34; doesn't capture it. &#34;TENT-LIKE&#34; comes closer. Soft and nice color, though"
2.0,"There are minimal instructions on this watches functions. There are no instruction on how to change the digital display time, how to change it to 24hr time, stopwatch functionality, or alarm functionality. The only thing I can get to happen is restarting the seconds to 0, and there is no way im going to do that until the time is correct."
2.0,"Honestly, it was a little big and hurt to get in and out. Uncomfortable on the other side of your nose and collected debris. Easy to see the inside. I would recommend an L shaped ring if you wanted comfort. Looks good though."
2.0,"Impossible to get the gown on without help. It runs small, so order a larger size. Had a funny smell when I opened shipping bag."
2.0,I love this design and appreciate that it is in plus sizes.  I bought one and when I washed it on cold gentle and hung up it shrunk a whole size.  I bought another and the collar was poorly sewn and didn’t match from side to side.  There was a half inch difference in size.  There are quality control issues.
2.0,Very stiff.  Sounds like a track suit when you walk.
2.0,"Very poorly made. Strings hanging, one arm hole different from the other, and too sheer for me. I returned."
2.0,"The waistline is far to long, making the dress too tight at the upper hip and much too loose in the bodice. I will attempt shortening the sleeveless shoulders (2 inches) which will improve (shorten) the top so it will sit at my normal waist & therefore make more room in the hip area.  Hopefully, this will lessen the big armholes.  The downside is that the dress will be 2 inches shorter. If upon doing this, it is still ill-fitting, I will have to return the dress & order something else form a different house. 😪"
2.0,I have ordered from this manufacturer before. This shirt just did not fit.  It was cute but not sized like the others I have ordered.
2.0,The concept was great. With the fleece lining you have to buy two sizes larger than you normally wear. The other thing I didn’t like was they were cut short they were hip huggers. As a man I don’t wear hip huggers. I would never buy this brand. I returned them.
2.0,Shirt was a little too small for my liking. But was soft.
2.0,The jeans were really cute but way too long and too big.
2.0,Just not very impressive up close.
2.0,Shoes are not month old and the strap broke and they gave my son’s feet a rash.  Stick with Croc brand.
2.0,"It's not visible in the photos but the outside is basically nylon,  snags really easy. Also something about the way it's sewn makes them feel like they are on backwards.  Weird,  the front waistband sits higher than the back.  Every time I wear them I end up looking inside for the tag to see if maybe I put them on backwards."
2.0,"I was disappointed this was a very poorly sewn wig.  I had a lot of strings hanging off the inside and the strands of hair was placed too far apart, so you saw the weave of the wig underneath. If I didn't need it for a costume for an event, I would have returned it."
2.0,I ordered my regular size but this runs small. The wine color was most rust looking. The dress i got had already been returned. It was wadded in a wrinkly ball and the tissue was at the bottom of the bag.
2.0,Nice band but does not fit pebble time.
2.0,These chokers are poorly made. 2 of them have already fallen apart. I fell apart the day i tried to wear it i was so mad. Dont waste ur money
2.0,The product does not have the precision/ definition of the letters. My daughter just got it... I'm disappointed.
2.0,NOT wind resistant.  Flipped inside out and it wasn’t that windy. Also it’s very hard to close...DONT recommend
2.0,My daughter was expecting the pack of charms and she was very disappointed when we found out some charms were missing. There were not 100 charms in the package we received:(
2.0,fake silver.
2.0,Its a lot shinier on the sleeve than I expected. Makes it look cheap. I wish it were more metallic as it looks.
2.0,"looks exactly as pictured, was very large and started  coming apart after one short use.. very cute but wouldn't recommend"
2.0,The dress' fabric looks cheap; thin and not quite like it does on the model. This order was a disapointment to me :(
2.0,"Had to use needle nose pliers to extend both sections.  Purely ornamental, will not last as a keychain imo.  We took off chain and have next to a dagerrotype on small shelf.  Expected better quality"
2.0,Nice piece but colour changed and chain turned into tainted-darkish gold after wearing it near a beach area for just one day.
2.0,"I love the sunglasses, but only one pair was polarized. I was very disappointed in that."
2.0,Zipper busted with in 1 hr. And no not due to being too tight 😉 The Velcro in the back of the the shirt kept undoing itself. Straps were too long and I had to keep tugging them up. Not worth the money.
2.0,I didn’t like the band between the bodice and the skirt. It was not flattering around the waist line and it seemed that the pockets were too low. I’d like the fabric and I like the colors.
2.0,arrived smashed
2.0,"The left sandle was defective. The one side of the cloth part of the left sandle was irregular,  it fit very strange. I might order another pair in a different color just to see if its any better than the ones now just sitting in my closet."
2.0,The length is good but the band makes the fabric bunch up really weird.  It looked so funky that I returned it.
2.0,These came down to just below my knee cap. Please note they are not for tall women (5'10+) Returned due to length
2.0,"Cute dress, crappy material- it’s see through!"
2.0,"This necklace didn't cost much,  but you get what you pay for. The quality is very cheap. The stones are a weird color orange that look bad in person. 1 of the stones was glued on crooked, too. I doubt I'll ever wear this, I'd be too embarrassed about the quality and I do not have expensive taste whatsoever so that should tell you it's pretty disappointing."
2.0,"I hate giving negative reviews, but these socks start falling apart and unraveling after a relatively short period of time. I wouldn't buy them again"
2.0,Unfortunately it Looks better in picture than when I received it. The material seems cheap and it’s not a good dress for a formal occasion. It would make a great costume though! Like a fairy or something.
2.0,Although I like the top it’s not the look it or feel that I expected. The gray top in the pic looks thin and stretchy. It certainly doesn’t hang on your body like the pic implies. The top is sort of thick and ribbed. I’m keeping it but was misled by the photos.
2.0,"My wife was very disappointed by this dress. I ordered it actually two sizes too large in case it did run small. Well, the dress is a sad situation. It runs way too small."
2.0,"Cute and a conversation starter on the floor, but it does me no good as it will not keep time correctly!  I purchased the pink and the purple - both are defective. Bummer"
2.0,I should have done my research before purchasing. I bought the Taurus constellation necklace and it isn't even the right one! I'm very disappointed now. What am I going to do with a necklace of a constellation that's not even mine?<br />The actual quality but of the necklace however seems nice. It is dainty and small.
2.0,I had a pair of Dollhouse in boyfriend cut. I thought these would run the same. Nope. Really big. Washing in hot and drying on high trying to shrink them
2.0,It was small on my 3yr old head
2.0,Wore these a few times and the nose pad fell off.
2.0,"Firstly this is not my first pair of blublockers, so maybe I was expecting a little more ""blue blocking."" My first pair were of the darker variety. With this pair I needed a polarized eyewear that covered my entire eye. Does it do the job? Yes, perfectly. Does it look stylish? No. They do not look like I expected them to at all. Which could just be me. But the lenses tilt downward as if perpetually dower in a cartoonish way. I mean I don't have to look at my face, so whatever, but maybe someone out there would feel silly wearing them. Plus I bought these for 27 dollars-- not bad for blublockers.<br /><br />To the point: functional, yet not the most stylish.<br /><br />EDIT UPDATE: The lens fell out within a few weeks, and it's not after any heavy-duty use. Not entirely pleased."
2.0,"I wear a 2xl, I ordered a 3XL so it would be loose and it was skin tight.  I'm not sure where the measurements came from, but they don't reflect the actual garment."
2.0,I bought these shoes to wear to go along with an outfit to take family pictures. They look exactly how they are pictured. They served the purpose. These shoes were uncomfortable and the bow came undone. We had to tuck it back in for the pictures.
2.0,"The fit isn't the greatest, but I guess that's expected for the price. Wrists are snug and fingers are large. I keep extra gardening gloves around for when I have extra helpers, and these will do just fine for that purpose."
2.0,"It's a really nice bag, unfortunately zipper gets jammed and the bag is a lot smaller than I anticipated"
2.0,Made kind of cheaply. The top doesn’t stretch it to small to even get over my shoulders and the bottom part barely goes around my hips. My waist is a 30inch and my hips are 47inch. I just of gone up a size for sure
2.0,Runs very small and lace sleaves had pulls all over. I would not recommend.
2.0,These are very flimsy suspenders but what can you  expect for this price?! So far one clip when flying off like a rocket as I tried to clip it on and stretch it over my shoulder. I have the second one on now. I am hopeful that one works out of the four. Plan to use these on cheap work clothes as I am doing.
2.0,"Not super happy with this purchase. The bra provides little if no support, and is super thin material."
2.0,I like it but little bite small
2.0,"I have been looking for this type of socks for a long time! They do not fit well at all, they keep slipping off. Imagine having to constantly fix your socks, super annoying! I missed the return window by a few days, otherwise these would have gone back."
2.0,Dress was not what the picture looked like.
2.0,"I ordered my normal size the first time and these were way too tight in the toes. So I returned those and went one size up. Now, 4 months later they are basically falling off of my feet because the lining has crushed down. Will no order again."
2.0,"Very light fabric, cheap material, fits but has awkward measurements around the waist and bust. Would not recommend to anyone with larger boobs or bigger butt"
2.0,Two uniboob looking felt like I'm wearing a shield on my chest
2.0,"I thought it was a great watch, thin, looks good But I have worn it for less than a week, no heavy work just teaching new guys. Today i found S2 had fallen off. Bummer"
2.0,This is not the item I received. I got what I ordered. It fits fine.
2.0,"This top was way too big. Would have worked great as a maternity top because it had a lot of stretch too. The material was light and smooth, and the design was as shown, but not wearable with how large it was. Returned."
2.0,"Okay so I've bought plenty of finger lights in the past and I was excited when I found a good price on them since I wanted to hand them out at a festival. Let me just say, these are NOT the durable finger lights I've gotten in the past. The plastic itself on the light has a slit in the back (where they clearly assemble the elastic band) but then the elastic band just falls right out of the slot! I had several friends break there's right away, and not that they couldn't be fixed... if you take special care and have patience and time to slide the band back through the slot... but then you have to carefully put it on your finger without pulling at all, and then DON'T touch it. For such a simple product this manufacturer has sure done a horrible job producing a quality finger light. Next time I'll splurge for the finger lights that are a quarter more a package!"
2.0,"Very Good  looking watch but poor quality, one timer broke on my 26 yrs old son watch, he wore it  1 time, I brought 2- for my son's Christmas. Really mad me upset. Have to return for replacement"
2.0,"Color not as described,"
2.0,"too small had to give it to my son,  the sizes must be for pygmies not anglo saxons"
2.0,Actual color did not match the picture
2.0,"Very thin material, not lined.  Not very good quality.  I sent it back."
2.0,"Although these fit according to the sizing guide, these are not compression at all.  If you want a lightweight workout tank, these are fine.  If you want any semblance of compression, this isn't for you."
2.0,Very very very very small.
2.0,I thought this were sweat pants and they are way too think to be sweatpants I can see through the material. The only good thing is that they fit as expected.
2.0,Cute but very very small and I don't think I have that large of a head
2.0,Very small and fragile.
2.0,"These are cute, but very long and a star broke off the first day i had worn them"
2.0,"I was so excited about these boots. I normally wear a women’s US size 11 but they were too tight so I bought a 12. They cause horrible blisters an the back of my ankle. Also, the ankle is really wide and not very flattering. It looks bulky and it sags a bit."
2.0,"I normally can wear a size 2XL American and a 3XL size from Asia safely, so that's what I ordered. The jacket looked nice on arrival, but putting it on, it was way too small. The sleeves were slim and tight from top to bottom and the front would not close, by a couple inches. It was so small I simply returned for refund rather than try the 4XL, which I believe would still be too small and too tight for me. This is what we would call a form-fitting garment for a slim person, and probably should be ordered 3 sizes larger than usual even then. I do wish these Imports to the American market were sized for Americans, or at least sized up to 6 XL! Edit: I have lately been ordering a 5 XL in an Asian jacket in order to get a 2XL fit. Some simply don't offer a size that large so I pass them by."
2.0,I often found it falling off while changing shirts.  I was in a store and had a sweatshirt on and lost it in my sleeve.  The watch case is probably the first thing I didn't like.  It got so dirty under there that it was hard to see my watch
2.0,They are comfortable. However after wearing them once to an hour long water aerobics class the bottoms had multiple large holes and needed to be thrown away :(
2.0,"In the photo, this bra looks lightweight and smooth-fitting.  But because of the removable pads, which are thick and lumpy, the cups have 3 layers of fabric PLUS the thick cups, which make for a very hot undergarment in the summer!  Without the pads, the bra cups no longer look smooth when wearing a t-shirt.  Perhaps this bra will work for the cold winter months, but definitely not a good choice for July and August."
2.0,"I will begin by saying that I have had a great experience with Leveret pajamas and have two pairs that my one year old has worn for a few months now. In this order, I bought two pairs of short sleeved and short pajamas.  They were wrapped separately in plastic.  One pair had an immediately noticeable pungent smell, almost like super mildew.  I have washed them three times and can still smell it.  I have yet to put them on my son and can only hope that letting them air out for a couple of weeks will improve the smell.  The second pair did not have this smell, but ripped in the seat the first day he wore them! I did not consider them to be too tight for him and only washed them once prior to his wearing them. After my initial experience with Leveret PJs, I told some friends that they could be compared to Baby Gap, but at a lower cost.  I am now likely to retract that statement based on this experience."
2.0,Nice set however after a few  wear of the necklace it started to change color ... The ring fits so tight
2.0,Cool looking but it was very very small. my XXL was more like a Medium or Large.
2.0,"I wanted to love this shirt. It's a bright,  unflattering green with a boxy, bordering on cropped cut. Wasn't a keeper for me."
2.0,"Oh my goodness, the smell is atrocious. I've vented these shoes for over a month now, and the plastic/chemical smell will not go away. My daughter wore them once, and she got blisters on the top of her foot. We ordered a size larger and they fit correctly, but I would not buy them again. Too bad, because they're adorable"
2.0,a size extra large was actually a medium.  very disappointing
2.0,it is pretty but kinda cheap looking
2.0,"The skirt portion where the buttons are is not good due to not being sewed together between the buttons, so your skin shows through the dress along the front."
2.0,The earrings were very cheaply made. The materials are sub-par. I would not purchase again.
2.0,"Does NOT look like waves.  It is light and cheap feeling.  The safety clasp is questionable.  This would be overpriced at $100, let alone $285!  It's a pretty gold thing on your wrist is what it equates to.  I'll be returning it."
2.0,Dislike....fabric
2.0,very disappointed with the quality and general look fo the socks. Ther were gifts to our grandsons and we thoight they would be better than they turned out to be.
2.0,"Very weird cut to this.  Awkward seem placement causes it to bunch up at upper arm.  Roomy through body (as expected) but forarms very tight.  Just a really strange shape to the garment.  Also, from the picture I expected more of a knit sweater, but it's just made from a thin cotton fabric.  I contacted seller to return it, but they just gave me a refund and said to keep it, so customer service was great (which earned them the second star!)  I will probably keep and wear this when all my other clothes are dirty and I need to do laundry. :P"
2.0,It clings to EVERYTHING!!! Love the style. The back is not as low as pictured. It’s a jersey material. Wish the back was lower and the style was more forgiving. I also wish it was longer. Great color and very soft!
2.0,Could have bought the same glasses by Foster Grant at Walmart. Disappointing
2.0,"The band itself seems to be nice, but it is way too big for my wrist and there is no way to adjust it."
2.0,Looks like the picture but very thin and small.
2.0,It didn't met my expectation.
2.0,I bought the maroon one and it is not as dark as pictured online. The pockets made me look like I have saddle bags and the dress was not flattering on me. I'm 5'5&#34; and the dress just touched the tops of my feet. Will be returning. Just not what I expected.
2.0,Cut small and material is not sweatshirt material.
2.0,Shoe is cute but too wide
2.0,very cheaply made; to be more specific too pricy for the quality.
2.0,Doesn't keep its shape and lost its color and shine first wear
2.0,Too small for a 2X unfortunately 😒
2.0,Painful to wear this because the metal edges are sharp.
2.0,"Poor quality and the fabric is slightly shiny, which was not what I was expecting. The materiel is what I would expect from inexpensive work out clothes"
2.0,"The medallion is fun, my son loves it!!  But the chain did not make it a full day before breaking.  I had to give him a random chain we had at home to use instead so that he could continue his pirate-ways."
2.0,"Not only does this feel cheap, but it looks cheap. Stretchy, plastic material. Feels like halloween costume material. So disappointed as I was excited for this. I actually bought two colors. Both are going back. :("
2.0,The fabric is somewhat lightweight but is absolutely not a waffle cotton spa robe
2.0,The material was to stretchy and didn’t allow for proper structure of the dress.
2.0,Embroidery isn’t actually on the shirt: they ironed/sewed on embroidery patches. That really should be more clear in the description. It looks nice from afar but I could tell right away that it wasn’t the real thing. Still giving it 2 stars because the fabric of the shirt is nice and thick for a white shirt.
2.0,They weee not mirrored at all!!
2.0,"i like the bathing suits itself, the bottoms aren't cheeky and the top covers everything but doesn't have any support, if you are looking for a bathing suit that is cupped D-DD I don't recommend this bathing suit."
2.0,Very cute and good value but fell apart too easily. Better have a glue gun or super glue on hand
2.0,Thick cotton and too long. More like summer dress than night gown.
2.0,"I ordered these shoes because they look so cute.<br />I am between 8.5-9, I ordered the 9 and they fit good.<br />But that was it. Once they are on, they don’t look cute or good anymore. They don’t have any shape, the feet look very weird.<br />They don’t have any padding, so definitely not for walking or long periods of standing up.<br />They look cheap. I am not using them to go out of the house. I use them to go gardening.<br />They were a no for me."
2.0,Small sizes
2.0,"I was super excited about getting g this pin for a dress, but it is completely the wrong color.  Not as described at all!  I was supposed to be a white flower, but as you can see it is grey.  I will be returning it.  It is a lovely flower though, well made and such, but not what I was wanting."
2.0,"Too large, no structure, like they're just there. No elastic or anything to hold them in place. One of the garter straps broke when I put it on, and they're made for tall women, because the garters basically hang off, because the closure doesn't extend enough for someone my height. I've never worn them, except to try this one on. There was no point in the other two, and wish I could have gotten my money back."
2.0,"Kinda low quality, the gem broke off very easily so not for everyday wear and tear"
2.0,The bottom is completely see through. The top has a liner but not the bottom. It is cute but can't wear it without spandex shorts.
2.0,"I ordered the green. Pretty color. Fabric as described. WAY TOO SMALL! Order at least 1 size up, maybe 2. No problem to return."
2.0,I didn’t really like this outfit
2.0,Tengo que pedir un size más pequeño. Pedí mi size y me quedo grande
2.0,Too small. I would still likd to return it even though its been a bit over a month.
2.0,Very small bag...
2.0,"I bought both the peach and olive. I have bought from this brand before, so I know what size to get. But this skirt probably runs two sizes too small. It’s very stretchy, which is nice, but the fit was so unflattering because it was so tight. I liked the olive better than the peach, but ultimately I ended up returning both."
2.0,Fit everywhere buy my chest.  I even did the measurements and still didn't fit properly.
2.0,"I wasn't surprised, given the price, but the gems were not even glued on evenly, making it that much easier for then to get knocked of. I gave it two stars because I ordered two necklaces and one is still intact, though I haven't worn it yet."
2.0,"These are very cozy. My landlords keep the temperature in my apartment at inhuman levels in the winter, so I am looking for full-body fleece options. These fit the bill. However! There is that hideous cat patch right on the upper thigh. Why?!! Why would you ruin these cozy leggings? It makes it so that it’s impossible to wear them out of the house, because that weird patch would show, even with a longer shirt on. Not that I was buying these to go out in public — but I’d like to at least have the option. These are going back. What a disappointment."
2.0,Just what I expected for the price
2.0,worth it for the money
2.0,"If you are a top heavy woman, do not buy this two piece. The top is extremely too small."
2.0,"After reading the reviews I ordered a size 7.5.  I received a size 6. This is a very small 6. Funny thing, the 6 isn't available to order. I cannot get her feet into the shoes at all. All of the shoes she wears right now are a size 6. Very cute design, love it, but we're sending them back."
2.0,Cheap but can’t complain for the price I probably won’t buy this again dog
2.0,Doesn't look like the photo. Very plain and thin
2.0,"The thing is so stretched out I had no idea how to even put it on! I figured it out and it just doest look right. I feel that if you have fake hard big boobs than youd like this but other than that, don't bother."
2.0,"I agree with many of the other reviews. This is a really cute collar, but I’m disappointed in the quality. One of the straps came off within minutes of taking it out of the bag so I was forced to remove the other strap. In addition, it’s very noticeable under thinner shirts if you are bigger busted as the line sits right across your chest."
2.0,Too boxy and square shaped. It made me look wider than I am. (I am a size 6/8). Returning it.
2.0,The shirt fit oddly on the arms. I returned it.
2.0,every single one of these broke in the first week of wearing them
2.0,"The clasp is an improvement over the other bands, but the tracker slips out. The tracker doesn't fit as snug which makes it prone to fall out of the band."
2.0,Button broke first time wearing
2.0,I have owned two of these for home pool use only. Recommend a swimmers physique to wear in public. Fits well and quick drying. Fairly priced. It's basically a Speedo style for a lower price. The negative is poor quality stitching. You will frequently be trimming off loose threads until it falls apart. Don't recommend.
2.0,Its a cute ring but broke in 2 pieces just after wearing it one time.
2.0,Colors were a little faded. Chain link was very weak ended up unhooking and getting lost while on a run. 😭
2.0,It was hilarious when I opened these- they are NOT like the picture at all- extremely stretchy and very firm fitting.  I wanted to get the look like in the photos and it’s just not possible with the material they’re made out of.
2.0,Sizing runs small. Length not portioned well to width. Actually returned as could not wear. Material was soft and workmanship quality good.
2.0,Way way too small for an adult
2.0,Hated the fabric. I'm done with stuff from China.  Was not flattering unless I pulled it up at the shoulders so it would hang properly.  Going back.
2.0,Much smaller than i could wear....gave it to a younger girl who cold fit it.
2.0,"I reviewed a few of these, that I returned due to size and thin fabric issues. I kept these because they fit well enough/slightly snut new. I washed them once, hung to dry. They have stretched to baggy and too big. So disappointed, GV used to be my go-to. They need to return to sturdier fabrics that will hold their shape."
2.0,"These are Chinese knockoffs of the Steve Madden Durba sandals  from 2005. I knew that and was fine with it when I purchased them. Unfortunately, the rhinestones are attached to chain mail, which isn't cushioned by any fabric so it's just scratchy, poky metal against your skin. Also, it straps around your ankle but there's nothing attaching the back of the sandals to your feet so they wear more like flip flops. Personally, I didn't feel safe walking in these. Between the metal against my skin and the way my foot slid around due to lack of support, it just felt like an accident waiting to happen.<br /><br />Beware trying to return them, though. I requested a return and because these are sold via third party, Amazon simply requests the third party to allow you to return them. The sellers used a fake email so within 30 seconds of putting in my return request I got an email from amazon saying something was wrong with the seller's email and a return request couldn't be sent to them. So I then had to file a claim with Amazon and luckily, they eventually refunded my money."
2.0,"I gave 2 stars because it is a shirt and it has all the shirt parts attached. But this shirt is advertised as soft, and it most certainly is not. The material is more rough than canvas and would be better off being cut up and turned into a bag.<br /><br /> All together it's an unforgiving piece of trash."
2.0,"Disappointed because I was under the impression that I was going to receive two shoe clips since most people have two shoes for two feet, but I only received one.  The rhinestones are an eye-catcher because I received a ton of complaints on my one shoe clip.  Another draw back, the gator is not easily cleaned once it losses its sparkle.  I placed it into jewelry cleaner and the silver or silver-like metal faded."
2.0,"Not the best quality material, the fit is a bit awkward and not as long as I had hoped."
2.0,One had the needle under the zipper poking out and unadjustable
2.0,"My sister (who wears size L) and her teenage daughter (normally size S) ordered those in two colors. They followed the manufacturer's measurements on the page and decided to order up one size, even though their regular size should've been fine according to the manufacturer's own sizing, because they didn't want the dresses too snug.<br />My sister ordered XL.<br />My niece ordered M.<br />This should've been plenty loose enough. Instead, the dresses arrived ridiculously small. They live abroad, so now they are stuck with dresses that are utterly unusable. VERY disappointing!"
2.0,Charms fell off after 3weeks
2.0,"Sleeves are skimpy and too short for an XXL  .  Your designs put too much emphasis on the ""bust"" when idt should be on the waist.  The overall shirt is too short....the xxL that I got just barely reached my side pockets. I would love to have several of these ""shirts""  they would be comfortable for me since I am in a wheel chair, but big stomach. ."
2.0,Very cheaply made. Not recommended for regular use
2.0,I am 5’8 and 135 pounds and ordered a medium.  For me I would have liked it longer.  The biggest issue was the waistline.  It fits oddly between the bust and the waist.  Not a flattering look for me.  Easy return.
2.0,Hang funny. Not flattering for big busted women. Kinda short too.
2.0,"I wear a size 9.5, all the reviews said order bigger since there are no half sizes. Got the 10 … couldn’t even get the shoe on! Returned it and got an 11 since I thought they were really cute,  they actually got delivered a month earlier than the estimated arrival date which was nice but still WAY too small. Would attempt another size but 11 is the highest the go. Really bummed because I still think these boots are so cute!! Hoping to find another pair similar to these to buy!"
2.0,cute shoes but run small.
2.0,"I originally purchased the XL according to the chest size chart but after trying it on it was too big and very loose for a compression shirt.  I ended up returning them and went down to a large size instead which fits well, however,  the material is very thin and just feels like a regular moisture wicking shirt with no compression. I do not feel like returning it again so I will keep these to use as regular workout shirts.  Bottom line is do not buy these shirts if you are looking for compression unless you purchase 2 or 3 sizes smaller than your normal size. The material is great quality but the description is a little misleading."
2.0,"Very nice, but upside down!"
2.0,The sizes are very very small
2.0,"The watch band looks pretty nice for a $10 product. However, the quality matches the price. The band started tearing after only about a month of daily wear. Also, the surface has started to erode in several places. I cannot recommend this to anyone, although I doubt that many other ""leather"" bands at this price point will fare better. Get a mesh or metal one instead if trying to do it on the cheap."
2.0,"I was really excited to get a white leather jacket after a good week of looking through different ones I chose this one.  However, I was significantly disappointed when it arrived only to find out the white jacket I was looking forward to there was no white jacket, but a beige."
2.0,This shirt is too small and tights
2.0,They're pretty and fit well.  But the soft and fuzzy inner lining made me too hot.  I had to turn them around after a while to cool down!
2.0,This band is overpriced for its quality. Probably can get it at much lower price on the &#34;bay&#34;. Its sort of stretches and feels very delicate. I dont believe it will last a long time. Also note that the buckle fitted to my item is not the one shown in the picture. Its the standard thin buckle...<br /><br />If the cost was brought down to about $2-$3 then it would be an ok value
2.0,"All the rings are the same size, and too big to be knuckle rings. Did not like it"
2.0,"(This is for the Classic cut. Why oh why, Amazon, do you allow sellers to bundle significantly different cuts/types of clothing under the same listing?)<br /><br />In short: I've paid way less for better quality from big box stores. They seem water resistant at the very least, hence 2 stars. Sending back for refund.<br /><br />Longer version: First impressions matter, the packaging does impress, I like the reusable bag, but when I can see lots of loose threads and fluff before I've even opened it I know I'm in for some 'fun'. For the most part, the outside just has bits of unattached loose threads, but inside the pockets as well as the seams inside the pants have a lot of attached loose hanging threads of varying lengths. They seem to run a bit large on the inseam, the 30 being more comparable to the 32 inseam jeans I have of varying brands. As well, I'm not sure if it's just the cut of the pants, being slightly too long, or if they are a defective pair, but the crotch gusset seems backwards to me. It certainly didn't help when I squatted down and immediately heard and felt at least one stitch pop. I was surprised to find that the Classic option has a d-ring (which isn't in the pictures), but why would you want it on the back of the pants? I certainly don't feel like sitting on my keys, or letting them hang where they're easier to grab.<br /><br />I did briefly test the water resistance by pouring a cup of water on the bottom of one of the pants legs, it ran right off, no spotting or other signs of shoddy or poor waterproofing, so kudos for that at least. No clue how durable it is though, so no comments on that."
2.0,El color no fue lo que esperaba 👎🏿 con relación a lo que mercadean
2.0,"Beautiful print, but TINY socks. And the second they stretch even the slightest (um, compression socks do that by definition), all you see is a wash of murky blue"
2.0,"It is not like the picture shows with contours and an interesting finish that various.  It is just plain looking shiny metal across the full surface with no gradation or change, it looks like it was just stamped from polished sheet metal.  It is also slightly smaller than a real 45 adapter, maybe the size of a quarter.  As a result I dont really wear it, it looks cheap."
2.0,No support and too low cut that your boobs fall out doing any activity
2.0,I’m pretty shoe but uncomfortable
2.0,The color was not what I expected.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this, but the gold was rose golden-gold. And it broke right after trying it on.<br />Disappointed & not worth sending back. Trial & error."
2.0,It is a bit small and so I cannot completely close the ring. But a great product!
2.0,Was WAY too small...like a boys fit...very disappointed
2.0,It seems like it is a great product so I put it on my mother in just in few days it changed color it looks AWFUL.  She ask if she could take it off I didn't respond.  I'm not even going to use the other ones.
2.0,"Another polyester shirt, pic looks like a tshirt type material."
2.0,"Order twice, both times not happy with the fit. Order large. Both time the jacket was to small."
2.0,"Just put on my dress...headed out to work when I noticed the arm was sewn together.<br /><br />The one sleeve is flat and perfect...the other was stitched incorrectly.  Obviously very poor attention to detail.  Wish I could return,  but I already pulled the tag off before noticing the problem"
2.0,"I was able to wear these pants 2 times, washed them and then they started to fall apart. The material essentially disintegrated."
2.0,It turned black .
2.0,soooo heavy
2.0,Impossible to iron all wrinkles out. Just creates new ones. Pretty in picture but if you don't like wrinkles them don't buy.
2.0,"Not as pictured on the model. Buttons go up further, thick material not very soft.  Wore it to work and it was ok but not what I expected."
2.0,Order a size up!! It’s a narrow shoe on top of having a pointy toe. The shoe had a gasoline odor to them. The velvet was nice but I’m definitely sending them back.
2.0,Dress pretty but way to tight in the bust area.
2.0,"Weird. Like it has potential on the right body type - tall & thin!<br />I’m 5’2, hourglass, 135 lbs & bought a small, which was kind of baggy but fit - but it was NOT flattering. Basically if you have any curves, it’ll add 15 lbs to you!"
2.0,Usually wear a large-ordered an xlarge and still too small
2.0,Definitely Tarnished badly right away. It’s too bad because it’s beautifully made.
2.0,"wide, stretched! we didn't like!"
2.0,"The band is very strange, and flips strangely when you move it around. there's no padding in the top. It's a simple set up though I'm 5'7 and it's just above my ankles. but overall not for me"
2.0,Runs small.  Order size up.
2.0,So I bought these thinking they were 925 sterling silver.  I read the description nowhere did it say they were coated.  So it turned my nose green and the coating stuck to the inside of my nose.
2.0,"Lenses are too big. I look like I have one of those 70's pair of glasses with the huge lenses on lol. Also, they don't fit snug against the face. They stick out a little. But for $12 I guess they are that bad."
2.0,"The tank top fit horribly. It hangs low in the front and gets lower the minute you exercise, all the while the back starts to ride up and by the time you are half way through a set your choking from the back while exposing your manly cleavage."
2.0,To small and I ordered xlg
2.0,Cloth not what I expected. Dress too small
2.0,Arrived with one stone not in the setting
2.0,"The quality of this product was okay but it was too big for my face,however as promised I got my refund.Good ppl to o business with."
2.0,"Like the previous reviewer, I prefer the Bibsters to these.  My daughter is 22 months old, average size, but the neck opening was too small for her.  Also, the sticky closure got caught in her hair.  Thin, flimsy material, but there is a pocket, and the back of the bib is lined in a waterproof-looking liner."
2.0,Did a decent job but tore up my card
2.0,The pants tore before I could even wear them. They were super comfy other than that.
2.0,"I got these for my 5yo for racquetball  (or rather hitting a ball in a racquetball room). At first he thought they were great. They fit fine. But he has fine hair & the single strap doesn't stay on his head. It falls down so when we put the strap up higher, it causes them to tilt, resulting in them digging in his face. If they had double straps (like goggles ), I think they'd be better. If anyone else has a remedy, please share!!<br /><br />Other than that, the quality of them is good, it's just that strap that's a problem."
2.0,"I haven't noticed a difference at all in my stress while using these glasses. They are cute, but the plastic moves around in the frames when I clean the lenses, and it feels like they will break at any moment."
2.0,"Item is as described! I couldn't be happier in that aspect; however, when the item arrived it smelled horrendous! It smelled like bad fish in a bag! I had to spray febreeze on it and let it air out on my patio... the stench is still there!"
2.0,True to picture details but cheaply made- the buttons do not stay closed so the leggings end up falling off within minutes:(
2.0,Ordered based off of other reviews... Not satisfied. Reviews said it had adjustable straps and it does not. Was way too big! I’m 5’7” with size 34 C bra size and they were too big.
2.0,The charms are so little that you cannot even see the figure.
2.0,"Had 2 pair snap on me within 2 weeks. Once in the frame, once in the ear support. No good."
2.0,"I'm sorry but this looks nothing like a man's watch. It's very pretty and I probably would've kept it for myself, but I need to buy a gift for my boyfriend. The photo of the man wearing the watch is misleading as it doesn't look that big on a man's wrist. I had my brother try it on and it just doesn't look right. The face is too small and the band is not thick enough to be considered masculine. I compared it to my actual 39 mm Micheal Kors watch and both the band and face are larger than this one. Disappointed"
2.0,The sizing is way off on this shirt. I wanted mine to be plenty big so I went with the xxl and it was more like a large. I could tell just taking it out of the package it was too small. The fabric is so soft. I ordered the white and it was not a bright white it was kind of dingy and looked like a under shirt quality. I will be sending it back.
2.0,This is not slouchy. It fits like a regular beanie and I have an average size head. However it is a nice thick material.
2.0,Was expecting an xl received a l.
2.0,I read the reviews before and should’ve paid attention. Material was sold so that striping was off. Very thin material. Had to send back
2.0,"I bought 2 other identical sets from Soly Hux in XL and they fit perfect, I ordered an XL in these but they are way too small. They won’t even pull up under my thighs super disappointed."
2.0,The color is really off. In my opinion it looks cheap.
2.0,"Was not white. Definitely more of a cream color. Nice sweater, but poorly advertised."
2.0,"Got here quick, but didn't seem to be the right size. I ordered 7/16&#34;, but it looked more like 1/2&#34;. It looks okay to good but I wish the bead had a gem in it, that would be perfect."
2.0,"I sent these back, not at good at the other iloveSIA leggings I have purchased in the past.  Their leggings with the color band on top are much more comfortable and stretchy."
2.0,"I've gone through 2 pairs of a specific pair of spy farrah sunglasses before I realized I could find replacement lenses. I'm really disappointed with this set and I'll probably just be ordering a whole new pair of glasses again. The color of the lenses is extremely transparent compared to the original lenses that came with the glasses. They were a very tight fit as well. I almost considered giving up on pressing them in, but kept trying and they did pop in finally. Lastly, I got about 3.5 months of use out of them before the chrome finish began to wear off."
2.0,Would not fit the 4010 Trans
2.0,The print on this shirt is very cute but the size is off. I ordered a xx and the material is stretchy so its not really big. It looks nothing like the picture in size. Its tight and not for tall people
2.0,"Very disappointed in this dressy pant suit.  Unless you are slim this is not flattering.  You cannot see this very well in the photos provided, but the jacket is made of two fabrics.  Unfortunately this causes the jacket to not hang very well.  The lower section of the jacket puffs out at your hips.<br /><br />The colors of the pant suit are very pretty.<br /><br />I returned the pant suit via the return shipping label provided by Amazon.  Over a week later and I still have not received a credit to my account."
2.0,"Even the strongest band is hardly any resistance. I gave 2 stars because I ended up putting all 3 bands on and felt something, so all 3 at once does the job."
2.0,i absolutely do not recommend these skirts at all
2.0,The watch is nice but a bit big and bulky for my taste
2.0,"Shipped from China, took about a month, waaaaaaay too big."
2.0,"The glasses look very nice but are way too small, it’s almost like the frames are for a child’s head or something. I’ve never had a pair of shades that didn’t fit me."
2.0,Ran small and hangs strangely...the shoulders keep &#34;riding up&#34; which is annoying. Something weird with the elastic in the shoulders. Sent back.
2.0,"The color on these don't last long, within a week of use the film of iridescent is pealing off. :("
2.0,A little too big but I will use them. Not as good quality as other sleeves I've purchased
2.0,i was so excited to get them and they fit well thru legs and hips but super large for my waist ..so disappointed it says to size up but if you have wide hips and a tiny waist they dont fit and there was no hole for the button
2.0,Watches came with empty batteries. Just returned it.
2.0,"Update :I had to remove a star due to the seller choosing to ignore my question about return shipping costs. My first contact with the seller was as expected:I asked for a return and refund and they responded. However when I tried to contact the seller a 2nd time to ask about their return policy which does NOT include shipping charges they never responded. I simply asked a question to which I expected an answer  &#34;no, return shipping is not included&#34;.<br />. **Original review**<br />&#34;The material is soft and very comfortable. The zipper is ok for the low price. Sadly I found the look of these bras very deceiving. They look like they'd offer a lot of support and that the fabric would fit tight against your skin. (referring to the add photo of the model wearing the nude color shade bra) Maybe it's just the material for the shade that I ordered that differs from the others I saw in customer reviews. I'm just not sure. I ordered a size Medium hoping that the smaller size would provide more support by fitting tightly around my ribcage and holding me in nice and tight. My regular bra size is a 32-34G. Ordering a size Medium in similar style sports bras has always worked for me because the fabric fitting very tightly around my ribcage/the bottom/band area holds everything in. The only reason it didn't work out this time is that there is just too much give/stretch in the material. The cups don't hold their shape so the rounded, circular shaped foam inserts just float around and they don't lay flat..they looked very bumpy and don't smooth out.(see the first photo I included) I would not have been able to wear this under a t-shirt without looking like I had lumps under my clothing. Other similar bras include the triangle shaped foam inserts which look much more natural and they're very smooth. The 2nd photo I included shows the back of the bra for which the bottom band area is very loose and just has way too much give. I really wanted this to work out."
2.0,"Unfortunately, the wonderful cushioning only lasts about a day or two, and then it is very flat providing very little padding and comfort."
2.0,They don't make any difference in glare.
2.0,It looks like it's a blouse material but  it's more of a cloth static material that really clings to the body no matter what you do. I wouldn't recommend it
2.0,"When I got it, it just seemed like a tacky print. I ended up giving it to goodwill."
2.0,Way too small. I was sad.
2.0,"It doesn't fit that well.... It is see through and hugs the hips. If you have an hourglass shape, it sits on your hips, and makes you look fat."
2.0,material is extremely cheap
2.0,"The cosplay came in excellent condition, but when it arrived it was about a year late and was far too small. I ordered in a medium, like I do everything, but the only thing i could get on properly was the arm warmers(most likely the belt-type accessory and tie, but I didnt try because I couldn't get the skirt, shirt, or thigh highs more than halfway on/zipped). The wig also came in lovely condition, but I'm very dissapointed with the rest of the cosplay"
2.0,Cute design but the clamps broke after one day of wearing but not worth the price I paid but hey it's the holidays a time to waste money we all really don't have to waste
2.0,"Really liked the leggings, wish they were a bit more compressing but they are very comfortable. I unfortunately had a small hole in mine."
2.0,"Not what I expected. I thought I was getting 100% polyester, but these shirts are not ""silky' like the same brand shirts I bought last year."
2.0,"I really, really liked these shoes when I got them until this morning when a decorative tab on the back broke off. I'm quite disappointed as these shoes looked nice."
2.0,The unisex in the title should have clued me in that these would not fit my foot. I purchased them only because of the free returns.
2.0,"I wanted a better red, this tinge is like blood orange. Although acceptional"
2.0,This product is very cheap poor materials were used to makes these pants.
2.0,These are not the highest quality. They make my ears itch and are not very comfortable. Kinda disappointed.
2.0,I wear an ex large in pants and this was more like a 2x. Too big and too long
2.0,"I had such high hopes for this comfy looking summer dress, but alas. Yet another sizing issue from China. Decent quality, particularly for a summer dress, but the measurements were so far off it was terrible. I ordered my size and the bodice was too tight, torso too short and the skirt rode up....it was awful. As a seamstress I can only hope they accurately measure their items in the future because I will not buy from them again."
2.0,"cheaper and flimsier than I thought, but I guess I should have suspected as such for the price"
2.0,"Not as described. Out of package, found long loose thread from edge not sewn properly."
2.0,Quality was not there. Stitching. Very little spandex for support.
2.0,Does not reduce night driving headlight glare.
2.0,For the price I paid I expected it to cone with more stuff ...all it had in it was a jacket no skirt
2.0,"I'm not impressed with these. They are really bulky and not the look I was going for. Maybe these would be good for a man because when they came in the package they looked shiny and nice, but they don't look good on. They are hard to talk in too."
2.0,"This is a &#34;good news&#34; &#34;bad news&#34; type of review. The good news is that they hold your glasses from slipping and work great. The bad news is that after you put them on your eye glasses ear piece, they only last for about a week before the plastic separates at its seam and falls off and becomes useless."
2.0,Cheap fabric and no lift at all whatsoever. The bra isn’t comfortable either and lints very easily after one wash.
2.0,Bracelets were super tight.
2.0,"I ordered one of these leggings and they are by far my favorite. But when I came back to order the other colors in the same size, I got a completely different brand. Different material and fit too.<br /><br />I’m scared to order these again because of how disappointed I was with the other versions."
2.0,Very cute but a seam ripped after wearing for only a few hours
2.0,"Loved the design but when I tried to put it on, the buttons just don’t fit into the hole. It would cost me 3 times more to get them<br />Corrected. And worst part I didn’t even get the belt! So disappointed"
2.0,Fabric very sister comfortable lose fitting not very stylish could be considered grandma style
2.0,"The item was also very wrinkled upon delivery.  More care with packaging would have been appreciated.  Highlight the material that the dress is made out of.  The picture of the dress on amazon.com is beautiful, but when I receive the dressed I was disappointed.  I expected better quality.  Hopefully my next items will arrive in better condition."
2.0,Too fussy.
2.0,"Ran way too small, too tight.  Disappointing."
2.0,To. Big
2.0,Very small for size 10.  I used for gift for a smaller child
2.0,"The pin was actually smaller than I expected (it was measured in Millimeters {shame on me for not knowing})<br /> The wing on the Angel was bent forward and I am not sure I should bend it back. . .<br />I expected to get free shipping because I am an Amazon Prime member, but because the product is not an<br />Amazon product (even though it is sold on Amazon) I was not eligible. . ."
2.0,Thought it would be a little thicker.  Wasn't what I expected.
2.0,Returning not happy.. Bought in different sizes.
2.0,Fabric was thin.  May not hold up to more than one washing.
2.0,"Not a sweatshirt. This is a cute shirt. No hems; just cut, some kind of finish but not sewn hems? Runs smaller than implied. No drying instructions; assume no dryer…?"
2.0,Material is too thick for my liking. Winter dress.
2.0,"No padding or support whatsoever! My two year old told me I looked like “ballet class” from seeing his sisters in black leotards. It does have a look of a leotard. Not great material, not lined, ok coverage. Wouldn’t buy again, but will keep it for a season."
2.0,"The dress is very pretty; however, this particular one I bought in large (bought the blue in medium and love it) and the bottom layer sticks out too far down as if it was sewn incorrectly. I sent it back but keep the blue."
2.0,Not really like the picture like I want my money back
2.0,"Twice now, I have received a white shirt with a yellow stain on the back of it!! Gross. They look and fit beautifully but had to return too many times."
2.0,Great looking watch for the price but I've ordered it twice now and received a black leather band instead of the advertised brown one. I kept one of the black watches because it was so sharp but am a little disappointed as I was hoping for the brown band.  Hopefully whoever fulfills this corrects the issue soon.
2.0,My Pom poms fell off already!! I've had them for four days. Fit is snug.
2.0,Ii was a tshirt not a crop.
2.0,"Looks like a night gown, not sexy at all."
2.0,I used to get XL until I lost weight and started to get L. I haven't ordered shirts in 6 months or so but this L shirt fits like I was wearing an XL.
2.0,"Nice material, but runs really small.  Says to buy your regular size but for 36C had to buy extra large not large as indicated.  Zippers really difficult and flimsy.  Too bad, nice looking tops."
2.0,Shorts are cute and fit but the top just didn't fit at all.
2.0,I ordered the “Mama” shirt but I received a “Mamaw” shirt. I’m sad because it actually is really cute.
2.0,"The fabric is really poor quality and stains easily. I’ve never had sweatshirts stain this easily before in my life. I don’t understand how they can be so terrible. Also, the elastic around the wrists and the waist gets stretched out within a few wears. Just super cheaply made"
2.0,"I love the look of the belt.  It definitely runs large, so order a size down.  However after only a couple of months I have noticed that the black is rubbing of the belt in spots.  Not worth the money and won't buy again.  My normal problem with belts is they separate after awhile, usually more than a year.  This was unexpected..."
2.0,"They were very tight and started to cut off circulation, the teal looked more of a green, and one broke after using it for about 3 minutes"
2.0,"No room in the package area, git good in thighs and butt though.  Thick material like sweatpants. Look cool. Terrible service if you have to return,  been waiting for a refund and was told it would be 2-3 weeks, possibly longer due to covid."
2.0,It’s too thin!
2.0,Not meant fe heavy cheated woman this dosnt give a firm hold
2.0,Love the color but its a weird shape kind of squarish and runs really big. I plan on washing it on hot drying on high tontry to shrink it a bit. If that diesnt.work its turning into a night shirt beacause of the unflattering square box shape that it is.
2.0,too large for short waisted folks
2.0,Much smaller than I hoped for.
2.0,"Website Ad has three different dimensions.  The title states Mini 21""; the narrative states 21.5 inches and the specifications at the end states 9x22x14 inches.<br />For some this might not be an issue.<br />However, I specifically purchased this pricer item to fit length wise inside the boot of a R129 Mercedes SL.<br />FYI, my 21"" search term and the header result in a bag that fits and the 22"" may be oversize.<br />If it does fit I will likely purchase a second bag.<br />If it does fit not because of the websites inaccurate product information- you know.<br /><br />Stars are for the webpage not for the eTech Mother Lode 21"" Wheeled . . ."
2.0,"Material was good! Although I kept having to pull them up. They slid down bad. And the ankle part was huge, I had to roll them up into capris."
2.0,"Very loose. Not tight enough,"
2.0,The shoes are hard and very uncomfortable...cheaply made.
2.0,Soft and comfortable until you wear them. 15 mo.
2.0,"Sooooo much smaller.... It’s quite obvious that these are not the same size in the photo. But they were less than $2. Infact, I paid more for shipping than the item itself. So I won’t be returning because then I’d have to pay shipping again! But they do have the same sort of look I guess. If you can get past the fact that the “gems” have a rainbow shimmer effect with the black stones and the ones I received have more of a gold shimmer effect. I doubt I will wear these just because they are so much smaller than what I normally wear. They also are super cheap metal. The hinges are wonky and are difficult to open and close. But I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,waist goes to high for me and it still smells like plastic
2.0,Zipper is already getting stuck. Was much smaller than advertised
2.0,"Band looks great and installs easily, however the clasp does not hold very securely and occasionally opens unexpectedly. would not rebuy this item,"
2.0,Es mas chica la talla
2.0,"Would have rated 5 stars if I actually received both of them, but only one came in the package."
2.0,"The lenses are polarized, however they are very thinner than the original lenses. Also the color that is shown in the picture is green, which is the color I wanted however the color of the lenses that I have received is brown. Also the lenses come out of the frame frequently. I think I will return the lenses"
2.0,Pretty color but too small. I ordered up two sizes from what I normally wear
2.0,Not quite the desired results.  If the sun does not hit your ball ...it's not going to come out with theses glasses.  And anything that reflects the sun - even leaves- will glow so you find yourself taking them off and on alot
2.0,Ordered a size large and it was like a kids shirt.. no way was it adult sized.
2.0,Some really unique and cool designs. Wouldn’t buy from a company selling Trump propaganda though 😒
2.0,My 14 year old son normally wears a men’s small in sweatshirts and they are big. He weighs 130 pounds. So we ordered a size large and it is too small. Returning this item
2.0,This is more of a jersey material than sweater material which is what I thought.
2.0,"Very cute, but way too small. I can wear it as a top but not a dress like advertised."
2.0,The very 1st time I unsnapped them 2 broke
2.0,"The material is cheap, the dress looks just like the picture but the material is cheap. :/"
2.0,Pearl's fell off bows in first day
2.0,Everything about this is great....except the color is already fading.  My 2-3 year old cobalt blue cushions have held their color perfect!  This umbrella has not.  I am super disappointed.
2.0,"The material was see through. The part that covers the breasts for my personally was too short . One wrong move and I would have definitely put on a show . The length of the shirt was good , no complaints there . I’m a 38 DD and ordered a large ."
2.0,"After a few washes, the inner stitching along the waist has already come undone by 10 inches. I cut off the loose threads but it will probably unwind more over time. Not sure if I got a bad batch or all of them are like this"
2.0,"Okay, this is not what I expected. It gives no shape and seems to be a waste instead of a waist. Going to have to try another brand. Sizing seems small as well, and yes I measured."
2.0,"This watch isn't comfortable to me, it's bulky. The light button broke on the second week; which was disappointing. And I thought it would last longer. = Waste Disposal."
2.0,The rings are very pretty but I felt they were a little too clunky looking on my finger. I had hoped they would be thinner and more delicate as they are meant to be stack rings. Even as a single ring they are too thick.
2.0,I wanted to love these but they hurt.  The plastic band that goes across your foot to hold the shoe on is placed to forward.  It is painful to walk in these I couldn’t imagine going a whole days wearing these. Torture!
2.0,The threads came out after 1-2 months of wearing.<br />Not made that well.
2.0,It feels cheap and it looks cheap
2.0,"The ""rope"" literally disintegrated."
2.0,Someone out there will see this ring and think wow that would look great downstairs. Let me tell you it doesn’t. The gems are way too big. Now when it comes to belly button it’s not durable enough to handle the constant motion of your abdomen. Just don’t it’s a waste of money. No offense to the seller because I know they aren’t the ones who made and designed it.
2.0,"Like: color, doesn't stick to my lipstick.<br />Dislike: hard to breathe in. I had to replace it about 30 minutes after I put it on."
2.0,"Im small 5' 5"" ballerina figure with a long torso. This dress barely covered my butt cheeks. Its so short it could be a shirt!"
2.0,"The item looks like the picture but is made with cheap fabric......I will not wear it out, just around the house.  I wish someone could start making clothes again that include cotton!!!  instead of cheap synthetic crap.  I would not buy again."
2.0,"Pieces fall off all the time, only like 2 charms are left on it"
2.0,"The skirt didn't fit as expected, I would have had to order up a size and a half to get it to properly fit. I did love the fabric and style of the skirt which is why I gave it 2 stars."
2.0,"From the outside there is nothing much wrong, other then the fact the shorts look too small. But as soon as I took them off after 2 or so minutes of uncomfortable tightness I noticed a loose thread. well that normal, to sometimes see a loose thread. but in this case it wasn't just loose but just a mess.<br />On both sides the zipper pockets have messy hemming, and on both the top and the bottom of the zipper area is just exposed with the corners poking out.<br />The single rear pocket has the normal and expected amount of just the tiniest unconnected thread from manufacturing. With the all the remaining hemming being just fine as expected of a new product.<br /><br />With the negative out of the way, the color is somewhere between a burgundy and maroon, leaning a bit more on the burgundy side. The drawstring have nice hard plastic rings around the opening, that prevent wear on both the opening and the drawstring itself. The elastic band has a good amount of give to it, but pulls a bit tight.<br />Now for the most outstanding feature of the shorts in my opinion... The Left and Right zipper pockets. They are just so nice looking. both zippers have a cover that is hard to open when shut by the zipper. yet almost in a contradiction, the zipper is easy to pull both up and down. It's quite impressive if you have never had anything like it before.<br /><br />Overall I find myself disappointed in the small size, very tight fit and annoyed by the extremely messy hemming that if tugged on slightly will continue to unravel. These shorts are labeled as XXL, and my waist is 45.5"" which is on the larger end of the XXL size chart. I would recommend trying to get a size larger then you expect with this product, unless you really like a squeeze fit. Given the reasonable consistency with the hemming on every other area of the shorts, I do not expect that this messy of hemming to be a standard thing in every pair sold. Most likely, and hopefully this was just a dud pair sent to me for review."
2.0,Not enough sewing securing the chains-- you'll have to redo them or they'll all fall off while you're wearing it.
2.0,The product was too small. I normally wear a 2x and purchased a 3x and it didn't fit.
2.0,"This dress fits ok in waist and shoulders, however the fabric is rather thin. Also, there are a couple of issues with the form of the dress, one on my hip where the dress suddenly does not follow the curve and another one on my rear end, the same issue. I am still debating whether to return it, or to try to fix it by slightly pressing it with iron. The dress looks better in the picture.<br /><br />Update... wore the dress once and the material has already started fraying, which is unacceptable. I just downgraded my initial review to two starts due to poor quality and craftsmanship. Beautiful navy color though."
2.0,"Don't go by the size guide its way off, this runs very small"
2.0,It had dirt stain on one of the onesis but still ok
2.0,Did not realize they were backless and they were way too large.  I am upset that it cost more to return this item than it cost to begin with. What a rip off.
2.0,To big and didn't like the material. I need a code to send back (refund)
2.0,"Because if the way it folds, it doesn't hold much. After in card and some cash on the other side, you can hardly squeeze the thing together to keep it shut."
2.0,These are not limo tinted. More like hyundai factory tint.
2.0,The color was not as bright as the picture showed.
2.0,These were much bigger in person than pictures. Also the fringe shred
2.0,it is a gift for my nephew<br />I think the fabric is not soft and tender enough to kids<br />I will never buy again<br />it still looks good honestly
2.0,Over-sized.
2.0,"These are not 20 gauge, they are 22. I received them ahead of time, which is the only reason I have rated it better than one star. I cannot use them."
2.0,very flimsy...would not order again
2.0,"Really really loved this cover up until I washed it (gentle cycle, cold water). The strings on the bottom we're completely tangled and frayed after :( bummer."
2.0,The arch on this is way too high for me and It’s uncomfortable for me to wear. My arches are fine it’s my big feet that’s the issue. Back they go!
2.0,Not what it looks like.  It doesn't slouch at all.  Blah!
2.0,I gave this 2 stars because of the way they fit and the seam opened in the back resulting in a hole after wearing them twice. These pants are for flat booties only. The way they are sewn doesn't give any room for an average size bottom. They are a lightweight sweatpant which I liked but the fit was weird.
2.0,"The earrings are clip on. The glasses are really dark.  I couldn’t wear them inside because I could barely see out of them. In fact, even outside in the sun was difficult to see with them on.  The necklace is ok, but for the price, considering the other 2 items were unwearable, it’s not worth it.  Plus the materials are cheap.  When adjusting the glasses to fit correctly, I was afraid I’d bend 5he frames too much and break them."
2.0,I look sloppy in it.
2.0,"Fit close to as described however these leggingns were like tights when I put them on, so I returned them. I could see through these from the knee up."
2.0,"Purchased for my son, this is his review:<br />“First pair order received had the wrong size shoe with the correct size packaging/hanger. Initial fit with the reordered correct size was disappointing. These shoes are unbelievably narrow and the straps are very tight. I’ve had a few pairs of flip flops that required break-in (leather rainbows) so I’m pushing through this initial wear-in despite strap abrasions. Despite all this, these shoes are very light and the soles are minimal which is what I’ve been looking for. So, we’ll see.”"
2.0,Material way too cheap not what I expected and too long
2.0,"These sock are very thin, not at all what I was looking for. The reviews lead me to believe the sock had more foot padding, it does not. Quality is good and its a tall sock."
2.0,Didn't come all the way up to waist
2.0,I was on the look out for a new pair of sunglasses and was super excited when I seen these. I wanted something out of my norm and these caught my eye right away! Was very disappointed when I received them. They fit great but they are very cheaply made! The gold bar across the top of the shades are plastic and it looks like the gold paint has already started to chip off. I think the case they came in cost more then the sunglasses themselves. I received this product at a discounted price.
2.0,Ordered a 2xl and it is much closer to a large.
2.0,"Took over a month and a half to get in the mail. Good quality, wrong size."
2.0,I really wanted this a compression shirt for it's theraputic value but this is really nothing more than a long sleeved excercise shirt.
2.0,Cute but yellowish in color instead of cream or white
2.0,"These are so cute, but they start to unravel after one wash. Only 1 or 2 pairs didn’t, so I would caution you about putting them in the dryer or just know they won’t last long if you do."
2.0,poor quality on the top. I do like the bottoms though
2.0,"A lot narrower than pictured, if you like narrow ties you will be happy."
2.0,Good quality But way to small. Too short on the legs.
2.0,I would not buy these again. Look nice but they leak badly.
2.0,Shrank after washed
2.0,Dry thin material tore and shrunk on first wash-chunked in trash!
2.0,very see through. I am 5'2 125lbs I ordered a small and unfortunately any arm movement will rise the dress expose my butt. ;(
2.0,"The shape of the sunglasses is great, it's huge but that's what I was looking for. However, the description says it's got polarized lens but it does not seem to be."
2.0,Product looks great on model but in person it looks more like a short robe.
2.0,"I'm not fond of the fabric,  it is very stiff and feels cheap.  It wrinkles easily,  and has no stretch."
2.0,Just doesn't fit right. Not to sure about fabric.
2.0,I was under the impression it was going to be a thicker material than it was. Would be fine would a day outside in the shade but not out in full sun in the pool or beach
2.0,"This gym bag is not sturdy.  The issue I have is with the shoe compartment.  It is a great idea, a separate compartment where your clothes don't get whatever slime is on your shoes on them.  It worked for about a half dozen visits.  Then, the thin nylon that comprises the wall of the shoe compartment separated from the edge of the bag.  Now the shoe compartment and the rest of the bag are one and the same, cohabiting.  That defeats the purpose.  Now, I am back to shoving my shoes in plastic grocery bag again.  The rest of the bag is okay, for now."
2.0,"bought for dad. material was very thin and cheap and i doubt the potholders will do anything but burn. so, -3 stars for the 3 bad products."
2.0,"If you have short arms this might look good. I'm 5'9&#34; and the sleeves are way too short before even bending my arms. The sleeve measurement they show is correct from shoulder to cuff, however the underside measurement is like 16&#34;. It's a pretty coat but if you have long arms forget about it."
2.0,This will be return #3 because the charger either doesn't work or breaks.<br />This came out of the charging port on 2 out of 3 hats
2.0,"It shed all over my sons clothes, face and even got in his mouth. Don’t waist your money."
2.0,Poor fabric quality. Will not wear alone as pants. Will use as tights.
2.0,The material stretched out causing this hat to become large. I would like it to be a bit smaller.
2.0,"Watch itself is nice but the digital seconds are faster than the seconds hand. So even when you sync them you keep having to re-sync often cause one is faster than the other. All in all, I wish I could get my money back."
2.0,No way a kid would wear this for more than 5 minutes. Scratchy and unlined.<br />Very uncomfortable.
2.0,Didn't realize how small these ties actually are they also stain really easily.
2.0,It changed colour the same day
2.0,"Looks nice but it's heavy and pulls on my wrist hairs, and that hurts. Never have I had any type of bracelet or wrist strap or band do that."
2.0,"Overall this seemed like a well made bra, and I was excited because it’s one of the few higher-impact bras I’ve found where you don’t have to dislocate your shoulders to pull over your head!  Putting it on and taking it off is the only good thing about this bra.  Everything else was not great.<br /><br />The design is not very practical. The vertical straps sit right on top of my shoulder blades, and rub very awkwardly over the pointy part of my shoulder blades when I move my arms. As this is a sports bra, it should be comfortable to actually move in.  I wore it for a minute, and knew the straps on my shoulder blades would drive me nuts, luckily it was very easy to take off! And easy to return for a refund!<br /><br />I tried wearing it cross-back, but the straps were WAY too short for this, I couldn’t even get it on with the straps crossed.  I’m 5’7”, size 36DDD in Wacoal, 32G or 32H in Freya (Bc bra sizing is so inconsistent!) and I ordered size Large D-F.  The cup size was very small compared to the band size, I knew it would be a bit small but I was spilling out everywhere. It fit like a 32C or D.  The actual band was pretty narrow, so even though it was very tight on the loosest hook, (my underbust/ribs measure 32”) it still felt like the band would ride up.<br /><br />Overall this would be fine for someone smaller chested, but any sports bra is fine for people with smaller chests.  Definitely not good for people with small bands and larger cup sizes :("
2.0,They were ok but the Eye site was off when I got them.
2.0,"Both my best friend and I loved these bracelets, but the very first day of putting them on they were already falling apart.  After a few days of wearing her bracelet it completely broke and now I'll be buying a new set but from a different company.  It was a cute idea but I'm sure a dollar store bracelet would've lasted longer than these."
2.0,"These socks are tiny and they stretch out super thin to even get around your foot. I've had these for over a year and they are falling apart badly. The patterns look nice, but you really get what you pay for."
2.0,"While it is soft and comfy, it is unflattering. I bought a size up which made it look dumpy, but if I went with my regular size it would have shown every imperfection of my stomach.  The material is the clingy kind and not to my liking!  It is also too long for my height. Have to return unfortunately because I love the color!"
2.0,"Cute, but could not zip past my rib cage."
2.0,"I ordered 2 outfits for my son, both were size 6-9months.  One in white and one in green.  The pants and shirts were both obviously different in size (pic attached) even though they were labeled the same size.  The bigger one looked wrinkled and used and had a light green stain on the front of it.  Returning the white one (One star) The green shirt is nice but the massive white patch sewn on the front of the pants is tacky so I’ll pair the shirt with a different pants. (3 stars)"
2.0,"Lovely dress, but the arm holes were too small."
2.0,This band is clearly made for a kids watch but is an adult size. My son has a really hard time getting it on every morning
2.0,"BEWARE!<br />the product description says this shirt &#34;runs small&#34; so it would be wise to order a size up.  i normally wear a 1X (i'm very tall and need it for sleeve/shirt length as well as girth) so i decided to go TWO sizes up...  and i can't even get the front plackets together across my chest, let alone *button* them.<br />in the same order, but from a different company, i ordered [[ASIN:B018I887MS another plaid flannel shirt]], also in a 3X to be safe, and it fits just fine... even just a touch big!<br />so, when they say these shirts run small, believe them!"
2.0,For a young girl this does not cover enough of the chest area runs small
2.0,Not compression just plain old tank tops won't buy again
2.0,Didn't like it at all nothing like the discretion
2.0,Wore and washed this sweatshirt twice in cold water. Noticed after second wash that the design is bleeding into the fabric. Will be returning.
2.0,"While it is very cute, the top is tiny and I couldn't wear it. Wish you could buy them as separates."
2.0,"So the strings on this thing are terrible!!! Its a super cute cover up, but do not get it wet!!! I did go to the beach so maybe it was the salt, but the strings just fell apart and wrapped all over my legs. It was pretty annoying. Its a little boxy too, like my booty didn't stay very covered. I'm about a size 12 and 5' so that was disappointing. But it was comfortable and cute so I gave it 2 stars. Plus it came with a cute necklace."
2.0,A lot larger than I anticipated. I will have to order a different wallet.
2.0,"The sandals are very cute and looked great on photo.<br />Once received, my daughter loves them it... the size was off! She’s currently size 13, they fit so loose maybe order a size smaller<br /><br />The front part started to rip after 2 days!!<br />Grrrrr..."
2.0,Put them up for her lil sister.
2.0,This product was not assembled properly. The two sides are not aligned correctly. Also the lock does not work. It comes apart a lot even with just a small move of my wrist.
2.0,Crap.  I have had this wallet less than 2 months and the stitching is already unraveling on the left side card pockets.
2.0,"Fabric is pretty, took 6 weeks to arrive, sleeves are really short. If you button the sleeves, they're very snug."
2.0,One section of the crown was missing / broken.
2.0,"Dissapointed to find that there were no pockets or compartments inside the bag for a cell phone, erc.."
2.0,"While this pullover is warm, it runs really small. Originally ordered a 1x for my daughter. Wouldn’t fit her but it does fit me and I wear a medium. So essentially you’d need to order about 3 sizes up."
2.0,"The size is smaller than ideal for me (from top to bottom is approx. the length of a nickel) but that is my fault for not reading the dimensions properly. My unsatsfaction stems from on the site it looks as though the mother has hair, the piece I received looks more like a father and child than a mother and child."
2.0,"Very Plastic Feeling. Not what I expected,. but did the job.  The pants are longer than I expected.<br /><br />But for the price.  It Ok."
2.0,Not the quality of product I was hoping for.
2.0,"The earrings are pretty ugly, not shiny like the picture depicts.  They are OK costume jewelery for the 50% of price but they would have gone right back if I had paid full price."
2.0,"It's weird, the dress fits great but the shoulders we're to wide. The fabric sucks it looks incomplete."
2.0,Looked nothing like the picture.
2.0,"Good thing is the Velcro and color, but the show does not retain shape and looks bulky. It not comfortable fit though the size is correct. Not good for the price"
2.0,"They were too small. Unfortunately, I'll have to return them."
2.0,I only wear one out of 3 of these. The V and square neck ones go down way too low. Didn't want to bother trying to return them. The material is kind of hard and not stretchy so not very comfortable.
2.0,I bought this dress thinking it would be a loose flowy dress. It was not. It also a very cheap polyester material. I was not happy with my order. I returned it the next day
2.0,"These shorts fit good, look good, and are very comfortable; durability is another issue. After just one wash, one of the front seams came out, and the second seam is very loose and ready to fall out."
2.0,I am 5’4 bra is a C . I got a medium and it’s huge
2.0,"Quality is good, but order at least 2 sizes higher than your regular. Unfortunately my regular is 3XL so I can't and I have to pay a return shipping fee."
2.0,Just a regular umbrella.  Not the size of a golf umbrella.
2.0,"it is not soft , very narrow and small but you get what you pay for , nothing but cheap"
2.0,I wear a men's 11-12 and I would say I have fairly large claves.  I ordered the large which according to the size guide was perfect for my feet. However these socks were not very tight on any part except the top hem around my calves. They basically fit like dress socks.<br /><br />If you're looking for compression socks for recovery or travel I'd suggest a different vendor.
2.0,This shoe fit very loosey goosey.  I tried it on but never wore it outside the house.  It was not flattering and there were many gaps that appeared awkward. Returned
2.0,Never worked but looks cool . I found some ironic charm in the watch’s failure to track time.
2.0,Got these for band practice and playing shows. My ears were ringing after the first night of using them... It made me really sad. Defiantly cute and comfortable just not as effective as I need.
2.0,"I'm not a fan of this....wayyy to big first off. I usually wear a large so that's the size I got...it engulfs me. And the materials is not soft at all. almost like a costume piece.<br />I tried washing and drying it to see if it was shrink and become softer. It did not,."
2.0,Material is poor quality. Size up if you get it.
2.0,Quality was not what I was expecting.  It appears very cheap and I do not wear it.
2.0,"EVERY TIME I'VE TRIED TO WEAR THIS WITH MY FITBIT BLAZE IT FALLS APART AS THE PINS ARE NOT HOLDING IT TO THE FITBIT.  VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE QUALITY AS IT LOOKS GREAT, BUT NOT MUCH USE IF YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LOSING YOUR FITBIT EVERY TIME YOU WEAR IT!"
2.0,"Dress is pretty cute, but it is incredibly sheer and the fabric is uber thin...haven't worn it yet, not a slip fan."
2.0,"Do not buy this shirt. Yes, I understand it's a cheap buy, but it is also a fairly cheap material. No matter how well or long you iron it, it will always be a wrinkled mess. There are many other brands and shirts that you can buy for a good price on here that are of a much better quality."
2.0,The earring is larger than a silver dollar.
2.0,"Would not recommend. Looks nothing like the picture. Poorly stitched.  Not suitable for working out nor running errands .<br /><br />The material was very soft though. Perfect if you’d like cute , kinda baggy,  pajamas."
2.0,Wanted to love this with cowboy boots but the chest is so tight. It really just fits weird all around.
2.0,The garment came with a strong smell. Wished prior to trying following the provided instructions and the dress shrunk.
2.0,"These were so cute and my granddaughter was so excited to put it on . Well that didn't last long , they fell apart . Sad thing was I bought 2 and bothe fell apart"
2.0,The embroidery sticks out and doesn't look like the picture
2.0,Pros: comfortable<br /><br />Cons: cheap quality. Already split seam within first week. Seems like so much cheap crap coming from China being aold on Amazon now!!
2.0,This material is so thin and shows your undergarments. Too cheap looking for the cost of this product. Should have been lined. Disappointing!
2.0,"It's a nice skirt but the sizes are horrid. I wear a medium in things made here. Knowing overseas sizes run small, I ordered an extra large. Still way too small."
2.0,"Pros: cheap, size is great for costumes<br />Cons: arrived broken<br />You get what you pay for, cheap plastic. Luckily, mine is for a cosplay, so I need to duck tape it anyway. It's ok, I just would've been happier with a product still in one piece."
2.0,Costume was cute but came in damaged.
2.0,"Very pretty, but cheaply made....the bling charms you attach  to the purse are made of an aluminum type metal that broke as soon as I put it on."
2.0,"Although these bands are cheap, I would not recommend them since they are much narrower than the Apple solo loop bands and look ridiculous on the larger 44mm watch"
2.0,I bought this shirt originally in a sport store and it APPEARS to be the exact same thing..however the one I bought in the store was made in MX with with fabric from MX. This one is Made in Jordan with material from there. THe original one is soft and thicker. THIS one is scratchy and very thin material you can see through if you hold it up. I am very disappointed in this obvious KNOCK OFF. The logo is the same but the shirt is not. Do not waste your $$$ on this.
2.0,"The bag is like plastic, it burned my skin under my underarm. I could only use it if I had sleeves."
2.0,"The glasses came scratched, which was a bad start. Within two days they were completely scratched up. Not ideal and worth wearing anymore."
2.0,"I don't think its worth the price. The background is actually white. The chain is a twisty kind that if you have long hair, it's gets twisted in it. Returning item. It think you can find something better for that price."
2.0,"Bought this for my 2nd gen Moto 360, I love the fit and the ease of swapping the bands, however a huge deal breaker is that the black is peeling off the metal clasp and I've only had the band for a week. Makes me question the durability and long lasting quality."
2.0,pcs fall off right away
2.0,I bought the Balaclava naturally because I work for FedEx the picture shows a nice thick balaclava  when I got it it was paperthin see-through does not protect against Covid or anything else very disappointed. I put the Balaclava up to the light as you can see it’s see-through.
2.0,"This bracelet comes in a pretty drawstring pouch.  The very first thing that happened when I first removed the bracelet from the pouch is one of the beads dropped right off of it.  Not off to a good start, but the bracelet is really pretty so hoped that one loose bead would be the only issue. Unfortunately it wasn’t.  Before I continue let me preface by emphasizing how lovely this bracelet is in appearance.  But then when I put it on, I felt something sharp scratching my arm, and found it to be a protruding piece of metal, and upon further inspection found there were several.  These were the ends of the metal headpins that hold the green beads in place.  These green beads are smaller than the length of the headpin, and as the beads move the headpin edges are exposed and result in scratching the skin.  So I will not be wearing this bracelet."
2.0,i got the ring and it looks pretty cool but the ring opens just like the show but after about 2 days time that makes it break
2.0,"Buyer beware. This bag is very cute however, I purchased it On May 26th &  today I am throwing in the trash. The stitching is nylon &  it began unraveling within a couple of weeks. Nothing I couldn’t live with it was like it made a little pocket on the side of the bag. It wasn’t noticeable and did not take away from the function of it. However a few days ago, another row of stitching started to unravel and totally ruined the bag.  Straw bags are always iffy and when purchasing it I thought if it lasted this summer I would be happy with that. Unfortunately that didn’t happen. If I had paid $15 for the bag it might not have been such a big deal but I think it should have lasted longer than it has for the cost. The pictures attached show where the bag came apart on all four sides."
2.0,The outfit is pretty see through if you are wearing it fitted.
2.0,The asymmetrical element was not my thing.
2.0,"Bag makes it super easy to move cubii. Nice bag. Love my cubii..<br />Had for awhile, this bag is not durable, rips too easy at handle."
2.0,"This hat was okay, but I didn't like the 5 inch brim.  It was smaller than I expected.  I sent them back and bought 8 inch brimmed hats instead."
2.0,El primer día de uso se dañaron se salieron los botones de filtrar el aire
2.0,"I wear a medium the top fit great, bottom runs very small. Soft material"
2.0,Made with bad material and has a weird fit.
2.0,"Great colors, good length, sturdy-but-soft cord. . . . but poorly constructed. The little metal &#34;sleeves&#34; that hold the end loops together and keep the cord from un-raveling are made of  very thin and pliable metal, so they loosen up easily. The metal is so soft that even if you re-crimp them yourself, they will still eventually bend open again and whatever is attached to the end loop will fall off. A dab of really good glue should help (but test very thoroughly before trusting)."
2.0,This item was poorly constructed very cheap materials
2.0,I like the earring size but they don't match they should be the same the Stones should match one to the other
2.0,It fit good when I got it and tried it on but once I washed it it was a little small.
2.0,"I actually love this pendant, but after a week, the chain has already broken - and all I did was try to adjust it! Very disappointing."
2.0,"I returned this item, although the fabric was nice and soft, it was not flattering and it was way to big on the sides."
2.0,2 washings and letters peeled off.junk
2.0,"appears to be cheaply made and do not feel they will stand up to a lot of wear,"
2.0,"The socks got holes in them the first time I wore them.Additionally, they show when worn with a Men's boat shoe.<br /><br />For what it's worth, they are comfortable."
2.0,"Very poor craftmanship - the buttons aren't centered on either pocket and if it was intended to be off-center, they are equal distance on each either.  The collar is coming undone already and there is extra stitching in places.  Fabric is nice, but I returned it."
2.0,too big:(
2.0,I only used it once and one of the straps ripped on the side. :( I liked the size of it though.
2.0,La textura no me agradó
2.0,I am returning this item.  It was so much smaller than expected and not the quality I thought it would be.
2.0,"The bag is very well made and seems durable. It also will easily hold a lot of things. However, the “oragami” sides are difficult to fold inward and hook and have it look nice like the picture. Also, it’s very difficult to easily get things in and out when it’s folded like this. I bought it for traveling but I’ll be using something else because it’s overall clunky and inconvenient."
2.0,"After reading the reviews, I ordered a medium. This did not fit at all like expected.  If I wore this with leggings, then I would be arrested for indecent exposure. Too clingy.  Fabric is more like a light sweater which is nice but this was just a big old nope on me."
2.0,just don't know what to say.. it was bad fit and very tight on leg area.
2.0,The hats arrived well constructed and well packaged but were huge for my preschoolers' heads. The hats fit me perfectly. Unfortunately I had to return them.
2.0,Material thin doesn’t fit well
2.0,"Very cheap and not durable, but what do you expect for something so cheap.. not sure how this is RFID but manufacture claims to be... good for a child’s first wallet or for an elderly person who keeps $3, a few receipts, 2 butterscotch candies, and a spare key to a 1982 Volkswagen Scirocco."
2.0,The mask was cool. Comfortable to wear according to my teenager. However it did not work when we received it. Lucky I have a handy husband. He quickly realized the circuit board was never completed and was able to fix it. All ends well with the last minute costume ordered 3 days before Halloween.
2.0,Material was super cheesy. Pattern printed on. Returned
2.0,Im very busty weigh 144 and it didn't fit. The strap is so damn thin it creates a a back fat roll ew! don't really know what to do with it
2.0,Shirt is smaller than all advertised of the size I ordered.
2.0,Too thin and too wide.  Not the thickness one expects of a sweatband.
2.0,I ordered a size 0 (which is what I currently wear). I tried and tried but failed to get these in my ear. Disappointing cause they're very pretty
2.0,"The quality of the necklace itself is very good. However, the frog is slightly larger than described in my opinion. So I sent the necklaces back because they would not have looked good proportionately on the pre-teen and young teen granddaughters for which I bought them."
2.0,Chocking neck and weird shape making it too short at the sides exposing the abdomen /waist (M)
2.0,Way too small. Stayed was Amazon Prime delivery but took weeks to arrive PLUS you are responsible for paying shipping cost back to China - which is about as much as the jacket sells for.
2.0,i wear a size large okay and this shirt fits like a small
2.0,"Was kinda disappointed in the Marled Blue... it doesn't fit like the pictures shown and the color is way off.  Looks cheap/homemade and while the price was great, I would have gladly paid much more had I known the quality before receiving.  Lesson learned..."
2.0,This is super soft which I like but the edges were already starting to fray when I opened it.
2.0,"Initially, I LOVED these shoes. I wore them for less than 2 months but the strap connecting to the heel, broke. I was doing a lot of walking at the ESPN Wide World of Sports complex, and the strap broke while I was there. They were cute and comfortable, so I was bummed!!"
2.0,"They are very small.<br />My fingers look like little pudgecicles in these gloves.<br />I feel they don't cover as much of the hand as shown in the photos either.<br />They can be comfortable if my fingers are bent, but become far too tight if my fingers are straight. I don't think I'll be wearing these for my strampunk cosplay next year (as they did not arrive in time this year, probably for the best)"
2.0,"I typically wear a small shirt.  Ordered an xl for an oversized shirt to wear on the water.  It fits like a med.  the material is cotton and flax. It’s very stiff after you wash it (did not dry) but it softens as you wear it. Has a natural wrinkle to the material already. Good for a casual beach / boat coverup. I thought it would be longer but barely covers my backside and I’m 5’2.  It is boxy like other reviews state,  but doesn’t bother me since I’m wearing it casually.  Not anything I’d wear to the office or try to dress up."
2.0,fabric is almost see-through and the fit is very baggy. Ended up sending back
2.0,Los postesitos vinieron doblados completamente y son más pequeñas de lo que aparentan. No llegaron en el cartón de WW 1984 así que al parecer es un producto copiado del de la foto que enseñan aquí.
2.0,"This watch is very pretty and I want to love it but there are glaring issues with it. First off the mesh bracelet squeaks, I read someone else’s review with the same issue so I don’t think this is uncommon. My other issue is how thin the material of the watch face is. You really shouldn’t be able to feel the automatic watch winding itself but on this particular watch you can feel each individual tick of the wheel when it spins.<br /><br />The material of the face itself is good quality, the mesh doesn’t pull arm hairs (which really cheap mesh’s will) and overall it’s pretty. But the “stainless steel” case is either incredibly thin or not stainless steal because of how badly you can feel the watch wind itself. Like the clear piece on the under side must be plastic or something who knows.<br /><br />I have other automatic watches that you can’t even tell are automatic when they’re on your wrist. That’s how it should be.<br /><br />Again not good quality but if your buying it for a 14 year old that won’t know the difference then go for it. If you’re a connoisseur looking for an everyday watch (like me) avoid this watch."
2.0,Just unstructured and cheap looking. Am returned no it.
2.0,"Poor quality item.  Very boxy shape, not very flattering for a female figure.  Honestly not worth the price."
2.0,Pants are cute but not like the picture.  The craddled butt design is actually a design mid thigh not under the butt and there are more white designs on the outer leg not just the inside of the leg.  This style may not be flattering to people<br /> certain shapes so would not suggest buying from this site unless you don't mind variations.
2.0,"This romper was SO cute!  It was quite large on my daughter. Initially, I didn't mind because bubble rompers are meant to have some volume.  Unfortunately, my daughters knees kept getting stuck inside because the leg hole were so large.<br /> After less than 30 minutes of crawling around the seam around the waist completely split wide open, and the romper was practically in 2 pieces... needless to say it went in the trash"
2.0,"I had to return these. WAY too tight! And that was xtra large. The video made it look so easy to get these on. In reality, if you have any physical limitations at all and are not a level 9 yoga master....chances are, you will have issues just getting these things over your toes, much less over your whole lower leg. :("
2.0,I have a big head and this beanie was a little tighter than I would have liked it to be. I returned them. They are made well and lined.
2.0,"The straps do not adjust. Because of other reviews, I ordered a M/L when I usually wear a small or a medium in shirts. I'm a thin-ish woman with averaged sized &#34;who-hazs&#34; and these bralettes were just too tight. Bummer."
2.0,This is really cute but the fabric smells horrible. I washed it several times and it still smells like a disgusting factory. Never got to wear it because I couldn't stand the smell of it.
2.0,"The reviews said it ran small, order a size up and still too small. Otherwise it’s a beautiful pair of rompers."
2.0,"This hat appears exactly as it looks, but I highly doubt it has a UPF of 50, because when you hold it up, you can see the light coming through."
2.0,Necklace broke when I tried to adjust
2.0,I used once and ripped. One was frayed even prior to using  concept is wonderful. This particular product needs work
2.0,Definitely doesn’t fit the best and doesn’t do my body justice. Not terrible though.
2.0,"After just 1 time using this belt it already looks like it is going to fall apart... Not very happy with it. Although it is pretty, i will probably be able to use it one more time before it rips."
2.0,"The pants are not white, they have a yellow-ish tint and I'm returning them. The size and material are great."
2.0,This thing is like a tent. Very unflattering. I wore it once and gave it away.
2.0,"I was so excited to finally find an Ear Cuff I actually liked; however, upon opening the pocket-sized padded envelope, the quality was OBVIOUSLY cheap. The fit is awkward for any ear and the dangling crosses are noticeably cheap. The design is nice, yes...but Don't buy it.<br /><br />Besides it takes ages to arrive.<br /><br />However, the one positive thing I can say about the distributor/vendor is that they have EXCELLENT customer service. When one of my cuffs broke, they immediately sent another and sent a follow-up email."
2.0,"Bulky, zipper pockets are too small, it's hanging in my closet. I've gone back to my old S4 Lockdown"
2.0,"These are so itchy! They are super cute, but there are little fibers on the inner lining that tickle and itch your face. I thought I could get over it, but they just are so uncomfortable. I find myself repositioning them, scratching my face, etc all day. By the end of the day I am just so desperate to get them off"
2.0,looks like a babby trash bag on me... not for plus size people make you look like a trash bag potato.
2.0,This coat is warm and comfortable but within 2 months of use both pocket zippers and the main front zipper have all broke
2.0,Just make very cheap and the fit was not good. Sent  back and got a no hassle return.
2.0,Logo is off center and is not shaped correctly.
2.0,They fit nicely and they’re very soft but one pair ripped the very first time I put them on. A second pair came with a couple bundles of loose thread hanging off. I didn’t have issues with the third pair. They were soft but overall seemed like such low quality I actually threw them all away.
2.0,Much larger than expected and the straps were different lengths.
2.0,"It is pretty and soft and if it wasn't so small I would give it 5 stars, I would definitely size up if you are thinking about purchasing this"
2.0,I ordered an XXL in these and received a small. They seem to be nicely made but now my 13 year old has a new pair of PJs instead of me. Disappointed
2.0,Cheap quality. Broken within 4 wears.
2.0,Not what I was expecting ! I thought it would be a bit heavier .The hole for the ribbon  or chain seems too small for either.
2.0,Looks cheapy haven't worn yet
2.0,Cheaply made - feel like plastic.
2.0,Returned. Not a good fit for my curvy body type.
2.0,Shirt was a bit see through and there was no stretch in the shirt. It was a bit rough the material.
2.0,"The slit is too high and the fabric is sheer. I was hoping this dress would be a nice addition to my summer wardrobe, but I doubt I’ll wear it again."
2.0,The color is not the same as shown.  It’s more of a medium blue. It arrived with 1000 wrinkles. I will never iron a garment meant for sleeping.  The fabric is too heavy to be comfortable for sleeping.The style is somewhat cute but with all the wrinkles it’s hard to really tell.
2.0,The color was faded and the left pocket came with a tear. I can live with the faded color however the poor material quality was a huge letdown
2.0,Would not recommend. Material is cheap
2.0,"Listed as blue, it's teal, did not match the outfit, but a nice tie"
2.0,Runs VERY small. Order up two sizes and it will probably fit.
2.0,The lens are not very clear and the frame digs into your face. Luckily I just needed the for parts.
2.0,They didn't hold up.
2.0,it was so cute and fit perfect but the glue came loose and it fell apart
2.0,Pretty color and company was great with return. But way too big!
2.0,"I purchased this jacket because I really liked the look of it; however, even though I ordered a size larger than I normally wear, the jacket was too small.  The color was much different than the picture shows.  Also, the jacket was more like a shirt than a jacket."
2.0,The legs are turning to black color.  Need a replacement if possible.
2.0,The frame seemed weak and they're larger than it appears.
2.0,"Very pretty but know matter how I tried, I couldn’t get them to stay in place."
2.0,Really cute but really short ended at bottom lip leaving chin exposed.
2.0,"Ok, but not as comfortable as I had hoped."
2.0,Giving it two stars cuz is neon very easy to get dirty . I also sweat a lot from hands. So if you have some kind of groves underneath this this would be very bold and difficult to Handel things. My reason for getting the pair was cuz I salt a lot during winter. Don't want my hands wet but this was not what I expected to be. Very bold groves. And breathable just not what I expect very bulky . .
2.0,Quality is iffy- the material looks cheap and is uncomfortable. I actually donated these to goodwill after a few wears. The price reflects the quality. I wouldn’t buy these again.
2.0,This sweatshirt seemed cheap to me.
2.0,"I like the way it looks, but it was way yo big. I put it on the smallest thing and it was still too small. I also could not fasten it myself, because the claps is on the wrong side."
2.0,This is not one size fits all. For shorter woman you are either going to have a bunch stacked at your angles which then defeats the purpose of warming and creates an itching issue or you have to bring them down over your foot heel up to the middle of the foot. There is a sharp tag  sewn into the stocking creating other issues. The company wants  $ 6 dollars to return for a $15.99 dollar item weighing less than 6 ounces. Ridiculous
2.0,"very very thin material, shoulders have to be very wide for it to hang right. material is clingy so shows every bump you may have"
2.0,"If you have wider calves, these will bunch up and accentuate your calf, they aren't flattering for those of us with wider calfs."
2.0,"Edit:  Changing from a 3 to a 2.<br />Reason:  I really wanted ""over the calf"" socks, these fall down and are really disappointing.<br /><br />_______________________________________________________________<br />Nice and thick, graphics are great.<br /><br />However they don't fit the bill of being a ""knee high"" sock.  Current style is to have them come all the way up to the knees and wear them with shorts<br /><br />I'm not particularly tall nor do I have long legs, so that was disappointing."
2.0,Not great gloves. Get stuck and rip when you try to put them on
2.0,"arms tight, fabric feels like paper"
2.0,"I was so excited to get these pants in, only to be disappointed and have to return due to them being way too small. These should be labeled as juniors size and not women’s in my opinion - i am curvy and have gigantic thighs and butt, and couldn’t get the xxl past my knees. The material was paper thin and lightweight, but I suppose that’s is how they are advertised."
2.0,Cheaply made.  Looks like a pajama shirt
2.0,"The day and date dials don't move, very disappointing.  Needs to be replaced."
2.0,"This would have been really cute on me.  Sadly, an XXL won't fit over my size 14 chest.  Bummer.  Guess I should have ordered a 4X. I gave it to my 17-year-old but it's almost dress-length on her."
2.0,within 3 weeks I have discovered multiple tears . Its beautiful and I love the look and feel but the longevity of the material just isn't there
2.0,It does not look like the picture and I ordered a large and it looks like a xl to maybe xxl was very disappointed
2.0,Not very  comfortable
2.0,"While I loved the fit of this shirt, I won't will be getting rid of it. The material feels scratchy and cheap."
2.0,The pants were very very small in the waist and the pant legs were much longer than needed.  I ended up having to clip the elastic in order to get them on my son.  I also had to cut 4 inches of pant leg off just up made it wearable.  Very very cheaply made.  Lots of loose threads.
2.0,Had cover in use just 2 month before noticing image wearing off in certain areas. Image on cover otherwise beautiful colors with matte/satin finish.
2.0,NO shine:( Company was very good about dealing with returns though!
2.0,It doesn’t look at all like pictures. It came with permanent folds so it could not be worn
2.0,Armholes flare out at the bottom revealing bra
2.0,The strap broke after a weeks of use.
2.0,The fabric is that shiny thin fabric it's see through and it looks cheap
2.0,These shoes are very ill fitting. They aren't secure on the feet and actually come up off the foot as you walk.
2.0,turns fingers green.. obviously
2.0,Not what I expected. Not thick enough to hold cross.
2.0,As you can see in the picture the quality is not the best.
2.0,The elastic doesn’t allow you to tie it. Going to have to return didn’t fit. It would have if it was the right elastic. Shame as these are super cute.
2.0,"The size was right & what I expected. However, it is not the quality I expected. The pockets on the side are not quite deep enough for my iPhone. It's almost a struggle to pull the top zipper closed with the phone in the pocket.  I will most likely be returning the purse."
2.0,I ordered this for my in pending Hawaii trip. I  Was disappointed upon opening my package. It's not normal kaftan material polyester very thin kind of tight in the arms I think I'll keep it because returning at playing something else before I leave isn't gonna happen. Buyer beware.
2.0,Jersey knit my butt. the fabric wasn't soft at all
2.0,Despite the description this is not a good option for bustier ladies ;)
2.0,"I'm a big believer in you get what you pay for.<br />The one redeeming quality about the cross was its size.<br />The engraving is one-sided and the ""rope"" is cheap. It should come with a disclaimer stating that you should not shower or swim with it on.<br />I had mine for a little over two weeks.  I got out of the shower this morning and discovered it was no longer around my neck. God knows where it fell off and where it is now.<br />My advice, pay a little more for better quality."
2.0,"nice brazelet fit and feel good in my wrist , best lume I ever seen, stopped working in two months it won't wind. what a waste, I guess you get for wath you pay ;should make a better researh and get the one with the NH35 instead."
2.0,Very unstable post. Love the design but they broke and not worst the buy
2.0,very cute but completely see through
2.0,I liked the style of the suit.  The size chart is not accurate.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:3625501aa4e76b762d36030932504a8e]] I was quite disappointed about the quality of this dress. It's very thin and flat. Not at all flattering. The small was too small, but I suspect that a bigger size would not have made me very happy. It's not an ugly dress, but it's just not so great. I'm returning it because I'm never going to wear it."
2.0,I wanted to like this jumpsuit but honestly it was way too big and the proportions are weird. I got a Large thinking that if it was a little big i could just adjust the straps....I was wrong lol the top half of the jumpsuit was just really wide and not adjustable. If i sized down I don't think the bottom half would fit.
2.0,"Very cheaply made. Seems in fabric are not done well, very uncomfortable edges of fabric on the inside. Also, shape of shirt is not as shown. The bottom flares out more than pictured on the model. It's not at all as &#34;slim&#34; fitting as it appears."
2.0,These are not as low as I expected. Definitely not &#34;no show&#34;. And the size is pretty large as well. I wear size 9 but they are pretty loose. The material is okay - not thick but not too thin either.
2.0,Much larger than expected. Arrived promptly.
2.0,"My daughter is six and pretty much a drama queen.  She tried to use it several times but it was either too difficult or would fall off.  She's not really in the spirit of letting me help her or practicing so it may work for other kids, just not mine."
2.0,"Size is fine, but the sweater isn't brown. It's more of an army green color."
2.0,it looks really cheap looking
2.0,"Though the ad mentioned for  men n women , not so much. On a woman wrist lovely, on a man’s wrist, cheesy. Too effeminate for men."
2.0,&#34;Large&#34; is very tight in the fingers; okay around the palm measure.  But I don't expect these to last too long without splitting unless I can manage to go about my business without flexing my fingers.
2.0,The coat fits great and is very comfortable but if you bend down at all the temper tends to open up and you have a hard time getting it off and it breaks
2.0,"I thought I was buying a pair of casual trousers. The care tag read ""dry clean only"" when the frabic is a cotton blend...<br />I have owned for about 2 weeks and there is already a hole in my crotch seem. Really wanted to like but not worth the money."
2.0,It rusted immediately. Don't get it wet!
2.0,"2 stars just because I wasted my money. Nothing about them noted poor manufacturing, but they advertised as 00's, but were only 0's. When purchasing the gauges, the sizing information it gave me were that 0's were 10mm flare/8mm base and the 00's were 12mm/10mm base, but they did not fit accordingly. To stir more confusion, the small bags each pair came in had both 00 and 0 printed on them, making me think that the manufacturer doesn't understand the difference between the two. I read a review stating that you should opt for one size up, but I was intimidated by the thought of purchasing 1/2's, since my current gauge is only 12mm flare/10mm base, but I should've just done it. Now I have 6 pairs of gauges that are basically unusable. I'd buy again, but only 1/2's. Great deal, but very confusing and not a very positive experience."
2.0,It’s a nice shirt but it runs extremely small! I normally wear a medium to large. I got a large in this and the sleeves were wayyy too short. They don’t go to my wrists. The shirt is too short as well. My 10 year old daughter could wear this “adult” large.
2.0,"Not only was this dress too big but IT WAS SEE THROUGH! I can't wear this in public, I'll get arrested for indecent exposure! It's a shame because it is kinda cute but I'm returning it."
2.0,"i thought that it was going to be a good product. I bought it for my niece for her birthday. I do not like how cheap it looks, i know better next time to not purchase anything that looks like this. The chain is my main complaint, its just cheap. The pendant is fine, but it is for a 9 yr old girl so itll do this time."
2.0,Poor packaging and the glasses were bent.
2.0,This is enormous. Order two sizes down than what you typically wear.
2.0,"Cute boots for the price. The foot portion fit well but I could not get this zipped above my ankle!  I may not have the skinniest legs in the world but they are not 'thick' by any means.  If you have a thin calf or thin legs, I think these are totally worth the price you would pay."
2.0,"Necklace is alright, not great quality."
2.0,"These clip-on earrings are cute.  But, they are sized more for an older girl or teenager.<br /><br />Also, the first pair she wore - broke apart on the first day.  The rose separated from clip part.  I was able to fix it with super glue.  But, they're cheaply made."
2.0,I listened to the reviews and ordered 2 sizes up. And they were so big. I do not expect overalls to be tight but I could have fit 3 people inside them with me. I had to return them.
2.0,This fell apart getting it out of the package. I was able to make another necklace out of what I had on hand but there was no way to repair this one as is. I hope the teacher I gave it to really enjoys it but it would have been better for me if it had come out of the package as it looks in the image. Beads went everywhere.
2.0,"I ordered this Twilight ring in two different sizes from a cheaper seller (it was supposedly on a 98% off sale). Sadly, they were not packaged well and one came broken. While the ring is sparkly and pretty, it is definitely not the same one pictured in the advertisements. It was supposed to be silver, but there is no inscription on the band. Also, the advertisement shows a ring with gems held in by prongs, but this ring appears to have the gems glued in place. I am not sure how well it’ll hold up."
2.0,They were different lengths. They looked funny when they were on.
2.0,Such cute glasses but poor quality and smaller than a regular frame. Too small for my face.
2.0,"I’m not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn’t this. It’s a shiny, really smooth texture like plastic. Not like a regular sweatshirt!"
2.0,I love the charms and it very stylish but the clasp broke off soon after receiving it. (I bought the Hamilton one)
2.0,Comfy but superrrrr thin. They get huge and crinkly by the end of the day.
2.0,These socks have a different texture to them and i hated it so i ended up giving them away.
2.0,Sent these back. They are not UV protectant. The weave is too loose to block UV rays.
2.0,"Not printed the way it was when marketed, wording is blurry and mask is too big"
2.0,Button pull off when she tried it on
2.0,"Shirt fits weird, flows out at bottom and end of arms (that hit at a weird spot) but is more fitted in shoulders, also is short. Definitely order a size up, or two...."
2.0,"This dress absolutely wreaked of perfume- truly disgusting . I am not someone who is opposed to buying consigned clothing, but I did not expect it nor did I pay for second hand. This will be going back."
2.0,"Not good. Digs into sides of groin very uncomfortably. Also, band around thigh is tighter than rest of thigh - making a strange indent. So I can’t wear it under midi dresses as planned. For reference, I bought L/XL and I’m 5’5” 180, with weight spread evenly. Maybe a larger size would work better but I doubt it. Uncomfortable, unattractive, unusable."
2.0,"The idea of a sporty, plum-colored, T-shirt appeals to me, as it's not a color I have in my wardrobe.  Unfortunately, Clifton Heritage missed the mark with this one.  The texture of the fabric is thin and crinkly, like something that just came out of the washer and badly needs ironing.  It showed no signs of straightening out after I wore it around the house last evening and slept in it overnight.  (Somehow, the shirt depicted on the Amazon site model lies nice and flat, exhibiting none of the puckering qualities of mine.) On the positive side, the shirt has a flattering, trim cut that stretches with your body and doesn't feel bad on the skin.  Probably something I'll only wear as a bottom layer or for lounging around the house."
2.0,"Pretty but the necklace material had a horrible odor..... tried washing it but could not remove the odor, so not wearing it."
2.0,cute idea but cheaply made
2.0,Might work for some but not for me. I like to bring lots of stuff in my lunch so i was searching for a nice sized lunch tote. this one is large as stated but too narrow. everything has to go in sideways - so leaks can occur. Just a caution to anyone who might purchase.
2.0,Both rings did not work even after replacing the batteries so that was disappointing.  Masks were just fine.
2.0,It not as pretty as it looks in picture. Little bit misshaped and quite fade shade . Here in picture it looks different color more of bronze but mine came as Golden and honestly doesn't look much pretty. But still werable
2.0,Colors are not as cute as they look in pictures. Hems and fabric make it look cheap. I will keep for bed or around the house or as a bathing suit cover-up
2.0,These earrings came with several stones already falling out.  I had to use crazy glue.  They are very cheap looking.  I doubt I will ever wear them.
2.0,This is a short band.  Purchased for an average sized teen.  It doesn’t fit her comfortably because it’s just so small.
2.0,These belts are huge. And not able to be adjusted to smaller sizes. So frustrating.
2.0,"Honestly, there's nothing wrong with this product. I bought in on behalf of a friend who I'm no longer friends with, who was giving it to another friend.  That whole friendship really tainted this review, for which I apologize.  They're kind of cheap bracelets anyway."
2.0,I gave 2 starts only because it too large. I bought 8.5 my usual size but boots are at least 1-1.5 sizes larger. Returned them.
2.0,"It's nice product, but the quality overall was terrible the yarn was all over the place and I had to redo the end connections in the inside."
2.0,Low quality.  They don't hold up well without a garter belt.
2.0,not great for fluffy people...doesn't fit right.
2.0,I thought it was kind of cheesy...not at all what we expected
2.0,i got a size small and its baggy. doesn't look good.
2.0,"Not as described.  First, these pants are not linen nor is the design the same.  They are boxy with little shape or flow.  Poor quality."
2.0,"I ordered a Large because I am a 38C. I like how lightweight they are, and the lace is nice. The cups are small but the straps are big. They feel too big, but are small at the same time. It sits low on the back and there is no support because you can’t tighten the straps. Not bad to just hang around the house in."
2.0,It's pretty but came soooooo knotted was never able to wear it! So basically a waste of money
2.0,"They seem to be good quality. BUT... they have nothing to protect the insert on the front, which I thought could be worked around when I ordered them. When I received my order... I saw that the back is open, too. This poses a BIG PROBLEM! I'm pretty disappointed by this. I may need to return them for this reason."
2.0,Skort is fine. No pockets on the seams. Not good for golf. Don’t play tennis; so can’t evaluate there
2.0,I bought a more expensive pair thinking quality would be better. The packaging was impressive and the glasses appeared to be made well but I saw no difference in reducing glare. I tried them with and without my prescription glasses and didn't help at all with glare from headlights.
2.0,I was looking forward to having these cute sunglasses designed to fit a smaller head. First time I wore them one of the nose pads broke off and optician said it could not be fixed.
2.0,"I am small size, and even though I chose medium size is TOO SMALL...unbelievable!"
2.0,Finally got to put them on and they are WAY too long and too big. The men’s 2XL can fit a man that’s 6’10” y’all easy. My husband is 6’4” and he had to hold them up when he walked.
2.0,"The shape of this dress in unflattering. The lace on the shoulders sticks up a little bit, and it flares out unusually at the thighs. It's a little sheer and doesn't look like it would hold up well over time."
2.0,They seem like nice quality but they run VERY small. I ordered the largest size available- large  (I'm 5'5&#34; 150 lb) and I couldn't even get them half way up my thigh ( and my legs are thin). Unfortunately I had to return them. I only recommend them for very slender ladies.
2.0,slightly too large (And I love large sunglasses).  But they look cartoonish
2.0,"I like the style. They just arent durable enough. The last pair broke the same week I received them. I would suggest you get more than one pair, just in case. I did. Lol."
2.0,The first strap I put onto my glasses earpiece broke.  Hopefully the other 5 will not.
2.0,The belt buckle kept falling apart very poorly made.
2.0,"Very cute, but the silver toned plating is very thin, and wears off quickly. There's bits of copper showing through, and I've only worn ta small handful of times."
2.0,Size up atleast 2 sizes! Cute pattern! Not overall impressed with quality of material!
2.0,Nice material however only received one in my package
2.0,Highly overrated! Normally I wear a 1X so I ordered a 2X to be on the safe side. Couldn't get the zipper zipped without assistance. Runs small!
2.0,Too small for an adult with a medium/large head. Had to return it.
2.0,"Bad stitching runs off the edge of seams, which is why I returned them. The drawstring also sticks to coated-fabric interior of tube and the toggle holding drawstring isn't very strong. The largest one is sleeping-bag-stuffsack size."
2.0,"I love the quality of the leather and the handle size is perfect. My only complaints are the metal pieces on the bottom. The covers fell off exposing rough metal that scratched my kitchen table top. I have a sub compact Glock 26 and it barely fits. It also seems award because u have to put it I'm in upside down to fit in the concealed carry pocket making it unnatural to pull it out in a hurry. And after a few days some of the stones on the cross started falling off. If you could improve on the size of the pocket, remove the metal pieces (which I did) and attach the stones better this could be a lot better."
2.0,Pretty Blah material<br />Items seem to be less than put together
2.0,"As you can see in the picture, the name on this necklace is supposed to read ""Amanda.""  Sadly, when we got it, the necklace said ""Sydney.""  As my daughter was unwilling to get a name change, this necklace was of no use to us.<br /><br />If the name had been right, it wouldn't have been really appropriate, either.  The clasp was broken, the chain was completely tangled, and overall, it looked cheap.  I can't imagine any girl over the age of 12 would be willing to wear it, and even then, probably not.<br /><br />Sorry to deliver the bad news."
2.0,Worked great for awhile but it's useless now. Unsure if the battery isn't holding a charge or what but disappointed that ceased to function after three months.
2.0,Removing the &#34;protective covering&#34; off the acrylic was arduous and imperfect.  Case itself works quite well and is hanging on my wall.
2.0,"According to the description these cufflinks should actually work, but even though we followed the instructions when winding up the mechanism, it broke within the first couple of hours of wearing them.<br />The reason for this might be that the mechanism is not protected with either a piece of glass or plexiglass or plain plastic, and is thus vulnerable to touch, but either way I would not purchase these cuff links again."
2.0,no earrings  but lovely necklace
2.0,The shorts are cute however the sizing is way off. I ordered a large but would need an XXL to actually fit. I normally wear a medium or large in shorts.
2.0,Super cheap already tarnishing. Have not got it wet or anything
2.0,Fits like a maternity dress.
2.0,"The breast cups were a bit too small, there wasn’t really a way to adjust it since pulling them up pulled on the crotch area. Too small in the horizontal direction as well, but I have larger breasts for my size :-( had to return"
2.0,"Poorly made. You get what you paid for! I normally wear a size small, so from reading the reviews, I ordered a size up and went with the medium. However, the arms were too big (wide)...it was not the fit I was hoping for."
2.0,Tardó un poco de tiempo
2.0,"Too small. I am a 38D and I ordered the XL. I can barely squeeze into these bras, which is a shame. The colors are bright and the fabric seems comfy, but if you're bigger chested I would steer clear."
2.0,"I EXPECT MORE FROM THIS BUT IS NOT WORK,AT ALL,IS NICE BUT A LITLE CONFUSE TO USE I WILL RETURN AND BUY ANOTHER KIND AND BRAND"
2.0,"Very small, insignificant pendant."
2.0,Fabric was very thin and not very well designed.
2.0,The watchband is beautiful but the screen bumper for the first time I wore it.
2.0,Very odd fit. Very slim and super long. Also fabric is like polyester and has static. Never wore outside
2.0,"Sweater is soft and fits well, but there is a whole in the bottom of the sweater on the back side."
2.0,"Whatever material the hook side of the velcro fly is made of is terrible. I've only had the shorts for a few weeks and part of the hook side is already tearing out, treating the stitching like a perforated tear line. I'm currently in the process of trying to sew it back down and hopefully salvage the shorts."
2.0,"I wear a lot of suit and slim fit shirts, the concept of the footloop is amazing cause i don't feel it in my shoes, but the clips slip off numerous times which constantly makes me run to the restroom and fix myself. Please make the clips to where they can hold on consistently."
2.0,"The quality of these are not good. I should have paid more attention to the product images as they are worse than the items I received. There are pieces of lint and tiny what look like hairs all throughout the pink part of most of the charms. Some of the charms, the pink is poured over the gold and looks messy. Thankfully they were not too expensive and I didn't waste that much money, but I have to throw a few of these out and that's kind of annoying."
2.0,Somewhat see through for me. I don't mind as I am going to be wearing tunics and long shirts.
2.0,I liked that it was waterproof. I didn’t like the size: It was way too big for a girl. It was huge.
2.0,"Don't believe the &#34;Anti Tarnish&#34;  part of the description of these earrings.  I wore them for 2 days, and when I removed them, they had already left a green circle imprint on my ear!"
2.0,"I was looking for a pair of leather gloves for cold weather. I understand for this price I can't get the top quality stuff. However, this pair is below my expectations and looses in comparison with gloves from other sellers. It smells pretty strong and bad. The quality of leather itself, the stitches is poor. Again, for this price I was able to get the better pair from another seller.<br />However they are longer than the average gloves and that's good.<br />Also runs a bit bigger than expected. The size M is closer to 7.5, is a bit too loose for my regular size 7."
2.0,Cute dress but totally misrepresented the size.
2.0,"Unfortunately this dress didn't work out for me.  The colours are terrific,  however when the package arrived it's absolutely reeked!  My fiance opened it in our bedroom and the entire upstairs of our home smelled of a heavy, perfumed scent  that we couldn't quite place.  We weren't sure if it was a fabric softener smell, Fabreeze....???  Wanting the dress to work out,  I aired it outside and then again over the heating vent and it still smells over a week later,so back it goes!  Also, the front and back panels of address do not match up pattern wise."
2.0,"I like the case, it fits my glasses well, but it did not come with the cleaning cloth. It's just the case."
2.0,A trendy look; but much too large for my smallish wrist.
2.0,Disappointed. I purchased these to embroider as gifts for an event this weekend. Sadly they are much darker than in the picture and read much more dark navy than gray. If you're looking for gray handkerchiefs these are NOT for you.
2.0,Very cheap costume same color but looks nothing like the picture.
2.0,"Pretty, but the jelly-like loops to hold on to your glasses roll back and forth (because they're round like spaghetti) and then break quickly (because they're weak); they're too long (hang too low when glasses are off, drape too far down your back when glasses are on) and there's no way to shorten the length."
2.0,Not a cute top in person
2.0,This was so disappointing. It looks faded and dingy and I’d never even been worn.
2.0,"I ordered my normal size according to the chart, it’s about 2 sizes too small. I’ll be returning."
2.0,Super heavy
2.0,These look cheap.
2.0,"If you need these in summer, you better order them in winter, they take 2 months to arrive, and be sure to order the right size, your return window will close a day or 2 after you get them."
2.0,Cheaply made so I guess I got what I paid for.
2.0,There are some tears on collar area. Can't give as a gift!
2.0,"Would have received a great review, had it been long sleeve like in the photo and description.  Couldn't return it because I needed it for my baby's birthday party several days away."
2.0,"Run very, very small."
2.0,Too small and handle not as described. It’s beaded and cannot go knee child’s shoulder. Needs hand carried.
2.0,"Doesn't look like the picture, thin fabric, runs small & the arms are short. Disappointed :("
2.0,I normally order my regular size so I did the same and did not get the same results outfit was more of a medium than small. Overall cute comfortable outfit
2.0,great looking belt but the little round metal loops started falling out after the first use. I had to return it and select a more quailty product. (Went with Levi.)
2.0,It’s not fitted at all; just an oval price of cloth so it doesn’t provide the best protection. The ear loops are not adjustable and fit too snuggly so the mask is uncomfortable.
2.0,one of the spaces where you put your thumb is too small
2.0,Too tight and does not stretch enough to fit up over the shoulders and it is baggy around legs.
2.0,The waist was extremely small with absolutely no give. Have to return it because it just doesn't fit. Also the top part is really thin. Please look at the measurements to make sure that your waist is that small.
2.0,Everything is good except only 11 mask came in instead of 12
2.0,"Be aware that if you have a tempered glass screen, the case will not fit.  The case is also 2 separate pieces that are supposed to snap together, but mine comes apart all the time...I'm guessing from the screen cover I have.<br /><br />Also the case is just a cheep plain case with a marbled sticker on the back...-_-"
2.0,As socks they are reasonable price for the quality. Unfortunately my daughter was disappointed to find cats rather than the pictures upside down silly looking dog.
2.0,"We have purchased this brand in a nearby store and this shirt was much much smaller, luckily it fit his little brother:)"
2.0,"I like them but 3 of 4 straps broke the day I put them on, I sewed them instead of returning, only reason for the 2 stars. Size was right, just quality."
2.0,It fit fine only reason I'm giving this only 2 stars is because the material is so extremely cheap..
2.0,Fits nice but not true to image design . Looks more grey then black
2.0,Nice quality for the price but this is not an American size large. My slim hubby could barely get it on. My daughter is a size 4 and it fit her well so it's hers now.
2.0,Its a very thin linen like material. In the picture the jumpsuit appears to be a loose fitting jumpsuit but it is not. It’s loose on the bottom and fitted from the stomach/waist area and up
2.0,"I was so disappointed with this necklace when I opened my Christmas present. For the price, the charm is super small, you almost have to squint to read it. I wasn't expecting anything huge, but a least a necklace that had a little substance to it. There's another necklace by Out of Print for the Great Gatsby, but my experience with this has me re-thinking purchasing anything else from this group. Which is sad, because I love a lot of their merchandise and their mission."
2.0,"Sorry to give this bag only 2 stars. The look is very nice, true to the photo.<br />I was so disappointed as the handles fell off the first day I used it!<br />Each time I tried to reattach one another would fall off.<br /> There I was on an appointment with this mess."
2.0,"The rings are as expected, visually, but the sizing is waaaay off."
2.0,"too short. I'm 5'5&#34;, they go 3/4 of the way to my knee and therefore dig into my calf."
2.0,"Very cute, but broke about a week after wearing. Disappointed"
2.0,"Looks pretty online..deceiving  (very)<br />Looks cheap and can easily break if care isn't taken<br />very plane , has no charms"
2.0,Do not like the acetate lining.  Cotton would have been better.  Still waiting for my refund after 2 weeks. What's up with that?
2.0,"Sizing, according to the size chart, is way, way off--like 2 sizes off. Order accordingly! Can't say anything about the fit because it didn't fit!"
2.0,"The BangTi carabiner is pretty to look at, shiny chrome in an appealing design. Unfortunately it's way too small to be used in any situation that actually requires regular clipping and I unclipping  (such as attaching keys to my belt loop). I had hoped that this biner would replace the simple aluminum one I got at the hardware store, but it's too small to easily clip and unclip one-handed. It's smaller than the thumb drive I compared it to, about two quarters in length (meaning the diameter of two US quarter dollar coins). Into the drawer it goes, with all my old and unused keys and junk."
2.0,It not bad but there too small and the value kinda sucks.
2.0,"The swimsuit is really cute; however, the bottoms were very tight in the legs, while the top was way too big. My daughter really wants to keep it, so I'll have to figure out a way to &#34;fix&#34; them for her."
2.0,A little discolored/darker than expected.
2.0,"Overall this dress is good for one time use but not for a long time use. The sequins from the dress comes out when I opened the package. Also, the head bow was missing."
2.0,"This bracelet, while pretty, broke within one week. I would have been more upset if it was expensive. I can't recommend this as a gift because it's flimsy."
2.0,Nice quality of jewelry... but the bar is way to long to wear.. I have full plump lips so finding a healed hoop lip ring is always so hard because they all fit to snug. But this one is way to large !!
2.0,It's more see through then it appeared in the picture and runs on the small side. Will likely never wear it.
2.0,Super cute but they just slide right off with out even being active I can't even wear them around the house
2.0,"Comically small.  I thought the wheels and handle would be helpful, but they actually take up a great deal of the very minimal space.  I have ordered the non-wheeled version, and I hope that will work better.  This bag I purchased in the past for Spirit fit a lot more when I compared the two: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VWKYHPQ/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1.  It meets United's dimensions as well."
2.0,Takes a very long time to polish silver. Also does not take all of the black off well.
2.0,Love the feel of the fabric but they run way too small.
2.0,"The pendant itself was great, however the chain is very poor and it broke on DAY1<br />There was no way to fix it back as there are no spares or tools to do it"
2.0,Beactjful dress. I ordered 18-24 month and it was too small.
2.0,I could not wear this shoe because it was too big
2.0,"I love black sports bras, and was eagerly looking forward to this sports bra in my size, large. I couldn't even get it on, it was so tight. It looks to be about 3 inches tighter than my other similar apparel (by companies such as Champion and UnderArmour)."
2.0,These are pretty socks but aren’t standing up to the rest of time very well. After only two washings they are fraying and seem to have shrunk so they are now tight on my feet. They don’t have and gripping material on the inside edge to help keep them in place so they often slip on the back of my foot. I’m a size 9 woman’s shoe.
2.0,Cute little wellie but my granddaughter has only had them for a few days now and already the boot straps have broken off.
2.0,These are nothing more than VERY thin jeggings.  The design is merely sewn on to the pants.  I would not have ordered these if I had known what poor quality they were.
2.0,"Cheap material, stiff, not lined, just very basic. WILL NOT keep you warm."
2.0,"It is the end of December, 2019. I bought this in October and have not abused it in any way.<br />It felt like it was solidly built/stitched together. Now, I hust noticed that it's coming apart. The return window closed last month."
2.0,"Very poor quality, did not last long.  Do not buy."
2.0,A lot smaller than expected and lining isn’t seen in so things fall between lining and bag
2.0,"Loved the belt for about a week, then the buckle suddenly fell apart into 5 pieces."
2.0,"This sweater is  one size.  It is cute, but it runs small. It was too snug for me.  I normally buy a medium on Amazon.  I'm 5'2"" tall and I weigh 145."
2.0,Quality of stitching was less than sub-standard. Pockets started to unravel within a short amount of time.
2.0,Don't buy unless you want to feel itchy all not harsh material and no lining on the inside to help with that. So very uncomfortable very cheaply made don't waste your time.
2.0,The item is really not as pictured. Much smaller. The pom pom is pathetic. The fabric is thin and these are too small for most adult heads. Pass.
2.0,"I wanted to love these.  The material was a thick cotton, like duck material, and the color was as pictured, but the bottoms were much wider than pictured and they were a good 2 inches above my ankles.  I ordered a medium and I am 5'7"" and about 134 pounds.  The waist fit fine, as did the hips, but length and width of the bottoms made them look ridiculous."
2.0,"The leather is really nice material, but belt buckle so call metal free is just a plastic..so after couple months.. it broke (not I gain weight).. this belt is not cheap.. n only last for couple months? My job are in n out metal detector security area.. that's the whole purpose I buy this belt.. I almost want to give one star.. but the leather itself are really nice.. so I bring it to the leather Smith to replace the belt buckle n put a metal one.... then again.. the whole purpose for metal free is gone.."
2.0,"The handkerchiefs are actually 9.5 x 9.5, and the 100% silk instead of Cotton as described."
2.0,These look great but the leather is already coming apart. Disappointed!
2.0,These were really big. We wanted them for a costume but they were insanely big. We returned them.
2.0,Broke within 2weeks
2.0,i know they are cheap but some times you can buy cheap and it doesnt look like it<br />well these look cheap :{ not very happy i think ill jut return them
2.0,Heavy in the front and the sides are light. Leaning down it feels like they are about to fall off.
2.0,They come unlaced and it took 3 days on and off to lace these up. They are way too big and it's too bad bc they woulda been soooo cute.
2.0,Sizing is not accurate but the ring is beautiful
2.0,"These are only 1 3/4&#34; high, so the description is wrong, and they are too small for my glasses, which are not huge.  Otherwise these are excellent for the price and I would highly recommend them.."
2.0,Every time I dripped it it fought a part
2.0,Stretches out in one wear. Cheaply made... you get what you pay for.
2.0,"I ordered this along with a few similarly styled cardigan type tops. I love the look of this with a tshirt and jeggings. I am 5'7&#34; and 240lbs so I ordered a 2x per reviews and size chart. When it came, I was disappointed because it was too large and it seemed awkward and thick unlike the other 2 I had ordered. When I put it on, it was bulky and just over all didn't lay nicely in my body the way I wanted it too. I tried it again a few days later thinking I'd change my mind but I was still dissatisfied. I'm returning it."
2.0,I am not a fan of the USB recharging.  It only worked for a short time. Now they are just plain shoes.
2.0,I got the vital 2.0 black marl. They fit great and are super comfy but unfortunately they’re extremely see through. I would be returning them as even with the slightest bend you can see everything. Don’t recommend this color for leg days.
2.0,Poor quality. Had to get it altered for more than it cost.
2.0,"Not a fan. Material was thin, clingy and see through."
2.0,The fabric is wrinkly. And feels very cheap
2.0,"It took longer than expected to arrive, not the highest quality item, retaining hoop on strap broke 2nd day of wearing, painting on watch face was poor quality."
2.0,"I had these for about 2 months before having to throw them out. They're cute, and somewhat comfortable. The elastic straps are a little weird because they're really tight on your skin. The main reason they only get 2 stars is because the top part of the sandal started peeling and wearing away within a week of wearing these. They looked totally beat up and I had to throw them out."
2.0,"Lovely dress! Fits perfectly, however, if the hem lines were hemmed and not stitched it would have gain higher stars."
2.0,"ordered medium, got a small.  I received the one in grey last week and it was very short and the product was not what I was expecting at all."
2.0,"When I tried this on, the stripes were the only thing that was accurate about the description of the item. It was extremely large and billowy. If i were to have bent over, someone could see down the entire front of my shirt because of how badly it gapped at the top. The bottom was even worse, and made me look larger than I was just because of how loose the fabric was. I returned this, and will not even consider replacing with another size."
2.0,Fell in the floorboard of the car and broke the charms off then the charm flipped around and cracked my screen! Super cute but not practical
2.0,Didn’t get what I expected
2.0,This jumpsuit doesn’t unzip far enough to get  it on. I went up 2 sizes based n reviews and it was still too small. It’s going back.
2.0,Smaller than anticipated. They’re some type of a weird shape and difficult to put on.<br />I should’ve returned them.
2.0,Cute wallet but it does not block the ability to scan my cards from the wallet.
2.0,It was pretty cheap looking. I was disappointed.
2.0,These were not sized accordingly. Bought others of same size and they fit well. These are way too small.
2.0,"It's beautiful and good quality material, but the strap was broken as soon as I took it out of the bag."
2.0,Product was very uncomfortable and do not support the way it was advertised.
2.0,Great size & quality-would purchase again!
2.0,"I bought the olive drab quartz version of this watch. I bought it because it looked very similar to the watches our troops wore during the Vietnam War. I'm a big history buff and I love vintage watches. I was super excited about this watch. What I received was a major bubble burster. The watch at first glance looks amazing and very appealing to the eye. The dial looks accurate, the hands don't look exactly like the original watches. The lume is satisfactory enough. The wrist band is o.k. the main thing that was for me a huge letdown and a major annoyance to me is the quartz movement. It's got the usual second hand misalignment problem. I have to tilt my hand to make the second line up with the markers. I can't stand a misaligned watch at all. Why make a watch that's supposed to be based on an iconic watch and put a cheap, crappy quartz movement in it? I can't recommend this watch to my worst enemy."
2.0,"I’m 5’4” 148lbs. I purchased a medium size. Overall, the sizing was alright, but at the waist area you can see every crevice. I run smaller around the waist, and you could see my hip bones through the dress because the material was so thin. You will get what you pay for with this dress. I was hesitant on getting it but felt the reviews said most people were happy with the dress. The color was not as expected.. I thought it would’ve been a little more fuchsia/purple from the picture. I’ll be returning. I’d rather pay an extra $10-20 for a good quality dress."
2.0,The garment did not follow the sizing chart. I even went up a size from my normal and the cups were too small and did not have the proper support.
2.0,How do I purchase another?
2.0,"Came way bigger than expected, turned my nose green almost immediately. I don't think this is actually made of surgical steel. It feels very cheap, it's easy to bend, and surgical steel does not turn your skin green."
2.0,"It's nowhere near as thick as my original Apple watch band, which is what I expected for this price point.<br />Shipping too FOREVER!  For the type and quality of the band, I think the price is way too high.  Would<br />not repurchase or recommend."
2.0,Están bonitos solo que el material está muy poco durable
2.0,I ordered a pink one very nice. However the purple one was supposed to be the same as the pick one only difference was color but when it arrived the sewing at the waist was just a crooked mess the gathering was folded and just sowed in place so  the fullness of the tutu looked and hung funny. I can't even return due to the fact this is a xmas gift for my five year old granddaughter. I had intended to reorder a few more after the holiday but if different colors are sewn like this purple one I don't want to waste my money. I hate giving this purple one but have no choice. Poor poor sewing. The fullness is skimpy along side of the pink one. I am not happy to say the least!!!!
2.0,"Cute colors, but uncomfortable."
2.0,"The designs of the back and sleeves are not totally seems like the picture, actually I doubt checked after I received this shirt. Not bad quality, just the design, makes the shirt is not as pretty as the picture. But probably because of different versions or just copy. Anyway, not that kind of bad, but definitely not as good as the description"
2.0,When I received the sungalsses they felt very breakable. They were a very thin hollow plastic and the lenses were every thin too. They didn't do much to block the light. The style was not quite what I was anticipating. The plastic was also sort of a frosted look.
2.0,Very colorful but much too large.  I couldn't tell from the website description just how large these are.  It reads 3.94 * 1.77&#34;.  I thought it was 1.77&#34; long which would have been fine.  Site should read 3.94&#34; x 1.77&#34; since it is 3.94&#34; long and 1.77&#34; wide.  Would suggest you change the description.
2.0,"Ill fitting. Right size, completely wrong shoe."
2.0,"The fit is okay, however if it were a different material it would be tight. I bought this knowing it was a &#34;scuba&#34; type material, after reading reviews. I decided on black because I thought it would be safe in case it was thin. I was wrong, I will need to wear something under it, which is sort of frustrating for a long sleeve dress.<br />I am still going to wear it for my event, I am just disapointed."
2.0,"I order this hat to pack on my motorcycle in order to have something to wear when stopping and taking a break. The hat itself is fine and like any normal trucker mesh hat. I would think for the price of $17, the logo of ARCH MOTORCYCLES would be at least centered and level but I am wrong. Centered, yes but the level not so much. You can see how the whole logo is lower in the right.  Instead of ARCH it should be SLANT."
2.0,"These lanyards are pretty, and they seem to be well made, however, I put one on this morning and no more than 1/2 hour later I went to pull my hair back (it's shoulder length) and it was tangled up in the rhinestones.  That's kind of a deal breaker for me!"
2.0,"I purchased four pairs in 2019 that were fantastic. Thick material, fit my size 10 body very well, flattering waist control. Overall the perfect workout pants.<br /><br />I ordered two more pairs in Sept. 2021 and they are not the same. The waist isn’t as high, they don’t fit nearly as well, and the material is thinner and more… slippery than they used to be. So they constantly need to be readjusted since they don’t stay in place. Such a bummer because these used to be my favorite leggings ever."
2.0,Not my style I thought that it was going to have more &#34;presence&#34; .
2.0,"I really wanted to like this shirt but unfortunately, the collar is very high and narrow in circumference. Not flattering on me at least. I've never worn a henley of this cut before. The fabric itself was nice though."
2.0,Quality was good but ran too small for me... I usually wear size 12 dress and I am 152 lbs I ordered L .
2.0,The watch was very pretty but the band is already broken.
2.0,Fall so far the dress comes to small. Or the design is not blend in with the address<br />  I saw the dress online nice and elegant and when I got it it did not come Out  look like that. 👎🏽 I am very disappointed in the product did not make good. Online it’s elegant very good I got it in the mail is not elegant is does it doesn’t fit it’s too tight I just don’t like it.
2.0,I love how these look but one of the gems fell off one pair after only wearing for less than a day. Second one has held up better.
2.0,"I ordered a 14/16, they sent one the correct size in pink,  but the grey was a 10/12.  Not worth the hassle of returning and the shirts are cute but it's disappointing. The shirts are super stretchy polyester and spandex"
2.0,Way way too small/  You could not see I was wearing earrings. Returning them.
2.0,"This often shrinks when washed, we didn't dry it and then it was stiff. It sucks because I LOVED thin tank too. If i ever got a new one I'd never wash it because it shrinks to the size a newborn could wear. I would love it still if it didn't shrink"
2.0,"Nice swim trunk.  However too small for my kid.  I asked for a 3T size, but it looks like a 18months size."
2.0,Fit toobig around the stomach. Just an odd cut and the elastc didnt stretch I gave them to a homeless shelter
2.0,Good for a costume or for a kid. Not very sturdy
2.0,Thin small for a child
2.0,The design was good the fabric was terrible and it did not fit well Thank God I found a purple dress in the mall at the last minute the shipping was great I<br />It was delivered very fast
2.0,Too small order size up
2.0,Ok. Size is off
2.0,I literally just received this today and just tride it on. It has a hole in one of the pockets. It really sucks because the dress fits well and is comfortable.
2.0,Pretty bag but it's too large and stiff! I wish they had a smaller version.
2.0,"A little bit large, also the neck part droops to much. Nice print though. Wanted to return but past deadline."
2.0,This shirt for true to size but the fabric isn't very high quality and the white buttons on the black shirt look very cheap.
2.0,"I guess I don't know what I expected for $25.00... Very Cheap, plastic &#34;latch&#34; if you will, that actually holds the band around the wrist. Not what I expected at all. Thought it would be more of a cloth band but actually is more of a plastic synthetic material. Could pass for a cheerios box item."
2.0,I loved this purse. Very well made up until today. The latch on the strap completely broke. The purse is still in excellent condition but can’t use it anymore because there isn’t a strap to use.
2.0,"I guess my hopes were a little too high. This wallet was excellently built, but with 4 or 5 card in it, the wallet was ticker and wider than my cell phone. Yes, its has a smaller profile than the average bulky wallet, but i wouldn't consider it to be ""minimalist"" or ""slim"". My search for the perfect wallet continues."
2.0,"It looked nice for a while. Didn't last very long. After I had this product for a couple months, the silver began to wear off and the connectors got really loose."
2.0,"Slightly large and it is soft but it looks SO cheap, no shape at all and it leaves fuzzies everywhere. I got it in the orange color, tried it on, and immediately returned it the day of. Totally not worth 30 bucks. maybe 7...will look else where for the ""teddy bear"" jacket style...."
2.0,Sleeves and waistline fit weird
2.0,"Ordered small, fit was awkward. Couldn’t figure out the ties and how it was suppose to lay. Doesn’t look much like the picture"
2.0,"The product showed up with a dark stain on it. Otherwise, it was about what I expected."
2.0,Pendant is smaller than it appears.  The necklace broke almost as soon as I tried it on.  It would have been a beautiful piece if not had been for those factors.
2.0,Cute but much to small digs deeply into bottom of my body..it hurts
2.0,"Extremely uncomfortable.  The arms have peals on them and are tight and stiff.  Looks better online and mine arrived a wrinkled mess.  I normally wear a size the 8 US I ordered the 10 US using the size guide by the seller.  It was just too tight in the arms.  For reference, I am a 36a bustline 5'9 and 143lb and the 10 was too small in the chest area also."
2.0,Birthday gift for my granddaughter
2.0,"The color is nothing like London Blue Topaz. The design, while metal, has a plastic look to it, which makes the set look even cheaper than it costs. :( It will be a decent piece of costume jewelry or something my nieces can wear for dress up, but not something I would wear going out."
2.0,"I received with scratches on 1 of the earrings, and there is hardly any difference in the gold and the silver.  They look all silver."
2.0,They run big and make my feet look huge
2.0,Son is 18 months and 2T was way too small. Head opening is microscopic
2.0,My husband bought these for boating:fishing but says they’re more fitted for children than adults. Waaaaay too small for his face.<br /><br />Guess we will keep these for guests
2.0,Item to small....
2.0,Love the shoes but way way too small I would say they run 2 sizes to small
2.0,"Got this dress for my daughter for a party and the quality is cheap cheap, the design doesnt look like the picture. Will not buy again sorry"
2.0,"Cheap plastic hats. Worked for 4th of July boat parade, but were quite small and cracked / broke very easily."
2.0,These tarnish so fast! They turn copper within a day of wearing
2.0,Hat did not display a log in the ad.  I wanted a clean looking hat...the logo makes the hat look funky.  I dont like it.
2.0,"The length not good everyone don't want to show knee ,below the knees would have be great."
2.0,"Color is off, not vivid purple like in the picture. More of a light pinkish purple, close to lilac. Wasn't impressed."
2.0,They will not stay in place if you have long hair.
2.0,The material is very shiny and clingy.  The chest straps move around and the top of my bra ends up showing.  (I had to use double sided tape).  Also shorter then I expected.
2.0,"It took a month to come in and I waited for nothing. It feels cheap and it's hard to clip in. Also, all the decal bunches together so you mine as well wear the original band."
2.0,"absolutely does NOT stretch to 42 inches. I'd say this is more like a 'small', maybe a medium. sigh."
2.0,"disappointed actually.  Jacket is small, and very thin.  I ordered two of them for work and can't wear in the winter time as its too thin, and the advertised item said JJ Perfection , when tag says, MICKEL  and to dry clean.. I don't have time to take these into a dry cleaner.."
2.0,"These are very pretty. However, as some other reviewers noted and complained about, the stem on one of the earrings bent immediately upon trying to attach the backing. That is appalling. This might end up being a return."
2.0,It’s itchy
2.0,"It fits as expected and it arrived quickly. However, it is cheaply made and it does not look like the picture at all."
2.0,"the faux leather is peeling after 2 days of use. The red color is not as pictured, more of a dull maroon than the nice brick red in the photo. They do work as touchscreen gloves though."
2.0,"Awkward fit compared to size chart. No matter what I do or wear over them, you can tell I'm wearing something crazy."
2.0,"This top was way too small! I typically wear a size medium in tops, but ordered a large just in case.  I couldn’t get it over my chest.."
2.0,"Beautiful ring initially, however the finish comes off quickly and then it begins to turn your finger green."
2.0,"This jacket is super lightweight. I was kind of shocked how light it was and am wondering how warm it will be when you wear it. Sadly I won't find out since even though I bought it in a size XL that should have fit easily, it is at least a few sizes too small. And that is after following their sizing chart. So either I got a jacket that was incorrectly sized, or their sizing chart is completely inaccurate which is really bumming me out since I was really looking forward to wearing this jacket!<br /><br />I really liked how the jacket was made and it looked just like in the pictures. The material was great and the jacket was well made. I liked that it had a high neck collar which will be great to keep those chills out. The hoodie would have stayed up because of how the neck - hoodie was made. I guess it wasn't meant to be.<br /><br />It comes with a little bag in which you can actually put the jacket in so you can store it for traveling."
2.0,"I wore out the belt Uncle Sam gave me. I liked it so much I bought this one as a replacement. Unfortunately, this belt is not the same quality. My real USGI belt was much thicker and the buckle is brass painted black. This belt buckle is stamped steel painted black and says made in Taiwan on the back where my real one says 'US' and has a manufacturer's stamp of some sort. I'm using my original buckle, it looks better since the paint wore off and now the brass is exposed and it's higher quality. Tossed the stamped steel one that came attached to the belt in the garbage."
2.0,This things are huge!! I wanted to test these out  to see how they look and to see if I'd still want my nipples pierced after testing out these bad boys. But there is literally no comparison of these and real ones. These things are huge and just look weird. It's definitely not what I was thinking I was getting. I should have realized what I was getting... Lmao
2.0,"I can wear the top with other bottoms I that I have, but the material style shown is not what was sent to me.  The bottoms are a bit snug, but I will save them for my lighter days. Overall, did not receive what I expected to even despite the size flop."
2.0,"Very cheap material.  Does not give or stretch at all.  The design was nice, but I do not recommend.  Will be returning."
2.0,I did not like the posts of these earrings. They did not look like the picture. The post made the earrings hang down too low. I ended up giving them away to a family member.
2.0,"This sweater could have been okay but it's very small.  I read that in the reviews and I did order it a bit larger than normal but it was still not big enough.  So the sizing is &#34;off&#34;.  I definitely would have exchanged it but it's such a hassle to ship it back that I said &#34;forget it&#34;.  I will wear it around the house only, not out.  So if you are going to order this, go up a couple sizes..."
2.0,This item arrived on time and was very cute but the tutu part ripped in under 24 hours. Not worth 15 dollars.
2.0,"I had high hopes for this for lounging but am disappointed.  First off, this thing does my figure absolutely no favors and it is not something I'd wear outdoors.  This only fits loose and baggy like it does on the model if you had it a couple of sizes too large.  The crotch of these hangs really low.  The worst part for me was the fabric.  I found it to be hot and not breathable and really uncomfortable."
2.0,"Too small, and has the ability to hide before being able to return it. :("
2.0,"I love these boots, but they run sooooooooooo small. I ordered a size up as was suggested by the other reviews, and I can barely get them over my calf. They squeeze my calves so tight, it makes me look like a ham :( I would send them back and get larger but the foot part is already so big, I am afraid I would just be swimming in them."
2.0,"The fabric and color were fine, but they were still too large, even though I ordered a size smaller than what was indicated in the chart. My waist is about 30 in. The chart indicated Small as 29 in. waist, so figured I'd be OK. Waist was appropriate, but the crotch hung down at my knees and overall there was way too much room for my frame."
2.0,It is beautiful but way too small! Very sad!!
2.0,these are not the real bracklets.
2.0,"Super soft, however it was worn twice only, inside , for just a few hours and the stitches are coming apart in 2 different places."
2.0,RUNS SMALL - The dress was very cute but fit super small. There was no stretch but I could not even get it over my shoulders. Ended up returning.
2.0,See through. Cheap fabric. Returned.
2.0,Feels more like pajama pants than yoga pants.
2.0,The rings were great. Need a half size bigger because they are super tight and went to return them and it would be the same price as the rings to return. Very disappointed.
2.0,Not a good drawing of the Lion of Judah.
2.0,Picture leads to believe all have similar diameters but this is not the case. They vary wildly and some of the beads wouldn't even come off. I was unable to use them. Will be returning.
2.0,I got to wear these cute earrings exactly one time before the metal earring part popped off. I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,"A belt for giants. Seriously, where do they come up with how they measure this?  36” my waist and there is no way this fits me yet it says it’s supposed to. This might fit 40-48” waist. I think they had overstock and just repacked these as 34-40."
2.0,Sleeve are too tight for an XL
2.0,It needs to be smaller for ladies
2.0,"Ordered an X-large and it way to small for me, so I gave it to my niece who is a lot smaller than me."
2.0,Feels like I’m standing on lifts
2.0,"Nice design, good concept but unfortunately this one did not work for me. I work in web design and I spend most of the day working in front of a computer. I had it on for a half day and hadn't noticed a significant change as far as clarity in my vision"
2.0,"Quite comfortable and easy to install, though on the large size if your old insole isn't removable. Also, the arch raise is hardened plastic and has no give to mold into the shape of your arch... can become uncomfortable if you're on your feet for many hours at a time. Didn't work out for me."
2.0,"I bought 3 pair, two were good and one ripped after a month."
2.0,I don't think these are the real rocket dogs. I'll keep them but not happy about it. All of the others are way thicker. Lesson learned.
2.0,"This is not useful for any sort of viral protection. So thin I can blow out a candle with this on. It's only for looks. So I wear a 2nd different mask under this one. Also shipping took over a month. Not worth it, but now that I have it I'll use it for the holiday and throw it away."
2.0,"The price and quality is ok, but is to small, this sizes are Asian."
2.0,The material is not what I expected.  It had a dull satin look but not a satin feel.
2.0,"The socks are nice and comfortable , but as compression socks, they fall short. Not much compression going on here."
2.0,Added a great deal of weight to umbrella base and was very stable. Sadly developed leak at seam and no longer holds water. Lasted about 1 month.
2.0,"The torso on this jumper was too long for me. The space between the waste and crotch was way to long and not flattering. Also, the waste band was too tight even though the rest of the jumper was a little big. I wanted this jumper to work but I had to return it. 2 stars because the material was really soft."
2.0,Smaller than what I expected and the snap was broken on it.
2.0,"I really wanted this kangaroo onesie and based off all the size details in the description I should have fit a medium with room to spare. Unfortunately when I tried it on I couldn’t even fully lift my arms. It was so soft and cute. I was heartbroken because they didn’t any larges left, so I went with a giraffe onesie instead and I like that one, but it was just so sad that the size descriptions were off. I was within the weight and height range."
2.0,"Smaller than expected and fabric is polyester, not cotton as advertised"
2.0,I'm 5'2&#34; and the dress didn't seem to fit right on me with my proportions. It would look great on someone taller. The skirt was a bit long (past my knees) but great in the back. The top was too baggy and was too long for my torso. Ordered size small.
2.0,Love the mask. But there was only one in the pack.
2.0,"These pants were a very strange green color.  Returned them for a refund.  They looked cheaply dyed and not what we expected.  Quality was OK, just the green color was an issue."
2.0,"Very pretty but the sizing is not accurate. I ordered a 2X, which is the size I usually wear (245 lbs., 5'4&#34;), but this dress fit like a size Large. I don't know how this seller got his sizing but last I checked, a 2X is not a small size, it should fit like an 18/20. I'm very disappointed and this dress is going back."
2.0,"Arrived very tarnished, pretty colors, but afraid to use due to condition of pins"
2.0,"I was really hoping this would work for me because the print and style are so cute. I'm 137 lbs, 5' 6"" and a 36 C cup and both the medium and large had no support. The main problem is there isn't enough fabric to cover your breasts on the sides. If you don't mind side boob showing and minimal support it could work, but not my thing."
2.0,"I chose it out of others because it has a chin chord. But the Chin chord did not come with the package. And the top is one side low, one side high. Waste of my time."
2.0,I dont know if I got one that was not sewn right or what. But the hem above the lower band was so tight I could barely stetch it over to my arms to put it on.<br />2 stars given because I ordered the teal/gray and it matched like the picture.<br />Was a soft material tho. Maybe order up.
2.0,Not one of my favorites.
2.0,Wore it for less than an hour before it broke. I was pretty careful with it but it just sort of feel apart. Really a shame because it does look nice. Just very cheaply made.
2.0,Poor quality material.  wore it once and the black in the white faded into it and have not even washed it
2.0,It says plus size but only if you have non plus size legs.
2.0,They didn't match one another. There was glue or some substance on one earring also. I returned them. Too pricey to be a mess.
2.0,"Much larger than the measurements given on line, possibly tagged as a large when really an Extra larger. Had to return."
2.0,kinda boxy
2.0,Vendor placed loose foam bra cups in the top. I had to sew them down myself to keep them from floating across my chest. The cups were also too small for the size I purchased.
2.0,"Two issues: 1) I ordered the 4 pack that had two color lenses, I clear lens, 1 gray lens. What they sent was 1 colored lens, 1gray lens, and 2 clear lenses. That’s NOT what I ordered. 2) these goggles do a terrible job holding glasses in place inside them. My medium glasses would not sit right in the goggles and the goggles would not seal around them. Not recommended."
2.0,This is a cool ring however; the ring tarnished.
2.0,Button fell off after 1 day of wear.
2.0,The top part of this dress is VERY see-through and the dress in total was just way too small as I ordered an XL that didn’t even come close to fitting.
2.0,Disappointed. This dress fit me everywhere but at the top. Donating it in hopes someone else will have better luck.
2.0,"Nice quality but outfit runs WAYYYTT too big. Ordered s large, definitely needed a small or smaller."
2.0,I loved the look of it on my iPad but it wasn't what I was hoping for. It is very stiff and difficult to use. I haven't used this product.
2.0,"I suppose these would be okay as a nose ring as the diameter is incredibly small. I bought these for my cartilage piercing and found it not only extremely difficult to even put it in but when I did, I couldn't close the clasp because it was so tiny. I also fear that having to bend the metal to put it in will lead to it breaking."
2.0,Disappointed. The bracelet looks better in the picture..
2.0,These have so much thread inside and are itchy. Not happy.
2.0,"I ordered the xl based on others reviews.  It was probably closer to a size 16-18.  The shirt was way too big.  Also, I expected more of a softer material.  It's more spandex like.  Since it came from a country in the Orient,  I ended up giving to a friend instead of returning it."
2.0,Not full enough
2.0,It doesn't look the same as the picture.
2.0,Product was cheap. The leather pulled away from clasp first time putting it on.
2.0,Not flattering at all unless you want to look like a box in rough material
2.0,"pieces broke off and jammed inside lightening port, apple had to repair"
2.0,"The petticoat was exactly as pictured and of adequate quality HOWEVER it had a fishy smell to it. I tried airing it out in the sun and then left it inside, but four days out of the packaging it literally stunk up the room.  I couldn’t use it. It was returned unworn  and refunded. Two stars because the return was easy, and the petticoat definitely looked ok, but the odor makes it unusable."
2.0,"Love the look of the band and the simple face. Unfortunately, the glass on the face is bubbled, and this isn’t good enough to gift to someone. I will have to find an alternative"
2.0,This bracelet is really cute and even more for a remembrance for my miscarriages BUT it is very cheaply made.
2.0,Size doesn't match the chart
2.0,These were quite flimsy and not as good as other brands I own.
2.0,"The material is cheap and the seam in the back was loose and starting to split before I even tried it on. The belt is not attached, just a regular sash. The waist of the pants definitely runs small so if ordering, I'd order 1 size up"
2.0,"Cheap, see through... don’t waste your money"
2.0,I ordered the sizing to fit a 10 year old. It is super small. Maybe could fit 6 year old.
2.0,"These are cute and work, but I two have fallen out in 3 days (both while I was sleeping). Couldn't locate them unfortunately... my piercing (originally pierced 2.5 yrs ago) seems to want to close quickly, so it's added tissue damage each time one falls out at night."
2.0,"These earrings are cute in your hand and seem to be very good quality, but they are horrible on. The back of them needs to be finished out like the front because you can see as much of the back as you can the front with the way they hang on my ears. Maybe my ears are just weird, but I haven't had this problem with any other earrings, so I'm thinking that's probably not the problem... Anyways, don't waste your money until they make them look the same on both sides of the earring."
2.0,The suit is not well made and is very thin.
2.0,"I'm 5'2 and this dress looks super frumpy on me.  Material is really thin, can the outline of your bra.  Definitely not as cute as pictured.  Returning :("
2.0,Very little padding and what appears to be low quality materials throughout. Two days wearing inside and side seam already ripped
2.0,Should have read the print as these were for children!  To nsmall for adult woman
2.0,I couldn't figure out how to put this on my ring. Then when I finally got someone else to figure it out it fell out my first night sleeping and I never found the darn thing again.
2.0,I had to return this. It just didn't fit well from the waist down.
2.0,"There was plenty of space to sing without the cloth getting in the way, but it’s way too warm to sing onstage.  Causes too much sweating."
2.0,These are actually very cute. The one that wasn’t broken hung very nicely. But the other one was a broken clasp. So had they been not broken I would’ve given them a try to see if they irritated my skin or not but! What’s the point if it’s broken.
2.0,For the first month they were great then after the month holes galore in the crotch. Would not recommend buying. It’s honestly not even more the amount you’re paying.
2.0,"The band fit my watch perfectly. Unfortunately after wearing for a week my arm broke out in a rash. I stopped wearing it so my skin could heal and resumed wearing my watch. This time the rash occurred after two days. I allowed my skin to heal again and replaced the metal pin from the one from my original watch. My wrist has been fine since. I'm not sure what material it is made out of, but skin had a reaction to it."
2.0,"I ordered the dress in black, but I was sent one in gray instead, so I will be returning it and I won't order a new one. I found the material to be too tight and somewhat cheap-looking. It clung to the hip and thigh area in a way that was unflattering and the material was too thin, meaning I couldn't wear the dress by itself. I was disappointed, as I was really looking forward to wearing this dress."
2.0,Dress was too small and very short. Had to give it away.
2.0,"Never by based on the photos. I baught this dress thinking it would be knee length, but the model in the photo must be 7 feet tall or something. This dress reached almost to my ankles and in a regular 5 foot 2. After getting the hem up a little, its still not exactly the photo, but is atleast something I can wear now. Remember to always check item descriptions before buying, alright."
2.0,"after one wear half the sequence fell off before being washed even. the section with the sequence is very small too, does not fit over a d size chest."
2.0,"The stitching is wonky and in places it doesn’t even connect the mask to the scarf. Bulk produced by with no attention to detail, sure some of them are wearable but I wouldn’t buy bulk at this price it’s a clear indicator of low quality."
2.0,Turtle neck very small size no right
2.0,The soles were dirty...these were possibly a return.
2.0,"Front panels gap open, sleeves are on the short side.  One Size does NOT fit all (expected Large).  Fabric nice and soft"
2.0,"I have many skirts- this one is being returned.  The waist is bulky and obviously elastic.  The length is MUCH longer than In The photos, and the shorts are polyester and spandex done badly.  I love my LDI hiking shorts, but this was a bad choice in comparison.  Not recommended."
2.0,Returned sleeve had a pucker in the seam.
2.0,"Disappointed. The picture looks very nice and with some length. It arrived with a very tiny chain. Where the tiny pearl hangs, with mine, it did not fit well to hang with ease. It was awkwardly stuck in the design and the pearl protruded outwardly, opposite of gently hanging down. The clasp is not well made and very difficult being so small around the neck to even fasten it. I had high hopes for this necklace but was disappointed and I had planned to buy one for my daughter. I would much rather being writing a five stars. Actually, I am being generous by giving it two. The bottom line is the combination defected and small chain with cheap and difficult clasp to work with. A plus out of this, the shipping came within a reasonable time period."
2.0,"Returned: The band attachment to the watch and solid loop were unfinished and sharp, the band length was long, and the magnetic clasp was so big that it made the band try to be flat on the curve of the wrist."
2.0,"I bought the repell and it is way overpriced for what you get compared to other protucts like crep protect, It is a good one time purchase if you have access to the Jason Markk flagship store so you can buy refills."
2.0,Broke within 3 weeks
2.0,"I didn't hate the way the dress fit, but the material was so awful that I had to return it. Seemed to run a tad bit large."
2.0,"These are smaller than what I expected and cheaper made, have already lost one as it fell out of my ear."
2.0,"This is not one of those soft plush you see in the stores, it’s very rough scratchy material, and it has a lining so no soft Sherpa  against your skin, inside so you don’t feel anything soft. I am returning it .it also runs really small, the measurements are incorrect and way off."
2.0,It wasnt the way i want it but cool
2.0,Fabric is unmanageable and too bulky for wrapping the head. It would make for a nice shawl.
2.0,Pinched my skin
2.0,"Returned this.... not the quality you would expect out of Fox, they must be putting more into their Shift brand now because we replaced this with shift gear and love that. but then again all the major brands put less into their women's gear. bought my wife mens gear when we switched to shift.. yes i know shift is owned by fox."
2.0,Belt smelled terrible upon arrival. No idea what type of moisture or something that made it amell like it. Definitely bothers you at first but ks functional and looks decent
2.0,Extremely flimsy
2.0,Not a fan they always are slipping down to much feels uncomfortable. I threw them out.
2.0,Love it however received it with a hole in it I emailed them and have not heard back and I ordered 3 :( so we could have matching ones
2.0,Too short-not sure my son will be able to wear
2.0,"When I get items, the right hand glove has a hole on the middle finger while the left hand doesn't have it. I suspect it is a broken glove. It has a big imprint of the thumb on the surface because the way the item is folded. I want to buy it as a gift for my girl friend but I have to return because it doesn't look good, as well as the hole on the middle finger. But yea, it is pretty warm."
2.0,"It shows in the listed merchandise the maroon hat is supposed to have a flame and a feather on the front label. It says blackskies instead. Other than that, the hat looks and feels like good quality, just upsetting that its not what I wanted..."
2.0,They are nice for the price...but unfortunately they don't fit my fingers...Yes I'm a lil disappointed...so I guess ill jus give them to my niece to play dress up with....
2.0,"The cut of the dress was great, and the yellow was a really great shade. A bit brighter than the usual mustard color, but not one of those horribly intense mega yellows. It was a really pretty shade for fall. The lace was nice and the fringe was trendy (not too stringy or long). But I returned it because I couldn't stand that the lining (which shows through the lace) was pure white. It is starkly obvious and makes the dress look unfinished. You can see the entire outline of the main sheath of the dress, and for me it ruined the look of the dress. Other colors might be better if the lining isn't so obvious, because the dress itself is nice, and I was really disappointed that this one didn't work out for me."
2.0,"THIS SKIRT LOOKS WAY CUTER ON THE PIC. FIRST OF ALL  IT WAS TOO SMALL, BASED OFF THE MEASUREMENTS GIVEN AND OTHER REVIEWS I ORDERED A L.I NORMALLY WEAR A L OR XL.  I WOULD HAVE WENT UP A SIZE BUT THE WAY THE MATERIAL LOOKS I WONT. IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL GET REALLY LINTY PLUS TE MATERIAL FEELS ROUGHT ON THE SKIN. NOT REAL STRETCHY EITHER. COULD OF PULLED IT OFF AS A TUBE TOP...LOL SIKE JK!"
2.0,"Dress was nice and light in weight, but it wasn't flattering at all.  The shape of it was not complimentary to my form.  Nice on the model pictured, but looked totally different on me.  I had to return."
2.0,Medium is child size
2.0,Did not like this with the inset doesn't fit well...returned
2.0,"Am very disabled and buy these quite frequently. For over a year every time I put on a new pair they felt great. Now every time I put on a new pair, they feel uneven and sometimes painful. If they start sending decent pairs again I'll change review, for now  gonna be looking elsewhere."
2.0,I was a little disappointed in these Pom poms. I ordered this pack because it came with 6 so my daughters and I could share. However a couple of them came broken as you can see the picture. I’m still able to use them as a key chain but not as purse Pom poms which is why I bought them.
2.0,"The style is cute and it fits, but the material is terrible."
2.0,I liked the style of the watch but it is not durable.  The plastic casing and face of the watch cracked after less than 3 months of wearing it.
2.0,The small fit like a large. Just something to be aware of.
2.0,Super cute but one month and already tarnishing
2.0,One of mine are missing a stone
2.0,Fast delivery. Had this hat but it broke so I ordered new one. I am disappointed because one of the fingers (the most important one) is slightly raised so it gives away the gag.
2.0,"I was SO excited for these, I ordered them in brown and black plaid both 2X. According to the measurements they provided the pants should have fit me, however they were both too small. So strange considering some reviews mentioned they thought they ran large. Might reorder in a bigger size, but I’m wary now."
2.0,"Ordered the yellow....got right size according to chart, way too small, weird material. Definitely order up, and plan to wear something under it because it’s see through."
2.0,"I really liked these pants when they arrived, but as soon as I tried them on, they had to go back.  They are at least two sizes too small.  I compare them to Wrangler jeans, which always fit me out of the bag.  Now, I get charged an extra five bucks to return them, because they are nowhere near correctly sized.  Don't bother."
2.0,Skirt floats up when your in the water.  Not good if you plan on going in water but otherwise if just on beach it's fine
2.0,I ask size 8 womens shoes and I don’t have abnormally fat feet and these barely fit my foot they are very tight and they just didn’t work found them for $2 at my local swap meet so I sent these back and got 5 pair for the price of this 1 pair
2.0,The belt worked great for a week and now the buckle won't grip into the belt making it pretty much worthless to hold up the pants.
2.0,"Loved this choker. Honestl it was cheaply made, the clasp broke after the first day I wore it and I had to fix it myself. Makes me mad when I pay money for a product and it malfunctions on the first day. Would not purchase again."
2.0,I ended up keeping this shirt but now have it in my pile to give away.  The sleeves need to be a bit longer.  They hit right where my elbow bends and I find it very uncomfortable.  And the material is just ok - this would not be a shirt I would recommend.
2.0,"Have really enjoyed using these glasses for computer work, but the frame suddenly broke.  And, no, I didn't drop them or was rough with them.  Only used at the office.  Otherwise they were great!"
2.0,First wear they were already tarnishing.
2.0,I ordered this thinking that they would look more macho than they are but no they are very girly colored in person and not something a dude would wear except the full navy one.
2.0,"El producto es demasiado sencillo, nada que ver con la imagen que nos venden."
2.0,Too bright for my taste-neon colors.
2.0,Not crazy about the fit! Short and tight in the tummy!
2.0,cheaply made but was very cute
2.0,Just a regular stretchy tank
2.0,Don’t get size chart wrong and Material is cheap
2.0,I hate that they flip to the unbeaded side when wearing them!
2.0,Pretty but the fabric is so thin.  Thinner than my thinnest tshirt but it was easily returned.
2.0,"For the price of these gloves, they were great, the light combinations were great and for the most part the instructions were easy to memorize.<br />But there is one major problem with these gloves and that is the size. I don't have big, meaty hands, but when I bought gloves in the military I had to buy large or extra large gloves to fit my hands.<br /><br />So the first event I went to I was excited to use these gloves. In the beginning it was great but has I took off one glove to answer my phone, the whole inside of the glove came out with my hand. Essentially turning the glove inside out and it was impossible to put the wires back into place into the fingers.<br />I wish I kept the glove to add a picture but I was so upset I just left the glove where I was sitting trying to fix it.<br />I hope EmazingLights makes a pair of gloves that can fit users with bigger hands.<br /><br />To end on a positive not they did arrive here in a timely fashion."
2.0,"I bought these for my neice who has cerebral palsy she was so excited..however when i got them they are huge and fall off her face, also the case doesnt shut.. I would just go to wal mart and get a pair! The price is good but next time I will spend more."
2.0,This necklace broke the fourth time it was worn.
2.0,"I thought I would save a few $ by ordering this, but I shouldn't have. It's thicker and not as soft as an actual 100% cotton hat. Even the label says it's 50% polyester.  I tried washing it with fabric softener, with no luck."
2.0,Too hard to put on with bubbles and screen does better protection on it's own.
2.0,"Very thin cheap material for the pants. I had to return because they got a hole in them after wearing just once... also the pants are very tight. For a small had to squeeze in the legs, it was very tight spandex almost fit. But the waist had plenty of room. Very odd fit."
2.0,"The top is definitely blue, and the bottom is black. Does not match."
2.0,"Had it about 6 months. Great layout, well designed. Good material, Poor construction. All but two zippers broke, including the main compartment, the right shoulder strap ripped out almost completely, the grab handle at the top ripped out. For airsoft, or as a light duty range bag, etc. might be okay, but any serious use will make this bag fall apart."
2.0,Hand wash only. Not advertised. We will donate to charity as the socks are very thin and hand washing does not fit into a busy bachelor life.
2.0,"Cheap feeling fabric, see through in this color."
2.0,The hat was too big. You cant adjust it. The stitching did not line up on the forehead part. It just looks odd when the fabric is not properly alined. Fabric is too heavy for any Amazon jungle trecking.
2.0,"The top was a bit cheaply made, doesn't hold heavy boobs well"
2.0,To small for my head.
2.0,Really cheap (duh...you get what you pay for).  It came quickly but the hanging stuff just flops around.  I'm bummed I bought it.
2.0,"Came ripped at bust and was thrown in bag.<br />Fit very well.<br />Going to take in to repair, not worth returning.<br />Inexpensive and I think worth fixing<br />Be aware of this seller"
2.0,"Extremely thin, t-shirt material. I wear them under another pair of capris and let the lace on the bottom of these capris show. Almost like a slip."
2.0,"I really liked these the first time I wore them, but they are unfortunately not good quality. I have only worn them three times around the house, and already the serged hem has come undone in two places. The cap has popped off one end of the drawstring, and the drawstring keeps disappearing into the waistband (it was doing that before the cap came off). The waistband is twisted and won't lie straight. These are very comfortable, so I'm sad that I'm having all these issues."
2.0,"Beautiful bracelet, runs small"
2.0,"Poor quality, should have been half the price."
2.0,"My wife made it smaller on both sides, it was just way too big."
2.0,"These rings were made from cheap metal. Bubble gum machine quality. Actually, not even that good."
2.0,"I loved it when I got it, but the chain is so fine which made it break,very sad because I loved the bracelet."
2.0,"I purchased these to wear as work slacks (as shown in the demo photos).  Only a blind person would look at these and not say ""hey, why are you wearing yoga pants?""  As yoga pants, they are very nice.  As not-yoga pants, they failed their deception check."
2.0,"It somewhat fit, The height of cap is low.<br />As long as my son's head is shaved he can it.<br />Caps should not be one size fits all with the little adjustment in the back, they should be made for head sizes for men wirh larger heads than young boys."
2.0,too big - fits weird on the ar.
2.0,"I returned those boots. The material looks very cheap and, without lining, the boots are also rather uncomfortable. Iwanted to reaplce some old black boots but I decided they look and feel better than these"
2.0,This was significantly shorter than expected. I’m 5’2” and it was extremely short.
2.0,It was not easy to assemble at all
2.0,It took over 6 weeks to get to me...it was way too small for a large. Disappointed with product and service
2.0,"87% Polyester, 13% spandex, that's what these pants are made of, but I've come to expect better quality from polyester blends these days. These pants remind me of why I always steered clear of polyester, because it doesn't let my skin breathe. I don't hate the feel of the fabric, but I don't like it either. It's soft but not really smooth, and the material is thin enough to almost qualify as pajama/ lounge wear. These are NOT yoga pants by any stretch of the imagination. And the fact that they're high-waisted is an understatement; they come to just 3"" below my breasts. They cling to my thighs but are loose around the waist. Disappointing product."
2.0,"I was so excited when the shirt arrived - it is really lovely.  It just doesn't fit.  For me, it ran WAY too small .  I normally wear a medium.  But, purchased a large because I don't know the brand.  It just is too small.  It will be going back.  I'm so disappointed because it's lovely and I'd really like it to work, but - and again - it runs small.  Sadly, they do not offer an XL - so, I won't be able to even try another size."
2.0,I usually wear an XL. I bought this in a Large and it's HUGE! I should have ordered a Small.
2.0,The vest is advertised as having a hood but there is no hood.
2.0,Very tight not breathable
2.0,This shirt fits my boyfriend. It is like a dress on both my 13 year old boys
2.0,"I wear a 10/12 in dresses, L/XL in tops, 5'8"" 150 36B, and I like my maxis to the floor. This XL is 2"" or more too long, the arm holes are giant and sag out - this thing is a tent! For the price I expected a light airy fabric and this is a heavy spandexy polyester.  I much prefer the halter dresses by London Times when they are floor length."
2.0,"Seem kind of cheap, lenses are mirrored yellow not clear and mine seem to have uncleanable marks. Fit is large . Doubt if I’ll use much not worth returning."
2.0,"I am not exactly sure what this keychain is made of, but when it arrived, it had a rough edge and there is a spot on the front that almost looks like rust and is rough to the touch as well."
2.0,The rips on one legs is off centered.  located closer to inner thigh.  looks like you have crooked legs
2.0,I used the guide to place my order. It was too big.
2.0,Watch band broke after I installed it. They also sent me a screwdriver that did not fit in the existing screws on the watch. The material is not as soft as the original wrist band. I would not recommend this product.
2.0,"Very cute as a gift for a graduation present, BUT the diamonds started falling off in chunks within a week :( She had a whole piece missing at her grad party. Disappointed."
2.0,"Sent it back, got a large and it's tiny."
2.0,"I bought this for my mother-in-law when my father-in-law passed away.  The first day she wore it, the clasp on it malfunctioned and would not stay closed.  I had to go to the jewelry store to purchase another chain to go with the locket."
2.0,"I got this nightgown for my very picky daughter. It’s lovely, and she liked it a lot, but for one thing. Where the square, buttoned area is joined to the remainder of the gown by lace, there is no material behind the lace. And it lies precisely where you’d prefer that part not to lie (at least, if you’re a shy preteen and not a seductive woman). And I’m sure the lace could be somewhat irritating there as well.<br /><br />Needless to say, I’m sadly returning this nightgown.<br /><br />*ETA: It looks like other pics do NOT show this issue. Would absolutely buy again if guaranteed not to have this problem!"
2.0,This were way too big for my six month baby. She is a bit small for her size but they absolutely did not even nearly stay on her feet they were so big.
2.0,Cool earrings. a little tight. will squeeze painfully if worn for more than 20 minutes. cool for pictures though.
2.0,"Lasted 3 months, and started coming apart. I would not recommend."
2.0,Cut us really weird and doesn't stay on shoulders
2.0,I ordered a 2x. The length was adequate but the waist was more like a traditional Large-at best. Adjust and order at least 2 sizes larger when purchasing.
2.0,The color was darker then the pic
2.0,The color of the dress not red. It was more of a orange color.
2.0,"i had to take off the c pad because my incision is longer than the pad itself.......very uncomfortable...also, size was too large."
2.0,"I really wanted to like these but the pants don't fit on like they appear in the photo. The leg holes are small which forces the corners of the pants stick out in a weird way. Instead of draping like they do in the photo, the bottoms stick out like wings. Returned."
2.0,Not quality fabric and ill fitting even for a sweatshirt. I don’t  expect this one to hold up for many washings but maybe I will be proven wrong. Also the seams where the color blocks are sewn are scratchy.
2.0,"I was very excited until I received them in the mail. I am 5' 9&#34; and 151 Lbs. There is so much material at the bottom that they look silly. After wearing them a few times they were very uncomfortable, they kept riding up and would literally give me a wedgie ;) I tried many different types of underwear hoping to solve the problem, to no avail. They do go to the floor with flats but I feel they are uncomfortable and need constant adjusting so they don't ride up. Sorry, I wanted to love them."
2.0,It definitely isn’t for short women like myself. I’m 5” even. So it looked way to big. Wasn’t as cute as the pic either.
2.0,I ordered the cream dress and the color was very different in person than pictured. I was disappointed. The buttons were also different than I expected.
2.0,"Followed the sizing chart and bought the size suggested for my husband but they were still one size too small. For those who are thicker around the middle, please consider going up a size to the one suggested by the chart."
2.0,Looks pretty but after wearing for about a month it started peeling and falling apart.
2.0,This costume is extremely small cut. I would definitely recommend sizing up I am usually a medium I ordered that size and I couldn’t even get it over my bust area it was very tight to try and maneuver. Definitely size up I can’t say that I would recommend the costume completely due to sizing issues but other than that presentation is So-so!
2.0,"The title says tank tops, as in more than one. But I received only ONE tank top. This shirt runs on the smaller side, 5'6 180lbs got xL. The curve neck sat right at mid chest its wider cut in the back like a guys tank top. Material is good quality but thicker than any tank I ever purchased. I will be returning this tank top."
2.0,Not thrilled with the color. The color was not as depicted in the photo. Aquamarine is a bluish grey and what I got was a topaz color which is much different. Very disappointed. Will likely return them.
2.0,The dress feels like a costume. I didn’t realize how fugly the sleeves were. I’m too embarrassed to wear this in public and be judged
2.0,"I work in a auto repair shop. My feet are always cold from the concrete floor. I thought for sure this was my answer to my feet being somewhat warmer....Not true!  My feet are actually colder now, and I'm thinking it's the aluminized thread.  They have nice compression, and they are a quality made sock, but as far as 35 below, they don't work at 55 above."
2.0,"This product has the potential to be cute, but the material was awful and somewhat see-through. Also, I got this in the smallest size they had and the chest area was too large."
2.0,He wore through them in about a month.
2.0,We love these shoes but they seems to tear really easily. Have worn them for less than a month and the one shoe is almost completely torn on the back.
2.0,The metal bits are cheap and the way the lanyard Velcro's together makes it stick out behind the wearer.  This should be in the photos.  Highly disappointed.
2.0,They fit but they areBIG rhinestones very obvious and flashy. First one I put in didn't screw all the way and ended up falling out
2.0,The glasses fit fine but I am somewhat disappointed in the optics which I would have thought would have been much better in a Ray Ban product.
2.0,To small for me to ware
2.0,"I hoped to get two nice ones out of the four, I didn't expect that all four would be good at this very low price. Only one stone was clear and had rainbow, but it had internal fractures AND inclusions. The other 3 were dull and cloudy, one did have a rainbow, but only on the bottom. I will keep them, they are interesting stones, but I cannot use them for the purpose I had intended, to ornament an instrument.  They will just go in the pretty pebble bowl."
2.0,I had to make some major alterations to the arm holes. The shoulders and arms were placed strangely. It served its purpose but I wouldn't recommend.
2.0,I ordered one size bigger and it was still too small.
2.0,The top is very oversized and boxy
2.0,Had a weird fit.  Would probably be fine if you are tall and skinny.  Not for curvy figure.
2.0,"I love the bra, but only giving 3 stars bc it ripped when I took it off the first time! That’s never happened to me with a sports bra! I like it enough to stitch it though."
2.0,"I’m typically a size 7 1/2. There r no half sizes so I ordered an 8. Now they r too big. Not sure they r a true 8 though because the sticker says 39, and that typically means they r size 9."
2.0,Belt came apart on the edge after wearing for a couple months.
2.0,This dress looks beautiful in the photo but not in person. I am 170lbs and 5'4. I ordered a M and it was too large and too long. I ended up giving it to my aunt. It wasn't worth it :(
2.0,"Bag itself is great but the decals fell off in less then a month, gorilla glue nothing kept them on"
2.0,Foggs as soon as my second use within 1  month from the purchase. Do not recommend if you are looking for a goggle that does not fog.
2.0,"Very cute but unfortunately turned my finger green yuck! Good to wear for a couple of hours,’I then than that ugh"
2.0,I ordered it specifically because it showed a pastel purple choker. But it’s not pastel. Definitely need to either update your images or show different options. Because this was a little misleading. They are still nice looking but still.
2.0,"I walk 2 dogs early morning before work.  Now that it is dark in the mornings, this light around my waist is perfect to 'see' the sidewalk, but also to see me. Has two 2 lights.  One that is focal beam and another that is a wide softer beam.  I like how I can rotate the light to my liking on the path I walk.  I would highly recommend this for anybody that walks dawn or dusk as well as night time.<br />But then 2.5 weeks into using it, the light literally dims and goes off within 5 minutes of turning it on.  I can't find how to get to the battery to change it.  But it works great when it works.  Surely the battery lasts longer than a couple of weeks"
2.0,Esta a la medida es comodo pero al enrollarse es incómodo
2.0,"I'm a 6' tall girl. I saw another review on here with someone of similar height and weight, however for me it came up way too short."
2.0,This is a straight slip. Its very uncomfortable.
2.0,Super cute but my daughter has extremely narrow feet and these straps cut into them.
2.0,Band broke from the face guard within a week. So disappointed
2.0,Cute on the outside but the inside has so many pockets you will lose your items it’s kind of annoying
2.0,It’s okay for a play room. Foam ball definitely not good for outdoor play.
2.0,"They are pretty, but the clasp behind the ear is so tight it hurts and cannot be loosened"
2.0,"Definitely not a Seiko in the feel of the watch.<br />If I hadn't moved a mountain to buy it because it looks 10x the feel, there are sharp edges.  I have Chinese watches with far better fit and finish.<br />There appears to be a great deal of these returned.<br />So my latin escapes me, buyer beware of seize the day."
2.0,Purchased the hot pink as an XL and was way to small.
2.0,"Front scuffed up easily and the bottom was already rubbing down so much a hole was starting in less than 2 full months of wear. I went back to the trusted Skechers, for a better deal and longevity that the brand has always provided my kids as school shoes."
2.0,it came apart after the third time i wore it.
2.0,I ordered a 3X because I suspected that my usual 1X could be too small. The 3X was STILL slightly too small and the hoodie is completely missing the hoops that go into the grommets on both the hood and the pockets.
2.0,VERY thin and the feet are slippery.. not safe at all. Also has a hole in pocket..
2.0,"This jacket fits as expected, but the black version looks like a graduation gown and I just couldn't get past it. It is not a flattering cut, and the collar + fit just made me feel like I was back at my high school graduation ceremony. The material is also extremely noisy and seems low-quality (not surprising for the price, but even worse than I would have expected)."
2.0,Been purchasing these for years for my son to use at college. Something's changed in the design. His toes hang over the front now. Not comfortable and probably not safe for him. Not sure if the company changed vendors but there is something definitely wrong. Not what they used to be.
2.0,I'm very disappointed with the earrings.  They are obviously not the same color.  I have them in the pearl (not real) and I love them. Very comfortable.
2.0,"This isn't really long enough to be a tunic. The material is a slinky fabric, which makes it look more like a pajama top. I'll probably only use it for sleep. Disappointing."
2.0,"Very cheap material, does not look like the picture."
2.0,Doesn’t open with my Code for the TSA lock.
2.0,"No padding in feet, no heel pad, just a straight crappy tube."
2.0,"I actually like hats where the neck guard is attached and can be rolled into a flap in the brim. Nevertheless, I thought I’d try this, since figured I might be able to store the neck guard, etc in the crown while they’re not needed. When I got the hat I tried to attach the neck guard, which comes with small plastic hooks that are supposed to go into fabric eyes on the brim - couldn’t even get the hook through the eyes (I tried several of each to make sure it wasn’t just one bad hook or eye). The hat is going back to Amazon..."
2.0,Not a great design. The gap between the pincher is too narrow to put it in without breaking the fragile jewelry.
2.0,They look as shown but I tried to use them with my jacket sleeves.  They held for about 2 minutes and just kept sliding down.  Dont know how they will work with a lighter weight blouse.  disappointed.
2.0,"Very thin material, so, of course you need a cami or something underneath"
2.0,I’m 5’4” and usually a size 8. The medium fit until first wash. Way too tight now. It shrunk to an empire waist and not flattering. Disappointed. Unable to return as I had thrown away packaging and tags after first wear.
2.0,"I'm 5'7, 185, muscular. I bought the XL, they fit, but were a bit loose, which made them super comfy. However, did a squat test and they immediately showed skin, which seems weird if they'd be loose right? Well it just turns out that they're thin. So if you get these I'd stick with cardio stuff and not a lot of yoga or lifting. The pattern is cool, and they're comfy...just a lil thin for my workout intensity level."
2.0,A little see through.
2.0,"was supposed to be for outdoor use. used as fancy house slippers. Back of shoe too  low.. slips off foot, like clogs.."
2.0,Fit for the price
2.0,The boot started to come apart after 3 days and my husband had to use super glue to hold together.  Since he has to have at work he kept however I wanted him to return for refund.  You get what you pay for
2.0,"Stretched out upon wearing and proceeded to slide down.  I spent all day pulling this bandeau back up, ugh.  Soft silky fabric could use more elastic.  For reference, my bust is 44&#34; and I bought the Med/Lg."
2.0,"Not completely horrible, but Nothing like the picture or the reviews.<br />I don't know what happened.<br />I think they should make indicate that the &#34;fits most&#34; is fits most 0-4."
2.0,"I'm so sad that this jacket did not fit, my husband was so excited when he opened his Christmas gift, only to be disappointed when it did not fit. I ordered an XL which fit like a medium."
2.0,"the delivery was done on time, but they are missing an arm!"
2.0,"My 6 year old loved this watch because he liked all the colors, he wore it all the time. Unfortunately it does not seem very durable since the strap broke and he lost the watch part at school the first week he had it."
2.0,"The description says, &#34;Metal money spring clip / Flips open&#34;.  I was expecting the money clip section to open up 90° or so like my old one.  It does not.  It's the standard piece of metal that you have to pry up a 1/4&#34; to push the money in.  Inside, the credit card slots are very, very tight.  I had to slightly bend my credit card to get it to go in.  Finally, the driver's license window is not as pictured.  See how the fancy little ENIMAY card is almost fully contained within the window?.  It's not deep enough for an actual license.  About 1&#34; of my license sticks out of the pocket, about flush with the edge of the wallet itself.<br /><br />It works, kinda.  Wasn't what I was expecting.  Not sure if it's worth returning."
2.0,Waist fit great but the legs were tight on my sons thighs. I ordered M and he only weighs 65 lbs. weight on M goes up to 75 so I’m not sure what happened.
2.0,Fit is fine but the quality of the material is cheap.
2.0,These have a nice sheer leg and the top has a great control although I’m not sure about the lift. They are not compression in the legs at all though. Especially below the knee.
2.0,Comfortable but is not true to size
2.0,"I am 5'5&#34;. Not good for me, felt like it was make for someone much taller. Does not fit bra size 36C. Is More for smaller sizes. Quality was ok."
2.0,This is okay for the price and fits nicely but the red color bleeds so don’t wear it with light colors. I wore it with a light yellow tank top and the color rubbed off under my arms. I ran it through the wash again hoping that would solve the problem but I wore it again with a nice white shirt and it bled under my arms again. I’m hoping I can get the color out.
2.0,"The dye in this product bled a lot. I have several ruined pillows. It bled even after I washed it. I wish the material they used was colorfast. Needless to say, I stopped wearing it and went back to my bonnet."
2.0,Band slips and gets lose throughout the day. I am constantly having to tighten it to keep it on my wrist. But you get what you pay for
2.0,Looked brassy
2.0,The design is only on one side. Microfiber like on other side. Looks stupid and cheap.
2.0,"I've owned this belt for over a month now. The sizing guides  are coorect and the belt looks decent. However, after just 2-3 uses, the section near the middle of the holes (where my fit is) has come apart, with the top layer separating from the bottom layer. I still wear it because the flaw is not outwardly visible, but i wonder how long it will last. I am trying to avoid leather products, hence went for this one, but if it breaks down I may just give up and buy a quality leather one."
2.0,Uncomfortable!!! Just can’t make them fit! 225$ later! Very dissatisfied!
2.0,Too tight on bust / under arms yet swimmingly super large over waist hips and butt.  Side Slit to high to walk outside in wind.  ( like need bike shorts underneath)  I am proportional. This can only fit someone who is more pear shaped than hourglass
2.0,"Glasses slide off the ends while wearing them and have fallen on the floor! When you are busy, in retail, during the holidays you need these to stay on and work!"
2.0,"This is a reasonably nice-looking poncho. (That is why I gave it two stars rather than one star). However, it is very lightweight, so does not provide warmth. It is not even slightly water-resistant. Water soaks right through. I unfortunately found it worthless because it doesn't protect from anything at all."
2.0,Nice packaging and super fast delivery...it feels and looks cheap
2.0,It is about a half size too small. Strap closest to toes super tight!
2.0,"I did not like the material. I felt like I was wearing a table cloth. Weird plasticky feeling, I passed the window of returning it when I got back from vacation, but I won’t be wearing it again. This type of top should be great for summer etc but I couldn’t stand the feeling of this top at all… Seriously feels like something for the kitchen !"
2.0,"The stud bars came discolored, looks tarnished. Tried to polish but did not help."
2.0,"The face of the watch is very nice but the strap is misleading, not at the same quality of the watch, and frankly makes it look cheap."
2.0,According to my alteration shop there was not enough fabric for the bottom so I had to purchase fabric for the waist.
2.0,"In the first pic, the zipper is a dual function zipper, meaning it can zip both up and down. That is the reason I bought it.  However, upon arrival, it had a single action zipper. I checked the photos again and there it was, the third pic on the listing was the actual zipper the promotional photo had the dual function zipper. Shame on this misleading post."
2.0,The can's lid was cross threaded on the can lost about a third to half that leaked out. Next time I will visit a redwing dealer.
2.0,"I ordered two of these. Luckily I didn't pay much. It's beautiful at a distance, but poorly made. The pearls are hand sewn and the string holding them is loose and cheap. I can't believe the poor workman ship on it."
2.0,"It is to short, and fits like a med. I ordered a xl."
2.0,Cute but the sizing is off- I have to return these and possible buy new ones if they can be delivered in time for our VK
2.0,"Arrived with huge snags across the waist, like someone snagged it with a belt and then returned it  So disappointed. Returning."
2.0,"I ordered this jacket in white/ivory because I already have it in fuchsia, and that one fits perfectly. However, the white one had extremely long sleeves on it for some reason, that came past my fingertips. I look like a little kid playing dress up in my mother’s clothes. It’s super disappointing, because I thought I’d be getting a jacket exactly like the one I already have."
2.0,Nice bag.  But airlines broke off one wheel on fourth use.  Hard to tell if it what the bag or the airlines at fault.  Very inconvenient with only three wheels.
2.0,Runs small. Order a size up. It’s not stretchy at all.
2.0,"Size down!!! I usually wear a large to an x-large. I got the X-large just to be safe, and it's huge!!! I could have done with a medium."
2.0,Clasp broke the first time I used it. It's sitting in my jewelry chest having never been worn. Surprising since TBF is usually okay.
2.0,"Low quality , don't fit right"
2.0,So tiny & thin makes it very difficult to lock the hoop!
2.0,Runs very small. I got an extra large and I usually can wear a 12 to 14. Also very sheer so a tank or camisole needed under it.
2.0,I'm returning this because the zipper sticks but hopefully I just got a bad one. It fits my iPhone 6 with a slim case but it definitely wouldn't fit a 6 Plus. It also only has 3 card slots. Not nearly enough.
2.0,Fabric felt cheap
2.0,Very cute but the sizing is way off.
2.0,I  hated this watch right out of the box. It is listed as #1 seller in mens watches. I just lost my other Casio which by the way was a great watch. This thing shows up and I pull it out of the box. The band only reaches 2/3 around my wrist and I don't have big wrists. I threw it in the trash where it belongs.
2.0,One month and the holes are pulling through.  Doesnt hold up well
2.0,doesn't stay on your ear
2.0,"I've used Croakies for 20 years.  I thought this is what I ordered but decided to give this a try.  This is too much.....too wide, too much material folded over on the ends making it too bulky against your head, and too long allowing the glasses to bounce around when being active."
2.0,"The material and the shirt itself are fine but it does not stay buttoned. I found myself buttoning my shirt all day long. It fits just fine actually,  it’s a little loose but the buttons and fabric are poor quality. Wouldn’t recommend."
2.0,The dress is two different shades. The top lace part is an entirely different shade than the rest of the dress and it isn't just a slight shade off. It's so noticeable that we're returning the dress. So disappointed
2.0,Very uncomfortable fabric.  Feels very scratchy.  Terrible when your thighs rub together.  Sizing guide was correct at least.
2.0,"It discolored right away, I only wore it a couple times."
2.0,"Looked nice, but it broke while she was taking it off the very first time she wore it."
2.0,"I really like the bag, fits a lot of stuff but still compact enough that it's not too huge to carry around.  The shoe compartment fits Dansko clogs and flip flops at the same time (so it's rather large) and the bag still fits a change of gym clothes, toiletries, a water bottle, and a hoodie.  I would have given 4 or 5 stars but the zipper broke fairly soon after I got it, but outside of the 30 day window for returns. Luckily there are two zippers (just one wasn't functional) so i can still use it, but still annoying that one of the zipper pulls is off the track and doesn't work and if i'm not careful the other might as well because one of the ends of the zippers isn't properly sewed down."
2.0,Color scrapes right off
2.0,Not for all body types
2.0,This is a nice top but I don't think it should be considered tunic length. The front of it looks great but the back of the shirt had a weird irregular cut.
2.0,Not made wrll
2.0,The material is not what I expected! It feels weird to me and too thick! It looks cheap.
2.0,"Please be aware that the necklace albeit a nice necklace is completely black with no colors in the beads as indicated in the picture. There is no blue tint to the large beads, no multicolor to the smaller beads. I ordered this for my niece as the colors on the display bust are ones that she would love. Again, the necklace quality is nice but it looks like a completely different necklace. See attached photo. Thanks!"
2.0,"one side did not clip onto the device very well and caused many issues. got it for the clasp, stopped using it because the clip to the device never worked right and caused it to fall off my wrist and get damaged."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:1582e9ffaae3584be2e5b8f109d0ef1e]] I bought these for my mom and I and because I'm going away soon and when I went to give them to my mom the wording was on the outside of one bracket and the other one came in correctly it was very annoying and I was kinda sad because she's wanted one of these brackets for so long and it came in wrong!!! Honestly I want my money back, but I'm not going to return them because I waited so long for them."
2.0,"its tempting to put your ATM card under it which will kill it, but it did help my brother since he wanted a small wallet. Craftmanship is good."
2.0,Fit was awkward and the sole was narrow.  The leather would touch the ground when I stepped.  Returned.
2.0,"Came early that was good, but the dress came with some holes around, beautiful dress"
2.0,Not very stretchy or comfortable material.
2.0,Workout or spandex-like material. Looks very cheap. Sent back
2.0,"Cute & comfy at first but fit a little smaller than expected. It was recommended I buy an XL but I was worried about shrinkage so I bought an XXL just in case. First wash (cold water, hung to dry) and it’s shrunk up enough it could be an XL or maybe even a L. I’m pretty bummed."
2.0,My daughter wore it one day and the chain broke while she was running in PE class. A little disapointing.
2.0,wanted umbrella with white pole
2.0,I bought these for my pre-teen daughter and the sole started separating from the shoe after she wore them only a few times.
2.0,Runs very loose. Somehow didn’t like the fit
2.0,Don't expect too much. Although these chokers are cute they are very small and cheaply made. Most I ended up giving to my 10yo. One had a broken clasp and the other was already coming apart at the seems. I didn't expect very much since the cost was so little but I expected them to at least be whole. I guess I'll spend the extra money and buy a choker that I know for sure won't fall apart the same day.
2.0,Thin<br />See thru back
2.0,"Great material and fit, but the pattern doesn't match up at the seams-messy."
2.0,"I was so excited the first time I wore this!  Fit nice and felt lovely.  Then I washed it, and I never wore it again-because The pet hair will not come off of it.  If you don't have pets I say great buy, but if you do have pets, you better get a lint brush!"
2.0,It runs small especially if you have a bigger chest. Its not ling like it looks in the photo and the quality seems pretty cheap. Would not buy again.
2.0,Nice material - but too small for the size it is supposed to fit to.
2.0,"This is my third CocoShip suit. I loved my other two. This one though, despite buying the same size as my others, was much too small. It was very short waisted. It had to go back. :/"
2.0,The stone in this ring looks cheap.  I bought it to give as a gift and after I got it decided not to give it because it looked cheap.
2.0,"Too big, order one size smaller"
2.0,Material looked very Table Clothish. Was very dissapointed
2.0,"The bracelet size was smaller than I thought and the actual symbol on the bracelet was very small, seems more like a womens bracelet maybe?  Also the piece of faux leather broke already where it ties together once you put it on your wrist."
2.0,"I was really disappointed in this shirt.  From the looks of it on the page, it looks to be a thicker material and according to the size chart it should fit right.  I did not like this shirt from the moment I opened it.  The lace string on the front looks very cheesy.  The material is very thin and has no warmth to it at all.  I would suggest ordering 2 sizes up because obviously this comes from China and we all know their sizes are way too small.  I wish this shirt had worked, I ended up donating it to a women's shelter because it did not fit right."
2.0,"In person, the earrings look kind of like sperm, and they don't hang nicely. They twist, so the faces are in back. Also, they are on the heavier side and are uncomfortable for people with sensitive ears. I'm thinking of reworking them into a necklace or something."
2.0,Measurements provided do not match the product received. I had upsized from a M to a L to provide extra zoom but it ran so small I needed to reorder in an XL! Even shirt in XL fits like a small and I could not even put on the size L shirt or buckle the coat. For reference I normally wear size 8 or 29 inch waist and M in tops/36 inch chest. I am now waiting for a prepaid return label to send it back because the customer should not have to pay for shipping to China when the issue is due to the seller.
2.0,"These pants are very comfortable. The only issue is that the elastic around the waist is thin, wide, and cheap. The elastic twisted by the 2nd time I wore it. It was made cheaply."
2.0,These are much thinner than I had hoped. They do not offer any cushion when wearing work boots or just walking around the house. They miss the mark having the Dewalt name.
2.0,"a little too loose on the front straps, they look a little cheap...not ordering it again"
2.0,"half of these earring cannot clasp properly, i already lost one out of two pairs just walking down the road like wth"
2.0,horrible material i waited a month for this and i have prime. Itchy material i do not recommend this for babys
2.0,"I Really wanted to love this wallet, Really nice design, but after about 6 months, it's beens starting to fall apart. Maybe it's just the one that i have. Hopefully they can send me a new one :("
2.0,For me. It way too short although I have big boobs. Maybe it's better for smaller chests.
2.0,"Bought a medium, fits more like a large and leg length is not long enough"
2.0,I give someone like a gift because it's too small for my niece
2.0,Pretty pathetic. These aren’t good enough to use as a real football official like I am.  The flags aren’t even weighted. Skip it unless you like to waste your money. If you’re buying this as a gag then it’s fine.
2.0,"Way too small, sized for youth"
2.0,"I bought these for my daughter and they fit perfect, the problem is that the way they are ""stapled"" together with those annoying little tags. They are stapled on each side and in the middle and it leaves holes on the front and back of each pair. Which renders them unwanted to me because I don't want brand new underwear with holes all in them. Packaging needs to be way better. Returning."
2.0,"5’3, 160lb built curvy, like to lift. These are not squat proof. Returned immediately. Fit was high rise and tbh, I looked good. But you could see everything."
2.0,Already had a stone fall out and only wore it like 8 times
2.0,Had to return these pajamas. They felt like plastic.
2.0,"Though very pretty, the nibs are WAY too small, and can slip through the button hole.  Also, apparently the point ends hurt."
2.0,"Boots had a terrible smell even after airing out in garage over night. Also, the leather doesn't look genuine."
2.0,The lenses are not a tight fit. I don’t believe these lenses were made for Oakley half jacket frames
2.0,"This looks like an A-line, which is my jam. But it's not. It didn't fit well, even after I got all the straps adjusted. Disappointed. Sorry to leave a poor review. That was my experience."
2.0,its so nice but i feel like it looks like a blanket on me
2.0,The watch was a good looking watch but the instructions were not at all clear or understandable
2.0,"I just got this super cute blanket hoodie (the fox print). It is very lightweight and has no lining. It’s pretty cheaply made and there are flaws in the fabric on the front pocket. However, as I wear it and type this, it is warm. I’ll keep it a day or two and decide if it was worth the cost."
2.0,these were huge on me and the gold metal is just painted on.
2.0,Quality is not so great. Bought this in May 2018 and one of the bows fell off in July 2018. Otherwise my daughter loves these shoes.
2.0,Sleeves off the shoulder are too large.  They are not fitted as it shows in the picture.
2.0,Super cheap looking. Theres loose threads all over the fuzzy part. The links are cheap and come apart easily. Not to mention the package was wide open when I got it.
2.0,"We tried 3 times to get the right size. The top was too small the bottom to big.  This is the 3rd time to return it. So,  We're just gonna buy separates at the store."
2.0,smell weird
2.0,"Poor quality, piece of metal sticking out on the top, some lacing were coming off (had to cut of and pull out a part of it). Would not buy again, in fact, I would like to return mine."
2.0,The color was way off than what was shown. The waist band I didn't care for it was not button closed it was elastic which bunches up and was not smooth
2.0,"It says it was suppose to be light weight, but it is too heavy.  I need a light one to wear in my classroom"
2.0,"They are tight around the legs and very thick. I bought them for postpartum, but now I don’t think that they will work as I was hoping."
2.0,Very sturdy. Wish it opened though.
2.0,I liked the style but it was too big in the top and fit perfect in the bottom. So I had to return it
2.0,"The foam inside is not memory foam. It makes that “crunchy” sound when you walk, if that helps with the vibe of the padding. They are okay! They do the job of being slightly more comfortable than just walking on your floor. But at $10, what more can you expect"
2.0,This did not fit well on my ear (too big) and doesn't look good. It looks like I have a bluetooth on my ear which I find unattractive.
2.0,I got this in an XXL so it would be oversized and loose. It barely fits my sister who wears a M/L.
2.0,even anti spray I still could not stop the fog on the leness .
2.0,I love the earrings from a far but they constantly open. Maybe a mistake to buy 2 of the blue and 2 of the rose gold. Now I have one of each because they kept falling out
2.0,"I REALLY love this dress but when I opened it, there was no zipper on the back. Hopefully I can get it replaced with a working version!"
2.0,This shirt looks nothing like the picture. Looks very cheap and tacky. I was super dissapointed. I returned it. It runs small as well.
2.0,Disappointed that after the first wear it developed discoloration where the seat belt was.
2.0,The shirt was low quality material for the price  didn't like it
2.0,"This is a pretty dress, but it must be intended for a way way bigger bust size. While the rest of the dress fits well (I'm a size 12), the beige fabric on the front probably needs a bra size E - I'm a C-D, and that is clearly not enough for that dress."
2.0,Both were cute but got a terrible metal taste any time you ate or drank something warm even after cleaning them several times
2.0,Nice coat but it Runs way to small had to send it back
2.0,"In the product photo it looks like a cute zipper front bodysuit. In reality it looks as if the zipper was sown on to the back of the garment and then turned around to the front. Once you put it on, it looks like you are wearing it backwards. Hard to explain it just doesn't look and/or fit right."
2.0,cute but very cheap looking
2.0,Somewhat large.  I'll use it as a nightgown.
2.0,"Very long and narrow, the lace part is a little tight and I sized up"
2.0,I've had one of these for over a year.  I rarely use it anymore because it is very finicky and jams easily.  There are better options out there now for assist in loading 10/22 magazines.
2.0,Too small. The color didn't match what is pictured. The material had a funny smell to it.
2.0,"Beautiful dress, fits more for a church type style. Was looking for homecoming dress"
2.0,Run very small and narrow.
2.0,This was smaller than expected
2.0,The metal parts turned with first use
2.0,"I was in hopes that I would like this item more than I do. There is more black in it than what shows in the listing pictures. It looks like some kind of coyote or something, which is not necessarily appealing. It sheds as well. I don’t show where it is made, but I can only assume China. It’s just too bizarre for my taste. I would hate to think what it looks like when it gets wet."
2.0,Doesn't appear perfectly as shown but is awesome and looks great anyways
2.0,"Not very comfortable, and the rubber is a hassle staying on and replacing."
2.0,"Should have listened to reviews. Ordered 2, 2 packs the grey & white capris. Both white have holes in them and sewn together wrong. The fit is flattering but the waist goes so far up that it sits just below my sports bra. Super disappointed as I bought 2 pair. Save your money for $23.00 you can get 1 nice pair somewhere else. Totally bummed. Listen to the reviews people! Plus the crotch seems really long. I'm 5'4, 135lbs & athletic build."
2.0,"These have a satiny feel and are loose fitting. Buy a size down if you want a tighter fit. Length is fine for me, but probably a bit short for most people."
2.0,"I thought I was getting three packages of different size D rings.  Instead I got three packages of one size, and not the most usable size.  I really have no use for so many all the same size."
2.0,"Very cheap looking, look like slippers. For $30 you can get cabelas."
2.0,"This unisex watch band which I purchased for my yard me  four  the bands were to short.. I believe they offered a $2.00 rebate,, forget it!!!Clif kappedahl"
2.0,Very stiff! Almost like fur glued to cardboard. I am also pretty petite and ordered a medium and it still felt small. I returned!
2.0,"A little disappointed in quality and color.  Very odd brown color, cheaply made.  I'm a bit worried about it falling apart if I wash it.  Super thin materials"
2.0,Not using these and could not send back. Cheaply made.
2.0,"Very light weight, I never write reviews but I would never order these again.  They feel like the ones at the dollar store save your money and get a decent pair.  I have a small face they won’t even stay on."
2.0,"The slots for credit cards are too small. It also has strong smell that I could never get past. IT is a good color and light weight, but I couldn't use it."
2.0,"It's too small fir adult, it made for little kids, my went to my 6 years old granddaughter"
2.0,very cheaply made poor quality start falling apart only after a month of use.pay a little extra money and buy a better bag.definitely not this one!
2.0,Unless you are a young lady or have a VERY short torso this will not fit you. It’s cute but will be handed down to my daughter in a couple years. It also took forever to arrive because of where it is shipping from.
2.0,This item was very cute for my Newborn’s first Thanksgiving but the decal started peeling off before the end of the day. It was also very big for him. I’ve put it away in hope he can use it next year. Overall it was poor quality but you get what you put into it I guess.
2.0,"The fabric easily wrinkles and was impossible to iron due to the design/side zipper.  It also is large in the back area, there's too much material on the back of my neck to be flattering.  I am 5'3&#34;, 135 lbs/fit,  size 2, and a 32b, perhaps if it came in an extra small it would have fit better.  Other than that, it is a cute dress.  I would also recommend buying a crinoline that is at least 26&#34;."
2.0,"Not at all what I thought it would be.  It looked cheap and plasticky.  Even considering that this purse was inexpensive, I was still disappointed. Very disappointed.  It looked cheap, was much smaller inside than it seemed it would be from the picture and because the sides curve in, it holds very little."
2.0,"The necklace is beautiful,but broke within a week."
2.0,I was not thrilled with this dress. It looks great in the pictures but it lays weird on my body. It’s too big under the arms but I would be swimming in the next size up.
2.0,Nice mid weight riding gloves seem fairly warm maybe down to the 40s.  Definitely not waterproof as I just rode an hour in the rain and they are dripping wet inside and out.
2.0,"I purchased Blowfish wolf grey shoes , and when they arrived they weren’t in an original blowfish box . They arrived in a makeshift cardboard box . The shoes looked like they had been at the very least tried on a couple of times by people . I ordered a nine as that is the size of all of my blowfish shoes . This pair did not fit . I checked the size . The size read size 9 . My toes were very crowded in them . I was going to return them , but decided to let my daughter try them on . They fit her !! She wears a size 8 !! I am certain that Zappos sold me rejected shoes from the manufacturer that should have been returned to them  at the original retail price of $49.99 . I will not order from Zappos again !!! I guess the bright note in all of this is the shoes fit my daughter.."
2.0,I normally love Miusol clothing...but this dress wasn't made well. There was a hole between the bottom of the zipper and the dress over the butt area
2.0,"Doesn't feel like bamboo to me.  Just like tight, smooth knit like polysester socks. Not cool looking either, not loose open knit, and also narrow.  Stretchy but would not even attempt to try them on wide ankles and calves.  The colors are beautiful in the assorted. I wish they were wide knit bamboo style socks like other brands."
2.0,"I belong to a dancing witches group and I really wanted to wear this hat for a performance that we participated in with a 70s tie dye theme. The colors are perfect to go with the rest of my costume. The hat is felted and the colors are nice and bright but it’s huge, The top part, even when it’s pushed in, is really long and the hat is too heavy to wear. I guess it’s OK just for pictures but I’ll just have to give it away."
2.0,This jacket is too tight across the shoulders even when ordering in size large.  My daughter who is typically a ladies small to medium loves the look of the jacket but even the Large is way too tight across the shoulders and arms.
2.0,Top not as expected. No way to wear bra. Just an oddly placed piece of fabric covering bust.
2.0,El color no era el mismo de la foto
2.0,Beautiful dress but way too big and came damaged. I feel like Amazon has lost quality over the last yr at least. I just feel like there’s constant issues with third-party sellers.
2.0,"I loved the color and style, the dress was too small when I tried it on and I need to go up a size. But I will still buy the dress again."
2.0,Ordered a size up like everyone suggested.  Waist fit perfect but there is no room in the crotch to move .  Would not order again they do not fit right.<br />Material seems to be really nice so giving 2 stars
2.0,"So uncomfortable. Even wearing them only a couple of hours, when I take them off I’m sore. The padding is uncomfortable, the lace is very itchy, it doesn’t fit right in any fashion - and I got my verified actually measured bra size. A real case of you get what you pay for."
2.0,The color was disgusting - like faded purple.
2.0,"This is not really a &#34;bracelet&#34;. Way too long for a normal man size hand, and the string is not stretch material. Not ready to wear and awful due to the excessive length."
2.0,way too large. sent back.  The look was nice
2.0,"The sleeves are nit really a “balloon” or “lantern” style as advertised, which makes the all difference.  The sleeves are not that wide in the end as shown in the advertising picture.  Also, the texture of knitting much smaller and is not the same as on the advertised picture.  Returning the item. Disappointed."
2.0,"Love the shirt,,,,but it shrank after being washed in cold water and hung up to dry☹️"
2.0,Ripped beltloop within a month
2.0,I read where this fit small so I ordered 1 size up and it was still too small.  2 sizes up may have worked but I didn't want to reorder and take the chance it would be baggy in areas.
2.0,"this will fade away lose colors, deteriorate and become loose in just 4 days Love it at first then it looked pretty lame"
2.0,Not extra deep. At all. Not as adverised
2.0,"not bad shoes but size is big. I'm a 7 which should be a euro 40. I know euro run big so I ordered a 37 and its still a size big.<br />The show is nice but for $110 probably not. I'd say its a $60. If this seller sold them for $60 I might think of buying another pair but not for anything over $60 for the quality you get. And I'm pretty sure they are not leather but PU leather, which is fake leather."
2.0,"I love everything about this top -- except that it's so sheer that I can see even a nude bra through it. Unfortunately, that's a deal breaker for me. I'll have to send the top back."
2.0,Would have been cute but the zipper broke the first time I tried to zip them up
2.0,"Nice shirt, but the measurements are not true to the site description. I'm usually a size 9-10/medium and ordered a large. The chart says it should be 15 3/4&#34; shoulder length. It's actually 22&#34;! And it's stretchy, too. So it's not just too large, it's ridiculously large. So, take a chance if you want, but beware the measurements chart, it's totally off."
2.0,"These arrived with a jewel missing from one earring but I found it in the bag. These are very shiny gold in color, which makes them appear more like costume jewelry and less vintage."
2.0,Came apart after wearing it twice
2.0,Too Stiff
2.0,"I have been looking at this shirt for so long and finally ordered. With so much of excitement I opened it but it did disappointed me. The finishing is not at all competed. I still see threads lying there. The buttons are not stitched properly, it will fall down in one use may be. I see double hemming in some areas. Finally it did not satisfy me."
2.0,"The photo looked so promising but in reality they arrived with the boot shaft folded in half, much wider than expected in the ankle. Fit okay  in the foot but the seam down front center makes the faux leather really obvious and looks cheap. Unfortunately returned!"
2.0,you get what you pay for.  Looks so cute on the model.
2.0,Ran a little smaller than the wool shoes
2.0,"Sorry, but I thought they looked and felt really cheap."
2.0,"Ordered Xl, but more like a medium."
2.0,This belly button tarnished with in a few days of being worn.  Not very please at all.
2.0,The fabric was see through
2.0,not adjustable to hold to ear
2.0,Cute but like everyone else says... they’re lying about them being surgical steel. Surgical steel does not tarnish and turn your skin green. Amazon needs to correct this sellers claims.
2.0,Like everyone said...which i missed before ordering its so uneven and on top of that mine came all bent in a weird way highly disappointed
2.0,Los colores de la foto son más oscuros .. la calidad no es muy buena
2.0,Broke right after I received it. Was pretty.
2.0,"Beware, buyers:<br />This is a cheap watch. Here are the issues with it:<br />1) a random red line that completely ruins the design on the back of it<br />2) it's &#34;one size fits all&#34; although that is not the case whatsoever<br />3) it is very flimsy and poor quality<br />The only reason I'm giving it two stars is I like the design of the clock element on it (nothing else).<br />Do not buy this watch; seriously, save the extra $20 and buy something legitimate."
2.0,Was definitely expecting better quality for the price. These are the same bracelets you would find in .25 machines at a pizza parlor.
2.0,"Not flowy like the picture, fits more like a body con/ party dress instead of summer dress"
2.0,"I think it's probably more because my body type is super curvy, but I did not like how these fit me at all. Way too small, showed my love handles hard-core. They're cute, but not a good fit for me."
2.0,"I ordered these initially in the green in an XS/S because the sizing guide on the company's website put me in that range (28"" waist, 38"" hip, 5'8"", 135 lb). They did not fit. I got them on, but the wasitband was around my hips and they were crop length, and they were not even pretending to be squat-proof (how could they be, with such a shortage of fabric?). So I reordered them in grey in a M/L, and they did *mostly* fit, and they are 96-ish% squat-proof; however. They didn't fit they way they should. The material on these is stiff (and itchy) -- not nearly stretchy enough through the hips and thighs. I did the squat test and was honestly afraid I was going to split them right down the back center. A workout legging needs to be supple and flexible. Also, either with the way the legging is cut or maybe just because of the fabric composition, there's simply not enough fabric to cover the bum, so the waistband ends up riding really low in back, and high in front (like it's supposed to) for an awkward look all around. The M/L were also too short (like a 7/8 length instead of full length).<br />@JedNorth if you made these more supple, truly squat-proof, and softer people would buy the heck out of them, because at $30 they're super affordable and v cute. Just not good enough as is, though.<br />If you are a more delicate body shape than me and don't have sensitive skin, you might really like these."
2.0,"Looks good as an undershirt since it's collar stays flat all the time, but the arm holes are slightly undersized. They squeeze my armpit a little tighter than I would like, and cause chafing after a long day so I stopped wearing it. I ordered the same size shirt as I normally wear. And I understand it's a compression shirt so it's meant to be tight. I'm specifically talking about the size of the arm hole."
2.0,The logo on the side is a STICKER that you have to put on. The glasses are fine... but super disappointed.
2.0,Its not comfortable at all. The sides have a piece that is so uncomfortable and bends into your skin. Would not recommend it
2.0,Extremely short. I was hoping to wear around before going to beach but it would have just looked awful. Would be fine if you were just going to beach.
2.0,"These bands are difficult to take off the watch.  I am nervous they will become stuck or break. So, I would say this is not something I would purchase or recommend."
2.0,Stone fell out first day
2.0,"Would be better if the chest fit right & the pattern was made for larger sizes. Typical of Chinese construction: poorly made. It was &#34;ok&#34; on my friend, but even then, I'd have to make a few corrections with my sewing machine."
2.0,"I like the skirt. It is pretty shiny though, which I did not think it would be seeing the pictures they posted. It has an elastic band, which I also was not expecting which might be good for some but I did not like that feature."
2.0,"This fit really oddly across the bust, and I had to put in darts to make it wearable. But it is super cute, and looks good with the alterations. I did not get the newer version of the dress. I would give this 2 1/2 stars, if I could. I don't like having to spend half an hour modifying some thing I payed almost $15 for."
2.0,The sleeves are awkwardly short for boys and the shorts color is fading after washing. Overall it’s a poor quality product which is not worth even tho it’s not expensive
2.0,"The material is okay. Please note this top is very large I should have sized down. Ordered a size large, 5’7” 155-160 lbs. I’ll be wearing this to bed."
2.0,Looks nice but itchy had to put tape inside the vans so it would itch my forehead
2.0,"The buckle used to adjust the size of the band disengages easily enough to slide around, but once you try and re-lock it, it won't budge.  I've been trying since last night I can't get it to lock.  I'm not new to this I've had several mesh metal bands including Skagen and third party brands off Amazon, this is a different story."
2.0,"Am I the only one that feels like this is half a hat? The embroidery is beautiful. However, the hat stops at the top of the head and there is nothing in the back. It is held together by a cheap plastic strap. It looks weird to me."
2.0,"A satin shirt to put under is needed and that isnt easy to find. Very cheap construction, but hey, its only for a few hours per year."
2.0,Cheap product and no where near correct on the US sizing chart. Don’t recommend.
2.0,"Ok so it's super cute and I really do love the look, but the bar is so short it keeps stabbing my stomach to the point it's not comfortable to wear. If the bar was longer this wouldn't be an issue."
2.0,"Bar is way too small for an adult, I gave it to my 12 year old"
2.0,I ended up returning this because the top ended up being way too small. But the top is very difficult to figure out how to get on without any kind of instructions on where to tie any of the 4 ties.
2.0,"Nice comfortable socks, my kid likes them. They don't stay up as well as I hoped. The colors are really fun. They are NOT wool as the description states. A very soft blend of something, probably cotton. They don't keep feet warm as well as wool would. We don't use them for cold weather."
2.0,"They are nice for me because I have a small face and they got tight but they are also a tiny bit crooked. The worst part is that they leave a black residue on my face giving me a unibrow!!!! The first time I tried them on m boyfriend would not tell me why he was laughing so hard but I soon found out. I tried washing them off but they still sometimes leave me looking like I have dirt on my face. As far as I can tell, this is provoked by me sweating because its not every time I wear them. I wouldn't buy these again."
2.0,"Very bad quality, my daughter was very excited waiting her watch for Christmas, the screen is bad quality, and it has a lot restrictions, not to much to do with this watch, is bored.  I bought the lol watch for my 7 years old daughter and the vetch watch for 9 years old daughter. in my opinion vetch watch is the best!"
2.0,"Size up 2 sizes. 48 fits like size US 10 and that is the larger size they come in. I am a US 12 and 48 di not fit.  These pants are NOT built for curvy women.  if yo7 are curvy with a buddy, these are likely not for you. They are built boxier."
2.0,"Loved the look of this band and loved to wear it. I only wore it on weekends, never to work, so it didn't get a ton of use. However, it still broke suddenly one Sunday afternoon. So disappointing. Now I'm on the hunt for another one obviously from a different source."
2.0,tight in axilla.
2.0,If I had seen this in a real store I would never have bought it.  Its made so cheaply it won't last a month or two at the most.  I will never wear this thing.......
2.0,"Very cute, but MUCH bigger than just a stud earring."
2.0,"The sweater is very pretty and soft, however it fits tight around the stomach. I don't recommend this look unless you have a tiny waist."
2.0,"Color, and style are great but the material is thin!"
2.0,It was great until the seam started to come off the stitches were coming unloosed
2.0,"Not bad, doesn't hold the shine very well.  Price was great and it looked incredible when it arrived but he shine faded very quickly and cleaning it doesn't help.  Too bad to because it really is a nice piece of jewelry but the overall quality is just lacking."
2.0,This brought is super flimsy and not very supportive at all. The clasp in the center is really cheap it feels like I could just snap it in half with my fingers. Overall this isn't an impressive bra.
2.0,NOT WELL MADE!
2.0,Like the pearl but don’t like the necklace length it’s literally like a  choker  and it don’t say it is.
2.0,I wanted to wear it to work today and when I went to put it on it was coming a part already .
2.0,"I bought the size 6 for my 5 yr old (she is short for her age but wanted something that she could wear into next year).  It fit perfectly the 1st time she wore it and colors were great.  After 1 wash, it shrunk to where it no longer fits her and the color all washed out.  It looks like it's been worn 50 times and was only worn once.  I'm very disappointed in the quality of the product.  Also FYI- I washed in cold water and dried on low heat."
2.0,This does not look like the picture! Had I liked it I would have bought it in black. I kinda feel like this is cheaply made. It would work well for a swim suit cover up but that's about all I'll wear it for.
2.0,It's very cheaply made.  The material is hard to open without tearing mask. The desert heat makes it stick and hard to open to Wear
2.0,"I like art, but the strings didn't last long. I wore it two times."
2.0,"Way too low cut, material feels great but the chest area didn’t cover at all very sad because I was so excited. May stitch it to make it work."
2.0,Doesn’t look anything like the photo. Runs a bit large in the top and tight in the middle. Pockets make it bulky.
2.0,Don’t waist your money!
2.0,"I found this shirt to have a strange fit and thought it was not flattering.  Was looking for something to wear with leggings, but returned this one.  Not very good quality or material.  Looks cheap."
2.0,It's nice but the ribbons wouldn't pop open so I had to return it back to Amazon.
2.0,Large looks like extra small
2.0,"I purchased this bag after reading all of the positive reviews, but was disappointed once I received it.  I was impressed with the look, but the description listed POCKETS: 1 Exterior Back Zipper Pocket,1 Interior Zipper Pocket and 2 Interior Open Pockets.  This bag only had the one interior zipper pocket and nothing else.  I am returning it."
2.0,"The size charts are way off. I’m used to this for women’s clothes but men’s are usually closer. My husband wears a XLT and the 4X would even go around his waist. Strangely this is bigger in the chest areas than below. My 12 year old son can wear it. It’s big on him, but closer sit than the adults. Super disappointed."
2.0,its lighter and sheer like a cheap tank top
2.0,"would not recommend unless you are looking for a very thin chain.  have not worn it, as not strong enough to hold anything"
2.0,Unfortunately they started to lose thier GOLD color in about a week - they basically look silver now. You can see in the photos where the inside is still shiny gold and the outside is flat silver.
2.0,"These were way too small. I wear a women's size 9 and they were too small for me. They look like they could be okay slippers, but definitely not made for men."
2.0,after 5 times worn they developed holes at the toes on both socks
2.0,"Sure , It's cute but it breaks easily . The actual filter of the mask is in wrong so make sure you put it in right before wearing it.<br /><br />It's heavy on your face and sits funny."
2.0,Shirt was not what expected and I was bummed when it didn’t fit.
2.0,Very thin material - I ended up returning the dress b/c you can see straight through it.
2.0,The earrings are the size that I expected. The clasp is very flimsy which makes it difficult to latch and unlatch.
2.0,Cool as novelty. Would be cooler if it was actually embroidered. Just a small patch half sewn on to a basic black beanie.
2.0,"I was originally looking for transition lenses for when my husband and I go ridding. However apparently no one makes women’s glasses that aren’t pink or super expensive for either transition lenses or glasses with lenses you can take in and out that don’t cost a fortune. (They make men’s but that’s a different story) I settled for these because they had all 3 in one package. The fit is ok, the color is unflattering but they will do what I need them to do. I will be on the look out for better fitting ones."
2.0,Loved the top. Bottom floaty and nicely done. Unfortunately it was cut very small. I could not zip it up in the back. Hoping a seamstress can make some alterations to make it fit. I am a 4-6 us size and ordered their size 6.
2.0,"Strap is good nice and soft. However, it smells so bad i couldn't stand it not even for band practice. it smells like dead fish/shrimp if you like the smell you'll love the strap otherwise stay away..."
2.0,Dress was too short and 5'6''
2.0,These looked like men’s pants.. very unhappy with this product.. gave it to my husband and they fit him perfect.. would not buy again….
2.0,"The leggings are very soft and they fit, but they sent a print that I did not order. The ones I ordered were “Far Out Fun” and they were very colorful and pretty. They sent me a black and white pair called “Black and White Abstract.” Not what I was looking forward to. But it is too much trouble to send them back, so I will keep them. But I will probably order from someone else next time to try and get what I want instead of someone just grabbing one that is the correct size and not caring whether or not I have the correct print or not. 2 stars for bad customer service."
2.0,feel apart !after only a couple wears...
2.0,"The dress was beautiful, I had to return die to the bust was to small. The rest of the dress fit perfect. I ordered a Large, but I am a 40 D."
2.0,Cute dress for someone a foot taller than me with tiny little boobs!  Must be tall and very slim....
2.0,The black enamel is lumpy and has what looks like scoops taken out of it. I'm not impressed.
2.0,"The anklet is good quality, but it’s very, very thin and more suitable for a little girl.  The dolphins themselves are one-sided, and the back flips to the front often when wearing.  If you look closely at the photo, two of the dolphin charms are flipped over and look like crescents instead of dolphins."
2.0,"It is what it is,nothing to write home about."
2.0,"I bought these for my 8 month old daughter with cochlear implants and I wish I had saved my money. The pocket that holds the processors is not designed well and doesn’t actually keep the processors in the headband - they slip out constantly which makes them pointless as a retention device. And since the pockets are sewn into the headband, this means you can’t adjust where the processor sits on the child’s head, and on my daughter they say right on top of her ear rather than just behind the ear, which I know would not be comfortable. I highly recommend going with Ear Suspenders instead!"
2.0,"This was extremely large. I am a size large and I had to hem this dress 3"" on each side."
2.0,Definitely meant for someone with baby ankles. This was way to small for my roommate.
2.0,I pull them up 20 times a day.
2.0,"They aren’t bright enough to adequately light a dark hallway in my home.<br /><br />The different units have noticeably different brightnesses.<br /><br />The housing is cheap and feels like it’ll fail if I look at it too hard.<br /><br />MicroUSB is a terrible thing that should never ever be used anymore by anyone for anything, and I’m not sure if this will break faster than aggressively staring at the housing.<br /><br />This is something that is best as an idea, but should not be produced until it does a job well and does the job efficiently. It might have a price premium, but that’s the cost of quality.<br /><br />That said, these were twice the price they should be.<br /><br />I guess I’ll give them some credit though. They’re decent for camping if you need a light in your tent."
2.0,Looks cute but cant hold alot of cards and close
2.0,"Looking for size 11.  Tried 11, too small, returned.  Tried 12, still too small (hardly any bigger), returning.  Third time's the charm?<br />Edit:  Nope.  13 seems about the same size as 11 and 12 (which is probably more like 10-10.5).  I'm giving up on these."
2.0,These are cute but tiny and I won't wear them.  Not sure where they get a 4&#34; measurement from but they are maybe a little over an inch long.  Will give them to my mom.  Disappointed.
2.0,"They fit as expected. Were nice a tight for compression but they are pretty thin so not great for really cold weather and they ride up as I'm running, which is really aggravating. They also have an odd like chemical smell that I can't seem to get rid of even after washing."
2.0,Doesn’t work good on a long beard. Works good on side burn portion of beard.
2.0,I got the largest size I'm normally a 18-20 it fit perfectly and even was a little big in the tummy area but the problem was in the bust. I'm 42DDD and it just wasn't going to work way too much over flow of the boobs so I have to return it. Really pretty though
2.0,I did not like this dress. I thought the fabric was too thin and flimsy. I feel like if you wore this it'd be wrinkly 24/7 and I just wasn't into that. It's a shame because the colors and prints are cute.
2.0,Looked cheaply made. Daughter using for a themed sweet 16 but did not like it. Returned.
2.0,"The bag is cute, but handle broke off on 3 rd wear."
2.0,It goes rusty after a month or two.
2.0,"Made nice but a little disappointed ran small, other than nice for the price...."
2.0,"It fits fine but,the lense is smaller than original. They look like women’s or kids size! Thanks"
2.0,Very small. Ended up not wearing them
2.0,"Not very sturdy, rather cheaply made. They will be used for my home office desk work only. I was going to return them but for under $20 I should have known better.  Honestly can’t recommend."
2.0,I bought the white dress. Feels baggy and cheap
2.0,"Thank goodness I read the other reviews! I normally wear an XL in sweatshirts but had to order a 3XL and it fits slightly larger than an XL. The heart on the sleeve is super cute but that about it. The “iron on” picture on the front is very cheap and plastic and shiny looking. The quality of the sweatshirt is definitely on the low end with very little to no stretch. Thankfully it was a cheap buy, otherwise I’d be returning it!"
2.0,Way too small and too short
2.0,I can’t get them to stay on bc the velcro design isn’t the best and it doesn’t work well. I think if the wash strip was on the other way it may have been better able to work.
2.0,"These glasses broke, shortly after having them. So disappointed, because I like them so much. They snapped in half, even though I take great care of my sunglasses. Tried to super glue them, but they couldn't be repaired."
2.0,"It barely makes a sound, which was the whole point of it."
2.0,At $10 for the desert (closest to OCP) way overpriced.  Be aware that although it's listed as 3&#34; x 2&#34; if it's going over the same size hook and loop square it won't cover the area completely.  Bought it for a hat patch and looks out of place for the reason mentioned.
2.0,Shirt was very short. Pants were okay was still short. Cape and hat were true to the size. Make sure to get 1 size larger than described in sizing chart.
2.0,"I ordered a small and the front of the bottoms were way too big, but the top fit because its adjustable. The sizing is really disproportionate. I read reviews like that before I purchased it but wanted to see for myself."
2.0,Not nearly as long as expected. The chain is also poorly made. I might just throw it out.. haven't decided yet
2.0,"Very narrow through thigh area & very long (I’m 5’9” & I would have needed a 3”+ wedge to wear without dragging. No give in the material. But if you’re very tall & very skinny, would look great: The scallop design was similar to expensive designs seen elsewhere. Returning item. Purchased size large: 170 lbs."
2.0,"Fit super small, order up a size"
2.0,I thought these were wrap around sun glasses.<br />They do not fit comfortable worn over regular glasses
2.0,"Junk. Can barely give it away. Painfully too small for adult American wrists. Do not buy except for children. Priced cheap, but expensive shipping makes it a terrible deal."
2.0,"This item is advertised as ""compression"" but it's not at all. I'm usually a sm-med, so I ordered a small based on other reviews. The sizing ""fits"" but the tank offers zero pressure like a compression tank should, so it definitely feels too big. It's very thin, cool & comfortable, but it shows every curve & roll."
2.0,"if you think of buying it for kids then don't! my daughter never use it, it hurts her ear not even 5 mins of wearing it."
2.0,Cute but was much smaller then expected
2.0,The shoes had a horrible chemical smell and I literally had to soak them in bleach water for days to get rid of it.
2.0,I ordered these socks due to the stadium picture on them. The socks came with the team colors and logo but no stadium on them.
2.0,item runs two sizes small
2.0,I think if you kno you will be selling product to American buyers then you should accommodate to American sizes. Completely luv the style but was too small. So I was inspired to buy a sweat suit and add my own zippers.
2.0,Did not look like the picture at all. And I am a shapely woman.
2.0,"the earrings are not as they are displayed they are actually very very thin and delicate looking not strong and thick as the picture clearly shows them to bee, I expected them to be small of course since they are 3mm but not thin since that is not was is being advertised in the pic, the images are straight tricking the customer, very disappointed."
2.0,I would give the quality 5 stars but the fit was way off. Way too small for a size 5 medium. So
2.0,"When I first wore this under my mask I breathed  better. But as I reused  it(after washing) it became annoying  to wear, no longer use. Also my daughter  who we bought this for, because she sings. She found it very uncomfortable. Liked the concept, not the results."
2.0,Good quality and design but it is way too small. I recommend buying it but definitely 2 sizes larger at least!
2.0,FLIMSY CRAP! WASTE OF MONEY! DO NOT BUY!
2.0,I didn’t realize how small it was
2.0,"Way too small- I actually started laughing while trying to pull them above my knees. I'm 5' 4&#34; and about 150 lbs, so I ordered the M.  That was a joke. Not only that, but the fabric felt scratchy and itchy, unlike most of the reviews I read before purchasing.  There was also a strong chemical smell when I opened the package. I was very disappointed with this product."
2.0,Way too big and the back ties up like a hospital gown. I really like the fabric but the back ties just totally ruin it for me.
2.0,Straps were too loose and thin falls off my shoulders and after two wash it looks like white
2.0,Very pretty....however do not appear to be 16 gauge....
2.0,"My clothes under, and the inside of my boots still get wet"
2.0,"I know the dimensions were given, but it's much smaller than it appears on the mannequin's arm. It will hold a large iPad and a few files, but my 13&#34; laptop doesn't fit. The zipper is already broken. This one, unfortunately, is going back."
2.0,"The front slit glass loosened on both sides after first wear, and the interior of helmet is very uncomfortable to wear and the glass is so dark that it’s almost impossible to see through it in the night (during halloween..)"
2.0,Sizing was off and colors were not as ordered
2.0,Very cheap looking in person and super small
2.0,Nuts worked their way off spikes even after tightening them. I have nuts embedded in my epoxy floor. Also dangerous to wear when spikes come loose.
2.0,Was really looking forward to wearing these on thanksgivings but holy cow they are huge. Might need to get something different.
2.0,"This top looks cute online, but it fits small and the fabric pulls at the top two buttons so you can see through it. Cheaply made"
2.0,I ordered new masks because I didn’t like the pleated masks I already had. The picture does not show the pleats in this mask. The fabric is really pretty but I wasted my money on these masks. Really disappointed that they show a pic that doesn’t represent the actual mask.
2.0,The jacket fits moderately well. But the sleeves are extremely long. Much too long for an average person. And I consider me to be above-average meaning I have long arms.
2.0,Love both pairs when received but the one plain gold has hoop has already stopped latching within 3 time wearing.
2.0,"I purchased 3 packs of the tank tops. when trying on the tanks all 9 fit wildly differently. Some very tight around the shoulders, some tight in the torso. Others fit ok. I would not purchase these again and classify this brand as a D quality of product."
2.0,"These are a knock off. Made in china shipped from china. i got the two pack. the red on had elastic at the top where your hair goes, it stretches but not very much. as for the black one, it was literally a stretchy string at the top! not elastic! Doesn't stretch at all like it should! I was extremely disappointed! returning at once! DO NOT ORDER UNLESS YOU ARE OKAY WITH A KNOCK OFF!"
2.0,"The glass I received was totally different, it was plain black without the Carbon Fibber Pattern..."
2.0,Product arrive with the sleeve undone. I did like the fabric and the size was way too big for me.
2.0,It was an on-line T-shirt...it is as on-line T-shirts are...not of great qualityl
2.0,"This dress is good well, but does not wash well at all. Washed and hung to dry and it all stuck and clung together and won't lay right when wearing anymore!"
2.0,Nice quality band that looks great....until the first time you do anything. Even just putting my hand in my jeans pocket or my gloves left marks on this. I have other very light colored bands and haven't had any issues wearing the same jeans & gloves. Not sure why this one is different but I was extremely disappointed by it.
2.0,"Runs small, very short. Go one size up than you would normally wear."
2.0,"After a month of wearing them, they turned my skin green and the silver wore off"
2.0,"I really like the saying on the shirt! Even though they said it runs small, that was an understatement!!! I ordered a Large, and it still fit like a Small!"
2.0,cute and sexy but runs small and narrow.  color is very red.  seemed more pink to me in the picture but very red.  overall okay.  would have taken it back though if I didn't have to mail it back.  hate doing that so I will keep it but probably won't ever wear it.
2.0,"being as they are made in china, they are too tight and not as long as advertised."
2.0,it's too short and the material is cheap. Wouldnt be able to wear this on a windy day!
2.0,Seams started coming loose after my son wore these 2-3 times
2.0,The material is not a normal workout material.  This seems like it would snag easy.  I am a size 4 and the small was way to tight.  I wear a small in all other workout pants.
2.0,Not what I expected the frame is a little smaller than I like
2.0,For this type of swim suit you will need to alter this to support up top. Wife was pretty disappointed and unable to wear it on vacation. She will alter it and keep it though.
2.0,I expected it to be tight but I normally wear a XL this fit more like a med. but other than it being 2 sizes off the quality is great
2.0,The print on this is really stiff and it fits rather baggy.<br />Nice in theory but I definitely would not buy again.
2.0,"i bought 2 different sandals knowing i’d be going on a long walk soon , the DUINN fit very snug on the toes although the velcro is adjustable they’re not very comfortable my toes were digging into one another only 5 minutes after wearing them around the house to test them , the sole is very comfortable i will say<br />i have thin feet & these just were not it for me"
2.0,These are really huge way too big for me
2.0,I do not like these slippers becaue I have small narrow feet and these are very loose and they slide right off.  They are not all that comfortable.  I would not recommend these.
2.0,I didn't get the long string for the bag...and it is way smaller than it look in the pic
2.0,I was not happy with the quality of this product. The return was very simple and I was refunded quickly.
2.0,It is soft but color is way different. I bought burgundy and it's not like in the picture. It is almost pink
2.0,[[VIDEOID:7a834ccb174c3f66a1e78a821a92e0b9]] Ni le use y se le cayo el broche pesima calidad la.verdas
2.0,More like a long t-shirt made out of swimsuit material
2.0,I got fooled.
2.0,It’s meh.... it is much thicker in real life it’s not sheer like you may think. Very baggy in the midsection if that’s what you’re going for....
2.0,"I was so so super excited for this waist trainer and I hate having to give it two stars!! I have been having some lower back pains the last month and after talking with a co-worker she recommended I try a waist trainer since she has major success with her waist trainer helping her back pain. I did my research and concluded that one with steel bones would be the best fit for me for durability reasons. I got the package Tuesday (3/22/16) at about 6pm. I immediately put the waist trainer on and LOVED it! It resisted when I tried to stick my &#34;gut&#34; out (fyi I am 5'9 160 lbs 31 inch waist so I got a size large and it was on the second row of hooks). It resisted when I tried to bend (but it still would let me) and it corrected my posture. I even had to move my driver seat in my car forward because it corrected my posture so well. I was stoked!!! I wore it for about 3.5 hours the first day I got it. My second day I wore the waist trainer at work all day. Loved it still and my back pain was gone the first day! Went to put it on today and it was stretched out and I could get it on the inner most row of hooks. I didn't expect that two days into having the trainer. I could adjust it easy while it's on my body, and the trainer will actually slide down my body to where it folds up when I sit down. I am super super disappointed about this waist trainer. I paid good money for this product and read all reviews (yes some products work better for other people) and to find out it doesn't even hold up two days into wearing it is a HUGE disappointment.  I don't hate the product, I am just disappointed."
2.0,Eh. Oddly feels Hard.  Feels and looks cheap
2.0,"I guess this is partially my fault for not paying attention, but I assumed that the dress was shown as though a pregnant woman was wearing, not as the material actually hangs. I was not expecting a large, saggy area in the middle and instead assumed that the dress would grow with my stomach as I grew. I'm only 3 months pregnant and not really showing aside from a small bump, and I'm disappointed that I won't be able to wear this until I'm at the end of my pregnancy and fully bumped out unless I want to leave a lot of saggy material in the belly area (note: I do not). Since I won't be larger until the winter, and this dress is very thin and more of a summer dress, I doubt I'll wear it at all. I need to check the return policy."
2.0,Too small & short.
2.0,"Initially I liked these, but all I do now is chase chickens around daily to put them back on. They do not stay on."
2.0,If I didn’t get rid of the packaging I probably would return these earrings. They are so heavy that they pulled forward and my earring backs fell off…on both sides!
2.0,The fit is as expected.  Color is beautiful.  Great Zip pockets.  BUT...I bought it to take on a trip and wanted a WATERPROOF jacket; so I wouldn't need to bring an umbrella too.  Good thing I tried it one rainy day before I left.  I put the hood up to keep my hair dry too; and I was soaked to the bone and I looked like a drowned rat!  This jacket is ABSOLUTELY NOT WATERPROOF.
2.0,"Ordered 2 Bibs ....the Pink long sleeve and the Blue long sleeve. The Pink was great except for the buckle is broken with a chunk missing out of it (shown in pic) so you can't use it. The Blue one had a cracked buckle (shown in pic) and has what looks like yellowish food  stains on the neck, chest and arms and it came balled up and crumpled in the package. Clearly looks used like they sent me a previously used returned bib. VERY Disappointed because I had a deadline and they would have worked great otherwise AND TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE for this price."
2.0,This is a very cool looking belt. That's about the extent of its usefullness. It runs small and is way too flimsy to use for a concealed or open carry. Sending mine back.
2.0,Sleeve is not loose like picture
2.0,"It says so in the description, but I missed it. I thought I was getting a super deal for funko pens.🤣 It is very cool though, I do not regret the purshase."
2.0,looked like it had lint on it because it had Colored Flecks. returned.
2.0,"I had such high hopes for this sports bra. I saw a girl review it on tik tok with a similar body type as myself and it looked so precious. However, my cup size is bigger. I got an extra large, and while the band fits perfectly, there is a TON of spillage. I can’t even try to play it off like there isn’t. If there was a bigger size, it might would fit better. Great quality, nice look, just isn’t for anyone with a bigger cup size."
2.0,"If you are close to my size (5' 7"" and 240lbs) then I don't think these shorts are for you for these reasons:<br />1) It is not flattering if you have a muffin top like me, since the outline shows through the shorts.<br />2) It gave me the most mortifyingly massive cameltoe I've ever had wearing a pair of shorts.<br />3) It came up to the brim of my butt cheeks so when I bent over you could see my underwear.<br />Only reason I didn't give these shorts one star is because they did fit over my hips and waist, but they were the most unflattering shorts for my body type. If you're plus sized like me, you have been warned."
2.0,"I loved this set. The color was right, They were very soft. They were perfect for my trip to Alaska. Good thing I live in Florida, as the gloves started to come unstitched before the end of my vacation. Still love the hat and scarf, but hated to see gloves falling apart in less than 10 days of light use."
2.0,"Item looks very nice but is quite small, probably intended for a teen or a child. Somewhat disappointed"
2.0,"The picture in the ad looks like soft and slouchy cotton but in person, it's a stiff and uncomfortable, jet black skirt."
2.0,"There wasn't enough black in the glass to offset the bright blue.  It wasn't what I was expected.  They are still pretty, just not what I thought I was ordering."
2.0,"Its not as pictured, the top looks cheap."
2.0,Washed once and there was a big hole in it.
2.0,in a couple of hours lost its original color all
2.0,"They're a nice shape, but came without earing backings and the posts were bent and warped. Would return, but they're honestly just in such bad shape that I'm not sure its even possible."
2.0,Not loved the color / finish
2.0,"I ordered the gold scarf, one side is soft and the other not so much. The color is a mustard dark yellow color, definitely not gold so if you want a true gold scarf don't order this. Very poor quality. Much better scarves for hair which are beautiful, high quality, less money and sold on Amazon! Hope this helps."
2.0,Made very cheap and the backing pinches your ears if you don't move the metal piece around correctly to stop pinching. I gave it two stars because of fast shipping.<br /><br />Would not recommend.
2.0,"The fit is really tight, plus the picture shows an  embroider front and sleeves. What I received was an printed front and sleeves. A little disappointed."
2.0,The small would fit someone at least 135 lbs. That's crazy!!
2.0,Did not like top design and transparency of the back of top.
2.0,Not bad quality for what I paid for. My only problem is these came defective. The right lens is twice as dark as the left. It gives you a headache almost instantly. Can't use these at all. Hopefully Yufalling fixes this for me somehow.
2.0,"The material was decent, it had a faint cheapness to it but was not scratchy.  It just fit really weird.  The small was the correct size for me, but the dress just did not flow correctly from the waistline.  Could be cute on a different person, just kind of odd fit on me."
2.0,Simple the product is cheap I wouldn’t buy again you could get this at Rainbow
2.0,Not like the picture AT ALL!
2.0,"2 stars because they are cute, but way,  way  way too small, wouldn't even pass my hips"
2.0,"Don’t buy! The fabric is thin, cheap, and see through.  I tried to return it but shipping cost more than the product. They did end up refunding me 5.00 but the dress cost a lot more than 5.00!! I will also never wear this dress so really it just seems like a loss of money."
2.0,"Just received quickly...  Black fabric with white liner and another piece of cloth to create the 'filter pocket'...  equals '3' layers of cloth...  Add '5' layer paper charcoal filter, and you now have '8' layers...  Which might be OK,..  if the mask had a wire stay from the bridge of the nose,..  to the middle of the chin...  Which would hold the mask away from your mouth and nostrils...  Needs some work...<br />At least now, I know what to look for in my next mask purchase..."
2.0,after only the second time to use these gloves the velcro broke on the back side of the mitten.
2.0,Super cute but made small!
2.0,"So far it out does the resent purchase of another time piece... yes, I bought them one after another.... dumb I know but live and learn and not buy certain things again. This time piece is Handsome and works the way it is suppose to. Many thanks to the watch maker, I do like alot. And I HIGHLY recommend it to whoever is in the market for a battery less watch... it, mine keeps excellent time, thanks for being around and out doing the other guys. and 2 YEARS HAVE PASSED AND I WORE THIS TIME PIECE 2 TIMES. HERE IT IS 2017, AND I TOOK THE WATCH OUT OF THE BOX TO WEAR IT FOR OLD TIMES SAKE... THE HANDS HAVE FALLEN OFF ! WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THIS ? IS THIS  THE WAY THESE WATCHES WORK ?  WELL, I WON'T BE BUYING ANY MORE OF THESE THINGS EVER AGAIN... TO THINK I GAVE SUCH HIGH RATING TO A PIECE AS THIS... MAN WHAT A ROOK...!!!"
2.0,"I really loved the criss crossed neckline and the bell sleeves of this shirt. The material felt scratchy, weird, and uncomfortable. The shirt itself was shorter than I had hoped. I was hoping to tuck it into a skirt, but the material bunched up and it was difficult to keep smoothed out in the way that I wanted to wear it."
2.0,"The text was great - then noticed it displays a Coronet image rather than a Trumpet. So, did not purchase."
2.0,"Looks cheap,  no white buttons and longer on back"
2.0,The pattern is silk screened on - not embroidered.  The material doesn’t look like it will hold up after many washes
2.0,"This top had the potential to be a very cute top and it is BUT it's EXTREMELY low cut. If you don't mind having your girls on full display, you will love it. Im no prude but this was a little excessive for my C cup."
2.0,"Thin cheap fabric and poor workmanship.  How do you classify material as 90% cotton n 10% other. Its probably 90% other..... Not impressed, its just quick sLes and disposible defective clothing.  Lesson learnt."
2.0,"I ordered my regular size. It felt like it fit, but the look was not flattering on me. I returned it.  If you want the look like the model, try ordering up a size."
2.0,Lo que no me gustó es que pica un poco la tela
2.0,It was fun while it lasted......2 weeks & it started unraveling.
2.0,Ok shoes however the Velcro is terrible.
2.0,Pictures slightly deceiving.  I thought the sides were more on the clear side not white.  The white background makes the sides look clear.  I love LOCS but I gave these away.
2.0,"While this dress is well made, it does not have the shimmer that is presented in the picture.  It’s much more dull than what is pictured.  I lightened the picture to make it look better and it still doesn’t have sparkle.  Very disappointing. I gave it two stars because the quality of the dress I excellent.  The fabric just isn’t what is presented."
2.0,The watch with this band is difficult to put on the wrist. The band is not the same texture that you might find on an Apple Watch. The band is difficult to work in between the skin and the band itself.
2.0,I was not happy at all with the product. It really is toy-like.
2.0,Defect in the paint! Other than that nice glasses. so i gave 2 stars.
2.0,I wish they sold the top and bottom separately the bottom fit perfect but the top was way too small. I kept it because I had a top I could wear with it but had to give the top up.
2.0,Was not expecting the material to feel so cheap.  Very disappointing
2.0,"Washed at least 2 times, still has a strong odor"
2.0,The wallet looks great but isn't...its really hard to remove cards from outside pockets. also there's glue on the inside of
2.0,i bought this product so I could see into the water more easily but they didn't reduce the glare and when I rotated them in front of a LCD screen there was no color change which means there is no polarization whatsoever. they look cool though.
2.0,So so product!  Didn't really work. Cheep quality
2.0,"The fabric is a good quality, but the zipper gets caught about halfway up and the dress is wayyyy wayyyy too short."
2.0,Literally looks like someone printed an image of this sweatshirt and put it on some thin material fabric. Please save your money and do this yourself because it’s 1000x brighter and uglier then expected.
2.0,"I was pleased to finally find a cardigan that was exactly what I was looking for!  Quality seemed good when it arrived and I was considering purchasing a second one in navy, but when I wore it the seam on the sleeve fell apart!  It’s as if the stitching didn’t take.  Most of the seam on that arm  is poorly done, and one area separated completely! So disappointing!"
2.0,"Had a funk smell to it when it arrived, it was wrapped in a plastic bag, and it fits smaller than you think. Overall it not bad just won't fit and the smell went away after I washed it"
2.0,"pretty but even an XL is 3  sizes to small, going to give it away"
2.0,The embroidered basket ball looks terrible.
2.0,Had a hole in the pocket upon arrival . Cute but disappointed
2.0,"The sizing was about right, maybe a bit on the big side. However, it appears very cheaply made. The color and fabric are not as pictured. The pink was much brighter than expected. For some reason, the drawstring, which was merely decorative, was not at all the same shade of pink as the shorts, so much so that it clashed. The fabric was shiny, with a visible loose or large weave and cheap appearing, most like lining fabric. It was not the soft, slightly aged look as in the picture. The tag reads ""65 per cent cotton"" but that did not seem accurate. I returned it immediately."
2.0,"Within using it for a few days, the purse already developed hole in it."
2.0,Way to big!!! Ordered appropriate for her age based on suggestions and size and the 9-12month fit like a 2T. Nice product. Wish she could have worn it.
2.0,"I really liked what I saw when I  opened the package.  It was cute.  The colors vibrant.  I immediately put it on and it fit great.  Two days later,  the string bracelet broke and the next day the braid broke as well.  Disappointing."
2.0,Very cheap look - had to return. Doesn't feel like a nice leather and is somewhat plastic like. The set up is nice but the color wasn't as nice as on the site either. Not a fan.
2.0,"The bag is very pretty and it looks fancy, but the front pocket clasp closure is coming off the fabric back after just 3 months of use."
2.0,A bit too small and kind of rough material.
2.0,Looks good but cheaply made. Already coming apart.
2.0,Links were not all connected when the item was received.
2.0,"Nice band. Clasp sucks.<br /><br />Nearly lost the thing a half-dozen times. Resorted to super-glueing the class together to keep it from falling off in bed, in the restroom, during meetings, everywhere."
2.0,Not the color I ordered by a long shot...very disappointing.
2.0,The material was very thin and the edges were not finished.<br />Tha patern and colors were good.
2.0,So so cheap looking! Only ok for kids.
2.0,Very comfy to wear & great color but it broke within a month and it wasn't used heavily. It did take a bit for my son to get used to putting it on himself because the clasp set -up is very tight.
2.0,Was very unimpressed w this item. It's a very thin cheap material and the ice bags are very small. Didn't help w my migraines.
2.0,"Very poor quality, thin material is see through"
2.0,This anklet changed colors the 2nd  time I  wore it.
2.0,"Did not look like the product pictured. The garment I received not high waisted. Over all, it does seem like it could sort of work for the stated purpose but did not work for me at all."
2.0,I didn’t like these. No tag or anything to tell the front from the back either. Way too small and confining. Not buttery at all.
2.0,"Material is very nice but the way the top is cut Ii is way too revealing and has NO support . Very awkward . The picture makes this top look like an athletic style top .... nope, one move and you will have indecent exposure."
2.0,"Love the colors, fast shipping but the balls are so small it keeps pushing all the way threw my lip. Its like theres no ball on the end but there is, its the same size as the barbell itself so nothing to keep it from falling out in your mouth."
2.0,Very cute but material is paper thin since there is no inner liner. Feels like if you bend over it might rip.  It fit just right around my chest and torso but was too loose around my thighs.
2.0,For the price it's fine I guess. Very thick. Very bulky. And very itchy. Wore it once. Annoyed my the whole day
2.0,"The hat is very comfortable, if not a bit large for its size. My major complaint is that it looks nothing like the picture. The camouflage is way more green and has no brown in it like the photo. Another issue is that the sticker on the visor leaves a small amount of residue behind that is visible. 2 stars for comfort. Lost three for not resembling the photo and the sticker residue."
2.0,Material was cheap looks nothing like the pictures
2.0,"Too long to get it, and anything that comes from China it is always too small and the quality sucks!!"
2.0,Very disappointed. These already have come unraveled/broken where the filter pocket is. My kid is so bummed. They didn’t last 2 weeks before unraveling.
2.0,I love the size and organization of this purse! It was exactly as I was wanting. BUT I was only able to use it for a little over a month. The tiny straps that connect the purse to the cross body strap ripped through and didn’t leave enough to be fixed. I’m not sure what to do with it now :(
2.0,Very hard plastic glasses that sits crooked on your face.
2.0,I will get an Invicta watch instead! I may keep this also as a basic timepiece. It does the job. Maybe.
2.0,"This bag looks better on the picture. WheniI received it, I was so happy until I feel the material.  Nice color but material nit durable. Will not buy from seller again."
2.0,"I bought this necklace to wear for my wedding along with two other necklaces from Amazon since I wasn't sure how they would look once I saw them in person....thankfully I did,  because when I receive the package it was wrapped in a cellophane piece of plastic without any padding and thrown in a box 3 times that size with my other two items purchased, and of course, broken.<br /> I suppose at that point it really didn't matter because although this was a beautiful piece, it was so incredibly heavy that I wouldn't have wanted to wear it all day on my wedding ."
2.0,"Not what I expected, too flimsy !"
2.0,cheap qualuity and too small for me.
2.0,They look like you're wearing thick socks...
2.0,"These continued to get ripped out of my nose whenever anything touched them and were quite irritating.  The post is quite flimsy.  Not a great fit for me, unfortunately"
2.0,Have only been wearing the watch strap for ~2 months and the leather around the quick release pin is on the verge of completely tearing.
2.0,After several times of removing mop or broom they crack and break.
2.0,The left side sleeve cuff is missing on the pink one. NO CUFF. Very disappointed that such an obvious defective merchandize was shipped to the customer.
2.0,The ring is not actual size 6. Every other silicone ring I have gotten that is this size fit. These do not.
2.0,"The actual pattern of this dress is cute. However, it was sewn poorly, and of such cheap, thin fabric. There is no way one could wear this dress without a full slip, or a camisole and half slip underneath; even then it would simply accentuate ones underwear with its almost sheer quality. Just a stupid dress. The pictures online are beautiful! Do not be fooled."
2.0,Super cute and well made but way too small. I bought an XLarge and had to give it to my 10yo grandaughter
2.0,I knew $3.99 was too good to be true but gave it a try... the coral color is pretty however you could see the cups through the swimsuit material; the top squished the girls and the bottoms needed a couple more centimeters to avoid muffin top
2.0,It kinda hurts my stomach when I pull it up.
2.0,"I would give it a higher review, but I received the wrong color! Ordered a khaki and received purple. Aside from that I love the shirt, fits as expected"
2.0,Disappointed.  The waist is too low rise. Was expecting waist to be slightly higher. Also not as soft as expected.  I normally wear 12 and ordered the Large 12/14. Found a different brand that has a higher rise and much softer.
2.0,Too small. print was off...donated and never worn....
2.0,They are very undersized. Didn’t even fit my 7 year old
2.0,.Sweater was somewhat large and the color was beige and not white as stated.  Sent back for refund.
2.0,Not a bad fit just not flattering on my fat belly at all. Returned
2.0,I love the dress but it appears to have some melted plastic film on it. I will be returning it.
2.0,It was all around uncomfortable and see through
2.0,"These gloves might be adequate in, say, Oklahoma. Here in Minnesota I need to tuck my fingers up inside the palm of the glove to keep them warm... and it's been a very mild winter.<br />A team of scientists designed these?!"
2.0,Wore for about a week and then the chain part broke off. Was really pretty when it was delivered.
2.0,Definitely not a one size fit all
2.0,Quality is average. Runs large.
2.0,Not too satisfied with the fabric!
2.0,Sizing was not correct.  I bought 5 other thermals and they all fixed perfectly and are supposedly the same size.
2.0,"They do indeed run small, but it isn't too awful. They are a bit tight at the top and they have the tendency to roll down. The white open near the foot within minutes of putting them on."
2.0,"Looks great online, but so stiff and tight that even my 11 year old daughter can't wear it. No elasticity."
2.0,"Not as described, too small"
2.0,"These are so small, they are my babies first piercing size. I thought it said .8mm that must have been length."
2.0,Cheaply made. They were also clips which I didn’t realize.
2.0,"It a cute cap, and it would be great for my curly hair... However, there is NO elasticity in the hat (even tho the description says there is), and it barely fits my head! My boyfriend even tried it and he has a smaller head than I do.. Snug, was his word. I'll be returning."
2.0,Be sure to size up! This shirt is adorable and feels great but the size was waaay off! It's tight through the shoulders and bust. Gave mine too my daughter in law. She loves it!
2.0,Lots shorter than I expected
2.0,My 11 year old loves this watch....but after having it for only a week....the band broke at the watch/band joint.<br /><br />Not too thrilled that I have to replace it so soon.
2.0,"Got the small size legging but it was a bit too loose in my opinion. My worry with exercise leggings is all the movement I'm doing in them, I don't want them to slide down. I'm not really a small person, I am 5'6&#34; and typically wear a size 3 pant, but I felt this product didn't give me the right amount of compression I would expect from an exercise legging. Additionally, I got the raisin color to mix up my exercise wardrobe a bit, but the color was just a bit funny...it comes a bit lighter in color than in the picture."
2.0,"UPDATE: I loved this right up until the moment I lost it. Fell right off my arm somewhere in an airport, can't say I'll be buying this again after I replace my tracker. Bummer.<br /><br />Love this little bracelet! It looks nice and it's easy to switch into from my usual band. Highly recommend."
2.0,It's felt. Beware.
2.0,"The cut of this dress was strange, pulled in some places, baggy in others, had to return, not for me."
2.0,"Too large to pull up for covering mouth & nose but, I'm petite at 5'2 and 110 lbs"
2.0,"Looks like a good hat but it fits RIDICULOUSLY small. Not even close to fitting an adult size head. If you wear a small fitted hat, this may fit, otherwise it’s WAY too small."
2.0,Very poor quality. Size smaller than expected. Picture much better than real item.
2.0,They unfortunately run small and because they are compression socks they are way too tight. Also they come as two pairs so you’re doubly stuck!
2.0,Way too small.  Not true to size chart and not too cute.  Poor quality.
2.0,Hollow metal...I thought it was titanium.
2.0,"Super cute design that looks just like the picture. However, it runs VERY small (I usually wear a large and I ordered an XL and it’s still too small) and it’s not even a sweater. This is just a long sleeve shirt. It’s a good quality shirt, but I ordered a sweater."
2.0,"The necklace looks cheaper then I was anticipating, very white and not very &#34;pearl-like&#34; beads."
2.0,You get what you pay for! Not the best but will work.
2.0,I wanted to love this dress I ordered in both a small and medium not knowing how fit would be. Unfortunately the pleats on the Torso kept bunching up and made the dress look awkward and sloppy. I suppose the dress could have worked if i wanted to spend the whole night pulling down a dress.. im 5'5 126lb and sm fit best
2.0,"Fits good, I followed the sizing chart and they aren't too small. I order g4s and I got g3s (g3s have a huge screen printed logo on the outside. That's the only thing I'm mad about"
2.0,"Ordered a medium and a small, the medium was unusually large and the small just didn't compliment my 5'6 140lb frame as expected"
2.0,this sweater is soooo cute!  BUT....it's boxy and you there is no label on what is the front and back so I guess it doesn't matter. It's a very thick sweater and it looks to be thinner in the picture so it adds bulk on you. I get compliments on it but I would prefer it fit and look like the picture. It took forever to get it so sending it back would be more of a pain. I hope this review helps - not sure I would recommend if you're looking for it be like the pic.
2.0,"To was very hopeful of this set. Unfortunately the shirt was way smaller than stated, probably about 2 sizes. And the shorts would fit me, an adult female size 6. Keep in mind I bought this for my 6 year old daughter. Both pieces were cute in themselves, but could never fit on one human at the same time."
2.0,Cute but the turtle neck is way too big and the sweater is itchy
2.0,very cheaply made. I couldn’t do it. Trash!
2.0,Thought they would be cute.  They aren't.
2.0,Soft material but it’s to small. Falls off your nose if you try to speak. Wont be able to wear it unfortunately.
2.0,"Way too small. If your septum is pierced a little high like mine, do not buy. I put it in and it was so tight and painful. I had no room to get it out either and had to get my boyfriend to stick his fingers up my nose to get it out. I wish I could wear it because it really is a pretty clicker. The pictures do not do it justice."
2.0,The left lens popped out the second day I wore them. They also are really dark which is good for the beach but not so good if you are wearing them while driving! I returned mine not sure I'll order a replacement pair.
2.0,It was more at waist level not ling like photo
2.0,"Love the print, but the fabric is very thin and the size chart was way off, I ended up giving it to my daughter."
2.0,"I had previously given these dresses 4 stars.<br /><br />However, I have not ordered 4 and returned 3.  The sizing and cut is different from color to color.  I bought a navy XL that fit well in the neckline and around the waist.  I then bought a green and teal one in XL.  These were too big in the waist and the neckline to low.  I tried to repurchase a gray one in a L and this was too small and also had a faint cigarette odor.<br />Be advised:  these dresses are slightly on the short in the length and I am 5'1.  Because I am super short and have length issues with maxi dresses in general, this was not a huge problem for me, but it would be for someone taller.<br /><br />I wanted to like these dresses.  The fabric is thick without being heavy and the price is good for a simple dress.  I got lucky with the navy one and am happy at least one worked out."
2.0,Fits more like a 1x compare to a 3x
2.0,This would be nice if they didn't look so cheap. Good design but it looks like costume jewelry. I was hoping for something more sparkly.
2.0,It was well sewn but cheap fabric and ill fitting.
2.0,"We maybe got three wears out of these before the ankle strap completely came off of the shoe.  On the other shoe, the ankle strap is ripping through the footbed.  They are horrible quality."
2.0,Fit was too narrow.
2.0,"For XL they run very small. I considered getting L for these but decided to opt to err on the safe side. Nope. Washed them in cold water before wearing and they appeared to have shrunk. I am no novice in washing clothes so I was surprised when I put them on they were too small, going to keep them as I am in the process of losing weight and hope to fit in them some day. But besides that, the quality of them the feel the softness. I am going to by some XXL for now since I did like the quality of them."
2.0,Not for slim body. This thing fit like a box…glad it didn’t fit!  Returned it. Return was easy—thanks Amazon.
2.0,Ad said “runs small” ordered 2 sizes larger than usual for sweaters in winter. Doll clothes MUCH MUCH too small. Nice jacket very disappointed
2.0,U can tell everything is cheap i fixed it up but it’s not worth it tbh
2.0,It’s a nice necklace but the actually charm is very large. Almost too big.. be careful purchasing unless you want a large sized pendant
2.0,"I loved the buttons on the sleeves. So cute,but the neckline is a bit misshapen and won't press out. All in all its a comfortable shirt."
2.0,"Really loved the look, but the sizing was off and annoying."
2.0,"Cute idea but didn't fit me at all!  Way to long, but I am pretty short."
2.0,Cheap looking. I sent it back.
2.0,I needed harem pants for my princess jasmine costume. The picture was more teal than the pants i received. I'm extremely disappointed and will be returning these.
2.0,"Love the print, the fabric, and the fit, but please have manufacturer review HOW to make them properly.... print is upside down! Wanted to return and repurchase but feel like that one would come upside down as well. If I didn’t love it so much, I would have returned it!"
2.0,"The size is comfortable, but the cup size is too small.  Should probably design with cup size in mind rather than just thinking about a shirt size. That's why I give it a 2, it is pretty and colors are pretty but cup sizing is a problem."
2.0,The dress was nothing as the picture shows totally different look and the style. Must say I am very dissatisfied 😞😢
2.0,"We found that the product is not washable, not really. A spin in the dryer on no heat still produces a smell, a turn out of the washed and damp socks produce wet baby feet. Took days to dry. We don't recommend, but other people may have had better experience, the quality is good, and they are well made, but they make our baby's feet sweat-thus needing a wash, after which they will not dry."
2.0,I did not like the material and it didn't fit right so I returned it.
2.0,"This watch looks and feels nice, but that's about it.  The watch falls behind about a minute per day, so you need to adjust it once every couple of days.  You also can't see the hands at night, which is a big drawback."
2.0,Nice pockets
2.0,Small for my big head.
2.0,Way too small... weird hat
2.0,"I am 5'4"" maybe 185 lbs and I bought burgundy in a Large. The material is thin. It's super stretchy. I'm not sure if you can see through it, but you can see the imprints of your underwear and bra. The dress is very long. It is also extra extra big. I could've easily gotten away with a Medium. I was going to return it but it's not as easy a process as I would like so I'll keep it. I guess I'll use it as a swim suit cover up or around the house. It's too big to actually wear it as an outfit. It swallows me up and looks like I'm wearing a bed sheet. Pockets are awesome though. Buy a size down from what you would normally wear if you want to actually wear it as a dress."
2.0,I’m not happy with my purchase.  It’s smaller than I thought. It looks cheap and cheesy.<br />Too expensive for the quality of the item.
2.0,Different fit.
2.0,Ordered 3 sizes bigger than I usually wear...still too small :-(
2.0,Feels like a bathing suit :/
2.0,"Update: After a short time, the underwire started poking me. So I had to get another one.<br /><br />The top fit. I am a nursing mother, though, so I had to buy an XXXL. Unfortunately, that means the already bulky skirt on the bottom was bulkier & longer than I wanted it to be. So I went out & bought a regular black bottom. Looks better that way."
2.0,WAY too small. I ended up giving this to my 13 years old daughter.
2.0,Fits and looks nice. Really disappointed it was only 1 piece. Granted it says it in fine print but I feel that the picture is misleading.
2.0,"I needed this for a suit I bought.  It fits poorly, saggy around the neckline and arms.  I won't wear it again unfortunately."
2.0,"They are straight from China, I'm actually scared to wear them as they might contain lead"
2.0,It fits good..I bought a small...I'm not happy w/ the material...See thru & cheaply made !!!
2.0,Too smaller than M size<br />Seller must review the shirt description based on the origine
2.0,"Bought this because I liked the nostalgia of it. The watch does what it's supposed to (show the time, etc) but it looks and feel cheap and flimsy. Will probably give it to my six year old nephew because its more of a kids watch than something for an adult. You get what you pay for with this one."
2.0,"Thin material, not soft, and not well made. Will be returning due to product looking “cheap”."
2.0,Cute but cheap.  Fell apart!
2.0,Odd cut to this shirt.  Neck too wide at same time shoulder seams were tight and fit too small. Didn't end up liking the Pink print in person either. Returned as it just didn't fit.
2.0,"Beautiful dress, however, the top is way to small for anyone with breasts, and the tie is not big enough for a 2X size"
2.0,"very uncomfortable, band pinched my arm, not a quality watch for the price."
2.0,They do break easily
2.0,This is for a new baby. Wouldn't fit on my 1 year old.
2.0,"The two pairs that are black fit, but a little tight. But the camouflage pair didn't  fit at all. It's like the camouflage cloth cost more  so they made it smaller. Also the garment  has weird stitching.  I wouldn't recommend  these a d won't buy again. Weid"
2.0,"Flimsy thin material (ironically, the kind that is sweaty because it doesn't breathe well, and cold because it's too think to keep the cold out.)<br /><br />The men's small was giantic."
2.0,"I purchased two Believe London ""Hematite Magnetic Therapy Bracelets"".  The slim hematite & tourmaline 8"" is magnetic.  THE HEMATITE CRYSTAL CHIP 8'  IS NOT MAGNETIC.  Although it is pretty, I am returning it because it is important for them to tell the truth!!!!"
2.0,I did not like the material.....and the fit was a bit small.  Had to return this item.
2.0,Cute dress.  Love the fabric.  However it is really long.  I'm 5 for 1 and even in heels it drags in n the floor.
2.0,"I like the style, but I don’t like the front part isn’t right Two puffy"
2.0,"The setting itself is wonderful, but the stones in no way represent the color that was shown at Amazon.com; the stones are so light you can see through them, and this is not the look that I wanted. These earrings are to be a gift to one of my nieces and I know she would much prefer the deep purple of amethyst. Please let me know what I should do about this situation. I want to return the earrings I have, but really like the setting. If I could get the earrings in the same setting but with a deep purple stone the same size as what I ordered, I would be amenable to that. Please contact me at my email address: shadwatch@hotmail.com as soon as possible so that we may get this matter settled. Thank you."
2.0,"Extremely well made/high quality leather strap but is too bulky and must often be pushed out of the way to operate the camera.  I used the strap for less than an hour of shooting, then removed it and reinstalled the original nylon strap that came with the camera."
2.0,"Fit as expected I'm 5'5 155lbs and got a large. I would've gave another star if it didn't last only less then 2 weeks, the wires are already popping out and I had only wore it about 5 times. I read the reviews about it buldging at the lower back, they are true, it makes it feel awkward and looks awkward as well. Not a terrible product if I would've lasted longer."
2.0,Buckle is solid but leather seperated after just a few days. Still somewhat functional but annoying. Do not recommend.
2.0,"The holes are not wide enough. It is very hard to try and stick a child size ear piece into these holes. I even tried cutting some of the sides to make it easier to slide the frames into, nothing helped. We don't use them anymore."
2.0,Shirt runs very large.  Horrible chemical smell.  Will launder to see if smell comes out.  Not the most flattering of shirts.
2.0,"The frame is as described and I like that, but they  do not come as advertised. They only come with clear lenses, which does not make them effective sunglasses."
2.0,super hard to open
2.0,iT WAS IN THREE SECTIONS AND WHEN U SPREAD IT OPEN U STILL DIDNT SEE THE HOLD PICTURE
2.0,"I’m 5’3” 122 lbs and medium is much too big for me. Also the material isn’t just cheap like a thin t shirt, it’s kind of itchy. It reminds me of those folding grocery totes they sell at F21, or that thick napkin they pin around your neck at the dentist’s office that’s a material somewhat between fabric and paper (if that makes sense)."
2.0,"Awesome looking watch with a super comfortable band. Not impressed with feel and durability of watch based on price. Feels like cheap plastic. Thermometer isn't accurate unless you take the watch off (what's the point of that). This is a great piece to look at, but I would only wear for special occasions if you decide to buy as it feels delicate. If you look at the reviews for the non Str Wars version, you can see many people have had watch fail on them. There are better watches in the Star Wars Nixon line in my opinion."
2.0,Very wrinkled from packaging and it didn't come out in the wash.  Poor quality fabric and workmanship.
2.0,One of the elbow patches is on the inside of the arm.  Can’t even wear it. 😡
2.0,"Ordered 2 of these t-shirts and I REALLY WANTED THEM! Followed the size chart and they were still 2 sizes too small. Very thin material, slightly see through. Gave them to my 22 yo daughter who loves them. Good looking Tee's but disappointed at the size chart being wrong."
2.0,"Unlike previously purchased Russell sweat suits, this one seems to fall apart. When I take it off, the floor around me and my socks are covered with pieces of fabric (pills I think they are called). Most annoying. I do like the feel of the outer material."
2.0,"cute, but fell apart the second time I wore it."
2.0,Got fuzzy and linty after a few times wearing.
2.0,"Uncomfortable, thought I would like the long bill but it's annoying to me."
2.0,"Maybe I'm out of touch, but can't figure how to load batteries, how to activate or how to adjust decibels!  It arrived as a boxed plastic egg-shaped item on a small chain.  How do I use it??"
2.0,"The material on the shorts is so thin it's practically see-through at the right angle. Lightweight, but not what you want your 14 year old lounging around in commando."
2.0,"I was really impressed with the packaging (box, bag, cloth), but the actual ring was not a deep red garnet as it lists.<br />It is more orange!"
2.0,I don’t know how these pants ever got good reviews. I purchased the blush color which was a very pretty color (why I gave 2 stars) but they were HUGE! Super long and so wide that I think I could’ve fit 5 of myself in them. I’m 5’4 136 lbs and usually fit perfectly in a medium but not in these. ALSO mine had a small rip in the leg. Save yourself the trouble and don’t buy.
2.0,"These were cute and look just like the picture but they felt and looked like Halloween costume boots. I was so sad, because they’re adorable, but I sent them back. I think I would have ruined them in 2 wears— especially if they got wet."
2.0,"I have an affinity for bag charms and was looking for the perfect one with a ladybug to go with a new bag I purchased. Though this is beautiful, it's so small! Think no bigger than a nickel... At most! I will keep this, but am still on the hunt for something to coordinate with my new bag. 🤷🤷🤷"
2.0,Falls apart quickly. Loose threads after about 2 wears
2.0,It broke after first use (holes)
2.0,"Tried, still have around somewhere but currently don't wear watch"
2.0,Upon receiving the package all the product was broken. I had to glue the pieces back together and that still didn't work for some of them
2.0,It was delivered quickly but I ordered a size 2XL-3XL and it does not fit true to size. I’m disappointed!!!
2.0,I though i am paying a watch but i just received watch strap. i might not understand well when i was purchasing it and the mistake can be from my side but the fact remains the same i am disappointed.
2.0,Disappointed in the quality. Not worth the money.
2.0,The texture of the dress was wonderful but it was way too small to be a XL.  Had to return.
2.0,I ordered the largest size and still didn’t fit. It’s def not true to size. My mother who is a 10/12 still got them and it was still a close but ok.
2.0,"I bought these colors specifically to match T-shirts that I had gotten for my son and what I received are three of one color, two of another, none of which are pictured. Also the band at the top is different and fits too tight."
2.0,"These were huge and I got a small! Also, seams on the pockets were off and stitching is not right!"
2.0,It’s ugly and really big with no shape. The pockets are backwards and make zero sense.
2.0,"Very thin, and the shape isn't right at all! The belly area has ruching in the wrong places, and it's shapeless at the bottom, not tight fitting like a bandage dress. I'm normally an XL and I ordered a large- still way too big."
2.0,This is very tight around the armpit and bust area.
2.0,This is advertised as a tunic long jacket.  It's not.  Came just between the waist and hips.  Not flattering at all.  Sent it back same day.
2.0,"I really wanted to like these as I wanted truly matching shirts for my honeymoon. I ordered a women's small and it was WAY too tiny looking (I didn't even try it on, if I washed it it would be like a child's size), and I ordered a men's medium which was insanely huge. I knew before purchasing that the lettering wasn't crisp, but that is another negative to this shirt. The shirts were soft, but the sizing just wasn't right for us, and they weren't worth keeping with subpar printing."
2.0,Didn't know they would be so small. Best for baby or little girl.
2.0,VERY THIN CHEAP MATERIAL!
2.0,"This fits fine, looks fine, feels fine but.........the only problem is that the seam thats supposed to be in the back of the dress is directly down the front of the dress. Makes it super weird looking because the tye dye doesn't match up correctly. I just got a defective one I think though other wise it was fine. I kept it figured ill wear it out on the boat nobody will see me lol but they also refunded me the money because of this issue."
2.0,it was too big
2.0,"great colors, but rather small for an adult wrist. several bracelets broke right away"
2.0,not what i was hoping for based upon photos...
2.0,The shoulder and arm holes are tight and I ordered 2 sizes larger than I normally wear.
2.0,"2nd time ordering this. Ordered a xl, looks like someone removed the orginal  tag and sewed in an xl tag.  It was the sane as the large. Nice shirt dress"
2.0,"Way too small. If your more small, even buy the biggest size."
2.0,My daughter wore one day and they already have those Bally things that you get when an item has been worn a lot.
2.0,"I used the size chart they had provided but the dress was too small. I would advise a size up. TBH though even if the dress had fit, it was very uncomfortable on the sides. It would have defunetly left a burn under my arms because the material is very rough and scratchy.<br /><br />It's a beautiful dress though and the details on it are breathtaking. Pretty bummed about this one, will be returning."
2.0,"UPDATE:  my husband HATED this shirt!  Felt horrible on AND buttons were on the wrong side!!! Which means, it was supposed to be for a woman!!<br /><br />Ok. Here’s the deal:<br />- color is great<br />- Material is ok… soft but synthetic.<br />- torso part of shirt seems short<br />- arms seem normal"
2.0,It was ok. Wish it was same size as pictured
2.0,"I was so excited on the price and it showed up on perfect timing. The problem is within literally the first 2 days of wearing it, the starfish broke off and was not able to fix it. I was left with only the blue diamond. Very disappointing."
2.0,"It was, OK not really what I expected kind of cheaply made . I'm not sure I'd purchase again."
2.0,"Usually love this brand,have many things from them.This just wasn't it for me"
2.0,It’s see through and too tiny I ordered XL. XL is what I usually wear
2.0,Not a flattering shirt. Looks like something my grandma would wear.
2.0,Very ugly and itchy. The neckline is terrible
2.0,Very tight for medium and thick material. You need a sport bra for some support.
2.0,"What the photos don't show and description doesn't divulge is the model is prob wearing a size small shorts and an XL top in this outfit, which means if we as buyers want it to look this way we would be spending $85 to have it look this way bc I bought the medium and the top is nothing like the one in these photos... It's okay nothing special, the shorts do look the same but not the top. I got the medium I'm 5'2 146 36b 30 waist had I seen it in person I would not have bought it"
2.0,The clasp is so small it is almost impossible to open and close.
2.0,I was very excited when I received this hat. It didnt look anything like the picture. It looked like a giant mickey mouse ear bow that stood straight up.I was so sad!! I returned it.
2.0,I loved it but it turned ugly green the day after I wore it .
2.0,"No receipt was enclosed, so I am unable to return dresses. They were so big and flimsy."
2.0,"The solar lights have never worked for me. I do not want to hassle with replacement, I will use without  light. It is a nice umbrella overall."
2.0,"I usually wear a woman's XL, so I ordered an XXL, figuring that since it's a hoodie, it wouldn't matter if it was a little big. Even so, the sleeves are too narrow for my arms, and there's not enough fabric across the back to accommodate my shoulders. Had the same problem with the T-shirt."
2.0,"I got this for a photoshoot but it didn't work out. First off, I expected this to be cotton material but it was straight spandexy material. Also, the picture shows the short sleeves at a length I really liked. The sleeve length I received was not as long. I'm 5'6 110lb and a 34b and the small was too short to wear as a dress. Just didn't work out how I would have liked."
2.0,"Nice quality but I returned. Rather than being a bathing suit top it’s a split front that comes with bikini bottom. Not what I was shopping for, not what is pictured."
2.0,"Very cheap quality, lots of uneven stitching. If quality improved, this dress would be great. It's super comfy and the fabric is nice. Fit was slightly larger than accurate."
2.0,"In the picture it appears there's a cut out for the auto start. Description also makes it appear to be for the 2022 Kia forte. All lies. Not only is there no cut out for auto start, the last symbol on the case isn't the same as the actual car key! What's worst is my bf bought one, I told him I didn't want it because it didn't have the cut out/wasn't for my car but instead his kia k5 just to buy the same thing! So if your key has auto start just look for a different case this ain't it"
2.0,"The tie is very simple but was everything I hoped it would be.  There is no name brand or anything, but it looks good.  The first time I wore it I noticed the the tie would not  stay together.  I realized that the small part that you tuck the bottom of the tie into was very weakly sewn and had come undone.  I took it to a tailor and they fixed it but they should have down a better job before they shipped it out."
2.0,It was too small and there is no way I could have worn it through a high intensity workout.
2.0,"I should have trusted the reviews ... Nothing like advertised photo :-/ material is very cheap, plastic like quality, pink color and silver stars are printed on the outside only, inside is white. Save yourself disappointment!"
2.0,"It fits as expected, but it's too short. It needs to be longer! I'm 5'2 and I got a M and it's short. It's a beautiful dress, but the zipper got stuck."
2.0,"I have several pairs of Point6 socks from several years ago. They have served me well and are still like new. They have changed the way they make these. They are scratchy, tight and uncomfortable. Gone are the soft, cushy Point6 socks I grew to love. I will look elsewhere from now on."
2.0,"The quality of the material was lower than expected. I did not like the feel of the fabric, so I returned them."
2.0,They are smaller than appear in advertisement
2.0,"The color of this shirt is pretty, but there are silver rings on the sleeves that I did not notice in the picture. They look tacky and cheap. The quality of this shirt should be fixed."
2.0,"I received two shirts, one in grey made in the USA and one in navy made in Nicaragua. The grey one seems fine and seems to be holding it's shape. The navy one shrank a full shirt size after washing on cold with a low heat tumble try. One shirt was half-decent, the other was junk."
2.0,The lens does fit over the glasses well but the visual quality is poor.  They would be OK if you are desperate to block out the bright light from the sun but they definitely affect the quality of what you see.
2.0,"So a couple of things. I am 5’1” and I weigh roughly 108 pounds, i ordered a size small. The pants are short, as in they hit me weirdly at above the ankle. I personally am the type of person who likes my yoga pants below my ankles. I am a short torso all legs petite woman, the crotch area of the pants is bulky and theres a bit of extra fabric. Definitely wear no show undies because you can see your underwear lines. Now the high waist top is definitely a high waist, but theres no tummy control and theres a thin band at the top that tends to dig in. Fabric felt soft and I loved the pockets. Ill keep to wear around the house. But these were definitely a pass for me."
2.0,"It shrunk ALOT after i washed it, I ordered a large and it shrunk so much I can't fit into it"
2.0,"Did not like this dress at ALL! Ugly color nothing like color pictures. Way too big... order to wear to a wedding. Tried on, and makes me look pregnant (I’m like 115 lbs 😂) Not really a cold shoulder either. I returned the dress, and ordered another super cute one from Amazon ."
2.0,"Cheap plastic, alarm sound not good. Nothing like it looks"
2.0,"My son hasn’t even had these shoes 5 months and they are totally worn out on the bottom. For the money I paid, they would have lasted longer!  I’m really disappointed."
2.0,"I was unable to wear the hat because the ""pocket"" wasn't deep enough. I wear a normal size hat even with my hair as it is a short pixie. The satin inside is nice and it is nice to have the adjustable strap, if only i could keep it on my head!"
2.0,I have this dress in a floral fabric. It’s great. This one is the same great cut except this navy fabric is really translucent. Wore it for 4th of July but was annoyed because I had to wear a slip.
2.0,"This top looks cute on the webpage, but according to kids (who don't generally lie when their filters fail),  It looks like is was ""made by someone who can't sew"" and ""maybe it is on inside out!"""
2.0,Very pretty runs a bit small
2.0,"First of all, the dark blue is more like a bright cobalt. Secondly, it's very tight in the waist while being baggy everywhere else. I'm hourglass shaped so that sort of fit usually works for me, but this is just too extreme. If I size up for a roomier waist I'll be swimming in the top and tripping over the bottoms. I'm giving it two stars because the material is nice (too bad it's such an ugly color!)."
2.0,This was a silky material and I didn't see that in the description so I returned it. Too cold of material for a finicky kid.
2.0,Arms too big
2.0,The plastic is coming apart on the front and sides.
2.0,Worked ok for the one night i wore them but extremely cheaply made and fell apart
2.0,The colors and design are good. They run big with no adjustment option. I wasn’t able to use them.
2.0,"Maybe if I had washed it in hypoallergenic detergent it would have been fine to wear, but I think the material was the problem. It was so itchy. Cute. But seriously uncomfortable."
2.0,Pretty design but runs VERY small.
2.0,"I ordered 2 sets. 1 set is fine, the other set is missing beads.<br />Bad quality control"
2.0,"Bought these as a gift for someone for Christmas. It was a nice addition to her charm collection....or so I thought. Sje said after a few weeks, not only did it change color/fade, but shortly after, it broke off her bracelet."
2.0,I bought it for a friend but unfortunately did not fit her wrist. I was very disappointed.
2.0,KEEP SEARCHING!!!!!!!! the fabric smells sooooooo bad and it had holes in it when i opened.
2.0,"umbrella was ok but the handle was broken and I glued it, but I didn't receive the travel umbrella as advertised. there are better options online for less money."
2.0,"Pretty, but material was stiff yet stretchy on top."
2.0,Although everything is of good and study quality.  Some of the charms I purposely saw and made me buy the package.... i didn't get.  So tbh I wanna return it but why waste my time.
2.0,"This dress looked nice on the model but, it’s thinner than a regular Tshirt. I would only wear it on a hot summer day with a slip(I don’t wear slips in the summer). The orange is true to color and I have slip on shoes that match the color, will not wear to any office, only as a casual summer dress. Love the color but fabric is too thin."
2.0,"maybe it's jr sizes.  way too tight - i'm always a med.  gave it to my niece.  looks worn out in the pic- but in person, those are super bright colors."
2.0,Not as nice as pictured. Looked more like a bear then a cat.
2.0,"They are not as nice looking as I anticipated.  Also the post closer is too tiny and I hurt my ears trying to get them on and off, so I use some from my other earrings.  Disappointed."
2.0,"it was delivered at promised. but, the only problem I had it was toooooooo small and the material felt like paper."
2.0,"I was looking for a dress for work, we need it to be knee length. The fabric was nice, but dress was at my mid thigh and that was before I even sat down. I know I am 5'11"", but the model must be 5"". Mine was returned."
2.0,"Product starts to thin after a few cleanings. The color said black and gray, but it was Navy Blue and Gray. Loved the ear loops. Very comfortable, lacking in the durability."
2.0,"Loved this style and color but sadly had to return! Runs way too small and I went a size up! Plus I couldn't even put it on, you need super skinny legs to get these beauties on!"
2.0,They couldn't stand up to two dance classes for my kindergartener- not worth the extra money.
2.0,"Didn't expect this watch to be child-sized. It looks ridiculous on my wrist. The price is small, which is comparable to its size."
2.0,"Could be shorter, bunches up around neck"
2.0,A little to narrow for my feet. I have sores on the end of my feet through half the work day. Disappointed
2.0,"Unfortunately, I wanted to love this cardigan but it did not meet my expectations. It was much bigger than expected, and very bulky, almost fitting like a mans suit. The material was good, but very oddly thick. If you are to purchase, i'd recommend sizing down. There were no snags or tears."
2.0,"the gather at the waist is too restricting, and I'm thin by American standards"
2.0,cover flew away
2.0,"Awkwardly sewn. I ordered a large. It was too big in the waist and the waistband was too high. The bust area was baggy with the outer material but tight with the inner. I'm a 36B. I don't know what body type would actually look good in this dress. The fabric wasn't bad, definitely swishy potentially loud."
2.0,Pretty print. Nice that there is a built in slip. So so small. I ordered the xl (I’m normally a M in skirts) and it was uncomfortably tight. If you are over a size 8.... I wouldn’t buy this skirt.
2.0,"These straps were not actually embroidered.  These are an embroidered print. Although the prints are cute & colorful, it is not what I was looking for.  If you don't mind a print, these are the straps for you!"
2.0,"These shoes are so cute, the glitter doesn't rub off, and it has a lovely sparkle, but the morons stamping the shoe sizes don't understand what size they are stamping. Ordered 2 versions of size 8, received a size ""8"" that is really a 7/37. The size printed on the tongue is correct, not the size in the circle. I think the whole batch is messed up. Ordered a size 9, and it was super large, like a size 40. So I guess I'm not meant to have cute, sparkly shoes."
2.0,"Not for high impact fitness unfortunately, super thin material! I love this brands other sports bras but this one is not for running or CrossFit. Would be fine for yoga or just lifting weights."
2.0,Very soft but after couple washes fall apart
2.0,"I really like these, but every pair I’ve worn seem to have the threads come out of the sewn fabric once washed.  Even twisted up through clothes when in the dryer."
2.0,3 times pins fell out of the bracelet. The 3rd time I returned it for a refund.
2.0,The dress is pretty but the material is heavy and thick.
2.0,One of them broke within 2 minutes of trying to put them on.
2.0,Item you receive nothing like the picture. Very thin and cheap looking.
2.0,"There were folds in most of them that could hardly be flattened out since they were so thin and lacy and some were child or anorexic size, and it didn't come with the one I wanted from the picture."
2.0,"Might be useful for a small child but nowhere large enough for a typical adult. The image in their ad is not accurate as the actual mask is too small and does not have anywhere near the amount of coverage that you'd need to actually get the under the chin that they imply. At best, the lower flap might just barely include your lower lip - without providing an effective seal. It's like the difference between wearing a Stetson vs  a birthday party hat. You could get the mask to sit under your chin - but your nose would not be included. The Only plus is that the 2 pack was inexpensive enough that I'm not even going to bother returning them."
2.0,This product fit horribly and awkward. I had to return it. It was a cute hat but just sized weirdly.
2.0,"First, these are huge glasses in diameter. My husband laughs at me but I catch him with them on periodically because they're convenient. 😁<br />Second, They're loose on me.<br />I'm sure the blue is great but after just a little while I return to my old cheap ones (same strength)because I cant read as well. It's almost like the lens material isnt clear enough.<br /><br />I did get them at a special price but would not purchase again. I hope others have had better luck."
2.0,"Loved it when I first got it, but after wearing it for one day, it began to turn green. Sad to say what you pay for is really what you get."
2.0,Didn’t like the fit or the fabric.
2.0,I ordered it 2 sizes larger then what I wear and it's a tight fit! Also it looks like a 3/4 sleeve but it's really long sleeves which I didn't want.
2.0,Wasn't comfortable because it didn't fit the nose well and was small on the face
2.0,"Product does not fit true to size, suede on the bottom not a great look if you have a young baby who drools or touches their feet,  very stylish however not my favorite baby shoe."
2.0,Had to send them back. They were way too big. Ordered an 8. I would say to order down a size.
2.0,These are so flimsy you can put it on blow out and feel your breath!
2.0,"Meh.  Ok, but not quite what I was looking for."
2.0,"I really like the look and functionality of this wristlet.  However, after a couple weeks of using it, the wrist strap broke.  It’s also showing some signs of wear already on the corners.  I’d say this wristlet is ok for occasional use.  But not a product that can be used everyday.  Material and craftsmanship will not hold up.  I’m disappointed."
2.0,"due to the shape, they really don't sit right on your ear lopes to look like in the picture"
2.0,Very thin and bendable.
2.0,Does not look flattering on.  If you want a shirt to throw on and not care about looks then this is the shirt for you.  Looks very sloppy.
2.0,"Two pair now, both have ripped at the seam and the button came out of the hem it was sewed into.  Fabric is very thin and weak compared to something like 501's.  If you want nice looking jeans, these are great.  If you want jeans that are meant to take a beating like jeans should, these are not the ones to buy."
2.0,"The photo shows the blue as bright royal blue, actual product received was dark navy blue.  Can hardly tell the blue from the black. Disappointing"
2.0,"The ""marsala"" color is completely different from the advertised picture. It's orangey colored."
2.0,"I got this necklace because the toggle look matches an accent feature on a shirt I recently got. However, chokers don't really look very good on me, and at 16"" or 16.5"" (depending on if you go by the length given in the description or in one of the product pictures) it would fit, but not be what I wanted. I only ordered it because both the picture and the description text say there's a 2"" extension. This is not the case at all. I'm never going to wear this necklace, but my daughter was happy to take it off my hands, which is the only reason I gave it the 2nd star. Be aware that this product is not as described, so if that 2"" extension is important to you, don't buy it. If not, you'll probably be happy with it, because it is a nice-looking necklace."
2.0,"Not for women with breasts; a B cup would push the limits of this ‘dress.’ I would size up, but it is bulky everywhere else as it is."
2.0,I returned this jacket. We loved the print and the fit but the inside is we so stiff and awkward with all of the seams exposed.
2.0,It did not fit
2.0,"I'm 220 lbs and 5' 3&#34;. There's no way these are plus size. I only was able to pull these up to my knees. The waist is super small. Besides that, the quality is there and the color was beautiful. They're very soft too. Definitely disappointed despite the positives."
2.0,Sleeves are very short for long sleeve. Also knit is much thicker than I saw in the picture.
2.0,Finger tip seam split on second wear
2.0,"I LOVE the material this dress is made of. However, the shape of the dress doesn't work. I bought a size large and it fit my body wonderfully except that the top was cut in so much that my boobies poked out either side! I showed my husband and he laughed, saying the shape was more akin to an apron."
2.0,Runs really large so no shaping or Spanx effect.
2.0,This was sized way larger than what the size was .
2.0,It fit true to size but it looks so cheap. Nothing like what I saw in the picture. The knitted holes were really large and in the picture TO ME it didn’t look like something knitted at all. Reminds me of shoe lace material and It’s super white... just not for me
2.0,"I expected it to look like all of the sisters were a variety of copper or silver and only 2 were, the other 2 were some form of acrylic."
2.0,"The glasses came in one piece and as pictured, but they dont fit at all. They fall down my face and are too big. Can't really adjust them but I like them too much to just throw away"
2.0,They look and feel cheap.  At least I won't really care when my daughter loses one or two.
2.0,"It's huge. I also order ""yellow flowers"" and this is BROWN/TAN 🤦🏽‍♀️"
2.0,Too big and no structure.
2.0,It’s very see through. And not worth the price
2.0,Cute but not sized correctly. I have large thighs so even with a garter belt they don’t stay up well. It’s a good design and material but runs small
2.0,This wig is way too thin. You can see the netting completely on the back and the wig cap is way too small to fit on an average sized head.
2.0,"Everything in this set is WAY oversized, and comical looking. I wouldn't buy again."
2.0,The quality of the shirt wasn’t as expected the stitching and the zipper seem like it was made in a rush and wasn’t made properly
2.0,Was way to small for my 7 yr old
2.0,Runs very small<br />Pretty color
2.0,"Broke in five minutes when I dropped it from three feet onto carpet. Honestly, I'm disgusted. This is a product, targeted mostly for children, as a toy to be juggled. If it can't handle a drop onto carpet, it shouldn't be sold. End of story.<br />However, those five minutes where it wasn't broken were pretty cool.<br />PS, color shown not necessarily the color you get. Mine was black.<br /><br />EDIT: I changed from one star to two, because I was able to fix it with super glue. Still though, if your product breaks this quickly, I don't give more than two stars."
2.0,"Material seems nice enough for the price, but the liner pocket was upside down, and thus unusable."
2.0,"Very disappointed. Cup size did not fit at all, even though I ordered a similar bra in the same size with a different manufacturer which fit perfectly."
2.0,Decent price but the holders next to the heart were broken soon as I opened it and you can see the color difference. Also didn't see a return option.
2.0,More like tinted- they dont really darken
2.0,I ordered a medium and the dress is too big<br />I do like the material
2.0,It looks pretty awful on me. But it washed beautifully.
2.0,"These seem to work ok on my Hoka ATR 4’s but still have a lot of friction due to me threading the holes that don’t have these parts because my expensive and very nice looking Hoka running shoes look pretty ugly when missing a number of lace holes on the shoe.<br />Then the advertising shouts how the system evenly spreads the laces grip but its missing the added comfort and precision your laces can provide by pulling on more than just 3 points. My shoes have 5 or 6 points per side that cover the length of the shoes tongue and spread the tension over its length. Thats why Hoka designed my shoes with many lace holes!<br /> At probably 3¢ or so per piece, they would like you to buy an extra kit so it becomes a $11 or $12 purchase plus the cost of the laces.<br />Then you have an $18 product instead of $11.  Next, you have the doubling of plastic and cardboard packaging costs for our planet, additional shipping and waiting for the extra parts to come.<br />At best, a highly cynical approach to a smart and green segment of customers.<br />Frankly, the cost isn’t it, I get angry when I think a company is having meetings to figure out how to be dishonest for the purpose of grabbing extra revenue at my expense.<br />I was considering adding this to all of my many running shoes, but except for my first pair, I’m going to look around for similar parts from the many HW stores and web sites. In fact, I am thinking of some nylon ties which have similar loops that can be modified for this."
2.0,"Two of the necklaces were broken right off the bat. The clasps are extremely cheap, they don't want to come open. When you get it to come open, it won't shut. I would not recommend these."
2.0,Ordered 3xls. They fit more like an xl. The shirts were short and very tight.
2.0,"Cute but the picture is super super deceiving. The makes it seem as though the sunflower top is long (tunic length) and flowing, it is by far not either of those. I ordered a Large which I usually wear a Medium-Large I would suggest going up one or even two sizes. Like I said it's cute but not as described or what/how I was going to wear it...with leggings."
2.0,They dont stay on my face properly!  Slip off and not a tight fit.
2.0,"Nice shirt, just way too big.  Sizing is definitely off."
2.0,I returned this sweater to Amazon for a full refund because:<br /><br />1.  The sweater I received has the zipper-pull on the LEFT side of the sweater.<br />In the USA MEN's sweaters (and jackets and parkas) usually have (by convention) the zipper-pull on the RIGHT side of the sweater (and WOMEN's overcoats usually have the zipper-pull on the LEFT side of the sweater).<br /><br />2.  The sweater I received (which is somewhat bulky and looks somewhat feminine to me) also has MANY threads which are already unraveled (as received) at stress points.  This observation greatly concerns me that this sweater might NOT be durable.
2.0,It was two different colors black the n l bottom was asshy black look
2.0,"Was too small, but was otherwise cute and decent quality."
2.0,Product wasn’t waterproof as advertised
2.0,Fit perfectly but the side zipper was broken
2.0,"Quite disappointed, very impressed with the material, but being a B/C cup your boobs don't really stay in. Especially on the sides (side boob action) and the padding is really weird like your supposed to have a uniboob."
2.0,"Came broken, unfortunately."
2.0,I had to return it - I think I ordered the wrong size because it was too big.
2.0,"These shorts are so cute but I would normally buy a large to have some extra room and even after ordering an XL after seeing they run small, they are still too small! The waist is not too small it is the part around the thighs that cuts into your leg making you feel uncomfortable."
2.0,Totally misleading description. It says that the heel height is approximately 5.51 inches but in reality it is only 4 inches. Really?
2.0,No stretch at all. I wish it would’ve fit better or more properly. Super cute pattern.
2.0,The cut of this dress is adorable! Very trendy!<br />But the material is terrible- it pimpled up and unraveled in the stitching.<br /><br />It is really too bad that such a cute dress couldn't be made better.
2.0,There are definitely not knee highs!!!!  I gave these away
2.0,Quality is very cheap. Doesn't look 3d at all. Just an over hyped tshirt.  Would not purchase again. Make sure to order a size up if you decide to buy.
2.0,Looks good but too cheap it broke as soon as we got it.
2.0,Bought for a family photo not the worst thing ever but definitely needs a belt for those with a few extra curves like I do.
2.0,I opened this on Easter day to wear and the necklace was broken. Very disappointed because it is a beautiful set.
2.0,These are slippery and slide down constantly. They are also not has high waisted as others I have so that makes it worse. I've tried a number of different workout pants and these are by far my least favorite. Wish I would have returned them.
2.0,"You mostly see the blue, not the red. Kind of looks like a hospital band."
2.0,"The zipper on these boots are junk and the laces are way too long.  But for the price, they did the job for the winter season."
2.0,Love the looks of this one but the clasp isn’t very tight! I have lost my I watch a few times because of this...
2.0,"Unfortunately the metal cuff for around the ear (not the dragon's arms) is not attached correctly, so it does not stay around the ear unless you'd like to be regularly poked by the dragon's arms. The dragon itself is cute, but the earring is not wearable the way it is. You've got to bend it to fit around your ear, and possible get rid of that metal cuff completely and attach a new one. Given how cheap it is, though? Might be worth it to get it fitted by someone around your ear."
2.0,The time turner doesn't turn. We were hoping for a turning time turner. The item was returned. It did seem decent quality.
2.0,Very tiny!!
2.0,The band didn't hold up very well and the strap broke within 2 weeks. Is also very itchy.
2.0,Would be a GREAT maturity dress - WAYYYY too flowy for the average person.  Beautiful design and material though.
2.0,"Cute but an odd material and cut, like shoulders tend to ride up.  Bought for a party and had bo choice but to wear. Honestly cannot recommend others to purchase."
2.0,Looks like a nice quality but runs very small. Xl is closer to med. Returned
2.0,"This was for my wife and it did not seem to be made out of the same material as the last one she purchased (a gray one, in the fall).<br />After one washing and hang drying it shrunk even more.  She would have returned it, but threw out the tags expecting it to be of the same quality."
2.0,"The material in the picture looks like the shirt is cotton but it feels and looks, in reality, like a polyester type of material. It is also not long, like pictured..."
2.0,"The mask shape was not molded accurately.  The mask material was rough. Tried to fit it on my kids, wife and me, all with different face shapes and sizes. None of us were able to get even a fair fit."
2.0,"Replacing the band was easy, however, it doesn’t seal in moisture as well as the original band that came with my Fitbit. After one accidental wear in the shower my watch is filled with moisture. Never had this with my original band."
2.0,"Didn't meet my expectations - the piece that goes up the thong was long/high enough so it really wasn't effective.  Also, the pad slipped around and would not stay in place. Overall, I would not recommend it."
2.0,It's is super cute but i lost it on the 2nd day because the stoppers kept falling off.
2.0,These are pretty crappy quality. Only lasted a couple months. Wouldn’t recommend
2.0,"Too small beautiful dress But thin as the wind, lol slip that line's dress is NOT long enough but then again I'm a curvy girl! I gave it two stars because it's a pretty dress!"
2.0,The material is very thin and isn’t squat proof!
2.0,"I order this for my husband for his birthday (the Darth Vader style). The Darth Vader style looks like it is plastic, and my husband isn't good at looking at product descriptions. I think the image is definitely misleading. This item does NOT look like the picture at all. We are not happy with this and will be returning if it isn't too late."
2.0,"Arrived in good time but dress seemed to be made for accommodating width, not height. Based on reviews I chose the XL size. I'm 5'6 and 200lb, and this dress seemed more accommodating for someone shorter with much wider hips than me. Made me look frumpy and was much too short (more midi style than maxi, did not even come near to my ankles)."
2.0,can't wear because I wear glasses. Won't sit on the ear correctly.  Please be aware of this if you wear glasses.
2.0,"Cards stick like crazy except for two side slots out of the many. It looks nice outside but functionality, not so much. Wouldn’t recommend this."
2.0,pants does not look like the picture its lose material and has a thin strap like seam at the top. does not give shape.
2.0,"This product is just as described, only it’s too big."
2.0,"My son really liked them, but they didn't last long, they have a huge hole in the toe"
2.0,"This jacket was not near as lofty as the pictures suggest. Also, the material is super thin and I don't think there's anyway it would have faired with my active 5 year old's activities. Had the baffles been loftier we probably would have kept it. Although it was also on the large side."
2.0,I'm assuming it doesn't come in xxl like it offers because when we ordered it they sent a medium. Know it fits small so I would order a size up. Also good for the cosplay but by the end of the night expect it to rip so don't plan on wearing it for a long time or bring a back up.
2.0,"I really hoped these would work well for me, but sadly they did not.  The material feels nice; however, the fit was just too large and the amount of compression was just not enough."
2.0,"After wearing the watch all day, it will not keep accurate time."
2.0,The quality of this item is terrible.  It looks like someone printed the logo on their computer.  I hate leaving bad reviews but this just isn't good.
2.0,Dress was okay material on top was see through so I had to take to seamstress to get a lining. Very cheaply made for the price you pay. Don’t waste your money.
2.0,I bought this couple of weeks ago and wore it to play beach volleyball (Sand). Sand gets into the socks and making it difficult to run or move. For every point I had to remove the socks and flush the sand out. Not worth it.
2.0,"I've had the holster for about three months. It was great for the first two months, but the clip and belt holder have fallen apart."
2.0,Small and tight. Will squeeze your nose.
2.0,"My son wanted to buy these and within a day of wearing them while playing, the strings were already unweaving. He really only had to wear them a day or two and that was all.  I do not recommend this product."
2.0,Very thin and cheap. Looks like maternity wear due to the way it's sewn.
2.0,"I received this product fast, however it's not what I was expecting. Dust and dirt can still get in. Also it's hard to get it on and off the ring. I used the large size on my 4 ct solitaire princess cut stone and it was still a tight fit."
2.0,"I haven't worn this scarf because the color is not what I expected. It's brighter, like a bright teal - I'm not a fan. The material seems ok, but I can't speak for how it wears because it immediately went into the back of my drawer. Guess I shouldve returned it."
2.0,not good for riding battery eyes
2.0,For $20 I would’ve expected better quality. Less than a month and two hems are fraying :/
2.0,"Cute shirt, but runs very small. I normally wear a medium/large for reference, but still hoped the Large plus would work after reading other reviews saying it ran small. I’m a 34DD with broad shoulders and this was super tight across the chest. Seems well made for the price, but large plus size is  closer to a small-running medium."
2.0,Order at least a size up
2.0,They’re a lot smaller than I originally thought. One or two came with holes in them
2.0,Poor sized I was disappointed way too tight
2.0,"The products are comfortable, soft and breathe well, but there's not really any support for actually working out."
2.0,Sleeves are too tight. Over all not a good purchase for me.
2.0,This watch has already messed up. It's blinking all different colors and I can't stop it. Not a very good purchase.
2.0,"These tanks are awful. They fit fine when you get them. The neckline is a bit constricting but it was ok. However, after I washed and dried them they shrunk. Now they are tight and short! I bought to wear under my nursing scrubs and they are awful. They are tight in the neckline and short so they ride up. They look and feel like cheap quality. I already washed them so I’m keeping them but I won’t buy them again and I hope you think twice too. If you are looking for high quality, go elsewhere."
2.0,Looked good. Didn't survive first machine wash.  Shredded pretty easily. No machine malfunction. Anything like this that can't be machine washed is pretty useless to me.
2.0,Neck was too high and boobs were weird.
2.0,"too big, kept slipping off regular glasses, clamp was not tight enough and not sturdy."
2.0,Purchased this costume for my daughter's dance performance and it ripped at the first rehearsal!  Couldn't return it because it we wouldn't receive the replacement  in time for the show.
2.0,these support capri’s by Spanx have been around for many years. they are a smoothing type material with midweight support. I have been buying these for a longtime from different vendors over the years. I rely on them which is my preference but I noticed vendors on here are doubling the cost of these support Capri’s “actually gouging” I will not be buying these anymore on Amazon and I suggest if anyone is looking for these search on the internet and you will find them elsewhere for 1/2 the cost of what is being charged here. so 2 stars for being my favorite ever support capri.
2.0,"The fit is fantastic,  the quality however is not . I wore 1 night and the bottom hem unravelled. I have not returned,  because i plan on fixing, but disappointed in the quality of the stitching."
2.0,fit in front not on my rear
2.0,Cheaply made and doesn't appear to cut correctly. gaps where it shouldn't
2.0,Beautiful skirt  but I thought it was a dress not just a skirt
2.0,"These were highly rated by others who purchased them, but I simply don't like them. Purchased them for a 3-week trip, but after ripping a hole within an hour or two in the trial one I wore before my trip, I decided not to bring them."
2.0,This bra was too small even when I bought a size up. The underwire was not sturdy at all very flexable and didn’t hold anything up
2.0,can not see in bright light and clasp is cheep. One topped working 2 days after using it.
2.0,"This jacket sticks! It looks great, very cute, fits well. But it smells to high hell of chemicals. I assume from the dyes. I have made multiple attempts to try and get the smell out. Two overnight soaks. One in distilled vinegar, another in baking soda. I have let it air dry in the sun twice, it has been washed 4 times. Lol, the smell won’t go away. I guess you get what you pay for....?"
2.0,"This shirt is not the same style as the picture!  Except for colors.<br />It has a tight waist (doesn’t hang like pictured) & sizing is definitely way off.  I went up the recommended sizes and it was still too tight in the arms(which by the way are not super long, they go right to wrist)<br />Super bummed because I was looking forward to this shirt but I will be returning."
2.0,It's a very thin product that bends easily.<br /><br />It doesn't turn my skin green though.
2.0,Actually I like the earrings- but they're tiny! Was looking for big earrings- guess I should've read the measurement! Was disappointed-m wanted to wear them especially today! Happy St. Patrick's Day!
2.0,"I ordered the suspenders for my clubs Halloween awards banquet. I went to get dressed, and noticed that the pumpkins were printed upside down on the suspenders. I couldn’t wear them, and look bad. So had to return them."
2.0,The quality is good but the sizing is way off!  XL is more like a med/lg.
2.0,"It's cute enough, but it looks cheap and it broke and tangled very easily.  I basically wore it twice and unless I want to deal with fixing it, it's trash."
2.0,Fits very small . Two sizes at least. They do not do returns so buyer beware
2.0,Material is a good quality. The fit is crazy small! Bought a 2xl and it fits like an American small/medium. Seams aren't the best.
2.0,All the backs are trash. The pendants are nice.
2.0,The seam in the crotch was not sewn properly and it has a huge hole. Luckily it was an easy fix on the sewing machine.
2.0,I think that glasses are ok. I've never had bifocals before. They take getting used to.
2.0,"I learned my lesson on these sunglasses, never purchase glasses with a brownish color lense. They are BROWN.  I only like gray"
2.0,Made in China. Soft and fits well. Not the greatest looking tank but good enough for yoga.
2.0,The bottom fits good but the top is too small
2.0,These have a weird material that tickle my feet when I wear them! I bought them for our beach vacation. The straps are way too long. So I have to tuck them into the sides. They are just ok….
2.0,Way too short. Like a shirt.
2.0,Got this today...disappointed...I'm very tall..5'11 and this swimsuit is way too short makes me look weird!! When I put it on its hard to get the straps over my shoulders.  Then with it on it makes me look flat cause it's not cupping my (knockers😳)<br /><br />Afraid it's going back...other then that it's cute and fits fine!
2.0,"This item has a great design.  However, it was too small for my particular need."
2.0,"I love the material, but it is way too small I can wear it as a top but not as a dress"
2.0,I liked the style. It was just too small. I had to return it.
2.0,I was very disappointed that the band did not come with pins to attached to band to the watch.
2.0,Too tight at the top.  Returned.
2.0,Slightly disappointing because the design becomes distorted when worn. Quality of the material is fine though
2.0,"This shoe has flower imprints on it, the leather is thin, and cuts into the foot."
2.0,"colour  was  not  even  close  to the one  that looked in the picture,  dress hooks  were extremely  tiny and  fell  apart on first use..."
2.0,Love the sizes but super hard to close. Otherwise perfect
2.0,"After waiting over a month I received these shorts.  I ordered a size large based on size chart and customer reviews.  They are a size large for an 8 year old, also, the fabric is frayed on the seams.  I have contacted seller to either get a refund or exchange.  Hopefully I will be able to get one of those options..  Just size up....way way up....if I exchange I will probably get a xxlarge!"
2.0,"hice la compra pero son demasiado chicos e incomodos , no fue lo que yo esperaba"
2.0,"The romper itself is cute, I like the pattern, and the material is nice. I have a pretty big 8 month old, so I ordered 6-12 months. It was huge. The bow on the headband is giant and floppy. I hated that. I’m returning the product. If it had fit well, the romper would be very cute. The headband, not so much."
2.0,My daughter has had this for 4 days and the paint on the charms is chipping off. The bracelet it self is ok...very disappointed
2.0,"It's cute, but not for me! And, as soon as I took it out of the package a button fell off.."
2.0,The foot part fit okay but these are not true wide calf boots. They came nowhere close to zipping together.
2.0,"The gloves are not form fitting and come off easily, especially when handling food.<br />I consider these a complete waste of money"
2.0,"I bought these to use as prescription glasses. However, the bridge is too small, making the lenses too close to each other. Also, my licensed optician told me that the way they are mounted will make it next to impossible to return them. I will not be able to use them."
2.0,Lost am owls eye the first couple weeks then 2 months they feel apart... not a great product
2.0,Had a hard time putting it on!
2.0,teen sizes? I am only a size 2 in women's apparel or maybe I got a bad one.
2.0,Doubt I can put more than one or two credit cards in it.<br />Description lousy.<br />Pretty is only as good as its usefulness.
2.0,Trail of feathers everywhere! Ok enough for a quick costume get up but it won’t last. Had to return
2.0,"Cheaply made, broke immediately"
2.0,Beautiful dress just runs very small.
2.0,Too fragile.  Scratches too easily.
2.0,"The instructions were not clear at all. We have struggled very much to set this watch properly, a real disappointment for my daughter who was so excited for her first watch."
2.0,Very tiny & the lenses scratch easily
2.0,Bathing suit does not fit well.
2.0,Would not fit a size 12. I could get them on but everytime I bent over they would completely expose the top of my butt. Disappointed and will be giving them away.
2.0,The sizing was awkward- too big in some places and too small in other places. I went to send it back and the shipping was $26.00... I am disappointed because Amazon always makes it easy to return. This seller is not easy.
2.0,Very cool looking. Just much smaller than they appear in the picture.
2.0,My husband had these for a couple of weeks before he wore them.  He said they were comfortable to wear.  He only wore them to work for 10 days when one of the loops that the laces go through broke off.  Luckily it happened 2 days before the last return date so we returned them for a new pair.  Hopefully the new pair will last longer.  I will update when after he wears the new pair.
2.0,Print was not true to photos.
2.0,Thin material and tears easily
2.0,Returned; didn’t like appearance.
2.0,"The scarf itself is okay. It’s a bit too thick for my liking but it’ll be nice for deep winter.<br /><br />The issue I had is- after getting a special card included in my package saying I could get a rebate and a friend could get theirs for free- I contacted them with the provided info, and was sent in circles. They wanted me to friend some scammy person on FB.. then just never got back to me about a rebate.. and my friends never got anything either after I referred them.<br /><br />Don’t include those deals in your package if you aren’t going to uphold them!<br /><br />Such a shame."
2.0,"This dress was a big miss.  The fabric was nice enough but the gold threads were coming out in certain places which cheapened the look.  I usually wear a 10/12 so I ordered the large (in Joie, I have both medium & large in my wardrobe), in this dress I would say it is more suited to size 14/16.  I returned it."
2.0,This is not breathable material! Very difficult for me to breathe
2.0,Fell apart immediately.
2.0,"The mask looked awesome, but fit as if it were made for a child. I'm really disappointed."
2.0,Fabric is great! Just runs small. Go up a size or 2. Depending on your fit level. Snug 1 size loosely 2 sizes
2.0,The sizing on these is inconsistent. I ordered 2g and only some of them fit properly. Some are so small they just slip right in and out. Others are so large I can't get them in comfortably.
2.0,Design is cute but the quality is terrible.  I've worn these socks no more than 3x each and 3 of the 4 pairs already have holes in them.
2.0,"I reviewed Only gave this a low review because it has released itself from my watch two times, and thank god I found my $800 watch both times. Scraping snow off of my truck it released from where it attaches to the watch. I noticed some times after I arrived at work. So I didn’t know where it came off or how. I found it near my parking spot at home thankfully. Thinking maybe I did something wrong, reattached it and wore it again. The following day, it just fell off my wrist on the floor and I noticed immediately. I never used the band again, even though it is more comfortable than the original band. The construction is durable with the exception of where it attaches to the watch"
2.0,"It doesnt fit like the photo, its more of a fitted blouse than a loose tunic looking top. I love Mordenmiss but this one doesnt quiet equal other items I have purchased."
2.0,"I gave to Star because they were pretty. The product itself on the other hand, was way small I wear medium and ordered a large, and they were still too small. I can wear them if they are uncomfortable"
2.0,My daughter is 6 months old. The hat is way too small and the gloves are way too big.
2.0,I don't like e cork's. To small in size
2.0,Ordered a medium was too small when stretched the black parts turn grey but the design is colored onto white tights the actual fabric isn’t designed like that if that make any since the tights were just plate white and they colored the print on them so when stretched out like tights do the print gets messed up
2.0,Not what I expected and even ordered size up.
2.0,Seems already split 2 weeks of wear and they slide down
2.0,"Dress super cute!!  However, really for a younger person as it was incredibly revealing at the busy.  Loved the little stomach cut out but was just to lie cut for me.  I should have really looked at the title but went off of the picture of the model"
2.0,Beautiful necklace but I ordered the letter “T” for my cousin Tess. When I opened the package I got the letter “K”. Upset but amused I really liked the necklace and I’m going to be keeping it because what a coincidence that my name is Kat. I would give it more stars but this was supposed to be her Christmas gift.
2.0,They slip off my head when I'm running.
2.0,"It wasn't made very well, strings and such where hanging off. But it's a coat and cute"
2.0,"Looks ok, But with continued wear looses all color and shine. Turned black"
2.0,did not like the cut of the top  the arms were snug - returned it
2.0,It doesn't fit my needs.  I need one that also holds a passport.
2.0,TOO SHORT.  MUCH SHORTER THEN IT SHOWED IN THE PICTURE.
2.0,Good fit but looked cheap. The extra ruffle of tulle was unnecessary and cheapened the overall look. For fit purposes I’m 5’6’ 145 lbs measurements -37 bust 28 “ waist 40” hip classic pear shape
2.0,They are all slightly different sizes and do not look nearly as well made as the picture depicts.
2.0,I dont know why I expected these shoes to be so much better than they are. I feel like Im walking on styrofoam. Not only that but on one of my shoes there was a big yellow mark across the white part of the heel. It wont come off and its pretty noticable. And not to mention they werent packaged very well because the box they were in showed up at my door step soaking wet. I paid $20 for these and I definately got what I paid for. It was a bad mistake on my part.
2.0,It's pretty but necklace broke on day 2.
2.0,"As others have mentioned, the packaging is really weird. I noticed right away that the soles were a hard plastic feel not a rubber grip feel. The inside was even more disappointing. The “fur” lining looked so cozy and soft but yet it is the thinnest layer leaving your foot feeling like it’s stepping on cardboard. These are going back. Not even going to attempt them outside."
2.0,"It’s excellent at not showing panty lines, however, it does not hold up all night.  The sticky adhesive does not work well with sweat.  Dancing all night the underwear kept falling off."
2.0,One of the sliders had rust on it which is really disappointing considering they're over $2 each.
2.0,"Nice design, plastic made to look like medal, not a reliable chain broke after two days, would only function as a lightly worn costume jewelry"
2.0,"Fit fine but fabric is cheapo, shiny and very poor quality. Returned it."
2.0,"Ordered a size up and was glad that I did b/c this runs small. The fit on the hat, headband and pants was odd. Never even used the hat or headband b/c both were so cheaply made and hat was so oddly shaped. Love the print on the pants, very cute. Just wish the overall product and fabric quality was better."
2.0,Stiff and scratch.  Even after several washes.  I wanted soft and cuddly but this isn't it.
2.0,Coat is not warm for cool weather.  Very cheap looking.
2.0,"The item was much smaller than the picture leads you to believe, was going to send it back, but not worth it."
2.0,Bought a medium as I am around a 32 inch waste and I was swimming in these. Would not describe these as shorts they are closer in length to capri's and certainly not slim fitting.
2.0,"Most of it leaked out in shipping.  They did give us a refund, but still wanted us to initially return the mostly bottle.<br /><br />Didn’t quite work as we hoped for our glasses either.<br /><br />Ended up just throwing away."
2.0,I ordered a 3 months and a 6 months size and they are the exact same size. I'm very disappointed with them. They are very cute but the sizing is terrible
2.0,"They are lightweight, but I didn’t like the quality of the lenses and the size +2.5 did not match, so I cannot wear. I ordered at the same time another pair from a different brand - they are perfect."
2.0,The picture of this product looks much better than what was delivered. I had my wife try it on and it just looked cheap. Not very happy with the product.
2.0,This is a womans size watch. Didn't show or state that in advertisement
2.0,"I love how soft they are and the colors, but they shrunk a whole size. I would recommend buying a size larger."
2.0,Súper small and the material is super rough!
2.0,Felt small and seemed cheaply made to me. I returned.
2.0,material too thin and runs small
2.0,"The idea is good. I really wanted to use the alarm function. However, i found that being shocked in the morning doesn't help me get up fully. I feel more tiring during the day. If you want to find something to get you out of bed. Get sleep as Android (yes im an Android user). It tracks your sleeping cycle and wakes you while you are in a good sleeping phase. For me it works way better than this. Plus, it saves you 150 dollars."
2.0,"While I did like the earrings and for only $10, I didn't expect much but what I got looks nothing like the earrings Ireceived. They are still drop earrings but the style is different than expected."
2.0,i am a5'3'' and i feel it is a tad bit small for me
2.0,Jeans are very nice looking but it’s not true to size
2.0,"Way too small! Seems like little kid sizes, not women’s. Returning these!"
2.0,"Thin, T-shirt like fabric. Not what I expected."
2.0,Mine is very small. Wanted some room brought an xl it fits but it is cut like a small. Not sure if keeping<br />It is pretty
2.0,I bought this because my<br />Son started private school and they have to wear bow ties. After wearing it once it broke . We haven't had this issue with any other tie but this one.
2.0,I got this for maternity wear for a vacation since it was flexible but it looks nothing like the photo and not the best quality... it is light which is nice and it is great for a throw on and head to the beach but not for going out anywhere like a beach restaurant. A bit frumpy in nature and the color dye isn’t the best quality  ... im 36dd and it was snug on my breast. Hope this helps ! If it was half the price ($10) it would be worth it for sure ...
2.0,"Cute design, but runs super small and poorly made! Returned it and bought another brand!"
2.0,Size small was about a child’s large.  It was see through so I had to return.
2.0,"Part of this could have been a nice looking bracelet, the other part is cheap and heavy metals that aren't nice. The gold plating or coloring isn't evenly applied. It's like they almost had a good idea, but the execution of it failed."
2.0,"The frames are stylish and nicely made, but I bought these specifically because I wanted a non-prescription glass lens. The lenses are plastic."
2.0,"This ran small, and the material was not what I expected.  I thought this was a tee-shirt fabric, and it was more of a silky fabric. Even so, I LOVE cherry prints and would have possibly kept this, but it ran small. And the quality overall in the stitching seemed questionable, even at this low price point. So I returned this dress."
2.0,I sized up and still couldn’t even get these leggings on! Pictured here are these leggings in a Large on top of Victoria Secret leggings which were Medium size. Will be returning them.<br /><br />Gave 2 stars because the material and color are nice.
2.0,"While they look nice while folded, some the the rings are ill-fitted and don't actually spin. You can open the outermost ring because it grinds on the inner ring."
2.0,I loved the product. My baby girl is 7 months with very small feet so they fit her big but that's okay because I put them on like ankle bracelets for now. The only problem is that there was a missing pair. I only received 1 hot pink sandal :(
2.0,"Cute but arrived tarnished and looked like somebody had worn it then decided to return it. Again, the cat faces are very cute but these earrings are impractical, the tails are too long to “hug” securely around the ear lobe."
2.0,"The band on this ring is very thin, and the prongs sit up too high.  I woild like to return the product, but it looks like I will need to pay to return it.  I have returned poor quality merchandise in the pasr with no issue, but the options to return this ring are limited.  Buyer Beware on this product."
2.0,"The product is super cute and I love the design. However, it ran small. I'm normally an XL and the shirt was 2-3 sizes too small for me"
2.0,Selves are too long for the cropped style of the shirt. It is also thicker than I was expecting. Too bad.
2.0,"I wanted the hat and would have ordered it, BUT! ill never pay 20 or more dollars for a hat with a cheap plastic closure. tacky!"
2.0,Somewhat cheaply made. I returned it.
2.0,Cant see the picture because of the way the mask fits. It folds funny and is uncomfortable. Weird fit. Would NOT recommend.
2.0,I thought I would really love this shirt but the material is very clingy and definitely need to order up one to two sizes
2.0,"Regret buying these, I thought they would be more compact."
2.0,Gave it away waste of my money. .
2.0,The fringe does not cover the entire belt. The fringe only appears on the front. Poorly made. 1/4 of the fringe was already coming off by the time I received it.
2.0,Necklace badly tangled and I am still working on it.  I ordered 2 and both came in the same condition
2.0,Was very disappointed in the size. It did not fit the one size fits all feature. I like the material and style.
2.0,They were real nice until they drop on the ground. After a few days they fell on the ground and the plastic just snapped. First time I ever dropped them and unfortunately the last.
2.0,"Fits kinda weird, top part is to large and doesn’t hang right. The rest is very tight fitted. It is a very cute design but it just doesn’t look right when on."
2.0,"poorly sewn, puckered side seams"
2.0,doesn't look like the pictures
2.0,The dress I received was not exactly the same as pictured. The sleeves were shorter and the lace detailing is different. I ordered according to the sizing chart and it was way off. More like an actual 2-3T. According to the size chart my average size 5 year old is a 2. I ordered another style from the same company and the 2 is a bit on the right side but is wearable. I also ordered the 4 in that style and it’s exactly the same as the 2 except longer. Order at your own risk. This is a Chinese company with very inconsistent sizing and products.
2.0,"I have bought this brand before, and am happy overall. Bought glasses with a blue reflective coating. Coating is wearing off after little usage of the sunglasses."
2.0,Was good at 1st . Having about a month it stop working !! Was way bummed !
2.0,"The pattern is not polka dots- look closely at the forehead part, it’s like ovals and it’s a weird polyester material.  Return was painless, which was nice.  It was also really big (and I have a big noggin"
2.0,Size a little small.
2.0,Was disappointed because it had two different material in the order one off it couldn’t fit it had no stretch in it
2.0,I di not get the right thing
2.0,top material is not good
2.0,"The quality is just dreadful, particularly for the relatively high price point. Will definitely be returning."
2.0,"This kimono gets rave reviews, so I expected something great. And the color (Green 2, palm print) is pretty. Unfortunately, I think the top runs small/short and is made from a scratchy fabric.  It's not the worst, given the price, but I would not recommend."
2.0,"These were too small for my husband.  He has a regular sized head, lol."
2.0,They're bent weird
2.0,Does not last long for $20. It’s costly to replace these batteries all the time.
2.0,Fits comfortably but not durable at all! Strap broke on my first use! Not the easiest to remove also!
2.0,"I always wanted this shirt, and I thought about ordering an xxl thinking it would shrink a lot , but instead I ordered an xl due to the extra charge<br />what a stupid thing to do, after washing it according to the label instructions it shrunk like crazy, my own fault I guess but it could be a better quality t shirt for the price."
2.0,Advertised as a dress but it is a tunic top. Runs small and very thin material.
2.0,"This is a beautiful shirt that fits nicely and comes in great colors. I ordered 7 of them. The problem is the label which is very irritating. Usually that’s fairly easy to take care of, but not here. The label is very firmly attached with a clear plastic filament thread. It’s extremely difficult, even using a hem ripper, to remove without damaging the delicate fabric and, in fact, I ruined one shirt in the process. After spending hours the labels are gone, but in some cases have left very tiny holes which will not be noticeable unless they get larger. Some will suggest leaving the labels alone and just wearing this over a t shirt, but to me that compromises the fit. So, a very nice shirt that is sorely compromised by a label."
2.0,Ok but plastic. I was not expecting that.
2.0,very difficult to put on.  they are in a drawer now.
2.0,Looks super cute but they were way too large and I am too lazy to bother returning them :(
2.0,I have many of the 90 degree leggings however these are my least favorite. The waist is tight and very very high. I love the tummy control capris but these are awkward.
2.0,Not In love with this bra. It is cute but if<br />You have larger breasts the cup is a little bit too small.  The fit is odd but I decided to keep it.  I am glad I read the reviews because it does run very small!
2.0,"Gloves are not any size fits all. I'm 5'10"" and 200pds, only fits to mid arm."
2.0,"Fun moment, but I can’t get the alcohol/preservative smell to go away."
2.0,"I really wish this had worked for me, because it is both comfortable and pretty. I just wanted something strapless that was easy to throw on under casual tops with a wide dolman neckline, sleeveless loose tanks, or tops with unlined lace across the shoulders where bra straps would show through. The silicone strips on many higher-quality strapless bras irritates my skin very quickly. Unfortunately of course one size really can't fit all and I am definitely on the small end (33&#34; chest, 32B bra size). This was far-and-away too big for me (cups were huge for me, band was too loose). I think it would be great for more average-sized women but based on my experience am guessing this will work only if you are something like 36C and up. If this were offered in several size options, it would be perfect, ESPECIALLY because the padding is good so unlike with many bandeaus, you don't have to worry about nipple show-through."
2.0,"Wanted this simple white dress for a wedding shower in a few weeks, but it's super see-through and I will be returning. Granted, I'm wearing dark undergarments, but even if they were light I would not be comfortable wearing this without a slip. It also feels like pretty cheap quality. Not a fan, I guess you get what you pay for. It also felt a little big"
2.0,"In addition to feeling completely synthetic, these pants are huge at the waist and have a saggy-baggy crotch. I'm 4'11, 105 lbs, and got a 0P. Really odd fit. Hard pass."
2.0,It's thinner than I expected.
2.0,Fabric is way too slippery...it won't stay on my hair!!  Very disappointing.
2.0,"Was not what I thought! Cute, but too thin!"
2.0,"This shirt was both too small and too big at the same time. My girlfriend ordered a size small after reviewing the size chart. The top of the shirt was too tight, but it was way too big through the waist and hips."
2.0,"I loved it. Its cute and works wonderfully with my professional attire I wear daily. However, I've only had it a couple of weeks at it broke, one of the pins came out. I'll order a new one from another company."
2.0,Way to expnesive and cheap quality
2.0,When will I learn?  This item must be modeled on someone who is 5 ft or less. It is so short! I won't return it as that will cost more than the original sweater.  Maybe my grade school age niece can wear it.
2.0,These are very cute but don’t fit as expected
2.0,"I have been losing weight and I questioned if I should go with my normal size of XL or get a L in anticipation of losing more weight. I went with the XL because I didn't want to have to wait to wear them. Well, I got them and tried them on and had to triple check my order that I in fact didn't order the L instead because they are sooooo tight and almost impossible to get on! The only hope I have is to actually lose the weight I am hoping to otherwise these will end up being donated.<br /><br />*edit* I have lost the weight and while they were easier to get on, the waist is not tall enough so they slide down constantly and I have to keep pulling them back up. I lowered my rating because of this."
2.0,"Pretty watch, but not really my style. I wanted a gold watch to add to my collection, but I will continue the search. I don’t like the tone of the gold, it is just too yellow (compared to the photo presented) for me so the watch looks weird on my wrist. I also don’t like how it doesn’t have a moving hand so the time will just move on it’s own, which is not standard. I didn’t realize it until I received the package. Great watch for those who want something flashy for the nights out. Not an everyday watch."
2.0,"Seemed to install well, but lost watch an hour later.  Had pulled hard on each side, but still came apart easily.  I think it is on the design of the Fitbit, not the band maker.  For a 179.00 watch I have to feel very insecure about it when I wdear it!"
2.0,"This shirt I was swimming in, could have been a dress, not so flattering"
2.0,I ordered a 3x and the t was obviously an extra small even though it sas marked as 3x in another language on the plastic bag.<br />Material seems very flimsy.  I have purchased this item at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest unbiased and prompt review and have done my best to provide that. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.
2.0,Showed it was lined and short had no lining. Ordered for mother 94 yrs old and she kept it but wanted lining
2.0,"I was very excited for this product. The style is great and very fashionable. However, the quality is very lacking. The interior open pockets were poorly sitched on and fell off quickly, the interior zipper pocket's zipper fell off as well and the magnetic class that is supposed to hold the bag shut is not very magnetic and doesn't hold the flap down well. Overall I would not buy this product again."
2.0,"The dress fit fine, but they didn't take care to line up the pattern correctly like they did in the picture, and because it uses a lot of panels, looked like a total mess."
2.0,"I really dislike the fit of the dress. The straps are long and not adjustable so they say even though the sleeves are off the shoulder. It's very uncomfortable because of the straps. Also, when I raised my arms the sleeves  did not stay off the shoulder. They rose up.<br />I thought I'd cut off the straps to see if I would like it better but I didn't try because of the sleeves.<br />You get what you paid for with this dress."
2.0,Good costume prop but thats about it.
2.0,This scarf was not as full as it looks in the picture.
2.0,"Torn after using 3 times, not good."
2.0,Spins on your neck
2.0,"This is very thin, cheaply made and something you can wear until it needs to be washed and then hold your breath. Disappointed in this purchase. This experience has shown me I have to read all comments before placing an order."
2.0,"Okay…. No joke, this is a great price. However, they are in no way “high quality”. A few of them really shrink after the first wash and are really warped. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to wear some of them."
2.0,"Ugly unless your thin. I'm not sure if its because I'm short or a little heavy, but either way, it was not attractive. It looked like I was wearing my grandmother's gown. Returned it."
2.0,The images are dishonest. The colours are way off. I got the brown because I have a black pair and wanted a pair of nude (caramel brown) which is how they look in the picture online. The ACTUAL colour is very dark brown- about 4 shades darker than the picture. They are almost black like the ones I have now (see side by side pic) . I shouldn’t have to pay shipping to return them if the description was untrue.
2.0,"After wearing for under 2 hours, most of the lights just burned out! A waste of money!"
2.0,Seams came apart after 1st wash. Disappointed as the fit was good.
2.0,I don’t like the material looks so fake 😒
2.0,Turned silver after like a week
2.0,Too tight compared to their other tops I purchased
2.0,The sandals flt tight at first which is to be expected! I had to cut away some of the top band between my toes to alleviate the pain! Sandals are comfortable now!
2.0,The water resistance on actual watch says 3ATM instead of 5ATM in the Product Description.<br /><br />The differences are:<br />3ATM - Water resistant to 30 meters (100 feet). Will withstand splashes of water or rain but should not be worn while swimming or diving.<br />5ATM - Water tested to 50 meters (165 feet). Suitable for showering or swimming in shallow water.
2.0,"made ok, but was too small!"
2.0,I bought this for my granddaughter she loves cats. She was so thrilled to get it and so disappointed to have it break the first time she wore it to school. I was disappointed at the quality of the chain. I definitely got what I paid for.
2.0,I’m about 5’10” and it just didn’t sit right on my hips. Otherwise it was great!
2.0,Returning.  Material is too thin and it's not long enough in the back.
2.0,Not at all as pictured.  Pretty disappointed.  It was dark green and did not even look like the real turtles.  I had to wear it anyways for lack of time.
2.0,It's really a youth hat not an adult
2.0,"The hunt continues for a not see through white dress... Sadly this is far from it. A) it’s off white. B) it’s tissue paper thin. The size was good... I’m typically a s-m went med bc you always size up with white. The material is super soft and kinda clingy, but man is it thin. You can even see my seamless nude undies in pic. Maybe better in a darker color."
2.0,Cheap cheap cheap quality! Looks nice though! I had to bend to fit my face
2.0,Quality is subpar. Feels like a used towel. Look somewhere else.
2.0,"Not worth the price for the quality. I could buy better at most stores, and for less. Disappointed."
2.0,These bracelets are very small! Almost child like.
2.0,The right shoe is not charging only after being hooked up to the charger for a second time.  I think the pins in the charger may be damaged.
2.0,"It is not long enough to sit well on the body, and not short enough to hit high enough on the chest. I never wear it!"
2.0,did not fit well. not as expected.
2.0,"Received the necklace , it’s ok<br />Thank you<br />Copekecope@aol.com<br />Looks cheap"
2.0,Laces broke 5th time I wore them. Still waiting on a new set from Lugz.
2.0,"Way too see through! The material is so cheap and unflattering,  definitely not worth the price. I was fooled by some of the pictures on other reviews but this is not good quality and it shows. For this price you're better off buying a dress on sale at another higher quality  retailer."
2.0,"Cheap material,  not true to size,  not as in picture."
2.0,VERY disappointed... some of the ear straps FALL OFF AS SOON AS YOU TAKE OUT OF BOX...NOT SAFE and a real bummer especially for our 5year old that loves sea creatures...
2.0,"For the money, I am sure it was fine however, it was too cheaply made for me to wear and the color was an electric blue and very periwinkle"
2.0,"Thin and flimsy, but for the price, I didn't expect much.  I suspect it will fade, but it makes pretty good char  cloth."
2.0,The material is straight polyester. Definitely cuter in the pictures than it is in person!
2.0,With only three days light use the seams began to open up and the fuschia pink coating on the gloves began to wear off.<br />Grandchild a mild mannered granddaughter. Hope the black ones her brother got work out better for him. Did offer a quick return.
2.0,"I ordered the light blue dress twice because it did not come as pictured. The photo on the item is a stock photo from Google. The coloring is similar, but the detailing on the chest is not. Flimsy zipper and poor quality straps. Almost to my ankles, not mid calf. Will return."
2.0,I ordered 2X Large and that's what the tag says but these must run incredibly small.
2.0,"I have already worn, or I would return. It constantly rolls up. The seam is unfinished. Not worth the money."
2.0,Sides and back are tough to fit - very pretty though
2.0,"The beads are pretty, but it says for men and women, the bag I received said MENS. FIRST, they were very loose and I bought the drawstring ones just encase so I can make it fit better if my wrist was too petite. The string is pulled to max in picture. SECOND, they are different lenghts so I counted the beads and there are 7 beads each section and one had 6, which Is why one bracelet fits the wrist, if I could remove a bead off each bracelet they would fit me better. THIRD, the drawstrings are sooo long they look messy and hang."
2.0,I ordered XL.  The cut is very small.  Fits like a large slim.
2.0,It fits small and short.  It's also transparent.  I can't return it so I'm using it to sleep in or to lounge around the house.
2.0,Watch feels nice.. But came in faulty.. Second hand sticks between 12 and 1 causing watch to go off timing.. Had to bring it to repair
2.0,Belt is cheap quality and looks that way. Part of it fell off before I even wore it
2.0,Very weird fit. Extremely boxy and uncomfortable. I let it sit on the hanger for a few days hoping it would relax a bit and it didn’t so I returned it.
2.0,"Loved the quality, but the size was too small. Size 2-4 toddler was very tight on my just turned two yr old girl. And the next line is too low."
2.0,My kids love to wear headbands but this one is not impressive and doesn’t hold much. Seems like a flimsy piece of fabric without any purpose. Waste of money. Gave it 2 stars because someone took time to cut it and package it.
2.0,I was most excited about them glowing in the dark and they barley glow :(
2.0,"Makes my neck itchy as all hell, very pretty although"
2.0,this bathing suit was different.. I ordered a medium -(which I usually take) the bottoms were to small and the top to big. Plus the picture is much prettier than when I received it.
2.0,Didn't expect them to be that small
2.0,"MY WATCH IS 22MM I ORDERED THAT YET ITS STILL TOO SMALL, ON BUCKLE TO SECURE IT TO YOUR WRIST PIN THAT GOES THROUGH THE HOLE IS TOO SMALL, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."
2.0,"Wanted so much to like these, especially for the supposed anti-fog coating, as I frequently check my activity tracker underwater.  Liked how they had their own protective case and earplugs and nose bridges attachments was nice touch, but.....from the first use, the clear goggles fogged up within 5 minutes, though it cleared up on it's own after a couple minutes.  No issue with the mirrored pair and both fit very well with no leaks, so ordered another set.  In the meantime, after about 3 uses, the clear goggles started fogging up almost immediately and did not clear up.  Tried many tightness settings and no use, even after rinsing goggles out, fogged right up again, to where they are almost useless.  Gave second set to brother as a gift and he found that the mirrored pair had a split in the rubber seal above the eyes and leaked immediately.  He's since used the clear set and experienced same issue as me.  Despite good price, won't be buying another set when you're lucky to end up with 1 functional pair out of the set."
2.0,It's large but it's not wide enough to hold much. Do not rip the tag off it will tear it. It will be cute for a gift bag for someone who likes football.
2.0,"This bag is large. I thought I was ordering an actual purse, this is more like an overnight bag."
2.0,"It doesn't fit well! However, the color is beautiful."
2.0,"Very maternity! Cute shirt, but if you're looking for coverage and you're not pregnant, this is not the shirt for you."
2.0,Tarnished pretty quickly after a couple of wears :(
2.0,The material was very thin and more like a costume material. Also was boxy on my figure.
2.0,This was a beautiful band but it broke two weeks later. 😔
2.0,Much larger than the picture makes it appear. My daughter did not like it.
2.0,They look like the photo but they fit weird in the butt and won’t stay up. Super annoying when working out
2.0,One pair didn’t make it a week. And we aren’t rough on stuff. Boo. They were cute while they lasted. The seal also was suboptimal.
2.0,"The set included 2 sets of Jammie’s, however one set had bottoms that were not sewn, the Woody bottoms. Disappointed since this was a gift and I didn’t realize till the gift went home with the parents."
2.0,This was a cheaper made dress. I ordered two from different sellers. This one had a crummy zipper. I liked it but the neckline was not flattering.
2.0,Adorable suit....but runs small. Large will fit C cup max and more like a size 8 on the bottoms.
2.0,real thin cheap material. hard pass.
2.0,Love this beautiful watch . Unlike a lot of heavy steel band watches ( I have been gifted some that were so heavy I hated to use them ) it is light fits perfectly and is very good looking. A great buy at a great price also. In addition you wind it up . UPDATE my love of this watch changed in about a week as I was no longer able to move the hands to set the time. Buyers should also be aware that this is a windup watch that requires manual winding for 30 secs every day or so as it will start losing time as it winds down.
2.0,"The skirt photographs well, but it didn’t really translate in real life for me."
2.0,"I almost always wear a large. I am 5'4, size 12, and 175 lbs.I bought a medium because of the length. Did not want it to fit like a dress. The length fit exactly like it appears That was great. However, the neck does not hug like it does in the pic. It sits very loose. Also, was not happy with the quality of the material for $22. It was rather thin. I've paid under $20 for other tunics and have been pleased with the material. I recommend A&D for quality. Will not purchase this brand again."
2.0,They turn
2.0,Overalllls are cute however the holes in the leg are MUCH bigger than pictured. There were strings hanging from the holes that had to be torn off because it looked trashy and cheap.  there were several areas that were torn vertically all the way down past the knee. the first time wearing these the holes tore more throughout the day. By the end of day one half of one leg was exposed from upper thigh  to below the knee. I took my needle and lots of thread and had to sew them back together in a way that worked. I haven't washed them yet but I'm expecting that I will need to repair them again if possible. I do not suggest ordering unless you are prepared to be seamstress.
2.0,In the picture you can see the tree clearly.  The pendant that I gave as a gift was crowded with random size purple stones that obscured the tree outline.
2.0,For one size fits all I expected more room..  I am returning this product as it is falling a part.  Strings everywhere.
2.0,The entire lens is magnified as opposed to just the lower portion
2.0,"It broke the first day I wore it when the &#34;leather&#34; band fell off of the face of the watch.  I used JB-Weld to reconnect it and it has been fine ever since (we're going on a whole week now).  I LOVE the look of the watch and it runs fine, but just a heads up, the quality may be a little bit lacking. :/"
2.0,Didn't do much for me for my night vision.  Ok construction.
2.0,Doesn't fit well and fabric is cheap
2.0,"Out of all the bands I was able to use a few of them, most  were damaged so they wouldn't fit my Fitbit properly."
2.0,"The latest trend in menswear is the Hawaiian shirt. Most seem to be slim-fit. My husband normally wears a Large, but because of the slim-fit, I ordered an XL. Well, this is a true XL. It's huge. I also thought the linen material was rather cheap. Returned it. I ordered another SSLR shirt in XL, this one was cotton, and it fit my husband well. It ran small. Quality of the cotton shirt was very good."
2.0,Looked great was the right color but way to small and we ordered it 2 sizes bigger than his normal size.
2.0,Material is cheap. Pockets are fake.
2.0,"While the color and stitching is great, it doesn't fit like the picture at all. The sleeves come just past the elbow and the back falls at your lower back. It is much more fitted than what is depicted."
2.0,Ima try ma best to shrink... not worth the money if your thick and not bbw
2.0,Necklace fell apart after a day wearing it.
2.0,"I wanted to love thi dress.  The style is very cute and it fits well, however I hate the fabric it's very cheap looking and costume like. I will be returning this."
2.0,"Super cute.  My toddlers aren’t super rough, but definitely did one karate chop with it and it snapped into two.  Better served for older kids, decoration etc, not playing."
2.0,The jacket fits well and looks good but the top snap came apart leaving a hole where it was .
2.0,"The chain was thinner than we expected.  Also, the bear had the I Love you sign but it was printed in mirror image so it was backwards"
2.0,It's a little small and very hard to clean. The quality is not as good as imagined. NOT recommend
2.0,"Ordered the same one in October, in a different color,  and it was a perfect fit. This one didn't fit, it was too tight. Trying to return it & am being told that I have to pay to ship it back. Order from the same company thru Amazon.  Not happy about that, what happened to free returns???"
2.0,"Love the idea but didn't sit right on me. 5"" 4' 115lbs"
2.0,Fine band but it broke within two weeks of wear.... The pin holding in the band broke off (first picture is with pin attached on another one of these that I bought second picture is the broken one)
2.0,Too big. Over priced
2.0,"Looks great, nice quality leather. Unfortunately, the clasp that is used to adjust the length of the band is loose, and becomes loose at the most inopportune times, such as once in the men's restroom, and another time when in a snowy parking lot, in both cases leading to the watch falling face down. Very lucky the face did not shatter. Have to tape or glue the offending clasp permanently so that the watch doesn't fall off my hand again."
2.0,"weird looking shape of frames, but again other people might like this style"
2.0,The costume looked how it should have but was several sizes too large despite me sending them my exact sized upon purchase
2.0,Very solf and love the cold should but fits really large.
2.0,"Got a large, wanting this to be over sized. It fit overall small, the neckline was not open like the photo of the model<br />Most disappointed with the fabric quality: the fabric was very scratchy, has little stretch, is thick,  and does not drape."
2.0,"I sent them back. The back rim doesn't stay on so they are more like ill-fitting flip flops. In addition, the left slipper was noticably wider than the right."
2.0,Looks cute in the picture.  Not cute in person.  The fabric should not be classified as fabric.  Its more like plastic.  I did not like the feel of this at all.
2.0,didn't like the fit or the design
2.0,"Was somewhat unravelling. Didn't notice when I purchased but this is &#34;Asian sizing&#34; so, needless to say, unless you're a toddler this will probably not fit you"
2.0,"Doesn't stay on my foot like other slippers with cross strap in this size,the strap also detached from slipper,very disappointed"
2.0,i'm guessing their  sizing guide is taken from american sizes because i purchased a XL and it fits more like a medium<br />also its sort of thin
2.0,Some what to large
2.0,First day of school today. Strap to book bag tore on the way to the bus stop. Lasted about ten minutes.
2.0,I bought this to go under a bridesmaids dress. It worked of for an hour or two but by the end of the day it had started to come unstuck under my boobs and was scratching and poking me very uncomfortable while I'm trying to stand still next to the bride while shes saying her vows.
2.0,Very pretty but very small. I have a small wrist but this must be for kids not adults. I'm returning it.
2.0,Bad quality and small in size. Please check size chart properly before buying this stuff.
2.0,"These ""progressive"" lens are NOT what they claim.. Seems the whole lens IS the ""number"" & there's NO top # or ""bottom"" #.. When I held them out so I could SEE where the progression starts / ends etc., I could not tell any difference from TOP, middle or bottom.. these are basically JUST ""READERS""..<br />AND the lenses do NOT seem to be as ""dark"" as in the advert pic.. more on the gray side.. ??"
2.0,"Fits small. Let me know when you make a size 13. I take a 12 in normal shoes, but would need a 13 from these manufacturers."
2.0,Loved the watch. I bought it for my hubby but hate that it stop working after only having the watch a month
2.0,On the darker side and rather dull stone. Would not buy again. Though size is nice-not too small
2.0,This product was ok. It didn’t really work for the costume.
2.0,"As others have said, the sleeves are a little tight.  I could have worked with that, but the pockets were right up under my breast line.  If the pockets had been down at my hips, I would have kept this, but had to return it because it just didn't look right."
2.0,It’s a cute dress but the buttons are fake and it looks very obvious and ridiculous in person.
2.0,Don’t buy this umbrella.
2.0,"I'm 5""4 and they were too long for me to wear even with heels"
2.0,Material unexpected. Writing on pants did not fit my character
2.0,It is not the style as shown.  It has a round neck not a v-neck line.  Too Long  Pretty color though
2.0,Was not a good fabric at all. To many mistake as they sewed
2.0,vegan leather is not very pretty - the inside looks more like cardboard instead of RFID blocking liner.  The outside looks cheap.  It has a big tacky looking logo glued to the outside. It is a disappointment.  I will be ordering a replacement from a different company.
2.0,The shirt itself I like. They send the shirts in the wrong colors though
2.0,It was ok until it blew out on one glove the second night of usage
2.0,"They don’t have any stretch or flexibility to them. If you have a booty or bottom heavy, these aren’t for you."
2.0,I read all the reviews I measured myself I’m a 34C currently 145lbs and the zipper cannot zip past my waist I’m so disappointed 😔 wanted to wear this dress this weekend for my husbands birthday I bought a medium I always get medium
2.0,My kid (8) loved this bracelet. But it broke in 2 days. Quality isn’t great
2.0,I LOVED these when I got them in the mail... I wore the one with the blue stone for about a week and unfortunately one spot on bottom area irritated my skin and caused me to have to take it out. I'm not sure if its missing a clear coat area on the back and the metal is bothering my skin or what. Bummed because these are well made and beautiful!
2.0,Runs a lot smaller than true sizes.
2.0,"I hope this is going to be a good bag as long as I can get the goat smell to go away.  I bought 2 of these bags - 1 for a college graduation gift for my neice and 1 just for mysekf. I have had to treat the bag with a cleaner, hyde rejuvinator and the a conditioner.  The goat hyde smell is so bad that I can only hope after these treatments that it will smell like traditional leather.  I also had to do the treatment because one of the bags strap was so dry that it would have continued to dry up and eventually break. The strap for my bag is absolutely fine. The pamplet says the natural smell is on purpse because that is the way the company that makes them preference - although I wish this was disclosed on line so I could have had my preference.  It has been a week after treatments and hanging them to air out and the goat hyde smell is still pretty bad.  The money I spent is going to go to waste - I am going to hope for the best that after a couple of weeks it will have the traditional leather smell and I will be able to use it.  *note - I am not bagging on this company for making a natural product.  And I honestlt never write reviews - this is my own personal preference and it was a gift in which neither of us gals are in to that &#34;natural earthy goat hyde&#34; smell.  Good luck!"
2.0,"The grey color is very nice. However, they are extremely stiff and feel like cardboard. My baby doesn’t like to wear them."
2.0,ft is very small
2.0,If you want something to wear for a day or two hard to tighten and fit your nose.
2.0,It was a little small compared to most shirts. As long as it takes to ship there and back its a lot of work to try and exchange.
2.0,"Very disappointed<br />Color is pumpkin, orange<br />There is absolutely no red in it<br />Was going to wear it for July 4 but would look quite preposterous with a blue and white jacket"
2.0,Really cute but they keep flipping so I had to crazy glue the chain and tassel together.
2.0,"The ties are very high on this product. In fact, one of the privacy ties is attached to the armpit. It is overall small in length and width, even though I bought one size larger than needed."
2.0,Disappoint
2.0,Unless you’re a size 0 or a 12-year-old child I would not recommend getting the ass LOL
2.0,"The design is decent, looks as described but its durability is weak. It ripped inside my uniform and I didnt even do any physical labor.<br />It lasted about a month"
2.0,Different color and poorly constructed. Photo looks super cool compared to the real thing
2.0,This was beautiful and the size was great but ripped apart within an hour of wearing. The elastic on the shoulders came undone.  I had to safety pin myself together or I would of been exposed.
2.0,I love the way the shirt looks and all but the picture on there is super stiff and makes the shirt feel really weird!!! And way to soften it up a bit? Bought it as a gift for someone and its kinda disappointing.
2.0,"These are red, not purple at all. I got another pair from them and these aren't even the same mattrial. They are not as comfortable and don't look as nice as the others."
2.0,cotton fabric snags easily very bright colors very warm scarf Iwill save it for  wear with a jacket or raincoat
2.0,They arrived broken. I had to get another pair
2.0,Cute but runs small. Order 2 sizes up.
2.0,Huge!  I sent them back
2.0,nada bien
2.0,Description SAYS sterling silver but it is not. Jump ring came apart and it had to be fixed which is when I discovered it wasn't sterling.
2.0,very poor quality. I actually got laughed at after opening the package and showing a friend.
2.0,Unsmapped so easy and the orange colored one was missing a snap. I lost my white and black ones already due to them coming unsnapped. ; (
2.0,I like the style but not the material
2.0,Material was really cheap not all what expected
2.0,"The design is great but it's sized wrong. If you buy the bra in your correct size, it fits exactly that size. The problem is, that gives no compression and does not prevent bounce. It just fits like a normal bra but a little big. At my normal size, the bands on this bra are on the intermost hooks and there is plenty of bounce in the bust. I would actually recommend this if you want a bra for doing chores around the house but I wouldn't recommend a brisk walk or run in it. You may be able to order down 2 rib and cup sizes to make it work."
2.0,The color pink on the band isn't as bright as shown. Color of band doesn't match as advertised.
2.0,I had to give this to my 3-year old after I tried it on.  Much smaller than expected.
2.0,"I bought  my in the band & my cup size, DD.  It was clearly for some other breast size (flat????).  In any case, I was hanging out EVERYWHERE and you could see straight through it.  I gave them an extra star because my money back."
2.0,"This is silky, shines material that looks quite cheap."
2.0,The neck area when putting it on  Wasn’t the way a graduation scarf was suppost to fit  on the neck . It was crooked .
2.0,Sloppy and heavy
2.0,"Just opened this and am not at all impressed. Quality isn't terrible for price, but still not what I expected. I would not trust this to hold more than costume jewelry. I bought to keep two Tiffany's necklaces from tangling while wearing and with a baby and a toddler around, I don't trust it. The magnet is very weak. A slight tug and there go your necklaces. I packaged right back up and will be returning."
2.0,Washed it 2 times and it’s pilling already .The sizes run very large.
2.0,"Bought these for my 14 yr old son who suffers from plantar fascitis.  He told me that they looked like old grandma shoes.  They were also too small and I would guess run at least 1 size too small and were not very wide either, although they were ordered as wide.  His 70 yr old grandma saw them and loved them!  Enough said!"
2.0,"So comfortable and warm but every time I wash it, it balls up and looks old. I have to shave it every time I wear it."
2.0,Like the color but for sizing it as XL is misleading to the customer. Maybe in China it would fit okay but not in US. The fit is too snug and should actually be sized as a medium for US sizing charts. Dissapointed...
2.0,"Unfortunately I had to return these. I bought my normal size and I could barely even pull them up, they were so tight. Order a size bigger for sure. But, even then, I felt the waist was unusually small and tight."
2.0,"They looked nice, but my daughter usually wears a size 2, I ordered size 4 based on the reviews and she still couldn't even get her foot in them. They are ridiculously tiny."
2.0,I'm not using these because they won't stay on my feet. There is very little fabric on the back of the slipper to wrap around my heel and keep it from falling off of my foot.
2.0,"Great feeling material.  However, the Joseph Abboud’s waist band fails to hold and rolls down around my abdomen forming a “rope-like” compression that I find uncomfortable and annoying beyond words."
2.0,Love these shoes. They run 1/2 size smaller had to return  them...what a nite mare with the return.I think the rep was a new person. But I plan on reordering them.hope I never get her again
2.0,"I didn’t realize / read that this a no return on this.  I bought two different ones to try on and see quality.<br /><br />Nicely made, but to big for my face. Sooo 🤷🏻‍♀️ Now I’m stuck with it."
2.0,"Very cute set, but the hat has no stretch. I have a small head and it still does not fit! Only kept it because I needed the jewelry at that moment. But I could have found the jewelry for cheaper somewhere else if I didn't want the hat"
2.0,It doesn't fit snug. It seems way too large for normal adult size head. Shame because the design was nice!
2.0,The material the dress was made of didn't mix with the style of dress.  The material was too heavy.
2.0,"I DO LIKE THE NECKLACE, BUT THE CLASP DOESN'T WORK.  HAD TO BUY A NEW CHAIN FOR IT."
2.0,"It’s comfortable but I couldn’t stand the smell of it, smells burned rubber ,smells so bad makes me gag! I tried leaving it under the Sun hoping the smells would go away but it made it stronger."
2.0,"It is really cute, but within a day the stones started falling off. I realize it wasn't a lot of money, but I had hoped the stones would make it at least a few days."
2.0,"I think overall it could be a nice top but too small...It's small for an XL but, the material has nice feeling."
2.0,I was supposed to receive a 3 pack and only received 2 pairs. They are nice gloves though.
2.0,"I bought these glasses under the impression that they were more or a rectangular frame. The photo (singular as they only provided one) created the perception that they were a lot wider than they were tall, which is what I was shopping for. However, I have no need for a pair of sunglasses that extend to above my eyebrows. The Lens quality was very nice, though the frames felt a bit cheap. Will still wear them anyways because I did pay for them. Attached is a forward facing picture of the glasses so as to not deceive you."
2.0,They are very comfortable on my 2 year old son. He loves wearing them but they only last a couple weeks before they start falling apart around the toes. I have bought 6 or 7 pairs in the past year and a half which seems a bit excessive. You're probably wondering why I would keep buying them if they fall apart so fast. I was trying to give them the benefit of a doubt since my son is so confortable in them. I even tried buying them from department stores instead of online to see if there was any difference but there unfortunately wasn't. I wouldn't recommend these shoes due to the lack in quality especially when you're paying a lot for the shoes.
2.0,It looks cheap and not a great fit.
2.0,The shirts are just not long enough. I am about 6’1” 235 lbs and the XXL was just above my belt line. The width of the shirt and quality check out but I’d be weary of ordering these if you are taller or have a long torso.<br /><br />Bring out some XLT and XXLT (tall) sizes and I think they would be a great buy for the price.
2.0,"I bought these to replace the laces that fell apart in my hiking boots. Once i got them I thought they are exactly the same. after wearing them for a few months they ARE exactly the same.<br /><br />Around the hole the laces run through they are starting to fray and fall apart just like the last ones did. Thank fully it was two pair so i don't have to buy another set.<br /><br />They lasted for a bit but unlike other laces they will eventually fail. If you need them to only last for a little bit go for them, other wise stay away."
2.0,Pretty colors but they don’t stay up.
2.0,It fit okay for my LG Stylo
2.0,Seems more like a pajama top than a tshirt.
2.0,"The hat us not warm enough..at first i was happy with the ser, until the first tume i walked outside"
2.0,I ordered a 2XL & it was way too small.<br />Disappointed
2.0,This jumper is super cute and comfy. But I'm 5'10 and 260 lbs and is not quite the length I wanted it and a little too snug. I ordered xxl
2.0,"The gloves work as described... but they arrived with a hole (about as large as a finger tip) between 2 knuckles.  Super lame.  I'll sew it up... but its discouraging.  Like everyone else is saying, there are quality issues with this product.  But I'm sure I'll be satisfied once I've repaired it."
2.0,smaller than I anticipated. my glasses are normal sized and just barely fit in this case. I have to set them in the case just right or it won't close. I'd go with a larger case next time.
2.0,the fit is small even when opened all the way out..ive ordered this hat before and the fit was fine..i did a reorder and the 1 i got does not fit anyway near as good as the previous..not good..im gonna order somewhere else..
2.0,It looks way better in the picture . The strips on that one side make you look HUGE .
2.0,"I'm short and this comes down to about mid knee on me. It is higher on the sides than the front and back. I bought it for catering with my mom on hot summer days, so it does the job."
2.0,too tight on arms only
2.0,Worked but not great fit
2.0,"2nd time, clasp on band would not stay closed, returned it again"
2.0,The pj's are adorable but the sizing was way to small.  The shorts were more like an XXS and looked they would fit a 10 year old.  The shirt was short but wide.  The material was super soft and cute design but sizing was horrible.
2.0,it is quite long and just not the quality I expected
2.0,Didn't come close to fitting. Runs very small
2.0,"Been looking for a simple/basic pull on closure leotard/bodysuit, with 3/4 sleeves, and NO build on bra or  lining....this particulate one was ALMOST perfect..except, it has a build on lining around the chest, the back is too low it shows the bra straps, and the wideness of strap on top of the showers is too narrow, it feels like it would slide off, it makes you squeeze your solders up to keep it in place... very uncomfortable...price doesn't equal value.... I returned it immediately... still searching for a simple/basic soft material pull on closure leotard/bodysuit, with 3/4 sleeves, and NO build on bra or lining..."
2.0,I was super excited to buy this for my two daughters and myself. On arrival one of the small hearts was already broke off the necklace. My husband was able to reattach. The girls loved it but because of the cheap chain we don’t wear them. I should of spent more money for better quality. It was a last minute stocking stuffer.
2.0,My son only wore this once before threads and snags started popping out all over the place….And it was very small. Cute! But only a one time wear before it gets ruined and won’t fit anymore
2.0,"The typo of met vs meet was not noticed at first when purchased,  however still funny and an ongoing joke between my boyfriend and I! Please before selling another though, change meet to met!"
2.0,"Product is made very cheap, never buy another pair of these glasses, that's the bad thing buying from the web, you don't get to see them until they arrive in the mail."
2.0,"Not a comfortable material and seems to run small.  Material is much thinner than expected.  I am 5'4 and it is much shorter on me than anticipated.  The ""waist"" falls just below my bust (the picture is very deceiving)."
2.0,"Have it 2 stars purse was great, but it did not come with the wallet like advertised. Very upset on that part since this was a gift to my mom."
2.0,"The fit was awkward/large.  I am normally a small (pushing medium) and bought a small.  It's basically like a columbia jacket or a hoodie, but with a bizarre shape that sort of resembles a pea coat.  I bought it because I wanted a comfy/casual pea coat, but this was definitely not the solution.  Returned it."
2.0,These earrings are hideous. I guess you get what you pay for. They are so huge! And GOLD! I guess if I am ever a gypsy for Halloween I can use these!
2.0,Color faded from brass to purple in about a month.
2.0,Fits like a mans tee and print is way too large. Wish I had sizes down. Now it’s just a sleep shirt as it’s not flattering at all
2.0,"It'a just a very thin, silker t-shirt materal and, to me, nothing like the picture. The 2 times I've worn it, people thought I was wearing a bandana. Probably better for someone with thin, little hair."
2.0,"I wanted a pair of aviators to wear.  These arrived fast, but boy are they big.  If you like really big glasses, these are for you.  Not the original kind I was looking for.  :("
2.0,Too tight!  It's impossible to breathe!
2.0,I thought these would be of better quality.  The black ink comes off on the sole of the bootie.  Nice design but I was expecting more.
2.0,"The waist fit very well because I chose the right waist size. But it doesn't tell you how short this swim suit is. I feel like I'm wearing short shorts. Don't buy this if you're over 6 feet tall, these are for people around 5'5."
2.0,Neckline sacks after one wash! Fabric is not comfortable!  Should have returned instead of avoiding the trouble.
2.0,This was one of the only gifts that my daughter asked for for her 14th birthday.  She loved it and wore it daily until it broke apart  when she was getting up from the couch less than 1 month after she received it. She was very upset but I can't justify spending the money to replace it.
2.0,The socks don’t really fit snugly on your feet- the elasticity is poor and threads start to come out pretty early on. Boo.
2.0,"Overall, the dress is really cute. There’s not a lot of reviews on the long sleeve option and that’s the dress I opted for. It runs big. Size down. I‘m 5’7” and I weigh 155 pounds. I ordered a medium and the dress’s waist actually measures 30.5 inches, not 28 inches like the description states. This extra material just sagged around my waist and gave me an overall box shape which is not a good look for me personally. Also, there is definitely some stretch to the bottom portion of the dress. Even the sequin portion of the dress that meets the chiffon top stretches. The top portion has no stretch, obviously, because it is chiffon. I just wanted to point that out because the description says “no stretch.”<br /><br />Sizing aside, there is a line of missing sequins on the dress I received. It wouldn’t be so bad except the missing sequins are in a straight line down the front of the dress. It’s really distracting and very noticeable when I have the dress on (the pictures are of the dress while laying flat on my bed). Additionally, there is a small hole where the bottom of the dress meets the top, which isn’t too noticeable. But, there was no tag on the dress and it already had deodorant stains on the inside when I opened the package which bothers me. Hopefully a replacement dress, in a smaller size, will be unused, free of holes, and not missing any sequins because this is a really cute dress."
2.0,Button popped off like everyone  else's  😐
2.0,"Wife is 150lbs, 5'5"", size 8.<br /><br />The cut of this dress is just completely wrong and hangs off of your chest as there is no tapering to bring it back towards your body.<br /><br />It has to be worn with a belt to be presentable as it otherwise looks and feels like a potato sack.<br /><br />Two stars only for the fabric which does indeed feel like cotton/linen despite being a poly."
2.0,"This is runs really big. I'm 5'8"" and 127 pounds a medium was huge. Also the collar and bottom white part are too big."
2.0,"I'm 5'6&#34;, 145 pounds, ordered size Medium and the fit was off. The loops for the arms were pulling across the chest and not sitting well over the shoulders. If I pulled the back up higher then in looked like a robe in the front, if I left the back low as intended, the front was not fitting nicely. I didn't feel like experimenting with the sizes and ordering another one, so returning it. Other than that, the fabric is soft and heavy, which makes it cling in all the right places, and color vibrant."
2.0,Case is ok. Screen protector came cracked. I would not recommend this product.
2.0,"It's ok. It's not engraved more like stamped. I am disappointed the stamp is orange and the letters are not evenly colored. The cuff links look nice but the &#34;engraving&#34; looks cheap even at this low price point I expected the picture.  It took about 3 weeks to get to me.  Too much trouble to return, I don't recommend this company."
2.0,The glue in the clasp came apart the first couple hours I wore it.
2.0,It broke as soon as I put it on my phone
2.0,This necklace was cheap and cheesy looking.  Not at all what I expected.
2.0,"The idea is great, but they are extremely small.<br />Placing them on your glasses is ok, but they don't mention that you have to measure the distance between your eyes and the height their supposed to go at...<br />Curvature is not even so they tend to make your head hurt.<br />Sorry, not what I expected."
2.0,Sizing for these hoodies is definitely not the same as the shirts. Runs extremely small.
2.0,Ultra cheap material and very low quality lens. The picture looks a lot better than the actual product.
2.0,Certainly NOT worth the money. Very thin and cheaply made. Find something of better quality for the same price.
2.0,Super cute but way way too small. No stretch at all. The return policy is too difficult for me to do so I just gave this to a friend. Bummed it didn't work for me. The little note that came with the bra was adorable though. 😊
2.0,"Too large and very boxy, not flattering for petite figures."
2.0,"These are larger than normal shades.....you trade that problem for them constantly slipping down your nose, in less than a hour i gave them to my brother, who after ten minutes gave them to my dad, they will forever hang in his truck now unused unless nothing else is available,  I cannot recommend buying these."
2.0,These glasses were very poorly made. They broke halfway through my son's school performance. They were too small and continued to fall off. This may be why both ear stems broke off. I would not recommend these.
2.0,Pretty back.  Ugly front. The breast pads are also of low quality and move around a lot.
2.0,"I found these pineapple pajamas to be very cute in intended idea, however the fit (typical of Asian merchandise) is not proportional.  The  material is a polyester type knit stretchy overall but that made the top too loose in the chest area and the bottom way too small in the waist.  The waist stretches a lot, but I feel would be uncomfortable to sleep in if worn longer plus the material is sort of heat retaining vs comfy cotton.  I'm normally a size 6/8 and bought the XXL. I'm going to keep it because the set was so cheap but not sure if I'll wear the 10""  but stretchable waist shorts..."
2.0,I wish companies would get their plus size clothing right.  So disappointing that this runs a full size small.
2.0,"Yeah, these things suck. Flat out, suck.<br />They are really thin, not water repellant OR absorbent, like how does that even happen?<br />Anyway, the straps just tore after tying them a couple times.<br />Better off getting 5 nicer, real cotton/poly blend than cheap out on a dozen that will only fill a trash bag.<br />2 star because I'm feeling nice."
2.0,"Weird fit, weird material"
2.0,It’s pretty but the angel came off as soon as I took it out the bag
2.0,"The description says it came in a velvet bag....it did not. The picture shows what I received as my order. The keychain is cute, dont get me wrong....but not $15.00 cute. It would of been nice, and at least somewhat worth the money, if it was a better quality keychain."
2.0,Not that bright and the LEDS aren’t continuous from belt to shoulder. Very disappointed.
2.0,This sounded like a bargain for $21 and a quick solution to my upcoming trip. I was disappointed. Two of the zippers on two of the packs had torn away from the fabric before I even left home.
2.0,I purchased these because I'm no larger then a child.
2.0,But didn't wash well. Got the little balls after one wash. More like tight material than stretch pants on outside. Inside is fuzzy.
2.0,Much smaller than anticipated. Very short in the torso
2.0,"The lens seems to be delaminating in one corner. The actual sun glasses are beautiful, shame that after only taking it in the water a hand full of times it already shows signs of delamination."
2.0,"Smaller than I expected, but perfect that way! This is my first pocket sized wallet and let me just say I will never go back to full sized ones! I love how this keeps my trash low as I can’t have too many unnecessary cards. The is slot sticks sometimes if you have other cards behind it, but other than that it’s awesome!<br />Edit: very sticky residue inside that ruins cards. I threw it out after a month of use"
2.0,"sizes run big, would be nicer if pocket was lower."
2.0,didn't like it fitted me too high waisted
2.0,runs small. which I could deal with but the material is so thin its not appropriate for more than a swimsuit cover....
2.0,"I measured my head, 7-3/8. I ordered 2 welding caps and one fit tighter than the other. I used one and washed it. Now it feels like a seven. So tight I am unable to put it on. I have not used the second."
2.0,"I ordered the XXL, which is usually what I order (sometimes XL).  I could not even get the dress over my head and shoulders to try it on.  I was extremely small for a XXL.  I liked the design and style and was VERY disappointed when I could not even try it on and no larger size to try."
2.0,very cheaply made if you open it to hard it will break
2.0,Product did not come with a USB cable and will not hold a charge. I have tried multiple micro USB chargers and the light turns red then off. I’m very disappointed that I have gotten about 3 total hours of use out of this product because of the charging issue.
2.0,Not as stretchy as I thought.
2.0,"I wanted to like this dress so badly but wow, there is not a single thing you can hide when you put this on. You also cannot really wear a blouse underneath it as it shows right through. If you have a perfect figure or will be putting something on like a jacket over it, go for it, otherwise this dress may make you feel very insecure, it sure did to me lol."
2.0,"The shoes are light, bright and colorful, however they came smashed! My son is unable to wear them."
2.0,"Although these keep my hands warm, the quality is not great.  They are already starting to fall apart and I have only worn them a few times.  However, they do keep my hands warm."
2.0,"Recently had a reduction to 36D.  The 38c fit better, but didn't offer as much support as I expected and absolutely no shape. Little side support too. Returning."
2.0,Huge nerd looking glasses
2.0,"I purchased this for my son, he is a normal size baby. At not even 2 months old the hats do NOT fit. He's only in the 20th percentile.. Definitely will not fit until 6 months so consider that before purchasing. Wish I had known! Waste of money, he only got to wear these once or twice."
2.0,"Product Rating: Ankle/heel strap is too wide--it digs into side ankle.  I had to scissor-trim the strap, all the way around, by 1/4&#34;.  Trimmed buckle,too.  Size 6 runs large."
2.0,"These are a great idea but they didn't even make it through a full work day before they were rolling and sliding down my leg.  I tried a size that was recommended and a size smaller, same issue."
2.0,Pero Queda perfecto talla L
2.0,Are you effing kidding me? This was recommended<br />By a friend who is a therapist to help me change my habits and get me out of bed really. As you can imagine I was so excited to get this item. And when I open the package what I got was a rusty looking double D battery. I’m going to try it out but it’s definitely going back.<br /> $160.00
2.0,"I will typically get a 3xl so my hoodies are roomy, that being said this one fit at least a size smaller and was very snug. I usually wear a 2x and they are roomy if that helps"
2.0,"The material feels a little cheap. I ordered an XL as I have for all other swimsuits on Amazon and they all fit perfectly, but I couldn't even get these bottoms over my thighs. Almost felt like it was a child's XL!"
2.0,"I purchased the same tank and loved it so much I ordered another one in a different color. This one is significantly smaller than the first one, even though it is labeled the same size. Really disappointing."
2.0,"My wife loved them, but the same day she wore them --she lost one because the clip is too flimsy."
2.0,Cute accessory but turned 3wks later after purchasing it.
2.0,Yellow/orange in color and definitely not the same stain color as picture shown (I ordered “Brown A”). The wood is also splintering where the hook is connected after only 2 days of use. Pretty disappointed and the product is obviously cheaply made.
2.0,"I’m a breastfeeding mama and hoped this dress would be perfect for nursing this summer. Although the buttons are great, it’s very short and wide. Not good for taller gals with long legs like myself."
2.0,"lightweight & worked for our Florida trip..the 1st time i wore it and there was a hole in the pocket...i realize i didn't pay much for, but was really hoping the quality would of been a little better. i'll fix it & it will work for what i need"
2.0,It’s a cute swim cover up but wish the quality could be better. The inside of the cover up had a lot of thread on it that took a long time to cut Them off or picked Them out. Inner seams were rough. Should have been a better quality with the price. Swim cover at Target and Walmart is prob half the price or less with better quality.
2.0,Cheaply made. Too light weight feels like cartoon. Wouldn't recommand it
2.0,Wore it to a wedding and by the end of the night under my armpits were ripped because the sequence would rub against each other strings were coming out so annoying
2.0,"Love the lace, it is very pretty. But the arms are way too long for me and the length is also way too long. Plus the him is unraveling. Also about 4 inches of the dress does not have a slip to it.<br />Plan on sending back."
2.0,I got these on the weekend and their very pretty<br />But i noticed on hoop had stones missing and the thing that goes thru your ear is bend😢
2.0,The print is not pretty in person
2.0,"I usually wear US S and M.<br />I had a feeling that this has a Chinese measurement(due to past experiences with other sellers). So, I ordered the Large first.<br />Turned out to be actual US Large. Was too big for me.<br /><br />I really liked the material(stretchy). So I returned the same and ordered for US S.<br /><br />As the title says Slim Fit, it actually isn't that Slim fit.<br />I have a fairly athletic body. All the US S t shirts fit pretty well on my body, but sadly this one didn't.<br />It was a bit loose at the shoulders, chest.<br />Also, after wearing it, the button placket really looked odd. Felt like it goes much down, than required(or expected).<br /><br />A small note about the seller(Cindy Shea Collection):<br />They are awesome. They were very courteous when I contacted them. 5 star for the seller."
2.0,not at all the photo do not recommend at all
2.0,Go up a size for a more professional look. The skirt rode up as I walked. The color is nice but is darker than the picture.
2.0,"This shirt fit fine, just wasn't what I expected. Wasn't flattering on me. I gave this shirt to my mom, and she seems to like it."
2.0,"Doesn,t work as it was demo"
2.0,"Although in theory these are a great idea, I had 2 major issues with them. First, the seams of some of these came apart in the first wash. Second, and more importantly, I have a reaction to the rubber on the inside of the socks. They make my skin break out in an itchy rash. Sensitive skin beware."
2.0,"I know the price is modest, but product is rough and brassy in appearance. I should have returned ito as I do not wear it."
2.0,Has some sort of hard plastic/vinyl sticking out of the back seam at the top. Hurts to wear. Tried to pull it out with tweezers and then cut it off with scissors. Very uncomfortable.<br />Also much more shiny than the long leggings I previously bought.<br />Did they change the material or manufacturer?
2.0,Very cheap and cheesy does not look like picture far from it
2.0,"Received 12 Marijuana related charms and 11 zodiac symbols. None of which were in the pictures. Other pictured charms were barely represented in lot. I wasn't expecting it to be exactly as pictured, but my 6 year old daughter was sincerely disappointed. I have ordered other shoe charms on several occasions and they were definitely better than this."
2.0,"Box was damaged, probably cause boots were sent in one of those flat plastic bags. Returned boots (not because of damaged box) as one had seemed to been worn. It was a bit weird, one boot looked like someone etried it on and walked around (or was factory imperfection) ."
2.0,"The style was nice, but the lining of the dress is a see-thru mesh. Felt cheap for spending roughly $50. I returned for this reason."
2.0,I didn’t use it it don’t look like the picture and the material is terrible
2.0,The fit on these is less then perfect. The Velcro strap isn’t tight enough. The quality isn’t the best. Worth the price I suppose.
2.0,I had to adjust it but over all it was pretty cute
2.0,Comes in One size and I'm a medium.  It was too small so had to return it.
2.0,"I really liked this dress and my husband liked the way it looked on me too. Unfortunately, I only had it on for about five minutes because the seam on the side of the dress ripped! I don't even know how it could have ripped considering the dress fit loose on me. I'm guessing it was due to poor stitching? I was really disappointed since I planned on wearing the dress to an event and ended up having to change into another dress. It's too bad because it's a pretty dress that can easily be worn from day to night."
2.0,These tapers have knicks in the top which was VERY uncomfortable for my girlfriend. Great to stretch with if they didn't have this problem
2.0,I got the size 13. I can barely get them on. They are too small and tight.
2.0,My wife liked the gray color a lot but it was way too big. She sized up based on reviews. She also got the Navy one and that one fit perfectly. If getting the gray size down. She's 5'11 150lbs. The length was perfect.
2.0,cheap material. will not be wearing.
2.0,Go in with low expectation and it's fine. I was looking for something to go with a costume but ultimately thought it felt and looked cheap. The curve of the visor is too curved and it sits high on your head in front. I returned this item.
2.0,"Very small, great for a child not for a adult"
2.0,Very cute but waaaayyyy too short. I'm 5'7 and the skirt cam just about mid-shin. I so wish you would make these for tall women!!
2.0,"Very thin material, felt flimsy. Fit was terrible too and not at all like how it falls on the model (I get that I'm not shaped like the model but it was abysmal).<br />Went back to Bezos for now."
2.0,"Looks ok from afar, up close the fake leather is painfully obvious. I tore a small hole by accident in it when I was removing the sticker from the bill. For the price, and from afar, it looks fine. May post more after I've worn it a few days."
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress, but the chest kept twisting around so it was noticeably lopsided. The fabric and shape were nice, but it was impossible to wear. Even when I wore a sweater over it, it would twist so much that one side of the bodice would show over the edge of the sweater. Maybe mine was just constructed poorly? Total waste of money, but I had already washed it and couldn't return it. Ended up donating it to Goodwill where some other poor sucker will buy it and resent it."
2.0,"I was excited to find these purses because the description on the amazon site said, &#34;Hedgehog&#34; and made of vegan leather.  The bags seemed to be a perfect crossbody size and looked cute.  Unfortunately there are no hedgehogs on this bag, just owls.  While the size is still nice, the color of the vegan leather trim just makes the bag look cheap.  I think a different color would work better.  The bag is inexpensive so i probably should have guessed that it would turn out not to be a great as it looked but the picture really is much better than the real thing.  I will return this and hope that someone who likes lavendar and owls will one day enjoy it!"
2.0,"So uncomfortable. They arrived quickly, but I won't wear them, I donated them :("
2.0,My daughters was true to size but my bottoms fit however the top was too small. They should let you pick a size for the top separate from the bottom.
2.0,"Zipper is the heaviest item on the robe. Also, more that $6 to return to seller."
2.0,"Super cute in the picture, but when I received this top it had a very unpleasant smell to it.. Comparable to a strong burnt plastic like odor. I washed it twice, but i could still smell it faintly. It made my arms itch due to the material. The lace had loose ends which I trimmed. Overall, poor quality, but you get what you pay for."
2.0,Poor product!
2.0,"I thought I was getting 4 pairs of socks, however this was just two pair. That's fine, but I was sent 3 rights and 1 left. Fortunately, the socks don't seem to actually make a difference on sides, so I'm keeping them. They are a warm compression feel that I will use in colder temperatures."
2.0,"The front chest aplique was crudely cut fabric and sewn on without attention to fraying, which was an immediate deal breaker for the $25.99 I paid.  It's not like they didn't know how to sew this on properly, as the bottom hems were sewn correctly.  Headed to Puy du Fou in France this summer and this garment is definitely not up to snuff."
2.0,For some reason I was thinking this item secured from the back. It does NOT....it is a pullover and runs small. Not a comfortable fit at all for large busted women
2.0,The print quality is no where near as good as it is in the picture.  Its rather dull and the images are a bit hard to make out.  Colors aren't as vibrant either.  It also is rather short for the fit too.
2.0,"Great but WAY too small. I am a medium, but this fits like extra small. Will have to donate it 😕"
2.0,"These are very, very small.  If you're looking for bling or to be noticed, these are not for you.  I reordered larger earring to replace these."
2.0,Produce description states for men shoe sizes up to 14 - but this does not stretch my shoes size 12.5 and 13. I had to return them. But the product does seem to be of good quality.
2.0,"It was a beautiful pendant, but the clip holding it broke on the first day."
2.0,Bottoms show almost everything on front and back. Way too small. Top was perfect though
2.0,"This is meant to be a passport holder you can wear around your neck with the attached strap.<br /><br />What I like about it:<br />It's lightweight and has several useful pockets you can use for your passport, other identification, money, traveler's checks, receipts, etc. It's light enough you could wear it around your neck and under your shirt or jacket for safety and it's weight won't add too much to the weight of the items you want to carry.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />It's pretty cheaply made and if someone did grab it from around your neck the cheap plastic latches and the light webbing of the strap would probably break. The zipper is cheap as well and comes apart with the least bit of a tug, so when you're actually PUTTING your passport into it the zipper pulls apart and your money and passport/ID are no longer secure.<br /><br />I would be worried that if I actually took this to a foreign country (which was the intent of ordering it) the zipper would end up separating and my ID and credit card would just fall out, no one would NEED to steal them. I would send it back for a sturdier product if I could."
2.0,I love the look of these pants and they fit great but after wearing once the seams starting coming apart and they pilled in the thigh area. Way too expensive for the quality.
2.0,This dress was ok. Shorter than expected😟
2.0,"I wore these once. I received many compliments, but the rhinestones have fallen off. Additionally, they stuck together where my 2 thighs touched ended up tearing large holes. So you can only expect to wear once"
2.0,"I really liked this bag when I first got it 6 months ago. It’s a bit annoying that the center zipper part sinks down in the bag. However, the straps started peeling a couple of weeks ago. The edge of the straps completely peeled off and now the straps are very rough on the edges and cut into my arm when I carry it. Very disappointing!"
2.0,The nose pieces were very uneven.
2.0,Not true to size and very cheap quality.
2.0,"Not my style , too small , fabric is rough"
2.0,Gives a smooth silhouette
2.0,Returned...too bulky and large
2.0,"Shoes came in timely fashion, however, one shoe didn’t work and wouldn’t charge."
2.0,I was so excited to receive this dress and was super bummed. It runs large & just very cheap in my opinion.
2.0,I do not like sweaters that fit loose at your wrists..  I prefer tighter  its wide in middle but is narrower on bottom<br />It just did not look good enough for me to keep<br /><br />love the pattern
2.0,Great design but changes color really quick
2.0,The design of this sweater is super cute and it looked great on but the texture was awful!  It was unbelievably scratchy and I had to remove it immediately. Unless you wear something under to prevent it from touching your skin I wouldn’t get this.
2.0,They fit well but I've owned these less than two months and the stitching on the velcro has failed on both shoes
2.0,Writing wasn't centered on the necklace. It was cheap so I didn't expect perfection but....
2.0,Cute sweater. Arrived with a giant hole in the sleeve.
2.0,Great fit but you can see straight through it.
2.0,size was way too small.  Ordered an xl and it must have been a medium.  Returned and got credit.  Thank you.
2.0,These don't fit like other high waisted bottoms I have purchased. They are too Granny-Panty-ish
2.0,Socks slip off your feet and do not keep your feet warm. We were in Breckenridge and my daughters feet were soooo cold.
2.0,For $10 I’d rather it be a little bit more bigger but over all it’s effective
2.0,"Got size Large since I am tall and wide in the chest. Bra was a bit too big (im a 38C) and the pants were too short and definitely not squat propf. Material was a weird combination of spandex and something shiney. It was a cheap set, for the price it's good, but if youre looking for functionality try something else."
2.0,It’s beautiful but it does not lay flat. Usually only shows the gold rather than the rhinestones. Ugh.
2.0,Bought this on November 2nd. Started ripping within two weeks. It’s unfortunate because I really liked it too.
2.0,Chain clasp weak and broke in 2 days
2.0,"The color on this was much less reddish brown, but a boring dull brown that didn't pop at all like the picture.  Also, while they appeared to be the right size, fit-wise, when I walked, the heel slipped down with each step, and I couldn't stand that, so they went back."
2.0,Very pretty but made way two small like 2 to 3 sizes to small.
2.0,I liked the design and fit of the mask but it was not quality made. The mouth filter piece fell out three days after wearing. I was not a happy camper. Not sure if you can order replacement parts but who really wants to when these are a necessity. My other one is hanging on so now I must order me another one.
2.0,I've moved the monitor closer and still the computer is blurry.  They are fine for reading a book but not the computer.
2.0,"Runs VERY small. And very poorly made. I am a 34C/32D and I ordered a large, the cups were a quarter of the size they should've been. And on top of that, the cups were two COMPLETELY different sizes. One side almost fit, but the other side was made for an A cup. Very disappointed."
2.0,"Spend few dollars more and get better quality gloves.<br />They are very flimsy and Cheaply made.<br />Also padding seems to be at wrong place, bicycle grip is different.<br />They  are not expensive that's the only upside."
2.0,"Actually runs two sizes too small, quilt sheds (inside lining) bad, no plushness, and provides no warmth. Able to tell why this jacket cost is cheap--made for cheaper."
2.0,"The material was cheap and thin, it wasn't what I expected"
2.0,It looks cheap and I'm not impressed with it at all
2.0,I bought these cause I thought the price was decent & I've always wanted a pair of tights like these. Well I got the tights & after opening the package I realized that there were already multiple holes in them. I wish they weren't damaged when I got them. Also the image on the tights looks different from the photos.
2.0,These glasses are looses & continue to slide down off the face. The stones also rusted after one day of wearing these shades.
2.0,"These hats actually fit somewhat tight, not slouch to them at all, not much different than a regular knit cap, the colors were nice, but was hoping for a much looser fit"
2.0,It nice .
2.0,the bracelet snapped after 10 days of taking it out of the package.
2.0,I did not realize masks with valves are not approved by the CDC. Learned after a co-worker informed me. It also says in the description that there are 3 filters included. I only received masks.
2.0,Larger than I expected. Nice for a little thought. On the flimsy side
2.0,"The bodice was not portionate with the waist size. I am a 36D, size 10/12. The breast area was slugger and the waist was too tight. Then the cap sleeves were huge and didn’t even stay on my shoulders, the whole thing would have fallen down if the waist area had not been so tight."
2.0,I was sorely disappointed with this item. It is so so cute but I washed the overalls before putting them on my daughter and they shrunk so much they were unwearable (at least three inches too short). I donated them to Goodwill without ever being able to use them. Super bummed. I was able to keep the shirt though.<br />FYI my daughter was 23 m/o and 31 inches tall when I purchased these.
2.0,"Super cute sweatshirt, however it shrinks. I followed the sizes guide and it fit out of the package, but after one wash it shank up. Now the arms and bodice are way too short, and it no longer has the lose fit as advertised. The material is also very stiff. It’s a cute look but buy a size or two up knowing it will shrink. I will be returning."
2.0,"He company was very nice, did refund and all, no hassle, but the skirt is not satin, it is polyester, a fake satin.... it fits nothing like the picture,  its not a mermaid skirt, oh and it has a train, which the picture doesn't show...  had waited and anticipated this delivery and was so sad when it came in and I saw it..."
2.0,Super small cut. Doesn't hold very much.
2.0,I returned this item because it had a weird smell and when I tried it on the material was so itchy and it runs small.
2.0,"This bracelet is nice but it did not come with the allergies etched on it, nor did they get in touch with me to tell me how I could have that done."
2.0,They looked as shown but appeared much smaller than the size ordered.
2.0,"As a shoe horn, it works fine. The issue I have with it is quality control.  It arrived with the leather loop that attaches to the key ring detached because it was not properly riveted. I read another review that said the key ring came off after the second time used.  What a world, what a world."
2.0,"Fit was good, holes started appearing by second wash."
2.0,"Gorgeous dress, although go a size up if you have a bigger chest. My only complaint was that there was a manufacturing defect that left a huge bunch of lace sticking out over one breast"
2.0,Toe is made very cheaply and sticks out when being worn.  Not at all as described as a comfort fit.
2.0,"I’m giving 2 starts because the material feels okay, but it’s just way too small and not at all true to size. I ordered a L when I usually wear S/M and it was still tight everywhere. These are supposed to be compressing tops but this one was honestly uncomfortable. I had gotten L in 2 other tops like these from a different carrier and they fit perfectly around my chest with some looseness around the waist. I really wanted a top like this in white so I was disappointed in this one. The pads were also really noticeable, but that may have been because it’s too tight."
2.0,"As others have experienced, this came with 13 of the pearls loose, having to glue them back into place.."
2.0,Just ok. Digs into my arm no matter what the adjustment.  Hasn't broken though
2.0,Very loose fitting and feels cheap in the hand unfortunately.
2.0,The trouser fit is tight at the knees and rubs against the skin.
2.0,"This shirt is harder to maintain than anticipated.  Not only does it require ironing, but it does not respond well to steam alone.  I would not have purchased it had I known of the time/effort connected with its maintenance."
2.0,it was good at first but after a few uses i can see that the gold is tarnishing.
2.0,"Besides being smelly, the sweater is VERY see through and requires a tank underneath!!  Not anywhere near worth $30.<br /> HOW does this item rate all the good reviews??  I'm returning ASAP!!"
2.0,The hoop was all twisted up and it wouldn't lay properly under the garment for which it was purchased.
2.0,"Cute fit, love the support at chest. BUT only the front middle is lined. The rest of the suit is see through."
2.0,"Material is VERY cheap!! When I received the clothes, it had a lot of imperfections and wears on it. It made my skin very itchy and uncomfortable, and I could not have it! I bought two, I am very disappointed with it ! clothes not the same as the-model ！Not worth it."
2.0,I ordered in two different sizes.  The skirt fit tighter than I like in the smaller size and the next size up was too big.
2.0,The set was very adorable upon opening but once I put it on my baby & tried to capture pictures I then realized how poorly made it was. The string from the headband began unraveling as well as her top so needless to say me capturing a baby mermaid didn't workout.
2.0,This item has excellent quality and excellent styling. The problem is that the sizing is made for anyone who's on the very very slight side or maybe even skinny not for athletic builds or anyone who even moderately works out the arm size<br /> is quite small I am a average build size and weight at 5 9 and 1/2 and 160 lb and the sleeves sizing is way too small fits my girlfriend perfectly five four 100 lb
2.0,"Sizing is off. I bought a size 3 and it is more like a two. Also received wrong color, and there’s a funky chemical smell"
2.0,The appearance of the print is as described but a thin and light t-shirt for a premium price ... I don't think it'll hold up well to wash and wear ... I do not recommend it
2.0,"These were much smaller than I anticipated.  I guess I need something that shows me how big mm are.  Also, they were a gift and my nephew says he can't get one of them open"
2.0,I got a large to fit my DD chest and the top was too big but the bottoms were too small. I ended up returning it.
2.0,Did not fit my tennis shoe. Strap was too long.<br />Sorry
2.0,"Disappointed as the sweater runs very small.  I usually wear a L or XL, however, 1x might be tight on me in this sweater. Otherwise, it is a decent garment. I didn’t want the hassle of returning it and will probably give it to charity."
2.0,"Cute, but a really TERRIBLE SMELL! I’ve washed this 5 times now and it still smells like fish and plastic."
2.0,Price is too much this is just patch
2.0,"I order 1 size up, and it is too tight.  Def runs smaller than advertised."
2.0,They were just uncomfortable
2.0,Broke after a month under one Len. Quality is bad. Lends scratched week one in both sides when I did not scratch them. DONOT buy
2.0,"My daughters loved them for the first two weeks, but now only one shoe lights up. Very disappointed in these shoes."
2.0,The product was dirty on rim of bib didn’t seem to be brand new I use the bib to cover my clothes while eating
2.0,The bottles are nice however each one leaks put liquid from the nozzle.
2.0,Too small for the ring I purchased it for.  Not enough info in the ad. Would only work for a very thin ring.
2.0,To thin and only for small children.
2.0,"In the picture shows a beautiful ring, however when i received this ring i only received one part of it with a little damage :( . i didn't really mind the opening part because i'm in the process of losing weight. hopefully when they send it again i will receive both parts of the ring."
2.0,Ordered my size it fit snug. Didn't realize it had a hood. Just wasn't overly impressed.
2.0,"Very hard to put on round prescription glasses.  Cheaply made. Actually, look like the ones from the Optometrist's office. I am using them but would not buy them again!"
2.0,I can't use these laces  because it's impossible to pull them through the wholes of my shoes.
2.0,Really small size
2.0,It didn't fit the lugs for the huawei watch at all. The quick release pins were too long and the strap itself seemed too by at least 1mm or more.
2.0,"Disappointed that the trim started coming off as soon as my daughter wore it. This means the bottom of the dress will start snagging and will look awful after minimal wear which is a bummer because she wears her princess dresses as soon as she wakes up until she has to put real clothes on to leave the house or pj’s to go to bed. Also the gold trim on top is kinda funky and folds over. Other than these complaints it’s a pretty dress and my daughter doesn’t mind, but since I spent the money, I do."
2.0,"Opened the box only to see a tangled mess. It took over 30 minutes, patience and a toothpick to untangle. I like how delicate it is and looks but total headache"
2.0,"It fits oddly.  Runs a little larger than expected.  Waist would work, but the skirt gets wide near the bottom.  Not nice looking at all."
2.0,Too small. I bought a 2x n it looks like a 14. Beautiful skirt but sixed wrong.
2.0,"Cute concept and one side of the skirt was cute, but the side that touched the bag came rubbed and looks very ruffled, not sleek like the other side. It’s also very short. I bought for my super short preteen daughter, but it is too short— like a total length of about 12 inches…we didn’t even try on as it was too small to go over her hips (normally wears kids size 14), but it holding it up it barely covered her butt. It was super soft though."
2.0,Something was really odd with this dress. I ordered my size and it zipped up fine but the waist was so small that it was like a corset and then the dress was so flouncy it made it look like a maternity dress!!! Also the bust pockets are sized so if yours are too big or too small then this isn't going to be a good fit.  The material and pattern was lovely. If you have the correct proportions for this dress you will be ok. I am getting the feeling that many of the dresses on here are made for small people and the larger sizes just don't seem to translate properly. Anyway I usually order L or XL and they just don't seem to be right. Don't have this issue usually.
2.0,"I didn't try it on or open it as the raspberry heathered pink I expected is a deep dull maroon wine color and yes, it's labeled correctly. The image shown here has a lightened altered color."
2.0,They were small thin and the elastic seems week
2.0,"picture of this product was slightly miss leading as i thought the lighter sections were tan and not white, there is also no green in it. after closer review of the description where it says &#34;snow&#34; I blame myself. i planned on using for hunting but looks like it will be tossed into the &#34;extras&#34; box in the hunting room. Took longer than expected to receive and there was no packing slip to send back for an exchange? guess you get what you pay for..."
2.0,It was slightly smaller than I expected but the problem was the material. It was a heavyweight stretchy polyester that doesn't breath. I live in Hawaii and this shirt is far to warm.
2.0,There was supposed to be 5 masks and I only got 4
2.0,Cheap and doesn’t hold the shape at all
2.0,Ordered this in medium bc that’s usually my size and that was GIANT. So I ordered another in small and it was still too big. It is also really long.
2.0,"I bought these for my husband at the end of June 2020 and he loved them! So much so he bought 3 more pairs in August. However, in Sept after wearing them in the rain twice, the 1st pair starting coming apart at the soles. He fixed them and hasn't worn them in the rain again until yesterday. He came home with his feet cold and soaked! All of this to say, they're NOT water resistant."
2.0,"Runs very small in the bust.  I am 5'10&#34; and typically wear a size 10 (medium or large).  The large and XL was so small around bust.  Ended up having to order an XXL.  However, the XXL was huge.  There is a problem with the correct description for the sizing of these shirts."
2.0,ordered for a newborn way too big
2.0,"I got 50 of the same, just a slight color variation.  Seems like decent quality. Not as pictured."
2.0,I don't like the texture of it. It feels like a napkin and it was too big on me.
2.0,"Soooo the photo looks like silk, in person, it’s cheap print that stretches out when being worn. Also, I’m a size medium/large, and it’s so small, it barely closes. :("
2.0,"Ordered the grey in x-small (I'm 5'3&#34;, 124 lbs.). Definitely returning. I've had this item on my wishlist for a year or so & finally decided to see what it was like in-person. The fit was about what I expected, but the cut was different: really pouches out from the waist downwards, creating a rather frumpy, dowdy look in my opinion that isn't at all flattering--just looks likes LOADS of material and adds quite a few years to your age and quite a few pounds to your figure. I'm in my 20s but I still don't need that. Also, if you are petite like me, I feel the size of the floral pattern is too overwhelming. It might be ok on a very tall woman, but on me it added to the frumpy look. Overall, the dress was just way too much."
2.0,"It's fine, but it's very obviously cheaply made.  The vinyl straps on the side are too short to actually look like the product photos, and they're so thin and flimsy that I ended up just cutting them off.  The shoulder strap just kind of looks and feels like a cheap luggage strap.  I don't outright hate it, it's still a bag that will hold things, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it to someone and I probably won't use it except as a tote when I can't find one of my other totes."
2.0,"Fabric is kind of thin.  I didn't notice the dingleberries on the neck and sleeves in the pic, which was probably my fault.  I'm glad it wasn't expensive because it's going in the Goodwill pile."
2.0,These are not seamless. They are slightly thicker then a pair of pantyhose. See through.
2.0,"Something inside my bag leaked, and the liquid went through the lining to the leather exterior. The issue is that the leather dye isn't colorfast and proceeded to ruin $600 of belongings that came into contact with it.<br /><br />So disappointed as I'd expect a clutch would be capable of coming into contact with small amounts of liquid (rain, occasional spills) but the dye destroyed clothing, sheets and even a marble countertop with its bleeding black leather dye.<br /><br />Won't buy again."
2.0,"Runs small, zipper is crap."
2.0,"Shorts were larger than expected when they arrived but cotton, you know thought, would probably shrink. But no, with every wash they are larger & the fabric is approaching the texture of felt.<br />It's hot as well. They were fine in the fall but itchy & bunchy & hot now.<br /><br />Well sewn though."
2.0,This was way too small. I ordered a large. My daughter is generally a medium. Couldn’t even get the back zipped. There was also a hole in the fingers.
2.0,"This is  a pretty little ring but much too round to fit my fingers. Uncomfortable, I have skinny fingers. Returned it with no problem.  Love Amazon."
2.0,Just ok. Lots of glare on these lenses. Clarity is nice though.
2.0,Didn’t fit my head. Kept flopping down on my forehead.
2.0,I typically wear a 2X in tops and bottoms. I ordered this in a size 5XL because I assumed It would be to small and the 5XL barely fit. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Bust measurements are tight, not as they are on the measurements chart. Recommend ordering one size larger unless you like your tops very fitted. Also this is not a chiffon fabric, it is a stiff, shiny, polyester."
2.0,It did not come looking like the picture
2.0,Shirt is tight.  XL is a size or 2 sizes too small.
2.0,Toes still get cold.
2.0,Returned. Barely fit around my average size mans wrist.  I'm pretty sure it is a womans watch.  Probably a nice watch though
2.0,Looks cool but starts to tarnish and smell like costume jewelry relatively soon
2.0,Cheap materials- very plastic looking
2.0,Nice quality but too big
2.0,very thin material....has holes already
2.0,"First coat we got was way too small, so ordered a second coat that would allow for the size difference...Size was OK but the sleeves in the arms were still tight."
2.0,I'm returning the dress.  It is not loose and flowing like I was hoping on my fluffy figure.  It may ne great on the itty bitty bodies.  I need to find a brand with plus sizing.
2.0,Interesting fabric but however was much smaller than anticipated.
2.0,Because It's Not My Style.
2.0,They tend to roll down at the waist..
2.0,"Much smaller and lighter than expected, like the design, but for girls, not women."
2.0,"I loved the bracelet, but it’s strung together with a plastic line and it broke within a weeks time."
2.0,"I just put this wrap on for the first time and I could barely get my arms through the straps. Additionally, then length of this JUST covers my front and behind.  I'm 5'6"", so I'm not tall.  I would advise against this if you're the same height as me or taller."
2.0,"made of polyester. feels cheap and scratchy. I don’t understand why they can’t just use cotton. for the price point, I foolishly assumed I was getting real fabric. do not recommend"
2.0,"This may have started out as a beautiful product, but the packaging bent the posts and cuffs. I was able to straighten them for the most part, but I'm sure the structural integrity is compromised. Hopefully they will hold."
2.0,Smaller than anticipated even after lookin at the size guide. Haven’t worn it yet. It isn’t the most flattering. I do like the print though!
2.0,They were fine and my son liked the colors but we bought them as a face cover and honestly we will never use them. You can blow and the air goes right through the material like you aren’t even wearing one. It won’t work to provide any protection. But he may be able to use them in the winter to provide some warmth.
2.0,Fabric somewhat thin.  Returned
2.0,I found these earrings difficult to open and close. After tugging on one to remove it broke.<br />Don't recommend buying them.
2.0,"At the first I liked it because of style. I love skull & it's hard to find in stores. I was happy with the size either, but after I washed all the glitters on skull gone! Whole other clothes were glittery thank God dryer helped to remove most of them!"
2.0,Most definitely not worth how much we paid for it. Its maybe worth $8 and that's pushing it. It's pretty cheaply made and snapped within minutes of wear. It also doesn't have proper locket stile pocket for photo.
2.0,"This keychain is Awesome.  I use it for the key to my Jeep.  It's rubber and doesn't make noise bouncing around while driving.  Perfect.  Except, the little &#34;ear&#34; where the actual ring attaches broke off easily.  =(  Now I just stare at it and remember how awesome it used to be...."
2.0,"Although I do appreciate getting my rings on time, I regret to say that the now and heart were the only 2 rings that looked as it should the others were too small for my fingers (didn't ask for ring size) and the skull didn't look like a skull they weren't done like they are shown in the pic."
2.0,The sleeves on the picture go down almost to elbow. In reality it's short sleeved.
2.0,It was not black it was noir black so didn't like it I have darker colors than that sweater not recommended!!!!
2.0,too small cute tho
2.0,"Top is perfect, bottoms are entirely too small. I ordered a 2-3 and the bottoms barely fit my 6 month old without a diaper on."
2.0,"I purchased these earrings for my 12 year old granddaughter.  She has a shirt with tiny pineapples on it and I thought this would be a cute addition.  Well, you can hardly tell what it is on her ears.  It is just a stamped out mess.  Maybe worth $10.00 at most.  These earrings are very poorly made and look super cheap."
2.0,Sadly the sleeve color faded and is discolored. It is cute otherwise.
2.0,To heavy to wear in Florida !
2.0,"This compression sock is no more Easy-On Easy-Off than any other. And it is maybe a bit harder than many others. I cannot use it at all. I guess I will try to return it.<br />It seems like an okay compression sock. It does not state the compression rating. I was sucked in by the ""Easy-On Easy-Off"" part of the ad. After about 15 minutes of trying, but failing to get the sock on, I gave up. I have other compression socks that are ""hard"" to get on, but they are easier than this Copper Fit sock."
2.0,"They look nice and I really wanted to like them but they are very uncomfortable.<br />The straps over the feet feel like very cheap foam and do not seem durable.  Also the toe thong hurts, I don’t know if it’s the size or material of it but after a short walk I was pretty sure these will be binned."
2.0,"I LOVE the look of these earrings. I rated this piece with only two stars, however, because the posts that join the two sides together is really flimsy.  It's a struggle just put the pieces together and I feel nervous I might break them every time I push them together or pull them apart.  I want to keep them because they are such a unique piece, but I'm nervous they won't get much use before breaking!"
2.0,"Thought it was going to be more like a sweater. It's like a t-shirt. Also, runs extremely small. Not too happy."
2.0,Didn’t stick in my glasses returned
2.0,"item very heavy and slides to front of my neck all the time, and necklaces still tangle"
2.0,"Super bummed about these socks. I wear a size 10 shoe and have a hard time finding socks that fit well. Most socks are marked sizes 4-10 and are often snug. I was excited to see these were for ""plus"" size feet, fitting sizes 8-12 however they are no bigger than any regular women's socks I have purchased. I gave them to my daughter who is a size 8."
2.0,Its too small for adults made me feel like my nose was being held shut & I couldn't breathe.
2.0,"I didn’t care for this at all. It fit me well but didn’t seem as flattering, and I’m big chested. I’m 5’8, 145lbs, and a 36D. The fabric was very comfortable and the dress was easy to adjust the length. The ruching is always nice and more flattering on your figure so that’s a plus but the drawstring in the front is odd. The way it functions and the way it hangs. Looks better on the model. For a fifteen dollar dress, it’s not too bad. But overall I wouldn’t purchase this. Kinda looked more like a nighty than a dress."
2.0,Thin and cheap for the price.  Not the same brand as in the listing
2.0,Very LOW-QUALITY product!  Not made for daily use.  It is a good product for single-use or minimal-use for it's color or something like that.  It begins to crack and adjust its shape upon the FIRST use.  Not durable at all...doesn't seem like leather at all.  At least it is not a good QUALITY of leather.<br />Reversible buckle works just fine...
2.0,If you have belly this is not for you. I really wish this had fit. I have crocs to match this to the T.
2.0,Not sturdy. Seems like they can break easily
2.0,color was so dull hard to even tell it was purple.
2.0,"Really liked these when I got them, look high quality. But there is a Hole in the crotch after only 1 wash - waste of money."
2.0,I am not impressed with this at all.  It arrived with a stain or something on the back.  It is not that long.  It is see through.
2.0,Poms must be attached with adhesive
2.0,"Sent back was ok, front looked good, back showed my bra lines and seemed unfinished. I am not chunky but curvy and back view seemed cheap. You get what you pay for."
2.0,"Too big for my head, kept coming down my forehead."
2.0,Material far to &#34;thin&#34; I think for some it may be right on but I was hoping for a better quality fabric.
2.0,The jibbits are so cute however I was not aware that the metal jibbits are not assembled and I’m not sure how or what I can put them together with ( I don’t own a hot glue gun)
2.0,I normally wear a Medium top but I wanted this to be flowy so I ordered a LARGE and couldn't even get it on!  Also this is a thin top so just be ready to wear a nude bra with it.
2.0,"Size is as described, fabric quality is not as expected. This one's on the thinner side."
2.0,This shirt isnt my favorite.  Its thinner material and actually is a weird fit. It looks stretched out buy then hikes up. I spent the whole time pulling it down trying to adjust it
2.0,"Really disappointed. My son enjoyed the features of this watch. However, it's not well made and broke after a month of wear. Probably better to spend a little more to get a longer life watch."
2.0,"Fabric is pretty thin, I was expecting some kind of stretch but this is pure cotton and polyester. Does not look fancy at all. This would probably shrink at least two sizes smaller if it were to get washed."
2.0,They look nice on but boy do they hurt.  I could not keep them on and kept touching my ears related to the level of discomfort. I do not recommend.
2.0,graphics discolored after one wash:(
2.0,"Great product looks good, the only problem is that it doesn't stay in place by the end of the day it rolled down under the breast area."
2.0,I don’t like that it won’t stay in place and rides up my back and is too stretchy. I will not buy this type again. I’m looking for the breezie bra that covers the back and sides under arms better.
2.0,This looks nothing like the picture here. The colors are way too bright! And the print is screen printed.
2.0,I wanted to love this so much but sadly it is made cheap. I received it yesterday and as soon as I opened the zipper the tassel fell off .<br />It’s a small wallet but the way it was made is kind of odd . The space you are suppose to hold money won’t exactly stretch all the way . It’s cute but no well made .
2.0,Cute but smaller than I expected.
2.0,I thought these socks were going to fit infants up to 12months. I didn't realize there were actually infant socks in the bunch. My daughter is 8 months she can't fit those itsy bitsy socks.
2.0,The scarf is cute and soft but it is worse than rolling around with a white-haired dog! My sweater underneath had a LAYER of fuzz on it. Awful
2.0,These are nice but too small. I had to send back. Make sure you have correct measurements when you order.
2.0,Cheaply made. Not as great as pictured
2.0,Not what I expected. It bubbles out in the waist and is tight in the arms. Returning.
2.0,"I'm 5'4"" and 110 lbs. I work out regularly. The pleats made me look fat. If you have a small bust and no hips it will work. Otherwise, try something else."
2.0,I am 5'3 140 lbs looking for high waist yoga shorts and I love the feel of the fabric and how it fits around the waist but it is too big around the crotch area. Fabric wrinkles up. Also the shorts are  a lot  longer than in The picture.
2.0,"they’re nice and stretchy, good size, nice colors. but they are thin, like see through. i doubles them up and you can still see through them. i had to sew 3 together. lol"
2.0,"Purchased my size but , runs very small"
2.0,"Like the fabric, great color but too big so fits funny."
2.0,Smaller than the size says
2.0,"This a cool wallet, lots of pockets and everything fits in it. However, the downside is a biggie: the money clip is so strong that it<br />makes removing items, like credit cards, almost impossible because the very strong pressure of the money clip. I struggled with<br />it every time and even dropped the wallet a few times. I thought maybe I might bent it to make it looser, but I thought that would ruin it. So I’m going to have to return it- and I’m bitter about it. So consider this before you buy."
2.0,"The nose piece does not pinch well and stay pinched sadly so I cannot wear these masks at work, I have to wear my glasses and they fog too badly.  They do not have a metal piece I’m guessing, so they do not conform to the nose"
2.0,"ehh, I could have purchased this from my local hairstore."
2.0,"I'm a 36C and this doesn't seem to sit right on my body. Even with the side elastics loosened it bunches up on me. I also don't really know what to do with the front tail. It doesn't lay flat (most likely because of the bunching top half) and tucking it into my bra just makes it worse, haha."
2.0,Not as flattering as shown.
2.0,Wish there's a width stated. It was narrower than i expected so i'm returning it
2.0,Was way to large.  Not sure how you get correct size when garment is sized 0-6 months.
2.0,"Material was okay, but the overall hang of the dress is horrible."
2.0,These didn't fit like in the picture. The slits went up too high causing the legs to really stick out on the sides.
2.0,poor quality and very small
2.0,I cannot use this rosary because there is one bead missing from it. I just got it an hour ago and am disappointed that I'll just have to throw it away. Amazon does not even want it back. I will not reorder an item of this quality.
2.0,They look great but they're not progressive lenses as advertised.
2.0,I order the xl 12-14 which is my normal size in large and it was too Big. The picture said runs small so I figured it would be ok to get my normal size for a better cut...i was  wrong.  It runs Large cute suit tho
2.0,Don't think it would be able to fit heavy people cut to small.
2.0,"I ordered these in size Large, as indicated by the size chart.  I'm not sure they would have fit on my arm, let alone my calf.  They looked like they were make for children.  I had to send them back."
2.0,great color but doesn't fit in chest
2.0,"Nice material, but way too small"
2.0,"UPDATE: 02/29/2016<br />Unfortunately after two days of wear, the metallic ring has already been ruined.  The silver metallic color ring developed blister like areas where the metallic coating has bubbled up and peeled off.  Now it has discolored patches all over it, not exactly the look I was hoping for.  The black and grey rings do not show any signs of this, nor do I think they will.  I think it has more to do with the metallic coating layer.  Since the metallic ring is the reason I bought this pack of rings this is extremely disappointing.  Because of this, I simply cannot recommend these rings, and will be looking for an alternative.<br /><br />I purchased this set of silicone rings because you get three for the price of one, and I was really interested in the metallic ring.  I have not seen any other silicone rings out there that feature this shiny metallic look.  It is this metallic one that I like the best out of the three, it has more traditional metal ring look to it.  I really like that fact that the manufacturer has kept their logo to the inside of the ring only, gives a nice clean finish to the outside.  The quality is top notch, no blemishes or rough edges around the outside of the rings.  They all are very consistent in color, no fading or color spots.  These are true to size, they fit perfectly like they should.<br /><br />I recently hurt a couple of my fingers pretty badly playing basketball, one of them being the ring finger on my left hand.  Previously, I had a tungsten ring on.  My finger swelled up around the ring and there was no way to get it off, and I wasn't going to have it cut off.  Several weeks of ice and ibuprofen, and a lot of tugging an pulling and pain and I was finally able to get it off.  Even tried the dental floss trick (look it up on Youtube), didn't work.  Needless to say this could have all been avoided if I had these silicone rings.  The rings are flexible and stretchy and would easily come off of a swollen finger.<br /><br />These rings are also very flexible and lightweight, they conform to the shape of the finger.  I no longer have to worry about scratching my ring or hurting my hands while lifting weights.  I work in a warehouse all day long with machines and can wear these rings all day long without risking an injury.  These are great rings for active individuals who use there hands, they are so lightweight you will forget that you have them on.  I received these rings at a discount for my fair and honest opinion."
2.0,Omg so cheap!! Definitely not worth 50 dollars. Will be returning.
2.0,"The fabric in the photo looks like a soft, thick, waffle knit. It’s very thin, and cheaply made. Fabric is like a shiny polyester. I’m super bummed because I had high hopes for this. Runs extremely small. I’m a size 16/18 but order the 3X for an oversized look. The 3X is more like a regular large."
2.0,Does not tie at the waist so not as shown in picture
2.0,"The necklace I received is different from the one in the pictures and in many of the other reviews' pictures as well. It seems some of us got a completely different product. Mine was straight, not curved. Mine also broke before I even got a chance to wear it. I never write bad reviews, but I was slightly disappointed with this item. Hopefully everyone else has a better experience because it was a nice necklace besides that."
2.0,It's a cool looking necklace. However the knot ended up turning a tarnished bronze color. I wear it all the time. The silver started rubbing off after about three weeks. It would be good as a necklace to ware every once in a while. However not something you can ware everyday if you want to to stay looking nice.
2.0,This dress is very plain with just a simple thin elastic waist and wristbands that really leave it lacking and didn't make it very flattering. The pattern on the fabric wasn't my favorite either. It reminded me of cartoonish footprints or something.
2.0,"the magnetic snap is weak, it does not stay closed and keep contents from spilling out otherwise the material is very nice. If you are willing to replace the magnetic snap to a regular snap then it will be a great little carry bag."
2.0,"Hey! This outfit would have been super cute on me but..... It didn't for at all. I am 5'5, 182 & 40D with a decent &#34;back side&#34; I ordered an extra large since I was going off of other people reviews. It wouldn't zip up at all. 😒"
2.0,"This is supposed to be a 120 click bezel, although it fits as it should, it only clicks 60 times per revolution.The seller is unreachable for an answer. I'd find another source for any watch parts."
2.0,It's just too big for me. It's doesn't hold things in place when running or working out.
2.0,"Nice jacket, but I had to return it because of the color. In a room it looks kind of green, but out side in the light it looks like diarrhea yellow. Fit ok and was warm,but that color tho....."
2.0,"The print and color was nice. I ordered a medium because I thought the small after washing would be too small. Well, the mediam pants were more like an extra small and the top was more like a small."
2.0,"I'll give this 2 stars because the top is super cute, I wish I could just purchase the top - it is a really pretty color orange. The pants however are SO tight. They look super billowy and loose in the picture but I look like a stuffed sausage. I don't even think an XL would be more roomier... for reference I am 5'7"" and 170lbs with thick thighs and butt."
2.0,Beautiful and well made just didn't fit like I thought they would.
2.0,"Odd fit and cut on me. I couldn’t get the zipper closed beyond my waist. I have a small frame and weigh 138. I wear a size 6 pants, so I thought a medium size would fit. Not so. I don’t think the large size would even fit right on me. The shoulder area had elastic gathers and wide opening which I’ve never seen on a dress. And the sewn ties on one side confused me. Too short to use as a belt nor long enough to make a bow. Looked funny just hanging there on one side. I did like the length, which fell mid calf on my 5’5” frame. Sleeves were very snug too. The tops I buy are always 6-8 and sleeves never feel as tight as these did in a medium. It is always a risk buying clothes made out of country since they can be made for more petite body frames."
2.0,Ordered this as a cute dress for fall postpartum. Figured it would hide a belly and be cute with a denim jacket and booties. I’m 5’4 and it hit mid-to high thigh. No thanks.
2.0,Glued together. Stem to small for shirt. But these haven’t fell apart yet like other glued cuffs on Amazon.
2.0,Placement/design of pockets not flattering. Adds a curve at the hip silhouette.  Have had other pants that give pockets but don't detract in fit.  Otherwise nice material and good quality for the price.
2.0,"Cute bag, but the smell is overwhelming. I bought this on a deep discount day on a risk since the reviews were mixed. The bag itself is very very cute and a wonderful size for me as a mom. However the chemical smell is terrible. I've had it airing out for over a week and the smell has not diminished at all. I'm not sure if the bag will be usable since the smell doesn't seem to be going away."
2.0,The top is to small and the bottom was to big I wish I could exchange for a 2x shirt large bottom. I purchased a xl
2.0,"Cheap, pills right away, stretches size down."
2.0,Not very durable. Had elastic strings hanging after first wash. Soon developed holes all over.
2.0,"The dress ran a bit long for me, I'm 5'2. Would be best for someone a bit taller, or be prepared to hem. Other than the length it fit decently, and the style was cute. HOWEVER. The white color is completely see through. I should have trusted other reviewers who mentioned it. Had to return it. Fabric is very thin. Might be alright in a darker color but the white was unwearable, unless you are going for a just a swim coverup."
2.0,"I rarely have reactions to earrings, but unfortunately these started irritating my ears as soon as I put them in, even after wiping them down with rubbing alcohol. I tried a second time, a few days later, but after a minute it was unbearable and I had to take them out. This happened with each pair I tried. I wish I could have worn them, as they are very chic."
2.0,"The set is beautiful but, one of the earrings didn't clasp shut."
2.0,"Definitely get what you pay for. The black dye that they use to paint the channel the stones are in was not cleanly applied.  splotches were everywhere and the dye overwhelms the stones to the point that you can’t tell that they are blue, there is no sparkle and even can’t tell if some stones are even there."
2.0,Fit as expected and fabric is nice but decals came off 2/3 pairs after two washes!
2.0,They are cute earrings but sadly the red pair arrived broken irreparably
2.0,"Used while pouring a stamped concrete floor, the shoes themselves worked well, they held me with no issues (250lbs), the back strap was a bit short to fit around my work boots but I managed to get it to work with 0 slack, about an hour into the job one of the front buckles broke, it was a good thing I was at the outside edge of the room so the buckle and strap only dragged through a small portion of the concrete"
2.0,"Material is so thin you can see my colorful tattoos in the sunlight in the light colored dress.<br />Returning. I had high hopes too! I wanted a light colored summer dress. Bought a large, for reference I'm 5'5 and a size 6 in banana republic dresses, 34 C.<br /><br />customer service with this company is amazing. they contacted me to rectify the situation. will update once it's sorted out."
2.0,"I give it 2 stars because it's actually a nice looking watch case. The main gripe I have is this winder is ONLY functional with the SPIN-R mobile app, and there is no way to interface with the winder without it. Therefore, if the app doesn't work properly (which has been me experience more often than not) the watch winder becomes useless. But hey, at least you have a nice looking holder.<br />When the interface does work it leaves many questions to trial and error because the instructions are lacking. Such simple things as; does the winder still function if not connected to phone by bluetooth are left to the consumer to figure out because the instructions do not include much information on the actual day to day operation. You're pretty much told plug it in, download the app, turn it on and use the app. Also it is clear the instructions were not written by somebody with a strong command of the english language. This may be just a pet peeve of mine but it shows a lack of attention to detail and attention to detail is something I would expect for a device most likely used to maintain higher end time pieces.<br />Often the buttons on the app do not work, or take forever to load. If you look at the app on the app store the third picture is of the main interface screen, you will notice the spinning circle in the center meaning it is trying to load (see attached screen shot). So I'm guessing whomever took the pics was experiencing the same issues I was and they just gave up waiting for it to load and just took the picture.<br />On a positive note, the watch winder is ascetically pleasing and seems to be of decent construction.<br /><br />In conclusion I believe this winder has potential, but is not ready for release to the mass market. The ability to control with the app should be a feature, and not the only way to control the winder. There should be controls on the winder to enable manual input so the winder would always be functional."
2.0,"This sweater looks NOTHING like the picture- even the color is different. I ordered it as a gift for my mom. Luckily, she hadn’t seen the picture online so she didn’t know any different and thinks it’s alright. It was very long- almost to the knee, and does not slouch over the shoulder as pictured. The white is more of a creamy beige. I’m disappointed but I’m glad my mom likes it for what it is."
2.0,This is certainly a bargain and works well but size makes it awkward and clumsy.
2.0,"Cheap but what do you expect. All broke within a couple uses, if that. Oh well"
2.0,They were too small for his shoes.Never used them.Wasted money.
2.0,Too small for a big head. My 6 and 9 year old daughters love wearing it.
2.0,Just ran small and not flattering once I tried them on. I'm going to cut them down more because the drag is too much. They are tighter in the waist and rear. Not comfortable at all since not much stretch for bigger tummies. Felt constricted and took them off after a few hours.
2.0,I wanted a dark  green color. But I don't  like it because  light  color
2.0,"Very thin material, after washing once material faded . They do hold the mask but I don’t think they will hold up very long ."
2.0,I expected better quality for the price.  Strands of leather are extremely thin...I was looking for something a little more bold but yet feminine.  Would need to wear both of these together to achieve the look in the picture of product.
2.0,It’s ultra thin and not what I expected with a turtleneck…not very stretchy at all and I will probably have to give it to my son! It will serve as underwire instead of a regular turtleneck because is the quality
2.0,"Wanted this to be great, loved the knit with woven sleeves. There were numerous strings coming out all over and one section the thread was completely unraveled. I think it also runs a tad large. Going to have to sent it back. 😭"
2.0,I bought these for my grandson but they were too big.  I ordered a size 8 but they run kinda big so my grandson did not like them.  I will end up donating them to a shelter.  I know there is someone out there that can use them.  I'd rather not send them back.
2.0,"You get two pairs, but the black keeps the heat in and doesn't feel like it's reflecting the sun. The white gets dirty real quick and they're already unraveling"
2.0,The picture does this pin more justice than it deserves. I have many pieces of Heidi’s jewelry and love them all. But this piece is not that cute or pretty. Probably will return. Very pricey for what it is!!!
2.0,"Really cute , however I ordered a 0-3 month and it fits more like a 3-6 month . Also the bow shown is just a piece of fabric to tie , disappointing because I’m bad at tying them ."
2.0,"Cute purse, but NOT LEATHER. instead it is an awkward rubbery material."
2.0,Runs way too small I wear size 8 and with this bottom I should of ordered 3xl.
2.0,the color is completely off and the size chart does not help at all nice material maybe need 2 sizes smaller
2.0,These are nice and comfortable but get them wet and become see though which is not best situation to be in public.  The lining is not solid material which aids this issue.
2.0,"I ordered these shoes for my one year old and loved them right away. The 6-12 month size fit her perfectly, but after a few hours of wearing, the paint started rubbing off on one of the shoes! I'm so disappointed with this purchase because they are so cute but they got ruined so quickly! Also, it's strange that only one of the shoes got ruined...the other one looks brand new...I want a refund..."
2.0,Runs super small 2T fit like 12-18 mos
2.0,"Two stars, because the quality seems really nice, but they sent the WRONG ITEM!  I made this purchase after having frantically searched my local area for a black bandeau bikini and not having found anything.  This was supposed to be for a last-min weekend getaway, and I even paid for the one-day shipping.  I was completely crushed when I opened the package to find a ruffled string bikini top (the bottoms looked the same as pictured).  I might have just lived with it even though I don't like the ruffles, had it at least been a BANDEAU, which was the whole point, but it is a sting bikini top!  I cannot remove the straps, or just push them down--it's a halter, and it's needed for keeping the top on at all! I don't want tan lines, thus the bandeau.  I will be returning this item, and am so disappointed not to have had the amazing bikini pictured for my weekend away."
2.0,"Item is super big and unusable, was also 2 days late in shipping.  Ordered medium got a extra extra large"
2.0,"They were so tiny, not as shown in the picture.."
2.0,Too see through. It was flattering but cheap. I returned it. If any color would work it would be black not white
2.0,Very pretty but too small and felt very constrictive
2.0,I ordered XL in women's. These fit like a size 3 in women's. Runs very small!
2.0,"Scratches super easy, so it looks horrible in acouple of days :("
2.0,I thought it was going to lay smoothly like video but it's wasn't.
2.0,"Although the design is sound, the construction is not.  The length of the double-hook back connector is 7 3/4 inches, end to end.  The span from the two belt loops left and right of the center belt loop is 11 inches.  If connected as designed, it creates a pucker up the back of the pants."
2.0,These suck so bad smh. They are basically regular gloves you’d wear outside. I won’t wear these to work again my fingers are killing me
2.0,Superrrr bummed this didn't fit. I like wearing bandeau style suits (no straps)& the top of the bathing suit had no support. Literally a sagging mess. Gross.
2.0,"Very ill fitting. It's a compression shirt so it should fit relatively snug....well they don't, it's almost baggy on me, order at least one size smaller then normal. I'm a petite person with smaller chest so I bet they fit a curvy woman perfect, but for me and my A cups and not much curve it was baggy and I never wear them, kinda wish I could send them back but it's too late now"
2.0,They are only ment for very small ears. Dont work on normal people
2.0,"The glasses fit fine, and the price is good, but these glasses are just too dark to see through.<br />Maybe if you were welding..."
2.0,The back of the tie is held to get her by a single loosely sewn thread spaced a inch apart as you can see in the picture I added. You will have to sew these together yourself after more than one use. Other than that they look nice.
2.0,"Too small,  but I'll make it work"
2.0,"Nice, but could've been a bit longer as a shawl"
2.0,"The material was much thinner than I expected, and it did not lay properly.  I was going to send it back, but I forgot all about it."
2.0,It was very well made but it was extremely to short I would not recommend for anyone tall
2.0,"Unfortunately, they do not stay fastened.... I have lost one of them because of that."
2.0,I wasn’t happy with the fit. It was a little bit to baggy in the legs.
2.0,"I ordered a size up since most of the reviews said to. I am 5'4&#34; (145 lbs) and usually wear a Medium...but is was too big.  Also, I did not like the how the lining was not sewn down on the insides of the front of the front of the coat...it caused it to look very bulky there, and it had to be smoothed down before buttoning up...or it hung out. That's what bothered me most about the sweater. If it wasn't for that, I would have reordered it in a Medium. The fabric is like a sweatshirt...and the hood is nice and large. Returned."
2.0,Doesn't seem to be a high quality product at the price point.  Disappointed.
2.0,It’s a pretty band but began to lift off the base after a few weeks wear
2.0,This is an under the sweater layering top. Material is slim fit and a little see-through
2.0,These run a tad large. They are baggy in the knees. Cute jean but returned because of the fit in the leg.
2.0,Really small fit
2.0,Beautiful but can't wear
2.0,"Im 5'4"" 137lbs curvy, I bought a medium size shirt, I tried the small first and returned it. Both sizes fit, the small I feel was a little snug and would shrink and wasn't complimentary in appearance, the medium is long and fits weird. On my hands too long, in the base of the shirt, certain parts of the shirt does not allow for any curves so it's snug in the bicep/ tricep area but big in the rest or the arm, snug in the hips, but too baggy in the stomach area, so it looks very weird. I feel a large I would be swimming in it. I think I will keep it, if it washes well and doesn't shrink, only because it seems difficult to find a long sleeve athletic shirt anymore for a reasonable price.I have some expensive specialty shirts for cooler weather but don't feel women should have to pay $100.00 to get something decent to workout in for everyday use, but I guess apparently we do. The material is thin but I live in AZ so I'm ok with that part, it definitely is disappointing and does not fit as expected, but in an odd way, normally women's shirts are made to compliment a women's figure this one is not very complimentary to a curvy figure at all. Even when I'm thinner I'm still curvy, so feel it no matter the size would fit awkwardly. Excuse the poor lighting pictures, just wanted to make curvier women aware of the possible odd fit!"
2.0,These are too thin to be any protection against COVID.
2.0,"No support, no fabric under cup to hold bra up.  If there was more fabric under the cup, I’d love this.  It’s so close to being good, but doesn’t fit.  Please make for 32F."
2.0,WAY WAY too small! I ordered the XL and gave it fits my friend who wears a size Medium.
2.0,very light material no structure to it so its good for summer or a situation where you just want loose/casual. Nice color but I am returning it.
2.0,"It's cute but the size is super awkward.  I ordered a large, lower part of dress fit fine but the upper part fit like an XS. It was weird. I couldn't return without paying for it to be returned"
2.0,Flip up shades wiggle a lot and the glasses are small
2.0,This Item arrived with an odor. After soaking it and washing it twice the odor finally seemed to be gone. I tried it on and the straps are not sewed on very well. One strap popped off by barely trying it on. I would not order this again. Like the look but not the quality.
2.0,Teeny tiny.  Returned.
2.0,Could make it fit my chest right to baggie and loose looks frumpy sent back
2.0,Unravels easy
2.0,Wrong Color.
2.0,The top portion doesn't match the bottom portion.  The top black is darker and a different fabric than the floral bottom. The black parts of the bottom floral are lighter and it just looks weird.
2.0,"Other slippers I bought on Amazon were too small. So I was excited to see the larger sizes these slippers came in. I bought a pair that finally fit well. Unfortunately, the left foot slipper has missing padding from the toe :( The right foot slipper is fine, just the left foot."
2.0,they don't look like the photo they aren't shiny at all and the texture seems uncomfortable idk after a day of wearing and honesty a little nervous because they almost have those jelly shoes will cut your fit feel .. hmm
2.0,Wore this for a costume. It is super poor quality and very see through.
2.0,Not a good investment on this Sunglasses.
2.0,"I love the fabric; it's thick and comfortable. Unfortunately the golden band at the front is sewn unevenly. Looking at everyone else's rave reviews, I wonder if I was just unlucky and got a defective item?  I'm 5'4&#34; and size L hits midcalf. I'm 149 lb with measurement 39-30-40, ordered size L based on the seller's size chart. The dress was big on me and I should have bought my regular size M."
2.0,"this is so cute, but it turned black in a week."
2.0,"The band I received is not genuine leather. I did a water test on it which proved it’s not real and it doesn’t smell like leather at all even though it’s stamped on the back. It is, however, a comfortable and soft band. At first I thought it was defective because one side would not snap into place, then I realized I had it upside down. It was my impression that these bands should only go on one way. As far as the buckle goes, it looks real cheap and light weight. It has a dull finish and is definitely not stainless steel. I will go ahead a keep this band and do an update on my review if it doesn’t last long. As of now, I would definitely NOT recommend this watch band."
2.0,"Whoever came up with the design to put a cord inside a shoe did not think it through, my son gets blisters and sores around the area where the cord is even when putting it in the sleeve and putting more padding there."
2.0,"i went to take my nieces car seat out of my car, and a piece to help hold the strap to stay on my wrist had broken off."
2.0,"Updating my review. I was initially pleased with these shoes. The size seemed a bit small but they loosened up after a few rides and fit well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the soles and cleat mounts absolutely suck. I use these for spin several times per week-- maybe 2 hours per week on average. And they have not held up well at all. The plastic mount cracked in one shoe after only a few months. I move the cleats up to the other two holes and it was okay, if not as comfortable as before because the crack weakened the support and caused the sole to flex a bit.<br /><br />At this writing, the same thing has happened in the second shoe. Disappointing, because I have really enjoyed having a shoe I could wear into and out of the gym that didn't look like part of a stormtrooper outfit. I am going to replace them with something that should hold up better and it'll almost certainly be a more traditional cycle shoe. Wish me luck..."
2.0,The top portion was too big even in the size small even though I wear a size 2 dress and a size 34ddd bra.  I am not sure who this dress is designed to fit.  I returned it.  It is also super short.
2.0,Used 2 weeks and the zippers stopped working.
2.0,Wanted to love. Cute but would not stay in place. Buttons are low and headband is large.
2.0,This shirt runs small and super see thru
2.0,They do not fit my ear correctly
2.0,"Great looking plaid blazer but no lining and much shorter and thinner that it looks in picture. Runs small,"
2.0,"These are puffy thin summer pants.  Not that great quality with a funny fit.<br /><br />Material: veeery thin woven material.  Definitely for the warmer months as cold air would get right through these.  The prints are cute and fun with good color saturation.<br /><br />Construction: simply sewn. Ruffles at waste are served at edges, thin elastic band at ankles.<br /><br />Fit: very puffy and lose.  These look like “MC Hammer” pants on my daughter.  The ruffles at the waist are a mess after washing, there’s no way I’m going to iron them each time so they are what they are which looks like a mini tutu on her.<br /><br />We will keep these in her wardrobe when laundry gets low but overall I would not recommend or give as a gift.<br /><br />If you found this helpful could you please hit “helpful” below? Much appreciated!"
2.0,Took a month to get here with no tracking. Smaller then I thought and I'm almost positive this isn't actually quartz.
2.0,"Band was too small for me and I have small wrists, now my wife has it."
2.0,"I like the way they look in the picture, but they completely didn’t fit. I ordered a medium and considered a large, but I tend to go small/medium so I thought I’d be ok. I liked the material, not see through and rather soft. They were very tight around my calves (really my knees because they were short) to the point it was uncomfortable. And they were SHORT. I’m 5’9” and they came to just below my knees. Barely. Maybe they would’ve been better in a larger size (?)"
2.0,Short. and the colors are not as vibrant as the picture. The white is see-through and the colors are dull
2.0,"Looks cheap, feels cheap. Bright and cheery cheap.  I can get nicer quality at Walgreens, Bartells or Target."
2.0,"They turned my ears green within 2 days, also gold set tarnished very quickly"
2.0,Beads come off
2.0,"Purchased in January, 2016. Broke in September, 2016. Mad in China."
2.0,No shape I buys this type of jumpsuit often this one just no good material
2.0,"The material is rough and cheap. The back is long enough but the front and the sleeves are shorter than you might expect. This sweater is, however, perfect as a costume - especially Velma from Scooby Doo."
2.0,"It’s inexpensive, but it’s also tiny."
2.0,Sizing guidelines are not accurate.
2.0,It was supposed to be two piece but there were no pants with it. It was supposed to be a Christmas present  now I need to spend more money
2.0,"Dress is beautiful, but the necklace was broken. I had to order a different set."
2.0,"The fit should say too short!!! This dress is so cute on the internet...but I got the dress and it was no where near being a maxi dress... I'm only 5'6&#34; and it came to only below my knees.. super disappointed, because it is cute, but looks dumb as a below knee dress."
2.0,"They didn't fit over my Regulars Eye Glasses, Had to push and bend to finally get over my glasses,"
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:579a2a46981bcd99fcb1bd595b7c47da]] update: after using this for a month or two I started to get eye discomfort and headache, at first I didn't really thought about it but after stopped using this for awhile my discomfort and headache went away. I'll be putting it in the recycling bin and looking for another brand.<br /><br />Liked the clear lens, did not distort or change colors of what you see, wear it during work for couple days and did not felt any discomfort, I also happen to like the style of the design"
2.0,"The color and material were cute, but the pockets did not look like the picture and they didn't end up working for me."
2.0,I didn't like the feel of the material of this bed jacket. Sleeves too short. Am returning.
2.0,"I ordered Denim Blue and received navy.  Also, as a woman who is a size Large, it was tight-ish; this garmet is not one size fits all/most."
2.0,Need to put the size on it
2.0,"I was really hoping to make this a wardrobe staple (fits great and figured I'd order more), but after wearing this once and hand washing, it's pilling.<br /><br />For the price I would have expected to get a few months, maybe even a season out of this item."
2.0,"A VERY long necklace. Also, had a blackened mark on the chain that was clearly visible...looks cheaply made."
2.0,Too small for anything but a few credit cards and a small amount of change.
2.0,The little nuts that hold the screws come off so easily and you do not notice until your lenses fall off. I was very disappointed on how little these glasses lasted.
2.0,"A little pricey for the quality - I ordered black and they are see through. I am 5' 9&#34; and they come 3 inches above the ankle, so more of a cropped pant. Waistline leads to muffin top. Still deciding whether I'll return or not, but probably will."
2.0,"Most important to me:  Shipping cost $2.95 and $8.65 to return via USPS.  Unless you are a gambler, don't bet on this $25 nightgown.  I wear size 6 or 8 clothes but I don't like to be confined when I sleep so I ordered a size large.  This nightgown is cut small in the shoulders and was snug on me.  I imagine it would be too small if it was laundered.  The thing that I really hated was the petroleum smell of the cheap flannel.  This is something I found before in Chinese sheets.  I had to wash them 4 times to get the smell out. The flannel is skimpy, too. It is very long, like in the photo, and that is not safe if you like to dash around the house or go up and down stairs.  It is cute and so it might work for someone tall and thin who likes to do laundry.  I am spoiled by my Lanz flannel night gown, so after throwing away $11.60 on shipping I will spring for the $60 cost of a quality nightgown in the future."
2.0,Very floppy. Maybe I needed to stuff cotton in front. There was no curl at the tip of shoe cover.
2.0,These rings are very cute and dainty BUT I ordered rose gold and after a few weeks or wear they are no longer rose gold. They are a regular yellow gold. It's like they were painted rose and it all came off. I will still wear them but I wanted them to go with a rose gold ring I had.
2.0,It’s a super cute bag but falls apart so quickly the bow in the front fell off the second day so not a good buy
2.0,The lace is very poor quality.
2.0,"I received these bracelets, May21 and wore them today, June 28 and already have lost three charms on one and one charm on the other. Not happy at all."
2.0,I really like the fit.  This suit would be great for Water Aerobics or Lap Swimming if  the lining was a bit thicker.  The lining is so thin that it is almost like having NO lining.  I personally would not buy this suit again.
2.0,"The sleeves are huge, the fit around your body is huge, and it is very short. I am 5'6, 125 pounds and it swallows me up but doesn't even cover my butt. Not flattering at all and impossible to do much with your arms while wearing it. It's not the worst thing, but definitely not what I was expecting"
2.0,"Let's just say, it's under 10 bucks for a reason."
2.0,This product is super comfortable but it’s not true to size. I have only warn these pants 3 times and they already have a hole in the pockets. Poor quality.
2.0,"Looked cheap, fabric was itchy, they size was off.  Would not recommend."
2.0,"I bought this bag for my new job, and I was really excited about it. I love how it felt, and the fact that it had three different ways to be carried. Except when I went to use the longest strap, it broke off like nothing. I returned it and wanted to get the same black one with brown handles, and they don't even have it available anymore. So the quality wasn't great, but I liked the design. I wish it would have been durable."
2.0,"I absolutely live the changeable jewels but after only wearing it a few times, the chain broke. I work in an office and just caught it on my desk as I stood up. Nothing snagged it, it just snapped. I plan to buy a new chain for it because it is very pretty."
2.0,These are not knee length as all they were mid thigh. Yes I’m tall but the bigger the skirt the longer it should be also. I returned them.
2.0,Unhappy as an inside seam opened up after only one week
2.0,"Ordered the lemon pattern in the large. The fit was great, but the pattern looks nothing like picture. Returning bc the pattern is not cute and looks cheap."
2.0,Poor quality. Too skimpy.
2.0,Grommet holes for strap aren't symmetrical. Hard to hook on strap because one hole is in too far
2.0,Ordered a 6 and was given a 9. Now I’m trying to return/ exchange and it’s being difficult and the wedding is in three weeks! It’s a shame because the dress itself is lovely.
2.0,Tiny tiny earrings.  Do not believe the pics.
2.0,"The crotch fit is just odd, the fabric is flimsy and the stitching is bad and came out of the hems on all pairs in all lengths. Got what I paid for but I can sleep in them. Plus size beware, not a good choice for us"
2.0,"definitely look homemade, you can see the hot glue strings and the pieces done really look too secure. Also I only received 11 in a package. So hopefully one kid is absent on Halloween."
2.0,they keep feet warm. snug. but they developed significant holes on the bottom of both socks within 2-3wks of using them.
2.0,"I could still wear it even though it is a tighter fit than I like, but the Vee is way too deep."
2.0,"Right out of the bag I could smell a strong chemical smell and my husband who is not sensitive to smells smelled it too. The faces on the socks are cute, but a few of them have colors that don't look quite like the pictures..."
2.0,"Not bad for the price, but looks cheap"
2.0,Wayyyy too small! I was super excited for this jacket and it ran way too small I sold it to a friend for her 12 year old super small daughter . I wished to order another but nothing shows for any larger sizes.. Bummer
2.0,"I'm so disappointed. I was sent the socks and they were completely different colors than shown. There were two pinks, two grays and two whites instead of the vibrant colors in the product pic. Sadly, the grays were ugly and the whites were already dingy - probably bad manufacturing - so they looked dirty. I don't know how they fit as I sent them back srill in the package, though they looked like normal, thin athletic socks. They don't have extra padding and probably wouldn't last a long time, but for the price that's to be expected."
2.0,Cute but sleeves too sheer for work
2.0,Cheaply made and broke without a few uses.
2.0,important to know that straps are not adjustable
2.0,COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!! Stopped working after a few days. Looking to return for refund.
2.0,"After I washed the three facemask I received, only one was wearable. The elastic broke on one and the other one shrank. I suppose one out of three is not so bad considering what I paid for them."
2.0,"They look nice I'll give them that but they don't last long at all. This is how they look after a 2 weeks. I don't work with water, grease, or any type of liquids. I am a grocery store manager and just walk in store and cleaning these is practically useless as the creasing gets worse with moisture. Disappointed as they were $50. My off brand shoes lasted longer."
2.0,I didn't expect it to be in 2 pieces. 2 separate bangles!  Is that how it's supposed to be?
2.0,This shoe is not sturdy and bends easily. My toddlers toes kept coming out the top when she would bend her foot.
2.0,Not super impressed. It’s very thin to the point of being see through. And the neckline is huge for the size...I wear a 2x in t shirts and got that size and the neckline is so big both braw straps show and it almost hangs off my shoulders. If I was more knowledgeable in sewing I may be able to fix it but as it is I won’t wear it
2.0,My size XL was not what I expected. It fits more like a medium. I can say I like the lining in the garment.
2.0,Had to return it. Buttons were barely sewn on and the top/neck was too big
2.0,"The pink, yellow and turquoise earrings are pale, not bright as shown in the pic!"
2.0,"Although a little large, I liked the fit of these glasses and they seemed to be made well. However, the lenses are not polarized.  The tester included with the glasses looked no different when viewed with the glasses on (and I tried several angles, even tilted the glasses trying to get a polarizing effect).  I wore these driving to work and saw no difference in glare from oncoming headlights, which was the main reason I bought them."
2.0,To small. He wears a 14 and this was up to his waist.
2.0,The shirt looks nice: but too much neck space
2.0,"The material used to make this is pretty good quality. However, I have not been able to wear this and don't really see how I ever can. In the picture the metal chains go straight across her forehead. However on the actual headband the changes are connected diagonally causing them to criss cross on your head. I spend almost an 1/2 hour trying to detangle it before I realized what was going on & why I couldn't possibly get it straight! So now it just sits in my draw until the day I feel energetic enough to attempt to take it apart & weld it back together correctly! Yah... That will be the day!"
2.0,This looks like a $16 shirt. The fabric is cheap and oddly stretchy. Spend your money on something more expensive that looks nice.
2.0,"The Amazon website for this item showed ASIN#B01G18O41A denoting size 10-13/shoe:6-10. I wear a size 10 shoe so I assumed I was ordering the right socks.  Upon receipt, I noted on the socks package ASIN#B01G18O546 and I also noted the socks were WAY TOO SMALL.  In other words the ASIN # on the package of socks I received was different than the ASIN# in Amazon's website."
2.0,Despite the product description these don't fit well in ps5 controllers. The thunbsticks rub against the side of the controller and can get stuck
2.0,Be careful about the sizing of these. My glasses are 135mm by 38mm and these were too small.
2.0,"too slippery, baby keeps slipping"
2.0,"It feels like it cost $5 to make. Didn't really fit, and looked worse then the photo. You can definitely buy it if you need a costume, but really just a one wear thing"
2.0,the dress fit but wasn't dressy enough for a wedding
2.0,"Big, boxy and looked more like pajamas or a night gown. Weird material too. Wouldn't recommend."
2.0,Great concept but the straps aren't long enough. They pull up toward the neck and you can see it
2.0,Smaller than I thought and strange shaped.  Disappointed
2.0,Fell apart pretty quickly.. not made very well.
2.0,"Not satisfied,white one have some yelow stain.QC took a day off apparently"
2.0,"Unfortunately, I have to return this suit. The top is very small. I bought a large I’m at 36D cup. Usually I’m a size 6 or 8 in clothing… The bottoms go way too high up and it looks like you have a saggy diaper on ha ha not flattering to my size 6 or e8 body at all. The top is very small even with the cops out… So if you’re more than a 34C cup, I would not order this Have to return it and the color is a lot dollar than the color of the pink they’re showing or mauve  online."
2.0,"I normally fit a 10.5, so I went with the size 11 G4 (it's annoying that there aren't half sizes, btw), and the fit does not feel secure enough for barefoot wear (you mean I need a sock inside my barely-more-than-a-sock 'shoe' thingy?), as they fit slightly loose, letting the foot slide around inside. Ruling out any possibility of a better fit with the next size down: the rubber sole cups around the foot and tends to press in on my little toe, which is very irritating, if not a tragic design flaw considering that a proper barefoot-like feel requires allowance for toe splay.<br /><br />As for materials? The smothering neoprene/TPU construction makes the feet grow sweaty quickly (which only worsens the issue of slipping). And then there's the fact that the sole is held to the upper with glue... and upon receiving them I immediately noticed it was either peeling away already or had simply not been properly glued on in a couple spots. Either way, it reflects poorly on craftsmanship.<br /><br />On top of all that, the specific shape of the sole, and how it connects to the upper, causes a hideous buckling to occur right around the center of the interior side of the foot. And it's not just on my foot; I see this in every photo. This causes what might otherwise appear to be a simple sock to take on the appearance of a sock worn through mud, taken off and allowed to dry, then put back on once the mud had dried and deformed.<br /><br />Despite the issues, I briefly considered keeping them for winter house slippers. But they're simply nowhere near being worth the money, so I returned them for a refund.<br /><br />For now I will be sticking with Vibram FiveFingers for all athletic needs despite the small issue of having to individually align the toes when putting them on. I may try the Soft Star Moc3 next."
2.0,If you are smaller than a C cup this might fit. I wear 36C and was super tight
2.0,"I was so excited for this shirt. I ordered the same color as the ad and it is ver see through. My issue with this shirt is the construction, one side is extremely baggy and not in a flattering way. You cant raise your arms in this shirt with out having to readjust the top...which is not a quick fix. Also the shirt is no where near as long as it looks in the picture, it comes to the top of my hip and does not hang low in the back."
2.0,"It’s cute, but it doesn’t keep the same tightness all day - I find it gradually loosens, which defeats the purpose of a belt."
2.0,"Its a nice color and looks good, but as expected for the price its badly worked. The seam is coming apart and the loop for the small end was hanging on one string"
2.0,Very cheap made. Breaks very easily..
2.0,The metal irritates my skin something fierce on my calves.
2.0,Unflattering fit and made from cheap material
2.0,It wasn’t a quality I was expecting
2.0,I’m not understanding why the  crown is positioned the way that it is. This is very off.  I think it will request a refund. I see that another purchaser had the same issue.
2.0,"Purchased for a bridal shower. The ribbon was so loose it fell every time the bride moved. While we were eating, it basically sat around her waist rather than around her shoulders. The fabric was okay, but felt scratchy."
2.0,"This shirt (IMO) is atypical of the quality I expect from MK.  The material or weave perhaps, seemed ""loose"" / too easily made shabby looking / doesn't stand up etc...<br /><br />This is the first shirt of many, purchased and worn, from MK that I do not care for.  Would not buy it again."
2.0,"THought these were awesome, but they have started to fall apart 5 weeks after purchase.  Of course, the return/replacement window just closed on May 11th, so I'm just stuck with these broken shoes that I got to wear for a month.  Thanks."
2.0,"Made of cheap looking vinyl, but then again, they're cheap. I bought these for a pipe band application, which I would not recommend. If you wanted these for a costume, they would work perfectly fine."
2.0,"I thought this was going to be bigger. And it is orange,yellow"
2.0,STIFF CHEAP MATERIAL
2.0,This shirt would’ve been great except it is way toooo small!!!
2.0,Necklace was broken and the set seems to be very cheap. I was not impressed.
2.0,"It sheds like a large furry dog. The lint flies everywhere, on your clothes, in your mouth. As if that weren't enough, it's also a static cling mess making you a human taser. A warm, cute zapping mess."
2.0,It’s rigid rubber
2.0,"These are very light, the lightest. However, they have no reinforcement due to their lightness. So its basically like a duffle bag with tiny wheels. The bag will bulge out on the bottom from the weight of the clothes and suitcase contents. I recently bought two, and now both have holes in the bottom after one vacation. Wheeling the luggage down the street to our hotel, the bulge dragged and rubbed on the cement and wore holes in both suitcases in the area medial to the wheels. The wheels are too tiny, and cannot clear the bulge. Maybe I can duct tape the area or reinforce it somehow and use them a second time? In addition the side handle is about to rip off on one of the suitcases, since the handles also lack the reinforcement to lift a 40# suitcase."
2.0,"Nice on line, different tune when you receive it in person, try it on and doesn't feel right.  I donated it."
2.0,Meh. Not very chunky.
2.0,"I ordered a Small, in the Camel color, to wear in the Fall. It is giving…off-pink???  It’s a bummer bc that doesn’t work for my skin-tone.<br />The fit is great, the length is perfect (I’m 128lbs right now, 5’3)."
2.0,"Very low quality, made of some type of weird foam"
2.0,Waste of money. Made cheaply!
2.0,"My daughter plays soccer and needed a mask that would allow her to breathe well while playing.  These are not that. She wore them for ten minutes of one game and switched back to the paper masks that we use for everything else.  They look nice but we're slightly too big for my daughter.  She is fourteen and tall, but they were too big.  I tried one on and didn't notice much difference in the air flow of these compared to paper or other cloth masks."
2.0,The tiny little balls are impossible to replace once the rings are in your ears. I don't know how they'd work for piercings elsewhere. Otherwise the quality is good and they look just like the photo.
2.0,"In the picture this dress has a v-neck, the one I recieved has a very round neck."
2.0,"I'm 5'5&#34; and under 140 lb. I'm pretty flat chested and I'm a medium in shirts. I ordered an XL in this and it was way too tight in the bust. The tank top itself fit fine and was very soft and comfortable. Very restrictive, push-up-y. No way of removing the bra or bra pads, so this was a total dud for me.  Otherwise it would have been great. I just wanted something a little comfy.<br /><br />Like others have mentioned as well, the bra pads are show through the tank (they look very spongey). I do not recommend purchasing this if you plan to wear it alone. The tank top material is soft and feels cool enough to wear under stuff during warmer months though."
2.0,Too tight. This seemed to fit more like an XL than a 2x. Snug in the tummy area but may be able to make it work.
2.0,"Look nice but are cheaply made. Wear once, they dissolve, and then they get thrown away."
2.0,Very thin material. The pockets make my hips look bigger than the rest of my body. Returning.
2.0,The color was great but the fit runs small. I normally where XL and ordered a 2X for a relaxed fit but it was fitted and uncomfortable.
2.0,"It got lost in the mail so it did take about 3 months to arrive.  It also showed up in a different company's bag, not a great beginning.  The material is very lightweight and the color was as expected.  The fit and style was not as depicted, however.  The picture depicted a low waist around the hip area however it hits right below the bust.  The v-neck also appeared lower in the picture.  In reality there was one basting stitch up higher and no stitching in the rest of the neck line causing it to not lie flat or closed across the bust. The elastic waist also causes the skirt to have a wider appearance after the waist which is not particularly flattering on my figure."
2.0,Too large for me and just looked too weird when I tried it on. Had to send back.
2.0,"Locket itself is pretty great from the 12 hours I’ve had it. The chain on the other hand, that’s cheap and broke within an hour of having it on. Should you purchase this I recommend getting a better chain!"
2.0,muy chica
2.0,I did not like the way this fit on my thighs. It rubbed me the wrong way.
2.0,"The bra fits small. In sports there is light, medium and heavy support. this one is just tight.I am a fitness instructor and I a have never tried the La Isla brand before, the bra fits small, with no give or absorption. At the end of my class my unboob is drench in sweat. I have purchase another one to give it another try. Sadly same results as the first."
2.0,This nightgown is very soft and nice but it is not knee length. Maybe they sent me a petite version although it should be specified somewhere which is not. It is about 6 inches above the knees - waaay too short compared to what is advertised and wanted. It goes back.
2.0,"While the bracelet is pretty, because the rings are soldered on each side of it, the way it lays does not look like a classic Byzantine."
2.0,"I purchased these to replace another pair similar, same brand.  However, the toes fit tightly.  My previous pair was loose, which is important in a warm climate.  I would not buy these again.  A bit short in length for the size, so you have to either push your toes down into them or endure a hard ridge of material just under your heel."
2.0,"I ordered a blue and red shirt, they're both great shirts that fit as expected. The only quarrel I have with the blue shirt I bought is that the top button broke off the first time I put it on."
2.0,Very pretty but fits kind of weird.  Not a good shape for me.  I returned it.
2.0,It’s so short that the straps just dig into my shoulders all day causing too much pain.
2.0,"This mask is 3 layers, but it is very small.  I am a small woman with small facial features, and it is too small for me."
2.0,"This product is soft, warm, and seems to be of good quality. But. It is way too big for my head."
2.0,I only got 3 months of continuous use out of it before it broke.  Some of the previous ones I have purchased from other places have lasted over a year.
2.0,"I ordered this dress for a specific occasion. However, the dress I received was nothing like the one pictured. Though the dress I got was decent, the style wasn't flattering on me. I returned it."
2.0,Kind of cheap looking. Ended up returning. Colors/stones weren’t centered
2.0,They are comfy but I didn't think it was going to say Amy on the buttons too.  Pic doesn't match.  Heel is getting hole already wore them only 7 times.  Not for outside.
2.0,Too small... too short ... too tight. Had to give it to my sister. Looks nothing like the picture.
2.0,"Cheaply made. I got one from Venus, this is a very poor substitute"
2.0,So far I am really enjoying the leggings. I ordered a small/medium and am 155 and 5'10&#34; for reference. They are super high waisted and long enough on me which is amazing. The material is very light and comfortable. I will say when wearing darker underwear and bending over completely they are a tad see through which is hard not to be when you have a larger thighs/butt. The design and color is very vibrant and colorful. Overall very pleased<br /><br />Update: I wore the leggings 1 or 2 times and they already have a run up the butt crack and on the crotch area
2.0,runs super small ordered a large fits like a small
2.0,nice dress but runs extremely small
2.0,NEON blue!! Nice comfortable fit and real comfort material!
2.0,"Lenz are sh*t: reflecting everything from INSIDE - so you get an effect, where you barely see through this glasses, only blinks and shades"
2.0,"Huge neckline.  The fabric inflamed my son's tummy eczema EVERY TIME.  They are made in CHINA.  CHEAP PLASTIC SNAPS in the crotch that were BARELY attached at the edge, shocking they would pass these on.  The fabric was not soft as I had hoped, they have already been thrown away.  You can do better!  On a positive note I did like the colors and patterns."
2.0,It fades out in one day completely
2.0,Looks great but pinches your skin with every movement.
2.0,"I hand washed this dress and the red bled all ovee the white parts. I love the stretch, weight and fit of this dress but I am going to have to dye it to hide the red stains. Not thrilled."
2.0,Its a dull color abd it just hangs on her. It's not cute:-/
2.0,Loved the color and shirt but was too small
2.0,"Nice looking watch had to make a band adjustment and still<br />was too big. I can’t even wear it ,so I guess will make a nice<br />pocket watch.<br />-Dan"
2.0,"Received yesterday, as reviews state the colors are not at all like the pictures. Everything is way darker then the shade on the pictures. I can't tell the difference between the black and the blue. Very disappointed!!!!! Won't wear them in public. Shame on you seller, bad move. Don't buy these."
2.0,Very thin slippery cheap material
2.0,suspenders  to attah to pants
2.0,I would say just after wearing these a few times.  The fur is already no longer fluffy. There is no support to these at all. Not  that comfy. I would not recommend.
2.0,didn't like is because of the small size and the material was somewhat itchy
2.0,These are too rigid and don’t fit my face well!
2.0,Stretches out quickly
2.0,"These are cheap cotton gloves, not at all a “cashmere feel.” I am using them for my cold work office so they will work for that purpose. They are pretty thin so I wouldn’t recommend them for much else."
2.0,Not a true fit. Need to order a size or two up
2.0,"I'm 5ft 4 1/2 in tall the skirt is way to long( I wear it at the natural waist line), like 3-4 in to long at least. Normally that wouldn't bother me to much but the skirt is like a sack, no shape what so ever. And it's not flowery. So it just look like a puddle of fabric at my feet. Also you have to with zipper on the side or you'll have a seam going down the front of the skirt. It's kind of a little house on the  Prairie skirt look.<br />The tope is the same fabric and is a little better but it's also stiff, with real wide sleeves that end at an awkward elbow-ish area. It's also got a weir  bagginess around the shoulder.<br />Upside the fabric isn't itchy, and it's a beautiful, light summer pattern. I'm going to try and salvage the piece but i don't know if I can yet.<br />I was really sad when I got this, I really wanted to love this item.<br />*pictures below for reference"
2.0,Love the style very retro that’s what I was looking for but very small fitting Nd zipper broke. It’s was hard to zipped all the way not best quality of fabric
2.0,"Cute pendant, but the chain literally turned black on the part that went under my hair.  I only wore it maybe 5 times. I work in a school, so nothing crazy."
2.0,This was warm. It did not fit comfortable on my face. I used it to go outdoor ice skating in 5 degree F weather. I felt like I was eating the fabric. I could not breath through it well.  The zipper was not comfortable and the top portion of the hat was so big it looked like a cone on my head but if I pulled it down too much it bulked up around the neck.  It was not as form fitting as you see in the photo. I give it two stars though bc it was warm and if I was not doing an activity it might have been more comfortable.
2.0,Both pairs broke a few months after purchase. The blue lens worked as intended.
2.0,Good price but they r see through...
2.0,"It won’t stay in place, it gets loose if the stood is thin. For it to work, the earrings stood needs to be thicker."
2.0,"This was a very pretty shirt, but the size runs very small."
2.0,Comfortable and good size.<br />However they are NOT white. They have a pink tint.
2.0,way larger than the order size  indicates!
2.0,Purchased as a gift for spouse. She's always worn a Medium. Your Medium size is nowhere near a traditional Medium. Bottoms were at least 6 inches too long and baggy. Top large as well.
2.0,I had these pants for 5 days. I have washed and dried them one time. And the fabric in the crotch has split open. They also arrived with a hole inside the pocket. I am extremely disappointed with this product.
2.0,For 125. You’d think  they would have put in the buttons on the right .  So far two buttons have already fallen off . The leather seems good quality but if your looking for something that everything fits and long lasting. Skip this.
2.0,"It doesn't hold a regular AA token. Product is to big. Not universal, 🤥"
2.0,Color is NOTHING like in the online catalog.
2.0,"These footies are cute, they just don’t fit like the picture, they do not come up to the ankle."
2.0,"I bought this for my 21-year-old granddaughter as a Christmas gift.  However, I didn’t think it looked stylish at all.  Will return it."
2.0,Ordered black and it arrived as grey.
2.0,"I was disappointed when I saw it. It looked much nicer in the picture. it looked dull, interesting and disappointing"
2.0,"It runs super small. Too bad, it's a cute tank"
2.0,For the love of god LABEL THE BAGS PLEASE! These work well but the bags are not labeled and with the smaller sizes I had a hard time telling the differences and I tried to stretch my ears to a 10 from the 12 and mistakenly tried to put in an 8. Pain ensued until<br />I realized what what wrong. If you leave enough time as I had you shouldn't feel pain.
2.0,Cute but too small to even put a kids glasses in.
2.0,"Chinsy and flimsy little zipper bags. I thought they would hold some shape and be more box like, but they’re more just like an awkward floppy bag. I found it handy for shoes I’m the suitcase, but the other sizes are just kind of useless. I do like the idea of the dirty garment bags as well, but they’re pretty small, and all of the bags have really cheap slippers."
2.0,Fit a little small. Bottom cotton is more stuff and less soft. Probably should have returned. Overall cheap feeling.
2.0,Its beautiful until wash. Even though I wash on gentle and hang dry it looks awful after 2 washes
2.0,It has a elastic waist so it dosent look right when i wear my t shirt or tank tucked in
2.0,"This was the most painful dress ever! Left scratches and welts on my arms and so irritated. Dress was cute, but not worth the physical pain, i'm just glad I still have time to shop for another dress before my event.  I will count this as a lost..."
2.0,"They come apart easily. I’ve had to sew them so keep them together. Also if you want for htv, I don’t recommend because they burn easily. Material is shiny almost like satin."
2.0,The actual top I got is sort of like a roughly sewn together Frankenstein version of the top shown. The purple is lighter than depicted. Not a deep royal purple. Also so low cut that it shows my bra.
2.0,Band broke second time I was worn. :(
2.0,Am a 38 top and 40 bottom and so i ordered a xxl. the bottoms fit perfect but the top is alittle too small.  am disappointed i guess i will have to find something at the store because am going to the beach in a few days.  The girls are too exposed at the top so it looks alittle smaller.  i love the way it looks though.
2.0,"the shirt was a perfect match for his birthday party. on the site it says medium size 7/8 so I figured a small would be smaller than the medium, because that's logical but their size small is also a size 8, which is misleading considering a small and medium are NOT the same size so now my sons birthday shirt doesnt fit him 🤷‍♀️"
2.0,"This watch made me throw out my old expensive watch collection cuz I never wore them, including my Apple Watch. This Casio is light weight and small & unlike any other so when my battery died I immediately ordered a new one but upon opening the packaging I found a notice that I must’ve missed the first time. It read “only for California USA“ I immediately knew what it meant because these days everything has a similar warning. Is a label that serves as a warning that the product one just purchased was made using cancer causing elements.<br />Obviously I don’t have the intention of eating my watch anytime soon however like all plastic products this will soon turn to micro-plastics and we will all be consuming it.<br />Americans on average are eating about 5 grams (like a credit card) worth of micro plastics a week. It’s like a little sprinkle of cancer with every meal/sip and it’s completely unnecessary. Especially in a country that shuts down the world economy for two years over a common cold with a 99.997% survival rate. Do they really care about our health or are they just profiting from our disease? I’m sending this back and from now on will be telling time only by the positioning of our celestial bodies and reading the eyes of roaming cats."
2.0,Can not hang the lobster craw silver necklace's from them the hole is to small!! Also most pearls will not fit into these at all maybe a 4 or 5 pearl these are very pretty but not the great for pearls! So don't waste your money thinking these are cages for pearls they are not!
2.0,"Usually wear a medium, so ordered a large because reviews said they run small. The large fit a 29-30in waist roughly, and that would be snug."
2.0,"The fabric is very thin. Not what I expected, but will wear for lounging."
2.0,"Not at all like the picture. Material is thin, no real shape to it. Returning it."
2.0,"La zuela es demasiado blanda, y la talla de la orma queda más grande que la talla normal,<br />."
2.0,Links came apart after wearing for few hours
2.0,Wrong size so had to reorder
2.0,Pobre calidad. Se rompió del primer huso .
2.0,These were very small on my petite frame and started to run on the first try on.
2.0,Posts are very short! Definitely NOT for cartilage use!! I was very disappointed!!
2.0,"I really liked these slippers when I first received them. I wear my slippers daily just around the house, not outside. In less than 2 months 1 of the slippers has stretched out on the right side which has then created a hole. You can see the seem fraying in thesexind picture. Really disappointed these did not last long and the right slipper is so stretched it's no longer comfortable to wear."
2.0,"I love this design and the product's good, but I asked for size L, seeing as I have larger breasts. But they only sent the bottoms okay, and the top way too small."
2.0,"I usually wear a large or xl. I ordered an xl. The elastic band was kind of tight while the sleeves were baggy and long. The length was okay (I’m 5’7). Just barely below my ankles. Also, pretty gross, but when I tried the dress on, something fell out that looked a lot like a dried mouse dropping 🤢"
2.0,This is a beautifully designed dress but made with the most cheapest material and the side hip pockets stick out. I will probably wear it once when washed this fabric will change in shape.
2.0,"The neck hole is way too big, and the elbows are extremely tight. Terribly made."
2.0,"Not as good as the kit that comes with the hammer. You would need to buy both,  it this once just isn’t really needed."
2.0,There was no stopper for the zipper and it came right off the end. I put the zipper back on and added a stopper and it popped off again because the zipper was too loose entirely. Now it won’t fill up with air.
2.0,"This is a nice looking and fairly well made bracelet.  But, I wear an 8.5 inch bracelet with room to spare. This is so short, I cannot even get the ends to meet on my wrist. There is no way this is 8.66 inches long. I will give it away, as returning it is always too much of a hassle. This is the second piece of jewlery I have purchased that used Chinese inches for measurment....if in doubt, don't purchase it here!"
2.0,"Shipping was quick....Item is cute but not exactly like the picture....the width of the head band is about 1/4&#34; and the crochet flower is about 2&#34; if that.  In the listing picture, the flower covers the entire diaper cover and the actual product the flower is about 2 1/2&#34; all you see it white diaper cover and a very small flower.  Although, cute, I'm not satisfied.  I'm pretty crafty so a trip to hobby lobby, and I'll add to the outfit to get the use that I had wanted."
2.0,These gloves are nice looking but they are not warm. If you want warmth don't buy these.
2.0,"The RED version description is misleading - the red jersey is bright ORANGE.  The jersey also had massive MYNEKO logos on the sides and back not shown in photos.  Selected this design largely because of it's discreet branding but received a MYNEKO billboard instead.  The bib shorts also had giant MYNEKO logos on the sides and back not shown in the red-version product photos.<br /><br />For the price, the quality was pretty good.  Seemed like the jersey zipper might be the first thing to fail but overall seemed to be a decent summer kit.  Too bad the color and design descriptions/photos are so far off, wanted to keep it."
2.0,"The sound is decent, but the speakers are not secured inside that hat at all. They slide around and it is just awkward to use and highly inconvenient."
2.0,Not ass its look like
2.0,Colored rings start peeling within a day and you end up with a silver band.
2.0,if you are wide in hips size up! very cute but tight in bust and hips.
2.0,"I purchased this as a Christmas present for my wife. It was delivered in a timely fashion. But after 4 weeks of wearing it the ""I Love You"" has completely worn off and every link is dented. My wife has 3 or 4 other bracelets on her wrist where she also wore this bracelet.  None of the other bracelets have suffered any damage and they are 1 to 3 years of age. I am very unhappy with this product and would counsel anyone interested in it to look elsewhere."
2.0,"Its beautiful, but is too big. It looked really weird on my nose."
2.0,Good quality but the decoration pattern is hardly can be seen. The photo is misleading.
2.0,I didn't expect it to be as wide as it was.  I figured it would be the same all the live strong bands. NOPE. Wider than that so I wont be wearing it.
2.0,"I used this for my athletic shoes, I only wear them occasionally, still after about 2 weeks use the end tab came off.  This makes the tie unusable. Save your money."
2.0,"For $21, I expected a T-shirt that will last a few years.  This shirt is made in Bangladesh and is thin enough to see daylight through both layers. The size runs small - I normally wear Large and ordered an XL based on the other reviews.  Fit is OK, so evidently I'm Extra Large in Bangladesh.  I'll probably keep the shirt, since I like the message and true heavyweight T-shirts are almost impossible to find on Amazon."
2.0,Not a protective mask. Some kind of decoration. Definitely not 2020 compatible
2.0,It looks much cheaper than the photo depicts.
2.0,"The rise of these pants is way too long. I will be returning them. I did like the fabric and style, so am disappointed with the sizing issue in this line."
2.0,THESE BRIEF ARE UNCOMFORTABLE AND POORLY MADE.  FIT POORLY
2.0,"Effect is the same as others I've bought but quality is poor.  Elastic breaks after a 6-8 weeks.  Five star for effectiveness, two star for quality."
2.0,"The band was great and I loved it until it broke because it's glued into a slot and not secure at all. If you pull on it , it will come out and not be of use anymore. I used this on my garmin vivoactive 4s."
2.0,"The material was so, so & the chart sizing was not accurate.  I felt that the sizes were one size smaller."
2.0,"Good fitting pants, but stitching started coming apart after the 2nd use."
2.0,"Not worth the money. After washing it one time, a thread pulled out and has a line through the shirt where its too obvious to wear. Also see through"
2.0,"Original description said it was a womans dress, after it goes in your cart, it changes to teen. DEFINITELY TEEN SIZE!!! SUPER SMALL!!!! If it were the proper size it would be adorable."
2.0,Will send back..very tight and impossible to put on. May work for others who have a narrow foot though !
2.0,Over all nice pendant and chain but the glass stone was full of scratches!!! If I can get the stone out and replace it with another one I will be okay with it.
2.0,I had a band like this for my fitbit and loved it but it didn’t work well with apple watch- it would stay at the tightness I wanted
2.0,Serves its purpose. There are better ones out there.
2.0,A little small I would like a larger one
2.0,"The waist on the pants is ridiculously long while the pant legs are pretty short proportionately. My husband is 5’11” and the waist goes up to his chest, and the pants are high water. The scoop neck is ridiculously low.  The fabric feels fabulous, but I wish we could find something with more average proportions and a crew neck in rayon knit."
2.0,"When you close the buckle it would not sit on my wrist flattened. A portion of the buckle, where it connects to the leather would be lifted upward from the tension. Overall, the quality is not good; however, I should of figured this given the low cost. I did not like this product and for the above reason returned it. The seller was great and issued me a refund."
2.0,Looks cheap and is way too big engraveing is good.
2.0,"Very cute and great size but, after I showered, it changed color."
2.0,"They are black and ugly, not silver at all!"
2.0,A very sexy set of panties but they run extremely small. Beware.
2.0,"I was disappointed the heart was so large... I was expecting a daintyer sized piece. It is larger than a quarter unfortunately. The tip at the bottom of the heart is very sharp and pointy so it becomes uncomfortable also.Although, it was a valentines gift so I wear it frequently  despite the large size."
2.0,"Item was delivered as promised, but looked far more feminine when wearing it than it does in the picture. I ended up giving them to my wife."
2.0,"Super thin, runs small and the leopard print looks pretty cheezy...like dollar store print. It doesn't look like the picture. I can wear a medium in most of these style dresses with room to spare, but the large was too small. I returned it."
2.0,I would have liked them to be smaller!
2.0,I hate the slippery synthetic fabric. I will not order this again.
2.0,The waist band was too small and tight.
2.0,This are what you pay for very small for me gave them to my little nephew (6 years) to play with.
2.0,This ring really is beautiful but I have had it barely a day and it already bent and no longer a circle
2.0,"I really like how they looked with my shoes and how they did not slip off. However, one of the pairs developed a giant hole in the big toe area after the first use. 🤔 Not okay at all."
2.0,The quality isn’t great. Some of the stuff is cute.
2.0,"acctually its nice, but not worth the price"
2.0,"The back of the dress was very different then in the picture. I ordered based on the measurements for my size but the dress didn’t fit well. Although it said (free returns) I paid for shipping both ways to get the refund, I wouldn’t do it again."
2.0,"Stingy on the room and flow of the cut. Arms were tight and the elastic was cheap. The dress have potential but not exactly what I expected. Somewhat disappointed, but will keep it"
2.0,"It came out wonky af 🤣 the print is so bad, you can see the pixels like it was enlarged more than it could go if that makes sense🥴"
2.0,The size was not right. Sent as a set and size incorrect.
2.0,Nice initial fit and feel. Disintegrated within 6 months.
2.0,"Disappointed in this tank. First the material, some ppl state this as a plus but to me just feels like cheap material. I've bought shirts and tanks like these at swap meets for like 4 for 10 bucks so the price is not justifies in my opinion. I'm a sweater so sweat soaks through this things easily to where I looked drenched in just a few sets. I'm 6'2"", and this thing feels a bit short it could have been given at least 2in of additional length. I got and XL btw so I can be loose and longer but I was wrong, it's slightly tighter than expected and runs short. I don't like the little slit that on both sides of the shirt. Since the material is so thin I ended up ripping the shirt on the slit after 1st use. A plus is that it is super soft."
2.0,It’s quite shapeless. I took a pick to show the jade color. And the shoddy stitching.  I actually considered getting a zipper put in and having it nipped in at the waist but too much efforts for the cheap material. It’s scratchy. I’m 5’3” snd 105# snd felt like Goldie hawn trying on her clothes in “overboard”. Not even cute babydoll shaped. Just blah. Returning.
2.0,"Sending this back, unfortunately. The material is not good."
2.0,"I loved the necklace. It's just as pictured and beautiful upon receipt. However, I had only worn it once and then stored it in my jewelry box until I was ready to wear it again about a month or so later. It is now completely tarnished just from sitting so much so that the metal on charm no longer matches the chain. Really disappointed with the quality on such a beautiful necklace."
2.0,"The ring itself is cute and not long which is exactly what I was looking for. It’s also great for sensitive skin, not bothersome at all there. Unfortunately after wearing it for a week, the top ball has come off by itself and gotten lost. I would have given it 5 stars otherwise. If the company is willing to replace the ring, I will update my review."
2.0,The grey/black print is very washed out looking.  There are several flaws in the fabric and what appear to be blemishes or bleach marks.  Not impressed.
2.0,"They're cool I guess, I wasn't too fond of them."
2.0,"A few issues with this wallet<br /><br />First - I know it's inexpensive, but the quality is lacking. It didn't last a month before the glue that holds the outline of the wallet started to come apart.  Shortly after, the seams started separating and it quickly became an unusable item<br /><br />Second - it's absurdly large.  I mean it's literally 50% larger by bi-fold area than my other bi-fold wallets.<br /><br />Third - There are no side slide pockets for extra cards.  This means that, despite the massive shape of this wallet, you'll be limited to holding 6-8 cards..  If you're like me and you have an ID, 3-4 credit cards, a few gift cards, Insurance cards + HSA account, business cards.. this wallet won't suit your needs<br /><br />The only positive I can think of is that the inside looks nice"
2.0,Fair price but the eye holes could have been alot bigger.
2.0,Too tight.  Too long
2.0,"I ordered XL according to the size charts given.  I couldn't get it on.  The picture depicts probably a super small leg in an XL sleeve because as soon as you stretch it, the colors do NOT look like that.  It looks stretched out, pulled, just not at all what it should be.  Very deceiving image."
2.0,"I wanted to like this shirt so bad, and I’m annoyed I waited SO long for it and it’s humongous. Like not flattering at all even for winter and that oversized look. I’m 5’4” 135lbs for reference and ordered a Small. I would need an XS or XXS to fit into this tent."
2.0,"For some reason it won't let me add a picture to my review to show proof, but what I recieved in the mail is NOT what I ordered from you. Completely different style of glasses I wanted. I specifically ordered:<br />® Retro Vintage Fashion Unisex Round Arrow Style Metal Frame Sunglasses Eyewear<br /><br />& instead got a Wayfarer type design. They are not just circles like the picture portrays."
2.0,the little jewels get caught and mine ripped in several places
2.0,Super cute but the &#34;silver wore off&#34; I thought this was solid silver - I guess not
2.0,This band runs a bit small. The band is cute but short /smaller then any watch band I have seen.
2.0,I was going to return it as I am a large extra large. 7 5/8 to 8in head. But ended up giving it to my girlfriend.. couldn't believe the price and great expedited shipping. But still a great hat
2.0,I love Clarks. I have several pairs. I bought my regular size. These ran very large so I had to return them.
2.0,Seams comming apart
2.0,Disappointed in this product.  Thin material.  I would not recommend.
2.0,The clasp is not secure and they bend easily so be careful. I damaged 2 out of 3 before even getting to wear them.
2.0,"The shorts are certainly comfy and I bought them because they have pockets. I have a few pajama pants/shorts with pockets and without. In the age of cellphones, a pocket is a very nice thing to have.  The drawstring on these shorts is the worst I've ever dealt with. It's cheap and whenever I tie up the string, I hear strands ripping and breaking. The weight of my cellphone (which is not much) pulls the shorts off of me.  Untie, re-tie (Rrrrip sounds) and get it to a comfortable tightness. Within a few minutes, the cheap drawstring as failed enough that the shorts are dropping again.  :("
2.0,Design did not look as nice as pictures
2.0,No cheap made
2.0,"They looked sharp when they arrived, but they didn’t last long at all. The sole wore at an insanely fast rate (pictured is roughly a month of wear). Further, the fabric unraveled and shoelace rivets came loose. Also, insoles pealed out almost immediately after first wear, and they stained with almost anything that contacted the fabric. After just over a month they were basically unwearable. Basically - they fall apart very fast. They were not quality. Did not last."
2.0,"My dog is small but this ran small , definitely size up ! It’s good quality though , just wish it fit"
2.0,"This suit is adorable, but the problem is with the leg openings.  I ordered a large based on other reviews.  (5'2&#34;, 127 lbs).  The waist is too loose, but the leg openings dig in.  Disappointed."
2.0,Very tight. I ordered an 11 and they are tight. Hoping they stretch out some.
2.0,Wear an XL/XXL. Ordered the XL & it was way too small. Had a friend who wears a M/Lg try it on & barely fit & not flattering.<br />Soft material though.
2.0,"When you wash it, it gets little cotton balls all over."
2.0,"It is a cute swimsuit, but not at all like the ones in other pictures.  The one that I resented is just about a lime green.....not an Olive green like described and pictures.  Other than the color being wrong, the swimsuit is comfortable so far."
2.0,"I'm a super short and thin person for starters, but this top makes me look very large. It's not flattering AT ALL. It's also very short waisted (not a crop top, but a few inches longer). I think this is probably why it makes you look chubby cause it's so short (and im 5&#34;0ft). Just no. Don't waste your money."
2.0,Beautiful and comfortable but fell to pieces. Buckle fell off and then screws in attachment. This has never happened with any other brand. I’m never getting a strap again which relies on screws in the watch attachment. Returning today. Thank heavens for Prime.
2.0,The sleep cap won’t even stay on at night.
2.0,Watch stopped working after a few months 🤨
2.0,"Returned, had a hole near the armpit."
2.0,"Based on company size chart I ordered an XL, but it is WAY too small. Absolutely no way the top can be buttoned with a 6""-8"" gap. Otherwise dress seems nice."
2.0,Advertised as a men's jacket obviously is a woman's zips on the left
2.0,Just not like picture
2.0,"Very snug around the legs. Button is velcro closure, not a button or snap.  Pockets are ok but hard to use with how tight the shorts are. They are also elastic in the back of the waist which has its own cost and benefits. In general  somewhat uncomfortable. Would not recommend."
2.0,Great for winter... not for a tropical environment like Florida. Well made. Lovely print of the castle!
2.0,"These lenses cost about a third less than the brand I usually buy, which makes sense because they fit about a third more poorly. One lens is loose in the frame. Both lenses are strained where some salt water pooled in the corner during an afternoon of boating."
2.0,These gloves are stuck together in a big brick.  Difficult to separate and difficult to put on hand.  Must blow them up to separate and then put on.
2.0,"The amazon description for these belts is that they are genuine bison leather and that they are made in the USA.  These are not full grain bison leather and they are made in China.  I purchased full grain bison leather belts made in the USA on amazon several years ago that cost $50.  They were genuine full grain bison leather and they were worth $50.  These belts being sold on amazon today are made in China counterfeit products.  Are they worth the $30 being charged on amazon ? Perhaps, but amazon needs to correct the product description to reflect the split grain leather and the made in China origin of the belts Also, these belts are two inches shorter than the genuine bison leather Made in USA belts that I purchased on amazon several years ago. You need to upsize your order by two inches if you order these belts."
2.0,Super cute. But the size is way to small.
2.0,"These looks very cute, however the quality is very poor. The magnet parts of the band began to come loose and fall out after a few weeks. I had to super glue them back in to stay and they just don't sit in there correctly now (you can tell when Im wearing it but...sort of a pain). The magnet is very strong and stays on well once in place tho and I don't worry about the watch falling off. The color of the band is also now scratching off in the area where the band feeds through the hole. Overall was disappointed :("
2.0,"Bought this for a party.  A handful did not work from the start.  Others worked for a little while and quickly broke.  Luckily, I had extra and could give the kids another.  I would not recommend these.  They were a little too cheap."
2.0,"A little disappointed in the charm. The mechanism that keeps the cube closed is loose, so the cube has a gap between the two sides. And the glow in the dark bead inside is incredibly small. Maybe the size of a very small pea. So you don't get the full glow effect as shown in the pictures. Very happy with the look of the cube, very ethereal looking. Just wish it was a little better made and the glow in the dark element filled the space inside not just a tiny bead."
2.0,Too small to notice they are kitties.
2.0,"I wasn't super impressed when the dress came. Another review I had read said they ran a little big, but it was much larger than I had expected. The lace isn't attached to the rest of the top, so it wouldn't hold the top up which is quite a problem. It wasn't as elegant as it seemed in the picture.  I returned the item cause it just didn't fit me like i wanted it to, although with the free return it made it super easy and straight forward to do so."
2.0,could of been made a little better gave one as a gift they took it out of package to see the clasp was missing I was embaressed!!
2.0,the tie in the front was placed in the back to the pockets are on the opposite side . so..
2.0,The lenses of these sunglasses are much too narrow to provide good all around sun protection for outdoor activities. Perhaps for kids.
2.0,"I ordered this skirt in a size I can usually walk in to almost any store and pick up from the shelves and it will fit; however, this product was way too small! I'm not one to get hung up on what size something is, but I would have had to go up probably at least 2 sizes to get this to fit."
2.0,Glitter sheds everywhere. Not safe for baby
2.0,"I purchased the dozen pack and expected them to be (about) the same size. Out of the 12 - 4 fit my hand, the others I gave to my niece who is 7 years old. (very small hand and wrist)"
2.0,The smallest ones were fine. Middle size there were a few of the crystals not straight. But all the large ones are no good. The crystals are on crooked on some. Some the crystal is not sitting flat. Some the crystals were already fallen off
2.0,"The lining of this case popped out of place when I opened it to place the sunglasses inside. My husband had to glue it down with Gorilla glue. Other than that, good for the price."
2.0,Zipper broke 1sy week.  Spend more to get better quality
2.0,Tail is very heavy. Ears are so close together it looks like a bow.
2.0,Didn't like them.
2.0,VERY small bag. My fault for not checking the dimensions. The color is blotchy (see photo). Not impressed. Deciding whether to return it or give to my 12 year old. Not worth $120.
2.0,"Way too small to put any picture in it. It’s cute for what you paid for. My 7 yrs old loved it, regardless of having a picture in it or not."
2.0,"Is cute, but made with cheap materials, so it won't last. I had it for couple of months now and I had to fix it two times, until today because now is really broken. So I threw it away :/"
2.0,Regarding the fit....... are you serious? Ordered plus size for 3x. My size 6 daughter is going to wear it.
2.0,Lace does not match the fabric. Instead of sending back cut off and hemmed it. Will not buy again
2.0,"Okay, very old fashioned"
2.0,"I loved this ring, but the rose fell off at some point the first day I wore it. I have similar spinner rings that are holding up much better. I’m really disappointed because this ring looked awesome."
2.0,"I love this dress, although I would need to put softener on it. Tight in places you wouldn’t expect. Order a size two times larger, maybe it’ll fit"
2.0,I dislike that the shirt was a crop top.
2.0,"cute, but fell apart"
2.0,I was given two pairs of green shorts instead of a green one and blue one. Very disappointed.
2.0,"These are okay earrings, I would save your money and buy a better quality product. I have never had irritation problems for the last 35 years but with these I did."
2.0,Thinness
2.0,"The little screws fell out of BOTH pair!  I wore the 1st pair twice before it happened, the  screw fell out of the second pair when I was taking them out of the cloth bag.The screw/post, doesn’t have threads on it.  Which meant you couldn’t screw it back into place or replace it w/another screw from an eye glass repair kit.  I was so really looking forward to wearing these sunglasses.  I really loved the shape, size & gradient tint of the lenses. They were exactly what I was looking for just really poor quality. I do not recommend anyone purchase them until they fix the quality."
2.0,"This beanie looked like exactly what I was looking for, but this beanie is not fully lined with the fleece insulation, instead only having a headband of lining that doesn't even go halfway up into the full hat. My daughter wanted it, which is the only reason I'm not returning this. Please be more upfront with your advertising."
2.0,Too small<br />I have an adult co worker who loves cows but this product is way too small. It would be perfect for a small child.
2.0,Way too tight in the rib cage area and two buttons fell off. Cheap material but super cute design
2.0,I bought the dark green camo. Very thin fabric with a white inside color. Any sort of stretch and you could see the white sheen coming from underneath. Returned.
2.0,"It basically fit correctly, but the cut is skimpy and it simply looks tacky.  Perfect example of &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;.  It was returned."
2.0,"I bought these for work since I am constantly shifting my focus from less than eighteen inches to about three feet or so. These glasses seemed like the perfect option short of getting prescription lenses. The right lens seems to be pretty clear with fairly low distortion at the edges. However, the left lens is only usable in the center. the outside third of the lens is blurry. I have had several other co-workers try the glasses on to confirm that it is not just an effect of my particular eyes. This problem does not make them totally unusable, but it does limit their usefulness.<br />Additionally, they are extremely light weight. The flexibility an looseness of the temples feel like something you might find on disposable glasses. If you were to sneeze while wearing them there is a good chance that they would simply fly off your head. That being said. They are pretty comfortable to wear if you aren't too active.<br />I'll try them out for a little while longer before I decide whether or not to return them."
2.0,"I was specifically looking for a scarf that measured 80 x 30 to wear as a wrap over a sleeveless dress at a summer wedding.  In reality, the scarf only measured 70 x 28.  I did not think it was appropriate to count the fringe in the measurement."
2.0,"They look nice, but once you feel them and the plastic glory, it’s all downhill"
2.0,Faded in color. Appears stretched out and worn. The neck is very large. Not a good purchase.
2.0,was not expecting the nose piece to bend in towards my nose. Seems to me it's should be made the exact opposite of how it's put together.
2.0,"Cheap material, but you get what you pay for right? Doesn't zip up all the way, maybe my calves are too big? Does keep my shoes dry though"
2.0,The zipper broke within 2 weeks. I was able to get a partial refund and there company was very helpful but I really liked these boots and wanted them to last much longer
2.0,These jeans are not stretchy at all. The zipper also broke the first day I wore them.
2.0,"Runs small, for a size 9. Unusable for me, gave it to my son. 2 star cause of fitting issue. If it was a bit bigger, it woild be 5 stars. Very comfortable to walk and feel around the feet."
2.0,so the quality is nice however it is super short waisted and i'm already short and it barely goes over my boobs (36D) and i'm 5'2. the cups wouldn't reach where they are supposed to. The bag is not cheeky it is a legit thong :/  i ordered the lg but could maybe do the XL if i decide to reorder
2.0,Fits very awkwardly. Way too large and I’m not sure I’ll get any wear out of it.
2.0,This was my second time getting this suit for my wife. She usually wears a medium and that is what I ordered the first time. The fabric has a smooth hand and feels like it would be very comfortable to wear. The size was way too small. It was returned and exchanged for a large. The large may have been mislabeled but seems to be the same size as the medium and the packaging made me feel that it was a return from another costumer. I will be returning the very small large and try to find something from a different manufacturer.
2.0,the bust was ok but the rest of it swings .im big busted with small bottom
2.0,Do not know how they will hold up. Do not look like cats. Wore to work & everyone thought they were lemurs. Not quite the visual appeal that was sought. Pretty colors.
2.0,"This Multicam tactical Camo Trucker Cap with American Flag (subdued) could be an excellent product. However, unlike most Trucker Caps ... this one is way undersized. It fits like a young boys hat ... and I have it set on the last (largest) setting. I was really disappointed because of the piss poor fit and what I had been expecting. If I had a little boys head on top of my old Veterans body, it would be great but I don't. What a waste for what would have been an excellent hat if only the company had purchased a better sized hat."
2.0,"It looks very cheap, not as expected. I understand it was less expensive than others but it just didn't make it to the Birthday Basket."
2.0,It fit fine but I think my breasts were too heavy for it because the underwire leaned out in the center. I wear it to bed sometimes or to lounge around the house but definitely not supportive enough for working out
2.0,It's It's poor quality it's weak
2.0,"I really didn't like the dress at all, it was way too large and the collar was black. It wasn't what I expected at all. I'm going to send it back but everything else from Amazon I love!!"
2.0,This was too small and it gapes open in the front. I think you would need to sew it closed. The arm ties are awkward too.
2.0,"This dress has so much potential! I am between a medium and a small, so I ordered in a medium. The material was so thin, you could see my tattoo on my side through the dress. You could also see every bra and underwear line."
2.0,Found them very hard on my knees. I don't wear them.
2.0,"It was bought as a gift for someone else, but I had considered ordering one for myself. I tried it on and it is way too short on me. Hopefully it'll fit the other person better. I'm ordering them something else because I doubt it'll work for them.<br /><br />Fast shipping though! And included a free necklace."
2.0,1st time when I order the order didnt arrived and I had to re-order my saree again (which is a harassment).<br />2nd the material of the saree is cheap and smells terrible.<br />3rd the so called diamonds are all glued and few of the pics aren't there..eventually they all will disappear.<br />The only good part of the saree is design which is pretty and the color is nice but after wash I am assuming we won't be able to wear.For 1-2 times we can wear it.<br />4th its highly overpriced
2.0,Very wide size
2.0,"The sellers advertise that this sunglass case is made of leather and it simply is not. However, this should have been evident in the price, it is still concerning that they are still basically lying in their advertising. Otherwise, has been holding up well protecting my shades."
2.0,"I love the look of this dress but the first time I tried it on the zipper broke! The fit was perfect so it wasn’t like I was fighting to zip it up...the zipper is just really cheap and flimsy. I want to replace it but I’m a little concerned that it will happen again. For reference I’m 5’10” and 155 lbs, 36B bust and the medium fit perfectly. I also ordered a large just in case- especially if the dress was too short on me in the medium. The large was definitely way too big and the medium length actually went to just above my kneecaps. Broken zipper aside I would have kept it. So sad I have to return it! :("
2.0,"I like the tie dye, but the fabric is very thin and the dress is unusually short (and I'm only 5' 2"").  I will keep it for a swimsuit cover but this is not something you would want to wear out in public unless you are throwing it over something else."
2.0,"These must be Asian sizes I ordered an XL & couldn’t get 1 leg in them. The material felt strange, extremely thin & sheer, but not soft against the skin."
2.0,i was really hopping these were going to work great but they did not because they are too short. i don't ware long socks and i did not want the ones that go on your heel.  otherwise the are made of good quality just wish they would be longer... :(  Steve
2.0,"I can't believe people are giving this 5 stars.  I think those reviews are suspect.  This sweatshirt is awful. First of all, the printing was off center. Second, it's shaped like a box!  Sure you can slide it down over your shoulder and as long as you keep your arm bent, it looks great.  If you put your arms down, the shoulder seams stick up. It's not meant to be worn the way it's shown.  It was defective!!  See my pics.  don't let this happen to you.  I'm 5'6&#34;, 130 and normally wear a small.  I wanted a slouchy fit, but this is awful.  Also, the bottom band is really tight, so it looks even more ridiculous.<br /><br />edited to state that my cost and shipping were refunded without any problem."
2.0,It's cute but the clasp broke on both as soon as I tried it on. Disappointed.
2.0,"This shirt is cute, I received many compliments when wearing it. HOWEVER- when I washed it (in cold water, in a garment bag, gently), the fringe dye bled, and changed the fringe color from yellow to a terrible green color. The dye also RUINED  the other clothes I washed with it."
2.0,this item was just a ball of material.had so many problems just to get it on.could not even get to wear it once.so people don't waste your time or money.
2.0,It's really pretty but it keeps falling apart that's what didn't like about it.
2.0,Stockings won't stay up and much shorter than it appears on the model  the furthest it got was above my knee and I'm only 5&#34; 5 but i think i have an idea how to make it work..wouldn't purchase again though
2.0,"Meh, use a butter knife"
2.0,did not care for the fabric
2.0,"The length was not as advertised, did not sit at ankles, more below knee.  Material is nice."
2.0,The cut was off and not as described. Poor fit. 😣
2.0,"Size up. Actual fit is a bit smaller. Material not the best quality. Because I have another one, but in a different color, I made the mistake of washing it before I wore it. Wished I tried it on first. Material feels different than the other one I have."
2.0,The photo makes it seem like the zip up is long when indeed it is not. It fits small. So i suggest to anyone to order one size bigger than what you actually wear. Other than that i like it. But i just bought it to pair with some leggings and a tank top. It is not a thoroughly warm zip up either.
2.0,"Very very small...hard to get backs on..all in all a bad decision..but have no problem with the seller, other items I have ordered were great."
2.0,I did not receive ear plugs or nose clip
2.0,"I got the size that is supposed to be for 8-9 year olds because my six year old usually wears 8 year old clothes from most mainstream manufacturers (Cat and Jack, etc.). The length here is short, but the width is extreme. The dress almost looks square. It will fit her, but the skirt will be way too short, and the top will be like a circus tent. Maybe we got a one off, since others say this fits as expected? But we will have a hard time finding a chance to wear this because of the combination of mismeasurements.<br /><br />Which is a pity. The colors are pretty, the fabric is very soft, and the picture is sweet. But ultimately we can't really wear it because the fit is just so bad."
2.0,I missed the &#34;hair bands&#34; part and thought I was buying Head bands.  They are nice but would not have paid this much for hair bands had I realized it.
2.0,"Just know that while the tank top might fit in your correct size, the shorts are so tiny, they wouldn't fit a doll! I am a small person, so was shocked at how small the shorts are. Ended up tossing them out, as not worth the effort to return. I will say that the fabric is super soft."
2.0,"No yatzee here. The material is super  thin, EXTREMELY CHEAP, no pattern and gumball machine cufflinks.<br />Not even worth the wage paid to the third world employees who make it.<br />To reiterate: SOOOOOOoooo cheap!"
2.0,Won't fit on ear.
2.0,"This was waaay long! Also, didn't flow as much as it shows it in pictures. I returned it- just not what I thought it was-"
2.0,"This is more of a dark lavender, not plum as in the picture. Was looking for the color in the picture. Otherwise it fit fine but just felt and looked cheap because of the color."
2.0,This dress is soooooo short.  It barely covered by butt.  I’m 5’ and ordered the small and there is no way you could wear this out in public.  It literally stopped at the bottom of my cheeks.
2.0,"It will do for what I needed, but thin more like for a child."
2.0,"An extra large is too small for me. I am 5'11"" and 200 pounds, and I do work out. However, I don't have the huge arms of bodybuilders on steroids, and the sleeves are too tight, as is the chest and shoulders.  Ordinarily an extra large is fine. And the hood doesn't come far enough forward to wear a cap  underneath and be protected from wind and rain."
2.0,The material was almost see through and the print was almost pixelated.... just not what I was expecting.
2.0,I'm wondering about all these fantastic reviews. These are the cheapest feeling glasses I can recall trying on. They are even cheaper feeling than the ones you buy at a truck stop after you accidentally sit on your expensive pair. I would have rated these a 3 if they were only $5. Not sure what all the raving is about.
2.0,The size is not good. I buy in XL size that is  small and fits like Large in size. I think i need to buy a size larger.<br />The Quality and stitching is just fine.
2.0,Was really impressed with the item but already broke within a month of use. I am passed the return window with Amazon to either replace or order another type but disappointed.
2.0,I loved it but sadly the dangly feet kept falling off. The last time it fell off i havent been able to locate them.
2.0,The first time I wore these the inside lining comes out in small pieces. It happens every time I wear them and I haven’t even washed them yet!
2.0,"When I first put these on I lived them! They fit perfect, not too tight not too loose. However, after a day of wearing them the seam in the croch area ripped. Needless to say I was highly disappointed in that."
2.0,I was disappointed in the quality of the robes. On both robes one of the belt loops just came off before even washing them. The stitching seemed faulty.
2.0,"These glasses seem solidly built and look good, but the lenses are definitely not polarized as described in the product name.  An easy way to tell is to rotate your phone screen while wearing the glasses.  If they are polarized, your screen will dim as your phone rotates. I'm disappointed as I was specifically looking for something polarized, but I guess I was silly to think I could get something polarized for this cheap."
2.0,"They are pretty earings, I bought 3 sets for my bridemaids but one set doesn't latch into its hope at all. Will have to return."
2.0,Great blank sweatshirt. But it instantly started pilling like crazy!
2.0,"they keep falling off, cute to look at but I lost most by them falling off"
2.0,After i washed it once i found a small hole in the left shoulder blade area. Very disappointed!
2.0,"Super soft and comfortable, but dont expect to wear it open, the pockets dont exist except on the inside, and the zipper start is surrounded by an easily frayed fabric that will no doubt make it impossible to zip up after a few washes."
2.0,"For the price, just what I expected. I would not wear this in public, but it is fine for at home comfort. Fabric is very thin and cheap."
2.0,"I just did not like this coverup. I got a large thinking that it would cover me up really well. Nope. It was so small! The picture of the coral/brown is very deceptive - it felt very cheap, very sheer and did not flow, like on the model pictured. It was also midi/knee length, not maxi length, like the picture also implied. I'm 5'8, size 10, so a large is usually a generous size for me. This missed the mark on my expectations. The 2 stars is for the pretty print."
2.0,Very cheap looking.  Gave to my niece for dressup.
2.0,"I donated this dress.  It looked super FRUMPY and way too conservative on my voluptuous,  full-size body."
2.0,"It won't fully close, I moved my card and I'd, a couple of bill, some coins from a smaller wallet and the clasp can't reach to close, it bulks! not too happy!! Hopefully it will expand and fit properly over time!"
2.0,Needed a specific shade of green and the picture looked perfect. I was sent a dark teal skirt instead. Also it was just a bit on the tight side. I’m 5”5 180lbs. So I’m a large or size 12 pants. If your bigger than that I’d pass.
2.0,Rough material and the flowers look cheap and are poorly sowed on. I regret this purchase
2.0,After one delicate wash there are stings coming out from all over and lines are all over it now. It was my favortie pull over too!
2.0,the earrings are too small even the largest was small
2.0,It is see thru you can see your bra underwear and belly button
2.0,Most of the legs are already broken in a way that is not fixable …poor construction
2.0,"This dress is shown with short sleeves that are a bit longer and fitted around the arms, which is why I ordered it.... that is not the sleeves that this dress actually has.... barely has any sleeves thay are SO short.... not flattering on thick arms or flabby arms.  That is why I was searching for longer and fitted sleeves! 😫 Plus, dress smells of steong chemical.  Pass.  Keep searching."
2.0,"Beautiful blouse, but sizing of this blouse is incorrect.  They're xxl is more like a size medium."
2.0,"These earrings are very stylish and pretty Unfortunately! Unfortunately, each earring came with both bent and broken posts. I tried gluing them back together because there were no more of the desired colors in stock. They're also a little heavy for cosmetic jewelry. ETA: I wore them twice and my right ear became irritated and swollen. :-("
2.0,"This is very cute but I wore it outside at the beach, didn't even get it wet, and it turned bronze/green."
2.0,"First off, I was very excited to purchase this dress and when I got it’s delivered today I was excited until I saw the packaging. The packaging is terrible!!! I was very disappointed in the packaging. Just packed it in a PAPER envelope and stuffed the dress in a small clear plastic bag. Even thuo the dress didn’t not fit me I love the material it’s was heavy enough to endure through winter the length of the dress is amazing. But the packaging you guys have to do better. I have to return this in VERY DISAPPOINTED!!"
2.0,"I'm a size 7-1/4 to 7-3/8. That usually translates to a Large. I ordered the Large and it's WAY WAY too big. It sinks down to my eyebrows! I look like a 10 year old trying his dad's hat on. Also, when I bought this, it was advertised as a Bucket hat. This is not a bucket; it's a porkpie. Not my style. You may like porkpies. My wife hates them on me and I'm not crazy about them either. The brim is stiff on this one, and it arrived shaped like a porkpie. Technically, you can snap the brim down like a bucket; however, the brim will look rippled and wrinkled when you do that. So this hat is intended to be a porkpie. Finally, I've seen various photos of this hat that led me to believe the band was navy blue and light blue. It's not. The band is black and teal. I have some light blue clothes, but I don't have any teal colored clothing, and to be blunt, I don't find that being a common color for men's clothing. There may be some men who wear teal, but don't see that very often. Perhaps this was intended to be a women's hat and I misunderstood the listing? I wish they'd have made the hat band of light blue and navy blue. Seems like those colors would blend with a greater variety of clothes.<br />Not my style, not my color. This one's a loser for me. I'm returning it."
2.0,Is a lot bigger than it looks in the picture. I was expecting it to be dainty not regularly sized.  I'm disappointed.
2.0,"Pros always first<br />Lightweight, does protect you from the Sun, keeps you cool as advertised.<br />Cons<br />Sticks to your body<br />Hugs your unwanted curbs for us later folk lol<br />Does snag very easy. Don't get it caught on anything.<br />Update 2 washes later.<br />Falling apart , thread is unstitching<br />Neck is way too open , sun is burning my neck all around .<br />No tags? Hmmm, are these rejects from other vendors ? Smh"
2.0,"Seller states large size fits wrists up to 10.3"".  I ordered a large and it doesn't fit my 9.5"" wrist"
2.0,Lasted about a year.  :(  medium use.
2.0,Material is very thin a cheap
2.0,These run small.. order a size up!
2.0,"The bra fits great on the ribs, but the bust/ arms are super loose."
2.0,No support. Fine for wearing under sweatshirts.
2.0,"The &#34;bow&#34; part is not attached, just slid into the middle part.  My child pulled it out accidentally while trying to straighten it in about 5 minutes.  Bummer!!"
2.0,The ankle is really small on these shoes. The velcro strip on the ankle strap isn't long enough to make the ankle bigger. The ankle strap keeps flapping open whenever my daughter walks around longer than 10mins.  I love the look of the shoe. They seem to fit nicely everywhere else.
2.0,"Bought a small, still way too big"
2.0,"i bought my Ginger Snaps watch from a local gift shop, and I was immediately in love with it. I wore it for about 3 months to work (I'm a teacher so no hard labor on my wrists), and got many compliments on it. Unfortunately, I ended up heart-broken when the mesh strap broke from the end cap. There is a tiny piece of the mesh still attached in the cap, but I have no way to fix it. It also makes me Leary to buy any other products that have them mesh on them. I hope they get this fixed."
2.0,"The quality of the dress FEELS good, but doesn’t LOOK good. The top and skirt are two different greens. The fit is good for the most part, but there is no zipper anywhere on the dress as stated in the description. I thought I found the perfect dress for my husbands company Christmas party, but it fell short."
2.0,Not well designed.
2.0,"I was so bummed when I put I this dress, because I wanted it to work out so badly! Unfortunately the slit in the front on my 5'11&#34; curvaceous body just looked obscene. I returned it with no trouble at all for a full refund."
2.0,These are so cute and fit as expected but the little handle at the top broke the first day she wore them. Something a 4 year old is very concerned about. :(
2.0,Don't like it!  Not as expected!
2.0,Pants were a little snug and shirt way too small
2.0,Not worth it really. Better try another brand but the silly cloth mask is a nice touch.
2.0,I still love them and the cute surprise gift Thank you  .I will buy them again. 💕🐾💕 🐩
2.0,"I didn't care for this garment. The sleeves were very tight, but the rest of the shirt fit as shown in the picture, a bit over sized as shown and expected. I was really disappointed with the quality of this sweater. The material was hard and abrasive, not soft at all. The colors were nice, but the stitching around the neck was not good, it looked like it would fray out eventually. I was hoping to love this sweater based on other reviews and the photo, but I ended up returning."
2.0,"I, like a few other people who wrote about this in their reviews, was surprised to receive ONE cat keychain instead of FIVE. But the description does indicate that there will be only ""1 out of 5,"" so my bad. However, it is too expensive, in my opinion. Too expensive. The keychain is cute and seems well-made, but it is VERY small."
2.0,"Initially, I thought these were great, but they break over a fairly quick time and then you just have an expensive mask"
2.0,"It was exactly the size as advertised, until you wash it, got about 4&#34; shorter . . . . . not real thrilled with that (yes I followed the directions on the tag). Also came with a really strong vinegar smell, which has since washed out. The image is a little blurry, don't know if that was meant to be &#34;artistic&#34; or not. Overall, disappointed as this will now be a yardwork and painting tee due to the shrinkage .  . . . (note I bought three of these in different images, I'm going to share the same review on all three, Moon, Oz and Minneapolis) same story for all three. SIZE UP if you want it to fit according to the advertised size chart."
2.0,"These glasses look great; unfortunately they fit my head strangely. They constantly kept rising up the bridge line. I’ve never had any pair of glasses fit me in this manner. So, I ended up tossing them into the trash. Too bad....."
2.0,I don't know... I am not si satisfied with this.... sorry
2.0,"This nose ring is way too small, very upset about the fit.  The package did come promptly and they look sturdy.  I just can't understand how this can fit anyone."
2.0,Not as flowing as shown had to give to my daughter with no hips or butt .
2.0,Great price. Ridiculously crooked. I have no idea how I'm going to make these wearable.
2.0,"I am normally a small and purchased the medium based on reviews. If you're a stickler for buying inexpensive clothes that look classy and expensive, you won't like this dress. The material is very wrinkly, and the shoulders are sewn such that you need to roll up your sleeves in order to bend your arms - there needs to be spandex to accommodate that motion in the arms. The slit from the lowest button goes up to my crotch; this may be okay if you have a shorter torso. Overall it's a disappointing design."
2.0,"The products and quantities displayed in the picture were not accurate to what we received. We ordered them banking on having enough of the Halloween themed (non-pirate) rings for our son’s party at school, but some other ones not pictured were included rather than the pumpkin ones. They work fine and we got 30 of them, we just wish we would have gotten what the picture portrayed rather than the random “scream” ones, so we will be returning them."
2.0,The material use in made for this glass is low end material<br />Not good as guess brand<br /><br />I will never buy again<br /><br />Over price<br /><br />Thanks
2.0,The watch was too small for me in terms of appearance on my arm. It is very light and appears cheaply made.<br />F. Reeves
2.0,I like the silicon band and everything was great until I wore it in the pool. It says up to 30M resistant - NOT! And it's been way too long to return but this was the first time I had a chance to wear it in water.  :-(
2.0,"I guess it's my fault for not realizing how tiny 2mm is but these were so small that by the end of wearing them for one night, they were sinking into my ear. Wore them once, won't wear again. Might be good for kids?"
2.0,nice to have as a maternity dress and I like that it has pockets but material stretches out too much
2.0,these were extremely cute and they stay on your glasses extremely well. BUT the chain is pretty thin and it broke within a few days of me getting them.
2.0,Runs very small- size up
2.0,"Came wrinkled, bad fit. Does look like the picture though."
2.0,Lit bit transparent down waist. Fabric is cheap.
2.0,I wanted these socks
2.0,"This looked extremely small for a large. Barely came to hips, doesn't say it's supposed to be a crop top."
2.0,"This dress is one size too big for my body size. I am short at 5""3 and 175 lbs I bought an XXL and it was huge (drooping off the shoulders) and too long. I ordered the next size down xl and it too is roomy, but may fit better after wash and dry. If not I will have to be going down 2 sizes.  This dress is perfect for large behinds. It flares considerably at that area. Fits nice in the bust, and the lower v neck is not too low I am a 44 bust. The material is a medium, weight. not thin and not thick/heavy. I imagine that it will only shrink slightly if the manufacturer is honest about the cotton percentage. The xl was not dragging on the floor like the XXL. The length is perfect for me. The black fades badly. Only been washed a couple of times. Hope this helps someone."
2.0,"I'm 5'6"", 130 lbs, 34DD, 38-31-38, and usually wear a size 8 on top and 6 on bottom.<br /><br />I ordered an XL as per the size chart for ""Blue Checkered with Button."" It was probably the best size, but it didn't fit well at all. I returned it and did not try a different size.<br /><br />My arms were restricted from comfortably moving forward, backward, or up. I think the problem is that the armholes were cut very large, so once the sleeves are attached, moving the arms in the sleeves tugs on the dress almost immediately. It might work okay for someone with a larger ribcage, smaller breasts, and larger arms than mine, but I'm not sure about that. This is not a dress I could do daily activities in as I had hoped.<br /><br />The color was nice. The fabric was a decent weight, but it was shinier than I wanted, making it look like a costume, and it had a chemical smell. The stitching was mediocre. I was pleasantly surprised that the fabric was pieced together well such that the checks were properly vertical/horizontal and lined up with each other. That's the hardest thing to get right with a pattern like this."
2.0,"Screw that fits in camera can work it's way loose, just by walking along.  I guess you get what you pay for. Good concept, poor workmanship!  Dropped camera twice!  Get a better-made one!"
2.0,"Just as other reviews say, the kids hat is fine-ish but the adult hat is tiny. I have a little head and the adult hat is tight and looks too small. I got it for my daughter and I to wear this year to a turkey trot and I'm not sure I'll be able to wear my hat."
2.0,This runs very very small doesn't even fit over my arms wish I wouldn't have ordered
2.0,The size ran small. Didn't care for the material
2.0,"The entire body of this is plastic. Got one for my boyfriend and thought it would be fancier for the price it was. I'm almost embarrassed to give it to him. Scratch that, I'm totally embarrassed to give it to him."
2.0,"Just after first use the lenses (while cleaning) poped out of the frame, could fit them back but in each use needed to adjust it back.<br />The clip-on doing its job but the extra handeling ...well too much for me"
2.0,The hem is oddly cut it sat longer in the front and shorter in the back. The pleat on the chest area has a ton of extra material on the inside which makes it look It sloppy.
2.0,Just too thin fabric and not made very well
2.0,"I ordered black, I got grey. Sweats are comfortable but afraid to order more not knowing what color I'm gonna get."
2.0,BEWARE: I ordered four dresses from this company and all of them fit completely differently. Too big too small and too tight or short.. i was really upset as i read all the reviews to make sure i got right size but yet they were all different.
2.0,Terrible fitting and cheap fabric
2.0,"In your dreams sadly.  This is adjustable from 13 to 16 inches, and if you have an 18in neck then you're just plain out of luck.  The item is beautiful, and if it fit I would be very happy.  Sadly it will make a nice present for someone else because it'll never fit me."
2.0,"Very small, not designed for someone with a butt or hips"
2.0,"Not true to size runs small.  And my product had a scratch mark in the pattern down one leg, so i'm returning them."
2.0,Nothing like picture shorts are to long !<br />I'm 6.4 and shorts go to my ankles
2.0,Look cute but heavy
2.0,"Fits weird, looks cute but the straps are loose and long at the same time."
2.0,"This is a cute visor, but the brim is way too large and heavy and causes the visor to slide down on my forehead!  It slides down so far that I can't see!!!  I guess if I was sitting in a lounger and not moving, this visor would work, but whenever I move, the heavy weight of the brim causes the visor to fall down in front of my eyes. I wanted this for hiking. Since it is useless, I will need to return it."
2.0,"Even though these were purchased as a funny gift, the man who tried to wear them couldn't get them to fit.  They are for a much shorter torso.  They man was 6 feet tall and quite thin and the suspenders did not fit him properly even when adjusted to the longest possible adjustment.  I would not recommend these suspenders for anyone of height or heavy weight."
2.0,I would like the bra if it did run small. I wear a 40 but it did not come close to fitting. I gave the bra to my daughter who wears a 38 and it fit her. She likes the bra. I wanted to buy another one but I am not sure what size to buy. Size 40 had a long way to go to fit me.
2.0,The bars are Not long
2.0,The glasses definitely run small they were to small for me but my friend wears them and they work okay besides being a bit small still.
2.0,They were very tight around the thighs. I even got a size larger than what I usually wear.
2.0,Painful to walk on due to lack of cushion.
2.0,"This watchband was advertised as leather, and it is not. It has lasted about 7 months and is not cracking in a number of places. I will have to throw it out soon. Don't waste your money on an uncomfortable plastic watchband."
2.0,I thought this sweater would be sort of dressy. I was extremely unimpressed by it. It almost looked like a robe to be worn at home. And it wasnt as soft as I imagined it to be. It was a thick sweater for cold days. Just not what I was expecting. So I'll be returning it.
2.0,Looks like a house dress or a night gown
2.0,nice sweater but gave it to my granddaughter that it actually fit.
2.0,La goma del pelo es super mala galidad. Los gorros son buenos
2.0,We loved this shirt except it was 2 sizes too small after measurements for large is what we were advised. No stretch in shirt whatsoever.
2.0,Not very Practical
2.0,"I was hoping it’d be slightly more flowy, but it was really tight in the hips."
2.0,One sizevaway from me !! You need to be very thin not curvy to wear this dress.
2.0,"very cheap, when opened it already had a pull in the sleeve<br />I guess you get what you pay for. Returned it"
2.0,"This belt is very well made, and it is certainly roomy.<br /><br />I tried it out on a mildly warm day (75 degrees), and within an hour, it became very *hot* and *uncomfortable* (So much for the breathable material!). I can't imagine wearing it on a ten-hour plane ride.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I'm taking it along in my luggage, and will use it to store my passport and money in the Hotel Safe.<br /><br />As for a money belt, I'm going back to my wearing comfortable ten-year-old Rick Steves belt. When carrying a credit card, I'll put it in my RFID-blocking handbag."
2.0,Watch looked cool but band was chipped in two place.
2.0,Metal loop is placed too close to the buckle so you have to cratch amd tear up the belt to use it. Not durable or well made. This belt will only last me a few weeks before it wont be usable and ill have to throw it away!
2.0,Will change color quick.
2.0,Was very small for the large that I ordered but cute.
2.0,"These have gradient lenses, which was not disclosed, otherwise they are ok , there are others on here that are lower cost w/o gradient lenses."
2.0,Cute and good quality especially for the price but unfortunately has a weird fit. Bottom strip seems way too long and doesn't lay nicely on the neck. It looks like it's a more appropriate length for having a charm or something. I thought both strips were going to be pretty much the same length. I will be returning.
2.0,It was great wallet until it fell apart. The screws that hold it together all fell out.<br /><br />Great idea poorly made
2.0,Stone fell out as I wasn't putting it in my nose
2.0,Very large and is gathered at bottom which isn’t shown in the ad.
2.0,The suit runs small. Not true to size.
2.0,"Although it looks good, this watch was very poorly made. After giving it as a present to my grand daughter, it fell apart 5 minutes after I gave it to her. Not recommended for rough handling by 4 year olds."
2.0,"I got these for Salomon hiking boots that have two sets of hooks at the top instead of eyelets.  You know, like ice skates.  They don’t stay in place vey well. Then the magnets separate while you try to string them back through each hook.  Oh well I’ll have to try another."
2.0,This was made very crappy!  Would not recommend to anyone!
2.0,"I really wanted to like this product, but it started falling apart after 2 trips. I contacted the seller/manufacturer about the warranty, but no response. I would recommend a different suit garment for travel."
2.0,Did not attach well to versa 2
2.0,DO NOT FIT WELL
2.0,Charms not worth the price. Most are tiny and have stupid engravings that I dont know what they mean. Only 2 lg heart charms in the whole lot.
2.0,This umbrella broke after a few times of use. Not happy.
2.0,Las piedras no me gustaron
2.0,warm but fit like a beanie cap tight on your head
2.0,"Oh boy.  It looks far better on the model than it does on me. It was not remotely comfortable and was way too small. I was looking for something to toss on for beach and pool days and searched for a really long time. This was unfortunately a huge dud for me. It just made me feel really fat and misshapen. The arm loops, though adjustable, do not adjust the way I need them adjust. The wrap itself is just too small. If you’re petite and perfect looking this is definitely for you.  If you are curvy or large chested, pass on it.  Too bad :("
2.0,"It was way too long, both sleeves and body. I'm returning it."
2.0,after only having them for 2 wks they broke - was so saddened - now they are put together with duct tape - but only used around the house.
2.0,Looked as pictured but turned finger green within 2 days of wearing it.
2.0,"Glasses look good. Lens are clear and cause no Eyestrain. However, the earpieces seem to snap off at the hinge win a few weeks of use. I have bought three pairs. Two from Amazon  one from a brick and mortar stone. The results were the same. Break of the  earpieces at the hinge within a few weeks. Best to aviod."
2.0,It didn't look like the pic or fit like the picture.  The color looked faded and didn't like the material.  Never have worn it trying to give it away
2.0,Have only had for a month and a half. Ring scratches easily and the gh black filling is gone.
2.0,"Amending original review: zipper broke and now I can’t wear it. The cost to get the zipper replaced is more than the dress itself. Very disappointed because I really liked the dress.<br /><br />True to size. Very comfy. Fits well, no bunching. And it has POCKETS!!<br /><br />Also, no ironing required- always a plus."
2.0,These bands are not very good quality - a couple of them have already ripped.
2.0,Mine fell apart after about 4 hours of just hanging in my car on the mirror
2.0,"This runs extremely small -- there is no slouch, no bagginess, and the neck opening comes nowhere near off-the-shoulder.  The color is exactly as pictured, though."
2.0,The pearl came out the same day that I gave it to my daughter. I would never order this again
2.0,It’s about right around your chest but is very loose around arms.. don’t understand their logic for such fitting..
2.0,Very large. Had to retune cause they are just insane.
2.0,"You get what you pay for, boys. Cheap underwear will disintegrate within a few wears. One, on the very first one! Look elsewhere and pay a bit more, they will last longer."
2.0,"Size was much smaller than expected, and with 90% cotton it would shrink even more in the wash."
2.0,Alot smaller than expected.
2.0,"Runs very small. I usually wear a 7.5 (EU38-39 in Vibrams) and I bought these in 8.5. The length is fine, but the toebox is too narrow. Even lacing up the boot, you can tell that they fit too snugly. These boots cause me forefoot pain on hikes longer than 2 miles. I was looking for something warmer than FiveFingers for cold-weather hiking, but I'll have to keep searching."
2.0,"Beautiful, but not what it's supposed to be. Its stainless steel. And I'm allergic"
2.0,The colored stones are so small and not very vibrant that they are very hard to see
2.0,So stretchy it would not stay up. Also a nylon like material so it slides. It is pretty and was hoping it would work as a mask but it would slide down my face. Had to return it.
2.0,"I loved the style, cut & length of the skirt. Unfortunately, it was paper thin & unlined. I returned"
2.0,Returned as material was not as expected & was not breathable
2.0,A lot of them didn't work.
2.0,Some bracelets have obvious chemical smell
2.0,Do not compress much at all. They also fall down.
2.0,"Was beautiful upon receipt, but within a few weeks one of the side stones had fallen out. Very disappointed because I loved it."
2.0,The hat looks like it is a great hat But when I got it it didn’t feel like a regular hat it’s cut so different the snaps in the back are so tiny it’s for like a childhood I gave it away to a friend and he asked to put it on the last little click. Otherwise the logo looks nice. He seems to be happy with it. But like I said it’s a weird fit and it’s so small.
2.0,"I know it’s just a kid’s toy, but it could at least open!  What a joke."
2.0,"Three of the five shirts had long, loose threads and uneven stitching. These were purchased as undershirts for my son to wear under his basketball uniform. They are lightweight and comfortable, but probably won't hold up after a few washings based on sloppy stitching."
2.0,"The wave colors are only on one side as the back side is solid white.  It will work for my craft project, but calling these ""Murano-inspired"" is like calling this review Shakespeare-inspired."
2.0,Child sizing.
2.0,Cute style but the quality just isn’t there in person.  Especially for the prices of this brand.  Unfortunately the stitching where the straps are attached to the bag started to ripping the first time I used it.
2.0,"definetly looks alot better in pictures, very dissapointed with my purchase but it works.."
2.0,These boots are adorable!  But the bottom part of them is VERY GLITTERY.  Not a unisex boot in my opinion.  Girl only boots.  Especially for a toddler
2.0,"Loved them at first, but the czs turn dingy and aren’t sparkly anymore. Unhappy."
2.0,The dark dial makes it hard to see the hour & minute hands. Also should be advertising as a unisex watch as its fit is for a man. I had to go to a jewelry shop to get links taken out which cost me more money. I do like how lite the watch is & the look of it.
2.0,Fell apart after one year of use...wish it lasted longer
2.0,This is hardly what I expected. It isn't as colorful & doesn't have the bling as the photo. I'm not happy with it.
2.0,"Boa arrived...on time, but very thin and I wanted a thick one like it shows in the picture. It's for a bachelorette party and a little disappointed.great color"
2.0,Hugely disappointed.  The shirt came with an extremely wide collar making it fit poorly (I like the collar to be snugger around the neck and not super wide like a Flashdance shirt.  Haven't worn it since I got it.
2.0,"very warm, but does not work on touch screens!"
2.0,Looked different than picture. I quickly returned it.
2.0,These came with a brown stain on them!
2.0,expect better quality
2.0,They are comfortable until you move around even just walking from room to room they start sliding down. Not happy with these cute but not functional.
2.0,"On the gold and silver shield, the spelling is LAPTAIN AMERICA which sucks. And the dark shield says CAPTAIN AMFAICA which also sucks. The paint on the gold one is kind of faided which also sucks. The only good thing about these is that they seem to be decent quality aside from those details."
2.0,"I like the shirt, but it it is  a M size more than an XL.  I will ask for a larger one  as a return."
2.0,"Had to buy second one as first arrived with whole. Granted I did not attempt to return or contact. I simple bought new one. Imagine my surprise when I order same exact thing and totally diff. Shirt arrives. Yes union jack on front but other than that, different style sleeve different fit. Meaning too large and material was thinner. I am the last person is ever thought would be complaining bout shift being too largebbut when it fits it fits darn it. So basically no consistantcies between product."
2.0,Good looking but just a form without moving parts and opening Kid was disappointed big time
2.0,I bought according to the size chart and this was much too small. Gave it 2 stars because it is lovely.
2.0,Unfortunately I will be returning these... my husband works outdoors and said he feet were cold in these socks
2.0,"The band the luminox watch came with broke 3 times. Each time I replaced it with the original band. Finally, I decided to upgrade to this great looking and extremely comfortable band. However, the pins have fallen out 3 times and now I am out of pins from the links I removed to make it fit. Unbelievable, I am relatively hard on this watch but not SEAL hard. I do not recommend this band."
2.0,I ordered two pairs of these last year and they were by far my favorite workout pants. I ordered another pair a few days ago and they aren’t the same!! They are very see through and the material isn’t good. Very disappointed.
2.0,Cheap and flimsy. I liked the shape.
2.0,I returned this polyester type material... felt like I was wearing paper. To bad I like the print and the diagonal design but don't like the material and the way it didn't fit my frame for the size posted.
2.0,The sweater is bulky and the turtleneck is way too much material and comes up way too high. Wanted to love it but will never wear it
2.0,I’m a little curvy and I didn’t not find it flattering on me. The sides were too open otherwise I’m not sure if it was good for running as I didn’t use.
2.0,"I’ve worn tight compression socks for 20 years while working long 12 hour shifts. These are not stretchy, they are itchy, and overall super uncomfortable. Would not recommend. After one wear, I returned the other pairs."
2.0,The adult size was still a little small and it was uncomfortable wearing the hat.  I returned and went to go buy a real straw hat.
2.0,"These sunglasses were good, no issues until 5 months later it cracked. Ugh! I noticed some other buyers had the same issue as well. And no they weren't being roughed around, I take care of my things! I even have cheaper sunglasses that has lasted longer than these. Oh well, at least they weren't really expensive."
2.0,Lenses work but clumsy clip on detracts
2.0,It runs tight I didn’t realize was made in China or I wouldn’t have purchased.There sizes run way small
2.0,This necklace looks totally different than the one I ordered and it is not well made the clasp is on wrong and causes it to scratch me so I don't wear it.
2.0,My son finally got a chance to put his goalie set on and there was a hole in the sock. He was so upset. The shirt was wonderful and the shorts looked good. Just had an issue with the socks
2.0,"This is probably one of the prettiest wastes of my money. I was super excited to get this with plans on wearing it to a concert but when I did and tried... TRIED... to put it on, it felt like I was torturing my ear. The tail and wing (of the dragon) are attached and leave NO room to fit comfortably around the ear; in fact I couldn't get it to stay put at all. The piece is well crafted but not flexible at all so there is no way to adjust it to fit.<br /><br />**I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my 100% HONEST review."
2.0,I ordered black Xl and received dark purple. The dress is not very flattering for fuller figure women in my opinion.
2.0,"All came very small in size, X-Large was like a Large, L was like a Med."
2.0,"Not at all what I had expected.  I had to return it.  There was no possibility of ever wearing it.  Although, the style itself was cute, just way too thin."
2.0,The jacket fit except for sleeves. Too wide and long.  I have long arms and way too long for me
2.0,"So I'm about 5'8"" and while the size was right as far as legs and around the middle the bib was barely at my chest and if I would have buttoned the straps I would be walking around with a colossal wedgie and be stooped over"
2.0,My grandson only got to wear this maybe 4 times. Just too small
2.0,"A little to revealing for my 16 year old.  I waited too long for her to try it on, so I'm stuck w it.  It is also cheaply made."
2.0,"Loved it, but not the right size.  Sent it back."
2.0,The Cadillac symbol on the hat was cheaply done looks like a iron on. Not what I was expecting my son loves Cadillac’s and owes afew of them but when I gave him this hat he just threw it in a corner good
2.0,Just came back from a 1100 mile weekend bike trip. GLOVES did not keep my hands warm. Hands were still cold. Outside temperatures were between 40-44 degrees. Couldn't work my phone touch screen while wearing the gloves
2.0,These look beautiful but I was concerned about the build and if they would last. The wire part that goes through your ear feel flimsy. It's suppose to stay on your ear by creating tension in the hole on the bottom beaded part. I returned these.
2.0,Mask cuts off most of the pattern
2.0,"The day the package arrived, the vinyl used for the tinted logo was flaked off or torn. the logo is not readable."
2.0,I have an athletic body and after wearing these for about 10 minutes they're already rolling up.  They're completely unusable to me.
2.0,"Tag says 34-36, but actual measurements are 32-34. Is it that hard to measure?"
2.0,"I was expected a bright orange watch but what I got was a very dull orange. I have several ice watches, but this is by far my least favorite. If your looking for a bright orange festive watch, this is not it"
2.0,Did not last a half of a year with moderate use. Very disappointing.
2.0,There weren’t any s or d’S
2.0,Doesn't look as pictured. The black hardly shows through as there is tulle fabric over it. The picture looks like the lace is across the bottom part of the black skirt...but it's attached to the tulle skirt that covers the whole dress.
2.0,Once washed it no longer fits child
2.0,It's cute but the links kept breaking off on the first day that I wore it
2.0,Poor Quality for price
2.0,These say 36 But they are so Huge they fall to the ground I should have got a size 34. But i Have 2 more part that fit just fine. I truly think someone placed wrong size on shorts as I placed them agaisnt the 2 other pair AND they are not correcct sizing.
2.0,It is itchy.  It is to large.  The speakers slide all over and end up down around your jawline. It looks NOTHING like the picture.  RETURNING
2.0,Cute too but way too small. I ordered a medium and it fit like an extra small.
2.0,"I honestly wouldn't have purchased these earrings if I'd known how small they were, it was a big disappointment. The image the seller posted misrepresented the size. I will be cautious in the future."
2.0,"not sure who would hang this robe to dry. so be mindful, this robe will continue to fit a wide range of body types after you throw it in the dryer, but it will get quite a bit shorter! was hoping for quite a bit more length, especially given the photos- this robe would never hit the ankle of a tall-ish man (as photographed) even before throwing it in the dryer. this is about knee-length, on a shorter woman."
2.0,I went based off the sizing chart when I ordered. I was between a 2x and 3x. I decided to get the 3x so I would have a little extra room. Big mistake! The pants were so big. They were about 5 inches to big in each pant leg and about 6 inches to big in the waist. That being said they were nice pants. I would have purchased them again in a different size but they were no longer available. I returned them and received a refund.
2.0,I bought a 2X when I normally where a1X-2X. It fit like a large
2.0,"At first glance this phone case was exactly what I wanted. Sadly once I populated the three slots with a single card in each, the closure no longer that the strength to hold the case closed.  :("
2.0,Jeans were too big and too long
2.0,Based on reviews I ordered up . I got an XL instead of a L. It fit but the belt broke right away and the dress I received was not as pictured . I ordered the only color design listed and it was not the same . I wanted to coordinate with my girls for a wedding but now it really doesn’t match .
2.0,Bought two. One in green and one in red. The green one was perfect and I wore it to a destination wedding. The red one the fit was ok but the seems were not sewn well and puckered at the hips. Because of that I returned the red one.
2.0,The 3X was still too small even though I normally where 2X.
2.0,It’s bigger
2.0,"Se me daño el mismo dia,todos los hilos se salieron del amarre."
2.0,Doesn’t have the same fitted look that the picture shows. I was pretty disappointed overall and never bothered wearing it.
2.0,Picture didn't look like actual product
2.0,[[VIDEOID:54dfa0718b4fb872b8c82744014b488b]] love the design and it fits my face perfectly if it wasn’t warped. it seems like it was squished or under heavy items. worried about shaping it back to place seeing the fragile reviews of it :/
2.0,"I'm 5 ft 10 in, wore the skirt as a high waist and it still fell several inches below my knee."
2.0,"6'1""<br />135lbs<br />34C<br />24 Waist<br />34 Hip<br /><br />Material: soft and comfortable. Great sweater material for fall<br /><br />Fit: perfect oversized fit. Very boxy and large. Purchased in a large<br /><br />Color: more red than brown and doesn't look anything like the material in the photo.<br /><br />Do not recommend this item due to poor imaging and color quality"
2.0,Cute blouse but runs VERY big!
2.0,It has NOT broken but it has a magnetic end which does come undone easily.  So a little nervous about it falling off at some point.
2.0,"Super thin material, took two months to arrive, cute patterns but two months is too long to wait for something"
2.0,DRESS WAS REALLY CUTE.  RAN SUPER SMALL.
2.0,Unfortunately I only put this on my baby for a few hours. It's not comfortable and cheaply made.
2.0,If youre a little curvier probably a bit too see through.
2.0,Turned inside out to wash.  First washing frayed out the pockets.  I haven’t even worn them yet.
2.0,Sized smaller than described in description.  Very disappointed!
2.0,The socks aren't great quality. There are strings coming off which makes me think they'll pull easily. So it feels ehh
2.0,Cheap material. Faded colors. My daughter thought it looked like cheap swim suit material. The fit is really strange and it sort of flares out at the bottom.<br /><br />I already tossed it in the donation pile.
2.0,"This was supposed to be a rose gold color, but instead, it just looks like tarnished brass 😟 I just gave it to my daughter to play with. Not worth the money."
2.0,"This shirt is adorable, but is way too small.  I read the reviews and ordered accordingly, but the shirt I received is snug and I need to return. I am a size 8, so I ordered a L, and it still didn't fit.  I usually order mediums in shirts.  Disappointed because I really do think it's cute!"
2.0,"Let me count the ways.<br /><br />First, for reference:<br />I'm 5'9"", 158lbs, athletic/swimmer build. Boyish but 34DD.<br /><br />• Size. It's way too big. And too stretchy — has no compression of any kind — and you REALLY need that for a one-shoulder suit. No idea how another reviewer made this work?<br /><br />• Material is thin. Very thin — I'm talking not just ""can see details through"" but almost ""can see texture of skin through.""<br /><br />• Lord, these cups :( Wonky AF on me, and you can see where they slope and drop off because the material just isn't thick enough to buffer it.<br /><br />• That buckle! The buckle for the one strap is cheap semi-transparent plastic. Not a good, quality-looking, glasses frame tortoiseshell but the cheapest of the cheap light and faded, and it does not look sturdy to me.<br /><br />• Loose threads, poor stitching<br /><br />• Cockeyed boob situational, ugh, look away! Absolutely does NOT stay up well on the strapless side (typically one-shoulder fits will have some type of plasticized interior seam to keep them up). Here, it's not so much that one side falls, but rather that the suit has no firm support built into it — just this really loose interior bralette that had no support for me. So the effect is that the cups just sort of float in a slightly-too-big, too-thin swimsuit. When the one shoulder strap pulls the left boob up, the other sadly floats 1.5 inches (charitably) below it. NOT a good look. Anyone who's pulled a sport bra on too fast and forgotten to situate the girls in it and caught themselves in a mirror will know this look.<br /><br />The only thing I like is the color, which is beautiful, but this one is too awful for me even to donate conscionably."
2.0,"I purchased the &#34;linen&#34; color. What I received looked far shinier than the pictures, like it was heavily glazed, and it had a very strong odor that smelled like shampoo to me. You can't easily tell from the pictures here, but the top does not open and it is difficult to access the inside of the purse from the side zipper. That also somewhat reduces the usable space inside the purse, making it too small for me. Even though I purchased it at half off, I ended up returning it."
2.0,"Game changer!  Super comfortable! By far the most comfortable band I’ve had on a watch. Makes it feel Ike I’m not wearing anything on my wrist!  I’m hoping this will help my Garmin Vivioactive 3 be more accurate with my heart rate when I’m working out. We shall see!  I’ll update my review after the holidays.  I’m happy with the band so far. We will see how it stand up to sweat and water.<br /><br />*** Update ***<br /><br />Pins are maybe too short or not strong enough. The pins have come undone twice today causing my watch to fall off. Luckily I noticed it both times.<br /><br />It is comfortable, but not trustworthy."
2.0,"Not at all what I was expecting. The color in the photo looks like an off white, but it's more of a tan color.  I was expecting something that had a little more structure to it but it was almost like a floppy brimmed hat and seemed kind of limp. It didn't look like it cost what it did but I still might have kept it if it hadn't been a little too small."
2.0,"I purchased this under the men&#34;s &#34;big and tall&#34; section thinking I was purchasing a &#34;big and tall&#34; product and it was misleading,the product is not for tall people,it is only double xx large. Will not purchase like this again. Only wasting my money on misleading product like this."
2.0,Horrible texture. Like a very thin cheap shower curtain. Can't wear it.
2.0,Wasn't great for the price.
2.0,Stones not uniform in size or brightness.
2.0,Looks pretty yet of lower quality product for the price :(
2.0,"The purse itself looks very nice and is very pretty. Unfortunately the Amazon description states that it is lead free, but the purse comes with a tag that contains a warning that the product may contain lead which can lead to birth defects. It's just not worth it to me in the end. This information should have been disclosed before purchasing the item. The description is misleading."
2.0,The warm liner unwantedly and easily slides down on forehead.
2.0,These are low quality compared to leroi of the same size.  They are not 12g actually thinner.  Also the balls are not concave covering the barbell like leroi.  They sit flush to the top.  Last the balls seem larger than my 3/16” leroi as well.  You get what you pay for.  Now I have to buy another pair for my tongue of higher quality.  Don’t get me wrong they work but I want only the best body Jewlery. I’d have to get a pair of calipers to compare sizes but it’s obviously a difference without measuring.
2.0,"shirt is very thin,not a true thermal! not worth the money!"
2.0,"I only received 5 of the 6 pieces, and two of them broke after the second time I wore them.<br />They are super cute, but whatever was used to make them is very flimsy."
2.0,"They keep comming apart at swim lessons. Not for little guys, maybe better for adults fooling around"
2.0,"These were very pretty, but...I  should have read the reviews before I purchased. The backs were very loose but I was in a hurry and stuck them on anyway. Live and learn. One fell out so I'm now out the money and earrings...."
2.0,"Considering this is a beach cover-up (thinking hot sun and sweat)"" the material was very cheap, unbreathable, and would add to the perspiration.  I want my cover ups to catch the wind and help me body breath on a hot day - not this one."
2.0,"These where not what I expected, the stones where way to small."
2.0,Easy to cut the belt too short (as I ended up doing) - the end of the belt with the ratchet notches is unusually long. In order to get the length to feel normal you have to go very small on waist size.
2.0,very large and not what i expected
2.0,"Bought two.  Both fell apart after a year or two of use.  The screws holding the upper ring eventually strip due to the tension from the spring.  Guessing the screws are made from cheap pot metal, because that shouldn't happen, and it happened to both of them.."
2.0,Nice color but it’s too tight
2.0,"I saw this watch, saw the price, knew this was too good to be true. An Automatic for $43? Knew there had to be a catch. Got is yesterday and is going back today. First the small issue- the band. Lightweight and poorly constructed (had to be angled to close properly). Now the large issue. It didn't hold a wind. Read the instructions and this morning was not working. From the time, it had been stopped for 5 hours. When I compared the second hand to a stopwatch the difference was about a second fast a minute (which may be why the watch wouldn't hold a wind).<br /><br />Aside from those items, the watch was great (seriously). Beautiful face and overall look was luxurious. The date and day buttons worked perfectly. KS is a young company (in watch terms) and I hope they can bring it up a notch."
2.0,"I bought a medium for my husband (his usual size), but it was too big. He washed and dried the shirt to shrink it, but it didn’t shrink. Be careful of the sizing when you order and size down. The fabric and style are fine, and it is an otherwise good shirt."
2.0,I ordered L and I got XL
2.0,So cheap looking...not worth it even for the price
2.0,Charm falls off<br />U have to loop it they for it to stay closed<br />Cheaply made<br />Not for long use
2.0,"Bought for my husband (chosen by our daughter) as a birthday gift.  Day 1 it will not keep time.  We will try to get the battery changed to see if it helps, but I am not holding my breath. It looks great, but that doesn’t help tell time."
2.0,"As the description fits most.  You should not buy this based on the shoe size. I have a 16 inch diameter calf and 16 inches from foot to base of knee. They started an inch or two below the knee, by the end of the day were equivalent to a trouser sock.  I would not buy these again."
2.0,"Love the print and material. But the sizing is way off. I’m a small, ordered the medium. Too snug and the hem was very very small.  It did not come close to even fitting my waist.  The shoulders did not match the hemline. If you got the right fit for your shoulders, the hem would be too small. You’d have to go up three sizes but still not fit overall."
2.0,"This does not look like the picture. Thr dragon is not red, it is orange. the material is questionable, like a halloween costume. i wear a medium but i orderd a large and im pretty flat chested and this is very short and small. Im not happy with this. If you have an average to large chest, i do not believe it will fit well."
2.0,"Got this top as a gift, and the material was thin, see through, and had zero stretch. I'm 5'6"", 190 lbs, 38D. Could barely get it over my breasts and it stopped at my hips. If I had no breasts and no hips, it would have fit. Removing from my wishlist. Gave top to my neice who wears size small, and she uses it with a tank underneath."
2.0,These masked only fit a certain mask... they don't fit all masks. They on fit the masks with the folds on the inside.<br />Like the white mask with the blue on the inside . I Feel like they sholud make that part of the  description known.<br /> I'm returning and very disappointed.
2.0,"It came sooner than expected which was a pleasant surprise. However, it was nowhere near as roomy as pictured and arrived with four small holes. I decided to use it as a nightgown ."
2.0,This definitely is not a mans sized hat.  It is very small!  It fit my 2 year old grandson much better.
2.0,Not a good quality or interesting toys.
2.0,"Terrible fit, not lightweight"
2.0,"Super cheap looking/feeling rayon fabric. Plus, came in bunched up in a bag and super wrinkled. Looked like a rag. Returned it."
2.0,Dress came with rip in the thigh area which later expanded to half of the dress. It was completely unwearable and poor quality. Very unhappy.
2.0,"Well, first and foremost, the plastic fogs as soon as you breathe. I even bought an anti-fog cleaning cloth and it didn’t help (but works great for my glasses). Second, they’re not comfortable. Third, the fit is loose. I should’ve sent them back but, I didn’t."
2.0,"Only  reason this is 2 stars is that one of the elephants came off and I had to JB Weld it. Other than that, great fit and looks good."
2.0,They sent the wrong size. Even if I got the right size I don’t know how I feel about it. I love the feel and color. It’s just really an odd cut
2.0,I really wanted to say this shirt was amazing! But it was a bit of a fixer upper! It is more of a purple then grey which is fine I just would have it listed as purple not grey.<br /><br />You can see In The 1st picture I had to fix the neck. It very loose and was just not attractive. I used my magical sewing skills to fix it before I noticed another flaw... that one I think I'll just leave alone. The front is longer then the back by about 2 inches.<br /><br />I thought at 1st I had it on backwards but the white fringe is the front. You can see what I am talking about in my 3rd pic. Other then those 2 things it actually fit me. I wear a size 16-18 normally so that was nice.<br /><br />It is thick enough to not wear a tank..... unless you are wearing a patterned bra so beware which you can see in the second pic....
2.0,"Good looking watch with pleasant aesthetics. Although the silver hands are similar in color to the face, they are surprisingly easy read considering the low contrast. Could do without the buckle clasp on the leather strap though, A clamping clasp would be much better. Those buckles on a leather strap tend to prematurely damage and wear out the strap. Replaced the strap with a 23mm black silicone Archer strap; looks fantastic and contrasts nicely with the light colored face. This is a heavy watch and what's good about the silicone band is the watch stays put where I like it; just above the pisiform bone. Don't like a loose watch where it can get damaged, and I have to fiddle to see the time as it flops around loose on my wrist.  Accuracy is excellent as is almost always the case with a quartz movement. The date window is too small. The window perimeter casts a shadow on the date digits which makes the date more difficult to read.<br />UPDATE: After less than a few days of use, the chrono start button has a problem. Fails to stop and then restart to continue a timing. NOT GOOD! I thought maybe the watch mechanism was defective. however, it seems the oblong buttons can ""misfire"" or not misfire. Pressing the button closer to the 12o'clock and the chrono fails to stop and start properly, but if the button is pressed below center and closer to the crown it works fine. I have TWO of this same model watch and the other one works fine. It appears to be an alignment problem with the chrono start button and the mechanism. NOT GOOD! Definitely a QUALITY CONTROL PROBLEM since this is a brand NEW watch. Sorry but going to have to knock the stars down on this VERY nice appearance watch. It is just absolutely UNACCEPTABLE to send out a $650 watch with buttons that DO NOT WORK properly, and there are only TWO!"
2.0,"The color is not a true purple, more burgundy than purple. The cover is nothing like the picture at all. Very flimsy."
2.0,"These are not thermals. You get what you pay for with this product. They're pretty cute when you pull them out of the package. I bought these to wear under fleece lined leggings and other warm things while camping. They did almost nothing. Another layer is another layer, but my camping companion wore similarly priced thermals for men and was fine in just those on our coldest night.<br />The first time I wore them all night, the butt developed a run where the fabric is thinnest.<br />If you're looking for the shaping aspect, they offer very very little structure. I am thin, but still have fat on me and this didn't do anything to hide it or make it worse.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />If you're looking for cheap, cute, and comfy spring/fall indoor pajamas, order a size up to avoid developing a run.<br />If you're looking for cheap thermals, go for a waffle or fleece lined set. These are not worth the money."
2.0,The blue diamond fell out and the dog mom wore off
2.0,Not at all the right size.
2.0,Not the truth only received one lace not a pair
2.0,These were at least two sizes smaller in the wedge than my many other Fly London shoes.  The top of the shoe was wider than normal.  I am not sure these are Flys because of the sizing.
2.0,These feel like I'm going to rip out of them!!  I ordered a large and usually take a medium and they are still too tight!!
2.0,"I've recently changed prescription, so was hesitant to spend more money for sunglasses. Had a clip-ons years ago and while ""dorky"" they did the job. Though a more expensive pair like these would look a little less weird, but they are pretty much the same as drug store models. Clip on worked OK, but the tinted lens part tends to rise up with movement, leaving little doubt to anyone looking your way that you are wearing clip-ons. Saving my pennies to buy ""real"" sun glasses."
2.0,The hats were very poor quality. Most broke before or during putting them on. The sparkly ball was broken on almost all of them.
2.0,"This watch looks cool. Only 1 problem and it's a big one: you can't tell time without a magnifying glass. The actual time dial is so small and the hands have such little contrast that you simply cannot read it. All the other dials are non-functional.  If you just want wrist candy, this is the watch for you. Just make sure you have another watch that you can read on your other wrist,"
2.0,color is lighter than pic
2.0,broke on the second day
2.0,Broke after wearing a few times
2.0,Was really nice at first but quickly the pink washed out and it looked really faded after only a few times in the pool.
2.0,"The item is very pretty, but it broke when removing it from the packaging."
2.0,"Online, the product looks somewhat sweater-y.  It is not.  It is made out of quilted cotton as the description states and is not at all fuzzy.  I'm 5'3&#34; and the pockets hit me right at the hips, making my hourglass shape appear even more hippy.  The color is also more muted than the photos online suggest. I thought this would be comfy and cozy to wear to work (where I sit at a desk all day and get cold) or on a plane; however, it's not wrap-up-able and since it is cotton, it can be pretty chilly."
2.0,"They barely lasted more than 4months, and I received them without steel toes in them."
2.0,"Seams are very strong, fabric feels nice, great length (ankle length on my long legs! I’m 5’7”), convenient side pocket.<br /><br />HOWEVER- These are soooooo see through. No matter what kind or color underwear you wear with them (on the package it says to wear a similar color haha). Even with a long shirt, I still wouldn’t wear these.<br /><br />Returned."
2.0,The picture makes the product appear much better than it is in fact.
2.0,Not as clear as advertised
2.0,The fit and the band are great. However the color fades/wears off. I like the band however I've had it less then a month and it looks like this. This was the rose colored one.
2.0,"This item is marked as stainless steel; however, it's VERY light.  The stones are really pretty--sparkly.  I tried on the bracelet, and it snagged my sleeves.  It will go into a drawer as a future gift.  Not really pleased with this purchase."
2.0,The look was cute but fabric was horrible. Looks and felt like a Brillo pad or felt not a true sweatpants and sweatshirt material
2.0,Material was way different than I expected. More of a thick slinky material-not cotton. It was also lighter in color than pictured.
2.0,Bought it in June and the magnet came lose in August. Now we can’t use it for fear the watch will fall off. Good concept but cheaply made.
2.0,"I ordered this bracelet and it arrived before this order: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009Z205UO/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />This is exactly the same as the bracelet in this order. Exactly. The bracelet pictured here is not what you get. You get the other one. So, I do not like that it is not the bracelet pictured. In fact because I ordered the other one and got it already, I know it is nothing like the one pictured here."
2.0,inside sleeves are not durable
2.0,I ordered a 2X so it would be nice and loose and cool. IThat is not my normal size. Instead it is barely a 1X. The top part is tight through my shoulders and chest and I did check the sizing listed in the item posted. I try to stay away from imported clothes from china because their American sizing is terrible.  Scratch this as another mistake..  Nice material but poor sizing.
2.0,I was surprised with the order I hadn’t gone past putting it in the cart but since I needed them I decided to try them once you get them on beside the lack of arch support they r pretty comfortable but kinda stiff and the no need to tie laces is great but they don’t skip in very easily. I’m hoping they break in soon and I git insole inserts
2.0,"I wanted to love this bra...but sadly I did not. Here’s why:<br />1) As other reviewers have noted, the ribbing along the side seams is EXTREMELY uncomfortable. For some unknown reason, there is a stiff piece of plastic inside each seam even though this is entirely unnecessary. The plastic does NOT help the bra in any way/shape/form; instead, it causes the seam to bunch up and dig into your sides. I ended up cutting open the seams and removing the plastic pieces (see photos) because the bra was unbearable with them intact.<br />2) The fabric pieces that hold the bra up when the cups are unclipped are VERY flimsy and do not stay in place well when the cups are clipped in place. As a result, the flimsy fabric pieces migrate while the bra is in use and end up sticking out over the edges of the cups. When you’re wearing dark/thick shirts this isn’t a big issue...but when you’re wearing light/thin shirts you can definitely see the irregular cup edges caused by the flimsy fabric pieces.<br />3) The bra straps are very thick. This might be a plus for some women, but for me the straps felt very matronly and unattractive. I didn’t realize how thick they were from the product photos, but in person they are much wider than other nursing bras I own. I included a VS bra in one of the photos to illustrate the significant difference in strap thickness."
2.0,Pretty light and cheap-looking
2.0,"I found this as my first choice for hoodie with thumb holes which I love ,the hood came almost perfect ,it was true to size ,very comfortable ,sleeves long enough ,large hood which is a plus ,just as described ,but the big problem was the complete uneven sewing in thumb holes !!one side was totally larger and sewed so uneven the thumb hole was actually outward and can see where the stitching is !! usually if it's a small difference I wouldn't mind but in this case it wasn't ,so very disappointing."
2.0,"I first bought this necklace in the gold.  I loved it.  It was shiny and looked more expensive than it was.  I then decided to get the same necklace in black and silver.  What a mistake! The black is not a jet black, and it wasn't shiny.  It was kind of a dark grey.  The silver did not have the shiny luster that the gold had.  Both the black and the silver look like cheap dime store jewelry.  I was very disappointed with the purchase."
2.0,Material stinks and so thin material that you can see through it 👎🏻
2.0,Product was ok..just too small for me.<br />If you buy it just be aware that if you want to return it.<br />You have to pay for shipping back to China! Cost to ship back was $15.<br />I decided to skip it....just be aware.
2.0,"I ordered a Large, I am 5'5&#34;, 155 lbs size 8, 36DD, it was too large and not low cut at all, I gave it to a friend who is a size 14 and it fit her. The company said they would be happy to send medium at no additional charge for my troubles but that was 4 weeks ago and I haven heard back."
2.0,"The straps are extremely loose around the entire foot. I do have more narrow feet, but this is not an issue I usually have with strappy shoes. Ended up returning because they looked silly gapping so far from my foot"
2.0,"I just got the package with this suit in it and I was so excited to try it on! The suit came in a plastic bag with a zip top, which was broken upon arrival but that's really not a big deal. As reviews stated I ordered up 2 sizes and paid careful attention to the size chart, but upon looking at the suit I knew the top would be too small. I took it out of the package and holy boob padding! Those cups are heavily padded so beware if you're busty like I am and don't need padding. I tried on the top and it covered maybe 1/3 of the area it should've covered, and I didn't even bother with the bottoms even though they looked like they would fit. I'm 5'8&#34;, about a size 16, and ordered the 4XL. While I'm returning the suit since it's unusable for me, if you have smaller breasts I think this would work well. My 40F boobs just aren't even close to fitting in this suit. Overall the suit seems to be a good quality for the price and like it would hold up really well.<br /><br />I purchased this item at a discount for my honest review"
2.0,Very thing material. Should not be considered a jacket/blazer. Fits ok
2.0,"the shirts are great. I have been buying them for work in my restaraunt for years.<br />These were different.<br />Compared to my older shirts they seemed about a full size smaller. The material is still good, but stiffer. Clearly CB has made a change to this shirt."
2.0,"Very clingy, and it definitely runs small."
2.0,The top was too small!!!
2.0,The material literally felt like those old school thick curtains. Almost itchy and not breathable by any means. Had to return.
2.0,"Ah i wish i had the body for it! had to return it. super cute looking dress. the top was a bit big for me. I ordered a Medium but i guess maybe a size down might fit my top better but then it wouldnt have fit my bottom side. Im a 34A and the top (with padding) was wayyy too baggy for me. Then the under slip is TINY. If you bend over in it at all, you bottom would show. If it were a little longer i think it would've been a great dress!  material is cheap feeling too. But great concept of a cute summer dress."
2.0,I agree with other reviewers that there is way too much room in the shoulder on this dress. It felt like the shoulders could have fallen off at any minute while wearing it.<br /><br />Also it shows my fupa in an unflattering way.
2.0,Cheap material and uncomfortable but are cute
2.0,"At first I REALLY liked these when I got them and tried them on! Unfortunately, after an initial wash I wore them to the barn to ride... first I noticed that the elastic of the waistband was separating at the back. It’s nothing you can see, but I could certainly FEEL that the elastic inside the waistband was only being held together by a small piece at the bottom of the elastic band. The top of the elastic band is not connected (will try to show with photo), so my fear is that at any time the whole elastic waistband could give. Secondly, I had put my phone in the pocket and while I was riding, it fell out. Of the BOTTOM of the pocket (see photo). Otherwise I really liked the weight, fit, and full seat of these tights. Just very disappointed in the quality of craftsmanship and hoping to get a refund on my return even though they have been worn."
2.0,Absolutely ugly
2.0,These are supposed to be slip ones you put your foot down in the back goes down. All I meant I don’t come back up. They get stuck inside the shoe very disappointed with this product.
2.0,The velcro and toes started wearing out within a month.
2.0,"I like the print but after some time I see the quality actually isn't really there. Im 5'11"" and 160 and got the medium.  they have pockets, but I returned them."
2.0,"I ordered an XXL and the top didn't fit at all, the bottoms fit but tightly. Definitely order at least 3-4 sizes over your actual size."
2.0,The numbers are too small.  Very disappointed
2.0,"I loved this pencil case, until it broke.  It lasted almost 2 years which isn't bad.  But I have had other pencil cases that have lasted much longer with more use.  Sad."
2.0,i only wore them 6-7 times and thong strap broke!
2.0,"very hard to set the watch. it wasn't kid friendly.not even sure it is water proof (as it says in the description). Its a wrong choice for a 7yrd old. Rasied a feedback to the supplier within return time (I guess), did not get any response yet. Guess, I will rethink to buy stuffs like these online.. we are adjusting it because of the color.."
2.0,It's not nearly as cute in person as it is in the photos. It's sort of flimsy for a swimsuit and ran larger than expected
2.0,"Cute in the picture.  I typically wear a 14 but I ordered a 16.  It arrived today and is too small, especially in the upper arms.  It would cost too much to return it so I'll probably pass it on to a friend. Construction doesn't look as if it will last through too many wearings.  Oh well."
2.0,"I'm 5'2"", and 112 pounds, and as much as I wanted it to fit, it was just too loose. The hubby took a look and said 'uh uh' while shaking his head vigorously back and forth. Unfortunate, it's too cute."
2.0,Not what I expected.  Arrived bent. Made a bit smaller than expected for a one size fits most hat.
2.0,"I love to try innovative new products. I heard the cool radio ads for Frigo and thought it was a great concept. But the shorts just aren't that great or innovative. They're useful enough that I'm not going to cut them up for the refund, but I also won't be buying any more. Overall, the elastic straps seem gimmicky."
2.0,"They're not very stretchy, and so they aren't very comfortable. :( And unfortunately the fingertips pads don't work about 2/3 of the time. So I'll just be sitting there with my gloves smashing my fingers into the screen until I give up and just take the glove off. Giving it 2 stars because at the very least, they keep my hands decently warm (until I have to take them off to use my phone.)"
2.0,These glasses looked great but broke after just a week. The screw came out.
2.0,Came broken inside the box. Had to fix it myself with a clamp.
2.0,This shirt is way too long
2.0,"Nice scarf but the color in the picture is different from actual.  I didn't like the actual color, and returned.  It was too bright."
2.0,Very pretty. Clasp broke after a week. Disappointing to say the least. Couldn't send it back.
2.0,He corner of the large case cracked on my first trip.  One of the wheels snapped off on my cond.  Do not buy these.  The color is great but the quality results in a useless product.
2.0,Ordered in gray. The gray is more of a periwinkle blue than a gray. Not sure what I can wear it with now. Not what I was looking for.
2.0,"These may fit your cat, a large ferret your neighbour my own, or a small child but they certainly wont fit you.  Be warned.  Warrrnneeddd."
2.0,Wristband popped off when trying on for first time. Very difficult to wind. Will be returning for refund.
2.0,"Very cheap look and feel to it. I don't trust it to hold my time pieces. The hardware is nice, though, so I'll remove them and use paracord to create a new strap."
2.0,I had my earings for around 2 years and one of the blue stones fell out. I have to buy a new pair. they should give me a big discount.
2.0,Nice but pricey for the size.
2.0,the picture is wayyyyy smaller on the shirt than expected
2.0,"The style of the ring is pretty and simple but it weighs almost nothing. It's not substantial and feels like it came from a gumball machine, honestly. I'll keep it but I won't wear it often- wouldn't want to break it..."
2.0,"I thought these would be okay, I've purchased CZ's before and never had them look so cloudy and dull.  I wish I would have taken the time to return these as they are now just sitting in my jewelry box."
2.0,They lasted for 2 minutes before tearing apart.
2.0,Don't bother cute in person but shows every flaw you have if your 15 to 25 it'll work but if you have any flaws forget it
2.0,"This product is pretty un-wearable. The fabric has no give and no way to unfastened in order to get it on. Theres also 0 adjustability and the straps are way too long. Also because of the stiffness of the fabric, it lays in a super unflattering way. But to top it all off the fabric looks nothing like the picture. When I first opened it I thought they had sent the wrong item because it looked completely black. Even in direct light there is barely a hint of the colorful shine suggested in the picture."
2.0,Not sure if I got a damaged shirt -it is an iron on with letters peeling off -not vintage faded look as in pictures -I have this exact same shirt from another seller and this is no where near the same shirt or quality-do not recommend
2.0,"I really don’t like the material at all, wish it was like, cotton but it’s not. It’s also a lot larger than I imagined I’m 5’1 I ordered the smallest size and it’s def just too big and baggy."
2.0,The t bar is aluminum and I can easily bend it with my hands. This thing is not worth $30. You can just buy a pad lock and have higher security.<br /><br />It looks like this lock is basically the same thing but for a fraction of the cost and without the rubber lining: https://smile.amazon.com/EyezOff-Carabiner-Aluminum-Purpose-Combination/dp/B0716NNJVY/
2.0,They are falling apart and we haven't even worn them as yet. Very disappointed
2.0,"The quality seems ok for costume material, however they are very small. They should be marketed as kids or petite size. The feet maybe fit up to a size 7 shoe. They reach to the thighs, but have a very snug fit. I'm going to have to cut & alter them to fit."
2.0,They are not as comfortable as my sketcher shape ups and  they have not helped with my knee pain for my back pain. If anything the top of my feet and my knees are bothering me more .
2.0,"Not sure what caused my ears to get all swollen after wearing the eating for a day, but that was the first time something like that happened. Not a very pleasant experience"
2.0,"Super comfortable straight out of the box. Unfortunately, after only 2 months of ownership,  the leather surface began to peel away from the sole. Pretty disappointed that such a popular brand of sandal turned out to be so poorly made."
2.0,Sleeves were snug.
2.0,Not good quality. Not planning of using it and was planning to return but didn't allow me to return. So it will be waste of money.
2.0,"They’re cute, but mine came with the posts completely bent! I guess you get what you pay for?!  I’d rather spend more money on something that doesn’t damage so easily and most likely won’t make my ear turn green."
2.0,"LIGHTS WELL, BUT TOO DELICATE ON HANDLING AND WEAR"
2.0,"I've bought several pair of these pants & this is the 1st style I've received that I've been disappointed with. The material is so thin it's see through. I would NOT recommend wearing out of the house for modesty sake. I bought my usual size, Small, & this pair (Black #2) compresses nothing.  Still waiting for Navy #2 to be delivered. Hoping they aren't like the black ones..."
2.0,Seam started ripping the first time I wore it. Cute but not well made.
2.0,Didn't last after 2 use band busted...
2.0,"This shirt was made for someone with no chest, and narrow shoulders. My chest is small and it was still small on the chest but big on the waist and the shoulder width should be a bit more wide. The shirt is extremely translucent and the bow looks ridiculous compared to the woman in the photo. Returned."
2.0,Look like a fly
2.0,they forgot to send me the backings! so I had to spend money on more.  the thing looks nice. R'amen
2.0,"I bought this to wear to an informal bridal shower. It is made of very cheap material... like a thin, inexpensive cotton sheet. I bought the white with black... this color is definitely see through. It is a shame, because the dress fits nicely and the style is very pretty.  Now I'm planning to wear it as a beach cover-up over my swim suit."
2.0,Snap broke off on one side first time I used it.
2.0,"Looks pretty bad, it has no shape"
2.0,"It’s not very easy to use the projection feature. You can’t look through and view- you must use a pretty focused light, like cell phone flashlight. It’s challenging to get it lined up to stay focused and see the image."
2.0,"I bought it for the united basic economy flight which only allows one personal item. There was more space available. You could use two of these bags together. Also, the belt fitting is uncomfortable to carry around."
2.0,Fits way smaller then sizes suggest. I generally wear a large or x-large depending on the shirt. This however fit like a small. Couldn't button it up and it was hard to put on.
2.0,It has scratches on it. It even smells pretty bad and the chain looks old and smelly. The necklace was actually dirty as well.
2.0,"I have some very chubby thighs, and I have to wear fitted pants for work. I put these on and although they worked well at keeping my shirt tucked in, the thigh band was indenting my thighs, and the dent was visible through my pants. It was a little off-putting. I need to look presentable to the public, and having a weird dent in the middle of my thighs was not the look I was hoping for. I even tried loosening the thigh bands, and I still had an indentation.<br /><br />Will update my review once my uniform pants come in, but for now, I'll deal with having to tuck in my shirt constantly."
2.0,Can’t see / read the time in the dark
2.0,"This is definitely not comfortable material, very scratchy and see through. The cut of the dress and design is cute, but I returned."
2.0,Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. Perfect size but the &#34;leather&#34; is chipping and already falling apart.
2.0,"So long story short, my husband has a flannel jacket and my youngest wanted one too. We found a cute vest she liked, but sadly it wasn’t available in her size. So I did a search for “girls flannel jacket” and this came up. I guess I should have looked at it better because what I assumed was a jacket, turned out to be a THIN AS HELL LONG SLEEVED T-SHIRT WITH A HAT! 😑 Not what we expected at all! She is however, very into plaid right now so since she still likes it as a shirt I’m letting her keep it. Not happy I paid so much for just a shirt when I thought I was getting her a jacket to wear outside but whatever. She’s happy, however, I wanted to make sure future buyers are aware this is SUPER THIN and most definitely NOT a jacket as described. Yes it says shirt too, I’m aware, but I didn’t notice that before today. It happens, but in case someone else misses that in the title, maybe this review will help them know for sure what this is BEFORE they buy it."
2.0,The brim is very wide and was a bit floppy. If your trying to lean back in a beach chair it wants to push the front of the hat up. Only good thing is that it does not make my head hot.
2.0,Really weird fit on me...almost felt stretched out a bit. Material is not very good. Returned it same day.
2.0,"Disappointed with the quality of this earmuff.<br />Very thin, didn't even use it for a week and the white wooly thing from inner surface started to tear off!!<br />Not meant for harsh winters."
2.0,Blue butterfly stone fell off after only 2 weeks of wear..
2.0,The product color started to fade after few weeks on the vehicle
2.0,The fabric is cheap and the sewing is awful just out of the bag I could tell it wasn’t going to be good but I tried it on anyway just to see and it’s awful the worst part being that the crop of the top is extraordinarily short I couldn’t even shrug my shoulders without the top popping up over my bra don’t buy this!
2.0,Runs VERY small. Plan on ordering 3-4 sizes up. If you're tall - I'm 5'8&#34;- this dress will be short on you.
2.0,Very thin material and it was small through the arms.
2.0,I'd have sent it back but the shipping would have been as much as the shirt.  Being polyester it snags really easily.  I'm very disappointed that the color isn't at all like the picture.  It's a medium steel blue.  :(
2.0,"Uncomfortable, didn't get return insurance and ate the cost"
2.0,"These pants get 2 stars for softness. The fit is super awkward!!! I am 5'4 and 105 lbs, and ordered xs. Looked like maternity pants, but with a tighter fit around the tummy. They literally reached up to my bra. But were too tight around the hips to sag a little."
2.0,cheaply made-broke the first time it was used
2.0,Short and very wide.
2.0,"Two issues with the product,<br />1) It's fitting is cheap, odd & funny at the same time<br />2) Material is thin & not feel great to the skin<br /> Only a positive point is the colour was good."
2.0,Good lightweight but kinda tent like...and sooooo short!
2.0,"No, too small - virtually invisible"
2.0,My husband not happy
2.0,"One size fits all... Bull.<br />I'm 6'1&#34;, and the jumpsuit is about 4 inches too short...<br /><br />The material is pretty cheap too, thin like a table cloth..."
2.0,cheap plastic cap for eyeball and it turns your finger green. disapppointed
2.0,"When I open the bag and saw it I was very disappointed, the ball it’s not dark black or neither the name it looks liked off green ."
2.0,"I really wanted to love this dress. The colors are great, love the pattern, however it's very cheaply made for the price I paid ($26). Not lined. 1 step above Halloween costume fabric. I'm 5'7"" and it's too short, 3 inches below my groin. The fabric wasn't cut to consider the pattern, so the front top half of the dress is all pink with a tiny piece of green leaf before it's sewn to the bottom half of the dress that has a ton of leaves. Looks disjointed and carelessly put together."
2.0,I ordered dark green and red. The dark green is more of a dark teal/blue than green.
2.0,They both face the same direction...making one look silly... like its backwards...
2.0,"So sad, love the dress but it is so see through I would not wear it. The material is so thin. Will be returning."
2.0,"For being boot cut, they are short. Not as tight as inted them."
2.0,The overalls were super cute. My daughter wears a 6/7 and the size 6 fit well. But they broke on the 3rd time she wore them (the part that latches onto the front button fell off) and I’m past the return window.
2.0,Took for ever to arrive and looks very cheap
2.0,"Clip broke on first use. Leather is good quality though, just not reliable."
2.0,The material was really cheap and felt itchy when I put it on.  It was also small on the chest super baggy on the rest of my torso.
2.0,Seems to be cheaply made
2.0,The band broke after only a few weeks of wearing it.
2.0,"I originally purchased this bra (and other colors of this bra) in a size large and it fit well, but it also stretched out pretty quickly, so I decided to size down to a medium.  When the medium arrived, however, the material (not the cup part, the mesh part) was completely different than that used in the larger sizes, specifically, if was a tighter mesh that stretched less than the mesh used in the large sizes. So the effect was that I not only sized down, but has less stretch, making it a bit too tight, really. I ordered another to see if that was a fluke, but the 2nd medium also came in the tighter, less giving mesh. Hence, 2 stars only since the material deviated from my original purchase of this product."
2.0,"Supposedtobe black, they are dark gray.  Not happy!!!!"
2.0,"So when I received this hat, I found the size and warmth factor to be what one might expect.  The color is accurate to what is advertised, and it seems fairly well made. The only complaint I have with it is that, when you put the flaps up, they stand straight up instead of curving with the contours of the hat, which looks pretty weird. And since I intend to wear this with the flaps up most of the time, this thing is going to look strange and out of place.  A quick sew job should fix the problem, but that shouldn't be the case with a hat of this sort."
2.0,These broke the first day my son had them on and he was home running around with us so I know they weren't mistreated. Very disappointed with this product.
2.0,"I read it was adjustable.  I was trying to adjust it and the tail snapped off, I had it about two seconds.  Very disappointed.  It's also silver plating so that means it's going to rub off if you wear it every day.  Like I said, very disappointed and as much as I want the ring, I'm not ordering it again."
2.0,Its definitely not padded I will probably be returning for that reason and its poorly sewn a few times in the wash it will be in pieces
2.0,Toe ring broke before I could put it on. Adjusted a tiny bit to put it on my toe and it broke.
2.0,"Disappointed by quality, the lining of shirt was a different peach color which made pink material look funny. Peach lining on a light pink sheer??😩yuck"
2.0,Dissatisfied with the color of the necklace. It is not pink or hot pink like the picture shows. It’s a pastel pink and I ordered two to match my daughters pink baseball uniforms.
2.0,"Changed colors, turned black..."
2.0,"The r on mother isnt visible so it just reads "" God mothe"" ....terrible"
2.0,Material is super thin and fits small.
2.0,You can’t get anything on this dress. I’d you sweat is coming through!!!!
2.0,"I know everyone says this, but I seriously NEVER write reviews.  I feel called to do so for this product due to the fact that when purchasing these earrings I looked at the reviews and the product was rated highly.  I received the earrings quickly- about 2 days.  I put them on and I LOVED them.  Unfortunately, less than two hours later that clasp had broken/loosened on one of the earrings.  I cannot wear them now without one falling out.  I am super disappointed and feel cheated out of my money."
2.0,WAY smaller than I had thought. I thought these would be big and chunky like costume jewelry. But they are tiny. Still very pretty but not what I was looking for.
2.0,I returned these because they run small !
2.0,"I ordered an XL for my husband, it fits my 8.5 year old son! It’s like an adult small"
2.0,"Lighting works well.  Band  virtually unuseable. Plan on buying a REAL band, along with your purchase.<br />Stock band is a 3-handed proposition, not worth the effort.<br />Had it for months now. Tritium is fine, but DATE is constantly off. Revising review down.<br />It keeps time fine. If you opt for CHEAPO Tritium, this is the one."
2.0,"The watch looked ok, as soon as I opened it up I was disappointed but that may be personal taste.  I wore it once and all was fine but the next time I put it on I noticed the time was about 10 minutes fast then I went to reset the time and the screw was gone, broke off.  Of the many watches I have owned over the years this is the first time something like this has happened, I'm not hard on watches.  I actually bought it cheaper directly from the company so had to send it back to them but honestly I will not buy this brand of watch again."
2.0,"It's a good-looking watch, but it needs to be constantly worn if it is not to stop keeping time. Besides, after 11 months of infrequent use, it stopped working. Most cheap watches seem not to last very long, so this is unfortunately no exception."
2.0,Pretty but very itchy!
2.0,"1. The watchband fell apart in three different places and had to be super glued together three times in the first week I had it.  2. The timepiece itself is nice-looking and at first glance appears (by it's weight alone if nothing else) to be well made, but set it, and a week later it's about 2-2 1/2 minutes fast.  3. Also, this watch comes with absolutely 0, zilch, nada, cero, null, and diddly squat in terms of paperwork/instructions/warranty; just a watch in bubble wrap, in a box.....not a very classy move, but, I mean, it is a $25 watch."
2.0,"I bought the size 8, but it isn't really size 8... It's probably a 7. A little annoying. Doesn't fit my fingers"
2.0,"So I totally get that this watch was a 30$ budget piece of equipment, and I wasn't expecting the highest of quality from it, but I was expecting a little more than I got. I've worn the watch for approximately one month of normal every day wear, and on the the straps broke, and the &quot;genuine leather&quot; is peeling like crazy, leaving an ugly light brown undercoat. The watch image also led me to believe that this watch was waterproof (which if is not) leaving a foggy watch for multiple days if you get it wet. Don't get me wrong, it's a beautful looking watch, just don't expect a great quality."
2.0,"Product is so cute in present. But what good is that to me if I order a 4x (size 28) and get a size 18. Must send it back, waste of my valuable time,"
2.0,"Cute shirt but runs small, fabric has no give to it."
2.0,These tights didn't stay up very well on their own.  They're very thin (more like pantyhose than tights) and the tops tended to roll down on themselves.  Had to keep adjusting them to stay up.
2.0,Going to give this away. Pit it on my head and its more constructing than anything.
2.0,Cute but the quality is better suited for a teenager
2.0,It's looks good!
2.0,Arms too tight!
2.0,Product felt very cheap.
2.0,4 pack of sunglasses two bent. Smh 😡 I guess you get what you pay for !!
2.0,"Nice necklace, but it came with a bendable piece of metal that attaches the necklace together. Almost as if it broke and someone took a piece of wire to bring the pieces together. Check out the picture."
2.0,I purchased a 3x and it is maybe barely a size large in the fit.
2.0,"Liked this a lot when it arrived. It's slightly cheap material, but the production quality is the problem. The straps were already fraying and the button for the chest area came ripped. Had to send back.<br /><br />Also, for sizing it was perfect for me but I have a small torso. Straps adjust so it can work for a variety of sizes."
2.0,Very cheaply made. Wont buy these again.
2.0,I like the length - but it really does look cheap.
2.0,Broke on second wear.
2.0,Blouse is very small . Shorts are very large . Not good quality . They are cute tho
2.0,Nice material but way too large
2.0,I was only able to wear it twice. No longer sticky.
2.0,"This chain is far too fragile. Mine broke the first time I tried to wear it. And it's so delicate that it's incredibly difficult to fix. Even if you can, it will likely continue to break. I would not recommend."
2.0,"These are ridiculously narrow. I have medium-width feet, but they are a full inch too narrow. Also, they are magenta/fuschia, not burgundy."
2.0,Cute but all started falling apart as soon as they were opened. I've tried hot glue gunning the pieces back on but they don't stay 😕
2.0,Rides up legs very easily
2.0,Very nice but does not stay in place. Disappointing ....
2.0,I bought a size XXL and they fit more like a size or two smaller. I wasn't too happy about that. But the quality of the leggings are perfect. Exactly like the photo.
2.0,"They are way too tight.  Purchased these for our grandson, who is not quite 2 and they are super super tight.  I believe they go up to age 10 or something, which I can't imagine with how tight they are on a 2 year old!"
2.0,It's cute but the emerald part looks pretty cheesy...
2.0,"A little too loose and maybe a tad too short in the waist (like I felt I wanted to pull them up a little higher but couldn't).  Waist was too loose but then the calves were too snug.  So I felt like I'd be constantly pushing down the pant leg because if I bent or sat, the leg would creep up a bit and get stuck.  I feel I have pretty small calves or least right for the size I'm ordering.  So to have the waist be loose and calves too tight made these a miss.  Kind of cute and I think I would have liked them and kept them if they fit properly.  I felt they did have give in the fabric despite being lined, but alas, no go."
2.0,Designs on socks are different than those advertised.
2.0,I loved my cute Halloween watch.  After only wearing a week the pattern just peeled off on the edges.
2.0,It got 2 stars because the color was great. It really isn't worth it though.  Thr magnetic piece did not work well. And thr mesh links would catch on my clothing and pull off.
2.0,App doesn't work
2.0,material of poor quality...
2.0,needs to be dry cleaned to remove wrinkles.
2.0,"I bought this primarily for its organizational design. I also liked the design/colors to go with a new Kate Spade leather handbag that I purchased. While the organizational function is great, this is definitely not leather. It feels and smells like cheap vinyl or plastic. I think I will return it if I can find a real leather wallet with a similar design. The seller should not describe this as genuine leather."
2.0,"THE EARRINGS HAD THE SCREW ON BACKS THAT I WANTED BUT ONE OF THE EARRINGS WAS ""MIS-SHAPEN"". THIS WILL NOT BE NOTICED ON THE WEARER BUT IT WAS A LITTLE ANNOYING."
2.0,"I didn't like the quality of the product specially the material of the tutu, it looks really cheap."
2.0,"Cute product, quality material, very pretty color...however the torso is child size. Seriously. Unless your torso is a foot long you might want to reconsider!!"
2.0,"Pros:<br />The color is a rich purple which is just what I wanted.<br />It is warm and comfortable.<br />I am able wear it under jackets and a coat without feeling that my outerwear is too bulky.<br />The seams are well done.<br />The ties are braided cord with protective plastic around the ends to lessen fraying.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The hood is too large so that when using the ties the hood slips over my forehead.<br />After one washing in cold water and drying at the permanent press setting, it came out with terrible pilling like would be found with an inexpensive sweater might.  I have fleece sweat shirts and pants that I have had for over 20 years that have never shown any pilling.<br /><br />For such an expensive item, I am very disappointed that the material is badly flawed."
2.0,Style looks great on but the quality is not so good. The seems come apart easily and some of the buttons were not aligned properly on 2 of the caps.
2.0,"Like the design, comes in more than one. But it was to tight."
2.0,"Ordered a size up, per the suggestion of other reviews.  Top is way too small; pants are too big.  If I went up 2 sizes, the top would likely fit, but the pants would be ginormous.  Belt also does not stay taut.  This could otherwise have been a pretty decent costume."
2.0,"Picture is beautiful but the plastic clip that holds it to the key ring was cheap and opened very easily. It kept falling off and I was glad that I noticed because then I could find it. Now, the last time it fell off I wasn’t aware and it’s lost. Therefore I’m very disappointed. Seller/manufacturer needs to change to a stronger clasp to hold key chain picture to the key ring. I would be happy if they just sent me a new picture and a clasp but there’s no option for that. Disappointing as this product is hard to find anywhere else."
2.0,The outer plastic cracked in the first two weeks. I  have purchased many sojos. Mostly great stuff for the price.
2.0,This suit is true to size. I really like the style and color. But it arrived dirty on the top. Flaw is you can see the cups through the front fabric. Cups also are too much of a cone madonna bra style. So I have to return.
2.0,"The jewels popped off the jewelry immediately. I can glue them back on, but I’m pretty disappointed at how cheap the entire thing is. My daughter was so excited to have it, but now won’t even wear it because it’s so itchy."
2.0,"I REALLY wanted this bag to work.  The design is spot on -- minimal, no big brand names, heavy/sturdy fabric -- and it has a great price.  Unfortunately, right out of the box I found a ripped seem.  Then I realized the shoe pocket won't open all the way because a small part of the liner fabric is sewn into the zipper.  I will try an exchange to see if I just got a lemon...but the possibility exists that it's just poorly manufactured."
2.0,did not like the fit
2.0,It didn't work for me so I'm sending it back.
2.0,Queda demasiado estrecho en la parte de abajo
2.0,It was ok but very hard to style.
2.0,"the mazda logo fell off the minute after coming out of the plastic bag, I have to put super glue to fix it"
2.0,The number 4 came off the top before the end of her birthday party☹️she was sad
2.0,This listing is for four pairs of earrings but I only received one pair.
2.0,"Sizes run small, perfect for littler ankle sizes, breaks fairly easily. You get what you pay for."
2.0,The pattern on the backside is upside down. The background color is more of a vintage beige (weird) than an off white or natural beige. I kept it as it unexpectedly went well with rust colored pants.
2.0,"This is a &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; product.  Actually I paid $19 and that is too expensive.  These are at best gas station glasses.  Sweat will remove the film.  I bought in November and Today in July they're junk.  I would not buy these again, but I will buy another $15 pair.  I don't mind buying new ones once a year, but don't expect these to be top of the line."
2.0,Broke on first time wearing.
2.0,"The fit of these capris are great, but I'm sad to say they did not pass the &#34;bend over&#34; test. I have a small waist but large butt and thighs. So, in order for my workout pants to fit well in the waist and not slip down I order medium. (I am 5' 2&#34; 157lbs) I have trouble finding ones that are not see through when I bend over because of this. Sadly I returned them."
2.0,"These break super easily. I recognize they were inexpensive, but I would expect the side pieces to not snap off so quickly."
2.0,looks bad.. so I don't use this one in public.
2.0,"Not much I liked, cheap clips that wouldn’t stay on and hard to get over head because they were so short."
2.0,like the look and feel of this sunglasses.  Frames cheaply made.  Broke after a couple weeks.
2.0,"Well first of all I’d like to say that it’s warm, but only if I could use it. The hat is way too small for my big head. So if you have a big head don’t bother buying it because the hat doesn’t fit and the scarf part is going to be very tight to pull your head through it."
2.0,They smell terrible! Took two washings to get rid of chemical smell
2.0,bracelet was to small could not close clasep.
2.0,They're great... Until they snap. I've broken 3 or 4 so far. The seam at the bottom under the shoe is so weak and poorly made.... Really wish there was another option.
2.0,The color was so light pink and I was expecting darker like the picture shows.
2.0,"I returned it.  Didn't fit at all.  My othher ACEVOG dress fits perfectly, so I was VERY disappointed."
2.0,"Love the ring but its sharp points get caught on clothing and lift up.  I'll try to find something that's engraved, instead."
2.0,"Cute font, soft material but the printing is horrible. I have the red shirt and the lettering is suppose to be white but it arrived looking faded and looks pink. :( Really Bummed hoping this would be my go-to mommy shirt but maybe the other colors came out better than the red"
2.0,"I purchased several (5) tops from this brand at one time, and all but one is a total waste of. Pulled them out of their packages and immediately washed according to instructions... cold on delicate cycle and hung to dry... the worst shrinkage I have ever seen!!! Not the fixable kind, either. The fabric was NOT preshrunk before cutting and stitching the pattern together, that’s for sure. TotL waste of money and very disappointing, since they looked cute out of the package. This one in particular shrunk up so much that  it went from swimming on my xl body to being too small for my size M neighbor!"
2.0,Cute but nowhere near true to size. I ordered a large and it fit like an extra small.
2.0,For a guy with a hat size of 8. They fit really nicely. However they broke the third time i took them off my head. Just fell apart like it was a joke.
2.0,"Product arrived as scheduled, however, My fiance' wore it twice and it started to pull apart for no reason. Not very impressed with the workmanship."
2.0,Too tight on a thighs
2.0,I normally wear size small and these fit more like an extra small.
2.0,"Unless you have the body pictured in the description, it’s not going to look flattering at all. Odd fit. Chest area is too big and hip area is baggy. Returned."
2.0,Was disappointed it really holds only one hair band. The bands fit very tight and it takes long strong nails to take them offf the bracelet
2.0,"Package states to wash before first use, i did and after it dried and was finally putting it on, i notice a tear. Very dissapointing."
2.0,The dress is cheaply made with material that is see through.
2.0,Cute bag but lining fabric is very poor quality. I would not recommend this purse.
2.0,"The print on the shirt is amazing, and I was so excited to try it on. This fabric is thin, but somehow so incredibly stiff and has ZERO stretch or give to it. If you are even remotely chesty, this WILL NOT work out at all. The bottom of the shirt that sits at your waist will not come down over your boobs. Luckily I handed it to my daughter and it fit her just fine."
2.0,Pretty but paint wore off after a day
2.0,"Bad material, they're all nylon and that's was not what I was looking for. They're also super long, which isn't normally a problem for me because I'm 5'8&#34; and pretty much all leg."
2.0,Shirt came with burn hole in it. Big black burn mark with a hole in the middle
2.0,Came tarnished.  Very disappointing.
2.0,"These are regular tanks. I was expecting compression, since that word was in the description. I am disappointed because there is absolutely no firmness or stiffness to these shirts at all. I was going to wear them as added support for when I work out. But these will not work for that purpose."
2.0,I got a 2x after reading the fit guidelines and I'd say the 2x fits a 10-12
2.0,They don’t stay in.
2.0,Not what  I expected  for what I paid
2.0,Definitely not what I thought product would be. It appears 3 dimensional in image but it is flat as a pancake and not worth the price. Would not buy had I known it was a flat disk
2.0,This outfit has nice material and I got a nice color. I went down a size to a small and it is still baggy in areas. I will try to wash it a few times and see if it shrinks some 🤷🏽‍♀️
2.0,I got an XL and the Dress was too short and tight.
2.0,"I don't know how no other reviews mention that the lining of the front pockets show through the pants as if there were socks tucked down the front. There is no way at all to hide this. Big, bulky lines. Really disappointed."
2.0,The product was too large. I had to return it based on the size and the fact that it was also not as thick as I expected based on the comments.
2.0,"The sizing was fine with this. The order took longer than expected to receive, which also wasn't a problem. My main disappointment is with the shape of the batman, which I think is ironed on, it came wrinkled so it just doesn't look great."
2.0,"I started out loving this watch. It’s a great design that doesn’t look or feel cheap. I thought it was a definite keeper right out of the box. Figuring out how to set the time and date wasn’t very difficult. The band was decent quality, but not top quality. Within one day after initially setting the watch I noticed that it seemed to have lost several seconds. I never owned an automatic watch before so I wasn’t sure if that was normal.  I reset the time and followed all of the instructions provided on what to do to get the watch properly wound. Hoping for the best, after several days, I checked the accuracy of the time-keeping  again. In about a week’s time it had lost over 1 minute. Definitely a bad sign! In my opinion, the accuracy of the time-keeping is the number one quality in a watch. I wasn’t looking merely for a piece of jewelry. I couldn’t keep a watch that was going to lose upwards of an hour a year. Though I really liked the appearance and feel of the watch, I had to return it. I think this brand has the potential for excellence. Hopefully they will work on this very important quality aspect. What’s the point of a timepiece if it doesn’t keep accurate time?"
2.0,Not as expected. I felt it was not a true “plus” size. It was returned.
2.0,Good for the money but much bigger than I thought
2.0,"Looking for a nice piece of fabric that can be barely be classified as a crop top because it's THAT small? this is the top for you! I truly appreciate the material, but the rest of it was a complete miss. I am a 32DDD, 178lb, 5'6"" woman who is securely built. I have been dabbling in the crop top fad, and thought this would be a complete hit... The ruffle hem hit at my nipples. Now, granted, I have birthed and breastfed 2 children, but my boobies are not THAT low. I also wear push up bras with a little padding. This is receiving 2 stars for the sole fact that when I walked out with it on to show my husband, he laughed so hard, his vodka red bull came shooting out his nose. The burning sensation from the mixture did not go away for quite awhile. His pure misery and laughter, and grumbling, made my day far more enjoyable than I could have imagined. Also, after he recovered from his minor trauma, his one liners about the top made for a good hour in a half conversation between us."
2.0,Something about the way they make these wario hats and the dye being paler than what wario is actually supposed to look like throws me off… I will be returning this.<br /><br />Also it cane with this unnecessary keychain. No.
2.0,Cute but cut small
2.0,Don't see any result.
2.0,"Sleves small,not use again.can<br />not help had only one size to compare to"
2.0,Quality just ok...noticed the buckle is broken and my daughter hasn’t worn these for all that long.
2.0,I have this same Lucky Brand Tropic model in black. The joint where the arms bend is poor quality and the arms are not straight when fully extended - too wide. This makes the glasses fall off easily.
2.0,It's very discolored and smelled horrible. It was so hard and stuck together when it arrived it took forever to get unstuck I have had to let it soak for ever to get it unstuck . Not sure if it will work right but we will try it on the next jeep run..not worth trying to send back !
2.0,"The daisy is the thick plastic, im 5'10"" size large and the arms are way to short."
2.0,This is just a piece of thin unfinished fabric! Not worth more than $1.99.
2.0,"The coat was very stylish, but the right shoulder ripped after only wearing it five times.  And, as others mentioned, the zipper was defective and I had to use the draw &#34;string&#34; around the middle. VERY DISAPPOINTING.  I ordered a medium and it fit as expected."
2.0,The chain snags on everything. I didn't want to even take the chance of using it while I had my nice dress on. Will be returning.
2.0,Shorts spot on top fits small
2.0,This product is not true to size 😔
2.0,Wish it was made better.
2.0,"Love the coat. However, within a month, the zipper pull broke. I am not able to fix it.  What to do...ho hum.  You cannot pull the zipper down."
2.0,"I bought one size up and were still on the small side. Also they are seamless so the fit is not good at all. Seamed tights fit much better, will not buy seamless again. Save your money and look for a pair that are seamed, these will not fit your butt correct at all. O well live an learn. But if you like seamless they did come on time"
2.0,"Doesn't look like the same colors, as in pic. Very thin and cheaply made."
2.0,Returned this item and don't know if i ever recieveb a refund<br />-
2.0,I choosse a Médium aire and is really small
2.0,Very cute but broke after 2 months of light use
2.0,"Not very good, short and quality is just soso, I dont like the packaging, its casual"
2.0,"These masks didn’t cover my babies face, they were not conforming to there noise and cheeks, it looked like thin cardboard with straps around their ears. I ended up buying different masks"
2.0,"Tried out for my spouse who is 6’3, 180lbs and was a little snug and short. Obviously will fit fine for average height male, but if y’all go up a size!"
2.0,"I was eager to receive this item but it turned out to be not what I thought it was. I was expecting more of a plush filled hat.Kind of like a soft helmet that'd sit on top of your head.  Instead, it was a hollow saggy hat. As if kirby was supposed to fit on your face ike a mask, since your head could be inserted all the way inside.  The fit was very tight and headache-inducing after a couple minutes. Wound up returning due to the uncomfortable fit. It wasnt what I hoped it would be. Maybe some day someone will design what I was expecting."
2.0,Strange fabric. Very thin. Sent it back
2.0,The product is too rigid and difficult to remove once plugged
2.0,A couple of buttons were missing. They shrunk a lot after washing.
2.0,disc colored
2.0,"I like the color and that is had a layer so it’s not see through, but it’s a little larger than I expected. Doesn’t look flattering"
2.0,Very cheaply made and not the nice terrycloth I had expected.  Would not by again.
2.0,These are a nice size but cheap.  One of the posts was already bent when I got them.  The backing so small I thought I was going to lose it.  I have bought earrings from Amazon before and they were great.  The last pair and these are not.
2.0,I had high hopes for the dress.  I ordered according to my size (size 4) and it was way too small for me.  The arm holes were way too tight at my armpits and I could not even get the dress over my head.  It felt cheaply made and just not cute for a grown woman.
2.0,"This picture is just a few weeks of wear- lint is from a blanket in the dryer, does hold onto lint and has to be rolled a lot which is annoying but more annoying is that the stitching came undone so quickly! These pants were so comfortable I bought four different styles. Wish I had waited to purchase more."
2.0,The product did not fit proportionally for me.
2.0,"The outfit is really cute, just looks and feels cheaply made."
2.0,Cute but ripped at the seam as soon as my daughter put it on
2.0,"My daughter ordered these and most had red spots all over the stem and were missing half the white spots.  If the seller would send us a new package at no cost, then we could offset the bad ones.  The ones that looked good were cute.  Hopefully they will answer here?"
2.0,"This is not an infinity scarf. It is a regular scarf that is open at the ends. It is also made cheaply, feels and acts like tissue paper."
2.0,I thought this was for a growd person. R theses real?
2.0,Hoodie runs small..returned
2.0,"Jumpsuit is somewhat small in the crotch - - I compared it to other rompers I have purchased.  Although the sizes are the same, this romper has a peculiar fit.  Other than that, I like the style, color and price.  I will probable gift the jumpsuit to a family member - - I like it enough to share it as opposed to sending it back."
2.0,Came with a hole in the seem over a inch long and smelled of smoke.
2.0,"As soon as I put a pair in the stem for my ear broke, was pissed"
2.0,Sent back. Looked cheap.
2.0,Well all I have to say is NEVER WASH this product. It will fall apart. So that's why I'm giving this 2 stars I wore it once down in Mexico and it was comfortable and baggy. But it's nothing really special.
2.0,Holes in several pairs.
2.0,"I was leery because this was a winter jacket with a bargain price and after initially liking it I sent it back. I'm 5'9&#34; and about a regular (not plus) 14-16. The fit was too large and the pockets were oddly placed and uncomfortable to shove my hands in the old Chicago winters. I thought the price would win out as the ultimate positive. However one button popped off immediately and another followed a few days later. Given the ill fit, weird pockets and now two buttons to sew back on with more likely to pop off soon, I had enough and back it goes."
2.0,It’s too big and does not look good in person
2.0,Loved it when I first got it but after washing and drying as per the instructions the dress shrunk and it’s over an in shorter and a lot more hugging now.
2.0,No wear for it say this jacket has Pink Ladies  across its back.
2.0,"I like the case. The zipper is very lightweight and comes apart (separates, not unzips)."
2.0,"This product does a good job slimming and smoothing areas. The only downside to this product was it is not good for petite women like me with short torso's. The waist cinching band only covers the rib area, not the lower tummy that I needed held in, otherwise the band is really good at holding everything in place, I just wish that portion came down longer to give the proper coverage."
2.0,Super high cut. Not for long torsos!
2.0,"After researching (I thought) my 3 yr-old tortoise shell Jonathan-Paul Fitovers--a birthday gift from 3 yrs ago--I purchased what I though to be a replacement (patent # on the original temple brought up nothing in Google search). Based on Amazon's photo, the brand ""Jonathan-Paul, and description and advertised as ""Jumbo"" fit, I purchased my new ""Fitovers"" here.  All I can say is *do not purchase* these $29.00 ""Fitovers"" if you are expecting the same quality. These glasses might fit a child, but not an adult. Especially over regular Rx glasses. Additionally, the nose bridge of this new model has such a sharp edge that it begins to hurt after only 5 minutes of wear, and doesn't fit over my regular Rx glasses as advertised. So for those on this page considering J-P Fitovers, better to spend twice the money at the real ""Jonathan-Paul Fitovers"" website (later discovered after purchase). The originals are worth the $69.00+ price tag and are so much better product all the way around. And watch out for insect repellent; it can dissolve the lens' tint on any pair of glasses (see: 1st attached photo). So I am attaching 3 photos total to exemplify--the darker glasses are the new ""Fitovers"".  Photo #2 above note V-shape nose bridge on dark new ones vs. older U-shape. Photo #3 my new glasses fit inside the old ones."
2.0,"I normally wear a medium but after reading every review, I felt it was safe to order a small. It fits in the arms and length but it isn't form fitting in the least! It makes me look pregnant and from the side is NOT cute! I got this for family photos on the beach so I'm paying someone to take in the sides to make it a little more appealing! It will be really cute and perfect for pictures in the water and on the sand which is why am paying extra to have it fixed. But it really isn't worth all the money and effort!"
2.0,"Size was way off, I couldn’t try it on"
2.0,The clasp is very flimsy.  It broke the minute I put it on.
2.0,"It's a lovely shirt,  and the fit is exact. However, I ordered the blue flowered but received the maroon flowered. Being that blue was the selling point for me, but I received the wrong color, I wish thinks could be different."
2.0,"Muy corto de largo, esperaba que se viera como en la foto, que tapara el zapato"
2.0,Looked cool until the gem fell out
2.0,I found it way too tight for an adult plus didn't care for the wet area around the mouth that forms from it smoothering me
2.0,"I loved this dress! Unfortunately, it arrived with a hole in it.  :( So, I returned it. It fit me great and was thin but I felt the dress would fall apart fast."
2.0,once again. cheaply made and too short.  maybe my little girl can wear it.
2.0,Cheaply made and they broke
2.0,"These are very cute and easy to attach to a bracelet, but they fall off so fast it’s hardly worth the trouble. What a disappointment."
2.0,Cute style. Not the greatest quality. Took 6 weeks to get which is ridiculous.
2.0,"Lint was all over my clothes from the sweater, wouldn't get another color even though the fit was great"
2.0,Came late of course because it's Amazon. I still wish they had short sleeves since it's shorts. Don't expect them to last more then a few washes as the material is so easy to rip.
2.0,its not what you show me in the picture
2.0,These are so long that they go two inches above my knees and so are unwearable.
2.0,Has only 1 strap not 2. the main reason I chose this one was for the 2 straps in which would cover more stomach not just partial stomach. So they need to take down the main picture indicating it has 2 straps because it doesn't. Very disappointed.. Other then that material And fabric seem good 🤷🏻‍♀️Oh and no stretch in the martial
2.0,I bought this bag for my 11 year old middle schooler because they are only aloud to carry drawstring bags this year. The 2 or 3ed day of school the bag broke. The material of the bag itself is so thin and weak that the string literally ripped through the bag.
2.0,It's nice but it was a little too big and would constantly flip around throughout the day hiding the photo. But it was good to put a lot of things in.
2.0,The waistband is too tight and very uncomfortable! And the ankle ones are too loose. They are so comfy so its very disappointing.
2.0,This was labeled as Asian sizes. It came in and was clearly not Asian sized it was huge!!! I look like I am wearing a tent!!
2.0,left black stuff in my earlobes after  a week =/
2.0,If she didn’t need this for the next day I probably would return it. It is definitely not as dark or bright of green as it shows in the picture.
2.0,For the price they are alright. They are dyed so pink dye leaks out onto your skin and pillows... the o ring slot is not deep and they sent me the wrong size rings causing them to fall out a lot. When I was driving the other day I felt something hit my lap and assumed one had just fallen out but one had actually broke in half IN MY EAR and that was the back half hitting my leg.
2.0,This wig started falling apart as soon as I took it out of the package. I guess I got what I payed for.
2.0,"If you're looking for something that looks like the picture, you've come to the wrong place. This shirt appears as though it will be a nice burt orange color and baggy. It is bright orange. Like ORANGE. It's my favorite color, but was not expecting it to be so bright based on the photos. It also doesn't hang as baggy/oversized as I would like. Do yourself a favor and just spend a couple more dollars to get something worth it. It looks and feels cheaply made. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
2.0,"it was to large for my wife, i made a mistake for not to do research about it, she gave away this sunglasses because it was not fits her face."
2.0,way to heavy to put in my ears
2.0,The arms are tight and I’m afraid if I order the next size up the shrug will hang funny...
2.0,Looked ok but really uncomfortable I had to add more of the mold to add some comfort still didn't really fit my mouth mabye someone else but it wasnt right for me I'm just going to stick with my old set for now until I find a new one.
2.0,Covers a bad do day
2.0,Super cute swim suit. I love the coverage of this suit. However The cups in the top were super weird. Unfortunately you can’t take them out easily either. So I sent it back. Bottoms were good.
2.0,One side is shiny and the other side is tarnished. This was meant to be a birthday gift for my 20 year old daughter. I paid more for fast shipping on the Pandora necklace for her Birthday on 1/11/21
2.0,"I like the way these briefs fit.  Unfortunately, two of them were improperly sewn at waist and Seller will not respond to my concern."
2.0,Adjusting and removing the pins from the links was very difficult. The little kit it came with was almost useless as some of the pins were so difficult to remove the tools bent.<br /><br />I had to use a dedicated watch kit to get it right. If you don’t have that as a backup look for something else or add the cost of a kit to this.<br /><br />All that being said my wife really likes it.
2.0,"I really like the pattern and color of the fabric, but the dress was not very well made and there was a seam that had ripped/shredded the fabric when it arrived.  Belt is not attached and there are no belt loops.  Overall, okay dress if it had been less expensive, but not worth $36."
2.0,"I travel a bit and have been in Chicago, NY, NC, and other freezing places. This kept my head and neck nice and warm. My issue is that the sewing on the beanie cap is not symmetrical as far as the sewing patterns and lines. It’s like you bought a baseball cap and the adjustment straps on the back is not aligned in the back and off to the side.  The neck cover has come apart in several places between the knitted material and the plush material.  I’ve only worn it 10-15 times.  It still works for now, but I don’t think it will last very long.  I received this as a gift from my friend that knew I’d be traveling to cold places. I gave 2 stars because it is falling apart with very minimal usage."
2.0,The dress is nice but I thought it would be better quality. It felt like a WalMart dress. I didn’t like the colors. They were bland. The picture was beautiful but I got a totally different dress. It’s ok. I will think twice before ordering a dress like this on Amazon.
2.0,These were really tight and small on my sons feet. They look really cute but he could only wear them a couple of times before they were too small. I would size up.
2.0,"I ordered this so I can use it when I travel to a construction site to wear under my hard hat.  Unfortunately, it was too big and too loose on my head.  I have a big head too so this is oversized XL.  Thank goodness for Amazon returns and I got my money back."
2.0,I ordered this product because I love the look and color. The information stated it was true to size. I ordered a medium. It was huge. Now I’m outside my window to return on Amazon. So sad because it is a great sweater.
2.0,"Very thick, but too long."
2.0,"Scratchy material, size not true to match. Feels like an area rug on."
2.0,Right out of the box the band was loose on both sides. Looks kinda cheap.
2.0,I was not happy with is item. It looked cheap from I received it. And it was to small for anyone in my family to wear. No sizes listed in the description.
2.0,Nice quality scarfs although the white one did come with a black spot on it.
2.0,"It for us looked to run large from what we expected. Also, the material looked a bit inexpensive actually. If one were handy with alterations they maybe able to use it. But it in no way is what we expected per the description and other reviews or from the pictures, -- it was a disappointing waste of time, effort and money from how we experienced this."
2.0,Not light weight and not too comfortable at all
2.0,"Not saying it wont stop rain, but it is cheap quality, not a good fit and frankly smells like chemicals. Do yourself a favor and spend an extra $20 for a nicer jacket."
2.0,"I have never been duped by an amazon add until I purchased this dress. The color I received is a bright cotton candy blue, not the blue/green the pictures show. The style is not nearly as cute either. It is much more like a toddlers dress just blown up to fit  an adult. Nothing like the style or color shown in the pictures."
2.0,"Quality is pretty good.  The size small & large would say 2-pack, but it's 1 pair really.  So the medium is just 1 glove???<br /> It runs quite small and the palm part  (grey cloth) is smooth so when I held my garden clipper, it would just slide off often.  None of my many past gloves have done that.  It'd be nice if it had some traction on it, or you can apply some yourself.  Returning."
2.0,Bothersome circular imperfections in both  lenses in a few spots  that are hard to ignore.
2.0,"These adorable earmuffs broke my heart.  I fell in love with the cute design, but when they arrived, I found they were not very functional.  The headband is not adjustable, and it is too big/long/loose for my head.  Also, the inside of the earmuff is flat, so even if you position it right over your ears, it just sort of hovers over them without cupping them snugly for warmth.  Cute design, but it's back to the drugstore cheapies I go."
2.0,"I do not like these, will return"
2.0,Quality is fine but shorter than the picture (think mini). Not what was pictured or expected.
2.0,The hook part broke in half on the second day. Not so nice.
2.0,"These gloves smell awful, and they look like oversized women’s gloves. The shape is completely different from the photo, and the leather strap is not adjustable."
2.0,"Product is very warm.  However, my son wore these two times and the one shoulder strap piece broke.  He had to ski with it wrapped around his arm.  We have had to use a zip tie to hold it together to get him through his ski club.  Disappointed in quality."
2.0,Came tarnished and looks used. Not impressed
2.0,"looks and feel cheap. Too stiff and not for wide foot people. Also, not true to size, my usual 10 was too small"
2.0,Very thin. Can see through it. Does not look as pictured.
2.0,"It fit as expected, maybe even a bit big which I like loose fit,  but the fabric is sheer. I didn't like the way it looked on me so I returned it.  The purple is a great color."
2.0,This came with a small hole in the neck
2.0,"Wearing size ~11 shoes it's a gamble whether the largest size of these booties can actually fit my shoes.  Chacos won't fit inside them, but my running shoes will.<br /><br />The top doesn't actually reach above my calf, only about mid way, so pretty much any movement causes the top to gradually scoot down my leg rather than stay snug at my knee.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />About 3 weeks after I posted the above comment (used these on no more than 20 rides) the strap that wraps around my foot ripped out.  That boot immediately turned worthless.  There's simply no way to stop it from flopping around my foot, which made it impossible to walk around while using them.<br /><br />Definitely not a recommended purchase."
2.0,Not sure if I need to use more oils but don't smell the fragrance
2.0,"Had to return and get a large, I’m usually a medium . But it looks really nice"
2.0,This is more like a string of lights than a necklace. I am returning. It would not turn on. A piece of the plastic connector was broken and would not even stay clasped.
2.0,"While the pants are comfortable, the belt is has a plastic buckle. After wearing 2-3 times, the elastic waist twisted.  I’m going to donate them.  The two sets of pockets are nice to have in the front.  I was concerned that the lower leg pocket would not safely hold my cell phone because there are no snaps, velcro, or zippers.  Just something to be aware of.  Color is true to advertisement."
2.0,Too short lengthwise by the ankles and waist. Also waist pockets are extremely small.
2.0,Not what I  expected
2.0,This would have been perfect if it was not for the bar used to clasp the bracelet.  This bar fell out my hand into a crevice never to be seen again.  I wish there was another way to close the bracelets or a replaceable bar; right now the bracelet has been rendered useless. Heart breaking
2.0,It came in green with a neck attached piece in velcro very uncomfortable and ugly
2.0,"These shoes were great a first but with in just a couple months of wear, the Velcro on one of the shoe straps came apart."
2.0,Houses are not what they say and I dislike some of the fabrics aren’t good
2.0,Way to long very thin material and it seems to be a fit for a woman's head not a man's. The price is reasonable and sometimes you get what you pay for like i did in this case. Definitely not for sports activities
2.0,these run big. I ordered my normal size 8 and should have gotten a 7 or 7 1/2. These also run wide. makes my foot look huge. the ankle area is loose and weird-looking.
2.0,At first I was super excited; it seemed legit. But then It ripped trying to get it off. 😔
2.0,"Picture is misleading. Rubber does not last long and gets “grimy” by simple wear. Fits okay, but rubber quality is lacking"
2.0,"Neck hole is way too big and awkward. Can't keep it up or flip it down. The fabric isn't bad, super thick and warm, but the neck just makes it awkward. Returned."
2.0,"Very very cheap quality, and you can totally tell just by looking at them. I got the ones with the rainbow stripe, and the stripe looks like its just about to fall off."
2.0,Odd fit. Inexpensive fabric. Sent it back.
2.0,"Save your money and find a better set at a costume store near you. The wings were nasty looking, especially on the ends. After reading some reviews, some people mentioned adding feathers yourself seemed to spruce them up. I didn’t have the time or energy for that. And if you don’t either, I wouldn’t recommend. The halo was alright but the fuzz around the rim was falling off immediately and I had to tape it up too."
2.0,"Fits perfect<br />Color is off, does not looks like the picture, I don’t like the quality either."
2.0,The dress is beautiful but the belt was not securely stitched and came partly off after one use.
2.0,The pants weren't long enough and a Xl was to small
2.0,The white band in the center was so see-through you could see my belly button through it!  Be prepared to wear a camisole underneath.
2.0,"I bought 2 of these rings and put them to the test by using a drop of acetone to see if the stone would turn white like fake howlite that many vendors use today on turquoise to make a profit. About 90% of howlite is used in jewelry,like turquoise and many other stones today in jewelry.It did pass the test,it is real green copper turquoise.Another way to tell if it is real copper is to take a soft cloth and polish the copper,if the copper snags your soft cloth then it is real copper.And it did.It is real copper.( The only problem that is noticeable is when they treated the stone,there was bubbles on the stone and it doesn't come off no matter what you use.) Why would you color treat a real genuine green copper turquoise when it is already genuine????I also ordered (The teal blue copper turquoise which is real and it is perfect) (If something is real and genuine then leave it alone don't try to enhance something that is already genuine)."
2.0,"I bought this coat for my 9 yr old grandson. The first coat, the pocket came off on the outside and I ordered a replacement. Haven’t received it yet. It was a Xmas gift. If I knew before I reordered I would have just refunded the coat. It is waterproof on the outside but cheaply made for $80. The lining is coming out and the material is very thin. I just saw it. I wrapped the package as is and didn’t see it until today. I would not buy this coat again. Going to call and see if I can just get a refund. Poor quality."
2.0,"Great look, gets attention. Not sure what it is made of but metal started to discolor after about two weeks of regular wear."
2.0,"I purchased this skirt to wear outside in the summer because it had what looked like very roomy pockets that would be utilitarian. The pockets on the skirt that I received were very small and not useful as I had hoped.  I am a pretty true medium but i ordered a large because I wanted to wear it at my hips instead of at my natural waist. The medium would have been plenty big to wear at my hips - the large was huge. I am 5'10"" and this skirt was mid-calf on me so if you're short it could easily be almost ankle length. Also the material feels very scratchy and  cheap. Sadly have to return this one."
2.0,Poorly made while trying it on it broke.
2.0,It's a watch
2.0,The embroidery is small and dull and not like the photo. I was disappointed by this dress.
2.0,"Waaay too big for my tiny head, even with the drawstring inside. Regardless, the flop was also too big and covered my entire face. Had to return. Easy returns, no hassle."
2.0,It's really small and very different from the pic. sending it back.
2.0,The shirt was way to small.
2.0,"Way too small, and I ordered a XL. The quality of the buttons is almost laughable."
2.0,"UPDATE: 09/15/20147:  I had this bag put up in all the original packaging because I had another bag that I loved and I just started carrying it after Labor Day and already there is a rip in the side where the outside pockets are and I am so disappointed.  I treated this bag with kid gloves, despite it being able to hold a tablet I did not carry one.  I carried my wallet, kindle e-reader, eyeglasses, key and cell phone, not enough to cause it to rip as it has.  I'm retired and I usually only carried it two days a week so for it to be already ripped it not acceptable.  Although I purchased it in two colors, I'm afraid to try the black one since this one tore within the first two weeks.<br /><br />This bag makes it is so easy to fit everything I need into the bag. I have two of them and I carry my e-reader with me everywhere.<br /><br />The only thing I would change is to add at least one more zipper. Possibly put zippers on the two outside compartments and a snap clasp on the inner compartment. This would make the bag perfect."
2.0,"These masks are NOT polyester and are NOT ""perfect for sublimation"". They are cotton and trying to sub on them gives a blurry result"
2.0,Like the look of this product but quality isn’t good. Wanted to just email seller but there wasn’t an option to do so.
2.0,Ordered a large and it wouldn’t even fit my petite wife. I would have needed a 4X
2.0,the watch looks good but very poor directions and it came with battery but no instructions how to change the battery really!!!!!!!! come on can you give me a hint this is rediculous<br />if I knew what to do with this it might have gotten 5 stars
2.0,"If I were on the tv show Alone, I’d be without a fire."
2.0,Never wore and forgot to return. Very poor quality material and cheaply made.
2.0,"Bought these to wear with a garter belt. I’m 5’3 215 lbs and these did not work well for me. My thighs are very thick so “plus size” online is always a roll of the dice, and these specific ones didn’t make the cut for me. They rolled, were too tight, and much thicker than I was expecting, more like compression socks than stockings. I managed to wear them with the garter for a day to work and then on a 3 hour drive but I probably won’t wear them again until I’m down a a size or two."
2.0,"Bought an xl, it fit  tooo snug, the neck  design looked like it should not have been there."
2.0,"I didn't expect it to be this small. I need to fit my phone, wallet, makeup bag, phone charger, etc. this can't do that."
2.0,My husband did not like the mule fit of these slippers. They also ran wide and too large on his narrow small feet even with adjusting the velcro.
2.0,Look more like a scrub top with very tight arms. Not made for the medium to chunky size arms.
2.0,The shirt looked cute in the picture but it basically has no shape. It is a square with two arms holes. I am sending mine back.
2.0,Looks good but missing stones when it arrived
2.0,Huge and unflattering. Returned immediately
2.0,I should've looked closer to the measurements. It's WAY too small. Very cheap and thin fabric.
2.0,thick and stiff not so comfortable
2.0,"These are really cool looking, but quite heavy (for their size), and the backs don't keep them on. I tried using different backs, but they still didn't hang right. They turn downwards, instead of forward, so nobody can really see the &#34;faces&#34;. Alas, I tried, but ended up giving them away."
2.0,Very cute swimsuit but huge on me.  I ordered a S and it was huge and gaping off me.  Very disappointed because this is super cute!
2.0,Cute until it broke...
2.0,material is very thin. not recommended for any athletic activity
2.0,"I have hard time to keep the watch on my hand ,every time it fell down on the floor couple times.  I don't have watch any more it's broken I just wear for one week only. But it is nice watch."
2.0,"I like how these look, seem like good quality.  I purchased &#34;extra large&#34; and they were labeled as such.  They are so small, that even my 10 year old son was unable to put them on.  Perhaps that is what passes for XL in China, where these were made. but unusable to me or my family.  Have not had this problem with other brands of compression socks."
2.0,"My daughter loved these, but we had to return them. Although the design is adorable and the colors are great, they have a design flaw: several of the pairs had sharp plastic at the bridge, making them uncomfortable (and potentially unsafe) to wear. It was as if a plastic piece had not been cleanly ""punched out"" during the manufacturing process and the only way to fix them would be to SAND DOWN each pair individually (that would also scratch the clear plastic).<br /><br />It could have been this particular, batch, but we didn't have a time to find out, since they were party favors for her 10th bday. We ordered a similar style without the bridge ridges."
2.0,"I read the reviews and realized it ran small, so I ordered up two sizes. It is still rather tight for sleepwear. It is soft but I prefer sleep wear to be more loose. Very disappointing."
2.0,The quality of these were not great. Within two weeks(being worn about 4 times total) the grommet for the laces popped out and they started to rip at the seams. I wouldn't buy these again.
2.0,the material on the bottoms is super cheap and the seems fold over. not ver katered to girls with curves. DEFINITLEY SIVE 1 TO 2 SIZES UP IF YOUR GOING TO ORDER!
2.0,"The keychain was larger than I expected, plus it's made of plastic & not glass like I had hoped."
2.0,"I was looking forward to getting this tiara.  It looked adorable online.  Once I received it and tried it on, it was too small.  Online it stated for women and the packaging states 14+, maybe a small child.  Had to return it and find another option.  The quality is great though."
2.0,It looks good and design is stunning ..... but bottom side of the braclet poke a lot and ripped my skin
2.0,"I will give you a point because this thing is lightweight, portable and folds well. However, that's where the happiness ends. We used this to schlep our carry-ons (two adults, one kid, 7 carry-ons) and my husband wanted to throw it out at the layover where we ended up checking all our &#34;extra&#34; carry-ons we didn't need for the second flight. It tips over frequently. Even with the built-in straps, it's hard to get stuff to stay on (and we had even packed extra bungee cords). Most of the ways my husband would describe this cart cannot be listed on Amazon. It is possible PERHAPS that with heavier luggage it might work but we stacked 2 pieces of carry-on luggages and the rest of the bags (purse, backpacks, cooler) on top and it didn't work."
2.0,I probably should have read the item description more carefully... I was expecting more of a sweater.  This fabric was very thin and flimsy.  It was returned.
2.0,One of the most poorly constructed wigs I have ever gotten.
2.0,"It’s cool if you’re a DBD fan, wish it had sleeves, imagine is a bit blurry as if the PNG or Jpeg was not sized properly. Expect to get 1-2 sizes over normal size. (Factor in your Covid 15)."
2.0,"Has a shiner plastics sheen to the outside, but the inside is very soft. WAYYYY smaller than the true size."
2.0,"Clasp would not open at all! I guess for the price, what do I expect?"
2.0,The calf was way small for me I didn't like that at all had to give them away. I ordered a size 9
2.0,Not very durable. Top loop detached only a month after the return expired.
2.0,"This item is meant to be a beach coverup but the leg length of the shorts are too short, no way to tighten the top area because the strings are just there for decoration and not the best quality material.  Stitching is unraveling and it’s very cheaply made."
2.0,I was excited to find what appeared to be a rugged band at a great price. This band was used lightly over the course of two months and the clasp failed. It's glued on and over the span of a few months the glue failed to adhere. Ultimately this turned out to be a waist due to the fact ill have to purchase something of higher quality.
2.0,Item returned.  I thought it was a 32 Degree Heat brand.  This brand is inferior.
2.0,For some reason its ugly in person. There are 2 layers of fabric and its still see through. Fabric is not flattering
2.0,"Product ad states it is 40% wool. When it arrived, the packaging revealed it is actually 100% polyester. Misleading advertising."
2.0,"The photo shows the tank hanging low enough to cover the crotch area. Since I bought this to wear with leggings, that was important to me however, when I received it, it did not. I am 5 ft 3 in tall so it isn't because I am taller than average. I am sending it back."
2.0,"My $12 Wal-mart leggings are thicker than these! I caved and bought clothes online, shame on me. Purchased the space dye white pair; they aren't as long as advertised (to be fair, I'm 5'9) and the stretch pulls at the seams making them look weird. The material is still a bit see-through, but the pockets are cool! For the most part, they stay in place-I use them to lounge and walk the dog, and occasionally on the elliptical. Would NOT purchase again."
2.0,"Although this robe has potential, it’s extremely small. I am 5’6” and roughly 155-160lbs. By the size chart, I should be an XL, which is what I ordered. It’s very tight under the arms. It does close, but doesn’t overlap well. I had my 15 year old daughter try it on. She’s 5’5” and weighs about 115-120lbs. It barely even fit her! She also complained it was tight under the arms. Debating about whether to give it to her and have her make do with it or just return it. Disappointed!"
2.0,These are solidly built and It is definitely polarized but the product is made of cheap plastic that reeks of strange chemicals. There is even a warning on it that it &#34;may&#34; contain chemicals that are considered carcinogenic by the state of California. Needless to say I ended up throwing these away. Thankfully they are dirt cheap
2.0,"This was a very cute bra it just didn’t give the girls any support but, it looks cute."
2.0,They seem to keep slipping off of my glasses. My glasses have landed on the floor a number of times.
2.0,Wasn't thrilled with quality - seemed like very cheap fabric inside to me. I have small hands yet the gloves don't fit at all. There should definitely be a disclaimer about that. I did appreciate the seller wanting to work with me vs. me having to pay a big fee to return them.
2.0,"I ordered two sets of these masks for my children to wear to school. Red for my son and Pink for my daughter. I like the fit and style of the mask. The adjustable ear pieces are convenient but should come with replacements. The vent on the front seems unnecessary and poorly attached. I have had two of them rip and detach so far. My biggest complaint is that I ordered this mask because I love the idea of the detachable face shield. However, I have had 3 different shields out of the 6 be defective. The will not attach to the mask on one side. Something is wrong with the button. The buttons are also quite loose. Overall, the concept of this product is amazing. It is just poorly made. I would be willing to pay more $ for this same mask just made with more care."
2.0,Color was way off. Not even close. The material was very soft was not impressed.
2.0,It's ok thought it would be bigger
2.0,"The fabric was great very strong, however after was the fabric fades and after the first use the black air filter came out. So I give it a 2 star I only have 3 out the 8 mask."
2.0,Cute but for a child
2.0,"They broke very easily, I only got to wear them about two times before they broke."
2.0,"cheap quality, smells terrible, all around just not worth it."
2.0,I used this as a daith earring. It looks great when on. The quality looks decent as well. Had slight issues at night. I would wake up in morning and the ball would have fallen out at some point through out the night. This became a continuous problem.
2.0,Sizes are off. If you going to order one make sure get it two sizes bigger than you wear.
2.0,The brush had completely fallen apart in the bottle and was unusable.
2.0,Material is nice but size is way smaller than normal.
2.0,"I liked the style of the dress, I ordered  a size medium because that is what I usually wear but, it was a bit big so I could have used a small.  I did not like the material as it was a little heavy and it just kinda of hung on me, I have small shoulders and it can be hard to find tops/dresses that fit my upper body for this reason."
2.0,VERY big! I am small and could fit 2 of me in this. Looks cute but tooooo large.
2.0,"Very cool hoodie, but I ordered an XL and it is quite literally the size of a medium. Can't wear it at all."
2.0,I should have gotten  my ruler to get a real idea of the size.  Good quality  but duper tiny.
2.0,The silver one turned my finger green :(
2.0,"Didn't look like the photo, was not a slim fit and the sleeves were too short. Returned."
2.0,"This is pictured as a swim suit cover up but it’s basically a tank top! Even in the size large, couldn’t be used as dress or cover up!"
2.0,"This didn't work for me. I'm a D, and ordered a D. Seemed too small, but having larger breasts that are heavier and not as perky works against me. I will say, though, that I love the case this came in for storage/travel. Alsi, the adhesive seemed to be of good quality. It did stick, yet didn't hurt to remove from skin. This would probably be great for someone with smaller, perkier breasts."
2.0,Thin metal clasp for earrings. I have to keep bending them every time Inuse them<br />So they don’t fall off my ear. Meh.
2.0,Bottom was ok but the top was too big.. and I ordered a small.
2.0,Pretty beach dress.  Liked the material.  Just order a size or two up.  The seam on the arm ripped on first wear.
2.0,Didn't look like picture
2.0,Material feels cheap and thin. Not as long in length as photo. Does not wash well. would not buy again.
2.0,"Model was a bit bigger than the ones i had, same numeration and everything, glass didn't fit, i ended up molding some plastic into it and making it fit. Same numerations on both glasses, defo not the same fit."
2.0,Wore this for a 90s party and it’s a crop top. Fit way smaller than I’d like but still cute
2.0,very heavy on your ears w only a PLASTIC back
2.0,poorly sewn
2.0,I wasn't pleased with it. It's not as full and pretty as the picture. It wasn't worth sending it back.
2.0,My had arrived deform. It has no shape. I have been trying to fix it but haven't had any success. The hat is ruined.
2.0,"They sent me different colors, which I didn't mind what they had sent, their look and color are fine.  But they ended up breaking, two out of the three I got."
2.0,The water shoe fitted my child as expected but the material is too hard. The back part of the shoe rubbed above the heel and started to cut into the skin. We only used it for 30 minutes.
2.0,Way too small for an adult
2.0,Runs very very small thin material cheap quality
2.0,Does not make images clearer. Blublockers are a better product.
2.0,"Fake picture ads, specifications and toys like, not suitable for people to use, do not be deceived"
2.0,"It’s actually very cute on, and fit pretty good except for the bust.  I’m a 36C and ordered a large and the ladies did not fit in the cup.  But I could get past all of that if it weren’t for the blatantly cheap material!!  It was like wearing paper!  I’d rather just pay more money for better quality because I’ll NEVER be comfortable around a lot match in this dress"
2.0,"The Cap is to small and gives me a headache after awhile.<br />Pros: Warm, soft<br />Cons: Needs to be just a little bigger to fit on an adults head."
2.0,The eyes are in the wrong position. Will change my review if new mask is sent
2.0,"Quality jogging suit but I ordered a small and they gave me a small and a medium, and they knew exactly what they were doing because they were sold out. They at least could’ve gave me something for complementary for the inconvenience!"
2.0,Wasn't at all what I expected. Wrong type of fabric for the product.<br />I do not recommend it. I got a refund.
2.0,"The XL fits my watermelon sized (61cm) noggin loosely enough to slip three fingers under the brim. That's rare and good. The sides are nice and deep, similar to the Korean war style fatigue caps and so it sinks down until it sits on right on my ears. I like that.<br /><br />It's pretty light (56g).  It's nicely made.  Although it has ""Outdoor OR Research"" embroidered obnoxiously and non-removably on the left front side it's not nearly as offensive and hideous as the huge ""OR"" that Outdoor Research usually plasters it's hats with. There is another ""Outdoor Research"" label sewn to the outside rear of the hat; this is (and will be) easily removed.  If OR is going to charge me to advertise for them they could have at least stitched this rear label in such a way as to make it useful for hanging a small strobe light or turkey feather.<br /><br />The folding brim works well; the brim is reinforced with stiff, curved inserts of perhaps plastic but possibly cardboard. Fits folded in a hip pocket comfortably. There's a 10cm cord loop stitched to the inside rear crown.  I don't really know why it's in that particular location as it seems an awkward spot from which to either hang or tie town the hat.  The 4cm exterior band is double fabric and appropriately stiffened, perhaps with facing or scrim, to give body. This is good as the rest of the cap fabric is rather soft and shapeless. The 4cm interior band is  a black,soft and absorbent thin fleece.  The bands together are somewhat warm but they do move moisture well and keep sweat off the face.<br /><br />Here's the problem.  The body of the cap, both sides and crown, are made from a double layer of Supplex-like nylon. I have no doubt it blocks sunlight at the proclaimed (and embroidered) 30SPF rate.  However, it doesn't breath well at all. I have waterproof jackets that huff-test with more air permeability. Now in my experience, and especially here in Florida, very often when it's sunny it's also HOT.  And when it's sunny, and hot, and especially when it's humid, I find that air moving around my head is critical to being comfortable. I guess I'm funny like that. This cap fails miserably at letting hot air convect away from my head.<br /><br />So in conclusion this is probably a good cap for a very narrow weather range.  If it's cold and sunny or cloudy you'll want something that'll keep you warmer.  If it's sunny and cool this is a good hat. If it's sunny and hot you risk heat exhaustion wearing this for anything other than sitting in the shade staring at your cellphone. If it's cloudy and hot you'll be miserable with this thing on.<br /><br />I am seriously considering cutting some ventilation holes in the inside layer of fabric."
2.0,"They are super cute, but they were put together backwards...when you put the earing in they face the wrong way... I will have to fix them to wear them"
2.0,"I initially bought these boots for the 2018-2019 winter months, b/c I liked the style and my daughter (7yr) liked them as well and the price wasn't bad, compared to other prices. Winter in WI can be brutal. However; the soles of the boot aren't as sturdy as they should be, for a little kid who's playing around outside in the snow. I purchased some time in Nov of 2018. One day in mid Jan, I pick up my kid from school and she shows me the hanging sole that was ripped off right at the seam of both boots. Well, this landed me to have to hurry and buy more boots. If I hadn't of tossed the boots in the trash, I would've taken a pic and posted it. Other than the soles coming off, the boots are perfect.<br /><br />FYI: my kid isn't a rough kid when playing."
2.0,"The color on these is much more fluorescent than advertised. On top of that, the earring post was detached when it arrived, so I never got to wear them out once. For 95 cents you can’t ask for much more."
2.0,Way too sm
2.0,"My second time ordering these because I love the design. Went from small to medium but still too tiny to even get over my head! For reference, I'm 5'1&#34; and 112# and wear a 34C in a regular bra. I am not going to try a third time with these. I have a feeling a Large wouldn't be supportive enough for running. The fabric is pretty thin and there are no cups or padding in front. So disappointed!"
2.0,It 👀 looked like it would have been a nice cap 🧢 but very very poor packaging that ruined the cap!
2.0,I ordered the Navy blue but it came more in a royal blue
2.0,"Though the design is beautiful, the quality of necklace is not so good. The charm is smaller than the size shown in the picture."
2.0,I liked but it’s missing one Eir witches  ( love dizziness )
2.0,"Sleeves too tight.  Tail too long.  Nice color, tho.  Looks good in my closet."
2.0,Material is cheap and fabric has lots of frayed knots and unravling to it just being worn.  Very disappointed.  It has not even been washed.
2.0,"This dress, overall is cute but be sure to order up. I am 5'8, 124 lbs and usually wear a small but this was so tight, it made my body look weird."
2.0,Great belt but run one size small
2.0,"The dress looks super cute in the photos, however, upon receipt it was that weird cheap Halloween costume material. I had purchased this to wear to Ren Fest but I couldn't get past the material. I honestly didn't even try it on after feeling it so I cannot comment on how it fits, etc."
2.0,"ALL OF THE ITEMS ARE DIFFERENT COLORS; YOU MAY GET AWAY WITH WEARING THE EARRINGS AND BRACELET AS SET, BUT DEFINITELY NOT ALL ESPECIALLY THE HAT AND NECKLACE. BUT TO BE TOTALLY HONEST, I DO LIKE THE SET, I'M JUST DISAPPOINTED THAT THEY ARE ALL MIXED MATCHED."
2.0,These fit very weird. May be the cheaper material. The toe area was very wide! I never have this problem. They were not comfortable in any way. They crease when walking. I returned for a refund.
2.0,"Bought this for a white party. I thought there'd be a built in bra of some sort due because the images appear to have an underwire. It's sheer as shown but the under layer & top layer move independently of each other which makes the seams not match up & due to the top not being more structured, was not flattering on my tatas. I'm 5'4"" & about 135 lbs with non natural 34DD's."
2.0,"Looked good, but the chain broke within a couple wearings. Not well made. You get what you pay for. If you only want to wear this once and throw it away, I suppose it's worth the money. If you want to give a gift to somebody you really don't like, and want to look bad, this is the item for you . . ."
2.0,"Underwhelmed by these rings. Firstly, they are all one size so it impossible to wear them as shown since a person would need rings of different sizes to ""stack"" them up fingers in this manner. Secondly, the ring material has extremely rough edges that irritate the skin when worn. Finally, the ring material is flimsy and bends incredibly easily. Only wanted the rings for a costumed event but couldn't even end up wearing them for the whole event due to the skin irritation and that they bent under the slightest touch."
2.0,Definitely not British skinny style
2.0,"This underwear is NOT high waisted, nor is it tummy control. Very disappointing.<br />The fabric is good however."
2.0,"These Merino socks were not what I wanted.  I thought they would be more like Smart Wool socks since they were supposed to be ""thin"".  Not as thin as I was expecting and had a rough texture.  I sent them back."
2.0,"If I could be 6ft. tall, the jumper would have fit!  But I am 5'4&#34; tall!"
2.0,Received a different face was exact charm we already had.
2.0,This dress isn’t made for shorter people with bigger breasts. It makes you look short and boxy. I should have got a X-small. But was afraid it would be too tight in my boobs since I am a 34DDD. I have a little pouch from having kids and the seam was right on it so it made me look bigger. Also some of the stitching wasn’t straight either. Very disappointed.
2.0,Like a jacket worn over it…seriously not color safe.
2.0,"Love the Sandals, they are really cute but run a little small."
2.0,Shoe didn't even have the size on it. We ordered an 11 and it is way to big.
2.0,The skirt is to high and the shorts can be seen.
2.0,"SO disappointed with this thing. I paid more than other bands but it is in no way for a small woman wrist!! It is stiff, bulky, thick, wide and hard to wear. Not to mention I had to cut off 3/4 of it to get it to fit at all (warning on that, its a royal pain and took me 30 min to get it right). Can't even wear it... :*( Total waste of money and we don't have extra money to buy me another."
2.0,I sold it it wasn't made well
2.0,Normal no era la talla
2.0,Really soft but the cutout kept flopping around.
2.0,Very poorly made. The wrist strap broke clean off within the first week and I was not hard on it at all. I used it as a wallet in my purse that I could grab and go if I didn't want to carry my whole huge purse. I merely pulled it out of my purse by the strap and it broke off. The metal clasp snapped. Very disappointed.
2.0,I loved the dress! But had to rerun due to the rips on the sides :( total bummer! I just ordered another one hoping it doesn’t come defective!
2.0,"It’s too light to feel like anything other than cheap. Which it is, so maybe I shouldn’t have expected more? But a real pocket watch is metal and has a certain weight and feel to it, which this doesn’t."
2.0,Soft but small
2.0,They are too lose and the leg portion is also weird not recommended
2.0,The turquoise color is much darker then the photo. More blue then turquoise. And shipping took FOREVER. Don't waste your money or time.
2.0,"Order a size 14 for my daughter who is a normal 12 in skinny jeans. They were way too small. These are very slim fit, not true to size. And had zero stretch. The zipper was busted on the pair we received. I returned for a prompt refund."
2.0,Flimsy. Lens popped out a week in. Otherwise looks cute... just not made to last.
2.0,Bought this 2 pack of Hurley swim goggles thinking because of the brand name they might be better than some of the generic goggles we have gotten in the past. These are very small - they fit my 5 year old. Not sure how these are supposed to fit a 14 year old. Do not recommend - at least for the age group 6-14.
2.0,"Unfortunately, these shoes were too tight for my daughter. They gave her a blister on her heel, so we had to return them."
2.0,This was not as pretty when I received it. I returned it.
2.0,"The zipper on this jacket broke the first day I wore it.  Obviously, that is a disappointment and I will return it.  However, I do have to say that I really like the light-weight-ness of this jacket.  I will search for a similar one."
2.0,"I love the look, but it is way too tight on me with jeans.  I don't consider myself with big calves, but apparently everything now is for a size 00 including your calves!  Would fit a slim teenage girl, but for a grown adult, unless you're super skinny probably wouldn't waste your money.  Again, love it, but way too tight."
2.0,"Got this for my wife - she really wanted to like this watch.  It's a beautiful design and color, but both of the leather circles that held the &#34;extra&#34; end of the band came unglued after only 2 months, so the end was always sticking out, which really annoyed her.  Then, it fell from the dresser to the floor and stopped working."
2.0,Glass fell out on the first day of use.
2.0,It’s a cool looking jacket but out of every pocket in the coat there was a hole. On every single pocket. If it weren’t for that I’d actually recommend this jacket but I was kinda let down by it
2.0,Not made for truly big heads (size 8 hat). Arms squeeze head. Cool glasses otherwise.
2.0,The fabric was  thin and cheap. Not what I suspected
2.0,"The watch itself is pretty good. You just need to wear it a lot, or it will stop and you will need to set it again. The problem I have is that the strap is VERY confusing. More detailed instructions are needed. I finally figured it out, but on my own using trial and error. I was going to return the watch because of this issue, but since I figured it out, I am deciding to keep it. I spent about an hour trying to figure out how the strap works. So, if you like puzzles, this product is for you."
2.0,"I ordered the green and received the blue, Fabric is not as light as I would have liked. Its a decent dress for the price, its just not my style. I ordered the large and it fits okay except on the top half of my body, little too snug."
2.0,broke within the first week of my 7 year old wearing it.  You get what you pay for.
2.0,"Was looking to add some more colors to my watch band collection, and was drawn to this set. Can't begin to tell you how terrible the colors are in real life. The yellow looks like cheap yellow mustard, and the brown looks like the inside of a baby's diaper.<br /><br />Keep looking."
2.0,"I like the style of this button up top but that's about it. The fabric is poor quality, the buttons are so far apart that it gapes open so you have to wear a tank or something underneath. Basically, they scrimped on the number of buttons to save money. Although it is cute, I don't expect it to last any more than 10 wearing and washings. I could have sewn this myself for cheaper with better materials. But, you get what you pay for. . . in this instance it was probably worth less than 5$. I will say that I enjoyed wearing it for Independence Day and it was worth it for that day."
2.0,"The embroidering is very itchy, wouldn't have been able to wear."
2.0,I ordered this dress and 4 other colors. This was the only one that was cut extremely small. Sleeves were extremely tight. Length was mid calf not long like the rest. I didn't return it. I gave it away.
2.0,It is really small and the charm broke the first day I used it. The inside image fell out of the metal circle. I’m going to try gorilla glue to fix it.
2.0,Don't waste your money very cheap quality
2.0,"I usually pick a large sweater, or sweatshirt all the time because I have a very athletic frame. I'm 5'8 180 and very stocky up top but I said, oh well I will try the medium because people are saying it runs big. Well, it is still big and under the armpits has way too much sweater. the pictures do no justice with their arms down to the side, very misleading.<br /><br />You get what you paid for. spend a few extra bucks and also go to the store, because you can never tell how something fits you by looking at pictures."
2.0,Liked a lot until washed and shrank like 2 sizes and didn't even dry it and washed with cold water!
2.0,"I was surprised at the size of this bag. The measurements listed are not far off from my previous bag but there was so much less room. Basically you'll be able to fit a wallet, maybe a Kindle reader or small tablet, and perhaps a pad and some pens, and not much else.  I returned as not able to use it."
2.0,1) Plastic on the nose-piece broke after less than a year of light use.<br />2) The holes on the top rim of the lenses allow for dust/particles to fly in and get into the eyes. Had to tape them off to use for biking... Which made swapping lenses more difficult.<br />Conclusion: better to buy 2-3 separate sets of quality glasses for different uses.
2.0,Lovely style dress. Bought three different colors of the same Size and only one fit comfortably. Sizes run small up top. Otherwise it’s lovely.
2.0,It's a blue hat with iron on decal. So damn cheap.
2.0,"They feel cheaply made and the stitching of the words on the bottom of the feet make them uncomfortable.  However, the fit is fine, so they get 2 stars.  I'll stick to Timberland no show socks."
2.0,toes cramped<br />I like the simplicity and light weight of this clog.
2.0,"Pretty red heart, I bought a few for gifts. I noticed where the heart is glued together, the front half and back half, do not line up straight. I can't use that one as a gift. Have to check the other one's over before giving them as gifts."
2.0,Cute but bust didn't fit at all. Would have loved this if it had.
2.0,Have only had these 3 months and they are completely tarnished.  Yes they were cheap but I'm not sure I will re purchase every 3 months...
2.0,One pair was way too big.
2.0,YUCK!! I ordered a size up and still too small in the bust. I think you must have to be built tall and thin like the model on the photo for this not to look frumpy. Returning.
2.0,I’m a size small (100 lbs 5’5”) fit is baggy. The color was as expected however around the mid section and in the breast area this dress was very baggy. I was hoping for a fitted dress but had to return.
2.0,Glasses were cheap made and the foam on the inside was not attached correctly and had shifted off the glasses. They were great to fix the issue. Thankful!
2.0,Wasn't to impress when I open the box.
2.0,Shoe looks good but is already falling apart and my son hasnt had them a month yet.
2.0,"These socks get 2 stars because they fit and I like the design/ look of them.  They are too thin.  When wearing you feel every thing you step on, I'm talking a stand of hair even.  With shoes they rub and you blister.  I would not recommend if you prefer soft cushiony socks."
2.0,"Items looks nothing like picture on post. No antiquing, shiny brand new looking medal. Could have bought the item cheaper with another seller but chose this one because it looked more like movie coin. My son was upset when we got a different item than pictures."
2.0,Very baggy through the legs.  Also fabric stretched badly during wear.  Sloppy looking!!
2.0,Turned green after 30 minutes of wear. Beautiful pieces though
2.0,The earrings are misshapen around the connectors upwards. Looks like roughly silver spray painted costume jewelry more than actual jewelry. Difficult to put on with the hook design.<br />The actual oval pieces and halos look fine though. Unsure if I want to make the effort to return them based on their top half or not yet.
2.0,runs very small buy two sizes up
2.0,"This item unfortunately frayed after the very first wash, it was never placed in the dryer. It is so cute that it's a shame the little straps aren't stronger."
2.0,HAS CAME APART OR  BROKEN 3 TIMES ALREADY
2.0,This dress was super cute aside from the fact that it ran incredibly small. Like so small I had a uni-boob in it! I ordered the large. I’m a size 10. 36D chest. I’m going to re-order in an XL and try my luck!
2.0,The underwear has very poor ventilation.
2.0,"The stars are disproportionately large, and the gauge of the post too big for a standard piercing (seems like maybe 16 gauge), but the post also looks too *short* to fit through my daughter’s earlobe comfortably. I don’t think we would ever be able to put the back on the earring, had we even tried (which we didn’t). We were looking for cute little stars, these were not what we were hoping for.<br />Returning."
2.0,Nice product however two of the chokers were broken upon opening them. I do not want to return all of  them but could I get a replacement?
2.0,Pretty crappy material not long enough should be only sold to petit people
2.0,"I love the look and quality of this shoe, but it rubs the skin off my heels after just a few steps. OUCH.  I have to wear a sock with them, but it sort of ruins the look."
2.0,Beautiful colors but poor quality. I wore these bottoms 5 times and they are already loose on me. I had to stop while swimming to pull the bottoms up so they don't fall off completely. I am very disappointed.
2.0,These are advertised as mens socks. Not even close. Bought for my sophomore grandson but these won't fit my dog. Tiny feet to wear these. maybe size 6 or 7 girls.
2.0,"This is cute, but SUPER TINY! Smaller than a dime. Disappointed."
2.0,"I really liked these at first, but they're almost worn through and I haven't even had them the full thirty days allotted to send them back. I'm getting a refund and buying something else."
2.0,Ok could be better if the screws worked properly.
2.0,they are much too big for me.  they are more for a man
2.0,"The chest area is about 2 inches smaller then it says it is.  The dress would have possibly been great.  Unfortunately, to get to the point where everything fit it looked like a discombobulated tent down together with spare parts."
2.0,One clip broke first opening rendering strap useless.
2.0,Unfortunately the dress has a hip side hole !! Why do not they have control over the quality of the product?
2.0,"This ""dress"" is definitely not a one size for all.  I wear between a 10-12 and it fit incredibly weird on me.  There was no way to make this work to wear in public.  Disappointing because it looked super cute.  Fabric was comfortable though.  Not a winner for my wardrobe."
2.0,"The band was nice for awhile. Then, the metal prongs started to rust and stain the Fitbit. A black discoloration formed on the top edges of the band. It served its purpose, but wasn't quality."
2.0,The pocket was sewn on upside down.  Makes it look all bulky on one side when you try to wear it. I was so disappointed as I wanted this to wear from my grandson's birthday party.  The fabric weight is nice. Color is great really wanted to love this.
2.0,"Broke within 30 minutes. Very cheap quality on the men's mask. Looks good, but after one bump everything fell apart and couldn't be glued back together."
2.0,It was broken and not useable when it arrived
2.0,I only used for 2 weeks then it broke the sole.
2.0,I started off by ordering the beige clutch and absolutely LOVE it! So I ordered the blue for my daughter... It is completely opposite of the first clutch we ordered. It is a velevet type of material NOT faux leather. We will be returning this item.
2.0,To small and it looked like a curtain
2.0,"These are not size appropriate. I bought large [I wear a size 10], I couldn't get them above my knees. They were great about the return!"
2.0,"For looks, the watch is attractive. But I didn't buy it for looks alone--I actually expected it to keep time. It was quite amusing to find that the watch kept time just fine as long as I didn't wear it. But I bought a watch so I could wear it and know the time.<br />The night I got it I set the time and let it sit on my bed-side table. In the morning I was happy to see that the time still matched my phone's time. After wearing it for an hour it had lost 30 minutes.<br />I thought &#34;Hmm... that's odd.&#34; So I set the time again and let it sit for a few hours. Again, it kept in step with my smartphone. I put it back on and within 10 hour it had lost 8 minutes."
2.0,"The quality is nice, but runs very small. I'm a XL in US tops and ordered the XXXL. The item just buttons, so I will need to leave it open and wear a tank top under. It's also tight in the arms. Do not purchase if you are bigger than a 38DD and have curves."
2.0,So small and tight. Cute top tho
2.0,Pleased with the strap overall.  However the retention band that holds the strap in place broke almost immediately.
2.0,"These shorts are not exactly what i was expecting. They have a tight band at the top that provides uneven pressure and compression on my belly. I'm 5'5 and about 165, so I have a bit of a belly. That band at the top highlights that area even more. I was hoping for more of a compression legging type fit, and got a belly enhancing fit. I'm still going to keep it because I can wear a loose fitting top with it, but not any tight or crop top."
2.0,"I sized up so I could button it all the way down but the chest measurement is way too big and makes me look wide if I raise my arms - seems like strange measurements - if you are a literal hourglass pinup shape it should work - quality is a bit cheap - had high hopes, liked the design and picture online, but like a lot on Amazon, the sizing is for some kind of mannequin.... for reference, I usually wear a medium, 36b, and size 8/10 pants - athletic build"
2.0,"I loved the look of this band however it keeps snagging on all my clothes and has ruined a couple of my sweaters, unfortunately it's too late to get a refund and have only had it a couple of months"
2.0,"The material is nice. Doesn't rub me wrong like other fabrics. I am only giving two stars though because after wearing one pair twice and washing them, they developed a hole in the inner thigh seam. I don't wear them often so by the time I got to the second pair and noticed that they CAME with a hole in the inner seam, it was too late to return. I wouldn't purchase unless you're handy with a needle and thread."
2.0,The mask was ill fitting on the sides...did not fit close to the cheeks. I did not like the silky fabric.
2.0,"Very cheaply made. I like the fabric, but not the way it's put together. I thought the straps were adjustable, but nope. And I don't know if I missed it or if it's just not shown, but the way the neckline is sinched looks cheap and doesn't flatter my figure at all. (I'm 5'6"" 115lbs; thin and small chested.) I think it's designed for curvier women. I DO like the way the legs hang, but they were too long, so I washed it in hot water and dried with a higher heat setting and it shrunk enough to fix the length, and the legs are still nice and loose and flowy. On the whole...well, I'm keeping it, but I'll need to wear a vest, cardigan, bolero, or something that hides the weird, poofy neckline and straps. Without something on top, it looks like I'm wearing an extra, extra large garden trash bag."
2.0,"If only the watch was tougher and better made...<br /><br />I bought the watch in September 2019.  When the temperature dips below 40, the watch used to get cloudy due to condensation.  Then, the buttons stopped working so it was sent to Casio for repair at the cost of $170.31.<br /><br />After the repair, watch is getting cloudy with condensation AGAIN.<br /><br />Casio Service has not yet replied to my inquire this time.  It's been 3 days."
2.0,Started falling apart the moment I put it on! Sadly such a nice looking embellishments had to go back
2.0,"I bought these because they were a good deal and came with three. They do the job as leggings, they aren’t uncomfy by any means. But I’m a week or so into owning and I already see seams ripping? And the “ tummy control ” is non existent really. It is high waisted, but doesn’t do a very good job of holding it all in. That being said, having leggings with pockets in them is for sure my new favorite thing. If you just want some good priced leggings I’d say get them."
2.0,I don't like anything about it
2.0,Too big and looks like I have a boob on my head
2.0,"I ordered this belt with the intention of discarding the buckle and using an older military buckle with it. However, it's wider than an actual mil spec belt so no dice. The quality seems ok for what it is (it's very inexpensive) but listing the belt width as well as the length would have saved me the trouble of ordering something I didn't actually want."
2.0,It looks so much better in the picture.  I didn't like the fabric and it's too small.
2.0,"Very cute, made with decent materials, however, much smaller for the size I ordered."
2.0,I didn't like these earrings so I returned them for a refund. I knew they were going to be 3.5 inches long but they look better as pictured online than they actually do. They look cheap & was not a good quality item.
2.0,Cheap and looked good.  Only got to wear them less than a month sadly.  The arm broke off it's hinge.  For the price i guess it was worth it though?
2.0,Disappointed looks cheap
2.0,Read and reread the description in case you expect something besides a plastic exterior. Definitely paying for the show's popularity and not the quality
2.0,I loved this bathing suite as it looked online but OMG the sizing is completely off i ordered a Large and I'm an extra small and this thing was way too small
2.0,"This lasted me a few weeks before it fell off my gear keeper. Actually, it fell off before that, but I caught it the first couple times. The ""carabiner"" clip didn't line up very well and so it was not secure. I'm going back to the more expensive kind - they at least lasted a few years before I broke the crystal."
2.0,Bought these to wear while running a 5k so that I would have a place for my phone. The pants fell down the ENTIRE race making them VERY uncomfortable.  Do not recommend & will never buy again.
2.0,I am modest in chest area and that was too small.
2.0,While the color is spot on…the silver is great but it is cut very small so you would need to order up 2 sizes
2.0,Cute too but way too small esp in arms
2.0,Love the feel and way they look however they are not true to size. The top is way to small. I got a small and it’s smaller than an x-tra small. There is no instructions on how to return or exchange. I guess I have to order another set in a size medium for the top. Even though I love them they are to expensive to buy two to get one that fits.
2.0,Much smaller sizing!
2.0,Not true to size.<br />Sizes are smaller the u expect
2.0,"Way too small, but fits the price I guess."
2.0,It's a beautiful ring but doesn't fit my finger. I'm 6 in all rings and i csn't use this one in any finger
2.0,I was blown away by the fact that the watch was tossed in the package with the box that the watch should have been in. The box that the watch should have been in is a descent box. (Well made). Maybe this is normal??
2.0,"The gloves are uncomfortably tight and the seams inside are too rough. I have small hands to begin with, but these gloves are child-sized. Several of the fingers came frayed and would likely unravel completely if I were to continue wearing them. Very cheaply made."
2.0,Cheap fabric but good for a bathing suit coverup.
2.0,"The overall fit was great but however, the material was extremely stiff.."
2.0,Hardware too heavy for fabric.
2.0,did not like the material to harsh on my skin.
2.0,So I'm a big Barrell chested guy and these were waaay too tight. But at least a size up. If you're slim they should fit ok.
2.0,The photo is not representing the actual color. The jacket that arrived is about 10 shades lighter
2.0,"Color of red dress is not as pictured - it is a very bright lighter red, not burgundy as shown. This dress is extremely tight everywhere. Very unforgiving  towards the abdominal area."
2.0,"This product is not the same as the image pictured. Its a different color and pattern. It's very see through and runs really small. I ordered a medium for styled shoots and know that I will only be able to use it on xsmall women. The product they sent me is cute but its not what is pictured, not even close. Turquoise and flowers..... a little disappointing. Shipped quickly."
2.0,Ha! This was way to big and long!
2.0,"I love the color, and it has great sound..<br />It doesn't stretch at all, doesn't fit an adult head."
2.0,I dislike waiting the long period of time and then the dress fits small not lose should have order a larger size. overall product looks great and material is comfortable.
2.0,way too big size chart inaccurate
2.0,"they worked well for a while than began to fog instantly, I would not buy them again. They don't fit large heads well."
2.0,These are made way to big. Not the best construction at best. These where suppose to be mixed colors but both packs came all pink . I'm don't recommend these .
2.0,Needs a better zipper and definitely not heavyweight. Runs small in stomach area. Will be returning.
2.0,"I was looking for old-fashioned washable sleeve-covers, since I often get ink stains on my shirts. This product, alas, is nothing like what I wanted. I'm keeping it because it's not worth the trouble and cost of returning, but I am annoyed that the product description was not clearer."
2.0,"I just bought these pants and wore them once. They were comfortable and flattering, but the second time I wore them, I noticed the seam coming apart on the leg and then they ripped open. These are definitely not as well made as I would hope. The seems need to be reinforced."
2.0,"ITS TRUE. THE DRESS PICTURED, IS NOT WHAT YOU GET! However I still wore it on my cruise as a cover up and a night gown. So I wouldn't say this is a total waste of money. I have seen a lot of pics of people wearing it with belts and such. I will definitely try that. But the reviews are correct. It's not the cover up that is pictured. I believe it runs slightly big to me."
2.0,They hurt..Im a 10.5
2.0,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D7ZDSNF/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3  Se tardó mucho en venir. El producto es muy pequeño
2.0,i didnt end up wearing it
2.0,Item became damaged after wash
2.0,I was really hoping for something warmer with grip feet on wood floors. These are very thin and not warm at all.
2.0,"Pretty cheap as expected. We used it for a costume so that’s ok. Howeve, it’s a banana yellow color and not like the photo provided. Bright. Banana. Yellow."
2.0,Ok it looks great but I am going to have to re glue the stone in it - it came loose in travel I guess
2.0,"Purchased these pants for using at work in EMS. Pros: lots of pockets. Decent zippers.<br /><br />Cons: super baggy. No stretch. Waistband elastic is just weird to me. Pick up lint from bath blankets easily. Velcro closures on pockets has never been a good idea - they loose their stickiness quickly.<br /><br />I kept the pants because they were cheaper than most tactical pants and I’m just waiting for my company issued gear to come in and needed something in the interim.<br /><br />If you’re looking for something that will last long, don’t buy these!"
2.0,Thus sweater runs way too small in any size...will not wrap around
2.0,Too baggy and very stiff. Not too crazy about it
2.0,Cheaply Made... I'm going to give it to my 16yr old.. It has pink stiching FYI
2.0,It’s pretty much see though
2.0,Super cheap thin material.  Not form fitting
2.0,The gray on the shoe's shows more in person than in the picture. I really don't like them
2.0,It was cute but made super cheap. The straps were sewn uneven so it was unwearable.
2.0,"It runs small, I should’ve gotten one size bigger Im 5’3 & 117 lbs. so I normally wear a Medium size for these tight outfits but maybe a large would’ve been better for this particular brand, hopefully it will loosen up as I wear it more often. But it looks really cute.<br /><br />The color for the white and gray was disappointing, I thought I was buying white with gray which is shown in the picture but what I got was light gray with a slight darker gray.<br /><br />I have a lot of gray workout clothes so I was hoping to buy a white one, the picture shown is very deceiving & they should change it.<br /><br />I wanted to return it and buy a different white one from a different brand but I didn’t have time to do the return and I’m not terribly disappointed since it looks cute. I will just have to find another white one somewhere else."
2.0,Was great for a few days. Then started to unravel and these white fibers kept pulling out of the fabric. You get what you pay for I guess.
2.0,Logo is similar to an updated iron-on... wife got it to keep in the car for hot days - so it will work - just cheap on the logo area
2.0,"Honestly, I mean, it is literally 'too good to be true.' The print is fairly true to the image, but the quality is just bad, which is as expected for $17. The cut is unflattering, and the arms are quite small, so that combined with the slippery material means that it slips down. Which is fine, as then it's a cute collarbone dress, but it drags down the waist hem, so that it pouches and doesn't nip in nicely at the waist.<br /><br />I'm 6' tall so it was a nice length on me, but I could see that it would be too long for someone more petite."
2.0,"Not a big fan. The material is not what I thought, too silky to feel comfortable under other clothes. And they run small. I wear a large normally and so I ordered a large... Super tight. I would recommend a size or two up. Other compression thanks I have ordered were not right like these. It's less compression and more just too small. I will still use them for around the house or something but I won't get them again."
2.0,Love the feel. I wear a typical small and size 4.  Shorts were perfect. Top was made for someone with a very large distance between armpit and shoulder. I cut the shoulder straps and trimmed of 2 inches the just sewed it back up. Not great but they are really cozy pjs
2.0,"I just purchased this item, it came Saturday (3 days ago) I opened the package, and when looking at the bag, I noticed that there was a tear on the inside pocket near one of the seams. I was so excited, because this is the right OCP pattern, and color, however, it clearly is not going to last."
2.0,it wouldn't charge cap was great
2.0,I'm a size 7-8 in rings and this was too big on every finger. You can get a ring guard to size it down. It is very ornate. Definitely special occasion. Not for day to day wear.
2.0,"These shirts are not worth the cost<br />They are sheer (see photo)<br />I’m 130lbs 5’7<br />The straps don’t go far enough down for me they are kinda tight, the strap is very delicate.<br />They run small and sheer.<br /><br />I love the length , that’s it. I would not recommend buying"
2.0,"The rear of these underwear are a little short, you get a little too much plumber's air back there if you know what I mean, other than that I can live with them for now."
2.0,Fit bigger than I thought they would. My son is 14 months old and has large feet and they were too big. They also don’t have much structure to them. Not good<br />For new walkers
2.0,Hat is nice..order was not clear that I was ordering a size extra small
2.0,Us big armed Americans stand no chance with this top. The sleeves are for 12 yr olds. If you cut them into flaps they are ok but the acual arm hole is small too ....just dont lift your arms...other wise its super cute. If China is going to sell here they need to rethink their patterns and make bigger better shaped garmets.
2.0,Just received it - super cute.  Like the lightweight material.  Why it did get a higher rating on the review.  According to their size chart I should wear a medium but ordered a large.  Definitely can not wear it to church.  Could put a cami on to cover boobage exposure.  Plus need to stitch the skirt closed to the knee.  Debating about modifying it or returning it
2.0,Very pretty dress but not true to size at all. The XL is more like a Medium
2.0,"I purchased it at two sizes larger than I wear. It was still way too tight. To make matters worse, when I put my hands in the pockets, the pockets ripped at the seams!"
2.0,"I chose this watch as a replacement for a Citizen Eco-drive with the EXACT same casing design. After my Citizen broke when the pin got pulled out while I was taking off a back pack, I decided to purchase this watch. I figured for the price, that it would be a good replacement (I wasn't going to spend $100+ again on the same watch). After only 2 months, wearing 3 or so days a week to my office job, it no longer accurately keeps time. It is still running but randomly loses time (it will say 3:00, but actual time is 3:15). This happens daily.<br /><br />I am not interested in a replacement or speaking with customer service. I just would like other buyers to beware. This watch design is made by multiple brands and I have had problems early on with 2 of them. I highly recommend you buy something from a more established brand."
2.0,"It was really small, not worth purchasing."
2.0,Color very nice but size was not as advertised....to small.
2.0,It fit too small
2.0,These pants are very thin and a little small for the size stated.
2.0,"It came so wrinkled and you can’t get them out, even after washing and using an iron on the inside. The color of the gray with orange and blue do not look like the picture at all. .  I would NOT buy again."
2.0,Will be returning.  Too small across the top.
2.0,Poor quality. Shirt is fruit of loom. Can buy at Walmart for $1. The printing is skinny and faded.not vibrant colors like photo. Wouldn’t recommend. Can buy from Nike for same price or 5 bucks more and better quality. And it’s 100 percent cotton and it shrunk.
2.0,It was made wrong. A lot of the piece were connected together wrong.
2.0,I even got one 1 size bigger than I normally wear and it  was still way too smal
2.0,"I love this company but this is now the second time I have received a set of pajamas with a large hole in the seam. These are not cheap, I shouldn’t have to finish seeing the product together before my son can wear them."
2.0,"This ring looks so beautiful in the picture, but the one I got was far from it. Maybe it was just my ring, but it was not etched evenly. There are some areas on the ring that the pattern just disapears. I was super bummed about it."
2.0,Runs big and it’s not complimentary at all
2.0,I feel like an animal has been chewing on my ankles after riding in these.
2.0,Wanted to like this shirt but it fits really baggy and is made of cheap flimsy material that wrinkles almost immediately. Have to consider that the price might have something to do with it.
2.0,"The fir is just off, they are way too big in the waist yet extremely tight in legs. I can’t say they are very flattering as they stretch out and look like ripped in the middle part."
2.0,Fine for a mask but steam up easy and can not see they then...
2.0,The description says it is polyester and cotton. There is no cotton. It is 100% rayon. And it is not black and white like the photo but black on a silver/gray. Awesome graphic. Terrible t-shirt.
2.0,I ordered these to match the necklace of same design from this company. The green stone in the necklace is not high quality but is at least clear like a real stone would be.<br /><br />The stones in these earrings are a dull plastic looking piece. They look more like pieces for small children then nice adult costume jewlery. Would NOT buy again.
2.0,They are too small for my scarves to fish through. So I can’t use them. They might work with a  very light chiffon summer scarf. It depends on what you were looking fo
2.0,i am going to return this.  it turned my finger green so I know it is not really white gold plated.  major let down.
2.0,"These are SUPER thin and show any bit of water so I definitely would never wear these to work out. They are so thin even my no-show underwear can be seen. I’m normally a size 0-2 and these are way to big. I’m about 5’6 and although they go on as being full length, after walk-in about 20 steps they go above my ankles"
2.0,"I was excited to get these, but they have a shelf bra.  No where in the ad does it say they have a shelf bra.  I returned them because of this.  I think this is valuable info for the product.  I did get a free return, so that was nice."
2.0,It makes a grinding noise when operation and that means it was manufactured with bad gears.  I feel like I wasted my money.
2.0,Most of them broke the first time my daughter tried to wear them :(
2.0,"I wear size fives and these socks do peak in every pair of flats I own. However, they're so cute that I don't mind. In fact, I've gotten so many compliments on the look of these! Also, because they have the antislip gel everywhere, these never fall off my feet despite having tiny narrow feet. I've also taken these through the washer and dryer three times before reviewing and every single pair has held up without any tears. I'll be repurchasing this<br /><br />Update (2 months later): changed from 5 stars to 2stars due to the holes forming in these socks. I cut my toe nails regularly and I’m not on my feet particularly often when I wear these socks to work. Nonetheless, big holes are forming. Also, the grip of these socks are decreasing over time so now they don’t hold on to my ankle as much. In other words, it’s slipping into my flats frequently. They’re still the cutest no show socks I have if you don’t count the ones I’ve had to throw away. So disappointing!"
2.0,Size not true to description. Squared at bottom of shirt not tailed.
2.0,The gold faded after a few wear. Was kind of disappointed.
2.0,Ummm super see through.... you have to wear nude bra and underwear AND a slip<br />Maybe a good cover up for a bathing suit but not for everyday use
2.0,Tinier and more delicate than expected
2.0,"These aren't worth the price.  They just aren't built like other shades at this price point and seem like they would be better suited for some high end gas station or truck stop glasses.  Lenses are creaky, they aren't tight in the frame.  The brand name MADSON OF AMERICA implies it's an American product, as it is also stamped on the inside of the frame arms, but it's made in China."
2.0,I didn’t like that the face mask was impeding me breathing correctly due to the material the face mask is made.  Obstructing the air to come in and out.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:f191229150686e261b42ce9be60bfe05]] Me gustó la calidad i se mira bien pero no tiene el broche y no puedo usarlo me gustaría que revisen mejor antes de enviar
2.0,"For me, each eye frame was kind of bit elongated wide n would not fit perfectly in each eye socket. Had to return."
2.0,It is much shorter than it appears in the picture
2.0,String broke quick after wearing once. It sits as decor on my work desk now
2.0,Usually wear size 12 and purchased XL based on sizing chart. It was uncomfortably small in the arms. Incredibly itchy. Frumpy and unflattering. Returning.
2.0,This shirt was very wide and the material is poor quality
2.0,run a little snug.
2.0,I was disappointed in this item...because when I got it... it was in unassembled and in many pieces.  I tried to connect it but couldn't figure out how.
2.0,"The complain is that the zipper broke the first time I used it, dress is gorgeous but the zipper quality sucks"
2.0,Not a fan of the material and turned out to be larger than expected.
2.0,"Yikes, very seethough! Ordered the white with grey, would not be able to wear without a slip."
2.0,"I am very upset, the color is very light, it is gray-blue, not dark gray.  The quality of sewing is poor.  The pocket is not stitched in it with a big hole, and near the zipper on the chest everything is badly processed. The rubber on the bottom and on the sleeves is very soft and of poor quality."
2.0,Not very absorbant. I guess it's hit & miss as to who it works for & who it doesn't. I thought they were just too thick too.
2.0,The material and fits small
2.0,"Instead of smoothing lines, it created more! The length is great and it’s very soft, but it shrank after first wash in cool water. It gathers and shows under clothing. Will not be able to wear."
2.0,"Well, I am disappointed. The product arrived and there was a huge split in the seem down the center of the bust...it looked like a peekaboo top (but only on one side). I have had to return it and now the product says that I can't get a replacement until 1 week from now..."
2.0,"These are ridiculously comfortable and soft for the price. I love them except for the fact that they came with runs and snags!! The fit is great, im 5'4"" 140lbs and ordered large. Would be 5 stars if they weren't messed up. Disappointed."
2.0,"Fit wise it is great but the color was not good. The black in the skirt is washed out and brown,  the Redbox is pink.  Looks like the dress was bleached out in the sun."
2.0,These are great until the bar inside that provides support come screaming out of the stitching. The quality is not there for longevity.  The sizes run small so measure real good and order a size or two bigger.
2.0,Ehhh- not good quality at all.  Nice idea but nah.  Not a good bracelet!
2.0,"Bought these to use for an annual grill out. A serious 100+ burgers grill out. In past years I would literally stick my face into a fan because my eyes burned so bad at grill time. These glasses were better than not wearing any glasses, but I've worn some snug sunglasses in past years and had similar results. Not horrible, but not 100% effective. Effectiveness may vary by face shape or a tight strap attached may make them more effective."
2.0,"I bought this in a size small and the color brick red. The fit wasn't bad. The material was a little rough, but nothing that made me uncomfortable. I did return the product because the color was an orange color that I just didn't like and not a brick red."
2.0,Unfortunately this wig looked nothing like the picture and was not very Betty boop like.
2.0,It was to small. It came with an extender which was a bad sign.
2.0,I got it in A medium & it was too small
2.0,"Thought that they were unisxed sized. Way, way too small. Gave them away to someone with a MUCH smaller foot. Otherwise looked pretty nice."
2.0,Not happy with these gloves they feel cheap especially for the price I paid. Theses gloves are not breathable they are extremely hot. The gloves did not fit well a lot of extra room especially in the pinky.
2.0,I didn't even try it on because as soon as I took it out of the package it smelled like smoke and I could see it was very see thru.
2.0,Not a flattering cut for me. Runs big compared to the size chart.
2.0,"I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, and I've to return it, almost immediately.<br /><br />Just opening the package, I knew we already started with the wrong foot, the shirt wasn't well packed, it looked cheap and scruffy. Then, it came the main dish, the shirt itself, not impressed, it looks way darker than at the pictures, just as many others reviewers stated, and darker could mean something good, but not in this case, it looks cheap again. Talking about the size, wrong again, this medium size was too big, it was almost a full size more than I'm used to with medium sizes. Finally, the quality and texture of the shirt are not bad, the material is thick enough, and soft, the buttons are ok, regular dark plastic buttons.<br /><br />Conclusion, I returned it almost instantaneously, without hesitation at all, wrong size, cheap packaging, not looking good set of color, nothing impress me, so packed again and bye.<br /><br />Couldn't recommend it, at least not in this life ;)"
2.0,Good quality but very bulky.  The fold out card slots made it Not a slim fit wallet at all . Returned because husband didn’t like how thick it was once filled.
2.0,"This wristlet is fake; but it functionally does what I need it to do. Unfortunate to have paid such a high price, as I’ve owned 2 genuine Coach wristlets in the past."
2.0,"I usually wear a medium and I had to send it back for a Large.  It is still not as long, or stretchy, or soft as I had hoped but I will wear them."
2.0,"I am 5'4 . 230lbs . Size 18/20 I'm pants . Overall these just were too tight . The matteral was amazing,but the fit again not so much . I felt like it was tight around my whole upper area (bottom,waist etc) .  If they didn't fit tight, I would have kept them. Great for probably for 14/16 for XXL. Not so much 18/20+ :("
2.0,"I should have ordered a larger size, was disappointed with sizing."
2.0,"I was quite disappointed! This pendant is too large (for my taste, anyway). The chain is short, this makes the heart pendant look even bigger and unrealistic!"
2.0,Returned these shorts. The hip pocket would not even fit a standard size wallet. The material was also very thin and looked cheap imo.
2.0,"This is a good product but was bought as a gift, the receiver didn`t like it for the band size, it made her wrist look too large with the size of the dial in comparison to the band itself. Quality of the watch is too poor."
2.0,Nice shape and good material except the stone fell out. Not the easiest thing to put back.
2.0,This dress is not one size fits all. 88 is a Korean size for L/XL. I'm 55 for XS/S. The dress is huge on me. I will have to return it. I'm disappointed that it took a long time to get it and it doesn't fit.
2.0,"Why in the world would Amazon ship this is a flat, paper mailer and not a box… Outer packaging was dinged up on the sides. Contents like the cleaning cloth and tools just thrown inside the box underneath the watch. Watch incorrectly placed on the the little pillow that holds it in place in the box so the box lid came not fitting correctly. Watch itself seems cheap. It’s not light but still doesn’t have a quality feel. Watch came pre wound and was running when I opened the box. The listing pictures make it look nicer than it is. In person it’s a but underwhelming. Would recommend if you’re going to spend this kind of money on a watch spend it elsewhere."
2.0,Somewhat to big.
2.0,"I like the idea of this belt. It is an interesting design concept as I like the idea of having an infinitely adjustable belt. But unfortunately where it stands tall on promise, it falls short on delivery. After having had this belt for a few months now, it is starting to slip on its own. I'm just a regular guy and only wear it during the day while I'm at work. I have another belt that I wear when I'm home and working in my shop or running errands. So it hasn't encountered any harsh or undue wear. The trouble seems to be in the ratcheting or latching mechanism. That part is made of plastic and I suppose over some time and usage it's simply wearing at the point of contact to the point where it is slipping and letting go. I don't think it is simply a dud as the belt held quite snugly when I first received it. If they could fix the little problem of it holding up my britches, I would consider buying another, but I've about had it with this one. Will be looking for a new one very soon."
2.0,Wrong size delivered. It's cute but now I won't be be able to wear to the event I originally purchased it for. Disappointed.
2.0,The picture showed glitter. Nothing at all like the pic. The hair piece is a piece of material you tie yourself. Was disappointed because it was a gift for a friend
2.0,White stitching makes it look cheap! Not as shown
2.0,To many duplicates
2.0,These pants are almost perfect fit like a glove but the material is so thin you can see right threw so they are basically garbage but the fit being so perfect really makes it disappointing I can’t ever wear them :(
2.0,I washed this when I got them and for some reason the nose piece on 5 out of the 6 mask are in the wrong place and will not move to be able to use them(they are glued in place it seems)! Very frustrated because I really liked the one that worked properly!
2.0,The sizes are not accurate. I purchased the yellow version from another company on Amazon and the XL fit according to the 16/18 size chart. This dress fits more like 12/14 in the black and yellow color.
2.0,Product arrived on time and looking good.  Shirt is very heavy and waaay too relaxed.  What in the world is going on with work shirts these days.  This shirt is an Xl but should be callled and “XL for pregnant women.”  I would never wear this to work as I would worry about it getting caught in a fan motor belt.  Same idea why we don’t wear ties as a mechanic.  Stop with the over relaxed shirts that hang to our knees.  Or just make “XL+” shirts that way we know that it’s made for beer bellies!
2.0,I didn't like it at all and returned it. The material is cotton with no give at all. It was very cute for a slender size person. I have curves and it was not flattering at all.
2.0,It Broke after a couple months. The plastic on inside came out of seams so made it pretty much useless.
2.0,"Frankly, this isn't so much of a 'pocket square' holder, as it is a handkerchief clip.  Definitely nothing 'square' is being held in this thing.  This is a pretty poorly made product - and I didn't expect much for the price; I bought it as an experiment.  But even for the price, this thing is not good. My instinct knew a 2-pack at this price was a red flag.<br /><br />The material is comically thick and heavy, does not fit well in any of my suit pockets.  It looks more like a beer koozie than anything else, really.  The opening at the top is far more narrow than the suit pocket itself, so it does not allow for a clean fit for the pocket square without bunching up, (especially if you're going for any clean folds).  Yet at its widest (in the middle) it is almost too large, and causes the suit pocket to puff and not lie closed/flat.  And the enormous tag on the side doesn't add any convenience to getting it in and out of the pocket, either.<br /><br />If you like wearing your pocket squares in any other style than a casual puff fold, this is not a good choice."
2.0,"Beautiful pajama set, buy made very small"
2.0,"See through, didn’t expect cheap line."
2.0,Feathers are damaged but the rest of the earrings are ok. I think feathers were damaged when the consumer packaged the item?...
2.0,I didn't like the material or the size.
2.0,the jump ring wasn't closed. luckily I know how to repair jewelry. but so not worth what i paid.
2.0,"These run small.  The strap does adjust, but still fairly small.  Those with big heads, be warned."
2.0,The bag is great but i can't wear it because It smells really bad.
2.0,Not as bright as I expected. I like that they are light weight. Would not buy again.
2.0,Fit nice but cheap material
2.0,I purchased a C and something doesn’t feel secure. My boobs fall and the adhesive doesn’t stick.
2.0,"The shirt fits to size, however the sewing of the product is not r or under at the shoulders, it is straight lines following the pattern of the material so at the shoulders it looks off."
2.0,Sizes are not as descirbed
2.0,"Wouldnt lay right. ""Diamonds"" kept facing against my neck where you xouldnt see them."
2.0,Too short & puffy<br /><br />Material & Metallic Color are nice though<br /><br />Will be returning
2.0,"I’m 5”7’ 115/120.. i ordered a size medium and it’s two sizes too small! I say that because I can get them on but I’m not gonna be very comfortable, the waist is way too tight shame there a very good material"
2.0,"I was sent a returned item that was damaged, other than that the the band was nice"
2.0,"I ordered these leggings expecting them to be skinny’s, I received bell bottomed leggings. They are great material and very comfortable so, I will take the bell bottoms, but I definitely won’t be buying from them again."
2.0,"I like the shirt but if you're expecting pink, it's not pink.  It's peach.  Not pink at all."
2.0,I disliked how these shoes gave my daughter blisters on her heals and the blue color came off.
2.0,I never wore this outfit due to the fact I did not like it in person and its too flared for me.Wasn't  a bad outfit but since im a bigger girl with a gut it was not something I was really into style was when I purchased it
2.0,bought for my six month niece but they fit my 15 month old daughter
2.0,There is NO stretch so it was too small for my hips. I also did not like where the wrap tie sat. I felt it just highlighted the mid-section.
2.0,Sizing was different than a previous different print. Wish there was more consistency.
2.0,"This dress is way too short.  I'm 5'6&#34;, 160#.  Fit of size 8 was a little tight in the arms; had the dress been more appropriate in length, I could've worn the 8, but 10 would've been better.  Regardless, I'm in my mid-30s so I need to be able to lift my arms without showing everything.  It was returned!"
2.0,I should have looked more carefully.  I thought it would be like my last silicone band that has a quick button connection.  Instead this uses an ancient style of clasp that takes 2-3 times as long to attach to your write.
2.0,"These aren't the best boots in the world, sadly I guess I was picturing something else.<br />They are ok, I have worn them, but they aren't that great - they smell kind of funny, like the materials came from a factory full of chemicals."
2.0,"Much smaller than I thought it would be and the chain did not last anytime, had to find a replacement chain for the pendant."
2.0,Defiantly not easy on . Could not see any difference from regular compression socks.
2.0,This jacket looks almost white in the picture but is grey. Don't order if you're looking for a white jacket
2.0,"See above.  Ordered 2, second one is flimsy and faded."
2.0,"I don’t know why people like this dress. It’s quite oversized and I didn’t find it flattering. Also, the material is a cheap and shiny sort of polyester. And I bought to initially be part of a costume but even for that it seemed too short pensive for what you get."
2.0,"Boxy, very odd cut. Huge in the front.  Shaped like a tent"
2.0,I’m not sure ... keeps sliding down. Have to pull up and it’s uncomfortable
2.0,The material was seemed sloppily assembled
2.0,"Speaking of each of the 3 brown ones, the left arm fell off either the first time or within the first 10 times of wearing them. The arm would fall off without warning. So far the black ones have stayed together. I bought these to have several cheap pairs of sunglasses around, since I was always misplacing mine when I just had one nicer pair. I would buy different ones if I could do it again.<br /><br />My husband doesn't like these because they warp your depth perception a little at close range, like when you're walking and look down without bending your whole head."
2.0,cheap ugly
2.0,I only received one bracelet. The metal/bead one is missing. I did receive the leather wrap one. It’s a set of two correct?
2.0,Didn’t light up
2.0,"Nice colors, but too small."
2.0,The face was too large and metal left fingerprints just by lightly handling. This product was returned.
2.0,I’ve bought other .925 and the charms did not change color. These changed color after the 2nd week.
2.0,too small and fragile
2.0,"The watch arrived dead with the crown pushed in. It might have a dead battery but I'm apprehensive about  changing the battery to test whether it is the battery or the actual watch that is defective. If the watch gets accidentally scratched while changing the battery, returning it might not become an option if it is really the watch that is defective."
2.0,The shoes look nice and fit well for generic style shoe.  But the lights wouldn’t work and the smell was horrible.  Retuned immediately.
2.0,Butterfly and palm tree ones are much smaller in size (Around the face) than the flame one.  Disappointed on that aspect but they are very well made and so pretty.
2.0,"The the little metal bar holding the band to watch got deformed so easily, and is useless now after only a few wears. Poor quality."
2.0,"They provided decent warmth during the colder days, but as far as being oil proof they are not. Two days into wearing them and the oil bled through. It wasn't cloth material rubbing off it was oil."
2.0,These did not work and the decorative accents all pealed off within a few hours or wearing them.  I bought them more for the arthritis than the cosmetic appeal.  Unfortunately both were a disappointment for me.
2.0,"I was really excited to receive this but did not met my expectations. It is very slippery and hard to manipulate therefore, it was very difficult to take pictures"
2.0,"Handle is so stiff that it is very uncomfortable on the shoulder;  the &#34;pockets&#34; on the inside are nothing more than mesh netting.  Disappointing item, but Amazon made my return very easy."
2.0,"This dress has an interesting cut that seems like it could be really flattering.<br />Once again, the lesson that you get what you pay for applies to this dress.<br />The elestic waistband is awkward and hits right below the bust line making it difficult to even add a belt at the natural waistline to create some shape.<br />I’m 5’4 34 D and I weigh about 170.<br />I ordered a large & it’s too big?!<br /> Last but not least the fabric feels like a very thin low quality synthetic fabric that a fast food restaurant uniform might be made out of. Basically it’s not a fabric that feels nice on the body..<br />Having said this.. I’m going to wash it to see if the fabric is improved somehow, & I’ll find a belt to try to reconsile the weird electric wsist."
2.0,The glasses hurt my nose - scratchy so i returned!!
2.0,"These are so hard to out on. There is not enough stretch to them. My son couldn’t put them on by himself and he’s 13. I feel like you have to be super strong to put them on. He said they feel good once they are on, he just doesn’t like that he can’t put them on on his own and it took about 20 minutes to put them on. Very disappointed with this  buy.  I might consider returning them."
2.0,The on and off button pop out.  Not so durable.
2.0,"Dress is well made.  Fabric is heavy, not the light weight jersey that this type of dress is often made with.  With this in mind, it does not stretch as easily/much as expected and would be warm.  Because of this, I am returning."
2.0,"Fits good, but because of the silicone material, it doesn't allow for easy adjustment of the loops the hold the band down.  It feels like it's going to tear.  I removed it and put a different band on made of a different material."
2.0,"Material is very thin and dress is not made to fit loose or off the shoulder. I am curvy & wear a size 10, but this dress does not hang like the pic. I ended up returning it for the next size up (XXL) and it still does fit loose or off the shoulder. Will probably return this new black one, too."
2.0,The tag in the middle of one sock was stuck resulting in a hole and a wasted sock. The tiger was my daughter's favorite. I wish they were more thoughtful and had packaged the socks in a different way.
2.0,"Not at all what we expected, and was a little awkward to put on. Plus, it ran a little small."
2.0,Kept falling off when I pulled it over my face and nose. It’s too big.
2.0,"I got this for my husband who is not large, but nearly ripped through it. Very tiny sweater!"
2.0,"Terrible color, I returned them"
2.0,"The version I got came with heavy duty rubber bands.  These will tear every 2-3 months and then you are screwed.  I did contact the manufacturer, and they promptly sent me replacement band.  But that doesn't solve the problem..."
2.0,It had a hole in it.  I have several of the tops from this seller and was disappointed to receive this one.  I'd already thrown away all the packaging etc so I can't even send it back.
2.0,It’s all one material they “jacket” is not a separate piece or look like a separate piece it’s just dyed on. Wasn’t a fan of that
2.0,Too small of a band.
2.0,I was hoping to use these flip up sunglasses while out cutting grass so that I can just flip them up when it gets dark or if I need to go into the shed and get gas. Unfortunately the lenses seems hazy and annoying. It might be the light reflecting between the lenses of my prescription glasses and these flip up lenses.  Or I might be too spoiled by my crystal clear prescription sunglasses. Either way I don't like them and wouldn't recommend them.
2.0,Sized very small.
2.0,Not as comfortable as I expected.
2.0,"Seams flimsy. Very delicate. Otherwise, it is as advertised."
2.0,This fit pretty weird so I returned it.
2.0,Dress is not as long as the photo displays. It is a stiff polyester and uncomfortable.
2.0,"Pros: like the natural color, the lace sleeves, the fact that it's 100% cotton, the jagged edged sew job.<br />Cons: I wear a size large, really received a large, and it looks and feels like an xxxl. Tent like. Makes it appear frumpy and makes me look 3x bigger. On the bright side, since it's cotton, there's a good chance it'll shrink in the dryer, but overall it missed the mark for me."
2.0,"I am extremely disappointed that I am not able to return this item because the shipping is as much as the cost of the item. I will NEVER buy ANYTHING from China again, I lose money and the items normally don't fit me"
2.0,I ordered a 2x but the shiry was very tight across the bust. The top is from China.The top was well packaged without any wrinkles or bad smell.
2.0,"I ordered these in white. Perfect fit, very comfortable by fully see-thru."
2.0,"Ordered a large, felt like a XL. Ordered a medium, felt like a small. These amazon shirt printers are seriously garbage, they all use the worst possible t shirts to print graphics on. It's seriously annoying. All of the worst shirts I've ever bought came from Amazon sellers."
2.0,"Hello - So I bought this tie for my sons Senior Prom.  Once I received it and started to check it out.  It's put together with what seems to be iron on seam tape.  Then lightly stitched together.  In other words a man that takes care of ties, might be okay, but a young man that is rough on clothes, it'll come apart."
2.0,Zippers are poor quality. Broke on first hiking trip in the Grand Tetons.
2.0,"Used it to put drops of my essential oils.  The lava stone turned blue when EOs were applied and it colored my wrist blue, too."
2.0,I have 4 pr. Of these in different colors but this item Waistband was around 1 1/2 inches smaller than my other's.
2.0,bad fabric :/ the belt is already frayed after one day of use
2.0,"The back of the dress was super sexy on, however, the material is wayyy too thin across the stomach. I am 5' 4'', 160 lb, with a 29&#34; waist, and 34&#34; hips and ordered the large. The dress fit perfect but the material was not as expected. I like to think that my waist is pretty slim compared to all of my weight being carried in my butt and hips. However, if you normally get bloated after a meal then this dress is not for you. This dress is not cotton so it clings to every little bloat and roll. Would definitely keep the dress if the material was cotton. If you are pencil thin then this dress would work."
2.0,The item is as described but I cannot recommend it.  It is two hot and humid if you are walking around.
2.0,No shape! Not flattering for my pear shaped body!
2.0,"I wish the vibrancy of the colors in the dress were matched by the fabric quality, but alas that is not so. It's also the reason I have yet be able to wear this at all without significant adjustments (like adding a lining) or wearing a ridiculous amount of body smoothing undergarments."
2.0,"Runs small but cute. Order a size up, I would but they don’t make it so sending back."
2.0,"These are pretty much gojo wipes with some unknown (nothing on the box) ingredients. I’ve got 20+ new era and Mitchell and Ness hats and got these to try and save money by cleaning multiple hats with one wipe?  there wasn’t enough moisture for one hat…and at this price?  Great idea, not sure about the execution."
2.0,"The product was fine. The kids love playing with them, they are fun and a nice, inexpensive thing to add to a holiday goody bag.<br />The two stars is because 20% (8 out of 40) didn't work, which is a fairly high defective percentage. I bought these for my son's class and fortunately I only needed 28. If I had needed three more, I wouldn't have had enough for everyone.<br /><br />I e-mailed Amazon and their customer service was fantastic. Because they were just the fulfillment center, they couldn't resend me the product, but they did reimburse me a portion of the cost, which I appreciated, but again, if I had just a few more students, a refund wouldn't help the situation.<br /><br />Now I'm a bit worried that of the ones that do work, the working life may be limited."
2.0,Nice glasses by WAY too small. Be careful with the size before ordering especially for the amount of money!
2.0,Too tight across hips and chest. It must be Asian sizing.
2.0,"Hat came in a envelope, couldn't reshape. It was a joke, not worth the money."
2.0,"I was told this is a realistic mask, yet no one in the office was fooled!<br />I am very upset.<br /><br />The reason I gave it two stars was I really love Freddy Mercury."
2.0,I was hoping for something with a bit more quality. These look cheap and for that I’m disappointed
2.0,Tops straps are way to out of control.  Shouldn't be that hard to put on a b-suit top :-)
2.0,"I wanted a light sweater to wear with sleeveless shirts in the warm weather, but this one is so thin that you can see right through it. It just looks super cheap.  It was also really wide for me, it just all around looked ridiculous.  I will be returning this."
2.0,Um. The size is on point sure. They do look to have the old Marlboro looking logo embroidered into them. But my goodness! As soon as I took them out of the bag I smelled a wretched smell! Like fish! It was strong and off putting. Just really odd!
2.0,"This came with no size I ordered a 9-10 for my granddaughter for Xmas so I don’t know if will fit ? Is it a 9-10 I just don’t know , also it’s line dry what young family is going to take such care ? It’s very thin . That’s why I’m only giving it a 2 star not know if is a 9-10 is very discouraging !!!"
2.0,"The dress is cute. The v-neck could use a snap or hook. The fabric was very cheap. Had there been someway to not have the v-neck cut so deep, I might have overlooked the fabric & just worn as a one-season throw away Summer dress. I returned the dress for a refund."
2.0,Runs small- also VERY thin material. Overall wasn’t too impressed but needed it for work so just kept it.
2.0,"I’m disappointed in what I received. The color is not the same and it is v neck not scoop neck like it was suppose to be. It fits like it should though. I ordered the one on the left in the pic but as you can see, not what I received on the right!"
2.0,"Not very good quality and I couldn't even get the ball off because it was on so tight, the paint chipped off just trying to loosen it"
2.0,I wish these would have fit I liked the color
2.0,Sugar gliter color = Not at all the color depicted. It is not bubble gum pink but neon pink. Guess I should've been suspect since they couldn't spell it correctly.
2.0,Would like to return and get size med.
2.0,"I used to wear Costco's Hathaway knit boxer briefs, but cant get them anymore so looking for a replacement.  I thought i'd found them here, but ultimately not.  I saw the reviews saying they run small, and since i would normally wear a medium (33 waist), I ordered a Large.  And they actually fit pretty nice everywhere except the waistband. And even that is close, the problem is the elastic.  It's really very strong, so i'd guess it's fine if your fit is dead on perfect, but if a little snug in the waist, these are uncomfortable. They just don't &#34;give&#34; enough.  It's possible they would relax over time, but i know i wont wear them till they get that way. I just know it.<br />I even held them up next to my Hathaways and they are almost the exact same size, but the Hathaway waistband gives much more easily.  Bottom line: they just weren't comfortable for me.  I must say, they seem well made and were it not for this issue, i definitely would have kept them"
2.0,"Flimsy material, cheap looking. Had to print return label and pay for packaging to return it. They can't just scan the bar code at ups"
2.0,BAD QUALITY!! DOESNT WORTH A PENNY!!! IF I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK I WOULD HAVE REQUESTED A REFUND!!
2.0,The leg length is fine and the pockets are great. But the length from crotch to waist seems huge requiring the pants to be worn too high. That means you need to fold over the waistband for the right fit but then the zipper pockets are covered.
2.0,I like the fit but the slightest drop of liquid or sweat and the colour runs onto whatever you happen to be wearing over it and it leaves an ugly stain.
2.0,"This fit super weird, I tried both a medium and a small and the mediums straps were so long! And the small torso was too short- I really wanted to love this and I couldn’t- I am 5’7” 140lbs and a 36DD for reference- most body suits fit me in either a medium or a small- but this was just weird"
2.0,Maybe if you are 6’ tall. These are extremely long and I’m 5’6.
2.0,"Cheap fabric. Appears and feels insubstantial.<br />No information on how to launder. Because of the light print and flimsiness of the fabric, I am concerned about putting it in the washer and dryer.<br />No tag to inform purchaser.<br />I would not buy again."
2.0,The photos shown in description are not accurate. I am disappointed there was no dust bag with my rather pricey bag. All my other Michael Kors bags have come with the dust bag.
2.0,I was so excited to receive my order until I opened the package.  The top is NOT as pictured.  It is actually about 12” shorter. So if you are looking for a training dress this is not it.
2.0,"This was way smaller than I thought it'd be. The gold lettering is really hard to read when you're wearing it. It is a very nice little pin though, just wish it would've been a little bigger."
2.0,It’s to short it rides up over my chest. I can only wear it under something else.
2.0,It’s super cute I ordered a extra large but it fit like a smedium (small/medium) I guess I’ll just have to lose weight!
2.0,I absolutely loved these earrings when I got them. But I've had them for like 2 months and I've been wearing them daily. I've been having a problem with the little ' diamonds' falling off everytime I touch my earring. I'm just really mad that this is happening.
2.0,Wife loves it but smaller than I assumed
2.0,Chain too short.
2.0,"The head hole and hood are both weirdly small compared to the rest of the sweatshirt. I bought the 2T for my daughter, and even though the body of the sweatshirt fits her with room to spare, I could barely squeeze it over her head to put it on, and the hood is so small it can't be worn. Either we got a defective one, or these are just poorly made."
2.0,"The colors are darker in the photo and less campy looking. It is more of a Native American look, and that wasn’t what I was going for.  The top ran large and it is made of sheer nylon. Meh."
2.0,"didnt work, only 2 out of 10 worked"
2.0,Pretty disappointed about how the earrings make my piercings bleed.  Every time I wear them my ears hurt.  I have other earrings that say nickel free and no problems.  So I’m wondering what kind of metal these really are.  Kept on holding off returning them hoping it wasn’t the earrings causing pain but now I know and too late to return. Buyer beware
2.0,The bottoms are cute but the top was literally hanging off of my niece. She’s thin but it should’ve fit much better. The straps were very flimsy too. I wouldn’t buy this again. The top needs major work.
2.0,"I loved the material of this dress because it clings in all the right places. It runs slighty on the small side, especially if you have a donk and/or boobs, but I still was able to wear the small without THAT being the problem. The deal breaker for me was the slit! Even without taking one step, it was way too inappropriately high and definitely wouldn't feel comfortable when in public because of constant fear of indecent exposure. And it's not like height was a factor - I'm 5'0""!!!<br /> I liked the dress so much that I thought about somehow reinforcing the fabric together further down the split, but that just made it too tight in the hips. Sad to have to return it, but very surprised no one has brought this up before."
2.0,It's a headband all right but not much use for sweat. This is a fashion accessory not for sports.
2.0,Was rough around the edges
2.0,This is fine to use if you're in a pinch.
2.0,"Beautiful fit, but the dye leaves water marks that don't wah away if you drop water on it or get caught in the rain. It's a shame beside the blouse is super flattering."
2.0,"The dress is nice and color is nice but the dress had hole in it. Got a large fits nice ,color is nice too if you are thick it can be a little see through but if you wear the right undergarment it’s fine."
2.0,These feel great but I have a pony tail in and the beanie on the beanie doesn’t completely cover my ear lobes. Almost like it’s a little small for an adult. Maybe I have a big head (I’ve never been told this). The quality and colors are great though and they may fit other people’s heads just fine. But ears should be covered in winter with a beanie and it does not do this for me.
2.0,Gloves run small and tear over time
2.0,Once again this dress fits odd but the thing I disliked most about it was the bright White showing on the cape it just makes it look  VERY Cheap 😞💔 it fit for the most part but quite baggy in the waist again
2.0,The torso is much too short! Even for 5'4. Will be returning - buy a size up!
2.0,"Fit was fine, material was cheep and not breathable"
2.0,"didn't fit at all , cat ears came broken , it was a s***ty dress and the material it was made out of was crappy as well it was returned not worth your money tbh especially if you have a different body shape"
2.0,Way too small in the sizing.  Pretty thick.  Too expensive
2.0,While they are made well and look nice they are extremely small! I would say they are child size. My mother has very small wrists and even on her these didn't fit all the way around. The material itself is high quality.  The bracelets are heavy and the shine on them is good. It is shiny to look like it is polished but not so much so that it looks like gaudy costume jewelry. I would say that the silver looks better then the gold. The gold is a little to yellow looking for my taste. I wish I could wear them but unfortunately they are way to small. I only think they would be comfortable for a child or someone with child sized wrists.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my honest review.
2.0,Thin material ripped easily on first wear (black pair)<br />Blue and gray are holding up so far but each have only been worn twice
2.0,Didn’t end up keeping it
2.0,I wasn't expecting much due to the price; but the picture is not at all what comes.  The necklace is WAY more Yellow than cream looking and just looks super cheap!<br /><br />Save your money.
2.0,They don't stay up on your face and the filters fall out of the pocket. I would not purchase this item.
2.0,far smaller then what I was expecting
2.0,The bracelets are obviously cheap but the watch is pretty. Unfortunately it fell apart after wearing it for 30 minutes.
2.0,Ball fell off on hat
2.0,"Picture shows an automatic, description is accurate as it is a quartz, but mine came not working. Back looks like a rolex screw down crown which you need a special wrench to get open, but upon further examination, you can see the area around the watch back where you can pry it off. Best of luck to you with that. I have tried just about everything I can think of to get that sucker off and it won't budge. I'm starting to think that it really is a screw down back and the makers put that notch in the back as a cruel joke. One description says it is a 40mm case, another has it listed as a 43. For sure it is a 43mm. If you decide to buy this watch, here's hoping your battery is working. Mine is still sitting on my desk with a dead battery and a caseback I can't open."
2.0,I loved this coat for about 2 weeks. It is so warm and fit great. After about 2 weeks i noticed the shoulder stitching had a hole in it. After i looked closer i realized the stitching came undone and the whole arm piece is coming apart. I tried fix it but now its very noticable and i wont wear it again. I went from loving this coat to throwing it out in just a couple weeks.
2.0,I put these in my kids shoes for his first day at daycare. He came home wearing the stickers on his shirt.<br />They didn't stick...
2.0,The zipper broke the very first day I got it t
2.0,"This is a beautiful, warm coat. However, I am happy with the quality. I've had it since the beginning of November 2015 and right away I noticed multiple threads hanging all over the coat. Soon after that, I noticed holes in the pockets. Just yesterday the loop that holds the buckle broke.<br />I am highly upset because I take great care of my garments and this coast is just falling apart. It hasn't made it through 1 winter."
2.0,The fake leather is sooooo stiff it hurts to wear. Really need to be broken in
2.0,"The pink panda material had a very NICE feel to the material & was cute as punch, but they were just way TOO SMALL for me. I normally wear a medium in most shirts & shorts, but every now and then I need a large. Therefore, because of some of the reviews I read, I decided to order the large just to be on the cautious side. Unfortunately, these were still way too small & actually looked more like a small when I held them up. Also, the shirt looked like a half shirt because it was wide, but very short in length & I didnt care for that. As a result, I did return this pair & purchased another brand that was perfect. I positively hated that I had to return these because they were just so stinking cute! So.... with that said..... as long as you order a minimum of 1 size larger, maybe even two, you should be fine and you will love them!"
2.0,The color is brighter in person and the sizing is pretty off. I ordered an XL and it is really a medium. The fabric also feels thin albeit comfortable. The front of the skirt piece overlaps but the bust and back are definitely a bit more see through. Unfortunately I’m returning this.
2.0,"Loved the colors & I purchased at a great price, BUT was so disappointed to find them hanging low in back, yet too short in front to provide good coverage in pubic area.  This was visibly noticeable upon opening package & proved true after donning them.  Would have purchased again if not for this. In addition, when turned inside out, every pair seems to have a “repaired” mistake in the same side & area.  The waist band is also too tight for size 8 briefs; no comparison to VF briefs.  Pix attached😟"
2.0,These are lightweight. They fit more like harem pants than joggers. The waist has an elastic band to hold it up and it feels cheep.<br /><br />Not a great style.
2.0,"I love this watch band but I’ve only had it a couple of weeks and the velcro has started to come off! This wears great and is very comfortable, just wish it would have lasted longer."
2.0,NOT THE BEST QUALITY
2.0,These are a terrible product.  The only reason I gave them 2 stars was because I like how shiny they are.  I ordered large.  I am 5'9 and 150 pounds and they were so short on me.  I'm guessing I should have ordered 2 sizes up.  They are also so ridiculously see through.
2.0,"flimsy, poorly constructed, lenses prone to being scratched by the case. It arrived with most of the screws not tight allowing the lenses and frame elements to roll around, you could easily turn the two lenses into a right angle from each other! Nose pads were back so far the lens edges sat against my nose anyway. These should be sold for about 25 cents, that's all they're worth."
2.0,"Doesn’t work as great as it should, if you’re using liquid it spills over the sides."
2.0,"Love the fit, finish, and waistband. PISSSSSSED that the first time I wore them they had tons of holes."
2.0,"I buy a lot of clothing online and use the reviews to help determine sizing.  I am a size 6 and ordered the medium which was way too small,  Material is somewhat flimsy.  Not impressed."
2.0,I bought a size too big.
2.0,"I ordered this set because my daughter loves the Komar sets with silky pajama bottoms. What I received was this top but the bottoms are a green colored almost flannel material, the print matches the reindeer's scarf. They are cute still and good quality but not at all what is pictured. Not sure if I will keep or not."
2.0,This thing is HUGE. TBH I didn’t read the details but this thing is much larger than I would ever actually wear.
2.0,These pretty earnings came without backs. Disappointed!!
2.0,"Even though I wear an XL, this shirt was labeled as XL and it was way too small.  If made in China it would fit small bodies, not XL ones."
2.0,"I purchased the white multicolored. It is not a wrap dress, which was the whole reason why I liked the dress to begin with. Will be returning. I am thinking this is just an issue with the color I purchased since others have posted pictures where it's clearly a wrap dress."
2.0,"Broke within two uses of wearing them, the plastic is not durable at all."
2.0,This is the most unflattering dress i've ever ordered. The chest area is way too big and gapes open on the side of your arms. it's definitely disproportional in many areas.
2.0,"Really cute, but very uncomfortable."
2.0,Not well made.  I had to return
2.0,"the inner section is only glued on and came off shortly after purchasing it.  I paid too much for it to do that.<br />I did love the look of it, and that is why I bought it in the first place."
2.0,They are too small and let the light in. I have to return them.
2.0,"Don't get me wrong it's a pretty cool hat but it fits so small, also from the shipping coming and I bag instead of a box it messed up the shape of the hat it's not straight the hat part it at an angle and not straight across when you have it on"
2.0,"I'm a size 12-14 (5'9&#34;), so I ordered a L like the size chart indicated. I could get them on, but they were tight! I have larger thighs and hips, so maybe if you're thinner on the bottom they'd fit, but not for a bottom-heavy person."
2.0,"Another alignment issue from Seiko - received a used watch that someone else obviously returned.  Hang tag off, re-applied caseback sticker, bubble wrap around the watch (must be new Seiko packaging, lol) and the dead skin cells on the silicone was the icing on the cake. This review will probably be censored but at least I try to warn others."
2.0,"I ordered the wrong size, to begin with. But even large seamed way to small. Possible this review may be unfair to an extent.  Felt as there is too much material that works against each other.  Looks better in pictures than it is. Sending them back so I didn't test water resistance."
2.0,"Super comfortable, but totally see-through! Returning, unfortunately."
2.0,"The bracelet is beautiful, but it falls from my hand easily."
2.0,"Another dress on here that looks really cute but in real life reminds me of a lace tablecloth... not fitting at all and baggy in all the wrong places.  Fabric seemed of good quality and was heavy, but not what I was after at all."
2.0,I was so disappointed.  I ordered a size up and it is still too tight in the hips. It was already to large in the upper body. It I order any larger it would look really crazy.
2.0,"Pretty, but they are top heavy. They don't stay up the the ear."
2.0,"They were a lot smaller than I thought, I gave them to my little cousin"
2.0,why this product it is not the same brand as the one with the yellow style and padding ?
2.0,Not tight enough.
2.0,The manual hands will not stay in time with the digital clock so the watch is constantly out of  sync with itself and reading 2 separate times.
2.0,"These are light weight and the graphics are nice. My son, however, had great difficulty with them staying on. He doesn't use them at all. Would not buy this style again."
2.0,"Quality leather, but the zipper catches around the corners, not smooth."
2.0,"Poor quality stitching, poor quality material<br />Looked nothing like picture! Small fit."
2.0,"I bought this set for a one time event. They looked great, and I got a  lot of compliments. The second time I wore them the necklace broke in half, so it is not very durable at all."
2.0,It fit ok at first but after it was washed it shrank.
2.0,This product is not as pictured at all! the material shown seems high-quality linen - what showed up looks like pajamas.<br />the sizing is also very small.<br />The top has potential but I will not be wearing these as a set!
2.0,"Unfortunately, this mask is too small for the standard Female American face.  If it was enlarged on all sides by 1/2 inch, it would fit better.  Any facial movement causes the mask to shift and therefore removing protection of covering the mouth and nose.  It is also very hot since it is made of a synthetic fabric.  The overall pattern is very good, it just is too skimpy to be of value"
2.0,"I'm 5'8, 130 lbs and wear a 4 or SM in most pants. The small in these was too form-fitting, particularly really tight on my calves (?? I'm not a runner). So I exchanged for a medium and there was no difference in size from the small."
2.0,Not what I was expecting.  I thought it would be a softer cotton type material.  I wanted to use them for a layering tank and they look like cheap yoga tanks.  The length in the torso was short as well.  I wasn't impressed.
2.0,TIght. Beware if you have wide feet.
2.0,The pictures didn’t really show what the design was and I’m not a fan
2.0,This item was poorly made and broke more than once.  I attempted to fix it but it broke every time I tried to wear it.
2.0,One earring came apart.  But they are cute
2.0,"Only comes just below my knees, not to my toes as shown in the picture. I am 5'.9&#34;."
2.0,Fits fine.  Weave is so thin that you can see the lining through it.
2.0,"My child is a size 1, so I ordered size 2 for her. They are too short :( Her toes hit the edge."
2.0,Had to send it back.  I am a size medium and ordered a large.  It was still too small.  Waist is also cut much higher than it looks in the photo.
2.0,The butterfly is pretty but the barbell won't screw into the butterfly.
2.0,Awkward fit to the body. If worn appropriately the crotch is dropped 3 inches.
2.0,"I purchased these pj’s for my mom’s Christmas present. I bought a large for comfort, they fit like a medium. The material is clingy and not much stretch. Size up 2x for comfort."
2.0,Not a good shirt if you’re long in the torso
2.0,V neck doesn't fit right . Feels like it pulls in the shoulders
2.0,THE MIRROR LENS HAD RUNS IN THE MIRRORING ... I SENT BACK ...
2.0,nice and light simple features but it went dead after 6 months.<br />could be the battery but 6 months - really?
2.0,Ordered 2 pair. One fit and one is so weirdly made
2.0,Crappy material ..  Polyester don't waste your time nor money
2.0,I bought the dark gray color; when I tried it on I thought it looked like a bathrobe. The material is kind of a stretchy cotton. Overall it's not what I was hoping it would be.
2.0,It’s not stretchy
2.0,Super cute but the bottoms were sewn shut. There was no way to put your legs in so we had to cut the liner and the tag was in the front of the bottoms. Would return if not needed for the bride for her bridal shower tomorrow.
2.0,I love the design but unfortunately it is only good to look at. I used it for the first time and the one of the corner ripped off like it was made of paper. Another corner ripped right off just as I stretched it out to fold it.
2.0,"It didnt come with the necklace which wasn't a big deal but if you say it will come with the dress, then make that happen. Then the dress didnt fit like it looked in the picture but I guess I shouldn't believe it 100%. It drags the floor and is cheap material. The seems are coming apart."
2.0,"Read the other posts as i should have before i bought it. Hangs crooked looks silly, cant expect much for that price. Like something you would get at a dollar store."
2.0,Waited for so long to arrived and when it did the dress was missing the sash/ waist band.  Can’t wear it.
2.0,This product was a bit of a disappointment for the price.  One leg is 4 inches longer than the other and the colors fade after one wash.
2.0,Cute design and looks as pictured but it is extremely to low and doesn't cover my boobs and I'm a size 4 height 5'3 I really didn't think I would have that problem. I will have to return it.
2.0,This is an ok shirt.  The button holes are useless. The holes are sewn shut
2.0,"I bought these, but had to instantly return them because of the strange and awkward cut around the hips and crotch. They definitely don't feel like they're made for people with wider hips or a bigger butt even though I went a couple sizes up. The fabric was good, and it wasn't see through even though it was a lighter grey pant, but ultimately did not fit."
2.0,"These shorts have great color, fun print & trim. Unfortunately they didn’t hold up. Fabric got pilly after wearing & washing twice. Now they look cheap and worn. Bummed."
2.0,"The masks are cute, but the kid ones are way too small. My 4yo won't wear them because they're too small. He says they hurt his ears. He wears other masks just fine."
2.0,"While the material seems like a very sturdy leotard, my daughter has wore this 3 times and the side seam has unravelled and created a 4in hole. No longer wearable."
2.0,very large lens size. Should be listed in specs but isn't. Perhaps better for the ladies.
2.0,This skirt runs very small. Poorly manufactured 😞
2.0,"Why do you advertise ROYAL BLUE when there pants are NAVY BLUE.  I need royal blue for work, Cannot wear Navy.  Gotta go back.  Shame on you"
2.0,I was optimistic about these sunglasses. They looked nice enough and the fit was perfect with the extra wide frame. But the quality just wasn't there. It didn't last 2 weeks before it broke. It's not a huge loss considering the price. It was worth the gamble considering some reviewers having better luck with them.
2.0,Very thin and flimsy.
2.0,"Wow, this dress made me look horrible. (M) Thankfully, Amazon is awesome about returns. It fits like a plastic rain poncho, not at all as nice as the (touched up?) photos. Flower print appears darker and more muted against the black background than the (touched up?) photos. The fabric wasn't bad, sleeves would have been better cuffed than with elastic at the wrist...but the empire waistline is cut funky and puffs out below the sash at my ribcage, making me look pregnant. The good news is that I'm not pregnant!"
2.0,Super thin and broken zipper
2.0,A little tight.  Order a size larger than you think!
2.0,Not flattering and to large
2.0,Only had them for a couple weeks and 1 pair already broke. My son is also 4 and tiny and these are snug on him. You get what you pay for !
2.0,Unfortunately the small was still larger on me.  Not really fitted either.  The cut was off and the collar was way to wide and long.
2.0,NOT animal bone. NOT Hand carved. NOT Cool.  2 piecs of cheap plastic glued together.  Molded not carved. I dropped one on my desk and it broke in half from a 1 foot fall. The only good thing is the were 6 gauge as listed.  The fangs were almost non existent. You can see the comparison from my actual hand carved bone ones to these cheap plastic ones. I'd say worth $10 bucks at most.
2.0,"This top fits as expected- loose but not baggy, still fitted enough to look nice.  The length hits me just a bit shorter than it does on the model in the photo.  It's made from a lightweight material, but it's not see-through.<br /><br />I had hoped to wear this top to work this summer with black pants, but I was disappointed to find that it arrived looking faded.  The print has a grayish cast to it, as through it's been washed and worn many times.  In the photo it looks like a crisp black and beige print, but in person it's more of a weathered gray and beige.  I guess it will have to be a casual top worn around the house instead.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this item for free in exchange for posting my honest review.  All statements and opinions expressed are my own."
2.0,Clasp was not as shown.
2.0,Too heavy. Pulled my earlobes down
2.0,"Didn't last long, wore them twice and already broke"
2.0,"not loud , bought for my bicycle so people could hear me coming , does not work for a bell effect"
2.0,Order your true size I listened to reviews AND its huge
2.0,These sandals are not true to size and fit rather large. the part that wraps around the top of the foot is so loose and shapeless that it looks like you are wearing a painted box for a shoe. They are not comfortable either. perhaps if you have very wide feet or incredibly tiny feet that you don't mind adding girth to your foot then they could work. overall very disappointed with these sandals.
2.0,Never felt quite so plump. Potato sac ish.
2.0,The material is nice however their sizing is a bit off.
2.0,It doesn’t really look like the picture it looks like a nickel rather than a dainty pendant.
2.0,Fits very small but it’s very cute for a comfy table but sexy nightwear.
2.0,Wrinkles very easily l. It arrived wrinkled and after several wash/dry/iron cycles it has yet to be wrinkle free. It is very comfortable for after work attire with leggings so I will keep it and keep searching for one that doesn’t wrinkle so easily.
2.0,"Runs really big, size down. It didn’t suit my taste so I returned it."
2.0,This shoe is not what I expected.  Although I knew it would be to big for him now. By the time he can wear it he will need much more support than what this shoe offers. :(
2.0,Not as expected!!!!
2.0,"This product isn't the way it is on the website. On the website it's very unique and beautiful with a pleated within the dress. But when I ordered it, it was very straight without the pleated. The reason I bought this product was because of the style and the pleated in the dress. I did like the colors of the dresses."
2.0,I got my usual size and this dress was too small
2.0,I originally ordered these in xl - burgundy. i loved them but the waistband was a tiny bit too tight so I ordered the black ones in 2xl. the waistband fits i guess but the thigh opening is actually SMALLER THAN THE XL. I'm so irritated!!!
2.0,I’ve done sent one back because of the way the hips was sewn. It looked like balloons sticking out. I received the replacement and it’s almost the same way. I’m not happy but I can’t send back because my deodorant got on it. Now I’ll have to pay someone to fix it so I can wear it.
2.0,Not Red.  Hot Pink.  Bent.
2.0,The necklace was rusty and had some blue bits in the inside of the pendant. Was not worth the amount paid for.
2.0,I actually used this to pierce my wife’s ear with. Looks great but some of the green from the leaf is starting to fade already and it hasn’t even been a week yet.
2.0,The bracelet is pretty but one of the stones came out after just one wear.
2.0,Love it but it constantly tangles
2.0,I purchased a pair for myself and my husband. Neither of us were impressed with them. They don't seem to cut the glare at night the way they purport to.
2.0,"These leggings are extremely thin, almost see through. Order a size larger than what you normally wear. Super tight and seams look like they are coming apart."
2.0,I have other hangers from other brands and these hangers just fit weird. I don't think the sides are deep enough and they constantly fall out of my ears
2.0,It looks beautiful in the picture but in reality it’s very poor quality! The nose ring is also very small and more difficult to put in...
2.0,"The material is good quality but the torso is extremely long. I have to get it altered before wearing, as such I was not able to wear it to the event."
2.0,Poor quality zipper.
2.0,This shirt was awesome....until it was washed and then it was too small.  Yes it was washed in cold and low dry.  Just sad because I really wanted this shirt.
2.0,I’ll never wear these because they fall open. The details of them aren’t real clear either. Disappointed.
2.0,the shirt neck began saggy and stretched after 1 wash.. .. had to cut up and use as rags.. the shirt is very soft tho.
2.0,These run very small. Order a size larger.
2.0,"We are returning this dress. The zipper would not go up past the mid point despite the dress being a little to large for my daughter. Also, we thought that it looked modest enough for a 15 year old to wear to a formal, but it was to low in the front and she was very uncomfortable with it."
2.0,"Gave them away as a gift, they looked pretty, but not wearable."
2.0,"it just didnt look good, not sure if it was the fabric/cut or both. Fyi, I have a 38d chest"
2.0,"Not HORRIBLE but not what I expected. The whole thing is see-through. The front has no hold or extra padding and I fall out as soon as I lean down. Bought a small, I’m 5’8” and 120 with a 34B bra size. It’s not tight enough to keep me in it. But other than that it’s alright."
2.0,Good product. Should be about 1.5 times longer than they are. Too short for my 14 EE sneakers.
2.0,This top fits very tight and the material is more of an off white/beige which is deceiving to the picture.
2.0,"It is pretty, but when it came it was already broken. Not expensive, but kinda annoying to have to fix it before using it."
2.0,Looks good and feels good. Belt split in a few months of use.
2.0,I got xxl it is more like a medium
2.0,I couldn't get this thing up past one thigh. I went by the measurements and still ordered a size up from the suggested size.I'm highly disappointed because I ordered it for my birthday.
2.0,"I bought this for my son, but the fit is extremely small. He normally wears a men's medium or large, but I decided to get him an xlarge. It fit like a boys xlarge."
2.0,If it says Daddy's Girl.. You certainly can't see it.
2.0,"These were amazing to look at and our daughter loved them. Her necklace has stayed together fine, but we hardly let her wear it. But her dad's and my loops broke. I was able to replace mine with a stronger one, but her dad was on deployment when her lost his. The pieces are lovely and very sweet, but suggest once they get delivered to change the loops for security."
2.0,"Not as cute as the picture. The sleeve stick out to a point for some reason. I kept it, it's just okay."
2.0,A stone already fell out
2.0,I received the wrong color and couldn't order it again to replace.  I did return this top. It would have been really cute if it looked like the picture.
2.0,I like these gloves - they are replacing a very old pair of suede gloves that were too big and over time the lining wore out so they weren't really warm.<br /><br />These new Skydeers are warm and the Medium fits me well so the cold air doesn't get in like with my old gloves.<br /><br />However I have noticed that the black lining in these tends to rub off on my hands.  This was especially the case on days when I have put moisturizing cream on my hands (which I tend to do in winter since it is so dry).  After wearing the gloves there is a darkish tint on my skin.  It does wash off and the soapy water is tinted black.<br /><br />Skydeer manufacturer - question - is there a way to wash these gloves to maybe get the extra black ink out of the inner lining so it will stop rubbing off on me?  I assumed that I am not supposed to wash deerskin gloves as it will ruin them.
2.0,"Buckle discolored, leather layers came apart!"
2.0,Pills very bad!!!! Never had this problem before with russel sweats!!!! Will not buy russel sweats again I guess it will be jerzies! They use to not pill I hope that they still don't .i would not recommend!!!
2.0,"This sweater does NOT have a v neck, it is a regulare scoop neck.  Also, it is a very, very THIN sweater (you'll need to wear a tank under) which doesn't come across in the picture."
2.0,Not fit at all
2.0,"I like this dress but the arm holes were a little to large for me, showing part of my bra.  The fabric and fit of the dress are nice, but returning because of this."
2.0,Would have been a wonderful Bra but the top of the Bra between the cleavage and straight across the front flipsove and sticks out under your clothes. Doesn't look cute seeing those lumps under your clothing
2.0,"I wear an XL and thats what I ordered, it fits like a small.  Order bigger.  biggest size was an XL"
2.0,It's really cute but broke after 30 minutes of wearing it.
2.0,It was pretty but oversized returned product.
2.0,"They’re pretty, but if I wanted gauges in my ears I’d have gone that route.  Beware these hurt."
2.0,fit was not good.
2.0,The material is something my grandmother would wear.  Pretty style but they ruined it with very cheap looking material.  I will not wear it.  I can't return it since the shipping is more expensive than the shirt was.  Save your money!
2.0,"The picture is misleading. It looked like my old ones, but came way too big."
2.0,Pretty short. And randomly says &#34;cheers&#34; instead of cheer. Odd.
2.0,"Ordered these on behalf of my mom, she ended up returning them because they were too small."
2.0,"After only wearing a handful of times, they got a huge hole in them that could not be sewn back up. It's a shame because they were really comfy."
2.0,Material is such poor quality . . . you can see straight through the dress.  Don't waste your money.
2.0,Names are too small
2.0,"This item is not of sweatshirt weight. The material would be good for a polo shirt. However, the construction quality is good."
2.0,"I ordered Danbiuabi Fashion Women Rhinestone Imitation Pearls Brooches ""12 Mixed"".  I received 12 pieces of all the same design.  They are pretty and I like the size, but not what I wanted or ordered.  FYI in case you order this item, you might not get exactly what you ordered.  Now I'm in a time crunch and will probably have to work with what I got.  Disappointed!"
2.0,"The earing broke in my first usage. A really poor material, do not recommend buying it."
2.0,This fits took sizes gooooo small
2.0,I’m only 5’1” and the full bib apron is just to long. The torso is massive and with the material it’s made of it’s not able to fold over. I love the concept and the 1/2 apron is perfect but if your short it’s something that will need alterations.
2.0,"The photo in the ad shows a really nice pattern that reminds me of the designs of one of my favorite artists. When I received the blouse, the pattern is mostly a muddy looking pink and the printed designs are much larger looking than the depicted in the ad. It makes the top look like a ""church"" blouse for a little old lady. I will be returning it even though I really wanted this top. I know every pattern can't be exactly like the picture but the pink prominence kinda ruined it for me."
2.0,"This shirt was very baggy. If you are wanting a dressier look and less of a sweatshirt look, definitely size down. The sleeves are sort of a shiny material and I didn't think the colors looked as nice as the picture."
2.0,Functionally it is ok but the gloves are all inside out. And out side has scribbling. Feel not good.
2.0,Fits true to size but it’s extremely itchy.
2.0,"The shorts description said long waisted, stretch, long biker shorts .<br />My true size is a medium or large<br />But i ordered a bigger size XL because of all the reviews.  The shorts didn't fit and are not long enough as description."
2.0,Way too small And they shrank. I will not buy them again. great for ladies with there tiny feet.
2.0,"I tried these pants based on the attractive price and good look. I wear a size 33 waist jeans and ordered a size 32 that were a little snug in the waist. The length was fine while standing but once I sat on my bike the bottom of the pants came up to the middle of my shin. I wound up returning them. The construction seemed very sturdy though out of the box. I would have exchanged them for a 34 but was afraid they would be the same length. Despite them not fitting, I was happy with the delivery time and quick credit I received."
2.0,"Vibrant colors, good quality, comfortable size, soft and cool fabric. size L"
2.0,"I got broken, I returned it"
2.0,Very cute and I love the way it looks. But I’ve been wearing less than a week and already 3 of the blue dangling gems have fallen off.
2.0,"They're cute. However, they're pretty hard to distinguish that they're squirrels."
2.0,"By the way this was the ""short sleeve"" version I ordered NOT the long sleeve .<br />I did receive the short sleeve but its too tight for the size quoted & I am returning it."
2.0,Very hard to figure out how how to assemble without decent directions.  I have tried to use the stretcher but getting it in pants is very difficult.  I desperately need to stretch pants one or two inches bud I don’t think it is worth the trouble.
2.0,First day 2 of them broke...poor quality..not made well and very small and thin.
2.0,"I loved the color and style the material is clingy, form fitting but it shows something entirely different in photos. I have requested a refund I was going to get a bigger size but I see there all out of the one I had. Beware if you have to return it don't believe the email they send you it's going to take some days not hours to get your refund."
2.0,"I received the dress in extra small yellow. While the size is okay, the material is very sheer. This will require undergarments so as not to show the world all your secrets!"
2.0,Bought 4 of these for the family and unfortunately my son's broke the next day.  Tried to return/replace and Amazon claims it is not eligible.  Durability should be better or policy needs to change so item can be replaced.
2.0,M is too small for 5'6 170lbs. Sending back.
2.0,The elastic band lasted about a week where it started to fray and finally gave up the ghost.  Had to re-string the beads with something a little more substantial.
2.0,It was great for the 1st 3 days then it would never charge again.  We had a heart broken little girl
2.0,Material is VERY clingy and lots of static
2.0,We bought an XL and it came very small almost like a medium size wayyyy up
2.0,"Not a fan, sent the first one back because it was too tight in the bosom and the waist was too high. The second one isn't as tight, but the waist is still way too high, the pockets are practically in my armpit. I buy a lot of dresses from Amazon, but I will not buy anymore from this seller."
2.0,"I know it's a knock off...Might work if the V in the neck wasn't cut to nearly the middle of the chest. This is a very light weight basic long sleeve T-Shirt with a hood. The arm cuffs, neck line and bottom of the shirt are not finished. Very cheap! Would not order again. I wish I could return this item. Too bad I have a 2nd style already on the way. I'm 5'3&#34; & 125lbs. Let's say XL is not baggy!"
2.0,"Well, I have an awkward body so I’ll explain first- I have zero boobs, like less than an A, but I’m a normal size 5’4” woman who wears a size 8. I have an athletic muscular build with somewhat broader shoulders. Best way to describe me is a letter I. So, this doesn’t really work. It kinda fits on my boobs, is way too big on my waste and fits on my hips. If you’re curvy with more of an hour glass, this will work for you. If you don’t have much shape, don’t bother"
2.0,"The package on these underwear was clearly labeled Medium, but unfortunately the underwear inside were all size Large.  My dad wears that size so my mom bought them from me.  I think the underwear looks okay.  Nothing fancy or spectacular about them and probably 5 or 6 dollars too expensive for what your getting..."
2.0,Soft material but is a tighter fit than description. Was looking for a lounge shirt for leggings. Even sized up as reviews said.
2.0,"Wasn't even close to right size , waist is way off."
2.0,Too loose. Had to have them taken in.
2.0,"Doesn't look at all like the model, this item is as big at the bottom as it is at the top.  I have a small waist compared to hips so it didn't look right on me.  Also, the color is not as shown, I was wanting a cool summer white (as shown) and received something more towards yellow.  Returned"
2.0,looks better in the picture.  It is not slim fit.
2.0,I bought one bag of these previously and they were fine. Tested all of them with a light tug since these are going out in gift bags. This larger order so far has a lot of bad ones. They opened very easily and some have brown stuff inside them. Unfortunately I missed the return window with these due to a death in the family. I definitely will not consider these again.
2.0,HORRIBLY WRINKLED therefore not really nice.
2.0,Cute but cheap. Broke second time I wore it.
2.0,Not as pretty as thought for Michael Kors.
2.0,"The shirt looked fine, just as pictured.  Unfortunately, the X-Large fits like a regular Large."
2.0,"Unless you plan to wear a slip, I'd avoid this dress. The fabric is SO thin. You can see right through it. Almost like an ancient thread-bare dress from my Grandma's closet. I'll never wear it, even if the design is cute, albeit matronly. Overall, it didn't work for me."
2.0,"I wouldn't wear these out of the house.  So thin even though the cut on the leg is right.<br /> Medium is a bit big around the middle.  Just super cheap, sloppy feeling lounge pants is how I would describe them.  And they look maternity."
2.0,This product is not true to size as stated. Its about 2 sizes smaller then actual size
2.0,Use few days it crack
2.0,Very small not a good fit on model looks loose fit and said that but it's not did not like at all sent back
2.0,"These are great fitting and feeling, which makes the fact that they are unbearably warm all the worse.  Maybe if I wanted to wear socks with them it would be better, but this fake wool is super hot and my feet are sweaty within 15 minutes.  Might be good for outdoor slippers in the arctic?"
2.0,Zippper is  too short to put bills in. I seen this on Wish<br />com?
2.0,The handle and the straps are really weird. Don’t recommend buying this. The form doesn’t really hold. And it smells bad.
2.0,"Really cute but sent them back. I wear a 7 in all my boots so that is what I ordered. These were painfully tight and hard. The material didn't look like it would hold up at all either, even for gentle use. Wouldn't recommend."
2.0,"Much too small, even though i ordered two sizes up.  I couldn't even get the dress all the way on, not to mention zipped up!  The fabric wasn't what I had been expecting according to the description. I was thinking I would be getting something that had some stretch to it, but there was no give at all.  There were some strings hanging that would've needed to be cut.  I'm returning the dress.<br /><br />It's also noteworthy that at least on my computer screen, the colors are not at all as pictured.  The flowers are more red than pink and the background is a light pink rather than the ivory I had expected.  Not that the fabric isn't pretty, it is, but it wasn't what I had expected at all."
2.0,"I wanted the loose look like in the photos so based on other reviews I ordered a size up.  I'm 5'5"", 153 lbs and 36H, I ordered an XL but received a large instead, so while it fits it only provides just enough room to fit, nothing extra.  The fabric was also incredibly itchy, even after washing it with fabric softener.  Overall, just not what I wanted from this dress, I plan to return it."
2.0,"The color and material and build quality are all top notch.  This is a very comfortable shirt to wear.  However it claims ""pre-washed"" or ""pre-shrunk"" and yet still after one wash (on cold cycle) all of the shirts from this order shrunk up to become waist level.  So the bottom of the shirt now sits at the waistline, and if I raise my arm, my belly would be exposed immediately.  So much for this crap, I guess I'm back to Duke, at least they don't shrink that bad."
2.0,"This is the third dress I have returned.  I am not oddly shaped.  I am 5'3"" and weigh 138 lbs.  I usually order a medium, but all of these dresses are way too long.  I order a midi instead of a maxi."
2.0,Arrived covered in powdery substances.  Did not anticipate having to clean a pair of boots that I bought brand-new.  And I am not the first to complain of this same issue .
2.0,"Bought the Mirrored previously.  Was concerned about reordering, as the pictures didn't look the same.  Not sure if they changed something, but when the new set arrived, they definitely weren't the same as the ones I previously purchased.  The lenses are definitely not mirrored,  They aren't clear, but, at best, polarized.  But, they are definitely not mirrored, nor are they same as the ones I had previously purchased.  Definitely disappointed, as I could use some extra pairs and these were the first that I found that fit my almost size 8 head and have removable padding, as well as sit far enough from my eyes that my lashes don't rub against the lens at every blink.  Really bummed that my search for a new pair of riding glasses begins again!"
2.0,"Beautiful ring but it didn't arrive in a box, it came wrapped in a ziplock bag and it had been crushed a little. Luckily my wife work with jewelry and straightened the ring back on a mandrel she has."
2.0,"Meh... Very thin, great colors (that's why the second star) but one pair came with a hole in the heel."
2.0,It doesn't work on my glasses
2.0,Came Fairly Fast!! Poor Quality chain made of Plastic nda Too Short!! The Cross iz da Beautiful but too Heavy fer Chain!!! Change chain nda itz All Go Den nda All!!
2.0,"i was excited to get these glasses because i love all of the colors.<br /><br />they are light weight and probably not very sturdy, but i was fine with that because i often lose or break my glasses. i was pleased to have many options and wouldn't be too bummed if i lose or broke a pair.<br /><br />but! they aren't even! they fit crooked on my face (I tried a few pairs and had another person try them too). so alas, i am returning them."
2.0,"These may fit your cat, a large ferret your neighbour my own, or a small child but they certainly wont fit you.  Be warned.  Warrrnneeddd."
2.0,Material was see though and rough
2.0,"It looks so cute on the model, I am 5’3” 130lb big butt small boobs athletic build and usually wear a S or XS. If you want to look bigger than you are then buy this dress! The top is so cute and fits great but the skirt portion is just awful. I was super bummed, Amazon clothing is so hit or miss..."
2.0,The shoes are ok . I bought to give as a gift . They came in bubble wrap and no box .
2.0,Not flattering at all on me. I’m 5-4 and 180lbs. It was short on me.
2.0,I expected the material to be less... pajama like!
2.0,This bag looks nice in the picture and is very sturdy in person but it is way too big and bulky. For the price I was expecting something a little nicer.
2.0,Had to return. It fit oddly in the bust.
2.0,"So cute!  Too short, size up if they have it! Not an option for size 11."
2.0,"These are buttery soft, but run very small. I wear a 2x in all of my leggings but could not get these past by buttocks area."
2.0,"The temples broke after a year of use. If you like to use your hard earned cash on stuff that will break, then this project is for you."
2.0,These earrings are very cheap.  They didn't even survive a day of wear before the strawberries fell off.  Don't waste your money.
2.0,Very cute and nice size but one of the pink stones fell out very disappointed
2.0,"Too small... not true to size. I have worn size 11 Reefs for years. Bought these at size 11--- too small, too tight, and very narrow. I took a chance by ordering online and failed, oh well. I personally do not like these sandals, but someone else might."
2.0,Fingers turned green after an hour of wearing there cute and all and was a little to tight and I have fairly small fingers
2.0,"material felt good, but this was far too small for me. 6'1"" 250 lbs,  largest size didn't even barely fit. And I was sent the wrong color, got what looked like burgundy wine, very far from ""dusty pink"" I'd say. For $5 its definitely worth it if it fits you :p the sizing chart looked a lot more forgiving at the time"
2.0,"1 stone fell out within half an hour of first wearing. Safety clasp kept coming undone, I think the clasp is fixable, but could not accept the stone falling out, returned item. However, good looking bracelet. Manufacture needs to tighten up on quality control."
2.0,It’s pure cotton and has ZERO stretch. I know they’re yoga pants but they are more like leggings. Returned.
2.0,"It's okay, pretty ordinary."
2.0,I absolutely loved this shirt! It's super comfortable and has a great weight and fits really well. I am so sad that the printing on it is coming off after having it less than 2 months.
2.0,"Material is tick polyester, not suitable for warm weather"
2.0,made my ears really sore
2.0,Great item but fits short. Must be for people who are more short waisted.
2.0,"The model who wears this pants must be a kid or a short person. I'm 5'8 and the pants is about 5 inch under my knee. I won't return this item, but I won't purchase another one."
2.0,I’m a medium in men’s shirts so that’s what I ordered. It runs very small and fits like a SM women’s fit. The graphic is okay but one of Eiji’s eyes looks a little wonky.
2.0,"this product suffered a broken handle on the very first trip I took it on.  The largest unit tipped over and the plastic on the handle broke and the entire mechanism came out of the handle.  Unfortunately, I'm stuck with this as I am on an extended trip away from home."
2.0,It doesn't look as high quality as you think.
2.0,"The material feels good and seems to be fairly breathable but anyone more than 4&#34; in length or girth may find these too small, even in the XL. It is nice that the pocket in front holds the twig off the berries. Just wish they made larger sizes."
2.0,Cheaply made and WAY too small compared to sizing
2.0,"This item was flipping HUGE!!! I bought 2 sizes to make sure I was covered. The small was actually BIGGER than the medium! Horrible. I know it says it’s a loose fit, but it was HUGE. And long. I was very disappointed"
2.0,"Too small as expected ,"
2.0,Nice fabric and style but it is too small. I couldn’t return it as I sent it as a gift overseas.
2.0,Too small!!!!!
2.0,Quickly turned my finger green
2.0,"I love this bra. So much. But I’ve only had it since Jan 16th and the inner supportive strap is already falling apart :( One side completely frayed off. I wash as instructed, am not harsh on my clothing, I’m so bummed... with all the good reviews I though let this would last much longer."
2.0,The glasses are too big for the case. Glasses were ok. Case not ok. Hopefully it was just my purchase
2.0,I sent it back.  I probably would have loved it if it was the proper size.
2.0,"The cut and material were nice, HOWEVER… they fit, like, a 12 year old girl. So they were worthless to me. I gave them to a happy 10 year old girl."
2.0,"Cheap material, poor fit.  Pattern much more pronounced than pictured. Not worth the money."
2.0,"The material is very delicate, paper thin. Won’t be able to put vinyls on it for my son for wrestling."
2.0,"ordered two dresses on this order, both the same exact size, two different brands, ordered size I normally wear/order....this dress was beyond tight.  There is absolutely no way the sizing was accurate."
2.0,It’s so adorable but I’m 5’3 and it was way to short! My husband wouldn’t let me wear it out cause cheeks were hanging out
2.0,"This dress is adorable, but the unicorn decoration is glued on and peeled off pretty quickly when worn. I feel it was pretty cheaply made and didn’t hold up well."
2.0,"Ok , not pretty but not bad"
2.0,"Because of the way the charms are put on the necklace, they constantly flip backwards. Would not buy again"
2.0,We haven't even had the shoes a month and now they won't charge. Not happy.  He wanted to wear them for the 4th and now they wont even light up.
2.0,The design is awesome but the “gold” comes right off. Not even worth the price tbh. It’s slowly starting to look dark and it doesn’t look good on the teeth.
2.0,"Not happy with the quality. Feathers easily falling off when taken from the package. Color is as seen in picture and packaging seemed okay, however."
2.0,"The dress is super thin, I have to buy a slip for under it. The neck comes up way higher than pictured, so I have to get that hemmed. I guess you get what you pay for, so I'm not super disappointed in it. I just wish it wasn't as thin. The length is great, and it's very pretty. I bought an XL, which I thought would be a little loose, it's pretty fitting. All and all I regret this purchase."
2.0,"I ordered the Artic Chrome polarized version of these sunglasses,( obviously didn’t receive what I ordered) and noticed that the quality of the glasses are that of gas station sunglasses. it comes in a cheap cardboard Box that was busted when I got it. The lenses and frame overall feel low and fragile."
2.0,"Everything was comfy, just had a rip in it sadly but don’t want to not return it!"
2.0,Decorations started to peal off the first  day. . .
2.0,I bought this shirt for my wedding weekend in the mountaons. The shirt is great but the letters on shirt are already peeling and shirt can def not be washed or all letter will come off...
2.0,Falsely advertised as black because the liner came in white.  It's not bad but I don't appreciate being shown one dress and being shipped another.
2.0,My son loved this but the anchor broke within 2 weeks.  Not durable.
2.0,Don't get me wrong this a very nice case but its not what i expected when i got it. Its not a hard case and it wont fit any glasses that have square frames. When i received the case it had frayed ends. If you have circle lenses and they are not over sized then yes they will fit perfectly but other than that its a great case for the price that it is.
2.0,Using the size chart as a guide was not helpful at all its still a size small despite their measurements.<br />The material is good quality however for the price
2.0,"I was super disappointed when this shirt same in. the stitching in the shoulders were all tattered, and the material feels like a swimsuit. overall it is not terrible, just poorly made."
2.0,The black part is super stretchy and amazing but the nude part has virtually no stretch. I was buying these because of my thick thighs always causing thigh highs to roll down. Thought it would be a cool idea for a bigger girl to be able to enjoy the cute look of thigh highs without the hassle. But I was wrong. They won’t even stretch over my thighs.
2.0,Sleeves are super small.  Rest of shirt fits big
2.0,"I have not given this hat to the veteran yet and I'm not anxious to do so. I bought my Dad a WWII hat made by the same company  and they both get two stars for feeling like quality made/material/embroidery, but the hat itself is wa-a-y-y too large. If adjusted to fit with the back velcro adjustment, the embroidered logo on the top of the adjustment looks funny as it hangs loose on one side. While not a big man, his head is in a normal range and a ton of other caps fit fine. It also has such a high crown, it looks too old even for my 96-year old Dad. He could shoplift a small cantaloupe in it, lol. I have a feeling I will be sending this one back after I give it with apologies. Both hats were bought as replacements for the worn out hats they had. Wish I knew who had made them. Dad hasn't said anything,  but continues to wear his old faded one. In fact, I would take a comparison picture, but the new hat has conveniently disappeared."
2.0,"RETURNED TWICE. INCREASED SIZE BY 1/2 EACH TIME AND STILL TOO SMALL.<br />ALSO, SEEMED VERY HEAVY."
2.0,"I thought this was going to be the best watch band I've ever purchased, and I've got a lot. The band it top notch in quality. It would make almost any watch that much better, but there is NO way to go to a half-size. Most bands have a way to move a pin and drop down a 1/2 size (or less). There seems to be a way to move a pin, which I did. But by making it smaller the latch no longer folds over correctly. I thought, ""well if I moved the pin on one end, maybe there is a place to move the pin on the other side of the clasp and, there is!  BUT, the band fits very snugly against the clasp and there is no way to get any tool whatsoever between the band and the clasp. I can't possibly send this back in good conscience as I've removed and added links, and certainly left it obviously used.  So I wasted about $50.<br /><br />So if you're lucky it will fit you perfectly.  I'll add that this is the first watch band, of many, that I would have needed to downsize 1/2 a link. All others I was lucky enough that I didn't have to do that."
2.0,"The cutouts on the arms are very awkward and make my arms appear larger, I’m not sure why. Also, the fit of the shirt does not cling to the shape of your body at all, it hangs oddly on my body making me appear to have no shape :( . However, the fabric is amazing and light. It’s very breathable."
2.0,They aren’t that cute in person and they look so cheap and quality is not as good as it claims
2.0,"I like the bracelet a lot, but the band feels more plastic than actual leather. I was a bit disappointed with that but I still like it a lot."
2.0,"Definitely doesn't fit like the picture. Women with smaller, perkier breasts could probably pull it off, but to me the pattern was also off and didn't cover what it should have. It wasn't as pretty as the picture either"
2.0,"We really like the 2 masks we that fit us, but the other 2 masks are clearly larger and fit very poorly. I’m not sure if there’s just poor quality control in their manufacturing, or whether we accidentally got 2 normal and 2 large masks."
2.0,"The top does not compress. If you’re looking for a compression tank, this isn’t it."
2.0,"This bag is large and can fit a lot of things. If you cannot fill this bag to capacity, you are left with a structural problem. The bag will lie flat on the ground making you search for the zippers. If you use the shoulder strap, the bag will fold over vertically,  destroying the organization you had when you packed the bag. There are few organizing pockets and zero compartments.<br />This bag is great for checking on a long trip."
2.0,"Ordered the WHITE shirt for husband.  The collar is a different color white than the body.  Giving the SNOW WHITE color a try and hoping the collar matches the rest of the shirt.  Ordered the XL which fit him (he typically wears a L) since we were looking for longer sleeve length. Other than the color difference, looks like a nice shirt.<br /><br />Just received the SNOW WHITE shirt (very quickly).  The WHITE and SNOW WHITE appear to be the exact same color!  The collar and cuffs of new shirt do NOT match the body also.  Both shirts returned, sadly."
2.0,Not very sturdy or durable
2.0,Returned merchandise!
2.0,"These shoes are as comfortable as crocs always are.  No issues with fit or breaking in or any of that nonsense.  However, the appeal of crocs has always been the ability to wash them when they get dirty.  I have done that with prior pairs of these that I've owned and never had an issue.  This pair got dirty, so I threw them in the washer.  One was perfectly fine, as expected.  The other - not so much.  The strap turned dark brown, curled in on itself and got hard like plastic.  Very odd and unexpected for the two shoes to have such different reactions to the washer.  Of course, I've owned them more than 30 days and so I'm stuck looking like I'm wearing two different shoes..."
2.0,"The top of this suit was odd. The bra area was not right at all, the bottom elastic band of the bra section didn't want to come down below my breasts. Imagine wearing a sports bra but the bottom doesn't sit below your breast but rather comes down to your nipples and so your boob wants to hang out the bottom of it. It's not like my boobs are huge (36C) so they should fit into the designated bra area I would think. The skirt fit great and was cute but the top not fitting right was annoying enough that I returned it."
2.0,The only thing that saved this from getting 1 star is the fabric.  The fit was baggy and the neck... too loose didn't fit snug for a nice appearance.  Maybe for someone with a huge neck but no. Oh the color matched though.
2.0,Suppose to be men's sunglasses and they are little kids wtf
2.0,Fell apart 5 days after purchasing
2.0,"While most of these are adorable and I love them, I would like to know why Gary looks like this?"
2.0,"I ordered this top in extra white.  When it arrived I noticed it's not white, but actually a cream color.  The stripes on the top are white, but the body of the shirt is cream.  I returned it because it just doesn't look right."
2.0,"Colores part comes off on rings have only had like a month,  low quality too bad they LOOK good"
2.0,This blouse runs extremely small.  Wasted my money
2.0,"I wasn't a fan of these. I was hoping I could wear them and get away with looking like I was wearing grey pants instead of something as comfortable as pajamas, but they don't look all that great. They are also not very flattering on size-14-me."
2.0,"I order two sizes up, and they were still too small.I usually wear an xl, but it says to order up, so I ordered a 3xl. They were too tight to even pull up all the way.<br /><br />Fabric is soft, but I'm guessing the sizes are chinese sizes. So order up by 5 or 6 sizes from what you usually wear."
2.0,"Color is good, but material looks cheap."
2.0,These things look great but don’t hold up at all. I would say these are a super visors glove for sure they look but I don’t think there made for real work. These gloves are best suited for pointing a finger in cold weather.
2.0,Initially it was very nice and tight. I used it once every 3 days (rotates my 3 swimming suits). And it lost elasticity after 3 months. The other two are still in good shape. Hope manufacturer will improve the quality of fabric.
2.0,Fit and style not like picture
2.0,"Almost as soon as I put these on, they began to feel damp and sticky.<br />I think I'll stick with 100% cotton from now on. ( no pun intended )"
2.0,"This bracelet looks like picture and the metal charms are made well, but one of the straps came apart almost instantly upon putting it on. My daughter decided to take it apart and repurpose the charms. You get what you pay for."
2.0,Too shiny. Looks fake and cheap.
2.0,Unfortunately they were too small for my face. I was so heartbroken. My daughter was able to use them.
2.0,Weirdly made very big even for a DD.
2.0,It’s pretty but doesn’t lie properly-looks twisted on neck
2.0,The tag came with a rhinestone missing. The font was very small and not formatted well. It could have been centered and larger. I disliked it so much that I just threw it out and bought a nicer one at Petco.
2.0,The style of the jeans are cute but they are super longer than I expected.
2.0,Runs very small. Size large is equivalent to size 6.
2.0,Nice suit but I bought a 3xl and it's too small. I'm 5'4 and 220. Def foreign sizes. The bottoms fit. The top is about 2 sizes too small. I usually wear a XL or 14-16.
2.0,"This will be sent back.  Not worth the price, even on sale."
2.0,"Higher prices than usual, its not so quality as well"
2.0,Not worth returning so gave to my oldest granddaughter. I weigh a lot less then she does due to having cancer but this just didn't fit right through the shoulders. On her it looked cute. I'd bought a xxl thinking surely it would fit when my cloths are a small? No wonder it's so cheap!
2.0,"They are very cute, as pictured, and the sizing is as expected. I would give them five stars if not for the smell. The second my daughter opened the package I nearly threw up. They smell like nasty sweaty socks and a corn nut factory we’re weaponized! We’ve washed them three times and soaked them overnight in detergent and vinegar and the smell has only slightly diminished. I’ve never experienced such a horrible, persistent stench before."
2.0,Loved these earrings so much but they broke within the first week or two. But honestly would buy again to replace the broken pair
2.0,"This is a neat shirt combo. I ordered the small. I am a small female, but usually those will fit me. This thing was HUGE! It was like an XL shirt for men. Way too big. Need better sizing info."
2.0,These socks were impossible to put on. I have bought two other brands of compression socks in the same size and had no problem with putting them on.
2.0,My grandson was initially very pleased with this necklace but dropped on the floor the day after he received it and the pendant broke apart.
2.0,Seems to run small.
2.0,"This is my second order of the 3 pack.  I liked them so much the first time, I ordered more because I need a pair at every possible location in my life.  The first set I still have, they are fine.  This second set have all broken in the same place on the frame part that holds the lens.  I thought maybe I was bending them too far out because they are flexible, but the last pair broke while on my face.  I had been reading with them and out of the blue I heard and felt a ""pop"" and removed the glasses and the lens fell out.  That was the 3rd out of the same 3 pack.  So, I don't recommend them unless the price is low enough you don't care that you can only wear them for a month or so before they break."
2.0,They look great and the material feels nice.  But for some reason they keep sliding off. Especially off my butt. If I bend down they slide down so much. I can't squat either.
2.0,Cool looking mask but the fabric is right against your mouth and muffles your words when you talk
2.0,Wore the shirt once and it was great but after one wash it shrunk real bad and I couldn’t wear it.
2.0,Bracelet way too large.  Did not like.
2.0,Robe felt very cheap.  Left lots of lint.  Will be returning it.  Don't recommend buying it.
2.0,The shirt is not cut or styled any where near as pictured. I wanted something to show off my chest --the shirt I received covered my chest completely! It's more like a sleeveless T-shirt.
2.0,The necklaces were a little scratched and look a bit old.
2.0,"Too tall and thin.  Have to take things out to get at other things. Cute, but not practical. Fox keeps flipping around to other not so cute side."
2.0,"i didn't realize this is a &#34;robe&#34; style dress. You have to put the ties through a hole, and it didn't make for a fun night when my dress kept blowing up or showing way too much leg. The material also wasn't what was expected."
2.0,"Love the fit, however they are see-through so I cant wear them in public."
2.0,"If you have a little head then these might fit, too small for me. You get what you pay for."
2.0,"The reason I am giving this 2 stars is because the pink bra bled and ruined a load of laundry. I tried soaking it, but the pink continued to bleed. Love the black and grey bra but won't buy a 3 pack again."
2.0,Image is deceiving!!!!  I thought I was getting THREE lights.  Only received ONE!!!  Not worth $20.00!!!
2.0,I really wanted to love this hoodie and really wish I read the description. The material is spandex/polyester.  Very lightweight. Might keep just for around the house.
2.0,retuned product! All chains were broke upon arrival
2.0,"Cute, but way smaller than I expected."
2.0,It was not what i expected not made like it looks
2.0,"Got this as a father's day gift and it is to small. It looks good but didn't fit even when we measured, trying to make sure it would fit."
2.0,These pants run true to size and are on the tighter side around the hips.<br />I was expecting these pants to sit above my ankle but instead they came all the way down to my feet.<br />I got a size smaller than normal and I think my regular size would fit me perfectly.<br />These pants don’t have much stretch to them. The actual material is pretty 95% polyester and 5% spandex but it feels like a much lower % of spandex.<br />The pants seem well made and has belt loops.<br />I like that the back of the pants is elastic where the front of the pants have a nice smooth look which makes it easy to do a front tuck and not look like you are wearing sweat pants!<br />The legs are slightly tapered in at the ankle.<br />There are two pockets in the front and then two fake pockets in the back.<br />These pants are squat proof.
2.0,My wife said it is a little small and uncomfortable.
2.0,Like the style of the top. Material is fairly good too. But the fitting is off and doesn't hold up after washing.
2.0,had to resew the velcro on the belt; it pulled off first time I tried it on.  Also had to add velcro on the tunic and the wraps in order to put costume on by myself so it would stay tight.
2.0,Turned my father and husbands wrist green
2.0,Perfect size and loved the hat. But it came unglued. I will need to buy glue gun and glue and put it back together. The Flower was undone
2.0,There are threads that were as long as the scarf unraveling. ☹
2.0,"Way too tight at cheat. Thin kind of parachute material, cute but didn’t work for me"
2.0,"These glasses have the weakest tint I've ever seen. On top of that, after a year of gentle use, the glue holding one of the arms on failed, making them useless. Not worth the money."
2.0,"It came with frayed handles, the stitching isn't very secure. Def expected better for the price."
2.0,this broke within a week after we bought it.
2.0,Does not fit tight and the waist band doesn't have enough elastic.
2.0,The shirt is beautiful it’s just too bad I got one with lipstick and makeup all over the inside of the shirt. The seller did not clean the shirt they just resold it… smh.
2.0,Like the color and design.Do  not like the way it loses its shape. Not comfortable on shoulder.
2.0,I have this kind of belt for many years. These are the first belts that have a sharp edge and a burr on the metal. Other than that they are fine.
2.0,They are the only pair of glasses that work for me with computer and looking down at papers on my desk without feeling like I need to refocus.  These glasses are also very comfortable.  After a few weeks they broke just like the first pair
2.0,Not too crazy about the blue part in my stone does not look like other part of he stone. But for the price I can’t complain.
2.0,"This is a cute idea just fits very large, and is not that well made!!"
2.0,Kinda big they slip down a lot and are shorter than I expected I’m only 5’5” and they don’t touch the ground..
2.0,This 3 hook extension is two wide for most of my 3 hook bras. I will keep them in case I get a bra with a really wide back strap.
2.0,"I really liked the fabric, which seemed like a nice quality, but the fit was just strange! I got a size Small, and I have a 34&#34; chest and it seemed like it was too tight on the chest, but much too large in the arms. It fit kind of like a peplum top. It might work for a pear shaped body, with bigger arms, but not for me."
2.0,"The waist on this did not hit at a very flattering spot. It ended up being an empire waist fit instead of hitting at my true waist. I had sized up to hopefully mitigate this. While the dress was cut wider, the length was not adjusted accordingly. I am 5'9"" and this hit well above my knee. I sent this one back."
2.0,The top is too large and I will be returning it.
2.0,This rash guard is thick material and seems to be good quality. The placement of the pocket is not ideal. I am 5’7” and the pocket falls right below my chest. When you move the rash guard rides up and it looks like this extra fabric is coming out of the front of my chest. It is weird looking. Maybe if I got a bigger shirt it would have fallen lower on my torso but I did get the size that I normally wear. I do like the zipper on it and it will help from getting sunburn.
2.0,This outfits inseam was shorter than expected
2.0,"Material looks cheaper than the picture displays and the dress does not have the fluidity of the picture. Based on the chart I ordered my size and it fits tighter than it should. Instead of it being a nice work to dinner dress, it’s more of a thin weight summer dress; I’ll have to wear certain undergarments to cover the chest area. I think this was a replacement for the pictured dress!!"
2.0,Broke the day after I got it. Still very pretty though.
2.0,Really nice shoes but not true to size. Order size up
2.0,It says it is triangle . It is not. And it has sharp prongs that get stuck on everything. love purple would have been a great piece very sturdy prong
2.0,Not the best...
2.0,Ordered small and still didn't fit properly
2.0,"These socks are SUPER thin. I used them for barre and I could see my toenail polish through them. They are not as good as other, thicker grippy socks."
2.0,Size is off fits too snug. I returned it.
2.0,"It was really pretty but the chain was kinked. Once it has been bent, you can't really fix it. We returned ours."
2.0,After you wear the magnetized ones for awhile they hurt and give you a heed ache and the nose rings don't have any flexibility and if you have big lips the lip ring will definitely not fit you even if you don't it will fall off when you talk the septum that are not magnetic look weird because they are to long and it's just all out a rip off but the box was cute
2.0,"Way too ""fitted"". I thought it was rediculously tight with no ease whatsoever. Somewhat thin, which could be a good thing if worn under a sweater or suit jacket. The description does mention the neck is a ""lettuce"" trim. If you understand what to expect, I think that feature is well executed but I imagine most people would consider that unfinished. I sent it back because I didn't like the grey-pink color and the way the neckline buckled."
2.0,"Very weird fit, hard to explain, but definitely not natural looking."
2.0,"It is a nice looking shirt pattern & everything, but one problem I have with it is that it has a very scratchy feeling to the shirt texture.  I would recommend wearing an undershirt if you decide to buy one of these."
2.0,Loved the color. Loved the material. Broke my heart when I tried it on and it was not meant for an average adult size head.
2.0,Should of gotten a large because it's a Lil tight but I think its too late to exchange so I'll wear it once and buy another one but in a bigger size
2.0,"Well, I was expecting this necklace to have a brown recluse spider inside of it....but it was just an orb weaver spider like the ones I find outside of my house. This was extremely disappointing. The necklace looks cool I guess..but it isn't right for people to sell these necklace's and tell everyone that they are real brown recluses when they obviously aren't. If you are looking to get a brown recluse necklace, then don't buy it from them."
2.0,"Cute, but it turns my ankle green over the course of the day."
2.0,"The arms are a good length, but the torso is shorter than it looks in the pictures and the material is so thin you can see through it."
2.0,I expected a better quality product.  The zipper is inferior
2.0,"I bought these as a gift for my teen daughter, but haven't decided if I will keep or return.  Cute little earring but very short post.  I wish designers understood that older girls and women like small studs too."
2.0,Not at all what I was hoping for. Looked like a moo moo on me and the fabric is cheap and thin. I shouldn't have expected anything more.
2.0,Was looking for inexpensive but got cheap instead.
2.0,There was coating layers I had to peak off.<br />Otherwise good to go
2.0,This is a very odd fitting pair of pants. The waist fit as you'd want however the crotch of the pant was way to big making it almost look like you had a full diaper on underneath the pants. Then the legs went back to being snug before the ankles loosed again. The color did come as pictured however. I just wouldn't recommend unless your an extremely curvy woman.
2.0,"if your going to buy a hat, make sure you know exactly what you want, and size, and how it looks on you<br />before you buy a hat online"
2.0,"It's comfortable, but not where the elastic in the back is supposed to keep your backside in. Because it's not snug enough to keep your backside in.<br />And it shrunk a lot in the dryer. Also not really flattering. I purposely got the next size up. I got a size 8. I'm 133 lbs. Disappointed."
2.0,"I love the light, the key ring, the shape of the little, and the box it comes in. However, the color is very deceiving. I got the pink one; in the picture it looks very bright abd shiny, but in reality it is a very soft pink and so matte that it looks like a plastic toy. I even thought it had to ve a protector on top of the paint, but nope. It is the real paint and it makes it look very ugly. I am just grateful I waited to get this one, before getting some others as little gifts."
2.0,"A larger photo wasn't available when I ordered these for my 30-something son...or I would have passed.<br />Granted, ""distressed & holey"" is a current fashion option, but these look more ""staged"" than from wear<br />(and I get it...that is acceptable these days too)<br /><br />The denim is soft<br />These are a medium blue denim shade<br />The fit in the legs is WAY too ""slim"" for my son who is 6' and slender.<br />His legs are not big - they are lean but strong.<br />And these were way too tight and uncomfortable for him - and the fabric does have ""stretch""<br />The Description page recommends wearing these for bike rides and long weekend rides...I can't imagine!<br /><br />However...If you are ""skinny"" through the legs and the styling beckons...go for it!  They are quality crafted.<br />The stitching is strong and tight... the back pocket has a small & subtle GA embroidered and there's the leather label on the back of the waistband  with a GENUINE ASSEMBLY stamped along the bottom which is also subtle."
2.0,"Not at all what I expected, see through fabric, not like picture at all, draping is off"
2.0,Moves around
2.0,The color is completely different from  what is pictured
2.0,Didnt like the way the stone was set.
2.0,Not true to size..fits very small
2.0,"Well, these are a bit scratchy feeling, fabric wise. I'm pretty sure these would chaif, no matter the fit, if you're being active, In them.<br /><br />Oddly, the tag is on the side and not back, this grown a-- woman, had no idea what was front or back. Lol<br /><br />They are a bit tight on me. I wear an xl in all my leggings.. These roll down on my belly and up on my thighs. I don't generally have the roll issue with my normal leggings. This is my first pair this short.. So maybe it's just me.<br /><br />The waistband looks super thick, but really it only has elastic in about half of that space. I think this is the cause of the rolling.<br /><br />I didn't pay much, so I'll keep them, but they really aren't worth it, in my opinion.<br /><br />Plus, the picture in listing was just too good not to give em a try and see if I can get that same! Bum-knee, knee-bum, look.. ;o)"
2.0,It was for my boyfriend's turtle he's worn since he was a teenager. He plays disc golf and works in a warehouse and sweat made this necklace &#34;bleed&#34; black and turned his neck black.
2.0,Fits good except for one of the straps ripped off as I was trying it on.
2.0,Smaller than expected and thinner.
2.0,"Had this for a while now, it has come in handy and love it. But one of the lights now will not keep a charge. I have wore this thing for total of 5 hours all together, now just need to charge, but 1 light will only light up if charging. Which makes this a thumbs down."
2.0,I had my doubts that it would be long enough before I bought it and it definitely was. Super unbecoming on and the flowers were super blurry which I had semi expected. But it was just not good all around not what it looked like online.
2.0,I don't like it because it is very small so you can't put it on your head.<br />it fits on top on your head only so you have to hold it on your head with your hand.
2.0,"I don't know if the skirt is see-through, but the fabric is very thin.  I will be returning the skirt."
2.0,Me gusta está muy bien
2.0,I ordered a 2xl because I'm tall....<br />Jacket still too small pants way to big uneven match
2.0,I liked it!!
2.0,"Looks and feels very cheaply made. My first time trying them on, one of the seams ripped apart with the slightest of pressure. I can not recommend these."
2.0,"Cheap looking, blurry"
2.0,"Love the design, however the material is similar to other items I’ve purchased which pulled and didn’t hold up to a wash. I ordered beige but really got something between super light pink and blush. I tend to wear large but use medium for some items that run big. I ordered a medium and it was big (I’m 5’3” 165 lbs). I’d keep it if it was cheap enough for a disposable garment but it is def not cheap enough. Too bad. A lot of these clothing pieces on Amazon have a nice design but are just not USA quality. I’m giving it 2 stars because I like the design and although the color is not what I ordered, I think it’s pretty."
2.0,loop rings holds frame slides out
2.0,"Felt super - cheap.  Besides the color and having 5 fingers, they looked nothing like the gloves in the photo."
2.0,The material is not as expected.  It is uncomfortable in a hot climate.
2.0,Not worth the $10 it looks better in the pics.
2.0,I so wanted to like this product. I am SO disappointed. I bought the black & brown. Color is nothing like the picture. There is no white in the product. Its a black and brown blob. More white would have delineated the colors .  It's  going back
2.0,"I believe that this product has a good appearance, but the smell from it is terrible and it will not disappear for a long time. Therefore, this shoe should not be used."
2.0,"You’re getting them for cheap, so you lower expectations, but I am a little disappointed in how thin the material is."
2.0,Really disappointed with this product<br />I’m leaving for Africa in two days and don’t have time to get something else!  One mask was completely ripped in the wrapping!<br />I could believe it!<br />Sorry not impressed...thank you
2.0,"I like the case for the watch! Unfortunately, the band does not fit my average size wrist.  It is too big!"
2.0,They are nice but I ordered 18g and definitely did not get 18g unless they run smaller than what I've always had.
2.0,"Shipping was fast, but product was not what I was expecting. It had a very strong chemical odor and was much too small and flat to work as the type of petticoat we will need. However, it was cheap...so I guess I got what I paid for. Sending back and ordering a more expensive one."
2.0,"Very pretty, as expected... But im not sure on the size. I ordered a size 6, but it did not fit as other rings i have order in the same size do. I would recommend buying it in a size larger, as i cant really wear it as i initially intended due to this problem."
2.0,Band fits well but is very thin and looks cheap. Its not as thick as in the picture. I think at a cost of $17.99 I should have gotten a better quality watch band. Will order original next time.
2.0,Shirt itself is good quality. Pattern across the front is and iron on appliqué and is very stiff even after several washings. Not what I expected to receive. I kept the shirt because it is comfortable and wear it around the house. Overall it looks very cheap. Would not wear it out anywhere.
2.0,"I have small feet, but wide feet.  once my foot was in the shoe it wasn't so bad. But to get them on was a problem."
2.0,"It's doesn't have the size anywhere on it so i don't know if they sent me the wrong size or if its just too small even though i sized up. The fabric at the boob area fades when you put it on so the top and bottom of it doesn't match and it looks weird. When i opened the bag it was shipped in, the bag inside that was supposed to be holding the dress was already opened and looked very old and dirty. I have a biggish butt so any dress or skirt on me is usually short but this one is very very short so I'd wear something underneath. I was really looking forward to wearing this dress out because The Nightmare Before Christmas is my favorite movie but it just doesn't look right."
2.0,This dress could only be worn by a small chested woman!!! Not enough material between the bust and the waist!!
2.0,very disappointed. discription says 4 different colors. We recieve 2-2packs one was 2pairs of black and the other was 1 red 1 black. So 3 black 1 red no fun colors like pictured.
2.0,Fell apart after a couple of weeks. Was nice when it worked...
2.0,"They're super cute, but the earring backs were busted and the color was totally wrong. I ordered yellow, and what I received was clear. I don't even see that option?"
2.0,"Too small for a 12 year old. These elastics looked like a normal size on camera, but were way too tiny."
2.0,The shirt had two stains on it underneath the symbol.
2.0,Too large and not as defined as the pic at all I had to modify it a lot to get the effect I was happy with!
2.0,"While the tailoring quality seemed good on this dress, the bodice has a foam insert piece that covers from top of the chest all the way down to the waist. I found this dress impossible to put on as the section between the waist and the shoulders was very short. I was able to return this via Amazon with no problems whatsoever."
2.0,"My daughter was disappointed, because in the photo the suit looks dark blue and shiny. In person, it’s a brighter blue and it’s not shiny at all. We had to keep it anyway because it was for a trip and we didn’t have time to order another one."
2.0,They’re ok. I guess I ordered the wrong style. Seemed more like for the younger generation
2.0,Poor quality. Has already ripped in multiple places.
2.0,"I only gave 2 stars because there is a stretchy strap, on either side, on the top of the shoe. This rubs a raw place on his foot. He said he needs a sock,  which he doesn't want to be required to do with the house shoe on."
2.0,"Good quality hat.  However, the color I chose, spuce, was not spruce.  Spruce is rather dark.  This hat was a brighter green.  I bought it to wear to match my uniform, but will probably just give it to Goodwill."
2.0,"These bands worked great for awhile. After awhile the band wouldn’t stay clasped as I was trying to put it on. It became very frustrating, so I threw them out.<br /><br />The pink band also became discolored with the sun."
2.0,The product is cool. However the war Pieces are too long and have been splitting at both ends on each piece. He pins on nose pieces are so small can’t even change to new ones that came in set.
2.0,Sleeves fit funny. Pull forward or something. Looks weird. Like the length and cut otherwise.
2.0,The built in light was inadequate to make the time visible at night.
2.0,"you need a magnifier to see the diamonds or the design of the bracelet. for the price, i was extremly dissapointed."
2.0,"The slippers are warm, but the sole is so stiff I literally walk right out of them.  If you are looking for warm, usable slippers to wear around the house look elsewhere."
2.0,"This necklace in truly beautiful but the chain broke the third time I wore it. The company was very responsive and immediately refunded my purchase. If you buy this product be very careful when wearing it and make sure the chain doesn't catch on anything or it will break very easily. It is lovely and the freshwater pearls are great quality, but the chain is too delicate."
2.0,I love these pants.  The look and fit great however the thread used on the seams frayed after the first wash and got worse during subsequent washes.
2.0,brake easy
2.0,The owls are hard to see on the pendant.
2.0,"Pants were a little short for me, I’m 5’8”. However even after washing the material is very stiff and scratchy. Will be returning"
2.0,"Let me first say, I loved the thickness of the paded area but something had to be wrong with the ones we received.<br /><br /> I ordered 2 3packs from FSA store. We opened 1 of the boxes and found the undies were like a small but with a large tag on it. Since we opened the box (keep in mind they come completely enclosed, we were not allowed a refund; however, one was given on the 2nd and we were instructed to keep both boxes. I asked around and no one can fit them."
2.0,Too small and material is thin...
2.0,I always order half a size down in sandals & these were way to loose. Not good for walking around for a very long time. Also this is the type of sandal that makes a loud slapping noise when walking. I returned them and bought some croc sandals instead which were 3x the price but well worth it for the style and quality.
2.0,Bottom fits top too lose around the breast on the sides.
2.0,"These were returned, they didn't fit well on my face, they were too large but the style & design was cute and look great on someone who loves large glasses."
2.0,Although the sweater fits. The material is quite thin and gathers nylon balls even before washing.
2.0,Bought a medium and its way too big and the front panel looks sloppy :(
2.0,The dress was very cute ... but was huge in width.
2.0,I don’t love
2.0,"I bought a medium they gave me a small, and the fabric is so weird. Not worth the price, do not recommend."
2.0,Cheap feeling product.
2.0,The material is on the thinner side.
2.0,I really like this purse but after six months the zipper is already starting to pull away from the fabric. That should not happen with a pricey purse like this .
2.0,"These might work for some, but for me they fit very loosely on my face. Without a helmet, they're a little loose but with a bike helmet on, they slide around. If I look down, the glasses slide forward. They look nice though."
2.0,"The claws are pokey and very sharp and shaped odd compared to older rabbits feet I have. Sizes vary and the fur had sticky yellowish lookin stuff on it..maybe it was glue not sure...the feet smelled unpleasant. One of the feet had be broken in half by the toe and bone was exposed, hoping to get at least 1 of these to look nice as it was for a gift."
2.0,Chain is ok. Get what you pay for. I still like it
2.0,The stainless was not shiny.  It looked more grey than anything
2.0,"I do not like the turtleneck, it is very loose.  I was hoping for a snug fit."
2.0,Not made very well. Seams do not match. Cheaper light weight fabric. Disappointed.
2.0,Cute but for a teenager
2.0,it broke the first day when i wore it.
2.0,Fabric is awful... very disappointed
2.0,"The look was what I was looking for, however, the white and the black were very stiff. After washing were still very stiff and VERY wrinkled at the collar could not iron out all the wrinkles."
2.0,Some were hard to open and the clasps and loops break easily
2.0,TO SMALL !!!!!
2.0,the material is too heavy and rigid.  my 4 year old did not like it at all.  was too uncomfortable and heavy for him.
2.0,"First off, the sizing isn't very clear on which system it is going off of. It says men and women separately in two places in the title. I assumed it would end up just going off of men's sizing, and I was correct. However, the size isn't the issue...<br /><br />The bottom of the slippers has a thick, stitched tag near the heel that makes it extremely uncomfortable to walk in. Every step you take, the rear end of the shoe is only making contact with this leather tag at the bottom. There's no way to take them off other than to unstitch them.<br /><br />The material of the shoes is mediocre at best. The fabric is okay, however the soles and cushioning are virtually nonexistent. It feels like I'm walking on cardboard when I wear them.<br /><br />I'd hold off on purchasing these, they really aren't worth it in my opinion."
2.0,The bracelet broke into pieces. I didn’t understand why. One piece after another just popped off.
2.0,"The whole thing is soft, even the plates. Cheap"
2.0,They write that this is &#34;rose gold&#34; and it is. Quite. Clearly. Pink.
2.0,It’s a pretty shirt but not long enough at all thank goodness I have a child who I can pass this to
2.0,"The fit was great-But, the flaps are poorly designed.  You will have to pull your briefs down to urinate."
2.0,"I like a cross body handbag, I can put over and forget about it getting in the way, or losing it. I like ones that have an area that you can put often used cards, as well as cash so that you don't need to pull out a wallet. It has all these things. Yet I'm not happy, the strap is uncomfortably wide and the edges are sharp. I'm keeping it with the hope I may find a slender folded strap, a woman can hope."
2.0,I ordered a 6 tall and it came in a size 5/6. It looks short. Misleading sizing.
2.0,"Tiny child size, picture makes it look a lot bigger then it actually is. Not really worth the price."
2.0,"The shirt is beautiful, but I would recommend size down."
2.0,The top is cute and material relatively soft. But the pants have stitching that goes right across your private area.  It is the stitching for the pockets.  It looks ridiculous and makes that area look weird and bunchy.  I am keeping the top and throwing the bottoms out...
2.0,Not what I understood to by the description
2.0,Cute but the material is very thin and rips easily.
2.0,The center of seam of the neck did NOT line up with the center of the pocket. This made it extremely difficult when trying to put HTV on. I managed to make it work by cutting the design in 3 pieces to kinda distract from the obvious. I would've sent it back if I had had the time but it was a late Christmas present.
2.0,Not as pictured upon delivery.
2.0,this item was to small. I'm still wondering why I was only given a partial refund for this item. It was not damaged and was sent back as per instructed.  was given a confirmation that total refund would be given and it was not. please explain why
2.0,The middle slit goes SUPER high! Y'all can see my nickers!
2.0,Very cheap looking and the coloring is not as pictured.
2.0,"The first use was ok. I put it in, blew it, and it worked as expected. 3 months later I need to transport a wine again, and it revealed itself. It cannot hold air any more. I checked it and found no obvious leakage, but the air just couldn't stop leaking. So the whole idea of this bag is, it's trustworthy at least for the first time."
2.0,"Returning this item.  Although I like the style & fabric, the sleeves are way to tight.  I was disappointed because I really wanted a cute duster with a hood. I will have to continue looking :("
2.0,"Found it impossible to set.  Followed the instructions, and dial twirled.  But it show the wrong day, wrong time and wrong year.  Nothing I tried worked."
2.0,"Recently, I purchased two replacement batteries for 2 vests my wife and I have. I purchased the original battery for her, and the ""new in 2021 Mini 5k"" battery.<br /><br />The original square shaped brick battery is heavier, and features a rubberized exterior. It works MUCH LONGER than the ""new & smaller 2021"" battery. Hours longer, on high, medium, and low.<br /><br />The replacement battery on this listing lasts me about 30 minutes on high, 1 hour on medium, and just over an hour on low.<br /><br />Do NOT recommend this battery. I'll be purchasing the older style battery for my new vest (gave my new battery to replace my wife's dead one from 2019) and plan to use this as a portable charger only."
2.0,"It sheds a lot, but it does keep you warm."
2.0,Fabric is very poor quality. Photo looks different from product
2.0,Love the look. Smelled bad for a few weeks. The clip on the shoulder strap snapped in half after about 3 weeks so I can't use it anymore.
2.0,"I really like the dress and it was nicely designed as the dress. It fit to size and I really love how beautiful the blue was. The overall look is what I expected but the quality was far from it. The dress part was fine from what I had but I was only able to wear it once because the lace part broke after the first use.I was pretty disappointed because I really liked this dress. If you only want it for one thing or for a photoshoot, it looks just as it does on the picture but if you want it for an outfit to keep in your wardrobe, it definitely isn't worth it. Maybe I got a bad one but I am not going to repurchase for it to happen again."
2.0,"The hoodie came in the size I was expecting. However, I was expecting neon pink not pink(like Patrick star pink). The color on the icon does not match with the color of the product. Wanted the neon pink that was shown on the display of the item. Was very disappointed."
2.0,This mask is cute but that is the only thing I liked about it. It is bigger and not the quality I expected. I tried to return it to be told that the item can't be returned (It was a Prime purchase.). Please keep the no-return policy in mind if considering purchase.
2.0,It’s cute. Broke the first time my daughter wore it
2.0,Run very small. May have to go up 2 sizes.
2.0,I was very disappointed in this mask. I had specifically looked for one made in the USA so I purchased these. The fit is terrible. They gap on the sides and the metal on the nose is very flimsy and does not stay snug. I would not recommend these sorry to say. Had hoped for better😕
2.0,Broke almost immediately.  Disappointing
2.0,"It connecting mechanism that keeps it on your belt is a little flimsy, and the person who it was intended for has told me that it keeps unlatching itself repeatedly. Probably more useful as something that would sit on a shelf rather than around your waist."
2.0,"This is a GIANT cardigan. Super heavy and also very scratchy. It doesn’t necessarily look like the picture either, it’s a bit more “rainbow-y.”"
2.0,no lycra at all.  not how I want leggings to fit.
2.0,These chain extenders go from gold to silver in the matter of a week or two. They looked nice at first but now my necklace just looks odd. It extends your necklace but it doesn't look very good unless you have hair that will cover the extender.
2.0,Holy giant necklace batman
2.0,After 2 washes by hand it's coming apart.. definitely a favorite but not now since it's coming apart!
2.0,Feathers fell out before trying it on
2.0,Not what I expected.  These do not have a rubber sole.  They offer no grip or protection...so they’re essentially neoprene socks.
2.0,These are not something i would buy again. Not sure why but both of the ankle parts on both legs of these look as if they are stretched out. They are all bunched up. Definitely will be returning asap im 5’4” and 150 and they are too long as well.
2.0,The shoes were real stiff and hard to walk in.
2.0,Glasses do not make much of a difference
2.0,I bought the high waisted and mid waist and I’m very disappointed that the high waisted thong came apart the first time I wore it. The seam on the inside came undone and separated the material. It can still be worn but after a few washes I don’t think it will last.
2.0,"I didn't find this to be flattering at all. Without the belt it's just ridiculous, and with the belt it's just a whole lot of gathers. I returned it."
2.0,muy pequeño todo
2.0,"Despite being cute and fitting correctly, these were so uncomfortable I ended up tossing them in the trash after a few weeks. The seams are thick, coarse and rub against my skin causing irritation throughout the day."
2.0,had to order XXL to fit
2.0,too small.  wish it was designed to fit universally.
2.0,"The overalls are cute and fit as expected, but the smell is absolutely horrible. The overalls were purchased for a costume and I only had time to wash twice with baking soda, detergent and a fabric softener. After washing, they still smelled horrible."
2.0,"These masks were very very small. Perhaps OK for a woman, but not for a man."
2.0,It's cute but it's actually silver and didn't come with the pictured chain. It came with one of those really cheap ones you use on your ceiling fans as a pull chain....... it also looks cross-eyed because the eyes weren't made properly. In fact it didn't even come with in the month shipping and it was ticking when I got it. Who knows how long the battery will last.
2.0,"If you have curves or hips, size up. Was too fitted to move or comfortably walk in."
2.0,There was a stitching flaw and I had to return it!
2.0,"The first time I bought these a year ago, they were amazing lasted up to a year, the second purchase recently total junk, husband had holes in them within a month. Disappointed that the quality changed so drastically within a year"
2.0,Looks really fake and cheap. Especially compared to similar items I’ve purchased.
2.0,Size up twice if you can. Super sad this didn’t work for me. Love the color and length
2.0,The waist is a thin strip of elastic so they leave a muffin top and aren't flattering unless the top is covered.
2.0,This design is only good for people with arch problems.
2.0,I like it but the material is cloth not spandex
2.0,Doesn't fit at all. Very poor quality.
2.0,fell apart when i got it before wearing it
2.0,"I purchased the turquoise bracelet and it has 10mm beads, I purchased two more bracelets and they were smaller, same as 8mm bracelets I have. Not going to return but disappointed."
2.0,I thought the print on the fabric looked kind of cheap.
2.0,"I order a first pair of these earrings and one came very tarnished and the other a little bit tarnished, then I asked for a replacement and the second pair came today, April 2, 2021 and they are a little tarnished as well. Very sad because they are beautiful on, now I don’t know if I should return the second pairs or just use them like that."
2.0,"The message below pertains to the 3 previous pairs I bought previously. This 2nd pair of black pants was also an extra-large, and to my disappointment, they were more like a size Medium with an X-Large tag. Could not even snap them. The other 3 pair are holding strong and fit perfectly as hoped. Maybe I just got a bad apple.<br />Love these pants, I wear a size 14, bought an X-Large and they are perfect. The pockets hold ID money, meaning no purse. The only thing I wish they had was a built in belt. I bought  more pairs and a belt."
2.0,I really like how it feels and how it looks.  I like the concept also but the problem I have it that is does not stay attached and comes off several times a day.  I will be buying a different band because of this issue.
2.0,Cheaply made. Poor quality. Photo looks much nicer than real product.
2.0,"This cardigan is really cute, super soft, and the fit is perfect, but my sleeve started unraveling the first day I wore it."
2.0,Get what you pay for... ok for a few wears. Not everyday shoes
2.0,The hat is so cute but arrived damaged. Hoping I can fix it with hot glue it’s for my costume and don’t have time to get another. Bummed
2.0,"It fits correctly. However, there is a small snap at the v that is very obvious. No matter how I tried to manipulate the fabric/top, I couldn't hide it. Because of this, I returned it, as I was looking for a clean look, as indicated in the pictures."
2.0,not tall enough
2.0,The doors are very hard to open so you end up ripping the box. The boxes aren't divided so once you take a pair out all the other socks move all over the place and you can see them before opening the next box. The quality of the socks isn't bad but they are a little thin.
2.0,Cute print. The fit is off. Make sure you size up!
2.0,"The ring is very thin making it likely to catch on something a pull off or break in two.  Likewise the ring isn't solidly filled, but has holes/gaps where material should be."
2.0,not as fitted as I would hope
2.0,"We were so bummed, these broke only a couple hours after assembling them."
2.0,Nice glasses but they came with only one rubber support for my nouse
2.0,"The glasses are definitely oversized...more like costume glasses than something I'll be able to actually wear.<br />They fit super tight too, would probably give me a headache if I actually would wear them.<br />They're like something a kid would play dress up with"
2.0,"I'm very particular about my choice of polarized sunglasses. After researching some options, I thought that this would last for the long haul. Unfortunately, the nose part of the sunglasses broke after only using them for one year. If you are looking for polarized sunglasses under $25, I would recommend at looking at other options."
2.0,Too small.  I need to return it.
2.0,I have never seen a watch strap that has felt this cheap before.  I needed a cheap alternative but I was not expecting something like this.  The material is synthetic but does not have the thickness or toughness of anything resembling leather.  I have resorted to not wearing it with the fear that the strap will break and watch face will be lost.
2.0,"It's not even close what they show in add ,material low quality."
2.0,One of diamonds was out upon opening it and the flower does not look like the picture.
2.0,"FYI: flowers are not touching, chain will break on the first day. But other than that its cute though and arrived on time."
2.0,They were ok until two of the pairs out of the 4 total that I recieved didn't close because it seemed blocked inside the part I close
2.0,This watch is too large for my for my personal taste. Beautiful watch!
2.0,"I want to give these a 5 star. They are very comfortable, but I have two reasons for the bad review. 1. They are slightly big, I always order lg but I would have ordered a med in these. 2. The pant lengths are noticeably different. I tried to get a pic of it, but I’m not sure if it shows it well enough. So I won’t wear them in public. Too bad. Bc again, super comfortable & will be perfect for after c-section."
2.0,"Was too small and too tight for my 8 y.o. , otherwise cute designs"
2.0,"Flawed design, the arm pivot is two thin pieces of plastic that act as a spring, they are bound to fail if you use these regularly."
2.0,"Sorry, no photos because the length is so short that you can see my 8 year old’s undies.<br /><br />I was hoping it would be a cute summer option for my kid, but it’s just too revealing. It’s now going to be used for jammies.<br /><br />If there were at least another 2 inches added to the leg length, it would be more appropriate for young people to wear in public."
2.0,The material and headband part are perfect. The visor is too small.
2.0,"As other reviewers have pointed out, these nose pads have to be glued in place. But it's a delicate operation and the pads don't sit firmly in the correct position so it's easy to glue them somewhat misaligned. Also, if you don't use the right glue the pads pop off and can't be reglued.  Bolle should provide a tiny glue capsule or at least recommend what kind of glue to use."
2.0,The pin is nice but I found it to have a long sharp pin that sticks through the back clasp so sticks me.
2.0,"I ordered a 6g (4mm) and i received closer to a 2g, which is two sizes bigger. Jewelry itself isn't the worst quality, but still."
2.0,not as cute as I thought but it is allright
2.0,The jacket is not constructed enough so it does not hand well on the body.  Fits more like a loose sweater than a Blazer jacket.
2.0,"The belts have a mold smell and I received 2 identical blue belts and no black one, which I really need."
2.0,These bras are thick and bulky. Not comfortable at all due to stiff material on the sides that start to really jab after a couple of hours. The straps are really wide and stiff.
2.0,I didn’t like the way these fit on the ear.
2.0,"This was too thin. The pattern was pretty, but was not flattering on"
2.0,"Not fitted like described and it looks more black than navy, plus the pocket has a hole in it"
2.0,"You get what you  pay for, they broke off of the left ear after 6 month. Maybe due to sun.?.?"
2.0,"Just bought these about 2 wks ago, and there’s already a hole in them  that I didn’t make by snagging it on anything, and there’s lots of pilling of the fabric already, and I haven’t washed them once! Finally, they’re suppose to work while using your cell phone, but they only sometimes do (very inconsistent.) I’m bummed to have to return them because they’re nice and warm. I would NOT but these!"
2.0,Bracelet broke pretty soon after we got it. My daughter is a little rough on her belongings so I am not giving this one Star and it was super cute while it lasted!!
2.0,You get what you pay for..never again.
2.0,"I was hoping they would of been just a little more tight in the belly area and the gray ones have strings coming off them. They are also baggy I weigh 160 and I'm 5""6 so a medium should of fit me perfectly. I wanna end this on a good note so they are really soft"
2.0,"It look nice on the model, I was expecting a better fit. Not sexy enough to be a cocktail dress"
2.0,"The belt is fine and the width is also okay, but the belt buckle is huge (!) and the entire belt is also very thick and heavy. This makes it unsuitable for 90% of the occasions where I would need a casual belt."
2.0,"The right side frame was shipped with damage. The packing was very good (case inside of a box, inside of another box). The lenses are a bit lighter brown than expected, but other than the frame damage they are decent glasses."
2.0,This definitely has Asian sizing. It way 3 sizes to big for this American. Even by road bike standards this is very small. The material is nice
2.0,This dress ran large (I ordered based on the size chart). But I didn't bother ordering it in a smaller size because there is a very unfortunately placed dart sewn directly in the middle front of the skirt which I can't imagine would look good even if I sized down. So sad because I loved the style of this dress.
2.0,"Awful material and made poorly. It was made out of something that seemed disposable, like the disposable gowns you get in a hospital, only a little thicker. I returned it. Also very small. I gave two stars instead of one for easy return."
2.0,"Cute, but too big even though it’s adjustable. Also I think it just looks cheap."
2.0,These pants are really warm and super high waisted. Fit is weird
2.0,"I received a pair that is significantly lighter than the one pictured, and I don't like the look of it as much. These woulda be a lot cooler in a darker tone."
2.0,"The fit was a little small in the sleeve and also in the length.  Also, the first time I washed the hooded sweatshirt, the crocodile emblem (NOT SEWN ON) fell off.  I've got a few Lacoste items and I realize that they are built with a target frame that is much different and smaller than my own--and even after factoring that into my choice, it still fit rather small. Not gonna lie, it was pretty disappointing.  Especially for spending the loot. Still a nice, stylish hoodie but much less snappy without the crocodile, go figure."
2.0,"Loved this style and patterning, but the fit was just not for me. Despite ordering a size larger the normal, the cups were maybe three sizes too small, and this did not fit a long torso well. Also did not think the item was particularly well made as stitching was very apparent. Very cute style, however."
2.0,The skirt was shorter than expected on a person who is  5’3”
2.0,Not good value.  The charm fell off the necklace.
2.0,"Its akward, im not sure if its becuse of my buit or the dress is just not made right."
2.0,Well these did not hold up like i thought they would play lot of baseball but min i am done in the case and put away ton of scratches. The other thing is the lens color from the middle to the outside is way diffrent so messes up vision a little. The mirror is more of a dull red to pink
2.0,"It’s low cut in the front, exposing more then you would like. It’s not a flowy material, and it’s too thick. I returned it."
2.0,"Very cute, however, the pompoms (sp?) came off of one of the shoes the very first time she wore them. Within a couple of weeks, no more pompoms."
2.0,Made for a child. Much smaller than picture.
2.0,Pretty cheap quality and one of them has already broken after only getting to wear it once and having it for a few weeks.  I would recommend investing in a higher quality product that may be a little more expensive.
2.0,So I got my normal size. It's not squat proof. You can see the tag and the material sheering out. It's quite tight and has a slick feeling. Like EverLux but lower quality. Wouldn't recommend. Color was pretty thought. The light blue.
2.0,"These are cut oddly and leave more flesh exposed near the toes than I like. Also, the lack of coverage towards the arch of the foot makes a huge difference in staying on my foot... even when simply walking. I bought another pair that gave proper coverage and is soooo much better for my feet for basically the same price."
2.0,"I loved the design of this product, it was great up until it started not being the metal color it originally was and became a copper color... it made it super disappointing"
2.0,"Stiff material, kinda frumpy looking"
2.0,Tight in the chest area and semi-see through. Using as a beach cover up instead of a dress
2.0,"I have had several of these.  The first two lasted for a couple of years each.  The last ones didn't do so well.  Possibly a design change.  The end of the stem that you pull out to set the time fell off of two of them after only a couple of months.  I tried to contact customer service, but never got an answer.  I'll have to find a hardy replacement.  Dissatisfied!"
2.0,"This lovely little dress was a birthday present for my niece. However, when delivered it was so badly wrinkled, I had to hand it in the bathroom for 3 days and then steam it to get the wrinkles out. It was sent to me like a piece of garbage. And if I hadn’t needed to give it to her so soon, I would have returned it. The way it was packaged and sent to me was a disgrace! Not like it was on sale or anything. It looked like it had been in a trash can for weeks I do NOT recommend this item."
2.0,The proportions are weird
2.0,"Unfortunately the magnet doesn't look like the picture - It's a flat rectangular with image printed on it. I will not bother to return, but this is disappointing."
2.0,I still had to wear a strapless bra over this.  It did not stick very well and did absolutely no lifting for me.
2.0,It looks like the pic but started peeling about two months after I got it. I didn’t order again.
2.0,It kept falling off my bra strap
2.0,Rather thin.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this. The hood is too heavy, the sleeves are incredibly long, and the strings for the hood hang down to my waist. The color is great but that's about all."
2.0,To small for.my eyes brow and not worth $10
2.0,The bottom curls up overtime I wear it.
2.0,"Really cute, but way too heavy!!"
2.0,Little tighten
2.0,Xl=size 2... cute just super tiny
2.0,Used for face cover in public. Funny print face looks great. Lacking of above the nose support makes it difficult to keep on.
2.0,"We were excited to receive these goggles and used them right away. The blue pair has lasted for five or six uses so far, but the black pair broke on the second use. A little piece of plastic snapped on the back and now the goggles won’t stay on. It’s unfortunate because the blue power works pretty well."
2.0,"These glasses are great quality, offer great protection, and don’t fog. The only downside is they’re HUGE which renders them ineffective if you don’t keep your head perfectly still and upright. They kept falling down my face which meant not only were my eyes not protected but I had to adjust them with my contaminated hands. I plan on giving my three unopened pairs to co-workers."
2.0,I don't really like how it hooks together.
2.0,"Cute suit but top is way too small, had to return"
2.0,I ordered the color khaki and it came in a mustard yellow. The quality over all was pretty poor. I understand this is a cheap item I just expected the material to not feel like a paper bag
2.0,Pretty but runs very small. Returned and not reordering.
2.0,"I only wear a Men's 8.5 US, and these socks are tight.  Now, I read reviews stating that they should be good up to a Men's 11.  WHAT???  Maybe if you cut your toes off, first.  Or make your horse wear them for a month first to stretch them out.<br /><br />These do not look like anything like products shown at Sketchers website.  Real Sketchers socks are quite pricey.<br />I think as I manually stretch these out and break them in, they are going to be more serviceable than the Fila, Union Bay, Gold Toe, and other ""name brand"" or fakes that I've purchased in stores lately."
2.0,"The print was blurry and the shirt hang far too loose for my frame (wight 135, height 5'2&#34;, chest D). It came early which was nice, but I just can't wear it comfortably. The quality on whole was good but not what I wanted or expected."
2.0,"These are okay. One lense is cut short so there is a small gap between the frame and edge. The lense has popped out twice. I like the look, and they are polarized, but they probably won’t last the whole summer."
2.0,"Actually hurts your head. Doesn't even go down the sides of your head like a hat but it sits on top above where a crown would be.  Without the strap, it falls off.  I regret this purchase,  and I bought three!"
2.0,I appreciate AMAZON taking care of my purchase issue.  Super easy and painless.  The QC IS No. 76.  Thank you again.  Will be purchasing other items soon!
2.0,fibers tickle the nose- it is not easy to wear as the fibers of the material were bothersome to the nose. Maybe a smoother/different weave of cotton would reduce loose fibers?
2.0,Too small trying to return it
2.0,way too small!!
2.0,Dislike material and fit so tight. I like satin but this will not do 😐
2.0,I was disappointed that it came with the gem out of the necklace. So I’ve never even worn the set.
2.0,I was disappointed in those slippers. They’re not very constables.
2.0,"Disappointed , as the picture shows this to be much bigger then what it is, and the length to be short, as it says this is a choker like the new style is.<br />This  necklace is at least 18, 20 inch long at its shortest .<br />The stars are the size for a child. If this was shorter it would have looked ok with the small stars.<br /><br />Do not get hair spray on this or shampoo.."
2.0,"Lasted one trip (5 days) before arm strap started to rip off of the bag. Nice and light, compact. Just wish it would have lasted longer."
2.0,I ordered a medium in this dress and it Looked like I ordered an extra large. I immediately return this dress because I was not impressed.
2.0,"No idea why other reviewers described these pajamas as “silky”!  I purchased these, tucked the package away in a drawer, and forgot them until last night.  I wish I’d forgotten about them permanently.  I’m writing this review after a miserable attempt at sleeping in these things.  First, the top fits fine.  The bottoms are uncomfortably snug. But the material!  Hot, unforgiving - sort of like trying to sleep in a garment made out of a discarded balloon.  Pajamas are meant for sleep, not for an instagram opportunity!  After hours of trying, I gave up and changed at 2:30 a.m.  Never again will I purchase polyester and spandex sleepwear."
2.0,I don’t feel the pictures portray what the pants actually look like. I am 5’7 and they were way too short. Very boxy and not flattering.
2.0,"The problem I had was the pegs that slide in to hold your shirt in place are rubber which allow them to squeeze out of the holders. I wore this product for an hour interview and my shirt came out of a holder 3 separate times. That being said, when the shirt was held, the product was wonderful."
2.0,Fabric is ok ; came 2 sizes too small; sleeves are very puffy; but it is pretty.
2.0,The earrings are beautiful but the fabric was coming off in package.
2.0,"This is two identical pieces of fabric sewn together. That means there are no darts for your bust, which results in it being tight through the nipple area causing a sports bra smash type of look. I ordered an XL though I’m usually a L because I saw in the reviews it runs right in the chest. I’m 5’8” with a 36D chest) and it was very tight in the chest and looked like a sparkling potato sack everywhere else. Will be returning. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
2.0,Thin and flimsy with unsightly seam
2.0,"I cannot use it on my Samsung ATIV Tab 3. I'm returning it, because I especially bought it for that."
2.0,I thought this would be a perfect gift for my best friend's birthday. I was so disappointed when it came. It wasn't even in a box. It was just wrapped in some cellophane. And it was very poor quality. It looked like something you would get at a dollar tree. It really was that bad.
2.0,"If I had seen this in a store before I purchased, I would have passed.  The quality of the material is one of those you know after several washings it will look worn/used.  Probably one season worth of wear.  Color was decent.  Pretty thin for winter wear, at least up north."
2.0,Looks good. A bit snug and the clasp doesn't fasten.
2.0,"This is new model of Casio and inferior to older models.  Instead of battery, I purchased new watch.  Big mistake."
2.0,"I had three pairs of suede mocs that I've had through all the season's.  The blue and brown pair weren't showing any stains so this product did ok.  The taupe pair did have stains and this product did not remove them.  For a wet cleaner, it did not damage the suede in any way, but it didn't work well either.  Additionally it doesn't work as the directions say.  If you wet the brush and put on a few drops of solution, it  doesn't even wet the shoe.  I had to put some water in the sink and add a good bit of solution then dip the brush in that to wet my shoes and work up a lather."
2.0,"I really wanted to give these more than 2 stars. I bought these because description said ""UV protection"". I am sad to report, this is not the case. I am severely allergic to UV rays of any kind. I put these gloves on to protect my hands while driving and I could still feel the sun burning me thru the back of the gloves. I do like the grip on the palm. They feel more like gardening gloves than driving gloves."
2.0,Size was larger than expected
2.0,The buckle does not stay clasped very well.
2.0,"I have had 3 pairs of these. These safety glasses are great, except for one problem. The nose pads basically turn to mush after a few weeks of wearing them, then they fall off, making them uncomfortable and annoying to wear. I would have given theses glasses 5 stars if it were not for those nose pads, that is a huge drawback."
2.0,I ordered a total of 4 pair of these shorts and the sizes were all over the map. I finally took a pair to get altered as I liked the shorts themselves and the quality was good.
2.0,I ordered the black and the black/white pattern together and the black fit perfectly. The patterned one was way too small. I am not sure why they were different sizes. I could not use it and gave it to a friend.  Total bummer!<br /><br />Update! They were so kind and gave me a refund :)))  Sure these things happen.
2.0,At first sight the dress is nice. Had ordered it for a wedding. I did not know until I opened the package that there were black skulls on the overlay - not appropriate for the church wedding I was attending.
2.0,"It's ok, but not better than the ones from the GrubHub driver store. It looked good upon arrival, but after days of sweating in it, I cleaned it and the vinyl letters look wrinkled like they might come off if I wash it again. Save some money and get it directly from GrubHub...their letters are embroidered on and don't come off."
2.0,I ordered a SMALL but received a MEDIUM.  A bit too large and not worth the hassle of returning.
2.0,It works yes but it is such a pain to put on and don't even get me started about washing it plus it's like this thing is ment for someone 6 foot or taller. The waist part really could use some length so if you have a long torso or your a shorty I wouldn't recommend.
2.0,So I gave it 2 stars because the hat is cute but the string chokes my bear die I had to cut it and it still is tight they needed to make it more adjustable for bearded dragons
2.0,Moisture wicking does not work for me. The heel has wore out in less then 10 wearings. Not gold toe standards at all or the company has just cut quality.
2.0,"This H2H Mens Active Slim Fit Polo T-Shirt is made of 100% Polyester, which is light weight, soft and easy to dry, yes, this kind of material is suitable for sports. But I don't like this polo T-shirt.<br />First of all, too much overlap and sewing make this T-shirt not so flat, I'd prefer a pure color rather than overlaps on shoulder and underarm; Then, the material is very soft, you have to be strong enough to hold it, then it might be a good tight polo T-shirt for you;<br />It says slim fit, but the M size is with 42"" chest???  There are also two different size charts that make me confusion, don't know which size I should choose."
2.0,Not bad for a cheap ring but the stones fell out very quickly.
2.0,"Looks nice enough but the small is too big?  It's a stretch belt, right, so not impressed with that."
2.0,Neck size probably a 15 1/2 at best.
2.0,Color does not match online and the item is tiny (pictured with a fork for comparison). The box is unusable as it has stickers all over it that leave behind residue and it says ZJChao in big gold lettering. The item is decent quality if you’re in a pinch.
2.0,Fit swell that's the only reason why I kept it
2.0,Sleeves didn't come down to the wrist. Very see through.
2.0,The strings fell out after the first wash
2.0,Not a fan. Poor material
2.0,"5'2, 164 lbs, Large: I ordered this product to wear for a Navy Ball and when I received it, I was disappointed. I ordered a thong (#2) but I received a full size panty with 3 small snaps buttons at the crotch which was impossible to stay close. The waist, tummy and back part were fine and fitted as expected but the crotch refused to stay snap/close. Sending it back."
2.0,"While the chest size is accurate and fit fine, this item did not fit around my stomach. I fit into a regular suit model where the pants size if a 6 inch drop from the chest size. However, with this vest the chest fit fine but the stomach part was a good 3 or 4 inches from buttoning. Very disappointed. I wound up buying a 2XL vest from a local formal wear shop and that vest fit like a charm."
2.0,3 of the large dragons were broken on arrival.  The smaller ones are not perfectly flat and need to be worked flat to be flush on the tape.  Not great.
2.0,Was just so small it was too tight for my child
2.0,"Took forever to come. Zippers won't work, if I were to pull they would break. Was unaware it was junk being made in China not worth the money."
2.0,"What others have said is true. 1) the pattern is only on one side of the earring. 2) the earrings don't hang properly, kind of pointing outward 3) one of the closures was put on backwards. I just opened  it up, and placed it on the correct side. Overall, not pleased but too much trouble to send back."
2.0,Would have given it a higher rating if the band didn't wear out and break so often. Ended up ditching the wallet for a better one. Not bad for the price but not worth it to me
2.0,"Ordered a XXL, and it is smaller than a U.S. Large.<br />Too much of a hassle to send it back to the U.K..<br />I'll try to sell it and re-coop some of the cash, although I really did want the shirt."
2.0,This bracelet slips off at every opportunity. Tried squeezing it in and it squeezed back.  One good thing about it though it does not change its colour
2.0,"I always seemed to be in between belt holes, so I would end up drilling my own holes in between the standard ones. When I got this belt I thought it was the proverbial best thing since sliced bread, since I could adjust to the nearest quarter inch instead of the typical 1 inch spacing, and easily let it out after pigging out. The belt looked great, but after about 18 months the faux leather veneer is wearing off, and more importantly a cotter pin fell out of the buckle mechanism, making the clasp spring open and release the belt. The other annoying problem is that the lever to open the belt is exactly at countertop height for me (I'm 5'-9.5"" ) so anytime I leaned against a counter, the belt would release. I went back to a traditional buckle belt. You can't beat the longevity of a simpler design with fewer moving parts."
2.0,"Unfortunately this was too large and short. It sat on the top of my head and a light breeze would have thrown it off. It was really cute, however I need it to stay on and there was not a way to adjust."
2.0,The backs popped off these as soon as we opened the package. We superglued them back on but was very disappointing for children.
2.0,These are very thin. They slide down easily and often. Well made though and convenient just fo y use in crowds even with filter it will fall often.
2.0,Im only 5'8' but these just are too short.  Please make them in a tall size!
2.0,Nice details but the clasp didn't stay set.  One clasp was OK but the other not.  Bought as a set so had to return both.
2.0,"The shoes were too tight and I wore them, or tried to, and they were to tight and I thought I couldn't return then.  That don't fit Sharco Feet."
2.0,"I bought this because my daughter was Minnie Mouse this Halloween and wore her costume every day to shreds. She loves being a Minnie Mouse princess so I had hoped to swap out the dress, but this dress was the old model, not as well made, and not as pretty. My daughter refused to wear it."
2.0,Leather is dry and cracked. Smells moldy. The width is way too small for boot laces. Would not recommend. Also took forever to arrive. Almost a month.
2.0,They really don’t stay on.
2.0,"It was tight on my breasts. I am a 38 DD. So if you have curves, they will be smashed down and look like they are sagging. It might make you feel uncomfortable or it might make you feel fabulous."
2.0,Cut is comfortable and the elastic is thick and sturdy but the fabric that it’s made out of is NOT cotton and not breathable. It may be ok for winter/fall but for summer or being active this is a bad choice.
2.0,The v shape neck is so loose! You need to have a big chest for this to fit properly. Or ruin it by wearing pins in it to keep the chest closed.
2.0,"I bought this because I love opals and was looking for a fun ring for my index finger. I ordered this a size up from my ring finger size because my index is wider. It fits perfectly, and the band is just the right width so that the ring is comfortable to wear. It feels sturdy and high quality, much nice than you’d expect for $5. My only complaint is that the photo on amazon makes it look like this is a proper synthetic opal, when in reality it looks and feels a lot more like hardened glitter glue. I still love it, and you can’t really tell without looking closely at the ring, so it’s not a huge issue, but I felt it was worth noting. Nobody who wears this ring is going to think it’s a real opal, but it’s still a pretty ring to wear.<br /><br />Edit: deducted 2 stars because the metal is just a silver coating, which has started to chip away over time."
2.0,the earrings were dull  in comparison to the picture no glow I felt disappointed {tears}
2.0,Item was not as pliable as described.  Too tight on the face.
2.0,"I had higher expectations for this coat since it was so pricey! $40 plus...The material is very pretty, but flimsy, the ONLY 'warm' part in this jacket is d inside fleece, d outside of it is just a &#34;very thin&#34; nylon type cover. Overall i will not recommend this &#34;winter coat&#34;, is not very warm. At least not for me, we're outside a lot since i dnt have a car, so i had to buy her another &#34;winter coat&#34; for half d price and double d warmth....."
2.0,"very small, pictures are really deceiving. and both my bracelets had some black crude on the back. for only a dollar i guess its ok, but i ordered these to check the quality because i had hoped to buy about 200 and resale but very poor quality. cant resale them, no way."
2.0,Won’t stay on. Feels like right size but keeps falling off
2.0,Thin material and super see through.
2.0,"NOT PURPLE!  I was very disappointed with the color on this. I looked for hours trying to find a complete set, at least a necklace and earrings that were dark purple and there are only a handful of them on Amazon that were within my price range. This set is ok, it's pretty much what you see, and it would have been ok, except it IS NOT PURPLE at all!  It is clearly red and I don't know why they are even advertising this as purple. I read the prior reviews and other recent reviewers said the same thing but I figured it was perhaps a misinterpretation of the color. But, nope they were correct. Maybe earlier buyers did receive a purple set because there are some reviews that state that they got a purple set. I am not really happy though because it is obviously red. It's not like you could sort of call it purple."
2.0,I didn’t like that it was too tight. I bought it to wear over a dress for Christmas and it was too tight
2.0,"The first picture that is kind of a maroon color is the actual dress. The other picture that is of a purple dress is what it was supposed to be. The waist is a little smaller than the size chart and the bust is just a little bigger, but the overall fit is ok. We can make the fit work. But I am devastated over the color difference because this dress is for my daughters sweet sixteen party and the color isn't working with the colors of her party. The sequins seem to be sewn on loosely so they will be easy to come off. Overall the price is very expensive for what we actually got."
2.0,"UPDATE 3/20/2018 We just took these glasses out after not using them in the winter.  She wore them a few times and I noticed the scratches are even worse on the lenses and the foldable handle broke open after a few uses this year.  So we've tossed them and we are back to our regular glasses from now on.  See below for my original review from August 2017<br />-------------------------------------<br />I bought two different pairs of these sunglasses for my kids.  They are cute but the lenses seem cheap.  The Trolls glasses already had scratches on the lens before I even opened the box.  It's minor but it's right in the middle of the lens.  I'm afraid the sunglass layer will scratch off easy so I already warned my kids these glasses might not last them very long so they won't be surprised if we have to get rid of them quickly.  It's pretty neat to be able to fold them up small and put them in a pocket or a bag.  The frames seem sturdy enough, but I'm just disappointed in the quality of the lens themselves."
2.0,Product rolls up constantly and ripped the first day I got it.
2.0,"I purchased these for my husband after having a hip replaced. Even though I measured his calf and ankle and ordered the correct size, we still could not get the stockings on. I would suggest going 1 or 2 sizes bigger."
2.0,These pants are just a ton of fabric! Not worth the money.
2.0,Cheaply made. Not ideal for outside wear.
2.0,I did not like this skirt.  It is not a true fit.  I ordered an medium and it was way to small.  I will never order any more of Annflat Women's African products.  not a true fit.
2.0,"I order this as a gift for someone else in an 3XL.  It ended up fitting as a woman's large, way mis-sized.  There are no tags with a brand, size or care instructions anywhere on the jacket.  Just a generic paper tag on the outside with the size and ""made in China"".  The color, fabric and overall sewing wear very nice.  Too bad that it's not an actual 3XL."
2.0,The white part from the inside shows so I won't be wearing it. It fit good.
2.0,Tarnishes silver coins
2.0,"Cute and inexpensive. I ordered 2 but for some reason they shipped them separately and one never arrived. I did get a refund for the missing bag, but  I am still very disappointed  because  I wanted to present  my daughter with the second one for our annual mother-daughter  Christmas shopping day, and  now they are sold out."
2.0,"Two small for size suggested, otherwise ok."
2.0,"They look great, but they don’t stay buckled and come off if you don’t notice. Too easy to lose."
2.0,Smaller than expected.  Did not like the quality. I returned this item
2.0,"I love the dress and I have room to grow, but I pulled it out and had a stain on it and needed that dress for pictures and they stained couldn't get out due to the material!! Very disappointed in that!"
2.0,"While the price for these leggings is great, you truly get what you pay for.  I loved the way they fit!  They were high waisted and thick.  Not see through at all!  Unfortunately, after wearing each pair the first time, they became rough like velcro.  EVERYTHING sticks to them.  Even a lint roller will not remove the things that cling to these leggings!  Lint has to be picked off one piece at a time with your fingers, and it's a never ending job!  I would not buy these leggings again unless I was treating them as a disposable purchase."
2.0,"Comes as shown but very cheap, color changed almost immediately."
2.0,It was a gift and to me it was cheap looking and feeling.
2.0,"Comes in a nice box and looks nice.<br />But after one day, a piece of the bracelet started coming out. I returned it."
2.0,"I ordered this and instead of the champagne color, it came in peach. There isn't a bow/tie on the bottoms as pictured. Very skinny tight waist band that doesn't seem comfortable. Material is thin and will probably shrivel when washed. Totally disappointed.  This was a gift and I would be embarrassed to give these to anyone.  I will be returning them."
2.0,not the fit we were hoping for.
2.0,"The ring looks nice, but it is NOT comfortable. Every time I take it off, my finger is irritated, dry and peeling, and red. It’s the same for my husband as well. This started from day 1. The size is a little tighter than expected too. I’m actively searching for something better."
2.0,"the posts are too delicate and the back posts much too small- stones look good<br />but since the earrings aren't sturdy enough, I've only worn them once."
2.0,"Way too big in chest area. Impossible to wear and not show everything.  Nothing like in pic, sequins are big and cheap."
2.0,Much smaller than expected. Holes on sides make lipsticks and pens fall out.
2.0,The material is thin and definitely a little see through and I got the burgundy one. The length was not great.  Cuts off mid shin. So i am gonna have to hem it or wear it in the fall with leggings. And it was slightly tighter then similar dresses i have purchased from other company’s.
2.0,Too small had to return. Arms were very tight<br />. Style wsss cute & color was great
2.0,"These tactical pants are of good quality and design buy three of these the problem is the information provided by the seller regarding the sizes buy size L, which should be for an adult size 36, but the pants fit my son who has 16 years old and take size 28 to 30, that is why my 2 star rating should correct your information for the future"
2.0,Broke in two seconds .wouldnt recommend
2.0,The handbag is attractive but I really don't like the fabric. It looks like plastic and is shinier than I expected.The color is also brighter than I would have liked. Such is life when you order online.
2.0,"This product has a lot of potential to be an excellent product but it is NOT! It was poorly put together and not even complete. There were lots of holes and the string of feathers were itchy and hard. The only good thing that came perfect was the thong and the satin wrap to keep the robe closed. It’s not worth the return because the customer has to pay for shipping even tho it’s the company’s fault. And it sheds like crazy, I’ve been finding feathers everywhere since opening up package."
2.0,"I am returning this swimsuit.  I really like the style and pattern, but the bust area does not have enough support as does the rest of the suit for me.  I really like it, but the size does not seem true."
2.0,Beautiful dress but said it was a petite dress and it was not
2.0,This is just a basic cotton shirt. It shows sweat quite prominently. Doesn't seem to wick like most golf shirts I have. Meh.
2.0,Ordered the Navy and received the black. Ordered an XL based on the sizing provided and it did not fit. Not the best material either.
2.0,They don’t warm your feet at all!! I wear em cause I work outdoors. My feet are never warm. They’re just another pair of designer socks. I was fooled. Don’t be a sucker like me.
2.0,"NOT comfortable, looks like a costume! The “lace” part looks fake and plasticy/tacky and the swimsuit seams are SO ITCHY"
2.0,Valves keep falling out
2.0,"Runs small, returned it."
2.0,"I got the pink, purple and green set, and have to say that the colors are much darker and “muddier” in person, nothing like the photo."
2.0,"The glare on these is pretty bad. It is very distracting. These goggles seem to scratch extremely easily. So I got tear offs. These goggles do not hold the tear offs too well, as there is one post per side, so the tear offs sort of curl up around the edges (I got the tear offs specific to these goggles)"
2.0,"Bought it to use an outfit, ended up looking like a hairstylist coat"
2.0,"It doesn't fit the same as on picture.  Designed pretty bulky in the arms and shoulders. Buttons are about to fall off.  Read some good reviews, thought I'd give it a try. Disappointed"
2.0,"This dress was like a tent. It had to be returned, Way too much fabric in the skirt area and somewhat see through."
2.0,"Durable it is not.  The lining inside is weak and has very little give.  I had my wallet, phone and keys inside and sometimes my tablet.  The seams just disintegrate and my keys some how caused the linning to split.  I loved the design but the quality of the lining is poor."
2.0,"You get what you pay for. Lots of torn threads, very wrinkly, fragile ..."
2.0,The picture is misleading.  It truly is more of a sweater than a jacket.
2.0,"Fabric was not what I was expecting and the black lines on the leg are VERY tight. Unfortunately, the cutouts were not flattering on my body type 😔"
2.0,"arrived broken, very fragile"
2.0,"About half the box was large , the second half was medium. Never did just one glove come out."
2.0,The shirt image is blurry if you stretch the shirt the image stretches making it even more blurry. Won't buy this again or recommend it.
2.0,Not quality material or workmanship.  Colors of both were dull.  Rough crepe material.
2.0,Cheap fabric & hugs my body in the wrong areas
2.0,"This bikini has a bad design. The two boob pieces are separate and also runs small. I bought a M and I have an average chest size C and it didn’t cover. There’s NO SUPPORT. Bought it for a pool party but returning it because in order to keep the 2 triangle pieces covering your boobs, you have to tie the straps around your body super tight and there would still be a good chance an accident might happen and the top fully fall apart"
2.0,The quality was not very good but because it was so cheap I'm not sending it back for a refund. It also gets loose while wearing it so I have to tighten it every now & then.
2.0,Received two different sizes in the package need to arrange for return
2.0,Such cute boots but the tab on the back is black and yellow! Photo shows just a black tab when I purchased. Totally ruins the look of the boot.
2.0,"Way too big, and fabric is kind of sleazy. Doesn't wash well, either."
2.0,"Over all the fit of the was fine.<br />However, I am returning this Thumb-hole shirt.<br /> I was so excited to get my First Thumb-hole shirt. The thumbholes a sewn into the seem, where the pinky is located.????<br />Did I miss the point of the Thumb hole? I looked at the once my friend has, and hers Thumb-holes are all on the correct side, where they are supposed to be located, in front of the thumb."
2.0,The zipper was getting caught in the lace
2.0,"Cute and warm, but touch part not working very well. I have to take them off to use my phone half the time."
2.0,The magnet is not that strong so it loosens easily with movement. Also catches easily on clothing which is really annoying. Like the look but not as functional as other bands.
2.0,"Bows are cute and garner compliments, but many have a band that is a different color than the bow, which makes them look cheap."
2.0,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift. I am bummed out that the size tag was cut off. Why? Otherwise it looks good enough to gift. The lack of the tag makes me need to do something to be able to present as a “new” top, which it is “supposed” to be. The cut tag takes away from its appearance as. New top."
2.0,Do not look like they do in the picture.
2.0,I have a big head and a big face and this mask was far too small. Does not cover my whole face nor does it comfortably cover my face. The string is sharp and digs into the back of your ears I highly recommend you look elsewhere if you have a big head!
2.0,"Two of the anklets are too small, and I have tiny ankles; one of them is supposed to be adjustable but the rings weren't placed on the right side to do that; the final two are just beads on elastic, so it's tight but workable... Get what you pay for?"
2.0,The fabric would work best as a cloth shower curtain. Not good for a dress.
2.0,"I got these for workouts.  They're too thin for that purpose, but I figured they'd be okay as leggings.  I've laundered them once (soft water, cold wash, tumble dry normal heat) and they seemed to lose some of their stretchiness.  Nice wide waistband, though."
2.0,"Cute mask, just wish there wasnt serious communication issues with the seller."
2.0,"These are not as long as pictured, they stretch just past my wrists - and I have child-sized wrists/arms.  They are more like a thin sock material.  Not as cozy as I'd hoped."
2.0,This Casio watch cannot be read during the dark hours as only 1 light works. I have bought this type<br />Of watch for the last 10 years with no problem.<br /><br />It seems that Amazon may be getting lower quality product than Walmart......
2.0,"Fits most carry on size standards. Pretty cheesy. The wheels are wobbly so I don't expect them to last long. They also came very scuffed. The package was not damaged so it wasn't a shipping problem, just poor quality in general."
2.0,"Really cute ... looks very vintage and by that I mean used. The shoe pocket by the zipper came out of the box ripped. There was bleach spots on the bag. Would not recommend. It's a shame, it's really cute!"
2.0,"I have them on an end table by my chair so they will be handy for me to reach in order to continue working on them.  I have tried for a week to get them open so I can insert them.  If they are this difficult to open in front of me and using both hands, I think they would be impossible to open or close if I am ever able to get them in."
2.0,They seem great. I'd had been happy if I'd gotten the complete set. 2 sets the heart & the purple were only 1 earring of each set.
2.0,"I was so excited about these. But upon receiving them and opening the packaging and pulling them out, what do I find? BLACK INK SPOTS ALL OVER MY LEGGINGS. (I did try them on any way and they do fit wonderfully. Ugh. I really REALLY like these leggings but I am not fond of these ink spots all over them."
2.0,"This is a great belt!<br />UPDATE....this started out to be a great belt but broke on me.  The buckle snapped off while I was at work, it was the reversible part of the buckle that caused it to snap off."
2.0,The shoes are very cheaply made and the faux leather looks awful.
2.0,Can barely see the GiGi letters disappointed
2.0,My daughter just tried this on for the first time and the zipper for the jacket is broken and won’t zip at all. I’m very upset.
2.0,"Not good for anti covid-19. See CDC guidelines and recently released mask effectiveness studies. These style of masks are the worst.<br /><br />Also, the was extremely tight. It will crush your nose."
2.0,"Pins look great.  However, the end of the pin is pointy and snags and pulls on the sweater.  Tip should've been more rounded so it wouldn't harm your garment and go through easily."
2.0,"They look great, but they have a pretty strong chemical smell, especially when they are worn for a while. I wore them twice, then they ripped both at the belt line and at the seam at the bottom."
2.0,I personally don’t like the way the earrings look in person. But I have no issues with the seller.
2.0,Way too small. My 8 year sleeps in this.
2.0,"At first I really like the item out of box, but then I noticed that one of the stones was not set up properly, which basically degraded a quality of this item and its appearance . Returning the product."
2.0,"Size was ok, but ride too low in the back! Gives u  plummers crack."
2.0,Cute sandal but very uncomfortable. The shoe has a raised area for the arch of your foot but the placement of this support is off creating a very uncomfortable fit.
2.0,"This dress has no linen in it, it is a cotton/ramie blend. These are natural fibers but it should not be listed as linen. The fit was a bit small for me, I’m a 12P and the XL was a little too small in the bust and underbust. There are no belt loops, so if you don’t like the belt it would look good without them."
2.0,Very tiny. Should be marketed as children's jewelry. .
2.0,"Wasn’t able to wear dress for the event I purchased it for.  Put dress on and zipper was stuck, got it up all the way then the zipper busted.  Made cheap."
2.0,This was way too large for my belly button so it didn't look good at all.
2.0,Uncomfortable fabric<br />Very baggy and loose fit<br />Not flattering at all
2.0,"They are cute and seem comparable to crocs but I ordered a toddler size 8 so my toddler would have room to grow into them since she’s a toddler size 7, but these things are massive! They easily look like they could fit a 5-7 year old not a 2.5 year old. So I’m returning. I won’t order again just because I don’t think a toddler size 7 will fit either they will be huge. Sizing is off."
2.0,Dress is too tight.  Runs really small. Ad says buy 1 size bigger but it should say get it 2 sizes bigger. Not happy with the purchase.
2.0,"they are cheap gloves, not great for bad weather"
2.0,"I purchased these earrings for my daughter in hopes she wouldn't be able to lose them or take them out! After, only 3 days, I noticed she only had one in her ear! I really liked how pretty these earrings were and the screw on back! Also, I liked how they were the perfect size for a little girl! I Thought because of the thread she wouldn't lose or be able to remove them. I am disappointed because I had hopes that these would actually work!"
2.0,"I have wanted this mask for the longest time. I got it for Christmas and I was sooo disappointed in the quality of the print. The mask is standard with adjustable ears and interchangeable filter inserts, which is nice. However, the smile that I wanted so badly was lackluster. It took away from my joy immensely. See photo. My camera makes it look better than it actually looks."
2.0,Too small. Not one size fits all.
2.0,My 8 yr old can’t keep them on his ears and they do not adjust.
2.0,XXL Size not true fit.
2.0,"I am very disappointed!  all, and exactly all the bags came with the glued handle and when I open them they tear!"
2.0,"Material is very thin and hard,  doesn't conform very well to the body, even after weeks of wear.<br />I do like the buckle and the loop that is used to hold the tongue in place"
2.0,"Good price, but mirror film rubs off quickly & causes spotty vision."
2.0,"Too tight, murder on the forearms.  I thought Unisex might indicate a larger size but NOPE.  Also the fabric is kind of itchy."
2.0,Did not like this product. Was not what I was expected. Did not fit the glasses and the inside was not smooth. The product could damage your glasses.
2.0,"Much to small to even get my foot into, company was great to work with concerning my problem."
2.0,"Well I wanted to love this but IMO, looks too bright. Very different than a real diamond. That being said, for what it is, it's pretty. I just didn't love it like I thought I would."
2.0,"Not a flattering dress on me, I am 5'2 and this dress does.not hit me in the right spot. It just looks like a circus tent on me."
2.0,Too big and too heavy for me.
2.0,"Beware, sizes run very, very small.  Other than that, a nice colorful fabric."
2.0,2nd time I bought a 3pack this set is smaller less material not as comfortable and wouldn’t buy again
2.0,it has no support for your chest and bottoms are way too small
2.0,"I liked the colors on this a lot. But this sweater was way smaller than I was expecting. The sleeves were short, the length overall was short, it wasn't oversized like the description stated. The material was also a little rough."
2.0,"I loved a similar version to my old Fitbit watch so I decided to try this for my new Luxe. It's just OK. The band folds over and is held by a magnet to the folded band. I struggled to keep it in place and anything would loosen the band. It wasn't awful, just annoying. I decided to go with a more classic and traditional link/ fold clasp band instead and I'm much happier that I did."
2.0,"I loved the band but it made me break out into a rash within 2 days. It was very pretty, so if you dont have sensitive skin, I'd say go for it.  But I can not wear it."
2.0,I was disappointed.
2.0,"I want to keep this watch. It looks really nice, open heart looks great and moon/sun phase and 24hrs complication works great. BBBBut after wearing it for a week I notice it is losing a whole 5 mins+ every day. I can forgive one min but 5 mins is just really extreme.  I would wear it for half a day and notice its 3 mins out.  QA is just terrible.<br />I will be returning mines"
2.0,Only received the women pajamas. Did not receive the mens pajamas.<br />Not happy.
2.0,The color was very nice. I did not realize it was a hard case. Wanted something to put in my purse. Way to big and hard. It does not zip easily. Is not divided. Not pleased.
2.0,"Fit ok, but cheap material that looked super cheap."
2.0,"I loved this bag at first, only traveled twice with it. And suddenly the letters popped off and my bad has holes where the letters used to pierce the pleather. I would love to give this 5 stars, but how can i if the letters fall off and you are left with a scarred bag after two uses."
2.0,"I recieved ring yesterday. It's definately not what I expected. I thought the ring would be alittle bigger but it's not. It's thin, stones are tiny, not as green as I'd thought it'd be. Overall style is cute tho. For me, looks like I'm trying to dress my bloated finger w a skimpy ring. Sizing is correct. Cute, but giving away; my niece will like it. For the price, one shouldn't have high expectations. Personally, I'm not recommending."
2.0,"The hat looks really cheap! The blue is much darker than the picture shows, the vinyl is super thin, and the shape of the hat is all wrong... When you put it on it looks all puffy and the front part ""stands up"" high and wrinkly."
2.0,I order these dresses in every color and multiple sizes (XL and XXL) the XXL was smaller than the XL which makes 0 sense and the dresses did not fit my height professionally which was the point of the purchase
2.0,Glitter was rubbed off in certain areas.  It came dented because the plastic was so thin.
2.0,Size doesn’t match description
2.0,Shirt did not fit arm length
2.0,These were ordered for my wife who wears a ladies size 9 shoe.  The size 8-11 product was to small for her foot..  Returned.
2.0,"No. Too thin, weak material."
2.0,could be a little bit larger .
2.0,"Material is soft and this could be a comfortable bra. Sadly, I ordered based on sizing guides and it doesn't fit around the front well. Plenty of room under the front to lose one of the girls if I lift my arms and cup size is too small for these c-cups. Typically wear a 40C."
2.0,Beautiful and lovely but the sizes run very very small. Requested a refund and NO RESPONSE. What a waste of money. True to the Asian markets. Penny pinching and greedy.
2.0,Larger than I wanted and square<br />Just ok
2.0,"This suit is really cute but, unfortunately, the lining is really bad. It might just be me, but it felt SO gross, especially once I got hot and sweaty. Almost suffocating, like it trapped the heat and sweat, and not breathable at all. And itchy, too. Wore it once and won't wear it again."
2.0,One of their worst styles yet. Patterns good but the sock itself is horrible. I like the &#34;space-dye&#34; pattern better. They fit great and the inside doesn't feel stringy and it also has arch support. Not these socks though.
2.0,"Nice mask, good quality. My son loves it but came damaged!"
2.0,Smelled like cheap rubber. Calves very large.<br />Didn't like at all.
2.0,These were very hard for my 4 1/2 year old granddaughter to put on.  She live the design but did not want them because the were not easy to put on!
2.0,"It run small and if that wasn't the case,  I still wouldn't like it.  The fabric is funky.  It's cut way too low (doesn't look like the picture) and the patch pocket is practically in the armpit."
2.0,The nose pieces on these break very easily. It includes two extra but it’s not even close to enough for how easy it breaks.
2.0,"The glasses look exactly as ordered, however, I did not realize the lenses are plastic and slightly distorted, giving me a headache when I wear them. I cannot wear them all day for computer work as I had hoped."
2.0,Shirt is huge and wide don’t fit like I was hoping. It runs big. Fabric is light and comfortable though. Shipping was quick. I got an xl cause that’s what I normally wear and it’s soo big.
2.0,Purchased for my son-in-law and the flaps slide down only to cover the very top of ears.  Hat appears to be very small and even on my daughter's head it looks to small for her and she has a small head.<br />Really disappointed and read verified reviews hoping the product was as stated.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0718Z7RNS/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
2.0,Again sizing isn't the same. Was too small.
2.0,The product looked ok but it has only been a couple weeks and it has broken. It’s not expensive but you would think it would last longer than a couple weeks.
2.0,RUN SMALL
2.0,"Itchy fabric , in flattering fit"
2.0,Large size not meant for size 14-16 kids that shirt fit more my son that is size 10-12. Disappointed.
2.0,"The pendant does not look like this. The colors are meshed together and there are no defined lines like, what I think, agate should look like."
2.0,"The sweater came in on time but it’s more of a light olive green…definitely NOT the dark green shown in the photo. Super bummed about that but other than the color being nit right, the sweater is nice. It came super wrinkly so you’ll have to put it in the dryer or iron it ti get out the wrinkles."
2.0,"Super cute! BUT it has a stain on it when I received it so I had to return it. Also, the belt hung a little off because there are no loops to keep it in place. I was disappointed it wasn’t clean and ready for wear when I received the dress because I loved it."
2.0,The watch looks really nice. But the glass of the face came right off. They must have used cheap or not enough glue on the inside rim because it just fell off. Luckily it didn't break. Not surprised considering the price. I'll probably just super glue it back on.
2.0,"They don't stretch at all, and im only 5'3 weighing 115 lbs, come right above my ankle and they are pretty damn small.<br />got a small tear in the thigh in them when gently trying to get them on. I don't expect them to last very long :/<br />super cute. but not worth the $12."
2.0,Was nice but i couldn't fit it.
2.0,Cheap plastic. Broke after a few days of use.<br />The good news is that Amazon provided a refund. Thank you Amazon!<br /><br />I will purchase a different item.
2.0,"The product is fine, but it is literally a plastic buckle, some elastic, and a whole lotta hype about something that likely costed less than $5.00 USD to produce."
2.0,The compass was bigger then expected and chain wasn't as long as I was hoping. Took a long time to deliver.
2.0,Nice glasses! Unfortunately they broke after two wears!
2.0,Very thin fabric. Would not wear in public although Perfect fit For in home workouts
2.0,"Polka dots don’t line up on seam on front of dress and there’s a hole in a pocket. Asides from that, it had potential. Oh well."
2.0,I like the style but it's super thin material
2.0,The Ankle bracelet was too small for my ankle. It was also very cheap looking. The clasp is only a hook. I don't recommend this to anyone looking for a quality item.
2.0,"They are cute however my daughter that is 4 years old and very petite loved these and after only wearing them maybe 5 times the bottoms of one fell off.! She babies her shoes, only have owned them for 3 weeks."
2.0,"I’m 5’3”, 105lbs and I bought the 2 in the pink with lace detail. It fits perfectly and tucks nicely into my skirts. It’s not too long that I can’t wear it with pants. Sort of cheaply lined but still very nice.<br /><br />update: came with some speck stains on it that i didn’t notice till i tried to wear it. if i can’t get them out i’ll have to return it. very disappointed because the blouse is so beautiful<br /><br />update 2: returned because the stains did not come out. they were very small but i’m not keeping a product with even a small defect. looks like drops of ink"
2.0,I had to ship it back it was way to small the arms were super tight and I couldn’t even get my arms in.
2.0,Too large for my little camera. Made for something much larger.
2.0,I am 5'4 and it was A little too long in the back compared to the front.
2.0,Quality of fabric is poor.
2.0,"UPDATE:  Revised to 3 stars because the blaster holster attachment buckle is sewn on backwards. There is no way to attach this to the belt without twisting the straps because of this error.<br />Instead of paying 4X this price for the official Jedi belt from D*sn*y, I decided that I'm the kind of Jedi who would definitely carry a blaster as well as a lightsaber. For the price, this is a pretty amazing belt!  IT IS A COSTUME BELT, if you think you're buying something that will stand up to daily wear then you are a very confused person. But the straps and buckles are sturdy.  Putting it together was a bit of a chore (no instructions), but it works once you figure it out.  There are little loops and pouches here and there on the belt which will be nice once I find something to shove in there. I am 36"" waist, 6'0"", about 200#, and this fit me just fine."
2.0,"its nice but it does not shine as it does in the picture, a very average bead. Better stick to pandora if you want a wow factor"
2.0,"The chain is the best part of this.<br /><br />Otherwise, the clear design is barely glued in and fell out upon opening. I had to reglue, which fine whatever. The circle pendant is also larger than shown, and doesn't fit  within the crescent shape. Instead, it sort of hangs down and overlaps the bottom point of the moon.<br /><br />But it was $3. And took six weeks to show up, so not worth returning."
2.0,Only in use for 5 months and the zipper has broken. Beautiful bag but hardware is not quality
2.0,Ordered pink..  not what the picture looks like.  It’s definitely more pink than I was expecting.  Have to go out and buy a true light pink shirt for a wedding this weekend...  was hoping Amazon had my back on this one but the product doesn’t match the picture.  Little right for a large and fit more like a medium.
2.0,"I have had this band for ~5 weeks and the band is starting to rip out from where it connects to the device. I wear my Fitbit daily and workout, but nothing so strenuous that it should be ripping. I would not purchase this band if you’re doing anything more than walking with it on."
2.0,Nice top but it is too small
2.0,The sweater is not as thick as I was hoping. Sweater is thin and light but disappointed that it looks like the sweater was meant to be thicker.
2.0,Material was cheap looking
2.0,"I returned this product it was not at all anything bad with the dress but the dress was made very cheaply and its was not what I expected it to feel like. It seemed very costume like not like a real dress I would want to wear out, especially for the purpose I bought it for"
2.0,"I wore them 1 time and they scuffed so easily that I cannot wear them anymore. I really loved them, I am so disappointed 😞"
2.0,"Very small, the description does not fit the size."
2.0,"Received in a timely matter, the beads are a great quality but as the picture shows the pair, I only received of the pieces also, its made to fit any size In assuming but I am a size 6 and its a little too long from the toe loop to the ankle."
2.0,The fitting with the hand part and pitchfork part weren't right so it was super loose and the pitchfork kept falling off. It was super cute though.
2.0,Definitely does not look like the picture. It's very boxy and looked like a tarp on me.
2.0,The quality is very poor ... in my case le lower part of the glasses doesn't really work .
2.0,These worked well at first.  I've had them less than 3 months and the elastic waistband is completely stretched out in one pair and the second pair is on it's way.  The pants no longer stay up and fall right off.  The rest of the pants are fine and the print is cute but I wouldn't have purchased knowing the waistband wouldn't last.
2.0,the beads are pink. not red like the photo.
2.0,"These pants were way too tight around the calves and too baggy around the butt. The hole for the button was also so small I couldn't get the button through it :/ had to send these back. They were cute though, just didn't fit my body type well."
2.0,Very little support in the footbed.  Tried on and the elastic cord broke when trying to adjust for fit.
2.0,This bootie is super cute but the bottom of the heal on the left one just came loose tonight after only wearing them about 6 times. I have the same ones in black I've had for months with no issues.
2.0,"I've come to learn, as a long time amazoner, that plus size doesn't really mean PLUS. I'm a pretty heavy-set woman I wear and XL size t-shirt and size 20 jeans and this shirt doesn't fit the way the picture shows, at least not for me. It's not NEARLY long enough. The narrow part towards the bottom of the shirt, doesn't go to my hips, it stops around my bottom roll, excuse my choice of words. Big girls will know what I'm talking about. I was looking for a shirt that would hide my muffin top but still be comfortable. If this shirt came in a 5X it might be properly sized for me."
2.0,Lights stop sinking in a week and start blinking uncontrollably. Some had to drain battery before putting them back on. Now they just black boots... no crazy uncontrollable blinking light.
2.0,"This swimsuit is very pretty and I absolutely loved the color.  With that said, the material is really flimpsy and lacks shape.  The boob area doesn't give at all so if you are large breasted, prepare for them to be smooshed and falling all over the place.  I think that supportive cups would work better with this swimsuit.  If you are smaller chested and don't need the support, this suit should work out fine."
2.0,Very flimsy and doesn't confirm to your head very well. Just a very cheaply made item.
2.0,Cute jumper but not much stretch
2.0,Very cute! But it's too short when I lift my arms up my butt hangs out..
2.0,Previous reviews said true to size but a little large and to order a size smaller..  I am usually XL I ordered a L and I should have ordered my normal size
2.0,"Too big - as in too wide for my head. (my hat/helmet size is 6 & 7/8, so yes, I have a small head)  They also slid down my nose and not just because the whole frame was bent when it arrived.  (Box was not damaged at all). The nose pieces are metal as are the inside frames of the lenses, which can feel quite hot on your skin, if glasses have been sitting in the car or sun, prior to donning.  Too bad - I thought they looked nice."
2.0,This is so weirdly shaped and fits super weird. I don't like it.
2.0,"The ring arrived with the stone separate from the setting .  I’m assuming the prongs were loose . Had it arrived  undamaged , it would have been pretty , but the stone was larger than I expected .  It would be helpful if all jewelry was shown on a human model for perspective ."
2.0,Not very big which the picture does not indicate
2.0,"This particular bra smashes my breasts down very uncomfortably, but the band width is the correct size. So sizing up wouldn’t help. I am a 34 large B to small C. I have  saline implants so the sizing is a bit irregular. Implants are heavy & I needed a bra to sleep in that didn’t squeeze me. This one didn’t do the job. Also- there is ZERO lift or support."
2.0,"Cute & stylish, but uncomfortable<br />After wearing for a while, band started peeling, didn't last long at all"
2.0,"While the fit was perfect, this is a very low quality dress. I wore it for a few hours and the threads started coming out."
2.0,more convenient to put on thumb but it doesn't stay on like turbo tape. I think I'll continue using the turbo tape unless<br />there is something else better.
2.0,"Wedge sole is much too hard, making it hazardous on smooth surfaces, especially when wet."
2.0,This dress was terrible.  The picture shows a slightly flowing dress.  This dress was a HUGE bundle of Disney princess-like puff.  Returned it.
2.0,One size does not fit all. Way to large for a pinhead like me but real good quality and looks good after some redesign.
2.0,Pretty but not good quality.  The elastic is fraying after wearing it maybe at most 5 times 🙁
2.0,Did not fit quite nice
2.0,I guess when you see &#34;Slim Fit&#34; and order an XXL you should expect a problem with size. I'd call it a Medium. Too inexpensive to bother returning to me. My bad anyway!
2.0,"A good quality snake chain is smooth and has a nice sheen (almost liquid like) with barely perceptible connections. These have a rough surface quality due, I believe, to less precise construction, and possibly because they’re not actually sterling silver. And I'm not convinced that the clasps are sterling silver. But..I'll keep them given the low price. A clear case of ""You get what you pay for."""
2.0,"T-shirt is very thin, almost see through, and could not be worn without a tank.  Sizing was accurate. Being sent back as she does not want to wear 2 shirts."
2.0,I said first that I Love it but after three days of use the the metal part to insert the strap is missing now. ☹️
2.0,Fabric is totally different from what is pictured online. The color is lighter too.
2.0,"Looks beautiful,  but sounds like plastic everytime you move. Clicking type sound. I wanted to love it, but just haven't brought myself to ever where it for more than five minutes."
2.0,"Not a great dress for busty ladies! The buttons across the bust make it tight and uncomfortable (a little quad boob action as well--not flattering!)<br />The shoulders and waist of the dress fit great (nice stretchy material that holds the shape very well!) and would have been great except for the chest area. Also, the collar of the dress is kind of big and poofy in the back (reminded me of the padded collars that Minnie Mouse wears) and I felt like it stuck up more than it should have.<br />The shape of the dress is great, the fit in the shoulders/arms/waist is great, but just not for someone with a larger chest due to the button front, and the collar was a little strange. I decided to return this dress in favor of keeping two others from the same company--if you like the look of this dress be sure to check out their other dresses as well!"
2.0,"First, this is an absolutely adorable kid's costume for any Wizard of Oz fan or little girl who doesn't want to dress like all the other little Disney princesses. Last year, my 6-year-old looked precious and received tons of compliments at her school's Halloween parade. The low rating is due to what happened at the end of Halloween. Despite wearing a long sleeve white shirt under the costume and tights, my daughter broke out in a rash all over her torso by nighttime and she begged to take the costume off. This was horrifying, as she is not prone to skin sensitivities. I blame the cheap, scratchy, harsh polyester material of the costume."
2.0,These are just too large and cheap looking.<br />Maybe for a child.  Sent these back as well.  Just not what I was looking for.
2.0,love the feel of the fabric and appears nice quality.  XL is more like small/med
2.0,Print is not the same! It looks as if they magnified and printed with less pixels. Print looks cheap. Material is good. The fit was great! And that is why I gave it 2 stars. I’m 5’5” 170 lbs. 36C bust. usually a medium or large. Ordered a medium and it’s roomy enough to wear lose or tie tighter. The print is terrible and nothing like the pic advertised. Looks cheap.
2.0,"So this past week has been a disappointment in online shopping as do many of the clothes I purchased have been quit ill fitting and this dress is one of them. I bought this dress in two sizes because my body is kind of an in between in terms of most sizes. I am 5'3&#34; and 227lbs and usually wear a 18 size pant. I have an apple shape so most of my weight is in my stomach. I got this dress in two sizes. First i got the dress in the largest size (xxl) and holy tornado was it huge. It looked like a sack on me. The length was good though and fit about 3 inches above my knee. The shape was horrible and looked like a giant square and it did nothing for my body but i kept the dress because i figured i would style it with a belt. I then went one size down because i really loved the lace detailing and it is a cute dress. When i got the xl it firt perfectly in shape but the length was ridiculously short. It fit more like a tunic shirt rather than a dress and i notice that the slip was londer than the lace on top of it. It seems as if the lace had shrunk somehow. I returned it because it was too short and with the slip being longer than the lace, it just looked weird.<br /><br />I don't know if i was just unlucky but this dress just did not work for me."
2.0,"Belt hooks pop apart, a pain to keep on your waist!"
2.0,"nice, but low quality..."
2.0,A lot of the plastic beads were broken and the picture was deceiving I thought it came with the plastic case.
2.0,"The fabric that this was printed on was not ur typical hoody, it looks similar to dry fit but it’s not even that, it’s cheap & my kid wouldn’t wear it"
2.0,Slips and slides once I got sweaty. Only worked really well for two days.
2.0,"I returned these for two reasons. First, the charging port is on the inside of the shoe near the ankle and gave my daughter blisters the first time she wore them.  It is in a horrible location and my daughter said they were extremely uncomfortable. The second reason is that because of the placement of the off/on switch they turn on/off while walking."
2.0,"Unfortunately, they have a weird design where they’ve stitched the legs together that makes them look like old man long johns. I’ll only let my kid wear them if she has a dress on over them because they look super weird. Plus they created weird fuzz balls on the butt and legs within 1 day of wearing them."
2.0,I really like this bracelet but it does not fit my charms and the part of the bracelet that supposed to attach to a charm broke off the bracelet
2.0,I liked the texture. But after one wash with cold water it clamps. And not fit on my body anymore
2.0,"Extremely small. Ordered a large, fits like small. Buttons are also too brassy"
2.0,I usually wear a medium and the small was huge. Way too big up top. The quality is also poor. Had to return.
2.0,"They are very cute and patterns where exactly as showed, however, they are see through. I really like them and am willing to find a short slip to wear underneath. You get what you pay for."
2.0,"The quilty of these are poor and they started to fall apart after the second wear. Oddly enough, the tongues ripped out. Now we use for outdoor play when we know they’ll get messy."
2.0,"Waaay to small, giving it to my daughter, she wears a size 0"
2.0,"I loved the color but this WAS NOT knit, it was a TSHIRT!  And I normally wear a xlarge so I choose not to order a l and it was not oversized either.  I kept it but am hesitant to buy another. I really needed a nice knit to wear to work. Sad"
2.0,It’s cheap. Bendy and will scratch you!!!
2.0,It's great material and looks great too. The problem I have is that I can't get it on. The neck part is so small I can't get it over my hips. It took two of us over 10 minutes to get it on me. Once it was on it fit and felt great. It doesn't make any sense why the top is only big enough for your head to fit through. I'll have to return it unfortunately.
2.0,Disliked how much it shed glitter everywhere
2.0,Too loose and way too long. Threads came out after first use.
2.0,Bought it for a gift. Bracelet broke after it was worn three times.
2.0,Much smaller than it appeared in the pictures.
2.0,Runs very small and tight
2.0,3XL fits like a large.
2.0,Very disappointed it the metal the letter is made out of. Letter was bent and now that it is bent back it still has spots that don't look polished.. Was for a Christmas present and waited a while. So upset. Don't believe it's truly sterling silver!
2.0,Order a size up. Not true to size.
2.0,The ugliest dress I've ever put on my body. I'm usually a medium in everything but in this dress the waist is HUGE and the arms are so tight it was practically cutting off circulation. Terrible dress that I fully intend to send back
2.0,"To big for me , looked like a doctors bag"
2.0,For the price not bad. However it is a bright dark yellow not the cream colored shown. It is clearly a second because there is flaws in the rose itself and visible glue on the piece. You get what you pay for but still it does not even look like close to the same shade of yellow which is upsetting.
2.0,Mine shredded around the thumb-hole on the first wearing but I am going to order another pair from a different company. I'm out in the sun a lot in 100+ degree heat and want to protect my arms and hands and not overheat in a long-sleeve shirt. I'm definitely cooler with these sleeves and a t-shirt.
2.0,"I ordered size Large, which is my size, but it was way too big.  Very baggy and sleeves down below my fingertips.  Returned it."
2.0,This just didn’t fit the way it looked in the picture. Quality was not great and it was really an awkward cut. Disappointed because it was for my daughter ☹️
2.0,"The waistband on this item is not black (like the picture shown), instead it is red. I don’t like the red, I wanted it to be black. The item is not as described or shown in pictures."
2.0,Not a very forgiving fabric...
2.0,"Had it on my keychain, at some point the bottom fell off along with the coil."
2.0,Looks better in the pictures.
2.0,Looks like a preschool necklace. Great for a young child with a phone.
2.0,Way too low cut. Feel like I’m open down to the waist.
2.0,My sister likes it?
2.0,The first one I received wasn't sealed properly and fogged under the crystal. The second one I received keeps terrible time. I returned both.  The watch looks great and I wished I could have a better experience with it. I think that the 1801.1 movement must suffer from inaccuracy.<br /><br />I will stay with Vostok for my watch of choice over Luch.
2.0,cute but I had to return them. the arch was too high and hard for me... hurt my feet and knees. I tried three different ones from this brand and still couldn't wear any.
2.0,"This top is very soft, stretchy, and comfy, but it attracts lint and pet hair worse than any other shirt I have ever owned. The design, and construction are well done, and the color is great. Maybe I shouldn't have purchased black."
2.0,"I followed the sizing and the top portion is a bit funny fitting. I'm hoping a strapless bra will help because I absolutely love it but the sizing didn't work well. Probably should have went a size down. Would have been a 5 star rating if it wasn't for that. After all, the form and fit is everything in a corset."
2.0,Absolutely gorgeous belt. But they sent me the wrong size twice ! I had to return and was out $12 total !
2.0,Warm but the buttons & stuff weren't secured. and came off when I was trying to put the mask thing on.
2.0,"I have tried the Shefit bras in different sizes. My initial size, according to Shefit, was Luxe. Now, it should be 1 Luxe. I have tried everything from Luxe to 3 Luxe. The uniboob is not a flattering sight. The squish and uniboob in the Luxe was beyond horrible, and the band did not feel comfortable. The 1 Luxe and 2 Luxe was the same, except the straps and bands, on both, were amazing. The 3 Luxe gave me a uniboob look, even though the band would not tighten enough.<br />Speaking from the perspective of a seamstress, I think the cups are not deep enough for those of us (me in particular) with fuller bust. I would absolutely, buy this bra over and over again if they would/could fix the uniboob issue.  I don't think it's possible to have the same size bra fit an F cup as well as an H cup.<br />The zippered area just will not lie flat against my sternum, which creates a major problem. Southern heat is unforgiving, so you want as much separation between the ladies as possible. If you are anything above a G cup, are 50+ in age, and live in sweltering heat... If you don't care for the uniboob look, I would consider looking elsewhere- until they fix this issue. But, it is definitely a well made bra!"
2.0,Decent wallet. Id slot tore open along it's side and I'd can fall out.
2.0,"Arms are rather tight, can’t pull them up"
2.0,Hole in the center of the flower is too small for my nipple which creates pain after a day
2.0,I like the bag but i find it too small.
2.0,"My review is for this particular watch and overall ALL OF INVICTA WATCHES. I own 6 invicta watches and EVERY SINGLE ONE HAS HAD A PROBLEM. The main problem with all of them is their wrist bands, they simply SUCK. Every single one of them has a broken wrist band and i rarely use them, apart from that the one that i have with a durable wrist band which is a gun metal flame fusion crystal army black mother of pearl one gets humid all the time inside and has water evaporation in the inside which caused it to stop working. For the $300 to nearly #$1,000 i've paid for some, they're truly dissapointing, and as an ex fan of them they're def. not worth what you pay specially when you have to pay nearly $100-$200 to ship and get them fixed. STEP UP YOUR GAME INVICTA! Theres not much point in having a nice design that doesn't work or you can't wear!"
2.0,Odd shape didn't suit my face. Had to return them.
2.0,Too large for a baby
2.0,I had send them back to amazon already
2.0,"I ended up throwing it in the garbage. Nothing like TVP I'm used to from a whole foods cooperative. Looks identical to dry dog food, tastes about the same."
2.0,"The ring itself is beautiful but the stone isn’t polished - so the top surface is dull, (although the right side does appear polished and you can see a difference if you look closely).Photos don’t do it justice.<br /><br />Very disappointing."
2.0,Too big for the keepsake locket i was putting together
2.0,These would be fine for standard stilettos but do not work for other size heels.
2.0,washed and dried before trying on...not comfortable...should have tried it on first
2.0,"Was looking for grippy socks to wear to yoga since my feet get sweaty. After a couple classes, the little grippy dots are falling off.  They fit well and are comfortable but not worth it since the dots are falling off."
2.0,"Weirdest pocket placement on a garment I have ever experienced. The pockets hit at the chest, and you will need to size up! On me the pockets bring to much attention to my under chest. Wouldn't recommend this, the stitching and construction is clearance store quality, loose threads and bad stitching quality.<br /><br />Had high hopes for the design and style, looked really promising, but I was really let down. Definitely not what i expected."
2.0,"I am considering returning these belts.  The plastic buckle is cheap and will generally secure the nylon belt, and it is TSA friendly, but they will insist you remove your belt and place it in the bin to go through their x-ray machine.  The belt is cheaply melted and the band to hold the excessing belt after it goes through the buckle, is hard and does not match the colors of the belts.  You get what you paid for, cheap."
2.0,I couldn't get my 2 years old's hands into the glove.  We ended up with them halfway on during the Blizzard of 2016 so he was playing around like he had a flipper.  They look like they would stretch more with the adjustable band.  They don't.
2.0,The connection made from stretchy strong that goes over the wrist was way too tight for my 11 ye old granddaughters wrist. She insisted on wearing it anyhow and literally cut off her circulation! I had too take it from her😔 too late for return so in the garbage it goes.
2.0,I recommended this leotard for a group of girls in a production I am costuming.  I was very disappointed when I started to get complaints that these were not lined in the back at all and are very see through.
2.0,Broke off of my chain first day I wore it put it bk on broke again
2.0,Color changed dramatically
2.0,Socks are very small and tight. Very cute and colorful. Made for very small feet and ankles.
2.0,This coat was not true to size. I ordered a 2x and it fit like a large. I don't wear a 2x but I ordered that size for more room and it was still to small. The coat is very nice and I really liked it but I had to give it away because of the fit.
2.0,"I appreciate the pockets and the fit, but these are super thin. You'll be able to see your underwear if you bend over, and honestly I don't expect them to last even a year before they develop holes. You can get much, much better quality shorts for $19 (the current price for these shorts on Amazon)"
2.0,"Strangely this bra is both too small and too large at the same time.<br /><br />The bra arrived and when I took it out of the package I immediately noticed the scratchy feel of the fabric.<br /><br /> I typically wear either a 36B or C depending on how the bra is made.<br /><br />The band was too small but the cups were way too big. The seller did include an extender so I probably could've worn that and adjusted the band size but with the fabric and cup issue, I didnt bother. The straps on this bra are nice and wide though so that was a plus.<br /><br />Overall, I dont think this bra is worth the price. Even if it did fit, the quality of the material just isn't there."
2.0,"Don't like the dress, the dress is not what I expected the fabric, not what I expected.<br />The pattern is not a good pattern on the dress.<br />The fabric is not an African fabric to me."
2.0,The leotard is on the small side. It just fits but will not for long. I ordered the child small (4 - 6x) for my child who wears XS (4/5). There is a stain on the front of the leotard - about the size of a pea. It will not come out. Not pleased - will not purchase from this seller again due to this.
2.0,"Honestly this looks nice. However, there aren't enough holes to tighten it for a smaller wrist. It slips around on my wrist when working out, don't purchase if you wear your Samsung watch for fitness tracking. If wearing for something like work or to a nice dinner this will work well. Again,meant for a larger wrist."
2.0,This swimsuit was cute and for as expected. But the bottoms had the seam ripped out of the back. Low quality.
2.0,"Quality is not good.  Too big , shapeless fit."
2.0,"Too small around waist, but large up top. I sent it back for a refund. I was disappointed because it is a pretty blouse."
2.0,"Entire watch and band are too small, the pic on the wrist is not accurate for a man. The leather band is a size 20, I can only use the first hole and my wrist is not large. It is an attractive watch as pictured but you need a magnifier to set and see the dates. The band is also too narrow, made more for a woman. The retail value of this I would place at $7.50 comparatively. The dial does not show Japanese movement, only made in China on the shipping box. The replacement battery code is a std SR626W but it will take a watch tool to remove the cover."
2.0,"After being worn twice that's 2 times, the insoles are loose from the bed. They are coming up on both shoes.<br />They are 1 year old.<br />I'm wondering what happen to them. Any suggestions????"
2.0,"It's a good hat, & I don't mind the stick on printing. (It seems durable enough to last until Trump is in prison). However, the important message doesn't stand out well at all. Most people don't even seem to notice. I should have paid more for one that displays the message more proudly."
2.0,This is a child's size at best. The material is cheap and the colors are harsher then it appears online.
2.0,odd shaped.
2.0,Doesn’t last as long as the other Lotus and Luna bracelets I have. This one didn’t even last 4 months before breaking.
2.0,They came broke one was missing a chain length I fixed them and removed the chain off the other one I'm keeping them but could have got the same sort of earings from anywhere and at walmart for 3.00 when they mark them down. So I wasn't impressed. I would not recommend them but if someone asks where I got them I will tell them.
2.0,"I ordered this bracelet with a gift card from my kids for Mother's Day.  Eleven days later, I received it.  Apparently, it was sent to a carrier facility near my home, then for some reason, it was sent to a different state (hence the 11 days it took to get here!). Not the seller's fault as it was shipped by Amazon.  Anyway, here are my thoughts:<br /><br />Pro's:<br />Bangle part of the bracelet is quite sturdy even though it looks thin in the picture.<br />It is a very shiny silver, not too bulky and just what I was looking for.<br /><br />Con's:<br />Beware the clasp.  This is where the bangle part and the 2 hearts attach.  It's opening is too large and it fell off my wrist twice within the first hour I wore it.  Good thing I was in the house so it didn't get lost.<br />For the price, I would have expected slightly better quality as the 2 intertwined hearts are not made as sturdy as the rest of the bracelet...can be bent quite easily.  I could have purchased this on the beach from a street vendor for much less.<br /><br />Solution to clasp problem:  I make jewelry for a living so I have lots of tools to repair/adjust delicate jewelry.  If you have a small pair of flat nose pliers at home, take them and wrap a soft cloth around the inside of the pliers (to keep from scratching the metal)and apply light pressure to the clasp to tighten/make slightly smaller, so that when it catches onto the 2 hearts portion of the clasp it won't come apart and fall off of your wrist.  Be careful not to close the clasp too much otherwise you won't be able to attach the two parts together.  Even after you make the adjustment, you may need help putting the bracelet on or off or you can use a &#34;bracelet buddy&#34; (can be found here on Amazon for a fair price).  If you use one of these, you won't need help from someone else to attach the bracelet.  I adjusted mine just slightly and it does not fall off my wrist anymore :)<br /><br />Overall, I like the bracelet but I do wish it was made sturdier.  I am worried that the 2 hearts will get bent and eventually break.  I would not re-purchase this again nor would I give it as a gift.  Hope this helps!"
2.0,I wanted the jersey feel not nylon
2.0,Cute dress but very tight in the thigh area and big in the chest/abdomen.
2.0,Order my regular size S and I am swimming in this shirt. It has a lot of extra fabric around the armpits which is not flattering. So disappointed that I need to send every piece from this collection back because it is all sized wayyyyy too large.
2.0,"The tine on the buckle is too short, rendering the whole thing useless and non functional."
2.0,Cute but two small
2.0,Cheaply made and not warm at all
2.0,"Not worth $30. First of all, this shipped from China so it may take a couple of weeks to get to you, and returning it is impractical should you wish to do so. The frame is very thin, about 1/2 inch. Mine arrived broken on one side so it won't lie flat against the wall. The canvas is not stretched very well over the frame, so it bags a bit. So it doesn't look so bad, I may unstable it from its current frame and try to remount it over a 1 inch frame, but that's going to be additional money out of my pocket."
2.0,The band is quite tight and my head isn't very big
2.0,"I was looking for a snuggly sweatshirt so my husband ordered me this as a gift. The description says sweatshirt, but it's not even close. It's a thin, almost shiny material. Returned."
2.0,I like the style but the fabric was thinner than expected for a fall dress.
2.0,"It didn't fit,it was to small."
2.0,This broke after having it for like 2 weeks...I really liked it I never wore it in the shower or when I was sleeping but it unraveled and beads went everywhere.
2.0,This product is not as big as it seems. The chains at the bottom are not metal and are much shorter. The chains do not lay flat and are a bit awkward. Looks better without the chains but that defeats the purpose.
2.0,This item is too bulky.
2.0,Cute earring for my teenager. BUT...post broke after 1 month of gentle wear. Sad.
2.0,Shipping for this product is great and so is the packaging. It came in a small elegant dark blue box. The only problem with this product was that I was only delivered the black chain without the locket heart.
2.0,"Great print, soft material, horrible fit..small in other workout gear fits me lower than needed but this one is way too tight in the front. Do not recommend."
2.0,The black belt is elastic the tan belt is not. This would have been 5 stars if both belts were made like the black elastic belt. The tan belt is garbage.
2.0,Don't like and wont waste my time sending it back. May fit someone who has no curves. Cheap looking
2.0,I was very excited to get these for my wedding. They even came in a nice box. I was very disappointed when three pearls fell off just removing them from the box. I didn't need them to last forever but I didn't even get to wear them yet... :( I might try to hot glue them back on.
2.0,The band is very uncomfortable and pinches my arm. Not what I expected.
2.0,This T shirt was a 2 dollar shirt with an iron on patch on it that cost 16.00. The T shirt was thin and very small for a 3t. I found a big brother shirt at a local store for more than half the price!!
2.0,"I read the reviews on this item before purchasing and ordered one size larger than I normally wear. It is very small and uncomfortable, sadly. It is a beautiful set, though."
2.0,Not the material I expected and not as big as it looks
2.0,Bought two. Quality and fit was fine. One of the two robes was stained in several places
2.0,Nice product but too small for me.  I Normally wear a large but these were just too tight.
2.0,"If you plan to wear this under a helmet (I wear it for ice hockey), then forget about it because the band is so thick it won't fit. The thick band barely fits under my helmet. Yes, you can adjust the helmet but the thickness of the band still creates a pressure point between your head and helmet making it exceptionally uncomfortable and painful to wear. In other words, I find it useless. Other than that fairly important problem, it is a quality item."
2.0,"You cannot get these sandals wet! Very delicate for something supposed to be made for children :( I wish it was more durable. Broke after only a few wears. Maybe good for a special occasion where you won't be very active, but definitely not for daily wear, even for someone who is not very rough on shoes."
2.0,"I ordered these joggers on April 28th. Didn't receive them until June 3rd after amazon said my package ""may be lost."" After attempting to contact the seller twice and just being told sorry, we hope they arrive, I was about to contact Amazon directly when they showed up.<br /><br />Now that I have them, I ordered a size 2XL because I wanted them to be big on me. They are mainly for running errands and things I don't want to be dressed up for. They barely fit. I am 5'8"" and 185. And a XL normally fits just fine. But these are uncomfortably tight at a 2XL. Sadly, this will likely be a wash since the company doesn't seem to want to deal with customers. I'll still wear them, as long as I can lose a couple lbs."
2.0,Way to poofy and long
2.0,"These studs don't screw in securely. Where as most 16 gage studs stop spinning in once fully screwed in; these just keep spinning. It's like they're stripped. I bought 2 sets of four, and they're all like this. They're cute and all, but I know they WILL fall out eventually. :("
2.0,Wheels were bent/didn't spin and the last chain link broke off while on my keyring
2.0,Cats face sits lower than pictured online. Not as obvious as I had hoped. But still cute.
2.0,Sizing is always off for these tops.
2.0,"Really short handle.  There were not any choices about handle size, so I assumed I'd get a shoulder carry bag as in the picture.  If you're okay carrying 20 pounds of groceries by hand, you'll be fine with this.  It's useless to me."
2.0,"I wanted to love these. They are very lightweight, which I thought would be great for summer. The problem is the fabric snags incredibly easily. There were also a bunch of loose threads that I had to trim."
2.0,"The material feels cheap and I had to return the order 3 times because the size wasn't as advertised, I started at large but that felt more like small or medium. After returning it the 3rd time I just gave up and looked elsewhere."
2.0,I loved the way this fit. Unfortunately one of the straps broke the first time I wore it. Luckily I was at home.
2.0,"Very pretty, but once I opened the clasp it wouldn't close back"
2.0,"I am a normal Size 16 but I am 5’9”.  I purchased the XL based on their size chart and find it large enough around the bust  but the bodice is not long enough to adequately cover the bust; the waist hits me in the middle of my bust not under it as pictured.  From the shoulder to the high waist measures 15 inches. I compare this to several of my other dresses that are the exact same style. All of them measure 17 to 18 inches from the shoulder to the high  waistline. Also, they have elastic either sewed into the waist line or into a pocket at the waistline; this one uses that ¼” clear plastic stretch ribbon. Unfortunately, that does not hold the waistline in place. There is no tie closure as listed in description which would help secure the waistline.  There was a problem with quality control. See pics. There was a hole in the waistline and the bodice center front was not caught in the seam which would eventually come loose even more. In summary, it appears this dress is miss-labeled. On the plus side, the fabric is quality,  the bodice is lined, the price is fair,  and it is long enough for my height. It is most likely a Petite, Junior or maternity. I rarely write reviews as I find my opinion already recorded. In this case I didn’t want someone to be disappointed as I was. I will be returning the dress."
2.0,"It doesn't really look like this however, it is fitting for the purpose. Also the material used can be better. I just hope a thread is not pulled out suddenly"
2.0,I wanted to use this at work. Not loud enough
2.0,"... cute color but the material/fabric is no as expected or as the pictures show.<br />The top is extremely short. I order size XXL.  If you left your arms, your belly will be showing .<br />I returned it"
2.0,Did not like the material at all. Had to literally pull the material open where it was stuck to the decal. Very thin. 5”5 160lbs and lg fir fine almost to big through the shoulders so my bra strap kept showing
2.0,"good product but not what I wanted once it got here.  Description is vague and the bags are small and not square as picture shows. not the shopping bag i wanted.  returned product, waiting on refund."
2.0,I wore this to an event. It was great until I saw the pictures. Maybe I didn't tighten the waist enough but it made me look very wide. It was a strange illusion.
2.0,Way too high waisted - to the point that it almost would cover a sports bra
2.0,"I provided a side by side comparison with another brand (purple) so you can more easily see the problems with these shorts (white)<br />1. The bottom hem is too short and tight so it creates a bulge and a very unflattering booty shape and makes cellulite appear more pronounced<br />2. The pockets are sewn toward the back closer to the glutes instead of directly on the side, kind of awkward<br />3. The white is more of a cream color and won’t match any of your white sports bras<br />4. They didn’t stay put even for a second and starting to creep up awkwardly immediately after trying on<br /><br />I’m obviously not a super thin model with no cellulite but I am pretty lean and generally wear a size 3-5 in jeans and purchased a size small in these shorts. It’s SO difficult to find flattering shorts for us thick thigh ladies, even if you are lean like me. The purple shorts are from 90 Degrees by reflex if y’all are interested in trying those, which are much better imo, but still less than ideal."
2.0,Chain too thin and clasp too small<br />Stone appears to be a piece of plastic<br />Disappointed
2.0,wear large Ordered extra large it was too small
2.0,"It’s exactly what I wanted. . . but in orange, not yellow."
2.0,"I ordered a womens size 6 and received a 5.5.-6 , its definitely not a 6 because its almost and inch short of fitting in my boot"
2.0,Great shades but dont last long metal irritated my skin... indent have sensitive skin!
2.0,Very cute you but runs small!
2.0,"Looks great, but battery was dead"
2.0,This is so cute!!  But broke after one day. :(
2.0,I bought these for a daith piercing. These are a bit big for that but they're still doable. I actually thought they were pretty cute so I still sported mine. My piercing was pretty sore for a while which I attributed to just being larger than what I'm used to. It wasn't until I got out of the shower and took it off to clean it that I realized the jewelry had turned green as did my piercing. I cleaned it with a q tip and a bunch of nasty stuff came out. I haven't had an allergy to fake steel earrings since I was a kid (at least 30 years ago) so this was a surprise to me. These would have been a 5 star if the metal was actually decent quality. These are a yes for cute but a no if you have or have had any sort of sensitivity.
2.0,What was I thinking???????????
2.0,"I like the sunglasses design a lot and they work well with my face. However, just know they are NOT polarized. This item has plain plastic lenses with 400 UV protection but they are definitely NOT polarized as they claim to be."
2.0,The bows with jewels immediately fell off which is what made them unique . The cloth is good material and fit is good.
2.0,Shirt quality was normal but the ink/ washed away to 25% of it's original appearance after one wash. Losing 75% in a single wash is saddening but further it did so unevenly. Now it's just a shop rag.
2.0,Price right. Cheap
2.0,This does not work for large women’s shoes. I wear a size 11.5 and my shoe shrunk a half size. The shoe stretcher does not expand long enough to help make my shoes any larger. Disappointing. There should be some indication in the product description on what sizes to expect this to work with.
2.0,Material was different then expected. I’m 5’3 and wasn’t long enough.
2.0,"The money is very difficult to put into this safe. It doesn't matter how the money is folded!"""
2.0,"The product photo shows a deep burgandy red, but in reality this is more of a bright, orangey red.  It's not the best option with my coloring, so I was disappointed.  However, even if the color had been right, I don't think I would have kept this one.  The material is odd, very thick and stretchy, almost like neoprene, and the ruffles are sloppily done - there are big obvious seams all the edges that just make it look unfinished and cheap!<br /><br />On the plus side jumpsuit did fit well - I ordered a small, and I am 5'3"", 130lbs, 29"" waist, and 34D bust.  If you are like me and have a bit of a tummy, I'd recommend shapewear since it is well fitted through the midsection."
2.0,"It may be full grain leather from some sort of animal. They left out the word &#34;bonded&#34; when they claimed it is is leather. This thing is as stiff as a plastic ruler. If what you want is a cheap belt that appears real, this is the one for you. I think the stitching is maybe genuine but it's not clear what it is stitching together since this is one artfully colored chunk of something."
2.0,Its cute and easy to out in but it broke out my ear!
2.0,"love the design. after one wash the design started fading, would not recommend"
2.0,"I love this simple yet beautiful ring. I have had it for only 6 days and one of the stones fell out. Of course wearing this ring everyday and everywhere I have no clue where the stone could have went, so there is no chance of putting it back in."
2.0,Nice but disappointingly there was a large tear in it upon arrival
2.0,This dress is worth about $3.00. I was disappointed in the quality. The dress is made as a 1 size fits all type. No shape and the material is very scratchy and wrinkled. I would not recommend buying this dress.
2.0,Can still be seen in the standard flat...I will continue searching.
2.0,"Straps dig in and it gives you a uni-boob,, no cute and not comfy ☹️"
2.0,"The 12-pack of assorted verses were actually only 4 verses which I received 3 of each, I wish it was actually 12 different verses."
2.0,I ordered a LARGE based on another similar garment I own and the Chauder  one was way to small. It felt like I was in a straight jacket. I returned it immediately.  Will not order A CHAUDER PRODUCT AGAIN.
2.0,"Waist and length were fine on Small. I'm 5'1"" 123 lbs and 34B. The slit literally went up to my underwear. I didn't mind that so much but it was really annoying that the description reads ""wrap dress"" when it's not a wrap dress at all. It criss crosses at the bust but there's no ""wrap"" going on. Instead, the bust is wide open and a bit warped which means it's not fitted on the bodice at all. Unless you have 32D's and don't mind having them out a little, this dress does not flatter a smaller size. I'm returning it.<br />Also, not sure why they call it polka dot when it's in fact ditsy flower."
2.0,The dress is not cut for a busty woman and the fit not flattering.  Cute for a more slender and taller person than I am at 5'3 145lbs. size was XL.
2.0,"This dress is super awkward. I ordered a large based on others reviews. The armholes are for someone with extremely thin arms because mine got stuck. I'm in pretty decent shape, and it just fit horrible. Also, i am 5'4 and just because i ordered a large, doesnt mean the dress should drag on the floor! I gave the dress to my coworker who is about 5'9 and a little thinner than I and it fit her beautifully. Beautiful dress, but proceed with caution."
2.0,"One of the earring posts arrived bent, and these earrings are definitely pink, not red. You can see when pictured next to a true red one. Still cute, but not what was advertised."
2.0,Very cute design but AWFUL elastic on the bottom of the jersey.  The elastic is very tight so it creeps up to my waist (annoying!) making it useless as a cycling jersey to cover your backside and/or carry things in the back pockets.  Not worth returning to China. It went in the Goodwill bag.
2.0,Great design but the sizing is terrible.  Barely fits my 8 year old who had a small head.  Would probably work best on a child aged 5-6.
2.0,These are cheap. They tore as soon as I put them on an earring.
2.0,Wish they offered this in the XXL. Too small.
2.0,Nice but.. smells horrible? These boots smell like skunk like REEEEK and I can't get the smell out for my life! I've sprayed them with everything and my entire room smells like skunk now and I just got the package yesterday :(<br />Considering returning but they're so cute..just extremely smelly rubber or something.. will try to wash them ig.
2.0,The color is way lighter than shown on the website.
2.0,"The tiger design is covered in sparkly rhinestone things, although you can't tell from the photo online and its not written in the description. It looks like a comfy and high quality shirt but giving 2 stars for the inaccurate advertising. Will return as  I don't think my nephew will wear something sparkly."
2.0,"Love the style - throwback to my college days, sort of.  The material is thin.  The fabric equivalent of balsa wood.  Thought it would tear in half just putting it on.  Entirely translucent - like give to your girlfriend see-through (with proviso she not be larger than a B).  Finally the waist was fine, but the arms and chest could not accommodate an athletic (not weightlifter) build.  This is a 'Slim Fit' item in my opinion."
2.0,Pretty but wrinkles a lot.  Can wear for an hour or 2 and then take it off.  Will keep but you get what you pay for.
2.0,"Serious dollar store vibes. The pendant looks nothing like the picture and the necklace itself looks cheap.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I don't expect an inexpensive item to look posh. Let me put it like this: It's the below the cheap look of other cheap necklaces.<br /><br />Unless you can get the photographer with the necklace, I'd pass."
2.0,Little small cheaply made
2.0,Had to return. Ran super small. Especially in the arms.<br />Bummer as it was really pretty in person
2.0,"Big up top, small on the bottom"
2.0,I bought this as a gift for my 13 year old son. The size was a bit small and he did not like how the material puckers around the buttons. He said it looks like a girl's shirt. I have to agree.
2.0,These caps were not that great.  They were cheap and got the job done for Halloween.
2.0,The plastic cracks after awhile.
2.0,Very cheaply made. Material is super thin
2.0,"While I love the ring, I am unable to wear it. After wearing it for about 2 weeks, I discovered that it was burning my finger. I'm not sure if it's the type of material it's made of, but I received a chemical burn after wearing it."
2.0,Put it on and it broke within 3 days.  Just made me sick. It is a pretty piece. Very disappointed that it broke that easily. Tried to fix hopefully it will stay
2.0,I dislike that there's still sun coming thru it like little holes which defeats the whole face coverage
2.0,Junk but I wear it once a year. Glad I waited and got it for 53% off. Sounded like a plush well made garment.
2.0,"Nice but too small, not true to size"
2.0,"I like the product and its quality; however, it started unthreading after second use only.<br />🙊🙊"
2.0,This bag is really small...Not what I would call a women's shoulder bag.  Nice bag for a young girl (5-9 years old) I am also disappointed that the bag is not lined.
2.0,"I received a solid black pair of pants, not like the picture which is what I wanted. Also very thin."
2.0,Cheap looking but I guess you get what you pay for!
2.0,"...except for Alfani’s use of these cheesy looking stainless steel (?) zippers. They may be stronger than a matching fabric, burgundy, zipper, but than partially hide it at least. Thankfully this zipper is in the back, unlike some Alfani blouses I’ve mistakenly purchased online. Overall, very pretty. Material looks nice- almost like chiffon, polyester chiffon rather than the expensive version. Goes from daytime to evening very easily."
2.0,Love the purses look and size but only after a few months the handle tore from the purse.  Disappointed because it really is pretty.
2.0,They bend too easily
2.0,Fits comfortably but very flimsy it ripped the after one use not worth the price
2.0,The color was a lot more pink in color than I wanted... looks like a top for a little girl.
2.0,"The dress came in about 3 weeks, and it’s pretty and well made.  I ordered from Amazon knowing I could return it to kohls if it didn’t work out.  No go!  Received a return slip for “self ship” back to China where it was made, would need to fill out a customs form to go with it.  Be certain this is the dress you want before purchasing...and if anyone is in the market for a pink size 2, let me know!"
2.0,VERY THIN MATERIAL!
2.0,"The fabric is really thin, which means it needs something underneath and the seams are easy to see."
2.0,They are extremely soft but very thin.  Too small if you have big calf’s and have a booty and hips.  Also because of the thinness after 1 wearing a hole in pants.  The 2 stars are for the softness - if they were only made to accommodate a “full figure”
2.0,Haven’t even washed it yet and it’s pulling. Terrible quality.
2.0,"Soft and comfortable to lay around the house with, but I wouldn't go out in public with it on. It runs big and makes you look larger due to the boxy style."
2.0,The neck too wide!
2.0,"It's not a warm material but rather a thin silky shirt. Seems like it might be handmade? Stitching looks professional but there's no tags or info on the hoodie. My son typically wears a 7/8 or medium, this fits around but is super long. The sleeves are way too long. He loves it and it works for warmer says but I wouldn't buy it again."
2.0,(These are not 95% cotton.)
2.0,To big !!
2.0,Cute but only go about 2/3 up on my leg and they don’t stay up. Definitely not knee high. I’ve purchased other compression stockings online without issues. I don’t know if all the nurse mates brands are short or I just received a botched pair.
2.0,"Very cheaply made (obviously.) Constantly gets caught in hair. Not protective at all, but they are cute if you're just going to take selfies indoors."
2.0,Very cute skirt<br />Fit really good<br />Size up I’m usually a medium and ordered a large<br />Was very comfortable but noisy<br />When I moved or walked it made a swooshing noise
2.0,This necklace might looks nice on a big person.  It is too big and bulky (the anchor and the cord) for my taste.
2.0,"This might be a highly uncommon thing to say but they caused me to ""see designs"" as I closed my eyes at night. Like lava lamp designs in my eyes (when they were closed)... so, I wore it all day and it was great at reducing the pain of sunlight. I liked how you got the benefit of wearing sunglasses without the darkness of the lenses so you could still see clearly and wear them indoors... but when I went to bed and closed my eyes I saw moving lava lamp designs in my eyes... what is that? I let my mom test them out and the same happened to her... It prevented me from getting peaceful sleep so I immediately returned them. They're not for me. The phenomenon went away after like 10 days."
2.0,"Already broken, one day in. Bracelet might better fit a larger adult, was much too big for my 11 yr old. Very pretty for the short time she tried to wear it."
2.0,"I like asymmetrical hemlines but, this is ridiculous! Too short!"
2.0,"I bought these straps to use for my small digital camera. However, although I loved the colors, these wrist straps were tiny. Like made for a child's hands tiny. I was so disappointed, as I loved the idea of having the different colors and being able to change them. But I could not even get my hand through the opening, which made them totally unusable for me. Maybe I missed the sizing in the description, but I was under the impression they were of a standard adult size. I'll be more careful in the future. Luckily, they weren't too expensive."
2.0,I don’t feel like they are true to size so they were too tight to even wear.
2.0,Material is too thin.  One pair ripped the first time I wore them.  I won't buy again.
2.0,"So disappointed -- color is very orange-y brown. If you overlook the color, it is a very cute bag. Love the style, just not happy with my new adoreable ORANGE bag. I've included a picture of the bag on top of a chocolate brown sweater, so you can get an idea."
2.0,Doesn't snap
2.0,Cheaply made and very evident. A bedsheet would provide better protection.
2.0,"The inside material feels like plastic, very cheaply made."
2.0,"I purchased these in January for a March vacation in Mexico, worn twice. Then a few times over the summer in northern Indiana. The fade on the front area above the knee is amazing. Amazingly awful.<br /><br />The fit is great and the zippered pocket is great for stashing a camera or wallet.<br /><br />I’d not recommend or buy them again. One season and they’re spent."
2.0,I was expecting better quality but you get what you pay for sometimes.  These would be better as party favors or just for fun for young girls.
2.0,Very small and shrunk up in length
2.0,Fabric is cheap! I don’t recommend.
2.0,"Flimsy ......I love the lens shape / size and goldish tint, but one of the temple arms broke at the earpiece......... ;("
2.0,Did not help with night driving for my husband. Helped very slightly with glare and did not help with rainy conditions.
2.0,Cheap looking. The wings have a brushed &#34;jewel&#34; look to it.<br />The &#34;gold&#34; isn't really gold and looks tacky. I haven't worn these and probably won't.
2.0,This blazer looks like the photo when you receive it. But the buttons are more on the side than the front and the front lapels aren't big enough to make it look like a blazer. It's more of a throw over than a blazer
2.0,Cross is bigger than expected. Feels cheap.
2.0,"Very very hard to see through. Very strong chemical smell. Had to let it air out for a few days before I could even put it on. Even then, I could only wear it for a few minutes at a time due to strong chemical smell. Only saving grace was that it was hilarious watching my mother wear it and chase my children around the house."
2.0,Cute top but it was quite small so I had to return.  Definitely go up one or two sizes on this.
2.0,It definitely fits way too small so go a size up from your regular size smh .. outfit is really cute though
2.0,They fit how I expected but the fabric feel on these was absolutely terrible.
2.0,While the lens is nice it most definitely is not close to the original for Oakley Elmont. I was disappointed that it is clearer and not as dark and mirrored as the original lens. Again the lens quality is good but if you are looking for as close a match to the original this is not it
2.0,"I had really high hopes because of the reviews, and if the material was a little more flexible I probably would have loved it, but it's a little too stiff for my taste. I bought the right size, but it's just not comfortable for me"
2.0,They're cute... I however don't recommend. I'm 5'2. FIVE FOOT TWO INCHES! how in the heck is a medium a foot too short!? Really disappointed
2.0,The arms are way too tight. I never receive things that have such very tight sleeves.
2.0,"I used the Storus Fitness Wallet on a recent international trip rather than carrying my normal wallet in a pocket. I was in a relatively safe area but it was nice to not have to worry about being pick-pocketed or asked for money as I didn't appear to be carrying anything other than my phone. I kept the wallet inside my shorts or jeans clipped to my belt, but an interior clip retainer kept getting caught on my clothing. On the last day of our trip when I tried to remove the wallet the clip snapped. The wallet still functioned to hold my cards/ID/etc., however the primary reason for the purchase no longer applied. I'm including a photo of the broken clip and at this point, I might as well carry my normal slim sleeve wallet in a pocket. I also ran into the same issue when clipping the product to my belt directly so anyone purchasing should take care when removing the wallet from their person. This may be an additional security measure, but it ultimately resulted in a broken product. Gave 2-stars as the price is low enough to not be a nuisance and the wallet served me well for the week I was traveling; if I'd been gone for another week it would be 1-star."
2.0,I have always got size 36B but these were to small!
2.0,Bought a 2x and they were very tight.
2.0,The design is very cute but the gears are extremely flimsy and the eye pieces would not stay in place. I was constantly adjusting the attachments and eventually just put them on my hat for the evening. I would like to see this design with better quality attachments.
2.0,"These are sold as driving gloves but they are too slippery to hold the steering wheel. The touch screen feature does work so they are OK to use with your phone outside, but they should NOT be used for driving"
2.0,"Its a $40 dollar homage to the Omega Seamaster. On looks alone its actually pretty decent. Hopefully I got a 1-off but crown had 2 pull out points.. set date/set time... however the date would change regardless where you had the crown pulled out to. Another interesting fact, the dial says ""Seamaster"" but the back cover has ""speedmaster"" etched into it. The strap is actually decent with vibrant orange rubber inside and an ok feeling nylon on the outside. Caution: not for small wrists(anything less than 7.25"" and it will simply be too loose). Note: the orange marking on the bezel is MUCH darker than the orange on the strap making for an awkward mismatch<br />of colors. And the ""helium release valve"" is just for looks(this is a 10 meter ""water resistant"" watch, basically try not to get it wet.. which is a shame being a ""dive style"".) It's very light weight on the wrist and if you're strictly in it for the style.. go ahead and get it.. if you're planning on using this as your go-to ""beater"", it may not last very long."
2.0,"Too big for my taste, but I will incorporate into one of my art pieces."
2.0,Cloth was very thin. Can be used as inner layer.
2.0,"The dress is not what I expected although it looks similar to the dress in the pic the devil is in the detail. It is too long, made of a cheap fabric with tacky hem lines. If you have a snatched body that can pull anything of then go for it but you will still have to alter it for length or bust. For everyone else with average to full figured body types buyer beware."
2.0,"The Top is very cute however I ordered a IIx and I think it’s more of a medium, it is very very small. I’m very disappointed."
2.0,"Good look and we waited a few months until they fit my son. He wore this one as a trial run, but fabric is thin and doesn’t hold shape. Saggy and loose after washing. Fabric ripped away from waistband. Now I’m stuck with 11 more of the same since it’s outside of the 30 return window."
2.0,"The fabric is lovely and soft, but the color of the ""white"" shawl is so off-white as to appear pale yellow. I wish it were snowy white. My husband thinks it looks white, but not when placed beside something that is really white!<br />P. S.  I have decided to keep it because it is really quite elegant looking, and very soft and cozy feeling. It’s just not white, it’s cream, and now I still need to buy something white."
2.0,"Several have already fallen apart within the one month since Christmas. Daughter loves them, but they aren't going to be long lasting."
2.0,"I'm 5'7"" and 135 lbs, so not plus size, but I got these because my thighs are slightly on the thicker side and i wanted them to fit comfortably, but they were still very tight."
2.0,"The band was what I was hoping for; however when I went to put it on the watch, the small knob on the pin broke. I am returning it unfortunately."
2.0,"Order was for a 10pcs/lot keychain, only received 7. Now they aren't available."
2.0,"This dress was too short for my petite size daughter... Make sure to order atleast 2 sizes up<br />On positive size, this dress looked nice on its own"
2.0,Pretty but chain is very cheap!
2.0,So it’s super cute in color however comfort is definitely lacking. I tried sleeping with it on and it pulled my hair. It’s also causing the skin to be rubbed raw
2.0,This shirt is blue not black as it clearly states !! Black
2.0,"It said to order up a size, and I am usually a small so I ordered a medium. It was so incredibly tight and stiff I could barely get it over my head. When I finally got it on I don't know how I would have moved or breathed in it. There was no stretch whatsoever. If you really want this shirt then size way up, like 2 or 3 sizes and it should be okay. I gave it 2 stars because it is a cute design and the colors were vibrant, I just wish it fit properly."
2.0,"Edit: Here we are, 2 years later. I've been happy with the ring but I'm disappointed because one of the diamonds (CZ diamonds I guess) fell out. The ring doesnt look the same and I'm kind of sad about it since this is the ring I used to get married and the sentimental value has been damaged as it no longer looks good to be worn.<br /><br />So far so good.  It came when it was supposed to, it looks like the intro.  It is beautiful.  It's been almost 2 months and it's holding up through everything.  I'd recommend it"
2.0,"Got these for my daughter and she love love loved them, until the post broke. Probably wore them 5 times."
2.0,Product doesn't look like the photo. The heart is quite a bit thinner than the picture shows. I would have liked to have received the one in the picture. There is actually not a silver 925 stamp on it anywhere and I'm not exactly sure that the bracelet isn't actually silver or not but I'm truly not very impressed with the product that I've waited several weeks to receive.
2.0,Not at all a good fit.  I bought this for my wife and I know here size.  This when received was about 3 sizes to small.  Not at all happy.
2.0,"Separate from the fact that it didn't fit, the material is really thin and see through."
2.0,They weren’t true to size a little to big my feet slips and slides inside of them from time to time.
2.0,They look comfy but only work as an under shirt for layering. Not as a top shirt
2.0,"This product fits strangely due to how it is cut. Would not recommend to someone with a large bust. The material itself is very thin and cheap; not necessarily a bad thing, because the price itself is cheap. It is not scratchy. The front pockets are actually just flaps half-hazardly sewn on; they fly up when it's windy, and make the shirt look super cheap."
2.0,Bought for my wife. She wore it to parades and it dyed her skin green.
2.0,"I’ve been looking for some Silver hoop earrings .925 in this size for awhile & when I saw these on Amazon for a great price, I had to do a double take. I read the complete description very carefully & studied the photo. I also looked at the comparisons carefully before choosing these earrings. When I opened the pkg, and examined the earrings, my first thought was  “the piece that goes through the ear is large, flat & blade like”. I wear 4 earrings every day & I have for over 50 years, and I am very familiar with earring styles & metal content, etc. I wore these yesterday for the first time & the piece that goes through the piercing wore just as it appeared - “blade like”.  In just a short time, both of of my ear lobes were bright red & hurting, from the back & forth sawing motion of the blade-like in-ear lobe piercing piece. I had to remove them & put antibiotic ointment on both my ear piercing holes & take some Tylenol. I do not plan to try wearing them again."
2.0,did not fit at all.  sent it back the same day
2.0,Not great. Heel cane off soon after installing.
2.0,Very cute swimsuit. For a woman with a large butt this suit covered very well. The material was really think and I actually ended up not getting in the water because of it. If it had a liner it wouldve been better. The top was a long piece of fabric that provided a few different options for tying. It kept rolling up so on the beach or matched it with a bandu top. You may also want to hem your suit as it is just fabric.
2.0,"In the picture these look like they have a slight flare. Instead, they flared out 4-5 inches from my leg and looked like culottes. No thank you."
2.0,Not what I was expecting. These are really big and I thought they would be smaller by the ankle like the picture. Fabric is nice as is the color but the cut is not current or flattering.
2.0,Not what I expected. This swimsuit is a piece of fabric you have to make into a swimsuit top.
2.0,This dress did not fit right.  It just was not made right for a full figured woman.  I sent the dress back for a refund.
2.0,"I really liked the old Anne Klein shoes. The pointy toes don't work for me. The toe bed is way too narrow. The logo makes it hurt my feet. They are very pretty shoes, but I can't walk in them much. They will be donated. If I order them a size larger, my feet will slip out the back. I will stick with ordering Naturalizer shoes."
2.0,"They run too small. Not the best fit! I am returning them. If you would like a recommendation, I ordered Wandgo Men's workout shorts and they're  perfect."
2.0,"As soon as I opened these I knew they were going to be junk. They were ruined (holes in them) within only a few of uses. Granted, they were being used by a fairly destructive little boy (for tobogganing, snow ball fights, fort building and such). If you just want them for warmth while sitting around at something like a football game, they would likely be fine. They aren't tough enough for actual activity though."
2.0,.. I ordered XL and I swear it is a small... the fabric is very cheap looking.. the seams are not straight....  Arms are too tight for a boho shirt... I can not recommend anything about this shirt.
2.0,"Love the sweatshirt for the most part, but the collar this very strange.  Not sure how to describe it, except ""strange."""
2.0,"Just wasn't right. Cheap material, meh for the colors compared to the picture. Much smaller than the chart suggested."
2.0,Is does not match the photo
2.0,Not what I expected!  Looked like a bunch on strings!
2.0,"I ordered Khaki and got the &#34;light orange&#34; which is actually kind of an ugly peach. It's too bad because the sweater itself feels pretty nice. Soft and a nice weight, and I think it would be cute in a better color. I usually wear a medium, sometimes a small, and ordered a medium in this. The fit was good. Roomy, but it is a cozy sweater so that works."
2.0,The quality of the fabric was good enough for the price but the fit was way too large. I normally wear a size 8US and I ordered an extra small and the dress was still falling off my body. It gave no shape or flow. Sorry had to return it.
2.0,They are not the kind of leggings I like. They are more tights for under a dress. Also I wore one pair once and had a run in them the next day. And they are pretty see through.
2.0,If I would have know how flimsy it would be I would have looked at something else. I know you get what you pay for but for stainless steel I would have expected better.
2.0,"Dont stay on. There’s no ankle band to keep them on so I’m just constantly having to look for them and put them back on. However, they are cute."
2.0,"Overall, do not like these earrings. Gave 3 stars only because all were included as advertised. However, the gem studs came with a cheap thin silver-coloured backing plate, not the gold-tone ones on the picture. They hurt like hell after 5 minutes of wear. The solid color studs were not magnetic, rather they had the same thing plate likely glued in the underside as one of them dropped out when I was trying the earring on. The tasseled hoops have a spring closing and the hoops had a hinge closing. These latter two were the only ones that matched the advertised pics. Ironically I bought the set for the studs.<br />Don't but this set!!!<br />Can't even tell you to look elsewhere in amazon because I searched extensively and bought this one after seeing the pics of the gem studs with the thicker coloured backing plates. It's false advertising. Waste of my money."
2.0,"Fits well, nice color and texture until I washed it, terribly quality, you're better off spending $60 on a brand hoodie."
2.0,Not happy at all with it. It says on amazon when you order the ring it's sterling sliver but when I got my ring it was not stealing sliver and turned my finger green.
2.0,kind of uncomfortable and also the boob pads seem to fall apart in the wash
2.0,"This product was hard to adjust. To adjust the tension on the pedals was a great challenge, I had to buy several tools to get some adjustment.  In using this product I fell several times because I could not get my left foot out.  I suggest the tension screw be a proper hex screw because the ones on my peddles seem smooth."
2.0,"Quality is not good. It looks ok, but the black side already started to peel."
2.0,"This watch has a very small face and is annoying to set.  That said, it is cheap"
2.0,"Scarf is ok, but not as nice as I had expected. But is ok considering how cheap it priced."
2.0,"The sweater I received was different from the photo.  The ribbing around the vneck was much thinner than the photo.  It’s very nice quality, but different than pictured."
2.0,The legs tend to ride up
2.0,They are pretty put hard to get open and closed onto the ear.
2.0,The overalls piece fits good and is super cute. The floral shirt was way too small...
2.0,shirt is very clingy and tight.
2.0,"No breaks the chain links easily , not recommended ."
2.0,I like the look of the watch.  I had bought it for a present for someone so I have only just given it to them.  They inform me that the watch doesn't keep time.  He keeps resetting it and it works for ten minutes and then stops.  Help!!!!!<br /><br />regards Josephine
2.0,"This watch has a very nice appearance, but when you get down to it its really just a hunk of junk. It broke not even 1 month of me owning it and the fibers in the wristband started coming undone and are EXTREMELY sharp. It would often cut me every time I tried to wear it."
2.0,"Cheaply made product with pads that don’t offer much support, move apart and most importantly, it’s NOT flattering.<br /><br />Makes your boobs look like they’re sagging!?<br /><br />Fits kinda like a tube bikini top - not a bra.<br /><br />Do you think that’s comfy enough to wear all day!? I don’t!"
2.0,Kind of cheaply made. Flimsy and too large in calf.
2.0,I ordered medium coz I usually am a petite medium but this medium is too tight.
2.0,The strap<br />Is quite short
2.0,It’s a little large and the center seam is a little off putting but overall it’s cute.
2.0,They're no where near the same insole that come in red wing boots & they only last half as long as the original ones.
2.0,"I want to love these shoes because they’re very cute, and when I finally tried them on they fit well and seemed quite comfortable… but I can’t get past the fact that they arrived dirty.  They looked like they’d been worn for quite some time, dirty enough that they’d be in the “throw-out pile” if I had already owned them.  I’m guessing I received someone else’s return."
2.0,"In the photo, the fabric looks like soft heathery cotton but it's more rough and solid, with an off-color - more orangish than red. It's not baggy unless you buy a size or two up. It's also not as long as pictured. The model is wearing a completely different tank."
2.0,"My daughter used her gift card from her birthday to buy these socks.  We got them yesterday and as you can see the stripes do not line up around each one.  Each sock is this way, the quality is disappointing.  Also just to mention the material of the sock is more like a dress sock and not an athletic sock.  The sizing of these I believe also runs small.  Because of the quality we would not buy these again."
2.0,Get a size smaller if you want it to do it's job
2.0,"I measured my child's foot, followed the chart, and the size 1 shoe is the same size as my other child's size 11.  I will keep it for my younger child, but it is too small for kid for which I bought it."
2.0,I don’t like receiving anything wrinkled. Wish AMAZON and there distributors would find a different way to ship items. The jacket I got was too long in the sleeves and the stitches in the hem were crooked making the bottom pucker. I ended up doing quite a bit of work on the garment to make it presentable for my brother’s memorial service.
2.0,"I have a reaction to my plastic nose pads, so I bought these silicon pads. The bridge of my nose cleared up and they are comfortable. However, they are too big. They keep slipping off. If the company can make them a little smaller."
2.0,"I kept it because I didn't want to pay to ship it back. However, I do not wear this shirt. I am a size 16/18 and ordered the biggest size available. Uh, yeah, big nope! My mom, a size 8/10 wears this short now. I really wish the sizing had worked out because I love the print!"
2.0,Not white- it's very dingy and looks like it's been in a house with a smoker for years.  Other than that it's not bad looking.
2.0,"Gorgeous dress, but runs TINY. Size up 2; 1 is not enough!"
2.0,Came with corner bent and after weeks of holding it down with a weight it still wack a doo.
2.0,"I purchased one shirt that I loved and so I ordered another in a different color, but the same size. This one arrived and was at least 2 sizes smaller than the original one I bought. I cannot wear it and because it was shipped from China, it costs more to return it than I paid. I guess I will have to give it away. Too bad, I loved the first shirt so much, I would have ordered every color."
2.0,"I am a size 12-14 depending on maker......I orderd this dress in a Large. It fit like a bathing suit. I cannot imagine that even and xtra large would be helpful to me. The material is extremely clingy.....if you have the perfect body, this is for you!"
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:7c927435c9e20cd9b42b146708b7033b]] i did not expect this dress to look cute at all, when i clicked to order it, i just did it because i just want to try new dresses. i was soooo pleasantly surprised, it's actually cute on. very feminine and i love the cut, it is flattering. i wish it's a little shorter on me, but not mad about it.<br /><br />the material is thin, you will need a slip. material will get wrinkles after washing so be sure to take out before it fully dries and hang so that it dries wrinkle free -- especially the belt.<br />the design is just so nice, the only issue i have is the button gap between the bustline to the waistline, it tends to stay open, showing some of your bra and stomach, i think the distance is too far. if the buttons are closer together it might not be this bad, it's the only one the opens like that.<br /><br />the fabric is cool, definitely a summer dress.<br /><br />i am 5'2"", 36B, 160ish lbs, i usually wear a medium when the materials are stretchy but with this is sized up, i received a large and satisfied with the fit.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />after laundry, i couldn't fit into the dress. i took off 2 stars because of that. i can't close the bust area and the sleeves are super tight i can't even relax my arms down, i feel like i am getting my blood pressure taken because of how tight the arm hole is  now.<br /><br />the fix for this would probably be to get a couple of sizes up and and shrink it in the wash before wearing. because even if i got a Large, from the way this looks -- the gap in the bust area is like 6 inches --- i mean is shrank a LOT!"
2.0,"These will not fit you. Just keep moving. Waistband elastic barely expands and the fit through the hips is skin tight.  I'm 5'9&#34; and 150 lb, not a hippo."
2.0,"Out of all 3 pants, only the blue one fit me, the other 2 were too small..."
2.0,The seams came apart in at least one spot after one hike. Returned and got a better rated bag from the same brand.
2.0,"Am not too pleased with this item and it could be a little better in the design for a one size fits all and this item doesn't fit all.  The maker should of took into consideration in using black elastic and gave more room for it is really tight and puts a mark on your nose. So, this is not going to work for me but my girls."
2.0,TOO SMALL!  The size 5 fits like a size 3-4.
2.0,Muy bonito bello pero fragil. Solo ponerlo se partio
2.0,"This was very comfortable, I just ended up sending it back because I didn’t think the coloring complimented my skin tone. I love these dresses though because they are so flowy."
2.0,This product was extremely hard to get through both ends and threw my ear all at once. You can’t really see what you’re doing and it was extremely difficult once it’s in it’s great.<br />I really do enjoy these earrings which really does say a lot because I only wear a very small studs and these earrings are a larger earring for me but I really do love them
2.0,Frames were not sturdy at all.
2.0,Not a great material. Fit weird and not super stretchy. I feel as if they’ll bust open.
2.0,I liked the  shape of the briefs and they are very comfortable tp wear.
2.0,"I ordered it with specific intentions and realized it's not what I wanted, buyer's remorse."
2.0,These beads were ok but I accidentally spilled some water on my wrist and started seeing orange coloring on my wrist. Now the beads are faded and look very old. I haven't had them a full month and only wore them 3 times. I don't know if these were dyed or what but I wouldn't suggest wearing any light colored clothing because your clothes will be ruined.
2.0,Loive it!
2.0,For $23 dollar earrings I expected a little better quality then as if i bought them from walmart but I have to say I was a little disappointed opening them today when I recieved them to find one was already bent and not clasping right. As these are a birthday gift for my daughter I am disappointed.
2.0,It is stiff and its groves cut into your eyeball area.  Couldnt wear.
2.0,Not a fan.  I have an apple shape and this emphasized it rather than hiding it as I had hoped. Sent back
2.0,I was not a fan I bought this for my mom for my wedding and when it arrived it was just so cheaply made I was not impressed and it was smaller than expected. I will say their return policy is very good. I returned it and got my refund pretty quickly.
2.0,"Plastic, not metal (except for the chain).  Nice addition to the memorabilia collection, but not worth the price.  My son (it was a gift) says the pushing the button on the side to make noise is a bad idea as the noise goes on for a long time."
2.0,"These are cute socks, just not what I thought I was getting. The image and title both made it appear they would be crew socks, and they arrived as ankle socks. They will serve the purpose, as I don’t have time to return and order something else, but I’m a bit disappointed."
2.0,Odd fit. Small fit
2.0,"Fit's weird. I am 5'6, 125 lbs with an A cup. For some reason this rides up really weird and cuts my already small breasts in half horizontally. Looks cute and feels soft, but doesn't fit right."
2.0,"The material is not as good as expected, looks very cheap and feels very harsh."
2.0,"It's cute and has lots of space but it smells straight up like butt. I tried letting it air out, wiped it down with disinfectant wipes and even perfume. If you don't mind smelling booty every time you open your wallet then go ahead and get it but I just can't deal."
2.0,Too small- had to return
2.0,Had it two weeks and broke already
2.0,I didn't notice the material was see-thru until it arrived. Would make a nice swimsuit cover up!
2.0,"Product not as advertised, I wanted the watch in the crock leather and silver face. Instead I got the crock leather and a black face. The button that changes the time and date does not even look like the one in the picture. Too bad its too late to return it since its a christmas present."
2.0,"Despite using the sizing chart and still ordering one size up, the fit and shape of this blouse did not match the description. I'm 5'4&#34; and 115 lbs, and a large was uncomfortably small on me. Took over a month to deliver, and was so cheap, it was not even worth going through the refund process. I don't believe this was a great choice to buy."
2.0,"I will confess up front that this garment appears to be well made, but the two stars are reflective of the ridiculously inaccurate sizing. I ordered the X-Large and it came just barely below the breast. I realize it is supposed to be a crop top, but an X-large should fit someone who weighs 130 lbs and is only 5'4"". It doesn't. It looks ridiculous on - more like something that belongs on a 12 year old. It looks NOTHING like the photo when worn. To get one that fit like the one shown online, I would have needed something that was about a 3X.<br /><br />Too bad. If it had fit, it would have been a cute top to wear over a tank."
2.0,"It's absolutely gorgeous. HOWEVER, I have to reset the day of the week, the date, and the month sometimes because it is not keeping time properly.  I understand automatic watches and it is worn and moved constantly. Not only that- but it was dropped accidentally and that one drop broke the knob off that adjusts/sets the time telling hands.  I went to a watch repair place and was told it would cost nearly the price of a new watch to fix it.  Very sad.  I had wanted a wooden watch ever since I'd seen one a few years back."
2.0,Fabric is very stiff. Cute but not comfortable
2.0,"Very disappointed.  It's a beautiful ring but after wearing it only 2 times, two of the side stones have already come out."
2.0,Returned the pearls were a bluish color and the metal look pewter not silver
2.0,El paquete ofrecía una docena de bolsas y sólo trajo 11. Y yo estoy haciendo una fiesta para 12 niños! Ahora tengo un niño sin bolsa y no pienso comprar otra docena.<br />Las foto de la publicidad es engañosa. Las bolsas son pequeñas ! No son tamaño de cotillón estándar. En la foto parecen  bolsas más grandes de lo que son. Mi culpa fue no verificar las dimensiones en la info posterior.
2.0,Too small and had to return it.
2.0,"although the item delivered on time, the quality of the clothing is not good.<br />i've chosen the small size, it's still too big.<br />it's more like a pj when i tried it on.<br />impossible to wear this out."
2.0,This pattern in particular will make you look like you have permanent camel toe- great fabric and sizing just not a fan of this pattern
2.0,"It’s cute, however if you need a large, it runs small around the forearm, the stitching is super tight, and I don’t have big arms! If ur a medium, get a large!! Also, It’s a little snug around the tummy if you are a thicker girl!!"
2.0,Love the shirt but I should have listened to the reviews came with big holes in it.
2.0,"I got this to give my friend..it came without any backing, in the envelope and was bent and creased so bad, it wasn't salvageable.."
2.0,"One week after purchase, hem tore. Otherwise, comfortable gloves. Need to replace."
2.0,"Very Cute Purse, too bad the clips attaching the strap are plastic! A clip broke the 3rd time I carried the purse. I'm going to try and replace the clips; too much trouble to return. Nice size"
2.0,I really wanted to love these pants. I sized up and I am glad I did as they seem to run a bit small. The fabric is cheap and doesn't feel nice on the skin. The fabric is also very thin and see through. I found the fit to be very unflattering and I would definitely not wear them out in public.
2.0,"Turned out to be a pretty unattractive belt for my tastes, but it seems very well-made. Gave it to a friend who really liked it."
2.0,Didn't like the advertising because it's much smaller than I thought I was getting.
2.0,"I like this band. I have repaired my original band about 3 times using a silicone adhesive. It worked pretty well but was messy and unsightly. I was skeptical about this new band but it turned out to work perfectly. On disassembly of the old one, I noticed that the GPS antenna was stuck to the inside of the band and was hoping that I did not break connection. I easily pulled it off the old band and set it in place while putting on the new band. I would give this product a 4.5 but there isn't a half rating. It is a bit stiff and am hoping that it will loosen up over time. I will buy 2 more for the replacement Surges that Fitbit sent me :).<br />***********UPDATE************** 10/22/17<br />This band is good for a couple weeks. After that, I noticed that it starts to loosen and separating from the body when putting it on my wrist. I think the main problem is that the band itself is too stiff. The original band has more flexibility. You won't get much life out of these bands unless they find a way to make them more flexible. The band didn't break, is now slipping off the body even with the two screws in place. Maybe I can add some strong glue and put some heat to the band to make it softer."
2.0,"Interesting look but not practical. Runs half to full size smaller, and the toe box is strange. I have fairly narrow heels; if you have the same structure, your heel and ankle will be swimming and rubbing about. Additionally, while I understand the draw of flat soles, in this case, they weren't comfortable."
2.0,"Not so much a fan of these.  First off, the green in the picture was NOT the green I got.  What I got was more of an army green.  Also, the pins were very had to put in, and the whole look is bulky."
2.0,It was much smaller then expected
2.0,not a dress. it's a shirt and not a very well made one!
2.0,"Really like the earrings but they are very loose/don’t tighten and often fall out. Had to order a second pair because they would not tighten all the way. Same thing happened with the second pair and I lost an end. Didn’t last a month. Otherwise, they look great, if only they stayed together."
2.0,This product didn't take very long to start falling apart. Not even two weeks the side pockets start falling apart. And there isn't a seamstress alive to fix this bag. This bag continues to fall apart and I do nothing to this bag for it to fall apart
2.0,"Entirely too small. The bottoms are as big in the front as they are in the back. The top did not hold up, let alone cover my chest.<br />5'3&#34; 145lbs 34DD. Chest 34 waist 28 hips 30"
2.0,"I really wanted to keep these, but they were too short and paper thin. Color is really cute though."
2.0,The back has elastic and it as gapping.
2.0,The coat is beautiful and warm the only down side is the zipper broke after the third use.
2.0,"Beautifully made and just gorgeous. But without a back zipper, it was so hard to get on and off.  I tried the top part and then said forget it!!! It has a side zip but it was just impossible to get on unless you are stick thin without curves.  With a back zipper, it would have been my favorite costume!"
2.0,"My usual size is 38C  (Maidenform) and after reading reviews that this bra ran small, I ordered the 40 A/B. The thicker back was awkward and hard to get on and I didn't even fill out the cups on the top. Back it goes!"
2.0,I usually wear a medium but my measurements went with the small and the description says to order a size smaller than what you wear. Quality seemed to be good and a little stretchy but when I got my jumpsuit it was too small. If it would have fit I'm sure I would have loved it.
2.0,The waist band is very comfortable. Thats where the good stops. There is a large seam that runs right up the backside. Its not even flat stitched. It gives you a permenant wedgie. The legs bunch up almost instantly
2.0,Soft material but too hard to breathe.  I was pulling it down to breathe.
2.0,cute but it was too small and I ordered one size up
2.0,"Cheaper looking then I was hoping for, I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,Very HARRY POTTER sized glasses.  Too large so I had to return.
2.0,Love the jacket but it took way too long to get here
2.0,I'm returning it for an exchange...
2.0,"Pants looked nice and fit well, but my son wore them only once and came home with two holes in the knees after just one day of regular wear - not even falling."
2.0,"Gave it 2 stars for the design of the chest- I'm returning. I ordered the blue in small. It was very tight in the chest. I am a 34B, 5'1"" and 137 lbs. The stitching that separates the chest area from the bottom flowy area, did not sit under my chest. It was almost above my chest- not how it should fit. No zipper or buttons (wasn't needed- easy to slip on), material is comfy and soft. Length is good, too!"
2.0,"The pants are laughable, the top is okay but the whole outfit was made from some cheap material that feels like rough paper on my skin. I was super disappointed because I was really looking forward to wearing this. It will be donated."
2.0,I don’t like the material and it is to big
2.0,"The picture shows that a lot can fit into this wrist purse, but that just isn't so. My glasses case and phone case takes up most of the space, there isn't room for more. The credit card slots are ok. I don't think I will be using this often because it feels awkward holding it. The wristlet is triangular in shape and made of a generic cardboard material. I believe it may start to rip and cracked over a short time. I really didn't want to write this review but you guys had to know before you decided to purchase."
2.0,These are NOT high waist as advertised. They do seem well constructed.
2.0,Looks great. Had it for a month and already there’s a huge hole in the front...
2.0,The hooks are very small and break easily
2.0,Looked nice until the buckle rubbed up against my work counter and the brown paint rubbed off.
2.0,LOOKS CHEAPand took over a month to recieve
2.0,It broke as soon as I tried to put one on
2.0,"Cons: Battery had to be replaced in just a couple of months. Reset button just stopped working so no way to change time when going to or from DST. Pins that hold the band on popped out.<br />Pros: fabric band is more comfortable for me than silicone, very thin so fits easily under cuffs, very easy to read, inexpensive"
2.0,Hat was to big
2.0,"My son gave my wife these earring for Christmas because she specifically wanted gold hoops that were at least 2 inches in diameter.  These are advertised as 60mm x 60mm, which is 2.37 inches. These are actually 1.25 inches in diameter/length.  Very disappointing and are being returned."
2.0,"This dress was VERY well made, but way too small. I ordered two sizes larger and it was still two sizes too small. I normally wear a US size 6 but I bought a size 10 and I couldn't get it on at all. Make SURE you order a few sizes above your normal size or you won't be able to fit this style. As you can see from my pics, a size 8 or 10 SHOULD have been more than enough material. Unfortunately, it wasn't."
2.0,"The quality of the cotton is somehow poor,while I was expecting a linen shirt, and the XL size for men fits an L for women."
2.0,I'm so bummed!!! When I got these pants and tried them on they fit and looked great very comfortable for a long work day! The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because after I washed them 1x the stitching began coming out!!! A round the waist I have holes now 😔 i was soo excited to order more until I noticed this now I don't want to waste money on anymore.
2.0,Fabric was not as expected.
2.0,The band has been working very well. My biggest issue is that the adapters are GREY! My watch is black along with actual band but it's all tied together with grey adapters........
2.0,I was so hoping this shirt would be perfect.  I love the embroidered flowers.  However the sleeves were too tight.  Sizing up was not an option as the shirt is VERY loose fitting around the middle.  If I sized up it would look like a tent.  Also the white material is SEE THROUGH which is a no go for me.  :(  Returning it and wishing so hard it had been different.
2.0,The fit of the stress is very awkward
2.0,It's really thin.  The clasp isn't well thought out.  It gets really dirty really quickly and then is smells like rust because it rusts!<br /><br />Then it fell out.  about two months after I bought it.<br /><br />Don't waster your money on this.  I want another one...to REPRESENT!!  ...but I know better now...
2.0,These compression socks run big. Order a size smaller than you would normally wear.
2.0,When they say mini...it's mini
2.0,loosing 1 or 2 minutes a day-not much use.
2.0,I didn't notice any difference. In fact they might have made it worse. But I guess they could be useful as shooting glasses.
2.0,"bad plastic lens, the view like oil on the streets..."
2.0,I purchased these to get rid of all my logo t shirts.  My only disappointment is they have shrunk alot and are now a size smaller.  I would not purchase again.
2.0,Zipper handle broke first time I used it
2.0,Too small.  It hurt my wrist.
2.0,One back strap broke..both crocs have holes at the bottom and terrible wear and tear on the too...not even 3 months into having this shoe!!! Waste of money!!
2.0,"I followed the sizing chart to the digit, but it’s not even remotely accurate."
2.0,It was really brown and not in not shape when it arrived.  Very thin and baf quality!
2.0,It is not true to size...I like it loose to wear over my uniform shirt. Needed a 1X instead of large. It is also bleeding blue fuzzies onto my white uniform shirt.
2.0,This dress was very thin and somewhat small.  I bought it for my daughter to wear to Hawaii but she did not like it and we sent it back.  My daughter wears a misses size 8.
2.0,"Band does not adjust larger and is too small, less than the 8"" noted."
2.0,Shoulder pads and wide short cut.  Cut out the shoulder pads overall disappointing
2.0,"I like the pattern, but the material is way too thin and its neckline fits awkwardly."
2.0,I did not like this at all. I am small and it hung on my shapelessly. I returned this!
2.0,I like the product but the buckle breaks within a short period of time.  I bought 2 more after it happened the first time and have gone through 3 of them in 4 months.  The company does not sell the buckle separately.  Wish the buckle was out of metal.
2.0,This is for massive hair do. Unless your doing the Selena bee hive this is to big
2.0,I was disappointed that metallic threads were woven in much to the socks.  I don't like the way the hard metallic threads feel on my skin.  Had to return.
2.0,Cheap quality compared to similar dresses on other sites
2.0,"I was glad to find a surgical steel nose bone in the rose gold color. Unfortunately it does NOT stay in my piercing. I wear 20G and that's what this is suppose to be but the ball end that keeps it from falling out is WAY too small for a nose bone. The gem is larger on my nose than I expected and feels loose/wobbly in the clasps. I would describe it as ""top heavy"".  If the post were shorter it probably wouldn't feel that way. I wanted this to work..the rose gold color is nice but it just falls right out and Ive never had a nose bone do that before. This MIGHT work for someone with a 22G or smaller hole. Certainly not worth the 10 bucks I paid for it since I can't wear it. 2 stars is for the surgical steel availability, fast shipping and nice color."
2.0,I bought this hat at Costco and liked the style and fit and the fact that it had high UV protection but I just noticed it was 44% paper.  I am returning<br />it now because of the paper content and the answered question said it is not to be washed.  The two things I would buy a hiking hat for are sun protection and rain protection.  I now feel this is a stupid hat.  Who would make a hat out of paper?
2.0,"I am 5'8. Ordered a size up and it was still way too short. Can't wear as a shirt, but unwearable as a dress. Would be flattering on a shorter body maybe, but the sizing should be made longer on larger sizes. Was disproportionately short. Fabric is soft, quality is okay."
2.0,"I like the style.  But looks strange on.  Maybe I am not the right shape for it.  It fitted perfectly, I am a size 14 but just looked odd.  Good quality"
2.0,way too big and the fit is frumpy
2.0,The shirt material was way too thin for my taste. I returned them.
2.0,"It's ok in the shoulders, but it's way too wide in the lower torso. I'd never wear it out in public. It will make you look fat if you're not already."
2.0,I am still looking for something that will hold me in and is seamless.  This offers no restriction at all.  Just a crotch-less underwear
2.0,"These were small. They would be fine on a kid, but anyone who has a small head will probably be fine."
2.0,"The necklace is so beautiful, but the rose quartz is too big for the string and chain, it felt twice and chain got broken."
2.0,"Liked the fabric and the styling, but one size was too big, and the next size down was too small.  The waist line in the back sat too high.  I don't think I would have like the &#34;look&#34; if I had tucked in the shirt."
2.0,"These lenses were ok for about a month, now they're peeling, poor quality"
2.0,"Quality isn't that great and it kept falling apart, Requested a refund."
2.0,"There are comfortable and durable, but if you are allergic to nickel, you will get a rash. It’s unfortunate that it happened after the return window closed. I can’t wear them and can’t return them."
2.0,This product was too much smaller than in the picture. It's a very pretty stud but you can barely  see it.
2.0,It comes with a little hole 😞
2.0,"Not sure if I got a bad set or what but these lenses have bad optic spots that mess with your eyes. Hard to describe but its like a bad spot in the lenses and totally messes with your eyes. Its like beer goggles if you focus on it.. The fit is great and I guess there polarized, hard to see the gas pump now. Going to put my scratched Oakley lenses back in"
2.0,This bracelet was too expensive. The dye is so dark that the beads look black. It's listed as lapis but you would never know by looking at it. I have blue bead bracelets that I will wear before these. Give them a pass.
2.0,"The pair came in random sizes - one is perfect size but the other is too small. Unfortunatley, I have two legs and I need them both covered."
2.0,I washed the item in cold water and hung to dry and could not put over my shoulders.  What the heck happened??????
2.0,"The watch is elegant but had to send back. My mother has a very small wrist but the band was too small and did not fit. Also, the manual wind would not work due to her inactivity."
2.0,Smells funny.
2.0,"My husband hates everything about these jeans. He doesn't like the color, the way they look or the way they fit. He says they feel and look cheap."
2.0,"I had 4 that wouldn't close, I had 1 that I couldn't even open. This was disappointing since I hosted a bracelet party and had trouble with several beads, at least the o rings worked out."
2.0,To light weight. Tore after first use.
2.0,"Nice design and feel, but very poorly put togther. They lasted three weeks until one of the lens fell off, never to be found again."
2.0,Only has 1 pin post so can not secure to prevent from spinning
2.0,"I need to return this item , it's too small.  The waist was too high of maybe my blogs are too big! Any wAy it doesn't fit me right. Tks."
2.0,Ordered a size up and it still didn’t fit
2.0,"These shoes are cute, but they are not comfortable.  Feet kept sliding, inserted foot pads, but didn't make a difference."
2.0,To small but I am going to keep them.
2.0,All I want from a belt besides a little style is a belt that won’t slip. Not an easy find for me in friction style belts for some reason. This is a fail. Used the brand in the past and satisfied. Patagonia and Kuhl worked much better for me.
2.0,"These do nothing to help night driving - maybe the white lines and signs are yellow, but the glare of lights is not affected at all by these glasses."
2.0,"Pretty top would have kept, but the sleeves were really tight. My arms are not that big."
2.0,Runs small. Material feels nice. I purchased this for surgery I had and I can’t wear it. Took 4 weeks to get.
2.0,Tarnished the next day. I purchased them for a 90s party. They were only good for those few hours.
2.0,"It was way smaller then was shown in the picture. Also didn't like the chain, looked cheap."
2.0,"The glass are nicley made, but look over sized and bulk compared to the image given for the product. Disappointed by the way it the pair looked, but rather than that a good product."
2.0,didnt care for it sent it back
2.0,They look good but are really to heavy for earrings.
2.0,"Nice looking jacket, but it runs small. It was very tight around my arms."
2.0,The fit was too small even though I sized up. Had to return.
2.0,"Was very disappointed with this purchase. Should have heeded other peoples' reviews; mask is VERY large. I have a normal sized head, so I thought maybe the few people stating that it was large just had smaller heads - boy, was I WRONG. I had 3-4 inches of extra space, no matter how I positioned the mask, and it ended up looking terrible. Also, the mask smelled terribly, and it was flimsy/thin. I debated padding the inside of it to see what it would look like, but the chin strap still would have been super big, and would have looked weird. Wasn't worth the money to ship it back."
2.0,I was super excited about this skirt. I love everything checkered. But there was no volume to it like a traditional skater skirt. Just wasn’t what I hoped it would be. It was the correct size. Fit nicely. Material was cheap
2.0,La tela buena y el diseño igual que la foto pero muy grande el vestido y muy corto
2.0,"Was great for one wear, then after a hand wash and hang dry, became deformed and un-wearable"
2.0,Quality was not as good as expected.
2.0,"The pants were nice, but the size was way off..."
2.0,"I enjoyed this bracelet the 3 times I wore it. The 4th time it broke in a way it cannot be fixed. There is no refund. I'm thankful It was not expensive, but I would rather have the bracelet!  I read that others have have had the same problem. Maybe that is a clue the bracelet should be redesigned or discontinued."
2.0,Loops good but besides that it was nearly impossible to get in and it randomly fell apart after a month.  Save your $8
2.0,"I was expecting a nice jacket and wind goes right through, i guess ill wear it in summer..."
2.0,"I really like the look and feel of this belt but it has a fatal flaw: it won’t hold an adjustment.  I’m constantly having to re-tighten mine.  The buckle doesn’t grip the belt, which keeps slipping back through it."
2.0,Was way too large for me and there were very visible defects in the design. The colors are nice but I was disappointed that there was blue threading that ran into the other colored stripes in quite a few places which is hard to overlook. At first I thought it might be part of the design but upon closer examination I realized that it was not. I had to return it- but may try again in hopes of not receiving a defective product because I really like the sweater.
2.0,"This is a mixed review. The item shipped immediately, and it arrived the very next day. The quality exceeded my expectations. The downside is i am a 9 1/2 wide, and they are to small even for me. So if you are a male with greater than a size 9 foot, save your money."
2.0,"I like the idea of them, but the description and picture didn't match what I got. I still thinking of returning"
2.0,"There are two things this wallet doesn't do or doesn't do properly.  The section for paper money is NOT big enough for bills.  I have to fold my paper money as the wallet is not long enough to accommodate it, and it doesn't have a wristlet.  It didn't advertise a wristlet, but that would have made the inability to accommodate paper money more palatable.  It arrived in good time and was (barely) able to hold my iphone plus.  I would have returned it, but I had already thrown away the package and packing.  It will be thick since the ability to hold the larger phone adds width.  It really needs a wristlet/strap."
2.0,"Like the fit, the style, the comfort-- but I have owned these sandals for &lt;3 months, and they are already starting to show significant wear at the toes (rubber is starting to ""fray""). For the price, I expected them to certainly weather the summer, but I'm not sure that will be the case (particularly since we have ""long"" summers here). I bought these to replace a pair of O'Neills I had for 3 years-- unfortunately they stopped making the model I liked/owned, so these were as close as I could find, but the quality is just not there-- definitely lacking. I would not recommend these, regardless of how ""novel"" the bottle opener on the bottom is. Who opens a drink with a shoe, after all (dirty-- eck!)?"
2.0,Cheap craftsmanship.
2.0,They are very beautiful but fit super tight and are uncomfortable. I have a small head so it shouldn't fit this way.
2.0,It's a little tight and I had ordered the next size up. The material is very cheap.
2.0,"disappointing.  First, these are lever-back earrings, which ..at least to me..are a pain.  Second, the discs are much smaller than the picture implies.  The size is somewhere between the size of a dime and a nickel.  Difficult to see picture because they are so small."
2.0,Bonitas y comodas pero no son de compresion realmente
2.0,"Love the Locksack, but the combination lock that came with it won’t open with the supplied code. I guess I’m going to have to pay to buy my own lock."
2.0,These pants didn't look anything like the picture and the model must be really short because I am only 5'4&#34; and they barely covered my ankles.
2.0,Fabric not the best quality
2.0,"I liked the concept a lot, but the bottom has a cheap hem and the black shirt bled everywhere. I almost kept them just to wear around the house because they’re comfortable, but ultimately decided to return them."
2.0,"i usually use tanktops as undershirts and i cant with these, also the material feels weird"
2.0,"Not as expected.  Order a larger size to fit my frame and size.  I am a regular 2xl for shorts, all my other shorts usually fit a bit loose. But for a 2xl, they fit like daisy dukes, short and a little snug."
2.0,Product looks cheap
2.0,I can't get the class to open very easily
2.0,"Way too small, ordered an xl ,fits like a medium"
2.0,"Good looking bag but not durable.  Zipper broke after first couple weeks, and stiching has come undone.  I love the number of pockets and compartments, however bot a great bag."
2.0,"not 3"", much longer"
2.0,"The sizing is pretty spot on. However the weight of the jeans are super heavy and a little bulky near the pelvic region. These would be okay during the deep winter and if you had a tummy on the larger side, but if you just have a little extra weight you are trying to hide this is super uncomfortable."
2.0,The Black were bit soft like the navy or the long ones and seem a bit splotchy and see through...but I’m sure I will buy more bc I need them and I will hope I just got a bad pair this time
2.0,"This isn’t your typical fleece sweatshirt.  It’s a cheap, thin and shiny type of material.  I looked at size chart before I ordered and decided on 2x/3x.... it’s the equivalent of a medium/large.  Very disappointed."
2.0,The material is on the silky polyester side. It has a shine to it.  It fits a bit small.  Wouldn't recommend.
2.0,"Too much ring,it has too much on the sides and around, I like rings that are slimmer between the fingers."
2.0,I’m usually a medium for everything and this was so big I would never be able fit into it
2.0,Wouldn't stay on. Way to large. Not cute on. Threw them in the garbage.
2.0,nice fabirc
2.0,The material is nice and so is the dress but the sleeves are way too long you have to get them to fix<br />I'm 5’5 and 190 pounds usually wear Sz XL or 14-16 in dresses so the sleeves are really really long you could fit another hand in length that's how long they are
2.0,"These did NOT help me see colors I don’t already see (I’m red & green colorblind). They just add a red haze to EVERYTHING, so white now looks pink, blues (including the sky) look purple, and so on.<br /><br />They are well-made, and they do say these glasses won’t work for 1 in 5 people. So I assume I’m just that unfortunate 1.<br /><br />Whatever the case, I sent them back."
2.0,my daughter did not like this at all
2.0,I mean you get what you pay for. It’s really small and flimsy. The metal is really thin and it feels and sounds cheap. It was impossible to put a picture in here because it wouldn’t stay and kept popping out so I just bought a different one. Spend a little more and get something that will last
2.0,Band leaves a gap.
2.0,Its a pretty dress but after I tried it on I realized it looked used. It had makeup on the inside of the dress and the actual dress showed signs of use. Otherwise tight pretty dress. No good for anyone wit big boobs
2.0,The top was perfect! It looks so cute! BUT the bottoms… were huge and had no elastic at all around the legs… my daughter love her Cocomelon swim suit so I just gave her wear another pair of bottom underneath these ones. My daughter is about 3ft tall and 28” tall.
2.0,"For the price, it was great. I bought it to give my girlfriend, though, and it just didn't feel high enough quality for me to be comfortable giving it."
2.0,Returned. Was not a fan - I'm short and the high-lo did not sit right on me. The low was dragging on the floor a bit. Not a huge fan of the design either - the print is cute but the pleats were not flattering on my frame.
2.0,Floppy hat droops in front- cant hold shape. Returning.
2.0,"Not as in product description. Can not see eyes behind mirror finish on these.  I really dislike mirror glasses, would never have ordered."
2.0,This item was way too big and it had some spots on the front of it that would not come off
2.0,no<br /> good
2.0,Haven’t been able to purchase yet
2.0,Good looking watch but dropped a lot of time in a single day so I returnedd it a bought another watch.. The white on white face was a little hard to read.
2.0,This is very light weight not liked it looked
2.0,I like the purse which was to long and the dress was wayyyy to long dress fely like thin paper
2.0,Very basic. Didn't match the picture
2.0,The material of these Fleece Jogger Pants is too thin; the fleece part is almost nonexistent.
2.0,Cute shirt but fits much looser than the dark stripe version. (See photos for comparison.) the torso was baggier and the sleeves looser. Will be returning.
2.0,Great jacket but runs small
2.0,"The pants are skimpy, more like leggings than pants. The skirt only flows like the picture when you're moving fast, otherwise it just hangs limply."
2.0,"I rated this a two because I was disappointed with the cheap material. The photo does it a lot of justice. Granted, it is warm and cozy but wouldn’t wear it with an outfit like in the photo. More of a lounging top."
2.0,They were nice for the price. My son wanted them for his girlfriend. We will see how she likes them.
2.0,Yes the ring is great but you can wear everyday because the silver part falls off. I was a little shocked that just after a month that started to happen. Just a note I never got the ring wet.
2.0,This dress was very cute but ran very small in the arms and the sleeves were short. I was very disappointed with the fit.
2.0,"The size ordered was not sent to me, and it would cost more to return the item than what i would initially paid to get the item.  Very upset about the order as i was expecting to get the item and make a wear.  It would have appeared to be nicely fitted , style and everything fit it was the right size"
2.0,The clarity of the lens and bifocal is good but the frame nose piece I did not like.
2.0,These are totally adorable but won’t stay tied so you trip. I didn’t get past my bedroom door with them on.
2.0,"Ugly. Torso and wrist materials are two different types and shades(see pic2). ""Mesh"" sleeves are more of a tulle type of material ( see pics 3,4). Stitching is on the outside by the shoulder and wrist and  seams can be seen throughout the ""mesh"" section of the arm (see all pics). I dodn't even have to try it on to know it would be too small.  Lastly, it is shades of RED, like Blood Red. Not the burgundy color pictured in the description. I'm so disappointed."
2.0,"This is pretty but it didn't fit well.  The stud is long and shows.  I have another one I wear that does not show, so I'm sticking w/ that one."
2.0,"First impression, this chain is beautiful. It’s sturdy, & shines brilliantly.  But after only a few uses, it becomes dull and dingy. Even after using silver polish, I can’t get it to hold a shinning sterling silver. If it wasn’t outside of the return window, I would be sending back."
2.0,"These little leg warmers are pretty cute, but not as cute as they look in the picture. I will probably not use them on my daughter. They are a little bit too big for her legs and would probably only stay up over jeans, with leggings I could see them just sliding down into a lump around her ankles in very little time. They also took a long time to come, although maybe not as long as some other items considering they come from China. I'm usually not completely pleased with items I receive from China. Funny considering how many products are actually made in China but sold by other companies. But the items that I receive directly from China just seem lower quality to me, in general. I would not buy these again but I might try using them in the future when my daughter is a little older and filled out. She is 4 right now. Its not worth the cost to me to return them."
2.0,"For tactical, its stiff in the rear due to the design not being gusseted. I'll be donating it because its uncomfortable in this regard."
2.0,"I disliked the color, the Yellowstone shirts are supposed to be a dull yellow, my shirt that I received was bright yellow. I also didn't  like the font, it just looked plain."
2.0,It wasn't what I thought. Had to see it to fit
2.0,"Broke on the first day. Too bad it was cute…just cheap. But I wasn’t overly upset, you get what you pay for."
2.0,The watch is nice. But the item to adjust the watch bent and broke right away. I am not sure if the watch will handle sizing well. Requesting a replacement and will see how the second one goes.
2.0,Washed it by hand once and already has holes in it
2.0,Came crooked. Cant quite them to sit right on my face. Not noticeable to others though.
2.0,"Pockets nice in back, but after a couple of washings pockets frayed and had holes in them :("
2.0,Extremely small :(
2.0,Is not an NFL Licensed product.  No Minnesota vikings logo on it.
2.0,Hat was crushed and  will not hold shape
2.0,"I purchased this item seeing the affordable price for three piece combo set, but the item arrive with only one piece."
2.0,"Not really what I thought it would be, the strapped kept popping off, it was very uncomfortable."
2.0,Band was too long
2.0,Dress is a heavy printed material(it’s a picture print )… not the ethereal garden dress you may be hoping for.
2.0,I tried these on and they felt comfortable and I loved the way they felt until I did a very small squat and a hole big enough to put 2 fingers in happened to develop right on the inside seam.
2.0,These are cute but they are so overstuffed that my daughter couldn’t fit her foot inside (and she has narrow feet). Bummer.
2.0,"it's pretty to look at, however it really doesn't stay on if you have to wear glasses. it's also on the heavier side - difficult to breathe through"
2.0,These socks do not fit size 9.  I suspect they would be too small even for size 7.
2.0,The jacket's arms are very big. They are not proportionate to the size at all. Had to safety pin them up. It worked for what I needed it for but it's a thin jacket and sizing is weird.
2.0,Too small. Weird shoulders
2.0,The chain was so thin and not what I expected.  I returned it and will think twice about ordering a necklace online.
2.0,Shirt had strings hanging off of it when it arrived and a couple seams were starting to split.  I was concerned about the quality of the product so I returned it without wearing it.
2.0,very form fitting I am a 3xl so I bought bigger but that did not matter with this shirt
2.0,"These earrings are okay, they are smaller than I thought they would be."
2.0,"The skirt part was too stiff for my liking, it didn't flow at all."
2.0,"I was so looking forward to getting these earrings. I also ordered the 2mm ones as well. I’ve been looking for brown earrings and thought these were perfect. And then they showed up, mine aren’t brown, they are a dark shade of purple. Both sets! Pretty earrings if you want purple. I’m really disappointed, they were so inexpensive I decided to just keep them and add them to my other purple earrings. I will keep looking for other brown options, just not from this vendor."
2.0,I ended up returning these. The fit was very awkward and the straps were too short to go across my son's feet.
2.0,I just received mine and am disappointed.  The gloves are not lined.  The description says lined and the photos show lined.  Mine are not.  I will be returning them.
2.0,I was expecting a more fitted or tapered sweatshirt. Fits very well until the waist. It kind of flares out and looks bad. Designed for someone with a belly I guess. Doesn't look like it does on the model. I'm 5'10&#34; and in good shape. Would not buy again.
2.0,Bottom fits and top doesnt
2.0,These things never fit me correctly.  The legs are too tight at the band or theyre too long for the foot.  Too tight at the ankle.  I am going to stop ordering them
2.0,It’s not a bad sweater - it just looks nothing like the photo. I guess what do you expect for an $11 sweater?
2.0,Love the carbon fiber but feels cheaply made.
2.0,"Tint too light, almost transparent like normal glasses. Looks ok inside"
2.0,"Runs small, even when measurements guide you to a certain size. Also, material is thin. The bra shows through."
2.0,It look better in pics than in person
2.0,Too long.  Flimsy material for me..
2.0,The mask was a joke. The dang thing ripped once I tried to tie the back. The strap was attached to a thread on the mask. Just looking at it I knew it was not sturdy.  Thank goodness I ordered another mask set and was able to use that. It was a very cute mask so it was disappointing. The tail and headband was awesome! I didn’t wear the gloves or the stockings so I can’t comment on those.
2.0,too large. and do not like material!!
2.0,extremely flimsy - poor quality  would not suggest it
2.0,"Cheaply made.  I’ve only had it a little more than a month and I recently had to “Super Glue” the key chain back together and now I’ve just discovered one of the turtle disc pictures( two sided ) has popped out and is missing.  It could be anywhere, I go a lot of places !"
2.0,"Several reviews said the coat ran small so I ordered 4XL, it was ginormous.  Swallowed my 6'3"", 210 husband. I need to fit a size 38-40R man, so ordered a large, which I couldn't get on at 5'3"", 120. I tried 2XL, also too hig for my husband.  I need this for show costume, so I'm going to try the XL.  As for color, 1st one I got was blue, just like the pic.  I switch to red 2nd time and it was also like the pic. The last one was more orange, kind of ugly.<br /><br /> It's not very good quality but sufficient for what I need it for, which is somebody wearing it on stage for a couple of scenes."
2.0,"The issue may have been random, but the necklace fell apart. Not happy about that."
2.0,"Disappointed--I like to carry pocket watches but have found over time that the more expensive ones die about a quickly as the cheap ones. So I have bought several Chinese pocket watches over the years for $10 to $20.  Often the biggest problem it the cover catch wears out.  But for the money I’ve paid, a replacement is an easy way to go.  However as another reviewer noticed--this watch is light and feels cheap. Also it will stop periodically for no apparent reason (but will restart and keep time well for at least a few days until you go through the process again--but I have had fewer problems with cheaper Chinese pocket watches than this one.<br /><br />Also for those frustrated for lack of instructions on how to wind it.  Yes, it IS a quartz watch so no winding is involved.  However the company furnishes a watch key (separate from the chain) and hence the confusion.  I’m baffled with what one is supposed to do with the key.  Even if it is merely decorative, what does it attach to?<br /><br />My recommendation, get a plainer looking Chinese pocket watch for have the price.  It will work as well, last as long and have the expected heft."
2.0,"Very Lovely and Designed Well! But not UV Sun block!<br /> I have  sun allergy and have to cover my arms when outdoors. This is just decorative, thin nylon fabric, which DOES NOT protect from the sun!<br />The product description should not be misleading. There will be still people who will like this product as a decorative but NOT for sun protective.<br /><br />It did not helped me protect from sun and I'm going to search and find the right product."
2.0,"Item listing says ""for girls and women"" but unless you're a woman the size of a small child, these will not fit you! They are TINY!"
2.0,The material is very thin and the shape of the top was off somehow - it didn't fit right.  Will be returning it.
2.0,Sleeves around wrists and neck are stretched out.
2.0,The tiara is beautiful. It was just a bit too small for our daughter's head. Her hair kept being pulled out by the little circle at the back that secured the teeth to the tiara.
2.0,"I'm so disappointed in this necklace.  I didn't expect it to be a big, flat plate.  I thought it was going to be a pretty pendant with dimension.  It looks like a keychain that you would win at a fair or something.  The chain feels like plastic, and the name plate is tarnished.  The front looks like whatever made it look silver is rubbed off in some spots.  Plus, it arrived upside down.  The big portion was on top.  Thankfully, it's cheap enough that I could easily bend and open links to fix it myself.  This is NOT worth $65.  The only reason it got two stars is because it has my daughters' names on it.  That alone is the only thing pretty about this necklace."
2.0,Too short for 5’7 woman. Needs to be 1-2 inches longer for me.
2.0,"Flimsy material, made for inexpensive watches. Fits only bands of small and medium widths, these measurements are not mentioned. Had to return because the watchband I had purchased this for (woman's) was actually too wide to fit in the tool."
2.0,"The watch band fit as expected, however the second time I wore it the stationary band loop fell off. Therefore every time I wore the watch I had to be very careful that it didn't fall off due to the band basically being held on by the sliding band loop, which would slide off of the band.<br />My opinion is that this replacement band isn't worth the money. Very poorly made."
2.0,Been purchasing these for years for my son to use at college. Something's changed in the design. His toes hang over the front now. Not comfortable and probably not safe for him. Not sure if the company changed vendors but there is something definitely wrong. Not what they used to be.
2.0,"Charm is so small that I am unable to read the words, this is a problem with a 3 purchases."
2.0,The pants are only 6 months old and they are pilling and ripping.
2.0,Poor quality control package with two one of them with a hole. other than that they are ok.
2.0,"I bought these pants after reading the reviews. I am a size 18. I bought 2x. But these were more or less like a size medium. They did not go over my butt, nor did they fit right. Do not recomend for larger hikers. Smaller, no-butt, hikers, maybe.<br /><br />Fabric was cheap feeling, but I have joggers with similar fabric that have been with me for the past 5 yrs. So, I have no real comments on longevity.<br /><br />Also: no free return. :( so, heed my words those with big butts."
2.0,Really runs small. Couldn't use
2.0,did not like quality and ran small.
2.0,These must be foreign sizes because they were way off.
2.0,Love the heavyweight flannel & POCKETS!<br />I ordered up a size because no stretch. Washed great-no color fade. Sad some areas of inside seams have to be sewn where their machine clearly missed.
2.0,Too short waisted and tight.
2.0,"This wrap skirt is missing that little slit in the waistband to pull the band through so you can actually wrap it around you. Your only option is to literally just tie the bands at your waist like a scarf, displaying all your bits, so it would only work as a cover-up over a bathing suit. I don't know if mine was just defective or if they're all like that. If I liked it enough I could cut my own hole, but I'm returning it. If you don't mind doing that, then it could be a cute skirt."
2.0,It comes with a slip but buy a another one to wear with it. I wore this dress for my wedding we had a very small courthouse wedding. Luckily I had white underwear because you can see underwear threw the dress
2.0,Not the quality I was hoping for or expecting
2.0,def. isn't what it looks like on her...im petite. the material is a bit see through..
2.0,Looked beautiful but definite issues with quality and sizing. I ordered my normal size and there were huge gaps on the sides and top of the shoe. Had to return these because of sizing and quality issues.
2.0,Too heavy and scratchy.
2.0,This does not fit my husbands wrist at all. (To small) mine on the other hand it’s to big even when pushed all the way together.
2.0,It's Polyester or feels like it so it's not really Loose and is a bit heavy so doesn't hang well on people with curves.  Would like it much better if it was cotton or a lighter weight fabric.  Will be returning.
2.0,"Came in a different color, dissapointed, products should come exactly how they are described and how the look in the picture"
2.0,They are a little thin so dont feel a comfortable in the shoe
2.0,Cute but very cheap looking. Definitely too small in chest area
2.0,"i was looking forward to receiving my hoodie, when i received it the packaging was torn and the hoodie was soaking wet and a little dirty.<br />i was not happy about that.<br />Thats why im giving it 2 stars."
2.0,I have used these bags twice and the stitching is already coming undone. The only positive I have is they did fold back up easier than other bags which I liked. But the fact the the stitching is already coming undone after two uses means they will not hold up.
2.0,A little large in the body short in the sleeves
2.0,My kiddo was so excited to get these. She loved the color combo. They are lightweight. The sole is kind of hard so a little slippery Regardless she liked them. Unfortunately they frayed after the 1st day and then a grommet tore off on the 3rd day.  Returned!
2.0,I ordered Large and received a SMALL/MEDIUM.<br />The band around the ribcage is tight and digs in under the bra line. I’m a 34B size 6 and this is so uncomfortable.<br />Also the seams on the top band are frayed upon opening to put on. The material isn’t very slimming it doesn’t do anything. I wanted this for under leggings and dresses to skim the muffin top effect. No change plus the material is slippery so your leggings or bottoms slide down and dig in more. So uncomfortable.<br />I returned these after 1 wear. Not good. I’ll soebd more for babe brand spanx that do a better job of slimming the tummy section.
2.0,The print was blurry. And the seams dis not match.
2.0,"These sports bands compatible with Apple Watch are a disappointment. The band that I ordered says it fits 42mm/44mm/45mm/49mm. Mine is a 44, and it kind of wiggles around, isn’t it a tight fit.<br />Also you can see from the pictures that the connecting parts of the band show on both sides of the watch. I don’t like that.<br />The pictures in the description looked a little nicer than they do in person. In my opinion they look cheap. It doesn’t feel smooth and comfortable against my wrist.<br />I’m really not thrilled with these watch bands."
2.0,"First off it came with the left seam open, the material is very thin and you can see right through it, the top cannot be tucked in the bottom, it fits like a crop top."
2.0,Clothes will easily slide because these don't stay in place because of the metal and nothing to stabilize the clothing side. I constantly have to re-adjust the placement of these. I gave a 2 because they are cute looking. Be prepared to have to constantly re-position if you're using without belt loops.
2.0,"paint chips off too easy and quickly, but they are cute before that happens."
2.0,"The fabric is very cute, but there's way too much material in the stomach area. This dress made me look like I'm pregnant and I'm definitely not!  I loved it otherwise but I'm returning the item."
2.0,"Ordered a large, got a children’s medium......"
2.0,"The clasp broke after 3 nights use. Great concept. We bought it for a son who has a hard time waking up. The problem is he didn’t sleep well because he was worried about getting shocked. I think it would have gotten better with time. It was too expensive to try again since it broke so easily. The company is willing to allow return, so that’s a positive."
2.0,"If you're buying this 'tunic' (that is NOT a tunic!) because is looks as though it is going to cover your backside and everything else down to the top of your thighs ---- DON'T!  I'm 5'5"" and the hem barley reaches to 2 inches below my waist!  The model in the advertisement has to be shorter than 4'10""... or they're fibbing about what they are selling. I know that ""...to wear with leggings"" does not imply a specified length, however ""tunic"" rather does.  And, the picture of their model most certainly shows a top considerably longer than the 'tunic' being sold ----- From now on--- On line --- I buy men's.  I know they're long enough!"
2.0,"I received a different print than I ordered with dark pink and butterflies instead of the light patterned print I ordered. The leotard itself is ok. It fits fine in the body, but the leg holes are a little baggy or stretched out looking. It is also rather thin, so I’m not sure it will last too long, but the price is right. It works fine for my once a week child gymnasts. Both daughters claim it’s itchy in the front where the v meets at the neck. I would have given it 3 stars if I had gotten the right print."
2.0,I liked the color the most and the sizing was way too small. I ordered an XL but it fitted like a medium-sized
2.0,Tore after a few wears (less than 15 times).
2.0,Dress is cute but fabric is very unflattering. Clings. Too bad because the style is super cute.
2.0,The material is great but it runs way too small. I got 6-12 month and it fit my four month old (14.5 lb) but was way too tight on her thighs.
2.0,Poorly put together. Strap popped whiming trying on. No lining and thin rayon
2.0,Didn't maintain shape. Returned.
2.0,The little latches that kept the band attached to the watch broke. Little parts on the band are slowing breaking apart.
2.0,"Fabric is too fluffy. Very unflattering in abdominal area,  especially because I have a little bit extra wt."
2.0,"This is just made weird.  It is very small around the arm area (and I have small arms).  And it is pretty short.  Also, it had a weird odor to it.  Returning."
2.0,"The pants are sized well but the top is way too small, I'm barely a C cup and it was too small"
2.0,"I’m really bummed, it’s a very cute suit but the bottoms are completely sheer. The back side of the bottoms aren’t even swimsuit material, it’s just sparkly unlined mesh. It’s more of a rave outfit than a swimsuit. Top ran small, I’m a 32D usually, but the bottoms fit well."
2.0,I’m always a large in tops and I decided to get a xl because the reviews said it ran small. I could barely get the top on. It has no stretch whatsoever. I don’t recommend
2.0,"Way too small and had to return, didn't stretch well, could barely get hands inside. Company was very good about return."
2.0,Colors are not as they appear
2.0,"This product was very nice & pretty when it arrived.  However, I didn’t have it a month and the bracelet gems faded awfully and no longer match the rose gold band.  Not pleased!"
2.0,Advertised as fleece. It is not. Is a woven fabric. No warm soft fleece !
2.0,Very very cheaply made but you get what you pay for word it twice and change to copper color
2.0,"They are beautiful but the metal is extremely soft. When I put the back onto the post, the post bent on both earrings."
2.0,I bought this purse as a gift. Was expecting it to be much larger.
2.0,The product got torn after less than 10 use.
2.0,"This is not something you see in the picture, The fabric is not comfortable at all. I do not recommend to any body!"
2.0,"The dress was beautiful, colors were amazing. I was going to wear it to a baby shower because I'm team Blue.... unfortunately, it was really small in the shoulder area, and I couldn't fully get itbon for fear of it ripping!"
2.0,"Recieved dress too large. Reordered smaller. Then my return of the larger size dress was refused. Reason given was it was delivered to me &#34;undamaged&#34; therefore it could not be returned. Then their customer service even wrote &#34;You can always just give the dress away as a gift.&#34; Suggesting what I might do with a dress that doesn't fit. Buyer Beware on this one. Two stars only thecause the dress that actually fit was okay--but truly not worth the price of both dresses, or the unfortunate experience. Also, please note: though both dresses were ordered in gray they were completely different in material. One was silky poly the other a heather jersey (required a slip). Like I said, Buyer Beware on this one."
2.0,This is a comfortable headband and easy to use tail.  The ears were not stitched together and were starting to fall apart by the time it arrived.
2.0,These socks are extremely small. I don't have a problem on the quality of the fabric.
2.0,Viene reducido y la tela muy corriente
2.0,The pearl bulge out too much so it doesnt look right on the ear. I don't suggest buying it.
2.0,"This was given to me as a Christmas gift--late arriving.  The zipper doesn't work and the inside rattles like paper!  It's a great size and light weight. I love the purse, but am frustrated!"
2.0,Had to return these. Fit was too small and they were a skinny fit. Not good hiking pants.
2.0,"too long,  its past mid calf and not past ankles."
2.0,"THis is very thin and feels quite synthetic, but great at the price, it is nice and big in fiy"
2.0,"I ordered the set of two in black and royal blue, both size small. The black fits like a women's medium but the blue is absolutely gigantic. Either I got sent a men's small or a women's XXL with a small tag.<br /><br />This may be my last straw buying clothes on Amazon because the sizes are so insanely wrong much of the time."
2.0,Wasn’t what I expected. Thumb holes are not comfortable due to excess material. Fit is snug!
2.0,Haven't  worn it yet looks comfy but very thin tshirt material and looks see thru.
2.0,Awesome style but not very oversized which was a bummer for the other half.
2.0,It's a cute casual dress. The material is thin and spandex. I wear a size 10 and fit me pretty snug. I would suggest getting a size bigger. I'm sure once I wash it it will be too small.
2.0,These are my daughter’s favorite pants because they’re very comfortable. They used to last her all school year but  I’m very disappointed with the quality of the recently purchased pants. 2 pairs out of 3 started falling apart after literally the first wear. Also the sizing is inconsistent. I originally bought 4 pairs all size 8 and charcoal gray and pink ones fit as expected but the light gray ones fit at least one size too small so they had to be returned. I won’t be buying these pants again.
2.0,My ears rejected these studs almost immediately. They were itchy and made my piercing ooze. Do not buy if you have sensitive ears.
2.0,The color is not at all as pictured. I ordered purple but what I got is an ugly maroon. The case is also misaligned.
2.0,Cute but it’s so sheer and the fabric feels “fake”. Not sure how else to describe it 🤷🏼‍♀️
2.0,My friend and I each got one for each other unknowingly haha. To our dismay they both broke within about 48 hrs of receiving the ring. The actual flower spinner bit came out of the ring and was unable to attach. It is very cute. Although I would not recommend this brand if they continue to use this same product design
2.0,The dress was small in the shoulders but fine in the bodice.
2.0,Great price but way too small.
2.0,"Not something I can wear outside.  Very thin and see through, more like  sleep shorts."
2.0,The price makes sense. The stone's color looked like the picture however the stone itself looked like it was dragged on or rubbed on cement.  I took a rag and some cleaner and tired to run out all the scrapes on it and most came out but its still there.
2.0,frog with red eyes rusted in about a month and then litterly broke after having for 3 months but the other ring is fine
2.0,"Well made, but gapes open at the chest."
2.0,When I got the hats I loved the look. There was no lining and they quickly stretched to where they are too big. I cannot send back now although I only wore each one maybe once or twice. Buy a better quality hat!!!
2.0,I have several Lauren dresses and this one didn't fit true to size for me.
2.0,"The logo is a bit rough and the color, which was supposed to be red, is actually closer to a reddish-pink.  Not the look I was going for."
2.0,"I ordered a 10.5 size, my normal shoe size for 20+ years.  The shoe fit like an 11.5 or 12, totally ridiculous for a $50 shoe.  Much better choices and prices for other brands."
2.0,Pretty but I can't get it to stay without making my ear red from squeezing it too tight. Seems pretty good quality.
2.0,Poor material!!!
2.0,"My son loves the Look and the bottom cushion Of these shoes, but he said it’s too tight on the top of the shoe and hurts the top of his foot."
2.0,This outfit is cute but I didn’t end up wearing for the holidays. I ordered my size which is small. The bottoms are snug and the top is extra tight. Material is itchy.  I recommend ordering a size up if interested in this outfit.
2.0,Very practical keychain. Not very durable.
2.0,"This dress if of a cheaper quality.  Though cute and nice fitting, it pills and won't last beyond a year, I would think."
2.0,"This shirt, after 1 wash according to directions, had a hole in the neck and a loose belt loop. Returned."
2.0,"The fabric is nice, but I took two steps and they fell off my feet."
2.0,It's ok for what is worth. Material is kinda cheap but matches its price.
2.0,"Product has a SUPER short post and TINY backs. Picture of a 14k gold 3mm CZ stud and back from piercing pagoda on the left, and the above product - 14k gold 3mm CZ stud. At least 1/8 inch difference in post length and minuscule difference in post gauge as well."
2.0,Not impressed. The paint has already come off the front erasing the design.
2.0,Cheap leather. Don't buy it.
2.0,"I bought this for my sons hunting themed birthday party. I expected the colors to be muted, like they were in the pictures. That was not the case. It was a bright blue, light blue and a vibrant tan. Not at all what I was looking for or expected."
2.0,Hat is ok as far as ball caps go.  But I was very disappointed that the LOGO was an IRON ON patch.. not sewn into the hat itself.  Not what I expected it to be but will use it on the beach !
2.0,So not 8.5 inches long :( they are 7.5
2.0,Looked terrible on me.
2.0,"The beads are nice, but both of them the beads started to fall off. Very disappointed that this started to happen in several weeks."
2.0,Sorry- this looks cheap.  The handles are too short to wear the bag on your arm and the yellow is to mustardy looking.  The inside lining says &#34;paste.&#34;
2.0,The material is cheaply made. The dress shows your entire body
2.0,"My low review is for the fabric. I like the shape of the dress but the fabric is really heavy and shiny, and clings to you like static! I'll give it a go in the summer with sandals, and hopefully the static effect will be minimal."
2.0,"Im normally a US large, so going by the feedback received, I ordered an XXL and the shirt, while fits up top, the torso portion is small and barely goes past my midsection.  Totally, not satisfied with this shirt.  Will return and not reorder.  Totally disappointed."
2.0,"My daughter for the pair of earrings they’re so thin that when I told her shirt off, the ear ring broke after two days, not worth the money"
2.0,"I am disappointed this is way to big for my almost one year old. I can't use it for 1st bday photos now. Also the snow flakes came broken on the skirt, I will have to hot glue then back in place."
2.0,I ORDERED THIS A SIZE LARGER THAN I USUALLY DO AND (PFFFT) EVEN IF I ORDERED MAYBE 4 TIMES BIGGER THAN MY SIZE I COULD FIT IT.  I GAVE IT TO MY DAUGHTER.  WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY. TY
2.0,"At first I was really very happy with my purchase, a few days after using it I realized that the material where the closure goes was already worn.  I later realized that the money-back guarantee had expired.  It is the first time something like this has happened to me since I have been shopping for Amazon for several years."
2.0,I really like the bright colors on this shirt. I ordered a size larger than normal & unfortunately it was still 2 sizes too small. I gave it away as a gift!!
2.0,The color is not nearly as vibrant as the picture. It is more faded closer to pink than red.
2.0,cheaply made not good quality
2.0,Overall cheap product and the only offer me a 30 dollar refund which is insulting to me. Would like full refund.
2.0,Too wide.  Hard to keep on and not soft as advertised.
2.0,"False description they ask for ur size then they just send u what they have which isn’t the size last minute they change the description to not be what it said before, gonna return them ."
2.0,"It claims it is desert tan color & in the pucture it is darker than when you receive it , In reality it's a lot lighter in color and from a distance it appears almost white"
2.0,Flimsy band connector.
2.0,"I am long-waisted, and the waist of this dress sat too high and made it look very unflattering on me. The pockets (one of which had a large hole in it) were a nice size, but they sat right on the hips of the dress and made it poof out in an unflattering way. I'll be returning it because it was unflattering on me, but it was nice quality and looked like the photo aside from awkward fit issues."
2.0,"I had to return it. The straps across the to were sewn very loose so they just hung down. Did not look like criss cross straps at all. Otherwise, material and fit was nice."
2.0,I would not buy again
2.0,I did not get this necklace. The necklace I got solid blue in the middle that didn't glow.
2.0,"The dress was beautiful but it didn't fit correctly so I requested a refund. The store told me to either keep it and they will send 50% of the money back or send it for a full refund. After I mailed it and send the tracking number to them they where supposed to send the refund in 5 to 7 business days. They didn't, and then changed the info in Amazon stating that the refund was given. I had to scalate things with Amazon directly for me to be able to receive my refund. Plus they kept asking me to give them a good review constantly even before they resolved me refund. Do not recommend it."
2.0,"Although this style is super cute it was made completely wrong. First the material it's made with seems cheap and is uncomfortable. Second if you have even the tiniest bit of thighs, butt, or boobs this leotard is not for you. Typically in leotards I wear a small, but I ordered a medium in this leotard due to past reviews. It is extremely tight around the thighs with a horrible elastic and the bust area is way too tight and way too low cut. I wish it was made better"
2.0,you would think that there would be a glove that could be used for a lefty nope only right handed people are aloud to have something like this they are what they say otherwise that is why i gave 2 stars but really should think of leftys  too
2.0,The top was way too small but the bottom fit really good...
2.0,This dress is not for tall girls or for anyone that might be a little in the middle.  It was far too short and quite unflattering on my mom bod.  For reference I am 6' 200lbs and bought a L.
2.0,"Ordered the black with velcro straps. The straps are way too long. We had to tie the straps in several knots to get them to work at all. In addition, the zipper on the side is constantly unzipping and falling down. My son managed to use these for a few days, but will definitely need something else moving forward.<br />Warning for the wise: some of the reviews for this product (and many other on amazon) may be fraudulent. Google for an article about fake reviews on amazon, then try fakespot for this product."
2.0,"just doesn't have the quality I was looking for.  I purchased it for use at work; so, it'll 'work'!"
2.0,"Cheap, broke within one week."
2.0,I’m very disappointed! I just bought another 3 pack after buying these tanks before. After 1 use & 1 wash the material is starting to break apart and there are now lines where it is beginning to unravel.
2.0,Cute but runs small and is definitely not waterproof or water resistant. Defeats the purpose.
2.0,Didnt like the feel of the fabric at all.
2.0,The stone is beautiful.  The backs don't go on or come off easily so my lobes get irritated in the process.
2.0,Very cute but breaks easily
2.0,"Don’t love it. I should have read the reviews more carefully. Pretty short, wide, and weird fabric."
2.0,Not as good quality as I expected.
2.0,"It doesn’t come like in the advertised photo. The picture is a dark green, and this is like a lighter green than that."
2.0,"These are pretty much an identical copy of the old style thinoptics ones, the kind where the nose rests break off very easily. Both of the nose rests broke off within a week. Going back to thinoptics. Those are also far from perfect, but I haven't found anything better."
2.0,I had to return these because the were big and floppy.  The material in the upper part of the boot was not as stiff as I needed it to be so they didn't work for me.
2.0,The puff sleeves are bit too puffy and makes me look like a wrestler. I have never worn it since I bought it. I'm pretty small made but still think it makes me look a bit broad around the shoulders.
2.0,Super cute but way too tight.  I wear a large so i bought one size up and couldn't get it over my head.
2.0,"Wish I had read the reviews first but I was in a hurry and the price was cheap and they looked “ok” based on the photo. Definitely not much neon like all the reviews said. The orange, yellow, and green were acceptable as far as being close to neon, but the blue and purple are quite dark and there is nothing even close to neon pink. Just red. As far as quality, they are what you’d expect for $1 glasses. I was looking for sunglasses for a neon theme night and these definitely will be a disappointment when i hand them out."
2.0,This looks Looney in length than it really is. My hoodie came with missing rings. 😳
2.0,This is beautiful but way too small. I usually fit a medium or large and thought this would be great coverup while on vacation. It's made for a thin framed person.
2.0,The shirt is very small
2.0,Sandals are super comfortable but on the first day I wore them (the day after I got them) the black fabric that holds the toe thong together broke. Still wearing them but with super glue.
2.0,I don’t know why I buy these shirts. The image is a cheap plastic feeling iron on. I’ll be returning.
2.0,"They are not separate dangles, it's like one piece of metal.  But also when I got them, there were 5 stones that had already fallen off!  Luckily they were laying loose in the box but still I am receiving something brand new that I'm having to super glue together."
2.0,"Looks great, sub par quality. The size chart does not apply because the measurements on the hoodie are not accurate to the size I requested. Unless you like a very very snug/tight fit, BUYER BEWARE."
2.0,"I'm 5'9 and wear a size 14 long jean. I bought an xl. They look nice and the pocket is handy for my phone and the length was good. But it's slick material, almost like stretchy satin. I was always having to pull them up. Working out in them is difficult unless I wear a long shirt that goes past my butt, or else my underwear and then some would he showing 5 minutes into my workout."
2.0,Will most likely give to someone much smaller than me. Fits more like a top.
2.0,Mine is crooked around the next. The material was sewn wrong. It’s bad enough I can’t wear it. Otherwise it’s a nice suit fits well.
2.0,Straps are not adjustable and was very tight on average size face.
2.0,"I have no idea what the “stretch” rating is... so I gave that 1 star.<br />This concept is good, but when you actually put it on someone, it is this warped twisted thing that doesn’t sit on the shoulders nearly as shown in pics.<br />These went in the bin immediately after trying to use it... ended up just buying a cape and using vac to clean up hair ...<br />Pretty much a waste."
2.0,Way way to small.  It would have been perfect.  Quality was good and color was accurate.
2.0,"I absolutely love the shirt, but it's really big for being a small... too big to wear comfortably"
2.0,"These are pretty, but mine are actually two different sizes. I plan to trim the longer of the two to match the other, but for $8.00 I'm not really thrilled about it."
2.0,Too small on my daughter
2.0,I wanted to like these shorts.  The rivets on the buttons are weak.  Two of the buttons fell off.  This is such a shame because these shorts look great.
2.0,In person it was more of a purple/gray color when I was expecting silver.
2.0,Totally different than the photo. The photo shows pants like are straight fit at ankle. The ones I received were long and book cut?? Otherwise the fit was good. Just wish it was what I ordered.
2.0,"bottoms are very unflattering, baggy and parachute-like. For reference, I am 5'7, 145 lbs athletic build."
2.0,"Not a Men's jacket.  Zipper is on the left side, that means it is for women.  I also ordered a XL, and the tag on it says 7XL.  This is an XXXXXXXL (asian woman) size."
2.0,Not flattering and the fabric was thicker than expected.
2.0,"It was cute; but, too small. The color was nice and the style was cool. I would have given it a better rating if it actually fit. Not only was it small, it was  two sizes too small. Therefore, I can't possibly keep it. I will be returning it."
2.0,I’m a 5’10”/170lb guy so typically I always wear a medium. Based on the size chart I chose to order this shirt in a large. The body and length are good but the sleeves are too short and loose.
2.0,Terrible. Can cause leg muscles to pain and fatigue quicker. Poorly designed
2.0,"I wear XS or S and ordered this jacket in M and it fits right. The quality of material and the jacket itself are not too bad, except for the weird design on a shoulder line.. It looks like imitation of 80's shoulder pads without and actual pad. Unsuitable for me."
2.0,"Although the size in length was fine, they were VERY wide and no where on the advertisement did they say they were for wide feet. So we haven't had too much wear out of them at all.<br /><br />However the shipping time was great."
2.0,"Really thin, more like mesh than a sweater. Size XL is actually a medium. I wouldn't buy again or suggest."
2.0,As cute as these are they did not fit like I expected.  I was thinking that are gonna rest on my nose parallel to my eyes.  They push all the way up to your face. No no no not on me.  I gave them away😭
2.0,"I wanted to love these after seeing good reviews, but they are too large at the top and the straps on one shoe are randomly loose where they shouldn't be. They are not cute and look super cheap on. I'm sending them back :("
2.0,Not the greatest. Loose s tee that vame out immediately
2.0,"The fabric of this tunic looks a little cheap.  But more importantly, it's not as long as the photo shows."
2.0,Okay so I just received these in the mail. I think they are sturdy glasses and definitely a bargain but they are too large and I have a round face so for me to say that means they would look extra large on a narrow or oval face shape. They are stylish but do not really block the sun much and are also on the heavy side which will not work at all with my greasy skin. I will be returning these sun glasses.
2.0,I thought it was very cute but it broke as soon as my daughter took it out of the box the mermaid just fell off in her hand she was so upset i glued it but that did not work so i would say im sure they wont all break and if it did not it was very pretty
2.0,"Super cute and looks just like the pic.  BUTTT, it’s made with wool and is SO scratchy.  Had to return :-("
2.0,Dress swallowed me.  Not true to size.
2.0,Runs small but super soft
2.0,"Completely see through, which is a bummer because its a cute style"
2.0,The item arrived defected.
2.0,Returned due to poor fabric dye - as in blotches. Very thin.
2.0,Really thin fabric and it is see through
2.0,The band loops snag on clothing.
2.0,"This dress is so cute, so I am so disappointed that it did not fit as expected.  I am a 36D, and my girls were super smashed.  The waist was perfect.  The arms were way too tight, and seemed to be sewn to fit the armpit area more in the upper arm range.  If that makes sense.  The fabric would be great for fall or early spring."
2.0,Glasses came in a timely manner. Glasses are diffinately cheaper quality than expected.
2.0,red dye came off on wrist.... would not buy again.
2.0,"At first glance totally cute. When I tried it on I noticed that the left arm sleeve hole was smaller than the right. Although it fit me, be aware the material does not stretch. I kept it as I needed it for a party the next day- I did wear a cardigan to hide the weird sleeve."
2.0,They are hard to get on
2.0,Way to small. I had to send back.
2.0,"The Headband feels very comfortable due to its lightweight material but it comes at the cost of cheap material design. Expect the Nike Logo to start detaching by the 2nd-3rd hand wash. Overall, 3/10 could be so much better if it had a better quality."
2.0,The skirt fabric is way too hard and does not flare very well .
2.0,Not good if you like to have tight laces.
2.0,"Super cute, fast shipping --- but my head had a nice green line across it at the end of the day......"
2.0,The dress is thin and poorly designed. The seam in back was ripped open the day I received it. The material is very itchy. I only tried it on and could not imagine wearing it for an entire evening. It fit well except in the hips. It is extra big in the hips. Returning for something more durable and less itchy.
2.0,I did not receive this color shown I received dark pink they were not as cute as I thought they would be.
2.0,"This is a sturdy ring and would have been perfect has the color been anything like the variations shown. I understand they all differ as they are natural, however, both stones are the exact same and look fake."
2.0,"This shirt is made of fabric that shrinks big time and wrinkles.  I washed and dried it with other wash and wear clothes, so am very disappointed.  Will return."
2.0,it broke after a week and cant get wet
2.0,couldn’t be adjusted and fell out of nose
2.0,"These were too cute not to try them but I regretted my decision as soon as I received them. I wear a 9 1/2 wide so I ordered these in a size 10. They fit my foot perfectly but there is absolutely no arch support and no padding in the base of the boot. As soon as I put them on the ball of my foot hurt and I knew I would not be able to wear them very long. I wanted these to wear to my brother-in-law's wedding this past weekend. I put an orthotic insert in them which helped, but I still had to walk around with sore feet. After a couple of hours I could not take the pain anymore and switched shoes. I actually brought extra shoes to the wedding becasue I knew these would hurt my feet. My husband wants to know why I bought them if I am not going to wear them. I told him I was hoping that they would be comfortable and that I would happily wear the soles off of them, but sadly this is not the case. Unfortunately I cannot return them and it is doubtful I will ever be able to wear them for more than an hour or two and that is with the orthotic insole. Without it, I will NEVER wear them. They are that uncomfortable!<br /><br />I always read through the customer reviews when deciding to purchase an item and realize the value that consumers place on them, so I take my reviews very seriously. I try to be truthful in disclosing as much information about my experience as I can so that you can feel comfortable making an informed decision. I really hope my review was helpful to you."
2.0,I never would have purchased these earrings had I seen them in person. They mostly show the back side of the earring. The backside is unfinished. Good size is the only positive!
2.0,It added that amazing gothic effect to my look but the top part wouldn't stay on and 20 minutes into my photo shoot I had completely lost the top.
2.0,Cute bag but handle has already started &#34;giving&#34; -- where it's joined to the bag is pulling and separating. Was the bag full? Yes. Was it full of a lot of heavy items? Definitely not.
2.0,My breasts showed way more than I had expected based on the pictures of the product.
2.0,"There was no remote control, it only works when it's plugged in & was too noisy for me. Sorry I had to return it."
2.0,"I Bought Mens 3XL with a 52&#34; chest.  This shirt fit more like a men's medium...no exageration.<br /><br />I did not return the shirts, because they fit my girlfriend perfectly.  She fits in a 10-12 sized dress for reference.<br /><br />Nice shirts though, especially for the price."
2.0,"This shirt is pretty. I like the color & the picture on it but it was too long, tight in the waist, chest & neck & made of thin fabric."
2.0,"I ordered a size up because the reviews said the top ran small.  The size is awkward: the top band is tight on the chest, and does not actually offer push up, but then the rest of it is shaped oddly, very loose (the bottom band of the top came to mid-thigh if pulled all the way down).  I ended up using a rubber band to tie off.  As for the bottoms, they are way too large, I had to double know on the nice cutout detail so they wouldn't slide off.  Wore it ONCE during a two week beach vacation, luckily I had a second option."
2.0,It was see through.  I returned it.  It would have been an adorable swimsuit cover.
2.0,See through and arm holes are too small.
2.0,The scarf smelled really bad like old diesel fuel.toxic.
2.0,These are quite saggy in the butt area (for me). They would be better for some with a little more junk in the trunk. My hips are 34.5 in. I returned them for a smaller size but the fit remains the same.
2.0,The suit fabric was ideal. I would have been highly pleased with it had it not been for the fit and cut. The sleeves on the jacket were short and the pants appeared to be 2 sizes too small. This item appear to be cut for a petite teenager size 12 and  not a US average height/weight size 12 female adult. I've noticed other comments mirror my experience.
2.0,too big and saggy
2.0,not bad gloves... but way to small for a large... if the chinese want to sell to the U.S. they will have to get there sizing charts straight...
2.0,Size down! I’m a 0g but it doesn’t have any smaller sizes so I wasted my money
2.0,Did not fit my chest so i gave it to a friend.
2.0,the product was not as detailed in the picture but it is okey
2.0,They felt great and fit well but first day wearing them they ripped by back pockets  I still use then but only for around the house.
2.0,The cut is boxy and unflattering. The fabric also feels cheap.
2.0,Not really a compression shirt and should not be categorized as such
2.0,"Nice dress buy way too small!!! It’s made for someone with no butt or boobs. Flat as a board on both ends,"
2.0,"I’m super bummed! The backs that these came with aren’t even close to being strong enough to hold these in your ears. I tried some other backs that I had and they weren’t tight enough either….. so if I can ever find backs that work I will update my review. They are super cute however if you find success, the wood is not real wood but they look great."
2.0,"If I wanted to wear this to work, great. For a date night out- not so much. The fabric was thicker than anticipated and the middle part was too wide and/or thick. It was larger than I thought it would fit. But I think the medium would've been too tight."
2.0,"I think due to the item being very small and looking at the reviews, ordering 2 sizes UP than I usually would- reflects my review/2 stars. If it fit, to it's size, it would be an adorable shirt. I like the look and style of it, unfortunately not the sizing."
2.0,"I liked the color, but I'm a small in everything and this ran a bit too small for me. Didn't flatter my body like all my other leggings. Too bad because it's cute."
2.0,These glasses are definitely not oversized. Don't waste your money.
2.0,"The adapter was too big for the pin, and the bale is large for the proportion of adapter to pin. I filed it down to fit, but the pin doesn't hang right, tilts forward awkwardly. I'll try it on a larger pin, but didn't work with a small pin."
2.0,Disappointed! Didn't get any of the ones I wanted.  And got double of some
2.0,Didn't work think battery dead.
2.0,I purchased the charms based on the picture listed for the product.  Very disappointed that I did not receive the item listed. Submitted a refund request.
2.0,Didn’t like the back neck and ran small around hips!  Beautiful color green and very soft!
2.0,Band only holds for a while then the thin piece of plastic that attaches band to watch breaks.
2.0,fit was not good
2.0,Tenny tiny
2.0,Fabric not as expected
2.0,Cute dress. Y tv tight
2.0,"I loved the fit of these and was very disappointed to find that there was no buttonhole. I returned them and ordered another pair. Same problem. Seriously lacking in Quality Control. Lucky for me I had bought another size - a bit small, but at least they had a buttonhole and I was able to wear them on my trip last weekend."
2.0,"I was very excited about finding a collapsible hat for my cheer routine but disappointed in the quality of the product. The hat was used in a cheer routine for about 30 seconds (6-8 times). Hat is on mat in collapsed position. Athlete picks up hat, extends it, puts it on his head, runs to front of mat, takes it off his head, collapses it and puts it down at front of mat. The cheerleaders practiced the routine 6-8 times including the part mentioned above with the hat. By the end of the practice, the hat was stuck in the collapsed position and wouldn’t extend anymore. The material on the sides of the hat had 4-5 very small holes around it, The holes may have come from the material getting stuck/pinched by the extending/collapsing mechanism of the hat."
2.0,"This dress is SO awkward if you are curvy. The top area has no stretch and just looks STRANGE around your girls. I don't know how people are rocking this unless they are stick straight, no curves. Returned."
2.0,"I got outfits for my 5 and 3 year old, I went by the size chart and it was way too small.<br />The 5/6 is like a 4T, the 4t is like a 2-3T .<br />The shirts are nice material, but the sweaters are poor quality, they are super thin, and are a bit see through. The pants are ok material but they are a bit rough.<br />I’m very disappointed on the outfits, if they were better material and actually fit, they would be super cute!"
2.0,looks nothing like the picture....the gears look like a decal painted or glued on....doesn't look like real gears...they really look nothing at all like the picture.
2.0,"These arrived nicely packaged. No damage to shipping.  I was excited to get them. They are soft, but are made VERY small. These are womens gloves. They were too tight for me, and so I gave them to my 13 year old daughter, thinking they would fit her much better. She is a slim girl. Unfortunately, they are way too tight for her too. She is in great shape and should have at least fit her. These will not fit you unless you are VERY slim. These are better off for a young girl, probably 10 or younger. I am actually going to give them to my 6 year old granddaughter. They will fit her.If they would have fit at least my daughter, I would have given more stars because they are really cute. I am very disappointed. My daughter and I love gloves like this. I usually crochet them and was hoping these would fit. I guess it is back to crocheting them for us."
2.0,This arrived promptly today but I am disappointed.  It is about 2&#34; shorter than any other workout tanks and I am average height at 5'6&#34;.  The material is extremely thin and not any type of dry fit material.  For $25 it is definitely not worth it!  I guess you are paying for the cute screen print and not the quality of the tank.
2.0,The product was not as advertised on amazon or in picture seller placed.
2.0,Fit is way to small at least 2 sizes smaller then advertised.
2.0,"This is not what I expected.  I like the material, but I wanted to use it for a bathing suit cover up, which is what it is called, but it is bigger than I wanted and goes below my knees and that's not what the picture shows on the small person wearing it."
2.0,"This ""sweater"" looks nothing like the picture.  It is so thin that it is see through. It is so cheap looking too.  It is a thin, scratchy material.  It MUST be worn with an undershirt. It does lay in a fairly flattering way, but that is its only redeeming quality."
2.0,"Very small, a lot of loose strings inside the mittens. Runs small."
2.0,No. I thought the diameter of the case was gonna be larger. When I saw diagram of the watch being worn. The case looked bigger.
2.0,"I like the way it fit, but, it just did not stay. The adhesive was not strong enough to hold the bralet  in place."
2.0,The bottoms did not fit me quite how i wanted. I'm about 5'2 110-115 lbs and I guess its made for girls that have bigger hips. The quality was ok but just didn't fit my body type :(
2.0,"The black band looks nice but is hard as a rock. I've been working it to try to get it to shape my wrist better, but it doesn't give. Feels like I'm wearing a handcuff all day. Disappointed."
2.0,"As described cards don't fit inside. Returns are not free, so no point in returning this item!"
2.0,Not pretty in person! Also not a cotton blend as described. Will be returning.
2.0,"Sending this back made me sad. I really wanted to love it. First, it's cut kind of odd. I have a pretty average length torso and the waist was set way too high which made the top tight and way too low. The material is thin, but not see through. Be careful what undergarments you wear or they might shine through. It was soft and silky, which felt good on the skin and I had no problem returning it when it didn't fit right."
2.0,"These sandals are not a good quality.  I have a pair of the Bruce's toes ring sandals by the same company, and they are great!  But not these.  I've only had these about a month, and already the bottoms of the shoes, especially the heels, are wearing out!  The top part is not good quality either.  They are not comfortable for a job where you stand a lot either.  I am very disappointed in these!!"
2.0,The top fits great but the bottoms aren’t a large they are a small/medium and are useless.
2.0,"Material feels sturdy and warm (though I never tested it outside)<br /><br />The stitching on one of the buttons seemed to be really loose and coming undone.<br /><br />I tried on the jacket, and it seemed nice enough, except that the sleeves looked like 3/4 sleeves. They would need to be about 6-8&#34; longer to fit. I am tall and thin, 6'1 and 150 lbs. I ordered a 36R (XL) which should have fit. But those sleeves were just ridiculously short, returned it."
2.0,The umbrella was a great size however it broke the first time my daughter used it.
2.0,It’s a really cute purse. But was smaller in person.
2.0,Very big for a child. I had to cut an entire strap down and modify it for it to work and fit nicely on my 4 and 7 year old.
2.0,The waist band isn’t stitched in place so it tends to tangle up and twist inside of the fabric. It’s hard to get straight again.
2.0,I returned this... I was not a fan. The fabric was gauzy and completely see through and felt cheap. It also fit badly - the top was small and the bottom part looked like two strange fabric flaps to me.
2.0,It’s not as fancy as I thought. It’s still nice
2.0,My ear holes are too small so I gave them away.
2.0,I really really liked this mask but the black pieces that hold the ear loops on broke after two washes in the washer. Otherwise would highly recommend
2.0,Many loose threads all along the sleeves. Not recommended.
2.0,"These shoes are cute if you're looking for bling to add to your outfit. However, I wouldn't recommend dancing in them. The straps are very thin and cheap."
2.0,It has plenty of pockets and places for Molly fasteners. I just can’t get it organized for my medical needs.
2.0,"I only received two of the five bags I paid for...<br />Otherwise The two bags I received are decent. So, two stars for two bags."
2.0,It's very soft and a decent size but thw beack and feet are a neon yellow and the pocket had a whole that can't be fixed by hand.
2.0,Crack within 3 days
2.0,Feels comfortable but the size should go up to atleast 2X or XXL and bulge size is slightly under sized.. (7oz in a 5oz bag) gonna have spillage..
2.0,These run about 2 sizes small
2.0,BEAUTIFUL EARRINGS BUT TOO SMALL .<br />SIZE SMALLER THAN A PEA.
2.0,"I got the largest size for my boyfriend who has a huge size 14 feet and they were way too small he couldn’t even get his foot in, will be returning if I can"
2.0,Nice but too small for adults with regular size wrist. Sent back but no refund given yet
2.0,"I usually wear medium. But bought a large in gray and in black. Black is so small I cannot wear them. Gray can be worn, but very skinny legs/hips and large waist."
2.0,Sizing was off. Shirt was small.
2.0,"It runs small, did not fit."
2.0,"Rise is ridiculously low. If you are looking for riding gear, these will sit below crack level when seated. You can tuck in your shirt but the fit may not be comfortable when seated. This will also make it highly likely the pants wont protect you in an off because they will slide off your body due to poor fit. Only purchase if you have a tailor that can alter the rise, some will not do this."
2.0,Very uncomfortable on the bicep. Too loose on the wrist.
2.0,The fabric is see through and the seams aren't perfectly sewn. But it is an okay blouse once you put a shell underneath it.
2.0,Not what i expected. Can't use in summer due to the fabric material. Also it's so tight and less flexible makes you suffocate.
2.0,"I must say I was pretty disappointed by this purse. I've never had a problem with COPI purses before, I have three of them now (two backpack style purses and one bucket bag, this would've been my second bucket purse) and they're all awesome. I decided to spend a little extra money on this one and figured it would be the better of the other 3, but when I opened the box and put the purse over my shoulder, it felt like it was made of flimsy rubber, not faux leather. The color was spot on though, decent size too, it would've been perfect if the material was better quality or even similar to the other less expensive COPI purses I have. I even went as far as pulling on the strap thinking it wold stretch like rubber (it did not). The entire purse was just flimsy and had all the characteristics of rubber - smell, texture,<br /><br />The only reason I'm even giving this purse 2 stars is because the color was nice and the size was good, medium sized bucket bag. Buy it bothered me too much that I felt like the entire thing was made of rubber."
2.0,"This handbag is every bit as beautiful in person as it is in the photos, however, the inside of the bag smells awful. It smells like fish. I sprayed Febreze on the inside and left it open for 3 days to air out before putting my things in it. The odor has never gone away. I love the look and the roominess of the bag so I’m definitely going to keep it, I’ve just got to figure out how to get rid of the fishy smell. If it wasn’t for the odor, I would have given this purchase 5 stars."
2.0,My husband is a police officer and his prior band broke. I thought I was buying a thin blue line band but it looks more like a thin purple band. Although it arrived very quickly and in great condition I am not sure that this will work.
2.0,"Was baggy and weird.... ordered scooting to my measurements and was too large, but the arms/shoulders were too tight. The fabric quality wasn’t great either. Very disppointed in this product and I returned it."
2.0,Beautiful but way too big (and im not scared of bigger jewelry but) I can't imagine dancing at my wedding with these heavy earrings.  They are pretty though.
2.0,"Phone-Ring broke the day I got it, the image behind the ring started scraping immediately. Keychains are ok, they sound like cheap dog tags, though. Buttons are cute, bigger than expected, but not too much faith in the quality of any of this stuff. But, I guess you get what you pay for. Wouldn’t buy again."
2.0,Get AT LEAST one size bigger than you normally get when you buy shorts.
2.0,"I bought the red polka dot version of this dress in a medium and it fit like a dream. I went back for the striped one and it was like it was a different dress. Very short-waisted, hem uneven, sleeves much shorter than the red polka dot. It was not flattering at all and looked like it was a factory second. I returned it immediately after trying it on."
2.0,Didn’t like fabric
2.0,Though it's cheap; quality is not that great.
2.0,"It looked really cute online, but was disappointed when I received it. It didn’t fit right at all. It was longer than expected, almost a dress, and even though I have a large chest, and bought a large, it hung off me in a strange way. Disappointed"
2.0,"I bought these for my daughter's birthday. She wore them once and then one of the sneakers lights stopped working. Despite charging they never worked again. Unfortunately because I had purchased them in advance and gave them to her as a gift, it was too late to return or exchange them."
2.0,Love the fit but unfortunately they are see through. Hate when I see other women with this problem so you can imagine how disappointed I was!
2.0,"It's cute, but it's short. I'm 5'9&#34; and I have a longer torso, it won't even stretch long enough to snap at the crotch. Disappointed."
2.0,They do not come up to elbows unless it’s for children
2.0,"Im 5'4"" and it fits long, like mid thigh long. If it was shorter it would have been perfect."
2.0,Belt was too small for a plus size dress.
2.0,"It is cute but, doesn’t stretch, it’s only about the size of my hand and barely fits over my head. The pictures do not give an accurate representation of how it really looks."
2.0,Pretty flimsy not very big
2.0,fit is completely boxy and the fabric is super stiff. doesn't drape/contour to your body at all. feels like wearing an apron or something. definitely not soft or breathable like you would expect from actual linen.
2.0,"The fit of this shirt is VERY large. I'm always a Medium, and a small would have fit me just fine. The Medium is like a large..or even XL on me. Unfortunately, I was too late to return it, so I'm stuck with it and will probably give it away. Material seems very soft, though...I just wish it fit me."
2.0,"I got 2 pink tags (one light pink and one magenta) You should expect to receive one black and one white tag<br />The rest of the tag colors were fine, but I am giving them away! I only kept the black and the two pinks.<br /><br />+ Tags were bigger than anticipated (they look tiny in the picture)<br />+ They've got cool airplanes on them<br /><br />- Made of low quality PVC type material<br />- Some tags are packaged with different material, and thus the product differs slightly in texture from tag to tag<br /><br />I would not buy this again! I would get leather tags with a flap to cover the name."
2.0,"Cheap made , some of them were broken at first time using!!!!"
2.0,Made in China. lol
2.0,Very sloppy fitting.  Ok to lounge around in but would not wear it out.
2.0,"When buying this product, be aware that whatever size you wear (if you're American), you'll need to size them up 1 or 2 sizes.  I loved the look of the product, but when you buy stuff these days, you never know what you are going to get.  Not sure why a size 38 isn't just a size 38.  What so hard about using a measuring tape when making this stuff and making sure it's the right size.  Baffles me."
2.0,"A bit more flimsy & cheap looking in person. Rises a lot if you have any real curves (butt, hips, legs). Not worth the purchase."
2.0,"My hat and my replacement hat were both broken. The glue holding the tricone together with the velcro was undone on both hats. The trim is also very sloppy. Furthermore, this item is delivered in a bag and not a box. It is by default being destroyed during delivery. It is a shame. It would be beautiful without the design flaws, and terrible shipping method."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:d7ecd4d63db6fcdf3e01c21ba58793c6]] Beautiful mask great idea but after wearing 2-3times half the mask will glow.
2.0,"Headlight was poor. Does not light very well. I ended up using the flashlight on my iPhone for visibiiity in the road.<br />The stitching on the vest, the reflective part to the yellow vest started unraveling... pretty poorly constructed."
2.0,"Says that there are 6 and only 5 came in the pack. They came in a tangled mess. I have 6 girls coming to the party, only 5 will get a necklace now. Too late to try and get the extra sent out, party in 2 days :o/"
2.0,Came dirty.
2.0,I thought it was very cute but it broke before I had a chance to wear it. It wasn't worth the hassle of trying to return as I only paid a couple of bucks for it
2.0,"Too small.  I could not get it over my hand.  I asked my friend with a smaller hand, and she could not get it on her hand either.  It looks nice though."
2.0,"Purchased this because it looked a bit long but not too long, which I wanted, like the picture of her tucking in the shirt (or so I thought). When I received it, the color was not dark maroon. It was more a light pink and I purchased the large, because that’s my normal size. It fit but the length was not long. It fit normal and hung a little on the sides. I went back to look at the pic and realized, it’s like an U shape (Face palm). I returned this. Warning, colors maybe a bit lighter"
2.0,The design of these bracelets is poor - open end gets caught in other bracelets and stuck in clothing.
2.0,"This material is super thin and cheap appearing - almost see through. The design is poorly made, It was not as I was expecting"
2.0,"Great fit but completely see-through. Unless you plan to wear a shirt to cover below your butt, don't buy! Even with no undies, nothing is left to the imagination.."
2.0,Cut small but cute. Gave it away
2.0,The bottom fit just fine but the top was too big.  There are no hooks or clasps for adjusting so I had to pin it at the last minute
2.0,"Order way up. I normally wear a large, ordered an extra large. It's still uncomfortably snug. Also, the screen printing is very plasticy and stiff. It's loud when anything brushes against it. You definitely get what you pay for."
2.0,"After having had this belt 2 years, the durability is questionable. Not just this brand but most ratchet type belts are bonded leather. They're layers of leather sort of laminated together.<br />Invariably these layers start to delaminate and come apart and curl up at the edges. Too bad, the buckle and the ratchet function well but the leather portion just doesn't stand up."
2.0,Loved the beautiful material and colors. Very unhappy with size..arrived much too small..could not order another as replacement size not available.
2.0,"Very cheap looking, sorry, just being honest.  Reviews help make wise purchasing decisions."
2.0,Not impressed. Very beautiful. Perfect size... had it less than 24 hours and it has already turned my finger green..
2.0,This tank top does not fit well at all. The straps are WAY too long which makes it to where the front/back of the shirt won't fit right.
2.0,toe ring to small unconfortable to ware
2.0,Doesn’t fit a business card inside
2.0,"I knew what I was buying and I did it anyway because I fell in love with the graphic line skull. However, this is how they came out of the package. I probably should have looked at a dollar store for these, but I really wanted them when I wanted them. 😞"
2.0,"The fabric was better than expected based on reviews, but the shoulders puff out way more than the pics shown here. It is also very big. I'm a 34DDD and a 5/6. I was swimming in this Medium."
2.0,High volume low detail and quality
2.0,The quality seems to be decent but the pants are huge!
2.0,Son muy pequeñas.
2.0,I’m 66” tall and 39-31-39”<br />I bought the medium. It just seemed to hang strangely on me. The fabric is soft. The pockets push out from your hips and give a strange shape. I think a smaller busted and shorter person probably looks best in this.
2.0,Cute. Looks like picture. Sturdy quality except the Velcro. She was only able to wear them 2 times before the velcro &#34;stopped&#34; working. Otherwise it would've been a 5*
2.0,"From everything I read, I needed a medium. And I wear a medium in plenty of other brands. But this medium was too tight after one wash, and after two washes, it was at least 1 1/2 inches shorter than other mediums I have. Tightness aside, the length is inadequate."
2.0,Didn’t like that the lace was sticking up and away from the dress on top of the shoulders.
2.0,Didn’t fit - where is my refund ?
2.0,If you have a large to extra-large head this will not stretch out your hat enough. Great quality. Well-made. Just too small.
2.0,"So small! I ordered the 9c-13c size (my son wears a 12c) and they are seriously so tiny. The foot area doesn't even cover half of his foot. So disappointed! They were exactly what I was looking for, but the sizing is way off!"
2.0,Sent it right back
2.0,The clips don't hold very well. Expecially with smoother fabric. Everything else is satisfactory.  However that one flaw makes the product unusable on certain articles.
2.0,Poor quality looks nothing  like  picture thick ugly zipper like a jacket zipper
2.0,Not enough protection
2.0,This thing should be labeled as lingerie rather than a dress.
2.0,"I'm a little perplexed by the high ratings here. These are so thin and weak they're like a glorified pair of panty hose. And they weren't symmetrical. I don't know, maybe the first users got the better batch, but I'll never order another pair."
2.0,"The quality of the dress was not at all what was described.  It was not flattering at all.  I'm a thick, and beautiful woman, and this dress was just not a good fit."
2.0,"They are so cute, but I can't wear them again because they got all fuzzy and frayed all around my fingers."
2.0,Nice dainty piece
2.0,"It looks cheap,  the fir around hood is much thinner than expected, and the jacket in general just looks cheap. I will return if I can."
2.0,"The shoe itself is well made and sturdy but the inside front but is not comfortable at all. With it being reinforced in the front, it’s pretty painful on the toes."
2.0,This bag was a good deal and looked cute but was overtaken by the smell. I tried to wait until it aired out before I returned it but after 2 weeks it still smelled and it was to late to return.
2.0,"I think it looks really cheap, I don't see myself wearing it unless it's Halloween."
2.0,"Package arrived quickly and was well wrapped. Ordered two tank tops in size 2. Colors were nice but material was heavy and material seemed tight. The bottom of the tank top is starting to curl and exposing my child's stomach with the navy one. The rose one fits much better, as it's not as tight and seems to be longer. Two stars for navy and 4 stars for rose."
2.0,"I might have liked this jacket, but it must have been just jammed into the bag. It was completely and hopelessly wrinkled beyond any recognition of what it was. Immediately returned!"
2.0,My last readers were 2.5 so these 3.5 should have done the job. Sadly  they are of no use to me as they seem to be the exact strength as my old glasses. They are made very well. They look great They are marked as 3.5 so I don't understand the problem. 3.5 in the stores are fine but I didn't want to pay $20 for one pair. I guess next time I'll just pay the extra and know the glasses I have in my hand work.
2.0,I purchased this as a gift for my husband on our wedding day. He literally had it for 48 hours and the metal loop that holds the crucifix broke off.
2.0,It was cheap looking. Too tight in the chest and too loose everywhere else.
2.0,See through.  Very boxy. No shape. Reminds me of my maternity dresses.
2.0,Great item it was just too small for me
2.0,"Design is as pictured but that’s where the positive stops.  Feels like plastic and looks cheap.  Submitted to return told I will receive refund with no need to return product, still waiting to see refund but time hasn’t expired."
2.0,A few of the items were not sewn correctly and were not big enough to hold a standard chapstick.
2.0,"You have to wear socks with it,  the inside of the zipper on the ends are hard and hurt your legs."
2.0,I purchased a 2-3T for my 1.5 year old and it was too small. It barely fits over her head! I suggest purchasing a couple sizes up.
2.0,"Will only play on 2W speaker output, or headset -- but not both concurrently.  Misleading description.  Beware before you buy."
2.0,okay for a child and the color is really way different from the original picture
2.0,Really cool item but it broke within a few days.
2.0,"These slippers where delivered on 01/13/2021.  They look like I have had them for years.  I have not washed them, nor wore them outside.  I weigh 135, so why do they look like after only two weeks!"
2.0,It was cute for people under 30
2.0,"lapis stone is too large, cheap necklace"
2.0,"Cute and fit as expected. Unfortunately, appears to be sewn poorly, not sure how long they will last."
2.0,"really thin, more for style not warmth."
2.0,"It was pretty, nice material but fit awkwardly. It was sheer from mid thigh down so I sent back. It is long. I’m 5’8 and it was long on me (ankle length)"
2.0,fit is a little big and the back is see through so you will need to wear  shorts or use it as a coverup
2.0,The dress is not true to size and is defiantly not “loose” fitting. I ordered a 2x and it fits more like a xl. I have other dresses in this style that I love and was looking forward to a solid colors version.
2.0,Honestly I am not happy with my experience so far. The product does not work on my touch screen phone. They are however comfortable.
2.0,seems to be made cheap
2.0,I bought these leggings 5 months ago and absolutely loved them! Perfect fit etc! However the stitching on the seams  tore and the seller has not responded. Perfect leggings except for this!
2.0,"It's very pretty, but really sharp! it scratches when I wear it and just about every piece of clothing gets caught on it."
2.0,I loved this clip. Absolutely loved it. I’m an STNA and 3 days after starting my job this fell on the floor and broke into 4 different pieces and even after I out it back together the string won’t stay in and it is completely useless. Really disappointed honestly. Not sure if I even wanna pay for another bc I’m sure it’ll drop a few times working with dementia patients and it all break so easily apparently
2.0,Smaller than I wanted. So returned. Cute.
2.0,It fell apart 5 minutes after wearing it.  No way of fixing it because it is an issue with soldering and not worth taking to jewler
2.0,Way too small. Not like the picture.
2.0,"It's very cute. But it was too small to fit my ear and when trying to adjust, it broke in half."
2.0,"It's a stretchy polyester feeling shirt. VERY stretchy. And it is a BRIGHT red. Not burgundy like the photo. I am no expert, but I'm PRETTY sure this it not even close to cotton 😬 I'm still gunna rock the shirt because I like pretty much all big tshirts, but it is not what I was expecting at all. Kinda bummed."
2.0,"Cheaply made -- band came off immediately -- wouldn't recommend, other than for pure function."
2.0,The material was very thin you could see through them I could not use them as part of my clown outfit.
2.0,I bought this coat for my daughter as a Xmas gift. She wore it twice and attempted to wear it this morning and the zipper broke. The last time she wore it the elastic strings that attach fur to the hood broke. The coat is very stylish. But the quality of the coat isn’t great. I will be returning. Since the zipper is broke after 2 wears. We can’t do anything with it at this point
2.0,"The material was perfect, the waist was too high in the front but fit great in the back.  I ordered 2 sizes bigger than I wear and fit comfortably accept for the waist.  to be returned.."
2.0,The style was not as expected once I put it on. it seemed to fit awkwardly.
2.0,"Cheap material, clingy, sheer. Not flattering at all."
2.0,"itchy...very itchy, and not really flattering"
2.0,"I ordered two pairs of these glasses.  They were rapidly shipped in one box.  One pair had a nice fabric pouch...the other was in a thin plastic bag.  One pair looked great, the other had some of the printing of the flag scratched or wiped off the lens.  There was no paperwork at all with in the packaging.  I had no way of contacting the actual vendor.....no phone number or email address or even shipping address.  I was very disappointed.  Not because half my order of under $20 was defective, but because I wanted to order 100 pair for a 60s party if I like them.  With a 50% failure rate and no way to contact the vendor I decided not to order these glasses."
2.0,Fabric cheap
2.0,A bit to dark.
2.0,"Although I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the look of this ring, it was not the quality I expected. I ordered a size 8 and apparently these rings run large because it would swivel around my finger. I eventually had to stop wearing it because not only did I have to worry about it falling off my finger, the big center stone FELL OUT. I had only had this ring for about a month when the stone fell out. Would not but this again."
2.0,Based on the pictures online I did not expect the color to be grey/olive. I ordered a medium and product fit looser than I expected. Will be returning.
2.0,I RECEIVED THE ITEM VERY FAST. THE CLASP IS AT A WEIRD ANGLE WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO PUT ON. NOT WORTH IT TO RETURN.
2.0,"If you're just looking for a cloth mask, then these are ok.<br />If you're looking for a cloth mask that holds a filter, then these are a poor choice. The pocket for filters is too big (leaves too much room, no adequate coverage) for the small sized filters provided, and the pocket is too small (the bottom part of the mask's pocket is truncated) for the larger sized filters. If the pocket for filters was large enough for decent filters (or properly designed to work with the small filters they provide) I would have given this 5 Stars, but it's just a cloth mask and the filter pocket is too poorly designed to be of any real good.  A waste of filters to try to use them in it."
2.0,Cheap. Ugly. Looks nothing like images online.
2.0,"It fits about two sizes smaller than you think. I normally wear a small,but ordered an large and it is almost too small. VERY tight"
2.0,"I am think lady with big bust and big bottom. This product did not fit me well at all. It cut in to my butt cheeks and my breast were exposed on the bottom as the cups did not hold them in at all. Even after fully righting the back it was still loose and had a gap. The whole thing just fit awkwardly. Not really worth the hassle to return. I wanted to love this suit. For the price, but it abs try it if you are more evenly proportional and small bust but big rib cage it may fit you just right!!"
2.0,Product looks cheap
2.0,That kind of leather is bad not as I imagined .
2.0,I was so excited that I finally found a 2X NC windbreaker and then as soon as it got here he tried it on and the sleeves were so short it didn’t fit me (his wife 5’6) and we are so terribly disappointed.
2.0,"Excellent product, but not worth the price. Nobody on tour had paid even half of what I paid, and locally they were $5 to $6."
2.0,"Got this for my sister, the strap broke the first day"
2.0,Very cut but cut to small go up two sizes from what you wear
2.0,"Doesn’t look authentic to me compared to other signature watches I buy like that of MK,Burberry and Coach with almost similar price"
2.0,This is a great looking outfit but it runs about 4 sizes too small
2.0,The sewing at the bottom of the legs comes out so easily. I wouldn't By again
2.0,"They're slightly too small, but it's also a really weird shape? Very narrow with extremely pointed toes. I'm between a 7.5-8, ordered an 8, and still found them pinching painfully. I'm so disappointed."
2.0,It's a pretty bracelet.  I could see one of the stones have fallen off the bracelet without opening it.  So why was it sent to me.
2.0,I hated this dress. It was two sizes too big. Very cheap material. It looks like it has white lines running all through the black on the dress. Hate it.
2.0,"5’4 105 lb and got a small. Fit is fine, but the quality is not worth the price. Online the blue shirt mesh part looks soft and pliable. It’s actually stuff and scratchy; almost like a costume."
2.0,I want a refund.
2.0,"Clips did not grip tightly, fabric kept slipping out of the clips."
2.0,"The first color of this bathing suit fit so well I decided to purchase two more colors in the same size- the bottoms fit perfectly, however the tops are way too loose to wear. It’s as if the bottom part of it does t have elastic, so the “shoulder”/ top part is perfect, but if I raise my arms up, I’m completely exposed. This is definitely a hit or miss."
2.0,"Low on support, really doesnt work well  in terms of support when active - running, jumping etc."
2.0,"I ordered a small and it fit like a large. Also, the material is really thick and rigid."
2.0,"The flower is a dingy yellow color, and is off-center from the thing it sits on, and because of thiis you can see all the glue"
2.0,I returned this item. The fading/coloring was so strange. It was like 4 dark patches printed onto the best. it did not look natural.
2.0,"The pretty pattern attracted me to this dress, but it didn't fit like I thought it would at all. This dress IS NOT for a full-figured woman, nor is it for a woman over 5'5"". This dress is made for a petite woman. I'm only 5' 6"" and the dress was too short on me. I couldn't even wear heels with it. I tried to make it work on a couple of occasions, but should have just sent the dress back. Very disappointed!"
2.0,Cheap material.  My toe broke through one of the pairs just two months after getting these.  I probably wore them only a few times.
2.0,"came with a patch that wasn't shown in the picture, the shirt was a different color than what I ordered, as well as the strings, which were an almost neon green and looked horrible with the shirt. and it fit very weird. Not satisfied with this product at all."
2.0,WAS DISAPPOINTED.  STRAP ON ONE SIDE WAS SHORTER THAN OTHER SIDE.  NOTHING I CAN'T FIX BUT I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!
2.0,"It's very big, it was cute though, might have been ok in a cartilage piercing. I had to return it because it was too big for me."
2.0,"I will give this hat 2 stars because it's pretty cute, but the pom came off after ONE WEAR.  The pom is secured onto the hat with 2 tiny little metal bracket-like things.  Well in my effort to make it look a bit more slouchy, I pulled at the the pom and bent the tiny little metal pieces holding it in place and it instantly came off.  Once bent there really doesn't seem to be any fixing them.  I thought I might be able to somehow sew it back on but so far I BROKE A NEEDLE AND broke the thread trying to get it through the holes in the bracket on top of the hat.  I just ordered heavier duty needles and thread so we shall see, but at any rate the whole situation is a little disappointing.  At least it wasn't a very pricey hat.  Also I wish it weren't so thick and didn't have the little brown &#34;CC&#34; tag at the front, as long as I'm complaining, lol."
2.0,"Okay. This one was a letdown. I won't beat around the bush here with this review: the padding looks awful and is super noticeable if you wear anything remotely form fitting. I was hoping to add some curves but that was a negative. Instead it added lumpy ness, just obvious little lumps of padding.<br />I somewhat salvaged the product by taking the butt padding out since I didn't need it anyways and just used the side pads. It looks alright that way but if you're looking at it with any amount of attention you'll be like ""oh hey, those are pads!"" Lol sad day.<br />I wouldn't recommend to buy these."
2.0,Stones fall out easily. Kind of a waste of money
2.0,They are too small. My son was disappointed
2.0,Even my small ears can't use this comfortably. I suspect that ear size is only part of the problem. I think the other issue (and it was for me) is where your earlobe is pierced.  If my hole was higher it might've worked.
2.0,Huge and itchy fabric. Looked and felt cheap as soon as I opened them.
2.0,This is not a true wrap dress in that you cannot adjust at all. It has an elastic band around the waist but it ends up laying right under your bust not the waist. I returned it. The fabric and color was very pretty .
2.0,Nice print. Cheaply made.  You get what you pay for.  Sides don't even begin to come around to the front but that's the design.  Would not buy again.
2.0,"These glasses came early but, they messed up the lenses. The pink ones had blue lenses and the blue ones had orange lenses. I did not even bother to send them back because they looked fine. The blue is darker than what is shown in the picture. The frames of theses glasses feel cheap but not like they will brake if you drop them. The hinges are stiff as well. When I dropped them the reflective coating scratched a little and they are hard to clean. I ended up giving a pair to my niece who is 8 who loved them. She said they are grate for dress up and her friends think the are cool."
2.0,"After receiving the dress,  I had to take it to a seamstress to have 4 inches taken off the bottom, the straps shortened,  and the jacket totally remade. $185.00 later and I'm not happy with having to pay to make the dress wearable to my son's wedding!"
2.0,"I ordered a large, which has worked with similar styled tops, but this one is snugger fitting and shows every imperfection under it. Sending back."
2.0,"The material is cheap, and it's super small. I just gave it to my little sister since it fit her better."
2.0,These look and feel nice but I wish they were sewed better.  The seam busted as soon as I put my leg in and they weren’t too small either. I guess you get what you pay for. Definitely cheaply made.
2.0,"Just from having this hanging from the ignition while driving, the slot that holds the key rings in place gets wider and wider until the key falls out. Poor design, or maybe just cheap metal that bends too easily."
2.0,"The dress was see through,"
2.0,I purchased these mitts for my granddaughter and sadly had to return them because the fabric on the palm of the mitt started to peel back during the first wearing.
2.0,"They were too small, not matching the European size listed; they were not the same as the picture; not the same brand. Plus, it looks like they have polar fleece instead of down inside. I am most upset that they took over a month to get here (missing Christmas present) and I will have to pay to ship them back to China myself, not covered by Prime."
2.0,"These are very cheaply made, but I did only pay very little for them. You get what you pay for"
2.0,I was totally surprised when I received this item. It was more like a gold thread then a chain. It came to me knotted up and took a while to untangle it because the chain is so thin and delicate. I'm worried that it will break without much force.
2.0,Xxxl more like L in united States. Material seems to be decent though some of the buttons look cheap. You get what you pay for.
2.0,"The dress I received was nothing like the photo or description!  It's mostly a thin spandex A-line type dress.  Not free and flowy at all as in the photo or description, and the fabric would not be cool to wear in the summer.<br />Very disappointed!"
2.0,"These are completely useless. They do not hold on to the glasses. They do not actually flip up; rather, they pull off of the glasses. This means that the only way to flip them up is to hold onto your glasses and the clip part of the shades, and then flip up the lenses."
2.0,"Band is good I bought others under separate order. Cover is awful, it fits poorly and is clunky looking. It made my beautiful watch look like junk."
2.0,They did not fit in my nose. They are so tiny and thin.
2.0,The shirt was cute but ran a little on the small side.  I'm usually a large/xl and I got an xl and it was still a little snug. The material isn't the greatest and very thin.
2.0,I loved these earrings and who can go wrong at that price? Perfect size and looked gorgeous. Lost the first stone in a day and the second a day later.
2.0,Not true to size. Fits like a XXL
2.0,Tarnish easy
2.0,Style did not look good on me. The frilly sleeves didn’t compliment me so I returned it.
2.0,"The cover up looks pretty.  However, the size runs very small and the fabric is see-through."
2.0,Quality was less than expected
2.0,Have bought 2 of these and the battery dies within 1 month each time... using consistently for &#60; 10 min per night. Good brightness for the first week or 2.
2.0,"Pics are deceiving.. this is not the material I was hoping for. Its more like a nylon material instead of a soft satin bonnet material. I was looking for more of a soft bonnet for men's beards to sleep in. I'll see if I can find the softer one if not I'll stick with this for now. Seller, please provide accurate photos bc this is not it!!"
2.0,Cheap fabric and poorly made. You get what you pay for.
2.0,Too big for females
2.0,Made with cheap quality product.
2.0,"It’s a really short tank top, and I have an average length torso. I’ve never worn it more than just the one time to try it on."
2.0,It runs small. not true to size
2.0,"Cheap quality, super thin, the stitching is off on the pockets. I'd say this is worth $8 at the most. Returning and buying a better quality cropped sweatshirt."
2.0,"Sizing description was way off. And wasn't enough time to return the item, so I'm stuck with it."
2.0,The hole was too small for the snake chains to go through
2.0,"I ordered the burgundy and the teal dress and both of them were not long enough, they hit above the ankle. I'm 5'8'' and 170 and ordered a large. Other than the dress hitting above the ankle (which I do not like) the dress was cute. Returned."
2.0,....one of the tags was cut somehow.
2.0,The armholes on this dress are abnormally large and weird.  I would only suggest buying it if you are able to tailor it to fit. The material reminds of shirts my grandmother used to wear in a nursing home. Even the tie around the waist is super weird stretchy.
2.0,"Pretty material. This material is t-shirt not sweatshirt.  Extremely long top, sleeves are 5-6"" longer than top."
2.0,I returned it because they sent the wrong size. But the jacket was ok for the price.
2.0,"The padding is weird and loose. The torso is ridículos short and the back is way higher than the one in the picture. The quality is OK I guess, but I'm not happy at all!"
2.0,"I was very careful to order the 22mm band, but I received a 20mm band, which is too small for my 22mm smart watch. Other than that, it's pretty enough. It's not worth the trouble to return it; maybe I'll find a way to make it work for a 22mm lug watch."
2.0,"These are cute and fit well overall. The best part is the high waistband - even for me, with a very long torso, it actually reaches my waist! I haven't found any other affordable leggings that do that. However, there are two main issues with these pants. One, there is no compression or shaping, meaning nothing helping you hold in the tummy or lift the booty. And second, the main problem, is that although the pant seems to fit fine when trying it on, with actual wear the pant leg starts to ride up several inches to the point where it looks like a &#34;high-water&#34; pant. It also does it unevenly on each leg, so it doesn't even look purposeful. I wore these a few times but have stopped wearing them because of this annoying issue (I am 5'6&#34; for reference, but as I said, with a long torso, so my legs are not very long). I would not repurchase even though they are so cheap."
2.0,"I usually wear a size small, but I ordered a medium because the reviews say it fits small. When it arrived it only covered half my butt. After washing and drying it on high, it's cute as a t shirt or bikini coverup."
2.0,size not as described. had to give it a friend
2.0,the size not very confortable
2.0,It definitely does not look like the picture at all. It is very soft though. I would go a size up as well if you want it a bit baggy like the picture
2.0,I bought these socks specifically to have seamless toes. My foot is very narrow and the toe lines rub my toe raw. I’m extremely disappointed in these.
2.0,this is our second pair.  Its a good shoe but the delivery is out 2 months....2 months!!!!!! and all they say is running late.  He'll have outgrown it by the time it gets here.  Would not buy again
2.0,Don’t buy.  It took 10 weeks to arrive from China.  I ordered a large and it is at least a 1X. Cheap price cheap quality.  I used to swim at least once a week and this would be worn out in 2 months.  I tried to return it but have to call Customer Service.  Lost money.
2.0,"Good seller/service but these handkerchiefs are poorly made. They are like snowflakes, no 2 alike. All have something wrong after washing. Loose threads (see picture), out of square (see picture), crumpled.<br /><br />They look great out of the package - perfect in fact. That changes after 1 washing - after 2 they weren't any better, worse in some cases.<br /><br />I do not recommend these. Go to Kohls or any place that sells Dockers brand, they are 10x better. Thicker cotton, tighter weave, bigger size. $12 for 9 pure cotton white, $12 for 6 blue plaid (3 royal blue, 3 gray-blue). The plaid ones are a little bigger. Kohls price is Retail - mine were on sale, 30% less.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on these. Mine are going to Good Will or rag bag. Oh, to be fair, a few of these hankies are fine (not frayed, etc) - but the entire package should be that way."
2.0,Lasted 7 months. Would not buy again.
2.0,"I ordered this shirt my usual size. I couldn't even button it, and it was so short that I could not be tucked in my pants ! The color did look good and appeared to be made of quality fabric, but this shirt runs about three sizes smaller ."
2.0,Soles tear easily
2.0,Fell apart really easily. I'm not sure if it's meant to be used every once and awhile. But I used it every day at work and it fell apart pretty fast. The metal edge started to come off first and then the buckle stopped working. The stainless steel coating comes off like it was painted on.
2.0,Seeing in the back completely crooked.
2.0,Coloring is off. More on the darker side
2.0,"After two weeks of wearing, the inner sole cracked and made them uncomfortable for my little to wear."
2.0,"I’d stick with a $15 pair from the checkout. These were not worth $25. Very cheaply made. Nothing sets them apart from other cheap pairs, which is opposite of the advertisement. I’d say you get what you pay for, but in this case you don’t even get that."
2.0,"Material very light, flimsy."
2.0,"Beautiful workmanship.  The colors are even more vivid than in the picture.  The size is luxurious so all kinds of wearing options are possible, even for someone with a big head like mine.  Definitely going back for two or three more of these.  A top notch product.<br /><br />Update:  first wash and all the tassels come off, in clumps or singly.  Had to use a squeejee to scrape them out of the washer.  Three stars down from my original review!"
2.0,"Very soft, nice fabric, but almost every seam has developed a hole after a few months wear."
2.0,"Scratchy material; boobs barely fit in the top. Loved the color; wasn't enough to keep it, tho"
2.0,I ordered an XL and it fit like a medium. Also I could feel all the seams from where the different sections were sewn together. It did not fit in the cute relaxed style the picture shows.
2.0,"I've been attempting to return 2 of the jumpsuits, and seem to be having the hardest time. It will only allow me to select 1 of the 2 items. I don't want either one. The thread is coming out and it is kind of cheaply made. I would like my money back."
2.0,These broke after only a couple of days of wearing them unfortunately. Super cute though so it you take them off after uses I’m sure they’ll last a lot longer!
2.0,"I put these in as soon as they arrived. One of them kept falling off, after putting it back on for the third time, I lost one of the pieces. Never even got to wear them out, super disappointed."
2.0,"I am a man with a 38"" waist and the straps are too short to tie in a bow behind me. No way they would wrap around and tie in front. I have three other aprons and this apron has the shortest straps of them all. If you are quite petite they would be OK.<br /><br />Good apron otherwise, although overall on the smaller size."
2.0,"Hmmmm... not a Pancake tutu.  Even if we tighten it, ruffle it... cannot get it to go out.  Doesn’t  look like the picture at all.  Although it is white, and fits. So that’s a positive."
2.0,The tie clips that I got are very faded in color.<br />They are a hint of black or gold. But frankly look silver. The dimensions are ad stated.
2.0,"This is not 100% pure silk, it feels like it is blended with another fabric, it is ok for a practice veil, however, if you need something professional it needs to be 100% pure silk for both the colors and the movement for dance. If it is silk it is definitely not the best of quality. I am sorry I was disappointed I really wanted to love this veil because of the color which was not as bright as the pictures, I was going to return it however my nephew who is a beginner dancer loves it so I gave it to him and ordered another one from a different company that was able to provide better quality silk. Like I said it is fine for a beginner not so much for professional or on-stage performance. It also had huge static issues which can also be an indicator of the fabric issue. I gave this product 2 stars because the delivery was super fast and it was not a total loss, was able to put it to good use. Just be aware if you are used to 100% good quality silk you will definitely notice a difference. If you have nothing to compare it with like my nephew who is a beginner it should be fine. However, I would hands down chose this over a chiffon veil if I had to."
2.0,"my husband got this for me but i don't like it. the material is okay, not great. the top has some kind of a push when you tie the strings. I just don't think it looks good."
2.0,Bought these for my husband and had to return them. They looked ok but they were not warm at all.
2.0,good but a bit small
2.0,The shoe felt like it had absolutely no support whatsoever.
2.0,"Did not like these at all.  I ordered the non-fleece leggings-- if you can call them that.  They're more like really, really thick knitted tights.  They're not completely opaque like legging type pants.  I can still see my skin through them and I'm not a big girl-- 5'5&#34;, 130 lbs for reference.  I really don't know what the positive reviews were about.  Very disappointed, these are going back."
2.0,"The shoes are nice, but you get what you pay for. I wanted inexpensive shoes for my 5 year old son, but the tongue constantly falls down to the point that he won't wear them. I'm going to try to sew it in place or add a loop to secure it to the laces to use as a backup pair because I already went ahead and bought him a new pair."
2.0,"This is a nice color, soft but a very weird fit. I ordered the size small and it was very big through the shoulders."
2.0,Very cheap.<br />The shells are very large and gold chain it too long. Both necklaces are too long.
2.0,The material looks pretty cheap and the color is not the color in the photo
2.0,It looks good but the numbers are too small and the light is too weak.
2.0,"It Cleans glasses well, but that's about it. Didn't receive the special anti fog cloth, so I contacted the company and 2 weeks later received the cloth. Tried it with the cloth following the directions to a T, and it did nothing to prevent or reduce lenses fogging. No clue what all the other reviewers are talking about. It literally did nothing."
2.0,"I wouldn't say this is a &#34;sweater&#34; per se, as it is thin and tight, though you can see that from the photo.  The material is nice and thick, so it would definitely keep you warm, but this &#34;sweater&#34; is way too small, even though I bought a medium.  Returning."
2.0,"Mother is 95 and doesn’t have a cell phone which is needed in order to correctly use the device.  So, we sent it back."
2.0,"fit a little more snug than I like. Red much brighter than I thought so I wish I had gotten the blue. It kinda makes you look bigger than you are just because of the empire waist. Fit is just off. Im tall also and it is shorter than I like a maxi to be.  If I was the type to return stuff, this would be one I sent back."
2.0,The neck could be slimmer and the torso is pretty long. Fit nicely otherwise
2.0,not as pictured. enlarged in photo and dull instead of shiny.
2.0,The first day I used it the material holding the clip broke.
2.0,Only came with one pair not two like it says?
2.0,The coat was a nice fabric and a pretty red however to close the jacket you had to button all 5 buttons. It had a weird fit after button up. I'm a 36 d and the chest and shoulders were very tight with a heavy shirt on.
2.0,I loved the size but after having it in my nose for 24 hours it turned green. This is not all surgical steel or it would not have turned green. I can only wear surgical steel that’s why I bought it. Also the post could have been shorter.
2.0,Didn’t look as nice as the picture but I put a belt on it and for the price it was worth it
2.0,"Regardless what this company want, I'll not change her name to match the necklace they sent.  ""Victoria"" is a nice name but it isn't ""Abigail"".  Yes, they sent the wrong necklace.  Daughter thought I was pulling a prank on her.  I think they put it in a gift box in case we ever meet a Victoria.  I'll give a positive in that it was securely sealed when it arrived."
2.0,"It was too small and shorter than I wanted.  However,  I kept it for my 18 year old daughter because the material is lightweight and the dress is cute and well made."
2.0,So I got bracelets instead of the scarf so a little confused but my cousin liked it anyways so Ig it’s ok this time
2.0,Damaged but most are beautiful i put them in and theyre so small everything is in my nose. Cant see them on top of some are impossible to wear.
2.0,"Slightly shorter than more Similar sized hoodies i've had, But sleeves are 6+ inches too long.  Quality seems decent."
2.0,"Thought this was going to be ""my answer to keep my suspenders off my skin.  It works for that but catches or pulls leaving ""scars"" on the fabric.  Too late to return.  Looks like I need to keep looking for an answer to my problem."
2.0,Be aware that he size is for Asian women; it is so much smaller than US size. The pants are too short even for Asian women though. It is warm and soft. Its lint is all over on the first wash too.
2.0,Doesn't look like rose gold.
2.0,These are gorgeous earrings but the Zirconia started falling with in the first 2 weeks. I believe these are meant to be worn occasionally.
2.0,"Shorts came without the liner, inaccurate description."
2.0,"The glasses are really cute; however, the feel is very cheap and flimsy. Unfortunately I returned them for that reason."
2.0,Pants were incorrectly sized!
2.0,The belt is not easy to use and the zipper on one pocket broke after one wash.  Would not buy this product again.
2.0,This dressed came with a stain on the front and the back. I put in the washing machine with bleach the stains didn't come out. I still wore it while on vacation in Cuba and it ripped. My booty cheeks were out and I ended up having to wear it backwards with my thigh exposed! I really liked this dress but it's no good now...
2.0,"This dress is ok. The reason I would rate this ok, because it is this and you can see through the material."
2.0,"They break easily. You get what you paid for. So if you don't want the hassle of replacing a necklace every time one breaks, find one with better quality. Or stick to chains."
2.0,They arrived damaged (missing a plastic eye thingy) and I forgot to send them back so I wore them anyway and was told I looked like an alien bcuz of how close the lenses were together and how they angle out a bit. These are not really suited for big face folks lol
2.0,I loved this shift when I got it but the letters and heart washed off after just TWO WASHES! Very disappointed.
2.0,need to stretch a little more
2.0,"Eh, disappointed.  Gave it 2stars because it is pretty and design and colors are as pictured, however, material is upsetting.  The shirt is shiny, someone referred to athletic wear and I feel that's right. Stretchy and shiny.  I think I might wear it to bed, but not out of the house. its a cheap shirt and looks cheap. I ordered a large expecting it to run small but still wanting a looser fit, a medium would have been better for the look I wanted (I'm 5'4&#34; 125 and a small would have also fit fine based on the fit of the large).  It also came quicker than I anticipated, only took like 2 weeks."
2.0,"Whatever adhesive they use is just not it! Them things popped off so easy just with me putting them on my crocs. If your going to purchase, have some super glue on deck some strong glue too! Also be aware of the rhinestone itself because some of mine tended to fall out of the grip as well! But they were cute at first!"
2.0,okay product.
2.0,Very petite size.. for a pregnant women
2.0,The top did not have the curve of my wrist and so the bracelet did not sit well on it. Returned.
2.0,"These are a pair of low quality cheap sweatpants. Its the kind of pants I'd expect to find in the bargain bin of the local discount store. They're paper thin and fit like a paper bag -- baggy and loose and all stretched out. They're described as having a drawstring, but its just a string sewn to the pants (off-center) that doesn't change the fit or tighten the waistband the way a true drawstring should do. Its completely pointless since it serves no purpose other than decorative (and since its off-center, it just looks ""off"" rather than neat). They also seem confused over what purpose these pants serve -- the title calls them ""Lightweight trousers . . Casual pants"", but read further and they're called sleepwear. I would probably wear these as pajamas, but they're definitely not trousers and certainly not worth the $25+ price tag. Save your money -- there are far better sweatpants/PJs that cost less than this or spend the same amount and get a pair of higher quality pants -- these are really cheap garbage."
2.0,Very fashionable but doesn't do a good job in keeping you warm.
2.0,"Comfortable, though definitely has a chemical odor - makes me wonder about the quality of silicone and what other chemicals (pthalates?) could be seeping out.  I let it air for a few days, washed it a couple times, and have worn it for four months straight.  No issues until this week, when the little silicone keeper broke.  Now the band catches on everything and unhooks itself.  The price was right, but the quality is &#34;meh.&#34;  I'm shopping for a different replacement band, would not buy this again."
2.0,Very small. I ordered larger size and still to tight.
2.0,These need to come in different sizes.  It isn't large breast friendly.
2.0,"Pretty case, exactly as shown. However, this case started to immediately pick up colors from other objects. I've had it five days and It's slightly pink from being in side my burgundy purse, which why I replaced my last case. However, I had my last case five - six months before it started to do this. So if the color changing from white (honestly, it wasn't bright white when I received it) to whatever the phone is in contact with bothers you, I wouldn't suggest this case.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've changed the rating from 3 to 2 star. After two weeks, the case is so discolored, I'm ordering a different one from vendor. The back is so pretty, I'd hoped to have this a long time. But after trying to clean the white part with alcohol and then a bleach cleaner, I can't stand to carry it because the white part looks so bad. This was a waste of money."
2.0,way too big looks like it would fit a slim adult
2.0,This was shipped quickly however it is much smaller in person than the photo makes it look. Had to return.
2.0,This dress fit as expected & was I initially happy with it. I had it on for a few hours when I noticed that the fabric where my purse touched my hip was all distressed. It’s very noticeable & now pretty much unwearable.  I would only recommend this dress if it’s for a one-time event & you won’t have to carry a purse while wearing it.
2.0,Not flattering!!
2.0,I really liked these shoes however the heels have already completely peeled down to the metal post.
2.0,"This product is more of a hooded cape than a long cloak. It goes down a little past my knees but the advertised pictures show it pooling on the ground. I am only 5'4"" even though I am plus size it still should have been much longer as advertised than what I actually got."
2.0,Ran small and very thin material. Sent back
2.0,"I wished this fit correctly.  Too high at the waist and too big at the top. Doesn't fit shoulders correctly.  My mistake for ordering a size up as suggested.  The knot thing just looks weird, and would rather it fit below the waist and not above."
2.0,Bigger than size indicates
2.0,"I pay for prime but shipping was ridiculous took over a week, a little larger than expected too but for the price I'll keep it. larger than a quarter"
2.0,"Nice but tooooo many not working, little pieces off and could not tell where from.  Had to keep tossing too many but those few that worked were loved by the kids, very disappointed in amount that could not be used! Waste of my money!Could not keep around daycare and to far to return this product(caribbean)but if you purchase these, save to send back to have them replaced as you lose more than you gain!  Never me again!"
2.0,The smaller stones in this ring fall out.
2.0,Cute but VERY cheap material. The black choker part feels like felt. I know these will break soon but I'll enjoy them til then. Good for a costume but Im sure every day wear will break it down in no time.
2.0,Their over all appearance just fell flat with me. They looked low quality.
2.0,I agree with the other ladies on this skirt that it runs small! I normally wear 12 and got a XL and it fit like a medium! I would definitely recommend getting 2 sizes up from what your normal dress size is!
2.0,Wanted to love these because they are so cute but they broke the day I got them :( where the moon connects to the bottom star broke off on its own while I was wearing the earrings. I wish the company would send me a new pair
2.0,"I ended up returning it for two reasons. The first is that from what I understood reading the product description (in the sections about the buttons) this one had functional buttons. The brick red short sleeve does not have functional buttons. I had intended to use it as a nursing dress so this was disappointing. Also, as someone with a large bust the fit was awkward- the elastic came up too high and created a weird shelf.<br />If I could figure out which ones had functioning buttons I might be willing to give the product another try."
2.0,"It’s very flattering at the top but the bottom when wet clings to every area. If you are hoping this will hide the areas you would rather not show off, this is not the one for you. The top portion is very flattering however."
2.0,It was broken when it arrived. I was really disappointed.
2.0,Falling apart at the stitches within a few months and doesn't fit under seat
2.0,"She said they do not fit and I'm glad because for the price, the quality is low.  Very low.  We walk a lot and they wouldn't last a month."
2.0,"Too small, so I couldn't try it on for a real review. The material seemed ok. Overall it was a fail."
2.0,"The quality is not the best, I would not recommend for a kid or teen because how rough children usually are. the pom poms are not attached very well, it is held on by 2 stitches and I could see them falling off after a few wears or with adults by the end if the season. The pom poms are also of very poor quality, and they are not as big as the picture shown. You get what you pay for. It will work if you just want to wear it for a few outings.  I would definitely suggest paying a few more dollars for a quality hat. But I must say it looks totally cute on me ;)"
2.0,"way smaller than picture leads you to think it is. says it's &#34;.06&#34; but 0.6 of what? we must guess? Or use the second metric measurements which no true American has used since Thomas Jefferson rejected them? I don't remember what 15mm looks like! So I'm figuring it's like the size of a quarter, but it's quite smaller than a dime, so much so that you can't see the intricate celtic cross's scrolling knots without a eagle eye vision and a close magnifying glass. certainly quite overpriced for such a TINY bauble."
2.0,"Seems to be made out of good material. However, i ordered this a size up from my normal jacket size and it fits 2 sizes smaller than my normal size. Very disappointed. Considering returning it, but could make a nice christmas present for someone smaller."
2.0,"I waited forever for these. I hate to give it 2 stars because the costumer service was really nice when I questioned the shipment. I understood it was coming from out of state and with the Rona at large would definitely take some time but it was about a month and half before i got these and by that time i was already up a size. So the real reason I'm giving these 2 starts is because of the quality.  It's fine that they were just plastic, totally cool with that but as I was screwing it back in it got stuck and it now stuck that way forever. Completely unusable and ungiftable. The graphic itself was great though. *thumbs up*"
2.0,Shipping took forever. I like my skinny jeans to be tight all the way to the ankle but the ankle/calf area is looser. The crotch of the jeans is big so they look weird when you wear them.
2.0,"Although beautifully designed but cheesy, the clasp which clicked shut came off and I barely felt it. If I were in motion I’d be out of a SmartWatch."
2.0,Pleats in the back make it look awful
2.0,"I ordered these for my daughter's birthday back in August. The first pair that came in I ordered my daughters normal shoe size and the shoes came in way too small. Then I ordered 2 sizes up from what I previously had ordered and those ones were huge, almost double the size of the other ones just being 2 sizes larger. The sizing is very off for these shoes"
2.0,"Really cute, but way too small and the material is not stretchy like most bathing suits."
2.0,"This would have been a very pretty necklace had the name been correct.  The error (and the packaging not matching the name) causes me to downgrade my rating.  However, the color is pretty, the edges are smooth, and the presentation card is cute.  But there's little attention paid to what name is placed in each package.  Inspect your item closely when it arrives."
2.0,"Properly constructed product, but it doesn't stay put in the CD player.  Constantly falls out, so it was almost better not to have purchased it at all."
2.0,"This isn't rayon, it's 80% polyester. Not the texture shown in the photo."
2.0,Made me look really Wide and I’m only 125 lbs 5’8”. Gave 2 stars bc was as pictured
2.0,The material use is not as good as expected.
2.0,This item comes up under search two tiered necklace choker.  The problem I have is that the shorter chain is too short to be a choker and too long to fall properly.
2.0,Please earrings are so small they look like they could be on a belong on a large doll.  They are pretty they came in a cheap plastic bag not even a box and I am just too lazy to send them back. I would not spend that kind of money again for these  tiny earrings. They also looked  like after you wore them two or three times did be broken.  But they were pretty if you feel like wasting money
2.0,"Maybe it's just my body type, but this dress felt and looked like a night shirt - not flattering at all."
2.0,Too thin cheaply made
2.0,"The bottoms are very cute and fit well, but the top is much too large. I ordered a small and it was more of a large. Will be returning soon."
2.0,"I have a lot of Sterling silver jewelry so I was anxious to get these cleaning cloths. However, there were no directions included. These cloths are to clean many different surfaces but without directions, how should I clean them?"
2.0,"These earrings are TINY. I ordered them for my mom, who wanted a pair of small black hoops. The other reviews said they were fine for adults, and I realized they were the snug style. However, my mom has very small ears and I cannot imagine her even trying to get the on and off. I think these are best suited for someone who wants to put them on and not take them off for a long period of time because I can't imagine how frustrating it would be to deal with removing these teeny-tiny earrings! I returned them."
2.0,The frames have broken and lenses fall out. I don't even use them daily. They are very lightweight. I re-purchased reading glasses from another vendor and the frames are much more substantial and resistant to breaking.
2.0,"I had previously order the black in the same size and fits fine. However, the red is WAY to small. It does not fit at all"
2.0,Huge!!!!! I wear a 0/2 and was able to pull them right off. I had to give away..
2.0,"They are very attractive looking glasses, but are cheap in quality.  I thought they had spring hinges, but do not.  Also, one of the three pairs had the incorrect magnification.  I had ordered 1.25, but the third pair was 1.50.  I am trying to work with the to exchange for the correct magnification."
2.0,The pendants is good quality but the chain hook is low quality and will loose it’s coloring just after wearing it for one week .
2.0,The basketball etching show is very hard to actually see on the ring. This was why I purchased the ring for my grandson so it’s very disappointing.
2.0,"I love the design of the ring, but the band is way too flimsy to keep the ring stable :("
2.0,Material was awful. Ironing it is a chore. Fits too big. Wanted to use it for work but gave it away. I had ordered 2 of them at the same time but they were packaged separately.
2.0,"Ordered for my daughter’s prom. Pretty dress, but runs small. She typically wears a Medium or a Large, sized up to the large and it would not zip. This is partially due to the poor quality nature of the zipper, which got stuck even if no one was wearing the dress. As her prom is next weekend and there isn’t much store selection due to Covid, we have ordered the next size up and are hopeful it will work. Will update then."
2.0,"This tank top is very awkward. I don’t like tight clothing so I went a size up from my normal size large and got XL. The fit just wasn’t right. I’m 5’7”, 170lbs, with a 38DD chest. The arm holes were massive and the extra material bunched under my arm. The chest was very unflattering, buttoned or unbuttoned. The only reason I give two stars is because the material was nice. Not see through.<br />Not recommended for bustier girls. Ended up returning."
2.0,"Runs small, fit like yoga pants....for men"
2.0,A little disappointed the sweater does not come with the black lace that’s in the picture of the model in every color! Also the sweater is very see through so a tank top will have to be worn underneath it
2.0,Very cute comfortable ☺
2.0,Not long lasting with Wilson Ripspin strings
2.0,"Smaller than regular size. No batteries inside, so you have to buy one"
2.0,This is certainly not kids size . Fits Adult
2.0,They are well made but run quite small. My niece wears size 1. Everything else that size fits except for these boots. It seems you need to buy a size bigger than the child's shoe size
2.0,The gems broke off the piece that attaches into the magnet.
2.0,Not a great fit. Feels tight some places and too loose other places.
2.0,Some of the letters are cut off a little
2.0,"Wouldn't write a negative review if I could return them, but no option to do so.  If you normally wear an XL glove, get one size larger.  Also shows rubber coating all the way up wrist, but delivered product is only rubberized to the base of your hand."
2.0,It looks cheap and it too big to wear.
2.0,"I had hoped, based on the product information, that these insoles might work for me...however, I am NOT interested after 40 years to try retraining/forcing my arch to move upward.<br />These were totally uncomfortable from the get-go, and I wasn't interested to find out how my feet felt after a long day wearing them, much less a week or whatever!<br />I returned them..."
2.0,"There are better values for the same price. On the positive side, the hardware on this bag is sturdier--somewhat bigger and more secure than other comparable bags--but that appears to be the bag's only advantage. Compared to other bags, this one has several disadvantages, including the fact that overall it has less leather trim than other comparable bags. The problems: (1) The bag has fewer interior pockets (e.g., no card holder; no pen holders. (2) Interior pockets are not leather trimmed. (3) No leather band trims the inner circumference of the bag. (4) Shoulder strap is not leather trimmed. (5) The two buckled straps that close the bag are not adjustable. (6) The canvas does not appear as thick as other bags."
2.0,"I bought these for my husband mainly for the blue one. Unfortunately, that is the only one that isn't true to size. It cuts off circulation if he wears it for more than a few minutes. The others fit fine."
2.0,"Theres a ton of these ratchet type belts on the market now, and this is the worst one I've had personal experience with.<br />The belt has a clean and professional appearance, but it can ""let go"" of its setting very easily. I'm not an overweight guy (5'11"", 180 pounds) so its not like I have a belly pushing onto the belt, but it still manages to loose ""clicks"" out of nowhere throughout the day.<br />Also, theres a small pin that holds the mechanism in the buckle together, and it routinely falls out of the belt. I've almost lost it several times. When it falls out, the buckle becomes very lopsided and nearly comes apart.<br />From most companies, these ratchet belts are awesome. Just get a black ratchet belt from another company. This one isn't worth the trouble."
2.0,"Cute shirt, but these are NOT women's sizes. I wear a women's M and a unisex S. I was swimming in a medium and had to return it.  To be safe, I just ordered a different brand in unisex S from a different retailer."
2.0,It’s magnetic.
2.0,Pretty cheap . Came with damage box ... Must be during delivery of this ..
2.0,"The advertisement or add set black silver and gold, I got Rosico not what I wanted"
2.0,I got my pins fast but it’s not what the picture is I thought the middle was going to be the original colors not be gold.....
2.0,"poor quality and way smaller than expected, only order if ur petite"
2.0,I've worn many shirts like this back in the day.  I had high hopes but the shirt runs big and the chest area just doesn't look nice.  It is very see through so you need to wear something under it.  It looks better in a photo than on.
2.0,Turned the inside of my bellybutton green. Didn’t irritate my piercing though so... don’t bother buying.
2.0,Took it on a trip to Europe. Strap is made of cheap material and broke the second day.
2.0,Ordered an extra large and the bra fit like a medium. So was very disappointed I gave them to my teenage daughter and they seem to fit her. :(
2.0,"I ordered two of these in different colors, and they were totally different. The khaki was a very very thin knit and the color was off-putting. I returned it. Then I ordered the blue. It was a much much thicker knit, and would've been much warmer, I'm sure. However, I felt it looked too baggy for my taste and returned it as well."
2.0,Was very excited to get this for my niece. Unfortunately it's not easy to change the pendants around. The clasp broke on the first day. Fortunately we were able to fix it and she just wears all of them at the same time.
2.0,beware they fall apart pretty easy. My daughter hasn't had them very long and they are falling apart. I bought 3 pairs of these boots. Super sad because they are super cute.
2.0,This shirt fit true to size. The style was cute but I couldn't get past the material. It felt like a cross between a leotard and a swimsuit. It just wasn't right for me.
2.0,"The frame around the actual blaze is to big, almost like its gonna pop all the way through"
2.0,I liked the style but the scratchy fabric would be too uncomfortable to wear.
2.0,Straps on bungee don’t stay tight. Sole continues to come out when taking them off.
2.0,Don’t like how it pushes my boobs up<br />Not trying to show them off trying to hold them down so they aren’t bouncing when I’m trying to run
2.0,"I purchased a size S, I am 5’3” and I wear usually a US size 4 pants. These shorts looked so baggy on me! The material is not elastic, only 8% spandex and the rest polyester. Not flattering so I’m returning these."
2.0,"This bracelet is not very substantial and I was disappointed in the fit.  My wrist is fairly skinny so I tried wrapping it three times, but then it wouldn't hook. Just not what I expected."
2.0,"I'm very disappointed, I took the risk with this dress even tho the reviews weren't that good, but unfortunately they're right. The dress fit as a big t shirt, not design, the cloth is ugly :("
2.0,"I liked the dress but it didn't fit me, so I did returned it before the due date but I never received my money back<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Elona"
2.0,"This is my 2nd bag. I had another one where the strap tore off the bag and wrecked the large pocket's zipper. I like the size of the bag and the number of pockets.<br />Therefore, I purchased another. It has lasted so far (a few weeks).<br />The zippers in the bag are cheap and you need to be careful zipping & unzipping.<br />I cannot truthfully recommend this bag for the price charged (even though I did buy it again)."
2.0,im not really happy with this. u can see completely though it and it fits like 2 sizes too big.
2.0,"This is NOT a 3D product with a coffee cup as the picture implies, it's a tiny flat picture of a coffee mug with coffee beans in the background. Kinda hard to tell what's pictured without looking closer. The metal keychain was good enough quality to use so it's not a total waste."
2.0,"The design of the nightgown is very cute but the quality and make is prettty cheap actually, especially considering the price. Mine came with a loose side seam that I had to re-sew, the bow on the front was sewn on completely off-centered (I ended up just removeing it completely), the fabric was nice but besides that, it’s not something I would recommend to anyone, especially at this price point. The only reason I didn’t return it was because it arrived in the nick of time for a “100th Day of School” theme day and I made my kid wear it because we had nothing else to wear."
2.0,"Bought for a trip to Scotland.  The zipper foot broke the second time I zipped it up, rendering the zipper unusable.  Fortunately, the coat has snaps, so I could still use it.<br />Buyer beware - cheap materials - look elsewhere."
2.0,I was surprised when my package arrived that the shirt seemed to be an itchy cheap chiffon polyester blend vs the cotton that other reviewers stated. Also it was incredibly short and boxy. My buttons seemed to veer to the right and didn’t seem like they were at all symmetrical.
2.0,Really really small the largest size fit my daughter in law and she wears a medium
2.0,These were a lot bigger than I wanted. I still wear them but they are big.
2.0,"The colors are similar but not the same, it is very short, and it just does not look like the same sweater. It is ok, just disappointed after having in my cart for months and finally purchased."
2.0,"I felt that the fabric quality, bow size and especially the blouse size were not as advertised or up to expectations. I am awaiting a refund on this item and on another order about to be sent to me.."
2.0,"Color was beautiful and fabric was nice quality, but I didn't like the style at all. Looked like a nightgown on me. I'm 5'3"" so maybe it would work better on a taller person. On me it was a shapeless sack."
2.0,this boot looks more like felt material and not so sure if it is waterproof.  cheap material and the heel hurts my baby
2.0,"It states for large heads not unless your head is a golf ball, very tight."
2.0,This is NOT a sweatshirt! It’s a shiny thin material long sleeve tshirt. Not what I expected but it’s wearable.
2.0,"The factory image makes it look like the skirt is flowing, but the bottom hem was much tighter than expected. It's as if the thread in the hem was pulled, tapering it closer to the body. Overall, it was not flattering at the waist either. If you carry any weight in your midsection, the cute ruffle is hidden."
2.0,ordered large size but received medium. so i had to bless a friend with it. Still hope to get my size someday
2.0,This sweater is very thin and cheaply made. The armholes at the wrists are much bigger than expected.
2.0,"The white isn't flattering. It's very see through, no lining so if you do get the white, have a tube top to wear under it and kind of looks like I'm wearing a plastic bag, it's shiny. The shirt material is stiff and puffy looking. I suggest getting a different color. It's worth the price just white isnt the color for this shirt."
2.0,"Love the top, although I never received a bottom with it..."
2.0,"This did not fit like in the photos at all. It was too wide and too short, not even covering bra. Too bad, I really liked the color, fabric feel, and style."
2.0,Wanted to like this  dress but it looked and felt too cheap for the price- specifically the white buttons.
2.0,"I have a smaller chest, so the top was somewhat large. It also did not cinch in at the waist as much as the picture shows, so it looked frumpy on me. Unfortunately, I will be returning it..."
2.0,"Really nice fabric pattern. To bad the style is the opposite. I returned, because in time the back will wear out more then the front and I might wear it backwards by mistake. That would look awful."
2.0,"I liked the color, but this top is not supportive at all. Would not buy again. I guess if you had smaller breasts, this could work!"
2.0,"Arrived on time, but with blue spots of ink on it. I managed to fade the spots with nail polish remover and a paper towel but they're still visible. Its also much larger than I thought it would be. It's basically 2 wallets in one. The fabric is beginning to tear away from the zipper after only a few days of use. Dont waste your time."
2.0,"After buying these shorts in what was advertised as new condition, they arrived smelling as if they had been used and not washed. In addition to this, the first two inches of velcro was already coming undone from bad stitching.<br /><br />Both discrepancies were fixed by myself. But this is very poor quality control on the seller's part."
2.0,Runs small 🤔
2.0,Shirt is light weight and covered in venelation holes. But definitely not a muscle fit shirt.
2.0,"Pretty suit, but way too large. Sizes not true to description. Sent back. Disappointing."
2.0,Does not follow sizing chart. About 2 sizes too smal
2.0,Two of the 6 pair had defects. Strong chemical odor.  You get what you pay for.
2.0,Very short and see through. I got a medium because that’s what I wear in shirts and it was SHOOOOORT the picture shows it going under the belly button but you can clearly see how high mine was. Definitely size up if you’re larger busted. I’m a 36DD. I should of went with a XL
2.0,"I like that these pajamas are lightweight, however.. after wearing them a few nights, I noticed they had stained my white sheets and I could not get the dye out… I do not recommend unless you have darker colored sheets."
2.0,Image is super blurry.
2.0,These were very nice looking bibs but they are not meant for very cold weather. The website/description does not show the warmth rating like the FXR website does. They also ran small for the size I ordered.
2.0,"This key organizer is more large than it is smart. Realistically, it cannot hold more than five keys without stressing the bolt and stud, which would be very difficult to screw in. The clasp is nice, but it is too small to conveniently latch on and off of another key ring, such as a vehicle fob, compounding this problem is large amount of wasted space below the keys. I was hoping this would help organize my keys so they don't tangle in my pocket, which it does, but at the expense of filling excess room in my pocket. Maybe the key holder would perform better protecting a vehicle key/fob, but in all, it is cumbersome and unwieldy when looking for a specific key. The clasp and its leather connector get in the way when I'm trying to find a key, which seems silly with only five keys, but it still happens. The leather is nice in appearance, but not supple to touch, so the key holder is not quite as luxurious as it looks. The button and the contrast stitching are stylish and unique, but not in an &#34;Etsy&#34; sort of style, more of a machine-stamped & dyed with minimal human interaction-style. The button spins and it does not feel fitted or of significant quality.<br /><br />A significant flaw in the design is the stud. It has no notches or grip to be tightened into the bar, so unless I use some cushioned pliers (to avoid scratching the stud), preventing the stud from automatically loosening is all but impossible. Other reviewers have commented on this problem, which can result in the holder spilling keys.<br /><br />One nice function, given the bar and stud design, is the holder affords leverage with locks, but that is only after I spend time searching for the correct key and it's not like this feature is exclusive to this key holder."
2.0,"This is bigger than I thought, which was a pleasant surprise. It's very cute! However, the quality is horrid. My daughter broke it within a few days of receiving it. The metal bent and the whole thing snapped in half. Also, the chain is low quality, too. The clasp on it broke quickly also. I'm sad because it was such a cheap buy. But you do get what you pay for."
2.0,I purchased this product as a gift because it was the only sleeve I saw that had a complete aquaman. Once I received it it was a total bust because I got the flash as a main character.  Aquaman face was completely cut off. And so was wonder women. Waste of of a purchase.
2.0,I was not able to text with these gloves. Other than that i guess they are ok. To advertise these as gloves to text with is not accurate
2.0,"I would have given these pants 5 stars, however after ONE time wearing them, I put them on today and there was a hole in the crotch! It was not there the first time worn, and I wash all my active wear on delicate and without fabric softener. I'm not sure if I can return them after washing and wearing, but I would not buy this product again. Which in unfortunate since I love how they fit."
2.0,Usually it’s the opposite. It looked small but it’s too large.
2.0,"I need size smaller but they don't make but one size ,and with shipping cost not worth sending back"
2.0,This was not well made. The first time my daughter wore it the skirt started coming apart. Not good not worth the money.
2.0,"Never had a nightgown that fit everywhere but at the armpit, but this one is it. Not good."
2.0,"Cheap material, but you need to but size larger."
2.0,It's see through and doesn't fit the right way it's cheap and made poorly
2.0,"Cheap material, poorly made, way over priced. Not happy."
2.0,Mine broke within 5 mins of me putting it on haha! The one I gave to my mom is holding on though lol
2.0,Both pieces fell apart and pieces were lost.
2.0,"Tried them on and immediately hated them. the fabric feels so cheap and there is little to no mobility. i am 5,4 with short legs and they came barley below mid calf. overall just not a great buy."
2.0,It will not keep any one warm
2.0,Has some scrawling or stuff on the side of the arms that I didn't see in the pictures--unfortunately not the gf's style so she will not wear
2.0,Kinda of cheaply made and nearly impossible to keep the colors from running even when washing in cold water....Look elsewhere
2.0,Very cute dress but sizing was way off
2.0,"This watch quickly became one of my favorites and at an incredible price. However, I noticed from one time getting caught in the rain, that the metal pieces on the strap quickly became tarnished. I never submerged the watch, but I would of hoped it was at least somewhat water resistant. I would recommend this watch only if you never plan on it getting wet. If this company can at least replace the metal strap pieces that can easily be removed, I will adjust my review, but as of now it is unwearable with the ugly tarnished marks."
2.0,"I loved this face mask, and I was ready to buy more, but the first time I washed it the fabric came off the stitches on the edge. Great fit, lovely designs, very comfortable, but not good quality."
2.0,Fringe falls out everywhere I go
2.0,"The pants was to small gave to my daughter who is 2 size smaller than me, if order, order up at last 1 to 2 sizes to fit"
2.0,"The socks are thin, itchy, uncomfortable, and it's difficult to read the writing. The image and words are blurry and smudged. There is a thick, visible, awkward, vertical seam running up the middle of the sock. They are unattractive and of poor, itchy quality. What a bummer!"
2.0,Very very thin and cheap material. Overpriced
2.0,"Ordered XXLG  fits like a medium. Papery thin, poorly sewed together, numerous exposed threads. It is soft so that's a plus."
2.0,"I got myself sized at a jeweler first, and was sized at 14. The ring I got, supposedly a size 14, is considerably bigger than what I was sized for. Also, not high quality alloy and the plastic jewel isn't even centered. Ok piece for cosplay I guess..."
2.0,Disappointed to say the least  looks like wish crap.<br />I ordered a 2xl  it's like a kids 2xl<br />I can barely get it on and no way it will zip<br />It does heat up ok
2.0,I was hesitant to purchase with conflicting reviews. I did receive all the parts but it is too small. The seller left several comments on reviews saying it is true to size. Ut is not. Ladies order a cup size bigger.
2.0,It came pretty fast....the horn is very small...it looks like im wearing a hot pepper around my neck....not happy
2.0,"Cute, but broke same day."
2.0,Footbed too small
2.0,"lasted about a month and half before it ripped two holes. i use it for gym, and nothing else."
2.0,"The straps dig in on the sides, which is something I can't tolerate. Donated it."
2.0,"The cap always slip off, and the goggles was broken after the second time of usage"
2.0,Really cute romper but waaaay too tiny for a medium. Ended up giving it away :(
2.0,El segundero no vino en su posicion lo que hace malo el funcionamiento del mismo
2.0,The color I ordered wasn’t even close to what was pictured.
2.0,this just fits a 4.5 year old child not the 10 to 11 that it says.
2.0,"The sweater vest was just a bunch of pieces sewn together.  The material is soft, and it fits okay, but it has too many seams. Returning for better quality."
2.0,"Soft and hid alot but way too deep of a v neck, not able to wear a bra."
2.0,"It is too expensive for the quality of product. I have brought from biba before and never once got a low quality product. This one was another case , the slip underneath was shear and top Kurti was very tight. Overall a weird fit."
2.0,Ok guys i order these shorts i would've took pictures but there way to small i ordered the XXL. And trust me when i say its more like a LG they run extra small but the shorts are very nice i love them wish i could get them past my ankels so i will be passing them on to my daughter as a gift
2.0,Don’t get me wrong. Purse is nice and decent but material wise I truly would not have paid this much for it if I would have see it in the store.<br />Pockets are nice. Size is nice. Just the material I’m displeased with.
2.0,Only lasted 6 weeks until clip broke
2.0,Was way too big for small and was shiny and not my preffered materiel which made it look inexpensive
2.0,"I sized up two sizes after reading the reviews and it is still tight. The sleeves are a decent quality knit, but the body of the cardigan is a very thin jersey type material that is see through and very low quality. I was so excited to get this sweater and was horribly disappointed when I received it. It will be returned"
2.0,Was giving for Christmas present judge the size wrong
2.0,"The UV protection Mask was not strong enough to stay up as others I have used do, instead it bunched up and was very uncomfortable."
2.0,"Too small, even after using the size guide. The dark slip part was way too short to cover anything. You can see everything.<br />Also, the description says the dress is cotton and spandex, but the tag says cotton and polyester"
2.0,"Did not like the fit on this suit.  Was too large and proportions were off.  Butt baggy, waist good, bust too small. Ended up returning."
2.0,I got it without the closure hook
2.0,price looked good but it did not match up to the sizing chart
2.0,"It was so cute, and perfect for our family photo. But one of the buttons was tighter fitting than the rest on the front and the shirt was a little too big. The sizing was way off. A baggy shirt and a too tight skirt. I made the mistake of not buttoning it up when it arrived and I tried it on her. It looked like it would be good and I was just going to use a white onesie to replace the big shirt. Sending it back. Our coordinated family photo outfits, ended up uncoordinated... bummer"
2.0,All the reviews I read stated this item ran small. i am large in the chest area so I ordered a 3x. It was huge!!! and the label stated X-Large???  I gave it away. I would have loved it if it had been the correct size. Very nice item.
2.0,"The shirt fits really well but is complete opposite of what you see the model wearing.  The picture advertised shows a textured shirt with bright vibrant tie dye. What I received is some of of nylon like material with this weird tie dye job. It’s like they didn’t even try to make it look good. I’m debating on returning it because although it fits nice, it looks cheap due to the material used instead of what was advertised. I don’t know why some brands have to be so misleading. If you’re selling some sort of cheap knock off then be transparent about that and let the buyer decide if they’d like to actually buy your garbage instead of duping  them into doing so."
2.0,"See that button?  It sits on top of a pleat. So if you have large boobs (which I do) then it messes with that pleat and it doesn’t lie flat so the whole thing looks weird. Also, the picture made it look like there was a little more tailoring to the top, but it really did just look like a potato sack on me. The fabric was soft though. Will be returning."
2.0,Not made for young girls!  Heavy!
2.0,The material is very soft and stetchy. Unfortuantely the cup was too small for me. The bust fit great though. I'm a 38D and ordered and XL so it should have fit. Also the clasp on one of the bras was broken on arrival. I'm disappointed this didn't fit right because it was very soft and supportive.
2.0,"I bought and returned this dress, just was not for me. The armholes were gaping, and the lining is a satin-poly that is not breathable, and would stick to you if you are wearing it on a hot summer day. If it were single layer, and a nicer quality fabric, I would have absolutely kept it. With that said, there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the dress, just longer than i had hoped and poor armholes."
2.0,not made for someone who is top heavy. the v neck portion is open and just kind of has to sit on your chest to stay closed. one wrong move then you are exposed.
2.0,"I only bought this top because it was on sale for $6 and was amazon prime. I bought an XL due to I thought this was in Asian sizes. Looks nothing like the picture and is super short but wide on me. I don’t even want to know how short it would be had I bought a smaller size. Save your money and don’t buy. I’m 5’4, 155lbs, 32DDD and I have a short torso. My belly button is where my finger is on my stomach. I hope I can return this crap."
2.0,"LOVE the colors, but runs small. Since it was velvet, I thought it would feel softer."
2.0,It’s cute but about 4 sizes too small. Also the fabric is very rough so we won’t be exchanging for a larger size.
2.0,I normally don't post reviews. These slippers hurt. Period.
2.0,"Stiff, don’t feel good on your feet. Very disappointing. No cushioning. Also seem to run a little on the short side."
2.0,They fit like girl panties
2.0,"While I liked the stretchy-ness of the fabric, it was too bulky to lie flat and seemed boxy. It was too short to be a dress, but too long for a tunic. Returning it was too expensive, so I was offered a 25% refund."
2.0,"The print is really cute, but the fabric is very poor quality and super cheap. The buttons do not line up with the holes, and there is no fabric overlap behind where they eyelet buttons are, so you can see your boobs straight through the dress. Wanted to send it back, but the shipping took so long that I received it outside of the return window."
2.0,Runs small. Thin and see through
2.0,"Great design and beautiful, but the design in the pendant was not a tree. The design was of the galaxy in pink and blue. Also, the circular pendant was bigger than shown and overlaps the moon."
2.0,"My biggest problem is my mistake, in that I didn't notice there was not a place to select a size. I have small hands, and this ring doesn't even remotely fit. I agree with others that the item doesn't match the photo, but the description does list stainless steel as the material. As long as you do your homework and don't buy based off the photo like I did it's an okay ring for the price. Just wish it fit and I could actually wear it."
2.0,"was to small for a woman. should be fine for a child, but I ordered this one for me."
2.0,Only 2 were vented and had terry cloth head band. 1 had very thin material no headband or vent holes. 1 the material was good but no headband or vent holes. Very disappointed. Would not buy again
2.0,"Looks great but the reflective coating rubbed off in a spot. It's not scratched, just dull in a spot."
2.0,"Even came with a soft case. Breaks easily though. Didn't last more than 2 months.<br />My son's Babiator, on the other hand, still works fine after 5 years."
2.0,Way too small & not stretchy at all.
2.0,"I like this dress, but somewhat left disappointed when I received it. Firstly I ordered  one size, I got 2xxl. Secondly, I ordered this pretty green that you're viewing.  However I received  a very dull color. I reached  out to the seller where I took 2 photos and send. The first  photo I took without the flash on the dress is  gray looking. The next one I took with the flash on the dress appeared to be bright green. I don't  understand. 🤔 But I'll post pictures.  The seller is yet to get back to me. To the naked eye the dress is not green.  Nevertheless  beautiful dress"
2.0,I wear a 12 and the XL barely fit.  Certainly not comfortable for lounging. I returned as the material was cheap and not soft.
2.0,Didn’t fit and totally uncomfortable
2.0,"This scarf is more like a handkerchief. The material is rough and its to short to wear as an actual scarf, unless you just lay it across your shoulders without wrapping it. I'm really disappointed and I wouldn't recommend this scarf to anybody."
2.0,"This pendant is GIGANTIC, it's way too big. I have no idea how you would wear this."
2.0,Like it but not enough room if your a male.
2.0,"Not a heavy hoodie, very lightweight. Threads came out of front pocket in the first week of wearing it. Contacted seller, never got a response."
2.0,The size was totally off and we ordered two so we were 2x disappointed. It was too small for the recommendations of the  size chart
2.0,Like the style but they slide right down my nose.  To light weight & too big for my face  I don't wear them & unfortunately didn't get to return them in time
2.0,"Mostly cosmetic effect.  Very flimsy brittle material.  It's not a question of IF they will break, just WHEN.  Kept them in a hard case.  Wore them only occasionally.  They're cheap for a reason.  They'll outlast the warranty period, then one day they'll crack when you open them or put them on.  Or you put them in a shirt pocket for a while... no rough housing, just walking or sitting around.  Pull them out of your pocket and they're in pieces."
2.0,Well made but size was not true to sizing chart.
2.0,"Because the mirrors are so small, each eye can only see half of one page. The design should really be a mirrored visor."
2.0,"Was too thin, and made very cheap material."
2.0,"Sorry these do not fit right unless you have long ,fat feet and skinny ankles. To bad because they look great on the models feet. Gosh i hate giving bad reviews."
2.0,"Love the dress, but it came without the sash! The empty belt loops look quite awkward."
2.0,It runs small. It is not true to size. I sent it back with the other dress that I ordered from Faintest in the same box with both return labels but was only credited for 1 dress. Please send me my refund.
2.0,I had ordered the option with the orange lenses but received the all black lenses. While they’re still very nice sunglasses overall. I was excited to try a new color lenses.
2.0,Ordered two sizes up and it was still too small.
2.0,Its really cheaply made but I mean you get what you paid for ig 🤷‍♀️
2.0,Beautful wstch but the watch is not working
2.0,The products stitching is not good. Pants fall down a little at waist but too tight on legs. Also when putting a belt in the loop snapped and I wasn’t even pulling yet. Don’t love the quality and bought two and both did that. Also the button is loose not worth the price.
2.0,"Cute bra, but offers little support"
2.0,Way too small!  Had to give away!!!
2.0,"It's not as long as it shows on the picture, and the shoulder part slips down constantly. But it does fit.."
2.0,"Read size chart carefully, I got a large and it fits my kid. My kid loves the shirt but husband is bummed."
2.0,"Really cute hat. First one cams damaged. Ordered a replacement same problem. If it wasn’t squished I would of loved it.  Customer service sent the replacement no problem, I unfortunately had too much going on and didn’t have a chance to return them by the deadline. My fault."
2.0,I allways buy M in all of dresses but in this model i am L. Very very tight
2.0,I have a number of patterned Zattcas maxi dresses and love them.  I was so excited to see the solid black and solid navy.  I bought them assuming the fabric would be the same as the others of this style because they lay beautifully and don't show lumps and bumps.  So disappointed to find that the solid ones appear to be a rayon material and don't lay the same way. They lay similarly to thin cotton.  Buyer beware.
2.0,The cuffs of the sleeves are huge and dont fit the wrist at all. Makes it look like a homeless man hoodie before I even washed it. Arrived on time and in great condition but what the hell emerica? wack style on a cheap cotton hoodie youre hawkin for $60.
2.0,These are listed with the delicate dragon fly earrings so I thought they would be equally light. They are huge and about  15 ounces.  They would rip my ear lobe if I wore them.  My mother accidentally bought 3 sets so I divided them up ( had 5 since 1 arrived broken) and gave them to my radiology co-workers as rear view mirror hangers.  About all they are good for unless you do a lot of Halloween decorating and can figure a use for them
2.0,"Not the same sizes as ""normal"" USA clothing."
2.0,Chain broke my neck out the stone wasn't too heavy but I honestly can't tell if it's real or not
2.0,"The underwire stuck out in the front bad, material is too thin. Felt It would RIP from weight of my boobs"
2.0,Sizing is way off too small.  Fabric nice
2.0,"This just didn’t work for me. I have no complaints about the color, quality."
2.0,"The shirt is tight fitting, so size up 2 sizes"
2.0,"I bought these based on the product pics. The ones in the pictures are the Active USA brand. What I recieved was ""American City Wear"". They are nowhere near the same quality as Active USA. I will return these."
2.0,The dress looks different than the picture ..has a ruffle around the bottom. Front is cut down very low. Back has extra fabric.  I am returning it
2.0,Pretty but too big for my ears
2.0,Unfortunately these aren't the greatest quality. I bought two (one for either side of my engagement ring) and one was broken upon arrival - missing a stone and the band had a crack in it and the other is crooked. I'll be returning them asap.
2.0,This scarf is made of a nice fabric and has a cute design but was much smaller than I thought it would be.
2.0,These gloves were way too small!
2.0,"I ordered a XXL.  That means someone who isn't skinny.  It was a little snug thru the shoulders, and way, way too small in the arms.  My average-size teenage niece didn't like the arms either (restrictive), and the rest of the shirt swallowed her."
2.0,This top runs very small.  I ordered one size up from my normal size.  My normal size would have never fit me.  It's  even hard to get on since it has no stretch in it.  I should have gone up two sizes.  It isn't very attractive either.<br />Not a good buy.
2.0,Bought for daughter. Didn't look good in her nose. Flower was way too big.
2.0,Should specify that the rhinestones are printed
2.0,shrunk after all delicate precautions
2.0,"The only thing I don't like about the shirt is that it's purple lettering instead of pink. I ordered both shirts, 1 for myself & the other for my fiance because our 5 yr old daughter has cancer. The shirt fits as expected & feels nice but we'll probably workout in it because the color isn't pink."
2.0,"The price should have told me the story.  Thin material, not as neat as the picture."
2.0,Order this coat size XX I  wear size XL and it was just too small my daughter size 8 wears it good.<br />Not happy with the material very cheap looking... do not recommend it... :(
2.0,"The bracelet does not stay linked, My husband had to keep hooking it back together and now he does not even wear it."
2.0,It was just to plain. I love the bag.
2.0,Runs a little small for me. Coloring becomes faded out. Material is thinner than I like.
2.0,Fit too small. Order size up
2.0,"Said it's ""conveniently for night driving""...absolutely false."
2.0,These were purchased to wear when getting my hair done only. You have to leave the paper backing on the mask to use it correctly.  and that creates a need to have  some type of airflow to breathe.
2.0,"Cheap, the diamond fell off , and the thingy lol."
2.0,The size was much bigger than expected. Wanted it to be smaller.
2.0,"Cute, but it broke right away."
2.0,Cute top but it was a little to tight on my arms
2.0,Get a bigger size
2.0,Runs incredibly small
2.0,"The style and price are unbeatable. However, I've bought three of these shirts. The second shirt a button came off on first wear and the third shirt the entire pocket came off after the first wash."
2.0,"They are not what I expected maybe if I would have ordered an extra large they would have fit better. I'm only giving it at 2 because the appearance of the material on the picture is far different from what I actually received the pockets are not large like the photo and the drawstring it's not really a drawstring. The length of the pants are not long but that may also have to do with me ordering a large rather than a extra large however, they do stretch so I can fit them just not as I would like to.  If it was not a hassle I would return them but I won't be wearing them out as I planned."
2.0,they were cheap and looked the part...we did not use them...threw them in the trash
2.0,"It's not what u see, not that elegant, not glittering.a cut and paste material,as embroidery,"
2.0,"Bracelets came quickly but did not recieve ANY of the colors i emailed and requested,  2 of them were oddly smaller then the others as well."
2.0,"The swimsuit looked cute in person; however, it fit bigger than expected and there was absolutely no support in the bust. It is also extremely low cut which doesn't help. It would have been better if the straps were adjustable. I had to return it. The return process was super easy and free."
2.0,Product not an accurate color as pictured. And runs MUCH smaller
2.0,"To short. Loved the color, compression was good."
2.0,I've washed it and it still smells so bad. Never came across this type of thing with a new shirt. It's not new shirt smell...its tobacco.  Any chance you will respond to this review. What can I wash it with to remove the smell and why is there such an awful smell on this shirt?
2.0,NO SAME COLOR AS THE PICTURE
2.0,It was ok. It wasn’t very soft and was quite thin. ☹️
2.0,"This scarf is the size of a throw blanket on the couch. HUGE. It would be awkward to wear all day as it is very bulky. It almost feels like a neck brace. Also, the little threads kept aiming off and bothering my eyes. It does look exactly like the picture, just not at all comfortable."
2.0,Like the purse but zipper broke after a couple of weeks
2.0,"Cheap. Some of them didn't even fit me and I am sure that they will break after wearing them 2-3 times. The chain that goes across the hair and the one that goes around your ear is fine, but the rest are already falling apart. I love the idea/style though...it was just not worth the money."
2.0,Way to tight! Super soft fabric tho!!!
2.0,this was the first day i’ve worn it and it already ripped at the seam on the sleeve. loose thread was everywhere on the inside as well.
2.0,I wear a size 9 and they were too large for my feet.  I felt like I was going to trip on them.  Nice quality but returned them.
2.0,Doesn’t hold up great
2.0,Not true to size to small
2.0,It wasn't the quality that was good but the photo showed the split to the side but it came split up the middle?? But for me it was too large in the chest also.
2.0,"unfortunately the dress had a hole in the chest part will be returning, hopefully I can re order and get one with out a hole. Dress fit well and nice material"
2.0,Only wore them once. The fell off from the weight of the earring and I lost them. I wish they weren't heavy id have loved them
2.0,"Cups look cool, feels OK. Problem is I was hoping the &#34;natural&#34; description was accurate. Not so much. Strong chemical smell and taste when I drank my coffee from them. Yes, I washed them first, quite well. After several washes & uses, the smell & after taste remain, like lacquer or some wood stain. Not so &#34;Natural&#34;..."
2.0,Hair bow is way too small
2.0,Outfit runs somewhat small but it is cute. It's hard to have to keep returning things.
2.0,"I love the warmth of the sweat shirt it is very very warm. Unfortunately, the stitching is coming apart not just few stragglers there and there but on both of the ones i bought. I am returning and looking elsewhere. and for $25 a pop i'm sorry but the hanes ones are much better quality compared to this"
2.0,The light in this watch is a joke. When you press the button you see a pinpoint of green light. It does not reach the actual time so it is worthless. The band on the watch is very stiff. About the only thing I liked was the color. Will be trying another brand.
2.0,This was a “meh” dress the color was bright lemon yellow and the material was weird polyester didn’t fit right
2.0,It feels huge.
2.0,I put one in my Croc and it broke within a week.
2.0,Massively huge!  Uncomfortable huge.
2.0,"Beautiful earrings but the latch is flimsy.  It is difficult to get it right into the slot, and even then, it slips back off easily."
2.0,This could have been a really cute shirt but is runs so small.  I usually wear a small but this would have been more like an xxsmall.
2.0,They are too narrow.
2.0,"The disk is too thick to allow the pendants I bought them for, to close."
2.0,Seam ripped within two weeks of purchase.  I sewed it once and it tore again. Bright colors.  My son loved it while it stayed together.
2.0,It took so long to get here that it is not time for winter clothes. Also it does not look like it does in the pic. I got a different shirt. This girl must be wearing a large or extra large because I normally wear a small or extra small and I ordered a medium because I wanted it to be larger and it is snug.
2.0,I wear a 32 DD and ordered a D but it was WAY too big. I think I'd try a B next time... better too small than too large I'd imagine.
2.0,"It fits like a dream, looks gorgeous and feels amazing -- but the negative reviews are right -- it rides up with every single step. Walk 50 feet and you're stuck with a belt beneath your skirt. If you're standing motionless in a receiving line, this is for you. Otherwise look into other options. I opted for tights and/or a half slip -- less control but more comfort and mobility. I still wear it -- but only to places where I can discreetly pull it down -- a lot. Make a breathtaking entrance and then duck behind the ferns to adjust :)"
2.0,The necklace is pretty but I am going to have to cut the chain because the necklace would hang to my midriff if I put it on the last ring and I really wanted this to be more around my neck.
2.0,Looked cheaper in person than in the photo
2.0,"First off, truly, it needs a size comparison. Mine was not 16.5''! Mine measured in at 9.7''! And,not in accordance with the picture, it's so frail I'm positive a stiff breeze will destroy it...<br />Still, it is pretty, and it only cost $70.00, so I cannot complain too loudly!"
2.0,I bought a L blouse because in the reviews said that runs somewhat small (I am S-M)  and it was somewhat small again.
2.0,Not what is pictured. In the product I got the neckline is well above cleavage  (i am C-cup) unlike pictured. The start of the hem on the bottom of the dress was at my knees (5'7&#34;) which made the fit of the dress strange.<br />The only reason I gave two stars instead of one is that I can make some alterations myself.
2.0,"They came bent, so I straightened them out. They are very cheap but then again so was the price so I won't complain too much. Just didn't like the came bent."
2.0,It shrank and became too small. I like the thin light fabric and the fun color. But way too small now. Bought a size 4 for my 3 yr old son.  Cannot return unless new condition. So please buy size up!  I like the fabric a lot; I am buying another pair.
2.0,To thin and to small. Have to wear a tank top under it. I like cleavage and lightweight shirt for summer but material is cheap and see through. I ordered a size up. And also have DDs it squishes my boobs in an unflattering way.
2.0,Very poor construction.  The sewing seam of the hat to the brim is visible when wearing the product.  I have a relative who has an Aussie Chiller hat and it is not constructed like this hat.
2.0,I comes off quick. Baby size was correct but it comes off so easily
2.0,"When I got these I loved the quality and I put on a pair And the fit was perfect...I immediately got back on amazon and ordered another 8 pairs.  As I went through the other seven pair this morning I noticed that a few of them had the rubber for the heal on the wrong side, making me wear that sock inside out in order for the sock to stay on...how does that get passed their quality assurance process??? Regretting ordering a second set.  It may be returned upon arrival. Sad because the pair I am wearing are awesome."
2.0,"Very cheap material and not nearly as big as I thought. Description says 'diaper bag'.....would be a SMALL diaper bag! Price was cheap, but I didn't think it was worth it, so sent it back."
2.0,The band is too big for my wrist. I love the look.
2.0,Fit weird. The reviews said it was oversized but mine is too small? There is a ridge of fur between the ears that stays sticking up so looks weird too. Sad because it is really soft.
2.0,Faded before I even got to wear them
2.0,Charm broke off after a week
2.0,First and foremost the product images the seller is using are not the product being sold. Those pictures were pulled from another site! These turn shoes are extremely narrow and long. The vinyl material used is 1/16 thick. If you have a medium to wide foot these will be very uncomfortable. I don't believe they're the proper width for a man's foot. With this vinyl material being so thin I don't believe they'll stand up to hard use at all. If you work renaissance festivals or plan on using these while camping or hiking you might want to pursue another option. They do however have a hard rubber sole so you don't have to worry about them getting shredded on concrete or gravel. They also have an insole. The pattern isn't really based on the Oseberg ankle boots either. The manufacturer made them incorrectly trying to skimp on material. The original Oseberg boot has no seam up the back and wraps around the calf and heel of the foot to prevent blisters. This boot however has a stitch straight up the back that will surely cause blisters. It also causes the heel of the boot to bunch up at the bottom between the heel of your foot and the sole of the boot.
2.0,"My son loved this watch that he got for his birthday. Because he’s an 8 year old and excited about his new watch, he checked the time frequently throughout the day and compared it with my watch. After a few hours it was already running slow. We reset it every few days and it consistently fell short.<br />After 5 weeks, the pin in the band broke. Obviously we can buy a replacement part but it just seems like this watch should hold up a little better than it did. I would probably just go with a different watch if I had to do it over again."
2.0,"Cheap fabric, started falling apart almost immediately after one wear."
2.0,To right around the mid area and very very lightweight.
2.0,"Hardly even fits my husbands head, it’s so big even when adjust the straps in back"
2.0,Very pretty but very itchy around my wrist
2.0,"'Wish I'd returned it.  I bought it because I favor shoulder bags.  I did not like the short carrying straps as they got in the way.  When I tried to get the hand-carrying straps out of sight, the bag just gaped wide and looked ridiculous.  Poor engineering of an otherwise attractive purse."
2.0,"ruined very quickly, leather pulled from shoe and started to fall apart."
2.0,"Very lightweight sunglasses, the lenses feel/look like tint film was cut and adhered onto the plastic. Good for sunglasses I don't mind throwing around and getting banged up, but wont purchase again."
2.0,"Although this is a beautiful top, I ordered a XXL thinking it would be baggy on me (I usually wear a size 12) and it fit like a large so I can't wear it. A waste of money."
2.0,It was too big for my son & it looses shape & appears dingy after washing even with non Chlorine bleach. It is thicker than expected though.
2.0,Nice looking shorts only problem is that the logos fade away after a few washes and the adidas logo fell apart!!!!
2.0,They are extremely hard to open and put on your head and my child cried saying they hurt his head. Unfortunately these could use some improvements.
2.0,Poor material.  The dres is beautiful but not too pleased with the material.  Is deceiving with the picture on the website.
2.0,"Wanted to like this so bad, but it's pretty weird fit.  Bottoms were itty bitty.  The top was the right size I think, but it does not lay the way shown in the picture.  Sent it back."
2.0,"The color is great and the fit is ok, but the material is cheap. Literally, just a costume. the skirt seams were literally just cut by a scissor. For $ 24 bucks, I would not buy it.  It's not meant to be worn every day, it's more of a, lets take a picture and take it off after type of garment."
2.0,ordered a medium size & it was too small.the fabric was very thin.the price was 28.something.i  have many comparable shirts that are of better quality &  were much cheaper.don't waste your cash.
2.0,"Was very displeased that although I am a C, this bra gave me the 4 boob look... not flattering in the least, it actually pulled my breasts down instead of up... ( I am in my 20's no children) so there's no reason why this shouldn't have worked for me. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of zero is the adhesive is fairly good, I threw it out after one use so I am unsure about how it fairs after the first time. I would recommend ordering up a cup size. I also followed the directions exactly as included. I used this at a wedding as a bridesmaid so I had no choice but to use it."
2.0,I don’t care for them they are too tight on my thighs
2.0,Returning this one!!!!  Horrible dress!  The material is rough!  Nothing I like about this even though it fit!
2.0,I ordered black. The style is nice but after the 1st wash it looked warn. It picks up lint like crazy and has to be delinted everytime it's laundered and I do wash it with like permant press colors and use a dryer sheet on low in the dryer. It still never comes out looking nice so I only wear it around the house. Poor quality material!
2.0,I returned this as it didn't fit like the photo showed.  not flattering.
2.0,Bottom pic is correct pin
2.0,Totally not what i expected too long and not form fitting at all.
2.0,misguided on size by the reviews
2.0,It wasn't what I expected. The sleeves are quite short and it runs small.
2.0,They were thinner and smaller then what I expected. One was also slightly bent so I had to try to reshape it to match the other. Was afraid to because they are really very flimsy. Would not purchase again.
2.0,"I returned it because it arrived too late and i didn't need it anymore. It's nice but also really thin and fragile, I don't keep it because the necklace won't last."
2.0,"I purchased these after seeing a review on them from an influencer on Instagram. The first day I wore them I loved them. Second day I realized that they are 100% not workout material unless you wear a shirt to cover your bum. They are for sure see thru. And then last I noticed that the side see thru panels rip very easy. So overall the fit is tts, the length is great but the quality is not."
2.0,"Material is too cheap, definitely not for me,different from the picture"
2.0,The arms are at least 6 inches too short. This is not a 'free size' it's more like an  XS. Super soft though.
2.0,"I love the style but these run small. I could use the next size up but they don’t have anything larger. I think they only have a single panel of fabric in front. That will be cooler but less absorbent.<br />Update: after wearing these A number of times, I find there is not enough elasticity left in the leg and crotch, and they end up pulling to one side and leaving my junk hanging out. I threw them out."
2.0,"nice looking product and box, didn't receive it"
2.0,I wear an xl and bought a 2xl and it was really tight. Will be returning.
2.0,Not even really cute in my opinion
2.0,"This product came in a different color than ordered. Though a large, it fit snugger than the same large ordered separately. If you are looking for ""compression"" of significant amount, order a size smaller. Ankles are loose. Compression is mild at best. I ordered a Large for 5'9, 180, 34 inch waist."
2.0,Very disappointed in this hoodie. The quality is not what I expected. The sleeve is sewn incorrectly and twists around your arm.
2.0,"I’m not sure why but this sweater fit was very odd to me.  It was really short, which I hate.  It barely covered my belly button.  The chest area was very baggy, which is rare for me and my girls.  But it was so baggy that it gaped so I would definitely have to wear a tank under it or I’d be arrested for indecent exposure.<br /><br />Sleeve length was great.  Material felt nice.  I just did not care for the fit at all."
2.0,The colors were different than what I thought they would be.  The length was shorter than I liked too.  I returned these.
2.0,Unfortunately the seams came apart after one wear smh
2.0,These gloves run small but next size up
2.0,Very beautiful but the cheap pin on the back broke the instant I tried to pin it on and there was simple material for it to go through nothing hard. I'm going to try to fix it myself as I'm afraid if I got another it would do the same. Such a shame.
2.0,"The material is soft but more of a spandex feel to it. The length is of the shirt is actually short, not the long and flowy look like what it is on the model. The only reason I purchased is because of the length shown - it is so hard to find something that is not like a crop top or square shaped.  Very disappointed with the fit."
2.0,"Thicker than expected. The fabric sucks to your face when you inhale. Not nearly as colorful as pictured, only a few bright colored sequins. The seam runs right down the middle so it is pointy & boxy looking."
2.0,"I purchased this bag at the end of March and after only a few months all the interior pocket seams have come apart and torn. I'm losing items in the lining of the bag through the holes in the pockets which is infuriating when I'm trying to find something. The interior pocket has no structure so it's useless, contents just fill the other part of the bag. One of the exterior seams is coming undone on the outside and has a big hole now. Terrible quality and construction. Too bad, I really liked the look of the bag and it felt right when carrying around which is why I'm giving it a 2 and not a zero."
2.0,"fit tight ,expected larger"
2.0,The idea is good... the outcome is horrible...<br />The flowers design is just horrible looks like my 4 yo cut it her self...<br />And it is not patch up all the way... the material looks and feels very cheap... I know I didn't bought it from a designer store but I know they could have done better than that... and if I give a 2 star is because it came on time and because the size is very acceptable.
2.0,I received two different tints on the lens I received.  One was brown tinted and the other is standard grey shade.
2.0,"I loved almost everything about this dress, except the cut/fit at the chest and armpits was very off."
2.0,"Cute, comfortable ... and turned my white shirt purple!  I haven’t had clothing bleed color this bad since a teal rayon shirt in the late 80s. Very disappointing."
2.0,too much gather at waistline elastic
2.0,Missing one item i just notice when i just needed it!
2.0,I have 36D breasts and this dress did not even remotely cover/wrap around my chest.  Seemed to fit everywhere else but was so tiny on top I really thought it may have been a manufacturing error.  It’s a pretty dress but seems to run very small in the chest. Too bad. :-(
2.0,These are so thin that they tear easily.
2.0,Looks nothing like saiki k glasses
2.0,I love the jacket but it is made  extra small. LLove the style and color. If my pregnant daughter can't wear it I'll be returning it.
2.0,The clasp on the chain broke the first time I used it. I purchased a new clasp at a hobby store repaired it on my own. The chain itself is pretty
2.0,"Necklace is not very well made, ie the string that ties the beads.  If you just plan to wear casually it works, but no extracurricular activities as the string is very flimsy."
2.0,"TOO TIGHT FOR COMFORT!!!<br /><br />First and formost, I LOVE the design and style of these panties!  I believe the company should change the &#34;one size fits all&#34; and make it to where you can order it in your own size.  I'm actually small, I'm 5'4&#34; and weigh 120lbs, the panties are too tight for comfort!!!!  I will NOT be returning them, but will NOT buy anymore unless the company changes it to where you can choose the size you want!<br /><br />To the company,<br /><br />If you do change it to where women can choose their own size (because women are NOT one size fits all!) I would be glad to order more of your products!!!<br /><br />2 ⭐️for size because women want panties that fit and<br />  that looks good on them when wearing them...<br />5 ⭐️ for design....<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Melanie Fitz"
2.0,I sleep a lot during the day so I'm always looking for something to block out the light. My last pair wore out so I gave these a try. They have a thick flap of material that goes under your nose. When you do this it does block out all light but it also blocks you from breathing through your nose. I've found that this mask constantly keeps waking me up either from trying to breath through my nose or just the size of this thing. This is a very bulky mask and isn't very comfortable. I'm not happy with this mask at all.
2.0,purchased a large but the arms were very tight.<br />the chest was fine.
2.0,"I absolutely love this brand, hands down my favorite and only jeans, capris and shorts I wear! These threw me WAY off tho. I ordered both blue and orange, and they were both completely different than the color shown. The orange is shown almost like a salmon, but when they arrived they were construction orange! No joke! The blue pair I ordered looked gorgeous and subtle, but nope they were more of a teal blue color. So odd, I am not sure why the photos were tweaked with the color shown to be lighter? They should advertise the ACTUAL color of these shorts, not a dimmed version. I’ve never had a problem like this with this brand. Just wanted to warn others about that! The only reason I’m giving two stars is because they still fit cute when I tried them on, but I am more of a subtle color person. I returned both pairs."
2.0,Order in Asian sizes - cut much smaller than expected
2.0,It wasn't at all what I was expecting material-wise.  Maybe I didn't read the details clearly but I mainly went off the reviews.  It's ok but I wouldn't order again.  Definitely not oversize and it doesn't really look like the picture.  The material is shiny and the picture doesn't look that way at all.  I would have sent it back but it took forever to get so I  just wear it around the house.
2.0,it would be perfect if i wouldnt have to move the wires a bit for it to turn on. other than that my 4year old loves it so were just gonna have to work with it.
2.0,Very flimsy. I put one on for 5 minutes and it broke. Very pretty even though there just beads
2.0,"These were pretty, but Bed Stu doesn't understand how to make boots.  We ordered a size 9, and they were too small.  So, we ordered a size 9.5, and they were the EXACT SAME SIZE.  I hadn't been to the post office yet, so we still had the size 9s sitting around to compare against.  They were, without exaggeration, the exact same size.  So, either Bed Stu doesn't understand there should be a half size difference between a 9 and a 9.5, or they just don't have any quality control.  Either way, for the price of their products, I expected far better."
2.0,"I bought these specifically for the really cool dangling ones. I don't have any piercings and I was really excited for some fun clip ons. But these aren't clip ons. The cuffs themselves are fake, but the dangly ones have the sharp bits that go into ear holes. Beyond disappointed."
2.0,These were way too small!!
2.0,Item broke 2 days after receiving it.
2.0,Not as good as the picture
2.0,"NOT SILK!! I didn't read the &#34;fine print &#34;. It said Silk, at the top of the page, the moment I touched it,  I thought -oh crap.... I checked the interior tag, and sure enough...lesson learned. If you don't mind poly, they aren't made badly. I'll use them for travel, maybe I'll forget them on a bathroom hook somewhere..."
2.0,Very pretty & large but pinches ear. Hurts so bad I can inly wear for short time.
2.0,I only received one pair.<br />I thought there would be 3.
2.0,"The shades are very dark, nice if you're trying to block out a lot of light. It's got a strong yellow/tan tint even though the color is blue. These are both acceptable for very cheap shades. But there's a clearly visible manufacturing defect running along the left arm for an inch and a half from about the ear. These are white frames, so maybe if they were darker frames it wouldn't be so visible. I will not be wearing these due to the defect. Disappointing."
2.0,"It is just ugly.  The material is more like canvas.  Hangs bad, looks bad so unless you want to get in touch with your inner tent just say no."
2.0,I am a size 8.5 for shoes and these socks wouldn't stay long before they began to slide down.
2.0,The strap broke immediately after she started using it. It was a gift so it was too complicated for my mother in law to return.
2.0,Not the best quality and the wrist button hole it not there. But it look cute and is warm. I would not buy it again.
2.0,My head measures 23&#34; which is the top end of Large for most of the hats I looked at. This &#34;one size fits most&#34; was too small for me. The brim was also bent a bit by the shipping box being just a bit too narrow.
2.0,"Almost lasted the whole weekend. Purchased to use for a music festival. Carried sunscreen, phone, keys, wallet, and a couple of other small items. It started to unravel on the third day."
2.0,Purchased to use on my AF1 sneakers. The product seemed good until I tried them on. The product did not really seem to work and it creased my sneakers pretty bad after an hour or two.
2.0,it had one 6 and 3 4g tapers
2.0,The product was advertised as an extra large is a size 12. However a size 12 is normally a large. I ordered the extra large pearly items description and it's way too big. The item is also supposed to have boy shorts and it did not. It came with a bikini bottom.
2.0,"The sweater is alright and will be nice and stylish for when the winter comes, but the picture makes it looks as if it can be worn in warmer weather. The model must be very, very small because the dress fits very tight and it looks loose on her. And I'm very small and petite. Also the dress in the photo looks blue and mine is gray. Which is okay, I was just looking forward to getting a flimsy, little blue dress I could wear with a cute pair of sandals but this is clearly a wintery dress."
2.0,"I think it is beatiful but a bit short if the gem set was removable or at least I had known it was not, I would have given it 5 stars."
2.0,"Received today. Seems good and sturdy, but it didn't come with all the items shown to make it easy to replace links. My husband struggled for over half an hour and gave up."
2.0,Only lasted for a few weeks before breaking on my boyfriend at work. Waste of money.
2.0,"Runs very small, not true to size....very cute though..."
2.0,Didn't really like the way it fitted
2.0,"Have never written a bad review of a Lands' End piece until now. The fabric pills like crazy! Also, it's so delicate, the velcro on my Lands' End squall parka picks at it wherever it may accidentally hit it. Had to trim a place on the shoulder so I could wear it."
2.0,Fit not too good
2.0,"The credit card and ID slots are a TIGHT fit. Gotta work this model in. I like the look, but If I'd known how much work it would be getting cards in and out, I'd have passed."
2.0,"I loved the color and the size. The purse came wrapped in protective plastic and still had tags. It was obviously a new bag, but looked like it was sitting in storage for a very long time. The leather-looking material on the handle was dry, cracked, and pulled away from the stitching. I was very disappointed and requested a return, but they graciously gave me my money back. For this reason I gave it two stars, otherwise I only would have given one star."
2.0,"This is very thin, cheap leather. I don't know what I was expecting at this price point, but I was thinking it would be nicer than this. I've seen nicer paper."
2.0,I am a 32 DD and the 2 straps above the breasts were too big they just hung down. I thought it would have fit good cause it's stretchy but those two straps were way too big!
2.0,Junk. One pearl was already broken off when I received it. Too cheaply made and not the quality I thought it would be.
2.0,"*Update 2 - 9/1/16<br />If I'm honest, these actually became unbearable in short order. I avoid them in my legging pile, and may end up just tossing them in the &#34;upcycle&#34; pile soon. They're scratchy, and pill quickly after washing just a couple times. I'd almost be inclined to just chalk up my displeasure with them to my sensory issues, but I stopped in to a Goodwill the other day to look around and discovered that their athleticwear/ leggings section is peppered with these exact leggings, most of their interiors in the same condition that makes them unwearable for me. I'm obviously not the only one who felt this way about them. On the upside, my Goodwill trip did yield three pairs of leggings I'm thrilled with, in excellent condition, and for less than I paid for these. I recommend second hand shopping for leggings if you're on a budget. You'll probably end up with much nicer things at a much nicer price (though I realize how comfortable shopping from your phone is, I really do.). *wink*<br /><br />*Update 6/22/16 after ordering twice more:<br />I ordered these originally in the charcoal grey color. They fit well and are very comfortable. They're soft with a lot of stretch, but I feel like they may be a bit see though where they stretch the most. I wear them anyway and just wear a stretch mini skirt to make sure everything's covered. No biggie, and I like the style. The inner fleece, after several washings, is not as comfortable as it was when they were new, but it's not intolerable and I'm very sensitive to that.<br /><br />The second pair I ordered in Black. They seem to be a different fabric than they grey ones. It's thicker, and completely opaque. They're still very soft, but they seem to be cut smaller or not have as much give in stretch, though they do stretch very well and offer good compression. I can't really say much about the fit of that pair, though, because the first time I tried to put them on and got them halfway up, I realized there was a hole in the seam at the inside of my thigh. Bummer. I have a sewing machine. Repairing them quickly is probably less hassle than returning them for me, but may not be for everyone.<br /><br />I'd had a pretty hectic week and it slipped my mind that I'd already ordered that second pair and found a hole. I ended up reordering another pair in black, in a late night haze, and they arrived today. These are the same fabric as the other black pair, but arrived with a tag and a cardboard insert that they were folded around. The other didn't have that, and it makes me wonder if they were maybe already returned once. The second pair of black is also more snug than the grey ones, but they still fit my curvy frame comfortably, and they truly are not at all transparent. There were no holes in the seams, however the length is shorter than the grey ones I bought originally. They grey ones I can pull over my heel no problem. This last pair I actually pulled up to be pedal pushers because 1) they feel more comfortable in the hips with the extra fabric there, and 2) they fall naturally at the actual narrowest part of your ankle. Maybe it's just personal preference, but I like to have my leggings either come down on my foot a little bit or to cut off above the actual ankle. They feel great that way, though, and with it being summer I don't really mind.<br /><br />Just, be prepared for the fact that fit and sizing may may not be uniform, or may be dependent on the fabric corresponding to the color you choose. I still think it's a pretty great deal, they're workable and very comfortable. I can fix the hole in the second pair, even though I'm not happy about receiving them that way. I don't regret my purchase and I'm glad I have them. I still give them four stars, but I'll probably keep shopping around for an alternative.<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />These are a solid 5 stars for fit and comfort. I'm 5'4&#34;, about 185 lbs, and wear a US size 16. These were an incredibly comfortable fit. The deduction of a star is due to the fact that the material is still pretty thin. They're definitely opaque, but I ordered the charcoal, and I feel like you can maybe see just the faintest hint of my (incredibly pale) skin behind the fabric. I remedied any potential unwanted ramifications of this by buying a couple thin stretch mini skirts, bodycon style, to wear with leggings. I pair them with either knee high boots or my sanuk sandals, and it's incredibly comfortable and versatile. I pretty much wear leggings of some sort daily, year round, and this is definitely going to be my go-to this summer. I will undoubtedly be back for more."
2.0,The earrings were really cute! But they arrived broken
2.0,Too bulky. Buttons do not work. Not a good watch.
2.0,"This item is not as described or pictured. The yellow/gold and black lumberjack or buffalo plaid is what is shown, and the style is cute. What I got is gingham tablecloth print, and the cut is very drab. It runs big, so if you do order, get a size smaller than what you normally wear. I was very disappointed. I am finding that when ordering from Amazon for clothing, stick to known brand names."
2.0,"Extremely thin and flimsy. I feel like I could snap it in half by accident. I purchased it for a gift, but I'm returning it to avoid embarrassing myself"
2.0,"This watch is large!  Like Flava Flave large.  The face of it is the size of a silver dollar - it covers the top half of arm/wrist.  You won't need glasses to see the time.  The band looks fine.  However, the price is so low... I will keep it for gardening or running."
2.0,The material gets little pulls all over! I’ve worn it twice and it is not fit for the third time! Very disappointing!
2.0,The top is good and looks good too but the bottom was little on a larger and I didn’t like quality of the material.
2.0,"I was using the main carabiner with the pocket knife for the past month.  Unfortunately, the locking mechanism broke after such a short period of time and I lost a set of keys on a key ring.  If the locking mechanism didn't break, I would have given it 5 stars, but I had to pay extra to replace the keys lost.  I was somewhat peeved I had to spend additional $20 to replace the keys.  The regular carabiners are holding up well with me and the kids at the moment and I believe the regular ones hold up better."
2.0,I like the look of the band however the description can’t be accurate. It is super tight. I have the same band in a different color and it fits perfect however this one had the same description and it is super tight. I asked the seller to send extra links and was told they would however I have yet to receive them. If I ever get them and am satisfied with my purchase I will update my review.
2.0,"The compression felt good until it got to the band at the top of the sock where it was way, way too tight.  What a shame that these socks are not sized to fit different sized legs.  They were also too long for me (at 5' 2"") and I had to work with them to keep them below my knee without folding over the tops.  This compression of 15-20 mg seems to be pretty standard (most socks have this) but I had to go to 8-15 mg.  Wanted to, but didn't return them since I'd worn one pair.  The manufacturer should also base the size on calf width as well as sock/shoe size."
2.0,The belt IS NOT 41-49 inches.  It is exactly 44 inches long.  Do not be fooled.  The quality was exactly what I was looking for though.
2.0,"I wish there was even one person who made a point about how heavy this bag is! It's a heavy bag to begin with and putting my stuff in it will make it even heavier. Sometimes, it's impossible to carry. I would have liked to return it, but the cost of shipping for such a heavy and big item is not worth it.<br />I'm just disappointed!"
2.0,"Very, very, very lightweight.  It broke within 2 weeks.  Not worth buying."
2.0,"This was no means a 2x.  My daughter in law wears a 16 and it fit her good.  Very thin material, will need a skirt to keep it from being see though. I gave it a couple stars because the price was good and fast shipping"
2.0,This is cheaply made. The straps came uncrossed but are crossed in the picture. When I went to switch them the metal basically crumpled in my hands for the straps to connect... it could be cute otherwise but you don’t want to pay and then have that happen... I had to safety pin it
2.0,"I like the way that this product fits but when I opened them, I put vinyl monograms on them for my bridesmaids... when I went to lay them out I noticed that they are two different colors even though I ordered 6 of the same gown. I’m very disappointed."
2.0,"I noticed that the vegetables have  moisture when i store them in these cotton bags. The quality is average, only reason am keeping these because i got it on pretty cheap deal."
2.0,"This body suit is so see-through it's not even funny. and it's so tight and form fitting that you can't wear anything under it at all, making it basically useless if you're above a size 2"
2.0,If your going to order. Please order more than you need. I ordered 160 with less than 60 working. Very disappointed.  I should have listened to the reviews. It also took 3 weeks to receive so now by the time I get replacements (if I do) it will be after the event I needed them for.
2.0,"I wore these as part of a halloween costume and altho they were super cute, they annoyed the crap out of me because they would not stay up.  The legs have a velcro closure instead of elastic. The velcro doesn't hold and you spend alll night tripping over them, pulling them up, and then tripping over them again!  When you're not tripping over them, other people step on them and you both trip."
2.0,"I actually love this shirt. It’s my favorite shirt by far that I’ve ever found. The only reason I’m giving it two stars is because they haven’t restocked the large in a long time and I’m hoping to catch the distributors attention. You can’t even find them on line if you Google the brand. If they get more large in stock or give me an estimated time the wheel, I can make it five stars. Please get more in stock."
2.0,"Had it less than a month and the wire strand with the beads broke,was really disappointed because I really liked the bracler"
2.0,This is a so so short.  The seeing came apart at the cuff of the sleeves after a few washings. And the waist stretched out :(
2.0,Awkward fit. I’m a little on the curvy side but leggings continue to fall off me during the day and unable to wear them unless I have a shirt that fully covers my behind. Awkward in the crotch area as well. Wouldn’t purchase again.
2.0,Hat looks cool but when I put it on it puffs out and doesn’t fit to the shape of my head so makes me look like a kid wearing his dads hat.
2.0,The wires aren’t tucked in safely for younger kids to wear.  Some of the batteries have already popped out and it’s only secured onto the headband by scotch tape.  It’s fun for a few hours but it’s not well made.
2.0,Stitching is very uneven. Doesn’t look like the photo.
2.0,"I love everything about this robe, except the zipper almost immediately would pull right open from the bottom."
2.0,"These are adorable, and the socks themselves are nice and well made, but the toe beans are falling off after barely any use. Makes me kind of sad :("
2.0,"Got these for my wedding to keep the shirt tucked in.  These did not work and I did not wear them.  The short answer is that they were too big and I ordered the wrong size bc these are China made/designed.  The size break down and conversion is confusing.  Disappointed as I needed a large or American size 36, and these are not what I got.  I think I got at least a 38 American.  And there's no way to make this design work when its too big."
2.0,flimsy fabric
2.0,This was an XS but sadly it's too baggy on me. It's now my pj's. Quality is decent but definitely doesn't look as good as in the picture.
2.0,After one use the product still slips & stretches quite a bit.
2.0,"No sizing information to go on, cycling gear runs small in my experience.<br /><br />Round 1: Bought XXL.  I'm 6'0"" and 190lbs.  XXL was a parachute on me so returning and getting a large.  Will update the review and rating once I try the large out.<br /><br />Round 2: Bought L.  Arms are ok, it expects you to have a decent beer gut because the front droops down and looks odd.  Would not recommend the L unless you are 6'0 and about 220-230.<br /><br />I ended up buying the ProViz Nightrider jacke and love it."
2.0,"Chipped silver paint upon arrival, luckily I got it free with a promo code"
2.0,This is a small charm on a cheap chain.  Not recommended.
2.0,"This is clearly an inferior product.  No belt loop holder, unfinished edges, too wide  --  poor design & mediocre construction.  This is a very weak offering, not worth Amazon's fronting.  It will have to be returned."
2.0,Was made for a slim woman.
2.0,Falls off constantly. Put them on just for them to fall off. Cute idea though
2.0,Good quality but too small I bought a 3X and I can barely button it disappointed I am 6 ft 3 in 295 lb male
2.0,"Flashed sometimes, but wouldn't stay lit on arrival.  Had to peel apart the glued together fabric, pull some wires loose from the glue for some slack, and resolder.  Then hot melt glue it back closed.  After that, awesome and cute.  Looks like the assembler may randomly over stress the wire connections.  From the other reviews, you may or may not get one with electronics that survived.  5 stars if you don't mind risk of sending back or fixing."
2.0,"I wasn't impressed with this bracelet. I use very high quality oils and I can barely smell the oils after I apply them.  I prefer the necklace that has the felt pad. I saw the bracelets that have the felt pads, but I was looking for something I could slip over my wrist. The quality of the bracelet is nice though."
2.0,Loved the picture.  Looks cheap in real life.  Very disappointed.
2.0,"I ordered this shall for a wedding. I order the dark  charcoal gray one months ago and it’s the right color. My sister order one choose charcoal gray and got the lighter blue gray. I decided to just click buy again on my order because I got the right color the first time. But it  arrived  today in the wrong color again, the blue gray and not the charcoal gray. Disappointed this was meant to be for a wedding and we all needed the same color.  I will be returning the blue gray shall."
2.0,Quality of cloth is not comfortable.
2.0,"I bought a large and typically wear a large, however the cut on this is so weird. When I first put it on, the length was fine. (I’m 5’2”) however the top section was suuuuuper low cut. So low that when I put on a bra with it, the entire bra and even my skin below was showing. When I tightened the straps AAAALLL the way up to fix this, the dress was way to short, like flashing people short. Not even possible with no bra as I’d be flashing everyone"
2.0,Too gaudy instead of dressy. Hard to use. Sent back without wearing.
2.0,"Dress has a tube top, if you will, built in and does not stay up on its own. We tried pinning/stitching it up but the material isn’t wide enough to cover cleavage."
2.0,"The dress we received was a much darker blue than the light that is advertised, and its not as fluffy as the picture indicates.  Seems to be made well enough for play."
2.0,Didn't realize it was all one piece looks like something out of the 80's. Very disappointed
2.0,Kids loved them. However soles lifted after one use. Disappointed.
2.0,"I’ve been in love with this style for a couple years, and I forgot about them until I found them on here. I was excited because these are almost half retail...but when it seems too good to be true, it usually is. I’m not really sure if these are authentic, and if they are, they must be a return or something. The pair I received looked relatively new but had smudges on the lenses. Also, after wearing the glasses for only one day, the nose pads fell off after one wear. In addition, I didn’t receive an authenticity card or anything. This bothered me because Prada has really good customer service, so when your glasses break, they usually will offer to fix it or replace them with the same style (or a different one if it’s not available). So if you don’t have an authenticity card, how can you receive that service?<br /><br />Amazon offered me the option to exchange, but I just decided to return them since I didn’t feel confident with this purchase. I ended up ordering from Macy’s for $400 since I love the way these look on me. Yes, I know the markup is a lot higher, but I feel more comfortable knowing my purchase is authentic. I hope that others have a better experience than I did."
2.0,"It's nice, but does run very ,very small. A medium is like an small size( 5-6 dress size ).so returning & purchase sized up"
2.0,"I thought I had ordered a xlarge size. Opening the package, a medium size was sent.  Not long enough!<br />Will check the size when ordering again."
2.0,"Updated review. This product looks great, but the mechanism doesn't keep time. I guess the price should have been a giveaway. Anyhow, beware if you wish a working watch."
2.0,"Based on the size chart, I ordered the XXL. I'm 5'11 and weigh 200lbs. They were way too big. The Large would probably have fit well. Returned them and ordered Souke instead.<br />Sometimes cheaper is not necessarily better!"
2.0,This product did not fit and was more than a size off. It didn't fit the same way it appears to fit the model and just seemed awkwardly made.
2.0,Looks like 3x but can't even get it over my head!
2.0,"Absolutely love this tunic! The reason for the low rating is it came with a hole in it (in the front under my chest), but I needed to wear it for a work function. Disappointed, but I still wear it. It’s the perfect amount of flow and doesn’t cling to your tummy."
2.0,I did not realize how shear it is. I don't know how to ware it
2.0,Fits great and came before stated but you have to really push hard on your device to use it. Makes it difficult to use any functions on your watch besides the side buttons.
2.0,Didn't fit. I usually wear a small and thats what I got but it fit too loose
2.0,It is an average product. A bit on the smaller size and the fabric is also average.
2.0,These shoe strings were advertised as wax strings.  Not what I consider waxed.
2.0,"It just didn't fit right. and the zipper was very sticky. I thought the design looked super cute, but it was tight in the chest and extremely loose in the waist. I got a medium and my measurements are 34, 27, and 37."
2.0,They  are very tight behind the ears unfortunately.
2.0,"Cheap, smell terrible, very small and almost no elasticity.  If you are looking for something of quality or for an adult, keep looking.  They served their purpose but couldn’t wait to cut them off and throw them away."
2.0,"Very poorly made watch band. The band itself isn't so much the problem although it only has one loop to tuck the band into whereas most bands have two loops. The connectors that attach the band to your watch look to be cheaply made and continue to snap off when I'm wearing it. I've snapped it back into place multiple times but the problem has persisted, and the band is no longer wearable."
2.0,I wanted to love this. But it was way to small.  But two sizes up.
2.0,The hat is too small for an adult. On the hat it says 14 and older. It's misleading to say that this us a trucker hat if the target consumer is 14. Who is trucking at 14 years old?<br /><br />The hat is well made. If you have a smaller gead than most than this will fit you. The hat does fit me but i have to use the last notch.
2.0,"I purchased the black and the blue in L & XL, but both of them were tight through the thigh. The XL was super baggy in the waist and belly region, even though the L fit better in the belly, they were way too tight in the thigh and bum areas. Plus the linen was SUPER SCRATCHY! Maybe they would relax in the wash, but since they didn't even fit properly, I wasn't going to experiment. If you're body shape has really skinny legs, no butt, and maybe a little belly, these will be great for you. However, I am more curvy in leg& bum region and not so much belly. Hope this review helps!"
2.0,Wasn’t what we expected..
2.0,"Really cute,  but waaaay too small. Definitely Asian sizes.  Basically my husband bought suspenders and a collar/tie thingy,  because the skirt is useless."
2.0,"The sleeves were too tight the rest of the dress fit, but the skirt wasn’t flowing in the picture it was rather stiff the lace portion of the sleeves it wasn’t trimmed.  There were pieces of fabric hanging off from the embroidery part. It was pretty just wasn’t done well I had to ship it back to China. Very difficult.  This return was also to be free and it wasn't, do I get a refund of the $66.00 dollars I spent to send this dress back to the seller."
2.0,"I bought a medium first. It was huge so I ordered a small next to compare sizes. There is no difference between small and medium. The first picture is of the small laying directly on top of the medium. The second is them side by side. Complete waste of time ordering and returning. Also, these are not cozy sweatshirts. They are that thin silky tshirt material. Returning both."
2.0,Poor quality image. Returning.
2.0,"This is a really cute outfit, but the orange on the accessories pieces (all the bows) doesn’t match the “orange” on the top! On the top, the pumpkin almost looks red! 😔 Disappointing!"
2.0,"Cheap plastic attached to the mask, it gets foggy. No good!"
2.0,"The suit is cute and fits well, BUT the product description said it was &#34;polyester and spandex&#34;, but it's NYLON.  I swim multiple times a week at the gym, and no matter how well I take care of my suit, nylon simply does not hold up in chlorinated water.  If I had kept it, the fabric would have been sagging and separating from the lining within 2 months.  Very disappointing!"
2.0,"To small for me.. don't keep their shape, can't seem to connect the back together after wearing only once. Might be that my earlobes are to thick.."
2.0,"The fabric is not like patio umbrella fabric should be, it is a very thin fabric, and very see through.<br />I've had several umbrellas and this has to be the worst--don't go by the one 5 star review.  Very<br />disappointed as I liked the color (that's all I liked)"
2.0,"The product is NOT as shown in the image at all. It is a SHORT, SKIN TIGHT dress underneath a very THIN veil of fabric. Not attractive and looks very sleezy. The only reason it's not getting one star is that it did have a nice color, as indicated in photo, but had to return. It was too long anyway. Simultaneously too long and too short..."
2.0,Not to happy about them! They say it is for kids but they are very big for a toddler! Not I'm sorry but not happy!
2.0,"Band was gold, not the color shown. And the material looks cheap, not elegant"
2.0,Loved the design.. But flimsy.. It broke the 1st day I got it..smh wanna get another one but too afraid it would break too.. Gonna find another Ankh with a different seller..
2.0,It didn't do it for me. Cheap material and unflattering on my body type.
2.0,Missing 1 bead
2.0,one step above a Walmart purse. Glad it was on sale or I would have returned it.
2.0,They are not a super soft material! Thicker than expected. Not sure I’ll be keeping. :(
2.0,I thought the picture could've been larger very small for the size of the dog tag
2.0,"i weigh 170, 5ft 5in and bought an xl. Theses pants fit me like im 6ft tall. also i wore a few times and theres already a hole in the butt.  Everything fit well except for the length"
2.0,I wouldn't wear this in public but I would for gardening.
2.0,"I was absolutely thrilled when I ordered this jacket.  It's comfortable, flattering, reversible, etc.  Adorable to wear around the barn and then for your evening errands.  Washes beautifully.<br /><br />Be careful with the soft side...your velcro gloves, phone holder, etc will snag it horribly.  So, as it wears out I use it with the smoother side showing.<br /><br />Then, I wore it in the rain.  There is nothing even remotely water resistant about this jacket.  I was soaked.<br /><br />Overall, cute jacket.  Not practical."
2.0,"It does not quite style, 'on' like it shows in the picture"
2.0,Not as expected- very Cheap and thin material. I gave it 2 stars for softness but it will not keep you warm if that’s what you are looking for.
2.0,"It’s stretchy shiny material, almost like swimsuit material. I ordered XL and I normally wear size 10, but it fit somethat tight in the chest and arms. The fabric underneath is white. I will not buy again."
2.0,Perfect gift. But the battery is already dead.
2.0,Very flimsy. Bag bends in half unless there's something inside of it. It started to fray relatively quickly. I would not recommend. It didn't even last a year before i decided to toss it.
2.0,"The color was everything I expected, and the neckline was great. But there is a seam that doesn't show up in the picture, except for the black and white one, that hits just under the hips and makes for a VERY awkward silhouette. It's unfortunate, because it doesn't seem to serve a purpose and without it, I would have loved the dress."
2.0,These were smaller than expected
2.0,These were smaller than size. Very tight and low rise.
2.0,It's a t shirt sleeve.
2.0,"These boots are cute and they are comfortable but I do not think they are really Frye boots. When I looked at them more closely and compared them to the Frye boots bought directly from Frye I noticed that the logo is different, the insole is fake leather, the soles and heels are rubber, and the boot pulls and zippers don’t look my other boots. I talked to Amazon, 6 PM and emailed Frye with my concerns.<br /><br />**11/5/18** Update**<br /> I received a response from Frye. I hope this helps other concerned purchasers of these boots<br /><br />""Thanks for contacting The Frye Company!

2.0,Came in and they are pretty however the tip that goes in your ears where two different sizes. I had to stretch my ears a bit for one of them but the other was a normal piercing hole size. Giving the 2 stars mostly because they are pretty but if not I'd give 1 for the pins being 2 different sizes.
2.0,Very small barley fit in my nose couldn’t screw any balls on
2.0,"Cute and fit well. Unfortunately, the heels didn’t make it past the first time I wore them."
2.0,Works to hold u up
2.0,"I love the quality and price , just does not effectively cover a 3x person"
2.0,The shirt is listed as 14yrs which I though would be perfect since my kid is 11...barely fits.  I would compare it to a kids size 8-10.  Please look at my post on the seller...they do not allow us to post issues here and will refuse my post.
2.0,"Cons: Wide, low cut v-neck PLUS tight waistband makes the sweater fit very unattractive."
2.0,"Arms are too long and it's shorter in torso than on the model in picture.  Overall, not a good purchase"
2.0,Purse is much smaller than it looks.
2.0,"At first I thought these were great shirt stays. They are easy to attach, keep my shirt pulled tight, and seem like they are of pretty good quality. My problem with them is that they come off too easily. I have a pretty active job, and I have yet to have a day where at least one of the shirt stays doesn't pop off. If you are using them for a desk job they would likely work very well, but if you have a more active job I'd go with a different set."
2.0,"So I ordered the size I wear in underware (m) and it arrived intact by expected delivery date. I does fit though on the tight side, would probably order a size up if you are to order and that may be why all of it rolled down. Every strap rolled onto itself and so it looks silly. Will not be able to wear. Seems like good material and a very vibrant color. Might fit someone not as curvy as that could also be the reason for the rolling. Also feel the opening on the bottom could be longer on both sides."
2.0,"I bought 3x burgundy and purple dress. This size should have been too large for me, but it is not. It is too small and shorter than it should have been according to description and picture. AT the chest it is just weird the way it lays. Considering I am large busted, this would have been the area I would have expected it to be too tight, but it was not, it was smaller at the hips. I found the outer layer and jacket portion to be a scratchy material as well."
2.0,One of the bracelets fell apart pretty quickly
2.0,Held me in Very Good for 1WEEK....I noticed the material was rather cheap (for lack of a better word) when I received it. But chalked it up as the reason it would NOT show under my clothing.....but when the zipper BROKE after wearing it for only 4-5 times I am NOT TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED!!!! : (
2.0,This mask does not cover your face properly. It looks bunched up and doesn't fit well at all or lay comfortably on your face
2.0,"Had to buy larger size to fit calves, so when I pull them up the heel is on my ankle! Why can't anyone make nice things for curvy women!!!!"
2.0,The color ivory is not what is pictured. I bought the set because I needed the ivory for family photos. The container says “soft ivory” looks white to me and everyone else I’ve shown them to. Disappointed.
2.0,I guess you get for what u paid for. Jacket is really slim so for the winter it's not gonna protect anyone but if it's just for style great choice
2.0,Product looked very cute- fitted around the ankle and nice Rubber Sole; however the pair was incomplete and size much too tiny. Began to process return right away and return the package with my mail carrier; however I am still waiting on the refund or notification that they received my return.
2.0,"While I like the look of these, while trying them on I noticed odd sparkles in my vision.  I took them off to further inspect and saw that inside of the lenses are horribly scratched. The tool was also not included in the package. Disappointing as I really wanted to like these."
2.0,Cheap item
2.0,Don't like the material...
2.0,Very poor quality for the price.
2.0,I really wanted to like this shirt. It’s cute. However it has a seam that run right down the middle of the shirt. Right down the front middle of the shirt. Why the seam isn’t just down the sides I have no idea. Definitely a design flaw. I would not recommend this shirt…sorry.
2.0,Product not what I was hoping for. More for a costume not a robe.
2.0,"My glasses held up fine with the plastic eyeglass holders. I was worried about this based on other reviews, but I didn't experience this problem. Something I didn't read about that I did experience, however, was how this thing can catch hair. I stopped using it less than a week in because it caught my hair at the back of my neck with nearly every movement, and I didn't like having to extract my hair from its torturing grip nearly every minute. If you have hair that doesn't rest on the back of your next, then it will probably be okay for you."
2.0,"Looks cute when it's on. I had to replace the clasp, it was broken in the package.  I wear jewelry like this frequently for modeling, prefer a pair vs just one."
2.0,"Really cute, even tho I had to give the dress to my teen...order 2 sizes up."
2.0,Super cute outfit! But I ordered a 6-9 months and when I got it it was more like a 2t size. It was way to big.
2.0,"I don't think this type of stretchy material is meant to be slenderizing, way too much fabric up top that caused some bunching in the crotch when sitting. I went by the size chart and ordered an 11 since I have a 30"" waist but it was way too big. I probably could have fit into a 7 or 9 because of how stretchy they are, but I think the inseam would have been too short on me anyways. I have a 31"" inseam, and the bottom hem hit about an inch or two above my ankle and was baggy. Definitely was not feeling these, they are going back."
2.0,Flimsy socks that start pilling and disintegrating after one wear.
2.0,I just took it out to wear and noticed that the there is a loose piece near collar that is not sewn down. It's probably going to be  a one wear die to possible fraying when washed.
2.0,"Fits snug.  Not so much &#34;A-line&#34; as the photo suggests.  Nicely made, vibrant color, and soft material though.  I am returning this, unfortunately."
2.0,"This dress said US8, I wear US 8 and it was very small. Wasted money, had to give it away."
2.0,"Pictures don’t roll back into film, photos printed on printer paper and cut out and put into the key chain. Disappointed"
2.0,too small for church
2.0,The zipper broke within a week
2.0,"Was supposed to be a 2xl,  was actually more like a large. I paid 30$ for a sweater I'll never wear. Thanks alot"
2.0,"Loved this ring but washed my hands, one time, and it was full of water."
2.0,"Loved the feel of the material, but the yellow color was too thin....I am wearing it as a nightgown.  It feels very pleasant against my skin."
2.0,The shorts are cut too tight and not what I wanted.
2.0,"I was looking for a tankini that wasn't too long. This sits at waist (I'm 5'4"") but the chest area is really loose. Padding is set too high. Bottoms are really cute, and great fit without pinching around the thighs."
2.0,"There were no returns or I would have returned them. Pretty pattern, love that. The fabric is slippery and does not cushion. It made the glasses slip mor off my head. I would not recommend."
2.0,The threading is scratchy and uncomfortable. It also shrunk significantly when I washed it.
2.0,"It is just a Ring, a literal circle, cut out of a tube, rather than having a bit of a nose contour, so when worn, if you have glasses, you will fog them up non stop. (though the neck area, is a V neck kind of bib thing.)<br /><br />Other than that, its fairly decent, though it is a thin material."
2.0,Not true to size at all. I wear a large but purchased an XL to be safe. Did not zip up all the way and arms were extremely tight.
2.0,Looked kind of cheap almost like a costume. Very cheap lace and material not sure how long it would last.  It put me in mind of a witches costume for Halloween ... but that’s just me.
2.0,The only problem I have with this product is that it doesn't stand up to my constant moving and grooving.  Perfect for those who just need to keep a shirt tucked in but didn't work for me.  Maybe if the button heads were bigger or if they were metal clips...
2.0,Not very adjustable..
2.0,"I knew that the mask would not be the best quality when I bought it, so the plastic components did not surprise me at all.  However, I did not expect that the bottom of the mask would look as if it was cut with scissors.  The line was not even and some of the backing was showing at the bottom edges.  I assume from this uneven edge that the item had been tampered with by a previous buyer and then returned.  If that is not the case, I am not impressed with the general quality of this item.  If it is the case, I think that the sellers need to be more careful in their inspections of returned goods.<br /><br />Other than this issue, the mask fits as well as it could be expected to.  It serves the purpose of adding intrigue to an unknown person, as you cannot see most of their face.<br /><br />For those considering buying this, I have to mention that it attaches to one's face using a headband, so you might want to keep that in mind when planning how to do your hair."
2.0,"Love the fit and color of these pants. Unfortunately, the seem in the butt has started to come undone."
2.0,"The earrings are beautiful!! But, right after I opened them and put one in, I realized one of the earrings were missing the middle diamond, so sadly, o have to return them"
2.0,The dress part is cut for a paper doll…zero arm room or room to move your arm like a human. Also the 2XL I ordered is like a small on top but then roomy on the bottom. The cape has black Velcro squares to hold it shut…I’ll remove those and use buttons. The bonnet needs a wire to hold it open. A lot of work is needed to make this work. Very disappointed
2.0,Its a cute ring but broke in 2 pieces just after wearing it one time.
2.0,Bought these for my husband as a back up set for the saddle bag. These do have padding however they do not fit snug as most riding glasses we purchase. When your going down the road in the wind the last thing you want is your eyes watering! They are OK for weaging in the truck and look nice.
2.0,The lens part of the goggle popped out shortly after purchasing...didn't even make it to the water.
2.0,"Uncomfortable back, it narrowed down and my 3,5yo couldn’t put it on. Returned"
2.0,Not what I was expecting. I thought it was a helmet not a rubber mask. Didn't come with any instructions.
2.0,"This product runs small, not good for large chested ladies sadly, I bought an xl, ended up giving it to my mom who is a medium and it fit her perfectly"
2.0,This item showed up broken.
2.0,"Not comfortable, doesn’t fit right, loses grip easily"
2.0,Sleeves were too short on me. I got the XXL and I’m 6’2. Appearance and comfort was good for the price.
2.0,"It is pretty but awkward. The charm is decent size, and has a good amount of bling, but it refuses to sit correctly on the wrist. It flops over, it flips backwards and I am constantly having to readjust the bracelet and charm to set it straight.  Thinking I could be &#34;wearing&#34; the bracelet wrong, I had several friends of mine try this on, and they all complained about the same exact thing. It is nice to look at, but not a comfortable wear unless you do not intend on moving your wrist/hand/arm at all."
2.0,"The item was too small and the material felt like spandex workout clothing,"
2.0,wasnt really able to wear it because i got it way too big for me??? i keep making the mistake of sizing things up on amazon lmao i could smell the dye in the shirt it smelled really sweet but the fabric of the shirt felt really cheap
2.0,Cute earrings but advertise 4 pairs and only received 3. Missing the star shaped pair
2.0,sleeves are what too short for the overall sizing
2.0,"The clasp is almost impossible to work and the bit is much smaller than I thought it would be. It's pretty, but I haven't been able to wear it because the clasp is so horrible."
2.0,The material wasn't as thick as I expected. The Med Sleeve brand is much better.
2.0,cloth chain fell apart then black &#34;stone&#34; fell out lasted about 2 weeks dont waist your money.
2.0,"I don't think it's a bad product per se, but it didn't work that great for me. I had hoped it would help with my glasses not fogging, and making the mask more comfortable, but it didn't.  I tried adjusting it and still couldn't get it to perform to my liking.  In the end, the piece was dripping with moisture from my respirations (wearing longer than 30 minutes performing normal tasks like grocery shopping, or shopping in general, not exercising).  I wouldn't buy again personally but they might work for someone else."
2.0,i dont like the fact that the pockets stick out and the material's a bit rough.
2.0,Very cheap and not a good fit. I ended up giving it to my daughter who is way smaller than me and it fits her okay. Might be okay for A and B cups and very petite frames.
2.0,"I ordered the apricot color, as the image on the listing made it appear almost a peachy mustard color. However it came today and it’s definitely a weird light pink color? Just be wary if you want a specific color… I got this for our family pictures and it won’t work for that since it ended up being the wrong color."
2.0,Why is the world so overcomplicated.  says size 6-12.  read the chart. blah blah blah  How bout this sock maker.  MAKE THE SOCKS THE SHOE SIZE.  Im a size 8.5 and these are a bit tight.  cuts off my blood circulation.  what would a size 12 do rip them.
2.0,Super cute but WAY too small and it was incredibly short. So short that we had to put a fluffy skirt in a corrospoding color underneath so her underwear didn’t show.
2.0,This<br />Is<br />Not<br />It!!!!
2.0,"The material is so cheap, like the table cloths from the Dollar Store. It also does not look excatly like the picture either. Huge dissapointment!"
2.0,They were inexpensive and they feel like it and probably look like it too
2.0,I really like the design of these clip on sunglasses very easy to put on but the grey is so dark I can't see the speedometer or other gauges on my car and I have them turned to the brightest level.  I like the design so much I am going to risk ordering the tea color and hope it is better.
2.0,Ripped the first night he wore it for Halloween.
2.0,It came with no charger or power bank and is not stated in the description which is disappointing
2.0,"So I wrote probably the longest review of my life on these socks sometime back but apparently that was under the 3 pack, and I gave the Super 60 a detailed positive explanation of why these are the best cotton socks on the market (Yes, i can't believe I wrote a review for socks).  I started buying the 6 packs and they all state New and Improved on the package...to make a long story short...<br /><br />couple months of wear (and I probably wear them 1 or twice a week) and they all develop holes in the elastic part.  Manufacturer wants pictures I can easily provide pictures with the holes always in the back of the elastic.  You can easily see it's the newer pairs that are developing holes too. Wigwam quality has gone horribly wrong.  I.m done, caveat emptor."
2.0,"Spend a few extra bucks and get better quality sleep wear. These fit funny - almost like they’re meant for girls, not women. Also, after one wash (before I wore them the first time) there was major fading. Also the stitching on them feels is poorly done. Feels like these are just gonna come apart in the second wash."
2.0,"I've had this rain jacket for just over a year now. I've washed it twice and it's basically fallen apart after 2 wash cycles. It's not even a good jacket... At all. It's a lot heavier than it looks, and the insulation would be great. IF, I lived in a colder cliamte, and not S. Carolina. Don't order this jacket if you live in a warmer climate area. Definitely, don't order this if you want a quality product. IF you never wash the jacket, I'm fairly certain it can last for years. I wouldn't risk the loss of money though."
2.0,"Absolutely worthless as a gun belt. It said it was .25"" thick bridle leather, so you think ""Wow, this must be a great gun belt, such heavy leather"". Then it arrives, and it's as stiff as a wet noodle. Wore it one day, 8 hours, and it had a sag in the back belt loop area (SOB carry). I have an Amish made belt I've worn for 5 years that has less give than this one does. Save your money kids, and buy something else. This one looks pretty but can't handle the weight."
2.0,"Sizes run very small, I'm a size 1and ordered a med & the neck was still a bit to tight for my comfort & they placed an elastic seam directed in the crotch which gives an unpleasing look. 🐫 So I'll most likely be wearing shorts with this romper if I dont sew in padding."
2.0,"This is a far over priced, cheap looking pendant that I would not recommend. When my daughter showed me the present I had bought her, I was embarrassed and immediately appologized for it being such low quality and not what I had hoped for."
2.0,The torso to where the frill starts was shorter than what i was expecting.  The fabric clings and does not breath well.
2.0,Beautiful dress but runs small.  XL fits like a S
2.0,Waaaaayyyyyy too small.  Not sized as advertised.
2.0,Very pretty but heavy in weight. One was cracked.
2.0,Cute color but the pockets stay out and it looks like you constantly have bunny ears popping out.
2.0,"The shoe is beautiful, however, it fits much too large.  Also, the deliver took so long, that there is no chance of getting a replacement and the likelihood of finding something else in time for my daughter's wedding is slim to none."
2.0,Its too small I cant zip it I needed about 2 more inches in the waist
2.0,"Very thin? Cold to ware, not really warm"
2.0,"It is completely shapeless, two rectangles of material sewn together, it is heavy and the material pilled on the first washing"
2.0,has an older look than I hoped.  sending it back.  very wide too. I considered cutting lengthwise into three scarves.
2.0,it doesn't look like the photo. returned it after I open the box.
2.0,I like led them but now the temples are loose and seems Nguni like crazy.  Unfortunately you can’t teally tighten the screws.
2.0,"received damaged, this gives me an indication as to how it will stand up to air travel.<br />Not a good sign that it will make it past one plane trip."
2.0,Top seemed to not be made properly . Fabric was not stitched together and there was gapping. I returned it immediately.
2.0,Nice material however its not red its brownish ugh but will keep
2.0,"From my girlfriend:<br />“ I was excited to get this! I purchased the one with shorts to give me more coverage. When it arrived, I received the lace one. Both super pretty but not what I ordered. Their customer service was great and they refunded me my purchase and I was happy using the lace version. BUT, it only lasted 3 wears before the stitching on the latch for the hook came apart. One after another throughout the day.  Now I’m left with just the zipper and no more hook and latches to help hold me in. I don’t think I got a size to small, i wanted to go smaller. “"
2.0,"I liked the pants, super cute and flowy, great for summer! Why I returned my pants is that even with the largest size it was still tight in the waist (I have a 28in Waistline)  Plus if you have a butt or hips, getting these pants over them is a challenge because the elastic waist is not “elastic”. I felt like I was going to rip the pants trying to get them on"
2.0,"It was smaller and shorter than shown and of poor quality. I wouldn't recommend. The ""gathers"" were higher on the body of the top than shown, also."
2.0,These run smaller than any other jeans I have purchased.  I wear a 31/32 depending on the jeans in Levi’s and bought a 32 in these and they don’t come anywhere near fitting.  Hopefully they can fix their sizing to be correct.  These could have been amazing if they were the size they said they were.
2.0,I ordered a small and it fit like it was an L/XL. It fits bigger than what you expect.
2.0,I wanted to love these. Great color for a blonde or brunette to wear. Very fun style.<br /><br />The frames were scratched already in several places upon receiving the item and feel uncomfortable to wear due to the surface scratches. See mid point of frame in the photo. I'll be returning these.
2.0,Not for me. Didn’t fit
2.0,"Colors pictured in description are INCORRECT, and is not what I received.  I ordered the shirt with the black on top, the gray middle, and the brown (“camel brown,” or “saddle brown,” or “light brown” are some other description names for the type of brown that was shown in the pictures of the item on Amazon) on the bottom and for the pocket.  The brown in the shirt that I received was in fact an orange, or “burnt orange” color.  Nowhere anywhere near brown (which is what I was wanting and was what I was needing).  Otherwise, the T-shirt seems to be of okay quality for what it is.  And the fit is okay also (Although I did order a size up from what I would normally wear/order, as another reviewer suggested.).  Just beware that the colors depicted in the item’s pictures on Amazon may not be the colors that you actually receive."
2.0,One of the gaiters was far smaller and tighter than the others. Frustrating.
2.0,Nice size. A little too cloudy for me.
2.0,The style is very cute and so is the print however it was so awkward fitting and rode up my crotch.
2.0,I liked these joggers only problem I dnt like is the band in waist is very tight on your waist area to put in off is hassle otherwise fits well for medium size length wise and not baggy at all. Just the rubber band needed to be more stretchy.
2.0,"These are super cheap looking! The metal is dull and looks like it's already turning, so it may not be stainless steel. They look smaller than a size 10mm. I'm probably going to return them."
2.0,Not very durable pieces fell off after a day
2.0,"I got a wallet just like this one but in black with a teal zebra striped flap.  Absolutely loved it, it's functionality, size and thought it was going to be great for going out with.  Unfortunately within 2 weeks of having this wallet, without any hard use, the fake leathery material ripped out right beside the snap on the flap.  Without being able to use the snap, since I don't want my phone or anything falling out, I've had to go back to using my old wallet."
2.0,"Came in a large box with a smaller jewelry box inside. Jewelry box was open and lid securely tucked on back of box, necklace was banging around in box, chain broken, one wing hard to open. Looks cute. Hope it works after the beating it took in shipping."
2.0,Adorable style but Not true to size.  These feel short & narrow.  Will return.
2.0,Runs small and cheaply made. Bottom hem of both shirts came out after 1 wear.
2.0,Only fit kids hands.  Got these so my husband could wear it when playing with our dog (like they do on Americas Funniest Home Videos).  These were to small for an adult hand.
2.0,"it was ok.  top is more &#34;skirt like&#34; at bottom and the shorts were really thick material.  returned it. great support and adjustable straps, just didn't love it as a whole."
2.0,"The best thing going for the shoe is the low cost. They certainly wil function for wrestling shoes but they are cheap and will start to fall apart in one season.  The velcrow lace tuck is junk and the stitching is falling apart, but I have used them for 2 seasons coaching. Time to pick up some asics, they have always been durable."
2.0,"I purchased helmet liners from two companies, these are two inches smaller. My first question was, are these for kids? Too small. Not comfortable"
2.0,"i couldn't use it, because become dark. I throw away as trust"
2.0,"As others have written, since the metal band can't be shortened, it's ridiculous for those of us with small wrists.  Worse, the extra length gets in the way of the stupidly complicated and insecure clasp.  Looks nice, but too much trouble to put on.  Forget about fast on-off like if you have to dunk your hands into water."
2.0,"Terrible quality- looks cheap, and actually, it doesn't even come cheap! Bad purchase."
2.0,So thick i couldnt breathe!!!
2.0,Pretty tooling but feels very cheap and plastic like.
2.0,I can't get over the color descrepency. The product itself seems fine but I'm returning so I didn't take it out of the packaging. The color is a dusty rose with a super bright pink strap. It just looks so off to me. Not at all what I was expecting. To me the colors by themselves are fine. It together they don't look good. I am debating on whether I will try a different color bag or not. I wanted to love this :/
2.0,The color is great but when I washed it following the instructions it shrank<br />I'm but now I have to get leggings too
2.0,Didn’t realize it was juniors and that’s why it was too small  but I wear other juniors tops xl and it fits.
2.0,To small and doesn’t look like the picture. Really short and made of t-shirt material. It’s not a sweatshirt.
2.0,"The purple color does NOT look like the picture. It is NOT a dark eggplant color, it's a brighter cheap looking purple. I sent it back. The quality and fit were good though."
2.0,"While the materials are good the execution and finish of the dupatta was attrocious.<br />The hem was uneven and the edges were unfinished.<br />There were gaps in the application of the crochet trim.<br />Since I do know how to sew and the materials are good I will not be returning it.<br />Instead, I am taking it apart and finishing it correctly.<br />I'm extremely dissatisfied with what I received.  If I wanted to make my own I would have gone to the fabric store not bought a ready made."
2.0,"The leather belt when I received it seemed to be in good quality, and fit well. As time is past it is broken down where it hooks to the buckle."
2.0,"The middle gem was slightly off, and there were obvious signs of hot glue on it...."
2.0,"Cheap, it is very fragile and broke quickly"
2.0,"Certainly looked pretty in picture, but not same peach color, size runs very small and fabric is extremely thin."
2.0,"These are attractive, but they didn't fit me at all. I wear a size 6.5 shoe. The chains that are supposed to go around the toe were too long so the entire piece fell over the the side. Totally unwearable. What an embarrassment. I couldn't wear them for what I bought them for and when I tried to double loop it, the chain broke. Now it looks like it's too late to return them. If you have small feet, don't bother. Very unhappy."
2.0,"Same as other reviews - sent back because we didn't clue in that it had 'Legendary' printed in large letters on the back yolk. If you like having<br />'Legendary' printed on your shirt (maybe you are Bruce Springsteen or, I don't know, Marlon Brando), you'll probably like this shirt just fine."
2.0,Very cheap bras.
2.0,Not adjustable on the straps so I cannot make the cape catch the hair well. It falls into my sons lap.  Can’t use it on thick necks.  Cheap plastic.  Thin and easily rips.
2.0,"The color of the lens is nice, but they are not the best for blocking out the sun. I work outside, so I need something that provides protection and I still sometimes find myself squinting sometimes using these. The lens is thick, but it is also see through from the front which is just personally not a design I like in sunglasses. They also are not great quality structurally. Granted, I have had these in bags and carried in my pockets many times, but the lens is already super scratched after only 2 months. One of the nose pads also has broken off, making these borderline unwearable. They do the job in a pinch if you have nothing else but honestly dollar store sunglasses would probably just as good quality for a cheaper price."
2.0,It was tiny!! Not much bigger than a quarter. Expected a little more. But you get what you pay for.
2.0,I ordered an XL. It is very wide (which I can live with) but way too short. I am 5'10&#34;.
2.0,"Runs very small, didn't have time to order another before the event. Just make sure you size up!"
2.0,"These shoes are super cute and very comfortable, but unfortunately when they arrived the box was beaten to hell and the shoes themselves were damaged. They were the only pair left in my size, and I was only given the option of returning or keeping them as is rather than getting a partial refund to pay for repairs. Had they not been damaged, these shoes would have been great for work as the sole is very thick/supportive so they would be great for all day wear and the gold touches give it a more polished look than most moccasin style shoes. The shade of brown also would've looked nice with jeans, so easily could dress up a more casual outfit as well."
2.0,It's just long and not any wider and its permanently wrinkled from the package cause the fabric is too cheap to iron. It's basically a table cloth with a hood. I didn't even wear it.
2.0,"I could not get these goggles to stop leaking.  After close inspection, I discovered that the lens weren’t properly set in the frame.  I popped it back in place, however, it only temporarily fixed the problem.  I had to give up on them."
2.0,"Broke very quickly and easily, cute before that"
2.0,The color of the dress is nice but the material is a little thin and the dress is a bit too clingy. It's too much effort to return it because of international shipping so I'm just going to wear it around the house. Did arrive quickly though.
2.0,Very small and thin. I'm going to give to a smaller friend.
2.0,"It appeared as though there were multiple inserts on the inside of the purse.  When I got it, I noticed the inside was one large section with a few small side sections.  I hate those types of purses and therefore will never use this.  It will simply sit in my closet until I no longer am mad at myself for buying it, then I will donate it.  Very sad because the outside is super cute."
2.0,Purse is super cute but I got it and it was sticky stuff all over it. Emailed customer service nothing happened. So ok just clean it. It's fine a week later my strap breaks grrrr. Never would buy it again
2.0,"The fabric is very clingy and not loose.  I wear a large in just about every top, but this large fit like a medium.  I  like the cap sleeves, but I will be returning."
2.0,I sent it back.  The size adjustment was via Velcro sand gave way to slight pressure!
2.0,Unfortunately I didn't like this.... I was really hoping it would be super pretty in person and little more weight to it....
2.0,"Cute, but a little too flimsy."
2.0,To small sent it back.
2.0,"They are very cute, however, the material is far more thin and slippery than I had expected, they do not stay up very well. I wore them for an 11 hour bartending shift this evening and found myself needing to pull them up way more often than frequently. Due to the constant tugging both of the side pockets have ripped. Some may call this user error, but honestly they are cheap and I got what I paid for. I hate leaving bad reviews, but i don't want anyone else to put money towards something that just doesn't work. Maybe if you sit most of the day you can get some use out of them, but for someone on the go, they are far from worth it unfortunately."
2.0,"Beware, it runs VERY small. We purchased a 5 figuring we'd be safe to have it for her to grow in to. She is in a 3t right now and it fit her perfectly! It is adorable and she loved it, however our swim class is only a half hour and within that time the black print to make the fins was all peeling off and falling into the pool. So cute if you are having your daughter lay out in it, haha, or just wearing it for pictures, but not practical unless you first peel off all the black fins."
2.0,"the compression is noticeably too much at the calf while being too loose at the ankle. If you really need a &#34;compression sock&#34;, don't buy these.  Buy the real deal.  Mediven, Jobst, and Juzo for example are all medical quality compression socks. These are not.  The compression is not correct. I am a lymphedema certified therapist and I ordered these to see if they might be a good quality sock that I could recommend to my patients who are looking for something less expensive.... but these are not a good product for anyone who has actual problems with lower extremity edema."
2.0,"Bought this with hopes I would be able to use during the winter when it dips below  zero but this does not keep my head warm in the slightest bit.  It does look better than most and would be great for any cold temps above zero, but nothing below.  You can feel the cold peek through the top/crown and mid sections of the hat.  The part offering protection below zero is the side flaps for ears."
2.0,"To big,not good details"
2.0,"These look super fake.  Sure they're cheap, but I expected better quality like I got from the clear ones from the same brand.  I still wear them and it's nice to have fun color options, but for the most part I think the quality is pretty poor.  I'm keeping them, but I don't plan to reorder if I ever lose any."
2.0,"Very sheer material, not squat proof"
2.0,"Like the color but not really a fan of it. Feel kinda ""heavy"" than the regular dishes gloves"
2.0,"Didn't look as good as the picture, but I should have been skeptical when no one wears in the photos.<br />It was very loose fit and looked kind of like a pajama shirt.<br />One plus was that the shirt is very soft (comfortable)."
2.0,"While this was pretty cute, it was super super small and very short - it barely covered my butt. I am 5'8&#34; and I normally wear a size 14-16 in dresses and I could not pull the zipper up all the way on this dress. I really wanted to like it and honestly would have loved it had it been a few inches longer and the dress a little bigger."
2.0,colors do NOT match what you see on the screen. very disappointed.
2.0,Dislike - Hanging Strings on the collar in several different areas. The chain hooks were not closed up. The stitching was not evenly done.<br /><br />Like - Price and the Delivery was fast.
2.0,Cute but short and wide
2.0,"The color and pattern of the dress is cute however it didn’t fit like the model. The elastic waist is fairly tight causing the top to kind of bunch up rather than a more sheath fit. I also did not like how the sleeves sat, they felt too short/stiff. I’m 5’5”, 125lbs, B cup and ordered a small."
2.0,"I bought these masks because I was tired of wearing and buying the surgical blue disposable masks. I also wanted something that would be breathable and match my clothes with a neutral color. I found that although these masks provided great coverage, they weren't breathable enough in a hot state like Florida. I eventually found myself choosing the blue disposable masks over these only because I was getting overheated. Perhaps these masks work fine for folks in cooler weather. They are comfortable and with plenty of coverage that doesn't ride up into your eyeballs; go for it if you live up north."
2.0,"Missing pieces. Mostly missing hearts, like it only has one set.  Missing a few swirls. Disappointed, but for the price I'll live."
2.0,Not very sturdy broke after first use
2.0,Omg there way too small the front of the bonnet hurts my head... I had too give it too my mom .!! And get others
2.0,I did not like the fabric. I ordered a size up and still did not fit.
2.0,the small was very big under the arms
2.0,"The item is not as pictured. It is shorter than expected (mid shin on a 5.6&#34; person). The material is cheap looking. The top is flattering, but overall not worth purchasing."
2.0,Very thin and cheaply made. Makes your feet sweat alot more than 100% cotton
2.0,Too Small. Not true to size.
2.0,Ordered it and was super excited.  Would have kept it but was way too tight around the thighs (very bottom with seams).  I'm a size 10 and 5'11&#34; so I'm still shopping.  Otherwise great coverage.  Wish I didn't have to return it
2.0,"Not stretchy.  Too big for 36"" table"
2.0,Waaaaayyyy  too small. Returned them.
2.0,Cute but is better sized for a toddler. The color is a little off.
2.0,"Night light too faint. Sets fairly easy, but the display does not show the year or month although when setting the watch you do set the month and year, but then these disappear and only the day of the week and its number show up in the display. Won't buy this one again."
2.0,I was so excited to get this shirt.  After reading the reviews it seems to be a mixed signal whether this shirt is too small a little small or just right. Let me put the debate to rest. I ordered a 2xl I am a firm 2xl.  The shirt is maybe a size large. I could possibly fit half my upper body in this tiny thing.  Severely disappointed and don't want anyone else to be.  Cute but bigger girls DO NOT ORDER.  Smaller girls size up 2 sizes maybe 3.
2.0,"Mask that arrived was not as pictured, the grin and print are very small in relation to the mask. The print is almost illegible from a distance. The material isn't breathable either, glasses beware."
2.0,I thought the belt was apart of the suit but it wasn't.  don't like the material the pants was made from. It felt like a beach pants.
2.0,"Pretty, but runs too small. Had to return every sweater in this brand I tried. 5 '7"", 36D, 140 lbs."
2.0,Ordered size 3-4 fits more like a 6-7. Washed it 2x and already shows was wear.
2.0,"The bra is NOT ""built in."" This item is two pieces: a jog bra and a tank. Do not buy if you want a cami with a legitimate built in shelf bra."
2.0,"This top is not the colors in description of item!! Shows a black, red & white top! It’s not it’s dark blue!! Not at all what the picture shows it to be!! Disappointed!!"
2.0,"Didn't last a month before the seam in the inner thighs busted. Did not fit like joggers, fit like tight leggings. Things will fall out of the pockets."
2.0,They are very soft but ripped at the Band the first time putting them on.
2.0,"Like it a lot, however, the done from my earring fell out. not pleased about that!!"
2.0,Doesn't really hold you in made cheaply.
2.0,I really like this being versatile and easy in/off wrist. The decorative beads came off after 2 months. I can still use it but idk if trust the clip from the wristlet.
2.0,No directions how to use it..
2.0,"This piece of garbage lasted two weeks before the metal piece snapped in two.  The rubber is more durable and feels more comfortable to wear than other shirt stays of this type, but it doesn't matter if you have no way to hold it in place.  Consider other shirt stays unless you want something that breaks within a short amount of time."
2.0,I was expecting a gift box like other customers received instead it came in a cheaply made plastic package with no tags scratchy on the inside will be returning as this was supposed to be a gift
2.0,"Unfortunately, after less than one-year's worth of weekday wear, the inner leather liner of this belt had begun to separate from its outer liner. I would expect performance such as this from a bargain $10 belt you might by at Walmart, but for a belt that cost about $35, its construction should have been more sturdy. I can't recommend this item for purchase."
2.0,38-31-40 measurement.  5ft 5in.<br />Paper thin material. Arms WAY WAY too short.  IT  is waterproof though.
2.0,Only got to wear the product once. The latching mechanism broke the second time I tried to put it on. Comes in a nice case and looks great; the build quality though not so great.
2.0,Wrong size delivered - huge
2.0,Beautiful bracelet but extremely weak. I’ve only worn it for half a day and the bracelet is already falling apart. Not worth the money
2.0,"Very very disappointed, the real pendant looks nothing like the picture. It is mostly white with a couple of yellow and blue spots."
2.0,Stones are extremely small and it didn't fit properly. I ordered a size 8 for my middle finger and it just barely fit. I ended up returning the ring.
2.0,I bought xl. Large would have been better for me.
2.0,Car decals on pjs are sticky...<br />Laundered & still sticky...<br />Would not let my grandson wear..
2.0,"Had to return it. The design is great but it's not shaped well. I'm only 5'5"" and I couldn't get the chest area anywhere near my actual chest"
2.0,"they're cute, but they don't come with backs. i mean, what post earrings don't come with backs???????"
2.0,Like the fact that its pack able but the wrinkles don't fall out. It lost it shape! I would like it better if it retained it shape.
2.0,"The earrings are poorly designed. The do not fit well, they do not stay in place, and their general structural integrity is poor. I am not pleased with this purchase and do not recommend this product."
2.0,"Shoes are exactly as pictured, however they are not for anyone with wide feet! I don't have fred flinstone feet or anything, but they're also not super narrow, which these shoes are. Very cute, decent quality for the price but once again-- wide feet beware."
2.0,Cheap material. Requires steaming to dewrinkle. Belt becomes shriveled up after washing.
2.0,Belt wasn't included. Trying to return. And sleeves were really short!!
2.0,"First thing, the material of the fabric is NOT soft. This is borderline rough cotton feel, not soft and stretchy like the photo makes it seem. Secondly, this is MUCH lighter than the photo - NOT dark chocolate, this is just a milk chocolate color. And Third, I AM a fit, sexy curvy girl and this bunches weird on the side. SUCH a waste of money, it's so much uglier than I had hoped! :(<br /><br />To put it plainly, the item I received is so much uglier than the photos I feel like they are doing some false advertisement with what they are saying the product looks like."
2.0,"It's been several months since I owned this and it still smells like rubber tire.  It is a huge bag for what it's worth.  Check the dimension.  I haven't tried washing it yet, maybe that might get rid of the smell.  One shouldn't have to wash a duffel bag to get rid of the stench.  Quality-wise it's not a Samsonite.  More like something you'd find at Walmart.  Well I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,The brown looked more like the red in the picture. I returned the pants.
2.0,These are cute but the material is scratchy
2.0,Loved the style n look I normally wear an XL don't like clothes tight so order XXL which turned out to be too small I was upset because I wanted to wear it because my son was taking me to DINNER FOR MY 71st BIRTHDAY
2.0,Not the same product as pictured
2.0,Too small for an adult head.  Cannot adjust it
2.0,Fit my husband well until we washed it. Then it shrunk to the point where he can’t even wear it anymore it’s so tight :( So bummed! Definitely order a size up.
2.0,"Cheap material. Top was alright, pants were on the odd side as far as fit goes."
2.0,"I went up a size to accommodate my chest. I typically wear a large,  hot Adm xl. I couldn't even button it not to mention the arms were way too tight add well."
2.0,"WAY WAY SMALLER THAN THE PICTURE THEY SHOWED WITH THE LITTLE GIRL HOLDING IT, ITS MORE OF A COIN PURSE IF ANYTHING"
2.0,"Broke almost immediately. Will not keep a charge, or switch on. Hat is good quality, but the Velcro holding the speaker to the hat detached within a week as well. Very disappointed."
2.0,Runs big. The material was a lot thinner than I thought. Sent it back. It wasn’t what I imagined it would be.
2.0,"These fit just right, but they are NOT non-slip socks.  Can't wear them; they bunch up in my shoe under my feet.  Would not recommend."
2.0,"If you want 100% microfiber socks, that's what these are. There is no wool in these socks. That being said, they are nice and soft."
2.0,This dress is too short. I’m only 5’4 and it hit way above my ankles.
2.0,"A button came off the first time I tried to wear it. Not because I bought a size too small, literally just popped off when I tried to put it through the loop. Not very well made and VERY booby."
2.0,Super comfy but it’s a Velcro strap and not very strong
2.0,Tight band around the legs.
2.0,"This dress was very thin, BUT cute.  IT was too small for me. I ordered an XL and I could not zip it up.  I am naturally larger on top but would say this is more like a L than an XL. 38D and size XL top normally.  5'7 and this was also a bit short.  I'd say XL = size 12 max"
2.0,"Clasp fell apart first time wearing it, had to have a jeweler fix it."
2.0,I was disappointed to find it was too small to fit comfortably.  The quality was nice though.  Should have returned it.
2.0,"The product didn’t deliver, one of the straps broke, I had to sew it back on and my clothes are still getting wet"
2.0,they are worth $9.99 and not a penny more
2.0,They were great in the beginning thick and cozy but after about the 3rd time wearing them they kept riding down and id have to pull they up over and over.<br />Plus after the 2 wash the fabric started to fade alot.<br />(I threw them away when they kept falling down) nobody wants to see ass crack.
2.0,not great quality-I purchased the white and it's completely see-through.<br />I normally wear a size large and ordered a 4X and it fit but was very small in terms of length.
2.0,"I bought this to wear in the summer, but its too thin and requires a slip for coverage.  Where is doesnt cling it hangs...I can't justify to wear this outside,it's too embarasing.  I'm 5'1,137. As a night gown its great and that's what I'm using it for."
2.0,These are not for daily use! But great for costume!
2.0,"My daughter and I were disappointed because these were advertised as soccer socks but when they came, they were regular socks and not thick at all.  She chose not to wear them for her soccer camp. :("
2.0,"The gem stone is not as vibrant pink as the photos. It’s a decent quality silver, but the ring after a few wears already looks cloudy and of poor value."
2.0,It was beautiful but it was very small in the chest so I had to return it. Also the pockets weren’t sewn shut.
2.0,I loved the Earrings. They are dainty and sparkly. But they don’t close securely and I already lost an earring one week after I got them.
2.0,I looked around a lot and read a lot of reviews and thought this a good choice. But when it showed up it was flimsy and the brim was wavy. Not at all what I expected. Back to Stetson.
2.0,"Item is wayyyy too small. Ordered a medium for my nephew and looked like a kid's size. Going to try an XL because my nephew REALLY liked it.<br />Also didn't realize that could not be returned to Kohls.<br />The company gave me the option of not repackaging it and sending back to China. They would let me keep the too small one and refund me 30% of the price. Since I am in Phoenix, and my nephew is in Seattle, I took that option. Frustrating.  Now going to order the new size and see if that works."
2.0,Came smaller than in picture.
2.0,Tight in the arms......not stretchy at all.
2.0,Pretty charm but gold plating is mostly gone after only two months. Disappointing as I can no longer return this bead as I have had it over 30 days.<br />Wish I could and I would exchange for a silver or enamel charm
2.0,"I really loved it at first but I'm one of those people who wears the same necklace everyday but the necklace and the locket both lost their color after about 2 weeks of wearing for me, which made me really sad."
2.0,Shrunk after one wash and threads started coming off after wearing one time. One of them came with loose threads. Better off with Carter’s brand.
2.0,"Bought a pair of these for my infant daughter as I am a big fan of Sperry. Within two months they were coming apart. I do recommend, contacted the seller any they acted as if they could care less."
2.0,"Within a week of having this the keychain broke off of the crystal. The crystal is still intact and now just sits on my shelf, but I was wanting the keychain to keep it with me."
2.0,I ordered medium thinking it would be closer for 10/12 sz but it’s quite large and longer than expected.
2.0,"It's pretty uncomfortable. I wore it to work and had to take it off after about 10 minutes because it was stabbing my ribs. I didn't have any issues with it standing, but sitting with it on was miserable."
2.0,I love the color but the dress WAS supposed to be 1X and fits like a 4X needs to be taken in and adjusted to fit
2.0,Couldn't close them.was wear earring backs so I could wear them
2.0,"I can usually get by, adjust to low-cut tops/dresses, but this material was sooooo thin that there was no way I could alter it.  Even with a full slip under it, it was just too much.  The slit in the leg was also too high.  It would have been better if the wrap of the skirt when just a little further around the body on both sides.  Because there was very little overlap, the slit was open too much and all the time.  The length was nice/swept right at my feet (I'm 5'4""-5'5"")."
2.0,Too thin of material
2.0,The charm itself is very cute and can be put on a necklace or another bracelet. The material the bracelet is made of however is incredibly cheap and poorly made. Mine broke an hour after receiving it.
2.0,It was very short and I’m only 5’1”. And it was loose in front but tight across the back.
2.0,I really didn't like the fabric or the way it fit.
2.0,The material is very see through.
2.0,Too small to wear comfortably
2.0,I’m 5’ 1’ and 150. A large was way too small. The fabric is also very see through.
2.0,the locket had parts missing had to send it back!
2.0,"The vintage rose color is darker than the picture and the band is a large, which im needing a small...I'm a bit disappointed"
2.0,son lindas pero no para hacer ejercicio se transparenta mucho super delgadas y mal costura en los bolsillos se rompe fácil
2.0,"First let me say that the functionality of this vest is top notch. This vest is perfectly designed for a day of fishing. Unfortunately, the quality of the product doesn't match it's function. I had gotten one last year from the same company and the zipper broke within a day. It was a cheaper one, but I decided to try this vest. After getting use to the zipper being on the ""wrong"" side, one the third outing the zipper started sticking and finally gave out on the 5th outing. I have the zipper stuck on it now about in the middle. I love the design, so I just keep putting it on like a t-shirt for now. Also lots of fraying around some of the other zippers, but so fat they are at least still functioning. Hopefully I can get someone to replace the main zipper."
2.0,"Too much material around the Center of your head. Not sewn together well, looks horrible also the braid is much smaller than the photo"
2.0,I thought I was ordering a tunic length shirt...........but it is too short and a bit too tight. Very Disappointed.
2.0,"We had a similar swimsuit from this company last year and loved every single thing about it. However, this one doesn't have snaps at the neck and the opening is too tight to wrestle over our toddler's head. We're looking into having it tailored since it is too late to send it back, but if we can't have snaps added then it is perfectly useless. Going swimming is supposed to be fun, but this suit is 100% traumatic in its current state."
2.0,"I was hoping that my glasses would stop fogging up, but they didn't.  I like the feel of it, but I broke out with acne where it touched my face."
2.0,it was not good at all it only came with one jumbo and the rest where a mini.
2.0,Arch support is too far back and not high enough.
2.0,"This garment was so sheer, I ended using as a beach cover"
2.0,This item did not fit well at all.If I could still return it I would.<br /> The bottom part was fine with good support but the top was very small. I purchased the right size as I was fitted by a professional a few weeks before I ordered this.... and I am normal busted not real large.
2.0,"I have had this watch for a while, and got it to wear for the occasional night out. Thing is the band is absolute crap. The watch is beautiful and keeps time pretty well. (Have to reset it sometimes) But for what you pay for the watch you should get a better band or charge less and ditch the band all together, because I have worn the watch a handful of times, and the strap has broken..."
2.0,Its flowy and made me look boxy. tied area made it look worse
2.0,"Good belt while it last, unfortunately it broke within a few months."
2.0,"My wife bought this purse but we returned it. The magnetic clasp that holds the top closed is very small and it leaves big gaps on either side of it. My wife felt that it would be very easy for things like a cell phone to fall through one of those gaps if she put her purse down on it's side or if it fell over. She liked the fabric and design on the purse, but didn't think it would be worth taking the chance on losing things."
2.0,Colors were not as vibrant as the picture. It was really hard to see the separation in colors. The sweatshirt was basically light blue with little to no grey. There was only the darker blue on one sleeve cuff. It was similar to a faded color effect and not tie dye but still tie dyed. My son liked it so I gave it at least two stars. Appeared to run slightly small.l but my son is thin and tall so it worked.
2.0,"Runs small. I ordered 22, I usually wear a sz 18 in most clothing & 42DD. I tend to wear sz 20 in swim. The 22 was painful because the top pinched my breasts because the elastic used is way too thin. The Halter strap is not adjustable or possible to reconfigure. I usually sew halters down to regular straps but it isn't possible with this design. Top is not lined. I didnt try on the bottoms. Will be returning, these tops are too uncomfortble to wear."
2.0,"I had really high hopes for this dress.  However, the photo is misleading as to the true qualities of the garment.  For starters, it is very high waisted.  I am short waisted, and even so, the waistline seam of this dress hit just below my bottom rib, a good 2"" above my natural waist.  In addition, the dress hem is deliberately uneven -- higher on the sides and longer front and back by several inches.  And then the plaid on the dress I got was extremely poorly matched across the bust and was eyecatching in the worst possible way.  I will say the fabric was a nice soft knit with good hand, and the dress measurements matched up to the mfr's size chart with no issues."
2.0,"im 5&#34;2, 115 lbs and i couldnt even get the size mediums to zip up!  super cute shorts though, im nervous to even buy the large though because they still seem like theyd be too small:/"
2.0,Really cute but awful quality. The chain broke within a few days.
2.0,Cheap fabric and fits smaller than usual.
2.0,Once removed from the package some fringe fell off ☹️
2.0,"Pretty crappy, but maybe fine for the price. They're not dark enough to read in the sun."
2.0,Looks nice but it didn't last long. The slides crack after 2 drops.
2.0,"they are all too small, but very pretty"
2.0,Pretty dress but unless you're smaller chested and less than a size 10 don't bother. I'm size 14 with DD's so I got an XL...could barely get it over my shoulders but no way was it going past my chest!
2.0,Not very warm. Not worth the price.
2.0,Not the band pictured but essentially very similar. BAND EDGES SNAG ON EVERYTHING!! Ruined two of my favorite tops already. Would not recommend. Would not buy again. Such a shame because it looks great.
2.0,"It broke when my cat pushed it off the dresser, I’ve never had a face crack that fast. The “leather” strap is not leather. Overall a cheap product. I’m sure it’s okay if you don’t bump it :)"
2.0,"Color looks a little different in person, not as bright. Cute dress however it was WAY TOO SHORT."
2.0,They are just too small and tight. I would not recommend for your baby. I used them as burping cloths. They are pretty absorbing and soft. I love the colors but won’t put them on my baby (chocking hazard).
2.0,The six colors are beautiful.  I purchased these in hopes I could mix them and wear multiple sets at once.<br /><br />These are smaller than they appear here. The gauge seems true. The earrings themselves are short and arrived screwed so tight that they required tools to take apart.<br /><br />Screwing them back together when they are in is difficult due to their short length and the size of the earrings. I had to remove all the earrings on my earlobe to successfully set one. Due to the work I do sometimes my earrings have to come out do to safety concerns. These were just a bit of a chore to get in and out.<br /><br />I'll find a kid to put them on so they don't go to waste.
2.0,Color changed within the 1st week. Was very disappointed.
2.0,Still fall off
2.0,"The pins for the bands came in a separate bag,<br />They are hard to put in and there isn't enough for each band. So you have to change the pin to change the band"
2.0,"Each pair fits differently, some sitting higher than others, or being tighter through the thighs.  They are supposed to be the same but they are not.  Also, the seams around the legs are already coming apart and I have only worn a few times.  Not overly impressed, especially for the cost.  Seems like something I would have gotten from Wish instead.."
2.0,"If you  like sleeves that are much too long, this is for you.....BIG THING, off the shoulder look is definitely not as pictured! Neck is allowable  to get over your head, that's about it, so if your looking for a cute off the shoulder look this is NOT IT! And the color is more cream, tannish, can't really describe, def NOT WINTER WHITE*****AS PICTURED!"
2.0,"The bra pads are bizarrely small, not attached, and float awkwardly around the cups. The fabric print doesn't match well at the seams. Returning."
2.0,"My wife was so disappointed in the fit.  She usually take a medium, but this blouse runs large.  The arms and under the arms are especaily too big. Based on the fabric and drying instructions, she hung it to dry. She wonders what would happen if it were placed in the dryer, if it would shrink any?  Will update this review if she ties it or she may just give it away. She does like the length, feel of the fabric and color."
2.0,"Coat was very cute, but it was way too small. I usually wear a L so I ordered an XL and it was way too tight. Too bad it doesn't come an bigger."
2.0,"Very pretty costume turquoise necklace, unfortunately, it broke after wearing for 2 hours.  Not fixable.  I would save my money or buy costume jewelry at the mall instead."
2.0,"I ordered two of these for an old fashioned day event.  They sent two of the exact same bonnets.  My teenage daughter isn't very thrilled about twinning with her Mom.  The one we received is not pictured.  They are very thin and are very small to be listed as a large.  In my opinion it is more of a child size unless you have a small adult head. I was going to return one and order another one from someone else, only to find out that you can not return it. So I guess we will be twinning."
2.0,"I bought an XL - I like how the waist line fits, cups are too padded and the lift, I could almost kiss my tata's."
2.0,"I was half way through only the second trip I ever took this on (only as a carry on, never checked it) and the zipper broke.  I would have tried to return it, but I was in Europe and had to get a bag to replace it so I couldn't bring it home."
2.0,This was a disappointment.  It doesn't even come close to fitting a 3 year old head.
2.0,"I'm  5'3&#34; tall,126lbs. I wear a 32D and size 2-4 jeans. The top is OK but the underwear were made for a  five-year-old.  The top will work just fine but overall I'm very disappointed with the quality of the product. Not just the sizing but also the material."
2.0,I wore this once.  It wrinkles.  I won't be buying from this company again.
2.0,🧐
2.0,I found these to be very uncomfortable and returned them.  The rubber column that sits between your big toe and the next toe has rough edges that dig into your skin.
2.0,"I got the rainbow and black set, they're super cute, very soft and comfy... they stretch out really fast though, and the little metal adjuster thing doesn't have any teeth or anything so the band loosens almost constantly. Going to have to look for a different one :("
2.0,"The quality was OK, but I purchased the small for my stepdaughter who is 5'7&#34; and is built like a giraffe.  The small would not have fit her when she was 8.  The inseam of the pants was around 27&#34;.  I had to return and purchase something from a store instead."
2.0,"At first i loved these yoga pants, super comfy and flexible but what i didnt realize was they are seethrough when i bend over.. not exactly what you want to find out after over a month of wearing these in public.. wont purchase these again."
2.0,It didn’t look anything like the picture. It was more grey than beige. I also found it to be poorly made. The ends were frayed
2.0,One of the clasp broke before I could even wear it. I don't have high hopes that the rest will last very long unfortunately.
2.0,Really cute but it's nor adjustable. Was a little small for my head
2.0,I just don't like the feel of something on my head all night.  It helps but not as good as some of the posts state (for me)
2.0,So cute but completely see through. Racked my brain thinking of ways I could keep it it was so cute. Wish it was thicker. Disappointed.
2.0,"These glasses are very small. They may look good on a child but not an adult. Also, they felt like they would easily break. They also did not come with the signature case as pictured. They came with an all black case."
2.0,No me gusto el material ni la  confección
2.0,So not what I was expecting. So flimsy and cheap. Save your money.
2.0,This pant was shorter and fabric was a different texture and weight than same pant purchased in department store. One washing and they are already starting to pill. I’m so bummed because other pair fit well and washed up well.
2.0,fit very awkwardly over my glasses and are uncomfortable
2.0,"We got this suit yesterday. Fast shipping and the costume is so cool. However, the seams are opening on the hands, zipper , fingers and some on the legs. I don’t know how I will get it off my son to return it."
2.0,I ordered the Studio Ghibli socks. I am very annoyed that I ordered these and they look nothing like the pictures. They are all discolored and look horrible. I wish they had correctly advertised what they actually look like. I still may have wanted to buy them. Its very disappointing to see such a great product come to you and look completely opposite than you expected.
2.0,it made me look like a huge bear my husband and daughter asked me never to wear it again . My friends thought i gained weight.  You must be on the skinny side then you may look great
2.0,The top part is extremely too large
2.0,"I purchased this necklace last year and was so pleased when I first got it.  I've worn the necklace every once and awhile over the past nine months and up until now, it's been a beautiful piece of jewelry that I've enjoyed wearing. However, just today I went to put it on, and noticed that it now has a tarnished color to it, where it's more ""brassy colored"" than silver.  It now looks like a cheap imitation of a silver necklace, and I'm very disappointed. I have a hard time believing that this is truly a ""sterling silver"" necklace as the description states.  Other items I've bought from Netaya have been okay, but you'll definitely want to think twice before you purchase this necklace, even if the price now shows a reduction of 75 percent off the original! (Hmmm, I wonder why that might be?)"
2.0,It is not great quality but acceptable for a costume maybe one time use. Cute though . I liked the length
2.0,Extremely cling polyester material and small arm holes.
2.0,"The ring isn’t as tall as they say it is. It may be dipped in silver, but it is definitely not silver at its core."
2.0,"I ordered this mask for Halloween...the eye holes are so small that it was very hard to see...I had to cut them bigger.  In addition, the mask goes all the way around and over the head, with no strap or support on the inside to keep it in place. If you have a small head, be prepared to bump into things. Would not recommend."
2.0,Isnt as long as the picture describes. Not for NE weather
2.0,The dress doesn't look like the picture. The chiffon flowers lay flat and are not anything like they look on the picture. I ordered this dress in a pinch for my daughter do it will have to do but it's very disappointing.
2.0,"The pattern of material is eye catching, but the fabric is thin. length is perfect. I'm 5'4 hits 4 inches above ankle. I do not like pleats, pick your own belt for this the one they have is flimsy."
2.0,I love the shoe however it is unwearable. I ordered my usual size however the big toe hits the front and makes it difficult to walk. Sizing up will be too big unfortunately. :-(
2.0,They fit wonderfully and are extremely comfortable.  These pill horribly and immediately compared to the same item with the same item number that I purchased from QVC.
2.0,I did not expect or want large earrings however these were so small the detail did not show. It was very difficult to even see a stone in them. Very disappointed.
2.0,Too small not big enough to use
2.0,Needs stitching and SHOULDER attention
2.0,I was disappointed with this item because the picture shows a beautiful white top and the item I received was quite old looking and discolored.  It was also very large.
2.0,"For man they are not that comfortable, at least for me, since the design has the line in the middle instead of two lines at both sides, the groin area has to be put to one side and cannot rest relaxed in the center."
2.0,The purple one barely glows. The other 2 are dim and fade fast. Gorgeous design though I'm disappointed it didn't glow more
2.0,small when tried on. photo makes them look much larger. They may fit a child.
2.0,"This was baggier than I expected. It's also not a very long shirt, so the bagginess really had a boxy effect. (I ordered the smallest size [&#34;small&#34;] & am 5' 3&#34;, size 32B bra. I think this top would look really cropped on a taller woman.) The cut of the neckline & angle of the thin straps was not as flattering/feminine as I had envisioned--it sort of had the effect of a guy in a sleeveless top trying to show off his muscles, actually. I think the straps angle kind of more horizontally when actually on, & less vertically, and somehow this has a sort of heavy-set effect... The fabric itself is beautiful & drapes nicely, though. Definitely returning & will not try again."
2.0,These do NOT completely cover my eyes.<br />They do NOT fit well over my glasses.<br />They work fine as blue light filters.
2.0,"When clicking on the item, it showed a top .. it was described as an unstiched top .. it was actually a half yard of material at the end of the Saree.. no.pattern, no instructions .. kinda disappointing .."
2.0,Queda un poco grande en la espalda pero aprieta mucha la liga de las pompas
2.0,Dresss was very cute but very cheaply made. Material is see thru
2.0,CONSTANT WRINKLES. Would not recommend.
2.0,The style of sweat pant is great nice slim leg fit but not too tight. Material is not so good already starting to pile.
2.0,Really cute shoe.  I’ve only worn these 3 times to church and the heel popped off. They did pop back together. I’ll wear them again since they’re very cute. Shipping was fast. I got my usual size 7. For was good.
2.0,My daughter loved the designs to fit of these tights. Unfortunately both pairs tore in the crotch after just a few months.
2.0,I thought the shirt would fit like my other regular T-shirts but it had more of a women’s fit then unisex fit. I was a little disappointed.
2.0,So difficult to get anything in or out. Wish I had returned this
2.0,Very cute but tore after a few wears
2.0,Returned Product as material was not to my liking.
2.0,"The cut is uneven. It feels good on top but it is cut too small at the waist, and doesn't fall flatteringly over the body. I wouldn't order from this company again."
2.0,It was nice other than the super floppy brim. Doesn't stick out to protect from sun unfortunately.
2.0,The sequence constant came off and went everywhere i walked and sat.
2.0,"I only got the blue ones pictured, which I'm glad they look pretty, otherwise I'd be irritated. The other pair were, like the previous review, a star and moon, I mean they're cute but not my style. I wanted the ones in the picture that's why I purchased. However, Amazon came through and very promptly refunded me. So thank you Amazon."
2.0,"The quality of the face covering part of the mask is great, but the elastic on the sides feels like a rubber band pulling and rubbing on the back of the ears. This is the same complaint for all 3 of us that tried these masks. They will be fine for short trips, but unwearable all day at work. As a nurse, I am used to wearing masks all day--the medical grade masks are more comfortable than these (and that isn't saying much). For the price, there are much better masks out there."
2.0,It isn’t that stretchy and it’s hard to adjust and make tighter by yourself
2.0,"Rough and scratchy, not at all as described in that way. It was cute, butI had to return due to how rough the material was."
2.0,"When I wear these glasses, it just turns yellow everywhere. Nothing else changes."
2.0,Very pretty but way too heavy for a keychain or on your purse … I can’t even think what I would use these for because of the weight they’re very heavy
2.0,"as the headline says....<br /><br />been using it for a couple of weeks:<br />Pros:<br />- cheap<br />- light<br />- molded toe rubber (that was a feature i was looking for - apart of course from steel toe and puncture resistance)<br />- build quality seems reasonable ...but hard to say at this point<br /><br />Cons:<br />- no support in sole...too flexible like an Converse allstar type sole - so painful after some time<br />- built too small for wide for foot<br />- no real ankle support<br /><br />so in short - you can use this if you are looking for an all around low-medium duty work boot with steel toe and PR....but it is NOT one of those super sturdy work boots that you usually buy (eg Carharrt, Timberland etc)"
2.0,"Awesome sun glasses for the money, triple Packaging...... somehow came with a scratch on the lens returning for another pair...."
2.0,The logos on the jacket peeled off after one day.
2.0,"Smelled strange and wouldn't go away. I had to chuck it after wearing it, it smelled so bad."
2.0,Not as pretty nor as detailed as cameos that I have purchased in the past.  Rather disappointing.
2.0,price okay - shipping ridiculous
2.0,"I really like the color and style. However, the links are impossible to remove even with the device provided (and I used to work in a jewelry store, so I know how to remove Watch band links). Sad to say I’m sending it back."
2.0,"Ridiculously small. And rather than support, it just smooshes your boobs down so flat they can't go anywhere. Very little, if any stretch, and certainly not a full support bra - unless you consider duct tape full support."
2.0,As soon as it is washed it shrinks to half size.  I flat dried it and still only got one use out of it.  Waste of money.
2.0,"They are cute but super long.  I cut off the bottom part and they were the correct length, but they developed holes the first time they went through the wash.  Waste of money"
2.0,"When i put it on the heart was not a heart at all, more of a weird circle, it made it look  like I ripped my bikini bottoms. I sent them back and they refunded me for them quickly without any issues."
2.0,"So these were great for a month and then just started falling apart. They are comfy but not good for a ""long-term"" investment. Lasted a month."
2.0,very thin material. rolls up. still wear them but i ordered a different brand a long with these and thought the other brand had better thicker material.
2.0,"My son only wear this one day to a wedding party, when we got home that night it had started coming apart it just spit in half!"
2.0,It isn't the material or color that I expected or desired.
2.0,This is my 4th piece in this dress but i was disgusted that it came with deodorant marks and was turned inside out.<br /><br />Gross
2.0,Fabric pattern and colors are vibrant as shown. Stitching and workmanship is poor quality if you look closely. The top finish stitching around the neckline stops in the front center of the neck. There are several spots where the stitching is knotted up instead of a clean straight continuous stitch.
2.0,It’s nice material but a strange fit. The waist is really tight
2.0,"Disappointed. The blue color came and is a weird light blue, not like pictured. The red pair broke the first day I wore them."
2.0,These are more like tights not leggings. Ripped the first time I tried them on.
2.0,I got this for my hubby he loved the design but unfortunately was a little small but he still likes and wears it next time finding something a bit bigger
2.0,Pay attention to size
2.0,"The dress is longer than pictured and didn't have any structure to it. It was like wearing a bag, even with the belt on."
2.0,"While the fit and finish was good, it was far from waterproof.  It fit my 70L pack very well.  But wearing this for three hours in moderate rain, the pack was totally saturated top to bottom and about 3 ounces of water had accumulated in the bottom of the cover.  Dust cover yes, Rain cover, no."
2.0,Thin - More like tights - See Thru !!!
2.0,Chain is no good..very disappointed in chain..broke it 1day of wearing...I have just lost my emotional support  dog and wanted to hold my baby close to my heart...the heart is in ok shape...hoping they may send me another one...
2.0,*EDIT* It got worse. It collects every piece of fuzz and hair in a five mile radius.<br /><br />This would be better if the ears actually stood up as shown. They are floppy and lay flat against the hood.
2.0,giant and chunky like a man's ring
2.0,Well the skull was kinda melted together its peeling already and it's just a mess.. I feel like I really waisted my money
2.0,Does not have a bone structure and will slip right out
2.0,Small metal ball of death paint comes off easy as fuc too
2.0,This product is described as a sherpa hoodie..it is light flannel...not thick at all  not as described
2.0,Arrived with the chain in knots!
2.0,Needs more stretch.
2.0,"I normally wear a size 20 so I ordered the 3x, but it fits like a 16. Way to tight!"
2.0,"The sewing was off (too tight in one area, and too loose in another).  Not like the photos"
2.0,Not even 6 months after buying it it snapped.
2.0,Very thin fabric - all in all a disappointment - Skip this item.  Viewable from the front is a very small section of white fabric which goes on your back which misled me to believe that the shirt was more substantial than what I received.  Not very warm.
2.0,Bust size was too small. I had to return. Offered little support.  Felt a little cheap.
2.0,I returned this - very thin and wrinkled
2.0,"I wasn't expecting a luxury pair of sunglasses when they're priced less than $20. But I was surprised by how cheap and flimsy these feel. It's like holding air when they're in your palm. Other reviewers seem to like that light weight quality, but it just makes them feel like a toy to me. The lenses are polarized, which is a nice feature. But on the whole I'd recommend spending a little more money and getting yourself a pair that's built to last. I doubt these glasses could survive a single fall."
2.0,Really bummed ordered this a size too big and it fits everywhere but the arms chest and shoulders.
2.0,Very lose around the waist but fits on the hips.. .  It's a weird fit.  Not for me. Looking for something more elastic /stretchy around the lower abdomen area.
2.0,"I'm small, and this one is too small for me -- very tight and uncomfortable."
2.0,one of the arms is bent and makes them uncomfortable to wear.  I attempted to bend it back to no avail.  My next attempt i will heat it first
2.0,not very warm and the touch screen part does not work well
2.0,Just don't dry this socks because they will shrink a lot.
2.0,Does not have opening for note9 memory card and sim card. You have to take out of case to change. Has room for a lot of cc and driver's license slot and change pocket but then magnets aren't strong enough to hold close.
2.0,"I had a necklace like this that was seriously awesome. Sadly, I accidentally snapped it when I was moving. I looked around to find one just like it and found this. It was a good price and I was excited. But it only lasted a week before the clasp broke. No worries, I said, I'll just buy a new clasp. Well the hook on the end came completely off. I almost lost my pendant because of this. I would not recommend this at all"
2.0,"I'm tall and this is not long enough at all, despite the reviews that it was a long shirt"
2.0,Cheap satin pillowcase material and the arms are too small so it fit weirdly. Returned immediately.
2.0,wasn't what I like
2.0,I wear XL shirts all the time and this one is really small. My wife wants to use it at the beach. She is 135 lbs. A xxl may fit me but I don't know if I even want to try it. The material is nice and comfortable feeling but it has to fit.
2.0,Was to smell
2.0,The peircing ring  dont attach to the needle like the ones ive gotten before so isnt easy to put it through but clamps work to hold belly a I gave it a 2
2.0,Could not zip past my waist. Not for full figured women.
2.0,Nice glasses however the seller did not include the glass case and would not do anything to rectify
2.0,Zippers separate and stick. Returning unfortunately.
2.0,"I was expecting this to be a more structured cap but it's not. It's also not sewn particularly well. There are places along seams where you can tell care wasn't taken to line things up or to make the seams lie flat especially where the top of the cap meets the bill. It's fine for a run function-wise but I wouldn't throw this on to run to the store. Just blah. Save our money and just buy a nicer Nike, or similar, hat."
2.0,"Too orange, almost red... You can feel the cardboard sides of the bag from the inside of the purse. Pebble leather is a low grade. Not worth the money."
2.0,Very Very Very Poor Quality. Feels more like plastic than a fabric. I would probably end up returning.
2.0,"They do run small which is why I wanted them. My hands are very petite. So the fit is great, but the lining is not warm enough. I wanted something super lined so I could walk my dog in the cold. One minute into the walk and my fingers were frozen. I live in the South where cold is 45 degrees, so I'm talking about really pathetic lining. But, they make nice driving gloves and look okay in terms of style."
2.0,"These are made well and cute for the price, but I received the wrong size. I have ordered other shoes from them before and they were great, but this pair I order a size 4 toddler and what I received is 3-6 month"
2.0,The shipping on this product was great. The product itself is not of a great quality. The plastic it is made of is flimsy and feels as if it might break. I have the original product and needed a second to carry more bags.
2.0,"is not for a large man, more for a tween or someone with smaller head. light fabric"
2.0,"Cute boots but defective. One boot has very deep, obvious scratch in front."
2.0,After one wash it was already faded
2.0,"The shape and style is not like on the picture. Material is stuff and scratchy and not free flowing. Ordered a small, my usual size and it was too short in length, but the armpits hung and it looked boxy. It was returned"
2.0,They are great at compression and they are flattering however just working out with them once they started to break apart in the bum area .
2.0,They have larger posts than most earrings.  Returning these
2.0,"Purchased for an adult male with a history of both neck and rotator cuff surgeries. The shirt fit well, the sizing chart aligned with actual measurement.  The material felt good and the extra support in the belly could be helpful in reminding one of correct abdominal position.<br />However the shoulders were too loose; need for greater restriction to be effective. Very surprised as most reviews are favorable; including from those with medical necessity. There were negative reviews from  those who didn’t like it because they thought it was too restrictive for them so this was very disappointing."
2.0,"The trunk was for our granddaughter's American Girl Doll. We had to make several repairs to the 'new' trunk before giving to her for her birthday. The paper on the inside of the trunk was not glued well at the edges and the drawers had pulled away from the left side, tearing the paper from the trunk. The price is much too high for a trunk made of cardboard. :-("
2.0,The detail was very good. However it’s entirely too tiny; even for “tiny jewellery”!
2.0,Way too small. I ordered an XL. Two stars because the return was simple.
2.0,"I’m 5’6 145 and reading the comments I thought to get M/L. It was waaaay to big and baggy. It was cute, but too big now I have to send back and resort to a different costume."
2.0,Not the color shown.
2.0,"Very cute, very comfortable. Nice fit. SEE THROUGH COMPLETELY SEE THROUGH!!!"
2.0,This is a super cute bathing suit. However it fits very small! I ordered a size up and it's uncomfortably tight. I will be returning.
2.0,Thought was jersey knit
2.0,"Love the design and the fabric color. Not thrilled about the spandex like texture. I assumed it would be cotton, but it was not. Very disappointed tbh considering the price point. Specially for the price point. I got a different stich themed shirt for halloween in white to tie dye orange and red. I didnt specifically check if it was cotton before buying, but it was 100% cotton.<br /><br />It was the same or cheaper price for a 100% cotton vs this shirt. Definately feel sort scammed by this product to be fair."
2.0,It was 1 week later then the delivery date which was already almost 2 months so I didn’t receive them from 2 months that I had ordered them and the black was faded so not what I had expected at all and definitely not worth the wait.
2.0,"Way too big ! It took up most of my top ear and it'll move sideways like a (U) and would get stuck in my hair . It was too much of a hassle to re-position it ,so I decided to take them off ."
2.0,This is tiny.  I normally wear a US size 10 and this was more like a top on me.  There's absolutely no way I could walk out the door wearing this without pants or shorts with it.  I returned it.
2.0,Great color but very large. I purchased a small and it fits like a large. Unwearable.
2.0,Very small...and thin.
2.0,Too small! I thought they would be a little bigger
2.0,"bought it for night driving , but it doesn't work , ok for evening"
2.0,Since they are used for people who need compression they should be finished inside and out. These look like a gang of threads on the inside and I will never buy them again.
2.0,"The head broke off almost immediately, which was rather upsetting because it looked amazing"
2.0,"doesn't infect or irritate my ears, BUT very flimsy. Once you open it, it's very difficult to get the hoop back to the original, round shape. I can still get away with the earring looking round on my ear, but when you take it off the hoop will be noticeably misshapen"
2.0,This was not what I expected. The stone is nice but the metal is thin and makes the ring look cheap. Looks similar to picture but metal is much thinner.
2.0,Its size is small
2.0,Too big and pilled like crazy almost immediately.
2.0,the card pockets are too big and my cards just slide all the way down so I can't actually use any of them.
2.0,Cute print. Bad material choice
2.0,"Pros:<br />  - fits great, good materials<br />  - looks great<br />  - easy to adjust<br />  - nice packaging<br /><br />Cons:<br />  - for some reason that I haven't figured out yet, it seems to randomly loosen - the catch just falls open.  I'm not pulling it too tight.  It's correctly sized.  I don't know what the issue is.<br /><br />I bought this when my Mission belt wore out (the leather didn't look good - clasp was fine).  But several times now, after only wearing it three or four times, the belt has suddenly loosened - which is just a bit of an inconvenience.  Otherwise, happy with it."
2.0,I liked the product but ran small and I went up a size
2.0,Runs small. My daughter had a 36 cm head and did not fit comfortably in this.
2.0,"I liked it, but the zippers failed and I had to quit using it. I tried to contact Belfen to use the warranty and never heard a word from them. I was well within the warranty time."
2.0,"Too small, sizes don't match with the &#34;size chart&#34;"
2.0,Doesn't look like the picture it's ok
2.0,"These pajamas will decieve you. They're buttery soft on the outside, scratchy and plasticy on the inside. They also run about a size too small. Disappointed."
2.0,Only a few months into school and has holes. Not durable.
2.0,It was really thick and bigger then I wanted.  Color was more robins egg blue then teal
2.0,I can't get the class to open very easily
2.0,"The leg openings are cut SO high, like high cut undies and this doesn't work for someone with a short torso. There was just all this extra material at the crotch, and yeah, super weird looking."
2.0,"This chain was a much darker gray than the photo shows and when worn for three hours, it knotted itself in such a way that it cannot be repaired.  Definitely wouldn't recommend."
2.0,Zipper end came off so not the easiest for my daughter to get on or off. They cost enough shouldn’t have happened.
2.0,Black necktie clip is what I was expecting BUT very small for an adult's  tie. This would work well for a little boy's tie..  It wouldn't work for me.
2.0,"I have had compression socks before, and I get the premise, but the fabric doesn't really compress other then the fact that they feel like they are a size too small, and look like it too. Waste of money. But I did get three tank tops that are a little tight."
2.0,It runs super small!  I wear a large and it was like a small.  Size way up!  The delivery was pretty fast.
2.0,Cheap made its should be $19 instead of $39
2.0,I’m visually impaired and also suffer from migraines. My O&M gave me a pair of tinted glasses for outdoor use which I love(the help me I’m so many ways) but are too dark for indoor use most days so I’ve been looking for a pair to use indoors. I ordered these because he recommended the brand however when they came they are way too big! Yes they fit over my glasses but they slide down on my nose. Even when I manage to push them up there is a huge gap up top around my eyebrows and below my eyes too. It defeats the whole purpose of blocking out the light. 😞 sadly I will be returning  these and either keep looking or maybe contact the actual company to see if I can buy a smaller/better fitting pair.
2.0,"The description says there are 2 neck Gaithersburg. However, I only received one."
2.0,"I love Henley shirts and I really like this style material. That said I have two problems which ruin this shirt for me. 95% of the time when I purchase a 2XL it fits perfectly. This was too tight before ever washing it. This struck me as odd because another review said they ran ""big."" The other problem was the cut of the sleeves. With the shirt on and arms to my sides the sleeve openings weren't perpendicular to the ground - they angled upwards sharply as they got further away from my body. It just looked goofy to me."
2.0,Very cropped and runs small
2.0,"I have to return because I ordered a large I'm 5'9 and about 160 lbs . The romper itself fit but the belt that came with it was for a super small girl. The seam where the belt is supposed to sit ,it wouldnt even hook on the first hole. I would keep but its awkward looking without the belt I feel like"
2.0,"It will work, but I was sent the wrong pattern. But they do the job."
2.0,This outfit is cute with nice bold colors but absolutely too big....I'm 5'3 152lbs and got a small and the outfit looks and fit like an XL
2.0,Ordered lg sent xl.
2.0,"Updating my review and added pictures. I've only had this band for 3 months. I wear my watch everyday. My original Apple Watch band was great but I wanted a standard band rather than the apple band, might have to go back to Apple I had that band for over a year.<br /><br />The band itself is nice but the finish is not. It came with a matte finish and has quickly worn down in some spots making it shiny, good band for work but not for anything else."
2.0,ordered a larger size than what I normally wear because of reviews and still had to send them back because they were to small.
2.0,"This thing is mostly garbage. The strap that holds it on broke within in 5 minutes of opening the package. My son had to tape it up. The voice changer....eh. It kind of changes the voice, but not what we were expecting. It still sounds pretty much the same, just echoing. I'd save your money."
2.0,Ok to wear over a swim suit but very long and poor quality.
2.0,"Beautiful, with that being said, just like other reviews before me the clasp, is horrible, it will not stay closed, wore it to work and just fell off while typing on my keyboard, fell off all day had to tape the clasp together to keep in on, really disappointed in that but the look and feel was awesome, would recommend that if you purchase this be prepared to work in the clasp👍🏻"
2.0,"It's more of an ivory.  A light ivory, but still not white. I needed a white dress for an event that requires a white dress so I had to return it.  If you order this, make sure you get a full slip as well, because you will need it as the material is not heavy and is slightly see thru.  On the good side, the dress was a nice design, and fit as expected.  It doesn't look expensive but it's good enough.  I am 5'3"" about 110.  Only gave 2 stars, because the description definitely says White.  Comparable dressmakers on Amazon state Off-white if it is.  Just ordered another dress, wish me luck!"
2.0,"The leather material the holder is made out of is pretty durable against creasing, but the snap/fastener is absolutely awful.<br /><br />The key holder is supposed to snap closed, securing your keys inside the holder. Unfortunately even without keys inside, the snap on my holder doesn't stay closed for more then 2 seconds. I'll try to DIY a better fastener since I love the bat design so much.<br /><br />2 stars for cute design and sturdy leather material"
2.0,"this is a very cute necklace, but has fallen off of the chain several times in the few months we have had it. we have tried to attach it and cinch the clasp closed, but it just doesn't stay that way. cheaply made, but looks pretty so i will wear it until i lose it."
2.0,Cute just too big in armholes  and over all
2.0,The three layers of fabric were so different. The bottom gray was comfortable but the red was think and scratchy.
2.0,"This item runs VERY SMALL . I ordered an XL and it fits my daughter, who is a small.  The fabric is VERY thin.  Sorry, I do not like leaving bad feedbacks, but this had to be told."
2.0,"I purchased to wear under a very tricky bridesmaid dress. Given that you only really get one shot with the adhesive, I couldn't do a dry run to make sure it worked. Mistake. Despite the lovely carrying case that everyone raves about, what this product does not come with is directions. I know what you're thinking: it's a bra, figure it out. Wrong. Fast forward to day of the wedding, and me with my mom and my gf trying to figure out how to get this thing on properly. Do you lift your chest up? Do you squeeze them together? Do you stick on the exact bottom of your chest and pull up? Also, good luck trying to get your nipples in those strategically placed adhesive gaps.  Fail. By the time we tried all options there was no adhesive left. For the record, I wear a size B, so it wasn't like I was working with a lot here and it was still impossible, and ultimately the bra offered no lift or support."
2.0,Material is cheap and it was not long enough. Had to be hunched over in order for it not to give you the worst camel toe in the  history of camel toes.
2.0,Decent case for a good price just wish the entire hat could be displayed not just the front.  In order for the hat to be put in the case you have to fold the back of the hat inward.  I have two Cubs world series hats for these cases and it kinds of sucks with the folding you can't see the patches on the sides of the hats.
2.0,"These are cute, and I'd love them except for the screw in the center that stabs my forehead. If<br /><br />I liked the price, the snugness of the arms, the size of the lenses, and the overall look, but that screw hurts too much to wear them for more than a couple minutes (and will leave a mark), so they're pretty useless."
2.0,"I am so disappointed in these. They looked nice online but when they arrived, the straps were all crinkled up. I decided to still wrap them up and give them to my 7 year old for her birthday and hope for the best. They were way too big and such a disappointment all around. I'm returning them."
2.0,"The pictures of these items look blousey and comfortable, however, I found that the sizes run small. When I tried the items on, they fit to the T. I even ordered a size way larger than I usually wear because I like these types of dresses to be roomier than normal."
2.0,"Too small and thin, I don’t like them!"
2.0,It isn’t your ordinary full size adult hat.
2.0,Nice shorts but were way too small
2.0,"Made in a foreign country and the sizes are way off..Wont be back, but it is cute"
2.0,The quality was less than expected.  My son has only worn it a few times and it already has a hole in it!
2.0,totally misleading photo. I will return. The 'cat' is nothing but a black half moon shape on gold background. I bought it because of the cat eyes being clearly visible.
2.0,"I purchased a size bigger than I wear, but it was still short in the sleeves and tight around my biceps."
2.0,"Well they're really pretty, but one of the balls fell off after a couple days."
2.0,"I bought these as under shirts and they fit great...BUT the side seams are really wide and thick and they are actually uncomfortable...the item is not too small so a larger size would not help...I found that wearing them inside out is best and thats ok for me since I am wearing them under other shirts, but would not purchase them again"
2.0,A yellow line appeared below the left eye after a week of receiving it. I’d say it it was only on for almost an hour total in that week. Too bad because I really liked it before that happened.
2.0,Lovely earrings but too heavy for ear-made ears fold over... amazon prime was late delivering so they arrive past the special event
2.0,I could get it on but couldn’t close the bottom and I have a small torso.
2.0,Nice while it was working. Pin attached to metal movable part broke off. The hole where the pin broke off appears to have some rust. Had the belt only one and a half month. Will go back to previous brand Trakline.
2.0,This broke shortly after wearing it...
2.0,The color was nice but it was not nearly as smooth of a design as the picture. The transition from body to skirt was unflattering. The waist was small and the bra pads were large and very hard. I was not impressed and had to return.
2.0,"Sometimes the wristband comes off on its own, posing a risk to be lost. They also get dirty quickly."
2.0,Wish I would’ve read the material before I purchased it. It is mostly polyester. I was thinking it would be a cotton T-shirt. I have got compliments but I do  not love the fabric
2.0,I love Zelda and I have a few mask of them but I had to return it because I could not breathe out of it because it was polyester. Worst mask ever. If you get it make sure you can breathe out of it.
2.0,Too small. I purchased one 3 years ago at a smaller size. This time ordered a size bigger and it was way smaller than the last one. Disappointed 😞.
2.0,Socks were too small in the calf even though I followed sizing options. Also the interior was covered with threads from the design which made them uncomfortable against the skin. Ended up returning the socks for poor fit and ordering a different brand with larger calf circumference. If you are athletic and have muscular calves these socks may not fit well.
2.0,"This is not cotton, it’s polyester. It is not soft, it’s somewhat scratchy."
2.0,silver washed off in a week
2.0,"I bought the shoes for my son. After several days, the velcro is broken, so he can't make it tight anymore."
2.0,Beautiful but waaayyy too big. Sizing chart was off.
2.0,The balls are huge it ended up making the bottom of my tongue sore from rubbing... which I'm really disappointed about because I like the designs a lot
2.0,"I suppose it functions for it's purpose, despite being too short to protect your pants if you aren't right up against the table, but it is not dignified.  I was hoping it would wear like stuff you get when you are eating messy seafood, but it really just looks like a giant baby bib, even more so in person than in the pictures.  I couldn't do that to my dad and just sent it back."
2.0,it came with loose stitching around neck.it also fell apart after first wash
2.0,"I ordered this ring directly from two birch. I loved this style and had admired it for some time. i found this exact same ring at Jareds and tried it on, loved it. It was 1500!!!!! I was thrilled to find it here for much less. I will say customer service was amazing! We needed this ring fast and was rushed to us in less than a week. But, there is no sparkle in this ring. I chose to go with the white sapphires. Big mistake. No sparkle at all. Ring looks dark and dingy. i have other white sapphire jewelry that is sparkles and is beautiful. This is not. My other big concern is comfort. its ok now. i went up a half size from my normal ring. so my engagement ring fits perfectly in the guard. but i worry in the warmer months when my fingers swell a bit it will be uncomfortable.This ring is very very bulky. it is not the most comfortable right now. I am thinking about returning it and having the sapphires replaced with czs...........maybe i would get a better sparkle. Who knows."
2.0,"got for husband,he liked it, we traveled with it, it lost its button on top, lasted less than a week, left it in our hotel. :("
2.0,Its ok. Pretty cheap and the elvish is printed on not carved
2.0,"I have mixed feelings on this sweater, to say the least. I got a size medium in the color solid light grey, which is my normal size. For reference I am 5'7 and 130 pounds (35-28-36), which would make me a large or extra large going by the size chart. I could have sized up, but the medium was Prime shipping, while size large cost money for shipping (it still took 11 days to get here though). Additionally, I wanted it to fit more cropped since I planned on wearing it opened over other clothes, like a cardigan.<br /><br />I realized after getting it that you can't wear it open, because it's literally sewn closed. The buttons are just decorations and physically can't be opened. This is funny to me because the item name ""cardigan sweater"" implies it is opened in the front. The fabric is also very thin and rough. Unfortunately I will have to return this sweater, if my 9 year-old daughter doesn't want it. It's just too tight and short to wear on it's own as a shirt for me. If you decide to get this I would definitely recommend sizing up, unless you like a tighter fit!"
2.0,Runs very small! And short!
2.0,"This dress came and it was WAY too long and the fabric was very heavy and loose in the top half of the dress.  I thought it would be a good fit for someone with an hourglass shape like myself, but it was very awkwardly designed.  I ended up returning it."
2.0,"Buckle does not have a curved hook, so it pops out of the holes in the belt.  The face is easy to scratch."
2.0,"The colors faded and the fabric fuzzed after the first wash.  Otherwise, I really liked the fit and cut."
2.0,Seems like some items are not realistic for sizing - had to return
2.0,Kind of disappointed because handles are on the inside.
2.0,It looks kind of plastic.... not as nice as I thought it would be.
2.0,"I'm 5'3, 38D, and 135 lbs and this was too small."
2.0,not much to say
2.0,"Tore at wrist.  :(<br /><br />Flexible, comfortable."
2.0,sent back; couldn't get the wrinkles out....decided I will never buy Chiffon again
2.0,"I love the look of this dress, just not on me. The top at the bust sticks out. I guess it is not made for smaller chested women. I am a 34 B and there is no way I could wear this dress. I ordered an XS."
2.0,"One star if not for the price. Padding around the heels is extremely bad, I had blisters after walking in them for one mile (after breaking them in around the office for a couple months). The laces are cheap and fray, the leather fades badly, and the glue between the soles and the leather is struggling. The boots don't breathe well, keep out water well (even with silicon spray, and the boot bends in all the wrong places and ways. If you just want a super cheap boot to wear in the office then this is ok, but don't expect to actually walk outdoors in them."
2.0,"I don’t know how these can be advertised as a sports bras. The material is the same as nylon stockings...which makes them extremely comfortable and stretchy, but zero support. They work ok for me since I’m using them as nursing bras for night time, but they provide zero lift. I might as well not be wearing it at all if I’m walking around. Also the padding is a joke...I removed them as they bunched up constantly."
2.0,These pants are tiny!! I am 5'6'' and they came just past my knees and were super tight and I ordered a Large. I do not think these are for adults!
2.0,"I was disappointed in this dress. It doesn't fit like it does on the model in the photo. The photo makes this look like a pretty classic A-line, with a little flare to the skirt from the waist, but actually it's more like a fit and flare, and it clings to my hips- not flattering for my shape at all. I'm returning it."
2.0,"After washing, this dress shrinks to the point of a long tunic so you can no longer wear it as a dress unless you like having your butt showing."
2.0,"This was for a child's birthday,  so he was happy.  the logo image is nice, the fabric quality is terrible.  it is thinnner than a kitchen towel and my guess is that it will pill up, shrink out of shape and the bright colors will run when washed.  also,  seller gouged pricing on the shipping,  would not ship 2 together and the AMAzon website which promises to ship itmes together when ordered within an hour ignored this completely.  the whole thing was a big rip off !!!!!!"
2.0,Too tight on my arms. Very thin material. Must run small.
2.0,Extremely difficult to program
2.0,"Ehhh it’s the not the worst but expect it to be worse than Walmart quality. The design is as pictured but the sweatshirt is very cheap and thin not like pictures. I will be returning this today and buying the one off Etsy I had my eye on. Was trying to save money, but cheaper is not better in this case."
2.0,Poor quality especially the tulle. Bought for an occasion but could not use. My daughter only uses it as a play dress
2.0,"Hey, these teeth ddin't work for me. I couldn't get them in my mouth. I read the directions like five times and soak the teeth but i could get them to work in my mouth. So i didn'twear on halloween with my costume."
2.0,Am disappointed that I cannot wear this item. . . .  I will be returning it. . . .
2.0,"very cheap material and the sizing is off, it was much too small and clingy, I sent it back, the buttons don't gather the material as it is depicted in the picture."
2.0,Ordered this thinking it’s for women. It’s a kids size. My 9 yo would fit in it.
2.0,"Am yanking them up all the time, but I like the color"
2.0,The quality was wonderful but the sizing was terribly off. They were supposed to be for my 12 year old...they were a near perfect fit for my 8 year old.
2.0,I bought these for my granddaughter over priced and way too big!  I now realize why no measurements or picture of actual modeling of this earring it is definitely meant for someone with large ear lobes . Not suitable for girls...as description stated.
2.0,Not as advertised.  It wasn't a particularly cold night but my feet were still cold.  They are short and go just past the ankles.  I'm disappointed in the product as a whole.
2.0,Super cute but runs small. Also there was a tear under the arm which was not cool. Didn't have a chance to send back so oh well.
2.0,"Poor quality, lose threads, poor look"
2.0,"If you can make the dress size fit you well, the dress Could be worth it. I think Ross probably has nicer ones at their store that you can try on. To me, this dress wasn’t made that well, there was a weird gap where the back began and the tie strap was. Also, the cross cross straps in the back were either too high, right across my shoulder blades so i couldn’t move, or too lox and I had to keep pulling them up. I just was not impressed. I am 5’5” 34 D athletic build 150lbs. I ordered a M and it was too big. Material had stretch so that’s good. The bag arrived with a hole in it, not sure what that was about. The dress was still in okay condition thankfully"
2.0,Beautiful watch but the case is rather heavy on the wrist but not uncomfortable.  Giving it 2 stars because I owned it less than a month probably wore 2 times and the gold plating on the clasp began to fade. I bought the watch specifically because it was 18k gold plated vs gold tone stainless steel. Started off as a little spot of discoloration but then became sizable and continues to fade.  It's on the clasp so it's not readily visible but I notice it and bugs the heck out of me while wearing it.  Needless to say I am returning the watch because amazon does not offer an exchange option but would definitely repurchase. Also the watch came without a battery guard so who knows how long the watch was stored while the battery was running.
2.0,Too big for my liking. Look black/ dirty on the side (bezel). Too expensive to return it. So I keep it even I don’t like it.
2.0,Ordered an XL and received a small. Returned.
2.0,Small and jogging suit material.  Not dressy as expected.
2.0,"Super cute, I got lots of compliments and it was very supportive for my 38f/g chest and it's impossible to find affordable and flattering tops for my size. However, I don't swim or go to the beach much and though it's been a year since my purchase, after around 5 or 6 wears and being washed as directed, the underwire popped out. Super disappointed in the quality."
2.0,Not a good fit for me so returned them<br />Liar jeans always fit well but these were off.<br />Also the color was not flattering.
2.0,I bought this band because I thought it would be glittery but the specks on it are just yellow dots. There is no glitter to this at all and I'm very sad about it.  It's also a type of rubber that will make you sweaty and good the sweat there so your wrist is just hot all day long.  I do not recommend
2.0,I like the style and concept however I returned these because they are cut small and the zipper on the legs were not comfortable.
2.0,Not a fan of shorts that have the underwear In them. Personal preference
2.0,"Were good, had no issue till lenses just fell out about a month later. No crazy drops or falls, just kept in car.  Disappointed,  but u get what you pay for I suppose"
2.0,I dislike this product because it breaks easily
2.0,I liked this band but it was WAY too long. I contacted customer service and they told me they could do nothing about it.
2.0,"Very thin product, expected it to be a little thicker since it’s a long sleeve. At least it’s not see through!"
2.0,button really sucks....will never buy these again
2.0,Came HALF MADE<br />On one side the design matched the photo and the other did was poorly stitched and didn't match.<br />Other than that the fitting and the length was as expected but it's not worth anymore than the price given.
2.0,Looks ok. If u want something expensive and high end then this isn't the one. Sizing is good. Delivery was faster then estimated.
2.0,"I really loved the fit on this, however, after a few washings (inside out) the whole front of the shirt pilled. I know there are gadgets you can purchase to remove them, I'm just not a believer in having to works so hard on keeping my clothes looking nice. The shirt is now an outdoor working shirt. Sad!"
2.0,Arrived with one of spindles broken out of the box
2.0,"I am on a life long search for non slip socks. Unfortunately, after just a few steps, these socks were off my heel and bunched under the arch of my foot. Wore first pair 10 minutes, and will toss the whole set out now. Too bad, as the fabric is comfy. Not really worth the effort to return. I wear size 10 ladies shoes."
2.0,But not for me.
2.0,"I purchased these to wear on a vacation and found them to be extremely thin and short. No matter if I were to sit, stand, or lay down these shorts were a perpetual wardrobe malfunction."
2.0,Shiny material and run a little small
2.0,"After a few months, these began to crack.<br />I will not purchase another pair since these were pretty expensive and are not holding up."
2.0,"This purse barely holds my wallet, looks cheap, and feels cheaper. The strap is completely unattractive, uncomfortable, slips out easily. Even for twenty bucks, this is a terrible bag."
2.0,The quality is not bad but the sizing is incorrect.  Even after measuring and ordering the recommended size the outfits are significantly smaller.  I am guessing these are supposed to be children's sizes?
2.0,Arrived with some fringe missing.  A few beads fell off when I tried it on.  Color was beautiful though
2.0,"This dress was HUGE! I am a 4 on top, 8 on bottom, and I got a Small. It fits like a L. Had to send it back. Gorgeous color though!"
2.0,Product was leaking and felt half full when we got it
2.0,"They looked good, but fit and comfort was poor."
2.0,"Well, the pair of slippers last me 8 months. Mostly just wore them around there house, but the seam on the side of the slipper started to split apart. I wanted affordable house slippers that would last me a while. What I received was an expensive disposable disappointment.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- fast shipping<br />- Keeps feet warm<br /><br />CONS:<br />- faux fur inside the shoe mats down after a while and doesn't provide much (if any) cushion<br />- poor construction details show over time"
2.0,"False advertising and false description.<br /><br />Not ""linen-cotton"" or ""100% cotton.""<br /><br />Seller should be ashamed of listing the scarf falsely. Amazon should start punishing sellers who make such false listings, because this is a rampant problem.<br /><br />The green color was not accurate, and I'm very good at determining colors.<br /><br />Scarf is very soft, slick even. I should have done the burn test before putting it in the laundry, but I was doing my delicates, so I didn't do the burn test until after.<br /><br />The green scarf was wrinkle free out of the front load washer. Hung to dry next to the beige one (actually cotton). After about 30 minutes, used a lighter on the fringe and it melted, so proof it's not 100% cotton.<br /><br />The green scarf has a straight, generic fringe, like cheap fabric.<br /><br />The green scarf also included a ""Rich Moment Accessory Designs"" probably cotton or linen drawstring bag, which is possibly nicer than the scarf.<br /><br />I'm quite disappointed. I wanted a 100% natural fiber scarf, I have enough bamboo and viscose scarves!<br /><br />I'll not trust the company/seller again!<br /><br />Pictures show side by side comparison of the beige scarf and (not accurate color shown) green scarf that are supposedly ""100% cotton"" according to descriptions.<br /><br />Also, green scarf has raw edge on all sides. Note burn test melted fringe on green scarf, and lack of wrinkling that 100% cotton is known for.<br /><br />I can't recommend, since seller more than once incorrectly stated fiber content."
2.0,"Read the Size chart before purchase.....these size feel different... I usually wear large size Clothes...But this jacket would take me down to a Medium..when it came I tried it on..LOOK nice, COMFY....Smell kind of odd (but it's to be expected i guess)... after like 10mins of wearing and inspecting...notice there a few stitches loose( easy fix with matches) and the sleeve is a little too long, also the jacket look...baggy...definitely need to return for exchange...BUT then saw that i have to return it to the manufacture itself, not through amazon. So that mean...post stamps, and delivery fees..Meaning either way i'm not gotta get a full refund.....and there's no exchange option...and even if there is..probal;y charge me another couple dollars for a smaller size jacket.... guess i'll just have to return now, too bad.. did kind of like the jacket, would have been a 4 stars..but the return policy with no exchange option just killed the experience all together."
2.0,"This is just a badly designed sports bra.  The front closure doesn't work well-it's a struggle to work the zipper, even with a closure mid way up the zipper.  When you launder the bra the pads inside come out and they're hard to manuever back inside.  Won't purchase this again as it's too much work."
2.0,"This was several size to small. Ah, well. Caveat Emptor."
2.0,The outfit was okay. The color was too bright red for me so I decided to send it back.
2.0,"Not a good fit, a young adolescent maybe but definitely smaller then appears on the image and cheap fake plastic coating crap"
2.0,Bag was way too small. Will not hold a standard cellphone
2.0,Wrong sizing... Didn’t fit .. barely fit my 10 yr old daughter
2.0,"It's just ok, feels like it's plastic...<br />a bit of a struggle with the bucklels,everytime<br />you go to buckel them the straps move the opposite direction, i may return it.."
2.0,"Soft, cute, fits nice and loose, but already has a hole in the crotch after wearing and washing 1x. Wouldn’t recommend for the money."
2.0,"I've read through all the reviews and it seems as though children size 8 and smaller seem to be O.K. although the bigger kids, size 10 and older were not made big enough.  The sizes do not seem to be made for growth spurts that kids start to go through when they reach 10 years older and above.  My kid just turned 11 and is 4'11"" as are half of his classmates.  Also, its better to have longer pants than shorter pants at least they can grow into them or hem them.<br />So, I am going to try for size 14 since size 12 looks like it is for an 8 year old."
2.0,"Beautiful piece, Clasp broke third time worn. Fragile chain caught on hair. Seriously bummed."
2.0,She could no even don the top.  It didn’t fit right at all and was very difficult to even try on
2.0,The coat looks ok although I thought I ordered it from a different manufacturer and I didn’t expect the faux fur to be dark. I just opened it tonight. It has a bad odor. Maybe that will decrease in a day or after I wash it. I’m not happy with the smell.
2.0,Not impressed at all my shirt is not the color shown in the photo above. 😕 The lettering is not bright white the red is fading into the lettering.
2.0,it is too small<br />I can't use it size 10 look like size 8.if could return it .<br />normally my chose size is 10.
2.0,"Ordered a Large (my usual size) and it fits me super huge, I could have done well ordering a Small. Can’t wear. I will be donating it."
2.0,the bar was to long and 2 had stones missing
2.0,"Santa brought these slippers for my 8 year old daughter.  She loves them - they fit well, are soft and warm.  Within 5 days of mild (laying around the house) wear the entire back seam had split open on one of the slippers.  Since Santa brought them, she won't part with them for me to do a swap.  Guess I'll try to patch them up but I wouldn't recommend them to anyone else."
2.0,I received my Angel Wing earring cuff. After wearing it for a few hours it was falling off the top part of my ear. It is beautiful though<br />Thank You<br />Pamela Morrell
2.0,I loved it but the size runs really small
2.0,"I was confused when purchasing these socks. They said “meme” socks, but the picture of the socks didn’t have any print. I thought the pattern/color of the socks looked nice. They are definitely nice-quality socks.<br /><br />They came and they have a typo... “hany” instead of I just want to “hang” with my dog. I wish I could’ve known what these socks would’ve have said or else I wouldn’t have gotten them for 2 reasons. The typo, and I don’t have a dog! I am a cat mom, so I have no use for these socks."
2.0,"I like the designs/style and the price. But you get what you pay for.. The metal that holds ends of the material is cheap, easy to bend, and pulls out easily. You have to be extremely careful with them. 3 of them have broken."
2.0,"Very thin material and pretty see-through. Also, not a very athletic or breathable fabric. Don't recommend, but that's what you get for the price."
2.0,Super cute but lasted 2 wears. Broke after. Don't recommend.
2.0,After wearing this for about a week it started changing color . I ordered silver and now it is fading to a gold color ... I won't ever buy again or would I  recommend .
2.0,only use these in that car when driving. Broke after the first week. Very disappointed. Buyer Beware :/
2.0,Runs super small!!!!! Ordered 18m and it's fits 12m..... not happy
2.0,The pants move/fall. The size ran a bit small for me... the correct size may correct the movement issue.  Got several compliments on the color and feel. Return/exchange process needs approval and customer pays return costs.
2.0,The material was not soft. It feels like a very low quality product. I returned it.
2.0,It was too sheer and light for my taste
2.0,"From Gifted Person: Nice design, seem well made. Fit TTS with exception of somewhat binding waist band. Material seemed heavy for summer & denser. Label shows 35% cotton but material feels like 95% + polyester. Not soft."
2.0,"Knowing that other reviewers commented that the product broke easily, I was very careful not to over torque the product. Over a period of six weeks, I slowly and gently kept pressure on the shoe. After six weeks, I checked and it definitely widened the shoe. Unfortunately, I also noticed that an internal piece was broken.  I tried to contact the company but they failed to respond. Because of this, I cannot recommend the product."
2.0,I wore it once no issues. The second time I wore it the pendant fell off.
2.0,I received it with a ripped pocket seam. Which was majorly disappointing bc I really liked the apron design and material!
2.0,"I like the idea, and look on the model, but it didn’t look as good on me. I have a very small head (hold size hats and sunglasses...) but the hat seemed a bit too small even for me; plus the wire rim was funky to try to shape. My BF said it looked like I had a pie crust on my head!"
2.0,"the bag is a cool idea, but did  ot hold its shape unless totally packed. The zippers are cheap and it did not roll behind me well. If your looking for a budget bag, this will work, but if you dont mind spending a few extra dollars, get something else"
2.0,"Definitely not as cute as pictured. Cheaply made,  non returnable."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:2382d9c867a096f3342647f17597c4f2]] It is soft but if you look at the picture the embroidery was not done right. And is already lifted up. I'm a little upset about it.
2.0,Such a cute bracelet. But the first time it fell on the floor the bow broke off. Took it to the jewelry store and they glued it and of course the bow fell off right away again. The bow IS NOT securely attached to the bracelet.
2.0,"This thing’s smell will almost knock you over when you open the package. I have no idea what the heck kind of chemical is on this, but it’s bad. Something needs to be done to fix this, cause it’s pretty much unusable with that smell."
2.0,The measurements are 2mm off and they don't cover the lenses entirely.  I had to return them.
2.0,"It looks beautiful not on a body, but on a body it is obviously a knock off since it doesn't hang with gravity in a natural way. It looks cheap/lightweight when around the neck."
2.0,I love the design of this purse but I have only had it a 2-3 months and the straps are fraying.
2.0,Sat crooked on my face and looked very big on me.
2.0,It states that it is for a women but the size if off and I am not sure if I would have ordered a size up if it would have been any better. not happy with my purchase. Plus it too alittle while for me to receive. Not Pleased at all
2.0,"The pattern is cute and the fit is flattering. That said, you get what you pay for. Cheap fabric and it looks like it was cut with scissors (and not evenly) and never hemmed at the bottom of the tank."
2.0,"Tiny holes have appeared in all pairs, very poor quality"
2.0,"The zipper is kaput, it doesn't work once you have on the skirt. The lining in the suit is always peeping out."
2.0,Didn't last over a month
2.0,"The color was off.  It’s not a white logo, it’s pepto pink.  The Roxbury color was accurate and nice.  I am not big on top and I purchased XL to fit baggy for layering but the sweatshirt fitted very snug, like youth size, not woman’s size, let alone plus size.  Disappointed with it being Way to small for American sizing!!!"
2.0,"The waist is too high, and if you have a thing larger than a B cup, this dress isn’t for you. Unimpressed."
2.0,"I'm quite disappointed with this bag... the bag looks as is advertised and the color is beautiful. However, I do prefer a little more structure with my bags.  This bag kind of collapses on itself making it very difficult to find anything.  Also after two weeks of light use, the inside of the bag started to rip.  It looks like it wasn't quite sewed on correctly (the inside was sewed on too close to the edge of the cloth) thus after just a little use, the cloth started to unravel and rip.  Definitely will not be purchasing anything from this seller again."
2.0,"High waist drawstring shouldn’t really be a thing, as these pmts show. The effect is a lot of baggy fabric between the waist and the thickest part of the hip or thigh. It’s frumpy as can be and accentuated by the lack of stretch. Perhaps it’s fine on narrow/straight hips and thighs but it’s not kind to my pear shape. The cool 70s silhouette in the picture is hard to achieve.<br /><br />Quality is on point for low priced fashion pants. Think Ross juniors department: not for long term wear but fine enough until you get tired of the look."
2.0,Love the design. However it definitely will turn your finger green. So I'm disappointed with that.
2.0,The eyes are off center. In not sure it's possible to wear this and walk safely.
2.0,"This is poor quality. My 3 year old doesn’t care, but the trunk is so tiny and the tusks are coming out at different angles and look like different lengths. You can see hot glue areas everywhere too. I would buy elsewhere."
2.0,"The pictures show that one side is sparkly and the other is plain but it really makes a difference when you see it. Also, it's really big."
2.0,"Really like the style and construction for the most part.  Leather lining is great, stitching is good, etc.  Toe box however is unacceptably tight, I can feel the shoe on the top of my big toe.  Otherwise the shoes fit true to size and are very comfortable.  2nd problem:  One of upper hook eyelets broke off the first time I wore the shoes.  Sole is fairly soft, has a lot of grip but may not last long."
2.0,i just ordered this ear cuff about a week ago because I absolutely love them. In terms of quality this particular ear cuff is nice and pretty but the size is the problem. I already have small ears to begin with and the fact that this one was too small was crazy. This ear cuff could only fit a child's ear so I broke off the piercing part and now I just wear it without it going through my ear.
2.0,"I am torn about how to review this shirt; the fit is pretty good everywhere but in the arm holes. I bought this specifically for the gym, which I imagine a lot of the people buying this work out to some degree, but if you have sizeable traps, lats, or delts, the bottom of the arm holes of this shirt will dig into your armpits in a really uncomfortable way. Otherwise the quality and cut of the shirt and print are really great."
2.0,Material feels very cheap
2.0,Too small for large iphone
2.0,These shirts are not cut right ordered three colours and all fit poorly. Something is wrong with design
2.0,"Great size, quality leather. BUT, the zipper is starting to fail just 10 months after purchase, which of course is unacceptable because I don't want to lose all my money and credit cards! The zipper is literally the most important thing about this type of wallet."
2.0,"These shoes are not leather, as described. My son put them on and wore them and they’re ok but they are some kind of smooth material (feel plastic-like), not leather at all."
2.0,"Not true to size, I ordered xxl and it was way small still"
2.0,This screws at ends fell off. Lost all of them
2.0,You should order a much larger size than normal and very form fitting.  Uncomfortable to work out in.
2.0,The clothes are too big
2.0,"If you care about the texture of a garment do not buy this. Cheap, weirdly heavy, hangs unnaturally. It just feels gross."
2.0,Very durable but rot thick and bulky to do things with while wearing it
2.0,The padding seemed to be in the wrong place and did not provide padding where I believe it should be. The legs would ride up making for an uncomfortable ride towards the end.  The material and construction appear to be good but I cannot overlook the comfort issues.
2.0,The straps are thin and cut into me
2.0,not a very good quality
2.0,"The description lied. The necklace does not adjust to 3 different lengths. And is 17 1/2” long, not 16"" as stated. Very disappointed. It's too long for what I wanted."
2.0,Quality wasn’t too good. It didn’t fit properly
2.0,Looks nice. Kinda baggy. Material or how it's sewn is not good. Wore if once and 2 buttons fell off and big rip where the material is scrunched.
2.0,The only thing I liked about this headband was the fabric. Its very pretty. But it was too tight and my head is small and when I looked at myself in the mirror wearing it I saw a circa 1950's depiction of a housewife on her knees scrubbing a floor. That's how it looked on me - like part of the costume of a cleaning woman character in a play.
2.0,These pants are about as tall as my almost two year old. I would have to roll them up about a foot 😂
2.0,"First, the good: this dress is well made, and has substantial heft to it. There are lots of intricate details.<br /><br />The bad: I'm a lanky 5'7&#34;, with a 26&#34; waist. 32.5&#34; hips and 32&#34; bust. I ordered a size 2. It was still wayy too big for me, like laugh out loud, ridiculous big. I looked like a little girl playing dress up. The funniest part was the molded cups-- it seems that instead of making smaller cups for a smaller size, the designer simply moved the cups up higher- the cups would easily accommodate a generous C cup, but rested awkwardly just below my collarbone.<br /><br />The couple photos by other reviewers look great, so obviously this dress works for some people. I'd suggest taking a pass if your measurements are similar to mine, but if you're more generously endowed, having a roaring twenties themed shindig, and getting the free shipping/free returns Amazon Prime deal,  go ahead and try it out."
2.0,"size 6.5 foot very tight on toes, numbs them"
2.0,"While it fits the body, its not long enaf to use as a beach cover! Dissapointed"
2.0,"They are super comfy and stylish, however I bought them to replace a pair that I purchased and was see through, and these are indeed see through when you bend over at all. I would recommend trying to find a pair that is not so sheer."
2.0,"Pretty dress,just too tight in the waist"
2.0,"I was expecting a little bit better quality. The inside is  great, but  the outside straw is very thin. Feels a bit cheap and it may come undone. I wore it out one day with a green shirt and it got stained."
2.0,Not big enough f
2.0,Just changed my mind when it arrived. Good quality though.
2.0,"This dress runs so big and doesn’t have anything fitted about it, it’s like wearing a box! I am 8 months pregnant and the Small was still huge!"
2.0,Color was not even close!!!<br />Ugly for sure
2.0,I do not like these earrings. They are very shiny and tinny. It looks a bit cheap. I won't be wearing them.
2.0,"This doesn't look as nice as I thought it would. It's a little too big but for the cost and bother to send it back, I'll give it to charity."
2.0,Fit a little small. You can see right thru them.
2.0,They are thick and look like coins. Not as delicate as they looked on the photo.
2.0,The tag itself is of good quality but the silver ring attached to it is so flimsy that it broke the first time I tried to open it.
2.0,These pants fit well and the stitching seems durable. The fabric is flexible and comfortable. I really like the pants but the front thigh pocket zippers were not put in correctly and broke. I plan to sew the pockets shut and still wear the pants but that makes them less useful.
2.0,"After 17 days, the pants tore. They made these pajamas out of cheap material. I didn’t expect them to tear so quickly. The shirt is very nice and keeps you warm, but the pants were very cheaply made."
2.0,Stupid. I blame this purchase on watching Tik Toks at 2am
2.0,A lot of sown splits when I opened package. I am 5”9 costume was way too tight I got a large and I am also 160 pounds so not very stretchy or comfortable for me unfortunately because it was super cute in appearance
2.0,"As many other reviewers noted this pendant turns an ugly yellow after about a year.  If someone know a way to clean it, please share!"
2.0,No immediate impact on arthritis in hands as I had hoped.
2.0,I didn't like how it fit on me and the top looked kind of weird.
2.0,Good product/ wrong color.
2.0,"not impressed, kinda disappointed. there was metal shavings in the bag, the clasp is loose and non consistent. the clasp dosn't lie up with the bar and the finish isnt the best bronze appearance"
2.0,Really tight socks - have difficulty getting them over my heals to put them on.  Length wise is fine.  Look good once they're on...but can hear the stitching breaking getting them off again
2.0,The leather began peeling off I wish it’d worked out super disappointed it was so beautiful for about 2 weeks. I hoped it was more durable for leather. Maybe it isn’t real leather.
2.0,"First of all I was sent the incorrect color, but I didn't have enough time to go through the whole return process and get a new dress before my event so I just wore the wrong dress. At least they did send me the size I asked for. The top of the dress fits larger than the bottom of the dress. Like they expect your boobs to be extra large but your stomach not to match? Anyway I am 5'4"" and 200lbs and I ordered the XXL because I didn't want it to be tight around my waist. I was correct that an XL would have probably been tighter than I preferred at the ""waist"" under my bust, but the shoulder and bust area was loose on me. I have broad shoulders and a D cup. Also the top fabric is soft, but the skirt is scratchy as all hell even after I washed it. I imagine if the skirt was not black it would be see through as it is quite thin. It functioned for the event I needed to wear it to. It was inexpensive. It was the incorrect color. It is over now."
2.0,"Fit fine,  but holes in the knit material right out of the package...."
2.0,Ordered 3 times and all 3 times I got the wrong size...sad because I'm very excited about this dress :(
2.0,"The sleeves hit your elbow and back hits right below waist, definitely does NOT look like the photo with the gal in jean shorts and black hat. Disappointed because it looked so cute in the picture."
2.0,"dress was ordered as a large however, it was really snug fitting. so if you plan on buying for your size, order one size up."
2.0,"Adorable sweater however ,the material is very thin and the hood pulls back when not used and the button pushes against the child’s throat."
2.0,"Very strange fit....perhaps some instructions may have helped?  But trying to tie and tuck, and hold up the bottom off the floor long enough to figure out how it goes.  Strange.....if you move....like try & do Yoga or Tai Chi, it just morphs back into this large piece of material with intermittent seams....  Still not quite sure what to do with it."
2.0,"I just received these and they are small. They are very pretty but I'm debating returning them because the flare is basically not there and I'm sure I've been sent the wrong size. It says 9/16 on the label so idk if their size runs small. Hard to tell because of how small the flare is but comparing them to my other gauges makes my older gauges look way bigger, and i only received 11 out of the 12 i was suppose to get. Just dont know if returning them is worth the hassle. Pretty disappointed. Picture shows 2 different plugs of mine with the plug from this purchase in the middle to show the difference."
2.0,Blurry vision. Must be cheap plastic.
2.0,"The belt sash is not as shown.  It's Very flimsy and way too small and narrow to be of any significance.<br />Therefore, it doesn't do the dress justice.  Pretty dress but fits small."
2.0,Does not fit as advertised. Very boxy
2.0,Seems started unraveling the first time I wore it (hadn't even washed it yet). Really disappointing for this price point.
2.0,"This is the second chance I gave this item.  The first time it arrived in a wrinkled ball stinking like women's perfume.  The second one arrived in another wrinkled ball, no smell but the arms were saggy and appeared stretched out.  I suggest buying two sizes down as the small hung on me like a sack.  Cute design though."
2.0,The top is too small for those who buy larger than a medium. It's like the top is not increased in proportion to the bottom. I had to use it in an emergency so I had no option than to pull the foam cups out and pull it as high as possible to help with coverage up top.
2.0,I am 5’1  Weight 105 the product was to big. I didn’t like the  material.
2.0,Very poor quality . Pieces on end come off
2.0,The lens is not tall enough to cover the lens on my glasses.
2.0,It’s super warm and nice however the zipper broke after about 2 months of use. Spend the money on a quality jacket.
2.0,"The pattern on these is adorable. Unfortunately the quality is lacking and the fit seems off. I bought a large and wear a 10-12 in pants usually. Waist fit well, but the thighs were SO TIGHT. Not sure why the legs are so small. I bought another pair from surf cuz at the same time for a similar price, and they’re much higher quality and better fit."
2.0,They arrived all folded up and squished in a box.  Ran small and flimsy.  I returned them.
2.0,I love a few of the tassel earrings. However there were some earrings that were so long that it went past my shoulders... quite large!
2.0,Was just as long as other shirts. Cheap material.
2.0,Started ripping at the seems after one use...I’m not even fat 😆
2.0,Clasp does not work.  The bracelet has to tight on your wrist or the clasp will twist off.  Bracelet does not stay on.
2.0,It could not even fit. The design was great but the ring just would not fit. Notify before please!!!!
2.0,"Material was very corse and scratchy. The large fit as expected, style was not flattering on my pear’ish body shape. Returned. 5’3 170lb"
2.0,The glasses are fine. But I ordered white and got the blue and yellow. Pretty disappointing since it was for a Father’s Day gift.
2.0,"Loved this dress. I washed it once and it shrunk so much that I cannot wear. I am 5'7""."
2.0,I love the color but the wallet will not stay snapped closed. No place for a check book.
2.0,Did not care for the fabric used! Their sizing is small!
2.0,"It just looks and feels cheap. The pattern is not cute in real life, it looks like a picture of jean texture was printed on the jumpsuit so it's just odd looking and again, not cute. It's also very thin which can be good for hot weather but the material is not really breathable. I don't recommend, you can def find something cuter."
2.0,What could have been a nice dress has shoulders that where made with a lumber square.  No one has shoulders this rectangular!
2.0,I like the product but 2 of the big ones came unstitched.
2.0,Super cute and my 2 year old loves them. Fit as it should until I washed it one time and it shrunk horribly. Not happy with product due to this reason. If you order make sure you order one or even two sizes bigger
2.0,This product is bright green not blue
2.0,Bought for Halloween.must be double zero.soo cute but very small
2.0,Muy débil la pulsera se rompió
2.0,You need to be flat chested or buy 1-2 sizes up
2.0,Looked nice when I bought it. Gave it to my mother-in-law for Christmas. And it broke in half 2months later😕
2.0,The material is extremely thin. My grandson will have to wear something over it.
2.0,Nice comfy shirt but way too short. I’m petite and ordered a size up and it is still like a crop top. It’s too short in general but definitely way too short for yoga. It seems this company has changed the length because older reviews rave on how the length is perfect and that is evident in the pics people posted but newer reviews are complaining of it being too short. Being returned.
2.0,They are hard to slipm on
2.0,This outfit was very long in the legs and the fabric is poor quality
2.0,runs very small and back is short
2.0,Too big not look like the picture.
2.0,"Low quality. About 5 out of 30 broke on day 1. I would return the item. However, my daughter (7 yrs) still likes them and wants them for her necklaces. Definitely not worth the money."
2.0,This band looks very nice BUT started falling apart after 2 weeks.
2.0,"Feels  cheap, piercing started reacting within a couple days. Balls are super loose, and the post being on the ball (having to screw the post into a hollow tube ring) is terrible. Lost a ball within a week and I had no idea. I would not recommend buying."
2.0,This is no true to size Buy 2 sizes to bigger if you want it to fit and it is very think material
2.0,"Fits as expected, but there is fading/color rubbing off after two wears."
2.0,"So, I ordered up a size, even knowing that it's an oversized sweater bc I wanted it really oversized, and it was way too big in width, but way too small in length.  It was very cute and well made (as far as stitching and material go).  Just odd sizing.  Not sure if I got one that was defective, or if it was made to fit a square.  I ended up sending it back though and the return process was super easy!  I would buy it again if I knew I got one that was just made wrong."
2.0,The armpits are ripping off when it came to mail
2.0,"The chains were a lot longer than I thought they would be. I was hoping the Saturn necklace would lay at the top of my sternum, but it is much lower."
2.0,"It's a good size and the piece itself is heavy; however, the clasp broke so I had to find another necklace to put it on. You can also see that a section that was supposed to be red either wasn't painted or fell off. My expectations weren't too high for what I paid, but still a bummer."
2.0,Item arrive on time but runs small.
2.0,"These earrings are very beautiful, however they are a Garnet color."
2.0,I did not realize how large this was.  Watch face too large for my wrist.
2.0,This fit closer to a crop top and the sleeves were way to short.  I ordered a Large (my normal size) and it was tight and way to short in both the body & the sleeves.  I would re-order a larger size to try - but they only go up to a Large.
2.0,"A little too fragile--split when I used with most posts, and didn't last long with thinner posts either."
2.0,"They seem like regular earring backs, just more expensive."
2.0,"This was my second order of the socks, as I loved the first order of these socks.  However, this second order of socks were far inferior to the first order.  The socks were of poor quality and were much thinner.  Also, I question if they are even K. Bell because the first order had the K. Bell name stamped on the bottom of each sock and these did not.  One sock even came with a hole in it!  Very disappointing and probably will not order again!"
2.0,"My wife had to repair shoulder strap twice, but previous one in different color was fine."
2.0,"When I see The package I was expecting to be great as the packaging was good ,, unfortunately I am very disappointed the balls are loose I can not screw them in , it is frustrating they won’t stay in so I would not recommend this item , waste of money definitely avoiding this company n my next purchase, the sparkling balls are beautiful to bad they didn’t do a good job with the rest"
2.0,Although the earrings were nice they will break as the clasp is too fragile and just after a few times of taking them on and off they broke. Will not buy again as I know they will break.
2.0,"Doesnt fit well (very small), and ultra shiny. Almost like costume jewelry or dress up jewelry"
2.0,nice bra design but the fit does not work.
2.0,Runs small order larger. Also very sheer.
2.0,"First time used and the zipper came apart on the main compartment.  The secondary compartment, the zipper doesn't line up so it's difficult zip it all the way.  I wouldn't buy it again."
2.0,"The pleating stops about 4 or 5 inches from the hem, looks weird"
2.0,"These are really comfy but not very flattering. They are not tight or have any kind of compression to them. I expected them to be more of a workout spandex short. They really looked awful on me, I am on the slimmer side so maybe they would look better on someone with more curves but for me they just looked boxy. I wouldn’t go out in them but they’re good for sleeping in"
2.0,"It acts as a wallet, but it doesnt have anywhere for coins which is a huge disappointment. I also wish the divider tabs were ones that were stationary. I dont like that they can fall out & get mixed up if you lay it down on its side unzipped. Otherwise I like it okay."
2.0,Too shiney - looks cheap!
2.0,"Weird fit, returned it."
2.0,Completely faded after the first wash on cold/delicate.
2.0,"Bought these for my daughter. Hoped they'd at least be plated in sterling silver. Nada. She put them in for one evening. Before the end of the night, her ear holes were black from the not real sterling silver messing with her sensitive skin and her ears were itchy.  They all went in the trash."
2.0,Larger than expected. Longer than expected do not fit for a regular fit.
2.0,"It’s a weird fit. Some parts of the shirt fits nicely like around the waist while looking at the front, but then the back has sagging spots. The collar is a little “floppy” like an old shirt that has had its collar stretched too much. Not a fan of the sleeves; the sleeves are a little to long for a t-shirt and has an awkward fit. The fabric feels really nice though and I love the blue color. For the quality and fit, it is definitely not worth $30!"
2.0,"I've had these earrings a little over 2 months and they are unwearable. The gold has flaked off on the the leaves and the post. As far as costume jewelry goes, I don't expect Tiffany quality, but the fact that these were nearly $30, I expected to be able to wear them more than 2 months. It's a shame, they're super cute and I got a lot of compliments for the short time I could wear them."
2.0,DIDN'T FIT
2.0,"the fabric is good and the brim is as shown, but the crown is really too high to be worn comfortably - at least by me."
2.0,Very cute but runs very small
2.0,Very cheaply made....lasted minimal time.  Would NOT order again.
2.0,"My daughter likes them, but if you buy them expect to see the black non slip non slip “buttons” from the bottom of the slipper all over your house. They started to come off immediately.  There was also a strong chemical odor at first that dissipated over time."
2.0,I should have returned it. But I am 36B and this does absolutely nothing for my cleavage. I just go braless.
2.0,Another product that reinforces the saying &#34;You get what you pay for.&#34;
2.0,The material is strange. Styrofoam like. Returned.
2.0,The mask was very loose and flimsy. It didn’t even hold up!
2.0,its too small like really small and it doesnt look all that great.
2.0,Do not recommend. Too difficult to put on 3 year old’s feet.
2.0,"The watch was very attractive, however, it did not hold the time, had to re-set each day. Once I set it, it ran all day, but next day, had to re-set again"
2.0,Very poor quality for a nurse on the floor. The compression is inadequate and they do NOT stay up for me. I pull them up at least 15 times in a shift. Maybe good for someone who sits more.
2.0,"I noticed another comment saying they sized up and I ALMOST did but I’m so happy I didn’t. I ordered a 2X which normally fits me comfortably but this dress looks like I was wearing bedsheets. It was so incredibly unflattering, sleeves to big and long, dress itself was too long, the armpit area fit odd. AND I received the dress TWO days before a Christmas party I needed it for. Needless to say - I purchased a whole new dress. Will be returning. Maybe downsize for it to fit??"
2.0,Again sent in custom measures and still huge. Had to get it altered. The shoulders were so wide they kept falling off even when altered. Still longer than measured.
2.0,"Thought it’d be a comfy and cute pj shirt- the color was actually really cute, so it was disappointing to find out that it is REALLY see-through. Definitely need to wear a bra with this shirt. If that’s your plan, then go for it- if not, keep shopping around."
2.0,"UPDATE: I've now had this shirt for over a year and I believe I've worn it once or zero times because of its cheap quality. The material isn't as flattering as I originally thought and the buttons are tacky and cheap. Overall, I am dissatisfied by both the look and quality of the shirt. It appears to be a cheap knock-off of some higher-end button downs. I do not recommend this product. However, it will still receive 2 stars (as opposed to 1 star) because the package arrived early and the price was cheap.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. arrived early<br />2. pretty similar to picture<br />3. price<br />4. size chart accurate<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. missing 2 buttons (the top button and 1 on the cuff, unfortunately)<br />2. I ordered the salmon pink and it came out to be more apricot (more orange/tan than pink)<br />3. cheap-looking tassels on ALL of the button holes<br />4. meant for fine-boned, thin Asian. I am a muscularly-toned Asian with slight curves. (fits loose and nice everywhere except the bicep/tricep area)<br /><br />It is the perfect shirt to tuck in or wear under a blazer. The size chart fit accordingly.<br /><br />Overall, I will keep the shirt (even though I'm very upset about the missing cuff button) but will probably not order any clothes from this company again. Although the shirt is cheap, I still expected quality as depicted. The shirt looks run-down because of the tassels and missing buttons. But besides looking like it was run through the mill, the shape and quality of the material and shirt was predicted."
2.0,I bought this as a baby shower gift and I have to say I was a tad disappointed. It took two months to receive it and it was quite large. It is cute and the fabric is nice.
2.0,Size runs bigger from waist line
2.0,"Beautiful band, but broke within two weeks!"
2.0,Too tight all around besides the waist as it’s loose. Very thin; scratchy and uncomfortable
2.0,This key ring is cheesy.  I’m not giving it to my mailman.  It’s embarrassing.  I wouldn’t recommend.
2.0,"The case looks really nice, but it's a bit thin and flimsy.  The handle is already starting to get loose and feels like it might fall off soon. I've only had it for a few weeks so that's a bit worrisome."
2.0,"No recommended, it is too small"
2.0,"I got double of most of these rings, which was nice; however, after just 1 hour of wear, it turned my finger green. Do not recommend it unless you're using it for costume jewelry. They look really cool; just disappointed in the quality. I'll probably try that trick where you put clear nail polish on the ring to create a barrier."
2.0,"Too long, baggy in the rear and hips.  Am returning."
2.0,Way smaller then I thought they would be :(
2.0,This is definitely not made to be adjusted to people with little wrists. It spins around to much and is flimsy
2.0,"This skirt sucks! It sucks! I wanted to love it so much, the zipper has broken multiple times, I've fixed it up until the last time when I literally just tore it off my body in frustration. The material is all right but kind of resembles a high quality garbage bag. Idk...i had high hopes but this skirt is just not built to last. I broke the first time I wore it and about another 4 times after before my ripping it off and throwing it out. Don't buy this skirt. Buy something better."
2.0,It fit too loosely. I feel like it was not designed for amply busted women.
2.0,"They take forever to get on just right, and the buttons started to fall off immediately."
2.0,Returned because fabric was see thru and it was for my 16 year old daughter very in appropriate
2.0,Honestly the colors were so faded and old school looking I didn't even open the package.
2.0,Too big for my Samsung Galaxy watch 42mm. Returning.
2.0,"Purchased several in different colors same size. They all fit different. Some tight in the chest some not, some loose in the arms and others too tight. Some longer and some shorter. None are consistently cut. They're certainly not the Russells of a few years ago."
2.0,Nice looking but frames cracked the first day I wore them.
2.0,"I ordered a 12 for my 9 year old fit just right, I also ordered some for my smaller girls but the order was cancelled by the seller... disappointed because they all wanted to match."
2.0,Lots of ear rings for the price but one set came damaged!
2.0,"According the dimensions on the product description, it should have fit my phone in it.  Also, other reviews said that it was big enough for a iPhone 6 plus without anything in it, so I was thinking I could stretch it out a bit.  My phone wouldn't fit at all, not even close.  It was definitely smaller than I was expecting.  It did have a strong plastic smell, similar to most PU Leather items.  The hardware didn't seem very strong or long lasting, another reason I wasn't a fan.  Not a bad item generally, just not what I wanted or needed so I sent it back."
2.0,A very cheapy type rayon material. There is a seam directly down the front and the polkadots don’t match up.
2.0,"I did not notice that there were no numerals, so I cannot tell if it is one or two o'clock, four or five, etc;.  It is a nice looking piece that makes a statement but I do not like wearing it due to the problem."
2.0,"I really liked the size and color of the Opals. Also, the price was really good. Unfortunately, the color of the gold stained pretty quickly."
2.0,The small is 5 1/2 inches across so I recommend getting a medium. The glasses were very good quality though
2.0,"This dress is nice, but my 5’3” size small daughter was expecting a maxi dress. Instead, the length is only mid-calf. She is supposed to wear this to perform with a school choir. They all ordered this dress from Amazon. Theirs are more maxi length. The dress fits her perfectly in every other way. I’m not sure what to do now. Her dress really needs to match the other girls’."
2.0,It ran much smaller then said.
2.0,The last pair that I bought one the of briefs the thread started to fall a part they are good but just the last pair don't know if I'll buy more
2.0,looks nice but came with someone's name engraved on it...
2.0,The purple color is much brighter than in the photo and the sizing is HUGE.  Order 2 sizes down.
2.0,"I am 5’7, 195lbs, DDD/F. I bought the 2xl because I’m top heavy. First thing I notice is the Mega gap and wings the top does under the armpits. Which I can pin and fix. But the overall dress is stiff, and straight. There’s no shape, even when tied at the waist the dress does not flare like the image. It’s just a rectangular piece of fabric with head and arm holes. It’s also a weird length, hitting below my knees."
2.0,Colors not true to photo - returned
2.0,"So the pro's first. I bought this dress and a pink one of the same cut and style from the same company in July. One I gave to my 4 year old for her birthday in October and one I saved for Christmas. She loved both of them. This one is particularly cute with the little unicorn with headphones on. I had bought dresses of a different style from this company before and they had been great quality.<br /><br />However, BOTH dresses have ripped along the seam where the ruffley part of the skirt meets the bodice portion. This black one was worn once... not even run through the laundry because she insisted on wearing it. It also has already started to lose the sequins within the first wearing. The seam coming apart is easy enough for me to fix but still very disappointing for my daughter.<br /><br />Besides the quality control issues, the sizing was as expected and they are cute dresses with good material. I just wish the quality hadn't been poor."
2.0,"I can't believe how incredibly hard it is to get the balls in and out of place!! I had to use pliers to even get the ball out, and it's nearly impossible to get back in. Tried it without tools to avoid breaking anything, but I nearly tore my fingernail off trying that.. The quality seems fine but it's just not made with a good design in mind."
2.0,"This looked like it fit at first. As she danced though it rode up and if I hadn't had her ""layer up"" It would have been a very inappropriate outfit."
2.0,Several of the underwear do not fit
2.0,No.mw agradó
2.0,Not a real leather... Only for narrow feet.
2.0,Led to believe I was purchasing the smallest size 38mm but what I received was way too big for my watch. It just reads as “small” versus an actual size…
2.0,"The crystal color is pictured on a white background so is deceiving in name. The frame is actually frosted which looks almost white against your face, not clear. I am returning them. Otherwise, they are nice glasses – though I imagine a little small for wider faces (my face is narrow so for is okay)."
2.0,the material for the dress is NOT it. it feels more like a cheap costume than an actual dress. it’s just very cheap and i was very disappointed
2.0,The quality feels great but I can't really say I'd be able to use them I ordered them in large and they are apparently a size to big so they don't actually stay on so I can't really recommend them because technically their not much of use for me
2.0,"Even though it wasn't expensive, I was still surprised by the poor quality (and I usually buy cheap stuff lol). They felt like necklaces you would get out of quarter machine in the lobby of a Denny's. It was a gift for my sister so we will just hold on to them as keepsakes instead actually wearing them"
2.0,They were very small when I received these.
2.0,The fit of these are really bad for a toddler.  I bought two different sizes and one fits her body perfectly but around the hip area it’s either cut too high or mad extremely baggy.  If she is standing a certain way u can see straight thru to her bottom.  I will be returning.  The material is fine.  Mom version is ok the cups in the swimsuit will make it irritating if you are swimming it’s not made right and cut wrong in the bag as well.  Will be returning all 3.
2.0,Loved these shoes--but the tip of them pulls apart from the bottom to fast--didn't last long at all
2.0,I guess you get what you pay for. My son typically grows out of sneakers before they fall apart. The velcro broke after about a month.
2.0,"Bought what I thought was the same dress in a different color. I absolutely loved the first one,  it fit well and received many compliments. This is a completely different dress. Different fit and design. This dress has a zipper the other didn’t. I’m 5”2’ 130 lbs and the medium is huge on me. Sending it back and purchasing from a different company. Order 1 size down if you chose this dress"
2.0,"this picture is deceiving, i thought the earings were bigger than what they actually are."
2.0,I sent this back because of the fabric feel.  It felt scratchy and cheap.  I loved the print but it wasn’t worth it.
2.0,The encompassing circle is small....it cut into my nipples and caused discomfort and scabbing. Cute concept sorely dissapointed in comfort levels.
2.0,I followed the guidelines for sizing and it barely fit. I would have kept it except for the fact that one of the buttons snapped in half before I even had a chance to try it on. It's a shame bc it's a nice blouse.
2.0,"I REALLY wanted to like these boots. I have been looking at them for a while. Decided on the black crazyhorse. Some photos make the black look very blue but they are actually a nice charcoal color so you can wear them with anything. Very beautiful look and feel to the leather. A little velvety but not much. You won't be shining these. The patina should become excellent!<br />Now, the downside, I ordered a US 11.5, but got a US 10?? They are hard to put on due to the flesh side in, but that is expected and will get easier over time. I could put my feet in and there seemed to be enough room but the heels were so uncomfortable and each step was awful. Standing was no problem, although 8 hours on a concrete floor might be tough. I bought these for my desk job and casual wear, maybe even church.<br />The heels felt both tight and loose ( I know you just shook your head, but it's true). I tied the laces different ways, but no change. The laces are thick and sturdy and lock in place very well, no slipping like some laces.<br />The tongue on the left shoe is crooked and makes you feel like pulling the tongue to reposition, but it won't fix it due to the cut of the leather. The right shoe had no tongue issue, so I think this may be a defective pair.<br />The insole curled up the heel cup (probably not the right name for it, but you know what I mean) and made a ridge that was irritating to step on. I don't think even breaking in would fix it and your feet would hate you.<br />So here we are: I love the look of the shoe/boot and the leather is great. I love the simple and basic style and design as well as the build, I just don't find these comfortable. If I get a bigger size, it may fix it. The tongue issue is all wrong on the left boot and a new pair should fix that, too. I am going to return them, no way I could use them as they are. I am not decided if I should buy another pair, as of yet. Man, I really like the look, hoping for better fit in the future."
2.0,I have other shorts this style but this cut is not flattering to my body shape.
2.0,Cute shirt and soft however sizing is way off I ordered a xl and if gifts more like a medium will be sending back
2.0,Did not even come close to fitting the size it said.
2.0,"Fell apart after 5 months.  First the piece that holds the strap down slowly tore apart, and the the connection to the watch broke."
2.0,"Beautiful, I love it... But I purchased this item once and after less than a year, it came apart. I figured it was something I did. Hit it or something. So, I went ahead and purchased another one. In less than 2 weeks (I had only worn it for about 2-3 days total), this one came apart the same exact way as the first one. So upsetting because it's such a beautiful piece and fits perfectly."
2.0,Beautiful dress but way too small! I ordered an XL and it's more like a M.
2.0,Not very easy to get on. If your breasts are small but your hips and butt are large then this is not a flattering suit. The top is way too big.
2.0,I was really looking forward to receiving this kimono but was kind of bummed when I opened my package and seen this. I love that it’s all rust colored print in the original photo and I’m not totally in love with the black accents. The material is sheer and the poms are all good. It’s still cute enough to wear but I feel that actual photos of this kimono should be displayed because the original item is much cuter and is a different material.
2.0,It turned out to be too big for me.  I'm used to a tri-fold so the width  was the major problem.  Otherwise it was a great wallet.  I just couldn't get it out of my back pocket once I put it there.
2.0,Well made but poor material and cheesy buttons were too big for the style and sat right at the nips like headlights.
2.0,"Item runs SMALL. Logos all feel tacky too, not sure how they'd hold up in washing machine."
2.0,Love the color.. They scratched after about a week of wearing them.
2.0,Received the items and they seemed to be of good quality but I ordered a medium and they looked like extra small. I know they are for compression fit but I would say you'd need to order them at least one size bigger than needed.
2.0,This item was larger than I expected and the material was uncomfortable on my skin. The neck line was far too low for my job as a teacher.
2.0,Flip flops should be able to get wet and not squeak.  When these get wet you sound like a fool walking around.  Total junk.
2.0,Not a true 12.
2.0,I was a fan of how these gloves looked and I was willing to give them a try. The major flaw in these gloves is the thumb design. The design keeps your thumb in a straight position and there is no padding at the tip of the thumb. So in my experiences throwing straight punches during mitt-work or bag work can become painful for the thumb through repetition.<br /><br />Another thing I dislike is the gloves lack a snug fit. So during sparring if you have fast hands and miss the momentum will cause the glove to begin to slip and you will find yourself pulling the gloves back down your wrist.<br /><br />Overall you get what you pay for. To the designers I hope you take my honest review into consideration.
2.0,Handle broke after two months
2.0,The fabric is see through.
2.0,You could kind of see through it so I had to wear shorts.
2.0,The straps are very thin and not built to last
2.0,"Had these in for about seven months. Noticed blue-green residue when washing.  Took them out.  Looks like some base metal coated in copper then plated. Yet one more example of ""I shoulda known.""  Going back to actual surgical steel."
2.0,"Gave breast an unnatural shape. I describe it as ""torpedo"" boob. Also minimized more than an inch.<br />I didn't want to make my boobs smaller."
2.0,"The arch support is not enough, not comfortable to wear.And the material is PVC only, instead of rubber, neither flexible nor comfortable to wear. In such a price, I says this is too expensive, not worthy at all. DISAPPOINTMENT！"
2.0,"Nice looking eyeglasses frame and the color is really beautiful, but there's a big problem with regards to the 2 side arms with bling-bling stones ...my hair keeps getting tangled in the stones and when I take it of it keeps pulling my hair which is really painful! I don't really know what to do about this problem! I just keep this eyeglasses kept in my drawer since then!"
2.0,It made me feel off...and eyes were still tired.
2.0,These run very small for posted US sized. Very narrow and the top is too tight on the foot.
2.0,"The band keeps falling off, terrible quality.  Looks nice, but you get what you pay for."
2.0,¡Thank you ! I'm received the package
2.0,Very stiff and hard to see how this expands especially for pregnancy. Wish I didn’t buy.
2.0,I had to return it as it was too big on me and the fur was itchy.
2.0,"These pants are so cute.......however, they are apparently made for children.  I bought a size large which said it would accommodate my 42” hips, but after measuring them, the hips are only 34”.  My waist is 32”, the waist of the pants is 28”.  Also, one of the belt loops is not sewn on at the top, which is an easy fix, and the button is larger than the button hole.  These would be super cute on someone who is not an actual size large."
2.0,I wanted the Solbean fuzzy slipper which I purchased before but you are now out of. This new slipper does not have the arch or foot comfort the Solbean has! Wonder if you will have more Solbean in the future????
2.0,The lens was scratched
2.0,Purchased these cause they looked square in the pics. They were very round and small. Disappointed.
2.0,Missing the black. That’s a staple piece.
2.0,Fell kinda short of my expectations
2.0,"Broke after one use, the screws were so loose pieces started falling off and got lost rendering these useless without those pieces"
2.0,Didnt notice enough of a difference
2.0,Cheaper made than appears in listing. Very wide for the size I ordered. Doesn’t look like what model is wearing
2.0,It's fake! Turns my wrist green.
2.0,"Nice concept, but one broke after only a few uses. Perhaps a tap weld would benefit this design."
2.0,Fabric is nice and feels good.  I'm normally small but ordered medium for a relaxed look.  I decided to return this because the pockets were not straight and the fit was a little weird.  It also cost 2x as much as the other velvet shirt that fits a lot better.
2.0,"I loved the idea, but they arrived with deep scratches and they were much shorter and heavier than expected."
2.0,"I really want to love this dress, however the one I received has a crooked hem line.  The weather has finally cooled enough that I can wear it, so I'm just realizing that it's crooked and it's too late to exchange."
2.0,"It 's an okay dress, the material is just okay. It fits kind of tight on the chest area."
2.0,It’s a pretty band but didn’t even have it for a day and one of the bands broke. So wasn’t worth the money.
2.0,"I do see some sort of filter in the lens, but the ONLY part of these glasses that have the reader magnification is a small portion at the bottom of the lens, kind of like bifocals.  I don't read from the bottom of my reading glasses - this does not work for me and I really would have liked to see that in the description to avoid buy these.  Even though they were packed well - a box inside a box, and inside a soft case, there was scratching on one of the lenses on one of the pairs, so not sure how that could occur."
2.0,Great colors. Poorly put together.
2.0,"I like the design of the dress and the gold brocade pattern at the top; however, the backing underneath the brocade kept shedding off everywhere I went and it was difficult to pull it off the underneath to eliminate it. Dress was too long, so I probably won't wear it (live and learn). This dress would be much better if you eliminate the paper attached to the underside of the dress that the brocade is attached to."
2.0,"This reeked of chemicals when I received it. After two washes using color save bleach the smell was finally gone. However, the fabric now looks worn and it picks up hair like crazy. The fit is large and flowy, I could have ordered a size smaller and been fine. The fabric is thin but not horrible. It's an ok top but I am not tempted to buy it again."
2.0,The product was more narrow than expected
2.0,"I did not like what type of fabric this was at all. It’s kind of shiny, not what I expected. The pattern was pretty though."
2.0,I don't like that all 4 items are a different shade of gold. It looks like a bunch of random items thrown together and sold as a set.<br />The disco plate or whatever it's called is plastic. The shades feel like they'll break if someone looks at them the wrong way.<br />The main things I wanted were the bracelet and the earrings but not a fan of those either.<br />Will be returning ☹️
2.0,I bought these in hopes thy would fit like another pair I received. This pair came about a size smaller then the first pair. Even though the tags are the same. They fit like a flare/boot cut yoga pant rather than a wide leg like the picture (my other pair was like the picture). Material is thin and cheap feeling.
2.0,"I returned this product because the picture that displayed the band turned out to not be what I thought it was. I wanted subdued colors, but go sparkly colors instead."
2.0,"Bought these for my 5 year old. First month of wearing them they started to fall apart. The grips on the sole started falling out and the sole also started to peal away from the toe box. If your kid is hard on shoes don’t purchase. If your kid doesn’t play on a playground or ride his bike then these will stay nice. Otherwise, don’t waste your money."
2.0,"Dress fits perfect and fabric quality is good. But it was delivered wet, oily, and smells of very strong chemicals. I had to take a shower after trying it on. The oil was all over my body. The bag it came in was also oily. I had other girls purchase the same one. Not sure if they had the same experience."
2.0,Not a fan. Little too 1940's school teacher with pointy shoulders. Not as big of a fan of the bow as I thought I would be.
2.0,Apparently I ordered the size too small.  The back and front were the same.  Usually the back is LARGER  because of the buttocks.  The fabric seemed nice but I will be returning.
2.0,"This belt is well constructed of durable materials and works well enough, but its fatal flaw is that you have to take it apart to get it on and off your pants.<br /><br />Blue jeans and other work/casual pants typically have a 2"" (50 mm) belt loop. The 1.5"" belt webbing is a good fit for this. However, the buckle has two parts. One part is fixed to one end of the belt and the adjustable part attaches to the other end of the webbing. Both of these buckle parts are wider and thicker than the webbing and neither will fit through the belt loops.<br /><br />So to get it on and off the pants, you need to remove the adjustable side of the buckle. This is trickier than it might sound and takes a few minutes, every time you put the belt on a new pair of pants or take it off.<br /><br />I would definitely not buy this again nor would I recommend it. Good enough quality, just very poor usability."
2.0,The pearls were wayyy too big. They looked ridiculous.
2.0,It was just too small.  I returned it.
2.0,I purchased this dress as a gift to my daughter. I gave her a entire new wardrobe for Christmas. She is usually a size small-medium in apparel. I ordered a medium just to be on the safe side. Its a very cute dress but it confused me. The Inside tag says medium however it was wayyyy to big. Not only was a few sizes larger but to my amazement I could fit it. I wear a XXL. Clearly this is not accurate and something is not right. Needless to say beware of the sizing. Normally I don't post pictures but I had to show proof. Does this look like a medium to you????
2.0,"Very flattering and comfortable, but the second time I put it on, one of the plastic circles on the back snapped off so now I have to use a string or some to attach the strap back on."
2.0,"Size is a problem, nice material, great detail. Maybe 3+ too small in larger sizes"
2.0,So cute but runs a full size (at least) too small. Can't wear at all. Us gals with bigger feet are just outta luck with this brand! Look elswhere.
2.0,Just cheap plastic… should have known…
2.0,I will be returning this item and it is nothing like the picture describes.  The fabric is polyester stretchy materiel whihc I didnt expect.  It does not hang a bit off the shoulder as pictures.i give it two stars because it is black.
2.0,The glasses have a wide bridge and make you look really goofy. Not a great fit unless you have a wide head. No return policy is a negative.
2.0,Does not fit toddlers it’s an adult hat
2.0,"After reading the reviews and size chart I felt it was safe to order my usual medium. After trying it on the fabric was drowning me, could have probably gone with a small or even extra small. Would be cute if sized correctly."
2.0,This is not a jumper.  This is not a sweater.  This is a shirt that is made of pieces together abstract-shaped pieces of fabric sewn together like a quilt and it is fully lined.  I'd describe it as more of a sweatshirt.  I returned mine.
2.0,Very pretty but the screw was extremely short. One fell out of my toddlers ear the first day.
2.0,i received this and straight out of the bag - it was broken. sent it back for a refund.
2.0,This was not hte same dress. They keep deleting my review. The dress pictures is from Azazie
2.0,Material seems good but fit is way off even after following the size chart. Waist is too high on my body
2.0,"Saying it runs small is an understatement. I usually wear a 10-12, so I ordered a US 14 (4XL) and it was way too small. It is going back."
2.0,Wore them to a Football game and the warming coils were only mildly warming.
2.0,"I am not a short man. I get it and hold the company to account  for THAT, but these things run CRAZY small!! At least 2-3 sizes small...."
2.0,Used it to go with a dress but the metal part of the belt broke every time I had to bend over or make sudden moves even when I loosened it.
2.0,not good quality. Too large in person
2.0,Looks like a plain gray scarf. Green color is very faint
2.0,Does not look like picture! Very unattractive!
2.0,The necklace and earrings are nice. The bracelet elastic was awful. Felt like it was going to fall apart in my hand before I even got it on. I ordered 5 sets and am having my MOL replace the elastic.<br /><br />I realize they were a bargain set but jeez. Flimsy at best when the rest of the set was far better.<br />I did not need the bracelets to fall apart during my wedding and have guests tripping and falling over beads on the floor.
2.0,"It's pretty and a good price, but it's very thin and delicate. I fear it will not hold up. I've only worn it once so far."
2.0,"They were perfect for about a month - comfortable, not outrageously long (I have very short legs), not baggy at all and not see through; however, after about a month of wear, they have become paper thin where my thighs rub and there are multiple holes in that area. Granted, I have this problem with a lot of pants, but these seemed to wear out far too quickly. Bottom line, I wouldn't buy these if your thighs rub because you won't get very much wear out of them."
2.0,"These are cute but mine came stuck together,  when I pulled them apart some of the sparkles came off. They took a bit to receive but about what I expected. The price was great so I wasn't that upset about them being stuck together."
2.0,Very thin and flimsy. Left my hands and walls with dark black marks. Not the best quality.
2.0,"Ran large. Very casual. When I initially purchased the item the photo looked different than the actual purchase received. I ordered the smallest size but it ran large so I returned it. It looks more like a pool cover up. I am petite, weigh 90 pounds, and am 5’0 for reference."
2.0,"I hate to write bad reviews, but for this product, I had to. The silicon sole squeaks as I walk around the office which is embarrassing. It sounds like I have a squeaker that you would find in a dog toy in my shoes!<br /><br />I wore one pair twice, and it already has 3 holes in it!<br /><br />I won't be buying these again."
2.0,Too long and baggy
2.0,"This has a weird hole where the twist is in the middle and it was a weird length (maybe that's just because I'm 5'3""). It was pretty sheer and the fabric is scratchy. I was going to try to make due for the occasion but I ended up just buying a different dress after deciding I couldn't aesthetically safety pin the weird hole closed. Would not buy again."
2.0,I would not buy these again. Some low priced items are a great value for the price. Not these. Spend a few extra dollars to get something that actually provides some comfort.
2.0,I can't even keep the shoe on ! The heel keeps slipping off !
2.0,these were better
2.0,The black color on the print was almost gray when delivered.
2.0,"I have other body suits from Full Tilt and they fit fine. Usually a little short since I'm 5'9&#34; but still do-able. This once is extremely short and probably at least once size smaller than regular knits due to the sweater knit. I'm going to have to find a way to extend the crotch but even then, it will still be too small/stretched out. (On the bright side, the fabric is fairly stretchy)."
2.0,"They are very soft, but not really warm and some pairs left fuzzies everywhere"
2.0,Very tiny at chest!  I ordered an XL and the cup was an A!!!
2.0,"Doesn’t look like the photo, I thought it was a tunic look top, buts it’s very short."
2.0,"Like: pattern and length<br />Hate: everything else.  The fit and shape are not as A-line as pictured. It’s weird in that it’s paper bag top, but then it comes out really wide at the hip (I have a boyish figure so if I’m saying this makes you look like your hips are massive in an unflattering way, take my advice), the pockets make you look huger too, it then tapers in a little and then back out. The pleats don’t run from top to bottom. They stop at a certain point which is where it looks like it tapers again and looks like it was a mistake in manufacturing. The fabric is cheap and there are loose threads throughout.<br /><br />I meant to return it but I just missed my window by a day. Meh meh meh. I couldn’t even give it away for free so it’s still in my closet waiting for someone to want it"
2.0,Too rigid to &#34;fit&#34; to toe.  Would not order it again.
2.0,"Horrible product! First I ordered a large, the bag read large but the suit was a small. Secondly, Took way too long to arrive. The mask has a crease in it but you CAN get that out by flipping it inside out and let it sit for a couple days. Overall don't buy and won't buy another. And whatever size you are add 2 sizes up"
2.0,material a bit flimsy and doesn't wash well. I should have looked more closely perhaps.
2.0,"Not advertised as a ladies turban, which is what the package says. I deliberately did not want a ladies' turban."
2.0,"I wanted a cloche style hat to wear to a Downton Abbey themed event.  I thought this might be nice, since it was made of light material and would be breathable.  When I received the hat, it was folded in fourths and secured with rubber bands.  This would be ok if the hat unfolded nicely and had no creases.  This was not the case…as you can see in my photos, it had some pretty big dents in it.  Perhaps they would’ve gone away in time, but I wasn’t confident the dents would pop out.  This was the first disappointment.<br /><br />And, unfortunately, the opening of the hat was too small for my head.  I don’t think I have an especially big head, but this was too small.  It sat on top of my head instead of allowing my head to fit into the hat’s recess.  To get the hat to go down further, I gave it a push, and my head went up into it, but the area near the brim was crammed down behind my ears…both of my ears protruded out and instead of fitting under the brim.  It looked terrible on me.  A lot of hats on Amazon say “one size fits many,” but I was incorrect in thinking this hat would fit.  Measure your head and find your hat size before ordering this hat.  I ended up returning it."
2.0,The material is very cheap. I will be surprised if it lasts one season.
2.0,I loved the way this fit but it shed feathers right thru the shell bc it does not have a lining. Very disappointing. Returned for refund.
2.0,"This is a lovely necklace, but arrived broken in one place by the clast.  When I tried to remove it from the package to fix, it broke in the front part of the necklace.  For something this cheap, it's not worth taking to get fixed.  I may try to super glue it, or just trash it.  You get what you pay for."
2.0,Per the size chart large should have fit me with room to spare. It does not... they are too small. I could barely get them on and could not zip them at all. The description states they are 95% polyester/ 5%spandex with an elastic waist. This is NOT correct! They are 65% cotton and 35% polyester with NO elastic in the waist.
2.0,Super cute but cracked in half after one time of wearing it.
2.0,"For me, this hat fits too tightly and even looks too small."
2.0,The item is a lot larger than I anticipated and very poor quality.
2.0,Do not waste your money on this item. When I received the necklace the big flower in the middle was broken off as well as 2 smaller gems. It only received 2 stars because this necklace really is as cute as it is in the picture just very bad quality.
2.0,Works but looks rather cheap. I found another company that makes absolutely BEAUTIFUL replacement bands. Too bad it's not on Amazon!
2.0,"I got this for skiing and it was very cold, I feel this is better at just a face mask and not for cold weather"
2.0,"I ordered an XL, but this was way too small.  I could not find any tags on the item saying what the actual size was, but it fit more like what I imagine a small or medium would.<br /><br />Overall, a nice product, fabric and design.  Fabric is more like polished cotton, not knit jersey.  FYI, collar does not extend the whole way around your neck, but that didn't bother me.<br /><br />I will reorder in a larger size."
2.0,"After a few washes, the outside layer has the kind of balled look. And the drawstring is mangled. The elastic still has full strech but the default position is tiny. Still fits fine, but pulling them out, it looks like it's for one leg.<br />These are cheaper than other ones, you get what you pay for, I'd say I got my money's worth out of them, but next time I'll go for more expensive ones and hope they hold up to more use."
2.0,Sleeves are more transparent than they appear in the photo. Has a very silky liner in it. The crossing detail on the front is much more subtle than it appears. I have a 31 inch waist and 37 inch hips and this was not very flattering on me.
2.0,I bought this for my 6 year old. It is too heavy and fits akward. Waste of money
2.0,I order one for my son who normally wears a large. He wanted it to be way baggy on him. So we got a 2x. It was so tight and didn't fit! Unfortunately I can't recommend them. Unless your a tiny person.
2.0,Originally I gave these a five star review because they were cute and matched the pictures. However the 'gems' fell out within two months. The outer edges (the 'holder pieces') turned a greenish color and just looked gross. Definitely not good quality.
2.0,In love with these pants but they fit my 9 year old niece. Not ment for woman with curves. Gotta be straight hip to wear these.
2.0,"Much smaller than I expected, would be happy to pay more for a larger size !"
2.0,Fit snug
2.0,"Good quality, decent design, but runs very small. Ordered medium for 5’9 175 lbs, and much smaller than expected."
2.0,"This was cute and my stepdaughter loved it, however the second time she wore it, the clasp broke on it."
2.0,Definitely go a size lower. Not a good look on me personally. It was to big ordered size medium. Not as flattering as in the picture. Maybe if I get a smaller size.
2.0,"This bracelet is way too bulky, even for a man. I bought it for my grandson and decided not to give it to him."
2.0,"I took them out of the wrapping and the first thing I saw was that you sent the wrong size (20/22). That was fine be cause I had seen that they sometimes run small. Then I noticed they were sheer, as in can see everything sheer. I put them on and let me tell you something the people who made these tight must not have an ass cause it sure didn't fit mine. I decided to have my mother try them on cause shes a 14 and they didn't go over her ass either, with both of us the legs were fine its from the crotch to the waist (or wherever it was SUPPOSED to go). So I'm going to make them into leg warmers or something I haven't decided as of yet."
2.0,"There is no way this bathing suit is cute for a normal person. The torso is super short and the breast pads are in the belly button area. I am 5'4 and 150 with an athletic build, I bought a large but I can say it's snug. The boob area is loose, but that be just my problem ;).  I wouldn't recommend it....unless you have low hanging boobs and absolutely zero torso."
2.0,"These are darling, but I have a narrow bridge and the nose piece is very wide. They just slid down my nose."
2.0,"The giant, shiny silver snaps and western stitching gave this a cowboy costume look. Fabric was thin. I returned it."
2.0,"Too small, poor quality... but the idea was cute."
2.0,So freakin cute but way to freakin small it's like a medium
2.0,Ordered a med and 2 inches smaller than other size med workout tops.
2.0,Runs small... order size xL fits like a medium. And not really good quality fabric. :(
2.0,"The leather--if it was indeed leather--on this product was VERY thin... and I must say, it smelled more of chemicals than cows, to me... Not stamped claiming ""genuine leather,"" and no embossed brand name whatsoever. This wallet appears to me as a substandard quality item which nobody is even willing to put their name on. Not a good sign, at all. I ended up purchasing this wallet-- https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07S17X811/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Less expensive, and actually smells of leather! That's where I'd recommend you go."
2.0,The dress is super cute but runs smaller than I expected.<br />Return process wasn’t easy.
2.0,"Nice shoes, look super cute. However they are extremely small for their size, especially in the width."
2.0,"These earrings were much more bigger than what it looked on the product description page. The earring top and the triangle drop below are attached such that they are not very comfortable on my ears, therefore I won’t be able to wear it often and of not much utility to me."
2.0,"It's okay, but the material is heavier than the other nighties I bought similar in design. Pockets are not comfortable for hands in comparison to ""Dropeon Women's Best Wife in The Galaxy Long Sleeve Oversize Baggy Dresses with Pockets"". Mistakenly bought this one. This one, not my favorite. Go with Dropeon."
2.0,I'm 5' 2&#34; and 120 lbs. Material is too thin and tight for my size and liking.
2.0,Wasn’t good for my body type. The neck line looked a little weird. Might be cute on other body types though!
2.0,This is a cute dress but the shoulder line didn’t lay correctly.  Sadly  Had to return - but two stars for cuteness.
2.0,Were made small. Looked more like sun glasses that a child would wear.
2.0,The fabric feels like cheap unpleasant polyester.
2.0,Returned it!  Looks cheap!
2.0,"I was looking for something to help me with my posture. Having arthritis in my spine, with a slight curvature, I needed something to help me stand correctly.  This didn't meet my needs."
2.0,Cheaper and smaller than expected.  Bought them as stocking stuffers for my mom.  Not as cute as other cheap costume jewelry that I've purchased for her in the past.  The size is the most disappointing thing.
2.0,Not what I expected! Looks cheap.
2.0,"Comfortable, but I bought these for the zippers, which failed after ~2 weeks."
2.0,Bought this for my niece for Christmas. This would have been cute but the colors are way off. The red images were supposed to be pink just like the inside lining. So aesthetically it's not nearly as pleasing as the stock photo. I'll probably end up keeping it but pretty disappointed.
2.0,Looks super cute in the pics but way too small. Not even close to being true to size.
2.0,"This band just does not fit me at all. You can only resize by adding or removing links, there is no fine adjustment. If I add a link, the watch flops around on my wrist, making the heart rate sensor of my S3 useless. If I take out a link, it's extremely tight and digs into my skin. I expected there to be a small adjustment in the clasp like other metal bands I've had.<br /><br />Speaking of the clasp, it's a pretty poor design. Edges are sharp and irritating, and it's bent at an angle that's supposed to follow the curve of your wrist, but in my case, just causes the sharp hinges to dig into my skin.<br /><br />Also, the whole band in general just has poor fit and finish. A lot of the holes the connecting pins go through are not cleaned after drilling, burrs stop pins from going back in, and in at least one of the links, completely prevents you removing it because the burr extends into the ceramic piece.<br /><br />At least the ceramic parts do actually appear to be ceramic. I wasn't able to scratch them with any tool I had.<br /><br />Overall, it looks okay on my S3. I got the silver stainless band with black ceramic beads, which doesn't appear be available anymore, instead they have black stainless with white ceramic, which makes so much more sense for the S3. Gonna return this one and try a different band that is hopefully actually comfortable."
2.0,"First of all I'm a size 12.  I ordered a 12.  I can barely get it past my thighs and I'm not that big.  It is NOT an elastic waist as pictured.  It's a zipper, which makes it harder to fit if you gain or lose a few pounds."
2.0,Looks good but is not adjustable or is just really hard to adjust.
2.0,I did not expect the charm to be a stick-on. It did not look that way in the picture. I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,Need more depth
2.0,the neck straps are swan unevenly. they looked crooked when i had the shirt on. the rest of the shirt was fine but the neck straps made it look bad. i wouldn't buy this again.
2.0,"Cute, but broke after only a week.  I contacted the seller and was told essentially &#34;too bad&#34;"
2.0,"Wasn't the hats I really wanted, however they work just fine."
2.0,Not so comfortable and fit.
2.0,"Even though it is a well-made garment and I love the color, it is way Too short waisted!  I will be returning this dress!"
2.0,"Yeah don’t buy cheap things lol. I don’t have much nice to say honestly, I like the color."
2.0,"First reviewer is correct, lettering on mask starts too low- just looking at this you can see ""Spaceballs"" will start underneath the nose, cover the mouth, and ""the face mask"" will end up on the curved part under the chin, becoming unreadable.  plus what's with all the choices, just make four that look faithful to the original concept (letters in style of the on-screen movie title, or from the promotional posters), and be done with it. all of these other choices are superfluous.  Price is decent, but until it is a better design, I won't be buying one. ☹<br />  The ""SPACEBALLS"" marquee text should be at the top of the mask, where it will ride the bridge of the nose.  I don't have to buy one to see this; it's clear from the (many many) images."
2.0,I ordered a large however when I tried the vest on it fit like a small. I’m 5’9” @ 185lbs and I barely could zip the vest together in front. Needless to say I don’t wear and didn’t think it was worth the time shipping back.
2.0,I got these because they had great reviews but this basically is just a thin fabric. They won’t stay up on your face unless you put on top of your head. I gave them out to family and friends and we all had the same experience
2.0,Way too big. Returned them without and problem from seller.
2.0,Too polyester feeling- wish there was more of a cotton feel
2.0,"I love the shirt but it came with a letter on the bottom missing.. It says "" he book of us"" instead of the book of us ..so I had to spend more money and order another one because it was a Valentine's day gift which will now be late."
2.0,Not the same colors or design as the picture. Ended up giving it to my daughter and she loves it.
2.0,It's ok. It doesn't look nearly as cute as the picture. The material is very thin polyester.
2.0,"I was very hopeful with these they fit for the most part but if you are 5feet like me or shorter I would recommend a different pair because the top part was way to high, it just about touched my bra. I wanted high waist not extremely high chested. Kind of bummed since the color was so pretty"
2.0,I was so excited to have this dress but unfortunately it doesn't resemble the picture. I had to send it back. The split is not defined as expected. It looked like one long dress on me. You will have to force your leg out to get the look of the picture. I purchased a large and it ran pretty big. I would advise a smaller size.
2.0,We returned because my daughter who loves her makes could not stand having these on her face and neck
2.0,Nice coverup only very upset that once on the colors don’t match up on both sides making it look very cheap and poorly made
2.0,"The tee-shirt is made of extremely thin cotton - the kind that stretches out of shape after an hour of wearing and looks pretty sloppy.  It's fine for going to the gym, but nothing more."
2.0,Bought this as a gift for my mothers birthday. She said it was very cute PJ set but it definitely wasn't a 2XL size. She passed to her sister who is smaller than herself. It didnt fit my Aunt either. My Aunt is passing it to her 16 yr old Granddaughter.
2.0,Picture doesn't show true size
2.0,Had to give to my sister because it was too small :(
2.0,I strongly dislike these shorts for many reasons. 1 being that they need to iron. I also hate the material. The fit is fine but I don't like the way they look or feel. Why do they make shorts that need to be ironed?!
2.0,I did not like that I couldn’t wear this into a pool more than two times without the color fading from crucial areas. Making it appear as if the suit had become transparent
2.0,Before I ordered I read a review that EU 41 is like an American 10. Well maybe an American 10 year old boy. These are tiny!!! - the shoe clearly states US 7.6. Geez. Come on man.
2.0,"I ordered one size larger than recommended based on my height, and this onesie was still too small, both in width AND in height!<br />The front buttons are poorly fasten and there are gaps in the front so you can see everything underneath the onesie.<br />The material is soft, but I can never wear this.  Maybe my tiny cousin who wears a size 4 and is only 5 ft tall can wear this!"
2.0,"It looks orange. Look I know it’s not real, I get it but it looks terrible. I love the style and ability to fit it to my wrist but if it looked more yes low than orange I would keep it"
2.0,The bag has a very strong smell. I put it on balcony for for more than a week and it still has it. I regret that I bought it.  And this seller bombards me with E-mails to ask for Reviews. And
2.0,These were so pretty and silver when I bought them but now (4 months later) they are tarnished and yellow.<br />Yuck
2.0,"looks nice in picture, normal size is large, ordered an xxl and it was like a medium .  WAY TOO small !"
2.0,"Poor quality of chains, but designs were cute."
2.0,Too heavy for the ears. Diamonds tend to fall down instead of sit up correctly due too the heaviness.
2.0,"This tutu has a tiny waist. I am about a size 6/8 and it was way too uncomfortable for me. I'm no professional ballerina, just needed it for a costume."
2.0,Pretty one of the stones was missing though.
2.0,Tried 3 different sizes - all fit same in chest just longer & fuller at bottom of dress<br /><br />Shame - loved the pattern
2.0,Have to get it wet and stretch it out so I can wear it
2.0,"With this made-in-China sandal, &#34;unisex&#34; means they're for men, not for women - unless you're a woman with abnormally wide feet, as in elephantine. Also, as I found out, size 44 is not a women's 9.5, but it is accurate for men. To sum up, don't buy these unless you're a man. Also, when you open the bag, be prepared for a horribly toxic smell. Ait them out for a few days, well away from humans and pets. Yes, they're cheap, I'll give them two stars for that."
2.0,Fit was good and shirt was nice but it definitely was not white. It was a cream or beige.
2.0,Wish it would fit properly now it’s a dust item
2.0,It is warm and comfy but not form fitting at all it just kind of flops around; you might as well wear a robe. Also there is no buttons or zipper.
2.0,"It’s really a mans watch. Some what difficult to set. Directions are not the best regarding how to set the watch. I got it for my blind mother, voice is ok, just difficult to set."
2.0,It was ok.  I didn't care for the fabric.
2.0,"The dress is nice, ended up giving to my granddaughter who is a kids 16.  She wore it and it looked great."
2.0,"It's too shockingly red, and the cuff is too deep. Looks &#34;cheap,&#34; which it was …  : )"
2.0,"WAY TOO SMALL!  Made in China, they don't make plus sizes, evidently"
2.0,"Looks cheap. The fabric is thin, the green color is faded, more like sage than Army. I know the description says &#34;stretch,&#34;  however, I think it's a bit too much stretch for Men's jeans. They're more like cheap jeggings. Size Small fits like a M/L. Will be returning."
2.0,Too expensive for the quality.
2.0,"I'm about 5'10"", 135 lbs, C cup, and this dress fits me very poorly. It's about 3 inches too short and comes above my ankles when I'm not even wearing shoes, so there goes any chance of wearing it with strappy heels. And the waist and chest fit super weird. The waist seem of the dress sits too high for it to hug the curve of my actual waist, but too low for it to be considered an ""empire waist"" style dress. And the cut on the chest is super high so it's not super flattering, even if you adjust the straps to make it longer/lower. It makes you look kind of boxy in the upper part of your body and does nothing for any curves you might have. It's too bad because if I were to size up to get more length, it would get way looser than it already is and it's pretty much unwearable as is. The material is nice and the print looks just like the picture, so I may still try to adjust the top and just hem it to be a short dress or take off the top altogether and try to make it a skirt, but it's not worth the money I paid to have to do that many alterations to it. Unless you're savy with a sewing machine or short and very busty, I wouldn't recommend this dress."
2.0,The bra is very comfortable but it does not provide enough support. I usually wear bralettes and bra styles without any underwire to make a comfortable fit for me. This bra rides up and my breasts fall out of it so it doesn’t give me the fit or support I need from a bra.
2.0,These sunglasses look good in the picture but the are not as good as they look. They are light and comfortable but the lenses are a dust magnet. The thing that bothers the most is the fact that distort vision in a manner that is you look down while wearing them you lose sense of real distance. It's like using glasses with the wrong prescription.
2.0,No proper grip.... dishes slip off from the hands. May be good for bathroom cleaning but not advisable for dish cleaning.
2.0,Dress fit was ok.. the material smelled of chemicals and was very cheap... you get what you pay for...
2.0,"The metal key ring has zero clearance and would rub against my expensive key fob causing scratches on the top, closest the the chain. I endedbup adding a piece of metalized film over the top of my key fob to minimize the contact. Not a good design."
2.0,I should’ve read the description before purchasing.. I absolutely detest polyester! PERIODT.. it’s poor quality
2.0,Pretty disappointed. The tank is a very cheap tank that someone just took scissors to cut off the neck line and sewed the lacy part on part way.
2.0,"I’m a 32 DD and typically wear a 8-10 on the bottom so i purchased a large. I’ll be sending it back because the tops straps were way too long and it was really big around the bust but there’s hardly any cup and it’s just not wearable. I took one look at the bottoms and knew they wouldn’t fit. They look more like a 4. Anyways, not true to size. I’m 145 / 5”3"
2.0,The scarf is very elegant.  Loved it.  However after the first wash you cannot get wrinkles out of the Chiffon.  So I would not order again in this material.
2.0,Liked this dress and I hoped it would fit but it’s too big. Had to return. Don’t like going through the extra steps but it was easy to return
2.0,It's more plastic like than I'd hoped and whatever the 'nylon' is wrapped around is not very durable.<br /><br />It was nice to have it personalized. I might take that little bit of metal and put it on a strap that won't snap or melt or dissolve in water.
2.0,"I ordered a bigger size according to the &#34;size chart&#34; but it was still to small and I read and took in consideration your Asian sizes, you need to pay better attention to American sizes If your looking to sell your products here in the U.S. I will be gifting the jacket to a family member."
2.0,"the plug is not easily inserted with peace in the shoes , so hard to plug it"
2.0,Waistband shredded on first wash
2.0,Very thin fabric removable pads . Poor fit
2.0,This is not a leather thing.
2.0,The color isn't true to what was described.
2.0,It broke a month later on it own
2.0,"Ring is very cheap and not as pictured. Band is very thin and bends quite easy. The stone appear to be coated in some type of plastic. The ring does not appear to be even close to what is advertised. Feel like we got ripped off. It also does not have the .925 for sterling silver, just the word Philippines. Would not have bought this ring if know that made in Philippines."
2.0,"The case was shipped fast, and came nicely in the package. Although, I didn't like the fit on the phone. It was difficult to make it click tight, and the buttons were too hard to press on the sides and you had to press hard on the screen. I stopped using it after about a week until I got a new case."
2.0,"The mask was very sturdy and good quality, but it came warped and doesn’t bend to your face at all. Also has a slight smell to it."
2.0,"The necklace was cute, but it fell apart the first day I wore it."
2.0,"I bought this to retain some extra 1"" webbing on my backpack.  Logically I bought the 1"" clip (for the 1"" webbing), but the clips are to small; you can only get webbing into one half of the clip.  Clip isn't wide enough for the other portion of the webbing to fit.  Looks like I'm going to have to do some cutting."
2.0,"Although its a nice looking belt, it sucks! The belt does not hold onto the belt when buckled and ratcheted, contstantly releases the belt and doesnt lock it or keep it locked! If they made the teeth on the rotating locking rod longer, then it would probably hold the belt in them, instead of them coming loose like they do and letting the belt slip!"
2.0,"Two star for material (its soft and fuzzy), how fast it arrrived."
2.0,"They're cute, but really not comfy. Zero support for the foot sole. Not a practical slipper."
2.0,The  silver (lock/latch) broke when tigting the  watch.....
2.0,"I believe that this could be a great company, the person who emailed me was very nice but I got my pants today 10/21/19 and there’s a HUGE hole where the crotch/thigh area is."
2.0,nice material...but runs far smaller than a 5X
2.0,It's ok. Not as trendy as it looks in the picture
2.0,"We will be returning this product because the velcro at the bottom once it is un done snags all of the surrounding material. My daughter is 160cm tall and there was so much excess at the bottom she tripped trying to walk in the costume. I think this product should be advertised as a novelty item for pictures only, not functional."
2.0,"I was most disappointed with the fact that these jeans were not high waisted like the description says. They hit pretty much right at my hips or maybe slightly above. Upon pulling the jeans up for the first time, two of the belt loops ripped, and a piece of loose thread from the inside of the jeans wrapped around one of my toes and pulled a snag through the whole length of the side of one pant leg. I have a pretty curvy shape so the fit was also weird. Maybe I just have bad luck, but would not recommend for curvy girls, or anyone looking for an actual high waisted pant."
2.0,The strap broke the second time trying it on......
2.0,I did not like this product very itchy
2.0,"The rose gold on the face picks up so much glare it's almost impossible to read. The size, shape and band were very good. But again, there is so much going on on the face of this watch it just isn't functional.  I just purchased another watch I simply could not read this one."
2.0,"I purchased a plumeria anklet in silver from a local vendor and since they do not carry a matching bracelet, I ordered this one hoping that it would be a good match for the anklet that I have. The price was comparable and the picture online seemed close enough. However, the delivered product is much too shiny and 'cheap' looking. I will upload a photo as soon as I am able.<br /><br />NOTE: This particular bracelet may be enjoyed by others, it just did not meet my needs."
2.0,Looks better in the picture than in real life. Bought it as a gift 8 months ago and the recipient has not worn it once
2.0,They look great but the gem separated from the earring as soon as I removed it from the package. I ended up supergluing the gem back in. The earrings are fun to wear and exactly what I wanted but definitely cheap.
2.0,I suppose it is possible that this belt is leather. If so it has to be the most inferior leather there is.  I will be returning this item.
2.0,Bello el modelo y el color. pero la talla parece correr pequeña.
2.0,"I like the size,  chea quality"
2.0,The dent in the shoes will not straighten out.. Not cute if your giving as a gift. They look used.
2.0,"For me ordinary wide size 9 dress shoes fit (athletic styles in Keen or Merrell require size 10), not these.  These were tight across the ball of the foot area.  They had plenty of room for an insert, but that did not help the fit.  Also, they felt stiff like plastic when walking around, made me think of some of the cheap shoes I have bought over the years.  So, depending on your foot contours, these might be for you."
2.0,very pretty but the second time I wore it it broke. I had on sandals and shorts so nothing was rubbing up against it. very bummed as it was super cute but chain broke too quickly
2.0,Necklace broke on the first day I wore it. I loved it until that happened. Breaks very easily at the metal portion of the necklace and will not stay if you try to put it back together.
2.0,"Well... It fits, but fits very weird. Like it's supposed to be low rider or something.<br />The material feels like twill or something, so there's no flexibility whatsoever.<br /><br />Also, the cargo pockets are ridiculous. I never thought I'd run into pockets that are too big, but these are. Anything I put in there rolls around any time I move, rattling or smacking my leg."
2.0,"Very disappointed in the appearance of this watch.  In addition, it doesn't have a good closing mechanism, leaving the watch dangling on my wrist ready to fall off.  Would not recommend."
2.0,"It looks nice, but was too big. Also the top was very stiff and wouldn't bend to cover my boobs. The boobs look like two snow cone!!"
2.0,"Hem unraveled after 3 washing and just outside return window.<br />Contacted company (subsidiary of bushnell) and was informed to ship the new product back at my expense.<br /><br />Received a supposed replacement a few weeks later.<br /><br />To my surprise, the replacement shirt  was not the same type, color or size!<br /><br />The replacement shirt was xl, however it was like I tried to wear a ten foot tarp for a shirt.<br /><br />Definitely disappointed and cannot reccomended."
2.0,The stones had fallen out when I opened the box was not happy
2.0,"This arrived in a wrinkled mess. I had to wash it in order to just see it as it should be. And even in cold water air-dried, it seems to have shrunk. I was buying it for a costume for my granddaughter. Still, I expected better."
2.0,Sending back large is way to small if u have any tits had white dust all over
2.0,"Belt tore and broke within 2 months. Great price and look, but not durable at all."
2.0,I returned this dress because it fit me way too big. I ordered a medium and it was too big on me. I am 5’2” 140 lbs and the dress made me look old. Not flattering at all. The dress also came damaged. It looked used because the tag wasn’t even attached to the dress.
2.0,I’m 5’9 and 170 lbs bought a large but after one wear and wash without a putting it in the dryer and it ripped through the seams. Too bad because I loved the shirt.
2.0,not original and made n china
2.0,Very see through and not very high quality material
2.0,"It’s waaaaay too long, and I’m tall (5ft 9in)"
2.0,These masks cause my glasses to fog up just like other masks. Only reason I’m keeping them is because I need new masks.
2.0,Super light weight.  I returned them
2.0,I bought it for vacation and it broke in day one. Strap snapped.
2.0,"I would LOVE for someone to contact me with ACE Socks.  I bought two pairs of their socks in a store in Old Town Scottsdale, AZ a week ago and they are too small.<br /><br />I am a size 12 and I almost feel like I bought two pairs of ankle socks.<br /><br />The designs on the socks are beautiful, but they need about two to four more inches of socks for my size of foot.<br /><br />Feel free to contact me if you are with Ace socks company."
2.0,Very poor quality glasses
2.0,Dress fits as expected. Fabric is very thin. I wear with a black camisole underneath. Decent value for the price.
2.0,No me gustó que había comprado esa misma medida dos meses antes y me quedo perfecta y luego cuando las compré nuevamente vinieron más anchas y eran el mismo size.
2.0,Didn’t like these. Very cheap
2.0,"It's pretty, but it was made of cheap quality. The material started to rust, but I would recommend if you do buy it to paint a coat of clear nail polish/top coat to seal it. I didn't do that and I think if I did, it would've lasted longer. Shipping was late"
2.0,"The picture is a little deceptive. First, the ribbon on the T-shirt is not as dark as it looks. The T-shirt I received, has a very muted pink that really blends in with the pink of the T-shirt actually. Also, this is a very thin, basic T-shirt. It is not tied in a knot and the sleeves are not rolled as shown in the picture, but perhaps you can do it yourself if you order a size or two bigger. This is a very basic Guardian brand T-shirt that they sell at Walmart, and the ribbon is an iron on. I am pretty sure the first time I wash this, that ribbon is going to disappear. Not very good quality at all And it looks like I made it at home."
2.0,Ordered these to replace some I bought somewhere else and broke. They just weren’t what I wanted so I returned them. I thought the blue would be more mirrored and they’re definitely not they’re just blue tinted lenses.
2.0,the glass was broken
2.0,"I purchased a size larger on the chart and I still couldn't get it on, ended up returning but it was very cute, wish it fit."
2.0,Like the wallet but it smells awful.  And it has something sticky on it. Will give it another day lay out open. Thinking of returning it. May 2016-Amazon sent me new wallet. So much better. This one has no smell and was ready to use right away. Also sent me a rdif credit card holder to test. Love it.  Has just enough slots for everything and fits nicely in a small purse. Thank you Amazon for the new wallet.
2.0,The sleeves and body length are good but the body is very tight.
2.0,This belly button ring is much larger than I expected.  It's about the size of a half dollar.  I gave it to a friend.
2.0,"I pictured this jumpsuit as a comfortable travel outfit or for a more polished alternative to workout clothes when running errands, but the reality is more awkward pajamas. For reference, I am 5'9"", 143 lbs, 36B with a long torso. I usually wear size 4-6 or small in jumpsuits and dresses. I ordered the size small, and found it too large in the top part with the waist hitting too high. That may be from my long torso, but it looked very awkward on me. I passed it on to my 20 year-old daughter who is 5'8"", 125 lbs, 34B and usually wears a 0-2 or XS in dresses and jumpsuits. It didn't look any better on her. The waist was too high, the crotch was too low, the armholes too wide and just not cute. It was hard for both of us to put on because there is no zipper so you have to step into the neckline and then pull it up. On the plus side, it's very soft and comfortable. My daughter said she would wear it if it was two separate pieces."
2.0,Way too small I ordered an xxl and it fits like and xs
2.0,two of the rings are not the right colors and if you bend them to much when you are sizing the the thin part breaks
2.0,Necklace missing from package.
2.0,Fits small and I do not have a big head.
2.0,"These say they are polarized, but the sunlight coming through these is terrible."
2.0,My children only like the animal hats (hatimals?) with the paw pads printed or rubber sewn on the hand mitt parts.  It's a chore to find pictures that show the paws because many sellers will attempt to hide the lower quality item by facing paws down in the pictures.  The item received is not as shown.  The paws are plain white.  I kept the item anyway to give away as a christmas gift.  Item quality is otherwise comparable to other hatimals out there.<br /><br />Edit- Picture has been updated to show the lack of paws.  Item is as shown
2.0,Zippers are of low quality compared to the rest of the outer bag material. Outer shell is tough and nice enough but the inner lining tore after 2 weeks of use.  Had I not added a few patches to the outside I would be returning it. The side pockets are NOT big enough for a pair of shoes.
2.0,I bought these to use as a nose ring and they looked very fake. They were also painful to wear. I ended up returning them.
2.0,Loved these at first but the jewel becomes clear as the silver paint rubs off the back of the jewel. Super sad-they were so pretty at first
2.0,I can buy a better quality product from walmart. It tore right away in 2 spots.
2.0,"The zipper split before I could wear it. Fixed it, but sucks when in a hurry!!"
2.0,Eh I wouldn't buy again. Chinese ... sizes are different.
2.0,"I wanted love these pantyhose bc they are eco-conscious and seemed beautiful in photos, but the control top had a weird connection to the rest of the pantyhose -- like a hard line that digs into your body right where you want them to have a smoothing effect.  The fibre was less than consistent in the weave. I waited a while to wear them bc I rarely wear pantyhose except for special events. So I was pretty annoyed. I had to root out an old pair of tights from my drawer to wear.  And now its too late to return the two pair of Swedish Stockings pantyhose I ordered."
2.0,There two different sizes quite small
2.0,"What a shame these earrings are so beautiful. However, they're so fragile. See pictures attached to this review, because as I was threading the earring, which you're supposed to be able to do it is a threader earring, the post fell right off and the earring drop to the ground. Now it's broken and I can't do anything with it. It's not even fixable hey I'm so upset and disappointed about this. And I can't even return it because when I try to it says there's no return policy which is something I didn't check before I bought it so possibly my fault but still upsetting. If it were a little more sturdier I would have gave it a five star rating because they really are beautiful."
2.0,"Love the blouse, but size runs small.  I gave it to my daughter."
2.0,"The idea of the joggers are cute, however sizing doesn't compromise of U.S. standard. they're to small and the material isn't substantial. I would have loved to wear them but sadly they're being returned."
2.0,"Long sleeves, ran too small to fit."
2.0,"These socks were cute, but, they were too short. They did not come up high enough on my legs and were uncomfortable around the toes. I am 5'9&#34;, I am a nurse and after wearing them for one shift I am never wearing them again."
2.0,"There is a stone missing near the large stone. You can see a dark spot in the middle- that is where it is missing. I know I'm not spending a ton of money, but I at lease expect them to be spent with all the stones."
2.0,The pattern on this chain is approx 25 in.  The TOTAL chain length is NOT the length that matters.  This was totally not clear from the description.  I had to return it.  It also looks very cheap.
2.0,too short and fits very small. size not accurate.
2.0,Even thought I like the style. I would rather pay more for a nicer quality purse. Done with the cheapies.
2.0,I wear either a 2xl or 3xl depending on cut. Ordered a 3xl and it was smaller than some of my 2xl shirts. Arms and shoulders are fine but body is tight and length is short. Second item I purchased from the Guinness store that had this problem. I wonder who is doing their sizing for them. Also quality of material was thin for cost of shirt.
2.0,Returned.  The arms are too thin and the seam between the sleeve and bodice is very flimsy
2.0,Too tight and can't wer it
2.0,Flag looked like an iron on
2.0,The shirt was just blah… it was a soft material… the back of it had stains… very disappointing
2.0,":( I was so excited for these, I really was. I immediately sterilized and put the black set in and not even 24 hours later my face started to swell break out in hives, and my left eye swelled up so bad I couldn’t see out of it. I am now recovering from an allergic reaction from these. If you aren’t sensitive to metal I would say these are perfect. But if you’re sensitive please steer clear. I gave it 2 stars for quality and looks."
2.0,Good vision.  Very uncomfortable for large face
2.0,"Ultimately, I wish I hadn't bought it.  Great idea, quality pompom & knit hat.  Love the soft lining.  However, it's TOO SMALL (stretched it a bit on a soccer ball!)  Doesn't charge with the provided charger.  When it magically does charge, it lasts less than 2 hours.  Great idea, terrible quality control."
2.0,"Fits about 2 sizes too small, very thin fabric."
2.0,"Followed the sizing according to reviews and chart. Not at all flattering. Bust area is completely see through, unlike the picture. Straps don't stay attached so be prepared for a public flashing. Slip under the skirt is way too short"
2.0,The hats have a big dent in the top middle right above the logo that makes it look like a have a horn on my head. I’m returning the hats.
2.0,"My daughter likes it but the pedometer is not accurate, the band broke pretty quickly, and for some reason the alarm goes off even if the the watch is powered off and repeats until you make it stop. It’s ridiculous"
2.0,The color material that's on the jacket attends to peel of. The way they sewing the color designs are now falling off the jacket. This material wont last long on the jacket once cleaned. SO not a good overall long term item.
2.0,"This was a mess.<br />1st you weren't able to select a size. Weird. A bold move when there are so many different sizes of boobs.<br />Next whoever designed this (I don't think) doesn't understand the physics of a woman. The waist was too big but the breast cups were so small it was embarrassing.<br />Also. The panties. Just practically a few rubber bands. But the rubber band that comes up the butt crack actually wraps around the waist rubber band and slides from side to side. I don't know why they didn't just sew it into a stationary place, like, I don't know, maybe THE MIDDLE?<br />I actually got dressed in this right in front of my husband. We actually had a great laugh.<br />The reason I gave it 2 Stars is because, 1 it was so comical. And 2, the price. If you magically fit in this, I would definitely buy it. It's better than nothing.<br />I was asked before I was writing a review if this was too big or too small or fit as expected. They need an option that says &#34;was such a mess&#34;. I actually sat there and looked at my choices for the longest time. I selected too small. But other areas were too big, yet some we're okay.<br />I think if they were to make the breast cups stretchy, this would be a lot better. Tons better.<br />* I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review."
2.0,When I got it the glitter was already half off of the hearts. Then it frayed by the 2nd hour. I didn’t have anything rubbing against it??? I didn’t see that it said single use…
2.0,The lenses are not distinct. Very blurry.<br />I would not buy them again.
2.0,"Not an actual hat, at least not for an adult. I'm using it as a decoration. I am disappointed, though. I'm teaching virtually, and I'm trying to keep my students attention by wearing silly things each day."
2.0,The material just felt really cheap....the picture is much better than the actual product
2.0,"It is only hold a Gallon of milk and couple of small items , pic is not showing accurate image"
2.0,"Although the overall design was nice, my pair arrived looking as though  they had been used and returned. They had scratches all over the lenses. These were cheaply made as well.  You get what you pay for."
2.0,I really wanted to like these. I was hoping they would be my new go to lounge pants but sadly they didn't work.  I ordered a L ( i run between a 12/14) but these fit more like a small or med.<br />i like the style but that's about it.  If you are ordering them order 2 sizes up.
2.0,The capacity was good pockets and everything. What i dont like about it are the shoulder straps. They are really short and barely rest on your shoulder so the non padded part digs into you. But not bad for a day pack or short hike if you're going for a long time it gets uncomfortable
2.0,"I went a size up and got the xxl and it fit. My booty looks great in them.  Only issue is they fit great on my bottom  half but the waist area is a bit too large so i have to really tie the string. They are like a stretchy spandex material,  but not see through.<br />Edit. It's been about 2 months and they're ripping on the thighs and the right pocket is ripped. Gotta toss em now."
2.0,"I was excited to get this watch as I thought it would be great for summer.  It looked pretty and was thinking of it even to give as gifts  Two problems the first is I have a very small wrist and my husband tried to remove a link but was unable to, so he brought it to a jeweler who wanted ten dollars to take off the links.  Definitely not worth that when the entire watch did not cost that much.<br />Secondly, if you have any ideas about giving it as a gift it comes in a brown cardboard box and looks like you might of gotten it at a flea market making it look cheap so not something you would want to give as a present."
2.0,"I'm 124 pounds I order the first time a medium size and it was very small then I ordered again on size xxL and it was the same size.. to me they sell the same size no matter if you order S, M,L, or XXL... be careful before order this blouse material is fine I'm in very dissatisfied with sizes."
2.0,"Pretty print, but sizing was really big. Material felt cheap also. Not a fan. Shipping cost more than dress to return, so they have me a discount to just keep it."
2.0,Cheaply made for sure-I wouldn’t recommend
2.0,extremely thin material with poor hemming.  Wrips was and is cheap
2.0,the earings looked nice and everything but when it had them one they ended up hurting my ears so i never used them since
2.0,"The gloves did not work out for me, putting them on my fingernail went right through the glove.  First time that has ever happened and I have been wearing gloves for a long time."
2.0,Had to return as they were so small.
2.0,I ordered six black socks and received six white socks.  The package label clearly says black on it but that's not what was inside.  Disappointing.
2.0,I’m usually a small i got a Medium and it fits like a large!!
2.0,Tight.. wear a large and it’s short
2.0,"I bought this as an XL for my 11-year-old.  I took a risk because the measurements were not flat, but all the way around.  Its 20.4 inches laying flat from armpit to armpit, and it would never fit my son.  I should have googled the weight conversion because 42 KG is 92 lbs, my son weights a little more than that.  For comparison, the average weight for 14-16 years for boys is 112-134 lbs (112 for a 14 year old 134 for a 16-year-old) So I would say this runs small.  I am bumed because my son would have loved it.  The shirt is thin but appeared to be a very nice hoodie. I just wish it would have fit. The measurements match up similarly to their size chart I just was not sure how they were measuring. I had a promo code so I didn’t pay full price."
2.0,They are very short so if you are thin and tall don’t buy these pants
2.0,"This dress is super cute/sexy on.  I wore it for the first time to brunch this past Sunday.  Unfortunately, one of the back straps that you tie the top on to keep the girls in literally came off the dress in the middle of brunch.  I only wore it for a couple of hours  :-(  Needless to say I was embarrassed and had to leave because there's no way of keeping the girls in after that happened.  I guess I could try to sew it back on but its brand new and I'm paranoid it will happen again!"
2.0,great product but the length was too short for average size male
2.0,The fabric is not daft cotton. Or as it seem in pictures. It’s rough. And I didn’t even dry it and it’s balling up a little on the top half.
2.0,Nice but run big
2.0,THE MATERIAL IS NOT WHAT I EXSPECTED. IT IS VERY POLYESTER. LOL!
2.0,"The socks are cute and my daughter loved them, but they had a hole in them within about 60 minutes of putting them on. She was attached at the point so I just put a stitch in them for now.  All in all they're pretty chintzy,and I recommend trying to find an alternative."
2.0,The fit was what I expected but the zipper fly was too short. It was difficult to tuck my shirt in.
2.0,I felt like they shrink after being washed
2.0,"These were not flattering. The stretch is too stretchy, not good."
2.0,Same as pic but shirt not made of the best polyester ...not worth the price!
2.0,Very pretty dress but too small for a large..
2.0,"On paper this dress looked amazing, in person it was very unflattering. It was too big for me and for awkwardly. I am a size 6, 5'6 125 lb"
2.0,fits too tightly and is too long for my body type. (I did order a size larger than I am and it's still too tight.)
2.0,"I loved the style of this strap and the advertised length of 56” was perfect as I usually wear my guitar slug fairly low. Sadly, this strap is nowhere near 56” and end up being only about 49” when fully extended. It simply doesn’t work for me and it sucks because the strap looks great."
2.0,"I really love the print on this dress, however, the cut is very slim.  It's very fitted and tight in the tummy. I would definitely size up one in this. The length is great and hits above the knee (I'm 5'8"")."
2.0,When I order this product I didn’t know what to expect since there were not very many reviews. I was hoping that this would be a puffier vest. The quality of the best was not very good & the material was not as expected and it was so thin and way to light.
2.0,"Not mid rise, not as pictured. More like mom<br />Jeans with an odd shape back side and long crotch. Almost have one star"
2.0,Love this color but the dress is see through and the fit is a little odd almost like the dress wasnt sewn together correctly.
2.0,The material is rough and scratchy not soft at all I really did not like these tank tops. Although they fit fine. True to size.
2.0,Smaller that the image like
2.0,"I received this watch winder as a gift last year...Recently I noticed that the winder had stopped rotating.  I tried to get in contact with Critiron through email (there is no customer service phone number listed).  After two attempts, I contacted Amazon directly and was able to send it back to them.  Amazon Customer Service is awesome, Critiron...not so much!"
2.0,I was unhappy with the purchase. The manufacturer has offered to refund my. I will post a reply as soon as I can verify.
2.0,These things are big and they puker in the lower stomach area giving the impression of a fupa.  I use them as yard pants.  They fit loose when washed and even bigger as they stretch out when you put them on.  They aren’t flattering.  Wish I had chose another brand.  Sending them to my sister that’s slightly bigger than I am
2.0,"It's pretty,  but the size is smaller than ordered."
2.0,The quality of the dress was very good but I returned it because the length is not long like shown in the picture.
2.0,I liked that these shoes were light weight and I liked the look but my boy wore through the sole of these shoes in 6 months! I usually get shoes a little big so they'll last a couple years so I'm pretty irritated that they didn't hold up to an average six year old boy's normal activity. Not durable at all:( What a waste of $20+ )
2.0,leather bad
2.0,pretty but much to small.
2.0,Really Small. I thought it would be a tad bigger
2.0,Wrong size😔😔😔😔
2.0,Material is very very thin
2.0,Material was too thin .
2.0,"it’s uhhh, like leggings…"
2.0,"The shirt fit well. I machine washed it and line dried it,  the attached flower fell off after just one wash."
2.0,"I sent this bag to my cousin who lives in the Caribbean. I send things often bc the prices in her country are outrageous. She said it’s a lovely bag, but the zipper is broken. Due to her circumstances, she can’t send the bag back for an exchange. She has no other bag so she decided to use it anyway. I’m very disappointed.  I’m only giving 2 stars bc she’s happy but I’m furious that she received a gift that is not functional."
2.0,I love the comfortable easy care shoe styles of the Okabashi company.  I've been wearing the Cleo style shoe for years.  One pair gets me through a summer of heavy use and beyond. I decided to try the Paris style this summer and one of the shoes ripped through on the side within the first month or two - so from now on I'll stick to the Cleo style.  These shoes are nice to water the garden in - as if your feet get wet - it's no big deal. I find them fun to wear - love that they can be recycled - and of course the price is right!
2.0,"This shirt fits like a men's, not good quality either"
2.0,I thought the ring had so e what of a sparkle but felt like total plastic  but you can't beat the price  would totally recommend if your in a budget
2.0,"It’s so baggy, fabric is nice but it’s not cute the straps are so low and it’s just overall not cute"
2.0,"I think this would be a really attractive necklace if I could fasten it.  The fastener isn't easy enough to use for a single person.  Perhaps this would work better with someone available to fasten it.  I've tried putting a bigger loop on the end, but the fastener piece doesn't open enough to be able to get around that.  Even worst, if this necklace is dropped like I have done, the pieces simply slide off and then have to be reassembled.  Of course, this gives some flexibility on how the pieces are arranged.  I like that this necklace comes in a pretty sheer bag that's tinted red with gold roses and leaves decorations as well as gold around the opening and on the slender drawstrings.  My rating is 2 stars simply because I cannot fasten it.  I've been working with this for a few days and it simply shouldn't be this hard."
2.0,I was happy with the product when I first received it. My son loved these slippers. Not even 2 months later and the bottom of the shoe has come apart.
2.0,Pero una talla l y me envían una xl... Terrible... El vestido es muy costoso par la tela en que esta hecha
2.0,Just received this dress in blue and it's see-through even in indoor lighting.  I had planned to wear it outside on vacation but I'll have to figure out some way to cover up so I'm not on full display in the sunlight.  Disappointed.
2.0,"These earrings came early, However, the package was torn ( even the small bag inside ) and the earrings (both) were bent real bad. Even the backings didn't fit  (got 1 free ). I like them but , I can't tell if they are real Sterling Silver or not. I'll revise my opinion if I find the 925, although it is said on here that sometimes they are not marked (?) So I'll let you know."
2.0,These are cute but break very easy
2.0,I loved these pants when I first put them on.  Comfortable and great for work.  Followed the directions for washing and drying them but they shrunk.  Now they are about 2 inches shorter than they were.  I now have cropped pants.  Disappointed.
2.0,The Fabric doesn't stretch at all.
2.0,It's ok. You get what you pay. Not bad for the price.
2.0,"It’s nylon, I bought it thinking it’d be cotton. It’s shiny and snug."
2.0,"Bought these for my husband to wear with his slip-on loafers. They looked ok straight out of the package but shrank A LOT when we washed them. They looked more like they should belong to our preschooler. They did still stretch some, but they weren't great."
2.0,Looked better in the photo than in person.  It was very cheap looking and the back of the  earring would not stay on.
2.0,"I purchased these as part of a Christmas a gift for mom and the pants have no elasticity, or give in waist. They are too small and company will not allow return or give a refund. They are offering $5 as compensation but I am stuck with the pants! So not happy!"
2.0,Difficult to read and buttons are hard to use.
2.0,Circumference is smaller than expected. Does not fit on 'average' adult head.
2.0,Sadly just broke after a few weeks of daily wear. It appears one of the rings snapped. This being after the clap disconnected earlier almost immediately. It looks nice but doesn't seem built to last even if it seems that way at first. I had a sort of religious charm on it that disappeared when it broke though it broke at home so it probably isn't lost forever luckily. Wouldn't risk it.
2.0,Ran small but ok material
2.0,The pictured t-shirt looks as if the lightning bolt is shiny or glittered...IT IS NOT...REALLY DISAPOINTED!!!
2.0,"This looks stylish on and it it is light weight. Great for a beach cover up. However, the neckline was sewn crookedly off center to the left. This must have been a second and that is why it is inexpensive."
2.0,Crazy small might want to order 2 to 3 times larger than normal. But they are cute
2.0,"It is not as seen on Picture, and doesn't even have enough around for a wreath, legs hang flat. Don't have time to return it."
2.0,Very ugly hat.<br />Very flimsy.<br />Looks like it's for women.<br />Does not look like the picture.
2.0,"The ring came from china and bears little resemblance to picture in Amazon.  Get what you pay for on this item, real cheap."
2.0,"I am Danny's wife.  I purchased them thinking they would &#34;cancel out &#34; most of the noise from snoring, loud music, or a movie theater's uncomfortably loud surround sound,  They reduced the sound somewhat but not enough to label as noice-cancelling.  I would not recommend them unless they were reduced by $10.00.<br /><br />Sandi Turner<br />240-463-7984"
2.0,"Print and material were weird, had to return. Did not like on."
2.0,The shirt has a weird smell and it felt slightly humid. It is a GILDAN brand shirt as others have mentioned so its a nice soft material but the shirt I was sent is way way to big. I ordered the size I normally wear but either I was sent the wrong size or the t-shirt sizes run to large. It is possibly in mens sizing..
2.0,I got the 6-24 month size thinking it would at least last til next year and it fits perfect for my 6 month old now which means it won’t fit for long...oh well other then that the hat is fine
2.0,"The slipper is cute, good quality, just had a narrow ankle opening, my son couldn't fit it"
2.0,Button on top of hat is missing cover material
2.0,"Loved the necklace.  The actual neclace is cheap and fell apart in under a week.  The pendant on teh necklace is AWESOME.  I subequently used it and made a new necklace of better materials, and wear it today.  For the low price, the pendant is worth it, but you have to make your own necklace if you want it to last."
2.0,"The leggings fit and look good however I don't think I agree with the description of fleece lining.  I bought the fleece lined leggings expecting extra warmth and thickness but these really only have one layer, no lining."
2.0,"Too large,  not what I expected"
2.0,"Bought both the Groundies Meribel boots and Groundies Monaco sneakers in size 9.  This boot was at least 1/2"" smaller than the Monaco. I used the size chart listed, but when I received this boot I could barely even get my foot into it."
2.0,"First I will say the pants are very cute and my daughter loved how they looked. However, I ordered the size 5 and pulling out of the package I could tell they are more like a size 3T. Still let my daughter try them on in case they could possibly work, but, no way. They only came down to her shins. There is no label to know if I was sent an inaccurate size or if the company is misrepresenting its available sizes. Really too bad because it would be so easy to get her to wear these nice pants. FYI, they are lined and have elastic cuffs, so use in really hot weather would cause overheating."
2.0,"These look okay from far away, but up close they really look like plastic. Also, the hooks are really thick - so thick that I couldn't get them through my earlobes without significant pain."
2.0,The clasp broke on the necklace the first time my friend put it on.
2.0,"These no-show lace socks look very nice, but they kept slipping off during the day when I wore them with flats."
2.0,Not  sized properly
2.0,"Bought as a gift and was too small for her. Not sure whether this is a juniors or misses size....used sizing chart but still too tight in the arms. Cute style, just not right for gift receiver."
2.0,sent back. It was too large.
2.0,"the corset part is cute, and it pulls your girls together nicely for a cleavage look. If you have a small, skinny build or pre-teen body this bra should work for you, but if you're an average body type/curvy woman it's probably not going to work.<br /><br />I wear small/medium tops, I'm 5'2 and 133lbs and a small 34B, so I ordered a 34B and it was not very flattering. The band was too tight (but at least they provide a bra extender), the straps are short and worst of all the cups weren't wide enough so my side boobs popped out like a muffin top...It felt like I tried on a pre-teen bra."
2.0,"This is nothing like the photo. First of all, it’s not a nice navy blue, it’s an ugly bright blue color that reminds me of medical scrubs. Then it has Ugly white plastic buttons, and the neckline does not lay nicely when any of the buttons are undone. The fit of this shirt is very boxy, not at all like pictured. Truly, the shirt is ugly. At least it’s soft enough to wear to bed…"
2.0,This tunic top fits kinda small and it is really short.
2.0,"Way too &#34;oversized,&#34; cheap-looking (cheaper than the $12.99 they cost), and had a scratch on the mirrored lens that I saw before I even pulled them out of the plastic. Which means it could've been caught before sending them to save me the annoyance of returning them. Don't waste your money!"
2.0,It looks knitted in the picture and cool looking.  It's not; it's just colors on a thin wrap.
2.0,"I got my finger sized at a jewelry store. I ordered a size 7 and it did not fit. The ring was to small either the sent the wrong size , or you need to order a size up."
2.0,These were probably 2-3 sizes too small for me. I could barely even get these over my hips. Very disappointing because they seem like very good quality and well made.
2.0,"My 5-year-old was happy with these shoes but after a month of wearing them not very consistently, the velcro started to rip off.  I had to buy new shoes to replace these.  I wouldn't recommend them."
2.0,"I really wanted to like these shoes. The print is adorable. However, the soles are stiff and the shoe has almost no padding. I can’t imagine my daughter would want to wear these for an entire day at school."
2.0,"The reason I am giving 2 stars is simply that I had to sew up the V-back several inches to get it to stay on my shoulders. I am also thinking of sewing the front a couple inches.  The slit in the back is simply too deep for it to stay in place.  This is a terrible design flaw. That said, if you have access to a needle and a little thread of whatever color you purchased, then it can be made to work and it is soft and pretty."
2.0,"Hat is big and heavy .., trashed it"
2.0,"The only reason I bought these shorts was for the pockets. The color I chose said “with pockets”, but they arrived without pockets."
2.0,"Ok, it is very comfortable but I ordered three and could only use two of them as the zipper broke the fist time zipping it"
2.0,"These are quite thin...not so thin that you can see through them, but the material felt more like underwear than exercise gear.  They were comfortable, but I would not have felt comfortable working out outside the house in them, so I returned them!"
2.0,"The Sandal is not up to the mark below expectation very thin sole already got cracks in the sole, it is feather weight that is the best part. It disappointed me a lot"
2.0,"My daughter is only 85 lbs and small, this hat is too tight for her, it can’t be stretched because of the wires, they may break if stretched. Not for an adult or average sized teen even"
2.0,I did not like this dress for me so I returned it!  I bought a Large in yellow.  The fabric felt very cheap.  The dress hugged my breasts and my stomach and fit wide around legs.  It was too long!!  This dress looks like something a woman 20 years older than me may wear and I'm 52 years old.
2.0,Good quality.........but WAYYY too small
2.0,"Size chart is totally wrong. Got the L for 6-7 year old and it could fit me, an adult. Otherwise cute."
2.0,It smells of dead animal. I had to return it. My closet has this smell everywhere. I had to open every window.<br />A bit gross.
2.0,These are not sweat pants. They are a nylon warm-up pant at best. They are not loose fitting and they were not at all what I thought I was ordering.
2.0,These earrings are extremely small would be best fitted for a child.They are very light weight and and easy to put on the ear.
2.0,Cheaply made and cheap material.
2.0,"It was a 3x, intended to be extra large as a costume piece. Instead it is tight. I usually wear XL, so I figured it would at least be loose."
2.0,"Product sizing is way off. Probably juniors or kids sizes IMO. Absolutely no lining. Completely see-through, tissue thin material. Only reason I didn't give it one star is the pattern is lovely."
2.0,"The material is actually very loud. Not at all like any chiffon material I've worn before. It sounds and feels like windbreaker material. It doesn't give at the shoulders when you raise your arms up either, resulting in a belly shirt if you try to move your arms at all. I got what I paid for."
2.0,they were cute but the medium was too small.  even tho medium is what I usually wear.  plus upon return I am only receiving $7 out of the $11.99 paid.  what's up with that?
2.0,Completely disappointed. Bought a different set and these were thrown away.
2.0,Product is not the same as picture. Not really sure it’s even real leather. Looks cheap
2.0,Love the colors and designs! They fall off his legs. The foot of the sock is the right size. The elastic isn’t tight enough to keep the sock on his leg though.
2.0,these are craft key chains
2.0,Poor quality does not last loan as original.
2.0,It’s cute however it doesn’t hang at all of the shoulder
2.0,Fabric is very see through and pooorly made.
2.0,The front of bra needs more support and more thickness in material for breasts. I feel like there's a piece of paper between me and my shirt. But I love the back the back is great if the front match the back it'd be the perfect bra.
2.0,Pésimo. Yo soy M en chompas y esta chompa parecía ser talla L. No recomiendo comprar esto
2.0,"Arrived today.... only received 5 bows, not six as shown/described.  One of the bows received had visible dried glue on top.  Disappointed as this was to be a Christmas gift.  Otherwise, these are adorable bows"
2.0,One of the clasp was broken upon arrival.
2.0,it didn’t fit me right but also i don’t have the boobs for it lol. it was cute but the material was cheap (which i expected) but i wasn’t very happy with it
2.0,The material isn’t soft and made cheaply
2.0,"Pay attention to the size of the ""purse"".. 3 inches by 3 inches.. Not big enough for my 2 year old nieces hands to hold and she is extremely petite.. This needs to be labeled as a dolls purse.. Cute and material is good otherwise.. Fast shipping.. But not big enough even for a fruit snack bag to be put in it.."
2.0,Such a pretty dress but unfortunately was sent to me with a broken zipper!
2.0,"I'm 5'5&#34;, 135 pounds and cup size B and I ordered a medium.<br />This dress could have been really great but it just missed the mark. It was so sheer that even adding an extra slip couldn't hide my underpants.<br />Also the dress fit waaaaay too small in the chest and arms area, and too loose around the hips. I looked pregnant.<br />The neck line went down half way past my stomach because there just wasn't enough fabric to wrap around the- the- chest area...<br />unless you are very flat chested or like the look of an undershirt under a dress (which I do not), keep shopping for another dress."
2.0,It was cute but it fitted funny on me. It like squished my face in and my eyelashes kept touching no matter how much I would adjust it one my face.
2.0,This item doesn’t look anything like the picture. It was too big in certain places; mostly the ankles and upper body and the knee cutouts were on both sides of the outfit. And that deep army green color was actually a light green which isn’t flattering if you have cellulite.
2.0,"Looked great when I got it, but after wearing it a while the rhinestones started falling out and the entire ball started disintegrating. It became smushy and green. Luckily it did not do that to my ear. The bar it self was fine, I just wish the ends had been made of the same material."
2.0,The dress runs way too small then expected. I ordered size xl but it fits like size small. Can't wear it :(.
2.0,"The light tie-dyed color print is completely see-through.  I liked the fit and design, but there is no way I can wear it out in public much less work out in it.  It doesn't matter if I wear a nude thong, you can see see it.  So, it is 100% NOT squat proof.  It's unfortunate because the print and fit are great."
2.0,The bracelet is rose red with a black clasp! So don't be fooled by the pretty pink in the picture!!!!!
2.0,"I loved the jacket, however it was way to small and I ordered my size and it was a lot shorter than I thought"
2.0,Very thin and doesn’t stay up over your mouth
2.0,I like the shape and size. This low rating is because my neck turned blue after wearing!
2.0,"Wrong color delivered, thin material"
2.0,These are nice.  However if you have small wrists i dont recommend as these are not adjustable.
2.0,Didn't like it as it was too large in the arms. It didn't suit me.<br />Looks great on pic but not when I actually tried it on so had to return
2.0,These leggings look good but they are not comfortable for the gym. The fabric is scratchy and made my thighs have a rash after lifting. Not squat proof either. I wouldn’t buy again.
2.0,I should’ve taken the advice from others!! They were too small! Ugh!  Had to return them! 🥴
2.0,"[[ASIN:B01NAUGHI2 Manduka Unisex GO Light Mat Carrier Variegated Stripe One Size]]<br /><br />I've been using this for 3 days a week for about 5 weeks before I noticed the seam started separating.<br /><br />The zipper is a &#34;J&#34; or &#34;L&#34; design where it would open partway down the end to make it easier to get your mat in/out. Much better than a top-only design. There is an exernal mesh pocket to hold keys, and a separate carrying handle on one end of the bag to make it easier to grab and go.<br /><br />I'm out of luck because it's a week past my eligible return date to the seller, and Manduka says they won't cover it because I didn't purchase it directly from Manduka.<br /><br />Even though it says &#34;GO Light&#34;, I was hoping it would last longer than 5 weeks :("
2.0,The glass on the front of the watch popped off after 4 months of having it. The look is nice but the quality isn't.
2.0,Thin material and static cling
2.0,"came out of the bag, wrinkled and balled up.  Since it was so sheer and fragile I had to steam it and still slightly wrinkled.  I have not worn it yet."
2.0,"This is NOT a sweatshirt, very thin material, poor quality"
2.0,"The size was fine, what the description doesn't mention is that there is elastic around the neck and sleeves. Very uncomfortable and unnecessary, I changed the whole look of it."
2.0,Looks good but too small .. couldn't send back because they want us to pay shipping .. not worth it.. very disappointed
2.0,"I absolutely love this bathing suit - it fits perfectly and it's comfortable.  However, after only 3 wearing a, the shoulder straps fell off on one side. I'm so disappointed. It's so hard to find a bathing suit that is comfortable and stylish."
2.0,I ordered an extra large after reading the other reviews. This blouse is big to fit as a short dress
2.0,These are much smaller than they appear! They are tiny enough to put in a newborn babies ear and it not be over sized! You can hardly even see the green in them because they are so small! Very disappointed in these and they were supposed to be a birthday gift for my daughter!!!
2.0,"These were so cute, but the pearl part of the earring was so malleable, and the backs of the earrings never fully closed! I lost one the way into an audition! I was so embarrassed. They would be wonderful if they were better made. I won't be wearing these. I am very disappointed."
2.0,"I had originally ordered this for my son's Halloween costume and was disappointed with how long it took to get here. Anyway......received and examined it and it is amazing! Thick, soft, quality fabric. Amazingly put together. Now it's a Christmas present. Christmas has come and gone so my son has now used the outfit.......I attempted to use the zipper(mind you this is the 1st time as I said attempted) and the zipper fell apartin my hands. So needless to say I have a very miserable 4 yr old and im past the return window. Thanks China."
2.0,"I am petite and ordered a Small size. The shipping arrived in expected time. The green color was beautiful but doesn't fit me around bust area. The lower portion of dress was  made with nice quality material and was well taliored, however the same is not true for upper half. The fabric was poor quality and looked cheap. The criss-cross  have no stich to hold them together which makes it looks clumsy and ill-fitted (not to mention reveling too). Returned it."
2.0,Fits loose and cord hangs
2.0,Wasn’t exactly like the picture. But it’s ok
2.0,quality is very poor
2.0,"This looked moderately cute from the front, but the back was horrible, and the fit was overall... wrong.  The back has a HUGE cut-out, so if you are a little self-conscious about letting your whole back show, then this isn't the suit for you.  Additionally, the skirt in front is just in FRONT, in the back there is nothing, so if you have a little booty, it will definitely pop out.  The sizing is a little weird.  It's a long suit, and really big in the cup areas.  It doesn't quite &#34;cup&#34;, if you know what I mean."
2.0,"Purchased these for my daughter and her friend and they are super cute. A little big for a 6 year old, but that's ok. But this disappointment was 2 days after wearing it the &#34;best&#34; charm fell off my daughter's. She managed to find it at school and I need to see if I can re-attach it better. But it was a bummer."
2.0,The heal wore down on them in a few months  I bought them to wear walking the dogs around our average. They work ok but the heals wore down just walking on gravel and dirt
2.0,"Uses a safety pin to attach to shirt. Difficult to operate safety pin between collar and tie as, even with a mirror, I couldn't see what I was using.<br />Ties look nice on the table, but I'll buy a clip on or around the collar band version to actually wear."
2.0,The pants are nice but the shirt was short and a bit small<br /><br />Cheap Christmas tree iron on logo
2.0,The posts are very cheap and splintery.  Unwearable.
2.0,They are just thin socks that run a little big<br />I can not imagine wearing them anywhere but in my house.<br />They do not provide comfort or support
2.0,"I recieved this as a gift off of my wishlist. I put a size med on my list however the item has no sizing listed on the outfit so maybe they sent the wrong one my mistake. The headband and shoes are very small so i think this might be the case. The red part is polyester but the skull and crossbones are felt. The ends are comming up and i just pulled it out of the bag. I am disappointed, i was so excited to get this. We will be returning."
2.0,What good are pockets if they don't sew it shut
2.0,"Hard to open clasps, broke after second use"
2.0,Too small and got smaller after wash
2.0,It colored my sheets. Will never buy this again.
2.0,"They were suppose to be 100% cotton and they are not but since the tags were cut out I have no idea of the actual fabric. I find it questionable as to why they would cut the tags out, false advertising, etc. I will probably return them as I wanted 100% cotton."
2.0,This dress is as pictured. it is a decent  quality with a nice thickness. The Criss-Cross detail is cute. I kept the dress because it looks really cute with leggings. I think I will wash it to shrink it a little. It is very comfortable although it's not that figure-flattering for me. I use the sizing chart an ordered based on the breast size.  it's true to size. It makes me look rather large on the bottom and I'm actually a size 6 with a 36d.  I am short so it is longer than I expected. Overall I thought the quality the colors were very nice. Something I can  wear just to run errands. I will make it work.
2.0,"I returned it the day it arrived. The material was super cheap and almost shiny...not what I was expecting. It was not well made at all, and didn’t fit well."
2.0,Not a fan. Looks and feels cheap.
2.0,My daughter did not like these. The fabric is scratchy making her face sore and they thicker so you sound more muffled than other masks.
2.0,"These are mediocre. They feel way too stretched out and I have a big head. I was also disappointed that the skull cover print was too large, I thought it would match up some what with my skull."
2.0,Cheap material. Looks much nicer on the pictures
2.0,Collar seams puckered after washing. One shirt seam split and uckered. Stitching is sloppily done and raveling.<br />Not great.
2.0,This was a gift for grandchild. The magnets were to strong & hurt ears after wearing for a while.
2.0,"I have been buying sports bras for over 30 years.  My size has never changed so far and is still the same, Medium.  I just bought another couple of bras recently (different brand) and they were again Medium.  The MIRITY ones, even though they say they are medium, are SMALL!  I held them against my usual ones and they have over one inch less in width below the breasts and are also way shorter from shoulder to lower breast line. So.... if you buy these make sure to buy a size up!"
2.0,Would have been nice if the header and description weren't misleading that this item was just a single earring as I intended to buy them as a pair.
2.0,"While the product itself looked really nice,  I was disappointed.  I ordered the 35mm x 20mm first and it was way to small for me.  Then I ordered this one and it appeared to be the same size as the first one.  I'm going to ry the biggest one next only because I love the design.  This cross would look good on a smaller person."
2.0,Lightweight but NO compression which is what I bought them for. Still cute and light for workouts but not providing the compression I need
2.0,I really love this anklet. It is super cute and exactly what I wanted. I wear it during the day but then take it off in the evening when I go to bed. Sadly I have only had it a week and one of the balls fell off and the whole thing came apart. I am so bummed.
2.0,"Fit is too short and too wide. The short isn't so bad, but when comined with being so wide, it looks slightly ridiculous.  It is at least as wide as a large, maybe even an XL."
2.0,Pkok so far
2.0,I unfortunately ended up returning them the day after I received them. I hope you can see in my picture how sheer the material was and I just didn't feel comfortable wearing them.<br /> I will say though that i loved how they have 3 pockets and that in my book is always fantastic in exercise gear.
2.0,Nice dress but the sizing is way off. I am giving it away
2.0,"they don't exactly fit my face so if your someone with a big head DONT buy it, even though they are cute. Oh, and you cant return them either"
2.0,Way too large. Could not use on recent cruise and can not send it back.
2.0,2 were supposed to come in the pack. Only one arrived.
2.0,"These are definitely not yoga leggings by ANY stretch. They aren’t leggings at all really. They are footless tights. They’re quite sheer, like what skaters would wear."
2.0,The material is really nice and it came every quickly. Unfortunately it has some stitching and quality issues and there’s no way to contact the seller.
2.0,the middle feel out the first time i wore it/
2.0,Se rompe por las costuras de abajo
2.0,"The apron is very heavy duty and seems of high quality.  The straps are horrible.  I would expect a much better strap/system.  Instead, I am looking for a local seamstress/alterations person to make some suitable straps to match the rest of the apron.  Buyer beware."
2.0,The quality is pretty cheap. The laminated plastic layer was peeling from the pin and the worst part was the flamingo head was broken when it shipped. Super disappointed!
2.0,Did not hold up my breasts. I’m a C to D cup and didn’t think it would work and it didn’t. Wasn’t too much $ so it was worth a shot. Great concept just didn’t work for me.
2.0,Runs way small and cheaply made.
2.0,"the only thing makes me keep this is the color. Material is really cheap, fits really short than it looks. it does not worth the 16 and smt dollars. i gave 2 star because of the color."
2.0,I give it 2 stars because it is a cute top but I ordered three sizes larger than what I wear and it fits like it's three sizes too small because I could not even get it on
2.0,"This shirt would be cute had it been constructed properly. I was so disappointed when I tried it on. One sleeve opening is noticably larger than the other and the seams doesn’t the bodice are not symmetrical. One side is much for tapered than the other. It made for a very awkward fit. The material is nice and the color true to the photo, but overall it was very disappointing."
2.0,"I love kancan and ordered my usual size, these were about three sizes to small."
2.0,Top fits terrible it's was sewed together horribly! By daughter wore it once and had to wear something under it because it just flaps up. It's super loose! The bow came untact immediately and is hanging off. The bottoms fit fine.
2.0,It ripped in the back just a little over a month now. Wish I could return but the return period is closed
2.0,It did not come with the hooks to go in the ears! The bags of fish are cute and fun.  We went and grabbed some hooks from the store
2.0,Strap broke after wearing for 1 hr
2.0,Not cute on. Very matronly. Smells funny. Sizing is true to US sizing though. Buy your regular size.
2.0,Like it but not enough room if your a male.
2.0,"They were a little larger than I expected. The black earrings look better than the gunmetal,the edges of the gunmetal are white which in my opinion make them look a little cheap."
2.0,Nice ornament but the bottom where the switch is broke the inside of the ornament is falling out
2.0,The material is very lose knit and kind of sloppy. Pretty color violet
2.0,"I read the reviews before ordering so I decided to purchase. It fit nicely at first.  However, I had to take it off due to it jabbing my sides! I traded the underwire just to be replaced with wire on each side of the bra. I’m very disappointed 😔 but I’m glad I only purchased one. I don’t recommend."
2.0,if you consider these as one time wear and disposable then they aren't a bad deal otherwise don't expect to last past one wearing
2.0,This top looked absolutely ridiculous on me. I returned it the same day I got it.
2.0,There is nothing suitable in this bag for a tongue piercing: either too long or too short. Nothing in here suitable for nose piercings. Meh.
2.0,It doesn’t cover my whole torso. And slides up a lot.
2.0,"This picture is me in an extra large. It makes me feel like the hulk, my biceps are bursting at the seams. Maybe this is actually a child's shirt?"
2.0,"I really liked the band, easy to remove the links especially being I have a small bday frame for my age. Well, I have a corporate job &amp; have tried countless bands that are coated in black &amp; trying not to spend hundreds on an Apple Watch band. Well, disappointed in the black band on this one. It did last longer than the others I’ve tried, but as you can see the coating didn’t last long maybe a month at most. So I’m giving up on black coated bands now. I’m tryingto think of I’ll order this band in the basic uncoated stainless steel version or not… I should’ve just done that in the very beginning. Sitting at a computer for 9 hours a day &amp; a band sways ends up like this…"
2.0,"Not great quality, button fell off in first wash plus the material is rather thin. Worth the $15 tho"
2.0,"Biggest complaint is the left shoe is glitchy after 1 day.  It won’t turn off on its own nor will it change color anymore, stays red.  We have not had much luck with these types of shoes in other brands so this pair my son has been very careful to not run in them hoping they will stay working properly past the first day/charge.  We weren’t so lucky, so I will not buy light up shoes anymore."
2.0,Is not what is represented in picture. Shape is smaller almost like a beanie.
2.0,"I was given a  2xl in the sleeveless style, it fit but I like a little more room, so I ordered a 3xl in this one, WAY smaller than the cut of the 2xl tank style. Also it took a LONG time to arrive. and the skirt isn't very full... would not buy this cut again."
2.0,The jacket is too small the pants fit as expected
2.0,The yoga reflex workout pants were torn in two places (towards the bottom of the legs).
2.0,"I thought from the photo that it was going to be a double flared plug, but the back side was just a smaller flare than the front. That made it to where the front was heavy enough to just slip right out of my ear. The color was pretty but not as vibrant as the photo and only on the one side. Also pay attention because they are sold individually, not as a pair."
2.0,Just too tight around ribs
2.0,Great unless you sleep on your side.  The bulk of everything is mounted right over the ear instead out of the way on top like others.  Used twice.
2.0,I did not expect a yoga pants to feel so tight
2.0,"I ordered them primarily for the white pair, thought it was a great deal. Opened the package and the pair I wanted had a giant scratch on the lens, very disappointed."
2.0,"This fit well and did look good overall form-wise, but the color is a perfect flesh tone. And when I say perfect flesh tone, I mean it. Anytime I passed a mirror at the gym, I did a double take. This also means the tiniest bit of sweat is easy to see (in the bum) and you can’t wear colored underwear underneath. If you’re a pale, I would avoid."
2.0,Straps are super tight very pretty also glitter falls off but the shoe is beautiful runs a little big as well as far as length wise so either the strap is super tight or my daughters foot is fat lol
2.0,Waaaayyyy to BIG. My husband says that they looked like old lady glasses.
2.0,Ok so the sizing is correct but the way this garment was cut and sewed together is weird. Cargo pockets aren’t. You might be able to put some slim item like a dollar bill in them…the front pockets are situated way around on the hips snd very shallow. I like the material but wonder who these are made for? It also took like three weeks for them to show. I kept the shorts. They are ok for lounging around…any activity not requiring pockets.
2.0,"Al comienzo se siente bien, pero sólo lo use para ir a mercar y estaba que me lo quitaba, en realidad se empieza a enrollar en la cintura, es algo incómodo para mi."
2.0,The Swimming Suit is Fine It was just not what I had Ordered. They sent me a different Swimming Suit. The Plastic Package it came in said it was the Polka dot Purple XL but it had stripes and the top was like a halter top and longer Swimming Bottoms that what I ordered. I sent a message to them about this and got no reply.<br />I needed it for a function so I had to keep it or I would have sent it Back.  I would have preferred the one I ordered since it was like a tank top and shorter bottoms.
2.0,"I really wish these came in TALL inseam sizes (32""-36""). I had to buy a size larger so I could get a ""capri"" length after washing. Really wish they shrunk in the waist instead of the leg, as I'm constantly having to tug them up due to the waist being too large."
2.0,Fell apart a few weeks after received :S
2.0,"Not enough clearance, rubbed hole on the bottom. Bought 2 for our recent trip, thinking about returning."
2.0,Very sheer. Would need to wear a long slip under it.
2.0,"The band itself looks really nice. My issue was 2-1/2 months of owning it, the whole thing came apart on me while at work. One of the screws apparently fell off and undid the links from the top attachment. Quality and craftsmanship isn't there but what to expect for a band under $20. if you're looking for a band immediately that looks good and will make a statement, then this is for you. If you're looking for the long-run, I wouldn't suggest it at all."
2.0,I specifically wanted bamboo/viscose pajamas for the cooling effect as I live in Texas.  These are not viscose as advertised but rather 95% cotton.  They are soft and stretchy but not what I ordered.  Not as advertised.
2.0,"The color and fit are good, BUT the material is too thin...definitely not meant for winter months."
2.0,Very cheap quality. Most of mine broke after one use. But they are nice looking. But material is cheap. ..
2.0,2 out of 3 broke in 2 days. Frame just cracked. They seemed really light also.
2.0,Way too small.... Absolutely no wiggle room! I'd give it 1 star but my emo daughter wanted it. Lol.. Thanks anyway Amazon!
2.0,"these have cool designs but the earloops are too long, dont fit very well on the face and they smell really bad"
2.0,Same side Velcro on each side - useless. Coming apart at seams. Horrible quality.
2.0,I purchased these for my toddler to use at the beach but the sizing was very strange and I returned them. The sole seemed big for the size I ordered and the uppers are just a stretchy fabric. They looked very strange on my kid's foot and I was concerned about comfort and fit.
2.0,"It’s a bummer because I love the style and fit, but the fabric is awful, rough, and itchy. I’m so bummed; it would’ve been perfect for my trip to Paris."
2.0,Very odd material.  Scratchy feeling on the inside.  Sleeves were way too short and the rest of the shirt was short and wide.
2.0,The tops are too small
2.0,"it broke after the first trip, very bad experience."
2.0,"The shirt was too tight and the pants were too long which is weird. I'm 5 foot, 176bls. I bought a medium hoping the pants wouldn't be too long"
2.0,Like the look and price but not the quality. Leather came undone within a couple months of casual wear. It's not an expensive piece so i guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,very shoddily made.
2.0,not as good as I thought
2.0,Adorable earrings. Clasping mechanism poorly designed though. Lost an earring already and didn’t have them 24hrs.
2.0,"Although the dress fit perfectly, I had to return because material on the back of the dress was too see through."
2.0,"nice color, runs too small I'm only 5""3 and 135 but way too small"
2.0,I would like the brighton bag..that is part of the gift.
2.0,Pants are fraying bad. My daughter has only worn them once and the pants are starting to fall apart. Very disappointed
2.0,Purchased this garment for a casual beach wedding. It was was not as long as pictured. I was very disappointed with the length.
2.0,"Lock is cheap, the winders do not continuously work"
2.0,"it&#34;s not what I expected, I ware 7 1/4 but this about 7 . I like the style but I cannot ware it."
2.0,"This is SUPER cute and dainty, as long as you don't look too close. One “M” is wonky and must have been overlooked before shipping out. A little disappointed, but I’ll live."
2.0,"While the bracelets I received did look like the picture, the beads were quite small and the diameter of the bracelets was also small. I needed up giving them to my granddaughter. She loved them."
2.0,Too small! Im a 38 c. Its squished my chest and gave no support. I returned it same day
2.0,Will return this item. Looks like it will break<br />soon.
2.0,Necklace is beautiful for decoration but immediately rashed my skin when I wanted to wear it.
2.0,Must be China product. This bra would not fit an 8 or. old kid.
2.0,"Cute but very flimsy post, after less than 3 months of wear the post bent in my Daughter's earlobe. Pictures posted are after I tried to straighten it with no luck. Outside of return window so now I'm out the cost and have to replace them"
2.0,"It is a pretty design but the material is very stiff/not stretchy at all. Was hoping for cotton. I don’t really know what the stuff is. I’m afraid if I wash it it’s going to shrink and going to require a lot of ironing. The neck is very wide left to right, which I wasn’t liking that too much either. it’s a shame because it looks pretty in the picture."
2.0,sizes run small.
2.0,"I probably would not buy again. It was weird texture and I do not think it looks good, however that is probably personal opinion."
2.0,"Cute suit, nice color but elastic is frayed behind mesh on bottoms after 1 wear, before getting wet. 😒"
2.0,not same wash as picture and not flattering at all on curves
2.0,way small for a large
2.0,"The shirt looked as pictured, but was covered in small mold spots. Was going to return for a replacement but don’t want to bother anymore. Save you’re money and pick something similar up anywhere else."
2.0,Viene muy grande de la parte de los montos y es un problema me gusta pero no lo puedo usar solo me tengo que poner una chaqueta para que no se note que me queda muy grande
2.0,"This isn't a real hakama. It's essentially using basic starchy fabric you'd buy at your local craft store and following a DIY fake hakama pattern. It arrived wrinkled and the hakama is just a skirt, it's not a pants-skirt. The fabric choice means it will never drape correctly.<br /><br />I practiced Kendo for many years and started wearing my old uniform instead of a robe around the house because it is super comfortable. That's why I bought this. If you want a real uniform/hakama, even for cosplay, just hit up kendo or aikido uniform supply stores. If you want a color, get white and dye it the color you want.<br /><br />Fit wise, I'm female, 5'9'' and a muscular 150lbs. The XL fell at the correct length, but the top was huge on me. I could have used a medium top for sure. The ""hakama"" looked off but it's the fabric that's making that happen."
2.0,"I didn't realize until after I wore it, but the shirt looks like is says Average Toes on the front. Spend a little more and get the correct font!"
2.0,"Dress is completely see through! It was unraveling in numerous areas. Really wanted to love this dress, but the photos in the listing are an inaccurate representation."
2.0,"Runs really small... super cute especially for smaller girls, but not good for us with a bit more of a figure.  Real disappointed :("
2.0,Couldn’t get it on before the static began snapping. It looks and feels comfortable
2.0,"These have very wide legs and a very tight waist.  Like maybe a 32 inch waist at the most.  But the legs are not tight at all so they just don't fit right.  Bad design I think.  anyway, they aren't good for me so I don't know who they are supposed to fit."
2.0,"Not what I expected,. Cheapl material,"
2.0,Shoes are cute. Got a lot of compliments the first day but now one shoe lights up and the other no..so only cute for one day. I wish either both lit up or didn't
2.0,Very disappointed with fit M was to small & large was big!
2.0,"The shirt is very short, not full length. Cannot use it this way, what point is the stomach portion missing on a rash guard? Need to protect that area from the sun as well."
2.0,This material is not micro-fiber. It feels like wood or tissue or something. It's not soft - at all. Think the carpet on your floor. That soft. I definitely think this will scratch your glasses. I regret buying.
2.0,Pretty top.. Tight. Does not fit well. Go at least one or two sizes up.
2.0,Very stiff! No flow at all. It is see through enough that you can totally see what color my bra and panties is underneath even if its white! I bought a dozen dresses last week (All different brands)  and this is the only one I didn't LOVE!
2.0,"Stretchy material. The calves are much tighter than the waste and thighs, which is a little uncomfortable because they tend to pull down. Too loose around stomach, constantly pulling back up. Inner thread is scratchy on the waste, especially my back."
2.0,"Comfortable and cute but not practical for use by healthcare workers! A few times of a blood pressure cuffs velcro getting stuck on it, and it appears thready and yucky."
2.0,"It's a cute necklace. The beads aren't high quality but decent for the price. The problem is that they did not use crimp beads to finish the stands correctly. They have them so closet to the lobster claw clap that it makes it very difficult to open and clip to the jump ring. Then on the jump ring side of the strand the wire hasn't been twisted to the main strand. So now you have it poking out and it scratches your neck.<br />I would say this is a very amateurish attempt at necklace making. I only say that bc about 15 years ago I got into doing this. And yes, this is what a lot of my efforts looked like. I did improve but not much and I got bored because unless you really stick with it and have a gift, it doesn't really go anywhere. I will trim the wires so it doesn't irritate my skin and adjust the crimp beads by the lobster claw to make it easier to open. But unless you can do that and are willing to do that, I'd say there are better options out there."
2.0,This namd is not long enough for a wrist 7.5 inches or larger unless you want to be constantly scratched by the closure.
2.0,"This shocked me. The material is very very thin, far thinner than I've ever seen on one of these, and it really isn't very warm at all. More than that, the with border is very poorly sewn and had holes where it is pulling away from the red portion. It is the worst I've seen and I've seen bad ones. I can't recommend this product. It's better than nothing, but it's really not good enough in a world of great options. I say pass. Good luck in your search."
2.0,"Shoulder were too big, like it would be made for a man."
2.0,The material is like paper and the item came with a hole.
2.0,"I wanted to love this shirt. It’s soft and a flattering, if slightly large fit. Love the color too, however it snags terribly and looks/feels cheap.<br /><br />Disappointed"
2.0,So I bought this it was supper cute but I tried it on and it wouldn't fit I got a large adult  im normally a medium  they say to get a size bigger but then I got it and I swear it was for a 6th grader
2.0,"I love the idea of the product and it works great until they get wet and you lose them/they disappear. So great for ""dry"" application but poor for water sports."
2.0,Cheaply made but very inexpensive! Would make the right outfit shine!
2.0,Loved the picture. Seller should have tested retractable reel... broken.
2.0,"This product is terrible, paper thin, and the threads are coming loose."
2.0,"Good color, good style.  Just fits terrible in the crotch and around the stomach. Way too much material just as another customer said. Otherwise it would've been great. Im 168lbs 5'5&#34; curvy and ordered the large. Im not going to order the medium because then it'll be too tight in the butt arms and breast."
2.0,"Didn't actually wear them since I was worried about what would be ""seen"" should I bend over while wearing them."
2.0,Wore this product for the the first time last week and did not protect my arms from getting a minor sunburn .  My expectations were that I could wear these sleeves without having to apply sun block.  Will not be wearing these again as they appear to provide no sun protection.  Will be trying something else that appears to be a higher quality and (hopefully) made in the USA.
2.0,Poor quality material. Threads hanging everywhere when I got them.
2.0,Received item with split/Broken zipper. Awesome dress and quality.I so disappointed.
2.0,"very awkward sizing and very scratchy, uncomfortable material. unflattering, at best."
2.0,looks really cheap
2.0,"This was a 2 band purchase, black band was fine worked ok ,locked on Fitbit 3 ok, gray band would not latch. Quality control should of caught this,"
2.0,"While I like the print and the fit is good, this is going back because it is not lined and the fabric is thin, white and not opaque.  I have other dresses this style and they have a heavier feel so they swing is better, this is very thin so it just hung down."
2.0,Sent back to big and did not like the horizontal stripes
2.0,"This was too big on my stomach and didn't help hold things in, but was tight on my thighs."
2.0,"The color of this product was a bit of a mystery, as there are two colors depicted in the photos; one being a light tan, and the other more of a caramel.  The product is the lighter of the two colors shown.  The silver clasp arrived scratched and with a tarnished spot, so I will have to return.  The closure of the clasp does not lock into place; I would be very concerned about it falling open when wearing.  For a $60 bracelet, I expected a higher level of quality, particularly when the listing references that it will not tarnish, and was built to last."
2.0,My son wanted this. Hes only 14 and it fits like a toddler hat
2.0,larger than size 12 girls granddaughter cannot wear. Backstrap will not stay on her heel.
2.0,"When my daughter tried these on, there was a plastic knob on the top part of the slipper sticking into her foot, which made them very uncomfortable.  I complained to the company and received no response.  She is very disappointed."
2.0,Not flattering and poor quality
2.0,"These should not be labeled as &#34;compression&#34; lolol.  There is NO compression going on here.  I'm sure they are fine for daily wear otherwise, but I was hoping for compression tops to wear over my workout bra.  I even bought them 2 sizes smaller in hopes it would be snug.  Nope.  They are just tank tops. I am returning them."
2.0,Returned the item - too flimsy.
2.0,"Not the best quality. It was alot thinner than I thought it was going to be. I also underestimated how large it would be, when ordering go a size down."
2.0,Fits VERY small...I take a Large but should have ordered and XXL. Also tends to rip in the shoulders if any pressure is applied.
2.0,"I consistently wear Medium sized sweaters and have purchased other brands on Amazon that fit just fine.  This sweater, however, was so small, i could barely fit it on."
2.0,"These were so cute! The salamander had arrived with multiple rhinestones missing and the dream catcher wire was unhinged. Still cute. You get what you pay for. But the paint on the black jewelry does begin to chip after a week or so! Worth it tho, got many compliments on the butterfly! The spider and salamander are also very uncomfortable to wear."
2.0,"Very cute bras however they run small and arent very supportive. I ordered a cup size up and I'm still spilling out of it. My boobs sag making me think I shouldn't wear a bra at all. I must state that I am an avid underwire wearing woman so I thought I just needed time to adjust to no underwire, but I just really dislike this bra."
2.0,I'm a size 12 to 14 usually however these were see through when I put them on because they were stretched too thin.
2.0,I normally wear an extra large to a 2x in a shirt due to a bust size of a 42DD so I ordered a 3x just in case. It came and I was so excited but the shoulder area is tight and it's very thin. Ifor I saw this in a store I'd pass it up. Very disappointed but I do love the pattern.
2.0,This shirt is absolutely gigantic! I'm 5'8 with a thick chest and upper back so I ordered a size small.  This thing looked like a tunic/sleeveless nightshirt on me.  Absurdly large!
2.0,UPDATE: THE ZIPPER BROKE AFTER ONLY 3 WEARS. DISAPPOINTED<br /><br />Pleasantly surprised with these pants.  Material is good quality. Length is great and fit in general is very flattering.  The waistline was a lil huge than expected...it I right below my belly button. I have big hips/thighs and these pants r still very flattering.
2.0,I loved it when I first took it out the box. It was shiny and new. Now it has started to turn green on the chain part and it hasn’t even been a month.
2.0,Pretty but does not stretch
2.0,Ordered an xl and it fits like a medium.
2.0,Didn’t last i am so disappointed
2.0,The snow globe back portion is so heavy that it tilts the front stud at an angle where you cannot see what it is. The back portion isn't bright or colorful enough to catch much light or attention. Returning.
2.0,"This one took awhile to get here but I understood as it was being shipped from china. It’s good quality and material feels nice. But unfortunately when it finally did arrive, it wasn’t finished. It was missing a button or any fastener to hook it in the back at the top. It clearly has a loop intending to be fastened to something but the fastener is missing making this unwearable as unfortunately I can’t even sew a button."
2.0,Looked much worse in person than the pictures would indicate.  Leather did not appear to be good quality for the price.
2.0,The masks have a large slit at the side for putting in a filter unfortunately without a flap they do not stay in securely.  Without a nose piece the mask's fit is not as good.  The diposeable surgical masks have a better fit around the face thoughI really like the adjustable straps on this mask.  The filter pocket should have been at the top.
2.0,I thought the purse was way bigger it's extremely small only thing that will fit is a phone and maybe your driver's license
2.0,Pattern is not as pictured. Fits well.
2.0,These are small and the material is very soft. Cannot even tell I am wearing them 😔  What a waste of $16+
2.0,NOT WHAT i EXPECTED
2.0,Very thin. Not what I expected.
2.0,Love this dress was very short
2.0,"These are super cute. They come with elastic strings to be attached. It was easy to attach. However, the elastic is way to small for any child. It wouldn't even fit on my 18month old. It was very disappointing that the kids could not wear these hats at the party."
2.0,"These are really neat shoes but when we received them, one pair's usb insert was broke. We had no way of charging them. Had to send them back for a refund which we received with no problem."
2.0,Turned brown
2.0,I'm a normal medium woman size and these were way too small for a men's medium
2.0,Not the size in photo
2.0,"What happened? Usually when i purchase Iron Fist clothing or shoes, i am delighted. This dress came wrinkled especially noticeable on the white ribcage. It looks CHEAP. I may need to return, because this is a mistake for $54.00."
2.0,The item is much shorter and tighter than expected.
2.0,"one of the bars on this item arrived broken, it needs to be repaired.  We will use super glue, that will be easier than sending it back.<br /><br />It will work for organization, but too bad it was not made better."
2.0,"the inside pocket, is soughed into the lining , I wanted to returned and get the same purse , no body answers ."
2.0,Product was shrink wrapped for delivery and runs super small.It is basically a crumpled mess.
2.0,The size is WAY off!  It gives you options for sizes but there is not sizing on the skirt.  I am so so SAD.  It is so cute!
2.0,The item does not look like what is listed online. The slip is white underneath and the dress is sheer. The top does not fit at all as it is tooooo right. I’m going to keep it and pass it along to someone in need.
2.0,"Cute shirt but too small even though I ordered 2 sizes larger than what I normally wear in US sizes. Also, the fabric on one side of the shirt is messed up...it has several threadbare spots that look like something rough was scraped down it. I'm sure it will get holes on this side soon. This experience definitely makes me hesitant about ordering Asian-sized clothing online again."
2.0,"The bag is lightweight and compact.  However, it is DIFFERENT from what the photo shows in color.  I ordered the bag with yellow zipper.  The picture shows yellow front zipper and black top zipper. Instead the top zipper is yellow as well.  The photo shows the straps with light grey border, but the actual bag has dark grey border.  It doesn't look as good."
2.0,"I purchased an XL and it fit like a Large, but it’s a nice shirt"
2.0,Liked the idea of kangaroo sweatshirt. The sweatshirt was sized up but still small especially in the arms.
2.0,"Material feels cheap. Pockets are way to small / shallow to hold a cell phone, keys, and wallet."
2.0,"Fits okay, but based on the condition of the item. It appears to be a used garment. This is based on the pilling on certain spots of the item. Will be sending back as I’m not paying full price for a used piece of clothing"
2.0,"The &#34;large&#34; fits me like a small would. I am 5'6&#34;, 130lbs. Not okay. I wanted it to fit bigger and drape better. Very displeased with the size & quality isn't the best either."
2.0,"Very cheaply made.  You get what you pay for.  The pictures are 90% better than the actual product.  The delivery took 3 weeks, way too long for online shopping.  The garment was also ill fitting and the material very cheap.  Save your money!!!"
2.0,"Was not impressed with these.  Cheaply made, the stud does not work to keep them from flopping down on the ear.  Bent the back up, and will need another back to try to keep them in position.  Not a true ear crawler.  Would not purchase again."
2.0,"For the price it great. I should have read description better. I thought it was cloth not rubber. Other then that, all good."
2.0,I think they are a little too dark for night driving....u can see the headlights of other cars but anything else seems u can't see....
2.0,"I was disappointed with this product.  Even though I liked how soft the material felt, the workmanship was the worst I have ever seen! When I took the pajamas out of the package, there were stitches coming apart, there were seams in wrong places that stuck out like a sore thumb, there were loose threads everywhere, just to name a few issues. I would have given this product one star instead of two if it wasn't for the soft material.  I returned the pajamas."
2.0,It’s not very wide. It’s slim and it’s hard to find stuff in the purse. You have to feel around to get anything because it doesn’t get wide. I liked the color and feel of it and the many zippers but didn’t like that it wasn’t wide enough.
2.0,"They seem to be of good material and would be warm, but there is a significant design flaw that makes them unusable. The tongue in the front is detached and open all the way to the top of the foot/ankle area. This means any snow coming over the top of the foot will end up crammed around the side of he flap and get inside the boot. I've seen snow boots with a tongue and velcro like this before, but they've all had a snow barrier sewn between the tongue and the boot so your feet wouldn't be able to get wet and cold. We get several feet of snow, so this one is a non-starter."
2.0,The clasps pull hair when the mask is being held in place and the elastic wears out after a few uses. I love a the colors and great to be able to keep mask easily accessible when not in use.
2.0,"This review is for the &#34;FUNOC Fashion New Women Vintage Wool Round Cloche Cap&#34; in red.<br /><br />The hat arrived in a 4-inch-high shipping box, that meant it had to be flattened  to fit into the box.  It probably would have sprung back into a decent enough shape to wear, but I don't know --- because it's too small for my (evidently giant) head.  Granted, a cloche style is meant to be worn snug on the head, but the crown needs to be deep to fit properly and this was not.  When I managed to force it down onto my head it just popped back up because it's too shallow (I am only 5'2&#34; tall btw.)<br /><br />The fit is nothing like how it looks on the model in the item photo.  The size of the hat I received is more appropriate for a 10-year-old than a grown woman.<br /><br />Other than the size issue, the color was true to what was shown in the photo.  The quality isn't great (it's lightweight and doesn't have a ton of structure) but considering how inexpensive the hat is I would have been happy -- if only it had fit."
2.0,"When I was waiting for my package, there was a delay on it. When I finally got it, the rope for the necklace was not tied together. That didn't bother me much, however, I was getting black soot all over my hands and my neck after I tried it on. I wiped the soot off as much as possible, but after a whole day of wearing the necklace, it left that black soot around the neck of my white shirt. Ruined my shirt. Absolutely upset about it."
2.0,Very generous cut.  It is much larger than expected and completely see through.  My daughter is 5'9 and 130 and it swam on her.<br /><br />The color is pretty thought
2.0,The Hot and sexy backless cut lingerie nightwear was way too small for me. I only still give it a 2 because the fabric is very soft and it is made well. just wouldn't recommend buying this if you are bigger then a 9 maybe even a 5.
2.0,Great looking piece. Runs small. The bottoms didn’t fit at all.
2.0,I wore them to an outdoor concert that entailed a small amount of walking and they fell apart. I superglued the straps that fell apart from the sole of the sandal but they still continued to break. Disappointing because the design is cute and comfy!
2.0,The fabric was too heavy for my liking and the arm holes were gaping big. My bra hung out and is unflattering.
2.0,"Kind of small, seems like a kid's hat."
2.0,Does not click and stay in place well. So I would say don't buy. The material  is nice but don't help if it's not functional.
2.0,"Knit material was very good, but size 4 was much smaller than expected by the measurements given."
2.0,"I liked the watch band, but it was pretty difficult to remove links and then it only lasted less than a month. It fell off the table and a piece of the band shattered. Would not recommend"
2.0,"Pretty cheap looking, on the photo it was much better"
2.0,If I had a Cricut I would have made it better.  The image is pixelated.  Disappointing.
2.0,this was beautiful.... however i sent it back because to me it looked fake and like costume jewerly unlike the other costume jewerly ive purchased looks oh so real.....
2.0,I wouldn't recommend this band. Although it is comfortable the elastic is terrible and it does not fit tightly even though I bought the size I always do. It feels like it would stretch out very easily.
2.0,"For a first month it was pretty good but after a month of use, it's about to break down into little pieces. Fits for school pretty well, A4+."
2.0,"I loved this necklace! It was so cute, but unfortunately it is also very fragile. The chain became disconnected from the feminist part. The links are too small for my fingers to have connected it, and pinched the link back closed. So, I just tossed it. Made me sad."
2.0,Runs way large.  Sending back. Small is 2 inches over navel and baggy everywhere.
2.0,"So disappointed, The description said &#34;Cotton. Cotton Blend&#34; but what I got was that drapey polyester mix that clings in weird places and doesn't breathe. Returning and hoping they'll start being more accurate on their descriptions."
2.0,I bought a small and it was too big i wish they had an extra small
2.0,"This dress was pretty but it was too thin.  Needs to have a lil more thickness so you can't see under garments, otherwise I'd have to wear a slip or something under it and that's not something I'm interested in doing in the summer.  So I returned it."
2.0,They were too small so I wanted to order a size 1 but  they didn’t have that size so I had to go with another brand.
2.0,Elastic finger holder is too small for an adult.  Might be good for small children but they should not use these bright lights. Otherwise looked great.
2.0,Two of them fell apart the day after we bought it. Good material but not good quality.
2.0,"Chest too wide and bust waaaaay to small, eventhough I am a medium-bust person... Would look great on small-bust girls though."
2.0,I really liked it but I wore a nice flowing dress and the band kept catching on the light material and ruined my dress... Would be great with jeans and a t-shirt but doubt the style will match..
2.0,I just don't like it.
2.0,"The only reason these get more than 1 star is due to how SUPER SOFT these are!! OMFG the softest yoga leggings I have ever put on. Softer than the lularoe leggings. And I would say 90% of women know how soft they are because they either own a pair or one of her friends who bought a pair made her touch them. BUT but wow. I am a solid curvy woman, maybe I just needed to get a size up but they are see-through. 100%. I tried them on with like the brightest panties I could find and I could see every detail. No joke folks. Regardless I'll definitely be wearing them around the house and also use them to seduce my husband. LOL!!! Definitely not to be worn in public. #Don'tDoIt"
2.0,Bottom red part of shoe comes off often and is very hard to get back together!
2.0,"I absolutely loved this when it arrived it was beautiful and easy to attach to my watch . After a week the sunflower design started to fade and after two weeks the entire clasp to hold the watch together came clean off pointless , a waste of excitement and money 🤬"
2.0,"My husband and I were Sandy and Danny from Grease for Halloween this year. I ordered two wigs for him, as none really had great reviews and we needed them in a short time frame. We went with the other wig. This one looked awful, didn't fit on his head right, and would've taken a hairstylist in order to get it to look somewhat like the picture."
2.0,My son loved the necklace!  He wore it daily!  He was only able to wear it about 2 weeks and the clasp broke while he was just walking down the hall at school.  He wasn't pulling on it or messing with it.  He never did pill on it or play with it.
2.0,Sizing seems a little off compared<br />to other reebok pants i have. these in my opinion run VERY small. The thick parts (ankle support and front leg panel) aren’t very breathable. I wanted them for no-gi jiu-jitsu but they are just too sweltering and constrictive.
2.0,I was surprised to receive it from China. It looks good but does not fit perfectly my original Pandora bracelet.
2.0,It is a one size fits all but it is too big for me. I expected a tight fitting watch cap style but this was loose and longer than it should be.
2.0,Cheap transfer on sweatshirt.  Lettering is peeling off after not too long
2.0,The strap does not stay connected to the piece that holds the fitbit.
2.0,"I love the look but the black keeps peeling off and I have only had them less than a month. Other than that, they’re okay."
2.0,"Too large for my newborn, looked very silly on him."
2.0,"I have to say that I was so excited waiting for my band, it looks so pretty! The airplanes, the colors.. BUT POOR Quality.. It was delivered today, I’ve been using this like 3 hours and is cracking. Sad.."
2.0,"I'm 5'11 175lbs. This beanie is too small for me and constantly slips off. Fits my 6 year old who wears 10/12 size clothing. Good for kids, not for adults. Bummed because I have the matching gaiter."
2.0,Its was too small and I ordered an XL also the patterns did not match all over the shirt. It just didn't look right when I was trying it on. I returned it.
2.0,Pants are true to size but the top is HUGE.
2.0,"Nice looking watch, vut the brightness of the digital display is very weak as if yhe battery was low. I didn't replace the battery. I gifted it to someone else.  If the brightness was brighter,  I would have kept the watch."
2.0,"junk, they scratch easy, break easy too"
2.0,The magnetic jewelry extenders are great. The photo shows 4 gold and 4 silver. I received 2 of each. I'm waiting for a reply to my claim.
2.0,So I was very disappointed when I saw they were scratched up
2.0,"Runs a little small, tank top is cut VERY AWKWARDLY and materials are weird."
2.0,"For the price, they were great, unfortunately, they only lasted about 3 weeks of irregular use before breaking. I wore these about 2-3 times a week for 8 hours each use, and they broke after only three weeks."
2.0,Was good in pictures only
2.0,"I liked the style, but the colored jewels weren’t in the same order on both earrings so they didn’t match."
2.0,"The ONLY reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the colors are beautiful and it had quick shipping BUT the material is awful, very cheap, definitely a waste of money. Literally going to throw in the trash. So irritated"
2.0,BROKE WHEN PULLING IT FROM THE PACKAGING
2.0,Shirt didn't fit... I ordered 2 sizes to big and it still didn't fit.. ooh well didn't totally go to waste. my daughter loves it.. LOL
2.0,"I don't like it, only because I was expecting it to look exactly like the picture. It doesn't. The white spaces in between the roses in the picture, isn't what I received. Instead there's the metal material filled in between the rose design."
2.0,"When I received these they are super cute, but I have just worn them today and already has spots on them. They are kind of suede  so not sure on how well they clean. I will probably not buy again unless it is for a color that is barely worn."
2.0,Esta bonito el diseño pero los accesorios se miran de muy mala calidad. Y le hace falta color.
2.0,"I've used this once or twice and the material is very uncomfortable.  It has a mesh that starts to rub on you after a bit.  In my case, I measure my snoring with SnoreLab and it did not show any improvement."
2.0,Loved the distressed look and how the legs fit but the waist was too large.
2.0,"This shirt was for my daughter and it runs very small. Looks like a child’s medium, not adult medium."
2.0,"Color is great but shirt has wide collar area, you can't hide your bra straps. Shirt is  great for small size women."
2.0,"I loved the style of this but the plastic ""snap"" on the packaging dented and damaged the leaf pendant and knocked off the silver coating in at least two places. Too bad; it was quite cute."
2.0,This thing is like a huge pillowcase.  My mom is 5'6&#34; and 125 pounds.  When we took this out of the package it looked like it was a 3X.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:8947b351414c9a0b52e15d0e8380734d]] I liked the price, but you get what you pay for. When the item arrived it looked great, but it didn’t lineup. They also give you a little gift which I thought was cute.  I emailed the company per the card insert, and they gave me a code so that I could get another one, but they shortchanged me a few cents with that code. No big deal I ended up fixing this one, and not ordering another. Problem is it’s only been a couple of months and it’s now broken, but even if it wasn’t broken it started to tarnish. It’s so badly tarnished that there’s no way this could be surgical steel. I’ll give it a couple of stars for the customer service, but this company is outside of the country and not following protocol that a company in America would. Perhaps the actual insert is surgical steel, but the rest is completely tarnished as you can see by the video.<br />Spend a little more money, and just purchase elsewhere."
2.0,To tight not good quality
2.0,Very cute dress but when I put it on there was a rip right at the seem. It was not sewed very well!
2.0,The waist on these is too small!  I am so disappointed!  I will have to return them...I never even removed the tags!
2.0,"Had to put a layer of clear polish so it disn t stain my hands, but cheap and cute."
2.0,Broke after a couple of weeks.
2.0,"I open them up and they are completely tarnished , wtf ! Really disappointed"
2.0,"Maybe I misread the description, but this dress was MUCH shorter than I expected - probably 5-6 inches shorter. Aside from that, seemed like good quality but can’t be sure bc I returned it."
2.0,Fabric stiff and uncomfortable.  Size runs very small and I would not ever order again.
2.0,The straps to pull the boots up fell apart after about 5 wears.
2.0,The two parts don't close together enough and I was worried that the backing would fall off.
2.0,"The pants started to wear, developing balls on the fabric after two wears."
2.0,Day/Date Complication malfunctioned.  I did return watch without any problems.
2.0,The pants were as pictured and fit well. But after one wear the back pocket came apart.
2.0,Shows books on the side.  Have to wear a button down shirt over.
2.0,Ordered an XL and even though it stated it was XL on the tag I can't wear it. It's closer to medium. Only gets two stars as if was well made. Just not true to size.
2.0,"The fit was...weird. I probably won't wear it again I would have returned it but I needed something relatively quick and inexpensive for my grandmother's funeral. It was okay, I guess."
2.0,"The fabric was nice but it fit funny, the side slots aren’t wide enough and don’t show enough leg"
2.0,Cheap fabric. Had to return because of sheerness.
2.0,A couple of the threads were coming off and the pearl necklace was received broken!
2.0,Cheap is cheap. It's not very big. It stayed on through the night the first few nights but then I had to start tying a scarf around the edge to keep it in place. If you have natural hair and it is longer than the nape of your neck.. this bonnet will not fit you.
2.0,"These look like men’s lounge pants.... they have a button fly, fit big and they’re fairly long. I wasn’t expecting this style. The logo is more orange than yellow too. I had high hopes...."
2.0,One came broke and i decided not to gift as i was scared the other chain would be to weak. Cute other then that though
2.0,"I was pretty excited about this dress,  but after I put it on, I felt like a grandmother.<br /><br />The top was too baggy, bottom half fit alright but it was not how the picture made me imagine.<br /><br />I ordered a large."
2.0,I bought the white flowery skirt. I am 5 7 and 145 pounds.  I usually wear medium so I bought a medium.  It was way too small I think it was more like a size small or extra small.  The skirt is pretty but did not fit. Definitively size up one or two.
2.0,"This dress is really cute and may work for others but the straps were too loose and narrow and any way I tied the dress I felt like my boobs were going to come popping out of the sides. My measurements are 34 bust, 28 waist , and 33 hip and I weigh 130lbs and I'm 5'3, despite having small sized boobs this dress doesn't cover my chest adequately. I am really bummed because I wanted to take the dress to Europe to help minimize the amount of clothing I packed. Sadly, I'll be returning this dress."
2.0,very disappointed with this particular dress.. It looks s to short. I love my dresses to touch the floor and this one does not cover my ankles I am 5'5&#34;. I have it for in black and it is amazing...
2.0,Extremely small . Maybe ok for a child but not adult
2.0,Not suitable for a winter jacket. Too thin.
2.0,Was hoping the dress came in time for me to go to a wedding. The dress came but the size was the wrong size. I order a medium but got a large instead. Would have a gave better rating if the size was right but the dress was to big and I dont have time to have it ship by time it arrive it's to late. But overall the dress is really cute just the sizing is wrong.
2.0,"I checked the size comparisons online and it said that a woman's 8.5 shoe would fit a man's size 7 foot.  I bought these shoes and had to send them back because they were far too loose.  The shoe itself was very nice.  My difficulty is that I have a small foot for a man, and it is very hard to find stylish shoes in my proper size."
2.0,"Did not like the way it fit. The leather halter straps do not fit like the picture shows, it completely flattens one out."
2.0,"I'm usually a size S, but bought a M to make sure. Turned out they were too small, so returning."
2.0,"Loved these at first, thought I was going to order a few more pairs. Then, after wearing them a second time the zipper broke. I was really disappointed, but upon inspection noticed the zipper is poorly made."
2.0,"Nice quality socks, but did not provide additional warmth as advertised. Purchased for my Dad… I had high hopes for these socks to help his feet find warmth for his persistent cold toes. Not successful. Disappointment!"
2.0,These are one size bigger them others I have just for comfort and there smaller in size wrong sizing for sure
2.0,material was shear. Almost see through.
2.0,They are cute but the wire is extremely thin. They bent out of shape when I put them in the first time. Havn't worn them since.
2.0,"Sleeves were longer than usual, overal shirt length shorter than usual. Makes for a really un appealing fit. Tried it on for the 3rd time now only to take it off, give away. I mean really terrible fit.."
2.0,"Absolutely loved the fit and feel of these shorts.  Great pockets and fun fabric, however, after 2 wearing and washings (properly washed with only workout wear and line dry) they are pilling all over.  The fabric feels nice and comfortable, but the pilling looks awful.  Returning as I can't imagine how they will look in a few weeks.  Really disappointing."
2.0,Poorly made:  I ran it through one wash and the seams got all winkled up and mis-aligned.  Very disappointed with the overall quality of the product!!!
2.0,"While the jacket turned out better everything else was lackluster. The visor is just fabric so the bill doesn't stand up at all, definitely not like the photo. And this was supposed to come with a mustache but it was not in the package. The whistle is something you could get out of a quarter machine at a grocery store and the necklace for it is a ribbon you could get from an art supply store and sow together yourself for about a quarter, tops."
2.0,Cute concept but it arrived broken and looks cheap in person.
2.0,zipper completely broken upon arrival.
2.0,The socks were not supportive.
2.0,"The socks work and where the correct size for my feet, but not so much for my leg. They didnt go high enougj for comfort"
2.0,I bought for a robe. Description conflicted with pics as it said there was a zipper.  The snaps make it uncomfortable to use as a nightgown.
2.0,"By the picture I thought it would be between a small purse and a clutch.  It was bigger than I thought, the material was stiff and the top doesn't open. There is a zipper on the side at the top."
2.0,The string alone came undone. My pink colored ones turned clear from wearing not even for 3 days.. can’t believe I spent that much money on these 😡
2.0,"Was really disappointed. The waist is a lot higher than the picture shows. It has no flow to it and just lays flat even with movement. A pettycoat didn’t help either. Not sure if it’s only a problem with the green one since the other review pics look normal, but definitely won’t be wearing this one out of the house."
2.0,The material is kind of shiny and fake feeling.
2.0,"Shirt is incredibly see through, even with a tank top. Came as a short sleeved shirt not long sleeved, skirt is fine tho. Will be returning ORDER A SIZE UP"
2.0,Headband came scratched underneath the plastic cover. Extremely upset. Necklace and coin pouch are awesome
2.0,Shrunk firat time i washed it.
2.0,"Not for the 'wide girth'. it fit around my waist, but, it was already extended out and was a tight fit. It was also a little difficult to fit my 'phablet' (mobile smart phone w/ large display and protective cover)."
2.0,VERY VERY THIN you can see right through them and the material is awful
2.0,Leather felt of low quality.
2.0,it shades my eyes but design last about 8 months before it start to peel
2.0,"Smalle , I expected bigger than that"
2.0,"I purchased these because I really like the color and the buckstitching, but when I got them they fit very badly.  The toe is very narrow and is not comfortable."
2.0,Beautiful simple anklet but broke within minutes of wearing. Disappointed in this purchase!
2.0,Ordered a 2XL that fit small. Why was this filtered down to big and tall sizes if it fits snug like a regular 2XL?
2.0,"Size chart is not accurate. This was very small, but on the upside it was easy to return."
2.0,"Kind of see through, and bigger then expected."
2.0,WAIST IS SMALLER THAN AMERICAN MEASUREMENTS … DO NOT FIT
2.0,Not very durable. Several pieces broke while adding earring loop.
2.0,It was too small for my big head.  Don't know if they have sizes.  Probably should have checked that.
2.0,I am not a fan of this case. I thought it would be a little more tougher than what it is. It is really thin. I am going to get something else. More protective. My Persoanl Opinion.
2.0,"The threads are thin AND the printed, inside manufacture's info at the upper rear back collar is totally visible through the shirt !!!  cheapness"
2.0,"In person, this does not come off as a purse.  It's more like an insulated lunch bag."
2.0,Dress is cute but it's wide. Fit like a bag.
2.0,"I ended up returning this bag. The size wasn't what i was looking for. The straps were more decorative. Not what i was looking for, for every day use. It didn't feel like it would hold up that well."
2.0,"Good quality hat, just didn't suit me. Very flexible, but I didn't like it's shape and it won't conform to the shape I wanted. It just flexes back to its floppy shape. Would work for most people, I'm sure. Would make a good packable beach hat. Just didn't suit me. The height of the hat was a little short for me. I am bald with some sensitive skin cancer spots, the top of the hat, rubbed the top of my head, so I returned it. Like I said, good quality hat, just not what I was expecting. I wanted something I could shape a little differently."
2.0,"There is ruching in the front and the back, in the front it's fine. But in the back it sits really funny over your rear end. Not flattering."
2.0,"One of the earrings was missing the ring that is meant to attach the hook, so it did not hang correctly. On the other earring, the hook was on backwards. I needed these for a costume, so I removed the hooks altogether and used hooks and rings from a different set of earrings to ensure they hung properly."
2.0,Thick material. Larger than expected
2.0,very small even though I sized u three sizes larger than normal.
2.0,"great looking watch, no instructions..."
2.0,The shoes easily fell apart with the cording on the bottom after a couple of wears.
2.0,first time I ordered only got one pair. It was reorded and the second time only got one pair. The gloves were fine but I'm still lacking one pair.
2.0,Demasiado pequeño para la talla
2.0,They are like a thin piece of paper; maybe the same size as a dollar bill.<br />There is no way to tell if they work without one of my cards being compromised.<br />Worth the price? Save your money look elsewhere!!!
2.0,Sizing is always difficult when buying online. This XL is too big
2.0,The top doesn’t fit like should seem way to wide tried to tie it better see if that was the problem but nope it’s jus made that way
2.0,So beautiful- but unfortunately  turned green shortly after!
2.0,Not compression.
2.0,The orange is highlighter orange colored. The fabric is really cheap and the bottom isn’t properly hemmed. Taking this back for a return asap.
2.0,"Not impressed.  can't even get that small clip off the dial, very hard to get at.  nothing more to say, costs too much to send back."
2.0,"Not thermal and the print in the product description photos is not what I received.  Other than that, the quality is ok for knit jersey t-shirt fabric.  I am 5'11&#34; 165 lbs with a 31&#34; waist and 32&#34; inseam.  The Asian XL is my size but I am returning these because I don't like actual print.  It's too Union Jack busy for my taste."
2.0,I love the dress and I am happy with how it fits however I was sent a dress that had been previously worn or tried on as it had visible deodorant marks on it and it was inside out and unzipped. I messaged the seller about this and never received a response.
2.0,"Much cuter in the photo than in person. The shipping took a long time and the backs were studs, I needed hooks. They look very cheap. Overall very underwhelming."
2.0,The fabric is thin and see through. Also after the first wash it faded.
2.0,"This fabric is not soft or stretchy. It’s a hard polyester blend of some kind.<br />I thought it would be more like a T-shirt material.<br />Absolutely no give.<br />That said, color, form, fit, maybe a little bit larger than I wanted.<br />I will wear it when I paint.<br />Still disappointed."
2.0,I didn’t like these at all. The white is stiff and they are hard to get on. The red liner had a hard sole and they don’t fit together perfect so it felt weird to wear them. I wear 8.5 and that is what I ordered and I felt they were a little big. I didn’t want my toes sliding when they were wet.
2.0,"Ok for a quick gift, but not very high quality"
2.0,"This review is for the SISU Q1-50, basically the same watch as shown here but with a black face. Firstly this is a great looking watch. Some of the other SISU models have very large numerals on the face and look a little cartoony to me but the Q1-50 is just right. Unfortunately I feel the watch falls short in other ways.. I am a watch guy and I have some expensive ones but I still value a  nice quality low priced watch. However I was disappointed with the SISU. The quality of the watch feels poor. It's light weight and kind of tinny. Also the movement is cheap and low end. Add to that that, that this watch is missing a luminus dial and is completely unreadable in even mildly low light makes it a no-go for me.  I think the SISU Carburetor watch would be a decent buy in the $125 to $250 range but not at over $500. I would compare the SISU watches to the MVMT line of watches and should be priced similarly. The value is just not there on this one."
2.0,"The top is made weird, the straps don't go directly up the chest they are at a weird angle. The bottom fit ok, it's just cheesier than expected"
2.0,was soo small. Shirt was like a bra..
2.0,"They were cute, but fragile. The two sets that had the stone on the ends broke. Other than that, the other sets worked out ok."
2.0,Overall they are nice but I am 5’9 and they are too short.
2.0,"So I wrote a previous review about this dress. Now here's an updated one. After I opened it from the packaging I noticed the seam near the sleeve was coming undone. They poorly sewed this dress. It also came with no tags whatsoever. I really wanted to like this dress but, sadly having to return in. It also came with a disgusting smell so I washed it and thankfully it got rid of it but, can't wear it sadly."
2.0,"I have sent a request 3 times to find out the size of this product, but have yet to hear a response.  I don't want to send my pre-school with too large a backpack. Is it a 12 inch, 16 inch, ??"
2.0,Hangs below my shoulders
2.0,"These were too tight and way too long. I bought according to the sizing that they suggested and they were tight. I’m 5’4” and they were about 4 inches too long to wear with flats. Had to return it, but that was really easy"
2.0,Made for mens sizes! Ordered a 10/12 for my son and received what seemed like it was made for a large man
2.0,Cons: the top is actually cream or yellowish beige and it doesn't represent the actually photo. Material is cheaply thin. Stitching has flaws. It's all presentation and not a actually good buy it only looks nice from the photos.<br />Pros: Style
2.0,"Sizing is wrong. I ordered large so it would be very roomy and flowing... the ""large"" version of this product is very fitted in the bottoms and the top doesn't fit across the chest."
2.0,I believe the photo is different from the actual product. I ordered it twice and had same results: boxy and short. I wear a size 4/small and ordered a small and medium. I ended up returning both.
2.0,"I was disappointed when I saw the dress. It's cheaply made, smaller than expected."
2.0,The watch is beautiful but the band is garbage.
2.0,"I'm not really pleased with this shirt. I should have paid closer attention to reviews, but I didn't. Many state how the shirt isn't even the correct size. This is true for me as well. I usually order shirts a size above what I wear and it doesn't even come close to a XXXL. It is maybe an L at best. I feel misled by the context of the add. This is not XXXL."
2.0,"These are exactly as shown but I know they won’t last long. They don’t look cheap but I can feel that they are. We are keeping these because they look cute but I’ve already warned my daughter that they will not last. She bent the post within seconds of putting it in her ears. It’s worth getting for the look, but don’t expect more.<br />UPDATE: I changed my review from 3 to 2 stars because the post just broke after 2 days and she wasn’t rough with them."
2.0,Shrinks severely after 1 wash
2.0,This is definitely not chiffon. I love chiffon for its lightweight breathability & flowing fabric. This reminds me more a mens dress shirt but a tad softer.<br />It says to order true to size. I am a busty 1x so went with 2x. Which did fit across the chest but the shoulders & arms were snug. Not flowing at all.<br />Returning due to fit & material.
2.0,only reason I bought this was for more of a joke then anything.  it's a little small and the buttons and tie kinda feel like they are in the way and kinda bulky.  the size is a little small as to what I was expecting but it's more of a gag then anything else
2.0,Not really what I expected
2.0,"I purchased these masks for my twins to wear to school as I was looking for something adjustable and I’m a fun print. Unfortunately, the white plastic adjusters have already come off most of them."
2.0,I was hoping these would be a suitable replacement for the injinji but no such luck. No necessarily a bad sock just not as good and maybe a little smaller or not as stretchy.
2.0,Cheap. Broke within a month
2.0,"I loved the colors which made me but them, however the fit was a bit odd, 1 of 4 shorts fit me the right way, the other 3 were really snug"
2.0,"Pros: Price, effectiveness<br />Cons: The nose piece on the product has rough edges, which rubbed two red raw patches on either side of my nose which then scabbed.<br /><br />I'm going to attempt to cover the nose piece with kenesio tape but will not be purchasing these again, even accounting for the low price."
2.0,I liked the belt until it broke into 4 pieces 3 1/2 months after buying it. You get what you pay for....
2.0,Not enough support. Breasts seem saggy when wearing. Product seems to run large. I bought my correct size.
2.0,"I bought these for my daughter for her school uniform shoes back in August. She really liked them and wore them all the time, but before Christmas break, one of the straps came completely unattached from the shoe. It happened at school, and her teacher stapled and taped it to get her through the day, but we'll have to buy another pair of black dress shoes, which is pretty frustrating, given that she grows out of her shoes at least every year already."
2.0,You will get what you pay.
2.0,Cheap plastic frame snapped while changing a lens.  Save your money.  They lasted a few weeks.  The foam padding is lightly glued on and will slowly start slipping off leaving a sticky residue.  The lenses are pretty good though.
2.0,"Cute, but picture is deceiving. This necklace is huge!!  the bow alone is about 1.5 inches wide. I was looking for something more dainty."
2.0,I'm a 32DD and the default size of US 4-6 was way too big. Couldn't even work with it. Not worth your money because the sizing is completely off.
2.0,"With this dress it wasn't even as though I could have fixed it some how or used it some other way, But they refunded ny money quickly and let me keep the dress. I made masks with the fabric"
2.0,Disappointed because it is so flimsy. It adjusts itself. I can't even really wear it.
2.0,I ordered a size bigger just in case it ran small. Unfortunately the size bigger is still too small.
2.0,"I am really not liking this top.  It does not have the drape it appears to have in the photos, its stiff and blocky.  My first thought when I opened the package was that it looked like one of the floofy stiff dresses that people make their toddlers where on Easter that you know is irritating the kid to death but it looks pretty for pictures, except this does not look pretty.  It is just square and boxy and very unflattering on.  There are two layers of fabric that I don’t see in the photos.  The inner liner is fine, its not too stiff, but the outside piece is stiff and uncomfortable against my skin.  I do like the light green color and it is true to size and the stitching appears good, but those are the only redeeming qualities I can think of.  Even though I am a senior, I would feel like a teenager dressed in my grandmas clothes if I wore it, I will not be wearing that much I know.  This may be someone’s style, but it is definitely not mine, nor does it look like the photos depict."
2.0,"This is a very pretty ring, but I was amazed at how enormous it is.  If you like a big rocky ring, then this is the ring for you."
2.0,"Soft material but very hot definitely not recommend for warmer climates like FL, or any one work outside. Inseam/length order 34  to short compared to all other jeans measured and they were alityle less than 33 inseam/length"
2.0,The shirt was OK but the flower looked horrible and I will wear it when I work in the yard.  Does not look anything at all like the picture and is very poor quality
2.0,they are pretty but two of them lasted 1-2 days and broke.
2.0,"Nice, but look and packaged cheap"
2.0,"they are beautiful shoes but the sparkly diamonds are just two sided tape that is very sticky ,i recived them and had to push down diamonds that were sticking up. after wearing them to beach they had sand stuck in the glue/tape. Not sure what to do with them now .thought they would be so dressy and cute."
2.0,Very pretty but the clasp doesn't work very well.
2.0,"Too small, too tight. I am returning it. Very surprised because I have a small head."
2.0,ugly!
2.0,Not a great color and fabric was cheap
2.0,Its an okay product its worn out after few uses
2.0,The style is cute but the sizing chart is wrong. Order up 1 or two sizes.
2.0,Coolong lasts for a VERY short time.
2.0,They will do.
2.0,Very cheap. I bought it for a costume and it fell apart half way through the evening.
2.0,"They look nice but if you need to tighten it to keep your pants on, too much stress will break the plastic clip.  Not like the metal clips from back in the day"
2.0,They are extremely flat across the front and fit funny. Look good on but feel awkward on while wearing them.
2.0,They look great but the lenses are all scratched up.
2.0,"THE VERY FIRST TIME I TRIED TO PUSH THE PIN THROUGH THE LAPEL OF MY LAB COAT, THE PIN BENT OVER, VERY DULL POINT ON IT."
2.0,"Poor product, did not keep my hands warm at all."
2.0,"Not for anyone tall. I’m about 5’11” and these are too short. If I pull it down, the waist area is around my hips and looks odd.  Very bummed. The quality was decent, quite a few loose string to cut off but that was about it."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:4e11b161fc2fc4bc13a3710fdac9a8a4]] Was deceived in receiving this ring. The skulls are very small and hard to make out and I thought it was going to be a little smaller of a ring. This ring is huge. And really looks nothing like the picture. Not ugly but definitely not what was expected. What do you expect from costume jewelry though?
2.0,I loved them when I saw them but could not even get them on my feet as there was very little stretch I gave them to my daughter but her feet are swollen because of pregnancy and she also could not get them on because there was no stretch.
2.0,red several of these for my husband for Christmas of these for my husband for Christmas. Unfortunately after he washed them the stitching was coming out!!! Will not order again.
2.0,Cute design but cheaply made.
2.0,"I kept having to adjust it all night. Didn’t stick properly, fell off entirely at one point. Push up was sufficient for only a few minutes"
2.0,"Very cheaply made, can't really give this as a gift as it looks like dollar store chintzy product."
2.0,Too small and does not look like the picture
2.0,Looks better in the picture than in person. I was disappointed but I still wear them.
2.0,Waist area was not big enough to get through.
2.0,It’s cute but I returned it because it was see through
2.0,Fits funny haven’t worn
2.0,Cheap material the part that goes into your ear nearly falls off after one time using no good.
2.0,"Very heavy and not as small as I had hoped.  However,  well worth the discounted price just much heavier than expected."
2.0,Was hoping this would fit more snug. Should e bought a smaller size
2.0,No tumble dry. Okay this was not mentioned when I bought them. Just a chore I didn’t need….. hang drying my husbands’ underwear. Not buying again
2.0,"This is a racer-back tank top.  I don't recall that being in the description or a photo.  The material is like a ribbed undershirt material and is a bit see-through.  It was also quite snug and too long for my liking.  I returned it with no problems and the seller issued a refund quickly.  So, while I was not pleased with the tank, I was with the customer service."
2.0,"The gloves are very comfortable and look nice. The fit is good also.  I just wish they actually kept my hands warm. I was out caroling for 45 minutes in 40 degree weather.  I had to pull my fingers into the main part of the glove because they were so painfully cold.  If you do not have issues with cold hands these gloves may work for you, unfortunately for me, these are only good for driving or running errands; they will not keep my hands warm if outside for extended time in mildly cold weather."
2.0,My plan was to take this cross body on vacation this summer so I wouldn’t have to haul around my normal big purse. The colorful bright colors are what drew me to it. I thought the smaller size would work perfectly. Unfortunately the strap is way too short for a taller adult female. I’m sure I’ll be able to pass it on to one of my younger cousins so it wasn’t a complete loss of money.
2.0,Sleeves aren’t as puffy. The sleeves are a flimsy material and do not puff very much at all. There is no ruching which adds to the fullness of the sleeves... worth 19.99 but definitely not as cute as the version that’s circulating on IG with the full sleeves. I’m returning!<br /><br />Runs true to size-very stretch.
2.0,"My red watch band is not really red. Also, the pictures do not match up with what the actual product looks like. That being said, it is a nylon watchband. So there is that."
2.0,"The leg openings are  way too big in comparison to the rest of the suit. An elephant would have extra room in those openings. I am not wearing the suit, donated it instead"
2.0,"Nowhere as nice as pictured. Upper body is close to size,but very narrow in lower half. Fabric is rough and lace is cheesy. Very disappointing."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:e556f560dc59037182afe7e86ae380c8]] Very cute but the screws came off after three days and they have completely fallen apart.  The seller was kind enough to send a replacement pair but the screws are coming off again. #Sad
2.0,The shoes don't have a back that will keep them on your feet.
2.0,Cheaply made. I won’t be buying these again. Thin like tissue paper.
2.0,I had high Hope's for these gloves. They do warm your hands but they make my skin itch and feel very uncomfortable.
2.0,"The pendant itself is very beautiful,  The chain was just so small it wouldn't fit a small child's neck. So the gift it was supposed to be did not work out..."
2.0,"We ordered size 4-6 and they were gigantic on my daughter. When I looked closely at the packaging I saw the size sticker said 4-6 but it was stuck on top of another sticker that said size 10-14. I sent them back and asked for a replacement, but they sent another set of gigantic tights that were mislabeled. Nice colors and look durable but sadly we’re going to need to look elsewhere."
2.0,these are so pretty BUT they are 3 piece earrings.. the back of the earring isn’t actually connected to the pretty back piece that’s supposed to show. it takes some patience putting on and making sure you’ve got it on right.
2.0,sent back...way too big
2.0,Did not like the look of track suit for my son. I kept it for myself bc it looks like a lady's track suit with the sparkly pockets and small fit.
2.0,The fit is fine but the length is too short. If I try working out in these tanks they just ride up. I would not recommend.
2.0,The blue dress is absolutely gorgeus. But not wearable as the slip underneath is mesh and completely seetrough. Too bad I really was excited about this.
2.0,Could see through the material and to clingy looking.  Returned it.
2.0,It’s very cute but it’s made is some sort of fabric that gets cuts easily ... after 2 weeks mine looks very used and old
2.0,Returned.  Did not fit.
2.0,"I didn't look closely enough, but the pearls aren't individually knotted. Also, this style of clasp with 3 strands is very difficult because of the bunching. So close to being perfect! Grr!"
2.0,Not as cute as the picture. It looks like an old lady top
2.0,Is this a childs beanie? I have a small head and I barely got this on my dome.
2.0,Disappointed the product is see thru. I wanted lightweight.  Husband will wear with shorts under it to begin with - he said they were ok. I would of returned them.
2.0,"Tried these on right after washing them. Cold water and low tumble dry. Disappointing. Warning - these run a size small and are very small in the thighs. Sat down and the bottom seam pulled loose. Really liked the over design, but the finish is poor. Also lost one of the decorative caps on the draw string. The fly is just decorative - there's no opening at all."
2.0,Shorter than expected. Fit great. Thin fabric. Only good for a one time use.
2.0,"Soy size S , pero se lo di a mi hija ella es size L...a mi me quedo superrrrr altooo y muy flojo en realidad es grande , mi hija es L...y le sirvio el S !!!"
2.0,"In the picture it's a lovely pink/magenta color, and in reality, it's an ugly mauve color. No offense to people who like mauve. It's just not what I ordered."
2.0,"Nice, but cheap watch as expected. However, it’s huge and there’s no way of adjusting the band despite the fact that the manual says it comes with a tool so you can adjust it. This means you have to go and get it adjusted in a shop which will cost you more then the watch itself, so that’s a complete waste."
2.0,"My chest was falling out and not in a good way, my suggestion is to get the next size up."
2.0,"More cheaply made, cheap-material junk from China flooding the marketplace.  While the costume looks like Ash from Pokémon, the materials feel like something ground from stone.  Horrible rough and uncomfortable for my 6 year old son.<br /><br />In addition, the glove fingers were too long (completely covered his fingers and folded over), so I had to cut them.  That’s when I noticed that the stitching isn’t even consistent.  If the stitching for the fingers is correct, then the stitching for the wrist is inside out, or vice versa.<br /><br />Incredibly disappointing heading into Halloween"
2.0,"So if you look at the picture closely (as I did after I ordered these boots) you will notice the sole looks like real cheap plastic.  Well, it is.  Additionally, the sole doesn't cover the entire bottom of the foot.  Right where your arch is, the sole just disappears.  This makes for zero comfort.  I only wore the boots for like one minute so keep that in mind but this is at most a $40 boot, not $250 or even $80."
2.0,You have to mash these hoops to get them to stay in and then they still fall out.
2.0,The one positive thing I can say is that it is beige. However it wasn't what I expected at all and it was a little bit cheaply made. It's something I can wear around the house and be okay but fashionably out no
2.0,"Shirt is a nice feeling material. The vinyl was white but after one wash, the maroon shirt color bled onto the vinyl. So now it’s a light pink. Whatever. But still annoying. Makes me think it’s cheap vinyl. This has never happened to any other vinyl appliqué shirt I have"
2.0,"&#34;Red&#34; color is definitely raspberry, not the deep red shown on my monitor. Fabric is VERY polyester-y. I was looking for a top just like this one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N0QA1XQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1, which fits great and is of really nice, stretchy fabric -- this is not it! As others have stated, it's huge. I ordered 2 sizes down (I wear a 2X in the referenced top, or a 22 typically) and it fits like a trash bag with a drawstring."
2.0,Got about three wears from each before the sticky strip on the heel wore out and they're useless now.
2.0,Smaller than expected...still pretty
2.0,Won't stay tight. This loosens within minutes of putting on and my watch slides and turns on my wrist. I got a different velcro one that works much better.
2.0,they feel kind of cheap.
2.0,"So I got these for my daughter who loves yoga and work out pants.  When she saw the pic she was looking forward to trying them out.  She is about 5 ft 6 inches tall, 125 lbs and usually wears a SMALL in shorts.  I ordered her a MeDIUM because its China and everything they sell runs very very small.  Needless to say, they fit her but she did not like the high waisted fit or the gathering of the material in her buttocks area.  She found them unflattering and will not wear them again.<br /><br />To each is own but if you are picky then I would pass on this one.."
2.0,"Runs a tad small.. But if I had gotten a large it would have been too big.<br />I got a Medium. I am 130lb 5'7"" and a 36D . size 6 in dress and pants .<br />So the suit itself is cute.  It is a cheeky suit so if you dont want your bum hanging out the sides this is not for you.<br />I wish others would have posted a pic with their review, so here is mine.<br />It's 20$ .. So you pretty much get what you pay for .  cheap suit. But worth it I guess."
2.0,Nails are glued on every which way. Better off making something on your own. If it was not so cheap I would of returned it.
2.0,"wanted to love it, once wearing it, it looks horrible on top due to how loose it is and just doesnt look right. the bottom part of it is fine. had to return the dress."
2.0,This product is super light and easy to use. The magnets need to be more powerful because after about two weeks of use the band comes detached or lose multiple times a day. It also is a sweat magnet and gets a sour smell daily. Would not purchase again.
2.0,"I like the design ,but it's somewhere between European and US sizing...made in China. ( not Chinese sizing cuz I would never fit. Ots just slightly small for me but I'm admittedly overweight now. I'll diet cuz I like it lol"
2.0,"If it isn’t broke, don’t fix it! Right?!<br /><br />I have had three pairs of these gloves, and they were my all-time favorites. Unfortunately, when I pulled out my winter clothes this season, I couldn’t find them, so I bought another pair.<br /><br />They changed them! In what I would assume was an effort to improve these gloves (which clearly did not need improvement), they switched out the thin liner fabric for the same soft fluffy fabric that is on the outside of the gloves. They are now so bulky, I need a size up! If that wasn’t bad enough, the liner is a size or two smaller than the exterior glove!  My fingers come to the end of the liner, but the finger tips of the gloves flop all over the place. Using them with my phone or other touch screen device is impossible - it’s like texting wearing over mitts!<br /><br />Manufacturer, if you are reading this, please go back to your old design! They were perfect!"
2.0,I’m a dress size 16/18 and I really thought these would fit great but they don’t.<br />They are tight in the waist and not comfortable.<br />It is a heavy rough linen material.<br />I am disappointed because I thought these would be comfortable pants for the spring and maybe Summer.<br />I suggest ordering a size up.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful.
2.0,Shorts were smaller than expected. Outfit runs smaller.
2.0,#1 it was ordered in December & received in FEBRUARY.  #2 it was a gift - she told me it was wonderful!
2.0,"Huge, cheap"
2.0,in picture look  different
2.0,"Too small, I bought for my husband but it's more the size of a woman's purse.  Way too small for a man."
2.0,The zipper is kind of cheap on it. I don't think it will last very long
2.0,"Did not fit well, looked cheesy when received."
2.0,"I ordered this item in a larger order, but I didn't receive in a reasonable time frame. Now I understand that right now there could be delays and problems, but usually you're notified, I was not. In the time that the order was supposed to be delivered and today, we had a lot of rain in my area. Would've been nice to test the item. I'll update the next time it rains.<br />If receiving my item late wasn't bad enough, they sent the wrong color. I ordered a white umbrella, but I received a gray umbrella. I did not exchange it because it took so long to deliver that I didn't want to go through that again. To say I'm not happy so far would be an understatement.<br />So far, the features of the umbrella are interesting. It's a bit heavy, so I'm hoping ""wind proof"" is accurate. The opening mechanism is pretty nice. Pressing the button once extends and opens the umbrella. Pressing the button twice closes the umbrella but doesn't retract it. The curved handle is comfortable so far, but I can't really test it until it rains.<br /><br />I'll update my review when it rains."
2.0,"The edges are just serged, with no finishing.  Lots of strings hanging off.  Pretty sure it will fall apart the first time it's washed.  Oh, BTW, washing instructions say hand wash and dry flat - yep, for a t-shirt. Feel like I overpaid for the likely one-time wear shirt."
2.0,"So very disappointed that this broke off the ring holding it on my Dogs collar the very first day he wore it.  It was a rainy day, so he has in the house being rather lazy."
2.0,I will be returning this skirt. The fabric is cheap and the pleats are not well defined. They end up losing shape and looking weird
2.0,Not true to size. Order two sizes up for fit. Shrank after 1 cold water wash.
2.0,Fits way to Large.
2.0,Fits too loose
2.0,"I wish there were more pockets. Only one pocket can accommodate 💵 dollars in an orderly manner. All other pocket are too short to arrange bills. The coin compartment is so narrow, I’m barely able to take out a penny. It is a nice wallet but not carefully thought out. Overall I like it and will continue to use it.<br />UPDATE!!!<br />I now give this 2 stars. The lining inside came apart, I don’t know if this was just glued on but I’m very disappointed. It is also very difficult to take out and put back the credit cards. Unfortunately for me I ordered TWO of these and gave one as a gift. I’m so embarrassed now."
2.0,The item has some damage Can be fixed Unfortunately the mask is super uncomfortable And will need patting around it to make it work
2.0,Ugly and style doesn’t work
2.0,"My feedback focuses mainly on the size of the top, it is toooooo small ! I weigh 167 pounds and measure 1.68 meters I use a DD cup, so not even in my wildest dreams I can use a top like the one supplied with this swimsuit . Only the bottom fits perfectly but the top don't.<br />If you have curves, buy it only if you can modify it with some sewing odyssey."
2.0,"the plastic is not good and when putting it on, it leaves creases in the plastic. I would not purchase again."
2.0,The brim would never hold a shape and always in my face.  Could not wear it.
2.0,"super cheep. 3 where broken on arrival, not fixable (at least given the value), 2 more broke while I was wearing them, and I though 5 of them away because they looked cheep. Replaced the chain and clasp on the triangle one with some stuff from joans and wear it often. mostly, not worth the hassle. 2 stars because 1 of them I like a lot and the product showed on time."
2.0,"It was too small and not worth it to return, so I blessed someone else with it."
2.0,"I think this runs very tight, however that may be tight to cut bounce.  The second closure in the back feels unnatural.  I am scratching it a lot.  I don’t think it’s really itchy, just I’m not use to it.  I expected a very lightly padded cup.  This is not.  Just very tight against my chest.  Not a good feeling.  A size up would be better.  I need to see how it feels after a few washings.  It may loosen."
2.0,the material is rash and uncomfortable
2.0,"They are not Men’s sizes.  The medium I ordered for my 19 year old son, looks like they are for a 5 year old."
2.0,"Huuuuge diameter wise. I even used their measurements to determine how big the lenses would be around before I ordered, still ended up being way bigger than I expected. Ordered the best size diameter, still way to big. Needed them for a costume so the price was right but not the best description of their product"
2.0,"Ordered size M in American flag print and found that top and bottom fit as expected. However, the bottoms have a very skimpy cut so decided to return."
2.0,its not the sellers fault i just dont like the feeling on my neck
2.0,I have underwear thicker than these.  Sending back.  Horrible for the price.  Would pay $5 maybe to sleep in but would not wear these out in public.
2.0,"I bought this product as a gift for my mom. After only having it for 2 days and wearing it once, it ripped. I ordered a replacement, same size an XL and she was sent a small in the XL box. Although she said it was comfortable the one time she worn it, I’m highly disappointed that the replacement was the wrong size."
2.0,Looks wide but pretty narrow at the front. My toddler hates them.
2.0,"The style is beautiful, but the material was cheap."
2.0,"cheaply made, and the gold color lace doesn't match the same color as the chains"
2.0,I got a small and they were still too big
2.0,"Love the coat but sleeves are too small.  I read the reviews and ordered large, which is a size up.  Everything fits fine other than the sleeves. It’s even hard to put it on.  Since I really like the coat,  I ordered XL and guess what: the size is exactly the same as large.  Had to return this one too.  What a shame."
2.0,"Dress is pretty. Very flowy, but the arm holes are not big enough. They often dig into my arms creating a very unflattering look. There is ZERO stretch on the straps so the slide down my arms. I am unable to wear this dress in public because of the issues with the straps. Fine as a cover up at a close friends house, but nothing more. Disappointing."
2.0,Did not fit true to size at all. I even bought it bigger than needed.
2.0,"I REALLY wanted to like these gloves, but they are definitely not thorn proof! That’s the main reason I purchased them."
2.0,Too small in the bust for a Xlarge size
2.0,"I wish I had opened the dress sooner, because I would have returned it. I never tried it on, so I can’t comment on the fit. Now that I’m stuck with it I’ll give it away. The material is what I dislike the most.  Dry cheaply made in my opinion."
2.0,"These are nice but they break very easily, my sister broke a few just trying to open them up."
2.0,"Poor quality.  No pockets.  Short. I would've returned, but my daughters wanted to wear these ""matching"" outfits to a party so I tore them apart and altered."
2.0,Really cheap fabric. Probably made from a parachute. I don't want it next to my skin or in my closet.
2.0,"It runs very big and is very, very poor quality."
2.0,Cheap in EVERY way.
2.0,It broke after a week. The grommets weren't secured properly.
2.0,My son really liked this bag... until the side seam ripped after his first day using it. Would not recommend.
2.0,It’s very pretty but runs too small!
2.0,Too small and inside is already tearing:(
2.0,Fabric isn’t that great quality and the neck collar is heavy so it doesn’t want to stay open.
2.0,"Just on a plastic board, not as nice looking in person. Way over priced for what it is..."
2.0,I felt that the material was cheesy and that the straps were too close together. When I put it on the straps looked like a “V”.
2.0,"Ordered a small and it was just too baggy. I ordered based on the products size chart. It should have fit. 33""B 27""W I was going to need a belt. So, I returned it. The dress looked like the picture."
2.0,One size in this item was not meant for an average sized person. Fits like a shroud.
2.0,I'm 5'10 and weight 140lbs. I'm swimming in this dress. I ordered a Medium.
2.0,Ordered my normally size and they were too big. They aren't super flattering as reviews suggest. Nothing special. Color is much darker in person. Not a lulu knock off. They are however comfortable and squat proof.
2.0,"Its just for fun. You cant pretend use it in &#34;real life&#34;. But, honestly, what can yu expect for a few bucks? Come on!!! Price = Quality"
2.0,"The fabric was okay, not as fine of a linen I expected.  The width and the length was much skimpier that I wanted.  I like my linen scarves to be able to loop around my neck and have enough fabric hanging down on both sides.  With this scarf, I’ll just hang it around my neck.  It’s okay.  Just not as big or as fine as I wanted.  But it is white and that’s been really hard to find."
2.0,The pink ones are cute. But the white ones keep turning so you see the felt back. Which is really irritating. They look exactly like pictured the lightweight they're not bad little overpriced for the quality.
2.0,"Short, even at it's longest i feel that my legs are being pulled up."
2.0,"I think that, if intact, this would be a lovely necklace.  Unfortunately, when I ordered it, it was broken in several places — and when Amazon sent me a replacement, it was broken as well.  The petals of the flowers are just too fragile for the lack of padding that their packaging provides."
2.0,The sleeves are too short.
2.0,Two stars. Because after reading the reviews I chose to go three sizes up and it still didn't fit. The sizing on this product runs extremely small even for China sizing. I am normally a large. And I chose a 3xl and I couldn't even get it above my knees.  Extremely disappointed. I'll definitely be looking for another product.
2.0,They fell apart before we could use them.
2.0,"Need a cross body bag for travel. This is a pretty bag and it's the right size, but the latch is very poor quality.  It's a magnet and it hardly holds in place. For travel, I would prefer a more secure latch for obvious reasons. I had to return it since I cannot use it for my intended purpose."
2.0,"I should have paid attention to the reviews I read before buying it. It has been less than two months since I made this purchase, and the ring is now turning YELLOW, confirming that the materials are cheap and poor quality"
2.0,"I gave this wallet 2 stars because it does not have a pocket large enough to fit bills in. Considering the primary function is to carry money, it's a very large flaw in my opinion. You have to fold them in half and jam them into a small slot. I've never seen a wallet like that but it's extremely inconvenient.<br /><br />Another consideration (I didn't mark down for this) is that you can't use RFID keycards in this wallet. I use one to enter my building at work and didn't put 2 and 2 together that the RFID technology would block the cards from giving access to my building."
2.0,Color dulled and faded quickly
2.0,"You get what you paid for. They are horrible, they hurt my eyes."
2.0,"These pajamas are cute, but not comfortable at all. Also the material is not soft."
2.0,"Great colors. Style is fine. I cannot get the snaps to close. When I push them together to close the robe, nothing happens."
2.0,"Tarnished after one wear, chain went completely brown"
2.0,"Very tiny chain. Was nice color but very tiny and fragile. I knew it was going to be small but didn't expect to be that tiny. I guess for 26.00 these days, that's to be expected ."
2.0,"After looking at their size chart I realized I didn’t fit a standard size. I saw you can send them your measurements to get a custom dress. It took me a while to get ahold of them. But when I did I sent the company my measurements, which measurements were taken by a local professional seamstress. I sent all the measurements and when I got the dress it was extremely too long, the shoulder width was too wide, and the arm holes were way too small same as the busy, too small. I email them and ask them to see if I can send it back or what to do because it was for a wedding. I had to either pay for shipping or loose out. But in order to get a new dress it wouldn’t arrive on time even though I ordered the first one months in advance. I took the dress to a local seamstress and got it altered. It was an additional $80 to do that.  Overall the dress at the end looked beautiful but it was an annoyingly expensive and long process"
2.0,Fits large. Returned!
2.0,The shirt is two sizes too small and is a weird boxy cut.
2.0,The material didn’t feel nice
2.0,Brought an 8.5 because I wear an 8 but should've gotten a 9.
2.0,"Good looking bag, but it is now in the Goodwill bag.  It has two sides (in the middle), each with a zipper, and it is just impossible to find things in this purse.  The linings of the two pockets are large, and sort of overlap, and so I grope in one, then in the other, and just have trouble finding items, esp small items in the bottom, but even glasses,  Just did not work for me."
2.0,"1st review ever. Love the material and fast delivery. Once it was open it read &#34;best gift ever&#34;. Keeping it because it's still adorable, just wanted what I paid for."
2.0,I only heard it two days and the clip attaching the strap to the bag broke in half.
2.0,Purchased this product in August and the strap has already popped.
2.0,Very flimsy and edges not finished.
2.0,Definitely could have used in a smaller size..<br />Runs big
2.0,"Length of shorts was not what I expected,and really not my type."
2.0,"The look is a bit different than pictured. Cheap material. The blue strands out a lot more in real life. Purchased for a Christmas party, but with it being primarily red and lots of blue... it doesn't have a Christmas look."
2.0,"Compared to another brand XXL sock, these were 5 inches smaller. Giving to goodwill as they aren't wearable."
2.0,"Cheap feel, seemingly not leather or close to it. Vinyl feeling texture."
2.0,"I really want to like it. The band has limited stretch so you need to loosen the strap a lot before it will slip over your hand, and there’s the problem right there, because it’s doesn’t adjust smoothly and easily. It’s just not as simple and easy as a fold over Velcro band. It may be just more suitable for someone with smaller wrists and hands."
2.0,Top fits but bottoms are way too big.
2.0,Item is smaller than true size. Ordered a 2x and the one I received is more like an extra large.
2.0,"It’s ok, but the soles are cheap compared to similar shoes, they will have no traction on ice."
2.0,This item is NOT genuine leather (hide of an animal)! At most it’s Pleather.
2.0,Light weight but not for NYC cold winds disappointed. Cheap looking too
2.0,They are pretty.  But too small.  A child would fit this<br /><br />Way over priced
2.0,I would love it if it actually fit :(
2.0,Much smaller then expected model must have very small ears
2.0,They are so heavy they are uncomfortable and the stone part is so large I can't wear them in my 3 piercings in my upper ear. They won't fit side by side. The stones are pretty to look at.
2.0,Very thin and flimsy.  I think the black decoration part of the keychain may not be attached after a season of using it for a keychain.
2.0,Very cute. Liked the style but they were completely see through. Could see my neutral colored thong underwear through them. I Wanted to like them but my butt said no. Ah well!
2.0,"One good thing is that this suglasses good color of glasses but the frame color is quite nice.<br /><br />I did not like, bacause it is not the same as on picture"
2.0,"Like the others said, this is an adult hat which seems weird. The quality is fine... but I don’t know how many grown women would wear it. Don’t buy it for an older child, they’ll swim in it"
2.0,"Pros:  Very attractive.  Cons: I only give this necklace 2 stars because the chain seemed to flimsy and my concern was that it might break, therefore, unfortunately I had to return it."
2.0,I dont understand why clothe are made L but the chest doesnt fit a L. Pretty dress but my chest was suffocating.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:982110abcabc083e8184c54ce5ba0ca9]] I have bought two of these wallets, each about two years apart.  They are great up to the two year mark, but then the plastic cover for a driver's license falls out.  That's two different wallets each two years failing at the same point.  The plastic ID cover is held in by glue, and really should be sewn in.  The leather peals back and the ID falls out.  Luckily I saw it fall it, otherwise I'd be out more that just the $65 for a wallet time two."
2.0,"I ordered pink but received cream color.  They are too loose and keep falling off whenever anything like the collar of my jacket touches them.  They feel very nice, but don't stay on for me."
2.0,"I like the body of the dress but the sleeves are absolutely terrible. They’re stiff and look like they belong on a t-shirt, not a dress. I will end up returning it."
2.0,"This mount has one critical oversight. Unless you wear the headband like a blindfold over your eyes, the camera will point up into the air, above your path of travel. If this had a rotating camera mount like the goggle strap mount, it would be much more useful. But as it is, this mount is good for capturing video of the sky and not much else."
2.0,Cheap hat with cheaper iron on insignia. Made in China. It says buckle closure. It is not. It is a snap closure
2.0,Came with no instructions. Plating coming off on band in less than a week. Will be sending back.
2.0,Extremely bigger
2.0,"loved this bag and got tons of compliments! started falling apart right after the return period.<br />cover peels and strap broke, they reminded me of the return policy when I tried to exchange it."
2.0,"look cheap, wore once"
2.0,Had a hole in the leg as soon as I put them on.
2.0,Not a fan.  Seems more like a nightgown.  Shiny material and color was more pink than red.  Returning
2.0,Zipper does not zip back-and-forth very smoothly. The wristlet part broke with in the first six weeks. It is a very cute pattern and design but it is not well-made and very cheap. I guess I got what I paid for. Will not repeat business for this item and do not recommend it. The key pattern is not worth the poor quality
2.0,Did not like.  Older and wanted to protect my arms from scrapes
2.0,Was very excited and loved using it. Made keeping up with my reading glasses easier for about 2 weeks. Then the left side kept coming lose and my glasses would fall out. No amount of tightening would last longer then an hour. Very disappointed in the quality.
2.0,"If you love to struggle reading smeared and tiny words, then this bracelet is for you. Poorly made."
2.0,"Super lindos, son para llaves grandes, justo las que me hacian falta.<br /><br />Le había dado 5 estrellas. Pero son de mala calidad. Una vuelta no resistió el silicon."
2.0,Overall just poorly made— I was excited about it and when I opened it the sleeve had a huge whole where it just wasn’t sewn in correctly.
2.0,Was a different one verses the one I seen. But it was a great feeling fabric
2.0,"This dress arrived severely creased. I ordered  a size based on the size chart but it was too big around the waist. The material is itchy & harsh, and snags easily. The neckline was lower than appears in the photo. Disappointing!"
2.0,The pockets are very thick and they tend too start showing after you wear them for 30 mon
2.0,I returned them . Just not my cup of tea
2.0,Looks good but not comfortable as the the material is too stiff n does not lay out or hang nicely
2.0,Will not buy products from China
2.0,Too bulky for me
2.0,Much longer than expected. I'm only 5'2&#34; but this was still hitting my just above the ankle. Poor hemming. Low price.
2.0,"Very pretty and seem like good quality, but I ordered a 0g and they are WAY to big cant even try to put them in, they almost seem like 3-4 sizes to big very disappointed I even double checked to see if I ordered the right size and I did."
2.0,"So, bought one, it broke. Bought another, it broke. they lasted 3 months and broke. Obviously, not well made."
2.0,Only if you have to
2.0,pattern not great
2.0,This ring was purchased as a man’s wedding ring.  It’s absolutely perfect for a man with thin fingers!! The picture doesn’t show that it’s an open braid which is even more striking.  We both love it!<br /><br />Update:  got married and both bands lost stones within the FIRST day!! I wrote the seller and got NO response...
2.0,Thin and not supportive
2.0,"Fit is short and wide (needs a couple extra inches of length and it would be GREAT) and the lettering seems like it is likely to peel off after a few washes. I had to return it due to quality reasons. Too expensive to have printing coming off. Bummer, because it looked so cute!"
2.0,"Fabric is VERY cheap (be careful when ironing it. If you use too hot a setting, it will melt), and it is not anywhere near as full of a skirt as the picture makes it look. I kept it because of a time constraint for the outfit it was for, but $21 was too much to spend on a an item this cheaply made skirt."
2.0,"These are huge! Definitely not a 13, probably a size 2y.<br /><br />Seller shipped item 2 weeks late.<br /><br />I did appreciate they put a toy in the box when they did ship the item, my son enjoyed the toy."
2.0,"I like the style, feel and fit of the jeans, but the zipper is cheap and didn't no work, It broke. I had to have one installed in my jeans. So beware!!"
2.0,The hardware on this keychain was gold- not silver as pictured. Luckily I had an extra keychain that I didn’t want eating around and the tools to exchange the gold to silver hardware because I didn’t want to deal with the return. Still very disappointed because I took the time to make sure it was silver and still got a gold one. Other than that super cute.
2.0,Seems like a nice product but doesn't fit any sunglasses ear pieces that I have.  Gave it to the cat to play with.  Not sure if it floats or not.
2.0,it is not what i thought- I thought the ropes were all separate chains - they are one piece so it is stiff and clunky.<br />It was super cheap so i did not return it. Gave it  2 stars because it could be used for a Halloween costume.
2.0,"This is by far the worst made product I have ever had the misfortune to buy. The design is ok, the ice packs that are not manufactured by the vest and can be independently bought in their own wearable pouches are amazing. One of the three clasps in the front did not actually lock and has been useless since the day I received it. Every flexible stretchable band on the sides of the vest is in a useless adjustable buckle that will release the band at the first sign of strain. Every flexible stretchable band on the vest, not just the sides is stitched in to vest with no sport or securing of the fabric of any kind, by end of week 2 of use 2 of the bands created giant black fuzz balls incide the vest and when they were removed the band was no longer a band, similar to the overstretched waistband. The first day I put it on the vest, one of shoulder strap's stitching fell apart leaving only one useful strap, I restitched it by hand.<br /><br />I have emailed the manufacturer cite with questions about the ice packs. Getting no response I searched the webs and found all the large and medium packs can be purchased for about $45 but no one makes the shoulder packs.<br /><br />Overall the vest would be a great product if it was correctly stitched together, all parts actually worked and didn't come with useless adjustable buckles.<br /><br />Don't buy this, unless you want to throw away this money or are going to restitch the vest in its entirety."
2.0,"Good in concept, but lens quality is poor. I used salivia on the inside to protect against fogging, which is standard practice for snorkel and diving gear. It immediately ruined the lens. I read that the manufacturer states not to touch the inside. Perhaps if I had followed that advice, it would work well. Be aware of that when purchasing."
2.0,No buckles in the back of shoe like in picture
2.0,"I loved this dress, it came just as pictured but not as described. I read the product descriptions very carefully and selected a style and color that was described as having functional buttons, but when it came it did not have functioning buttons. I am having to return, but I would still like to order the same dress but WITH FUNCTIONAL BUTTONS. If there is a way to contact the seller to ensure this prior to shipping I would def order it in several colors with the functioning buttons"
2.0,"I really wanted to like this shirt, but it’s oddly made. It was tight getting over my head then seemed to fit, but once I raised my arms the shirt lifted up to my chest. There’s an odd material lining the shirt, making it tight and causing lifting."
2.0,It is a shame of how beautiful this cardigan is. Mine arrived ripped. I chose to get my refund instead because I was so heart broken about the rips on it. It is very pretty the color is a bit darker than the picture but it is adorable.
2.0,looked and felt pretty cheap. The picture looked much better than the actual item
2.0,This sweatshirt is TOO BIG.  Sleeves are baggy.  Shoulder seams are too low on the arm.  Not very flattering.  Had purchased this as a Christmas present.  Wish I could return it.
2.0,"When I first opened these, I was excited.  They are a nice soft and thick material.  However; if you have any stretch when wearing biker shorts or leggings, I do not recommend.  I wear between a XL and XXL in all leggings, capri leggings, and biker shorts that I have.  I wear one or the other every single day.  These fit fine as far as getting them on.  They are not as high waisted as I would like, especially in the back (if you have a larger back area).  The issue is that since they are having to be stretched, they were completely see through.  I was shocked since they are so thick, but you can definitely see through them.<br /><br />If they do not stretch to fit you, you may be fine."
2.0,I had ordered other mr clean gloves in size large so that is what I ordered. These gloves are large but very difficult to get on and the cotton lining is very thin. Will not buy again.
2.0,The crotch was very low and not much stretch.not real happy with them
2.0,"Looks cute, soft fabric but runs really small."
2.0,Fit within the package is extremely variable and all are either too short or within 1/4&#34;.
2.0,"Cute necklace but poor quality. Maybe a set above a quarter machine, and that's not even a big step up!"
2.0,I washed it once and it basically fell apart.  I had to sew the pocket and inside my sleeve ripped all up the seam.
2.0,"These are cute but obviously very cheaply made. Inadequate product for the price. The selvage is not turned under, leaving raw, poorly stitched edges on entire top. I would never order them again & only kept them because I had no other sweatsuit."
2.0,Returned as they were way too long
2.0,"Bought 2 pair both pair of earrings were broken.  I didn't look at them until I was about to give them away and it was to late to send back,  Check the product soon as you give them the necklace was fine."
2.0,Cute socks but very small. I wear large. These are definitely a small.
2.0,The horseshoe septum’s were too tight to open up. And the clickers were tough as well.
2.0,Just didn't care for this dress at all.<br />I'm a standard medium in everything I buy on Amazon.<br />This was very tight. Won't be wearing it.<br />Not sure I know anyone to give to.<br />I'm 5 ft 2 inch and 125 lbs
2.0,"It's a great idea, but they are too small and you cannot get them on the heel"
2.0,"Can't close them, wouldn't recommend"
2.0,"One side printing ONLY.  Please know only one side of your scarf will be printed, and there is a very negative back side effect to the scarf.  This important fact should be disclosed.  I will be returning this item, which was needed as a Christmas present."
2.0,"One of the 2 sets arrived tarnished! This was hugely disappointing. They are smaller than they appear and unclasp easily. The second set is holding up ok after a few days so far but if I touch my ear at all, it unclasps."
2.0,Its pretty but its constructed poorly. The wings are very flimsy and go in different directions.
2.0,My son loves lime green and the grinch so this would've been a perfect gift IF it ran right with the sizes. The biggest size 3X-4X is still like a Large and cannot be worn by anyone in my home. SMH....
2.0,"Returned it, the fit was way off, the fabric was so weird feeling, clingy, and not what I could recommend ."
2.0,Great design but the outfit was too big.
2.0,It wasn’t even the right color ordered dark blue it was gray and gray wasn’t even one of the colors the material was really bad it was not worth my money 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
2.0,These fit but are not very comfortable at all and don't provide very good support. When I put my clothes on over them they don't give me a very good shape--look saggy and lumpy.
2.0,The frames hurt the top of the ears. Need to be covered with soft rubber material in my opinion. I will not recommend. Sorry.
2.0,Super large and nothing like the photo
2.0,"I bought these 2 times (not a sellers issue, it's with the brand) first ones I bought were the Xs/s fits 4-6 because my ring size is 5 3/4 they were really small and started to cut the circulation off to my finger. I went onto Amazon and bought the m/l fits 7-9 and they are to big; they slip right of my finger when it's held down. I can't find an in-between option like a s/m.<br />I like the look and the idea of the silicone rings but just can't find the correct fit for me."
2.0,"I needed a short, cool cover-up and was hoping this would fit the bill. Unfortunately, although the fabric is really cute, the type of fabric is too hot and the bust area was so tight, it was very uncomfortable to wear. The size suggestions are not really accurate.  I am not overly 'busty"" so that was surprising. It's going to the donation box."
2.0,Did not come with the name brand on the side.it did not come with what the pictures showed.
2.0,I ordered a few of these bracelets for friends and I never received the pink set. I didn’t end up requiring them though.
2.0,One of them broke on the first day that I used it. I'm 7 days outside the return window and so it looks like I'm out of luck.  They looked nice and were easy to use before one of them broke.
2.0,"Will never buy this type of band ever, it will ruin your clothes"
2.0,i wore this for the 1st time the other night but i doesnt stay in place on hand and its not adgustable either!!! wont order again
2.0,"Unless you have a very VERY large chest, stay away from this suit.  The suit itself (minus the chest portion) fits well and looks good.  I am 5'7 and 180 lbs and I ordered a XXXL. The bottom half fit well.  The chest portion of the suit is just not realistic.  It has an underwire and the cups are formed and rock hard.  It looked almost cartoonish.  If the suit had not been so cheap, I would have returned it immediately, but returning it just isn't worth it to me.  I am going to work on the chest area to see if I can modify it to make it not look like torpedoes."
2.0,"Very inexpensive, but too rough and uncomfortable for me, I have to return them.."
2.0,Too small didn’t fit my wrist.
2.0,"They stay on, it's just for like 3 minutes.  Cute but way more work than  anyone wants to go through."
2.0,So tight<br />I couldn’t wear it
2.0,This product says the XL should fit a 16-18. I am only 5'6&#34; and a pretty slim 190 lbs. and have not problems fitting any other 16-18 dresses. This was so small in length that if I just leaned over a little you could see my hind end. You would only be able to wear it if you are 5'2&#34; or under and if you are that small but need a 16-18 you will never be able to wear this for anything but a fancy looking frilly shirt. Not to mention it is almost completely see through. NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL. WILL BE RETURNING ASAP!
2.0,The only good thing is the fabric
2.0,Very pretty but the fabric is super flimsy and see through. Im going to return it.
2.0,The watch would be great for a child. Just too small for an adult.
2.0,Not a sturdy product
2.0,Too tight... Not American sizes
2.0,"Just a regular house slipper.  Has memory foam and is comfortable, but has no arch support."
2.0,color was coming out even before first wash
2.0,Blow dryer fell off the first time I wore it. Just went to a party
2.0,The fabric itch a lot
2.0,Used these on a pair of blue air force ones cleaned  the shoe but eat the dye. You could see blue spots on the rag so I wouldn't  recommend using it on some rare shoes. Only use like two squirts to BTW.
2.0,I have lymphedema and thought I could use as a liner under wraps. The sock doesn't stretch on my leg as well as I'd want it. So knowing that its would be a poor excuse for a diabetic sock. Jagged fit.
2.0,"Item arrived with a stain. So, it fits as expected and material is thin, which I knew. But now I have to go through the hassle of returning. Which is what I will do, rather than replace."
2.0,"Used it for 1 week with work shirts. LOVED how my shirt stayed in place. But at end of week, stich came undine at the seem where the &#34;V&#34; is formed. VERY disappointed. At the price they charge I was expecting a lot more. This kind of workmanship is expected of $5 items. Shame"
2.0,Wasn't expecting it to be made of parachute material.
2.0,"I am returning the dress I don’t like the cocoon style, I didn’t realize what it was when I ordered it"
2.0,Order small cuz these are alot bigger than normal.
2.0,Returned with a bad zipper.
2.0,The tie-front was not double-sided fabric (the reverse side was white/non-printed) which made it look cheap. Overall wasn’t a great fit either.
2.0,I returned this item. Akward fit on the chest
2.0,"I was disappointed.  The dress fit perfectly, but the cardigan was too small across the chest.  And without the cardigan, the dress is just a little too casual for a wedding...too bad."
2.0,"it loose the coler so fast, and looks very cheap."
2.0,"The side pockets next to the zipper pockets rip to easily, weren't sewn correctly. But overall the pants looks great and great fit. I was going to buy a couple of more pairs for work (construction) but the quality shows me the pants won't handle the usage."
2.0,"I’m returning this item. I’m usually very easy to fit. Almost always a small. This item was too big. Also, it does not look like the picture. I’m built close to the girl in the pic, but the item looked all wrong. It looked sloppy on. The knot shows the underside and seam of the garment."
2.0,"The picture is not true to the shirt. I ordered gray and it's more of a tanish color with very bright flowers on it. I also expected it to be cotton, not 95% polyester. Was very disappointed"
2.0,"My watch didnt work upon arrival. Not sure if this was intentional or not. The watch itself is stylish and greatly compliments my clothing, as any accessory should, but the strap is not very good. It's very stiff, ugly, and difficult to maneuver. Still good for the price, though."
2.0,Not a good choice for me but will keep it.  Cheap canvas and zero class.  Maybe I'll find a use for it later.
2.0,Cool shoes although one of the lights sometimes works and that one light is a different color when the rest are all the same.
2.0,The fabric is linen (wasn't expecting that) so it has no stretch at all to it. I ordered the XL (even though I'm a size L) and it was a bit tight.  Not really as cute in person as it is on the model in the picture. Wouldn't order again. I received this product at discount for my honest review.
2.0,I ordered a 7-8 and it is still too small!
2.0,Some of the socks came broken and they did not last but one wear. sad.
2.0,"The color of this jacket and the styling are both great.  However, it was a bit tight (I ordered small, and sometimes even wear an extra small, so this is a very small ""Small"").  Also, I found the fabric a bit more thin than I wanted, though it might be great for others.  I sent it back because of these two issues."
2.0,"The bust area is way too big, I am a 36C. I will have to have this altered. It seems that I can't return it. Be careful before you buy"
2.0,"I'm giving this as a gift so can't speak as to the wear quality of the sock, but I'm disappointed with the color. I ordered Dijon, which in the photo appeared almost green, but the actual sock looks more brown. See the photo I took."
2.0,"The material does not look great, looks old. Somehow did not suit me."
2.0,"Save your money unless you are buying for a child. While they are nicely made and the color is good they are way to small for an adult. Other wise I'd have given them a better review. The photo shown no where matches what I actually received in the mail. I gave it a 2 as the color was good, and that is the only reason. If I'd bought them for my great granddaughter they would have been perfect. But not for an adult, they get lost to view they are that small."
2.0,I really liked the fit but these do not last. I have so many snags in them now. Material is low quality.
2.0,"This shirt is more like a cheap looking pajama top. It’s light and comfortable for lounging around the house or for layering underneath something else for out and about for very casual wear, but it lays on the body sort of like a shapeless sack, and is not very flattering. I’ve washed it one time and it already looks old, worn out. The fabric feels cheap and shabby although it is fairly comfortable/breathable I would not wear this as a stand alone top out somewhere. Good for working out in the yard though. I would not recommend it and I’d never buy another one. It feels like it would be going in the garbage in less than a year the way it’s washed badly after one cycle. I got it a larger size to be oversized but it’s strange fitting just not good."
2.0,It broke into 3 pieces not even a week of wearing it ! And to top it off it started turning colors . Do not purchase
2.0,Smaller than I expected and very very thin. I would not purchase this product again.
2.0,One of them is nice. The other two ate tiny and the strings don't really adjust.
2.0,"The material on this shirt is nice, but the way it's cut is all wrong. The sleeves are way too big and it's a little short on me. I'm 5'6 135lbs."
2.0,It’s a cute outfit but the color is not the same as advertised it definitely has a lot of pink in it which wasn’t what I expected but it’s still cute
2.0,"It looks really good, but it was 3 sizes too small. I ordered a 12, and it fits like an 8. I can't even get it on my finger. The quality is nice though. I gave it to my fiancé to wear for fun."
2.0,much cheaper looking than it looks in the picture online.
2.0,These earrings are okay. I really don’t like the pearl at the top of the earring hook. Doesn’t make sense to be apart of the design. Didn’t not see that in the picture
2.0,Nice looking shoe however they hurt my feet . I am on my feet all day and I ended up giving them away to buy another brand that works better for me .
2.0,It was not what I expected. It turned me daughters finger green..
2.0,"The shoes run small. Except for the ankle band, which was almost wide enough for both my daughter’s ankles. Definitely not in proportion to the rest of the shoe."
2.0,While it did fit as expected it fell apart after the first wash
2.0,"Color is not the Same shade as picture. I ordered navy blue, and it was much lighter. Fit is true to size. It is like a sweater type material and pretty heavy. Looked terrible on my 5’3” frame."
2.0,"Purchased 3 pair 3 times. Learned not to walk around in these socks without shoes or slippers on. Heels have worn through on 3 of the 9 pairs so far. Lasted about 90 days before heels got holes. Otherwise good fit. Comfortable. Will not reorder due to no cushion on soles, thin material, wears through way too fast. Also after washing several times they shrink and tuned into low cut socks."
2.0,"this is not stone, the red comes off on your skin when you wear it. Very disappointed"
2.0,It’s a really nice size but the color started to wear off after having it for only 2 days‼️
2.0,Runs large.. usually a small. Got small and it was too big.. fits like a medium and the sleeves was so long. Had to RETURN.
2.0,"Shockingly small, the S fits like a 00 or even perhaps whatever size is below that. I'm normally a size 2 or 4 depending on the brand. I'm surprised more reviewers didn't note how off the sizing is. Seaming is also crooked at the waist and of poorer quality than expected for a near $50 dress."
2.0,"I actually was super excited about this skirt! It looked flowy and super comfortable! I wanted to LOVE this skirt... but that's not what happened, and now I have to figure out what to do with it. The outer layer of the skirt is nearly perfect. Exactly the way I pictured it. But the slip that's sewn in underneath is a NIGHTMARE!!! It's a straight cut silk slip, definitely not meant for a curvy girl like myself. The whole point of a flowy skirt was because I'm curvy and I need the room. This skirt did not permit that. I ended up cutting the slip nearly all the way down on the seam on both sides. That permitted me to at least fit into it, but then there was no slip underneath the very shear chiffon layer. So word to the wise, if you have any thighs at all, don't bother with this skirt unless you plan on altering it."
2.0,Ring is very thin and lightweight - sizing is also a little large.  Disappointed when it arrived.
2.0,"I bought 2 of these when the weather forecast predicted 90 degrees. We don't have AC, so sleeveless was a priority. The Pink version of this came first and while the feel of the garment was good, it was definitely NOT sleeveless. It had short sleeves. A big disappointment! Then I tried it on and it was too small. I wear 3X and like my pajamas to be roomy and these were definitely not roomy. Back it goes!<br /><br />As for the second one I ordered (Hummingbird print) I received it a few days after the other one. This one WAS sleeveless and after trying it on, I felt it was a little small, but the feel of the fabric is nice and since it is going to be over 90 degrees again today, I'll test it out tonight! Cute print, too!"
2.0,I love the pattern but its to small and I got a medium
2.0,it's worth the money to do real wood. clearly looks like cheep plastic
2.0,After 2 months the stopped working
2.0,I did not like the way this blouse fit me. I did not like the fabric. Looks great in the picture.
2.0,Way  to flashy hated the gold very heavy and hot
2.0,So I ordered this swim suit in the hopes for a nice swim suit for summer. The color is nice the material is swim suit material. I ordered a medium and I wear size 7 in pants the bottom fit fine for me but is very cheeky so I'd order a large if you want more coverage but the top was terrible. The part for your chest has padded support that is removable for but I am 32d and my boobs didn't have enough room in a medium but it was so huge on the rest of me so too small on my chest area and too big around me and there isn't a way to adjust it. But it just looked terrible I'd figure it would be small in both area if that was the case and it could be just that it's so loose that it doesn't fit my chest because of it! Id say if you broader chested and smaller breasts this would be nice on you but for my frame it was nothing nice besides the bottoms:(<br /><br />I receieved this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review
2.0,"I bought this for my dogs sleeping bag...NOT even gonna fit. Managed to get a very small camp pillow into it, but it took some work. Very disappointed. It ACTUALLY measures 6'x 10"", not the 14"" advertised or it would have worked fine.  I wanted a 5L bag figuring it would be 1/2 the size of all the 10L bags I own. A 10L would be overkill for my dogs sleeping bag and I want her to be able to carry her own camping gear on her pack not mine !<br />Built well enough, though the size is closer to 3 or 4L. Back to looking elsewhere."
2.0,Definitely NOT a sweatshirt!! Very thin and cheaply made--long sleeve shirt maybe....also  product showed up much earlier than was told--Great right? NO I had to pay to ship it 2x--Had I known it was going to be on time I'd have shipped it directly in the 1st place!!!
2.0,Already broke a piece
2.0,"The robe is super soft, and based on how much my daughter likes it, I'd imagined it is pretty comfortable. Tge robe also fits her perfectly.<br /><br />But I am giving it 2 stars because the robe I received was damaged. It has holes and tears in the seams of the arms, and it is evident that it is just a matter of time before the arms just rip off."
2.0,Cheap looking and the watch pops out at times. Also it says “watch” on the side which makes it look even cheaper.
2.0,These were so super cute however were also so super small they will fit but not nice the barley fit I am usually a large but based on reviews I need to order a bigger size for these order two sizes up.
2.0,"The rubber gasket came out of the inside of the bead, which is used to keep it tight.  It came out in 2 weeks."
2.0,"Not impressed,  did not fit. Cute,  maybe for a little girl who wants a charm bracelet."
2.0,"The description of this says it is down children and women. This was not accurate. This mask clearly fits and average to large adult’s face. This pretty much swallowed my 11 year olds while face when she put it on. It will work for adults.<br />There is funny pocket that hangs on the inside of the mask. This is where you insert the filter. However, this pocket just hangs out against your face instead of being integrated into the mask.<br />The mask material is silk-like and the colors are rich."
2.0,"The wallet itself is nice quality.  However, once you fill the wallet with everything, it is way too thick to carry in one's pocket."
2.0,Fit as expected but the zipper wouldn’t stay up for me. Had to return it.
2.0,Fit ok for the ones that were the correct size.
2.0,Did not fit according to size
2.0,Really hurt my ears no matter how or where i moved them on the frame of my glasses.
2.0,Material is thin and it does not look like the picture. Will be returning
2.0,I love my  cowboy hat.
2.0,I purchased these pants to lounge around in Hawaii.  They were big enough for two people.  Not sure why they were sized so incredibly large.  They are also very thin.  Perfect for exhibitionist..
2.0,Very sheer and the side seams were sewn crooked so the shirt didn't lie straight. Terrible quality.
2.0,"It's length is very short for a shirt of this style. It fits close to the body so if your body is not smooth go up a size or two. It washed O.K. for, no shrinkage but I wash cool, rinse cold, dry on a hanger & iron. I don't know how it would wash on warmer settings or with machine drying."
2.0,Most pieces were very small and were so hard to open that I broke my nails in them. Would not buy again.
2.0,"Beautiful piece of jewelry, HOWEVER this is NOT a choker & needs to be accurately advertised to avoid those looking specifically for a choker.<br /><br />Even on the tightest link, there is too much space to mistake this for anything but a regular necklace.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I purchased this necklace without enough time to return or replace it, as it arrived the day of my event.<br /><br />Because I was expecting a gold choker and had no backup, I had to wear the gold necklace thus voiding my ability to return it.<br /><br />Please refer to the image I included for visual reference."
2.0,"I love Injinjis in general... was very excited to find these for the ""hidden sock"" look.  But very small, even though I purchased recommended size.  The elastic cuts into my foot and the sock is very thin, thinner than expected.  I was bummed."
2.0,Bust area is sewn wrong
2.0,"This is a beautiful leotard. However, the elastic started shedding almost immediately. We have to give it a “haircut” before wearing it. It’s all intact, but it does this weird shedding thing. It’s very inconvenient."
2.0,Material is very sheer
2.0,i loved the design but it just would not fit on my head
2.0,The material feel good and make your stomach look flat  The only thing that I don't like about this if you've been down it rolls down
2.0,Several of these didn't work or didn't last long.
2.0,Definitely false misrepresentation on the picture.  The one I received had no brown on it whatsoever.  All accent fur is white and there are absolutely NO BEADS anywhere on mine.  The front where the beads are shown is just red fake leather with a cross stitch on the front.  Very plain and boring!  Time was of the essence so I can not return it for something else and I feel like I was scammed into paying more than it is worth based on the false photos!
2.0,Had it for about six months and I washed it two times and it ripped all under the armpit.
2.0,Very very small. I ordered it for my daughter who is an XL in skirts. We ordered an XXL and the zipper wouldn't even zip up. I'd suggest you order 2-3 sizes bigger then your regular size.
2.0,"It's still kinda cute, but it's not as advertised in the images.<br />First it is the topical around the ears and not the clasp behind the head like in the images.<br /> Second the images has some stich work or wire to get the mask contoured to fit the face."
2.0,There were runs in the neon pair but the black ones were okay.
2.0,"Fabric is thick and bulky, doesn't fall the way it should, looks frumpy."
